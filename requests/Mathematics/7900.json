Image data from sources like MRI and CT can be visualised, analysed, segmented and quantified, before being exported as CAD, CAE and 3D printing models. Different tissues, bones and other parts of the body can be identified using a wide range of segmentation and processing tools in the software. Options are also available for integrating CAD and image data, enabling medical device research to be conducted into how CAD-designed implants interact with the human body. High-quality CAE models can similarly be used in [[biomechanics]] research to simulate movement and the effect of different forces on anatomies.

Finite element contacts, node sets and shell elements can be defined, as can boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics. Material properties can be assigned based on greyscale values or pre-set values. Users can decide between a grid-based or a free meshing approach. Meshes can be exported directly into leading [[Computer-aided engineering]] solvers without the need for further processing. The result can be exported to [[Abaqus|ABAQUS]] (<code>.inp</code> files), [[ANSYS]] (<code>.ans</code> files), [[COMSOL Multiphysics]] (<code>.mphtxt</code> files), [[I-DEAS]] (<code>.unv</code> files), [[LS-DYNA]] (<code>.dyn</code> files), [[MSC Software|MSC]] (<code>.out</code> files), [[Fluent, Inc.|FLUENT]] (<code>.msh</code> files)\n\n===CAD===\nThe CAD module allows for the import and interactive positioning of CAD models within image data. The resulting combined models can then be exported as multi-part STLs or, using the FE module, converted automatically into multi-part finite element or CFD meshes. Internal structures can also be added to data to reduce weight whilst maintaining mechanical strength. With CAD, users can avoid having to work with image-based files in CAD-based software. Data can be acquired from ScanIP, [[IGES]] (<code>.iges</code> and <code>.igs</code> files), STEP (<code>.step</code> and <code>.stp</code> files), [[STL (file format)|STL]] (<code>.stl</code> files). The result can be saved in ScanIP files for further processing or exported to [[STL (file format)|STL]] (<code>.stl</code> files).\n\n===NURBS===\nThe NURBS module allows segmented 3D image data to be fitted with [[Non-uniform rational B-spline|non-uniform rational B-splines]] (NURBS) using automated patch fitting techniques for export as [[IGES]] (<code>.iges</code> and <code>.igs</code> files). Autosurface algorithms provide a straightforward route from image data to CAD-ready NURBS models, with options available for contour and curvature detection. CAD geometries can also be inspected prior to export to remove spurious features.\n\n===SOLID===\nThe SOLID module calculates the effective stiffness tensor and individual elastic moduli of material samples. Perform numerical homogenisation with a built-in FE solver or derive quick semi-analytical estimates from segmented images.\n\n===FLOW===\nThe FLOW module calculates the absolute permeability tensor of porous material samples. Numerical homogenisation is performed using a built-in Stokes solver.\n\n===LAPLACE===\nThe LAPLACE module calculates the effective electrical, thermal and molecular properties of materials whose behaviour is governed by the [[Laplace's equation]]. Perform numerical homogenisation with a built-in FE solver or derive quick semi-analytical estimates from segmented images.\n\n== Import formats ==\n* [[Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine|DICOM]]\n* ACR-NEMA\n* Interfile\n* Analyze\n* MetaImage\n* Raw image data (binary, CSV...)\n* 2D image stacks (BMP, GIF...)\n\n== Export formats ==\n\nBackground image export\n* [[RAW image format]]\n* [[MetaImage]]\n* Stack of images (BMP, JPG, PNG, TIF)\n\nSegmented image\n\n* [[Raw image format]]\n* [[MetaImage]]\n\nSurface model (triangles)\n\n* [[STL (file format)|STL]]\n* [[IGES]]\n* [[ACIS]] (SAT)\n* [[ANSYS]] surface mesh\n* [[ABAQUS]] surface mesh\n* [[Open Inventor]]\n* [[Point cloud]]\n* [[MATLAB]] file surface\n\nAnimations\n\n* [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]]\n* [[Ogg Theora]]\n* [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]]\n* Windows Media Video [[Advanced Systems Format]]\n* [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] sequence\n\n2D and 3D screenshot\n\n* [[JPEG]]\n* [[Portable Network Graphics]]\n* [[VRML]]\n* Postscript (*.eps)\n* [[BMP file format|BMP]]\n* [[Portable anymap|PNM]]\n* [[PDF]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Biomedical engineering]]\n[[Category:Windows multimedia software]]\n[[Category:3D graphics software]]\n[[Category:Mesh generators]]\n[[Category:3D imaging]]\n[[Category:Image processing software]]\n[[Category:Nondestructive testing]]\n[[Category:Science software]]"

The initial goal was to quickly visualize any of the tens of thousands of large 3D [[Confocal microscopy|laser scanning microscopy]] image stacks of fruit fly brains, each with a few gigabytes in volume. Low level [[OpenGL]]-based 3D rendering was developed to provide direct rendering of multi-dimensional image stacks. C/[[C++]] and [[Qt (software)|Qt]] were used to create cross-platform compatibility so the software can run on Mac, Linux and Windows. Strong functions for synchronizing multiple 2D/3D/4D/5D rendered views, generating global and local 3D viewers, and virtual finger, allow Vaa3D be able to streamline a number of operations for complicated brain science tasks, for example, brain comparison and neuron reconstruction. Vaa3D also provides an extensible [[plugin (computing)|plugin]] interface that currently hosts dozens of open source plugins contributed by researchers worldwide.\n\n==3D visualization of 3D, 4D, and 5D image data==\nVaa3D is able to render 3D, 4D, and 5D data (X,Y,Z,Color,Time) quickly. The [[volume rendering]] is typically at the scale of a few gigabytes and can be extended to the scale of terabytes per image set. The visualization is made fast by using OpenGL directly.\n\nVaa3D handles the problem of large data visualization via several techniques. One way is to combine both the synchronized and asynchronized data rendering, which displays the full resolution data only when the rotation or other dynamic display of the data is paused, and otherwise displays only a coarse level image.\n\nAn alternative method used in Vaa3D is to combine both global and local 3D viewers. The global 3D viewer optionally displays only the downsampled image while the local 3D viewer displays full resolution image but only at certain local areas. Intuitive 3D navigation is done by determining a 3D region of interest using the Virtual Finger technique followed by generating in real-time a specific 3D local viewer for such a region of interest.\n\n==Fast 3D human-machine interaction, virtual finger and 3D WYSIWYG==\n3D visualization of an image stack is essentially a passive process to observe the data. The combination of an active way to input a user's preference of specific locations quickly greatly increase the efficiency of exploration of the 3D or higher-dimensional image contents. Nonetheless, ‘exploring 3D image content’ requires that a user is able to efficiently interact with and quantitatively profile the patterns of image objects using a graphical user interface of 3D image-visualization tools. Virtual Finger, or 3D-[[WYSIWYG]] ('What You See in 2D is What You Get in 3D') technique allows efficient generation and use of the 3D location information from 2D input of a user on the typical 2D display or touch devices.\n\nThe Virtual Finger technique maps the identified 2D user input via 2D display devices, such as a computer screen, back to the 3D volumetric space of the image. Mathematically, this is an often difficult inverse problem.

It has been used to boost the performance of image data acquisition, visualization, management, annotation, analysis and the use of the image data for real-time experiments such as microsurgery.\n\n==Rendering of surface objects==\nVaa3D displays three major types of 3D surface objects:\n* Point cloud: a set of 3D spherical objects, each with a different color, type, size, and other properties. This is often used to model a population of cells or similar particle-like objects.\n* Relational data (graph, tube-connected network): each node in the graph has a specific size and type and is connected to other nodes. This is often used to model neuron morphology, network topology, etc.\n* Irregular surface objects: Each 3D surface has irregular shape and is modeled using complicated surface mesh.\n\nThese 3D surface objects are also often arranged as \"sets\". Vaa3D can display multiple sets of any of these surface objects, which can also be overlaid on top of image voxel data using different overlaying relationships. These features are useful for colocalization, quantification, comparison, and other purposes.\n\n==Applications==\nThe software has been used in a number of applications such as the following examples.\n  \n===Neuron reconstruction and quantification===\nVaa3D provides a Vaa3D-Neuron package to [[Neuronal tracing|reconstruct, quantify, and compare 3D morphology of single neurons]] of a number of species.\n\nVaa3D-Neuron allows several ways of neuron tracing.\n\n* Manual tracing: A user can use 3D Virtual Finger to manually reconstruct or edit a neuron structure quickly in 3D.\n* Semi-automatic tracing: A user can specify some key termini points where the neuron tracing must reach as prior, and then ask Vaa3D to complete the 3D reconstruction automatically.

      "text": "In [[geometry]], a '''triangulation''' is a subdivision of a [[plane (geometry)|planar object]] into triangles, and by extension the subdivision of a higher-dimension geometric object into [[simplex|simplices]]. Triangulations of a three-dimensional volume would involve subdividing it into [[tetrahedra]] (\"pyramids\" of various shapes and sizes) packed together. \n\nIn most instances, the triangles of a triangulation are required to meet edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex.\n\n==Types==\n\nDifferent types of triangulations may be defined, depending both on what geometric object is to be subdivided and on how the subdivision is determined.\n* A triangulation <math>T</math> of <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math> is a subdivision of <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math> into <math>d</math>-dimensional simplices such that any two simplices in <math>T</math> intersect in a common face (a simplex of any lower dimension) or not at all, and any [[bounded set]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}^d</math> intersects only [[finite set|finite]]ly many simplices in <math>T</math>. That is, it is a locally finite [[simplicial complex]] that covers the entire space.\n* A [[point set triangulation]], i.e., a triangulation of a [[discrete space|discrete]] set of points <math>\\mathcal{P}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d</math>, is a subdivision of the [[convex hull]] of the points into simplices such that any two simplices intersect in a common [[Face (geometry)|face]] of any dimension or not at all and such that the set of vertices of the simplices are contained in <math>\\mathcal{P}</math>. Frequently used and studied point set triangulations include the [[Delaunay triangulation]] (for points in general position, the set of simplices that are circumscribed by an open ball that contains no input points) and the [[minimum-weight triangulation]] (the point set triangulation minimizing the sum of the edge lengths).\n* In [[cartography]], a [[triangulated irregular network]] is a point set triangulation of a set of two-dimensional points together with elevations for each point. Lifting each point from the plane to its elevated height lifts the triangles of the triangulation into three-dimensional surfaces, which form an approximation of a three-dimensional landform.\n* A [[polygon triangulation]] is a subdivision of a given [[polygon]] into triangles meeting edge-to-edge, again with the property that the set of triangle vertices coincides with the set of vertices of the polygon. Polygon triangulations may be found in [[linear time]] and form the basis of several important geometric algorithms, including a simple approximate solution to the [[art gallery problem]]. The [[constrained Delaunay triangulation]] is an adaptation of the Delaunay triangulation from point sets to polygons or, more generally, to [[planar straight-line graph]]s.\n* A [[Surface triangulation|triangulation of a surface]] consists of a net of triangles with points on a given surface covering the surface partly or totally. \n* In the [[finite element method]], triangulations are often used as the mesh underlying a computation. In this case, the triangles must form a subdivision of the domain to be simulated, but instead of restricting the vertices to input points, it is allowed to add additional [[Steiner point (computational geometry)|Steiner points]] as vertices. In order to be suitable as finite element meshes, a triangulation must have well-shaped triangles, according to criteria that depend on the details of the finite element simulation; for instance, some methods require that all triangles be right or acute, forming [[nonobtuse mesh]]es. Many meshing techniques are known, including [[Delaunay refinement]] algorithms such as [[Chew's second algorithm]] and [[Ruppert's algorithm]].\n* In more general topological spaces, [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] of a space generally refer to simplicial complexes that are [[homeomorphic]] to the space.\n\n==Generalization==\n\nThe concept of a triangulation may also be generalized somewhat to subdivisions into shapes related to triangles. In particular, a [[pseudotriangulation]] of a point set is a partition of the convex hull of the points into pseudotriangles, polygons that like triangles have exactly three convex vertices. As in point set triangulations, pseudotriangulations are required to have their vertices at the given input points.\n\n==External links==\n* {{mathworld | urlname = SimplicialComplex  | title = Simplicial complex}}\n* {{mathworld | urlname = Triangulation | title = Triangulation}}\n\n[[Category:Triangulation (geometry)| ]]"

      "text": "[[File:Apollonian-network.svg|thumb|240px|An Apollonian network]]\n[[File:Goldner-Harary graph.svg|thumb|The [[Goldner–Harary graph]], a non-Hamiltonian Apollonian network]]\nIn [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], an '''Apollonian network''' is an [[undirected graph]] formed by a process of recursively subdividing a triangle into three smaller triangles. Apollonian networks may equivalently be defined as the [[planar graph|planar]] [[k-tree|3-tree]]s, the maximal planar chordal graphs, the [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable]] planar graphs, and the graphs of [[stacked polytope]]s. They are named after [[Apollonius of Perga]], who studied a related circle-packing construction.\n\n==Definition==\nAn Apollonian network may be formed, starting from a single triangle [[graph embedding|embedded]] in the [[Euclidean plane]], by repeatedly selecting a triangular face of the embedding, adding a new vertex inside the face, and connecting the new vertex to each vertex of the face containing it. In this way, the triangle containing the new vertex is subdivided into three smaller triangles, which may in turn be subdivided in the same way.\n\n==Examples==\nThe [[complete graph]]s on three and four vertices, {{math|''K''<sub>3</sub>}} and {{math|''K''<sub>4</sub>}}, are both Apollonian networks. {{math|''K''<sub>3</sub>}} is formed by starting with a triangle and not performing any subdivisions, while {{math|''K''<sub>4</sub>}} is formed by making a single subdivision before stopping.\n\nThe [[Goldner–Harary graph]] is an Apollonian network that forms the smallest [[Hamiltonian cycle|non-Hamiltonian]] maximal planar graph.<ref>This graph is named after the work of {{harvtxt|Goldner|Harary|1975}}; however, it appears earlier in the literature, for instance in {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1967}}, p.&nbsp;357.</ref> Another more complicated Apollonian network was used by {{harvtxt|Nishizeki|1980}} to provide an example of a [[Graph toughness|1-tough]] non-Hamiltonian maximal planar graph.\n\n==Graph-theoretic characterizations==\nAs well as being defined by recursive subdivision of triangles, the Apollonian networks have several other equivalent mathematical characterizations. They are the [[chordal graph|chordal]] maximal planar graphs, the chordal [[polyhedral graph]]s, and the planar [[k-tree|3-trees]]. They are the [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable]] planar graphs, and the planar graphs with a unique [[Schnyder wood]] decomposition into three trees. They are the maximal planar graphs with treewidth three, a class of graphs that can be characterized by their [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]] or by their reducability under [[Y-Δ transform]]s. They are the maximal planar graphs with [[degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] three. They are also the planar graphs on a given number of vertices that have the largest possible number of triangles, the largest possible number of tetrahedral subgraphs, the largest possible number of cliques, and the largest possible number of pieces after decomposing by separating triangles.\n\n===Chordality===\nApollonian networks are examples of [[maximal element|maximal]] [[planar graph]]s, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying planarity, or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the outer face) is a triangle. They are also [[chordal graph]]s, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and the order in which vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a chordal graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the chordal maximal planar graphs or equivalently the chordal [[polyhedral graph]]s.<ref>The equivalence of planar 3-trees and chordal maximal planar graphs was stated without proof by {{harvtxt|Patil|1986}}. For a proof, see {{harvtxt|Markenzon|Justel|Paciornik|2006}}. For a more general characterization of chordal planar graphs, and an efficient recognition algorithm for these graphs, see {{harvtxt|Kumar|Madhavan|1989}}. The observation that every chordal polyhedral graph is maximal planar was stated explicitly by {{harvtxt|Gerlach|2004}}.</ref>\n\nIn an Apollonian network, every [[maximal clique]] is a complete graph on four vertices, formed by choosing any vertex and its three earlier neighbors. Every minimal [[clique-sum|clique separator]] (a clique that partitions the graph into two disconnected subgraphs) is one of the subdivided triangles. A chordal graph in which all maximal cliques and all minimal clique separators have the same size is a [[k-tree|{{math|''k''}}-tree]], and Apollonian networks are examples of 3-trees. Not every 3-tree is planar, but the planar 3-trees are exactly the Apollonian networks.\n\n===Unique colorability===\nEvery Apollonian network is also a [[uniquely colorable graph|uniquely 4-colorable graph]]. Because it is a planar graph, the [[four color theorem]] implies that it has a [[graph coloring]] with only four colors, but once the three colors of the initial triangle are selected, there is only one possible choice for the color of each successive vertex, so up to permutation of the set of colors it has exactly one 4-coloring. It is more difficult to prove, but also true, that every uniquely 4-colorable planar graph is an Apollonian network. Therefore, Apollonian networks may also be characterized as the uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs.{{sfnp|Fowler|1998}} Apollonian networks also provide examples of planar graphs having as few {{math|''k''}}-colorings as possible for {{math|''k'' > 4}}.<ref>The fact that Apollonian networks minimize the number of colorings with more than four of colors was shown in a dual form for colorings of maps by {{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1930}}.</ref>\n\nThe Apollonian networks are also exactly the maximal planar graphs that (once an exterior face is fixed) have a unique [[Schnyder wood]], a partition of the edges of the graph into three interleaved trees rooted at the three vertices of the exterior face.<ref>{{harvtxt|Felsner|Zickfeld|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Bernardi|Bonichon|2009}}.</ref>\n\n===Treewidth===\nThe Apollonian networks do not form a family of graphs that is closed under the operation of taking [[graph minor]]s, as removing edges but not vertices from an Apollonian network produces a graph that is not an Apollonian network. However, the planar [[partial k-tree|partial 3-trees]], subgraphs of Apollonian networks, are minor-closed. Therefore, according to the [[Robertson–Seymour theorem]], they can be characterized by a finite number of [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden minors]]. The minimal forbidden minors for the planar partial 3-trees are the four minimal graphs among the forbidden minors for the planar graphs and the partial 3-trees: the [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''<sub>5</sub>}}, the [[complete bipartite graph]] {{math|''K''<sub>3,3</sub>}}, the graph of the [[octahedron]], and the graph of the [[pentagonal prism]]. The Apollonian graphs are the maximal graphs that do not have any of these four graphs as a minor.<ref>The two forbidden minors for planar graphs are given by [[Wagner's theorem]]. For the forbidden minors for partial 3-trees (which include also the nonplanar [[Wagner graph]]) see {{harvtxt|Arnborg|Proskurowski|Corniel|1986}} and {{harvtxt|Bodlaender|1998}}. For direct proofs that the octahedral graph and the pentagonal-prism graph are the only two planar forbidden minors, see {{harvtxt|Dai|Sato|1990}} and {{harvtxt|El-Mallah|Colbourn|1990}}.</ref>\n\nA [[Y-Δ transform]], an operation that replaces a degree-three vertex in a graph by a triangle connecting its neighbors, is sufficient (together with the removal of parallel edges) to reduce any Apollonian network to a single triangle, and more generally the planar graphs that can be reduced to a single edge by Y-Δ transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices are exactly the planar partial 3-trees. The dual graphs of the planar partial 3-trees form another minor-closed graph family and are exactly the planar graphs that can be reduced to a single edge by Δ-Y transforms, removal of parallel edges, removal of degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices.<ref>{{harvtxt|Politof|1983}} introduced the Δ-Y reducible planar graphs and characterized them in terms of forbidden homeomorphic subgraphs. The duality between the Δ-Y and Y-Δ reducible graphs, the forbidden minor characterizations of both classes, and the connection to planar partial 3-trees are all from {{harvtxt|El-Mallah|Colbourn|1990}}.</ref>\n\n===Degeneracy===\nIn every subgraph of an Apollonian network, the most recently added vertex has [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] at most three, so Apollonian networks have [[Degeneracy (graph theory)|degeneracy]] three. The order in which the vertices are added to create the network is therefore a degeneracy ordering, and the Apollonian networks coincide with the 3-degenerate maximal planar graphs.\n\n===Extremality===\nAnother characterization of the Apollonian networks involves their [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]]. Any maximal planar graph may be decomposed into 4-vertex-connected maximal planar subgraphs by splitting it along its separating triangles (triangles that are not faces of the graph): given any non-facial triangle: one can form two smaller maximal planar graphs, one consisting of the part inside the triangle and the other consisting of the part outside the triangle. The maximal planar graphs without separating triangles that may be formed by repeated splits of this type are sometimes called blocks, although that name has also been used for the [[biconnected component]]s of a graph that is not itself biconnected. An Apollonian network is a maximal planar graph in which all of the blocks are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the complete graph&nbsp;{{math|''K''<sub>4</sub>}}.\n\nIn [[extremal graph theory]], Apollonian networks are also exactly the {{math|''n''}}-vertex planar graphs in which the number of blocks achieves its maximum, {{math|''n'' &minus; 3}}, and the planar graphs in which the number of triangles achieves its maximum, {{math|3''n'' &minus; 8}}. Since each {{math|''K''<sub>4</sub>}} subgraph of a planar graph must be a block, these are also the planar graphs in which the number of {{math|''K''<sub>4</sub>}} subgraphs achieves its maximum, {{math|''n'' &minus; 3}}, and the graphs in which the number of [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] of any type achieves its maximum, {{math|8''n'' &minus; 16}}.<ref>For the characterization in terms of the maximum number of triangles in a planar graph, see {{harvtxt|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1979}}. {{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}} quote this result and provide the characterizations in terms of the isomorphism classes of blocks and numbers of blocks. The bound on the total number of cliques follows easily from the bounds on triangles and ''K''<sub>4</sub> subgraphs, and is also stated explicitly by {{harvtxt|Wood|2007}}, who provides an Apollonian network as an example showing that this bound is tight. For generalizations of these bounds to nonplanar surfaces, see {{harvtxt|Dujmović|Fijavž|Joret|Wood|2009}}.</ref>\n\n==Geometric realizations==\n\n===Construction from circle packings===\n[[File:Apollonian gasket.svg|thumb|An example of an Apollonian gasket]]\n[[File:Circle packing theorem K5 minus edge example.svg|thumb|left|Construction of an Apollonian network from a circle packing]]\nApollonian networks are named after [[Apollonius of Perga]], who studied the [[Problem of Apollonius]] of constructing a circle tangent to three other circles. One method of constructing Apollonian networks is to start with three mutually-tangent circles and then repeatedly inscribe another circle within the gap formed by three previously-drawn circles. The fractal collection of circles produced in this way is called an [[Apollonian gasket]].\n\nIf the process of producing an Apollonian gasket is stopped early, with only a finite set of circles, then the graph that has one vertex for each circle and one edge for each pair of tangent circles is an Apollonian network.<ref>{{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}}.</ref> The existence of a set of tangent circles whose tangencies represent a given Apollonian network forms a simple instance of the [[Circle packing theorem|Koebe–Andreev–Thurston circle-packing theorem]], which states that any planar graph can be represented by tangent circles in the same way.<ref>{{harvtxt|Thurston|1978–1981}}.</ref>\n\n===Polyhedra===\n[[File:Triakistetrahedron.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[triakis tetrahedron]], a polyhedral realization of an 8-vertex Apollonian network]]\nApollonian networks are planar [[vertex connectivity|3-connected graphs]] and therefore, by [[Steinitz's theorem]], can always be represented as the graphs of convex [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. The convex polyhedron representing an Apollonian network is a 3-dimensional [[stacked polytope]]. Such a polytope can be obtained from a tetrahedron by repeatedly gluing additional tetrahedra one at a time onto its triangular faces. Therefore, Apollonian networks may also be defined as the graphs of stacked 3d polytopes.<ref>See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Below|De Loera|Richter-Gebert|2000}}.</ref> It is possible to find a representation of any Apollonian network as convex 3d polyhedron in which all of the coordinates are integers of polynomial size, better than what is known for other planar graphs.<ref>{{harvtxt|Demaine|Schulz|2011}}.</ref>\n\n===Triangle meshes===\nThe recursive subdivision of triangles into three smaller triangles was investigated as an [[Segmentation (image processing)|image segmentation]] technique in [[computer vision]] by {{harvtxt|Elcock|Gargantini|Walsh|1987}}; in this context, they called it the '''ternary scalene triangle decomposition'''. They observed that, by placing each new vertex at the [[centroid]] of its enclosing triangle, the triangulation could be chosen in such a way that all triangles have equal areas, although they do not all have the same shape. More generally,\nApollonian networks may be drawn in the plane with any prescribed area in each face; if the areas are [[rational number]]s, so are all of the vertex coordinates.<ref>{{harvtxt|Biedl|Ruiz Velázquez|2010}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to carry out the process of subdividing a triangle to form an Apollonian network in such a way that, at every step, the edge lengths are rational numbers; it is an open problem whether every planar graph has a drawing with this property.<ref>For subdividing a triangle with rational side lengths so that the smaller triangles also have rational side lengths, see {{harvtxt|Almering|1963}}. For progress on the general problem of finding planar drawings with rational edge lengths, see {{harvtxt|Geelen|Guo|McKinnon|2008}}.</ref> It is possible in [[polynomial time]] to find a drawing of a planar 3-tree with integer coordinates minimizing the area of the [[bounding box]] of the drawing, and to test whether a given planar 3-tree may be drawn with its vertices on a given set of points.<ref>For the drawings with integer coordinates, see {{harvtxt|Mondal|Nishat|Rahman|Alam|2010}}, and for the drawings on a given vertex set, see {{harvtxt|Nishat|Mondal|Rahman|2011}}.</ref>\n\n==Properties and applications==\n\n===Matching-free graphs===\n{{harvtxt|Plummer|1992}} used Apollonian networks to construct an infinite family of maximal planar graphs with an even number of vertices but with no [[perfect matching]]. Plummer's graphs are formed in two stages. In the first stage, starting from a triangle {{math|''abc''}}, one repeatedly subdivides the triangular face of the subdivision that contains edge {{math|''bc''}}: the result is a graph consisting of a path from {{math|''a''}} to the final subdivision vertex together with an edge from each path vertex to each of {{math|''b''}} and {{math|''c''}}. In the second stage, each of the triangular faces of the resulting planar graph is subdivided one more time. If the path from {{math|''a''}} to the final subdivision vertex of the first stage has even length, then the number of vertices in the overall graph is also even. However, approximately 2/3 of the vertices are the ones inserted in the second stage; these form an [[independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], and cannot be matched to each other, nor are there enough vertices outside the independent set to find matches for all of them.\n\nAlthough Apollonian networks themselves may not have perfect matchings, the [[planar dual]] graphs of Apollonian networks are [[cubic graph|3-regular graphs]] with no [[Bridge (graph theory)|cut edges]], so by a theorem of {{harvtxt|Petersen|1891}} they are guaranteed to have at least one perfect matching. However, in this case more is known: the duals of Apollonian networks always have an exponential number of perfect matchings.<ref>{{harvtxt|Jiménez|Kiwi|2010}}.</ref> [[László Lovász]] and [[Michael D. Plummer]] conjectured that a similar exponential lower bound holds more generally for every 3-regular graph without cut edges, a result that was later proven.\n\n===Power law graphs===\n{{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}} studied [[power law]]s in the [[degree (graph theory)|degree sequences]] of a special case of networks of this type, formed by subdividing all triangles the same number of times. They used these networks to model packings of space by particles of varying sizes. Based on their work, other authors introduced random Apollonian networks, formed by repeatedly choosing a random face to subdivide, and they showed that these also obey power laws in their degree distribution <ref>{{harvtxt|Tsourakakis|2011}}</ref>  and have small average distances.<ref name=\"ran\">{{harvtxt|Zhou|Yan|Zhou|Fu|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Zhou|Yan|Wang|2005}}.</ref> [[Alan M. Frieze]] and Charalampos E. Tsourakakis analyzed the highest degrees and the eigenvalues of random Apollonian networks .<ref>{{harvtxt|Frieze|Tsourakakis|2011}}</ref> Andrade et al. also observed that their networks satisfy the [[small world effect]], that all vertices are within a small distance of each other. Based on numerical evidence they estimated the average distance between randomly selected pairs of vertices in an {{math|''n''}}-vertex network of this type to be proportional to {{math|(log ''n'')<sup>3/4</sup>}}, but later researchers showed that the average distance is actually proportional to {{math|log ''n''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Albenque|Marckert|2008}};{{harvtxt|Zhang|Chen|Zhou|Fang|2008}}.</ref>\n\n===Angle distribution===\n{{harvtxt|Butler|Graham|2010}} observed that if each new vertex is placed at the [[incenter]] of its triangle, so that the edges to the new vertex [[Bisection#Angle bisector|bisect the angles]] of the triangle, then the set of triples of angles of triangles in the subdivision, when reinterpreted as triples of [[barycentric coordinate system (mathematics)|barycentric coordinate]]s of points in an [[equilateral triangle]], converges in shape to the [[Sierpinski triangle]] as the number of levels of subdivision grows.\n\n===Hamiltonicity===\n{{harvtxt|Takeo|1960}} claimed erroneously that all Apollonian networks have [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s; however, the [[Goldner–Harary graph]] provides a counterexample. If an Apollonian network has [[graph toughness|toughness]] greater than one (meaning that removing any set of vertices from the graph leaves a smaller number of connected components than the number of removed vertices) then it necessarily has a Hamiltonian cycle, but there exist non-Hamiltonian Apollonian networks whose toughness is equal to one.<ref>See {{harvtxt|Nishizeki|1980}} for a 1-tough non-Hamiltonian example, {{harvtxt|Böhme|Harant|Tkáč|1999}} for the proof that Apollonian networks with greater toughness are Hamiltonian, and {{harvtxt|Gerlach|2004}} for an extension of this result to a wider class of planar graphs.</ref>\n\n===Enumeration===\nThe [[combinatorial enumeration]] problem of counting Apollonian triangulations was studied by {{harvtxt|Takeo|1960}}, who showed that they have the simple [[generating function]] {{math|''f''(''x'')}} described by the equation {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = 1 + ''x''(''f''(''x''))<sup>3</sup>}}.\nIn this generating function, the term of degree {{mvar|n}} counts the number of Apollonian networks with a fixed outer triangle and {{math|''n'' + 3}} vertices.\nThus, the numbers of Apollonian networks (with a fixed outer triangle) on 3, 4, 5, ... vertices are:\n:1, 1, 3, 12, 55, 273, 1428, 7752, 43263, 246675, ... {{OEIS|A001764}},\na sequence that also counts [[ternary tree]]s and dissections of convex polygons into odd-sided polygons.\nFor instance, there are 12 6-vertex Apollonian networks: three formed by subdividing the outer triangle once and then subdividing two of the resulting triangles,\nand nine formed by subdividing the outer triangle once, subdividing one of its triangles, and then subdividing one of the resulting smaller triangles.\n\n==History==\n{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|1930}} is an early paper that uses a dual form of Apollonian networks, the planar maps formed by repeatedly placing new regions at the vertices of simpler maps,  as a class of examples of planar maps with few colorings.\n\nGeometric structures closely related to Apollonian networks have been studied in [[polyhedral combinatorics]] since at least the early 1960s, when they were used by {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1963}} to describe graphs that can be realized as the graph of a polytope in only one way, without dimensional or combinatorial ambiguities, and by {{harvtxt|Moon|Moser|1963}} to find [[simplicial polytope]]s with no long paths. In [[graph theory]], the close connection between planarity and treewidth goes back to {{harvtxt|Robertson|Seymour|1984}}, who showed that every minor-closed family of graphs either has bounded treewidth or contains all of the planar graphs. Planar 3-trees, as a class of graphs, were explicitly considered by {{harvtxt|Hakimi|Schmeichel|1979}}, {{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}}, {{harvtxt|Patil|1986}}, and many authors since them.\n\nThe name \"Apollonian network\" was given by {{harvtxt|Andrade|Herrmann|Andrade|da Silva|2005}} to the networks they studied in which the level of subdivision of triangles is uniform across the network; these networks correspond geometrically to a type of stacked polyhedron called a [[Kleetope]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1963}}; {{harvtxt|Grünbaum|1967}}.</ref> Other authors applied the same name more broadly to planar 3-trees in their work generalizing the model of Andrade et al. to random Apollonian networks.<ref name=\"ran\"/> The triangulations generated in this way have also been named \"stacked triangulations\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Alon|Caro|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Zickfeld|Ziegler|2006}}; {{harvtxt|Badent|Binucci|Di Giacomo|Didimo|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Felsner|Zickfeld|2008}}.</ref> or \"stack-triangulations\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Albenque|Marckert|2008}}; {{harvtxt|Bernardi|Bonichon|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Jiménez|Kiwi|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Barycentric subdivision]], a different method of subdividing triangles into smaller triangles\n*[[Loop subdivision surface]], yet another method of subdividing triangles into smaller triangles\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Albenque | first1 = Marie\n | last2 = Marckert | first2 = Jean-François\n | arxiv = 0712.0593\n | journal = Electronic Journal of Probability\n | mr = 2438817\n | pages = 1624–1671\n | title = Some families of increasing planar maps\n | url = http://www.math.washington.edu/~ejpecp/viewarticle.php?id=1863&layout=abstract\n | volume = 13\n | year = 2008\n | doi=10.1214/ejp.v13-563}}\n*{{citation\n | last = Almering | first = J.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_subdivision",
      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''barycentric subdivision''' is a standard way of dividing an arbitrary [[Convex polygon|convex]] [[polygon]] into [[triangles]], a convex [[polyhedron]] into [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]], or, in general, a convex [[polytope]] into [[simplex|simplices]] with the same [[dimension]], by connecting the [[centroid|barycenter]]s of their [[face (geometry)|faces]] in a specific way.\n\nThe name is also used in [[topology]] for a similar operation on [[cell complex]]es.  The result is [[homeomorphism|topologically equivalent]] to that of the geometric operation, but the parts have arbitrary shape and size. This is an example of a [[finite subdivision rule]].\n\nBoth operations have a number of applications in [[mathematics]] and in [[geometric modeling]], especially whenever some [[function (mathematics)|function]] or shape needs to be approximated [[piecewise (mathematics)|piecewise]], e.g. by a [[spline (mathematics)|spline]].\n\n==Barycentric subdivision of a simplex==\n[[File:Barycentric 2.svg|thumb|250px|Barycentric subdivision of the 2-simplex or triangle]]\n\nThe barycentric subdivision (henceforth ''BCS'') of an <math>n</math>-dimensional [[simplex]] <math>S</math> consists of [[factorial|(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)!]] <math>n</math>-dimensional simplices.  Each piece, with vertices <math>v_0,v_1,\\dots,v_n</math>, can be associated with a [[permutation]] <math>p_0,p_1,\\dots,p_n</math> of the vertices of <math>S</math>, in such a way that each vertex <math>v_i</math> is the [[centroid|barycenter]] of the points <math>p_0,p_1,\\dots,p_i</math>.\n\n[[File:Barycentric_subdivision.svg|thumb|250px|4 stages of barycentric subdivision]]\n\nIn particular, the BCS of a single point (a 0-dimensional simplex) consists of that point itself.  The BCS of a line segment (1-simplex) <math>S</math> consists of two smaller segments, each connecting one endpoint (0-dimensional face) of <math>S</math> to the midpoint of <math>S</math> itself (1-dimensional face).\n\nThe BCS of a triangle <math>S</math> divides it into six triangles; each part has one vertex <math>v_2</math> at the barycenter of <math>S</math>, another one <math>v_1</math> at the midpoint of some side, and the last one <math>v_0</math> at one of the original vertices.\n\nThe BCS of a tetrahedron <math>S</math> divides it into 24 tetrahedra; each part has one vertex at the center of <math>S</math>, one on some face, one along some edge, and the last one at some vertex of <math>S</math>.\n\nAn important feature of BCS is the fact that the maximal diameter of an <math>n</math>-dimensional simplex shrinks at least by the factor <math>\\frac n{n+1}</math>.<ref name=\"Munkres\" />\n\n==Barycentric subdivision of a convex polytope==\nAnother way of defining the BCS of a simplex <math>S</math> is to associate each part to a sequence <math>F_0,F_1,\\dots,F_n</math> of [[face (geometry)|faces]] of <math>S</math>, with increasing dimensions, such that <math>F_i</math> is a [[facet (geometry)|facet]] of <math>F_{i+1}</math>, for <math>i</math> from 0 to <math>n-1</math>. Then each vertex <math>v_i</math> of the corresponding piece is the barycenter of face <math>F_i</math>.\n\nThis alternative definition can be extended to the BCS of an arbitrary <math>n</math>-dimensional convex polytope into a number of <math>n</math>-simplices.  Thus the BCS of a [[pentagon]] <math>P</math>, for example, has 10 triangles: each triangle is associated to three elements <math>F_0,F_1,F_2</math> of <math>P</math> &mdash; respectively, a corner of <math>P</math>, a side of <math>P</math> incident to that corner, and <math>P</math> itself. \n\nSimilarly the BCS of a [[cube]] consists of 48 tetrahedra, each of them associated to a sequence <math>F_0,F_1,F_2,F_3</math> of nested elements &mdash; a vertex, an edge, a face, and the whole cube. Note that there are 8 choices for <math>F_0</math>, 3 for <math>F_1</math> (given <math>F_0</math>), and 2 for <math>F_2</math> (given <math>F_0,F_1</math>).\n\n==Barycentric subdivision in topology==\nBarycentric subdivision is an important tool in [[simplicial homology]] theory, where it is used as a means of obtaining finer simplicial complexes (containing the original ones, i.e. with more simplices). This in turn is crucial to the [[simplicial approximation theorem]], which roughly states that one can approximate any continuous function between polyhedra by a (finite) [[simplicial map]], given a sufficient amount of subdivision of the respective simplicial complexes whom they realize. Ultimately, this approximation technique is a standard ingredient in the proof that [[simplicial homology|simplicial homology groups]] are topological invariants.<ref name=\"Munkres\">Munkres, James R.: ''Elements of Algebraic Topology''</ref><ref>Giblin, P.J.: ''Graphs, Surfaces and Homology''</ref>\n\nA generalization of barycentric subdivision can also be defined for a [[cell complex]]. Informally, such an object can be thought of as an assemblage of one or more chunks of rubber (''cells''), each shaped like a convex polytope, which are glued to each other by their facets &mdash; possibly with much stretching and twisting.\n\nThe topological version of BCS replaces each cell by an assemblage of rubber simplices, likewise glued together by their facets and possibly deformed. The procedure is (1) select for each cell a [[homeomorphism|deformation map]] that converts it into a geometric convex polytope, preserving its incidence and topological connections; (2) perform the geometric BCS on this polytope; and, then (3) map the resulting subdivision back to the original cells.\n\nThe result of barycentric subdivision, when viewed as an [[abstract simplicial complex]], is an example of a [[flag complex]]. It has one vertex for every cell of the original cell complex and one maximal-dimensional cell for every ''flag'' (a collection of cells of different dimensions, all related to each other by inclusion) of the original cell complex.\n\n==Applications==\nThe barycentric subdivision is chiefly used to replace an arbitrarily complicated convex polytope or topological cell complex by an assemblage of pieces, all of them of bounded complexity ([[simplex|simplices]], in fact).  A typical application is [[geometric modeling|modeling]] the shape of a [[automobile|car]] body by a [[spline (mathematics)|spline]] &mdash; a [[piecewise (mathematics)|piecewise-defined]] [[polynomial]] [[function (mathematics)|function]].  The algebra of such functions becomes much simpler and easier to program if each \"piece\" is a \"topological triangle\", i.e. is attached to exactly three other pieces.  However, a human user may find it more natural to design the shape by joining patches with more liberal shapes and topologies.  Barycentric subdivision is a convenient way to convert that \"user-friendly\" model into a \"computer-friendly\" one.\n\n==Repeated barycentric subdivision==\nWhen approximating a mathematical function or a surface by a spline, the accuracy of the approximation is usually determined by the piece size &mdash; the bigger the pieces, the larger the error. Thus it is often necessary to split large pieces into smaller ones, in order to achieve a prescribed accuracy.  \n\nIn theory, BCS could be used for that purpose, since it has the property that the longest edge of any piece is smaller than the longest edge of the original polytope by a  factor less than <math>n/(n + 1)</math>.  Therefore, by applying BCS sufficiently many times, the largest edge can be made as small as desired.\n\nHowever, in practice BCS is not well-suited for that purpose.  For one thing, each application after the first one multiplies the number of simplices by <math>(n+1)!</math>. BCS also multiplies the [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] of each original vertex by <math>n!</math>, and the degree of each edge by <math>(n-1)!</math>. Moreover, the BCS will split all simplices, even those that are already small enough. Finally, each BCS stage also makes the simplices not only smaller but \"skinnier\", i.e. it tends to increase their ''aspect ratio'' (the ratio between the longest and shortest edge).  For all these reasons, in practice one rarely applies more than one round of BCS, and other subdivision schemes are used instead.\n\n==Relative barycentric subdivision==\nFor simplicial complexes <math>L\\subset K</math> one defines the relative barycentric subdivision <math>K^*</math> of <math>K</math> ''modulo'' <math>L</math> that consists of those simplexes with vertices <math>v_0\\dots v_kB(S'_1)\\dots B(S'_l)</math> associated to a sequence <math>S_0 < \\cdots < S_k</math> of proper faces of <math>L</math> and barycenters <math>B(S'_i)</math> of simplexes in <math>K\\setminus L</math>.\n\nClearly, <math>L</math> remains a subcomplex of <math>K^*</math>. Only the simplexes away from <math>L</math> shrink.\n\n==Related notions==\n===False barycentric subdivision===\nSometimes the term \"barycentric subdivision\" is improperly used for any subdivision of a polytope <math>P</math> into simplices that have one vertex at the centroid of <math>P</math>, and the opposite facet on the boundary of <math>P</math>. While this property holds for the true barycentric subdivision, it also holds for other subdivisions which are not the BCS. \n\nFor example, if one makes a straight cut from the barycenter of a triangle to each of its three corners, one obtains a subdivision into three triangles. Generalizing this idea, one obtains a schema for subdividing an <math>n</math>-dimensional simplex into <math>n+1</math> simplices. However, this subdivision is not the BCS.\n\n===Simplicial sets===\nThe barycentric division can also be defined for [[simplicial set]]s, in a way that is compatible (with respect to the topological realization functor) with the above division of simplices.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Goerss | first1=P.

The algorithm can be also used to obtain a [[Voronoi diagram]] of the points, which is the [[dual graph]] of the Delaunay triangulation.\n\n==Description==\nThe Bowyer–Watson algorithm is an [[incremental algorithm]]. It works by adding points, one at a time, to a valid Delaunay triangulation of a subset of the desired points. After every insertion, any triangles whose circumcircles contain the new point are deleted, leaving a [[star-shaped polygon]]al hole which is then re-triangulated using the new point. By using the connectivity of the triangulation to efficiently locate triangles to remove, the algorithm can take ''O(N log N)'' operations to triangulate N points, although special degenerate cases exist where this goes up to ''O(N<sup>2</sup>)''.<ref>Rebay, S.

Efficiency can be improved in a number of ways. For example, the triangle connectivity can be used to locate the triangles which contain the new point in their circumcircle, without having to check all of the triangles. Pre-computing the circumcircles can save time at the expense of additional memory usage. And if the points are uniformly distributed, sorting them along a space filling [[Hilbert curve]] prior to insertion can also speed point location.<ref>Liu, Yuanxin, and Jack Snoeyink. \"A comparison of five implementations of 3D Delaunay tessellation.\" Combinatorial and Computational Geometry 52 (2005): 439-458.</ref>\n\n  <syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\">\n   function BowyerWatson (pointList)\n      // pointList is a set of coordinates defining the points to be triangulated\n      triangulation := empty triangle mesh data structure\n      add super-triangle to triangulation // must be large enough to completely contain all the points in pointList\n      for each point in pointList do // add all the points one at a time to the triangulation\n         badTriangles := empty set\n         for each triangle in triangulation do // first find all the triangles that are no longer valid due to the insertion\n            if point is inside circumcircle of triangle\n               add triangle to badTriangles\n         polygon := empty set\n         for each triangle in badTriangles do // find the boundary of the polygonal hole\n            for each edge in triangle do\n               if edge is not shared by any other triangles in badTriangles\n                  add edge to polygon\n         for each triangle in badTriangles do // remove them from the data structure\n            remove triangle from triangulation\n         for each edge in polygon do // re-triangulate the polygonal hole\n            newTri := form a triangle from edge to point\n            add newTri to triangulation\n      for each triangle in triangulation // done inserting points, now clean up\n         if triangle contains a vertex from original super-triangle\n            remove triangle from triangulation\n      return triangulation \n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://github.com/jmespadero/pyDelaunay2D pyDelaunay2D] : A didactic [[Python (programming language)|Python]] implementation of Bowyer–Watson algorithm.\n* [https://github.com/Bl4ckb0ne/delaunay-triangulation Bl4ckb0ne/delaunay-triangulation] : [[C++ (programming language)|C++]] implementation of Bowyer–Watson algorithm.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Cite journal | last1 = Bowyer | first1 = Adrian |author1-link=Adrian Bowyer| title = Computing Dirichlet tessellations | doi = 10.1093/comjnl/24.2.162 | journal = [[The Computer Journal|Comput.

Done naïvely, this will take O(''n'') time: we search through all the triangles to find the one that contains ''v'', then we potentially flip away every triangle.  Then the overall runtime is O(''n''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nIf we insert vertices in random order, it turns out (by a somewhat intricate proof) that each insertion will flip, on average, only O(1) triangles – although sometimes it will flip many more.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last1 = Guibas\n  | first1 = Leonidas J.\n  | authorlink1 = Leonidas J.

We can store the history of the splits and flips performed: each triangle stores a pointer to the two or three triangles that replaced it.  To find the triangle that contains ''v'', we start at a root triangle, and follow the pointer that points to a triangle that contains ''v'', until we find a triangle that has not yet been replaced.  On average, this will also take O(log ''n'') time.

The sweep-hull is created sequentially by iterating a radially-sorted set of 2D points, and connecting triangles to the visible part of the convex hull, which gives a non-overlapping triangulation. One can build a convex hull in this manner so long as the order of points guarantees no point would fall within the triangle. But, radially sorting should minimize flipping by being highly Delaunay to start. This is then paired with a final iterative triangle flipping step.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]] of a set of points is a subset of the Delaunay triangulation of the same points, and this can be exploited to compute it efficiently.\n\nFor modelling terrain or other objects given a set of sample points, the Delaunay triangulation gives a nice set of triangles to use as polygons in the model.  In particular, the Delaunay triangulation avoids narrow triangles (as they have large circumcircles compared to their area). See [[triangulated irregular network]].\n\nDelaunay triangulations can be used to determine the density or intensity of points samplings by means of the [[Delaunay tessellation field estimator|Delaunay tessellation field estimator (DTFE)]].\n\n[[File:Delaunay Triangulation (100 Points).svg|right|thumb|250px|The Delaunay triangulation of a random set of 100 points in a plane.]]\nDelaunay triangulations are often used to build meshes for space-discretised solvers such as the [[finite element method]] and the [[finite volume method]] of physics simulation, because of the angle guarantee and because fast triangulation algorithms have been developed.  Typically, the domain to be meshed is specified as a coarse [[simplicial complex]]; for the mesh to be numerically stable, it must be refined, for instance by using [[Ruppert's algorithm]].\n\nThe increasing popularity of [[finite element method]] and [[boundary element method]] techniques increases the incentive to improve automatic meshing algorithms. However, all of these algorithms can create distorted and even unusable grid elements. Fortunately, several techniques exist which can take an existing mesh and improve its quality. For example, smoothing (also referred to as mesh refinement) is one such method, which repositions nodal locations so as to minimize element distortion. The [[stretched grid method]] allows the generation of pseudo-regular meshes that meet the Delaunay criteria easily and quickly in a one-step solution.\n\n[[Constrained Delaunay triangulation]] has found applications in path planning in automated driving <ref>{{cite conference \n| url = https://wiki.epfl.ch/edicpublic/documents/Candidacy%20exam/anderson-contrained_based_planning_and_control.pdf\n| title = Constraint-based planning and control for safe, semi-autonomous operation of vehicles\n| author1 = Sterling J Anderson\n| author2 =  Sisir B.

Surprisingly, the algorithm does not need any preprocessing or complex data structures except some simple representation of the triangulation itself. The predecessor of Jump-and-Walk was due to Lawson (1977) and Green and Sibson (1978), which picks a random starting point S and then walks from S toward the query point Q one triangle at a time. But no theoretical analysis was known for these predecessors until after mid-1990s.\n\nJump-and-Walk picks a small group of sample points and starts the walk from the sample point which is the closest to Q until the simplex containing Q is found. The algorithm was a folklore in practice for some time, and the formal presentation of the algorithm and the analysis of its performance on 2D random Delaunay triangulation was done by Devroye, Mucke and Zhu in mid-1990s (the paper appeared in Algorithmica, 1998). The analysis on 3D random Delaunay triangulation was done by Mucke, Saias and Zhu (ACM Symposium of Computational Geometry, 1996). In both cases, a boundary condition was assumed, namely, Q must be slightly away from the boundary of the convex domain where the vertices of the random Delaunay triangulation are drawn. In 2004, Devroye, Lemaire and Moreau showed that in 2D the boundary condition can be withdrawn (the paper appeared in Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications, 2004).\n\nJump-and-Walk has been used in many famous software packages, e.g., QHULL, Triangle and CGAL.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Green | first1 = P.

      "text": "[[File:Convex Polygon triangulations.svg|thumb|300px|Three possible triangulations of the same polygon. Central triangulation has less weight (sum of perimeters).]]\n\nIn [[computational geometry]] and [[computer science]], the '''minimum-weight triangulation''' problem is the problem of finding a [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of minimal total edge length.<ref>For surveys of the problem, see {{harvtxt|Xu|1998}}, {{harvtxt|Levcopoulos|2008}}, and {{harvtxt|De Loera|Rambau|Santos|2010}}.</ref> That is, an input polygon or the [[convex hull]] of an input point set must be subdivided into triangles that meet edge-to-edge and vertex-to-vertex, in such a way as to minimize the sum of the perimeters of the triangles. The problem is [[NP-hard]] for point set inputs, but may be approximated to any desired degree of accuracy. For polygon inputs, it may be solved exactly in polynomial time. The minimum weight triangulation has also sometimes been called the '''optimal triangulation'''.\n\n==History==\nThe problem of minimum weight triangulation of a point set was posed by {{harvtxt|Düppe|Gottschalk|1970}}, who suggested its application to the construction of [[triangulated irregular network]] models of land countours, and used a [[greedy heuristic]] to approximate it.  {{harvtxt|Shamos|Hoey|1975}} conjectured that the minimum weight triangulation always coincided with the [[Delaunay triangulation]], but this was quickly disproved by {{harvtxt|Lloyd|1977}}, and indeed {{harvtxt|Kirkpatrick|1980}} showed that the weights of the two triangulations can differ by a linear factor.<ref>See also {{harvtxt|Manacher|Zobrist|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe minimum-weight triangulation problem became notorious when {{harvtxt|Garey|Johnson|1979}} included it in a list of open problems in their book on [[NP-completeness]], and many subsequent authors published partial results on it. Finally, {{harvtxt|Mulzer|Rote|2008}} showed it to be NP-hard, and {{harvtxt|Remy|Steger|2009}} showed that accurate approximations to it can be constructed efficiently.\n\n==Complexity==\nThe weight of a triangulation of a set of points in the [[Euclidean plane]] is defined as the sum of lengths of its edges.  Its [[decision variant]] is the problem of deciding whether there exists a triangulation of weight less than a given weight; it was proven to be [[NP-hard]] by {{harvtxt|Mulzer|Rote|2008}}. Their proof is by [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] from PLANAR-1-IN-3-SAT, a special case of the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] in which a [[3-CNF]] whose graph is [[planar graph|planar]] is accepted when it has a truth assignment that satisfies exactly [[One-in-three 3SAT|one literal in each clause]]. The proof uses complex [[Gadget (computer science)|gadgets]], and involves [[Computer-assisted proof|computer assistance]] to verify the correct behavior of these gadgets.\n\nIt is not known whether the minimum-weight triangulation decision problem is [[NP-complete]], since this depends on the known open problem whether the [[sum of radicals]] may be computed in polynomial time. However, Mulzer and Rote remark that the problem is NP-complete if the edge weights are rounded to integer values.\n\nAlthough NP-hard, the minimum weight triangulation may be constructed in subexponential time by a [[dynamic programming]] algorithm that considers all possible [[planar separator theorem|simple cycle separators]] of <math>O(\\sqrt n)</math> points within the triangulation, recursively finds the optimal triangulation on each side of the cycle, and chooses the cycle separator leading to the smallest total weight. The total time for this method is <math>2^{O(\\sqrt n\\log n)}</math>.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lingas|1998}}.</ref>\n\n==Approximation==\nSeveral authors have proven results relating the minimum weight triangulation to other triangulations in terms of the [[approximation ratio]], the worst-case ratio of the total edge length of the alternative triangulation to the total length of the minimum weight triangulation. In this vein, it is known that the [[Delaunay triangulation]] has an approximation ratio of <math>\\Theta(n)</math>,<ref>{{harvtxt|Kirkpatrick|1980}}. A weaker bound was given by {{harvtxt|Manacher|Zobrist|1979}}.</ref> and that the [[greedy triangulation]] (the triangulation formed by adding edges in order from shortest to longest, at each step including an edge whenever it does not cross an earlier edge) has an approximation ratio of <math>\\Theta(\\sqrt n)</math>.<ref>A family of examples proving that the approximation ratio is <math>\\Omega(\\sqrt n)</math> was given by {{harvtxt|Levcopoulos|1987}}, and the matching upper bound is by {{harvtxt|Levcopoulos|Krznaric|1998}}. As with the approximation ratio for Delaunay triangulation, a weaker bound was also given by {{harvtxt|Manacher|Zobrist|1979}}.</ref> Nevertheless, for randomly distributed point sets, both the Delaunay and greedy triangulations are within a logarithmic factor of the minimum weight.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lingas|1986}}.</ref>\n\nThe hardness result of Mulzer and Rote also implies the NP-hardness of finding an approximate solution with relative approximation error at most O(1/n<sup>2</sup>). Thus, a [[fully polynomial approximation scheme]] for minimum weight triangulation is unlikely. However, a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme is possible: for any constant &epsilon;&nbsp;>&nbsp;0, a solution with approximation ratio 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;&epsilon; can be found in [[quasi-polynomial time]] exp(O((log&nbsp;''n'')<sup>9</sup>).<ref>{{harvtxt|Remy|Steger|2009}}. For earlier results on polynomial-time approximation algorithms, see {{harvtxt|Plaisted|Hong|1987}} (log-factor approximation) and {{harvtxt|Levcopoulos|Krznaric|1998}} (constant-factor approximation).</ref>\n\n==Heuristics==\nBecause of the difficulty of finding the exact solutions of the minimum-weight triangulation, many authors have studied heuristics that may in some cases find the solution although they cannot be proven to work in all cases. In particular, much of this research has focused on the problem of finding sets of edges that are guaranteed to belong to the minimum-weight triangulation. If a subgraph of the minimum-weight triangulation found in this way turns out to be connected, then the remaining untriangulated space may be viewed as forming a simple polygon, and the entire triangulation may be found by using [[dynamic programming]] to find the optimal triangulation of this polygonal space. The same dynamic programming approach can also be extended to the case that the subgraph has a bounded number of connected components<ref>{{harvtxt|Cheng|Golin|Tsang|1995}}.</ref> and the same approach of finding a connected graph and then applying dynamic programming to fill in the polygonal gaps surrounding the graph edges has also been used as part of heuristics for finding low-weight but not minimum-weight triangulations.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lingas|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Heath|Pemmaraju|1994}}.</ref>\n\nThe graph formed by connecting two points whenever they are each other's nearest neighbors is necessarily a subgraph of the minimum-weight triangulation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Yang|Xu|You|1994}}.</ref> However, this mutual nearest neighbor graph is a [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]], and hence is never connected. A related line of research finds large subgraphs of the minimum-weight triangulation by using circle-based [[Beta skeleton|''β''-skeletons]], the geometric graphs formed by including an edge between two points ''u'' and ''v'' whenever there does not exist a third point ''w'' forming an angle ''uwv'' greater than some parameter &theta;. It has been shown that, for sufficiently small values of &theta;, the graph formed in this way is a subgraph of the minimum-weight triangulation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Keil|1994}}; {{harvtxt|Cheng|Golin|Tsang|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Cheng|Xu|2001}}; {{harvtxt|Hu|2010}}.</ref> However, the choice of &theta; needed to ensure this is smaller than the angle &theta;&nbsp;=&nbsp;90ª for which the ''β''-skeleton is always connected.\n\nA more sophisticated technique called the LMT-skeleton was proposed by {{harvtxt|Dickerson|Montague|1996}}. It is formed by an iterative process, in which two sets of edges are maintained, a set of edges known to belong to the minimum-weight triangulation and a set of edges that are candidates to belong to it. Initially, the set of known edges is initialized to the [[convex hull]] of the input, and all remaining pairs of vertices form candidate edges. Then, in each iteration of the construction process, candidate edges are removed whenever there is no pair of triangles formed by the remaining edges forming a quadrilateral for which the candidate edge is the shortest diagonal, and candidate edges are moved to the set of known edges when there is no other candidate edge that crosses them. The LMT-skeleton is defined to be the set of known edges produced after this process stops making any more changes. It is guaranteed to be a subgraph of the minimum-weight triangulation, can be constructed efficiently, and in experiments on sets of up to 200 points it was frequently connected.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dickerson|Montague|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Cheng|Katoh|Sugai|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Beirouti|Snoeyink|1998}}; {{harvtxt|Aichholzer|Aurenhammer|Hainz|1999}}.</ref> However it has been shown that on the average for large point sets it has a linear number of connected components.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bose|Devroye|Evans|1996}}.</ref>\n\nOther heuristics that have been applied to the minimum weight triangulation problem include [[genetic algorithm]]s<ref>{{harvtxt|Qin|Wang|Gong|1997}}; {{harvtxt|Capp|Julstrom|1998}}.</ref> [[branch and bound]],<ref>{{harvtxt|Kyoda|Imai|Takeuchi|Tajima|1997}}.</ref> and [[ant colony optimization algorithms]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Jahani|Bigham|Askari|2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nA [[polygon triangulation]] of minimal weight may be constructed in cubic time using the [[dynamic programming]] approach, reported independently by {{harvtxt|Gilbert|1979}} and {{harvtxt|Klincsek|1980}}. In this method, the vertices are numbered consecutively around the boundary of the polygon, and for each diagonal from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' that lies within the polygon, the optimal triangulation is calculated by considering all possible triangles ''ijk'' within the polygon, adding the weights of the optimal triangulations below the diagonals ''ik'' and ''jk'', and choosing the vertex ''k'' that leads to the minimum total weight. That is, if MWT(''i'',''j'') denotes the weight of the minimum-weight triangulation of the polygon below edge ''ij'', then the overall algorithm performs the following steps:\n*For each possible value of ''i'', from ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 down to 1, do:\n**For each possible value of ''j'', from ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 to ''n'', do:\n***If ''ij'' is an edge of the polygon, set MWT(''i'',''j'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;length(''ij'')\n***Else if ''ij'' is not an interior diagonal of the polygon, set MWT(''i'',''j'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;+∞\n***Else set MWT(''i'',''j'') = length(''ij'') + min<sub>''i'' < ''k'' < ''j''</sub> MWT(''i'',''k'') + MWT(''k,j'')\nAfter this iteration completes, MWT(1,''n'') will store the total weight of the minimum weight triangulation. The triangulation itself may be obtained by recursively searching through this array, starting from MWT(1,''n''), at each step choosing the triangle ''ijk'' that leads to the minimum value for MWT(''i'',''j'') and recursively searching MWT(''i'',''k'') and MWT(''j'',''k'').\n\nSimilar dynamic programming methods may also be adapted to point set inputs where all but a constant number of points lie on the [[convex hull]] of the input,<ref>{{harvtxt|Hoffmann|Okamoto|2004}}; {{harvtxt|Grantson|Borgelt|Levcopoulos|2005}}; {{harvtxt|Knauer|Spillner|2006}}.</ref> and to point sets that lie on a constant number of nested convex polygons or on a constant number of lines no two of which cross within the convex hull.<ref>{{harvtxt|Anagnostou|Corneil|1993}}; {{harvtxt|Meijer|Rappaport|1992}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also possible to formulate a version of the point set or polygon triangulation problems in which one is allowed to add [[Steiner point (computational geometry)|Steiner points]], extra vertices, in order to reduce the total edge length of the resulting triangulations. In some cases, the resulting triangulation may be shorter than the minimum weight triangulation by as much as a linear factor. It is possible to approximate the minimum weight Steiner triangulation of a point set to within a constant factor of optimal, but the constant factor in the approximation is large.<ref>{{harvtxt|Eppstein|1994}}.</ref>\n\nRelated problems that have also been studied include the construction of minimum-weight [[pseudotriangulation]]s<ref>{{harvtxt|Gudmundsson|Levcopoulos|2007}}; {{harvtxt|Aichholzer|Aurenhammer|Hackl|Speckmann|2009}}.</ref> and the characterization of the graphs of minimum-weight triangulations.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lenhart|Liotta|2002}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Aichholzer | first1 = Oswin\n | last2 = Aurenhammer | first2 = Franz | author2-link = Franz Aurenhammer\n | last3 = Hackl | first3 = Thomas\n | last4 = Speckmann | first4 = Bettina | author4-link = Bettina Speckmann\n | doi = 10.1016/j.comgeo.2008.10.002\n | issue = 6-7\n | journal = [[Computational Geometry (journal)|Computational Geometry Theory and Applications]]\n | mr = 2519380\n | pages = 627–631\n | title = On minimum weight pseudo-triangulations\n | volume = 42\n | year = 2009}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Aichholzer | first1 = Oswin\n | last2 = Aurenhammer | first2 = Franz | author2-link = Franz Aurenhammer\n | last3 = Hainz | first3 = Reinhard\n | doi = 10.1016/S0020-0190(99)00018-6\n | issue = 5\n | journal = Information Processing Letters\n | pages = 215–219\n | title = New results on MWT subgraphs\n | volume = 69\n | year = 1999}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Anagnostou | first1 = Efthymios\n | last2 = Corneil | first2 = Derek | author2-link = Derek Corneil\n | doi = 10.1016/0925-7721(93)90016-Y\n | issue = 5\n | journal = [[Computational Geometry (journal)|Computational Geometry.

Every interior Delaunay edge (black) crosses the corresponding dual Voronoi edge (dashed blue), although the convex hull edges do not cross their duals. Right: A Delaunay triangulation that is not a Pitteway triangulation; the red interior Delaunay edge does not cross the corresponding red dashed Voronoi edge, and some points in the top triangle have the bottom vertex as their nearest neighbor.]]\nIn [[computational geometry]], a '''Pitteway triangulation''' is a [[point set triangulation]] in which the [[Nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] of any point ''p'' within the triangulation is one of the vertices of the triangle containing ''p''.\nAlternatively, it is a [[Delaunay triangulation]] in which each internal edge crosses its [[Dual graph|dual]] [[Voronoi diagram]] edge. Pitteway triangulations are named after Michael Pitteway, who studied them in 1973. Not every point set supports a Pitteway triangulation. When such a triangulation exists it is a special case of the [[Delaunay triangulation]], and consists of the union of the [[Gabriel graph]] and [[convex hull]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe concept of a Pitteway triangulation was introduced by {{harvtxt|Pitteway|1973}}. See also {{harvtxt|McLain|1976}}, who writes \"An optimal partition\nis one in which, for any point within any triangle, that point lies at least\nas close to one of the vertices of that triangle as to any other data point.\" The name \"Pitteway triangulation\" was given by {{harvtxt|Okabe|Boots|Chiu|Sugihara|2000}}.\n\n==Counterexamples==\n\n{{harvtxt|Gold|1978}} points out that not every point set supports a Pitteway triangulation. For instance, any triangulation of a [[regular pentagon]] includes a central [[isosceles triangle]] such that a point ''p'' near the midpoint of one of the triangle sides has its nearest neighbor outside the triangle.\n\n==Relation to other geometric graphs==\n\nWhen a Pitteway triangulation exists, the midpoint of each edge interior to the triangulation must have the two edge endpoints as its nearest neighbors, for any other neighbor would violate the Pitteway property for nearby points in one of the two adjacent triangles. Thus, a circle having that edge as diameter must be empty of vertices, so the Pitteway triangulation consists of the [[Gabriel graph]] together with the [[convex hull]] of the point set. Conversely, when the Gabriel graph and convex hull together form a triangulation, it is a Pitteway triangulation.\n\nSince all Gabriel graph and convex hull edges are part of the [[Delaunay triangulation]], a Pitteway triangulation, when it exists, is unique for points in [[general position]] and coincides with the Delaunay triangulation. However point sets with no Pitteway triangulation will still have a Delaunay triangulation.\n\nIn the Pitteway triangulation, each edge ''pq'' either belongs to the convex hull or crosses the edge of the [[Voronoi diagram]] that separates the cells containing ''p'' and ''q''. In some references this property is used to define a Pitteway triangulation, as a Delaunay triangulation in which all internal Delaunay edges cross their dual Voronoi edges. However, a Pitteway triangulation may include convex hull edges that do not cross their duals.<ref>{{harvtxt|Okabe|Boots|Chiu|Sugihara|2000}}; {{harvtxt|Dobrin|2005}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation\n | first = Adam\n | last = Dobrin\n | title = A Review of Properties and Variations of Voronoi Diagrams\n | year = 2005\n | publisher = Whitman College\n | url = http://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/SeniorProjectArchive/2005/dobrinat.pdf}}\n \n*{{citation\n | first = C.

In the plane, triangulations are special cases of [[planar straight-line graph|planar straight-line graphs]].\n\nA particularly interesting kind of triangulations are the [[Delaunay triangulation|Delaunay triangulations]].

An implementation that keeps separate lists of convex and concave vertices will run in ''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>) time. This method is known as ''ear clipping'' and sometimes ''ear trimming''.

Pointed pseudotriangulations were first considered by [[Ileana Streinu]] (2000, 2005) as part of her solution to the [[carpenter's ruler problem]], a proof that any [[simple polygonal path]] in the plane can be straightened out by a sequence of continuous motions.

However, subsequent work has settled on a broader definition that applies more generally to [[polygon]]s as well as to regions bounded by smooth curves, and that allows nonzero angles at the three vertices. In this broader definition, a pseudotriangle is a simply-connected region of the plane, having three convex vertices. The three boundary curves connecting these three vertices must be convex, in the sense that any line segment connecting two points on the same boundary curve must lie entirely outside or on the boundary of the pseudotriangle. Thus, the pseudotriangle is the region between the convex hulls of these three curves, and more generally any three mutually tangent convex sets form a pseudotriangle that lies between them.\n\nFor algorithmic applications it is of particular interest to characterize pseudotriangles that are polygons. In a polygon, a vertex is ''convex'' if it spans an interior angle of less than π, and ''concave'' otherwise (in particular, we consider an angle of exactly π to be concave). Any polygon must have at least three convex angles, because the total exterior angle of a polygon is 2π, the convex angles contribute less than π each to this total, and the concave angles contribute zero or negative amounts. A polygonal pseudotriangle is a polygon that has exactly three convex vertices. In particular, any [[triangle]], and any nonconvex [[quadrilateral]], is a pseudotriangle.\n\nThe [[convex hull]] of any pseudotriangle is a triangle. The curves along the pseudotriangle boundary between each pair of convex vertices either lie within the triangle or coincide with one of its edges.\n\n== Pseudotriangulations ==\n\nA '''pseudotriangulation''' is a partition of a region of the plane into pseudotriangles. Any [[Triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of a region of the plane is a pseudotriangulation. While any two triangulations of the same region must have the same numbers of edges and triangles, the same is not true of pseudotriangulations; for instance, if the region is itself an ''n''-vertex polygonal pseudotriangle, then a pseudotriangulation of it may have as few as one pseudotriangle and ''n'' edges, or as many as ''n'' − 2 pseudotriangles and 2''n'' − 3 edges.\n\nA ''minimal pseudotriangulation'' is a pseudotriangulation ''T'' such that no subgraph of ''T'' is a pseudotriangulation covering the same convex region of the plane. A minimal pseudotriangulation with ''n'' vertices must have at least 2''n'' − 3 edges; if it has exactly 2''n'' − 3 edges, it must be a pointed pseudotriangulation, but there exist minimal pseudotriangulations with 3''n'' − O(1) edges.<ref>Rote, Wang, Wang, and Xu (2003), Theorem 4 and Figure 4.</ref>\n\nAgarwal et al. (2002) describe data structures for maintaining pseudotriangulations of moving points or moving polygons. They show that using pseudotriangulations in place of triangulations allows their algorithms to maintain these structures with relatively few combinatorial changes as the inputs move, and they use these dynamic pseudotriangulations to perform collision detection among the moving objects.\n\nGudmundsson et al. (2004) consider the problem of finding a pseudotriangulation of a point set or polygon with minimum total edge length, and provide approximation algorithms for this problem.\n\n== Pointed pseudotriangulations ==\n\n[[File:Convex shelling.svg|thumb|300px|A shelling sequence of a planar point set and the pointed pseudotriangulation derived from this sequence.]]\nA '''pointed pseudotriangulation''' can be defined as a finite non-crossing collection of line segments, such that at each vertex the incident line segments span an angle of at most π, and such that no line segments can be added between any two existing vertices while preserving this property. It is not hard to see that a pointed pseudotriangulation is a pseudotriangulation of its convex hull: all convex hull edges may be added while preserving the angle-spanning property, and all interior faces must be pseudotriangles else a [[bitangent]] line segment could be added between two vertices of the face.\n\nA pointed pseudotriangulation with ''v'' vertices must have exactly 2''v'' − 3 edges.<ref>First shown by Streinu (2000), but the argument we give here is from Haas et al. (2005), Lemma 5.</ref> This follows by a simple [[Double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] argument involving the [[Euler characteristic]]: as each face but the outer one is a pseudotriangle, with three convex angles, the pseudotriangulation must have 3''f'' − 3 convex angles between adjacent edges. Each edge is the clockwise edge for two angles, so there are a total of 2''e'' angles, of which all but ''v'' are convex. Thus, 3''f'' − 3 = 2''e'' − ''v''. Combining this with the Euler equation ''f'' − ''e'' + ''v'' = 2 and solving the resulting [[simultaneous linear equations]] gives ''e'' = 2''v'' − 3. The same argument also shows that ''f'' = ''v'' − 1 (including the convex hull as one of the faces), so the pseudotriangulation must have exactly ''v'' − 2 pseudotriangles.\n\nSimilarly, since any ''k''-vertex subgraph of a pointed pseudotriangulation can be completed to form a pointed pseudotriangulation of its vertices, the subgraph must have at most 2''k'' − 3 edges. Thus, pointed pseudotriangulations satisfy the conditions defining [[Laman graph]]s: they have exactly 2''v'' − 3 edges, and their ''k''-vertex subgraphs have at most 2''k'' − 3 edges. Laman graphs, and therefore also pointed pseudotriangulations, are [[minimally rigid graph]]s in two dimensions. Every planar Laman graph can be drawn as a pointed pseudotriangulation, although not every planar drawing of a planar Laman graph is a pseudotriangulation.<ref>Haas et al. (2005).</ref>\n\nAnother way of finding a pointed pseudotriangulation is to ''shell'' a point set; that is, to remove convex hull vertices one by one until all points have been removed. The family of sequences of removals that can be formed in this way is the [[antimatroid|shelling antimatroid]] of the point set, and the set of edges of convex hulls of the sequence of point sets formed by this removal process forms a pseudotriangulation.<ref name=\"Har-Peled 2002\"/> However, not all pointed pseudotriangulations can be formed in this way.\n\nAichholzer et al. (2004) show that a set of ''n'' points, ''h'' of which belong to the [[convex hull]] of the set, must have at least ''C''<sub>''h''−2</sub>&times;3<sup>''n''−''h''</sup> different pointed pseudotriangulations, where ''C<sub>i</sub>'' denotes the ''i''th [[Catalan number]]. As a consequence, they show that the point sets with the fewest pointed pseudotriangulations are the vertex sets of convex polygons. Aichholzer et al. (2006) investigate point sets with large numbers of pointed pseudotriangulations. Computational geometry researchers have also provided algorithms for listing all pointed pseudotriangulations of a point set in a small amount of time per pseudotriangulation.<ref>Bereg (2005); Brönnimann et al.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex",
      "text": "[[File:Simplicial complex example.svg|thumb|200px|A simplicial 3-complex.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''simplicial complex''' is a set composed of [[Point (geometry)|point]]s, [[line segment]]s, [[triangle]]s, and their [[Simplex|''n''-dimensional counterparts]] (see illustration).  Simplicial complexes should not be confused with the more abstract notion of a [[simplicial set]] appearing in modern simplicial [[homotopy theory]].  The purely combinatorial counterpart to a simplicial complex is an [[abstract simplicial complex]].\n\n==Definitions==\nA '''simplicial complex''' <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> is a set of [[Simplex|simplices]] that satisfies the following conditions:\n:1. Every [[Simplex#Elements|face]] of a simplex from <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> is also in <math>\\mathcal{K}</math>.\n:2. The non-empty [[Set intersection|intersection]] of any two simplices <math>\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\in \\mathcal{K}</math> is a face of both <math>\\sigma_1</math> and <math>\\sigma_2</math>.\n\nSee also the definition of an [[abstract simplicial complex]], which loosely speaking is a simplicial complex without an associated geometry.\n\nA '''simplicial ''k''-complex''' <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> is a simplicial complex where the largest dimension of any simplex in <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> equals ''k''.  For instance, a simplicial 2-complex must contain at least one triangle, and must not contain any tetrahedra or higher-dimensional simplices.\n\nA '''pure''' or '''homogeneous''' simplicial ''k''-complex <math>\\mathcal{K}</math> is a simplicial complex where every simplex of dimension less than ''k'' is a face of some simplex <math>\\sigma \\in \\mathcal{K}</math> of dimension exactly ''k''.  Informally, a pure 1-complex \"looks\" like it's made of a bunch of lines, a 2-complex \"looks\" like it's made of a bunch of triangles, etc.  An example of a ''non''-homogeneous complex is a triangle with a line segment attached to one of its vertices.\n\nA '''facet''' is any simplex in a complex that is ''not'' a face of any larger simplex. (Note the difference from a \"face\" of a simplex). A pure simplicial complex can be thought of as a complex where all facets have the same dimension.\n\nSometimes the term ''face'' is used to refer to a simplex of a complex, not to be confused with a face of a simplex.\n\nFor a simplicial complex embedded in a ''k''-dimensional space, the ''k''-faces are sometimes referred to as its '''cells'''.  The term ''cell'' is sometimes used in a broader sense to denote a set [[Homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to a simplex, leading to the definition of [[cell complex]].\n\nThe '''underlying space''', sometimes called the '''carrier''' of a simplicial complex is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of its simplices.\n\n==Closure, star, and link==\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=350 heights=112>\nFile:Simplicial complex closure.svg|Two {{color|#fc3|simplices}} and their {{color|#093|'''closure'''}}.\nFile:Simplicial complex star.svg|A {{color|#fc3|vertex}} and its {{color|#093|'''star'''}}.\nFile:Simplicial complex link.svg|A {{color|#fc3|vertex}} and its {{color|#093|'''link'''}}.\n</gallery>\n\nLet ''K'' be a simplicial complex and let ''S'' be a collection of simplices in ''K''.\n\nThe '''closure''' of ''S'' (denoted Cl&nbsp;''S'') is the smallest simplicial subcomplex of ''K'' that contains\neach simplex  in ''S''.  Cl&nbsp;''S'' is obtained by repeatedly adding to ''S'' each face of every simplex in ''S''.\n\nThe '''star''' of ''S'' (denoted St&nbsp;''S'') is the union of the stars of each simplex in ''S''. For a single simplex ''s'', the star of ''s'' is the set of simplices having ''s'' as a face. (Note that the star of ''S'' is generally not a simplicial complex itself).\n\nThe '''link''' of ''S'' (denoted Lk&nbsp;''S'') equals Cl&nbsp;St&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;−&nbsp;St&nbsp;Cl&nbsp;''S''.\nIt is the closed star of  ''S'' minus the stars of all faces of&nbsp;''S''.\n\n==Algebraic topology==\n{{Main|Simplicial homology}}\nIn [[algebraic topology]], simplicial complexes are often useful for concrete calculations.  For the definition of [[homology group]]s of a simplicial complex, one can read the corresponding [[chain complex]] directly, provided that consistent orientations are made of all simplices.  The requirements of [[homotopy theory]] lead to the use of more general spaces, the [[CW complex]]es. Infinite complexes are a technical tool basic in algebraic topology.  See also the discussion at [[polytope]] of simplicial complexes as subspaces of Euclidean space, made up of subsets each of which is a [[simplex]]. That somewhat more concrete concept is there attributed to [[Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov|Alexandrov]]. Any finite simplicial complex in the sense talked about here can be embedded as a polytope in that sense, in some large number of dimensions. In algebraic topology a compact topological space which is homeomorphic to the geometric realization of a finite simplicial complex is usually called a [[polyhedron]] (see {{harvnb|Spanier|1966}}, {{harvnb|Maunder|1996}}, {{harvnb|Hilton|Wylie|1967}}).\n\n==Combinatorics==\n[[Combinatorics|Combinatorialists]] often study the '''''f''-vector''' of a simplicial d-complex Δ, which is the [[integer|integral]] sequence <math>(f_0,  f_1,  f_2,  \\ldots,  f_{d+1})</math>, where ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> is the number of (''i''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)-dimensional faces of Δ (by convention, ''f''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 unless Δ is the empty complex).  For instance, if Δ is the boundary of the [[octahedron]], then its ''f''-vector is (1, 6, 12, 8), and if Δ is the first simplicial complex pictured above, its ''f''-vector is (1, 18, 23, 8, 1).  A complete characterization of the possible ''f''-vectors of simplicial complexes is given by the [[Kruskal–Katona theorem]].\n\nBy using the ''f''-vector of a simplicial ''d''-complex Δ as coefficients of a [[polynomial]] (written in decreasing order of exponents), we obtain the '''f-polynomial''' of Δ.  In our two examples above, the ''f''-polynomials would be <math>x^3+6x^2+12x+8</math> and <math>x^4+18x^3+23x^2+8x+1</math>, respectively.\n\nCombinatorists are often quite interested in the '''h-vector''' of a simplicial complex Δ, which is the sequence of coefficients of the polynomial that results from plugging ''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 into the ''f''-polynomial of Δ.  Formally, if we write ''F''<sub>Δ</sub>(''x'') to mean the ''f''-polynomial of Δ, then the '''h-polynomial''' of Δ is\n\n:<math>F_\\Delta(x-1)=h_0x^{d+1}+h_1x^d+h_2x^{d-1}+\\cdots+h_dx+h_{d+1}</math>\n\nand the ''h''-vector of Δ is\n\n:<math>(h_0,  h_1,  h_2, \\cdots,  h_{d+1}).</math>\n\nWe calculate the h-vector of the octahedron boundary (our first example) as follows:\n\n:<math>F(x-1)=(x-1)^3+6(x-1)^2+12(x-1)+8=x^3+3x^2+3x+1.</math>\n\nSo the ''h''-vector of the boundary of the octahedron is (1, 3, 3, 1).  It is not an accident this ''h''-vector is symmetric.  In fact, this happens whenever Δ is the boundary of a simplicial [[polytope]] (these are the [[Dehn–Sommerville equations]]).  In general, however, the ''h''-vector of a simplicial complex is not even necessarily positive.  For instance, if we take Δ to be the 2-complex given by two triangles intersecting only at a common vertex, the resulting ''h''-vector is (1, 3, −2).\n\nA complete characterization of all simplicial polytope ''h''-vectors is given by the celebrated [[g-theorem]] of [[Richard P. Stanley|Stanley]], Billera, and Lee.\n\nSimplicial complexes can be seen to have the same geometric structure as the [[contact graph]] of a sphere packing (a graph where vertices are the centers of spheres and edges exist if the corresponding packing elements touch each other) and as such can be used to determine the combinatorics of [[sphere packing]]s, such as the number of touching pairs (1-simplices), touching triplets (2-simplices), and touching quadruples (3-simplices) in a sphere packing.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abstract simplicial complex]]\n* [[Barycentric subdivision]]\n* [[Causal dynamical triangulation]]\n* [[Delta set]]\n* [[Polygonal chain]]{{spaced ndash}} 1 dimensional simplicial complex\n* [[Tucker's lemma]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Spanier|first=Edwin H.|authorlink=Edwin Spanier|title=Algebraic Topology|year=1966|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-94426-5}}\n*{{citation|last=Maunder|first=Charles R.F.|title=Algebraic Topology|edition= Reprint of the 1980| year=1996|publisher=Dover|location=Mineola, NY|isbn=0-486-69131-4|mr=1402473}}\n*{{citation|last1=Hilton|first1=Peter J.|authorlink1=Peter Hilton \n| last2=Wylie|first2=Shaun|authorlink2=Shaun Wylie|title=Homology Theory|year=1967|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=0-521-09422-4|mr=0115161}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathWorld |urlname=SimplicialComplex |title=Simplicial complex}}\n\n{{Topology}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Topological spaces]]\n[[Category:Algebraic topology]]\n[[Category:Simplicial sets]]\n[[Category:Triangulation (geometry)]]"

Graham |last=Flegg |title=From Geometry to Topology |location=London |publisher=English University Press |year=1974 |isbn=0-340-05324-0 |pages=84–89 }}</ref>\n\nSperner's lemma states that every '''Sperner coloring''' (described below) of a [[triangulation (geometry)|triangulation]] of an ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]] contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors.\n\nThe initial result of this kind was proved by [[Emanuel Sperner]], in relation with proofs of [[invariance of domain]].  Sperner colorings have been used for effective computation of [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s and in [[root-finding algorithm]]s, and are applied in [[fair division]] (cake cutting) algorithms. It is now believed to be an intractable computational problem to find a Brouwer fixed point or equivalently a Sperner coloring, even in the plane, in the general case. The problem is [[PPAD (complexity)|PPAD-complete]], a complexity class invented by [[Christos Papadimitriou]].\n\nAccording to the Soviet ''Mathematical Encyclopaedia'' (ed. [[I.M. Vinogradov]]), a related 1929 theorem (of [[Bronisław Knaster|Knaster]], [[Karol Borsuk|Borsuk]] and [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz|Mazurkiewicz]]) had also become known as the ''Sperner lemma'' – this point is discussed in the English translation (ed. M. Hazewinkel). It is now commonly known as the [[Knaster–Kuratowski–Mazurkiewicz lemma]].\n\n==Statement==\n=== One-dimensional case ===\n[[Image:Sperner1d.svg|thumb|20px|right|One-dimensional case example]]\nIn one dimension, Sperner's Lemma can be regarded as a discrete version of the [[intermediate value theorem]]. In this case, it essentially says that if a discrete [[Function (mathematics)|function]] takes only the values 0 and 1, begins at the value 0 and ends at the value 1, then it must switch values an odd number of times.\n\n=== Two-dimensional case ===\n[[Image:Sperner2d.svg|250px|thumb|left|Two-dimensional case example]]\nThe two-dimensional case is the one referred to most frequently. It is stated as follows:\n\nGiven a [[triangle]] ABC, and a triangulation ''T'' of the triangle, the set ''S'' of vertices of ''T'' is colored with three colors in such a way that\n# A, B, and C are colored 1, 2, and 3 respectively\n# Each vertex on an edge of ABC is to be colored only with one of the two colors of the ends of its edge. For example, each vertex on AC must have a color either 1 or 3.\n\nThen there exists a triangle from ''T'', whose vertices are colored with the three different colors. More precisely, there must be an odd number of such triangles.\n\n=== Multidimensional case ===\nIn the general case the lemma refers to a ''n''-dimensional [[simplex]]\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}=A_1 A_2 \\ldots A_{n+1}.</math>\n\nWe consider a triangulation ''T'' which is a disjoint division of <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> into smaller ''n''-dimensional simplices. Denote the coloring function as ''f''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''S''&nbsp;→&nbsp;{1,2,3,...,''n'',''n''+1}, where ''S'' is again the set of vertices of ''T''. The rules of coloring are:\n# The vertices of the large simplex are colored with different colors, i. e. ''f''(''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i'' for 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''+1.\n# Vertices of ''T'' located on any ''k''-dimensional subface of the large simplex\n\n::<math>A_{i_1}A_{i_2}\\ldots A_{i_{k+1}}</math>\n\n:are colored only with the colors\n\n::<math>i_1,i_2,\\ldots,i_{k+1}.</math>\n\nThen there exists an odd number of simplices from ''T'', whose vertices are colored with all ''n+1'' colors. In particular, there must be at least one.\n\n== Proof ==\n\nWe shall first address the two-dimensional case. Consider a graph ''G'' built from the triangulation ''T'' as follows:\n\n:The vertices of ''G'' are the members of ''T'' plus the area outside the triangle. Two vertices are connected with an edge if their corresponding areas share a common border with one endpoint colored 1 and the other colored 2.\n\nNote that on the interval AB there is an odd number of borders colored 1-2 (simply because A is colored 1, B is colored 2; and as we move along AB, there must be an odd number of color changes in order to get different colors at the beginning and at the end). Therefore, the vertex of ''G'' corresponding to the outer area has an odd degree. But it is known (the [[handshaking lemma]]) that in a finite graph there is an even number of vertices with odd degree. Therefore, the remaining graph, excluding the outer area, has an odd number of vertices with odd degree corresponding to members of ''T''.\n\nIt can be easily seen that the only possible degree of a triangle from ''T'' is 0, 1, or 2, and that the degree 1 corresponds to a triangle colored with the three colors 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThus we have obtained a slightly stronger conclusion, which says that in a triangulation ''T'' there is an odd number (and at least one) of full-colored triangles.\n\nA multidimensional case can be proved by induction on the dimension of a simplex. We apply the same reasoning, as in the two-dimensional case, to conclude that in a ''n''-dimensional triangulation there is an odd number of full-colored simplices.\n\n=== Commentary ===\n[[Image:Spernerlemma.svg|thumb|left|A simple two-dimensional triangulation of the example figure, colored and named in accordance with the assumptions of Sperner's Lemma]]\n[[Image:Spernergraph.svg|thumb|right|The graph derived from the example figure]]\nHere is an elaboration of the proof given previously, for a reader new to [[graph theory]]:  This diagram numbers the colors of the vertices of the example given previously.  The small triangles whose vertices all have different numbers are shaded in the graph.  Each small triangle becomes a node in the new graph derived from the triangulation.  The small letters identify the areas, eight inside the figure, and area ''i'' designates the space outside of it.  As described previously, those nodes that share an edge whose endpoints are numbered 1 and 2 are joined in the derived graph. For example, node ''d'' shares an edge with the outer area ''i'', and its vertices all have different numbers, so it is also shaded.  Node ''b'' is not shaded because two vertices have the same number, but it is joined to the outer area.\nOne could add a new full-numbered triangle, say by inserting a node numbered 3 into the edge between 1 and 1 of node ''a'', and joining that node to the other vertex of ''a''.  Doing so would have to create a pair of new nodes, like the situation with nodes ''f'' and ''g''.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\n=== Polytopes ===\nSuppose that, instead of an <math>n-1</math>-dimensional simplex, we have a <math>d</math>-dimensional [[polytope]] with <math>n</math> vertices.\n\nThen there are at least <math>n-d</math> fully labeled simplices, where \"fully labeled\" indicates that every label on the simplex has a different color. For example, if a (two-dimensional) polygon with ''n'' vertices is triangulated and colored according to the Sperner criterion, then there are at least <math>n-2</math> fully labeled triangles.\n\nThe general statement was conjectured by [[Krassimir Atanassov|Atanassov]] in 1996, who proved it for the case <math>d=2</math>.<ref>{{citation | last = Atanassov | first = K.

Then, there exists a simplex, and a matching of the people to its vertices, such that each vertex is labeled by its owner differently (one person labels its vertex by 1, another person labels its vertex by 2, etc.). Moreover, there are at least <math>n!</math> such matchings.

      "text": "[[File:Delaunay-Triangulation.svg|thumb|Triangulated irregular network]]\n[[File:Digitales_Geländemodell.png|thumb|TIN overlaid with [[contour line]]s]]\n\nA '''triangulated irregular network''' ('''TIN''') is a representation of a continuous surface consisting entirely of triangular facets, used mainly as [[Discrete Global Grid]] in [[digital elevation model#Types of DEM|primary elevation modeling]].\n\nThe vertices of these triangles are created from field recorded spot elevations through a variety of means including surveying through conventional, Global Positioning System Real-Time Kinematic (GPS RTK), photogrammetry, or some other means.  Associated with three-dimensional data (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') and topography, TINs are useful for the description and analysis of general horizontal (''x'' and ''y'') distributions and relationships.\n\nDigital TIN [[data structures]] are used in a variety of applications, including [[geographic information systems]] (GIS), and computer aided drafting (CAD) for the visual representation of a topographical surface. A TIN is a [[Array data type|vector]]-based representation of the physical land surface or sea bottom, made up of irregularly distributed [[vertex (geometry)|nodes]] and lines with [[dimension|three-dimensional]] [[coordinates]] (''x'', ''y'', and ''z'') that are arranged in a network of non-overlapping triangles.\n\nA TIN comprises a triangular network of vertices, known as mass points, with associated [[coordinates]] in three [[dimensions]] connected by edges to form a triangular [[tessellation]]. Three-dimensional visualizations are readily created by rendering of the triangular facets. In regions where there is little variation in surface height, the points may be widely spaced whereas in areas of more intense variation in height the point density is increased.\n\nA TIN used to represent [[terrain]] is often called a [[digital elevation model]] (DEM), which can be further used to produce digital surface models (DSM) or digital terrain models (DTM).  An advantage of using a TIN over a  [[rasterized]] [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) in mapping and analysis is that the points of a TIN are distributed variably based on an [[algorithm]] that determines which points are most necessary to create an accurate representation of the terrain. Data input is therefore flexible and fewer points need to be stored than in a raster DEM, with regularly distributed points. While a TIN may be considered less suited than a raster DEM for certain kinds of GIS applications, such as analysis of a surface's [[slope]] and [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], it is often used in CAD to create contour lines. A DTM and DSM can be formed from a DEM. A DEM can be interpolated from a TIN.\n\nTIN are based on a [[Delaunay triangulation]] or constrained Delaunay.  Delaunay conforming triangulations are recommended over constrained triangulations. This is because the resulting TINs are likely to contain fewer long, skinny triangles, which are undesirable for surface analysis. Additionally, natural neighbor interpolation and Thiessen (Voronoi) polygon generation can only be performed on Delaunay conforming triangulations.  A constrained Delaunay triangulation can be considered when you need to explicitly define certain edges that are guaranteed not to be modified (that is, split into multiple edges) by the triangulator.  Constrained Delaunay triangulations are also useful for minimizing the size of a TIN, since they have fewer nodes and triangles where breaklines are not densified.\n\nThe TIN model was developed in the early 1970s as a simple way to build a surface from a set of irregularly spaced points.  The first triangulated irregular network program for GIS was written by W. Randolph Franklin, under the direction of David Douglas and Thomas Peucker (Poiker), at [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |title=Research – Triangulated Irregular Network |accessdate=2007-07-26 |url=http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/pmwiki/Research/TriangulatedIrregularNetwork }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://ibis.geog.ubc.ca/courses/klink/gis.notes/ncgia/u39.html UBC Geography]\n*[https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1875 PSU Education]\n*[http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/data/tin/tin-in-arcgis-pro.htm ArcGIS]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Triangulated Irregular Network}}\n[[Category:Geography]]\n[[Category:Cartography]]\n[[Category:Triangulation (geometry)]]\n[[Category:Geometric data structures]]"

For example, one can compute [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology]] groups of a triangulated space using simplicial homology and cohomology theories instead of more complicated homology and cohomology theories.\n\n==Piecewise linear structures==\n{{main|Piecewise linear manifold}}\nFor topological [[manifold]]s, there is a slightly stronger notion of triangulation: a [[piecewise-linear triangulation]] (sometimes just called a triangulation) is a triangulation with the extra property – defined for dimensions 0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. inductively – that the link of any simplex is a piecewise-linear sphere. The ''link'' of a simplex ''s'' in a simplicial complex ''K'' is a subcomplex of ''K'' consisting of the simplices ''t'' that are disjoint from ''s'' and such that both ''s'' and ''t'' are faces of some higher-dimensional simplex in ''K''. For instance, in a two-dimensional piecewise-linear manifold formed by a set of vertices, edges, and triangles, the link of a vertex ''s'' consists of the [[cycle graph|cycle]] of vertices and edges surrounding ''s'': if ''t'' is a vertex in this cycle, ''t'' and ''s'' are both endpoints of an edge of ''K'', and if ''t'' is an edge in this cycle, it and ''s'' are both faces of a triangle of ''K''. This cycle is homeomorphic to a circle, which is a 1-dimensional sphere.  But in this article the word \"triangulation\" is just used to mean homeomorphic to a simplicial complex.\n\nFor manifolds of dimension at most 4, any triangulation of a manifold is a piecewise linear triangulation: In any simplicial complex homeomorphic to a manifold, the link of any simplex can only be homeomorphic to a sphere. But in dimension ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;5 the (''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3)-fold  [[Suspension (topology)|suspension]] of the [[Poincaré homology sphere|Poincaré sphere]] is a topological manifold (homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere) with a triangulation that is not piecewise-linear: it has a simplex whose link is the [[Poincaré homology sphere|Poincaré sphere]], a three-dimensional manifold that is not homeomorphic to a sphere.

The interiors of finitely many of the triangles will cover\nthe surface; since edges of different triangles either coincide or intersect transversally, this finite set of triangles can be used iteratively to construct a triangulation.\n\nAnother simple procedure for triangulating differentiable manifolds was given by [[Hassler Whitney]] in 1957,<ref>{{citation\n | last=Whitney|first= Hassler |authorlink=Hassler Whitney | title= Geometric integration theory | publisher= Princeton University Press | year =1957 |pages =124–135 }}</ref> based on his [[Whitney embedding theorem|embedding theorem]]. In fact, if ''X'' is a closed ''n''-[[submanifold]] of ''R''<sup>''m''</sup>, subdivide a cubical lattice in ''R''<sup>m</sup> into simplices to give a triangulation of ''R''<sup>m</sup>. By taking the [[mesh (mathematics)|mesh]] of the lattice small enough and slightly moving finitely many of the vertices, the triangulation will be in ''general position'' with respect to ''X'': thus no simplices of dimension <&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''n''\nintersect ''X'' and each ''s''-simplex intersecting&nbsp;''X''\n* does so in exactly one interior point;\n* makes a strictly positive angle with the tangent plane;\n* lies wholly inside some [[tubular neighbourhood]] of ''X''.\nThese points of intersection and their barycentres (corresponding to higher dimensional simplices intersecting ''X'') generate an ''n''-dimensional simplicial subcomplex in ''R''<sup>m</sup>, lying wholly inside the tubular neighbourhood. The triangulation is given by the projection of this simplicial complex onto ''X''.\n\n== Graphs on surfaces ==\nA ''Whitney triangulation'' or ''clean triangulation'' of a [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is an embedding of a graph onto the surface in such a way that the faces of the embedding are exactly the [[clique (graph theory)|clique]]s of the graph.<ref name=\"Hartsfeld and Ringel 1981\">{{citation\n  | last = Hartsfeld|first= N.|author2-link=Gerhard Ringel|last2=Ringel|first2= G.\n  | title = Clean triangulations\n  | journal = Combinatorica\n  | volume = 11\n  | year = 1991\n  | pages = 145–155\n  | doi = 10.1007/BF01206358\n  | issue = 2}}</ref><ref name=\"Larrión et al. 2002\">{{citation | last=  Larrión|first= F.|last2= Neumann-Lara|first2= V.|author2-link=Víctor Neumann-Lara|last3= Pizaña|first3=  M.

The term originates from [[Kepler]]'s names of two [[Archimedean solid]]s, for the [[snub cube]] (cubus simus) and [[snub dodecahedron]] (dodecaedron simum).<ref>[[Kepler]], ''Harmonices Mundi'', 1619</ref> In general, snubs have chiral symmetry with two forms, with clockwise or counterclockwise orientations. By Kepler's names, a snub can be seen as an [[Expansion (geometry)|expansion]] of a regular polyhedron, with the faces moved apart, and twists on their centers, adding new polygons centered on the original vertices, and pairs of triangles fitting between the original edges.\n\nThe terminology was generalized by [[Coxeter]], with a slightly different definition, for a wider set of [[uniform polytope]]s.\n\n== Conway snubs ==\n[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] explored generalized polyhedron operators, defining what is now called [[Conway polyhedron notation]], which can be applied to polyhedra and tilings. Conway calls Coxeter's operation a ''semi-snub''.<ref>Conway, (2008) p.287 Coxeter's semi-snub operation</ref>\n\nIn this notation, [[Conway snub operator|snub]] is defined by the dual and [[Conway gyro operator|gyro]] operators, as ''s''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''dg'', and it is equivalent to an [[alternation (geometry)|alternation]] of a truncation of an [[Conway ambo operator|ambo]] operator. Conway's notation itself avoids Coxeter's alternation (half) operation since it only applies for polyhedra with only even-sided faces.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Snubbed regular figures\n|-\n!Form\n!colspan=3|Polyhedra\n!colspan=2|Euclidean\n!Hyperbolic\n|-\n![[Conway polyhedron notation|Conway<BR>notation]]\n!sT\n!sC = sO\n!sI = sD\n!sQ\n!sH = s&Delta;\n!s&Delta;<sub>7</sub>\n|- align=center\n!rowspan=2|Snubbed<BR>polyhedra\n|[[Tetrahedron]]\n|[[Cube]] or<BR>[[octahedron]]\n|[[Icosahedron]] or<BR>[[dodecahedron]]\n|[[Square tiling]]\n|[[Hexagonal tiling]] or<BR>[[Triangular tiling]]\n|[[Heptagonal tiling]] or<BR>[[Order-7 triangular tiling]]\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Uniform polyhedron-33-t0.png|40px]][[File:Uniform polyhedron-33-t2.png|40px]]\n|[[File:Uniform polyhedron-43-t0.svg|40px]][[File:Uniform polyhedron-43-t2.svg|40px]]\n|[[File:Uniform polyhedron-53-t0.svg|40px]][[File:Uniform polyhedron-53-t2.svg|40px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 44-t0.svg|40px]][[File:Uniform tiling 44-t2.svg|40px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t0.svg|40px]][[File:Uniform tiling 63-t2.svg|40px]]\n|[[File:Heptagonal tiling.svg|40px]][[File:Order-7 triangular tiling.svg|40px]]\n|-\n!Image\n![[File:Uniform polyhedron-33-s012.svg|100px]]\n![[File:Uniform polyhedron-43-s012.png|100px]]\n![[File:Uniform polyhedron-53-s012.png|100px]]\n![[File:Uniform tiling 44-snub.svg|100px]]\n![[File:Uniform tiling 63-snub.svg|100px]]\n![[File:Uniform tiling 73-snub.png|100px]]\n|}\n\nIn 4-dimensions, Conway suggests the [[snub 24-cell]] should be called a ''semi-snub 24-cell'' because it doesn't represent an alternated [[omnitruncated 24-cell]] like his 3-dimensional polyhedron usage.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_tiling",
      "text": "[[Image:Pavage domino.svg|thumb|right|Domino tiling of a square]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''domino tiling''' of a region in the [[Euclidean plane]] is a [[tessellation]] of the region by [[domino (mathematics)|domino]]s, shapes formed by the union of two [[unit square]]s meeting edge-to-edge. Equivalently, it is a [[Matching (graph theory)|perfect matching]] in the [[grid graph]] formed by placing a vertex at the center of each square of the region and connecting two vertices when they correspond to adjacent squares.\n\n== Height functions ==\nFor some classes of tilings on a regular grid in two dimensions, it is possible to define a height function associating an integer to the [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of the grid. For instance, draw a chessboard, fix a node <math>A_0</math> with height 0, then for any node there is a path from <math>A_0</math> to it. On this path define the height of each node <math>A_{n+1}</math> (i.e. corners of the squares) to be the height of the previous node <math>A_n</math> plus one if the square on the right of the path from <math>A_n</math> to <math>A_{n+1}</math> is black, and minus one otherwise.\n\nMore details can be found in {{harvtxt|Kenyon|Okounkov|2005}}.\n\n==Thurston's height condition==\n[[William Thurston]] (1990) describes a test for determining whether a simply-connected region, formed as the union of unit squares in the plane, has a domino tiling. He forms an [[undirected graph]] that has as its vertices the points (''x'',''y'',''z'') in the three-dimensional [[integer lattice]], where each such point is connected to four neighbors: if ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'' is even, then (''x'',''y'',''z'') is connected to (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,''y'',''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), (''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,''y'',''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), (''x'',''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,''z''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1), and (''x'',''y''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,''z''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1), while if ''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'' is odd, then (''x'',''y'',''z'') is connected to (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,''y'',''z''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1), (''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,''y'',''z''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1), (''x'',''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1), and (''x'',''y''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1,''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1). The boundary of the region, viewed as a sequence of integer points in the (''x'',''y'') plane, lifts uniquely (once a starting height is chosen) to a path in this [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|three-dimensional graph]].  A necessary condition for this region to be tileable is that this path must close up to form a simple closed curve in three dimensions, however, this condition is not sufficient.  Using more careful analysis of the boundary path, Thurston gave a criterion for tileability of a region that was sufficient as well as necessary.\n\n==Counting tilings of regions==\n[[Image:Dominoes tiling 8x8.svg|thumb|right|Domino tiling of an 8×8 square using the minimum number of long-edge-to-long-edge pairs (1 pair in the center). This arrangement is also a valid [[Tatami]] tiling of an 8x8 square, with no four dominoes touching at an internal point.]]\nThe number of ways to cover an <math> m \\times n </math> rectangle with <math> \\frac{mn}{2} </math> dominoes,  calculated independently by {{harvtxt|Temperley|Fisher|1961}} and {{harvtxt|Kasteleyn|1961}}, is given by\n\n:<math> \\prod_{j=1}^{\\lceil\\frac{m}{2}\\rceil} \\prod_{k=1}^{\\lceil\\frac{n}{2}\\rceil} \\left ( 4\\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi j}{m + 1} + 4\\cos^2 \\frac{\\pi k}{n + 1} \\right ).</math>\n\nWhen both ''m'' and ''n'' are odd, the formula correctly reduces to zero possible domino tilings.\n\nA special case occurs when tiling the <math>2\\times n</math> rectangle with ''n'' dominoes: the sequence reduces to the [[Fibonacci sequence]] {{OEIS|id=A000045}} {{harv|Klarner|Pollack|1980}}.\n\nAnother special case happens for squares with ''m'' = ''n'' = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...  is\n:1, 2, 36, 6728, 12988816, 258584046368, 53060477521960000, ... {{OEIS|id=A004003}}.\n\nThese numbers can be found by writing them as the [[Pfaffian]] of an <math>mn \\times mn</math> [[skew-symmetric matrix]] whose [[eigenvalue]]s can be found explicitly. This technique may be applied in many mathematics-related subjects, for example, in the classical, 2-dimensional computation of the [[dimer-dimer correlator function]] in [[statistical mechanics]].\n\nThe number of tilings of a region is very sensitive to boundary conditions, and can change dramatically with apparently insignificant changes in the shape of the region. This is illustrated by \nthe number of tilings of an [[Aztec diamond]] of order ''n'', where the number of tilings is 2<sup>(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)''n''/2</sup>. If this is replaced by the \"augmented Aztec diamond\" of order ''n'' with 3 long rows in the middle rather than 2, the\nnumber of tilings drops to the much smaller number D(''n'',''n''), a [[Delannoy number]], which has only exponential rather than [[super-exponential growth]] in ''n''. For the \"reduced Aztec diamond\" of order ''n'' with only one \nlong middle row, there is only one tiling.\n<gallery>\nFile:Diamant azteque.svg|An Aztec diamond of order 4, with 1024 domino tilings\nFile:Diamant azteque plein.svg|One possible tiling\n</gallery>\n\n==Tatami==\n[[Tatami]] are Japanese floor mats in the shape of a domino (1x2 rectangle). They are used to tile rooms, but with additional rules about how they may be placed. In particular, typically, junctions where three tatami meet are considered auspicious, while junctions where four meet are inauspicious, so a proper tatami tiling is one where only three tatami meet at any corner ({{harvnb|Mathar|2013}}; {{harvnb|Ruskey|Woodcock|2009}}). The problem of tiling an irregular room by tatami that meet three to a corner is [[NP-complete]] {{harv|Erickson|Ruskey|2013}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Statistical mechanics]]\n*[[Gaussian free field]], the scaling limit of the height function in the generic situation (e.g., inside the inscribed disk of a large aztec diamond)\n*[[Mutilated chessboard problem]], a puzzle concerning domino tiling of a 62-square subset of the chessboard\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Bodini | first1=Olivier | last2=Latapy | first2=Matthieu | title=Generalized Tilings with Height Functions | url=http://www-rp.lip6.fr/%7Elatapy/Publis/morfismos03.pdf | year=2003 | journal=Morfismos | issn=1870-6525 | volume=7 | issue=1 | pages=47–68}}.\n* {{citation\n | last1 = Erickson | first1 = Alejandro\n | last2 = Ruskey | first2 = Frank | author2-link = Frank Ruskey\n | contribution = Domino tatami covering is NP-complete\n | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-45278-9_13\n | mr = 3162068\n | pages = 140–149\n | publisher = Springer, Heidelberg\n | series = Lecture Notes in Comput.

A $2 million prize was offered for the first complete solution. The competition ended at noon on 31 December 2010, with no solution being found.\n\n==Puzzle mechanics==\nThe Eternity II puzzle is an [[edge-matching puzzle]] which involves placing 256 square puzzle pieces into a 16 by 16 grid, constrained by the requirement to match adjacent edges. It has been designed to be difficult to solve by brute-force computer search.\n\nEach puzzle piece has its edges on one side marked with different shape/colour combinations (collectively called \"colours\" here), each of which must match precisely with its neighbouring side on each adjacent piece when the puzzle is complete. The other side of each piece is blank apart from an identifying number, and is not used in the puzzle. Thus, each piece can be used in only 4 orientations. There are 22 colours, not including the gray edges. Five of those can only be found on border and corner pieces and 17 only on so called inner pieces and the side of the border piece across from the gray colour. This puzzle differs from the first Eternity puzzle in that there is a starter piece which must be placed near the center of the board. (See [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] rulebook on official website.<ref>[http://uk.eternityii.com/about-eternity2/download/ Download PDF rule book] from official site. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080313002952/http://uk.eternityii.com/about-eternity2/download/ Mirror]</ref>)\n\nTwo Clue Puzzles were available with the launch of the product, which, if solved, each give a piece position on the main 256-piece puzzle. Clue Puzzle 1 is 6 by 6, with 36 pieces and Clue Puzzle 2 is 12 by 6, with 72 pieces. Two further puzzles were made available in 2008. Clue Puzzle 3 is 6 by 6, with 36 pieces, and Clue Puzzle 4 is 12 by 6, with 72 pieces.\n\nThe number of possible configurations for the Eternity II puzzle, assuming all the pieces are distinct, and ignoring the fixed pieces with pre-determined positions, is 256! &times; 4<sup>256</sup>, roughly 1.15 &times; 10<sup>661</sup>. A tighter upper bound to the possible number of configurations can be achieved by taking into account the fixed piece in the center and the restrictions set on the pieces on the edge: 1 &times; 4! &times; 56! &times; 195! &times; 4<sup>195</sup>, roughly 1.115 &times; 10<sup>557</sup>. A further upper bound can be obtained by considering the position and orientation of the hint pieces obtained through the clue puzzles. In this case the position and orientation of five pieces is known, giving an upper bound of 4! &times; 56! &times; 191! &times; 4<sup>191</sup> = 3.11 &times; 10<sup>545</sup>, yielding a search space 3.70 &times; 10<sup>115</sup> times smaller than the first approximation.\n\n==Solution submissions==\nAfter the first scrutiny date on 31 December 2008 it was announced that no complete solution had been found.

Eternity was the best-selling puzzle or game in the UK at its price-point of £35 in the month it was launched.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n== Prize ==\nThe puzzle's inventor, [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley| Christopher Monckton]], put up half the prize money himself, the other half being put up by [[underwriters]] in the London insurance market. According to Eternity's rules, possible solutions to the puzzle would be received by mail on September 21, 2000.  If no correct solutions were opened, the mail for the next year would be kept until September 30, 2001, the process being repeated every year until 2003, after which no entries would be accepted.\n\nBefore marketing the puzzle, Monckton had thought that it would take at least three years before anyone could crack the puzzle.<ref name=scoop /> One estimate made at the time stated that the puzzle had 10<sup>500</sup> possible attempts at a solution, and it would take longer than the lifetime of the Universe to calculate all of them even if you had a million computers.<ref>{{citation |title= The Eternity Puzzle |author= Duncan Richer |date= July 1999 |publisher= [[NRICH]] |url= http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=1354&part=index&refpage=articles.php }}</ref>\n\nOnce solved, Monckton claimed that the earlier-than-expected solution had forced him to sell his 67-room house, [[Crimonmogate]], to pay the prize.<ref name=scoop/><ref name=thescot012407 /> In 2006, he said that the claim had been a [[Public relations|PR]] stunt to boost sales over Christmas, that the house's sale was unrelated to the prize as he was going to sell it anyway.<ref name=thescot012407 />\n\n== Solution ==\n\nAs soon as the puzzle was launched, an online community emerged devoted to solving it, centred on a mailing list<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/eternity/messages\n|title=Eternity mailing list\n|accessdate=2011-09-28\n}}</ref> on which many ideas and techniques were discussed.  It was soon realised that it was trivial to fill the board almost completely, to an \"end-game position\" where an irregularly-shaped void had to be filled with only a few pieces, at which point the pieces left would be the \"wrong shapes\" to fill the remaining space. The hope of solving the end-game depended vitally on having pieces that were easy to tile together in a variety of shapes.  Computer searches were carried out to find which pieces tiled well or badly, and these data used to alter otherwise-standard [[backtracking search]] programs to use the bad pieces first, in the hope of being left with only good pieces in the hard final part of the search. \n\nThe puzzle was solved on May 15, 2000, before the first deadline, by two [[Cambridge]] mathematicians, Alex Selby and Oliver Riordan.<ref name=archduke061607>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.archduke.org/eternity/method/desc.html\n|title=Description of (Eternity solver) method\n|work=Alex Selby (and Oliver Riordan)\n|date=2007-06-16\n|accessdate=2007-06-16\n}}</ref>  Key to their success was the mathematical rigour with which they approached the problem of determining the tileability of individual pieces and of empty regions within the board.  These provided measures of the probability that a given piece could help to fill or 'tile' a given region, and the probability that a given region could be tiled by some combination of pieces.  In the search for a solution, these probabilities were used to identify which partial tilings, out of a vast number explored by the computer program, were most likely to lead to a solution.  A complete solution was obtained within seven months of development with the aid of two domestic PCs.\n\nAlthough not required for the prize, a complete solution with at least one of the six hint pieces correctly placed has not yet been discovered. The first hint, which was shown placed on every board and solution sheet, was not required to be placed there in any solution submission for the prize. The other five hints could be obtained after submission of solutions to the three clue puzzles. Without any fixed hint pieces required, the puzzle was significantly easier to solve. However, currently there are no known complete solutions with all of the six hint pieces fixed in the correct positions.\n\n== Inspirations ==\n\nThe architectural design of the [[Perth Arena]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]], was heavily influenced by the eternity puzzle; the exterior design is also strongly reflected throughout the main arena, foyers, breakout function rooms and the entrance to the venue.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ashton Raggatt McDougall turn to colour for Perth Arena|url=http://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/article/Ashton-Raggatt-McDougall-turn-to-colour-for-Perth-Arena/515833.aspx|publisher=Architecture & Design|accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://plus.maths.org/issue13/features/eternity/index.html A detailed article on how the puzzle was solved]\n* [http://mathpuzzle.com/eternity.html Discussion of the Eternity puzzle and related problems]\n* [http://www.archduke.org/eternity/ Alex Selby's page on the Eternity puzzle]\n* [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Eternity.html Wolfram MathWorld article]\n\n[[Category:1999 introductions]]\n[[Category:Puzzle competitions]]\n[[Category:Tiling puzzles]]"

      "text": "[[File:Geomagic square - 3x3 decominoes.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: {{pad|.2em}} A geomagic square showing same-sized pieces]]\nA '''geometric magic square''', often abbreviated to '''geomagic square''', is a generalization of [[magic squares]] invented by [[Lee Sallows]] in 2001. A traditional magic square is a square array of numbers (almost always positive integers) whose sum taken in any row, any column, or in either diagonal is the same ''target number''. A geomagic square, on the other hand, is a square array of geometrical shapes in which those appearing in each row, column, or diagonal can be fitted together to create an identical shape called the ''target shape''.  As with numerical types, it is required that the entries in a geomagic square be distinct. Similarly, the eight trivial variants of any square resulting from its rotation and/or reflection, are all counted as the same square. By the ''dimension'' of a geomagic square is meant the dimension of the pieces it uses. Hitherto interest has focused mainly on 2D squares using planar pieces, but pieces of any dimension are permitted.\n\n==Examples==\nFigure 1 above shows a 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 geomagic square. The 3 pieces occupying each row, column and diagonal pave a rectangular target, as seen at left and right, and above and below. Here the 9 pieces are all [[decomino]]es, but pieces of any shape may appear, and it is not a requirement that they be of same size. In Figure 2, for instance, the pieces are polyominoes of consecutive sizes from 1 up to 9 units. The target is a 4 by 4 square with an inner square hole.\n\nSurprisingly, computer investigations show that Figure 2 is just one among 4,370 distinct 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 geomagic squares using pieces with these same sizes and same target.  Conversely, Figure 1 is one of only two solutions using similar-sized pieces and identical target. In general, repeated piece sizes imply fewer solutions. However, at present there exists no theoretical underpinning to explain these empirical findings.<ref name=guardian/>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n[[File:Geomagic square - 3x3 normal sqare target.jpg|thumb|left| text-bottom |260px|Figure 2: {{pad|.2em}} A geomagic square using consecutively-sized pieces.]]\n[[File:Geomagic square - 3x3 nasik.jpg|thumb|right| text-bottom |260px|Figure 3: {{pad|.2em}} A panmagic 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 geomagic square]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\nThe pieces in a geomagic square may also be ''disjoint'', or composed of separated islands, as seen in Figure 3.

[[Charles Ashbacher]], co-editor of the [[Journal of Recreational Mathematics]], speaks of the field of magic squares being \"dramatically expanded\"<ref>[http://www.maa.org/publications/maa-reviews/geometric-magic-squares ''Geometric Magic Squares'' reviewed by Charles Ashbacher] [[Mathematical Association of America]], September 24, 2013</ref>   [[Peter Cameron (mathematician)|Peter Cameron]], winner of the London Mathematical Society's [[Whitehead Prize]] and joint winner of the [[Euler Medal]], called geomagic squares \"a wonderful new piece of recreational maths, which will delight non-mathematicians and give mathematicians food for thought.\"<ref name=guardian>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/apr/03/magic-squares-geomagic-lee-sallows \"Magic squares are given a whole new dimension\"], by Alex Bellos, ''[[The Observer]]'', April 3, 2011</ref> Mathematics writer [[Alex Bellos]] said, \"To come up with this after thousands of years of study of magic squares is pretty amazing.\"<ref name=newscientist>[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20017-ancient-puzzle-gets-new-lease-of-geomagical-life.html \"Ancient puzzle gets new lease of 'geomagical' life\"] by Jacob Aron, ''[[New Scientist]]'', January 24, 2011</ref>  It may be asked whether geomagic squares might have applications outside the study of puzzles. Cameron is convinced of it, saying, \"I can immediately see a lot of things I'd like to do with this.\"<ref name=newscientist/>\n\n== Methods of construction ==\nTrivial examples excepted, there are no known easy methods for producing geomagic squares. To date, two approaches have been explored.<ref>Sallows, pp 1–12</ref>  Where the pieces to be used are ''[[polyform]]s'', or shapes built up from repeated units, an exhaustive search by computer becomes possible.\n\nIn the case of Figure 1, for instance, a first step would be to decide on the piece sizes to be used (in this case all the same), and the shape of the desired target. An initial program would then be able to generate a list ''L'' corresponding to every possible tiling of this target shape by 3 distinct decominoes (polyominoes of size 10). Each decomino is represented by a unique integer, so that ''L'' will consist of a list of integer triads. A subsequent routine can then run through and test every combination of three different triads in turn. The test will consist in treating the candidate triads as the row entries in a 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 square, and then checking to see whether the columns and diagonals thus formed each contain 3 integers that are also in ''L''—which is to say, are also target-tiling triads. If so, a 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 geomagic square using 9 decominoes and selected target has been identified. If this fails, alternative target shapes can be tried. An elaborated version of the same method can be used to search for larger squares, or for squares including differently-sized pieces.\n\nAn alternative method of construction begins with a trivial geomagic square showing repeated pieces, the shapes of which are then modified so as to render each distinct, but without disrupting the square's magic property. This is achieved by means of an algebraic template such as seen below, the distinct variables in which are then interpreted as different shapes to be either appended to or excised from the initial pieces, depending on their sign.\n[[File:Geomagic square - Magic Jigsaw.jpg|thumb|right| text-bottom |260px|Figure 4: {{pad|.2em}}  A 'self-interlocking' geomagic square]]\nFigure 4 illustrates such a geometrical interpretation of the template in which\n''k'' is interpreted as a small square shape, while ''a'',''b'',''c'' and ''d'' represent the protrusions (+) and/or indentations (-) by means of which it becomes modified so as to result in 16 distinct jigsaw pieces.\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n k+a+b & k-a+d & k-c-d & k-b+c \\\\\n\\hline\n k+a-b & k-a-d & k-c+d & k+b+c \\\\\n\\hline\n k-a-b & k+a-d & k+c+d & k+b-c \\\\\n\\hline\n k-a+b & k+a+d & k+c-d & k-b-c \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}</math>\n\n==Relation to traditional magic squares==\nContrary to the impression made at first sight, it is a misunderstanding to regard the term 'geomagic square' as referring to some category of magic square. In fact the exact opposite is the case: every (additive) magic square is a particular instance of a geomagic square, but never vice versa. The point is made clear by the example below that appears in a wide-ranging article on geomagic squares by [[Jean-Paul Delahaye]] in ''[[:fr:Pour la Science|Pour la Science]]'', the French version of ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref name=PourlaScience>[https://www.pourlascience.fr/sd/mathematiques/les-carres-magiques-geometriques-7372.php Les carrés magiques géométriques] by Jean-Paul Delahaye, ''Pour La Science'' No. 428, June 2013</ref>  In this case the target \"shape\" for the geomagic square at right is simply a one dimensional line segment 15 units long, the pieces again being no more than straight line segments. As such, the latter is obviously a straightforward translation into geometrical terms of the numerical magic square at left.\n\n<div class=\"center\">\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n| style=\"padding: 0 1em\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:12em;height:12em;table-layout:fixed;\"\n|-\n|+ Target is {{pad|.2em}} 15\n|-\n| 4 || 9|| 2\n|-\n| 3 || 5 || 7\n|-\n| 8 || 1 || 6\n|}\n\n|\n| style=\"padding: 0 7em\" |\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;text-align:center;width:12em;height:12em;table-layout:fixed;\"\n|-\n|+ Target is {{pad|.2em}} •••••••••••••••\n|-\n| •••• ||•••••••••|| ••\n|-\n| ••• || ••••• || •••••••\n|-\n| •••••••• || • || ••••••\n|}\n|}\n</div>\n\nAs Delahaye says, \"This example shows that the geomagic square concept generalizes magic squares. The result here is hardly spectacular, but happily there are other geomagic squares that are not the result of such a translation.\"<ref name=PourlaScience/><ref>Cet exemple montre que la notion de carré géomagique généralise celle de carré magique. Le résultat n’est ici guère spectaculaire, mais heureusement, il existe d’autres carrés géomagiques ne provenant pas d’une telle traduction directe.</ref>\n\nThe point being that every numerical magic square can be understood as a one-dimensional geomagic square as above.  Or as Sallows himself puts it, \"Traditional magic squares featuring numbers are then revealed as that particular case of 'geomagic' squares in which the elements are all one-dimensional.\"<ref name=mathent>[https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00283-011-9229-0.pdf Geometric Magic Squares by Lee Sallows], ''The Mathematical Intelligencer'', Vol 23, No. 4 Winter 2011, pp 25-31</ref>  This however does not exhaust the 1D case, because there exist 1D geomagic squares whose components are ''disconnected'' line segments, and which do not correspond to any numerical magic square.  Thus, even in dimension one, the traditional types correspond to only a tiny subset of all geometric magic squares.\n\n==Special types==\nThe richer structure of geomagic squares is reflected in the existence of specimens showing a far greater degree of 'magic' than is possible with numerical types. Thus a ''[[panmagic square]]'' is one in which every diagonal, including the so-called ''[[broken diagonal]]s'', shares the same magic property as the rows and columns.  However, it is easily shown that a panmagic square of size 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3 is impossible to construct with numbers, whereas a geometric example can be seen in Figure 3. No comparable example using connected pieces has yet been reported.<ref name=mathent/>\n{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n[[File:Geomagic square - Maancubes.jpg|thumb|left| text-bottom |260px|Figure 5: {{pad|.2em}} A 3D geomagic square with cubic target shapes]]\n[[File:Geomagic square - self-tiler.jpg|thumb|right| text-bottom |260px|Figure 6: {{pad|.2em}} A geomagic square whose pieces comprise a self-tiling tile set]]\n|}\n{{clear}}\nIn addition to being geomagic, there exist squares with auxiliary properties making them even more distinctive. In Figure 6, for example, which is magic on rows and columns only, the 16 pieces form a so-called ''[[Self-tiling tile set]]''. Such a set is defined as any set of ''n'' distinct shapes, each of which can be tiled by smaller replicas of the complete set of ''n'' shapes.<ref>On Self-Tiling Tile Sets by Lee Sallows, ''Mathematics Magazine'', December 2012</ref>\n\nA second example is Figure 4, which is a so-called 'self-interlocking' geomagic square. Here the 16 pieces are no longer contained within separate cells, but  define the square cell shapes themselves, so as to mesh together to complete a square-shaped jigsaw.\n\n==Geomagic squares in popular culture==\n[[File:Macau stamp featuring geometric magic square.jpg|thumb|right| text-bottom |240px|Macau stamp featuring geometric magic square]]\nOn October 9, 2014 the post office of [[Macau]] issued a series of stamps based on [[magic squares]].<ref>[https://www.macaupost.gov.mo/Philately/?lang=en-us Macau Post Office web site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111231833/https://www.macaupost.gov.mo/Philately/?lang=en-us |date=2014-11-11 }}</ref>  The stamp below, showing one of the geomagic squares created by Sallows, was chosen to be in this collection.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/alexs-adventures-in-numberland/2014/nov/04/macaus-magic-square-stamps-just-made-philately-even-more-nerdy Macau's magic square stamps just made philately even more nerdy] [[The Guardian]]  Science, November 3, 2014</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n* Sallows, Lee, ''Geometric Magic Squares: A Challenging New Twist Using Colored Shapes Instead of Numbers'', Dover Publications, April 2013, {{ISBN|0486489094}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.geomagicsquares.com/ Geomagic Squares website]\n* [http://www.geomagicsquares.com/appendix.php A formal mathematical definition of Geomagic Squares]\n{{Magic polygons}}\n\n[[Category:Recreational mathematics]]\n[[Category:Magic squares]]\n[[Category:Tiling puzzles]]\n[[Category:Geometric dissection]]"

In some cases, more advanced types have appeared on the market, such as spherical jigsaws and puzzles showing [[optical illusions]].\n\nJigsaw puzzles were originally created by [[painting]] a picture on a flat, rectangular piece of wood, and then cutting that picture into small pieces with a [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaw]], hence the name. [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]], a [[London]] [[cartographer]] and [[engraver]], is credited with commercializing jigsaw puzzles around 1760.<ref name=history>{{cite web|last1=McAdam|first1=Daniel|title=History of Jigsaw Puzzles|url=http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|publisher=American Jigsaw Puzzle Society |accessdate=13 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001019002453/http://www.jigsaw-puzzle.org/jigsaw-puzzle-history.html|archivedate=19 October 2000}}</ref> Jigsaw puzzles have since come to be made primarily of cardboard.\n\nTypical images found on jigsaw puzzles include scenes from [[nature]], [[building]]s, and repetitive designs. [[Castle]]s and [[mountain]]s are two traditional subjects. However, any kind of picture can be used to make a jigsaw puzzle; some companies offer to turn personal photographs into puzzles. Completed puzzles can also be attached to a backing with adhesive to be used as artwork.\n\nDuring recent years, a range of [[jigsaw puzzle accessories]] including boards, cases, frames, and roll-up mats has become available that are designed to assist jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Spilsbury jigsaw - John Spilsbury, 1766 - BL.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]]'s \"Europe divided into its kingdoms, etc.\" (1766).

Since fretsaws are distinct from [[jigsaw (tool)|jigsaws]], the name appears to be a [[misnomer]].<ref name=history /> [[Cardboard]] jigsaw puzzles appeared during the late 1800s, but were slow to replace the wooden jigsaw due to the manufacturer's belief that cardboard puzzles would be perceived as being of low quality, and the fact that [[profit margins]] on wooden jigsaws were larger.<ref name=history />\n[[File:Close up of Hand Cut Jigsaw Puzzle.JPG|thumb|left|Wooden jigsaw pieces, cut by hand]]\nJigsaw puzzles soared in popularity during the [[Great Depression]], as they provided a cheap, long-lasting, [[recycling|recyclable]] form of entertainment.<ref name=history /><ref name=briefhistory>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Anne, D.|title=Jigsaw Puzzles - A Brief History|url=http://www.mgcpuzzles.com/mgcpuzzles/puzzle%5Fhistory/|website=www.mgcpuzzles.com|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> It was around this time that jigsaws evolved to become more complex and more appealing to adults.<ref name=history /> They were also given away in [[promotion (marketing)|product promotions]], and used in [[advertising]], with customers completing an image of the product being promoted.<ref name=history /><ref name=briefhistory />\n\nSales of wooden jigsaw puzzles fell after [[World War II]] as improved [[wages]] led to [[price]] increases, while at the same time improvements in [[manufacturing]] processes made cardboard jigsaws more attractive.<ref name=briefhistory />\n\nAccording to the [[Alzheimer Society of Canada]], doing jigsaw puzzles is one of many activities that can help keep the brain active and may contribute to reducing the risk of developing [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref>[http://www.alzheimer.ca/english/brain/challengeyourself.htm Healthy Brain] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212111954/http://alzheimer.ca/english/brain/challengeyourself.htm |date=2010-12-12 }} Alzheimer Society of Canada Accessed 30 March 2011</ref>\n\n==Modern construction==\n\n[[File:Sky puzzle.jpg|thumb|left|Paperboard jigsaw pieces]]\nMost modern jigsaw puzzles are made out of [[paperboard]] since they are easier and cheaper to mass-produce than the original wooden models. An enlarged [[photograph]] or printed reproduction of a painting or other two-dimensional [[art]]work is glued onto the cardboard before cutting. This board is then fed into a press.  The press forces a set of hardened steel blades of the desired shape through the board until it is fully cut.  This procedure is similar to making shaped cookies with a cookie cutter.  The forces involved, however, are tremendously greater and a typical 1000-piece puzzle requires a press that can generate upwards of 700 tons of force to push the knives of the puzzle die through the board. A puzzle die is a flat board, often made from plywood, which has slots cut or burned in the same shape as the knives that are used.  These knives are set into the slots and covered in a compressible material, typically foam rubber, which serves to eject the cut puzzle pieces.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, jigsaw puzzles were cut using large hydraulic presses which now cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The cuts gave a very snug fit, but the cost limited jigsaw puzzle manufacture only to large corporations.  Recent roller press design achieve the same effect, at a lower cost.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} By the early 1960s, [[Tower Press]] was the world's largest maker of jigsaw puzzles, acquired by [[Waddingtons]] in 1969.<ref name=\"Achievement\">{{cite book|title=Achievement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMkNAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=3 April 2013|year=1962|publisher=World Trade Magazines Ltd.|page=31}}</ref>\n\nNew technology has enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage of cutting with a laser is that the puzzle can be custom cut into any size, any shape, with any size (or any number) of pieces. Many museums have laser cut acrylic puzzles made of some of their more important pieces of art so that children visiting the museum can see the original piece and then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the image that is also in the same shape as the piece of art. Acrylic is used because the pieces are very durable, waterproof, and can withstand continued use without the image fading, or the pieces wearing out, or becoming frayed. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer-based, lost pieces can be manufactured without remaking the entire puzzle.\n\n== Variations ==\n[[File:JigsawSoftware.jpeg|thumb|Jigsaw puzzle [[software]] allowing rotation of pieces]]\n[[File:Ignis-spindle-fin12.jpg|thumb|left|A three-dimensional puzzle composed of several two-dimensional puzzles stacked on top of one another]]\n[[Image:Puzzle Krypt-2.jpg|thumb|A puzzle without a picture]]\n\nJigsaw puzzles come in a variety of sizes. Smaller puzzles are often considered to be those of 300, 500, and 750 pieces. More sophisticated, but still common, jigsaw puzzles come in sizes of 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,500, 8,000, 9,000, 13,200, 18,000, 24,000, 32,000 and 40,000 pieces.\n\nThere are also smaller jigsaw puzzles that are geared towards children and are rated by the number of pieces they contain. For very young children, a puzzle with as few as 4 to 9 \"large\"-size pieces (so not a choking hazard) are common. These are usually made of wood or plastic, to maintain durability, and are able to be cleaned without being damaged.\n\nThe most common layout for a thousand-piece puzzle is 38 pieces by 27 pieces, for a total count of 1,026 pieces. The majority of 500-piece puzzles are 27 pieces by 19 pieces.  A few puzzles are made double-sided, so that they can be solved from either side. This adds a level of complexity, because it cannot be certain that the correct side of the piece is being viewed and assembled with the other pieces.\n\n\"Family puzzles\" come in 100–550 pieces with three different-sized pieces from large to small. The pieces are placed from large to small, going in one direction or towards the middle of the puzzle.  This allows a family of puzzlers of different skill levels and different-sized hands to work on the puzzle at the same time.  Companies like [[Springbok Puzzles|Springbok]], [[Cobble Hill Puzzles|Cobble Hill]], [[Ravensburger]], and [[Suns Out]] make this type of specialty puzzle.\n\nThere are also [[dimension|three-dimensional]] jigsaw puzzles. Many of these are made of wood or [[styrofoam]] and require the puzzle to be solved in a certain order; some pieces will not fit in if others are already in place.\nAlso common are ''puzzle boxes'': simple three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles with a small drawer or box in the center for storage.\n\nAnother type of jigsaw puzzle, which is considered a 3-D puzzle, is a [[puzzle globe]].  Like a 2-D puzzle, a globe puzzle is often made of plastic and the assembled pieces form a single layer. But the final form is a three-dimensional shape. Most globe puzzles have designs representing spherical shapes such as the [[Earth]], the [[Moon]], and historical globes of the Earth.\n\nThere are also computer versions of jigsaw puzzles, which have the advantages of requiring zero cleanup and no risk of losing any pieces. Many computer-based jigsaw puzzles do not allow pieces to be rotated, so all pieces are displayed in their correct orientation. These puzzles are thus considerably easier than a physical jigsaw puzzle with the same number of pieces. A computer puzzle website can allow users to choose their own puzzle size, cut design, and image, or upload their own images to use as puzzles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Online Jigsaw Puzzles |url=http://www.jigzone.com/ |publisher=Jigzone |accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> An online jigsaw version of [[Trolleholm Castle]] in Sweden may be worked and timed for speed of finishing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trolleholm Castle, Sweden jigsaw puzzle |url=http://thejigsawpuzzles.com/Castles/Trolleholm-Castle-Sweden-jigsaw-puzzle |website=TheJigsawPuzzles.com |accessdate=30 November 2016}}</ref> The [[New Yorker Magazine]] subscription website preserves images of the magazine's cover illustrations as jigsaw puzzles, which are timed and offer several levels of difficulty.\n\nIn 2016 was introduced a computer version of puzzle globe, the [[immersive panorama jigsaw]], which is based on the use of [[equirectangular]] images taken by 360-degree camera. Despite the physical spherical jigsaw, the player, who resides in the perfect center of the globe, assembles triangular-shaped interlocking pieces around him. When complete, this puzzle produces a full-degree panorama all around the player. An example of immersive jigsaw is [[Sitespot]], which also enriches the gaming experience with the scene soundscape and allows pieces to be displayed rotated.\n\nJigsaw puzzles can vary greatly in price depending on the complexity, number of pieces, and brand. Children's puzzles can be as cheap as around $5.00, while larger puzzles can be closer to $50.00. The most expensive puzzle to date was sold for $27,000 in 2005 at a charitable auction for The Golden Retriever Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/most-expensive-jigsaw-puzzle-sold-at-auction/ |title=Most expensive jigsaw puzzle sold at auction |website=Guinness World Records |access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nSeveral word puzzle games use pieces similar to those used in jigsaw puzzles. Examples include [[Alfa-Lek]], [[Jigsaw Words]], [[Nab-It!]], [[Puzzlage]], [[Typ-Dom]], [[Word Jigsaw]], and [[Yottsugo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1028/puzzle |title=Puzzle - Board Game Category - BoardGameGeek |author= |date= |website=boardgamegeek.com |accessdate=31 March 2018}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n== Puzzle pieces ==\n[[Image:Whimsy.JPG|thumb|A \"whimsy\" piece in a wooden jigsaw puzzle]]\n[[Image:3D Jigsaw Puzzle.jpg|thumb|A 3D jigsaw puzzle]]\nMany puzzles are termed \"fully interlocking\". This means that adjacent pieces are connected in such a way that if one piece is moved horizontally, the other pieces move with it, preserving the connection. Sometimes the connection is tight enough to pick up a solved part by holding one piece.\n\nSome fully interlocking puzzles have pieces all of a similar shape, with rounded tabs out on opposite ends, with corresponding blanks cut into the intervening sides to receive the tabs of adjacent pieces. Other fully interlocking puzzles may have tabs and blanks variously arranged on each piece, but they usually have four sides, and the numbers of tabs and blanks thus add up to four. The uniform-shaped fully interlocking puzzles, sometimes called \"Japanese Style\", are the most difficult, because the differences in shapes between pieces can be very subtle. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nMost jigsaw puzzles are square, rectangular, or round, with edge pieces that have one side that is either straight or smoothly curved to create this shape, plus four corner pieces if the puzzle is square or rectangular. Some jigsaw puzzles have edge pieces that are cut just like all the rest of the interlocking pieces, with no smooth edge, to make them more challenging. Other puzzles are designed so the shape of the whole puzzle forms a figure, such as an animal. The edge pieces may vary more in these cases.<!-- {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} --><!--  No citation is required, as the statement merely follows logically from the preceding one; this is no doubt at least partly responsible for the citation request being ignored for 8 years. -->\n\nThe pieces of spherical jigsaw, like immersive panorama jigsaw, can be triangular shaped, according to the rules of tessellation of the geoid primitive.\n\n== World records ==\n=== Largest commercially available jigsaw puzzles ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Pieces!!Name of puzzle!!Company!!Year!!Size [cm]!!Area [m<sup>2</sup>]\n|-\n|52,110||(No title: collage of animals)||MartinPuzzle||2018||696.0 &times; 201.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |14.024\n|-\n|51,300||27 Wonders from Around the World||Kodak||2019||868.7 &times; 190.5||style=\"text-align:right;\" |16.53\n|-\n|48,000||Around the World||Grafika||2017||768.0 &times; 204.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |15.667\n|-\n|42,000||La vuelta al Mundo||Educa||2017||749.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |11.759\n|-\n|40,320||Making Mickey Magic||Ravensburger||2018||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|40,320||Memorable Disney Moments||Ravensburger||2016||680.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |13.056\n|-\n|33,600||Wild Life||Educa||2014||570.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |8.9495\n|-\n|32,256||New York City Window||Ravensburger||2014||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|32,256||Double Retrospect||Ravensburger||2010||544.0 &times; 192.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |10.445\n|-\n|24,000||Life, The greatest puzzle||Educa||2007||428.0 &times; 157.0||style=\"text-align:right;\" |6.720\n|}\nThe world's largest commercially available jigsaw puzzle (Nov. 2018) is produced by [[Czech Republic|Czech]] company MartinPuzzle and contains 52,110 pieces showing a collage of animals.\n\nIn 2016, the German company [[Ravensburger]] released their biggest puzzle.

The problem is as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Suppose a standard 8×8 [[chessboard]] has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 [[dominoes]] of size 2×1 so as to cover all of these squares?</blockquote>\n\nMost considerations of this problem in literature provide solutions \"in the conceptual sense\" without proofs.<ref>{{citation\n| url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/87819.html\n| contribution = On Sets, Types, Fixed Points, and Checkerboards\n| first1 = Peter B. | last1 = Andrews | first2 = Matthew |last2 = Bishop\n| title = Theorem Proving With Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods: 5th International Workshop, Tableaux '96, Terrasini, Palermo, Italy, 15-17th, 1996, Proceedings\n| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n| publisher = Springer-Verlag\n| year = 1996\n| quote = most treatments of the problem in the literature solve it in the conceptual sense, but do not actually provide proofs of the theorem in either of McCarthy's original formulations.\n}}</ref> [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] proposed it as a hard problem for automated proof systems.<ref>{{citation\n| url = http://www.lemma-one.com/ProofPower/examples/wrk071.pdf\n| title = The Mutilated Chessboard Theorem in Z\n| first = R.

A domino placed on the chessboard will always cover one white square and one black square.  Therefore, a collection of dominoes placed on the board will cover an equal numbers of squares of each color.  If the two white corners are removed from the board then 30 white squares and 32 black squares remain to be covered by dominoes, so this is impossible.  If the two black corners are removed instead, then 32 white squares and 30 black squares remain, so it is again impossible.<ref name=\"McCarthy\">{{citation|first=John |last=McCarthy |authorlink=John McCarthy (computer scientist) |contribution=Creative Solutions to Problems |date=1999 | title= AISB Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Creativity|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/creative/creative.html |accessdate=2007-04-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Gomory's theorem==\nThe same impossibility proof shows that no [[domino tiling]] exists whenever any two white squares are removed from the chessboard.

The four pieces are usually one [[isosceles right triangle]], two [[right trapezoid]]s and an irregular shaped [[pentagon]].  Despite its apparent simplicity, it is a surprisingly hard puzzle of which the crux is the positioning of the irregular shaped piece. The earliest T puzzles date from around 1900 and were distributed as promotional giveaways. From the 1920s wooden specimen were produced and made available commercially. At 2015, most T puzzles come with a leaflet with additional figures to be constructed. Which shapes can be formed depends on the relative proportions of the different pieces.\n\n==Origins and early history==\n\n===The Latin Cross===\n[[File:Latin Cross puzzle versus T puzzle.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|The Latin cross puzzle (left) and the T puzzle (right).]]\nThe [[Latin cross]] puzzle consists of a reassembling a five-piece dissection of the cross with three [[isosceles right triangle]]s, one [[right trapezoid]]s and an irregular shaped six-sized piece (see figure).

Each of the 56 different tiles in the set contains three lines, going from one edge of the tile to another.  No two lines on a tile have the same colour.  There are four colours in the set: red, yellow, blue, and green.  No two tiles are identical, and each is individually numbered from 1 through 56.\n\n==Gameplay==\nIn the multiplayer version of the game, each player chooses a colour, so there are between two and four players.  Each draws one tile from the bag, and the person who draws the highest number goes first.\n\n[[File:Essen08 - Tantrix.jpg|thumb|left|Playing ''Tantrix'']]\nEach player then takes five more tiles from the bag, and places all six tiles face up in front of them. The first person plays one tile, usually with their colour on it. Play then rotates [[clockwise]]. After playing a tile, each player takes a replacement tile from the bag, so that they always have six in front of them. Tiles played must match the colour of the edges adjoining it.\n\nWhen three tiles surround an empty space so that it is effectively half covered this is called a ''forced'' space. If the person whose turn it is has a tile that fills that space they must play it. The player repeats this process until there are no more forced spaces that they can fill, at which stage they make a free move, where they can play any tile as long as they don't breach the three restriction rules given below.  Once they have had a free move, they must then fill any more forced spaces that they can. Thus one player's turn can consist of several moves. \n\nThe three restriction rules are:\n{{ordered list|style=list-style-position:inside\n| You cannot create a forced space with the same colour leading into it three times.\n| You cannot create a four-sided forced space.\n| You cannot play along an edge that, when forced spaces are filled, will create a four-sided forced space.\n}}\n\nOnce there are no tiles left in the bag, the three restriction rules do not apply.\n\nThe aim of the game is to get the longest line or loop in your colour.  Each tile in a line counts as one point, and in a loop is two points.  Only the highest-scoring line or loop counts.\n\n===Online play===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TantrixRoom2.png|250px|right|thumb|''Tantrix'' [[Java (language)|Java]] client [[applet]]]] -->\nAlthough quiet and underpopulated compared to the standards of [[Yahoo!]] Games and the like, playing ''Tantrix'' online has gained a dedicated following with players from all over the world competing against each other or against computer robots. Players are rated out of 1000 points according to their wins and losses and taking into account of their opponents rank. The aim of top players is to get to 1000 points (which only three players have managed so far). The goal of a regular player is to reach the score of 950 which is difficult to reach. Once this score has been attained the player can gain Tournament Rankings ([[Elo rating system|ELO]]) and eventually earn the title \"Master\". Masters can then play \"master games\" which have a different scoring system. Only a few players achieve master status, with a limit of 120 total imposed.\n\nSerious players of ''Tantrix'' take part in a number of structured tournaments each year. Although the winners only play for bragging rights, and in the major tournaments a small trophy to keep for a year, these events are taken seriously, and are the ultimate challenge for tantricists.\n\nThe WORLD ''TANTRIX'' CHAMPIONSHIP begins every August, and takes nearly four months to complete. Only 47 competitors took place in the second WTC in 1998, but that number had grown to 200 by 2006. The tournament starts in a qualifying round, where the lower-ranked players compete for selection into the main draw (128-player [[knockout tournament]]).\n\nThere are three other \"world-wide\" tournaments held online each year:\n\n:* The World Team Tantrix Championship (WTTC)  involving teams of five from one country or region, first in held in 2002\n:* The World Junior Tantrix Championship (WJTC)  a world championship for players under 16, first held in 2002\n:* The World Doubles Tantrix Championship (WDTC)  first played in 2005\n\nThere are also three continental tournaments each year:\n\n:* The European Championship (Euro)  the major dedicated continental tournament, first run in 1999\n:* The Pan-American Tantrix Championship (Pan-Am)  first held in 1999\n:* The Afro-Asian Championship (AsAf) the African Championship was first held in 1999 once, then re-established in 2004, incorporating Asian competitors at the same time\n\nAnd many national online tournaments:\n:* The New Zealand Tantrix Championship  first held in 2000\n:* The Australian Tantrix Championship   first held in 2001\n:* The Hungarian Tantrix Championship  first held in 2002\n:* The Hungarian Masters Tournament  first held in 2002\n:* The Swedish Tantrix Championship   first held in 2003\n:* The French Tantrix Championship   first held in 2007\n:* The Dutch Tantrix Championship  first held in 2008\n:* The German Tantrix Championship  first held in 2008\n:* The Spanish Tantrix Championship  first held in 2008\n:* The Polish Tantrix Championship  first held in 2008\n:* The Norwegian Tantrix Championship  first held in 2009\n:* The Czech Tantrix Championship first held in 2010\n\n===Face-to-face play===\nIn addition to these online tournaments, offline tournaments (referred to as 'Table Opens') are growing in popularity. The first Table tournament was the 2002 British Open and was mostly a local affair with 13 of the 14 entrants from Britain. As the player base widened, players started traveling more. Table Opens in Europe soon became the most popular because of the larger playing population.  By 2009 there was enough demand to hold a World Tantrix Open.\n\nWorld Opens\n:* 2014 World Tantrix Table Open (Bischoffen, Germany)[http://www.spiel-tantrix.de/turniere_go2014.php]\n:* 2013 World Tantrix Table Open (Trosa, Sweden)[http://www.tantrix.com/english/tournaments/Tantrix2013WorldOpen.html]\n:* 2011 World Tantrix Table Open (Almere, Netherlands)[http://www.tantrix.com/english/tournaments/Tantrix2011WorldOpen.html]\n:* 2010 World Tantrix Table Open (Budapest, Hungary)[http://www.tantrix.com/english/tournaments/Tantrix2010WorldOpen.html]\n:* 2009 World Tantrix Table Open (Edinburgh, United Kingdom)[http://www.tantrix.com/english/tournaments/Tantrix2009WorldOpen.html]\n\nNational Opens\n:* The British Table Open, first held in 2002\n:* The New Zealand Table Open, first held in 2004\n:* The Swedish Table Open, first held in 2004\n:* The German Table Open, first held in 2005\n:* The French Table Open, first held in 2005\n:* The Spanish Table Open, first held in 2005\n:* The Hungarian Table Open, first held in 2005\n:* The Dutch Table Open, first held in 2006\n:* The Polish Table Open, first held in 2007\n:* The Australian Table Open, first held in 2007\n:* The Israeli Table Open, first held in 2007\n\n==History==\nThe first version of ''Tantrix'' was created by Mike McManaway in 1988 and was called ''Mind Game''[http://www.tantrix.com/english/TantrixHistory.html]. It used 56 cardboard pieces with only two coloured lines, red and black.[http://www.tantrix.com/english/TantrixHistory.html] Owning a games shop, McManaway sold the game directly and following customer feedback continued to change the rules and design. In 1991, the tiles were changed to plastic and two more colours were added, allowing for four-player games.\n\n[[File:Tantrix tiles ryg.svg|thumb|The 16 possible tiles ([[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklaces]]) with the colours red, yellow and green – on the right the triple intersections, which were taken out of the game]]\nThe tiles were (and still are) hand-painted, featuring different colours to those now used, even pink. The early form of the game featured eight \"triple intersections\", but these were found to slow the game play as they only fitted into three different forced spaces (compared to five or six for all other tiles). So in 1993, the triple intersections were removed from the game.<ref>From the [http://www.tantrix.com/english/TantrixUseful.html FAQ on tantrix.com]: So, since triple intersections only have half the chance of being \"forced\", they easily clog up players hands as the game progresses. The negative consequences of this caused the removal of the triple intersection tiles from the game in 1993. </ref>\n\nAlong with the multiplayer version of the game, McManaway created smaller [[solitaire]] puzzles using 10 or 12 tiles that required the player to put the tiles together to create loops of certain colours.\n\nMcManaway has also created many [[solitaire]] puzzles, including 3-D versions, match only versions (requiring players to colour match tiles within a confined space) and loop and line versions (requiring players to use all the nominated tiles to complete a loop or line in a specific colour). However many of the editions are no longer available.\n\nThe main versions sold in most countries are:\n\n#{{italics correction|''Tantrix Discovery''}}: A solo version, where players attempt puzzles that take between 30 seconds and 45 minutes.\n#{{italics correction|''Tantrix Solitaire''}}: A set of 14 tiles designed to play ''Tantrix Solitaire'' combined with expanded ''Tantrix Discovery'' puzzles.\n#{{italics correction|''Tantrix Match''}}: ''Tantrix'' meets sudoku.

Williams</ref>  It is perhaps therefore surprising that companies who produce games and puzzles have been slow to exploit the commercial opportunities afforded by so many enthusiasts who require something on which to construct their jigsaws along with methods of storing and displaying them.\n\nThe first references to any kind of jigsaw puzzle accessory can be found around 1900 when a \"Frame\" was first included in Dutch jigsaw puzzle boxes<ref>''Piece By Piece'' by Betsy and Geert Bekkering</ref> so that a completed puzzle could be permanently saved.  The idea was not successful and was soon discontinued.  A similar fate befell the mahogany and walnut \"Puzzle Trays\" that were advertised in ''Viking's Picture Puzzle Weekly'' in America during the 1930s<ref>''Leisure in the Great Depression'' by Anne D. Williams</ref>\n\nIn the late 1980s, Falcon Games in England decided to tackle the intellectual property issue by route of applying for a [[trademark]] and on 4 August 1989 their self-explanatory Jigroll name was registered (UK Patent Office Reference 1318441).  Although many companies have since copied the functionality of the Jigroll, none have been able to give their products the same name and in jigsaw puzzle parlance \"Jigroll\" has almost become a generic term for all jigsaw mats and rolls.\n\nFalcon enjoyed similar success with the \"Porta Puzzle\" mark registered on 9 March 1993 (UK Patent Office Reference 1528876) for \"Folders and cases made of plastics and/or card for holding and carrying jigsaw puzzles\".  Since the registration of this mark there have been a number of innovations and improvements to the original design, both by the current owners of the mark <ref>Hausemann & Hötte BV, Netherlands</ref> and other companies, but collectively carrying cases for jigsaw puzzles are still most often referred to as \"Porta Puzzles\".\n\nJigsaw puzzle frames in which a completed puzzle can be displayed have never been very popular in either Europe or the US, but this is not the case in Japan where the customary use of jigsaws is for wall decoration.  From the time that jigsaws first became available in Japan, in the 1970s,<ref>[http://imaginatorium.org/shop/yanoman.htm Imaginatorium Japanese Jigsaws]</ref> jigsaw frames have been available to fit the jigsaw sizes of all the leading manufacturers.\n\n==Modern jigsaw puzzle accessories==\n\nIllustrated below are the most widely used modern products.  Most of the accessories come in a range of sizes to cater for jigsaw puzzles between 500 and 2,000 pieces with the 1,000-piece size being the most popular.\n\n===Stand-alone construction tray===\n\nConstruction trays are the most basic of all jigsaw puzzle accessories and they come in many different materials.  Sizes required for different piece counts are as follows:<br />\n500 pieces: 520&nbsp;mm x 395&nbsp;mm (20.4\" x 15.5\")<br />  \n1000 pieces: Approximately 750&nbsp;mm x 520&nbsp;mm (29.5\" x 20.4\")<br />\n1500 pieces: Approximately 915&nbsp;mm x 660&nbsp;mm (36.0\" x 26.0\")<br />\n2000 pieces: Approximately 1016&nbsp;mm x 711&nbsp;mm (40\" x 28\")\n\nThe major problem with stand alone construction trays is that they cannot be packed away and stored with a part-assembled jigsaw. However, they can very easily be moved around from place to place in a home - the only functionality required by many people.\n\n===Roll-up mat===\n\n[[Image:Jigsaw Puzzle Accessory Jigroll.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jigroll The first accessory to obtain a trademark.]]\n\nLaunched in 1989, the Jigroll was the forerunner of modern jigsaw puzzle accessories.  The jigsaw puzzle is constructed on a green cloth that has a coarse texture to which cardboard jigsaw pieces adhere. The non assembled pieces are also kept on the cloth.  When the puzzle needs to be cleared away the entire cloth is rolled around a drum thus keeping both the assembled and non-assembled pieces trapped in position until the cloth is unrolled again.\n\n===Portfolio case===\n\nPortapuzzle obtained a registered trade mark for Falcon Games approximately 4 years after their successful launch of Jigroll (see above).  A portfolio case opens out to reveal a foam-backed lining.  The puzzle is constructed on one side of the case and the unassembled pieces are kept either on the other side of the case or on \"Panels\" provided.  When closed up the foam-backed lining on either side of the case exerts enough pressure to keep the jigsaw pieces in place. \n\nThis invention is generally considered to be a safer way of keeping pieces in place but it involves more material and more assembly labour than a Jigroll and is consequently more expensive.\n\n===Portfolio case with separate construction tray===\n\n[[Image:Jigsaw Puzzle Accessory Jigsort.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jigsort Puzzles are made on a separate \"Construction Tray\".]]\n\nThe outer carrying case holds a separate \"Construction Tray\" on which the jigsaw is made and \"Sort Trays\" on which the unassembled pieces are kept.  The sort trays come complete with tightly fitting lids.  To pack away the jigsaw the sort trays (with their lids in place) are fitted inside the construction tray and the whole is then zipped up inside the carrying case.\n\n  \nThe separate construction tray is very light and can easily be moved around and an additional benefit is the raised edge around the outside of the tray that ensures pieces do not drop off and get lost.  On the downside, the extra component parts add to the retail price.\n\n===Nesting boxes for unassembled pieces===\n\n[[Image:Jigsaw Puzzle Accessory Jigsafe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jigsafe Up to 1,000 jigsaw puzzle pieces are neatly displayed.]]\n\nThe loose pieces of a jigsaw take up approximately twice the space of a completed puzzle and these nesting boxes aim to solve the problem of how best to store 1,000 loose pieces in a small area.  The boxes can be used for sorting different shapes or colours of piece. Each box has a removable insert so that sections of the puzzle can be constructed in the box and then easily moved to the developing jigsaw.\n\n===Jigsaw puzzle frames===\n\n[[Image:Jigsaw Puzzle Accessory Jigframe.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jigframe Enables puzzles to be hung on a wall.]]\n\nTraditionally (especially in Japan) jigsaw puzzles that are hung on a wall are glued onto a backing board. Once glued, it is a simple process to fit a puzzle into a frame in much the same way as a picture is fitted in a picture frame. However, gluing a puzzle to a board renders it unusable in the future as a puzzle.  Products like the Jigframe resolve this issue with a shallow drawer incorporated into the frame that allows jigsaws to be framed without the use of glue. \n\n===Storage cases===\n\n[[Image:Jigsaw Puzzle Accessory Jigstore.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Jigstore Puzzles can be stored in their completed state.]]\n\nThe product comes with 10 cardboard sheets on which completed puzzles are stored.  The puzzles along with their cardboard sheets are stacked on top of each other in the manner of a multi-tiered sandwich.  Ultimately the entire sandwich is held together with straps that are provided and then the whole is stored in an outer cardboard case. \n\nThis accessory is most suitable for dedicated enthusiasts, schools and clubs where there is a requirement to keep and display completed puzzles.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Jigsaw puzzles]]"

This generous sum enabled him to start a business, which at that time was called The International Card Co. Trading from offices in Aldersgate Street, he supplied retailers with a range of products including card games and postcards; an unlikely combination these days, but back then, most towns would have a number of stationers in the High Street and they became Harry Percy's first customers.\nThe International Card business was sold to the [[De La Rue]] Company and H. P. Gibson & Sons Limited was formed in 1919. The International Series brand continued to be used on some products right up to the early 1980s, but H P Gibson & Sons Ltd made its name with the ‘HPG’ brand of indoor games, with old favourites such as L’Attaque and Dover Patrol; huge sellers before and after the Second World War. Sadly the company's premises, along with all its manufacturing equipment were destroyed during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]] in 1940 and when the war ended, it was almost a case of starting from scratch.\nRobert and Harry Gibson (jnr.), sons of the founder, re-established trading from Barrett Street in London's West End. The company continued to sell its own family games and pastimes, alongside ranges from other established names, including Waddingtons and Chad Valley.\n1966 Harry Percy's grandson, Michael Gibson joined the family business. He remembers his father paying him £11.00 a week out of which he had to pay his mother living expenses. In the late 70s H P Gibson & Sons shortened its name to ‘Gibsons’, and shortly after, in the early 80s, Gibsons introduced their first jigsaw puzzles.<ref>https://gibsonsgames.co.uk/our-story</ref>\n\nGibsons originally had only six puzzle pictures in the range which depicted aerial shots of well-known British landmarks, but nowadays, the range has grown to over 250 titles, running from 2 to 2000 pieces, with over 50 new jigsaw puzzle images added every year.\n\n==Notable Products-==\n* Jigsaw Puzzles (mostly hand drawn art, ranging from 2 to 2000 pieces)\n* Board Games\n** 221b Baker Street\n** [[Aviation (game)]] (aerial version of L'Attaque) \n** [[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]\n** [[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]\n** [[Dover Patrol (game)]] (naval version of L'Attaque) \n** [[Hare and Tortoise]]\n** [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]]\n** [[Stratego|L'Attaque]]\n** Mission Earth\n** [[Snakes and Ladders]]\n* Pass the Bomb\n* Pass the Pud\n* [[Piatnik]] Playing Card Range\n* ''My World'' Children's Educational Games\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Board game publishing companies]]\n[[Category:Jigsaw puzzle manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1919]]\n[[Category:Design companies established in 1919]]\n[[Category:1919 establishments in England]]"

      "text": "'''Jumbo Games''' is a Dutch founded [[jigsaw puzzle]] and games company which was established in 1853 and is owned by M&R de Monchy N.V. Jumbo Games produce and manufacture all of their jigsaw puzzles and cardboard based games in their own factory that is based in the [[Netherlands]]. The Jumbo head office is located in the Netherlands and there are also offices in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Germany]] and [[Belgium]].<ref>http://www.jumbo.eu</ref>\n\nPrevious to being known as Jumbo games in the UK, the company was called Falcon Games and this was the [[brand name]] given to its range of adult puzzles. Falcon was established in 1976 and Jumbo is often still referred to as by the Falcon brand name in the UK.\n\n==History==\n\nThe origins of the firm can be traced to the Hausemann & Hotte partnership in the mid-nineteenth century between the Amsterdam department store owner Engelbert Hausemann, a German, and Wilhelm Hotte, who together imported games and puzzles into the Netherlands.\n\nAfter the First World War, Hausemann & Hotte expanded their range of toys and games. This included the [[Meccano]] metal construction kits, Continental Caoutchouc rubber balls, dolls’ prams by Heinrichmaier & Wunsch, ‘Jutta’dolls by Dressel, Emata slates, Hohner [[mouth organ]]s, cars and figurines by Lehmann and Spears games.\n\nDuring the inter-war years, Hausemann & Hotte commissioned wooden toys by the Mauritz en Ball company of Zeist. These toys had to be made to be strong enough \"that a wooden [[elephant]] could stand on them\". These toys were sold under the Jumbo brand name. This was the birth of the elephant brand.\n\nAfter the Second World War, production was difficult and imports had ceased. Hausemann & Hotte began to have their own games made by local manufacturers with readily available sturdy cardboard. The elephant as a symbol of the products’ strength continued to be used.\n\nIn 1950 Hausemann & Hotte created De Netherlandse Spellenfabriek B.V. (NSF for short), their own cardboard factory, in order to break their dependence on other manufacturers and assure optimum quality. As the decade progressed, the firm introduced the game Electro, puzzles and the classic board game [[Stratego]], which was launched in America, with great success. It was made in America under license for Hausemann & Hotte by [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]].\n\nThis Americal link continued when Hausemann & Hotte brought the [[Barbie]] doll to the Netherlands.\n\nFrom 1967, as the market for games was experiencing massive growth, Hausemann & Hotte ceased all imports and concentrated exclusively on its own brand, Jumbo. After this time both warehouse and production relocated to Wognum.\n\nIn 1980 [[:nl:Jan van Haasteren|Jan van Haasteren]] started drawing his famous jigsaw puzzles for Jumbo. Forty percent of all puzzles made by Jumbo are now Jan van Haasteren puzzles. In 1997 the quirky [[Wasgij Jigsaw Puzzles|Wasgij]] jigsaw puzzle was introduced. Wasgij is jigsaw spelt backwards. Wasgij is drawn by the artist Graham Thompson, who has been producing puzzles for Jumbo for many years.<ref>http://www.wasgij.com</ref>\n\n==Games produced==\n\nJumbo Games’ adult portfolio consists of Wasgij, Falcon de luxe, [[:nl:Jan van Haasteren|Jan van Haasteren]], Things we Love to Hate, [[Coronation Street]], [[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]] and many more.\n\nThe Children’s puzzles and games licenses consist of [[Peppa Pig]], [[Everything's Rosie]], Little Kingdom, [[Fireman Sam]], [[Disney]] and many more.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.jumbo.eu/ jumbo.eu]\n\n[[Category:Toy companies of the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Jigsaw puzzle manufacturers]]"

He began publishing in 1883 with his first author contract.  He started publishing instruction folders for craftsmen and architects, which soon acquired him a solid financial basis. His first board game appeared in 1884, named \"Journey around the world\".\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, his product line broadened to include picture books, books, children’s activity books, Art Instruction manuals, non-fiction books, and reference books as well as children’s games, Happy Families and activity kits.  In 1900, the Ravensburger blue triangle [[trademark]] was registered with the Imperial [[Patent office]].  As of 1912, many [[board game|board]] and [[game of physical skill|activity games]] had an export version that was distributed to [[Western Europe]], the countries of the [[Danube Monarchy]] as well as [[Russia]].\n\nBefore the [[First World War]], Ravensburger had around 800 products.  The publishing house was damaged during the [[Second World War]] and continued to produce games in the years of the reconstruction.  The company focused on children's games and books and specialized books for art, architecture and hobbies, and from 1962 grew strongly.  The company started to produce jigsaw puzzle games in 1964, and in the same year opened subsidiaries in [[Austria]], [[France]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]].  In 1977 the company split into a book publishing arm and a game publishing arm.\n\nToday there are approximately 1,800 available books and 850 games as well as puzzles, hobby products and [[CD-ROM]] titles at Ravensburger and its subsidiaries, which include '''Alea''' for \"hobby and ardent game players\" and '''FX Schmid''' for games and children's books.  Ravensburger products are exported to more than fifty countries. Ravensburger also expanded to video games in the late 1990s by forming [[Ravensburger Interactive]], which they sold in May 2002 to [[JoWooD Productions]].\n\nIn September 2010, Ravensburger broke Educa's record for the world's largest jigsaw puzzle of 24,000 pieces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zimbio.com/Jigsaw+puzzle/articles/gHoeUwlTE3N/NEW+World+Largest+Jigsaw+Puzzle+32000+Pieces |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011160237/http://www.zimbio.com/Jigsaw+puzzle/articles/gHoeUwlTE3N/NEW+World+Largest+Jigsaw+Puzzle+32000+Pieces |archivedate=2012-10-11 |df= }}</ref>  Ravensburger's new puzzle design by late pop artist [[Keith Haring]] titled, \"Keith Haring: Double Retrospect\" breaks the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] measuring 17' × 6' (5.18 m x 1.82 m) built from 32,256 pieces and comes with its own dolly cart for toting.

However, in the center of the puzzle, or in other separate areas, holes are left into which many pieces have to fit. These pieces may be silhouettes of shapes that are representative of objects, people, animals, etc. It's not apparent how they fit together in the holes of the puzzle until they are played with and studied.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe difficult rating system for Teasers is measured on a scale of one to four swords, with four swords being the most difficult.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:Stave Teaser Puzzle.jpg|alt=Stave Teaser Puzzle, Bubbles, Four Sword difficulty, 120 pieces, Artist: Dee Rogers|thumb|Stave Teaser Puzzle, [https://www.stavepuzzles.com/product/bubbles/ Bubbles], Four Sword difficulty, 120 pieces, Artist: Dee Rogers ]]\n\n=== Trick puzzles ===\nSteve Richardson earned the name Chief Tormentor for inventing the Trick puzzle,<ref>\n{{Cite news\n| last =Stoodley\n| first =Sheila Gibson\n| publication-date =November 2006\n| title =Collectibles: Piece Maker\n| periodical =Robb Report\n| publication-place =\n| publisher =CurtCo Robb Media, LLC\n| issue =November 2006\n| url =http://www.robbreport.com/archived-issues/Article.aspx?article=12353\n| issn =\n| doi =\n| oclc =|accessdate 2008-04-29=\n| postscript =\n}}\n\n</ref> a puzzle genre in which some pieces fit in two or more different places, but only one of the solutions is considered correct.

A typical limited edition has included only 50 units, although some runs have included as many as 100 units.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe four main types of limited edition puzzles include: Double Deckers; Riddle; Mystery Story; and Trick. Some of the limited edition puzzles are hand painted (as opposed to a print affixed to the wood).{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nIn general, the limited editions also include items that fit the theme and help guide the player through the puzzle and additional games. For example, the Limited Edition Trick Puzzle ''Time Traveler'' comes with several hand crafted booklets to link the puzzle to the time-travel theme underlying the puzzle. The theme of the puzzle is major events (cultural, historical, scientific discoveries, etc.) from 1000 CE to 2000 CE. The booklets guide you through untangling a set of chronological mishaps caused by an evildoer.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Double deckers''': Double decker puzzles are made up of multiple layers that sit on top of one another. Irregular edges and dropouts highlight the imagery in interesting ways. Some double decker puzzles include very simple tricks—swappable image areas. For example, the [[Snow White]] limited edition allows you to swap [[Queen (Snow White)|the Evil Queen]] and Snow White in the mirror.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Riddle puzzles''': Riddle puzzles are accompanied by a book of riddles, [[word game]]s, and other surprises linked to the puzzle. For example, figural pieces in the puzzle might form a [[rebus]] that must be solved.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Mystery story''': Each puzzle is accompanied by a complete mystery novel. However, you do not learn the ending of the mystery until you send in your answer to Stave's \"mystery hot line.\" For example, the limited edition Hexed has artwork by Andrea Farnham and a novel by Susan Stofflet. The puzzle comes in sections enclosed in velvet bags that you do in pieces as you read and solve parts of the mystery.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''Trick''': The limited edition trick puzzles are similar in general challenge types to the other trick puzzles sold by Stave. The main difference is greater theming and integration. Taking Time Traveler as an example, the entire puzzle has a theme, and solving the tricks and re-arranging the pieces is linked to a story and learning about history. Other puzzles such as Knight at Stavely Castle include 3D pop-ups such as an entire castle façade that goes together multiple ways and a 3D sword that you need to remove from a stone.<ref name=\"cigar\" /> These trick puzzles are thus more intense than the generally available trick puzzles because of the themed linking between the puzzle and accompanying materials.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\n'''List of Limited Editions and statuses'''\n\nSome of the Limited Editions which have been released by Stave include:<ref>Status approximate as of 19 May 2008; list based on Stave Limited Edition advertising mailed in Dec 2007 combined with phone call with Stave to obtain statuses on 19 May 2008.</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Wires Singing Telegrams) and Sandra Schaeffer Bergeson (former soprano with the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the NYC Opera). TDC is a regular exhibitor at Toy Fair in New York City each year, with products distributed internationally.\n\n===Games===\nThe first game in the TDC Line was called \"Adultrivia.\"They have since produced such hit games as \"[[Dirty Minds]]\", \"The Jerry Springer Game\"NFL Opoly\", \"Reminiscing\", \"ManLaws & Woman Rules\" and the Campbell's Alphabet Dice Game. Most, but not all, of the games, produced by TDC have been conversation/party games with a hint of adult content. Other more family oriented additions have been titles such as \"Chess for Dummies,\", \"Senior Moments\" and \"MLB Card Games & Puzzles\". In 2011 their title \"Campbell's Alphabet Dice Game\" won the National Parenting Center Preferred Choice Award and the Tilliwig Best Family Fun Award.\n\n===Puzzles===\nTDC did not enter the puzzle world until the late 1990s, with a series called \"The Alphabet Murder Mystery Puzzles\". All of the TDC puzzles have some sort of gimmick. For example, \"Portable Puzzles\" include a puzzle roll-up in each box. \"Puzzles for Dummies\" have numbered pieces and a grid to help put it all together, while \"Visible Puzzles\" have big pieces and a magnifying glass for the vision impaired. TDC also added a line of mini jigsaw puzzles w/timy pieces and tweezers to help assemble.\nThe most memorable puzzle in the TDC line has been \"LOST\". Based on the incredibly popular hit TV show on ABC, the \"LOST\" puzzles consist of four 1000 piece puzzles with secret information about the show hidden inside. In 2011, and in keeping with the \"gimmicks\", TDC added a line of Major League Baseball mini puzzles (which include tweezers) and pennant shaped jigsaw puzzles suitable for framing.\n\n===AWARDS===\n2000 Make Your Own Opoly: Hobby Outlook Educational Item of the Year Award\n2007 \"Fat Brain Award\"\n2011 Campbell's Alphabet Dice Game: The National Parenting Center Seal of Approval & The Tilliwig Best Family Fun Award\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tdc Games}}\n[[Category:Companies based in DuPage County, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Toy companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Itasca, Illinois]]\n[[Category:Jigsaw puzzle manufacturers]]"

It was founded in 1994 by Kevin Wentworth Preston and is based in the village of Pinkney near [[Malmesbury]], [[Wiltshire]], an area of England known as the [[Cotswolds]].\n\n== Company history ==\nThe venture was established on an existing dairy farm which was forced to diversify into other sources of income when milk production became uneconomical to sustain. Some of the old buildings were converted into industrial use, and the farm became an industrial estate housing many other traders, as well as the new puzzle enterprise.<ref name=\"paper\"/>\n\n===Technology===\nTraditionally jigsaws are manufactured using a thin flexible cutting blade driven by a motor known as a [[bandsaw]]. This method of cutting thin wood requires a degree of manual dexterity and patience to avoid spoiling the work. An alternative solution to this labour-intensive method of cutting intricate shapes in wood was required using modern technology solutions. The advent of the commercial medium-power [[Laser]] device has enabled many industries to use this tool to cut many different types of material speedily. The puzzle-manufacturing process uses a laser-cutting method invented and perfected by the founder, Kevin Wentworth Preston, in 1994.\n\nWentworth production can now focus on the quality of manufacture and design innovation that this new tooling provides. The high-speed production technique allows the small company to supply in excess of 150,000 puzzles a year to destinations in over 35 countries throughout the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3007845.stm|title=Our firms are crying out for broadband|publisher=BBC news 2003|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=7 May 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe design team produces each cutout style individually, most of the designs are unique \"whimsy\" jigsaw shapes. [[Whimsies]] are specially shaped pieces cut into puzzles \"on a whim\" by [[Victorian-era]] hand cutters, an era when jigsaw puzzles became a popular pastime. Wentworth retained this older style of manufacture, and is one of the remaining companies still producing puzzles using these Victorian techniques.<ref name=\"paper\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-final-piece-of-the-jigsaw-1168860.html|title=The final piece of the Jigsaw|publisher=The Independent 1 August 1998|accessdate=1 March 2011|location=London|first=Duff|last=Hart-Davis|date=1 August 1998}}</ref>\n\n== 'Whimsy pieces' ==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Whimsy pieces.jpg|right|thumb|Example of 'whimsical' pieces within the puzzles]] -->\nThe ‘Whimsy’ laser-cut wooden puzzles feature unique, individual, “whimsical” cut-out shapes that reflect the theme of the image used on the face of the puzzle. All puzzles are supplied in a cotton draw-string bag within a lidded box. These wooden puzzles are cut from 3mm thick wooden boards (as opposed to softer cardboard) to ensure they will survive the rigours of use for a very long time. Puzzles are supplied to the customer with the option of an image of the puzzle's subject matter printed on the box. With no reference image there is the added difficulty of assembling the pieces into the correct pattern, and the element of surprise concerning the subject matter when the puzzle's image is reassembled.\n\n* Manufacture: 3mm wooden board derived from sustainable managed forests.\n* Features: rarely include corner pieces or two pieces of the same shape.\n* 'whimsical' shapes: which reflect the theme of the image in all standard puzzles.\n* Packaging: a cloth bag inside a sturdy box made from recycled material.\n\n==Styles==\n\n=== Traditional puzzles ===\n\nAll traditional puzzles include the unique whimsy pieces.

      "text": "{{about|geometric packing problems|numerical packing problems|Knapsack problem}}\n{{Covering/packing-problem pairs}}\n{{Puzzles |topics}}\n\n'''Packing problems''' are a class of [[optimization problem]]s in [[mathematics]] that involve attempting to pack objects together into containers. The goal is to either pack a single container as densely as possible or pack all objects using as few containers as possible. Many of these problems can be related to real life [[packaging]], storage and transportation issues. Each packing problem has a dual [[covering problem]], which asks how many of the same objects are required to completely cover every region of the container, where objects are allowed to overlap.\n\nIn a [[bin packing problem]], you are given:\n* 'containers' (usually a single two- or three-dimensional convex region, or an infinite space)\n* A set of 'objects'  some or all of which must be packed into one or more containers. The set may contain different objects with their sizes specified, or a single object of a fixed dimension that can be used repeatedly.\n\nUsually the packing must be without overlaps between goods and other goods or the container walls. In some variants, the aim is to find the configuration that packs a single container with the maximal density. More commonly, the aim is to pack all the objects into as few containers as possible.<ref>{{cite journal|authors= Lodi, A., Martello, S., Monaci, M.|title = Two-dimensional packing problems: A survey| journal = European Journal of Operational Research|year = 2002|publisher = Elsevier|doi=10.1016/s0377-2217(02)00123-6|volume=141|pages=241–252}}</ref>  In some variants the overlapping (of objects with each other and/or with the boundary of the container) is allowed but should be minimized.\n\n==Packing infinite space==\nMany of these problems, when the container size is increased in all directions, become equivalent to the problem of packing objects as densely as possible in infinite [[Euclidean space]].

The related [[circle packing]] problem deals with packing circles, possibly of different sizes, on a surface, for instance the plane or a sphere.\n\nThe [[N-sphere|counterparts of a circle]] in other dimensions can never be packed with complete efficiency in [[dimensions]] larger than one (in a one-dimensional universe, the circle analogue is just two points). That is, there will always be unused space if you are only packing circles. The most efficient way of packing circles, [[Circle packing|hexagonal packing]], produces approximately 91% efficiency.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CirclePacking.html</ref>\n\n===Sphere packings in higher dimensions===\n{{Main|Sphere packing}}\n\nIn three dimensions, [[Close-packing of spheres|close-packed]] structures offer the best ''lattice'' packing of spheres, and is believed to be the optimal of all packings. With 'simple' sphere packings in three dimensions ('simple' being carefully defined) there are nine possible defineable packings.<ref>Smalley, I.J. 1963. Simple regular sphere packings in three dimensions. Mathematics Magazine 36, 295-299. doi:10.2307/2688954</ref> The 8-dimensional [[E8 lattice]] and 24-dimensional [[Leech lattice]] have also been proven to be optimal in their respective real dimensional space.\n\n===Packings of Platonic solids in three dimensions===\nCubes can easily be arranged to fill three-dimensional space completely, the most natural packing being the [[cubic honeycomb]]. No other [[Platonic solid]] can tile space on its own, but some preliminary results are known. [[Tetrahedron packing|Tetrahedra]] can achieve a packing of at least 85%. One of the best packings of regular [[dodecahedron|dodecahedra]] is based on the aforementioned face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice.\n\nTetrahedra and octahedra together can fill all of space in an arrangement known as the [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The rectangular cuboids to be packed can be rotated by 90 degrees on each axis.\n\n===Spheres into a Euclidean ball===\nThe problem of finding the smallest ball such that <math>k</math> disjoint open unit balls may be packed inside it has a simple and complete answer in <math>n</math>-dimensional Euclidean space if <math>\\scriptstyle k\\leq n+1</math>, and in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space with no restrictions. It is worth describing in detail here, to give a flavor of the general problem. In this case, a configuration of <math>k</math> pairwise tangent unit balls is available. Place the centers at the vertices <math>a_1,..,a_k</math> of a regular <math>\\scriptstyle(k-1)</math> dimensional simplex with edge 2; this is easily realized starting from an orthonormal basis. A small computation shows that the distance of each vertex from the barycenter is <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{2\\big(1-\\frac{1}{k} \\big)}</math>. Moreover, any other point of the space necessarily has a larger distance from ''at least'' one of the <math>\\scriptstyle k</math> vertices. In terms of inclusions of balls, the <math>\\scriptstyle k</math> open unit balls centered at <math>\\scriptstyle a_1,..,a_k</math> are included in a ball of radius <math>\\scriptstyle r_k:=1+\\sqrt{2\\big(1-\\frac{1}{k}\\big)}</math>, which is minimal for this configuration.\n\nTo show that this configuration is optimal, let <math>\\scriptstyle x_1,...,x_k</math> be the centers of <math>\\scriptstyle k</math> disjoint open unit balls contained in a ball of radius <math>\\scriptstyle r</math> centered at a point <math>\\scriptstyle x_0</math>. Consider the map from the finite set <math>\\scriptstyle\\{x_1,..x_k\\}</math> into <math>\\scriptstyle\\{a_1,..a_k\\}</math> taking  <math>\\scriptstyle x_j</math> in the corresponding <math>\\scriptstyle a_j</math> for each <math>\\scriptstyle 1\\leq j\\leq k</math>. Since for all <math>\\scriptstyle 1\\leq i<j\\leq k</math>, <math>\\scriptstyle \\|a_i-a_j\\|=2\\leq\\|x_i-x_j\\|</math> this map is 1-Lipschitz and by the [[Kirszbraun theorem]] it extends to a 1-Lipschitz map that is globally defined; in particular, there exists a point <math>\\scriptstyle a_0</math> such that for all <math>\\scriptstyle1\\leq j\\leq k</math> one has <math>\\scriptstyle\\|a_0-a_j\\|\\leq\\|x_0-x_j\\|</math>, so that also <math>\\scriptstyle r_k\\leq1+\\|a_0-a_j\\|\\leq 1+\\|x_0-x_j\\|\\leq r</math>. This shows that there are <math>\\scriptstyle k</math> disjoint unit open balls in a ball of radius <math>\\scriptstyle r</math> if and only if <math>\\scriptstyle r\\geq r_k</math>. Notice that in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space this implies that there are infinitely many disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius <math>\\scriptstyle r</math> if and only if <math>\\scriptstyle r\\geq 1+\\sqrt{2}</math>. For instance, the unit balls centered at <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{2}e_j</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle\\{e_j\\}_j</math> is an orthonormal basis, are disjoint and included in a ball of radius <math>\\scriptstyle 1+\\sqrt{2}</math> centered at the origin. Moreover, for <math>\\scriptstyle r<1+\\sqrt{2}</math>, the maximum number of disjoint open unit balls inside a ball of radius r is <math>\\scriptstyle\\big\\lfloor \\frac{2}{2-(r-1)^2}\\big\\rfloor</math>.\n\n===Spheres in a cuboid===\nDetermine the number of [[sphere|spherical]] objects of given diameter ''d'' that can be packed into a [[cuboid]] of {{nowrap|size ''a'' × ''b'' × ''c''}}.\n\n===Identical spheres in a cylinder===\nDetermine the minimum height ''h'' of a cylinder with given radius ''R'' that will pack ''n'' identical spheres of radius ''r'' (< ''R'').<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-3995.2009.00733.x| title = Packing identical spheres into a cylinder| journal = International Transactions in Operational Research| volume = 17| pages = 51–70| year = 2010| last1 = Stoyan | first1 = Y.

Hexagonal close-packing would result in a six-sided pyramid with a hexagonal base. \n[[File:Snowpyramids.jpg|thumb| Snowballs stacked in preparation for a [[snowball fight]]. The front pyramid is hexagonal close-packed and rear is face-centered cubic. ]]\n\nThe [[cannonball problem]] asks which flat square arrangements of cannonballs can be stacked into a square pyramid. [[Édouard Lucas]] formulated the problem as the [[Diophantine equation]] <math>\\sum_{n=1}^{N} n^2 = M^2</math> or <math>\\frac{1}{6} N(N+1)(2N+1) = M^2</math> and conjectured that the only solutions are <math>N = 1, M = 1,</math> and <math>N = 24, M = 70</math>.

For every sphere there is one gap surrounded by six spheres (octahedral) and two smaller gaps surrounded by four spheres (tetrahedral). The distances to the centers of these gaps from the centers of the surrounding spheres is {{sqrt|{{frac|3|2}}}} for the tetrahedral, and {{sqrt|2}} for the octahedral, when the sphere radius is 1.\n\nRelative to a reference layer with positioning A, two more positionings B and C are possible. Every sequence of A, B, and C without immediate repetition of the same one is possible and gives an equally dense packing for spheres of a given radius.\n\nThe most regular ones are\n*fcc = ABC ABC ABC... (every third layer is the same)\n*hcp = AB AB AB AB... (every other layer is the same).\n\nThere is an uncountably infinite number of disordered arrangements of planes (e.g. ABCACBABABAC...) that are sometimes collectively referred to as \"Barlow packings\", after crystallographer [[William Barlow (geologist)|William Barlow]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Barlow, William|title=Probable Nature of the Internal Symmetry of Crystals|journal=Nature|year=1883|volume=29|issue=738|pages=186–188|doi=10.1038/029186a0|bibcode=1883Natur..29..186B}}</ref>\n\nIn close-packing, the center-to-center spacing of spheres in the ''xy'' plane is a simple honeycomb-like tessellation with a pitch (distance between sphere centers) of one sphere diameter.

Note how adjacent balls along each edge of the regular [[tetrahedron]] enclosing the stack are all in direct contact with one another. This does not occur in an hcp lattice, as shown in ''Figure&nbsp;2''.\n|}\n\n==Lattice generation==\nWhen forming any sphere-packing lattice, the first fact to notice is that whenever two spheres touch a straight line may be drawn from the center of one sphere to the center of the other intersecting the point of contact. The distance between the centers along the shortest path namely that straight line will therefore be ''r''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''r''<sub>2</sub> where ''r''<sub>1</sub> is the radius of the first sphere and ''r''<sub>2</sub> is the radius of the second. In close packing all of the spheres share a common radius, ''r''. Therefore two centers would simply have a distance 2''r''.\n\n===Simple hcp lattice===\n[[Image:Animated-HCP-Lattice.gif|thumbnail=Animated-HCP-Lattice-Thumbnail.gif|An animation of close-packing lattice generation. Note: If a third layer (not shown) is directly over the first layer, then the HCP lattice is built. If the third layer is placed over holes in the first layer, then the FCC lattice is created.]]\n\nTo form an A-B-A-B-... hexagonal close packing of spheres, the coordinate points of the lattice will be the spheres' centers. Suppose, the goal is to fill a box with spheres according to hcp. The box would be placed on the [[Cartesian coordinate system|''x''-''y''-''z'' coordinate space]].\n\nFirst form a row of spheres. The centers will all lie on a straight line. Their ''x''-coordinate will vary by 2''r'' since the distance between each center of the spheres are touching is 2''r''. The ''y''-coordinate and z-coordinate will be the same. For simplicity, say that the balls are the first row and that their ''y''- and ''z''-coordinates are simply ''r'', so that their surfaces rest on the zero-planes. Coordinates of the centers of the first row will look like (2''r'',&nbsp;''r'',&nbsp;''r''), (4''r'',&nbsp;''r'',&nbsp;''r''), (6''r''&nbsp;,''r'',&nbsp;''r''), (8''r''&nbsp;,''r'',&nbsp;''r''),&nbsp;...&nbsp;.\n\nNow, form the next row of spheres. Again, the centers will all lie on a straight line with ''x''-coordinate differences of 2''r'', but there will be a shift of distance ''r'' in the ''x''-direction so that the center of every sphere in this row aligns with the ''x''-coordinate of where two spheres touch in the first row. This allows the spheres of the new row to slide in closer to the first row until all spheres in the new row are touching two spheres of the first row. Since the new spheres ''touch'' two spheres, their centers form an equilateral triangle with those two neighbors' centers. The side lengths are all 2''r'', so the height or ''y''-coordinate difference between the rows is {{sqrt|3}}''r''. Thus, this row will have coordinates like this:\n\n: <math>\\left(r, r + \\sqrt{3}r, r\\right),\\ \\left(3r, r + \\sqrt{3}r, r\\right),\\ \\left(5r, r + \\sqrt{3}r, r\\right),\\ \\left(7r, r + \\sqrt{3}r, r\\right), \\dots.</math>\n\nThe first sphere of this row only touches one sphere in the original row, but its location follows suit with the rest of the row.\n\nThe next row follows this pattern of shifting the ''x''-coordinate by ''r'' and the ''y''-coordinate by {{sqrt|3}}. Add rows until reaching the ''x'' and ''y'' maximum borders of the box.\n\nIn an A-B-A-B-... stacking pattern, the odd numbered ''planes'' of spheres will have exactly the same coordinates save for a pitch difference in the ''z''-coordinates and the even numbered ''planes'' of spheres will share the same ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates. Both types of planes are formed using the pattern mentioned above, but the starting place for the ''first'' row's first sphere will be different.\n\nUsing the plane described precisely above as plane #1, the A plane, place a sphere on top of this plane so that it lies touching three spheres in the A-plane. The three spheres are all already touching each other, forming an equilateral triangle, and since they all touch the new sphere, the four centers form a [[tetrahedron|regular tetrahedron]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/sphpack.html |title=on Sphere Packing |publisher=Grunch.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-12}}</ref> All of the sides are equal to 2''r'' because all of the sides are formed by two spheres touching. The height of which or the ''z''-coordinate difference between the two \"planes\" is {{sfrac|{{sqrt|6}}''r''2|3}}. This, combined with the offsets in the ''x'' and ''y''-coordinates gives the centers of the first row in the B plane:\n\n: <math>\\left(r, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(3r, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(5r, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(7r, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right), \\dots. </math>\n\nThe second row's coordinates follow the pattern first described above and are:\n\n: <math>\\left(2r, r + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(4r, r + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(6r, r + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\ \\left(8r,r + \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}r}{3}, r + \\frac{\\sqrt{6}r2}{3}\\right),\\dots. </math>\n\nThe difference to the next plane, the A plane, is again {{sfrac|{{sqrt|6}}''r''2|3}} in the ''z''-direction and a shift in the ''x'' and ''y'' to match those ''x''- and ''y''-coordinates of the first A plane.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname = HexagonalClosePacking|title = Hexagonal Close Packing}}</ref>\n\nIn general, the coordinates of sphere centers can be written as:\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  2i + ((j\\ +\\ k) \\bmod 2)\\\\\n  \\sqrt{3}\\left[j + \\frac{1}{3}(k \\bmod 2)\\right]\\\\\n  \\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{3}k\n\\end{bmatrix}r</math>\n\nwhere ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'' are indices starting at 0 for the ''x''-, ''y''- and ''z''-coordinates.\n\n==Miller indices==\n{{main|Miller index}}\n[[Image:Indices miller bravais.png|thumb|Miller–Bravais index for hcp lattice]]\nCrystallographic features of hcp systems, such as vectors and atomic plane families, can be described using a four-value [[Miller index]] notation ( ''hkil'' ) in which the third index ''i'' denotes a convenient but degenerate component which is equal to −''h''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''k''. The ''h'', ''i'' and ''k'' index directions are separated by 120°, and are thus not orthogonal; the ''l'' component is mutually perpendicular to the ''h'', ''i'' and ''k'' index directions.\n\n== Filling the remaining space ==\nThe fcc and hcp packings are the densest known packings of equal spheres with the highest symmetry (smallest repeat units).\nDenser [[sphere packing]]s are known, but they involve [[sphere packing#Unequal sphere packing|unequal sphere packing]].\nA packing density of 1, filling space completely, requires non-spherical shapes, such as [[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]].\n\nReplacing each contact point between two spheres with an edge connecting the centers of the touching spheres produces tetrahedrons and octahedrons of equal edge lengths.\nThe fcc arrangement produces the [[tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]].\nThe hcp arrangement produces the [[gyrated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb]].\nIf, instead, every sphere is augmented with the points in space that are closer to it than to any other sphere, the duals of these honeycombs are produced: the [[rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]] for fcc, and the [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]] for hcp.\n\nSpherical bubbles in soapy water in a fcc or hcp arrangement, when the water in the gaps between the bubbles drains out, also approach the [[rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]] or [[trapezo-rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]]. However, such fcc or hcp foams of very small liquid content are unstable, as they do not satisfy [[Plateau's laws]]. The [[Kelvin foam]] and the [[Weaire–Phelan structure|Weaire–Phelan foam]] are more stable, having smaller interfacial energy in the limit of a very small liquid content.<ref>{{cite book|title=Foams, Structure and Dynamics|first1=Isabelle|last1=Cantat|first2=Sylvie|last2=Cohen-Addad|first3=Florence|last3=Elias|first4=François|last4=Graner|first5=Reinhard|last5=Höhler|first6=Ruth|last6=Flatman|first7=Olivier|last7=Pitois|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|date=2013|isbn=9780199662890}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cubic crystal system]]\n*[[Hermite constant]]\n*[[Random close pack]]\n*[[Sphere packing]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Highest density sphere packing}}\n*[http://www.iucr.org/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/13254/5.pdf P.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=April 2015}}\nIn [[operations research]], the '''cutting-stock problem''' is the problem of cutting standard-sized pieces of [[Inventory|stock]] material, such as paper rolls or [[sheet metal]], into pieces of specified sizes while minimizing material wasted. It is an [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization problem]] in [[mathematics]] that arises from applications in industry. In terms of [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]], the problem is an [[NP-hard]] problem reducible to the [[knapsack problem]]. The problem can be formulated as an [[integer linear programming]] problem.\n\n== Illustration of one-dimensional cutting-stock problem ==\n\nA paper machine can produce an unlimited number of master (jumbo) rolls, each 5600&nbsp;mm wide. The following 13 items must be cut, in the table below.\n\nThe important thing about this kind of problem is that many different product units can be made from the same master roll, and the number of possible combinations is itself very large, in general, and not trivial to enumerate.\n\nThe problem therefore is to find an optimum set of patterns of making product rolls from the master roll, such that the demand is satisfied and waste is minimized. \n\n::{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! width=\"80pt\" |  Width\n! width=\"80pt\" | #Items\n|-\n| align=center | 1380   || align=center | 22\n|-\n| align=center | 1520   || align=center | 25\n|-\n| align=center | 1560   || align=center | 12\n|-\n| align=center | 1710   || align=center | 14\n|-\n| align=center | 1820   || align=center | 18\n|-\n| align=center | 1880   || align=center | 18\n|-\n| align=center | 1930   || align=center | 20\n|-\n| align=center | 2000   || align=center | 10\n|-\n| align=center | 2050   || align=center | 12\n|-\n| align=center | 2100   || align=center | 14\n|-\n| align=center | 2140   || align=center | 16\n|-\n| align=center | 2150   || align=center | 18\n|-\n| align=center | 2200   || align=center | 20\n|}\n\n===Bounds and checks===\nA simple lower bound is obtained by dividing the total amount of product by the size of each master roll. The total product required is 1380 x 22 + 1520 x 25 + ... + 2200 x 20 = 407160 mm. Each master roll is 5600 mm, requiring a minimum of 72.7 rolls, which means 73 rolls or more are required.\n\n===Solution===\n[[File:CuttingStock.gif|thumb|430px|A minimum-waste solution, sequenced to minimise knife changes, shown as small white circles]]\nThere are 308 possible patterns for this small instance. The optimal answer requires 73 master rolls and has 0.401% waste; it can be shown computationally that in this case the minimum number of patterns with this level of waste is 10. It can also be computed that 19 different such solutions exist, each with 10 patterns and a waste of 0.401%, of which one such solution is shown below and in the picture:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\"\n!Repetition\n!align=center | Contents\n|-\n| align=center | 2 || 1820 + 1820 + 1820\n|-\n| align=center | 3 || 1380 + 2150 + 1930\n|-\n| align=center | 12 || 1380 + 2150 + 2050\n|-\n| align=center | 7 || 1380 + 2100 + 2100\n|-\n| align=center | 12 || 2200 + 1820 + 1560\n|-\n| align=center | 8 || 2200 + 1520 + 1880\n|-\n| align=center | 1 || 1520 + 1930 + 2150\n|-\n| align=center | 16 || 1520 + 1930 + 2140\n|-\n| align=center | 10 || 1710 + 2000 + 1880\n|-\n| style=\"border-bottom:3px solid grey\" align=center | 2 || 1710 + 1710 + 2150\n|-\n|  align=center | '''73'''\n|}\n\n== Classification ==\nCutting-stock problems can be classified in several ways.<ref name=\"Wäscher2007\">Wäscher, G.; Haußner, H.; Schumann, H. ''An Improved Typology of Cutting and Packing Problems''. European Journal of Operational Research Volume 183, Issue 3, 1109-1130</ref> One way is the dimensionality of the cutting: the above example illustrates a one-dimensional (1D) problem; other industrial applications of 1D occur when cutting pipes, cables, and steel bars. Two-dimensional (2D) problems are encountered in furniture, clothing and glass production. When either the master item or the required parts are irregular-shaped (a situation often encountered in the leather, textile, metals industries) this is referred to as the ''nesting'' problem.\n\nNot many three-dimensional (3D) applications involving cutting are known; however the closely related 3D [[packing problem]] has many industrial applications, such as packing objects into shipping containers (see e.g. [[containerization]]: the related [[sphere packing]] problem has been studied since the 17th century ([[Kepler conjecture]])).\n\n==Cutting-stock problem in paper, film and metal industries==\nIndustrial applications of cutting-stock problems for high production volumes arise especially when basic material is produced in large rolls that are further cut into smaller units (see [[roll slitting]]). This is done e.g. in paper and plastic film industries but also in production of flat metals like steel or brass. There are many variants and additional constraints arising from special production constraints due to machinery and process limits, customer requirements and quality issues; some examples are:\n* Two-stage, where the rolls produced in the first stage are then processed a second time. For instance, all office stationery (e.g. [[ISO 216#A series|A4]] size in Europe, [[Letter (paper size)|Letter size]] in US) is produced in such a process. The complication arises because the machinery in the second stage is narrower than the primary.  Efficient utilisation of both stages of production is important (from an energy or material use perspective) and what is efficient for the primary stage may be inefficient for the secondary, leading to trade-offs. [[Metallised film]] (used in packaging of snacks), and plastic extrusion on paper (used in [[liquid packaging board|liquid packaging]], e.g. juice cartons) are further examples of such a process.\n* Winder constraints where the slitting process has physical or logical constraints: a very common constraint is that only a certain number of slitting knives are available, so that feasible patterns should not contain more than a maximum number of rolls. Because winder machinery is not standardised, very many other constraints are encountered.\n* An example of a customer requirement is when a particular order cannot be satisfied from either of the two edge positions: this is because the edges of the sheet tend to have greater variations in thickness and some applications can be very sensitive to these.\n* An example of a quality issue is when the master roll contains defects that have to be cut around. Expensive materials with demanding quality characteristics such as [[photographic paper]] or [[Tyvek]] have to be carefully optimised so that the wasted area is minimised.\n* Multi-machine problems arise when orders can be produced on more than one machine and these machines have different widths. Generally availability of more than one master roll width improves the waste considerably; in practice however additional order splitting constraints may have to be taken into account.\n* There is also a semi-continuous problem, where the produced rolls do not have to be of the same diameter, but can vary within a range. This typically occurs with sheet orders. This is sometimes known as a ''1½ dimensional'' problem. This variant also occurs in the production of [[corrugated fiberboard]], where it is called, somewhat confusingly, the ''corrugator scheduling problem''.\n* Because some paper machines are relatively narrow compared to the demanded items, some companies have invested in a ''skiving'' (also known as a ''web-welding'') secondary process, whereby two reels (produced by slitting the initial jumbo reels) are joined side-by-side (with a little overlap) to make up a wider roll. Producing narrower reels in the primary process leads to lower overall waste.<ref name=Johnson1997>M.P. Johnson, C. Rennick & E. Zak (1997), ''Skiving addition to the cutting stock problem in the paper industry'', SIAM Review, 472-483</ref>\n* In the metals industry one key difference is that typically the master rolls are produced earlier and are generally different from each other (both in terms of width and length). Therefore, there are similarities with the multi-machine problem mentioned above. The presence of length variations creates a 2-D problem, because waste can occur both width-wise and length-wise.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Cutting-stock problem in the glass industry==\nThe [[guillotine problem]] is a problem of cutting sheets of [[glass]] into rectangles of specified sizes, using only cuts that continue all the way across each sheet.\n[[File:CuttingStockGuillotine.png|thumb|Example of a guillotine cut]]\n[[File:CuttingStockNonGuillotine.png|thumb|Example of a non-guillotine cut]]\n\n==Assortment problem==\nThe related problem of determining, for the one-dimensional case, the best master size that will meet given demand is known as the ''assortment'' problem.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-3995.2009.00724.x| title = The generalized assortment and best cutting stock length problems| journal = International Transactions in Operational Research| volume = 17| pages = 35| year = 2010| last1 = Raffensperger | first1 = J.

The precise nature of the quantity constraints can lead to subtly different mathematical characteristics. The above formulation's quantity constraints are '''minimum''' constraints (at least the given amount of each order must be produced, but possibly more). When <math>c_i=1</math> the objective minimises the number of utilised master items and, if the constraint for the quantity to be produced is replaced by equality, it is called the [[bin packing problem]]. The most general formulation has two-sided constraints (and in this case a minimum-waste solution may consume more than the minimum number of master items):\n\n:<math>q_j \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ij} x_i \\le Q_j, \\quad \\quad \\forall j=1,\\dots,m</math>\n\nThis formulation applies not just to one-dimensional problems. Many variations are possible, including one where the objective is not to minimise the waste, but to maximise the total value of the produced items, allowing each order to have a different value.\n\nIn general, the number of possible patterns grows exponentially as a function of ''m'', the number of orders. As the number of orders increases, it may therefore become impractical to enumerate the possible cutting patterns.\n\nAn alternative approach uses [[delayed column-generation]]. This method solves the cutting-stock problem by starting with just a few patterns. It generates additional patterns when they are needed. For the one-dimensional case, the new patterns are introduced by solving an auxiliary optimization problem called the [[knapsack problem]], using dual variable information from the [[linear program]]. The knapsack problem has well-known methods to solve it, such as [[branch and bound]] and [[dynamic programming]]. The Delayed Column Generation method can be much more efficient than the original approach, particularly as the size of the problem grows. The [[column generation]] approach as applied to the cutting stock problem was pioneered by Gilmore and Gomory in a series of papers published in the 1960s.<ref name=Gilmore61>Gilmore P. C., R. E. Gomory (1961). ''A linear programming approach to the cutting-stock problem''.  Operations Research 9: 849-859</ref><ref name=Gilmore63>Gilmore P. C., R. E. Gomory (1963). ''A linear programming approach to the cutting-stock problem - Part II''.  Operations Research 11: 863-888</ref> Gilmore and Gomory showed that this approach is guaranteed to converge to the (fractional) optimal solution, without needing to enumerate all the possible patterns in advance.\n\nA limitation of the original Gilmore and Gomory method is that it does not handle integrality, so the solution may contain fractions, e.g. a particular pattern should be produced 3.67 times. Rounding to the nearest integer often does not work, in the sense that it may lead to a sub-optimal solution and/or under- or over-production of some of the orders (and possible infeasibility in the presence of two-sided demand constraints). This limitation is overcome in modern algorithms, which can solve to optimality (in the sense of finding solutions with minimum waste) very large instances of the problem (generally larger than encountered in practice<ref name=Goulimis1990>Goulimis C (1990). ''Optimal solutions for the cutting stock problem''.  European Journal of Operational Research 44: 197-208</ref><ref name=Carvalho1998>de Carvalho V (1998). ''Exact solution of cutting stock problems using [[column generation]] and branch-and-bound''. International Transactions in Operational Research 5: 35–44</ref>).\n\nThe cutting-stock problem is often highly degenerate, in that multiple solutions with the same amount of waste are possible. This degeneracy arises because it is possible to move items around, creating new patterns, without affecting the amount of waste. This gives rise to a whole collection of related problems which are concerned with some other criterion, such as the following:\n* The minimum pattern count problem: to find a minimum-pattern-count solution amongst the minimum-waste solutions. This is a very hard problem, even when the waste is known.<ref name=Umetani2003>S. Umetani, M. Yagiura, and T. Ibaraki (2003).

      "text": "In [[geometry]], a '''kissing number''' is defined as the number of non-overlapping unit [[sphere]]s that can be arranged such that they each touch a common unit sphere. For a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] packing the kissing number is the same for every sphere, but for an arbitrary [[sphere packing]] the kissing number may vary from one sphere to another. Other names for kissing number that have been used are '''Newton number''' (after the originator of the problem), and '''contact number'''.\n\nIn general, the '''kissing number problem''' seeks the maximum possible kissing number for [[n-sphere|''n''-dimensional spheres]] in (''n'' + 1)-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Ordinary spheres correspond to two-dimensional closed surfaces in three-dimensional space.\n\nFinding the kissing number when centers of spheres are confined to a line (the one-dimensional case) or a plane (two-dimensional case) is trivial. Proving a solution to the three-dimensional case, despite being easy to conceptualise and model in the physical world, eluded mathematicians until the mid-20th century.<ref name=Conway/><ref name=Brass/> Solutions in higher dimensions are considerably more challenging, and only a handful of cases have been solved exactly. For others investigations have determined upper and lower bounds, but not exact solutions.<ref name=Mittlemann/>\n\n==Known greatest kissing numbers==\n\nIn one dimension, the kissing number is 2:\n\n:[[Image:Kissing-1d.svg]]\n\nIn two dimensions, the kissing number is 6:\n\n:[[Image:Kissing-2d.svg]]\n\n'''Proof''': Consider a circle with center ''C'' that is touched by circles with centers ''C''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>2</sub>, .... Consider the rays ''C'' ''C''<sub>''i''</sub>. These rays all emanate from the same center ''C'', so the sum of angles between adjacent rays is 360°.\n\nAssume by contradiction that there are more than six touching circles. Then at least two adjacent rays, say ''C'' ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C'' ''C''<sub>2</sub>, are separated by an angle of less than 60°. The segments ''C C<sub>i</sub>'' have the same length – 2''r'' – for all ''i''. Therefore, the triangle ''C'' ''C''<sub>1</sub> ''C''<sub>2</sub> is isosceles, and its third side – ''C''<sub>1</sub> ''C''<sub>2</sub> – has a side length of less than 2''r''. Therefore, the circles 1 and 2 intersect – a contradiction.<ref>See also Lemma 3.1 in {{Cite journal | last1 = Marathe | first1 = M. V. | last2 = Breu | first2 = H. | last3 = Hunt | first3 = H.

This leaves slightly more than 0.1 of the radius between two nearby spheres.]]\n\nIn three dimensions, the kissing number is 12, but the correct value was much more difficult to establish than in dimensions one and two. It is easy to arrange 12 spheres so that each touches a central sphere, but there is a lot of space left over, and it is not obvious that there is no way to pack in a 13th sphere. (In fact, there is so much extra space that any two of the 12 outer spheres can exchange places through a continuous movement without any of the outer spheres losing contact with the center one.) This was the subject of a famous disagreement between mathematicians [[Isaac Newton]] and [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]]. Newton correctly thought that the limit was 12; Gregory thought that a 13th could fit. Some incomplete proofs that Newton was correct were offered in the nineteenth century, most notably one by [[Reinhold Hoppe]], but the first correct proof (according to Brass, Moser, and Pach) did not appear until 1953.<ref name=Conway>{{cite book |first=John H. |last=Conway |authorlink=John Horton Conway |author2=Neil J.A.

A coordination number of 12 is found in a [[cubic close-packed]] or a [[hexagonal close-packed]] structure.\n\nIn four dimensions, it was known for some time that the answer was either 24 or 25. It is easy to produce a packing of 24 spheres around a central sphere (one can place the spheres at the vertices of a suitably scaled [[24-cell]] centered at the origin). As in the three-dimensional case, there is a lot of space left over—even more, in fact, than for ''n'' = 3—so the situation was even less clear.

There are different versions of the problem depending on whether the copies are only required to be congruent to the original body, [[translation (geometry)|translates]] of the original body, or translated by a lattice. For the [[regular tetrahedron]], for example, it is known that both the lattice kissing number and the translative kissing number are equal to 18, whereas the congruent kissing number is at least 56.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lagarias|first1=Jeffrey C.|last2=Zong|first2=Chuanming|title=Mysteries in packing regular tetrahedra|journal=Notices of the American Mathematical Society|date=December 2012|pages=1540–1549|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201211/rtx121101540p.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Algorithms==\nThere are several [[approximation algorithm]]s on [[intersection graph]]s where the approximation ratio depends on the kissing number.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Kammer|first1=Frank|last2=Tholey|first2=Torsten|title=Approximation Algorithms for Intersection Graphs|journal=Algorithmica |volume=68|issue=2|date=July 2012|pages=312–336|doi=10.1007/s00453-012-9671-1}}</ref> For example, there is \na polynomial-time 10-approximation algorithm to find a maximum non-intersecting subset of a set of rotated unit squares.\n\n==Mathematical statement==\nThe kissing number problem can be stated as the existence of a solution to a set of [[Inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]]. Let <math>x_n</math> be a set of ''N'' ''D''-dimensional position vectors of the centres of the spheres. The condition that this set of spheres can lie round the centre sphere without overlapping is:\n\n:<math> \\exist  x\\  \\left\\{ \\forall_n \\{x_n^Tx_n=1\\} \\land \\forall_{m,n: m \\neq n} \\{ (x_n-x_m)^T(x_n-x_m) \\geq 1\\} \\right\\}</math>&nbsp;<ref>Numbers ''m'' and ''n'' run from 1 to ''N''. <math>x = (x_n)_N</math> is the sequence of the ''N'' positional vectors. As the condition behind the second universal quantifier (<math>\\forall</math>) does not change if ''m'' and ''n'' are exchanged, it is sufficient to let this quantor extend just over <math>m,n:m<n</math>. For simplification the sphere radiuses are assumed to be 1/2.</ref>\n\nThus the problem for each dimension can be expressed in the [[existential theory of the reals]]. However, general methods of solving problems in this form take at least [[exponential time]] which is why this problem has only been solved up to 4 dimensions. By adding additional variables, <math>y_{nm}</math> this can be converted to a single [[Quartic function|quartic equation]] in ''N''(''N''-1)/2 + ''DN'' variables:\n\n:<math> \\exist xy\\  \\left\\{ \\sum_n (x_n^Tx_n-1)^2 + \\sum_{m,n: m<n}\\Big( (x_n-x_m)^T(x_n-x_m)-1 - (y_{nm})^2 \\Big)^2 = 0 \\right\\} </math>&nbsp;<ref>Concerning the matrix <math>y = (y_{mn})_{N\\times{N}}</math> only the entries having ''m''<''n'' are needed. Or, equivalent, the matrix can be assumed to be antisymmetric. Anyway the matrix has just''N''(''N''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)\\2 free scalar variables. In addition, there are ''N'' ''D''-dimensional vectors ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, which correspondent to a matrix <math>x = (x_{nd})_{N\\times{D}}</math> of ''N'' column vectors.</ref>\n\nTherefore, to solve the case in ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 dimensions and ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[D5 lattice|40]]&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 vectors would be equivalent to determining the existence of real solutions to a quartic polynomial in 1025 variables. For the ''D'' = 24 dimensions and ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;[[Leech lattice|196560]]&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, the quartic would have 19,322,732,544 variables. An alternative statement in terms of [[distance geometry]] is given by the distances squared <math>R_{mn}</math> between then ''m''<sup>th</sup> and ''n''<sup>th</sup> sphere.\n\n:<math> \\exist  R\\  \\{ \\forall_n \\{R_{0n}=1 \\} \\land \\forall_{m,n: m<n} \\{ R_{mn} \\geq 1\\} \\}</math>\n\nThis must be supplemented with the condition that the [[Cayley–Menger determinant]] is zero for any set of points which forms an (''D''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) simplex in ''D'' dimensions, since that volume must be zero. Setting <math>R_{mn}= 1+{y_{mn}}^2</math> gives a set of simultaneous polynomial equations in just ''y'' which must be solved for real values only. The two methods, being entirely equivalent, have various different uses. For example, in the second case one can randomly alter the values of the ''y'' by small amounts to try and minimise the polynomial in terms of the&nbsp;''y''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Equilateral dimension]]\n*[[Sphere packing]]\n*[[Spherical code]]\n*[[Soddy's hexlet]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* T.

Provided that any ball of the Euclidean space intersects only finitely many elements of the packing and that the diameters of the elements are bounded from above, the (upper, lower) density does not depend on the choice of origin, and {{math|''&mu;''(''K''<sub>''i''</sub>∩''B''<sub>''t''</sub>)}} can be replaced by {{math|''&mu;''(''K''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} for every element that intersects {{math|''B''<sub>''t''</sub>}}.<ref name=\"groemer1986\">{{citation\n | last = Groemer | first = H.\n | journal = Discrete and Computational Geometry\n | pages = 183–193\n | title = Some basic properties of packing and covering constants\n | doi = 10.1007/BF02187693\n | volume = 1\n | issue = 2\n | year = 1986}}</ref>\nThe ball may also be replaced by dilations of some other convex body, but in general the resulting densities are not equal.\n\n== Optimal packing density ==\n\n\nOne is often interested in packings restricted to use elements of a certain supply collection. For example, the supply collection may be the set of all balls of a given radius. The '''optimal packing density''' or '''packing constant''' associated with a supply collection is the [[supremum]] of upper densities obtained by packings that are subcollections of the supply collection. If the supply collection consists of convex bodies of bounded diameter, there exists a packing whose packing density is equal to the packing constant, and this packing constant does not vary if the balls in the definition of density are replaced by dilations of some other convex body.<ref name=\"groemer1986\" />\n\nA particular supply collection of interest is all [[Euclidean motion]]s of a fixed convex body {{math|''K''}}. In this case, we call the packing constant the packing constant of {{math|''K''}}. The [[Kepler conjecture]] is concerned with the packing constant of 3-balls. [[Ulam's packing conjecture]] states that 3-balls have the lowest packing constant of any convex solid. All [[translation (geometry)|translations]] of a fixed body is also a common supply collection of interest, and it defines the translative packing constant of that body.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Atomic packing factor]]\n* [[Sphere packing]]\n* [[List of shapes with known packing constant]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Mathworld |urlname=PackingDensity |title=Packing Density}}\n\n[[Category:Packing problems]]\n[[Category:Discrete geometry]]"

      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:HCP Oranges.jpg|thumb|Sphere packing finds practical application in the stacking of [[orange (fruit)|oranges]].]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''sphere packing''' is an arrangement of non-overlapping [[sphere]]s within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]]. However, sphere [[packing problem]]s can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space (where the problem becomes [[circle packing]] in two dimensions, or [[hypersphere]] packing in higher dimensions) or to [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] spaces such as [[hyperbolic space]].\n\nA typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as large a proportion of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the density of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the [[average]] or [[asymptotic]] density, measured over a large enough volume.\n\nFor equal spheres in three dimensions the densest packing uses approximately 74% of the volume. A random packing of equal spheres generally has a density around 64%.\n\n== Classification and terminology ==\nA '''[[lattice (group)|lattice]]''' arrangement (commonly called a '''regular''' arrangement) is one in which the centers of the spheres form a very symmetric pattern which needs only ''n'' vectors to be uniquely defined (in ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[Euclidean space]]). Lattice arrangements are periodic. Arrangements in which the spheres do not form a lattice (often referred to as '''irregular''') can still be periodic, but also '''[[aperiodic]]''' (properly speaking '''non-periodic''') or '''[[randomness|random]]'''. Lattice arrangements are easier to handle than irregular ones—their high degree of [[symmetry]] makes it easier to classify them and to measure their densities.\n\n== Regular packing ==\n[[File:Order and Chaos.tif|thumb|Regular arrangement of equal spheres in a plane changing to an irregular arrangement of unequal spheres (bubbles).]]\n[[Image:close packing box.svg|thumb|right|160px| HCP lattice (left) and the FCC lattice (right) are the two most common highest density arrangements. Note that the two groups shown here are not ''[[Crystal structure|unit cells]]'' that are capable of [[Tessellation|tessellating]] in 3D space. These groups do, however, readily illustrate the difference between the two lattices.]]\n\n[[Image:Closepacking.svg|thumb|right|160px|Two ways to stack three planes made of spheres]]\n\n===Dense packing===\n{{main|Close-packing of equal spheres}}\nIn three-dimensional Euclidean space, the densest packing of equal spheres is achieved by a family of structures called [[Close-packing of spheres|close-packed]] structures. One method for generating such a structure is as follows. Consider a plane with a compact arrangement of spheres on it. For any three neighbouring spheres, a fourth sphere can be placed on top in the hollow between the three bottom spheres. If we do this \"everywhere\" in a second plane above the first, we create a new compact layer. A third layer can be placed directly above the first one, or the spheres can be offset, vertically above another set of hollows of the first layer. There are thus three types of planes, called A, B and C.\n\nTwo simple arrangements within the close-packed family correspond to regular lattices. One is called cubic close packing (or [[face centred cubic]], \"FCC\")—where the layers are alternated in the ABCABC... sequence. The other is called hexagonal close packing (\"HCP\")—where the layers are alternated in the ABAB... sequence. But many layer stacking sequences are possible (ABAC, ABCBA, ABCBAC, etc.), and still generate a close-packed structure. In all of these arrangements each sphere is surrounded by 12 other spheres, and the average density is \n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\simeq 0.74048.</math>\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] proved in 1831 that these packings have the highest density amongst all possible lattice packings.<ref>{{cite journal|first=C.

Seeber's book: ''Studies on the characteristics of positive ternary quadratic forms'' etc|journal=Göttingsche Gelehrte Anzeigen|year=1831}}</ref>\n\nIn 1611 [[Johannes Kepler]] had conjectured that this is the maximum possible density amongst both regular and irregular arrangements—this became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]]. In 1998, [[Thomas Callister Hales]], following the approach suggested by [[László Fejes Tóth]] in 1953, announced a proof of the Kepler conjecture. Hales' proof is a [[proof by exhaustion]] involving checking of many individual cases using complex computer calculations. Referees said that they were \"99% certain\" of the correctness of Hales' proof. On 10 August 2014 Hales announced the completion of a formal proof using [[automated proof checking]], removing any doubt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/flyspeck/wiki/AnnouncingCompletion|website=Google Code Archive|title=Long-term storage for Google Code Project Hosting}}</ref>\n\n=== Other common lattice packings ===\n\nSome other lattice packings are often found in physical systems.

If five spheres are assembled in this way, they will be consistent with one of the regularly packed arrangements described above. However, the sixth sphere placed in this way will render the structure inconsistent with any regular arrangement. This results in the possibility of a ''random close packing'' of spheres which is stable against compression.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Random thoughts|first=Paul|last=Chaikin|date=June 2007|journal=Physics Today|page=8|issn=0031-9228|publisher=American Institute of Physics|volume=60|issue=6|doi=10.1063/1.2754580|bibcode = 2007PhT....60f...8C }}</ref>\n\nWhen spheres are randomly added to a container and then compressed, they will generally form what is known as an \"irregular\" or \"jammed\" packing configuration when they can be compressed no more.

Here there is a choice between separating the spheres into regions of close-packed equal spheres, or combining the multiple sizes of spheres into a compound or [[interstitial compound|interstitial]] packing. When many sizes of spheres (or a [[particle size distribution|distribution]]) are available, the problem quickly becomes intractable, but some studies of binary hard spheres (two sizes) are available.\n\nWhen the second sphere is much smaller than the first, it is possible to arrange the large spheres in a close-packed arrangement, and then arrange the small spheres within the octahedral and tetrahedral gaps. The density of this interstitial packing depends sensitively on the radius ratio, but in the limit of extreme size ratios, the smaller spheres can fill the gaps with the same density as the larger spheres filled space.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Hudson | first1 = D.

Thus, beyond this point, either the host structure must expand to accommodate the interstitials (which compromises the overall density), or rearrange into a more complex crystalline compound structure.

This additional constraint on the packing, together with the need to minimize the [[Coulomb energy]] of interacting charges leads to a diversity of optimal packing arrangements.\n\n==Hyperbolic space==\nAlthough the concept of circles and spheres can be extended to [[hyperbolic space]], finding the densest packing becomes much more difficult. In a hyperbolic space there is no limit to the number of spheres that can surround another sphere (for example, [[Ford circle]]s can be thought of as an arrangement of identical hyperbolic circles in which each circle is surrounded by an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of other circles). The concept of average density also becomes much more difficult to define accurately.

This example corresponds to the 2-comparable set {(1,1,1), (1,3,3), (2,1,2), (2,4,3), (3,1,4), (3,4,5), (4,2,1), (4,5,3), (5,2,2), (5,3,4), (5,5,5)}.{{r|admos}}]]\nIn [[combinatorics]], '''tripod packing''' is a problem of finding many disjoint tripods in a three-dimensional grid, where a tripod is an infinite [[polycube]], the union of the grid cubes along three positive axis-aligned rays with a shared apex.{{r|admos}}\n\nSeveral problems of tiling and packing tripods and related shapes were formulated in 1967 by [[Sherman K. Stein]].{{r|s67}} Stein originally called the tripods of this problem \"semicrosses\", and they were also called '''Stein corners''' by [[Solomon W. Golomb]].{{r|g}} The problem can also be formulated in terms of finding 2-comparable sets of triples, of filling matrices with monotone values, or of finding compatible sets of triangles in a convex polygon.{{r|admos}}\n\nThe best lower bound known for the number of tripods that can have their apexes packed into an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> grid is <math>\\Omega(n^{1.546})</math>, and the best upper bound is <math>O\\bigl(n^2/\\exp O(\\log^* n)\\bigr)</math>.{{r|admos|gl}}\n\n==Equivalent problems==\nThe coordinates <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math> of the apexes of a solution to the tripod problem form a '''2-comparable sets of triples''', where two triples are defined as being 2-comparable if there are either at least two coordinates where one triple is smaller than the other, or at least two coordinates where one triple is larger than the other. This condition ensures that the tripods defined from these triples do not have intersecting rays.{{r|admos}}\n\nAnother equivalent two-dimensional version of the question asks how many cells of an <math>n\\times n</math> array of square cells (indexed from <math>1</math> to <math>n</math>) can be filled in by the numbers from <math>1</math> to <math>n</math> in such a way that the non-empty cells of each row and each column of the array form strictly increasing sequences of numbers, and the positions holding each value <math>i</math> form a monotone chain within the array. A collection of disjoint tripods with apexes <math>(x_i,y_i,z_i)</math> can be transformed into an array of this type by placing the number <math>z_i</math> in array cell <math>(x_i,y_i)</math> and vice versa.{{r|admos}}\n\nThe problem is also equivalent to finding as many triangles as possible among the vertices of a convex polygon, such that no two triangles that share a vertex have nested angles at that vertex. This triangle-counting problem was posed by Peter Braß{{r|b}} and its equivalence to tripod packing was observed by Aronov et al.{{r|admos}}\n\n==Lower bounds==\nIt is straightforward to find a solution to the tripod packing problem with <math>\\Omega(n^{3/2})</math> tripods.{{r|admos}} For instance, for <math>k=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor</math>, the <math>\\Omega(n^{3/2})</math> triples\n:<math>\\bigl\\{ (ak+b+1,bk+c+1,ak+c+1) \\big| a,b,c\\in[0,k-1]\\bigr\\}</math>\nare 2-comparable.\n\nAfter several earlier improvements to this naïve bound,{{r|hs|s95|t}} Gowers and Long found solutions to the tripod problem of cardinality <math>\\Omega(n^{1.546})</math>.{{r|gl}}\n\n==Upper bounds==\nFrom any solution to the tripod packing problem, one can derive a balanced tripartite graph whose vertices are three copies of the numbers from <math>0</math> to <math>n-1</math> (one for each of the three coordinates) with a triangle of edges connecting the three vertices corresponding to the coordinates of the apex of each tripod. There are no other triangles in these graphs (they are [[locally linear graph]]s) because any other triangle would lead to a violation of 2-comparability. Therefore, by the known upper bounds to the [[Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem]] (one version of which is to find the maximum density of edges in a balanced tripartite locally linear graph), the maximum number of disjoint tripods that can be packed in an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> grid is <math>o(n^2)</math>, and more precisely <math>O\\bigl(n^2/\\exp O(\\log^* n)\\bigr)</math>.{{r|admos|gl|t|l}} Although Tiskin writes that \"tighter analysis of the parameters\" can produce a bound that is less than quadratic by a polylogarithmic factor,{{r|t}} he does not supply details and his proof that the number is <math>o(n^2)</math> uses only the same techniques that are known for the Ruzsa–Szemerédi problem, so this stronger claim appears to be a mistake.{{r|admos}}\n\n==Small instances==\nFor small instances of the tripod problem, the exact solution is known.

      "text": "{{unsolved|mathematics|Is there any three-dimensional convex body with lower packing density than the sphere?}}\n'''Ulam's packing conjecture''', named for [[Stanislaw Ulam]], is a conjecture about the [[Packing problem|highest possible packing density]] of identical [[convex set|convex solids]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The conjecture says that the [[packing density|optimal density]] for [[sphere packing|packing congruent spheres]] is smaller than that for any other convex body. That is, according to the conjecture, the ball is the convex solid which forces the largest fraction of space to remain empty in its optimal packing structure. This conjecture is therefore related to the [[Kepler conjecture]] about [[sphere packing]]. Since the solution to the Kepler conjecture establishes that identical balls must leave ≈25.95% of the space empty, Ulam's conjecture is equivalent to the statement that no other convex solid forces that much space to be left empty.\n\n==Origin==\n\nThis conjecture was attributed posthumously to Ulam by [[Martin Gardner]], who remarks in a postscript added to one of his ''[[Mathematical Games (column)|Mathematical Games]]'' columns that Ulam communicated this conjecture to him in 1972.<ref name=\"gardner1995\">{{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin |date=1995 |title=New Mathematical Diversions (Revised Edition)  |location=Washington |publisher=Mathematical Association of America |page=251 }}</ref> Though the original reference to the conjecture states only that Ulam \"suspected\" the ball to be the worst case for packing, the statement has been subsequently taken as a conjecture.\n\n==Supporting arguments==\n\nNumerical experiments with a large variety of convex solids have resulted in each case in the construction of packings that leave less empty space than is left by [[close-packing of equal spheres]], and so many solids have been ruled out as counterexamples of Ulam's conjecture.<ref name=\"degraaf2011\">{{citation\n | last = de Graaf | first = Joost\n | last2 = van Roij | first2 = René\n | last3 = Dijkstra | first3 = Marjolein | author3-link = Marjolein Dijkstra\n | journal = [[Physical Review Letters]]\n | pages = 155501\n | title = Dense Regular Packings of Irregular Nonconvex Particles\n | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.107.155501\n | volume = 107\n | issue = 15\n | year = 2011\n | postscript = . | bibcode=2011PhRvL.107o5501D | pmid=22107298| arxiv = 1107.0603}}</ref>\nNevertheless, there is an infinite space of possible shapes that have not been ruled out.\n\nYoav Kallus has shown that at least among [[point symmetry|point-symmetric]] bodies, the ball constitutes a local maximum of the fraction of empty space forced.<ref name=\"kallus2014\">{{citation\n | last = Kallus | first = Yoav\n | journal = [[Advances in Mathematics]]\n | volume = 264\n | pages = 355–370\n | title = The 3-ball is a local pessimum for packing\n | doi = 10.1016/j.aim.2014.07.015\n | arxiv = 1212.2551\n | mr = 3250288\n | year = 2014\n | postscript = .}}</ref>\nThat is, any point-symmetric solid that does not deviate too much from a ball can be packed with greater efficiency than can balls.\n\n==Analogs in other dimensions==\n\nThe analog of Ulam's packing conjecture in two dimensions would say that no convex shape forces more than ≈9.31% of the plane to remain uncovered, since that is the fraction of empty space left uncovered in the [[circle packing|densest packing of disks]].

For the related article on circle packing with a prescribed [[intersection graph]], please see the [[circle packing theorem]].''\n[[Image:Citrus fruits.jpg|thumb|The most efficient way to pack different-sized circles together is not obvious.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], '''circle packing''' is the study of the arrangement of circles (of equal or varying sizes) on a given surface such that no overlapping occurs and so that all circles touch one another. The associated [[packing density]], ''η'', of an arrangement is the proportion of the surface covered by the circles. Generalisations can be made to higher dimensions &ndash; this is called [[sphere packing]], which usually deals only with identical spheres.\n\nWhile the circle has a relatively low maximum packing density of 0.9069 on the [[Euclidean plane]], it does not have the lowest possible. The \"worst\" shape to pack onto a plane is not known, but the [[smoothed octagon]] has a packing density of about 0.902414, which is the lowest maximum packing density known of any centrally-symmetric convex shape.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=SmoothedOctagon |title=Smoothed Octagon }}</ref>\nPacking densities of concave shapes such as [[star polygon]]s can be arbitrarily small.\n\nThe branch of mathematics generally known as \"circle packing\" is concerned with the geometry and combinatorics of packings of arbitrarily-sized circles: these give rise to discrete analogs of [[conformal mapping]], [[Riemann surfaces]] and the like.\n\n==Packings in the plane==\n[[File:Circle packing (hexagonal).svg|160px|thumb|right|Identical circles in a ''hexagonal packing'' arrangement, the densest packing possible.]]\n[[File:Order and Chaos.tif|thumb|Triangular packing through natural arrangement of equal circles with transitions to an irregular arrangement of unequal circles.]]\n\nIn two dimensional Euclidean space, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] proved in 1773 that the highest-density lattice arrangement of circles is the [[hexagon]]al packing arrangement,<ref name=\"ChangWang\"/> in which the centres of the circles are arranged in a [[hexagonal lattice]] (staggered rows, like a [[honeycomb]]), and each circle is surrounded by 6 other circles. The density of this arrangement is\n\n::<math>\\eta_h = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{6} \\approx 0.9069.</math>\n\nHexagonal packing of equal circles was found to fill a fraction Pi/Sqrt[12] ≃ 0.91 of area—which was proved maximal for periodic packings by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1831.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=985|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}</ref> Later, [[Axel Thue]] provided the first proof that this was optimal in 1890, showing that the hexagonal lattice is the densest of all possible circle packings, both regular and irregular.  However, his proof was considered by some to be incomplete.

The [[Thomson problem]] deals with the lowest energy distribution of identical electric charges on the surface of a sphere. The [[Tammes problem]] is a generalisation of this, dealing with maximising the minimum distance between circles on sphere. This is analogous to distributing non-point charges on a sphere.\n\n==Packings in bounded areas==\n[[File:Circles packed in square 15.svg|thumb|right|Fifteen equal circles [[Circle packing in a square|packed within the smallest possible square]].

One such extension is to find the maximum possible density of a system with two specific sizes of circle (a ''binary'' system).

A [[modem]] transmits data as a series of points in a 2-dimensional phase-amplitude plane.  The spacing between the points determines the noise tolerance of the transmission, while the circumscribing circle diameter determines the transmitter power required.  Performance is maximized when the [[Constellation diagram|constellation]] of code points are at the centres of an efficient circle packing.  In practice, suboptimal rectangular packings are often used to simplify decoding.\n\nCircle packing has become an essential tool in [[origami]] design, as each appendage on an origami figure requires a circle of paper.<ref>TED.com lecture on modern origami \"[http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/robert_lang_folds_way_new_origami.html Robert Lang on TED].\"</ref>  [[Robert J.

See [[spherical design]].\n\n== Relations to other scientific problems ==\nThe Thomson problem is a natural consequence of Thomson's [[plum pudding model]] in the absence of its uniform positive background charge.<ref>{{cite journal|first1=Y.|last1=Levin|first2=J.

Thomson, The Romanes Lecture, 1914 (The Atomic Theory)</ref>}}\n\nThough experimental evidence led to the abandonment of Thomson's plum pudding model as a complete atomic model, irregularities observed in numerical energy solutions of the Thomson problem have been found to correspond with electron shell-filling in naturally occurring atoms throughout the [[periodic table]] of elements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=LaFave Jr|first=Tim|title=Correspondences between the classical electrostatic Thomson problem and atomic electronic structure|journal=Journal of Electrostatics|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1029–1035|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.elstat.2013.10.001|arxiv=1403.2591}}</ref>\n\nThe Thomson problem also plays a role in the study of other physical models including [[electron bubble|multi-electron bubbles]] and the surface ordering of liquid metal drops confined in [[Paul trap]]s.\n\nThe generalized Thomson problem arises, for example, in determining the arrangements of the protein subunits which comprise the shells of spherical [[virus]]es. The \"particles\" in this application are clusters of protein subunits arranged on a shell. Other realizations include regular arrangements of [[colloid]] particles in ''colloidosomes'', proposed for encapsulation of active ingredients such as drugs, nutrients or living cells, [[fullerene]] patterns of carbon atoms, and [[VSEPR theory]]. An example with long-range logarithmic interactions is provided by the [[Abrikosov vortices]] which would form at low temperatures in a [[superconductivity|superconducting]] metal shell with a large monopole at the center.\n\n== Configurations of smallest known energy ==\nIn the following table <math>N</math> is the number of points (charges) in a configuration,  <math>E_1</math> is the energy, the symmetry type is given in [[Schönflies notation]] (see [[Point groups in three dimensions]]), and <math>r_i</math> are the positions of the charges. Most symmetry types require the vector sum of the positions (and thus the [[electric dipole moment]]) to be zero.\n\nIt is customary to also consider the polyhedron formed by the [[convex hull]] of the points. Thus, <math>v_i</math> is the number of vertices where the given number of edges meet, '<math>e</math> is the total number of edges, <math>f_3</math> is the number of triangular faces, <math>f_4</math> is the number of quadrilateral faces, and <math>\\theta_1</math> is the smallest angle subtended by vectors associated with the nearest charge pair.  Note that the edge lengths are generally not equal; thus (except in the cases ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, 6, 12, 24) the convex hull is only [[topology|topologically]] equivalent to the [[uniform polyhedron]] or [[Johnson solid]] listed in the last column.<ref>\nKevin Brown.\n[http://mathpages.com/home/kmath005/kmath005.htm \"Min-Energy Configurations of Electrons On A Sphere\"].\nRetrieved 2014-05-01.\n</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

      "text": "[[Image:All 18 Pentominoes.svg|thumb|The 18 one-sided [[pentomino]]es: polyforms consisting of five squares.]]\n\nIn [[recreational mathematics]], a '''polyform''' is a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] figure constructed by joining together identical basic [[polygon]]s. The basic polygon is often (but not necessarily) a [[convex polygon|convex]] plane-filling polygon, such as a [[Square (geometry)|square]] or a [[triangle]]. More specific names have been given to polyforms resulting from specific basic polygons, as detailed in the table below. For example, a square basic polygon results in the well-known [[polyomino]]es.\n\n==Construction rules==\nThe rules for joining the polygons together may vary, and must therefore be stated for each distinct type of polyform. Generally, however, the following rules apply:\n#Two basic polygons may be joined only along a common edge, and must share the entirety of that edge.\n#No two basic polygons may overlap.\n#A polyform must be connected (that is, all one piece; see [[connected graph]], [[connected space]]). Configurations of disconnected basic polygons do not qualify as polyforms.\n#The mirror image of an asymmetric polyform is not considered a distinct polyform (polyforms are \"double sided\").\n\n==Generalizations==\nPolyforms can also be considered in higher dimensions. In 3-dimensional space, basic [[polyhedra]] can be joined along congruent faces. Joining [[cube (geometry)|cube]]s in this way produces the [[polycube]]s.\n\nOne can allow more than one basic polygon. The possibilities are so numerous that the exercise seems pointless, unless extra requirements are brought in. For example, the [[Penrose tile]]s define extra rules for joining edges, resulting in interesting polyforms with a kind of pentagonal symmetry.\n\nWhen the base form is a polygon that tiles the plane, rule 1 may be broken. For instance, squares may be joined orthogonally at vertices, as well as at edges, to form ''polyplets'' or ''polykings''.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=Polyplet|title=Polyplet}}</ref>\n\n==Types and applications==\nPolyforms are a rich source of problems, [[puzzle]]s and [[game]]s. The basic [[combinatorial]] problem is counting the number of different polyforms, given the basic polygon and the construction rules, as a function of ''n'', the number of basic polygons in the polyform.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Sides\n!colspan=\"2\"|Basic polygon (monoform)\n!width=170|Monohedral<BR>tessellation\n!Polyform\n!Applications\n|-\n!2\n![[image:Monostick.png]]\n|[[line segment]]\n|\n|[[polystick]]\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=3|3\n![[image:Monoiamond.png]]\n|[[Triangle#Types of triangle|equilateral triangle]]\n|[[File:Uniform triangular tiling 111111.png|60px]]<BR>[[Deltille]]\n|[[polyiamond]]\n|\n|-\n![[image:Monodrafter.png]]\n|[[Special right triangles#30–60–90 triangle|30°-60°-90° triangle]]\n|[[File:1-uniform 3 dual.svg|60px]]<BR>[[Kisrhombille tiling|Kisrhombille]]\n|[[polydrafter]]\n|[[Eternity puzzle]], Tentai Show\n|-\n![[image:Monoabolo.png]]\n|[[Special right triangles#45–45–90 triangle|right isosceles (45°-45°-90°) triangle]]\n|[[File:1-uniform 2 dual.svg|60px]]<BR>[[Kisquadrille]]\n|[[polyabolo]]\n|\n|-\n!rowspan=2|4\n![[image:Monomino.png]]\n|[[Square (geometry)|square]]\n|[[File:Square tiling uniform coloring 1.png|60px]]<BR>[[Square tiling|Quadrille]]\n|[[polyomino]]\n|[[Pentomino|pentomino puzzle]], [[Tetris]], [[Lonpos|Lonpos puzzle]], [[Fillomino]], Tentai Show, [[Ripple Effect (puzzle)]], [[LITS]], [[Nurikabe (puzzle)|Nurikabe]], [[Sudoku]]\n|-\n![[Image:Monominoid.svg|60px]]\n|[[rhombus]]\n|[[File:Isohedral tiling p4-55.png|60px]][[File:Isohedral tiling p4-51c.png|60px]][[File:Rhombic star tiling.png|40px]]<BR>[[Rhombille]]\n|polyrhomb\n|\n|-\n!6\n![[image:Monohex.png]]\n|[[Hexagon|regular hexagon]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 63-t0.png|60px]]<BR>[[Hextille]]\n|[[polyhex (mathematics)|polyhex]]\n|\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Polycube]]\n*[[Polyomino]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Polyforms}}\n*{{MathWorld|urlname=Polyform|title=Polyform}}\n*[http://www.recmath.org/PolyPages/index.htm ''The Poly Pages'' at RecMath.org], illustrations and information on many kinds of polyforms.\n\n{{Polyforms}}\n\n[[Category:Polyforms| ]]"

A simple way to demonstrate that such a packing of hexominoes is not possible is via a [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] argument.  If the hexominoes are placed on a [[checkerboard]] pattern, then 11 of the hexominoes will cover an even number of black squares (either 2 white and 4 black or vice versa) and the other 24 hexominoes will cover an [[odd number]] of black squares (3 white and 3 black).  Overall, an even number of black squares will be covered in any arrangement.  However, any rectangle of 210 squares will have 105 black squares and 105 white squares.\n\nHowever, there are other simple figures of 210 squares that can be packed with the hexominoes.  For example, a 15 &times; 15 square with a 3 &times; 5 rectangle removed from the centre has 210 squares.  With checkerboard colouring, it has 106 white and 104 black squares (or vice versa), so parity does not prevent a packing, and a packing is indeed possible.<ref>[http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/hexominos.htm Mathematische Basteleien: Hexominos] {{en icon}}</ref>  It is also possible for two sets of pieces to fit a rectangle of size 420, or for the set of 60 one-sided hexominoes (18 of which cover an even number of black squares) to fit a rectangle of size 360.<ref>[http://recmath.com/PolyPages/PolyPages/index.htm?hexopatts.htm Hexomino Constructions]</ref>\n\n==Polyhedral nets for the cube==\n[[Image:The 11 cubic nets.svg|thumb|300px|All 11 unfoldings of the cube]]\nA [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral net]] for the [[cube]] is necessarily a hexomino, with 11 hexominoes actually being nets.

Golomb]] starting in 1953 and later in his 1965 book ''Polyominoes: Puzzles, Patterns, Problems, and Packings''.<ref name=Harshbarger /><ref>[http://people.rit.edu/mecsma/Professional/Puzzles/Pentominoes/P-Intro.html people.rit.edu - Introduction - polyomino and pentomino]</ref> They were introduced to the general public by [[Martin Gardner]] in his October 1965 [[Mathematical Games column]] in [[Scientific American]]. Golomb coined the term \"pentomino\" from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πέντε}} / ''pénte'', \"five\", and the -omino of [[domino]], fancifully interpreting the \"d-\" of \"domino\" as if it were a form of the Greek prefix \"di-\" (two). Golomb named the 12 [[Free polyomino|''free'']] pentominoes after letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] that they resemble.\n\n[[John Horton Conway]] proposed an alternate labeling scheme for pentominoes, using O instead of I, Q instead of L, R instead of F, and S instead of N.  The resemblance to the letters is more strained, especially for the O pentomino, but this scheme has the advantage of using 12 consecutive letters of the alphabet.  It is used by convention in discussing [[Conway's Game of Life]], where, for example, one speaks of the R-pentomino instead of the F-pentomino.\n\n==Symmetry==\n* F, L, N, P, and Y can be oriented in 8 ways: 4 by rotation, and 4 more for the mirror image.

Its symmetry group, the dihedral group of order 4, has eight elements.\n\nThe F, L, N, P, Y, and Z pentominoes are [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]; adding their reflections (F′, L′, N′, Q, Y′, Z′) brings the number of ''one-sided'' pentominoes to 18.  If rotations are also considered distinct, then the pentominoes from the first category count eightfold, the ones from the next three categories (T, U, V, W, Z) count fourfold, I  counts twice, and X counts only once. This results in 5×8 + 5×4 + 2 + 1 = 63 ''fixed'' pentominoes.\n\nFor example, the eight possible orientations of the L, F, N, P, and Y pentominoes are as follows:\n\n[[File:L-pentomino Symmetry.svg|150px]] [[File:F-pentomino Symmetry.svg|150px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:N-pentomino Symmetry.svg|150px]]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:P-pentomino Symmetry.svg|150px]] [[File:Y-pentomino Symmetry.svg|150px]]\n\nFor 2D figures in general there are two more categories:\n* Being orientable in 2 ways by a rotation of 90°, with two axes of reflection symmetry, both aligned with the diagonals. This type of symmetry requires at least a [[heptomino]].\n* Being orientable in 2 ways, which are each other's mirror images, for example a [[swastika]]. This type of symmetry requires at least an [[octomino]].\n\n== Tiling rectangles ==\n[[File:Pentomino Puzzle Solutions.svg|right|Example tilings|400px]]\n\nA standard '''pentomino puzzle''' is to [[tessellation|tile]] a rectangular box with the pentominoes, i.e. cover it without overlap and without gaps. Each of the 12 pentominoes has an area of 5 unit squares, so the box must have an area of 60 units. Possible sizes are 6×10, 5×12, 4×15 and 3×20. The avid [[puzzle]]r can probably solve these problems by hand within a few hours. A more challenging task, typically requiring a [[search algorithm|computer search]], is to count the total number of solutions in each case.\n\nThe 6×10 case was first solved in 1960 by [[C. Brian Haselgrove|Colin Brian]] and [[Jenifer Haselgrove]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=C. B. Haselgrove |author2=Jenifer Haselgrove |date=October 1960 |title=A Computer Program for Pentominoes |journal=[[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|Eureka]] |volume=23 |pages=16–18}}</ref> There are exactly 2339 solutions, excluding trivial variations obtained by rotation and reflection of the whole rectangle, but including rotation and reflection of a subset of pentominoes (which sometimes provides an additional solution in a simple way). The 5×12 box has 1010 solutions, the 4×15 box has 368 solutions, and the 3×20 box has just 2 solutions (one is shown in the figure, and the other one can be obtained from the solution shown by rotating, as a whole, the block consisting of the L, N, F, T, W, Y, and Z pentominoes).\n\nA somewhat easier (more symmetrical) puzzle, the 8×8 rectangle with a 2×2 hole in the center, was solved by [[Dana Scott]] as far back as 1958.<ref>Dana S. Scott (1958). \"Programming a combinatorial puzzle\". Technical Report No. 1, Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University.</ref> There are 65 solutions. Scott's algorithm was one of the first applications of a [[backtracking]] computer program.  Variations of this puzzle allow the four holes to be placed in any position. One of the external links uses this rule.  Most such patterns are solvable, with the exceptions of placing each pair of holes near two corners of the board in such a way that both corners could only be fitted by a P-pentomino, or forcing a T-pentomino or U-pentomino in a corner such that another hole is created.\n\n[[File:Pentomino unsolvable.svg]]\n\nEfficient algorithms have been described to solve such problems, for instance by [[Donald Knuth]].<ref>Donald E. Knuth. [http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/papers/dancing-color.ps.gz \"Dancing links\"] (Postscript, 1.6 megabytes). Includes a summary of Scott's and Fletcher's articles.</ref> Running on modern [[personal computer|hardware]], these pentomino puzzles can now be solved in mere seconds.\n\nThe solution of tiling rectangles of polyominoes with ''n'' cells exists only for ''n'' = 0, 1, 2 and 5.\n\n== Filling boxes ==\nA '''pentacube''' is a [[polycube]] of five cubes. Of the 29 pentacubes, exactly twelve pentacubes are flat (1-layer) and correspond to the twelve pentominoes extruded to a depth of one square.\nA '''pentacube puzzle''' or 3D '''pentomino puzzle''', amounts to filling a 3-dimensional box with the 12 flat pentacubes, i.e. cover it without overlap and without gaps. Since each pentacube has a volume of 5 unit cubes, the box must have a volume of 60 units. Possible sizes are 2×3×10 (12 solutions), 2×5×6 (264 solutions) and 3×4×5 (3940 solutions). Following are one solution of each case.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barequet|first1=Gill|last2=Tal|first2=Shahar|editor1-first=Der-Tsai|editor1-last=Lee|\neditor2-first=Danny Z.|editor2-last=Chen|editor3-first=Shi|editor3-last=Ying |title=Frontiers in Algorithmics|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Berlin Heidelberg]]|year=2010|pages=124–135|chapter=Solving General Lattice Puzzles |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-14553-7_14}}</ref>\n[[File:Pentomino Cube Solutions.svg|425px]]\n\nAlternatively one could also consider combinations of five cubes that are themselves 3D, i.e., are not part of one layer of cubes. However, in addition to the 12 extruded pentominoes, 6 sets of chiral pairs and 5 pieces make total 29 pieces, resulting in 145 cubes, which will not make a 3D box (as 145 can only be 29×5×1, which the non-flat pentominoes cannot fit into).\n\n== Board game ==\n\nThere are [[board game]]s of skill based entirely on pentominoes. Such games are often simply called \"Pentominoes\".\n\nOne of the games is played on an 8×8 grid by two or three players. Players take turns in placing pentominoes on the board so that they do not overlap with existing tiles and no tile is used more than once. The objective is to be the last player to place a tile on the board. This version of Pentominoes is called \"Golomb's Game\".{{sfnp|Pritchard|1982|p=83}}\n\nThe two-player version has been [[solved board games|weakly solved]] in 1996 by Hilarie Orman. It was proved to be a first-player win by examining around 22 billion board positions.<ref>Hilarie K. Orman. [http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/orman.pdf Pentominoes: A First Player Win] (Pdf).</ref>\n\nPentominoes, and similar shapes, are also the basis of a number of other tiling games, patterns and puzzles.  For example, the French board game ''[[Blokus]]'' is played with 4 colored sets of [[polyominoes]], each consisting of every pentomino (12), tetromino (5), triomino (2) domino (1) and monomino (1). Like the game ''Pentominoes'', the goal is to use all of your tiles, and a bonus is given if the monomino is played on the very last move.  The player with the fewest blocks remaining wins.\n\nThe game of ''[[Cathedral (board game)|Cathedral]]'' is also based on [[polyominoes]].<ref>[http://www.cathedral-game.co.nz/hints.htm FAQ]</ref>\n\n[[Parker Brothers]] released a multi-player pentomino board game called ''Universe'' in 1966.  Its theme is based on an outtake from the movie [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]] in which the astronaut (seen playing chess in the final version) is playing a two-player pentomino game against a computer.  The front of the board game box features scenes from the movie as well as a caption describing it as the \"game of the future\".  The game comes with 4 sets of pentominoes in red, yellow, blue, and white.  The board has two playable areas: a base 10x10 area for two players with an additional 25 squares (two more rows of 10 and one offset row of 5) on each side for more than two players.\n\nGame manufacturer [[Lonpos]] has a number of games that use the same pentominoes, but on different game planes. Their ''101 Game'' has a 5 x 11 plane. By changing the shape of the plane, thousands of puzzles can be played, although only a relatively small selection of these puzzles are available in print.\n\n== Literature ==\nThe first pentomino problem, written by [[Henry Dudeney]], was published in 1907 in the Canterbury Puzzles.<ref>[http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/smmg/archive/1997/radin.html Pentominoes]</ref>\n\nPentominoes were featured in a prominent subplot of [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[Imperial Earth]]'', published in 1975. Clarke also wrote an essay in which he described the game and how he got hooked on it.<ref>''Could you solve Pentominoes?'' by Arthur C. Clarke, Sunday Telegraph Magazine, September 14, 1975; reprinted in Clarke's ''Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography'', New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1984. {{isbn|047187910X}}</ref>\n\nThey were also featured in [[Blue Balliett]]'s ''[[Chasing Vermeer]]'', which was published in 2003 and illustrated by [[Brett Helquist]], as well as its sequels, ''[[The Wright 3]]'' and ''[[The Calder Game]]''.<ref>Chasing Vermeer, by Blue Balliett, Scholastic Paperbacks, {{isbn|0439372976}}</ref>\n\nIn the New York Times crossword puzzle for June 27, 2012, the clue for an 11-letter word at 37 across was \"Complete set of 12 shapes formed by this puzzle's black squares.\"\n\n== Architecture ==\nOn several occasions, pentominoes had been used as decoration elements for outer walls of [[Plattenbau]] buildings, mainly in Eastern Europe. The patterns used were based on solutions of the 6×10 case puzzle.\n[[File:Plattenbau Pentomino.jpg|thumb|Plattenbau building decorated with Pentomino tiles]]\n\n== Video games ==\n* Lojix on the ''[[ZX Spectrum]]'' is clearly derived from pentomino, though it uses a non-standard set of 20 blocks and a 10*10 box.  Released in late 1983, the game was marketed via the announcement of a cash prize for the first person to solve the puzzle.\n* ''[[Tetris]]'' was inspired by pentomino puzzles, although it uses four-block tetrominoes. Some Tetris clones and variants, like the game ''5s'' included with [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs]], and ''[[Magical Tetris Challenge]]'', do use pentominoes.\n* ''[[Rampart (video game)|Rampart]]'' uses the pentominoes that fit in the 3x3 box in addition to smaller pieces.\n* ''[[Daedalian Opus]]'' uses pentomino puzzles throughout the game.\n* ''[[Yohoho! Puzzle Pirates]]'' carpentry minigame is based on pentomino puzzles.\n* ''[[Chime (video game)|Chime]]'' uses pentominoes for its pieces.\n* ''[[StreetPass Mii Plaza]]'' includes a downloadable game called StreetPass Mansion/Monster Manor, where the player must traverse a haunted mansion using monomino to pentomino shaped rooms as a path. Additionally, the player may meet other Mii's who will give the player puzzle boxes to solve, consisting of a number of monominoes to pentominoes which must all fit within the provided space.\n*Board game like  [http://cpc.scifinet.org/index.php/2017/04/15/pentomino/ Pentomino] for [[Amstrad CPC]] computers in 2017, with 464 puzzles.

      "text": "[[Image:Polyabolo.svg|200px|right]]\nIn [[recreational mathematics]], a '''polyabolo''' (also known as a '''polytan''') is a shape formed by gluing [[Special right triangles#45–45–90 triangle|isosceles right triangles]] edge-to-edge, making a [[polyform]] with the isosceles right triangle as the base form. Polyaboloes were introduced by [[Martin Gardner]] in his June 1967 \"[[Mathematical Games column]]\" in ''[[Scientific American]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gardner |first=Martin |authorlink=Martin Gardner |date=June 1967 |title=The polyhex and the polyabolo, polygonal jigsaw puzzle pieces |journal=Scientific American |volume=216 |issue=6 |pages=124–132}}</ref>\n\n==Nomenclature==\nThe name ''polyabolo'' is a [[back formation]] from the juggling object '[[diabolo]]', although the shape formed by joining two triangles at just one vertex is not a proper polyabolo. By false analogy, treating the di- in diabolo as meaning \"two\", polyaboloes with from 1 to 10 cells are called respectively monaboloes, diaboloes, triaboloes, tetraboloes, pentaboloes, hexaboloes, heptaboloes, octaboloes, enneaboloes, and decaboloes. \nThe name ''polytan'' is derived from Henri Picciotto's name ''tetratan'' and alludes to the ancient Chinese amusement of [[tangram]]s.\n\n==Combinatorial enumeration==\nThere are two ways in which a square in a polyabolo can consist of two isosceles right triangles, but polyaboloes are considered equivalent if they have the same boundaries. The number of nonequivalent polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, … triangles is 1, 3, 4, 14, 30, 107, 318, 1116, 3743, … {{OEIS|id=A006074}}.\n\nPolyaboloes that are confined strictly to the plane and cannot be turned over may be termed one-sided. The number of one-sided polyaboloes composed of 1, 2, 3, … triangles is 1, 4, 6, 22, 56, 198, 624, 2182, 7448, … {{OEIS|id=A151519}}.\n\nAs for a [[polyomino]], a polyabolo that can be neither turned over nor rotated may be termed fixed. A polyabolo with no symmetries (rotation or reflection) corresponds to 8 distinct fixed polyaboloes.\n\nA [[Simply connected|non-simply connected]] polyabolo is one that has one or more holes in it. The smallest value of ''n'' for which an ''n''-abolo is non-simply connected is 7.\n\n==Tiling rectangles with copies of a single polyabolo==\n\n[[Image:orderPolyabolos.png|Tiling rectangles with polyaboloes.|thumb|right]]\n\nIn 1968, [[David A. Klarner]] defined the ''order'' of a polyomino. Similarly, the order of a polyabolo P can be defined as the minimum number of congruent copies of P that can be assembled (allowing translation, rotation, and reflection) to form a [[rectangle]].\n\nA polyabolo has order 1 if and only if it is itself a rectangle. Polyaboloes of order 2 are also easily recognisable. [[Solomon W.

Polycube symmetries (conjugacy classes of subgroups of the achiral [[octahedral group]]) were first enumerated by W. F. Lunnon in 1972.  Most polycubes are asymmetric, but many have more complex symmetry groups, all the way up to the full symmetry group of the cube with 48 elements.  Numerous other symmetries are possible; for example, there are seven possible forms of 8-fold symmetry <ref name=symmetry/>\n\n==Properties of pentacubes==\nTwelve pentacubes are flat and correspond to the [[pentomino]]es. Of the remaining 17, five have mirror symmetry, and the other 12 form six chiral pairs.\n\nThe bounding boxes of the pentacubes have sizes 5x1x1, 4x2x1, 3x3x1, 3x2x1, 4x2x2, 3x2x2, and 2x2x2.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Pentacube.html Aarts, Ronald M. \"Pentacube.\" From MathWorld]</ref>\n\nA polycube may have up to 24 orientations in the cubic lattice, or 48 if reflection is allowed.

In addition, the plane tilings of the dihex and straight polyhexes are invariant under 180 degrees rotation or reflection parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the dihex (order 2 rotational and order 4 reflection symmetry), and the hexagon tiling and some other polyhexes (like the hexahex with one hole, below) are invariant under 60, 120 or 180 degree rotation (order 6 rotational and reflection symmetry).\n\nIn addition, the hexagon is a hexiamond, so all polyhexes are also distinct polyiamonds. Also, as an equilateral triangle is a hexagon and three smaller equilateral triangles it is possible to superimpose a large polyiamond on any polyhex, giving two polyiamonds corresponding to each polyhex. This is used as the basis of an infinite division of a hexagon into smaller and smaller hexagons (an irrep-tiling) or into hexagons and triangles.\n\nOf the polyhexes shown in the table, 2 have 6-fold rotation and reflection symmetry (thus also 3-fold and 2-fold symmetry), the monohex and the hexahex with a hole, 3 others have 3-fold rotation (the compact trihex, the pinwheel tetrahex and the hexahex looking like an equilateral triangle)  and 3-fold reflection symmetry, 9 others have 2-fold rotation and reflection, 8 have just two fold rotation, 16 just have 2-fold reflection and the other 78 (most of the tetrahexes, pentahexes or hexahexes) are asymmetrical. The tilings of most of the reflection-symmetrical polyhexes are also invariant under glide reflections of the same order by the length of the polyhex. No polyhex has an order of symmetry greater than six for reflection, rotation or glide.\n{| cellspacing=32\n|The Monohex: ||[[Image:Monocomb.svg|The Monohex]]\n|-\n|The Dihex: ||[[Image:Dicomb.svg|The Dihex]]\n|-\n|The 3 Trihexes: ||[[Image:Tricomb.svg|The 3 Trihexes]]\n|-\n|The 7 Tetrahexes: ||[[Image:Tetracomb.svg|The 7 Tetrahexes]]\n|-\n|The 22 Pentahexes: ||[[Image:Pentacomb.svg|The 22 Pentahexes]]\n|-\n|The 82 Hexahexes: ||[[Image:Hexacomb.svg|720px|The 82 Hexahexes]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tessellation]]\n*[[Percolation theory]]\n*[[Polyiamond]] - tilings with equilateral triangles\n*[[Polyomino]] - tilings with squares\n*[[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] - hydrocarbons whose structure is based on polyhexes\n*[[Rep-tile|Rep-tile - tilings of shapes that are made of smaller copies of themselves]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Polyforms}}\n\n[[Category:Polyforms]]"
