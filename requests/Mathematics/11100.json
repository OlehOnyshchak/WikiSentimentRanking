He was able to gain the support of the [[Grand Vizier]] [[Hadım Ali Pasha|Khadim Ali Pasha]], and became his ''[[diwan (poetry)|diwan]]'' secretary, who had had plenty of reasons to be annoyed with Mesihi.

The vizier, of Albanian descend himself,<ref>{{cite book|title=Türkçülük ve Türkçülük mücadeleleri tarihi|year=1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJSgAAAAMAAJ&q=Hadım+Ali+Paşa|page=53|trans-title=Turkism and Turkism struggle history| author= Ali Kemal Meram |location= Istanbul |publisher= Kültür Kitabevi|oclc= \t29396792|quote=10 – Hadım Ali Paşa (Arnavut-devşirme, köle)}}</ref> is quoted to have called him \"street-Arab\"<ref name=\"Wink\"/> or \"street boy\"<ref name=\"Elsie\"/> (Ottoman: Sheher Oglani). Nevertheless, Mesihi held his position until Khadim Pasha term ended in 1511 after his death during the [[Şahkulu Rebellion]]. Mesihi composed a deeply felt elegy on Vizier's death. He tried getting protection some other high rank officials.

These scripts underwent a process of purification and became known as \"Hâfiz Osman's style\". The younger generation of calligraphers preferred this style, and it gradually replaced Hamdullah's style.<ref>M. Ugur Derman, \"The Art of Calligraphy in the Ottoman Regime, in: Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu (ed.), ''History of Ottoman State and Civilisation'', II, Istanbul 2003, pp 645-652</ref>\n\nOsman was not only a fine calligrapher, but was also a master of layout. He raised text design to new heights, often incorporating different styles of calligraphy on the same page. His masterpiece is the Ottoman, ''[[Hilya|hilye]]''; a design template that includes eight distinct elements arranged aesthetically to provide for contemplative reflection and devotion. The elements are: ''Ba makan'' (prelude); ''Gobek'' (belly); ''Hilal'' (crescent); ''Ko'eler'' (corners); ''Ayak'' (verse); ''Etek'' (foot); ''Koltukar'' (alleys) and ''Pervaz'' (frame). His ''[[Hilya|hilye]]'' became the standard layout in the Ottoman world.<ref>Osborn, J.R., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.</ref>  \n\nA ''hilye'' is a calligraphic panel containing a [[hadith]]-based text describing the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]'s physical appearance and attributes. Hâfiz Osman incorporated such texts, which had been popular for some time, in a formal design that soon became standard for this art form. ''Hilye'' came to be used as wall decorations or surface adornments, fulfilling much the same function as figurative paintings in other religious traditions. While containing a concrete and artistically appealing description of Prophet's appearance, they complied with the strictures against figurative depictions of the Prophet, leaving his appearance to the viewer's imagination.<ref name=\"Peters2010\">{{cite book|author=F.

Habib Effendi further states that [[Mir Emad Hassani|Mir Emad]] (d. 1012/1603), perhaps the most admired master of [[nastaliq]], derived his style from Baba Shah.<ref>Habib Efendi, Khatt wa Khattdtdn ([[Constantinople]], 1305), in Shafi', 239.</ref> If correct, this information would put Baba Shah's birth at least sixteen years before [[Mir Ali Heravi|Mir 'Ali's]] death, or no later than 940/1533-34<ref>Although Baba Shah Isfahani quotes the poetry of [[Mir Ali Heravi|Mir 'Ali Haravi]] (Adab al-mashq, 268), we cannot be certain that he was a student of the latter. [[Mir Ali Heravi|Mir 'Ali Haravi's]] date of death has been put anywhere from 924/1518 to 976/1568, but the date of 951/1544 is found in a contemporary tazkira written in [[Herat]], Muzakkir-i Ahbab by Ilasan \"Nisari\"; cf.

Alvi, Publication of the Research Society of Pakistan, no. 55 (Lahore: Research Society of Pakistan, 1979), 11:477, n. 1.</ref>. On the other hand, Muhammad Qutb al-Din Yazdi wrote that he had met Baba Shah Isfahani in 995/1586-87, when the latter was still a young man, and he was amazed to see that he already excelled most of the calligraphers of the day. Qutb al-Din said that if he had lived longer, Baba Shah would have surpassed [[Sultan Ali Mashhadi|Sultan 'Ali Mashhadi]] and [[Mir Ali Heravi|Mir 'Ali Haravi]], and to achieve so much he must have had a divine gift<ref>Muhammad Qutb al-Din Yazdi, Risdla-i Qutbiyya, in Shafic, 249.</ref>. This information obviously conflicts with the statement of Habib Effendi, according to whom Baba Shah would have been over fifty at the very time when Qutb al-DIn commented on his youth; Qutb al-Din's statement also implies that Baba Shah died young, before realizing his full potential. Following the researches of the modern Iranian scholar Mehdi Bayani, we should accept the eyewitness account of Qutb al-Din, so that Baba Shah must have died in [[Baghdad]] in 996/1587-88; the modern attempt to link Baba Shah into the chain of the two greatest masters of nasta'liq cannot be demonstrated<ref>Baydni, 1:86. 'Ali Efendi's report that Baba Shah was the student of Mir 'Ali's best pupil, [[Ahmad Mashhadi|Sayyid Ahmad Mashhadi]] (d. 986/1578-79), also appears unlikely, since Baba Shah seems never to have left Isfahan (ibid., 46).</ref>.\"<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/603706?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 112, No. 2 (Apr. - Jun., 1992), pp. 279-286]</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:People from Isfahan]]\n[[Category:Iranian calligraphers]]\n[[Category:1500s births]]\n[[Category:16th-century people of the Safavid Empire]]\n[[Category:16th-century Iranian people]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:Persian calligraphy]]"

Since 1982, he has been teaching [[calligraphy]]; in addition, he has taught this art at other Artistic and Cultural Centers; from the early years of primary education in 1969, he became acquainted with the art of calligraphy. In his household, he practiced penmanship in company with his uncle, Mehdi Kamali Kurdistani, and in 1978, he went to Tehran to continue his academic studies.\n\nSimultaneous with his education in [[Tehran]], he did not lose his sight on practicing penmanship. In that very year, he became acquainted with the organization of Iranian Calligraphists Association; after enrolment in the presence of Prof. Abbas Akhavein (عباس اخوین), he started to acquire this art, and in 1982 he managed to receive his certificate of calligraphy with distinction from the Iranian Calligraphists Association.\n\nAfter receiving his certificate of calligraphy from Iranian Calligraphists Association in Tehran, he was singled out as the official instructor and officially started to teach calligraphy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.azizihonar.com/index.php?newsid=5607|title=دیدار جمعی از هنرمندان و مسئولان استان کردستان با استاد دکتر فاتح عزت پور|work=آثار هنرمندان ایران - عزیزی هنر|access-date=2018-05-08|language=fa}}</ref> Many art learners were taught by him in various courses of the association and so far, a great number of his students have managed to receive a certificate of calligraphy with distinction from the Iranian Calligraphists Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/504577/provinces/kordestan|title=تجلیل از دکتر فاتح عزت پور|website=www.khabaronline.ir|language=fa|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref>\n\n== Instructors ==\nIn the early days of 1969, Mr. Ezatpoor started to learn basic Nastaliq calligraphy from his uncle Mehdi Kamali Kurdistani which was his first mentor and teacher to learn Persian Calligraphy.

While Mr. Ezatpoor had an outstanding performance in Nastaliq script he got interested into Shekaste script (\"broken\" cursive calligraphy) and from 1980 he started to learn Shekaste from Yadollah Kaboli Khansari ([[یدالله کابلی]]) in Iranian Calligraphists Association.\n\nIn addition to that, Mr. Ezatpoor's exceptional illustration skills come from Biok Ahmari from 1983. Biok Ahmari (also [[بیوک احمری]]) was one of the best illuminators at the time and his illuminations have been recognized internationally. Mr. Ezatpoor spent few years learning This (Illumination that goes around the calligraphy artworks) from Mr. Ahmari which gave him an outstanding performance to illustrate his own artworks.\n\nLater in his artistic career, Mr. Ezatpoor continued to transfer this invaluable experience to hundreds of his students that many of them are currently professors in the field of Nastaliq and Shekaste scripts as well as Taz-hib. It worth mentioning that currently, the former students are illustrating Mr. Ezatpoor's artworks periodically.\n\n== Artistic and Scientific Degrees Received ==\nOn 2009, Mr. Ezatpoor was one of the first artists in Iran that received the Certificate of Grade I (equal to Doctoral Honorary Degree) recognized by the Ministry of Sciences, Researchers and Technology<ref>Based On Official Ershad Ministry Certificate No. 3497-1/4 On 23 February 2010, Iran</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kimiyayehonar.com/705/%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D9%8F%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AE%D8%B7-%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C%D9%82-%D9%85%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B2%D9%86%D8%AF/upgrade.php|title=کیمیای هنر - خوشنویسان كُرد در خط نستعلیق ممتازند|last=هنر|first=کیمیای|website=kimiyayehonar.com|access-date=2018-05-08}}</ref> for his outstanding artistic work and experience.

In a night, on his way to [[Turkish bath|Hamam]], Mir Emad was assassinated by Masud Beik Mesgar Qazvini, and for several days no one dared to bury his corpse. Finally his pupil, Abu Torab Khattat Esfahani, buried him in [[Maghsoudbeyk mosque]]. He was not allowed to build a mausoleum for Mir Emad.\n\n== Works and legacy ==\n\"Adab al-Masq\", a dissertation on penmanship, is attributed to Mir Emad.

Tahmasp I forgave him and took him from [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]] to [[Qazvin]]. In Qazvin, Sam Mirza was a companion of Tahmasp I. In 1549, Sam Mirza asked his brother to allow him to remain in a place for praying. Tahmasp I appointed him as custodian of the [[Sheikh Safi al-Din Khānegāh and Shrine Ensemble|mausoleum of Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] and the governor of [[Ardabil]]. At the time he was a governor and custodian and his house was the meeting place of scientists, poets and artists.\n\nIn 1561, Sam Mirza asked Tahmasp I to send him to Khorasan. The Shah agreed, but he changed his mind later and sent his and his two children to the [[Qahqaheh Castle|Qahqaheh castle]] near Adebil.

J. Alhabeeb'') (born مصدق جميل آل حبيب  on {{#dateformat:July 1, 1954}} in southern [[Iraq]]) is an [[Iraqi American]] contemporary [[calligrapher]] who follows the original traditions in Arabic-[[Islamic calligraphy]].  He is self-taught, and never studied under any master calligrapher, according to the traditional norm.\n\n==Biography==\nAlhabeeb's interest in the Arabic and [[Islamic calligraphy]] started early on when he was a child. Before he attended school at age five, he started to imitate the letters penned by his older brother who was interested in calligraphy too. He received great encouragement and praise from his second grade art teacher, who after discovering the child's early talent, started to ask him to show other students the right shape of letters on the blackboard. Alhabeeb soon discovered the famous instructional book in calligraphy by Iraq's prominent calligrapher Hashim Muhammad Al-Baghdadi.  He started to repeatedly imitate Al-Baghdadi's letters and follow his method in perfecting the shapes and movements of many [[Arabic script]]. He continued to practice this regular routine for many years. Despite the fact that he chose economics as a field of study, and went to become a full professor at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], he has been practicing calligraphy for more than four decades.\n\n==Personal Style==\nAlthough he practices classic calligraphy, his own style has been distinguished by a contemporary flare. The most notable aspect of his artistic style is the striking use of color, which has been scarcely used in the classic tradition, as calligraphy work remained dominated by black and white, with occasional use of gold and turquoise. Alhabeeb's extensive web site which includes a history of the development of Arabic script, has also an artist's statement, which highlights the major aspects of Alhabeeb's own style. In this statement, Alhabeeb states: “I tend to describe my work of calligraphy as \"neo-classical\" for maintaining the methods, manners, and techniques of the classic calligraphers since the 8th century, but I also follow a quasi-modern and personal approach,hdfhjv which could be characterized by:\n\n* The utilization of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] (Az-Zakhrafah Al-Arabia) as an integrative element of calligraphy, compared to its traditional employment. I define the traditional employment of Arabesque as either an occasional and partial use in a decorative framework out of the calligraphy space, or a full [[Deco]] art, unconnected to calligraphy, but standing by its own merit. In my integrative approach, I believe only a minimum use of selected motifs of arabesque is needed for my calligraphy projects to be functional and attuned. These motifs involve intricate ornamental patterns of interlaced lines and forms, often in botanical shapes such as stems, foliage and buds. They can perfectly lend themselves to the structural subtlety of lines and space of the written words, adding grace and luster, and allowing for the use of color. Colors of the calligraphy background are mostly dark, specifically the traditional solid black, and the foreground are mostly white or other light colors. Bright colors are also sporadically and carefully used, especially in the internal spacious frames, small motifs, and in the grammatical dots (An-Nuqat). All of these components are harmonized in a single integrative structure to present the calligraphy work as one unit. I believe that the major purpose for employing colors is to enhance the visual sensory and illuminate the fundamental cohesiveness of the image. Moreover, a modified minimum use of arabesque and color is essential to help emphasize the artistic abstract form of the epigraphical composition, without forcing the stylistic piece into becoming a mere [[decorative art]].\n* Another supporting element to this approach is the minimization of the text, which is deliberately sought to maximize the effectiveness of using the words as single components in a whole image. One justification for using a minimal text stems from my view that as the text becomes longer, the fragmentation of the image increases, and the control and manageability of the creative process become increasingly limited.\n* The innovative use of image repetition, symmetry, and the mirror effect. While these techniques are not new, reinvigorating and combining them with other methods and techniques is, and it is evident in my work.\n\n==Influences==\nOn his influences, Alhabeeb states: “My strong influences and inspirations were the towering talents of several generations of magnificent calligraphers and their distinct styles. The most important of these influences have been the calligraphers of the contemporary Baghdadi School spearheaded by Hashim Muhammad Al-Khattat Al-Baghdadi, and the earlier Ottoman School, represented by [[Sheikh Hamadullah Al-Amasi]] and a bunch of innovative star calligraphers who followed him.\n\n==Painting vs. Calligraphy==\nIn addition to being a classic calligrapher, Alhabeeb is a contemporary painter. Unlike many of his colleagues; painters who utilize the shape and style of the [[Arabic letters]] and words, and calligraphers who borrow some of the painting methods and styles, Alhabeeb does not mix calligraphy with painting. He treats them separately as independent genres, each with its own tradition and style. His calligraphy stays close to the classic Arabic and Islamic old school, which is free of any painting techniques. On the other hand, His painting has been described as Neo-[[cubism]] for borrowing and utilizing many of the cubists’ techniques. He worked as a graphic designer for many years, and won the first prize in three different national contests for designing postal stamps.  He has published numerous articles on art theory and philosophy, and recently released a book in Arabic entitled “Art, [[Creativity]], and [[Free will|Freedom]]”.\n\n==Publications==\n*Alhabeeb, M.J.

She is noted for her activism and is a champion of women's rights and also works to encourage peace and understanding between the Arab world and the West. These causes are reflected in her artwork.\n\n== Early life and career==\nAyla was born [[Baghdad]], Iraq and grew up in Baghdad and in Beirut, Lebanon. Ayla divided her time between Iraq, [[Lebanon]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], after which she lived in [[Europe]] for 15 years before travelling to the [[United States]] in 1991 and finally settling in San Francisco. <ref>Oweis, F. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Arab American Artists,'' ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 46 </ref>\n\nShe achieved BA Business from [[Sorbonne University]] in [[Paris]], as well as MA (Marketing & Business} from the American College in London and Webster University, Geneva. She also undertook art courses at the [[College of Marin]] in [[California]]. <ref>Oweis, F. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Arab American Artists,'' ABC-CLIO, 2008, pp 46-47</ref>\n\nWith more than 30 years experience as a photographer, she began painting in her early thirties and now combines photography with painting and collage to create unique mixed media painted photographs from her journeys to the [[Middle East]]. She makes extensive use of transfers which she uses to build up multi-layered images with texture and complexity. <ref>Oweis, F. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Arab American Artists,'' ABC-CLIO, 2008, pp 47-48</ref>\n\nShe is an activist; a champion of women's rights and also works to encourage peace and understanding between the Arab world and the West. These causes are reflected in her artwork and her public appearances.<ref>Oweis, F. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Arab American Artists,'' ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 48</ref> She gave a keynote address at a Red Cross Annual Meeting where she spoke about the historic legacy of the Arabs and its impact on today's world. Ayla has also appeared on national and local radio and television such as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''\"[[Good Morning America]]\"'' as a champion for Arab art culture and humanity.\n\n==Work ==\nA distinctive feature of Ayla's artwork is the use of Arab motifs such as calligraphy and the geometric patterns of [[Arabesque]]. Much of her work is produced in series, with each series dedicated to a specific geographic region. Her first series was entitled ''The Arab World Unveiled''; the second was ''The Mysteries of Egypt,'' and the third, which focused on the Levant (Lebanon, Syria and Jordan) was called ''Everyday Enchantment.'' A later series was called the ''Magic of Morocco.'' <ref>\"Halla Ayla,\" [Biographical Notes], [http://touchstonesofthesacred.com/artists/halla-ayla Online:]</ref> \n\nHer work has been exhibited throughout the [[Arab world]], UK, Europe and the US.\n\n===Select list of artworks ===\n\n* ''Calligraphy,'' 2005 \n* ''The Dreamer,''  [From the Mysteries of Egypt series], 2005 \n* ''Man on Camel'' [From the Arab World Unveiled Series]. c. 2005\n* ''Temple of Horus'', [From the Arab World Unveiled Series]. c. 2005\n* ''The Magic of Morocco'' date unknown\n* ''Everyday Enchantment in the Levant,'' date unknown\n\n=== Exhibitions ===\nAyla's principal exhibitions include: <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hallaaylaart.com/about-halla/solo-group-exhibits/|title=Solo and Group Exhibitions {{!}} Halla Ayla Art|website=hallaaylaart.com|access-date=2018-02-23}}</ref>\n*2004-2006: ''Arab World Unveiled,'' The San Anselmo Inn and Gallery, San Anselmo, CA<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Oweis, F.

This group aimed to locate a continuity between traditional and contemporary Iraqi art. During this period, he began to develop his own aesthetic, and was inspired by dramatic moments in Iraq's history.<ref>Smith, S., \"Befriended by a king, arrested, then forced to fight...

While Azzawi was not particularly drawn to impressionism as a style, the group encouraged artists to experiment with different styles, and also to pursue local themes as subject matter. Through his involvement in this group, he began to explore Arab cultural history and mythology, which became recurring themes in his work.<ref>Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 123; Shabout, N., \"Dia Azzawi: Ballads to Bilad al-Swad,\" ''Contemporary Practices Art Journal,'' Vol. 16, pp 42-49</ref> He continued his active involvement in Iraq's arts community by joining the group known as the [[Iraqi art#Jama’et Baghdad lil Fenal-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group)|Baghdad Modern Art Group]], founded by the artist and intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]], in 1951, and later the New Vision Group, for which he wrote the manifesto, which was published in a Baghdad newspaper in 1968.<ref>Shabout, N., \"Dia Azzawi: Ballads to Bilad al-Swad,\" ''Contemporary Practices Art Journal,'' Vol. 16, p. 49</ref> \n\nDuring a turbulent political period in Iraq, Azzawi served as a reservist in the Iraq army between 1966 and 1973, where he witnessed many atrocities.

His piece, ''My Broken Dream'' , a colossal monochromatic work, four meters in height and ten in length, is an assemblage of shapes, limps and swords, and it is an attempt to document a peoples pain, and in the written statement of the artwork, he writes, “Iraq is my inner soul.\" In addition, Azzawi doesn’t only give voice to his own plight, but to those who are silenced as well, including that of Palestine and Iraqi Kurdistan. One example, ''The Land of Sad Oranges,'' is a set of black and white drawings consisting of faceless heads and limp bodies, based on the short story of the same name by Palestinian writer, Ghassan Kanafani.  Azzawi was inspired to draw this set after Kanafani, a close friend of his, was murdered in 1972 by the Mossad<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=jKcTGNfUU5oC&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Imagining Home: Class, Culture, and Nationalism in the African Diaspora|last=Lemelle|first=Sidney J.|last2=Kelley|first2=Robin D.

In an interview with Saphora Smith for the Telegraph in 2016, Azzawi said, “I feel I am a witness. If I can give a voice to somebody who has no voice, that is what I should do,” and with this work he tries to document the inner struggle of refugees and explore themes of exile and displacement.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/art/artists/befriended-by-a-king-arrested-then-forced-to-fight-artist-dia-az/|title=Befriended by a king, arrested, then forced to fight...

Solayman\">[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fozuli \"Fozuli, Mohammad b.

Solayman\"/> He is believed to belong to [[Bayat (name)|Bayat]] [[tribe]], one of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes who were related to the Ottoman [[Kayı boyu|Kayı]] clan and were scattered throughout the [[Middle East]], [[Anatolia]], and the [[Caucasus]] at the time{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Though Fuzûlî's ancestors had been of [[nomad]]ic origin, the family had long since settled in towns.\n\nFuzûlî appears to have received a good education, first under his father—who was a [[mufti]] in the city of [[Al Hillah]]—and then under a teacher named Rahmetullah.<ref>Şentürk 281</ref> It was during this time that he learned the Persian and Arabic languages in addition to his native Azerbaijani. Fuzûlî showed poetic promise early in life, composing sometime around his twentieth year the important ''[[Masnavi (poetic form)|masnavi]]'' entitled ''Beng ü Bâde'' (بنگ و باده; \"Hashish and Wine\"), in which he compared the Ottoman [[Sultan]] [[Bayezid II]] to [[hashish]] and the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] [[shah]] [[Ismail I]] to [[wine]], much to the advantage of the latter.\n\nOne of the few things that is known of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the introduction to his collected Persian poems, he says: \"In the early days when I was just beginning to write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name\".<ref>Quoted in Andrews, 236.</ref> Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word ''fuzûlî''—which literally means \"impertinent, improper, unnecessary\"—because he \"knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else\".<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a [[Pun|double meaning]]—what is called ''tevriyye'' (توريه) in [[Poetry of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Divan poetry]]—as Fuzûlî himself explains: \"I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary ''fuzûl'' (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of ''fazl'' (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same [[Meter (poetry)#Ottoman Turkish|rhythm]] as ''‘ulûm'' (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and ''fünûn'' (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')\".<ref>''Ibid.''</ref>\n\nIn 1534, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]] [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Süleymân I]] conquered the region of [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]], where Fuzûlî lived, from the Safavid Empire. Fuzûlî now had the chance to become a court poet under the Ottoman [[Patronage|patronage system]], and he composed a number of ''[[Qasida|kasîde]]''s, or [[panegyric]] poems, in praise of the sultan and members of his [[retinue]], and as a result, he was granted a stipend. However, owing to the complexities of the Ottoman [[bureaucracy]], this stipend never materialized. In one of his best-known works, the letter ''Şikâyetnâme'' (شکايت نامه; \"Complaint\"), Fuzûlî spoke out against such bureaucracy and its attendant [[Political corruption|corruption]]:\n\n:سلام وردم رشوت دگلدر ديو آلمادىلر\n:''Selâm verdim rüşvet değildir deyü almadılar.''<ref>Kudret 189</ref>\n:I said hello, but they didn't accept as it wasn't a bribe.\n\nThough his poetry flourished during his time among the Ottomans, the loss of his stipend meant that, materially speaking, Fuzûlî never became secure. In fact, most of his life was spent attending upon the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi`ite]] [[Imam Ali Mosque|Tomb of `Alî]] in the city of an-Najaf, south of [[Baghdad]].<ref>Andrews 237</ref> He died during a [[Bubonic plague|plague]] outbreak in 1556, in Karbalā’, either of the plague itself or of [[cholera]].\n\n==Works==\n{{Original research|date=September 2007}}\n[[File:Story of Mejnun - in wilderness.jpg|thumb|200px|left|'''[[Layla and Majnun]]''']]\n{{Quote box|quote=یا رب بلای عشق ايله قيل آشنا منى<br />بیر دم بلای عشقدن ایتمه جدا منى<br />آز ايلمه عنایتونى اهل دردن<br />يعنى كی چوخ بلالره قيل مبتلا منى\n<br />''Yâ Rabb belâ-yı ‘aşk ile kıl âşinâ meni''<br />''Bir dem belâ-yı ‘aşkdan etme cüdâ meni''<br />''Az eyleme ‘inâyetüni ehl-i derdden''\n<br />''Ya‘ni ki çoh belâlara kıl mübtelâ meni''<ref>''Leylâ ve Mecnun'' 216</ref><br />Oh God, make me acquainted with the affliction of love!<br />For one moment make me not separated from the affliction of love!<br />Do not lessen your solicitude from the people of pain,<br />But rather, make afflicted me one more of them!|source=—Excerpt from ''Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnun''.|align=right}}\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Manuscript of the Hadiqat al-Su`ada (Garden of the Blessed) of Fuzuli - Muhammad bin Sulayman known as Fuzuli.jpg|thumb|upright|Manuscript of the ''Hadiqat al-Su`ada (Garden of the Blessed)'' of Fuzuli, 1602-3 C.E. [[Brooklyn Museum]].]]\n[[File:Fuzuli Divan.jpg|thumb|upright|A page from the collected poems of Fuzûlî]]\n\nFuzûlî has always been known, first and foremost, as a poet of [[love]]. It was, in fact, a characterization that he seems to have agreed with:\n\n:مندن فضولی ايستمه اشعار مدح و ذم\n:من عاشقام هميشه سوزوم عاشقانه دیر\n\n:''Menden Fuzûlî isteme eş'âr-ı medh ü zem''\n:''Men âşıkam hemîşe sözüm âşıkânedür''<ref>Tarlan 47</ref>\n\n:Don't ask Fuzûlî for poems of praise or rebuke\n:I am a lover and speak only of love\n\nFuzûlî's notion of love, however, has more in common with the [[Sufism#Basic beliefs|Sufi idea of love]] as a projection of the essence of [[Allah|God]]—though Fuzûlî himself seems to have belonged to no particular [[Tariqah|Sufi order]]—than it does with the [[Western culture|Western]] idea of [[romantic love]]. This can be seen in the following lines from another poem:\n\n:عاشق ايمش هر ن وار ﻋﺎﻝﻢ\n:ﻋلم بر قيل و قال ايمش آنجق\n\n:''‘Âşık imiş her ne var ‘âlem''\n:''‘İlm bir kîl ü kâl imiş ancak''<ref>Kudret 20</ref>\n\n:All that is in the world is love\n:And knowledge is nothing but gossip\n\nThe first of these lines, especially, relates to the idea of ''[[Wahdat-ul-Wujood|wahdat al-wujūd]]'' (وحدة الوجود), or \"unity of being\", which was first formulated by [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-‘Arabī]] and which states that nothing apart from various manifestations of God exists. Here, Fuzûlî uses the word \"love\" (عاشق ''‘aşk'') rather than God in the formula, but the effect is the same.\n\nFuzûlî's most extended treatment of this idea of love is in the long poem ''Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnun'' (داستان ليلى و مجنون), a ''mesnevî'' which takes as its subject the classical Middle Eastern love story of [[Layla and Majnun]]. In his version of the story, Fuzûlî concentrates upon the pain of the mad lover Majnun's separation from his beloved Layla, and comes to see this pain as being of the essence of love.\n\nThe ultimate value of the suffering of love, in Fuzûlî's work, lies in that it helps one to approach closer to \"the Real\" (''al-Haqq'' الحق), which is one of the [[99 Names of God|99 names of God]] in [[Islam]]ic tradition.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n\n===Works in [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani Turkic]]===\n* ''Dîvân'' (\"Collected Poems\")\n* ''Beng ü Bâde'' (بنگ و باده; \"Hashish and Wine\")\n* ''Hadîkat üs-Süedâ'' (حديقت السعداء; \"Garden of Pleasures\")\n* ''Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnûn'' (داستان ليلى و مجنون; \"The Epic of Layla and Majnun\")\n* ''Risâle-i Muammeyât'' (رسال ﻤﻌﻤيات; \"Treatise on Riddles\")\n* ''Şikâyetnâme'' (شکايت نامه; \"Complaint\")\n\n===Works in [[Persian language|Persian]]===\n* ''Dîvân'' (\"Collected Poems\")\n* ''Anîs ol-qalb'' (انیس القلب; \"Friend of the Heart\")\n* ''Haft Jâm'' (هفت جام; \"Seven Goblets\")\n* ''Rend va Zâhed'' (رند و زاهد; \"Hedonist and Ascetic\")\n* ''Resâle-e Muammeyât'' (رسال ﻤﻌﻤيات; \"Treatise on Riddles\")\n* ''Sehhat o Ma'ruz'' (صحت و معروض; \"Health and Sickness\")\n\n===Works in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]===\n* ''Dīwān'' (\"Collected Poems\")\n* ''Maṭla‘ ul-I‘tiqādi'' (مطلع الاﻋﺘﻘﺎد; \"The Birth of Faith\")\n\n===Translations into English===\n* Fuzuli.

[[National Art Museum of Azerbaijan]] ([[Baku]])]]\nAccording to the ''Encyclopædia Iranica'':{{cquote|Fuzuli is credited with some fifteen works in Arabic, Persian, and Turkic, both in verse and prose. Although his greatest significance is undoubtedly as a Turkic poet, he is also of importance to Persian literature thanks to his original works in that language (indeed, Persian was the language he preferred for his Shi'ite religious poetry); his Turkic adaptations or translations of Persian works; and the inspiration he derived from Persian models for his Turkic works.\n...\nThe fundamental gesture of Fozuli's poetry is inclusiveness. It links Azeri, Turkmen and Ottoman (Rumi) poetry, east and west; it also bridges the religious divide between Shiism and Sunnism. Generations of Ottoman poets admired and wrote responses to his poetry; no contemporary canon can bypass him.}}\n\n==Memorials==\nIn honor of Fizuli named:\n* Street and square in the center of [[Baku]], as well as the streets in many other cities of Azerbaijan;\n* [[Fizuli Rayon|District]] and [[Füzuli|city]] in Azerbaijan.\n* Villages [[Füzuli, Shamkir|Füzuli in Shamkir]] and [[Füzuli, Samukh|Füzuli in Samukh]] regions of Azerbaijan.\n* Institute of Manuscripts.

The Iraqi government executed Habeeb's brother Abdallah in 1982; they imprisoned Habeeb himself twice, most recently in 1997, tortured him, and left him with scars.  Habeeb's father, a prominent business and community leader among Iraq's [[Rabia (Iraq)|Rabia]] tribe, had been a supporter of the old [[List of Kings of Iraq|Hashemite monarchy]]; he  was killed in 1999.

The next day, he was charged for his failure to appear for special registration; the charging document falsely stated he had been required to do so. He was held three nights in [[Hill County, Montana|Hill County]] Jail. According to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Washington (ACLU-W), \"[d]uring that time, he was forced to strip naked in front of a government agent and was humiliated by other detainees who called him 'Saddam.'\" He was then flown to Seattle, transported through the airport.

He is noted for his involvement in various Iraqi and Arabic art movements including the [[Hurufiyya movement]] which bridged the gap between traditional and modern Iraqi art.\n\n==Life and career==\n\nHamoudi started out as a self-taught sculptor in [[Baghdad]]. He developed a naturalistic style. <ref name=\"Barjeel\">{{cite web|title=Jamil Hamoudi|url=http://www.barjeelartfoundation.org/artist/iraq/jamil-hamoudi/|website=Barjeel Art Foundation|accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref>In 1944, he was taken on to teach drawing and art history at a school in Baghdad. At the same time he attended classes at the [[Baghdad College of Fine Arts]]. He graduated in 1945 and in 1947, took a government scholarship to go to [[Paris]], to study at the [[École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], [[Académie Julian]], and [[École du Louvre]]. He also Hamoudi researched the Assyrian-Babylonian art and languages.<ref>Naef, S., ''A la Recherche d'une Modernité Arabe: L'évolution des arts Plastiques en Egypte, au Liban et en Irak, Slatkine, 1996, p. 394</ref>\n\nIn 1943, he created what has been described as the first Iraqi sculpture; a figure of the 11th-century philosopher-poet, [[Al-Maʿarri]].<ref>Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabe,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 41</ref> By 1947, he was experimenting with abstract paintings using Arabic characters, and as such was one of the early pioneers of hurufiyya art.<ref>Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76</ref> This led him on a path to discover the graphic possibilities of the letter in art.<ref>Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabe,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147</ref> \n\nCertain art historians regard him as the \"founding father\" of the [[hurufiyya movement]] (alphabetical art movement or Letrism movement). <ref>Bocco, R., Bozarslan, H. and Sluglett, P., ''Writing The Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges,'' World Scientific, 2012, p. 478</ref> However, other scholars have suggested that the movement began somewhat earlier with the work of the Iraqi-American artist, [[Madiha Omar]] who exhibited huryifiyya artwork in 1949 in Washington.<ref>Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119</ref> Whether he was the movement's founder, or simply helped to popularise the hurufiyya genre, there can be little doubt that he was a leading light in Iraq's modern art movement.<ref>Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76</ref>\n\nHe defined his use of Arabic script in the context of rediscovering his own heritage, amid his studies of European art. He wanted to cling onto his own values and traditions as a means of avoiding being overtaken by experiences outside his own heritage. He wrote that there was nothing more sacred that the Arabic alphabet, <ref>Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S. and Shabout, N.M., ''New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century,'' Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32</ref> saying that his art was \"a form of prayer.\"<ref>Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabe,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 41</ref>\n\nHamoudi actively contributed to Iraqi arts culture through his membership of various art groups and societies in Iraq, and by organising exhibitions for up-coming artists, at a time when Iraq had no public galleries. In 1952, he organised an exhibition, entitled ''L'Ensemble \"A\"'' at the Institut Endoplastique in Paris.<ref>Miller, D., Lemoine, S. and  Mosquera, G., ''Carmen Herrera: Lines of Sight,'' Yale University Press, 2016, p. 201 </ref> In 1971, he became a founding member of the [[One Dimension Group]], started by  his friend and colleague, artist and intellectual, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]]. <ref>Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117</ref> In 1971 he joined the [[One Dimension Group]] when it was founded by [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] and which sought to use art as a means of developing a sense of national identify. Jamil defined his use of Arabic script as a rediscovery of Iraqi heritage, withih the confines of European abstract art. <ref>Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S., Shabout, N.N., ''New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century,'' \nThames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32</ref> Hamoudi and the art groups in which he was involved were largely responsible for bridging the gap between modernity and heritage, and establishing Iraqi modern art. <ref>Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30</ref>\n\nIn 1973 he was appointed as Director of Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture.<ref name=kember>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| last = Kember| first = Pamela| title = Benezit Dictionary of Asian Artists| accessdate = |date = 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Work== \nHamoudi's early works reveal the influence of [[cubist|Cubism]] movement and later he identified himself with the [[surrealist]] movement. In time, however, he distanced himself from Surrealists, claiming:<ref name=kember/> \n\n{{blockquote| \"A dark, saturnine atmosphere emanated from [their canvases] the effect of which was to arouse a feeling of despair in human beings.\" }}\n\nUltimately, he developed his own style; one that referenced his Iraqi heritage, but also used modern techniques. His paintings are brightly colored and make use of geometric shapes like circles, triangles and arches, often in repeating patterns, a reference to [[Arabesque]].<ref>Massignon, L., ''Opera minora: Islam, Culture et Société Islamiques,'' Dar-el-Maaref Liban, 1963,p. 231</ref> For sculpture he frequently used plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.d\n\n===Publications===\n* ''Peintures, Sculptures, Dessins de Jamil HAMOUDI un artiste de Bagdad'', Paris, Librairie Voyelle, 1950\n\n===Select list of paintings and drawings===\n* ''Sheytan,'' (The Devil), 1942,  gouache on paper, 50 X 35cm\n* ''Composition Absraite,'' 1950, India ink and watercolor, 32 X 24cm) \n* ''Huryfieh ,'' 1982, ink on paper, 70 X 100cm  \n* ''Surat Abasa,'' 1982, pen on paper, 69 X 69cm \n* ''Ezkor Rabbak Eza Nasayt,'' (If Ever Forgetful Mention Allah), 1985 oil on canvas, 87 X 129cm  (now in the collection of the Barjeel Foundation)<ref>Barjeel Foundation, [http://www.barjeelartfoundation.org/collection/if-ever-forgetful-mention-allah/ Online:]</ref>\n* ''A Trip to Baghdad,'' 1996, oil on canvas, 69.5 X 69.5cm\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic art]]\n* [[Islamic calligraphy]]\n* [[List of Iraqi artists]]\n\n==External link==\n* [http://artiraq.org/maia/items/browse?collection=110 Jamil Hamoudia at Art Iraq] - digital resource maintained by Iraqi artists which includes reproductions of works lost or damaged during the 2003 invasion, and not accessible via any other reliable public source\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hamoudi, Jamil}}\n[[Category:1924 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century artists]]\n[[Category:20th-century calligraphers]]  \n[[Category:20th-century painters]] \n[[Category:20th-century sculptors]]\n[[Category:Abstract artists]]\n[[Category:Abstract sculptors]]\n[[Category:Artist authors]]\n[[Category:Artists from Baghdad]]\n[[Category:Iraqi artists]]\n[[Category:Iraqi calligraphers]]\n[[Category:Iraqi painters]]\n[[Category:Iraqi sculptors]]"

He is often called the 'father of Iraqi modern art.'\n\n== Life and career ==\nHassan was born in [[Baghdad]] in 1914 into a poor family. His father had died before the infant, Hassan, was born. As a child, he helped his mother who made folkloric clay statues of Arab [[Bedouin]]s and local farmers. As a young boy, he visited his uncle who was working as a gardener for [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal I]] where the King saw the boy drawing a horse. Recognising his talent, the King promised to give the young artist a scholarship. However, the King died in 1933 before he could carry out his promise.<ref>\"Profile: Faik Hassan,\" ''Al Jazeera'', 31 October 2005, [https://www.aljazeera.com/archive/2005/10/20084101200333393.html Online\"]</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1930s, Hassan gave art lessons at a local school, and when the new [[Faisal II of Iraq|King Faisal II]] visited his school, he ordered that Hassan be sent to Paris to study art, thus fulfilling his father's earlier promise to the young boy.

Practice awakens the knowledge gradually stored up in the body and releases the expression of a myriad of nuances. [Calligraphic] codes serve to control the internal excitement and prevent his feelings from overflowing... but the calligrapher must pass beyond these set rules. To achieve his aim, he must first conform to these restrictions, and then go beyond them.

The most wonderful Chinese antiques and masterpieces were organised and displayed in the main hall of the Institute so we, the students, could see them dozens of times every day. What attracted our attention and made us marvel most was a beautiful masterpiece {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} fourteen ivory balls of varying sizes, all contained inside one ball, revolving smoothly around their pivot. Personally, however, I was drawn to the collection of watercolours and Chinese ink prints. Most of these were by the internationally renowned artist [[Qi Baishi]] (1864-1954) [sic] whose work I closely followed in his hometown of Beijing. Since that time, I became quite attached to traditional Chinese painting and realised that it differs in many aspects from European art.}}\n\nWhile studying in China, under the guidance of Huang Yu Yi (b. 1927), al-Nasiri developed a passion for calligraphy, and began to devise ways to include Arabic letters in his paintings and prints.<ref>Porter, V, ''Word into Art: Artists of the Modern Middle East,'' London, BMP, (2006) 2008; \"Rafa al-Nasiri\" [Biographical Notes], ''Station Museum,'' [http://stationmuseum.com/?page_id=2925 Online:]</ref> In this way, al-Nasiri became a very early practitioner of an art form that became known as [[hurufiyya movement|hurufiyya]].<ref>Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., \"Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective,\" ''South Atlantic Quarterly.

His creative and powerful [[sculptures]] and [[reliefs]] have been exhibited in museums, galleries, international shows, studios, and private residencies throughout the U.S., Western Europe, and the Middle East. Al-Zahawi's works derive much inspiration from African Art, select Western artists, and his own background as an Iraqi Muslim.\n\nAl-Zahawi was born in Baghdad, Iraq, the son of an Iraqi lawyer from a prominent family of Kurdish origin, Dhafir Al-Zahawi, whose grand-uncle was the progressive Iraqi poet and scholar, [[Jamil Sidqi al-Zahawi|Jamil Sidqi Al-Zahawi]]. As a budding artist, Al-Zahawi in the late 1950s began experimenting with a wide variety of artistic mediums eventually selecting ceramic sculptures constructed using the method of [[coiling]]. His forms have been described as \"ancient\", \"whimsical\", \"sensual\", \"aggressive\", and \"powerful\" all achieved through the textures, hollow spaces, earthy hues, and angular shapes that define this body of work.\n\nAl-Zahawi lived most of his life outside of his native Iraq, residing in Geneva, Switzerland where he worked with the United Nation's [[International Telecommunication Union]]. In his later years he lived in Cairo, Egypt and later in California. While war, sanctions, and civil strife thwarted his desire to eventually return to Iraq, he was able to portray his pride and love for his heritage through his art. Glyn Uzzell an artist and art teacher, as well as long-time mentor of Al-Zahawi, once wrote \"It is clear that Zahawi has drawn strength and inspiration from a number of separate entities to forge a single style, uniquely his own.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uzzell|first1=Glyn|title=About the Artist|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|website=Zahawi Art|accessdate=14 December 2016|archiveurl=http://www.worldcat.org/title/muqbil-zahawi-sculptures-and-reliefs-terracotta-january-15-march-6-1994-riverside-art-museum/oclc/46789956&referer=brief_results|archivedate=1994}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Al-Zahawi Graduation (1957).png|thumb|Al-Zahawi Graduation (1957)]]\nMuqbil Al-Zahawi was born in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] to Dhafir Al-Zahawi and Najia [[Baban]], the last of seven children. His father was an Iraqi lawyer hailing from a long line of prominent Iraqis, which included bureaucrats, religious authorities ([[Mufti]]), poets, and scholars of Kurdish origin. He lived in Baghdad and attended the Jesuit's [[Baghdad College]] as well as the Institute of Fine Arts as an aspiring pianist. In 1950, at the age of 15 years old, Al-Zahawi moved to Cairo, Egypt with his mother. The popular uprising that overthrew [[King Farouk]] in 1952 and the eventual rise of the populist leader, [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]], instilled a sense of pride and patriotism in Al-Zahawi, which heavily influenced his life and his art. After moving to Santa Ana, California in 1952, he pursued different creative enterprises from drawing to fashion, music to acting, and eventually graduated with a B.A. in International Relations from the [[University of Southern California]] in 1957.\n\n== Beginnings as a Ceramicist ==\nIn 1958 Al-Zahawi moved to London to begin his post-graduate studies at the [[University College London]] in international relations. It was in London that Al-Zahawi decided to devote time to nurture his creative passions by simultaneously enrolling at London's [[Central School of Art and Design]]. At the Central School of Art, he began to devote his time to understanding [[terracotta]] ceramic sculptures, where he selected the [[coiling]] method. Through coiling, he felt he had complete control over the power evoked from his sculptures, which could not be achieved by the pinching method or throwing on a mechanical wheel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lakeside Pottery Tutorial|title=Throwing a Pot|url=http://www.lakesidepottery.com/Pages/Pottery-tips/Throwing-a-pot-Lakeside-Pottery-Tutorial.htm|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Comparing 1961 to 1998 sculptures.png|thumb|left|Comparing Al-Zahawi's Sculptures from 1961 to 1998 (right to left)]]\n\nAl-Zahawi's early works took on more simplistic designs, extenuated by smoother lines, colorless texture (lacking stain), and relatively uniform spaces. This began to change when Al-Zahawi was introduced to [[primitive art]], especially African Art through visits to the [[British Museum]] among other galleries and museums. Without a doubt [[African sculpture]] had a profound influence on his art thereafter. He would later travel and live in Africa (1965-1967) as a civil servant for the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|United Nations' mission in the Congo]], only serving to reinforce his love and admiration of African art.\n\n== Switzerland ==\n[[File:Al-Zahawi Studio (1964).png|thumb|Al-Zahawi Studio (1964)]]\n\nAfter completing his post-graduate diploma at University College London and studies at the Center School of Art, Al-Zahawi began PhD studies at the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]]. It is here that his art began to flourish and receive critical acclaim. His first one-man show took place at Galerie Club and Galerie Connaitre in 1962. During this time he also forged close bonds with the artists at Galerie Contemporaine in Carouge, Geneva including Glyn Uzzell, where he became one of the permanent artists from 1964-1982. Glyn Uzzell said, \"when Muqbil Zahawi presented his first exhibition of ceramic sculpture in Geneva in 1962, it was immediately clear that one was in the presence of a highly original artist.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uzzell|first1=Glyn|title=About the Artist (Abridged 1990)|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|website=Zahawi Art|accessdate=14 December 2016|archiveurl=http://www.worldcat.org/title/muqbil-zahawi-sculptures-and-reliefs-terracotta-january-15-march-6-1994-riverside-art-museum/oclc/46789956&referer=brief_results|archivedate=1994}}</ref>\n\nAfter several years abroad, Al-Zahawi returned to Geneva in 1967 to begin working with the [[International Telecommunication Union]]. During this time, Al-Zahawi found fortune exhibiting all over Switzerland and Europe. He also began to experiment with new techniques including enlarging his sculptures and coloring his creations with his proprietary staining method. One of his most notable exhibitions of this period in the 1960s was a one-man show at the prestigious Musee Ariana in Geneva.<ref>{{cite web|title=Museum Ariana Brochure (1993)|url=http://www.ville-geneve.ch/fileadmin/public/Departement_2/Publications/musee-ariana-brochure-1993-ville-de-geneve.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2016|archiveurl=http://www.ville-ge.ch/archivesenligne/assets/archives/cra/1969/pdf/cra_1969.pdf|archivedate=1969}}</ref> His work was well received and some of his pieces were later acquired by the Museum as part of their permanent collection.\n\n[[File:Ariana Museum Exhibition (1969).png|thumb|left|Ariana Museum Exhibition (1969)]]\n\nIn 1973 Al-Zahawi received a rare opportunity to undertake a one-man show in Neuchatel, Switzerland in the large exhibition halls of the [http://www.mahn.ch/ Musee d’Art et d’Historie]. What concerned him was the imbalance between the floor pieces and the abundance of bare wall space. He confided in Glyn Uzzell who suggested that Al-Zahawi try wall reliefs to compliment his sculptures.\n[[Reliefs]], as it turned out, was the perfect medium for his work given that this style of artistic display is historic in nature and therefore well-suited to Al-Zahawi's art that itself evokes an ancient and mysterious aura. He began to try his hands at various relief sizes, sketching each block, and masterfully bringing his sketches to life. Through this experiment he was able to open up his work to a whole new audience that appreciated and actively acquired his wall mounted ceramic art.\n\nThe Neuchatel exhibition also pushed Al-Zahawi to test the bounds of physics by constructing much larger pieces. He endured a number of setbacks in the process where he created pieces that were too large to transport, bake (fire), and exhibit. After several attempts, he discovered that by creating the sculptures in two parts, one fitting inside the other for balance, he could build sculptures of the height and magnitude he hoped. The result: The Three Warriors, each over 6 feet tall, which became the center pieces that anchored the Neuchatel exhibition.\n\n[[File:The Three Warriors - Neuchatel Exhibition (1973).png|thumb|center|The Three Warriors - Neuchatel Exhibition (1973)]]\n\n== Iraqi Artists & Baghdad ==\n[[List of Iraqi artists|Iraqi artists]] have consistently been at the forefront of new and innovative works of creative genius in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pocock|first1=Charles|title=Art in Iraq Today|url=http://www.contemporarypractices.net/essays/volumeix/thereasonfortheproject.pdf|accessdate=14 December 2016|quote=Recognized ceramicists include Muqbil Al-Zahawi}}</ref> From poets to scholar, sculptors to painters, the community of Iraqi artists, local and international, experimented with avant-garde and cutting-edge art, and found an insatiable audience that was often blind to [[List of Iraqi women artists|gender]], socio-economic status, or identity.

While Al-Zahawi had resided outside of the Middle East since 1952, he did have the opportunity to exhibit in Iraq in 1974 and again in 1977 at the behest of the Iraqi government.\n\n[[File:Catalogue Cover - Baghdad Museum of Modern Art Exhibition (1977).png|thumb|center|Catalogue Cover - Baghdad Museum of Modern Art Exhibition (1977)]]\n\nHis 1977 exhibit offered an opportunity for Al-Zahawi to reengage his roots through his art.<ref>{{cite web|title=1977 Baghdad Exhibition Catalogue|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> The exhibition showcased a number of unique pieces, and as a result of his hard work, the show was a resounding success, receiving patrons from all over Baghdad. Some of his pieces were eventually purchased for permanent acquisition by the Museum of Modern Art in Baghdad and [http://www.nationalgallery.org/ National Gallery of Fine Arts] in Amman, Jordan. Though this exhibition would be the last time Al-Zahawi would return to his native Iraq, given the political instability that beleaguered the nation, his love for Iraq remained steadfast and continued to be visible in his art thereafter.\n\n[[File:Al-Amirayah Bunker (1992).png|thumb|center|[[Amiriyah shelter bombing|Al-Amiriyah]] Bunker (1992) in honor of those Iraqis killed when U.S. Forces bombed a civilian bomb shelter in 1991]]\n\n== Later years ==\nAl-Zahawi ushered in the 1980s with style undertaking several successful exhibitions including one in Sion, Switzerland in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zahawi: Sion Exhibition|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/235269/files/BCV_NB_483_1980_03.pdf|publisher=13 Toiles, Reflets du Valais, No. 3  (March 1980).|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> However, Al-Zahawi left Geneva in 1982 and took a prolonged hiatus that saw him exhibit only a handful of times in California and later Cairo, where he had relocated with his family. \n \n[[File:Al-Zahawi Sion Exhibition (1980).png|thumb|Galerie Grand Fontaine Exhibition, Sion, Switzerland (1980)]]\n\nIn 1994 he had a received a fairly large commission for a collective show at the Riverside Art Museum in Riverside, California.<ref>{{cite web|title=Riverside Art Museum Exhibition Catalogue (1994)|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> Of the exhibition, a critic said that \"Among the dimensions that Zahawi's methods brings to his work are not only the clear signs of the artist's hands seen on every piece, but include a generous measure of the artist's emotional attitudes in all their variety.

With this one-man show, he brought to a close an illustrious career that spanned five decades. From 1958-1998 he exhibited in various countries across Europe, the Middle East and the U.S. in countless galleries, museums, international shows, studios and private residencies.\n\n[[File:Al-Zahawi Studio (1998).png|thumb|center|Al-Zahawi in his Altkirch studio preparing for final exhibition (1998)]]\n\n== Influences ==\nAl-Zahawi had several notable influences in the development of his art. Glyn Uzzell commented \"Muqbil Zahawi was born in Baghdad, but has studied and lived in the United States for long periods. He has also lived and worked in Africa. Whether consciously acquired or unconsciously assimilated, the influences of these widely differing cultures are reflected in his art.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uzzell|first1=Glyn|title=About the Artist|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|accessdate=14 December 2016|archiveurl=http://www.worldcat.org/title/muqbil-zahawi-sculptures-and-reliefs-terracotta-january-15-march-6-1994-riverside-art-museum/oclc/46789956&referer=brief_results|archivedate=1994}}</ref> Indeed, African art dominated his early works and continued throughout his life. The powerful images of the art from the continent were especially powerful to Al-Zahawi, who saw them as direct, unequivocal, and uncompromising.\n\n[[File:Witch Doctor (1975).png|thumb|left|Witch Doctor (1975) demonstrates a strong influence of African Art]]\n\nAs he began to study and interact with the works of European artists, he infused their influences in his art. This was especially visible in Al-Zahawi's reliefs (''see'' '''Seated Lady''' in Gallery section), which allowed him to create images that were influenced by his contemporaries, such as Henry Moore and Pablo Picasso who dominated the art scene throughout Al-Zahawi's active years.\n\nAlongside these influences was his own background as an Iraqi and a Muslim. As a firm believer in Pan-Arabism and the zeitgeist of the 1960s and 1970s, his art began to reflect a sense of nationalism and historical significance. This related not only political sentiments but also religious narratives. It is \"no coincidence that the climax of [his] body of work, with their tense and vibrant shapes, coincided with the effects of the volatile political landscape of his day.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zahawi|first1=Hamada|title=Ode to my Father (2004)|url=http://zahawiart.com/biography.html|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> He once said, \"Art should move people because of its total inner as well as outer form, not just by a work's decorative aspects. People do not need to fall in love with it, but it must elicit a strong emotional feeling,\" a feeling very much rooted in the political milieu of the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zahawi Art: News & Press|url=http://zahawiart.com/newspress.html|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" widths=\"300px\" heights=\"205px\">\nFile:Sabra and Shatilia (1992).png|[[Sabra and Shatila]] – Ceramic Relief (1992) in honor of those massacred in 1982\nFile:No Victor But God - Relief (1977).png|\"No Victor But God\" - Relief (1977)\n</gallery>\n\nThe influences of his art not only dictated the shapes, colors, and designs, but also the display of his art with rougher textures, muted colors, and more edgy forms, all captured by his unique artistic methodology. One well known British art critic, [[Peter Fuller]], commented, \"The fantastic imagery of Eastern craftsmanship, with its perpetual insistence of a combination of fantastic, formal opulence and executive precision, syntheises with a proto-surrealist relish in suggestively aggressive symbol…they remain among the more powerful creations of his genre.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peter|first1=Fuller|title=Review of Zahawi Exhibition at Ansdell Gallery|publisher=The Arts Review (London)|date=September 21, 1971}}</ref>\n\n== Methodology ==\nThrough decades of experience, Al-Zahawi was able to formulate unique methods in creating his work that not only served to distinguish him as an artist but ensured his contribution to the field of ceramics through his novel approach in sketching, sculpting, and staining.\n\n=== Sketching ===\nAl-Zahawi began the process of his art through musings and pencil sketches. He notes that often these ideas come to him in his dreams, forcing him to wake up late at night to put the designs to paper so as to capture them in their most accurate and vivid form. Often these sketches, each unique in their own right, are combined and refined to eventually come to life through his art.\n\n[[File:Artist's Sketches.png|thumb|center|Sketches of reliefs and sculptures from various exhibitions]]\n\n=== Coiling ===\nThrough the process of developing his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method.<ref>{{cite web|title=Making a Clay Coiled Pot|url=http://www.lakesidepottery.com/Pages/Pottery-tips/Making-a-clay-coiled-pot-Lakeside-Pottery-Tutorial.htm|publisher=Lakeside Pottery Tutorial|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref> The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles as sharp as 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zahawi Art: The Making of the Art|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/ggallery/index.html|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Al-Zahawi Coiling (1998).png|thumb|center|Al-Zahawi demonstrating coiling during his final exhibition in 1998]]\n\n=== Reliefs ===\nReliefs are slightly more complicated than his sculptures. The pieces have to be completed as quickly as possible, sometimes within one day, so that they do not dry and contract in size. When a relief was finished, Al-Zahawi would cut the relief into equal sized cross-sections that fit wooden squares (approximately 8 inches sq.) so as to allow each square to have its own design portion. Each square is then fired at 1000&nbsp;°C (biscuit firing). Once firing is complete, each square is mounted back onto a large wooden surface to reconstruct the relief into its original design. Often the pieces do not align perfectly but this adds a more unique and creative element to the final finish.\n\n[[File:Sketch and Relief (1998).png|thumb|center|The relief coming to life from a sketch 'The Smoker', and the cross-cutting process before relief is baked (1998)]]\n\n=== Staining ===\nAs Glyn Uzzell noted, \"Zahawi rejects the use of glazes, feeling that they can disguise the artist's intention with a superficially enhancing gloss. All of his works are stained in the natural colors of earth or atmosphere, and in a manner that shows the direct presence of the artist's hand.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Uzzell|first1=Glyn|title=About the Artist|url=http://www.zahawiart.com/flipbook/index.html|website=Zahawi Art|accessdate=14 December 2016|archiveurl=http://www.worldcat.org/title/muqbil-zahawi-sculptures-and-reliefs-terracotta-january-15-march-6-1994-riverside-art-museum/oclc/46789956&referer=brief_results|archivedate=1994}}</ref> Al-Zahawi overtime concocted his own recipe of wax, [[turpentine]], and powder from various minerals to achieve the right composition to stain his sculptures and reliefs.\n\n[[File:Al-Zahawi Staining (1970s).png|thumb|center|Al-Zahawi staining in his studio for the Venice exhibition (1976)]]\n\nThe stains or mineral powder (such as [[Hematite]]) are earth colors in various hues of brown, black, green, and blue. These colors are also accented by the original colors of the [[clay]] (red, white, or gray) to provide a further rich texture. After the stain is applied to the ceramic piece, Al-Zahawi would use a cloth with turpentine to remove some of the stain and reveal the texture of clay and patterns of the rib tool. The stain is then protected by a transparent wax that has limited shine but nevertheless allows the colors and shades of the stain and the rich texture to become more pronounced.

He was also an accomplished printmaker, having his work exhibited at the International Print Biennial in [[Tokyo]].<ref name=\"grove\">\"Anwar Jalal Shemza\", ''Grove Art Online''.</ref>\n\n==Early life and career==\n\nShemza was born Anwar Jalal [[Bhat clan|Butt]] into a [[Kashmiri people|Kashmiri]]<ref>Muhammad Yusuf Abbasi, ''Pakistani culture: a profile'', National Institute of Historical and Cultural Research (1992), p. 310</ref> family in [[Shimla]], [[India]], in 1928. His grandfather owned a carpet business in [[Lahore]] while his father Khaja Butt was a [[civil servant]]. He was educated in schools in Shimla, [[Ludhiana]] and Lahore. While he studied [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]] and [[philosophy]] at [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]] in 1943, he switched to art in the following year, enrolling at the Mayo School of Art and obtaining a diploma in 1947.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n==Pakistani artist and writer==\n\nIn 1947, he opened the Shemza Commercial Art Studio in Lahore and adopted the name Anwar Jalal Shemza. He quickly became a leading figure in Pakistan's cultural life. Shemza was the editor of ''Ehsas'', a magazine on art and [[architecture]]. He published seven novels in Urdu most notably ''Sotey jagtey'' published in 1957 as well as poetry such as Kissa kahani (Folk tales and stories) from 1954. [[Radio Pakistan]] broadcast his plays.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\nShemza was a leading member of a modernist group called the Lahore Art Circle. His early works showed a distinct geometric structure. He studied at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]]<ref name=\"grove\" /> in London and gained a diploma of fine art from [[University College London|University College]]. In 1960, he obtained a scholarship from the [[British Council]] to study printmaking with [[Anthony Gross]] for another year. While in Britain, he married English artist Mary Katrina.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n==British career==\n\nShemza and his wife returned to Pakistan at first but they moved to Katrina's hometown of [[Stafford]] in England in 1962. He worked as an arts teacher at [[Ounsdale High School]] between 1962 and 1979 and at [[Weston Road High School]] as head of art and design between 1979 and 1985.  It was while teaching at Ounsdale that Shemza's daughter Tasveer, aged six, designed one of Britain's first series of Christmas stamps. Tazveer’s design, featuring [[King Wenceslas]], was chosen by eight professional stamp designers from 5,000 entries in a ''[[Blue Peter]]'' competition.\n\nIn England, Shemza started to incorporate Islamic themes into his work. His ''Meem'' series of the 1960s was based on the first letter of the prophet [[Mohammed]]'s name. His ''Roots'' series started in the 1970s and showed imaginary plants and roots derived from [[Arabic]] script below, while his [[silkscreen]] ''The Page'' from 1984 showed Arabic [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in illegible patterns.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\nExhibitions of Shemza's works were held in London, [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Lahore]], [[Karachi]] and [[Oxford]]. The ''Roots'' exhibition toured Pakistan <ref name=\"grove\" /> after his death from a [[heart attack]] in 1985. He was survived by his wife and two daughters.\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shemza, Anwar}}\n\n[[Category:Kashmiri writers]]\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:1985 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century English painters]]\n[[Category:English male painters]]\n[[Category:Urdu short story writers]]\n[[Category:Pakistani dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:People from Shimla]]\n[[Category:National College of Arts alumni]]\n[[Category:Pakistani emigrants to the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Naturalised citizens of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Pakistani people of Kashmiri descent]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Slade School of Art]]\n[[Category:English people of Kashmiri descent]]\n[[Category:Urdu writers from Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language novelists]]\n[[Category:Pakistani calligraphers]]\n[[Category:Pakistani Muslims]]\n[[Category:20th-century Pakistani painters]]\n[[Category:University of the Punjab alumni]]"

      "text": "<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kufic.JPG|thumb|250px|Harakat using red vowel dots to indicate the correct vocalisation of the [[rasm]], from an early Qur'an written in [[Kufic script]]. (Verse 202 of [[Surah]] [[Al-Baqara]]).]] -->\n{{Arabic alphabet}}\nThe [[Arabic script]] has numerous [[diacritic]]s, including '''i'jam''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|إِعْجَام}}}} - ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i‘jām}}'', consonant pointing and '''tashkil''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|تَشْكِيل}}}} - ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tashkīl}}'', supplementary diacritics. The latter include the '''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|حَرَكَات}}}} vowel marks - singular: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakah}}'' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|حَرَكَة}}}}.\n\nThe Arabic script is an impure [[abjad]], where short consonants and long vowels are represented by letters but short vowels and consonant length are not generally indicated in writing. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Tashkīl}}'' is optional to represent missing vowels and consonant length. Modern Arabic is always written with the ''i‘jām'' - consonant pointing, but only religious texts, children's books and works for learners are written with the full ''tashkīl'' - vowel guides and consonant length.\n\n== {{anchor|Tashkil}}Tashkil (marks used as phonetic guides) ==\nThe literal meaning of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tashkīl}}'' is 'forming'. As the normal Arabic text does not provide enough information about the correct pronunciation, the main purpose of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tashkīl}}'' (and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'') is to provide a phonetic guide or a phonetic aid; i.e. show the correct pronunciation. It serves the same purpose as [[furigana]] (also called \"ruby\") in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] or [[pinyin]] or [[zhuyin]] in [[Mandarin Chinese]] for children who are learning to read or foreign learners.\n\nThe bulk of Arabic script is written without ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' (or short vowels). However, they are commonly used in texts that demand strict adherence to exact wording. This is true, primarily, of the [[Qur'an]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|الْقُرْآن}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Qur’ān}}'') and [[w:Arabic poetry|poetry]]. It is also quite common to add ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' to [[hadith]]s {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|الْحَدِيث}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-ḥadīth}}''; plural: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aḥādīth}}'') and the [[w:Bible translations into Arabic|Bible]]. Another use is in children's literature. Moreover, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' are used in ordinary texts in individual words when an ambiguity of pronunciation cannot easily be resolved from context alone. Arabic dictionaries with vowel marks provide information about the correct pronunciation to both native and foreign Arabic speakers. In art and [[calligraphy]], ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' might be used simply because their writing is considered [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.\n\nAn example of a fully ''vocalised'' (''vowelised'' or ''vowelled'') Arabic from the ''[[Basmala]]'':\n\n{{Quote|{{lang|ar| بِسْمِ ٱللهِ ٱلرَّحْمٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ }}<br/>''{{transl|ar|ALA|Bismi Llāhi r-Raḥmāni r-Raḥīmi}}''<br/>In the Name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful...}}\n\nSome Arabic textbooks for foreigners now use ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' as a phonetic guide to make learning reading Arabic easier. The other method used in textbooks is phonetic [[Romanization of Arabic|romanisation]] of unvocalised texts. Fully vocalised Arabic texts (i.e. Arabic texts with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}''/diacritics) are sought after by learners of Arabic. Some online bilingual dictionaries also provide ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' as a phonetic guide similarly to English dictionaries providing transcription.\n\n===Harakat (short vowel marks) {{anchor|ḥarakāt|harakat}} ===\nThe ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'', which literally means 'motions', are the short vowel marks. There is some ambiguity as to which ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tashkīl}}'' are also ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}''; the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tanwīn}}'', for example, are markers for both vowels and consonants.\n\n====Fatḥah====\n{{Redirect|Fatha|the jazz pianist|Earl Hines}}\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـَ}}</div>\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|فَتْحَة}}}} is a small diagonal line placed ''above'' a letter, and represents a short {{IPA|/a/}} (like the initial sound in English word \"up\"). The word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'' itself ({{lang|ar|فَتْحَة}}) means ''opening'' and refers to the opening of the mouth when producing an {{IPA|/a/}}. For example, with ''[[Dalet|{{transl|ar|ALA|dāl}}]]'' (henceforth, the base consonant in the following examples): {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دَ}}}} {{IPA|/da/}}.\n\nWhen a  '''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}''' is placed before a plain letter {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ا}}}} (''[[Aleph|{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]]'') (i.e. one having no hamza or vowel of its own), it represents a long {{IPA|/aː/}} (as in the English word \"father\"). For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دَا}}}} {{IPA|/daː/}}. The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'' is not usually written in such cases. When a fathah placed before the letter ⟨{{lang|ar|ﻱ}}⟩ (yā’), it creates an {{IPA|/aj/}} (as in \"l'''ie'''\"); and when placed before the letter ⟨{{lang|ar|و}}⟩ (wāw), it creates an {{IPA|/aw/}} (as in \"c'''ow'''\")\n{{clear}}\n\n====Kasrah====\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـِ}}</div>\n\nA similar diagonal line ''below'' a letter is called a '''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|كَسْرَة}}}} and designates a short {{IPA|/i/}} (as in \"Tim\") and its allophones [i, ɪ, e, e̞, ɛ]. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دِ}}}} {{IPA|/di/}}.<ref name=\"uvic.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/hist455/vowels/vowels_pres.htm|title=Introduction to Written Arabic|website=University of Victoria, Canada}}</ref>\n\nWhen a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' is placed before a plain letter {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ﻱ}}}} (''[[ي|{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}]]''), it represents a long {{IPA|/iː/}} (as in the English word \"steed\"). For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دِي}}}} {{IPA|/diː/}}. The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' is usually not written in such cases, but if ''[[ي|{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}]]'' is pronounced as a diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'' should be written on the preceding consonant to avoid mispronunciation. The word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' means 'breaking'.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Ḍammah====\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـُ}}</div>\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ضَمَّة}}}} is a small curl-like diacritic placed above a letter to represent a short /u/ (as in \"put\") and its allophones [u, ʊ, o, o̞, ɔ]. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دُ}}}} {{IPA|/du/}}.<ref name=\"uvic.ca\" />\n\nWhen a '''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}''' is placed before a plain letter {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|و}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[wāw]]}}''), it represents a long {{IPA|/uː/}} (like the 'oo' sound in the English word \"swoop\"). For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دُو}}}} {{IPA|/duː/}}. The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}'' is usually not written in such cases, but if ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'' is pronounced as a diphthong {{IPA|/aw/}}, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'' should be written on the preceding consonant to avoid mispronunciation.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Alif Khanjariyah====\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ــٰ}}</div>\n\nThe [[Dagger alif|'''superscript (or dagger) ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''''']] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|أَلِف خَنْجَرِيَّة}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif khanjarīyah}}''), is written as short vertical stroke on top of a consonant. It indicates a long {{IPA|/aː/}} sound for which ''[[Aleph#Arabic|{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]]'' is normally not written. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|هَٰذَا}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|hādhā}}'') or {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|رَحْمَٰن}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|raḥmān}}'').\n\nThe dagger ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' occurs in only a few words, but they include some common ones; it is seldom written, however, even in fully vocalised texts. Most keyboards do not have dagger ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}.'' The word [[Allah]] {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|الله}}}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|''Allāh''}}) is usually produced automatically by entering ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif lām lām hāʾ}}.'' The word consists of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' + ligature of doubled ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lām}}'' with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'' and a dagger ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' above ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lām}}''.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Maddah===\n{{distinguish|Maddah (religious singer)|Maddahi}}\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـٓ}}</div>\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|مَدَّة}}}} is a [[tilde]]-shaped diacritic, which can appear mostly on top of an ''[[Aleph|{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]]'' and indicates a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} followed by a long {{IPA|/aː/}}.\n\nIn theory, the same sequence {{IPA|/ʔaː/}} could also be represented by two ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''s, as in *{{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|أَا}}}}, where a hamza above the first ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' represents the {{IPA|/ʔ/}} while the second ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' represents the {{IPA|/aː/}}.  However, consecutive ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''s are never used in the Arabic orthography. Instead, this sequence must always be written as a single ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}'' above it, the combination known as an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maddah}}''. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|قُرْآن}}}} {{IPA|/qurˈʔaːn/}}.\n\n===Alif waslah===\n{{main|Wasla (diacritic)}}\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ٱ}}</div>\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|waṣlah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|وَصْلَة}}}}, '''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif waṣlah}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|أَلِف وَصْلَة}}}} or '''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat waṣl}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|هَمْزَة وَصْل}}}} looks like a small letter ''[[Tsade#Arabic Ṣād|{{transl|ar|ALA|ṣād}}]]'' on top of an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ٱ}}}} (also indicated by an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ا}}}} without a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}''). It means that the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' is not pronounced when its word begins a sentence. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|بِٱسْمِ}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismi}}''), but {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ٱمْشُوا۟}}}} (''imshū'' not ''mshū''). This is because no Arab word can start with a vowel-less consonant (unlike the English ''school'', or ''skateboard''). But when it happens, an ''alif'' is added to obtain a vowel or a vowelled consonant at the beginning of one's speech. In English that would result in ''iskool'', or ''iskateboard''.\n\nIt occurs only in the beginning of words, but it can occur after prepositions and the definite article. It is commonly found in imperative verbs, the perfective aspect of verb stems VII to X and their [[Arabic_verbs#Masdar|verbal nouns]] (''{{transl|ar|ALA|maṣdar}}''). The ''alif'' of the definite article is considered a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|waṣlah}}''.\n{{clear}}\nIt occurs in phrases and sentences (connected speech, not isolated/dictionary forms):\n* To replace the elided hamza whose alif-seat has assimilated to the previous vowel. For example: {{lang|ar|فِي ٱلْيَمَن}} or {{lang|ar|في اليمن}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|fi l-Yaman}}'') ‘in Yemen’.\n* In hamza-initial imperative forms following a vowel, especially following the conjunction {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|و}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wa-}}'') ‘and’. For example: َ{{lang|ar|قُمْ وَٱشْرَبِ ٱلْمَاءَ}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|qum wa-shrab-i l-mā’}}'') ‘rise and then drink the water’.\n\n===Sukun===\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـْـ}}</div>\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|sukūn}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|سُكُون}}}} is a circle-shaped diacritic placed above a letter. It indicates that the consonant to which it is attached is not followed by a vowel.\n\nIt is a necessary symbol for writing consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, which are very common in Arabic. For example: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|دَدْ}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|dad}}'').\n\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|sukūn}}''' may also be used to help represent a diphthong. A ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'' followed by the letter {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ﻱ}}}} (''[[yodh|{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}]]'') with a {{transl|ar|ALA|sukūn}} over it ({{rtl-lang|ar|ـَيْ}}) indicates the diphthong ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ay}}'' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] {{IPA|/aj/}}). A ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'', followed by the letter {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ﻭ}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[wāw]]}}'') with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sukūn}}'', ({{rtl-lang|ar|ـَوْ}}) indicates {{IPA|/aw/}}.\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـۡـ}}</div>\nThe '''{{transl|ar|ALA|sukūn}}''' may have also an alternative form of the small high dotless head of [[Ḫāʾ|''{{transl|ar|ALA|khāʾ}}'']] ({{unichar|06E1}}), particularly in some Qurans. Other shapes may exist as well (for example, like a small comma above ⟨ʼ⟩ or like a [[circumflex]] ⟨ˆ⟩ in [[Nastaʿlīq script|''{{transl|ar|ALA|nastaʿlīq}}'']]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://r12a.github.io/scripts/arabic/block#char0652|title=Arabic character notes|website=r12a}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== {{anchor|Tanwin}}Tanwin (final postnasalized or long vowels) ===\n{{main|Nunation}}\n<div style=\"float:left;margin:0;margin-right:1em;border:1px solid #eee;padding:0.3em;font-size:180%;line-height:1.5;\">{{lang|ar|ـٌ}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{lang|ar|ـٍ}}&nbsp;&nbsp;{{lang|ar|ـً}}</div>\n\nThe three vowel diacritics may be doubled at the end of a word to indicate that the vowel is followed by the consonant ''n''. They may or may not be considered {{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}} and are known as '''{{transl|ar|ALA|tanwīn}}''' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|تَنْوِين}}}}, or nunation. The signs indicate, from right to left, {{transl|ar|ALA|''-un, -in, -an}}''.\n\nThese endings are used as non-pausal grammatical indefinite case endings in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] or [[classical Arabic]] ([[ʾIʿrab#Fully declined nouns (triptote مُنْصَرِف munṣarif)|triptotes]] only). In a vocalised text, they may be written even if they are not pronounced (see [[pausa]]). See ''[[ʾIʿrab|{{transl|ar|ALA|i‘rāb]]}}'' for more details. In many spoken Arabic dialects, the endings are absent. Many Arabic textbooks introduce standard Arabic without these endings. The grammatical endings may not be written in some vocalized Arabic texts, as knowledge of ''[[ʾIʿrab|{{transl|ar|ALA|i‘rāb}}]]'' varies from country to country, and there is a trend towards simplifying Arabic grammar.\n\nThe sign {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ـً}}}} is most commonly written in combination with {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ـًا}}}} (''[[aleph|{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]]''), {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ةً}}}} (''[[Ta' marbuta|{{transl|ar|ALA|tā’ marbūṭah}}]]''), {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|أً}}}} (alif hamzah) or stand-alone {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ءً}}}} (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[hamza]]h}}''). ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Alif}}'' should always be written (except for words ending in ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tā’ marbūṭah, hamzah}}'' or diptotes) even if ''{{transl|ar|ALA|an}}'' is not.

Typically ''i‘jām'' are not considered diacritics but part of the letter.\n\nEarly manuscripts of the ''[[Qur'an|{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur’ān}}]]'' did not use diacritics either for vowels or to distinguish the different values of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|rasm}}.'' Vowel pointing was introduced first, as a red dot placed above, below, or beside the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|rasm}}'', and later consonant pointing was introduced, as thin, short black single or multiple dashes placed above or below the ''rasm'' ([[#History|image]]). These ''i‘jām'' became black dots about the same time as the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' became small black letters or strokes.\n\nTypically, Egyptians do not use dots under final ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ي}}}}, which looks exactly like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' {{angle bracket|{{lang|ar|ى}}}} in handwriting and in print.

The [[w:Basmala|Basmala]] was taken as an example, from [[w:Kufic|kufic]] ''[[w:Qur’an|{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur’ān}}]]'' manuscripts.<br />\n(1) Early 9th century, script with no dots or diacritic marks (see [[:Image:Basmala kufi.svg|image of early Basmala Kufic]]);<br />\n(2) and (3) 9th–10th century under Abbasid dynasty, Abu al-Aswad's system established red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel; later, a second black-dot system was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fā’}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qāf}}'' (see [[:Image:Kufi.jpg|image of middle Kufic]]);<br />\n(4) 11th century, in al-Farāhídi's system (system we know today) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels (see [[:Image:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|image of modern Kufic in Qur'an]]).\n]]\n\nAccording to tradition, the first to commission a system of ''harakat'' was [[Ali]] who appointed [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] for the task. Abu al-Aswad devised a system of dots to signal the three short vowels (along with their respective allophones) of Arabic. This system of dots predates the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i‘jām}}'', dots used to distinguish between different consonants.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Basmala kufi.svg|Early Basmala Kufic\nImage:Kufi.jpg|Middle Kufic\nImage:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|Modern Kufic in Qur'an\n</gallery>\n\n===Abu al-Aswad's system===\nAbu al-Aswad's system of Harakat was different from the system we know today. The system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel.\n\nA dot above a letter indicated the vowel ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', a dot below indicated the vowel ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'', a dot on the side of a letter stood for the vowel ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', and two dots stood for the ''[[tanwin|{{transl|ar|ALA|tanwīn}}]]''.\n\nHowever, the early manuscripts of the Qur'an did not use the vowel signs for every letter requiring them, but only for letters where they were necessary for a correct reading.\n\n===Al Farahidi's system===\nThis is the precursor to the system we know today. ''[[Al Farāhídi|{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Farāhīdī}}]]'' found that the task of writing using two different colours was tedious and impractical. Another complication was that the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i‘jām}}'' had been introduced by then, which, while they were short strokes rather than the round dots seen today, meant that without a color distinction the two could become confused.\n\nAccordingly, he replaced the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}'' with small superscript letters: small alif, yā’, and wāw for the short vowels corresponding to the long vowels written with those letters, a small ''s(h)īn'' for ''shaddah'' (geminate), a small ''khā’'' for ''khafīf'' (short consonant; no longer used).

Hamza is not one of the 28 \"full\" letters and owes its existence to historical inconsistencies in the [[orthography|standard writing system]]. It is derived from the Arabic letter ''[[Ayin|ʿAyn]]''. In the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] alphabets, from which the Arabic alphabet is descended, the glottal stop was expressed by ''[[aleph|alif]]'' ([[File:Phoenician aleph.svg|15px]]), continued by ''Alif'' (&nbsp;[[File:Alif-individua-cropt.svg|2px]]&nbsp;) in the Arabic alphabet. However, Alif was used to express both a glottal stop and also a long vowel {{IPA|/aː/}}. In order to indicate that a glottal stop is used, and not a mere vowel, it was added to Alif [[diacritic]]ally. In modern orthography,  hamza may also appear on the line, under certain circumstances as though it were a full letter, independent of an Alif. In [[Unicode]] it is at the code point U+0621 and named {{sc|ARABIC LETTER HAMZA}}.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Hamza'' is derived from the verb ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamaza}}'' ({{lang-ar|هَمَزَ}}) meaning ‘to prick, goad, drive’ or ‘to provide (a letter or word) with hamzah’.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wehr|first= Hans|editor-last= Cowan|editor-first= J.

Although it can be written as [[aleph|Alif]] carrying a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[wasla|Waṣlah]]}}'' sign {{lang|ar|ٱ}} (notably in the [[Quran]]), it is normally indicated by a plain Alif without a Hamza.\n\nIt occurs in:\n\n* the definite article ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[al-]]}}''\n* some short words with two-consonant roots like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ism, ibn, ibna, imr, imra, ithnāni, ithnatāni}}''\n* the imperative verbs of forms I and VII to X\n* the perfective aspect of verb forms VII to X and their verbal nouns\n* some borrowed words that start with consonant clusters such as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|istūdiyū}}''\n\nIt is not pronounced following a vowel: (''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-baytu l-kabīru}}'' for written {{lang|ar|البيت الكبير}}).

The following addresses Arabic specifically.\n\n=== Summary ===\n* '''Initial hamza''' is always placed over (أ for {{transl|ar|ALA|ʾa-}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|ʾu-}}) or under (إ for {{transl|ar|ALA|ʾi-}}) an alif.\n* '''Medial hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Surrounding vowels determine the seat of the hamza with preceding long vowels and diphthongs (such as {{transl|ar|ALA|aw}} or {{transl|ar|ALA|ay}}) being ignored.\n** ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i-}}'' (ئ) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u-}}'' (ؤ) over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a-}}'' (أ) if there are two conflicting vowels that count; on the line (ء) if there are none.\n** As a special case, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā’a, ū’a}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|aw’a}}'' require hamza on the line, instead of over an alif as one would expect. (See III.1b below.)\n* '''Final hamza''' will have a seat or be written alone:\n** Alone on the line when preceded by a long vowel or final consonant.\n** Has a seat matching the final short vowel for words ending in a short vowel.\n* ''Two adjacent alifs are never allowed.'' If the rules call for this, replace the combination by a single [[Aleph#Alif maddah: آ|alif maddah]].\n\n=== Detailed description ===\n*Logically, hamza is just like any other letter, but it may be written in different ways.  It has no effect on the way other letters are written.  In particular, surrounding long vowels are written just as they always are, regardless of the \"seat\" of the hamza—even if this results in the appearance of two consecutive wāws or yā’s.\n*Hamza can be written in five ways: on its own (\"on the line\"), under an alif, or over an alif, wāw, or yā’, called the \"seat\" of the hamza. When written over yā’, the dots that would normally be written underneath are omitted.\n*When according to the rules below, a hamza with an alif seat would occur before an alif which represents the vowel ''ā'', a single alif is instead written with the maddah symbol over it.\n*The rules for hamza depend on whether it occurs as the initial, middle, or final letter (not sound) in a word. (Thus, final short inflectional vowels do not count, but ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-an}}'' is written as alif + [[nunation]], counts, and the hamza is considered medial.)\n\nI. If the hamza is initial:\n\n*If the following letter is a short vowel, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics|fatḥah]]}}'' (a) (as in {{lang|ar|أفراد}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|afrād}}'') or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}'' (u) (as in {{lang|ar|أصول}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|uṣūl}}''), the hamza is written over a place-holding alif; ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'' (i) (as in {{lang|ar|إسلام}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|islām}}'') the hamza is written under a place-holding alif and is called \"hamza on a wall.\"\n*If the letter following the hamza is an alif itself: (as in {{lang|ar|آكل}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ākul}}'') alif maddah will occur.\n\nII. If the hamza is final:\n\n*If a short vowel precedes, the hamza is written over the letter (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, wāw,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'') corresponding to the short vowel.\n*Otherwise, the hamza is written on the line (as in {{lang|ar|شيء}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shay’&nbsp;}}'' \"thing\").\n\nIII. If the hamza is medial:\n\n*If a long vowel or diphthong precedes, the seat of the hamza is determined mostly by what follows:\n:*If ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' follows, the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' or {{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}, accordingly.\n:*Otherwise, the hamza would be written on the line. If a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' precedes, however, that would conflict with the stroke joining the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' to the following letter, so the hamza is written over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}.'' (as in {{lang|ar|جئت}})\n*Otherwise, both preceding and following vowels have an effect on the hamza.\n:*If there is only one vowel (or two of the same kind), that vowel determines the seat (''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif, wāw,}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'').\n:*If there are two conflicting vowels, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' takes precedence over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' so ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mi’ah}}'' 'hundred' is written {{lang|ar|مئة}}, with hamza over the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}.''\n:*''Alif-maddah'' occurs if appropriate.\n\nNot surprisingly, the complexity of the rules causes some disagreement.\n*Barron’s ''201 Arabic Verbs'' follows the rules exactly (but the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū’ū}}'' does not occur; see below).\n*John Mace’s ''Teach Yourself Arabic Verbs and Essential Grammar'' presents alternative forms in almost all cases when hamza is followed by a long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū}}''. The motivation appears to be to avoid two ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}''s in a row. Generally, the choice is between the form following the rules here or an alternative form using hamza over yā’ in all cases. Example forms are ''{{transl|ar|ALA|mas’ūl, yajī’ūna, yashā’ūna}}''.  Exceptions:\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū’ū}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|yasū’ūna}}''), the alternatives are hamza on the line, or hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}},'' when the rules here would call for hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}''. Perhaps, the resulting sequence of three wāws would be especially repugnant.\n:*In the sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra’ūna}}'', the alternative form has hamza over alif, not ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}.''\n:*The forms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yabṭu’ūna, ya’ūbu}}'' have no alternative form. (Note ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra’ūna}}'' with the same sequence of vowels.)\n*Haywood and Nahmad’s ''A new Arabic Grammar of the Written Language'' does not write the paradigms out in full, but in general agrees with John Mace’s book, including the alternative forms and sometimes lists a third alternative with the entire sequence ''{{transl|ar|ALA|’ū}}'' written as a single hamza over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'' instead of as two letters.\n* ''Al-Kitaab fii Taʿallum...'' presents paradigms with hamza written the same way throughout, regardless of the rules above. Thus ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yabda’ūna}}'' with hamza only over alif, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yajī’ūna}}'' with hamza only over ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}},'' ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yaqra’īna}}'' with hamza only over alif, but that is not allowed in any of the previous three books. (It appears to be an overgeneralization on the part of the ''al-Kitaab'' writers.)\n\n===Overview tables===\n\nThe letter {{rtl-lang|ar| ط }} (''ṭ'') stands here for any consonant.\n:'''Note''': The table shows only potential combinations and their graphic representations according to the spelling rules; not every possible combination exists in Arabic.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:white;text-align:center;\"\n|+ Intervocalic\n\n!rowspan=\"2\"| first||colspan=\"6\"|second\n|-\n!

In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by vowels, it indicates a [[diphthong]] between the two vowels. In the middle position, if hamza is surrounded by only one vowel, it takes the sound of that vowel. In the final position hamza is silent or produces a glottal sound, as in Arabic.\n\nIn Urdu, hamza usually represents a diphthong between two vowels. It rarely acts like the Arabic hamza except in a few loanwords from Arabic.\n\nHamza is also added at the last letter of the first word of [[ezāfe]] compound to represent -e- if the first word ends with [[Yodh|yeh]] or with [[He (letter)|he]] or over [[Yodh|bari yeh]] if it is added at the end of the first word of the ezāfe compound.\n\nHamza is always written on the line in the middle position unless in [[Waw (letter)|waw]] if that letter is preceded by a non-joiner letter; then, it is seated above waw. Hamza is also seated when written above bari yeh. In the final form, Hamza is written in its full form. In ezāfe, hamza is seated above he, yeh or bari yeh of the first word to represent the -e- of ezāfe compound.\n\n== Latin representations ==\nThere are different ways to represent hamza in Latin transliteration:\n\n* In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA), the sound of the [[glottal stop]] is represented by the letter [[Glottal stop (letter)|ʔ]], resembling a dotless question mark.\n* There is a tradition of using <big>'</big>, the simple apostrophe; and a [[`|grave accent]] ‹<big>`</big>› represents `ayn ({{lang|ar|[[ع]]}}).\n* Some [[Arabic transliteration|standard transliterations]], such as [[DIN 31635]], transliterate it with a [[modifier letter right half ring]] <span title=\"Modifier letter right half ring\" style=\"font-size: 170%;\">ʾ</span> and others such as [[ALA-LC]] with the [[modifier letter apostrophe]] <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">ʼ</span> and sometimes substituted with the Right Single Quotation Mark <span title=\"Modifier letter apostrophe\" style=\"font-size: 160%;\">’</span>.\n* Different unstandardized symbols exist such as ''[[2 (number)|2]]'' in [[Arabic chat alphabet]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ʼ]] and [[ʾ]]\n* [[Aleph]]\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Glottal stop (letter)]]\n* [[Harakat]]\n* [[Romanization of Arabic]]\n* [[Arabic phonology]]\n* [[Varieties of Arabic]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Arabic]]\n* [[ʻOkina]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.salaamarabic.com/lesson/plan/1494/glottal_stop Interactive lesson for learning hamza]\n\n{{commons category}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Arabic diacritics]]\n[[Category:Spelling]]\n[[Category:Graphemes]]"

It is functionally equivalent to writing a consonant twice in the orthographies of languages like [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], and [[Ancient Greek]], and is thus rendered in Latin script in most schemes of [[Arabic transliteration]], e.g. {{lang|ar|رُمّان}} = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|rummān}}'' '[[pomegranates]]'.\n\n==Form==\n\nIn shape, it is a small letter {{lang|ar|س}} ''[[shin (letter)#Arabic šīn/sīn|s(h)in]]'', standing for ''shaddah''.

A consonant may be long because of the form of the noun or verb; e.g., the causative form of the verb requires the 2nd consonant of the root to be long, as in ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|darrasa}}'' above, or by assimilation of consonants, for example the ''{{Transl|ar|l-}}'' of the [[Al-|Arabic definite article]] ''al-'' assimilates to all dental consonants, e.g. ({{lang|ar|الصّبي}}) ''{{Transl|ar|(a)ṣ-ṣabiyy}}'' instead of ''{{Transl|ar|(a)l-ṣabiyy}}'', or through [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], the switching of sounds, for example {{Lang|ar|أَقَلّ}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|aqall}}'' 'less, fewer' (instead of *{{Lang|ar|أَقْلَل}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|aqlal}}''), as compared to {{Lang|ar|أَكْبَر}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|akbar}}'' 'greater'.\n\nA syllable closed by a long consonant is made a long syllable. This affects both stress and prosody. Stress falls on the first long syllable from the end of the word, hence {{Lang|ar|أَقَلّ}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|aqáll}}'' (or, with [[i`rab|{{transl|ar|ALA|iʻrāb}}]]: ''{{Transl|ar|aqállu}}'') as opposed to {{Lang|ar|أَكْبَر}} ''{{Transl|ar|ákbar}}'',  {{Lang|ar|مَحَبّة}} {{Transl|ar|''maḥábbah''}} 'love, [[agape]]' as opposed to {{Lang|ar|مَعْرِفة}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|maʻrifah}}'' '(experiential) knowledge'. In Arabic [[Verse (poetry)|verse]], when scanning the meter, a syllable closed by a long consonant is counted as long, just like any other syllable closed by a consonant or a syllable ending in a long vowel: {{Lang|ar|أَلا تَمْدَحَنَّ}} ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|a-lā tamdaḥanna}}'' 'Will you not indeed praise...?' is scanned as ''{{Transl|ar|a-lā tam-da-ḥan-na}}'': short, long, long, short, long, short.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arabic diacritics]]\n* [[Arabic alphabet]]\n* [[Dagesh#Dagesh_hazak|Dagesh ḥazak]], a functionally similar diacritic used to indicate gemination in [[Biblical Hebrew]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Arabic diacritics]]\n\n\n{{arabic-script-stub}}"

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe '''frequency of letters''' in text has often been studied for use in [[cryptanalysis]], and [[frequency analysis]] in particular.\n\nNo language has an exact letter frequency distribution, as all writers write slightly differently. As a rule texts in different languages using the [[Arabic script]] (e.g. [[Arabic]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]) will have different letter frequencies, most obviously in the case of letters which are only used in some languages (e.g. the Persian letters پ, چ, گ, which are not used to write in Arabic).\n\nMethods encoding the most frequent letters with the shortest symbols were pioneered by telegraph codes, and are used in modern data-compression techniques such as [[Huffman coding]].\n\n== What gets counted in input Arabic text? ==\n\nThe Arabic alphabet consists of 28 primary letters, these are letters 1 to 28 in Table 1. The eight modified letters listed in positions 29 to 36 in the same table are used just the same{{what|date=August 2016}}. If these 8 modified forms are folded into the primary list based on shape or phonetic similarity, the outcome then is as shown in Table 2. For accurate frequency analysis, each of the 36 letters of Table 1 gets its frequency counted independently.\n\nThe ordering of the alphabet shown in the tables is more logical{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} than is used by the [[Unicode]] standard.\n\n[[File:IntellarkChars.png|thumb|Figure 1: Arabic characters that can be produced using the [[Arabic Letter Keyboard Intellark]].]]\n[[File:ArabicLetters-36.png|thumb|Table 1: The Arabic alphabet. Letters 1 to 28 are the primary letters. Letters 29 to 36 are the modified letters.]] \n[[File:ArabicLetters-28.png|thumb|Table 2: The Arabic alphabet, with modified letters lumped onto their primary forms.]]\n\nAlthough the full set of Arabic characters includes about ten diacritics as shown in the Figure 1, frequency analysis of Arabic characters is only concerned with computing the frequency of alphabet letters shown in Table 2.\n\n== Sources with over five million letters ==\n\nThe following famous Arabic sources are used to generate an acceptable amount of data on which frequency statistics are conducted.\n\n* The first seven volumes of the series البداية والنهاية (''The Beginning and The End'')<ref>\n  {{ Cite book\n    | last= Ibn Kathir\n    | first= Ismail\n    | title= The beginning and the End (in Arabic)\n    | year= 1???\n    | url= http://www.al-eman.com/library/book/book-view.htm?id=111#s3\n    | accessdate= 23 January 2011\n  }}\n  </ref> of [[Ibn Kathir]], with 2,855 pages, containing 1,096,047 words, containing 4,326,031 letters.\n* The book of الرحيق المختوم (''[[The Sealed Nectar]]'')<ref>\n  {{ Cite book\n   | last= Almubarakfuri\n   | first= Safiyyurrahman\n   | title= The Sealed Nectar\n   | year= 19??\n   | url= http://www.al-eman.com/library/book/book-view.htm?id=91\n   | accessdate= 24 January 2011\n  }}\n  </ref> of Almubarakfuri, with 284 pages, containing 134,662 words, containing 553,740 letters.\n* The book of تحفة العروسين (''The Masterpiece of the Brides'')<ref>\n  {{ Cite book\n   | last= Ash-shuri\n   | first= Majdi\n   | title= Masterpiece of the Bride\n   | url= http://saaid.net/book/open.php?cat= 82&book= 1763\n   | year= 19??\n   | accessdate= 24 January 2011\n  }}\n  </ref> of Al-shuri, with 239 pages, containing 66,550 words, containing 242,361 letters.\nCollectively, these sources add up to 3,378 pages, with 1,297,259 words, and 5,122,132 letters.\n\nThe following graphs show the letter frequency distribution for the counted letters; Figure 2 shows a histogram data sorted on [[Unicode]] value.
