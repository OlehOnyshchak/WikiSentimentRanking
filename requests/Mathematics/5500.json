      "text": "[[File:Ellipso-KSE0.svg|thumb|tri-axial ellipsoid with a circular section]]\nIn geometry a '''circular section''' is a [[circle]] on a [[quadric]] surface (such as an [[ellipsoid]] or [[hyperboloid]]). It is a special [[plane (geometry)|plane]] section of the quadric, as this circle is the intersection with the quadric of the plane containing the circle.\n\nAny plane section of a sphere is a circular section, if it contains at least 2 points. Any [[surface of revolution|quadric of revolution]] contains circles as sections with planes that are orthogonal to its axis; it does not contain any other circles, if it is not a sphere. More hidden are circles on other quadrics, such as tri-axial ellipsoids, elliptic cylinders, etc. Nevertheless, it is true that:\n*Any quadric surface which contains ellipses contains circles, too.\nEquivalently, all quadric surfaces contain circles except parabolic and hyperbolic [[cylinder]]s and hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]s.\n\nIf a quadric contains a circle, then every intersection of the quadric with a plane parallel  to this circle is also a circle, provided it contains at least two points. Except for spheres, the circles contained in a quadric, if any, are all parallel to one of two fixed planes (which are equal in the case of a quadric of revolution).\n\nCircular sections are used in [[crystallography]].<ref>W.

Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1950, {{ISBN|978-3-642-52-993-1}}, p.&nbsp;355.</ref>\n\n==Using projective geometry==\nThe circular sections  of a quadric may be computed from the [[implicit equation]] of the quadric, as it is done in the following sections. They may also be characterised and studied by using [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] [[projective geometry]].\n\nLet {{math|''C''}} be the intersection of a quadric surface {{math|''Q''}} and a plane {{math|''P''}}. In this section, {{math|''Q''}} and {{math|''C''}} are surfaces in the three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], which are extended to the [[projective space]] over the [[complex number]]s. Under these hypotheses, the curve {{math|''C''}} is a circle if and only if its intersection with the [[plane at infinity]] is included in the [[Glossary of classical algebraic geometry#O|ombilic]] (the curve at infinity of equation <math>x^2+y^2+z^2=0</math>).\n\nThe first case to be considered is when the intersection of {{math|''Q''}} with the plane at infinity consists of one or two real lines, that is when {{math|''Q''}} is either a [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], a [[parabolic cylinder]] or a [[cylinder#hyperbolic cylinder|hyperbolic cylinder]]. In this case the points at infinity of {{math|''C''}} are real (intersection of a real plane with real lines). Thus the plane sections of {{math|''Q''}} cannot be circles (neither [[ellipse]]s).\n\nIf {{math|''Q''}} is a [[sphere]], its intersection with the plane at infinity is the ombilic, and all plane sections are circles.\n\nIf {{math|''Q''}} is a [[surface of revolution]], its intersection with the ombilic consists of a pair of [[complex conjugate]] points (which are [[double point]]s). A real plane contains these two points if and only if it is perpendicular to the axis of revolution. Thus the circular sections are the plane sections by a plane perpendicular to the axis, that have at least two real points.\n\nIn the other cases, the intersection of {{math|''Q''}} with the ombilic consists of two different pairs of complex conjugate points. As {{math|''C''}} is a curve of degree two, its intersection with the plane at infinity consists of two points, possibly equal. The curve {{math|''C''}} is thus a circle, if these two points are one of these two pairs of complex conjugate points on the ombilic. Each of these pairs defines a real line (passing through the points), which is the intersection of {{math|''P''}} with the plane at infinity. Thus, one has a circular section if and only {{math|''C''}} has at least two real points and {{math|''P''}} contains one of these lines at infinity (that is if {{math|''P''}} is parallel to one of two directions defined by these lines at infinity).\n\n== Determination of circular sections of a quadric ==\nIn order to find the planes, which contain circular sections of a given quadric, one uses the following statements:\n:'''(S:)''' If the common points of a quadric with a ''sphere'' are contained in a pair of planes, then the intersection curve consists of two circles.\n:'''(P:)''' If the intersection  of a plane and a quadric is a circle, than any parallel plane, that contains at least two points of the quadric, intersects the quadic in a circle, too.\n\nHence the ''strategy'' for the detection of circular sections is: \n:1) Find a ''sphere'', which intersects the quadric in a pair of planes and \n:2) The ''planes'', which are parallel to the detected ones, deliver the remaining circular sections.\n\n== Tri-axial ellipsoid ==\n[[File:Ellipso-KSE.svg|400px|thumb|tri-axial ellipsoid with circular sections (blue and green) and the auxiliary sphere (red), which intersects the quadric in the blue circles]]\n[[File:Ellipsoid-KSE-4-5.svg|thumb|Ellipsoid intersected by spheres: <math>c<{\\color{seagreen}r_1}<{\\color{blue}b}<{\\color{purple}r_2}<a</math>]]\nFor the ellipsoid with equation \n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1</math>\nand the semi-axes  <math>a>b>c>0</math> one uses an auxiliary sphere with equation \n:<math>x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2\\ .</math>\nThe sphere's radius has to be chosen such that the intersection with the ellipsoid is contained in two planes through the origin.\nMultiplication of the ellipsoid's equation by <math>r^2</math> and subtracting the sphere's equation yields:\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{r^2}{a^2}-1\\right)\\;x^2+\\left(\\frac{r^2}{b^2}-1\\right)\\;y^2+\\left(\\frac{r^2}{c^2}-1\\right)\\;z^2=0\\ .</math>\nThis equation describes a pair of planes, if one of the 3 coefficients is zero. In case of  <math>\\ r=a\\ </math> or <math>\\ r=c\\ </math> the equation is only fulfilled by either the x-axis or the z-axis. Only in case of <math>\\ r=b\\ </math> one gets a pair of planes  with equation \n*<math>\\left(\\frac{b^2}{a^2}-1\\right)\\;x^2+\\left(\\frac{b^2}{c^2}-1\\right)\\;z^2=0\\ \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad z=\\pm \\tfrac{c}{a}\\sqrt{\\tfrac{a^2-b^2}{b^2-c^2}}\\; x \\ ,</math>\nbecause only in this case the remaining coefficients have different signs (due to: <math>a>b>c</math>).\n\nThe diagram gives an impression of more common intersections between a sphere and an ellipsoid and highlights the exceptional circular case (blue).\n\nIf the values of the semi-axes are approaching, the two pencils of planes (and circles) approach either. For <math>a=b</math> all the planes are orthogonal to the z-axis (rotation axis).\n\n'''Proof of property  (P):'''<br>\nTurning the ellipsoid around  the y-axis such that one of the two circles (blue) lies in the x-y-plane results in a new equation of the ellipsoid:\n:<math>Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+D{\\color{red}xz}=E</math>\nFor <math>z=0</math> one gets <math>Ax^2+By^2=E</math>, which has to be the equation of a circle. This is only true, if <math>A=B\\ne 0,\\ E>0</math>. \nThe intersection of the ellipsoid by a plane with equation <math>z=z_0</math>, (parallel to the x-y-plane) has the equation\n:<math>A(x^2+y^2)+Dz_0 x=E-Cz_0^2</math>.\nThis equation describes a ''circle'' or a point or the empty set. Center and radius of the circle can be found be [[completing the square]].\n\n== Elliptical hyperboloid of one sheet==\n[[File:Hyperboloid-1-KSE.svg|250px|thumb|hyperboloid of one sheet]]\nFor  the [[hyperboloid]] of one sheet with equation \n: <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1\\ , \\quad a>b\\ , c>0 </math>\nanalogously one gets for the intersection with the sphere <math>\\ x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2\\ </math> the equation\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{r^2}{a^2}-1\\right)\\;x^2+\\left(\\frac{r^2}{b^2}-1\\right)\\;y^2-\\left(\\frac{r^2}{c^2}+1\\right)\\;z^2=0\\ .</math>\nOnly for <math>\\ r=a\\ </math> one gets a pair of planes:\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{a^2}{b^2}-1\\right)\\;y^2-\\left(\\frac{a^2}{c^2}+1\\right)\\;z^2=0\\ \\quad\n\\leftrightarrow \\quad z=\\pm \\frac{c}{b}\\sqrt{\\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2+c^2}}\\; y \\ ,\\ </math>\n\n== Elliptical cylinder ==\n[[File:Zylinder-KSE.svg|250px|thumb|elliptical cylinder]]\nFor the elliptical [[cylinder]] with equation\n: <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1\\ , \\quad a>b\\ ,</math>\none gets the equation\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{r^2}{a^2}-1\\right)\\;x^2+\\left(\\frac{r^2}{b^2}-1\\right)\\;y^2-z^2=0\\ .</math>\nOnly for <math>\\ r=a\\ </math> one gets a pair of planes:\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{a^2}{b^2}-1\\right)\\;y^2-z^2=0\\ \\quad\n\\leftrightarrow \\quad z=\\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}{b}\\; y \\ .\\ </math>\n\n== Elliptical paraboloid ==\n[[File:Paraboloid-KSE.svg|250px|thumb|elliptical paraboloid]]\nFor the elliptical [[paraboloid]] with equation\n:<math>ax^2+by^2-z=0\\ , \\quad a{\\color{red}{<}}b\\ ,</math>\none chooses a sphere containing the vertex (origin) and with center on the axis (z-axis) :\n:<math>x^2+y^2+(z-r)^2=r^2 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad x^2+y^2+z^2-2rz=0 \\ . </math>\nAfter elimination of the linear parts one gets the equation\n:<math>(2ra-1)\\;x^2+(2rb-1)\\;y^2-z^2=0\\ .</math>\nOnly for <math>r=\\tfrac{1}{2a}</math> one gets a pair of planes :\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{b}{a}-1\\right)\\; y^2-z^2=0  \\quad\n\\leftrightarrow \\quad z=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{b-a}{a}}\\; y \\ .\\ </math>\n\n== Elliptical hyperboloid of two sheets==\n[[File:Hyperboloid-2s-KSE.svg|250px|thumb|elliptical hyperboloid of two sheets]]\nThe [[hyperboloid]] of two sheets with equation \n:<math>-\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} +\\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1 \\ ,\\quad a>b \\ , \\ c>0 \\ ,</math>\nis shifted at first such that one vertex is the origin (s. diagram):\n:<math>-\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} +\\frac{(z+c)^2}{c^2} = 1  \\quad\n\\leftrightarrow \\quad \\ -\\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} +\\frac{z^2}{c^2} +\\frac{2z}{c} = 0 \\ .</math>\nAnalogously to the paraboloid case one chooses a sphere containing the origin with center on the z-axis:\n:<math>x^2+y^2+(z-r)^2=r^2 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad x^2+y^2+z^2-2zr=0 \\ . </math>\nAfter elimination of the linear parts one gets the equation\n:<math>\\left(-\\frac{r}{a^2}+\\frac{1}{c}\\right)\\;x^2+\\left(-\\frac{r}{b^2}+\\frac{1}{c}\\right)\\;y^2 +\\left(\\frac{r}{c^2}+\\frac{1}{c}\\right)z^2=0\\ .</math>\nOnly for  <math>r=\\tfrac{a^2}{c}</math> one gets a pair of planes:\n:<math>\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{b^2c}+\\frac{1}{c}\\right)\\;y^2+\\left(\\frac{a^2}{c^3}+\\frac{1}{c}\\right)\\;z^2=0\\ \\quad\n\\leftrightarrow \\quad z=\\pm \\frac{c}{b}\\sqrt{\\frac{a^2-b^2}{a^2+c^2}}\\; y \\ . </math>\n\n== Elliptical cone ==\n[[File:Kegel-KSE.svg|250px|thumb|elliptical cone]]\nThe elliptical [[cone]] with equation \n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} -z^2= 0 \\ ,\\quad a>b \\ ,</math>\nis shifted such that the vertex is ''not'' the origin (s. diagram):\n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} -(z-1)^2= 0 \\quad \\leftrightarrow \\quad \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} -z^2+2z= 1.</math>\nNow a sphere with center at the origin is suitable:\n:<math>x^2+y^2+z^2=r^2 \\ . </math>\nEliminatiion of <math>x^2</math> yields:\n:<math>(\\frac{a^2}{b^2}-1)\\; y^2 -(1+a^2)\\; z^2+2a^2z=a^2-r^2 \\ .</math>\nIn this case completing the square gives:\n:<math>\\frac{a^2-b^2}{b^2}\\; y^2-(1+a^2)\\left(z-\\frac{a^2}{1+a^2}\\right)^2 = a^2-\\frac{a^4}{1+a^2}-r^2 \\ .</math>\nIn order to get the equation of a pair of planes, the right part of the equation has to be zero, which is true for <math>r=\\tfrac{a}{\\sqrt{1+a^2}}\\ .</math>\nThe solution for z gives:\n:<math>z=\\frac{a^2}{1+a^2}\\pm\\frac{1}{b}\\sqrt{\\frac{a^2-b^2}{1+a^2}}\\; y \\ .</math>\n\n== References ==\n*H.

      "text": "[[File:Ell-hyp-konfokal.svg|300px|thumb|Pencils of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas]]\nIn [[geometry]], two [[conic section]]s are called '''confocal''', if they have the same [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. Because [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]s possess two foci,  there are '''confocal ellipses''', '''confocal hyperbolas''' and confocal mixtures of ellipses and hyperbolas. In the mixture of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas, any ellipse intersects any hyperbola [[orthogonal]]ly (at right angles). Parabolas possess only one focus, so, by convention, '''confocal parabolas''' have the same focus ''and'' the same axis of symmetry. Consequently, any point not on the axis of symmetry lies on two confocal parabolas which intersect orthogonally (see [[#Confocal parabolas|below]]).\n\nThe formal extension of the concept of confocal conics to surfaces leads to '''confocal [[quadric]]s'''.\n\n== Confocal ellipses ==\nAn ellipse which is not a circle is uniquely determined by its foci <math>F_1,\\; F_2</math> and a point not on the major axis (see the [[Ellipse#Definition of an ellipse as locus of points|definition of an ellipse]] as a locus of points). The [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]] of confocal ellipses with the foci <math>F_1=(c,0),\\; F_2=(-c,0)</math> can be described by the equation\n* <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{a^2-c^2}=1 \\ , \\quad a>c \\ ,</math>\nwith semi-major axis <math>a</math> as parameter. (The [[linear eccentricity]] <math>c</math> is uniquely determined by the foci.)\nBecause a point of an ellipse uniquely determines the parameter <math>a</math>,\n* any two ellipses of the pencil have no points in common.\n\n== Confocal hyperbolas ==\nA hyperbola is uniquely determined by its foci <math>F_1,\\; F_2</math> and a point not on the axes of symmetry. The pencil of confocal hyperbolas with the foci <math>F_1=(c,0),\\; F_2=(-c,0)</math> can be described by the equation\n* <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{c^2-a^2}=1 \\ , \\quad 0<a<c \\ ,</math>\nwith the semi-axis <math>a</math> as parameter. (The linear eccentricity <math>c</math> is uniquely determined by the foci.)\nBecause a point of the hyperbola determines the parameter <math>a</math> uniquely,\n* any two hyperbolas of the pencil have no points in common.\n\n== Confocal ellipses and hyperbolas ==\nFrom the previous representations of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas one gets a common representation: The equation\n* <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{a^2-c^2}=1</math>\ndescribes an ''ellipse,'' if <math>c<a</math>, and a ''hyperbola,'' if  <math>0<a<c</math>.\n\nIn the literature one finds another common representation:\n* <math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2-\\lambda}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2-\\lambda}=1\\ ,</math>\n[[File:Ell-hyp-konf-bw.svg|thumb|Confocal ellipses and hyperbols intersect perpendicular: proof]]\nwith <math>a,b</math> the semi-axes of a given ellipse (hence the foci  <math>F_1,\\; F_2</math> are given) and <math>\\lambda</math> is the parameter of the pencil.<br />\nFor <math>\\lambda<b^2</math> one gets confocal ''ellipses'' (it is <math>a^2-\\lambda-(b^2-\\lambda)=c^2</math>) and <br />\nfor <math>b^2<\\lambda<a^2</math> confocal ''hyperbolas'' with the foci <math>F_1,\\; F_2</math> in common.\n\nConsidering the pencils of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas (see lead diagram) one gets from the geometrical properties of the normal and tangent at a point (the [[Ellipse#The Normal bisects the angle between the lines to the foci|normal of an ellipse]] and the [[Hyperbola#The tangent bisects the angle between the lines to the foci|tangent of a hyperbola]] bisect the angle between the lines to the foci) :\n* Any ellipse of the pencil intersects any hyperbola orthogonally (see diagram).\n\nHence, the plane can be covered by an orthogonal net of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas.\n\nThis orthogonal net can be used as the base of an [[elliptic coordinate system]].\n\n== Confocal parabolas ==\n[[File:Parab-konf-schar.svg|thumb|Pencil of confocal parabolas]]\nParabolas possess only one focus. A parabola can be considered as a limit curve of a pencil of confocal ellipses (hyperbolas), where one focus is kept fixed, while the second one is moved to infinity. If one performs this transformation for a net of confocal ellipses and hyperbolas, one gets a net of two pencils of confocal parabolas.\n\nThe equation <math>y^2=2p(x+p/2)=2px+p^2</math> describes a [[parabola#Parabola in a cartesian coordinate system|parabola]] with the origin as focus and the ''x''-axis as axis of symmetry.

It is a [[hypersurface]] (of dimension ''D'') in a {{nowrap|(''D'' + 1)}}-dimensional space, and it is defined as  the [[zero set]] of an [[irreducible polynomial]] of [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] two in ''D'' + 1 variables ({{nowrap|1=''D'' = 1}} in the case of conic sections). When the defining polynomial is not [[absolutely irreducible]], the zero set is generally not considered a quadric, although it is often called a ''degenerate quadric'' or a ''reducible quadric''.\n\nIn coordinates {{nowrap|''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''D''+1</sub>}}, the general quadric is thus defined by the [[algebraic equation]]<ref name=\"geom\">Silvio Levy [http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/reference/CRC-formulas/node61.html Quadrics] in \"Geometry Formulas and Facts\", excerpted from 30th Edition of ''CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulas'', [[CRC Press]], from [[The Geometry Center]] at [[University of Minnesota]]</ref> \n:<math>\n\\sum_{i,j=1}^{D+1} x_i Q_{ij} x_j + \\sum_{i=1}^{D+1} P_i  x_i + R = 0\n</math>\n\nwhich may be compactly written in vector and matrix notation as:\n\n:<math>\nx Q x^\\mathrm{T} + P x^\\mathrm{T} + R = 0\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|1=''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''D''+1</sub>)}} is a row [[vector (geometry)|vector]], ''x''<sup>T</sup> is the [[transpose]] of ''x'' (a column vector), ''Q'' is a {{nowrap|(''D'' + 1)&thinsp;×&thinsp;(''D'' + 1)}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and ''P'' is a {{nowrap|(''D'' + 1)}}-dimensional row vector and ''R'' a scalar constant.  The values ''Q'', ''P'' and ''R'' are often taken to be over [[real number]]s or [[complex number]]s, but a quadric may be defined over any [[field (mathematics)|field]].  \n\nA quadric is an [[affine algebraic variety]], or, if it is reducible, an [[affine algebraic set]]. Quadrics may also be defined in [[projective space]]s; see {{slink||Projective geometry}}, below.\n\n== Euclidean plane ==\n{{main|conic section}}\nQuadrics in the [[Euclidean plane]] are those of dimension ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, which is to say that they are [[plane curve]]s.

They are classified and named by their [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] under [[affine transformation]]s. More precisely, if an affine transformation maps a quadric onto another one, they belong to the same class, and share the same name and many properties.\n\nThe [[principal axis theorem]] shows that for any (possibly reducible) quadric, a suitable [[Euclidean transformation]] or a change of [[Cartesian coordinates]] allows putting the [[quadratic equation]] of the quadric into one of the following normal forms:\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} +\\varepsilon_1  {z^2 \\over c^2} + \\varepsilon_2=0,</math>\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} - {y^2 \\over b^2}  + \\varepsilon_3=0</math>\n:<math>{x^2 \\over a^2}  + \\varepsilon_4 =0,</math>\n:<math>z={x^2 \\over a^2} +\\varepsilon_5 {y^2 \\over b^2}, </math>\nwhere the <math>\\varepsilon_i</math> are either 1, –1 or 0, except <math> \\varepsilon_3 </math> which takes only the value 0 or 1. \n\nEach of these 17 normal forms<ref name=\"ela\">Stewart Venit and Wayne Bishop, ''Elementary Linear Algebra (fourth edition)'', International Thompson Publishing, 1996.</ref><ref>[http://inspirehep.net/author/S.A.Khan.5/ Sameen Ahmed Khan],[http://indapt.org/images/stories/bulletin2010/bulletin_november_2010.pdf Quadratic Surfaces in Science and Engineering], Bulletin of the IAPT, 2(11), 327–330 (November 2010).

In one case, the ''imaginary cone'', there is a single point (<math>\\varepsilon_1=1, \\varepsilon_2=0</math>).

The eight remaining quadrics are the imaginary ellipsoid (no real point), the imaginary cylinder (no real point), the imaginary cone (a single real point), and the reducible quadrics, which are decomposed in two planes; there are five such decomposed quadrics, depending whether the planes are distinct or not, parallel or not, real or complex conjugate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: white; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | Non-degenerate real quadric surfaces\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; [[Ellipsoid]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} + {z^2 \\over c^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Ellipsoid Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Elliptic [[paraboloid]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - z = 0 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Paraboloid Quadric.Png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Hyperbolic [[paraboloid]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} - {y^2 \\over b^2} - z = 0  \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Hyperbolic Paraboloid Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp;Elliptic [[hyperboloid]] of one sheet\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Hyperboloid Of One Sheet Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp;Elliptic [[hyperboloid]] of two sheets\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = - 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Hyperboloid Of Two Sheets Quadric.png|150px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: white; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | Degenerate real quadric surfaces\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Elliptic [[Conical surface|cone]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = 0 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Elliptical Cone Quadric.Png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Elliptic [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Elliptic Cylinder Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Hyperbolic [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} - {y^2 \\over b^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Hyperbolic Cylinder Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Parabolic [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]\n| <math>x^2 + 2ay = 0 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Parabolic Cylinder Quadric.png|150px]]\n|}\n\nWhen two or more of the parameters of the canonical equation are equal, one gets a quadric [[surface of revolution|of revolution]], which remains invariant when rotated around an axis (or infinitely many axes, in the case of the sphere). \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color: white; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | Quadrics of revolution\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Oblate and prolate [[spheroid]]s (special cases of ellipsoid)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} + {z^2 \\over b^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Oblate Spheroid Quadric.png|75px]][[Image:Prolate Spheroid Quadric.png|75px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; [[Sphere]] (special case of spheroid)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} + {z^2 \\over a^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Sphere Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Circular [[paraboloid]] (special case of elliptic paraboloid)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} - z = 0  \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Circular Paraboloid Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp;Circular [[hyperboloid]] of one sheet (special case of elliptic hyperboloid of one sheet)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} - {z^2 \\over b^2} = 1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Circular Hyperboloid Of One Sheet Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp;Circular [[hyperboloid]] of two sheets (special case of elliptic hyperboloid of two sheets)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} - {z^2 \\over b^2} = -1 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Circular Hyperboloid of Two Sheets Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Circular [[Conical surface|cone]] (special case of elliptic cone)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} - {z^2 \\over b^2} = 0 \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Circular Cone Quadric.png|150px]]\n|-\n| &nbsp; &nbsp; Circular [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] (special case of elliptic cylinder)\n| <math>{x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over a^2} = 1  \\,</math>\n|[[Image:Circular Cylinder Quadric.png|150px]]\n|}\n\n==Definition and basic properties==\nA quadric is the set of [[zero of a function|zeros]] of a polynomial of degree two. When not specified otherwise, the polynomial is supposed to have [[real number|real]] coefficients, and the zeros are points in a [[Euclidean space]]. However, most properties remain true when the coefficients belong to any [[field (mathematics)|field]] and the points belong in an [[affine space]]. As usually in [[algebraic geometry]], it is often useful to consider points over an [[algebraically closed field]] containing the polynomial coefficients, generally the [[complex number]]s, when the coefficients are real.\n\nThis define ''affine quadrics''. Many properties becomes easier to state (and to prove) by extending the quadric to the [[projective space]] by [[projective completion]] consisting of adding [[points at infinity]]. Technically, if \n:<math>p(x_1, \\ldots,x_n)</math> \nis a polynomial of degree two that defines an affine quadric, then its projective completion is defined by [[homogenization of a polynomial|homogenizing]] {{mvar|p}} into\n:<math>P(X_0, \\ldots, X_n)=X_0^2\\,p(\\frac {X_1}{X_0}, \\ldots,\\frac {X_n}{X_0})</math>\n(this is a polynomial, because the degree of {{mvar|p}} is two). The points of the projective completion are the points of the projective space whose [[projective coordinates]] are zeros of {{mvar|P}}.\n\n===Equation===\nA quadric in an [[affine space]] of dimension {{mvar|n}} is the set of zeros of a polynomial of degree 2, that is the set of the points whose coordinates satisfy an equation\n:<math>p(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=0,</math>\nwhere the polynomial {{mvar|p}} has the form\n:<math>p(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{i,i}x_i^2+\\sum_{1\\le i<j\\le n} (a_{i,j}+a_{j,i})x_ix_j +\\sum_{i=1}^n (a_{i,0}+a_{0,i})x_i +a_{0,0},</math>\nwhere <math>a_{i,j}=a_{j,i}</math> if the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of the coefficients is not two and <math>a_{j,i}=0</math> otherwise.\n\nIf {{mvar|A}} is the {{math|(''n'' + 1)×(''n'' + 1)}} matrix that has the <math>a_{i,j}</math> as entries, and\n:<math>\\mathbf x = \\begin {pmatrix}1&x_1&\\cdots&x_n\\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf T},</math>\nthen the equation may be shortened in the matrix equation\n:<math>\\mathbf x^{\\mathsf T}A\\mathbf x=0.</math>\nThe equation of the projective completion of this quadric is \n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^n a_{i,i}X_i^2+\\sum_{0\\le i<j\\le n} (a_{i,j}+a_{j,i})X_iX_j,</math>\nor \n:<math>\\mathbf X^{\\mathsf T}A\\mathbf X=0,</math>\nwith\n:<math>\\mathbf X = \\begin {pmatrix}X_0&X_1&\\cdots&X_n\\end{pmatrix}^{\\mathsf T}.</math>\n\nThese equations define a quartic as an [[hypersurface|algebraic hypersurface]] of ''dimension'' {{math|''n'' – 1}}  and degree  two in a space of dimension {{mvar|n}}.\n\n==Normal form of projective quadrics==\nThe quadrics can be treated in a uniform manner by introducing [[homogeneous coordinates]] on a Euclidean space, thus effectively regarding it as a [[projective space]].  Thus if the original (affine) coordinates on '''R'''<sup>''D''+1</sup> are \n:<math>(x_1,\\dots,x_{D+1})</math>\none introduces new coordinates on '''R'''<sup>''D''+2</sup>\n:<math>[X_0,\\dots,X_{D+1}]</math>\nrelated to the original coordinates by <math>x_i=X_i/X_0</math>.  In the new variables, every quadric is defined by an equation of the form\n:<math>Q(X)=\\sum_{ij} a_{ij}X_iX_j=0\\,</math>\nwhere the coefficients ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> are symmetric in ''i'' and ''j''.  Regarding ''Q''(''X'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 as an equation in [[projective space]] exhibits the quadric as a projective [[algebraic variety]].  The quadric is said to be '''non-degenerate''' if the quadratic form is non-singular; equivalently, if the [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] (''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>) is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].\n\nIn [[real projective space]], by [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], a non-singular [[quadratic form]] ''Q''(''X'') may be put into the normal form\n\n:<math>Q(X) = \\pm X_0^2 \\pm X_1^2 \\pm\\cdots\\pm X_{D+1}^2</math> \n\nby means of a suitable [[projective transformation]] (normal forms for singular quadrics can have zeros as well as ±1 as coefficients). For surfaces in space (dimension ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2) there are exactly three nondegenerate cases:\n\n:<math>Q(X) = \\begin{cases}\nX_0^2+X_1^2+X_2^2+X_3^2\\\\\nX_0^2+X_1^2+X_2^2-X_3^2\\\\\nX_0^2+X_1^2-X_2^2-X_3^2\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nThe first case is the empty set.\n\nThe second case generates the ellipsoid, the elliptic paraboloid or the hyperboloid of two sheets, depending on whether the chosen plane at infinity cuts the quadric in the empty set, in a point, or in a nondegenerate conic respectively. These all have positive [[Gaussian curvature]].\n\nThe third case generates the hyperbolic paraboloid or the hyperboloid of one sheet, depending on whether the plane at infinity cuts it in two lines, or in a nondegenerate conic respectively. These are doubly [[ruled surface]]s of negative Gaussian curvature.\n\nThe degenerate form\n:<math>X_0^2-X_1^2-X_2^2=0. \\, </math>\ngenerates the elliptic cylinder, the parabolic cylinder, the hyperbolic cylinder, or the cone, depending on whether the plane at infinity cuts it in a point, a line, two lines, or a nondegenerate conic respectively. These are singly ruled surfaces of zero Gaussian curvature.\n\nWe see that projective transformations don't mix Gaussian curvatures of different sign. This is true for general surfaces. <ref>S.

      "text": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n[[Image:DoubleCone.png|thumb|250px|right|A circular conical surface]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], a ('''general''') '''conical surface''' is the unbounded [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] formed by the union of all the straight [[line (mathematics)|lines]] that pass through a fixed point &mdash; the ''apex'' or ''vertex'' &mdash; and any point of some fixed [[space curve]] &mdash; the ''directrix'' &mdash; that does not contain the apex.  Each of those lines is called a ''generatrix'' of the surface. \n\nEvery conic surface is [[ruled surface|ruled]] and [[developable surface|developable]].  In general, a conical surface consists of two congruent unbounded halves joined by the apex.  Each half is called a '''nappe''', and is the union of all the [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|ray]]s that start at the apex and pass through a point of some fixed space curve.  (In some cases, however, the two nappes may intersect, or even coincide with the full surface.) Sometimes the term \"conical surface\" is used to mean just one nappe.\n\nIf the directrix is a circle <math>C</math>, and the apex is located on the circle's ''axis'' (the line that contains the center of <math>C</math> and is perpendicular to its plane), one obtains the ''right circular conical surface''. This special case is often called a ''[[cone (geometry)|cone]]'', because it is one of the two distinct surfaces that bound the [[geometric solid]] of that name. This geometric object can also be described as the set of all points swept by a line that intercepts the axis and [[rotation|rotates]] around it; or the union of all lines that intersect the axis at a fixed point <math>p</math> and at a fixed angle <math>\\theta</math>.

It is the idealized version of a solid physical [[tin can]] having lids on top and bottom.\n\nThis traditional view is still used in elementary treatments of geometry, but the advanced mathematical viewpoint has shifted to the [[infinite set|infinite]] curvilinear [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] and this is how a cylinder is now defined in various modern branches of geometry and topology.\n\nThe shift in the basic meaning (solid versus surface) has created some ambiguity with terminology. It is generally hoped that context makes the meaning clear. In this article both points of view are presented and distinguished by referring to ''solid cylinders'' and ''cylindrical surfaces'', but keep in mind that in the literature the unadorned term cylinder could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the ''right circular cylinder''.\n\n==Solid cylinders==\nThe definitions and results in this section are taken from the 1913 text, ''Plane and Solid Geometry'' by George Wentworth and David Eugene Smith {{harv|Wentworth|Smith|1913}}.\n\nA ''{{dfn|cylindrical surface}}'' is a [[Surface (mathematics)|surface]] consisting of all the points on all the lines which are [[parallel lines|parallel]] to a given line and which pass through a fixed [[plane curve]] in a plane not parallel to the given line. Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an ''element'' of the cylindrical surface. From a [[kinematics]] point of view, given a plane curve, called the ''directrix'', a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line, called the ''generatrix'', not in the plane of the directrix, moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix. Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface.\n[[File:Cylinders.svg|thumb|200px|A right and an oblique circular cylinder]]\nA [[Solid geometry|solid]] bounded by a cylindrical surface and two [[parallel planes]] is called a (solid) ''{{dfn|cylinder}}''. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an ''element of the cylinder''. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a ''{{dfn|base}}'' of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a ''{{dfn|right cylinder}}'', otherwise it is called an ''{{dfn|oblique cylinder}}''. If the bases are [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] (regions whose boundary is a [[Circle (mathematics)|circle]]) the cylinder is called a ''{{dfn|circular cylinder}}''. In some elementary treatments, a cylinder always means a circular cylinder.<ref>{{citation|first=Harold R.|last=Jacobs|title=Geometry|year=1974|publisher=W. H. Freeman and Co.|isbn=0-7167-0456-0|page=607}}</ref>\n\nThe ''{{dfn|height}}'' (or altitude) of a cylinder is the [[perpendicular]] distance between its bases.\n\nThe cylinder obtained by rotating a [[line segment]] about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a ''{{dfn|cylinder of revolution}}''. A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder. The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment. The line that the segment is revolved about is called the ''{{dfn|axis}}'' of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases.\n[[File:Circular cylinder rh.svg|thumb|180px|A right circular cylinder with radius {{math|''r''}} and height {{math|''h''}}]]\n\n===Right circular cylinders===\n\nThe bare term ''cylinder'' often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis, that is, a right circular cylinder, as shown in the figure. The cylindrical surface without the ends is called an ''{{dfn|open cylinder}}''. The formulae for the [[surface area]] and the [[volume]] of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity.\n\nA right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the [[solid of revolution]] generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides. These cylinders are used in an integration technique (the \"disk method\") for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution.<ref>{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 283}}</ref>\n\n===Cylindric sections===\n[[Image:Cylindric section.svg|thumb|left|120px|Cylindric section]]\n\nA cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder's surface with a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]. They are, in general, curves and are special types of [[cross section (geometry)|''plane sections'']]. The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a [[parallelogram]].<ref name=WS354>{{harvnb|Wentworth|Smith|1913|loc=p. 354}}</ref> Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a [[rectangle]].<ref name=WS354 />\n\nA cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a ''{{dfn|right section}}''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wentworth|Smith|1913|loc=p. 357}}</ref> If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder. In more generality, if a right section of a cylinder is a [[conic section]] (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic, elliptic or hyperbolic respectively.  \n[[File:Blue cut-cylinder.gif|thumb|Cylindric sections of a right circular cylinder]]\nFor a right circular cylinder, there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder. First, consider planes that intersect a base in at most one point. A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element.  The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an [[ellipse]].<ref>{{cite web| title=MathWorld: Cylindric section| url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423032831/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CylindricSection.html| archivedate=2008-04-23| df=}}</ref> If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section. If such a plane contains two elements, it has a rectangle as a cylindric section, otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse. Finally, if a plane contains more than two points of a base, it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle.\n\nIn the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse, the [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] {{math|''e''}} of the cylindric section and [[semi-major axis]] {{math|''a''}} of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder {{math|''r''}} and the angle {{math|''α''}} between the secant plane and cylinder axis, in the following way:\n\n:::<math>e=\\cos\\alpha,</math>\n\n:::<math>a=\\frac{r}{\\sin\\alpha}.</math>\n\n===Volume===\nIf the base of a circular cylinder has a [[radius]]  {{math|''r''}} and the cylinder has height {{mvar|h}}, then its [[volume]] is given by\n\n:{{math|1=''V'' = π''r''<sup>2</sup>''h''}}.\n\nThis formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder.<ref>{{harvnb|Wentworth|Smith|1913|loc=p. 359}}</ref>\n\nThis formula may be established by using [[Cavalieri's principle]].\n[[File:Elliptic cylinder abh.svg|thumb|A solid elliptic cylinder with the semi-axes {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} for the base ellipse and height {{math|''h''}}]]\nIn more generality, by the same principle, the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height. For example, an elliptic cylinder with a base having [[Semi-major and semi-minor axes|semi-major axis]] {{mvar|a}}, semi-minor axis {{mvar|b}} and height {{mvar|h}} has a volume {{math|1=''V'' = ''Ah''}}, where {{mvar|A}} is the area of the base ellipse (= {{math|{{pi}}''ab''}}). This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration, where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive {{mvar|x}}-axis and {{math|1=''A''(''x'') = ''A''}} the area of each elliptic cross-section, thus:\n:<math>V=\\int_0^h A(x) dx = \\int_0^h \\pi ab dx = \\pi ab \\int_0^h dx = \\pi abh.</math>\n\nUsing [[cylindrical coordinates]], the volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated by integration over\n:::<math>=\\int_{0}^{h} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{r} s \\,\\, ds \\, d\\phi \\, dz</math>\n:::<math>=\\pi\\,r^2\\,h.</math>\n\n===Surface area===\nHaving radius {{math|''r''}} and altitude (height) {{mvar|h}}, the [[surface area]] of a right circular cylinder, oriented so that its axis is vertical, consists of three parts:\n \n* the area of the top base: {{math|π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}\n* the area of the bottom base: {{math|π''r''<sup>2</sup>}}\n* the area of the side: {{math|2π''rh''}}\n\nThe area of the top and bottom bases is the same, and is called the ''base area'', {{math|''B''}}. The area of the side is known as the ''{{dfn|lateral area}}'', {{math|''L''}}.\n\nAn ''open cylinder'' does not include either top or bottom elements, and therefore has surface area (lateral area)\n:{{math|1=''L'' = 2π''rh''}}.\n\nThe surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components: top, bottom and side. Its surface area is therefore,\n:{{math|1=''A'' = ''L'' + 2''B'' = 2π''rh'' + 2π''r''<sup>2</sup> = 2π''r''(''h'' + ''r'') = π''d''(''r'' + ''h'')}},\nwhere {{math|1=''d'' = 2''r''}} is the [[diameter]] of the circular top or bottom.\n\nFor a given volume, the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has {{math|1=''h'' = 2''r''}}. Equivalently, for a given surface area, the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has {{math|1=''h'' = 2''r''}}, that is, the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle).<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus With Applications|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first1=Peter D.|last1=Lax|author1-link=Peter Lax|first2=Maria Shea|last2=Terrell|publisher=Springer|year=2013|isbn=9781461479468|page=178|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dDq3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206163427/https://books.google.com/books?id=dDq3BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA178|archivedate=2018-02-06|df=}}.</ref>\n\nThe lateral area, {{mvar|L}}, of a circular cylinder, which need not be a right cylinder, is more generally given by:\n:{{math|1=''L'' = ''e'' × ''p''}},\nwhere {{mvar|e}} is the length of an element and {{mvar|p}} is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder.<ref>{{harvnb|Wentworth|Smith|1913|loc=p. 358}}</ref> This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder.\n[[File:Zylinder-rohr-s.svg|thumb|180px|Hollow cylinder]]\n\n=== Right circular hollow cylinder (cylindrical shell)===\n\nA ''right circular hollow cylinder'' (or ''{{dfn|cylindrical shell}}'') is a three-dimensional region bounded by two right circular cylinders having the same axis and two parallel [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] bases perpendicular to the cylinders' common axis, as in the diagram.\n\nLet the height be {{math|''h''}}, internal radius {{math|''r''}}, and external radius {{math|''R''}}.

The sphere has a volume {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface area  {{nowrap|two-thirds}} that of the cylinder (including the bases). Since the values for the cylinder were already known, he obtained, for the first time, the corresponding values for the sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is {{math|1={{sfrac|4|3}}{{pi}}''r''<sup>3</sup> = {{sfrac|2|3}} (2{{pi}}''r''<sup>3</sup>)}}. The surface area of this sphere is {{math|1=4{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup> = {{sfrac|2|3}} (6{{pi}}''r''<sup>2</sup>)}}. A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.\n\n==Cylindrical surfaces==\n{{anchor|elliptic cylinder|parabolic cylinder|hyperbolic cylinder}}\nIn some areas of geometry and topology the term ''cylinder'' refers to what we have called a cylindrical surface. To repeat, throughout this section a cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line.<ref>{{harvnb|Albert|2016|loc=p. 43}}</ref> Such cylinders have, at times, been referred to as ''{{dfn|generalized cylinders}}''.

Among quadric surfaces, an ellipsoid is characterized by either of the two following properties. Every planar [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] is either an [[ellipse]], or is empty, or is reduced to a single point (this explains the name, meaning \"ellipse like\"). It is [[bounded set|bounded]], which means that it may be enclosed in a sufficiently large [[sphere]].\n\nAn ellipsoid has three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]] which intersect at a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], called the center of the ellipsoid. The [[line segment]]s that are delimited on the axes of symmetry by the ellipsoid are called the ''principal axes'', or simply axes of the ellipsoid. If the three axes have different lengths, the ellipsoid is said to be ''tri-axial'' or rarely ''scalene'', and the axes are uniquely defined.\n\nIf two of the axes have the same length, then the ellipsoid is an ellipsoid of [[surface of revolution|revolution]], also called a [[spheroid]]. In this case, the ellipsoid is invariant under a [[rotation]] around the third axis, and there are thus infinitely many ways of choosing the two perpendicular axes of the same length. If the third axis is shorter, the ellipsoid is an [[oblate spheroid]]; if it is longer, it is a [[prolate spheroid]]. If the three axes have the same length, the ellipsoid is a [[sphere]].\n\n==Standard equation==\nUsing a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] in which the origin is the center of the ellipsoid and the coordinate axes are axes of the ellipsoid, the [[implicit surface|implicit equation]] of the ellipsoid has the standard form\n:<math>{x^2 \\over a^2}+{y^2 \\over b^2}+{z^2 \\over c^2}=1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are positive [[real number]]s.\n\nThe points {{math|(''a'', 0, 0)}}, {{math|(0, ''b'', 0)}} and {{math|(0, 0, ''c'')}} lie on the surface. The line segments from the origin to these points are called the principal semi-axes of the ellipsoid, because {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} are half the length of the principal axes. They correspond to the [[semi-major axis]] and [[semi-minor axis]] of an [[ellipse]].\n\nIf <math>a=b>c,</math> one has an [[oblate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b<c,</math> one has a [[prolate spheroid]]; if <math>a=b=c,</math> one has a [[sphere]].\n\n== Parameterization  ==\nThe ellipsoid may be parameterized in several ways, which are simpler to express when the ellipsoid axes coincide with coordinate axes.

A '''hyperboloid''' is a surface that may be obtained from a hyperboloid of revolution by deforming it by means of directional [[scaling (geometry)|scaling]]s, or more generally, of an [[affine transformation]].\n\nA hyperboloid is a [[quadric surface]], that is a [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] that may be defined as the [[zero set]] of a [[polynomial]] of degree two in three variables. Among quadric surfaces, a hyperboloid is characterized by not being a [[conical surface|cone]] or a [[cylinder]], having a [[central symmetry|center of symmetry]], and intersecting many [[plane (geometry)|planes]] into hyperbolas. A hyperboloid has also three pairwise [[perpendicular]] [[rotational symmetry|axes of symmetry]], and three pairwise perpendicular [[reflection symmetry|planes of symmetry]].\n\nGiven a hyperboloid, if one chooses a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] whose axes are axes of symmetry of the hyperboloid, and origin is the center of symmetry of the hyperboloid, then the hyperboloid may be defined by one of the two following equations:\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= 1,</math> \nor\n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2}= -1.</math>\nBoth of these surfaces are [[asymptotic]] to the cone of equation \n:<math> {x^2 \\over a^2} + {y^2 \\over b^2} - {z^2 \\over c^2} = 0 .</math>\nOne has an hyperboloid of revolution if and only if <math>a^2=b^2.</math> Otherwise, the axes are uniquely defined ([[up to]] the exchange of the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis.\n\nThere are two kinds of hyperboloids. In the first case ({{math|+1}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''one-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''hyperbolic hyperboloid'''. It is a [[connected set|connected surface]], which has a negative [[Gaussian curvature]] at every point. This implies that the [[tangent plane]] at any point intersects the hyperboloid at two [[line (geometry)|lines]], and thus that the one-sheet hyperboloid is a [[doubly ruled]] surface.\n\nIn the second case ({{math|−1}} in the right-hand side of the equation), one has a '''two-sheet hyperboloid''', also called '''elliptic hyperboloid'''. The surface has two [[connected component (topology)|connected component]]s, and a positive Gaussian curvature at every point.

In spite of its positive curvature, the hyperboloid of two sheets with another suitably chosen metric can also be used as a [[Hyperboloid model|model]] for hyperbolic geometry.\n\n==Generalised equations==\nMore generally, an arbitrarily oriented hyperboloid, centered at {{math|'''v'''}}, is defined by the equation\n:<math>(\\mathbf{x-v})^\\mathrm{T} A (\\mathbf{x-v}) = 1,</math>\nwhere {{math|''A''}} is a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] and {{math|'''x'''}}, {{math|'''v'''}} are [[euclidean vector|vectors]].\n\nThe [[eigenvector]]s of {{math|''A''}} define the principal directions of the hyperboloid and the [[eigenvalue]]s of A are the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]]s of the squares of the semi-axes: <math>{1/a^2}</math>, <math>{1/b^2}  </math> and <math>{1/c^2}</math>. The one-sheet hyperboloid has two positive eigenvalues and one negative eigenvalue. The two-sheet hyperboloid has one positive eigenvalue and two negative eigenvalues.\n\n==In more than three dimensions==\nImaginary hyperboloids are frequently found in mathematics of higher dimensions. For example, in a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] one has the use of a [[quadratic form]]:\n: <math>q(x) = \\left(x_1^2+\\cdots + x_k^2\\right)-\\left(x_{k+1}^2+\\cdots + x_n^2\\right), \\quad k < n .</math> \nWhen {{math|''c''}} is any [[constant (mathematics)|constant]], then the part of the space given by\n:<math>\\lbrace x \\ :\\ q(x) = c \\rbrace </math>\nis called a ''hyperboloid''. The degenerate case corresponds to {{math|1=''c'' = 0}}.\n\nAs an example, consider the following passage:<ref>Thomas Hawkins (2000) ''Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869—1926'', §9.3 \"The Mathematization of Physics at Göttingen\", see page 340, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-98963-3}}</ref>\n:... the velocity vectors always lie on a surface which Minkowski calls a four-dimensional hyperboloid since, expressed in terms of purely real coordinates {{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>4</sub>)}}, its equation is {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} − ''y''{{su|b=4|p=2}} {{=}} −1}}, analogous to the hyperboloid {{math|''y''{{su|b=1|p=2}} + ''y''{{su|b=2|p=2}} − ''y''{{su|b=3|p=2}} {{=}} −1}} of three-dimensional space.\n\nHowever, the term '''quasi-sphere''' is also used in this context since the sphere and hyperboloid have some commonality (See {{section link||Relation to the sphere}} below).\n\n== Hyperboloid structures ==\n{{main|Hyperboloid structure}}\nOne-sheeted hyperboloids are used in construction, with the structures called [[hyperboloid structure]]s. A hyperboloid is a [[doubly ruled surface]]; thus, it can be built with straight steel beams, producing a strong structure at a lower cost than other methods. Examples include [[cooling tower]]s, especially of [[power station]]s, and [[list of hyperboloid structures|many other structures]].\n\n<gallery caption=\"Gallery of one sheet hyperboloid structures\" widths = 150px heights = 200px>\n Adziogol hyperboloid Lighthouse by Vladimir Shukhov 1911.jpg|The [[Adziogol Lighthouse]], [[Ukraine]], 1911.\n Kobe port tower11s3200.jpg|[[Kobe Port Tower]], [[Japan]], 1963.\n Mcdonnell planetarium slsc.jpg|[[Saint Louis Science Center]]'s James S.

The following passage from page 673 shows how Hamilton uses biquaternion algebra and vectors from [[quaternion]]s to produce hyperboloids from the equation of a [[sphere]]:\n::... the ''equation of the unit sphere'' {{math|1=''&rho;''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}, and change the vector {{math|''&rho;''}} to a ''bivector form'', such as {{math|''&sigma;'' + ''&tau;'' {{radic|−1}}}}.  The equation of the sphere then breaks up into the system of the two following,\n:::{{math|1=''&sigma;''<sup>2</sup> &minus; ''&tau;''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}, {{math|1='''S'''.''&sigma;&tau;'' = 0}};\n::and suggests our considering {{math|''&sigma;''}} and {{math|''&tau;''}} as two real and rectangular vectors, such that\n:::{{math|1='''T'''''&tau;'' = ('''T'''''&sigma;''<sup>2</sup> &minus; 1 )<sup>1/2</sup>}}.\n::Hence it is easy to infer that if we assume {{math|''&sigma;'' <math>\\parallel</math> ''&lambda;''}}, where {{math|''&lambda;''}} is a vector in a given position, the ''new real vector'' {{math|''&sigma;'' + ''&tau;''}} will terminate on the surface of a ''double-sheeted and equilateral hyperboloid''; and that if, on the other hand, we assume {{math|''&tau;'' <math>\\parallel</math> ''&lambda;''}}, then the locus of the extremity of the real vector {{math|''&sigma;'' + ''&tau;''}} will be an ''equilateral but single-sheeted hyperboloid''. The study of these two hyperboloids is, therefore, in this way connected very simply, through biquaternions, with the study of the sphere; ...\nIn this passage {{math|'''S'''}} is the operator giving the scalar part of a quaternion, and {{math|'''T'''}} is the \"tensor\", now called [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], of a quaternion.\n\nA modern view of the unification of the sphere and hyperboloid uses the idea of a [[conic section]] as a [[conic section#As slice of quadratic form|slice of a quadratic form]]. Instead of a [[conical surface]], one requires conical [[hypersurface]]s in [[four-dimensional space]] with points {{math|1=''p'' = (''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'') &isin; '''R'''<sup>4</sup>}} determined by [[quadratic form]]s. First consider the conical hypersurface\n:<math>P = \\lbrace p \\ : \\ w^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \\rbrace </math> and\n:<math>H_r = \\lbrace p \\ :\\  w = r \\rbrace ,</math> which is a [[hyperplane]].\nThen <math>P \\cap H_r</math> is the sphere with radius {{math|''r''}}. On the other hand, the conical hypersurface\n:<math>Q = \\lbrace p \\ :\\  w^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 \\rbrace</math> provides that <math>Q \\cap H_r</math> is a hyperboloid.\n\nIn the theory of [[quadratic form]]s, a '''unit [[quasi-sphere]]''' is the subset of a quadratic space {{math|''X''}} consisting of the {{math|''x'' &isin; ''X''}} such that the quadratic norm of {{math|''x''}} is one.<ref>[[Ian R.

The generatrices and parallels generates\na 3D dual cone. The hypermeridians generates a set of concentric spheres. ]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], a '''hypercone''' (or '''spherical cone''') is the figure in the 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] represented by the equation\n\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - w^2 = 0.</math>\n\nIt is a [[quadric]] surface, and is one of the possible 3-[[manifold]]s which are 4-dimensional equivalents of the [[conical surface]] in 3 dimensions. It is also named '''spherical cone''' because its intersections with [[hyperplane]]s perpendicular to the ''w''-axis are [[sphere]]s. A four-dimensional '''right spherical hypercone''' can be thought of as a sphere which expands with time, starting its expansion from a single point source, such that the center of the expanding sphere remains fixed.  An '''oblique spherical hypercone''' would be a sphere which expands with time, again starting its expansion from a point source, but such that the center of the expanding sphere moves with a uniform velocity.\n\n==Parametric form==\nA right spherical hypercone can be described by the function\n:<math> \\vec \\sigma (\\phi, \\theta, t) = (t s \\cos \\theta \\cos \\phi, t s \\cos \\theta \\sin \\phi, t s \\sin \\theta, t) </math>\nwith vertex at the origin and expansion speed ''s''.\n\nAn oblique spherical hypercone could then be described by the function\n:<math> \\vec \\sigma (\\phi, \\theta, t) = (v_x t + t s \\cos \\theta \\cos \\phi, v_y t + t s \\cos \\theta \\sin \\phi, v_z t + t s \\sin \\theta, t) </math>\nwhere <math> (v_x, v_y, v_z) </math> is the 3-velocity of the center of the expanding sphere.\nAn example of such a cone would be an expanding [[sound wave]] as seen from the point of view of a moving reference frame: e.g. the sound wave of a [[jet aircraft]] as seen from the jet's own reference frame.\n\nNote that the 3D-surfaces above enclose [[Four-dimensional space|4D-hypervolumes]], which are the 4-cones proper.\n\n==Geometrical interpretation==\nThe spherical cone consists of two unbounded ''nappes'', which meet at the origin and are the analogues of the nappes of the 3-dimensional conical surface. The ''upper nappe'' corresponds with the half with positive ''w''-coordinates, and the ''lower nappe'' corresponds with the half with negative ''w''-coordinates.\n\nIf it is restricted between the hyperplanes ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r'' for some nonzero ''r'', then it may be closed by a [[ball (mathematics)|3-ball]] of radius ''r'', centered at (0,0,0,''r''), so that it bounds a finite 4-dimensional volume. This volume is given by the formula {{sfrac|1|3}}{{pi}}''r''<sup>4</sup>, and is the 4-dimensional equivalent of the [[cone (geometry)|solid cone]]. The ball may be thought of as the 'lid' at the base of the 4-dimensional cone's nappe, and the origin becomes its 'apex'.\n\nThis shape may be [[graphical projection|projected]] into 3-dimensional space in various ways. If projected onto the ''xyz'' [[hyperplane]], its image is a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]. If projected onto the ''xyw'', ''xzw'', or ''yzw'' hyperplanes, its image is a [[cone (geometry)|solid cone]]. If projected onto an oblique hyperplane, its image is either an [[ellipsoid]] or a solid cone with an ellipsoidal base (resembling an [[ice cream cone]]). These images are the analogues of the possible images of the solid cone projected to 2 dimensions.\n\n===Construction===\nThe (half) hypercone may be constructed in a manner analogous to the construction of a 3D cone. A 3D cone may be thought of as the result of stacking progressively smaller discs on top of each other until they taper to a point. Alternatively, a 3D cone may be regarded as the volume swept out by an upright [[isosceles triangle]] as it rotates about its base.\n\nA 4D hypercone may be constructed analogously: by stacking progressively smaller balls on top of each other in the 4th direction until they taper to a point, or taking the hypervolume swept out by a tetrahedron standing upright in the 4th direction as it rotates freely about its base in the 3D hyperplane on which it rests.\n\n==Temporal interpretation==\n{{main|Minkowski space}}\nIf the ''w''-coordinate of the equation of the spherical cone is interpreted as the distance ''ct'', where ''t'' is [[coordinate time]] and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] (a constant), then it is the shape of the [[light cone]] in [[special relativity]]. In this case, the equation is usually written as:\n\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (ct)^2 = 0,</math>\n\nwhich is also the equation for [[Spherical wave|spherical wave fronts]] of light.<ref>{{cite book|title=3000 Solved Problems in Physics|series=Schaum Series|author=A.

However, while the Jacobi ellipsoid spins bodily, with no internal flow of the fluid in the rotating frame, the Dedekind ellipsoid maintains a fixed orientation, with the constituent fluid circulating within it.

The angular velocity <math>\\Omega</math> of the Jacobi ellipsoid and vorticity of the corresponding Dedekind ellipsoid are related by<ref name=\"Chandrasekhar1965\"/>\n\n:<math>\\zeta = \\left( \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a}\\right) \\Omega.</math>\n\nThat is, each particle of the fluid of the Dedekind ellipsoid describes a [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] elliptical circuit in the same period in which the Jacobi spheroid performs one rotation.\n\nIn the special case of <math>a = b</math>, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids (and the Maclaurin spheroid) become one and the same; bodily rotation and circular flow amount to the same thing. In this case <math>\\zeta = 2 \\Omega</math>, as is always true for a rigidly rotating body.\n\nIn the general case, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids have the same energy<ref name=\"Bardeen\"/>, but the angular momentum of the Jacobi spheroid is the greater by a factor of<ref name=\"Bardeen\"/>\n\n:<math>\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{Jac}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Ded}}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{b}{a}\\right).</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Maclaurin spheroid]]\n*[[Riemann ellipsoid]]\n*[[Roche ellipsoid]]\n*[[Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem]]\n*[[Spheroid]]\n*[[Ellipsoid]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Chandrasekhar1965\">{{cite journal\n |last          = Chandrasekhar\n |first         = Subrahmanyan\n |authorlink    = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar\n |title         = The Equilibrium and the Stability of the Dedekind Ellipsoids\n |journal       = [[Astrophysical Journal]]\n |volume        = 141\n |date          = 1965\n |pages         = 1043–1055\n |bibcode       = 1965ApJ...141.1043C\n |url           = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1965ApJ...141.1043C\n|doi= 10.1086/148195\n }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bardeen\">{{cite book\n |last          = Bardeen\n |first         = James M.\n |authorlink    = James M.

      "text": "A '''Maclaurin spheroid''' is an oblate [[spheroid]] which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. This spheroid is named after the [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[mathematician]] [[Colin Maclaurin]], who formulated it for the shape of [[Earth]] in 1742.<ref>Maclaurin, Colin. A Treatise of Fluxions: In Two Books. 1. Vol. 1. Ruddimans, 1742.</ref>  In fact the figure of the Earth is far less oblate than this, since the Earth is not homogeneous, but has a dense iron core.

If such a spheroid is composed of a viscous fluid, and if it suffers a perturbation which breaks its rotational symmetry, then it will gradually elongate into the Jacobi ellipsoidal form, while dissipating its excess energy as heat.  This is termed ''secular instability''.  However, for a similar spheroid composed of an inviscid fluid, the perturbation will merely result in an undamped oscillation.  This is described as ''dynamic'' (or ''ordinary'') ''stability''.\n\nA Maclaurin spheroid of eccentricity greater than 0.952887<ref name=\"PoissonAndWill\"/> is dynamically unstable.  Even if it is composed of an inviscid fluid and has no means of losing energy, a suitable perturbation will grow (at least initially) exponentially.

The term \"paraboloid\" is derived from [[parabola]], which refers to a [[conic section]] that has a similar property of symmetry. \n\nEvery [[plane section]] of a paraboloid by a plane [[Parallel (geometry)#A line and a plane|parallel]] to the axis of symmetry is a parabola. The paraboloid is '''hyperbolic''' if every other plane section is either a [[hyperbola]], or two crossing lines (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). The paraboloid is '''elliptic''' if every other nonempty plane section is either an [[ellipse]], or a single point (in the case of a section by a tangent plane). A paraboloid is either elliptic or hyperbolic.\n\nEquivalently, a paraboloid may be defined as a quadric surface that is not a [[cylinder]], and has an [[implicit surface|implicit equation]] whose part of degree two may be factored over the [[complex number]]s into two different linear factors.

It is the shape of the [[parabolic reflector]]s used in [[mirror]]s, [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] dishes, and the like; and is also the shape of the surface of a rotating liquid, a principle used in [[liquid mirror telescope]]s and in making solid telescope mirrors (see [[rotating furnace]]). This shape is also called a ''circular paraboloid''.\n\n[[File:Paraboloid-3dmesh.png|thumb|right|Mesh Grid of Paraboloid surface]]\n[[File:Paraboloid3d.png|thumb|right|Paraboloid Surface (0.5 transparency)]]\n\nThere is a point called the [[Focus (optics)|''focus'']] (or ''focal point'') on the axis of a circular paraboloid such that, if the paraboloid is a mirror, light from a point source at the focus is reflected into a parallel beam, parallel to the axis of the paraboloid. This also works the other way around: a parallel beam of light incident on the paraboloid parallel to its axis is concentrated at the focal point. This applies also for other waves, hence [[parabolic antenna]]s.

The lines in each family are parallel to a common plane, but not to each other. Hence the hyperbolic paraboloid is a [[conoid]].\n\nThese properties characterize hyperbolic paraboloids and are used in one of the oldest definitions of hyperbolic paraboloids: ''a hyperbolic paraboloid is a surface that may be generated by a moving line that is parallel to a fixed plane and crosses two fixed [[skew lines]]''.

They must all be in the same [[unit of length]]. If two of these three lengths are known, this equation can be used to calculate the third.\n\nA more complex calculation is needed to find the diameter of the dish ''measured along its surface''. This is sometimes called the \"linear diameter\", and equals the diameter of a flat, circular sheet of material, usually metal, which is the right size to be cut and bent to make the dish. Two intermediate results are useful in the calculation: {{math|''P'' {{=}} 2''F''}} (or the equivalent: {{math|''P'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''R''{{sup|2}}|2''D''}}}}) and {{math|''Q'' {{=}} {{sqrt|''P''{{sup|2}} + ''R''{{sup|2}}}}}}, where {{math|''F''}}, {{math|''D''}}, and {{math|''R''}} are defined as above. The diameter of the dish, measured along the surface, is then given by\n:<math>\\frac{RQ}{P} + P \\ln\\left(\\frac{R+Q}{P}\\right),</math>\nwhere {{math|ln ''x''}} means the [[natural logarithm]] of {{math|''x''}}, i.e. its logarithm to base {{math|''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''}}.\n\nThe volume of the dish, the amount of liquid it could hold if the rim were horizontal and the vertex at the bottom (e.g. the capacity of a paraboloidal [[wok]]), is given by\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{2} R^2 D,</math>\nwhere the symbols are defined as above. This can be compared with the formulae for the volumes of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] ({{math|π''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}), a [[sphere|hemisphere]] ({{math|{{sfrac|2π|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}, where {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''R''}}), and a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] ({{math|{{sfrac|π|3}}''R''{{sup|2}}''D''}}). {{math|π''R''{{sup|2}}}} is the aperture area of the dish, the area enclosed by the rim, which is proportional to the amount of sunlight a reflector dish can intercept. The surface area of a parabolic dish can be found using the area formula for a [[surface of revolution#Area formula|surface of revolution]] which gives\n:<math>A=\\frac{\\pi R\\left(\\sqrt{(R^2+4D^2)^3}-R^3\\right)}{6D^2}.</math>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Ellipsoid]]\n* [[Holophones]]\n* [[Hyperboloid]]\n* [[Hyperboloid structure]]\n* [[Liquid mirror telescope]], paraboloids produced by rotation\n* [[Parabola]]\n* [[Parabolic reflector]]\n* [[Parabolic reflector#Focus-balanced reflector]], paraboloid with focus at centre of mass\n* [[Quadratic form]]\n* [[Rotation of axes]]\n* [[Saddle point]]\n* [[Saddle roof]]\n* [[Translation of axes]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric shapes]]\n[[Category:Surfaces]]\n[[Category:Quadrics]]\n[[Category:Parabolas]]"

A spheroid has [[circular symmetry]].\n\nIf the ellipse is rotated about its major axis, the result is a ''prolate'' (elongated) spheroid, shaped like an [[American football]] or [[rugby football|rugby]] ball. If the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, the result is an ''oblate'' (flattened) spheroid, shaped like a [[lentil]]. If the generating ellipse is a circle, the result is a [[sphere]].\n\nDue to the combined effects of [[gravity]] and [[rotation of the Earth|rotation]], the [[figure of the Earth]] (and of all [[planet]]s) is not quite a sphere, but instead is slightly [[flattening|flattened]] in the direction of its axis of rotation. For that reason, in [[cartography]] the Earth is often approximated by an oblate spheroid instead of a sphere. The current [[World Geodetic System]] model uses a spheroid whose radius is {{cvt|6,378.137|km|mi}} at the [[Equator]] and {{cvt|6,356.752|km|mi}} at the [[geographical pole|poles]].\n\nThe word ''spheroid'' originally meant \"an approximately spherical body\", admitting irregularities even beyond the bi- or tri-axial ellipsoidal shape, and that is how the term is used in some older papers on [[geodesy]] (for example, referring to truncated spherical harmonic expansions of the Earth).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&lpg=PA103&ots=wAaSsOD2TG&dq=equipotential%20ellipsoid&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q=equipotential%20ellipsoid&f=false |title=Geodesy |last=Torge |first=Wolfgang |year=2001 |edition=3rd |page=104 |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]}}</ref>\n\n==Equation==\n[[File:ellipsoid-rot-ax.svg|thumb|350px| The assignment of semi-axes on a spheroid.

While these definitions are mathematically interchangeable, real-world calculations must lose some precision. To avoid confusion, an ellipsoidal definition considers its own values to be exact in the form it gives.\n\n==Applications==\nThe most common shapes for the density distribution of protons and neutrons in an [[atomic nucleus]] are [[spherical]], prolate, and oblate spheroidal, where the polar axis is assumed to be the spin axis (or direction of the spin [[angular momentum]] vector). Deformed nuclear shapes occur as a result of the competition between [[Electromagnetic force|electromagnetic]] repulsion between protons, [[surface tension]] and [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] [[Nuclear shell model|shell effects]].\n\n===Oblate spheroids===\n[[File:Jupiter_oblate_spheroid.png|thumb|The planet [[Jupiter]] is an oblate spheroid with flattening ratio 0.06487]]\nThe oblate spheroid is the approximate shape of many [[planet]]s and [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]], including [[Saturn]], [[Jupiter]] and the quickly-spinning star, [[Altair]].

Examples are [[Saturn]]'s satellites [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]], and [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]] and [[Uranus]]' satellite [[Miranda (moon)|Miranda]].\n\nIn contrast to being distorted into oblate spheroids via rapid rotation, celestial objects distort slightly into prolate spheroids via [[tide|tidal forces]] when they orbit a massive body in a close orbit. The most extreme example is Jupiter's moon [[Io (moon)|Io]], which becomes slightly more or less prolate in its orbit due to a slight eccentricity, causing intense [[volcanism]]. The major axis of the prolate spheroid does not run through the satellite's poles in this case, but through the two points on its equator directly facing toward and away from the primary.\n\nThe term is also used to describe the shape of some [[nebula|nebulae]] such as the [[Crab Nebula]].<ref name=\"Trimble1973\">{{ citation | last1 = Trimble | first1 = Virginia Louise | author1-link = Virginia Trimble | title = The Distance to the Crab Nebula and NP 0532 | date = October 1973 | journal = Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific | volume = 85 | issue = 507 | page = 579 | bibcode = 1973PASP...85..579T | doi = 10.1086/129507 }}</ref> [[Fresnel zone]]s, used to analyze wave propagation and interference in space, are a series of concentric prolate spheroids with principal axes aligned along the direct line-of-sight between a transmitter and a receiver.\n\nThe [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] of the [[actinide]] elements are shaped like prolate spheroids.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} In anatomy, near-spheroid organs such as [[testicle|testis]] may be measured by their [[Anatomical terms of location#Axes|long and short axes]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=safNmcP3lakC&pg=PA559 Page 559] in: {{cite book|title=Introduction to Vascular Ultrasonography|author=John Pellerito, Joseph F Polak|edition=6|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|year=2012|isbn=9781455737666}}</ref>\n\nMany submarines have a shape which can be described as prolate spheroid.<ref name=\"scientific american\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/football-science-shapes/ |title=What Do a Submarine, a Rocket and a Football Have in Common? |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=8 November 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Dynamical properties===\n{{see also|Ellipsoid#Dynamical properties}}\nFor a spheroid having uniform density, the [[moment of inertia]] is that of an ellipsoid with an additional axis of symmetry.

      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=January 2017}}\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically in [[geometric topology]], '''surgery theory''' is a collection of techniques used to produce one finite-dimensional [[manifold]] from another in a 'controlled' way, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Milnor|first=John|authorlink=John Milnor|year=1961}}. Originally developed for  differentiable (= [[differentiable manifolds|smooth]]) manifolds, surgery techniques also apply to [[piecewise linear manifold|PL]] (= piecewise linear) and [[topological manifold|topological]] manifolds. \n\nSurgery refers to cutting out parts of the manifold and replacing it with a part of another manifold, matching up along the cut or boundary. This is closely related to, but not identical with, [[handlebody]] decompositions. It is a major tool in the study and classification of manifolds of dimension greater than 3.\n\nMore technically, the idea is to start with a well-understood manifold ''M'' and perform surgery on it to produce a manifold ''M ''′ having some desired property, in such a way that the effects on the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], [[homotopy group]]s, or other invariants of the manifold are known.\n\nThe classification of [[exotic sphere]]s by {{harvs|txt|author1-link=Michel Kervaire|last=Kervaire|first=Michel|author2-link=John Milnor|last2=Milnor|year=1963}} led to the emergence of surgery theory as a major tool in high-dimensional topology.\n\n==Surgery on a manifold==\nIf ''X'', ''Y'' are manifolds with boundary, then the boundary of the product manifold is ∂(''X'' × ''Y'')=(∂''X'' × ''Y'') ∪ (''X'' × ∂''Y''). The basic observation which justifies surgery is that the space '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''S'''<sup>''q''−1</sup> can be understood either as the boundary of '''D'''<sup>''p''+1</sup> × '''S'''<sup>''q''-1</sup> or as the boundary of '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup>. In symbols, ∂('''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup>) = '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''S'''<sup>''q''−1</sup> = ∂('''D'''<sup>''p''+1</sup> × '''S'''<sup>''q''−1</sup>), where '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> is the ''q''-dimensional disk, i.e.,\nthe set of ''q''-dimensional points that are at distance one-or-less from a given fixed point (the center of the disk); for example, then, '''D'''<sup>''1''</sup> is (equivalent, or homeomorphic to), the unit interval, while '''D'''<sup>''2''</sup> is a circle together with the points in its interior.\n\nNow, given a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'' = ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q'' and an [[embedding]] <math>\\phi</math>: '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> → ''M'', define another ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M''′ to be\n:<math>M':= (M-\\operatorname{int~im}\\phi)\\;\\cup_{\\phi|_{S^p\\times S^{q-1}}} (D^{p+1} \\!\\times\\! S^{q-1}).</math>\nOne says that the manifold ''M''′ is produced by a ''surgery'' cutting out '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> and gluing in '''D'''<sup>''p''+1</sup> × '''S'''<sup>''q''−1</sup>, or by a ''p''-''surgery'' if one wants to specify the number ''p''. Strictly speaking, ''M''′ is a manifold with corners, but there is a canonical way to smooth them out. Notice that the submanifold that was replaced in ''M'' was of the same dimension as ''M'' (it was of [[codimension]] 0).\n\nSurgery is closely related to (but not the same as) [[Handlebody|handle attaching]]. Given an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-manifold with boundary (''L'', ∂''L'') and an embedding <math>\\phi</math>: '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> → ∂''L'', where ''n'' = ''p+q'', define another (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-manifold with boundary ''L''′ by\n:<math>L':= L\\; \\cup_\\phi (D^{p+1}\\!\\!\\times\\!D^q).</math>\nThe manifold ''L''′ is obtained by ''attaching a (''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handle'', with ∂''L''′ obtained from ∂''L'' by a ''p''-surgery\n:<math>\\partial L'= (\\partial L-\\operatorname{int~im}\\phi)\\; \\cup_{\\phi|_{S^p\\times S^{q-1}}} (D^{p+1} \\!\\times\\! S^{q-1}).</math>\n\nA surgery on ''M'' not only produces a new manifold ''M''′, but also a [[bordism|cobordism]] ''W'' between ''M'' and ''M''′. The ''trace'' of the surgery is the [[bordism|cobordism]] (''W''; ''M'', ''M''′), with  \n:<math> W:= (M\\times I)\\; \\cup_{S^p\\times D^q\\times \\{1\\}} (D^{p+1}\\!\\times\\!D^q)</math>\nthe (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold with boundary ∂''W'' = ''M'' ∪ ''M''′ obtained from the product ''M'' × ''I'' by attaching a (''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handle '''D'''<sup>''p''+1</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup>.\n\nSurgery is symmetric in the sense that the manifold ''M'' can be re-obtained from ''M''′ by a (''q''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)-surgery, the trace of which coincides with the trace of the original surgery, up to orientation.\n\nIn most applications, the manifold ''M'' comes with additional geometric structure, such as a map to some reference space, or additional bundle data. One then wants the surgery process to endow ''M''′ with the same kind of additional structure. For instance, a standard tool in surgery theory is surgery on [[normal invariants|normal maps]]: such a process changes a normal map to another normal map within the same bordism class.\n\n===Examples===\n1. '''Surgery on the circle'''\n\n[[Image:Circle-surgery.svg|thumb|right|Fig. 1]]\nAs per the above definition, a surgery on the circle consists of cutting out a copy of '''S'''<sup>0</sup> × '''D'''<sup>1</sup> and gluing in '''D'''<sup>1</sup> × '''S'''<sup>0</sup>. The pictures in Fig. 1  show that the result of doing this is either (i) '''S'''<sup>1</sup> again, or (ii) two copies of '''S'''<sup>1</sup>.\n\n[[Image:Sphere-surgery1.png|thumb|left|Fig. 2a]]\n[[Image:Sphere-surgery2.png|thumb|right|Fig. 2b]]\n\n2. '''Surgery on the 2-sphere'''\n\nIn this case there are more possibilities, since we can start by cutting out either '''S'''<sup>1</sup> × '''D'''<sup>1</sup> or '''S'''<sup>0</sup> × '''D'''<sup>2</sup>.\n\n*(a) '''S'''<sup>1</sup> × '''D'''<sup>1</sup>: If we remove a cylinder from the 2-sphere, we are left with two disks. We have to glue back in '''S'''<sup>0</sup> × '''D'''<sup>2</sup> - that is, two disks – and it is clear that the result of doing so is to give us two disjoint spheres. (Fig. 2a)\n\n[[File:Sphere-surgery4.png|thumb|right|Fig. 2c. This shape cannot be embedded in 3-space.]]\n*(b) '''S'''<sup>0</sup> × '''D'''<sup>2</sup>: Having cut out two disks '''S'''<sup>0</sup> × '''D'''<sup>2</sup>, we glue back in the cylinder '''S'''<sup>1</sup> × '''D'''<sup>1</sup>. There are two possible outcomes, depending on whether our gluing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the [[torus]] '''S'''<sup>1</sup> × '''S'''<sup>1</sup>, but if they are different, we obtain the [[Klein bottle|Klein Bottle]] (Fig. 2c).\n\n3. '''Surgery on the ''n''-sphere'''\n\nIf ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''q'', then <math>S^n=\\partial D^{n+1}\\approx \\partial (D^{p+1}\\times D^q)= S^p\\times D^q\\;\\cup\\;D^{p+1}\\times S^{q-1}</math>. The ''p''-surgery on '''S'''<sup>''n''</sup> is therefore <math>D^{p+1}\\times S^{q-1}\\;\\cup\\;D^{p+1}\\times S^{q-1}=S^{p+1}\\times S^{q-1}</math>. Examples 1 and 2 above were a special case of this.\n\n4. '''Morse functions'''\n\nSuppose that ''f'' is a [[Morse function]] on an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold, and suppose that ''c'' is a critical value with exactly one critical point in its preimage. If the index of this critical point is ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, then the level-set <math>M':=f^{-1}(c+\\epsilon)</math> is obtained from <math>M:=f^{-1}(c-\\epsilon)</math> by a ''p''-surgery. The bordism <math>W:=f^{-1}([c-\\epsilon,c+\\epsilon])</math> can be identified with the trace of this surgery.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Surgery and morse function.png|thumb|left|Fig. 4]] -->\nIndeed, in some coordinate chart around the critical point, the function ''f'' is of the form <math>-\\Vert x\\Vert^2 + \\Vert y\\Vert^2</math>, with <math>x\\in R^{p+1}, y\\in R^q</math>, and ''p''+''q''+1 = ''n''+1. [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/fig3.png  Fig. 3] shows, in this local chart, the manifold ''M'' in blue and the manifold ''M''′ in red. The colored region between ''M'' and ''M''′ corresponds to the bordism ''W''. The picture shows that ''W'' is diffeomorphic to the union\n:<math>W \\cong M\\times I \\cup_{S^p\\times D^q} D^{p+1}\\times D^q</math>\n(neglecting the issue of straightening corners), where ''M'' × ''I'' is colored in yellow, and <math>D^{p+1}\\times D^q</math> is colored in green. The manifold ''M''′, being a boundary component of ''W'', is therefore obtained from ''M'' by a ''p''-surgery.\n \nSince every bordism between closed manifolds has a Morse function where different critical points have different critical values, this shows that any bordism can be decomposed into traces of surgeries ('''handlebody decomposition'''). In particular, every manifold ''M'' may be regarded as a bordism from the boundary ∂''M'' (which may be empty) to the empty manifold, and so may be obtained from ∂''M'' × ''I'' by attaching handles.\n\n===Effects on homotopy groups, and comparison to cell-attachment===\nIntuitively, the process of surgery is the manifold analog of attaching a cell to a topological space, where the embedding ''φ'' takes the place of the attaching map. A simple attachment of a (''q''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-cell to an ''n''-manifold would destroy the manifold structure for dimension reasons, so it has to be thickened by crossing with another cell.\n\nUp to homotopy, the process of surgery on an embedding φ: '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> → ''M'' can be described as the attaching of a (''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-cell, giving the homotopy type of the trace, and the detaching of a ''q''-cell to obtain ''N''. The necessity of the detaching process can be understood as an effect of [[Poincaré duality]].\n\nIn the same way as a cell can be attached to a space to kill an element in some [[homotopy group]] of the space, a ''p''-surgery on a manifold ''M'' can often be used to kill an element <math>\\alpha\\in\\pi_p(M)</math>. Two points are important however: Firstly, the element <math>\\alpha\\in\\pi_p(M)</math> has to be representable by an embedding φ: '''S'''<sup>''p''</sup> × '''D'''<sup>''q''</sup> → ''M'' (which means embedding the corresponding sphere with a trivial [[normal bundle]]). For instance, it is not possible to perform surgery on an orientation-reversing loop. Secondly, the effect of the detaching process has to be considered, since it might also have an effect on the homotopy group under consideration. Roughly speaking, this second point is only important when ''p'' is at least of the order of half the dimension of&nbsp;''M''.\n\n==Application to classification of manifolds==\nThe origin and main application of surgery theory lies in the [[classification of manifolds]] of dimension greater than four. Loosely, the organizing questions of surgery theory are:\n* Is ''X'' a manifold?\n* Is ''f'' a diffeomorphism?\n\nMore formally, one must ask whether ''up to [[homotopy]]'':\n* Does a space ''X'' have the homotopy type of a smooth manifold of the same dimension?\n* Is a [[homotopy equivalence]] ''f'': ''M'' → ''N'' between two smooth manifolds [[homotopic]] to a diffeomorphism?\n\nIt turns out that the second (\"uniqueness\") question is a relative version of a question of the first (\"existence\") type; thus both questions can be treated with the same methods.\n\nNote that surgery theory does ''not'' give a [[complete set of invariants]] to these questions. Instead, it is [[obstruction theory|obstruction-theoretic]]: there is a primary obstruction, and a secondary obstruction called the [[surgery obstruction]] which is only defined if the primary obstruction vanishes, and which depends on the choice made in verifying that the primary obstruction vanishes.\n\n===The surgery approach===\nIn the classical approach, as developed by [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]], [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], [[Dennis Sullivan]] and [[C. T. C. Wall]], surgery is done on [[normal invariants|normal maps]] of degree one. Using surgery, the question \"Is the normal map ''f'': ''M'' → ''X'' of degree one cobordant to a homotopy equivalence?\" can be translated (in dimensions greater than four) to an algebraic statement about some element in an [[L-theory|L-group]] of the [[group ring]] <math>\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi_1(X)]</math>. More precisely, the question has a positive answer if and only if the [[surgery obstruction]] <math>\\sigma(f)\\in L_n(\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi_1(X)])</math> is zero, where ''n'' is the dimension of ''M''.\n\nFor example, consider the case where the dimension ''n=4k'' is a multiple of four, and <math>\\pi_1(X)=0</math>. It is known that <math>L_{4k}(\\mathbf{Z})</math> is isomorphic to the integers <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math>; under this isomorphism the surgery obstruction of ''f'' maps, up to a scalar factor, to the difference of the [[signature]]s <math>\\sigma(X)-\\sigma(M)</math> of ''X'' and ''M''. Hence a normal map of degree one is cobordant to a homotopy equivalence if and only if the signatures of domain and codomain agree.\n\nComing back to the \"existence\" question from above, we see that a space ''X'' has the homotopy type of a smooth manifold if and only if it receives a normal map of degree one whose surgery obstruction vanishes. This leads to a multi-step obstruction process: In order to speak of normal maps, ''X'' must satisfy an appropriate version of [[Poincaré duality]] which turns it into a [[Poincaré complex]]. Supposing that ''X'' is a Poincaré complex, the [[Thom space|Pontryagin–Thom construction]] shows that a normal map of degree one to ''X'' exists if and only if the [[Spivak normal fibration]] of ''X'' has a reduction to a [[stable vector bundle]]. If normal maps of degree one to ''X'' exist, their bordism classes (called '''normal invariants''') are classified by the set of homotopy classes <math>[X, G/O]</math>. Each of these normal invariants has a surgery obstruction; ''X'' has the homotopy type of a smooth manifold if and only if one of these obstructions is zero. Stated differently, this means that there is a choice of normal invariant with zero image under the '''surgery obstruction map''' \n:<math>[X, G/O] \\to L_n(\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi_1(X)]).</math>\n\n===Structure sets and surgery exact sequence===\nThe concept of [[surgery structure set|structure set]] is the unifying framework for both questions of existence and uniqueness. Roughly speaking, the structure set of a space ''X'' consists of homotopy equivalences ''M'' → ''X'' from some manifold to ''X'', where two maps are identified under a bordism-type relation. A necessary (but not in general sufficient) condition for the structure set of a space ''X'' to be non-empty is that ''X'' be an ''n''-dimensional Poincaré complex, i.e. that the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and [[cohomology]] groups be related by isomorphisms <math>H^*(X) \\cong H_{n-*}(X)</math> of an ''n''-dimensional manifold, for some integer ''n''. Depending on the precise definition and the category of manifolds ([[differentiable manifold|smooth]], [[piecewise linear manifold|PL]], or [[topological manifold|topological]]), there are various versions of structure sets. Since, by the [[s-cobordism theorem]], certain bordisms between manifolds are isomorphic (in the respective category) to cylinders, the concept of structure set allows a classification even up to [[diffeomorphism]].\n\nThe structure set and the surgery obstruction map are brought together in the [[surgery exact sequence]]. This sequence allows to determine the structure set of a Poincaré complex once the surgery obstruction map (and a relative version of it) are understood. In important cases, the smooth or topological structure set can be computed by means of the surgery exact sequence. Examples are the classification of [[exotic sphere]]s, and the proofs of the [[Borel conjecture]] for [[scalar curvature|negatively curved]] manifolds and manifolds with [[hyperbolic group|hyperbolic]] fundamental group.\n\nIn the topological category, the surgery exact sequence is the long exact sequence induced by a [[fibration sequence]] of [[spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectra]]. This implies that all the sets involved in the sequence are in fact abelian groups. On the spectrum level, the surgery obstruction map is an [[assembly map]] whose fiber is the block structure space of the corresponding manifold.\n\n==See also==\n*[[s-cobordism theorem]]\n*[[h-cobordism theorem]]\n*[[Whitehead torsion]]\n*[[Dehn surgery]]\n*[[Manifold decomposition]]\n*[[orientation character]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Browder | first1=William | author1-link=William Browder (mathematician)| title=Surgery on simply-connected manifolds | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | mr=0358813 | year=1972}}\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=Cappell | editor1-first=Sylvain | editor1-link=Sylvain Cappell|editor2-last=Ranicki | editor2-first=Andrew |editor2-link=Andrew Ranicki| editor3-last=Rosenberg | editor3-first=Jonathan | editor3-link=Jonathan Rosenberg (mathematician) | title=Surveys on surgery theory.

If the [[eigenvalue]]s on ''i''-forms are λ<sub>''j''</sub> then the zeta function ζ<sub>''i''</sub> is defined to be\n\n:<math>\\zeta_i(s) = \\sum_{\\lambda_j>0}\\lambda_j^{-s}</math>\n\nfor ''s'' large, and this is extended to all complex ''s'' by [[analytic continuation]].\nThe zeta regularized determinant of the Laplacian acting on ''i''-forms is\n\n:<math>\\Delta_i=\\exp(-\\zeta^\\prime_i(0))</math>\n\nwhich is formally the product of the positive eigenvalues of the laplacian acting on ''i''-forms.\nThe '''analytic torsion''' ''T''(''M'',''E'') is defined to be\n\n:<math>T(M,E) = \\exp\\left(\\sum_i (-1)^ii \\zeta^\\prime_i(0)/2\\right) = \\prod_i\\Delta_i^{-(-1)^ii/2}.</math>\n\n==Definition of Reidemeister torsion==\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a finite connected [[CW complex|CW-complex]] with [[fundamental group]] <math>\\pi := \\pi_1(X)</math>\nand [[universal cover]] <math>{\\tilde X}</math>, and let <math>U</math> be an orthogonal finite-dimensional <math>\\pi</math>-representation. Suppose that\n\n:<math>H^\\pi_n(X;U) := H_n(U \\otimes_{\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi]} C_*({\\tilde X})) = 0</math>\n\nfor all n. If we fix a cellular basis for <math>C_*({\\tilde X})</math> and an orthogonal <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-basis for <math>U</math>, then <math>D_* := U \\otimes_{\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi]} C_*({\\tilde X})</math> is a contractible finite based free <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-chain complex. Let <math>\\gamma_*: D_* \\to D_{*+1}</math> be any chain contraction of D<sub>*</sub>, i.e. <math>d_{n+1} \\circ \\gamma_n + \\gamma_{n-1} \\circ d_n = id_{D_n}</math> for all <math>n</math>.

The classification includes examples of [[homotopy equivalent]] 3-dimensional manifolds which are not [[homeomorphic]] — at the time (1935) the classification was only up to [[PL homeomorphism]], but later {{harvs|txt|first=E.J.|last=Brody|year=1960}} showed that this was in fact a classification up to [[homeomorphism]].\n\nJ. H. C. Whitehead defined the \"torsion\" of a homotopy equivalence between finite complexes. This is a direct generalization of the Reidemeister, Franz, and de Rham concept; but is a more delicate invariant. [[Whitehead torsion]] provides a key tool for the study of combinatorial or differentiable manifolds with nontrivial fundamental group and is closely related to the concept of \"simple homotopy type\", see {{harv|Milnor|1966}}\n\nIn 1960 Milnor discovered the duality relation of torsion invariants of manifolds and show that the (twisted) Alexander polynomial of knots is the Reidemister torsion of its knot complement in <math>S^3</math>. {{harv|Milnor|1962}} For each ''q'' the [[Poincaré duality]] <math>P_o</math> induces\n:<math>P_o:\\operatorname{det}(H_q(M))\\stackrel{\\sim}{\\longrightarrow}(\\operatorname{det}(H_{n-q}(M)))^{-1}</math>\nand then we obtain\n:<math>\\Delta(t)=\\pm t^n\\Delta(1/t).</math>\nThe representation of the fundamental group of knot complement plays a central role in them. It gives the relation between knot theory and torsion invariants.\n\n==Cheeger–Müller theorem==\n\nLet <math>(M,g)</math> be an orientable compact Riemann manifold of dimension n and <math>\\rho\\colon \\pi(M)\\rightarrow\\mathop{GL}(E)</math> a representation of the fundamental group of <math>M</math> on a real vector space of dimension N. Then we can define the de Rham complex\n:<math>\\Lambda^0\\stackrel{d_0}{\\longrightarrow}\\Lambda^1\\stackrel{d_1}{\\longrightarrow}\\cdots\\stackrel{d_{n-1}}{\\longrightarrow}\\Lambda^n</math>\nand the formal adjoint <math>d_p</math> and <math>\\delta_p</math> due to the flatness of <math>E_q</math>. As usual, we also obtain the Hodge Laplacian on p-forms \n:<math>\\Delta_p=\\delta_p d_p+d_{p-1}\\delta_{p-1}.</math>\n\nAssuming that <math>\\partial M=0</math>,  the Laplacian is then a symmetric positive semi-positive elliptic operator with pure point spectrum\n:<math>0\\le\\lambda_0\\le\\lambda_1\\le\\cdots\\rightarrow\\infty.</math>\nAs before,  we can therefore define a zeta function associated with the Laplacian <math>\\Delta_q</math> on <math>\\Lambda^q(E)</math> by\n:<math>\\zeta_q(s;\\rho)=\\sum_{\\lambda_j >0}\\lambda_j^{-s}=\\frac{1}{\\Gamma(s)}\\int^\\infty_0 t^{s-1}\\mathop{Tr}(e^{-t\\Delta_q} - P_q)dt,\\ \\ \\ \\mathop{Re}(s)>\\frac{n}{2}</math>\nwhere <math>P</math> is the projection of <math>L^2 \\Lambda(E)</math> onto the kernel space <math>\\mathcal{H}^q(E)</math> of the Laplacian <math>\\Delta_q</math>.  It was moreover shown by {{harv|Seeley|1967}} that <math>\\zeta_q(s;\\rho)</math> extends to a meromorphic function of <math>s\\in\\mathbf{C}</math> which is holomorphic at <math>s=0</math>.\n\nAs in the case of an orthogonal representation, we define the analytic torsion <math>T_M(\\rho;E)</math> by\n:<math>T_M(\\rho;E) = \\exp\\biggl(\\frac{1}{2}\\sum^n_{q=0}(-l)^qq\\frac{d}{ds}\\zeta_q(s;\\rho)\\biggl|_{s=0}\\biggr).</math>\n\nIn 1971 D.B. Ray and I.M. Singer conjectured that <math>T_M(\\rho;E)=\\tau_M(\\rho;\\mu)</math> for any unitary representation <math>\\rho</math>. This Ray–Singer conjecture was eventually proved, independently,  by   {{harvs|txt=yes|last=Cheeger|year1=1977|year2=1979}} and  {{harvtxt|Müller|1978}}. Both approaches focus on the logarithm of torsions and their traces. This is easier for odd-dimensional manifolds than in the even-dimensional case, which involves additional technical difficulties. This Cheeger–Müller theorem (that the two notions of torsion are equivalent), along with [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem|Atiyah–Patodi–Singer theorem]], later provided the basis for [[Chern–Simons theory|Chern–Simons perturbation theory]].\n\nA proof of the Cheeger-Müller theorem for arbitrary representations was later given by J. M. Bismut and Weiping Zhang. Their proof uses the [[Witten deformation]].\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|last=Bismut|first=J. -M.|last2=Zhang|first2=W.|date=1994-03-01|title=Milnor and ray-singer metrics on the equivariant determinant of a flat vector bundle|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01895837|journal=Geometric & Functional Analysis GAFA|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=136–212|doi=10.1007/BF01895837|issn=1420-8970}}\n* {{citation| doi=10.2307/1969884| first=E.

      "text": "{{unreferenced|date=November 2010}}\nIn [[mathematics]], '''assembly maps''' are an important concept in [[geometric topology]]. From the [[homotopy]]-theoretical viewpoint, an assembly map is a [[Universal property|universal]] approximation of a homotopy invariant [[functor]] by a [[homology theory]] from the left. From the geometric viewpoint, assembly maps correspond to 'assemble' local data over a parameter space together to get global data.\n\nAssembly maps for [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[L-theory]] play a central role in the topology of high-dimensional [[manifold]]s, since their [[homotopy fiber]]s have a direct geometric interpretation. [[Equivariant map|Equivariant]] assembly maps are used to formulate the [[Farrell–Jones conjecture]]s in K- and L-theory.\n\n==Homotopy-theoretical viewpoint==\nIt is a classical result that for any generalized [[homology theory]] <math>h_*</math> on the [[category of topological spaces]] (assumed to be homotopy equivalent to [[CW-complex]]es), there is a [[spectrum (homotopy theory)|spectrum]] <math>E</math> such that\n:<math>h_*(X)\\cong \\pi_*(X_+\\wedge E),</math>\nwhere <math>X_+:=X\\coprod \\{*\\}</math>.\n\nThe functor <math>X\\mapsto X_+ \\wedge E</math> from spaces to spectra has the following properties:\n* It is homotopy-invariant (preserves homotopy equivalences). This reflects the fact that <math>h_*</math> is homotopy-invariant.\n* It preserves homotopy co-cartesian squares. This reflects the fact that <math>h_*</math> has [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]]s, an equivalent characterization of excision.\n* It preserves arbitrary [[coproduct]]s. This reflects the disjoint-union axiom of <math>h_*</math>.\nA functor from spaces to spectra fulfilling these properties is called '''excisive'''.\n\nNow suppose that <math>F</math> is a homotopy-invariant, not necessarily excisive functor. An assembly map is a [[natural transformation]] <math>\\alpha\\colon F^\\%\\to F</math> from some excisive functor <math>F^\\%</math> to <math>F</math> such that <math>F^\\%(*)\\to F(*)</math> is a homotopy equivalence.\n\nIf we denote by <math>h_*:=\\pi_*\\circ F^\\%</math> the associated homology theory, it follows that the induced natural transformation of graded [[abelian group]]s <math>h_*\\to \\pi_*\\circ F</math> is the universal transformation from a homology theory to <math>\\pi_*\\circ F</math>, i.e. any other transformation <math>k_*\\to\\pi_*\\circ F</math> from some homology theory <math>k_*</math> factors uniquely through a transformation of homology theories <math>k_*\\to h_*</math>.\n\nAssembly maps exist for any homotopy invariant functor, by a simple homotopy-theoretical construction.\n\n==Geometric viewpoint==\nAs a consequence of the [[Mayer-Vietoris sequence]], the value of an excisive functor on a space <math>X</math> only depends on its value on 'small' subspaces of <math>X</math>, together with the knowledge how these small subspaces intersect. In a cycle representation of the associated homology theory, this means that all cycles must be representable by small cycles. For instance, for [[singular homology]], the excision property is proved by subdivision of [[simplex|simplices]], obtaining sums of small simplices representing arbitrary homology classes.\n\nIn this spirit, for certain homotopy-invariant functors which are not excisive, the corresponding excisive theory may be constructed by imposing 'control conditions', leading to the field of [[controlled topology]]. In this picture, assembly maps are 'forget-control' maps, i.e. they are induced by forgetting the control conditions.\n\n==Importance in geometric topology==\nAssembly maps are studied in geometric topology mainly for the two functors <math>L(X)</math>, algebraic [[L-theory]] of <math>X</math>, and <math>A(X)</math>, [[algebraic K-theory]] of spaces of <math>X</math>. In fact, the homotopy fibers of both assembly maps have a direct geometric interpretation when <math>X</math> is a compact topological manifold. Therefore, knowledge about the geometry of compact topological manifolds may be obtained by studying <math>K</math>- and <math>L</math>-theory and their respective assembly maps.\n\nIn the case of <math>L</math>-theory, the homotopy fiber <math>L_\\%(M)</math> of the corresponding assembly map <math> L^\\%(M)\\to L(M)</math>, evaluated at a compact topological manifold <math>M</math>, is homotopy equivalent to the space of block structures of <math>M</math>. Moreover, the fibration sequence\n:<math> L_\\%(M)\\to L^\\%(M)\\to L(M)</math>\ninduces a [[long exact sequence]] of homotopy groups which may be identified with the [[surgery exact sequence]] of <math>M</math>. This may be called the '''fundamental theorem of surgery theory''' and was developed subsequently by [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]], [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]], [[Dennis Sullivan]], [[C. T. C. Wall]], [[Frank Quinn (mathematician)|Frank Quinn]], and [[Andrew Ranicki]].\n\nFor <math>A</math>-theory, the homotopy fiber <math>A_\\%(M)</math> of the corresponding assembly map is homotopy equivalent to the space of stable [[h-cobordism]]s on <math>M</math>. This fact is called the '''stable parametrized h-cobordism theorem''', proven by Waldhausen-Jahren-Rognes. It may be viewed as a parametrized version of the classical theorem which states that equivalence classes of h-cobordisms on <math>M</math> are in 1-to-1 correspondence with elements in the [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]] of <math>\\pi_1(M)</math>.\n\n[[Category:Surgery theory]]\n[[Category:K-theory]]"

It is a [[Rigidity (mathematics)|rigidity]] conjecture, demanding that a weak, algebraic notion of equivalence (namely, a [[homotopy|homotopy equivalence]]) imply a stronger, topological notion (namely, a homeomorphism).\n\nThere is a different Borel conjecture (named for [[Émile Borel]]) in set theory.  It asserts that every [[strong measure zero set]] of reals is countable.  Work of [[Nikolai Luzin]] and [[Richard Laver]] shows that this conjecture is independent of the [[ZFC]] axioms. This article is about the Borel conjecture in geometric topology.\n\n==Precise formulation of the conjecture==\nLet <math>M</math> and <math>N</math> be [[closed manifold|closed]] and [[Aspherical space|aspherical]] topological [[manifold]]s, and let\n\n:<math>f : M \\to N</math>\n\nbe a [[homotopy|homotopy equivalence]].  The '''Borel conjecture''' states that the map <math>f</math> is homotopic to a [[homeomorphism]].  Since aspherical manifolds with isomorphic fundamental groups are homotopy equivalent, the Borel conjecture implies that aspherical closed manifolds are determined, up to homeomorphism, by their fundamental groups.\n\nThis conjecture is false if [[topological manifold]]s and homeomorphisms are replaced by [[smooth manifold]]s and [[diffeomorphism]]s; counterexamples can be constructed by taking a [[connected sum]] with an [[exotic sphere]].\n\n==The origin of the conjecture==\nIn a May 1953 letter to [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (web reference below), [[Armand Borel]] asked the question whether two aspherical manifolds with isomorphic fundamental groups are homeomorphic.\n\n==Motivation for the conjecture==\nA basic question is the following: if two closed manifolds are homotopy equivalent, are they homeomorphic?  This is not true in general: there are homotopy equivalent [[lens space]]s which are not homeomorphic.\n\nNevertheless, there are classes of manifolds for which homotopy equivalences between them can be homotoped to homeomorphisms.  For instance, the [[Mostow rigidity theorem]] states that a homotopy equivalence between closed [[hyperbolic manifold]]s is homotopic to an [[isometry]]—in particular, to a homeomorphism.  The Borel conjecture is a topological reformulation of Mostow rigidity, weakening the hypothesis from hyperbolic manifolds to aspherical manifolds, and similarly weakening the conclusion from an isometry to a homeomorphism.\n\n==Relationship to other conjectures==\n* The Borel conjecture implies the [[Novikov conjecture]] for the special case in which the reference map <math>f : M \\to BG</math> is a homotopy equivalence.\n* The [[Poincaré conjecture]] asserts that a closed manifold homotopy equivalent to <math>S^3</math>, the [[3-sphere]], is homeomorphic to <math>S^3</math>.  This is not a special case of the Borel conjecture, because <math>S^3</math> is not aspherical.  Nevertheless, the Borel conjecture for the [[Torus|3-torus]] <math>T^3 = S^1 \\times S^1 \\times S^1</math> implies the Poincaré conjecture for <math>S^3</math>.\n\n==References==\n* [[F.

      "text": "[[File:Cobordism.svg|thumb|A cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'').]]\nIn [[mathematics]], '''cobordism''' is a fundamental  [[equivalence relation]] on the class of [[compact space|compact]] [[manifold]]s of the same dimension, set up using the concept of the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] (French ''[[wikt:bord#French|bord]]'', giving ''cobordism'') of a manifold. Two manifolds of the same dimension are ''cobordant'' if their [[disjoint union]] is the ''boundary'' of a compact manifold one dimension higher.\n\nThe boundary of an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional [[manifold]] ''W'' is an ''n''-dimensional manifold ∂''W'' that is closed, i.e., with empty boundary. In general, a closed manifold need not be a boundary: cobordism theory is the study of the difference between all closed manifolds and those that are boundaries. The theory was originally developed by [[René Thom]] for [[smooth manifold]]s (i.e., differentiable), but there are now also versions for\n[[Piecewise_linear_manifold|piecewise linear]] and [[Topological_manifold|topological manifolds]].\n\nA ''cobordism'' between manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' is a compact manifold ''W'' whose boundary is the disjoint union of ''M'' and ''N'', <math>\\partial W=M \\sqcup N</math>.\n\nCobordisms are studied both for the equivalence relation that they generate, and as objects in their own right. Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than [[diffeomorphism]] or [[homeomorphism]] of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to [[diffeomorphism]] or [[homeomorphism]] in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the [[word problem for groups]] cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism. Cobordisms are central objects of study in [[geometric topology]] and [[algebraic topology]]. In geometric topology, cobordisms are [[#Connection with Morse theory|intimately connected]] with [[Morse theory]], and [[h-cobordism|''h''-cobordisms]] are fundamental in the study of high-dimensional manifolds, namely [[surgery theory]]. In algebraic topology, cobordism theories are fundamental [[extraordinary cohomology theories]], and [[#Categories of cobordisms|categories of cobordisms]] are the domains of [[topological quantum field theory|topological quantum field theories]].\n\n== Definition ==\n===Manifolds===\nRoughly speaking, an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold (mathematics)|manifold]] ''M'' is a [[topological space]] [[neighborhood (mathematics)|locally]] (i.e., near each point) [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to an open subset of [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\R^n.</math> A [[manifold with boundary]] is similar, except that a point of ''M'' is allowed to have a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to an open subset of the [[Half-space (geometry)|half-space]]\n\n:<math>\\{(x_1,\\ldots,x_n) \\in \\R^n \\mid x_n \\geqslant 0\\}.</math>\n\nThose points without a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space are the boundary points of  <math>M</math>; the boundary of <math>M</math> is denoted by <math>\\partial M</math>.  Finally, a [[closed manifold]] is, by definition, a [[compact space|compact]] manifold without boundary (<math>\\partial M=\\emptyset</math>.)\n\n===Cobordisms===\nAn <math>(n+1)</math>-dimensional ''cobordism'' is a [[quintuple]] <math>(W; M, N, i, j)</math> consisting of an <math>(n+1)</math>-dimensional compact differentiable manifold with boundary, <math>W</math>; closed  <math>n</math>-manifolds  <math>M</math>, <math>N</math>; and [[embedding]]s <math>i\\colon M \\subset \\partial W</math>, <math>j\\colon N \\subset\\partial W</math> with disjoint images such that\n\n:<math>\\partial W = i(M) \\sqcup j(N)~.</math>\n\nThe terminology is usually abbreviated to <math>(W; M, N)</math>.<ref>The notation \"<math>(n+1)</math>-dimensional\" is to clarify the dimension of all manifolds in question, otherwise it is unclear whether a \"5-dimensional cobordism\" refers to a 5-dimensional cobordism between 4-dimensional manifolds or a 6-dimensional cobordism between 5-dimensional manifolds.</ref> ''M'' and ''N'' are called ''cobordant'' if such a cobordism exists. All manifolds cobordant to a fixed given manifold ''M'' form the ''cobordism class'' of&nbsp;''M''.\n\nEvery closed manifold ''M'' is the boundary of the non-compact manifold ''M''&nbsp;×&nbsp;[0,&nbsp;1); for this reason we require ''W'' to be compact in the definition of cobordism. Note however that ''W'' is ''not'' required to be connected; as a consequence, if ''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;∂''W''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;∂''W''<sub>2</sub>, then ''M'' and ''N'' are cobordant.\n\n===Examples===\nThe simplest example of a cobordism is the [[unit interval]] ''I'' = [0, 1]. It is a 1-dimensional cobordism between the 0-dimensional manifolds {0}, {1}. More generally, for any closed manifold ''M'', (''M'' × ''I''; {0}, {1}) is a cobordism from ''M'' × {0} to ''M'' × {1}.\n\n[[File:Pair of pants cobordism (pantslike).svg|thumb|right| A cobordism between a single circle (at the top) and a pair of disjoint circles (at the bottom).]]\n\nIf ''M'' consists of a [[circle]], and ''N'' of two circles, ''M'' and ''N'' together make up the boundary of a [[pair of pants (mathematics)|pair of pants]] ''W'' (see the figure at right). Thus the pair of pants is a cobordism between ''M'' and ''N''. A simpler cobordism between ''M'' and ''N'' is given by the disjoint union of three disks.\n\nThe pair of pants is an example of a more general cobordism: for any two ''n''-dimensional manifolds ''M'', ''M''′, the disjoint union <math>M \\sqcup M'</math> is cobordant to the [[connected sum]] <math>M\\#M'.</math> The previous example is a particular case, since the connected sum <math>\\mathbb{S}^1\\#\\mathbb{S}^1</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{S}^1.</math> The connected sum <math>M\\#M'</math> is obtained from the disjoint union <math>M \\sqcup M'</math> by surgery on an embedding of <math>\\mathbb{S}^0 \\times \\mathbb{D}^n</math> in <math>M \\sqcup M'</math>, and the cobordism is the trace of the surgery.\n\n===Terminology===\nAn ''n''-manifold ''M'' is called ''null-cobordant'' if there is a cobordism between ''M'' and the empty manifold; in other words, if ''M'' is the entire boundary of some (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-manifold. For example, the circle is null-cobordant since it bounds a disk. More generally, a ''n''-sphere is null-cobordant since it bounds a (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-disk. Also, every orientable surface is null-cobordant, because it is the boundary of a [[handlebody]]. On the other hand, the 2''n''-dimensional [[real projective space]] <math>\\mathbb{P}^{2n}(\\R)</math> is a (compact) closed manifold that is not the boundary of a manifold, as is explained below.\n\nThe general ''bordism problem'' is to calculate the cobordism classes of manifolds subject to various conditions.\n\nNull-cobordisms with additional structure are called [[Symplectic filling|fillings]]. \"Bordism\" and \"cobordism\" are used by some authors interchangeably; others distinguish them. When one wishes to distinguish the study of cobordism classes from the study of cobordisms as objects in their own right, one calls the equivalence question \"bordism of manifolds\", and the study of cobordisms as objects \"cobordisms of manifolds\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe term \"bordism\" comes from French {{lang|fr|[[wikt:bord|bord]]}}, meaning boundary. Hence bordism is the study of boundaries. \"Cobordism\" means \"jointly bound\", so ''M'' and ''N'' are cobordant if they jointly bound a manifold, i.e., if their disjoint union is a boundary. Further, cobordism groups form an extraordinary ''cohomology theory'', hence the co-.\n\n===Variants===\nThe above is the most basic form of the definition. It is also referred to as unoriented bordism. In many situations, the manifolds in question are [[orientability|oriented]], or carry some other additional structure referred to as [[G-structure]]. This gives rise to [[#Oriented cobordism|\"oriented cobordism\"]] and \"cobordism with G-structure\", respectively. Under favourable technical conditions these form a [[graded ring]] called the '''cobordism ring''' <math>\\Omega^G_*</math>, with grading by dimension, addition by disjoint union and multiplication by [[cartesian product]]. The cobordism groups <math>\\Omega^G_*</math> are the coefficient groups of a [[#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory|generalised homology theory]].\n\nWhen there is additional structure, the notion of cobordism must be formulated more precisely: a ''G''-structure on ''W'' restricts to a ''G''-structure on ''M'' and ''N''. The basic examples are ''G'' = O for unoriented cobordism, ''G'' = SO for oriented cobordism, and ''G'' = U for [[complex cobordism]] using ''stably'' [[complex manifold]]s. Many more are detailed by [[Robert Evert Stong|Robert E. Stong]].<ref>{{Cite book | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | last = Stong | first = Robert E. | authorlink=Robert Evert Stong|title=Notes on cobordism theory |location=Princeton, NJ|  year = 1968 }}</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein, a standard tool in [[surgery theory]] is surgery on [[normal invariants|normal maps]]: such a process changes a normal map to another normal map within the same [[bordism]] class.\n\nInstead of considering additional structure, it is also possible to take into account various notions of manifold, especially [[Piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear (PL)]] and [[topological manifold]]s. This gives rise to bordism groups <math>\\Omega_*^{PL}(X), \\Omega_*^{TOP}(X)</math>, which are harder to compute than the differentiable variants.{{citation-needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Surgery construction==\nRecall that in general, if ''X'', ''Y'' are manifolds with boundary, then the boundary of the product manifold is ∂(''X'' × ''Y'') = (∂''X'' × ''Y'') ∪ (''X'' × ∂''Y'').\n\nNow, given a manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'' and an [[embedding]] <math>\\varphi : \\mathbb{S}^p \\times \\mathbb{D}^q \\subset M,</math> define the ''n''-manifold\n\n:<math>N := (M-\\operatorname{int~im}\\varphi)\\cup_{\\varphi|_{\\mathbb{S}^p\\times \\mathbb{S}^{q-1}}} (\\mathbb{D}^{p+1}\\times \\mathbb{S}^{q-1})</math>\n\nobtained by [[Surgery theory|surgery]], via cutting out the interior of <math>\\mathbb{S}^p \\times \\mathbb{D}^q</math> and gluing in <math>\\mathbb{D}^{p+1} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{q-1}</math> along their boundary\n\n:<math>\\partial \\left (\\mathbb{S}^p \\times \\mathbb{D}^q \\right) = \\mathbb{S}^p \\times \\mathbb{S}^{q-1} = \\partial \\left ( \\mathbb{D}^{p+1} \\times \\mathbb{S}^{q-1} \\right ).</math>\n\nThe '''trace''' of the surgery\n\n:<math> W := (M\\times I) \\cup_{\\mathbb{S}^p\\times \\mathbb{D}^q\\times \\{1\\}} (\\mathbb{D}^{p+1}\\times \\mathbb{D}^q)</math>\n\ndefines an '''elementary''' cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'').

If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the [[torus]] <math>\\mathbb{S}^1 \\times \\mathbb{S}^1</math> but if they are different, we obtain the [[Klein bottle]] (Fig. 2c).\n\n==Morse functions==\nSuppose that ''f'' is a [[Morse function]] on an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold, and suppose that ''c'' is a critical value with exactly one critical point in its preimage. If the index of this critical point is ''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, then the level-set ''N'' := ''f''<sup>−1</sup>(''c''&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε) is obtained from ''M'' := ''f''<sup>−1</sup>(''c''&nbsp;−&nbsp;ε) by a ''p''-surgery. The inverse image ''W'' := ''f''<sup>−1</sup>([''c''&nbsp;−&nbsp;ε, ''c''&nbsp;+&nbsp;ε]) defines a cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') that can be identified with the trace of this surgery.\n\n===Geometry, and the connection with Morse theory and handlebodies===\nGiven a cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') there exists a smooth function ''f'' : ''W'' → [0, 1] such that ''f''<sup>−1</sup>(0) = ''M'', ''f''<sup>−1</sup>(1) = ''N''.  By general position, one can assume ''f'' is Morse and such that all critical points occur in the interior of ''W''. In this setting ''f'' is called a Morse function on a cobordism. The cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') is a union of the traces of a sequence of surgeries on ''M'', one for each critical point of ''f''. The manifold ''W'' is obtained from ''M'' × [0, 1] by attaching one [[handle decomposition|handle]] for each critical point of ''f''.\n\n[[File:Cobordism.svg|thumb|The 3-dimensional cobordism <math>W = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times \\mathbb{D}^2 - \\mathbb{D}^3</math> between the 2-[[sphere]] <math>M = \\mathbb{S}^2</math>  and the 2-[[torus]] <math>N = \\mathbb{S}^1 \\times \\mathbb{S}^1,</math> with ''N'' obtained from ''M'' by surgery on <math>\\mathbb{S}^0 \\times \\mathbb{D}^2 \\subset M,</math>and ''W'' obtained from ''M'' × ''I'' by attaching a 1-handle <math>\\mathbb{D}^1 \\times \\mathbb{D}^2.</math>]]\nThe Morse/Smale theorem states that for a Morse function on a cobordism, the flowlines of ''f''′ give rise to a [[handle decomposition|handle presentation]] of the triple (''W''; ''M'', ''N''). Conversely, given a handle decomposition of a cobordism, it comes from a suitable Morse function. In a suitably normalized setting this process gives a correspondence between handle decompositions and Morse functions on a cobordism.\n\n==History==\nCobordism had its roots in the (failed) attempt by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1895 to define [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] purely in terms of manifolds {{harv|Dieudonné|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=m_X11mZaLocC&pg=PA290 p. 289]}}. Poincaré simultaneously defined both homology and cobordism, which are not the same, in general. See [[#Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory|Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory]] for the relationship between bordism and homology.\n\nBordism was explicitly introduced by [[Lev Pontryagin]] in geometric work on manifolds. It came to prominence when [[René Thom]] showed that cobordism groups could be computed by means of [[homotopy theory]], via the [[Thom complex]] construction. Cobordism theory became part of the apparatus of [[extraordinary cohomology theory]], alongside [[K-theory]]. It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], and in the first proofs of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]].\n\nIn the 1980s the category with compact manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms played a basic role in the Atiyah–Segal axioms for [[topological quantum field theory]], which is an important part of [[quantum topology]].\n\n==Categorical aspects==\nCobordisms are objects of study in their own right, apart from cobordism classes. Cobordisms form a [[category (mathematics)|category]] whose objects are closed manifolds and whose morphisms are cobordisms. Roughly speaking, composition is given by gluing together cobordisms end-to-end: the composition of (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') and (''W''′; ''N'', ''P'') is defined by gluing the right end of the first to the left end of the second, yielding (''W''′ ∪<sub>''N''</sub> ''W''; ''M'', ''P''). A cobordism is a kind of [[cospan]]:<ref>While every cobordism is a cospan, the category of cobordisms is ''not'' a \"cospan category\": it is not the category of all cospans in \"the category of manifolds with inclusions on the boundary\", but rather a subcategory thereof, as the requirement that ''M'' and ''N'' form a partition of the boundary of ''W'' is a global constraint.</ref> ''M'' → ''W'' ← ''N''.  The category is a [[dagger compact category]].\n\nA [[topological quantum field theory]] is a [[monoidal functor]] from a category of cobordisms to a category of [[vector space]]s. That is, it is a functor whose value on a disjoint union of manifolds is equivalent to the tensor product of its values on each of the constituent manifolds.\n\nIn low dimensions, the bordism question is relatively trivial, but the category of cobordism is not. For instance, the disk bounding the circle corresponds to a null-ary operation, while the cylinder corresponds to a 1-ary operation and the pair of pants to a binary operation.\n\n==Unoriented cobordism==\n{{details|List_of_cohomology_theories#Unoriented_cobordism}}\n\nThe set of cobordism classes of closed unoriented ''n''-dimensional manifolds is usually denoted by <math>\\mathfrak{N}_n</math> (rather than the more systematic <math>\\Omega_n^{\\text{O}}</math>); it is an [[abelian group]] with the disjoint union as operation. More specifically, if [''M''] and [''N''] denote the cobordism classes of the manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' respectively, we define <math>[M]+[N] = [M \\sqcup N]</math>; this is a well-defined operation which turns <math>\\mathfrak{N}_n</math> into an abelian group. The identity element of this group is the class <math>[\\emptyset]</math> consisting of all closed ''n''-manifolds which are boundaries.  Further we have <math>[M] + [M] = [\\emptyset]</math> for every ''M'' since <math>M\\sqcup M=\\partial (M\\times [0,1])</math>. Therefore, <math>\\mathfrak{N}_n</math> is a vector space over <math>\\mathbb{F}_2</math>, the [[GF(2)|field with two elements]]. The cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication <math>[M][N]=[M \\times N],</math> so\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{N}_*=\\bigoplus_{n \\geqslant 0}\\mathfrak{N}_n</math>\n\nis a [[graded algebra]], with the grading given by the dimension.\n\nThe cobordism class <math>[M] \\in \\mathfrak{N}_n</math> of a closed unoriented ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney [[characteristic number]]s of ''M'', which depend on the stable isomorphism class of the [[tangent bundle]]. Thus if ''M'' has a stably trivial tangent bundle then <math>[M]=0 \\in \\mathfrak{N}_n</math>. In 1954 [[René Thom]] proved\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{N}_*=\\mathbb{F}_2 \\left [x_i | i \\geqslant 1, i \\neq 2^j -1 \\right ]</math>\n\nthe polynomial algebra with one generator <math>x_i</math> in each dimension <math>i\\neq 2^j-1</math>.

This is implied by the equation\n\n:<math>\\chi_{\\partial W} = \\left  (1-(-1)^{\\dim W} \\right )\\chi_W</math>\n\nfor any compact manifold with boundary <math>W</math>.\n\nTherefore, <math>\\chi: \\mathfrak{N}_i \\to \\Z/2</math> is a well-defined group homomorphism. For example, for any <math>i_1, \\cdots, i_k \\in\\mathbb{N}</math>\n\n:<math>\\chi \\left (\\mathbb{P}^{2i_1} (\\R)\\times \\dots \\times \\mathbb{P}^{2i_k} (\\R) \\right ) = 1.</math>\n\nIn particular such a product of real projective spaces is not null-cobordant. The mod 2 Euler characteristic map <math>\\chi: \\mathfrak{N}_{2i} \\to \\Z/2</math> is onto for all <math>i \\in\\mathbb{N},</math> and a group isomorphism for <math>i=1.</math>\n\nMoreover, because of <math>\\chi(M\\times N) =\\chi(M)\\chi(N)</math>, these group homomorphism assemble into a homomorphism of graded algebras:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} \\mathfrak{N}\\to\\mathbb{F}_2[x] \\\\ {}[M] \\mapsto \\chi(M) x^{\\dim(M)}\\end{cases}</math>\n\n==Cobordism of manifolds with additional structure==\nCobordism can also be defined for manifolds that have additional structure, notably an orientation. This is made formal in a general way using the notion of ''X''-structure (or [[G-structure]]).<ref>{{Citation | last1=Switzer | first1=Robert M. | title=Algebraic topology—homotopy and homology | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Classics in Mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-42750-6 | mr=1886843  | year=2002}}, chapter 12</ref> Very briefly, the [[normal bundle]] ν of an immersion of ''M'' into a sufficiently high-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\R^{n+k}</math> gives rise to a map from ''M'' to the [[Grassmannian]], which in turn is a subspace of the [[classifying space]] of the [[orthogonal group]]: ν: ''M'' → '''Gr'''(''n'', ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''k'') → ''BO''(''k''). Given a collection of spaces and maps ''X<sub>k</sub>'' → ''X<sub>k</sub>''<sub>+1</sub> with maps ''X<sub>k</sub>'' → ''BO''(''k'') (compatible with the inclusions ''BO''(''k'') → ''BO''(''k''+1), an ''X''-structure is a lift of ν to a map <math>\\tilde \\nu: M \\to X_k</math>. Considering only manifolds and cobordisms with ''X''-structure gives rise to a more general notion of cobordism. In particular, ''X<sub>k</sub>'' may be given by ''BG''(''k''), where ''G''(''k'') → ''O''(''k'') is some group homomorphism. This is referred to as a [[G-structure]]. Examples include ''G'' = ''O'', the orthogonal group, giving back the unoriented cobordism, but also the subgroup [[special linear group|SO(''k'')]], giving rise to [[oriented cobordism]], the [[spin group]], the [[unitary group|unitary group ''U''(''k'')]], and the trivial group, giving rise to [[framed cobordism]].\n\nThe resulting cobordism groups are then defined analogously to the unoriented case. They are denoted by <math>\\Omega^G_*</math>.\n\n===Oriented cobordism===\n{{details|List_of_cohomology_theories#Oriented_cobordism}}\nOriented cobordism is the one of manifolds with an SO-structure. Equivalently, all manifolds need to be [[orientability|oriented]] and cobordisms (''W'', ''M'', ''N'') (also referred to as ''oriented cobordisms'' for clarity) are such that the boundary (with the induced orientations) is <math>M \\sqcup (-N)</math>, where −''N'' denotes ''N'' with the reversed orientation. For example, boundary of the cylinder ''M''&nbsp;×&nbsp;''I'' is <math>M \\sqcup (-M)</math>: both ends have opposite orientations. It is also the correct definition in the sense of [[extraordinary cohomology theory]].\n\nUnlike in the unoriented cobordism group, where every element is two-torsion, 2''M'' is not in general an oriented boundary, that is, 2[''M''] ≠ 0 belongs to <math>\\Omega_*^{\\text{SO}}.</math>\n\nThe oriented cobordism groups are given modulo torsion by\n\n:<math>\\Omega_*^{\\text{SO}}\\otimes \\Q =\\Q \\left [y_{4i}\\mid i \\geqslant 1 \\right ],</math>\n\nthe polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes\n\n:<math>y_{4i}=\\left [\\mathbb{P}^{2i}(\\Complex) \\right ] \\in \\Omega_{4i}^{\\text{SO}}</math>\n\nof the [[complex projective space]]s (Thom, 1952). The oriented cobordism group <math>\\Omega_*^{\\text{SO}}</math> is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin [[characteristic number]]s (Wall, 1960). Two oriented manifolds are oriented cobordant if and only if their Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin numbers are the same.\n\nThe low-dimensional oriented cobordism groups are :\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \n\\Omega_0^{\\text{SO}} &= \\Z, \\\\\n\\Omega_1^{\\text{SO}} &= 0, \\\\\n\\Omega_2^{\\text{SO}} &= 0, \\\\\n\\Omega_3^{\\text{SO}} &= 0, \\\\\n\\Omega_4^{\\text{SO}} &= \\Z, \\\\\n\\Omega_5^{\\text{SO}} &= \\Z_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe [[Signature of a manifold|signature]] of an oriented 4''i''-dimensional manifold ''M'' is defined as the signature of the intersection form on <math>H^{2i}(M) \\in \\Z</math> and is denoted by <math>\\sigma(M).</math> It is an oriented cobordism invariant, which is expressed in terms of the Pontrjagin numbers by the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]].\n\nFor example, for any ''i''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''i<sub>k</sub>'' ≥ 1\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\left (\\mathbb{P}^{2i_1}(\\Complex) \\times \\cdots \\times \\mathbb{P}^{2i_k}(\\Complex) \\right) = 1.</math>\n\nThe signature map <math>\\sigma:\\Omega_{4i}^{\\text{SO}} \\to \\Z</math> is onto for all ''i'' ≥ 1, and an isomorphism for ''i'' = 1.\n\n==Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory==\nEvery [[vector bundle]] theory (real, complex etc.) has an [[extraordinary cohomology theory]] called [[K-theory]]. Similarly, every cobordism theory Ω<sup>''G''</sup> has an [[extraordinary cohomology theory]], with homology (\"bordism\") groups <math>\\Omega^G_n(X)</math> and cohomology (\"cobordism\") groups <math>\\Omega^n_G(X)</math> for any space ''X''. The generalized homology groups <math>\\Omega_*^G(X)</math> are [[Covariance|covariant]] in ''X'', and the generalized cohomology groups <math>\\Omega^*_G(X)</math> are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] in ''X''. The cobordism groups defined above are, from this point of view, the homology groups of a point: <math>\\Omega_n^G = \\Omega_n^G(\\text{pt})</math>. Then <math>\\Omega^G_n(X)</math> is the group of ''bordism'' classes of pairs (''M'', ''f'') with ''M'' a closed ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' (with G-structure) and ''f'' : ''M'' → ''X'' a map. Such pairs (''M'', ''f''), (''N'', ''g'') are ''bordant'' if there exists a G-cobordism (''W''; ''M'', ''N'') with a map ''h'' : ''W'' → ''X'', which restricts to ''f'' on ''M'', and to ''g'' on ''N''.\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'' has a [[Homology (mathematics)|fundamental homology class]] [''M''] ∈ ''H<sub>n</sub>''(''M'') (with coefficients in <math>\\Z/2</math> in general, and in <math>\\Z</math> in the oriented case), defining a natural transformation\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\n\\Omega^G_n(X) \\to H_n(X) \\\\\n(M,f) \\mapsto f_*[M]\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich is far from being an isomorphism in general.\n\nThe bordism and cobordism theories of a space satisfy the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]] apart from the dimension axiom.  This does not mean that the groups <math>\\Omega^n_G(X)</math>  can be effectively computed once one knows the cobordism theory of a point and the homology of the space ''X'', though the [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] gives a starting point for calculations. The computation is only easy if the particular cobordism theory [[#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory|reduces to a product of ordinary homology theories]], in which case the bordism groups are the ordinary homology groups\n\n:<math>\\Omega^G_n(X)=\\sum_{p+q=n}H_p(X;\\Omega^G_q(\\text{pt})).</math>\n\nThis is true for unoriented cobordism. Other cobordism theories do not reduce to ordinary homology in this way, notably [[Pontrjagin–Thom construction#Framed cobordism|framed cobordism]], oriented cobordism  and [[complex cobordism]].  The last-named theory in particular is much used by algebraic topologists as a computational tool (e.g., for the [[homotopy groups of spheres]]).<ref>{{Cite document |first=D.C.  |last=Ravenel |title=Complex cobordism and stable homotopy groups of spheres |publisher=Academic Press |date=April 1986 |isbn=0-12-583430-6 |ref=harv |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nCobordism theories are represented by [[Thom spectrum|Thom spectra]] ''MG'': given a group ''G'', the Thom spectrum is composed from the [[Thom space]]s ''MG<sub>n</sub>'' of the [[tautological bundle|standard vector bundles]] over the [[classifying space]]s ''BG<sub>n</sub>''. Note that even for similar groups, Thom spectra can be very different: ''MSO'' and ''MO'' are very different, reflecting the difference between oriented and unoriented cobordism.\n\nFrom the point of view of spectra, unoriented cobordism is a product of [[Eilenberg–MacLane spectrum|Eilenberg–MacLane spectra]] – ''MO'' = ''H''({{pi}}<sub>∗</sub>(''MO'')) – while oriented cobordism is a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spectra rationally, and at 2, but not at odd primes: the oriented cobordism spectrum ''MSO'' is rather more complicated than ''MO''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[h-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]]\n*[[Link concordance]]\n*[[List of cohomology theories]]\n*[[Symplectic filling]]\n*[[Cobordism hypothesis]]\n*[[Cobordism ring]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[[Frank Adams|John Frank Adams]], ''Stable homotopy and generalised homology'', Univ.

      "title": "Dehn surgery",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_surgery",
      "text": "In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, a '''Dehn surgery''', named after [[Max Dehn]], is a construction used to modify [[3-manifold]]s.  The process takes as input a 3-manifold together with a [[link (knot theory)|link]].  It is often conceptualized as two steps: ''drilling'' then ''filling'' (also known as Dehn-tistry).\n\n==Definitions==\n\n* Given a [[3-manifold]] <math>M</math> and a [[link (knot theory)|link]] <math>L \\subset M</math>, the manifold ''<math>M</math> drilled along <math>L</math>'' is obtained by removing an open [[tubular neighborhood]] of <math>L</math> from <math>M</math>. The manifold ''<math>M</math> drilled along <math>L</math>'' is also known as the [[link complement]], since if one removed the corresponding closed tubular neighborhood from <math>M</math>, one obtains a manifold diffeomorphic to <math>M \\setminus L</math>.\n* Given a 3-manifold with torus boundary components, we may glue in a [[solid torus]] by a [[homeomorphism]] (resp. [[diffeomorphism]]) of its boundary to the torus boundary component <math>T</math> of the original 3-manifold.  There are many inequivalent ways of doing this, in general.  This process is called '''Dehn filling'''.\n* '''Dehn surgery''' on a 3-manifold containing a link consists of drilling out a tubular neighbourhood of the link together with '''Dehn filling''' on all the components of the boundary corresponding to the link.\n\nWe can pick two oriented simple closed [[curve]]s ''m'' and ''ℓ'' on the boundary torus of the 3-manifold that generate the [[fundamental group]] of the torus.  This gives any simple closed curve <math>\\gamma</math> on that torus two coordinates ''p'' and ''q'', each coordinate corresponding to the algebraic intersection of the curve with ''m'' and ''ℓ'' respectively.  These coordinates only depend on the [[homotopy class]] of <math>\\gamma</math>.\n\nWe can specify a homeomorphism of the boundary of a solid torus to ''T'' by having the meridian curve of the solid torus map to a curve homotopic to <math>\\gamma</math>.  As long as the meridian maps to the '''surgery slope''' <math>[\\gamma]</math>, the resulting Dehn surgery will yield a 3-manifold that will not depend on the specific gluing (up to homeomorphism).  The ratio ''p''/''q'' is called the '''surgery coefficient'''.\n\nIn the case of links in the 3-sphere or more generally an oriented homology sphere, there is a canonical choice of the meridians and longitudes of ''T''.  The longitude is chosen so that it is null-homologous in the knot complement—equivalently, if it is the boundary of a [[Seifert surface]].  The meridian is the curve that bounds a disc in the tubular neighbourhood of the link. When the ratios ''p''/''q'' are all integers, the surgery is called an ''integral surgery''. Such surgeries are closely related to [[handle decomposition|handlebodies]], [[cobordism]] and [[Morse theory|Morse functions]].\n\n==Results==\n\nEvery [[closed manifold|closed]], [[orientable]], [[connected space|connected]] [[3-manifold]] is obtained by performing Dehn surgery on a link in the [[3-sphere]].   This result, the [[Lickorish–Wallace theorem]], was first proven by [[Andrew H. Wallace]] in 1960 and independently by [[W. B. R. Lickorish]] in a stronger form in 1962.  Via the now well-known relation between [[Surgery theory|genuine surgery]] and [[cobordism]], this result is equivalent to the theorem that the [[cobordism|oriented cobordism group]] of 3-manifolds is trivial, a theorem originally proved by [[Vladimir Abramovich Rokhlin]] in 1951.\n\nSince orientable 3-manifolds can all be generated by suitably decorated links, one might ask how distinct surgery presentations of a given 3-manifold might be related. The answer is called the [[Kirby calculus]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hyperbolic Dehn surgery]]\n*[[Tubular neighborhood]]\n*[[Surgery theory|Surgery]] on manifolds, in the general sense, also called spherical modification.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|first=Max|last=Dehn|authorlink=Max Dehn|title=Die Gruppe der Abbildungsklassen|journal=[[Acta Mathematica]]|volume=69|issue=1|year=1938|pages=135–206|doi=10.1007/BF02547712}}.\n*{{citation|first=René|last=Thom|authorlink=René Thom|mr=0061823| title=Quelques propriétés globales des variétés différentiables|journal= [[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici]] |volume= 28|year=  1954|pages= 17–86 |url=http://retro.seals.ch/digbib/view?did=c1:389597&sdid=c1:389960| doi=10.1007/BF02566923}}\n*{{citation|first=Rob|last=Kirby|authorlink=Robion Kirby|title=A calculus for framed links in ''S''<sup>3</sup>|journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]]|volume=45|issue=1|year=1978|pages=35–56|doi=10.1007/BF01406222|mr=467753}}.\n*{{citation|first1=Roger|last1=Fenn|first2=Colin|last2=Rourke|authorlink2=Colin P.

      "text": "In [[differential topology]], an '''exotic sphere''' is a [[differentiable manifold]] ''M'' that is [[homeomorphic]] but not [[diffeomorphic]] to the standard Euclidean [[n-sphere|''n''-sphere]]. That is, ''M'' is a sphere from the point of view of all its topological properties, but carrying a [[smooth structure]] that is not the familiar one (hence the name \"exotic\").\n\nThe first exotic spheres were constructed by {{harvs|authorlink=John Milnor|first=John|last=Milnor|year=1956|txt=yes}} in  dimension <math>n = 7</math> as <math>S^3</math>-[[Fiber bundle|bundles]] over <math>S^4</math>. He showed that there are at least 7 differentiable structures on the 7-sphere. In any dimension {{harvtxt|Milnor|1959}} showed that the diffeomorphism classes of oriented exotic spheres form the non-trivial elements of an abelian [[monoid]] under connected sum, which is a [[Finite group|finite]] [[abelian group]] if the dimension is not 4. The classification of exotic spheres by {{harvs |authorlink1=Michel Kervaire |first1=Michel |last1=Kervaire |last2=Milnor |year=1963 |txt=yes}} showed that the [[orientability|oriented]] exotic 7-spheres are the non-trivial elements of a [[cyclic group]] of order 28 under the operation of [[connected sum]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe unit ''n''-sphere, <math>S^n</math>, is the set of all [[tuple|(''n''+1)-tuples]] <math>(x_1, x_2, \\ldots x_{n+1})</math> of real numbers, such that the sum <math>x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \\cdots + x_{n+1}^2 = 1</math>. (<math>S^1</math> is a circle; <math>S^2</math> is the surface of an ordinary ball of radius one in 3 dimensions.) Topologists consider a space, ''X'', to be an ''n''-sphere if every point in ''X'' can be assigned to exactly one point in the unit ''n''-sphere in a [[continuous function|continuous]] way, which means that sufficiently nearby points in ''X'' get assigned to nearby points in ''S''<sup>n</sup> and vice versa. For example, a point ''x'' on an ''n''-sphere of radius ''r'' can be matched with a point on the unit ''n''-sphere by adjusting its distance from the origin by <math>1/r</math>.\n\nIn [[differential topology]], a more stringent condition is added, that the functions matching points in ''X'' with points in <math>S^n</math> should be [[smooth function|smooth]], that is they should have [[derivative]]s of all orders everywhere. To calculate derivatives, one needs to have local coordinate systems defined consistently in ''X''. Mathematicians were surprised in 1956 when Milnor showed that consistent coordinate systems could be set up on the 7-sphere in two different ways that were equivalent in the continuous sense, but not in the differentiable sense. Milnor and others set about trying to discover how many such exotic spheres could exist in each dimension and to understand how they relate to each other. No exotic structures are possible on the 1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, 6-, 12- or 61-spheres {{OEIS|A191783}}. Some higher-dimensional spheres have only two possible differentiable structures, others have thousands. Whether exotic 4-spheres exist, and if so how many, is an unsolved problem.\n\n==Classification==\nThe monoid of [[smooth structure]]s on ''n''-spheres is the collection of oriented smooth ''n''-manifolds which are homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere, taken up to orientation-preserving diffeomorphism.  The monoid operation is the [[connected sum]]. Provided <math>n\\ne  4</math>,  this monoid is a group and is isomorphic to the group <math>\\Theta_n</math>  of [[H-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]] classes of oriented [[homotopy sphere|homotopy ''n''-spheres]], which is finite and abelian. In dimension 4 almost nothing is known about the monoid of smooth spheres, beyond the facts that it is finite or countably infinite, and abelian, though it is suspected to be infinite; see the section on [[Exotic sphere#4-dimensional exotic spheres and Gluck twists|Gluck twist]]s. All homotopy ''n''-spheres are homeomorphic to the ''n''-sphere by the generalized [[Poincaré conjecture]], proved by [[Stephen Smale]] in dimensions bigger than 4, [[Michael Freedman]] in dimension 4, and [[Grigori Perelman]] in dimension 3. In dimension 3, [[Edwin E. Moise]] proved that every topological manifold has an essentially unique smooth structure (see [[Moise's theorem]]), so the monoid of smooth structures on the 3-sphere is trivial.\n\n=== Parallelizable manifolds===\nThe group <math>\\Theta_n</math>  has a cyclic subgroup\n\n:<math>bP_{n+1}</math>\n\nrepresented by ''n''-spheres that bound [[parallelizable manifold]]s. The structures of <math>bP_{n+1}</math> and the quotient\n\n:<math>\\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}</math>\n\nare described separately in the paper {{harvs|authorlink1=Michel Kervaire|last1=Kervaire|last2=Milnor|authorlink2=John Milnor|year=1963}}, which was influential in the development of [[surgery theory]]. In fact, these calculations can be formulated in a modern language in terms of the [[surgery exact sequence]] as indicated [[surgery exact sequence#Examples|here]].\n\nThe group <math>bP_{n+1}</math> is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case <math>n = 4k+3</math>, in which case it can be large, with its order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. It is trivial if ''n'' is even. If ''n'' is 1 mod 4 it has order 1 or 2; in particular it has order 1 if ''n'' is 1, 5,  13,  29, or 61, and {{harvs|txt|first=William|last=Browder|authorlink=William Browder (mathematician)|year=1969}} proved that it has order 2 if {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1 mod 4}} is not of the form {{nowrap|2<sup>''k''</sup> – 3}}. It follows from the now almost completely resolved [[Kervaire invariant]] problem that it has order 2 for all ''n'' bigger than 125; the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 125}} is still open.\nThe order of ''bP''<sub>4''k''</sub> for {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 2}} is\n\n:<math>2^{2k-2}(2^{2k-1}-1)B \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere ''B'' is the numerator of {{abs|4''B''<sub>2''k''</sub>/''k''}}, and ''B''<sub>2''k''</sub> is a [[Bernoulli number]]. (The formula in the topological literature differs slightly because topologists use a different convention for naming Bernoulli numbers; this article uses the number theorists' convention.)\n\n===Map between quotients===\nThe quotient group Θ<sub>''n''</sub>/''bP''<sub>''n''+1</sub> has a description in terms of [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]] modulo the image of the [[J-homomorphism]]; it is either equal to the quotient or index 2. More precisely there is an injective map\n:<math>\\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}\\to \\pi_n^S/J\\,</math>\nwhere π<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''S''</sup> is the ''n''th stable homotopy group of spheres, and ''J'' is the image of the ''J''-homomorphism. As with ''bP''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, the image of ''J'' is a cyclic group, and is trivial or order 2 except in case <math>n = 4k+3,</math> in which case it can be large, with its order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. The quotient group <math>\\pi_n^S/J\\,</math> is the \"hard\" part of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, and accordingly <math>\\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}</math> is the hard part of the exotic spheres, but almost completely reduces to computing homotopy groups of spheres. The map is either an isomorphism (the image is the whole group), or an injective map with [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2. The latter is the case if and only if there exists an ''n''-dimensional framed manifold with [[Kervaire invariant]] 1, which is known as the [[Kervaire invariant problem]]. Thus a factor of 2 in the classification of exotic spheres depends on the Kervaire invariant problem.\n\n{{as of|2012}}, the Kervaire invariant problem is almost completely solved, with only the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 126}} remaining open; see that article for details. This is primarily the work of {{harvtxt|Browder|1969}}, which proved that such manifolds only existed in dimension {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2<sup>''j''</sup> − 2}}, and {{harvtxt|Hill|Hopkins|Ravenel|2016}}, which proved that there were no such manifolds for dimension {{nowrap|1=254 = 2<sup>8</sup> − 2}} and above. Manifolds with Kervaire invariant 1 have been constructed in dimension 2, 6, 14, 30, and 62, but dimension 126 is open, with no manifold being either constructed or disproven.\n\n===Order of Θ<sub>''n''</sub>===\nThe order of the group Θ<sub>''n''</sub> is given in this table {{OEIS|id=A001676}} from {{harv|Kervaire|Milnor|1963}} (except that the entry for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 19}} is wrong by a factor of 2 in their paper; see the correction in volume III p.&nbsp;97 of Milnor's collected works).\n\n:{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

At first, I thought I'd found a counterexample to the generalized Poincaré conjecture in dimension seven. But careful study showed that the manifold really was homeomorphic to ''S''<sup>7</sup>. Thus, there exists a differentiable structure on ''S''<sup>7</sup> not diffeomorphic to the standard one.\n|source={{harvs|txt|first=John|last=Milnor|year=2009|loc=p.12}}\n}}\n\nOne of the first examples of an exotic sphere found by {{harvtxt|Milnor|1956|loc=section 3}} was the following:  Take two copies of [[Ball (mathematics)|''B''<sup>4</sup>]]×''S''<sup>3</sup>, each with [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]] ''S''<sup>3</sup>×''S''<sup>3</sup>, and glue them together by identifying (''a'',''b'') in the boundary with (''a'', ''a''<sup>2</sup>''ba''<sup>&minus;1</sup>), (where we identify each ''S''<sup>3</sup> with the group of unit [[quaternion]]s). The resulting manifold has a natural smooth structure and is homeomorphic to ''S''<sup>7</sup>, but is not diffeomorphic to ''S''<sup>7</sup>. Milnor showed that it is not the boundary of any smooth 8-manifold with vanishing 4th Betti number, and has no orientation-reversing diffeomorphism to itself; either of these properties implies that it is not a standard 7-sphere. Milnor showed that this manifold has a [[Morse function]] with just two [[critical point (mathematics)|critical points]], both non-degenerate, which implies that it is topologically a sphere.\n\nAs shown by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=Egbert |last=Brieskorn|year=1966|year2=1966b}} (see also {{harv|Hirzebruch|Mayer|1968}}) the intersection of the [[complex manifold]] of points in '''C'''<sup>5</sup> satisfying\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^3 + e^{6k-1} = 0\\ </math>\nwith a small sphere around the origin for ''k'' = 1, 2, ..., 28 gives all 28 possible smooth structures on the oriented 7-sphere. Similar manifolds are called [[Brieskorn sphere]]s.\n\n==Twisted spheres==\nGiven an (orientation-preserving) diffeomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''S''<sup>''n''−1</sup> → ''S''<sup>''n''−1</sup>}}, gluing the boundaries of two copies of the standard disk ''D''<sup>''n''</sup> together by ''f'' yields a manifold called a ''twisted sphere'' (with ''twist'' ''f''). It is homotopy equivalent to the standard ''n''-sphere because the gluing map is homotopic to the identity (being an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism, hence degree 1), but not in general diffeomorphic to the standard sphere. {{harv|Milnor|1959b}}\nSetting <math>\\Gamma_n</math> to be the group of twisted ''n''-spheres (under connect sum), one obtains the exact sequence\n:<math>\\pi_0\\operatorname{Diff}^+(D^n) \\to \\pi_0\\operatorname{Diff}^+(S^{n-1}) \\to \\Gamma_n \\to 0.</math>\n\nFor {{nowrap|''n'' &gt; 5}}, every exotic ''n''-sphere is diffeomorphic to a twisted sphere, a result proven by [[Stephen Smale]] which can be seen as a consequence of the [[H-cobordism#Precise statement of the h-cobordism theorem|''h''-cobordism theorem]]. (In contrast, in the [[Piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]] setting the left-most map is onto via [[Alexander Trick#Radial extension|radial extension]]: every piecewise-linear-twisted sphere is standard.) The group Γ<sub>''n''</sub> of twisted spheres is always isomorphic to the group Θ<sub>''n''</sub>. The notations are different because it was not known at first that they were the same for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3 or 4}}; for example, the case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} is equivalent to the [[Poincaré conjecture]].\n\nIn 1970 Jean Cerf proved the [[pseudoisotopy theorem]] which implies that <math>\\pi_0 \\operatorname{Diff}^+(D^n)</math> is the trivial group provided <math>n \\geq 6</math>, so <math>\\Gamma_n \\simeq \\pi_0 \\operatorname{Diff}^+(S^{n-1})</math> provided <math>n \\geq 6</math>.\n\n==Applications==\nIf ''M'' is a [[piecewise linear manifold]] then the problem of finding the compatible smooth structures on ''M'' depends on knowledge of the groups {{nowrap|1=Γ<sub>''k''</sub> = Θ<sub>''k''</sub>}}.

The statement that they do not exist is known as the \"smooth Poincaré conjecture\", and is discussed by {{harvs|txt | last1=Freedman | first1=Michael | authorlink1=Michael Freedman| last2=Gompf | first2=Robert | authorlink2=Robert Gompf| last3=Morrison | first3=Scott | last4=Walker | first4=Kevin | year=2010}} who say that it is believed to be false.\n\nSome candidates proposed for exotic 4-spheres are the Cappell–Shaneson spheres ({{harvs|txt|last1=Cappell|first1=Sylvain|authorlink1=Sylvain Cappell|last2=Shaneson|first2=Julius|authorlink2=Julius Shaneson|year=1976}}) and those derived by '''Gluck twists''' {{harv|Gluck|1962}}. Gluck twist spheres are constructed by cutting out a tubular neighborhood of a 2-sphere ''S'' in ''S''<sup>4</sup> and gluing it back in using a diffeomorphism of its boundary ''S''<sup>2</sup>×''S''<sup>1</sup>.

Thomas Farrell]] and [[Lowell Edwin Jones]] states that certain [[assembly map]]s are [[isomorphism]]s. These maps are given as certain [[homomorphism]]s.\n\nThe motivation is the interest in the target of the assembly maps; this may be, for instance, the [[algebraic K-theory]] of a [[group ring]]\n\n:<math>K_n(RG)</math>\n\nor the [[L-theory]] of a group ring\n\n:<math>L_n(RG)</math>,\n\nwhere ''G'' is some [[group (mathematics)|group]].\n\nThe sources of the assembly maps are [[equivariant homology theory]] evaluated on the [[classifying space]] of ''G'' with respect to the family of [[virtually cyclic group|virtually cyclic subgroup]]s of ''G''. So assuming the Farrell–Jones conjecture is true, it is possible to restrict computations to virtually cyclic subgroups to get information on complicated objects such as <math>K_n(RG)</math> or <math>L_n(RG)</math>.\n\nThe [[Baum–Connes conjecture]] formulates a similar statement, for the [[topological K-theory]] of reduced group <math>C^*</math>-algebras <math>K^ {top}_n(C^r_*(G))</math>.\n\n==Formulation==\n\nOne can find for any ring <math> R</math> [[Equivariant cohomology|equivariant homology theories]] <math>KR^?_*,LR^?_*</math> satisfying\n\n: <math>KR_n^G(\\{\\cdot\\})\\cong K_n(R[G])</math> respectively <math>LR_n^G(\\{\\cdot\\})\\cong L_n(R[G]).</math>\n\nHere <math>R[G]</math> denotes the [[group ring]].\n\nThe K-theoretic Farrell–Jones conjecture for a group ''G'' states that the map <math>p:E_{VCYC}(G)\\rightarrow \\{\\cdot\\}</math> induces an isomorphism on homology\n\n:<math>KR_*^G(p):KR_*^G(E_{VCYC}(G))\\rightarrow KR_*^G(\\{\\cdot\\})\\cong K_*(R[G]).</math>\n\nHere <math>E_{VCYC}(G)</math> denotes the [[classifying spaces for families|classifying space]] of the group ''G'' with respect to the family of virtually cyclic subgroups, i.e. a ''G''-CW-complex whose [[isotropy group]]s are virtually cyclic and for any virtually cyclic subgroup of ''G'' the [[fixed point set]] is [[contractible]].\n\nThe L-theoretic Farrell–Jones conjecture is analogous.\n\n== Computational aspects ==\nThe computation of the algebraic K-groups and the L-groups of a group ring <math>R[G]</math> is motivated by obstructions living in those groups (see for example [[Wall's finiteness obstruction]], [[surgery obstruction]], [[Whitehead torsion]]). So suppose a group <math>G</math> satisfies the Farrell–Jones conjecture for algebraic K-theory. Suppose furthermore we have already found a model <math>X</math> for the classifying space for virtually cyclic subgroups:\n\n: <math> \\emptyset=X^{-1}\\subset X^0\\subset X^1\\subset \\ldots \\subset X </math>\n\nChoose <math>G</math>-pushouts and apply the Mayer-Vietoris sequence to them:\n\n: <math> KR_n^G(\\coprod_{j\\in I_i} G/H_j\\times S^{i-1})\\rightarrow KR_n^G(\\coprod_{j\\in I_i} G/H_j\\times D^i)\\oplus KR_n^G(X^{i-1})\\rightarrow KR_n^G(X^i) </math><math>\\rightarrow KR_{n-1}^G(\\coprod_{j\\in I_i} G/H_j\\times S^{i-1})\\rightarrow KR_{n-1}^G(\\coprod_{j\\in I_i} G/H_j\\times D^i)\\oplus KR_{n-1}^G(X^{i-1}) </math>\n\nThis sequence simplifies to:\n\n: <math> \\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i}K_n(R[H_j])\\oplus \\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i} K_{n-1}(RH_j)\\rightarrow \\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i} K_n(RH_j)\\oplus KR_n^G(X^{i-1})\\rightarrow KR_n^G(X^i) </math><math>\\rightarrow \\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i}K_{n-1}(RH_j)\\oplus\\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i}K_{n-2}(RH_j)\\rightarrow \\bigoplus_{j\\in I_i} K_{n-1}(RH_j)\\oplus KR^G_{n-1}(X^{i-1}) </math>\n\nThis means that if any group satisfies a certain isomorphism conjecture one can compute its algebraic K-theory (L-theory) only by knowing the algebraic K-Theory (L-Theory) of virtually cyclic groups and by knowing a suitable model for <math> E_{VCYC}(G)</math>.\n\n===Why the family of virtually cyclic subgroups ? ===\nOne might also try to take for example the family of finite subgroups into account. This family is much easier to handle. Consider the infinite cyclic group <math> \\Z </math>. A model for <math>E_{FIN}(\\Z)</math> is given by the real line <math>\\R</math>, on which <math>\\Z</math> acts freely by translations. Using the properties of equivariant K-theory we get\n\n: <math>K_n^\\Z(\\R)=K_n(S^1)=K_n(pt)\\oplus K_{n-1}(pt)=K_n(R)\\oplus K_{n-1}(R).</math>\n\nThe [[Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition]] gives\n\n: <math>K_n^\\Z(pt)=K_n(R[\\Z])\\cong K_n(R)\\oplus K_{n-1}(R)\\oplus NK_n(R)\\oplus NK_n(R).</math>\n\nIndeed one checks that the assembly map is given by the canonical inclusion.\n\n: <math>K_n(R)\\oplus K_{n-1}(R)\\hookrightarrow K_n(R)\\oplus K_{n-1}(R)\\oplus NK_n(R)\\oplus NK_n(R)</math>\n\nSo it is an isomorphism if and only if <math>NK_n(R) =0</math>, which is the case if <math>R</math> is a [[regular ring]]. So in this case one can really use the family of finite subgroups. On the other hand this shows that the isomorphism conjecture for algebraic K-Theory and the family of finite subgroups is not true. One has to extend the conjecture to a larger family of subgroups which contains all the counterexamples. Currently no counterexamples for the Farrell–Jones conjecture are known. If there is a counterexample, one has to enlarge the family of subgroups to a larger family which contains that counterexample.\n\n== Inheritances of isomorphism conjectures ==\nThe class of groups which satisfies the fibered Farrell–Jones conjecture contain the following groups\n\n* virtually cyclic groups (definition)\n* hyperbolic groups (see <ref>{{cite arxiv | last1=Bartels | first1=Arthur | authorlink=Arthur Bartels | last2=Lück | first2 = Wolfgang | authorlink2=Wolfgang Lück| last3=Reich | first3=Holger| eprint=math/0609685 | title=The K-theoretic Farrell-Jones Conjecture for hyperbolic groups |mode=cs2| year=2006 }}</ref>)\n* CAT(0)-groups (see <ref>{{Citation | last1=Bartels | first1=Arthur | last2=Lück | first2 = Wolfgang |authorlink2=Wolfgang Lück| last3=Reich | first3=Holger| eprint=0901.0442 | title=The Borel Conjecture for hyperbolic and CAT(0)-groups | year= 2009 |mode=cs2}}</ref>)\n* solvable groups (see <ref>{{Citation | last1=Wegner | first1=Christian | arxiv=1308.2432 | title=The Farrell-Jones Conjecture for virtually solvable groups | year= 2013| bibcode=2013arXiv1308.2432W }}</ref>)\n* mapping class groups (see <ref>{{cite arxiv | last1=Bartels | first1=Arthur | last2=Bestvina | first2 = Mladen| authorlink2=Mladen Bestvina| eprint=1606.02844 | title=The Farrell-Jones Conjecture for mapping class groups | year= 2016 |mode=cs2| class=math.GT }}</ref>)\n\nFurthermore the class has the following inheritance properties:\n\n* Closed under finite products of groups.\n* Closed under taking subgroups.\n\n== Meta-conjecture and fibered isomorphism conjectures ==\n\nFix an equivariant homology theory <math>H^?_*</math>. One could say, that a group '' G'' satisfies the isomorphism conjecture for a family of subgroups<math> F</math>, if and only if the map induced by the projection <math> E_F(G)\\rightarrow \\{\\cdot\\} </math> induces an isomorphism on homology:\n\n: <math> H_*^G(E_F(G))\\rightarrow H_*^G(\\{\\cdot\\}) </math>\n\nThe group ''G'' satisfies the fibered isomorphism conjecture for the family of subgroups ''F'' if and only if for any group homomorphism <math> \\alpha :H\\rightarrow G</math> the group ''H'' satisfies the isomorphism conjecture for the family\n\n: <math>\\alpha^*F:=\\{H'\\le H|\\alpha(H)\\in F\\}</math>.\n\nOne gets immediately that in this situation <math>H</math> also satisfies the fibered isomorphism conjecture for the family <math>\\alpha^*F</math>.\n\n===Transitivity principle===\n\nThe transitivity principle is a tool to change the family of subgroups to consider. Given two families <math>F\\subset F'</math> of subgroups of <math> G</math>. Suppose every group <math> H\\in F'</math> satisfies the (fibered) isomorphism conjecture with respect to the family <math> F|_H:=\\{H'\\in F|H'\\subset H\\}</math>.\nThen the group <math>G</math> satisfies the fibered isomorphism conjecture with respect to the family <math>F</math> if and only if it satisfies the (fibered) isomorphism conjecture with respect to the family <math>F'</math>.\n\n===Isomorphism conjectures and group homomorphisms===\n\nGiven any group homomorphism <math>\\alpha\\colon H\\rightarrow G</math> and suppose that ''G\"' satisfies the fibered isomorphism conjecture for a family ''F'' of subgroups. Then also ''H\"' satisfies the fibered isomorphism conjecture for the family <math> \\alpha^*F</math>.

      "text": "{{lowercase}}\nIn [[geometric topology]] and [[differential topology]], an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional [[cobordism]] ''W'' between ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]]s ''M'' and ''N'' is an '''''h''-cobordism''' (the ''h'' stands for [[homotopy equivalence]]) if the inclusion maps\n\n: <math> M \\hookrightarrow W \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad N \\hookrightarrow W</math>\n\nare homotopy equivalences.\n\nThe '''''h''-cobordism theorem''' gives sufficient conditions for an ''h''-cobordism to be trivial, i.e., to be '''C'''-isomorphic to the cylinder ''M'' × [0, 1]. Here '''C''' refers to any of the categories of '''[[smooth manifold|smooth]]''', '''[[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]]''', or '''[[topological manifold|topological]]''' manifolds.\n\nThe theorem was first proved by [[Stephen Smale]] for which he received the [[Fields Medal]] and is a fundamental result in the theory of high-dimensional manifolds. For a start, it almost immediately proves the [[Generalized Poincaré Conjecture]].\n\n==Background==\nBefore Smale proved this theorem, mathematicians became stuck while trying to understand manifolds of dimension 3 or 4, and assumed that the higher-dimensional cases were even harder. The ''h''-cobordism theorem showed that (simply connected) manifolds of dimension at least 5 are much easier than those of dimension 3 or 4. The proof of the theorem depends on the \"[[Whitney embedding theorem|Whitney trick]]\" of [[Hassler Whitney]], which geometrically untangles homologically-tangled spheres of complementary dimension in a manifold of dimension >4. An informal reason why manifolds of dimension 3 or 4 are unusually hard is that [[4-manifold#Failure of the Whitney trick in dimension 4|the trick fails to work]] in lower dimensions, which have no room for untanglement.\n\n==Precise statement of the ''h''-cobordism theorem==\n\nLet ''n'' be at least 5 and let ''W'' be a compact (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional ''h''-cobordism between ''M'' and ''N'' in the category '''C'''='''[[smooth manifold|Diff]]''', '''[[piecewise linear manifold|PL]]''', or '''[[topological manifold|Top]]''' such that ''W'', ''M'' and ''N'' are [[simply connected]], then ''W'' is '''C'''-isomorphic to ''M'' × [0, 1]. The isomorphism can be chosen to be the identity on ''M'' × {0}.\n\nThis means that the homotopy equivalence between M, W, and N is homotopic to a '''C'''-isomorphism.\n\n==Lower dimensional versions==\nFor ''n'' = 4, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is true topologically (proved by [[Michael Freedman]] using a 4-dimensional Whitney trick) but is false PL and smoothly (as shown by [[Simon Donaldson]]).\n\nFor ''n'' = 3, the ''h''-cobordism theorem for smooth manifolds has not been proved and, due to the 3-dimensional [[Poincaré conjecture]], is equivalent to the hard open question of whether the 4-sphere has non-standard [[smooth structure]]s.\n\nFor ''n'' = 2, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is equivalent to the [[Poincaré conjecture]] stated by [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] in 1904 (one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems|Millennium Problems]]<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems|title = Millennium Problems {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute|website = www.claymath.org|access-date = 2016-03-30}}</ref>) and was proved by [[Grigori Perelman]] in a series of three papers in 2002 and 2003,<ref>{{Cite arxiv |last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2002-11-11|title = The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications  |arxiv = math/0211159}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2003-03-10|title = Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds |arxiv = math/0303109}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arxiv|last = Perelman|first = Grisha|date = 2003-07-17|title = Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds |arxiv = math/0307245}}</ref> where he follows [[Richard S. Hamilton]]'s program using [[Ricci flow]].\n\nFor ''n'' = 1, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is vacuously true, since there is no closed simply-connected 1-dimensional manifold.\n\nFor ''n'' = 0, the ''h''-cobordism theorem is trivially true: the interval is the only connected cobordism between connected 0-manifolds.\n\n==A proof sketch==\nA [[Cobordism#Morse functions|Morse function]] <math>f:W\\to[a,b]</math> induces a [[handle decomposition]] of ''W'', i.e., if there is a single critical point of index ''k'' in <math>f^{-1}([c,c'])</math>, then the ascending cobordism <math>W_{c'}</math> is obtained from <math>W_c</math> by attaching a ''k''-handle. The goal of the proof is to find a handle decomposition with no handles at all so that integrating the non-zero gradient vector field of ''f'' gives the desired diffeomorphism to the trivial cobordism.\n\nThis is achieved through a series of techniques.\n\n'''1) Handle rearrangement'''\n\nFirst, we want to rearrange all handles by order so that lower order handles are attached first. The question is thus when can we slide an ''i''-handle off of a ''j''-handle? This can be done by a radial isotopy so long as the ''i'' attaching sphere and the ''j'' belt sphere do not intersect. We thus want <math>(i-1)+(n-j)\\leq\\dim\\partial W-1=n-1</math> which is equivalent to <math>i\\leq j</math>.\n\nWe then define the handle chain complex <math>(C_*,\\partial_*)</math> by letting <math>C_k</math> be the free abelian group on the ''k''-handles and defining <math>\\partial_k:C_k\\to C_{k-1}</math> by sending a ''k''-handle <math>h_{\\alpha}^k</math> to <math>\\sum_\\beta \\langle h_\\alpha^k\\mid h_\\beta^{k-1}\\rangle h_\\beta^{k-1}</math>, where <math>\\langle h_\\alpha^k\\mid h_\\beta^{k-1}\\rangle</math> is the intersection number of the ''k''-attaching sphere and the (''k''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)-belt sphere.\n\n'''2) Handle cancellation'''\n\nNext, we want to \"cancel\" handles. The idea is that attaching a ''k''-handle <math>h_\\alpha^k</math> might create a hole that can be filled in by attaching a (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handle <math>h_\\beta^{k+1}</math>. This would imply that <math>\\partial_{k+1}h_\\beta^{k+1}=\\pm h_\\alpha^k</math> and so the <math>(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> entry in the matrix of <math>\\partial_{k+1}</math> would be <math>\\pm 1</math>. However, when is this condition sufficient? That is, when can we geometrically cancel handles if this condition is true? The answer lies in carefully analyzing when the manifold remains simply-connected after removing the attaching and belt spheres in question, and finding an embedded disk using the [[Whitney embedding theorem|Whitney trick]]. This analysis leads to the requirement that ''n'' must be at least 5. Moreover, during the proof one requires that the cobordism has no 0-,1-,''n''-, or (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handles which is obtained by the next technique.\n\n'''3) Handle trading'''\n\nThe idea of handle trading is to create a cancelling pair of (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)- and (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)-handles so that a given ''k''-handle cancels with the (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handle leaving behind the (''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)-handle. To do this, consider the core of the ''k''-handle which is an element in <math>\\pi_k(W,M)</math>. This group is trivial since ''W'' is an ''h''-cobordism. Thus, there is a disk <math>D^{k+1}</math> which we can fatten to a cancelling pair as desired, so long as we can embed this disk into the boundary of ''W''. This embedding exists if <math>\\dim\\partial W-1=n-1\\geq 2(k+1)</math>. Since we are assuming ''n'' is at least 5 this means that ''k'' is either 0 or 1. Finally, by considering the negative of the given Morse function, −''f'', we can turn the handle decomposition upside down and also remove the ''n''- and (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-handles as desired.\n\n'''4) Handle sliding'''\n\nFinally, we want to make sure that doing row and column operations on <math>\\partial_k</math> corresponds to a geometric operation. Indeed, it isn't hard to show (best done by drawing a picture) that sliding a ''k''-handle <math>h_\\alpha^k</math> over another ''k''-handle <math>h_{\\beta}^k</math> replaces <math>h_\\alpha^k</math> by <math>h_\\alpha^k\\pm h_\\beta^k</math> in the basis for <math>C_k</math>.\n\nThe proof of the theorem now follows: the handle chain complex is exact since <math>H_*(W,M;\\mathbb{Z})=0</math>. Thus <math>C_k\\cong \\operatorname{coker} \\partial_{k+1}\\oplus\\operatorname{im} \\partial_{k+1}</math> since the <math>C_k</math> are free. Then <math>\\partial_k</math>, which is an integer matrix, restricts to an invertible morphism which can thus be diagonalized via elementary row operations (handle sliding) and must have only <math>\\pm 1</math> on the diagonal because it is invertible. Thus, all handles are paired with a single other cancelling handle yielding a decomposition with no handles.\n\n==The ''s''-cobordism theorem ==\nIf the assumption that ''M'' and ''N'' are simply connected is dropped, ''h''-cobordisms need not be cylinders; the obstruction is exactly the [[Whitehead torsion]] τ (''W'', ''M'') of the inclusion <math>M \\hookrightarrow W</math>.\n\nPrecisely, the '''''s''-cobordism theorem''' (the ''s'' stands for [[simple-homotopy equivalence]]), proved independently by [[Barry Mazur]], [[John Stallings]], and [[Dennis Barden]], states (assumptions as above but where ''M'' and ''N'' need not be simply connected):\n: An ''h''-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if [[Whitehead torsion]] τ (''W'', ''M'') vanishes.\nThe torsion vanishes if and only if the inclusion <math>M \\hookrightarrow W</math> is not just a homotopy equivalence, but a [[simple homotopy equivalence]].\n\nNote that one need not assume that the other inclusion <math>N \\hookrightarrow W</math> is also a simple homotopy equivalence—that follows from the theorem.\n\nCategorically, ''h''-cobordisms form a [[groupoid]].\n\nThen a finer statement of the ''s''-cobordism theorem is that the isomorphism classes of this groupoid (up to '''C'''-isomorphism of ''h''-cobordisms) are [[torsor]]s for the respective<ref>Note that identifying the Whitehead groups of the various manifolds requires that one choose base points <math>m\\in M, n\\in N</math> and a path in ''W'' connecting them.</ref> [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]]s Wh(π), where <math>\\pi \\cong \\pi_1(M) \\cong \\pi_1(W) \\cong \\pi_1(N).</math>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Semi-s-cobordism|Semi-''s''-cobordism]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Michael H|authorlink1=Michael Freedman| last2=Quinn|first2= Frank| authorlink2=Frank Quinn (mathematician)|title=Topology of 4-manifolds|series= Princeton Mathematical Series|volume= 39|publisher= Princeton University Press| location=Princeton, NJ|year= 1990|isbn=0-691-08577-3}} (This does the theorem for topological 4-manifolds.)\n*[[John Milnor|Milnor, John]], ''Lectures on the h-cobordism theorem'', notes by L.

      "text": "[[Image:Triple torus illustration.png|right|thumb|A genus three handlebody.]]\nIn the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[geometric topology]], a '''handlebody''' is a decomposition of a [[manifold]] into standard pieces. Handlebodies play an important role in [[Morse theory]], [[cobordism theory]] and the [[surgery theory]] of high-dimensional manifolds. Handles are used to particularly study [[3-manifold]]s.\n\nHandlebodies play a similar role in the study of manifolds as [[simplicial complex]]es and [[CW complex]]es play in [[homotopy theory]], allowing one to analyze a space in terms of individual pieces and their interactions.\n\n==''n''-dimensional handlebodies==\nIf <math>(W,\\partial W)</math> is an <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold with boundary, and \n:<math>S^{r-1} \\times D^{n-r} \\subset \\partial W</math>\n\n(where <math>S^{n}</math> represents an [[n-sphere]] and <math>D^n</math> is a [[punctured disk|disk punctured n times]]) is an embedding, the <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold with boundary\n:<math>(W',\\partial W') = ((W \\cup( D^r \\times D^{n-r})),(\\partial W - S^{r-1} \\times D^{n-r})\\cup (D^r \\times S^{n-r-1}))</math></center>\n\nis said to be ''obtained from \n:<math>(W,\\partial W)</math>\n\nby attaching an <math>r</math>-handle''.\nThe boundary <math>\\partial W'</math> is obtained from <math>\\partial W</math> by [[Surgery theory|surgery]]. As trivial examples, note that attaching a 0-handle is just taking a disjoint union with a ball, and that attaching an n-handle \nto <math>(W,\\partial W)</math> is gluing in a ball along any sphere component of  <math>\\partial W</math>. [[Morse theory]] was used by [[René Thom|Thom]] and [[Milnor]] to prove that every manifold (with or without boundary) is a handlebody, meaning that it has an expression as a union of handles. The expression is non-unique: the manipulation of handlebody decompositions is an essential ingredient of the proof of the [[Smale]] [[h-cobordism]] theorem, and its generalization to the [[s-cobordism]] theorem. A manifold is called a \"k-handlebody\" if it is the union of r-handles, for r at most k. This is not the same as the dimension of the manifold. For instance, a 4-dimensional 2-handlebody is a union of 0-handles, 1-handles and 2-handles. Any manifold is an n-handlebody, that is, any manifold is the union of handles. It isn't too hard to see that a manifold is an (n-1)-handlebody if and only if it has non-empty boundary.\nAny handlebody decomposition of a manifold defines a [[CW complex]] decomposition of the manifold, since attaching an r-handle is the same, up to homotopy equivalence, as attaching an r-cell. However, a handlebody decomposition gives more information than just the homotopy type of the manifold. For instance, a handlebody decomposition completely describes the manifold up to homeomorphism. In dimension four, they even describe the smooth structure, as long as the attaching maps are smooth. This is false in higher dimensions; any [[exotic sphere]] is the union of a 0-handle and an n-handle.\n\n==3-dimensional handlebodies==\nA handlebody can be defined as an [[orientable]] 3-manifold-with-boundary containing  pairwise disjoint, properly embedded 2-discs such that the manifold resulting from cutting along the discs is a 3-ball.  It's instructive to imagine how to reverse this process to get a handlebody.  (Sometimes  the orientability hypothesis is dropped from this last definition, and one gets a more general kind of handlebody with a non-orientable handle.)  \n\nThe ''genus'' of a handlebody is the [[genus (topology)|genus]] of its  [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]].   [[Up to]] [[homeomorphism]], there is exactly one handlebody of any non-negative integer genus.\n\nThe importance of handlebodies in [[3-manifold]] theory comes from their connection with [[Heegaard splitting]]s.  The importance of handlebodies in [[geometric group theory]] comes from the fact that their [[fundamental group]] is free.\n\nA 3-dimensional handlebody is sometimes, particularly in older literature, referred to as a '''cube with handles'''.\n\n==Examples==\nLet ''G'' be a connected [[finite set|finite]] graph embedded in [[Euclidean space]] of dimension n.  Let ''V'' be a [[closed (topology)|closed]] [[regular neighborhood]] of ''G'' in the Euclidean space. Then ''V'' is an n-dimensional handlebody.  The graph ''G'' is called a ''spine'' of ''V''.\n\nAny genus zero handlebody is [[homeomorphic]] to the three-[[ball (topology)|ball]] B<sup>3</sup>. A genus one handlebody is [[homeomorphic]] to B<sup>2</sup> &times; S<sup>1</sup> (where S<sup>1</sup> is the [[circle]]) and is called a ''solid [[torus]]''. All other handlebodies may be obtained by taking the boundary-[[connected sum]] of a collection of solid tori.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Handle decomposition]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Matsumoto | first1=Yukio | title=An introduction to Morse theory | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TtKyqozvgIwC | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Translations of Mathematical Monographs | isbn=978-0-8218-1022-4 | mr=1873233 | year=2002 | volume=208}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric topology]]\n[[Category:Surgery theory]]"

It can be thought of as the simply-connected ''quadratic'' [[L-theory|L-group]] <math>L_{4k+2}</math>, and thus analogous to the other invariants from L-theory: the [[signature (topology)|signature]], a <math>4k</math>-dimensional invariant (either symmetric or quadratic, <math>L^{4k} \\cong L_{4k}</math>), and the [[De Rham invariant]], a <math>(4k+1)</math>-dimensional ''symmetric'' invariant <math>L^{4k+1}</math>.\n\nIn any given dimension, there are only two possibilities: either all manifolds have Arf–Kervaire invariant equal to 0, or half have Arf–Kervaire invariant 0 and the other half have Arf–Kervaire invariant 1.\n\nThe '''Kervaire invariant problem''' is the problem of determining in which dimensions the Kervaire invariant can be nonzero. For [[differentiable manifold]]s, this can happen in dimensions 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and possibly 126, and in no other dimensions. The final case of dimension 126 remains open.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe Kervaire invariant is the [[Arf invariant]] of the [[quadratic form]] determined by the framing on the middle-dimensional <math>\\Z/2\\Z</math>-coefficient homology group\n\n:<math>q\\colon H_{2m+1}(M;\\Z/2\\mathbb{Z}) \\to \\Z/2\\Z,</math>\n\nand is thus sometimes called the '''Arf–Kervaire invariant'''. The quadratic form (properly, [[skew-quadratic form]]) is a [[quadratic refinement]] of the usual [[ε-symmetric form]] on the middle dimensional homology of an (unframed) even-dimensional manifold; the framing yields the quadratic refinement.\n\nThe quadratic form ''q'' can be defined by algebraic topology using functional [[Steenrod square]]s, and geometrically via the self-intersections \nof [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersions]] <math>S^{2m+1}</math><math>\\to</math> <math>M^{4m+2}</math> determined by the framing, or by the triviality/non-triviality of the normal bundles of embeddings <math>S^{2m+1}</math><math>\\to</math> <math>M^{4m+2}</math> (for <math>m \\neq 0,1,3</math>) and the mod 2 [[Hopf invariant]] of maps <math>S^{4m+2+k} \\to S^{2m+1+k}</math>\n(for <math>m = 0,1,3</math>).\n\n== History ==\nThe Kervaire invariant is a generalization of the Arf invariant of a framed surface (that is, a 2-dimensional manifold with stably trivialized tangent bundle) which was used by [[Lev Pontryagin]] in 1950 to compute the [[homotopy group]] <math>\\pi_{n+2}(S^n)=\\Z/2\\Z</math> of maps <math>S^{n+2}</math> <math>\\to</math> <math>S^n</math> (for <math>n\\geq 2</math>), which is the cobordism group of surfaces embedded in <math>S^{n+2}</math> with trivialized normal bundle.\n\n{{harvtxt|Kervaire|1960}} used his invariant for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 to construct the [[Kervaire manifold]], a 10-dimensional [[PL manifold]] with no [[smooth structure|differentiable structure]], the first example of such a manifold, by showing that his invariant does not vanish on this PL manifold, but vanishes on all smooth manifolds of dimension 10.\n\n{{harvtxt|Kervaire|Milnor|1963}} computes the group of [[exotic sphere]]s (in dimension greater than 4), with one step in the computation depending on the Kervaire invariant problem. Specifically, they show that the set of exotic spheres of dimension ''n'' – specifically the monoid of smooth structures on the standard ''n''-sphere – is isomorphic to the group <math>\\Theta_n</math> of [[H-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]] classes of oriented [[homotopy sphere|homotopy ''n''-spheres]]. They compute this latter in terms of a map\n:<math>\\Theta_n/bP_{n+1}\\to \\pi_n^S/J,\\, </math>\nwhere <math>bP_{n+1}</math> is the cyclic subgroup of ''n''-spheres that bound a [[parallelizable manifold]] of dimension <math>n+1</math>, <math>\\pi_n^S</math> is the ''n''th [[stable homotopy group of spheres]], and ''J'' is the image of the [[J-homomorphism]], which is also a cyclic group. The groups <math>bP_{n+1}</math> and <math>J</math> have easily understood cyclic factors, which are trivial or order two except in dimension <math>n = 4k+3</math>, in which case they are large, with order related to the [[Bernoulli number]]s. The quotients are the difficult parts of the groups. The map between these quotient groups is either an isomorphism or is injective and has an image of index 2. It is the latter if and only if there is an ''n''-dimensional framed manifold of nonzero Kervaire invariant, and thus the classification of exotic spheres depends up to a factor of 2 on the Kervaire invariant problem.\n\n== Examples ==\nFor the standard embedded [[torus]], the skew-symmetric form is given by <math>\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\\\-1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math> (with respect to the standard [[symplectic basis]]), and the skew-quadratic refinement is given by <math>xy</math> with respect to this basis: <math>Q(1,0)=Q(0,1)=0</math>: the basis curves don't self-link; and <math>Q(1,1)=1</math>: a (1,1) self-links, as in the [[Hopf fibration]]. This form thus has [[Arf invariant]] 0 (most of its elements have norm 0; it has [[isotropy index]] 1), and thus the standard embedded torus has Kervaire invariant 0.\n\n== Kervaire invariant problem ==\nThe question of in which dimensions ''n'' there are ''n''-dimensional framed manifolds of nonzero Kervaire invariant is called the '''Kervaire invariant problem'''. This is only possible if ''n'' is 2 mod 4, and indeed one must have ''n'' is of the form <math>2^k-2</math> (two less than a power of two). The question is almost completely resolved; {{as of|2019|lc=1}} only the case of dimension 126 is open: there are manifolds with nonzero Kervaire invariant in dimension 2, 6, 14, 30, 62, and none in all other dimensions other than possibly 126.\n\nThe main results are those of {{harvs|txt|last=Browder|first=William|authorlink=William Browder (mathematician)|year=1969}}, who reduced the problem from differential topology to [[stable homotopy theory]] and showed that the only possible dimensions are <math>2^k-2</math>, and those of {{harvs|txt|last1=Hill | first1=Michael A. | last2=Hopkins | first2=Michael J. |author2-link = Michael J.

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''normal map''' is a concept in [[geometric topology]] due to [[William Browder (mathematician)|William Browder]] which is of fundamental importance in [[surgery theory]]. Given a [[Poincaré complex]] ''X'' (more geometrically a [[Poincaré space]]), a normal map on ''X'' endows the space, roughly speaking, with some of the homotopy-theoretic global structure of a closed manifold. In particular, ''X'' has a good candidate for a [[stable normal bundle]] and a [[René Thom|Thom]] collapse map, which is equivalent to there being a map from a manifold ''M'' to ''X'' matching the fundamental classes and preserving normal bundle information. If the dimension of ''X'' is <math>\\ge</math> 5 there is then only the algebraic topology [[surgery obstruction]] due to [[C. T. C. Wall]] to ''X'' actually being [[homotopy equivalent]] to a closed manifold. Normal maps also apply to the study of the uniqueness of manifold structures within a homotopy type, which was pioneered by [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]].\n\nThe [[cobordism]] classes of normal maps on ''X'' are called '''normal invariants'''. Depending on the category of manifolds (differentiable, piecewise-linear, or topological), there are similarly defined, but inequivalent, concepts of normal maps and normal invariants.\n\nIt is possible to perform [[Surgery theory#Surgery on a manifold|surgery]] on normal maps, meaning surgery on the domain manifold, and preserving the map. Surgery on normal maps allows one to systematically kill elements in the relative homotopy groups by representing them as embeddings ''with trivial normal bundle''.\n\n==Definition==\nThere are two equivalent definitions of normal maps, depending on whether one uses normal bundles or tangent bundles of manifolds. Hence it is possible to switch between the definitions which turns out to be quite convenient.\n\n1. Given a Poincaré complex ''X'' (i.e. a [[CW-complex]] whose cellular chain complex satisfies [[Poincaré duality]]) of formal dimension <math>n</math>, a normal map on ''X'' consists of\n* a map <math>f\\colon M \\to X</math> from some closed ''n''-dimensional manifold ''M'',\n* a bundle <math>\\xi</math> over ''X'', and a stable map from the [[stable normal bundle]] <math>\\nu_M</math> of <math>M</math> to <math>\\xi</math>, and\n* usually the normal map is supposed to be of '''degree one'''. That means that the fundamental class of <math>M</math> should be mapped under <math>f</math> to the fundamental class of <math>X</math>: <math>f_*([M])=[X]\\in H_n(X)</math>.\n\n2. Given a Poincaré complex <math>X</math> (i.e. a [[CW-complex]] whose cellular chain complex satisfies [[Poincaré duality]]) of formal dimension <math>n</math>, a normal map on <math>X</math> (with respect to the tangent bundle) consists of\n* a map <math>f\\colon M \\to X</math> from some closed <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>M</math>,\n* a bundle <math>\\xi</math> over <math>X</math>, and a stable map from the stable [[tangent bundle]] <math>\\tau_M \\oplus \\varepsilon^k</math> of <math>M</math> to <math>\\xi</math>, and\n* similarly as above it is required that the fundamental class of <math>M</math> should be mapped under <math>f</math> to the fundamental class of <math>X</math>: <math>f_*([M])=[X]\\in H_n(X)</math>.\n\nTwo normal maps are equivalent if there exists a normal bordism between them.\n\n==Role in surgery theory==\n\n===Surgery on maps versus surgery on normal maps===\nConsider the question: \n: Is the Poincaré complex ''X'' of formal dimension ''n'' homotopy-equivalent to a closed ''n''-manifold?\nA naive surgery approach to this question would be: start with some map <math>M\\to X</math> from some manifold <math>M</math> to <math>X</math>, and try to do surgery on it to make a homotopy equivalence out of it. Notice the following: Since our starting map was arbitrarily chosen, and surgery always produces cobordant maps, this procedure has to be performed (in the worst case) for all cobordism classes of maps <math>M\\to X</math>. This kind of cobordism theory is a homology theory whose coefficients have been calculated by [[Thom]]: therefore the cobordism classes of such maps are computable at least in theory for all spaces <math>X</math>.\n\nHowever, it turns out that it is very difficult to decide whether it is possible to make a homotopy equivalence out of the map by means of surgery, whereas the same question is much easier when the map comes with the extra structure of a normal map. Therefore, in the classical surgery approach to our question, one starts with a normal map <math>f\\colon M\\to X</math> (suppose there exists any), and performs surgery on it. This has several advantages:\n* The map being of degree one implies that the homology of <math>M</math> splits as a direct sum of the homology of <math>X</math> and the so-called '''surgery kernel''' <math>K_*(M)=ker(f_*\\colon H_*(M)\\to H_*(X))</math>, that is <math>H_*(M)=K_*(M) \\oplus H_*(X)</math>. (Here we suppose that <math>f</math> induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups and use homology with local coefficients in <math>Z[\\pi_1(X)]</math>.)\n\nBy [[Whitehead's theorem]], the map <math>f</math> is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the surgery kernel is zero.\n* The bundle data implies the following: Suppose that an element <math>\\alpha\\in\\pi_{p+1}(f)</math> (the relative homotopy group of <math>f</math>) can be represented by an [[embedding]] <math>\\phi:S^p\\to M</math> (or more generally an [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersion]]) with a null-homotopy of <math>f \\circ \\phi:S^p \\to X</math>. Then it can be represented by an embedding (or immersion) whose normal bundle is stably trivial. This observation is important since surgery is only possible on embeddings with a trivial normal bundle. For example, if <math>p</math> is less than half the dimension of <math>X</math>, every map <math>S^p\\to X</math> is homotopic to an embedding by a theorem of [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]]. On the other hand, every stably trivial normal bundle of such an embedding is automatically trivial, since <math>\\pi_p(BO, BO_k)=0</math> for <math>k>p</math>. Therefore, surgery on normal maps can always be done below the middle dimension. This is not true for arbitrary maps.\n\nNotice that this new approach makes it necessary to classify the bordism classes of normal maps, which are the normal invariants. Contrarily to cobordism classes of maps, the normal invariants are a ''cohomology theory''. Its coefficients are known in the case of topological manifolds. For the case of smooth manifolds, the coefficients of the theory are much more complicated.\n\n===Normal invariants versus structure set===\nThere are two reasons why it is important to study the set <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math>. Recall that the main goal of surgery theory is to answer the questions:\n\n1. Given a finite Poincaré complex <math>X</math> is there an <math>n</math>-manifold homotopy equivalent to <math>X</math>?\n\n2. Given two homotopy equivalences <math>f_i \\colon M_i \\rightarrow X</math>, where <math>i = 0,1</math> is there a diffeomorphism <math>h \\colon M_0 \\rightarrow M_1</math> such that <math>f_1 \\circ h \\simeq f_0</math>?\n\nNotice that if the answer to these questions should be positive then it is a necessary condition that the answer to the following two questions is positive\n\n1.' Given a finite Poincaré complex <math>X</math> is there a degree one normal map <math>(f,b) \\colon M \\rightarrow X</math>?\n \n2.' Given two homotopy equivalences <math>f_i \\colon M_i \\rightarrow X</math>, where <math>i = 0,1</math> is there a normal cobordism <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (M \\times I, M \\times 0, M \\times 1)</math> such that <math>\\partial F_0 = f_0 </math> and <math>\\partial F_1 = f_1 </math>?\n\nThis is of course an almost trivial observation, but it is important because it turns out that there is an effective theory which answers question 1.' and also an effective theory which answers question 1. provided the answer to 1.' is yes. Similarly for questions 2. and 2.' Notice also that we can phrase the questions as follows:\n\n1.' Is <math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\neq \\emptyset</math>?\n\n2.' Is <math>f_0 = f_1</math> in <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math>?\n\nHence studying <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> is really a first step in trying to understand the surgery structure set <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> which is the main goal in surgery theory. The point is that <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> is much more accessible from the point of view of algebraic topology as is explained below.\n\n==Homotopy theory==\n1.' Let ''X'' be a finite ''n''-dimensional Poincaré complex. It is useful to use the definition of <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> with normal bundles. Recall that a (smooth) manifold has a unique tangent bundle and a unique stable normal bundle. But a finite Poincaré complex does not possess such a unique bundle. Nevertheless, it possesses a substitute - a unique in some sense spherical fibration - the so-called Spivak normal fibration. This has a property that if <math>X</math> is homotopy equivalent to a manifold then the spherical fibration associated to the pullback of the normal bundle of that manifold is isomorphic to the Spivak normal fibration. So it follows that if <math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\neq \\emptyset</math> then the Spivak normal fibration has a bundle reduction. By the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction]] the converse is also true.\n\nThis can be formulated in terms of homotopy theory. Recall <math>BG</math> the classifying space for stable spherical fibrations,  <math>BO</math> the classifying space for stable vector bundles and the map <math>J \\colon BO \\rightarrow BG</math> which is induced by the inclusion <math>O \\hookrightarrow G</math> and which corresponds to taking the associated spherical fibration of a vector bundle. In fact we have a fibration sequence <math>BO \\rightarrow BG \\rightarrow B(G/O)</math>. The Spivak normal fibration is classified by a map <math>\\nu_X \\colon X \\rightarrow BG</math>. It has a vector bundle reduction if and only if <math>\\nu_X</math> has a lift <math>\\tilde{\\nu}_X \\colon X \\rightarrow BO</math>. This is equivalent to requiring that the composition <math>X \\rightarrow BG \\rightarrow B(G/O)</math> is null-homotopic.\n\nNote that the homotopy groups of <math>B(G/O)</math> are known in certain low-dimensions and are non-trivial which suggests the possibility that the above condition can fail for some <math>X</math>. There are in fact such finite Poincaré complexes, and the first example was obtained by [[Samuel Gitler Hammer|Gitler]] and [[Jim Stasheff|Stasheff]],{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} yielding thus an example of a Poincaré complex not homotopy equivalent to a manifold.\n\n2.' Relativizing the above considerations one obtains an (unnatural) bijection\n\n<math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\cong [X,G/O].</math>\n\n==Different categories==\nThe above bijection gives <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> a structure of an abelian group since the space <math>G/O</math> is a loop space and in fact an infinite loop space so the normal invariants are a zeroth cohomology group of an extraordinary cohomology theory defined by that infinite loop space. Note that similar ideas apply in the other categories of manifolds and one has bijections\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\cong [X,G/O]</math>, and <math>\\mathcal{N}^{PL} (X) \\cong [X,G/PL]</math>, and <math>\\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (X) \\cong [X,G/TOP].</math>\n\nIt is well known that the spaces\n\n: <math>G/O</math>, <math>G/PL</math> and <math>G/TOP</math>\n\nare mutually not homotopy equivalent and hence one obtains three different cohomology theories.\n\nSullivan analyzed the cases <math>G/PL</math> and <math>G/TOP</math>. He showed that these spaces possess alternative infinite loop space structures which are in fact better from the following point of view: Recall that there is a surgery obstruction map from normal invariants to the L-group. With the above described groups structure on the normal invariants this map is NOT a homomorphism. However, with the group structure from Sullivan's theorem it becomes a homomorphism in the categories <math>CAT = PL</math>, and <math>TOP</math>. His theorem also links these new group structures to the well-known cohomology theories: the singular cohomology and real K-theory.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Browder | first1=William | title=Surgery on simply-connected manifolds | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York |mr=0358813 | year=1972}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Gitler| first1=Samule | last2=Stasheff| first2= James D. | title=The first exotic class of BF|journal=Topology|date=November 1965|volume=4|issue=3|pages=257–266|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0040938365900108 | doi=10.1016/0040-9383(65)90010-8}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Lück | first1=Wolfgang | title=A basic introduction to surgery theory | url=http://131.220.77.52/lueck/data/ictp.pdf  | publisher= ICTP Lecture Notes Series 9, Band 1, of the school \"High-dimensional manifold theory\" in Trieste, May/June 2001, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste 1-224 | year=2002}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ranicki | first1=Andrew | title=Algebraic and Geometric Surgery | url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/books/index.htm  | publisher=Oxford Mathematical Monographs, Clarendon Press | isbn=978-0-19-850924-0 |mr=2061749 | year=2002 | doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198509240.001.0001| citeseerx=10.1.1.309.8886 }}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wall | first1=C.

      "text": ":''This page concerns mathematician Sergei Novikov's topology conjecture. For astrophysicist Igor Novikov's conjecture regarding time travel, see [[Novikov self-consistency principle]].\n\nThe '''Novikov conjecture''' is one of the most important unsolved problems in [[topology]].  It is named for [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]] who originally posed the conjecture in 1965.\n\nThe Novikov conjecture concerns the [[homotopy]] invariance of certain [[polynomial]]s in the [[Pontryagin class]]es of a [[manifold]], arising from the [[fundamental group]]. According to the Novikov conjecture, the ''higher signatures'', which are certain numerical invariants of smooth manifolds, are homotopy invariants.\n\nThe conjecture has been proved for finitely generated [[abelian group]]s. It is not yet known whether the Novikov conjecture holds true for all groups.  There are no known counterexamples to the conjecture.\n\n==Precise formulation of the conjecture==\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a [[discrete group]] and <math>BG</math> its [[classifying space]], which is a [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]] of type <math>K(G,1)</math>, and therefore unique up to [[homotopy equivalence]] as a CW complex. Let\n\n:<math>f\\colon M\\rightarrow BG</math>\n\nbe a continuous map from a closed oriented <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>M</math> to <math>BG</math>, and\n\n:<math>x \\in H^{n-4i} (BG;\\mathbb{Q} ).</math>\n\nNovikov considered the numerical expression, found by evaluating the cohomology class in top dimension against the [[fundamental class]] <math>[M]</math>, and known as a '''higher signature''':\n\n:<math>\\left\\langle f^*(x) \\cup L_i(M),[M] \\right\\rangle \\in \\mathbb{Q}</math>\n\nwhere <math>L_i</math> is the <math>i^{\\rm th}</math> [[Hirzebruch polynomial]], or sometimes (less descriptively) as the <math>i^{\\rm th}</math> <math>L</math>-polynomial. For each <math>i</math>, this polynomial can be expressed in the Pontryagin classes of the manifold's tangent bundle. The '''Novikov conjecture''' states that the higher signature is an invariant of the oriented homotopy type of <math>M</math> for every such map <math>f</math> and every such class <math>x</math>, in other words, if <math>h\\colon M' \\rightarrow M</math> is an orientation preserving homotopy equivalence, the higher signature associated to <math>f \\circ h</math> is equal to that associated to <math>f</math>.\n\n==Connection with the Borel conjecture==\n\nThe Novikov conjecture is equivalent to the rational injectivity of the [[assembly map]] in [[L-theory]].

      "title": "Obstruction theory",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_theory",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''obstruction theory''' is a name given to two different [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]], both of which yield [[cohomological]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]].\n\nIn the original work of [[Eduard Stiefel|Stiefel]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]], [[characteristic class]]es were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent [[Vector field|vector]]s. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a [[Section (fiber bundle)|cross-section]] of a [[Fiber bundle|bundle]].\n\n==In homotopy theory==\nThe older meaning for obstruction theory in [[homotopy theory]] relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a [[continuous mapping]] defined on a [[simplicial complex]], or [[CW complex]]. It is traditionally called ''Eilenberg obstruction theory'', after [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It involves [[cohomology group]]s with coefficients in [[homotopy group]]s to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex ''X'' to another, ''Y'', defined initially on the [[0-skeleton]] of ''X'' (the vertices of ''X''), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same [[path-connected]] component of ''Y''. Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary. \n\nAt some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' to the n-skeleton of ''X'', this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class {{math|''π''<sub>n-1</sub>(''Y'')}} of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an [[cohomology|n-cochain]]  with coefficients in {{math|''π''<sub>n-1</sub>(''Y'')}}. Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a '''cocycle''' and so defines a [[cohomology]] class in the nth cohomology group of ''X'' with coefficients in {{math|''π''<sub>n-1</sub>(''Y'')}}. When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of ''X''.  If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton.\n\n===Obstruction to extending a section of a principal bundle===\n\n====Construction====\nSuppose that {{mvar|B}} is a [[simply connected]] simplicial complex and that {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is a [[fibration]] with fiber {{mvar|F}}.  Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math| ''σ''<sub>''n''</sub> : ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> → ''E''}} on the [[N-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] of {{mvar|B}}.\n\nFor every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex {{mvar|Δ}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>}} can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]]).  Because {{mvar|p}} send each of these back to each {{mvar|Δ}}, we have a map from an {{mvar|n}}-sphere to {{math|''p''<sup>−1</sup>(''Δ'')}}. Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and {{mvar|Δ}} is [[Contractible space|contractible]]; {{math|''p''<sup>−1</sup>(''Δ'')}} is [[homotopy equivalent]] to {{mvar|F}}. So this partially defined section assigns an element of [[homotopy group|{{math|''π''<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'')}}]] to every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex.  This is precisely the data of a {{math|''π''<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'')}}-valued [[simplicial homology|simplicial]] [[cohomology#definition|cochain]] of degree {{math|''n'' + 1}} on {{mvar|B}}, i.e. an element of {{math|''C''<sup>''n'' + 1</sup>(B; ''π''<sub>''n''</sub>(''F''))}}.  This cochain is called the '''obstruction cochain''' because it being the zero means that all of these elements of {{math|''π''<sub>''n''</sub>(''F'')}} are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each {{mvar|Δ}}) and the constant map.\n\nThe fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from all the boundaries of all the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle.  If one started with a different partially defined section {{math|''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>}} that agreed with the original on the {{math|(''n'' &minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary.  Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group {{math|''H''<sup>''n'' + 1</sup>(''B''; ''π''<sub>''n''</sub>(''F''))}} such that if a partially defined section on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the {{math|(''n'' &minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial.\n\nThe converse is also true if one allows such things as ''homotopy sections'', i.e. a map {{math|''σ'' : ''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p'' ∘ ''σ''}} is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on {{mvar|B}}.  Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton.\n\n====Applications====\n* By inducting over {{mvar|n}}, one can construct a ''first obstruction to a section'' as the first of the above cohomology classes that is non-zero. \n* This can be used to find obstructions to trivializations of [[principal bundle#Trivializations and cross sections|principal bundles]].\n* Because [[homotopy fiber|any map can be turned into a fibration]], this construction can be used to see if there are obstructions to the existence of a lift (up to homotopy) of a map into {{mvar|B}} to a map into {{mvar|E}} even if {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is not a fibration.\n* It is crucial to the construction of [[Postnikov system]]s.\n\n==In geometric topology==\nIn [[geometric topology]], obstruction theory is concerned with when a [[topological manifold]] has a [[piecewise linear structure]], and when a piecewise linear manifold has a [[differential structure]].\n\nIn dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Morse), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same.\n\nIn dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide.\n\n==In surgery theory==\nThe two basic questions of [[surgery theory]] are whether a topological space with ''n''-dimensional [[Poincaré duality]] is [[homotopy equivalent]] to an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]], and also whether a [[homotopy equivalence]] of ''n''-dimensional manifolds is [[homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]. In both cases there are two obstructions for ''n>9'', a primary [[topological K-theory]] obstruction to the existence of a [[vector bundle]]: if this vanishes there exists a [[normal invariant|normal map]], allowing the definition of the secondary [[surgery theory|surgery obstruction]] in [[L-theory|algebraic L-theory]] to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a [[homotopy equivalence]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Kirby–Siebenmann class]]\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=Dale|last=Husemöller|title=Fibre Bundles|publisher=Springer Verlag|year=1994|isbn=0-387-94087-1}}\n* {{citation|first=Norman|last=Steenrod|authorlink=Norman Steenrod|title=The Topology of Fibre Bundles|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1951|isbn=0-691-08055-0}}\n*{{cite book \n  |last= Scorpan\n  |first= Alexandru\n  |title= The wild world of 4-manifolds\n  |publisher= American Mathematical Society\n  |year= 2005\n  |isbn=  0-8218-3749-4}}\n\n[[Category:Homotopy theory]]\n[[Category:Differential topology]]\n[[Category:Surgery theory]]\n[[Category:Theories]]"

      "text": "In 4-dimensional topology, a branch of mathematics, '''Rokhlin's theorem''' states that if a [[Differentiable manifold|smooth]], closed 4-[[manifold]] ''M'' has a [[spin structure]] (or, equivalently, the second [[Stiefel–Whitney class]] <math>w_2(M)</math> vanishes), then the [[Signature (topology)|signature]] of its [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]], a [[quadratic form]] on the second [[cohomology group]] <math>H^2(M)</math>, is divisible by 16. The theorem is named for [[Vladimir Rokhlin (Soviet mathematician)|Vladimir Rokhlin]], who proved it in 1952.\n\n==Examples==\n*The [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] on ''M''\n::<math>Q_M\\colon H^2(M,\\Z)\\times H^2(M,\\Z)\\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}</math>\n:is [[unimodular lattice|unimodular]] on <math>\\Z</math> by [[Poincaré duality]], and the vanishing of <math>w_2(M)</math> implies that the intersection form is even. By a theorem of [[Cahit Arf]], any even unimodular lattice has signature divisible by 8, so Rokhlin's theorem forces one extra factor of 2 to divide the signature.\n*A [[K3 surface]] is compact, 4 dimensional, and <math>w_2(M)</math> vanishes, and the signature is &minus;16, so 16 is the best possible number in Rokhlin's theorem.\n*A complex surface in <math>\\mathbb{CP}^3</math> of degree <math>d</math> is spin if and only if <math>d</math> is even. It has signature <math>(4-d^2)d/3</math>, which can be seen from [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]]'s [[Genus of a multiplicative sequence|signature theorem]]. The case <math>d=4</math> gives back the last example of a [[K3 surface]].\n*[[Michael Freedman]]'s [[E8 manifold]] is a [[Simply connected space|simply connected]] compact [[topological manifold]] with vanishing <math>w_2(M)</math> and intersection form <math>E_8</math> of signature 8. Rokhlin's theorem implies that this manifold has no [[smooth structure]]. This manifold shows that Rokhlin's theorem fails for the set of merely topological (rather than smooth) manifolds.\n*If the manifold ''M'' is simply connected (or more generally if the first homology group has no 2-torsion), then the vanishing of <math>w_2(M)</math> is equivalent to the intersection form being even. This is not true in general: an [[Enriques surface]] is a compact smooth 4 manifold and has even intersection form II<sub>1,9</sub> of signature &minus;8 (not divisible by 16), but the class <math>w_2(M)</math> does not vanish and is represented by a [[Torsion (algebra)|torsion element]] in the second cohomology group.\n\n==Proofs==\nRokhlin's theorem can be deduced from the fact that the third [[stable homotopy group of spheres]] <math>\\pi^S_3</math> is cyclic of order 24; this is Rokhlin's original approach.\n\nIt can also be deduced from the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]. See [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem#Â genus and Rochlin's theorem|Â genus and Rochlin's theorem]].\n\n{{harvs|txt|last=Kirby|first=Robion|authorlink=Robion Kirby|year=1989}} gives a geometric proof.\n\n==The Rokhlin invariant==\nSince Rokhlin's theorem states that the signature of a spin smooth manifold is divisible by 16, the definition of the '''Rohkhlin invariant''' is deduced as follows:\n:For 3-manifold <math>N</math> and a [[spin structure]] <math>s</math> on <math>N</math>, the Rokhlin invariant <math>\\mu(N,s)</math> in <math>\\Z/16\\mathbb{Z}</math> is defined to be the signature of any smooth compact spin 4-manifold with spin boundary <math>(N,s)</math>.\n\nIf ''N'' is a [[spin structure|spin]] 3-manifold then it bounds a spin 4-manifold ''M''. The signature of ''M'' is divisible by 8, and an easy application of Rokhlin's theorem shows that its value mod 16 depends only on ''N'' and not on the choice of ''M''. Homology 3-spheres have a unique [[spin structure]] so we can define the Rokhlin invariant of a homology 3-sphere to be the element <math>\\operatorname{sign}(M)/8</math> of <math>\\Z/2Z</math>, where ''M'' any spin 4-manifold bounding the homology sphere.\n\nFor example, the [[Poincaré homology sphere]] bounds a spin 4-manifold with intersection form <math>E_8</math>, so its Rokhlin invariant is 1. This result has some elementary consequences: the Poincaré homology sphere does not admit a smooth embedding in <math>S^4</math>, nor does it bound a [[Mazur manifold]].\n\nMore generally, if ''N'' is a [[spin structure|spin]] 3-manifold (for example, any <math>\\Z/2\\Z</math> homology sphere), then the signature of any spin 4-manifold ''M'' with boundary ''N'' is well defined mod 16, and is called the Rokhlin invariant of ''N''. On a topological 3-manifold ''N'', the '''generalized Rokhlin invariant''' refers to the function whose domain is the [[spin structure]]s on ''N'', and which evaluates to the Rokhlin invariant of the pair <math>(N,s)</math> where ''s'' is a spin structure on ''N''.\n\nThe Rokhlin invariant of M is equal to half the [[Casson invariant]] mod 2. The Casson invariant is viewed as the '''Z'''-valued lift of the Rokhlin invariant of integral homology 3-sphere.\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe '''Kervaire–Milnor theorem''' {{harv|Kervaire|Milnor|1960}} states that if <math>\\Sigma</math> is a characteristic sphere in a smooth compact 4-manifold ''M'', then \n: <math>\\operatorname{signature}(M) = \\Sigma \\cdot \\Sigma \\bmod 16</math>.\nA characteristic sphere is an embedded 2-sphere whose homology class represents the Stiefel–Whitney class <math>w_2(M)</math>. If <math>w_2(M)</math> vanishes, we can take <math>\\Sigma</math> to be any small sphere, which has self intersection number 0, so Rokhlin's theorem follows.\n\nThe '''Freedman–Kirby theorem''' {{harv|Freedman|Kirby|1978}} states that if <math>\\Sigma</math> is a characteristic surface in a smooth compact 4-manifold ''M'', then \n:<math>\\operatorname{signature}(M) = \\Sigma \\cdot \\Sigma + 8\\operatorname{Arf}(M,\\Sigma) \\bmod 16</math>.\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{Arf}(M,\\Sigma)</math> is the [[Arf invariant]] of a certain quadratic form on <math>H_1(\\Sigma, \\Z/2\\Z)</math>. This Arf invariant is obviously 0 if <math>\\Sigma</math> is a sphere, so the Kervaire–Milnor theorem is a special case.\n\nA generalization of the Freedman-Kirby theorem to topological (rather than smooth) manifolds states that\n:<math>\\operatorname{signature}(M) = \\Sigma \\cdot \\Sigma + 8\\operatorname{Arf}(M,\\Sigma)  + 8\\operatorname{ks}(M) \\bmod 16</math>,\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{ks}(M)</math> is the [[Kirby–Siebenmann invariant]] of ''M''. The Kirby–Siebenmann invariant of ''M'' is 0 if ''M'' is smooth.\n\n[[Armand Borel]] and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] proved the following theorem: If ''X'' is a smooth compact [[spin manifold]] of dimension divisible by 4 then the [[Â genus]] is an integer, and is even if the dimension of ''X'' is 4 mod 8. This can be deduced from the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]: [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Isadore Singer]] showed that the Â genus is the index of the Atiyah–Singer operator, which is always integral, and is even in dimensions 4 mod 8. For a 4-dimensional manifold, the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem]] shows that the signature is &minus;8 times the Â genus, so in dimension 4 this implies Rokhlin's theorem.\n\n{{harvtxt|Ochanine|1980}} proved that if ''X'' is a compact oriented smooth spin manifold of dimension 4 mod 8, then its signature is divisible by 16.\n\n==References==\n* [[Michael Freedman|Freedman, Michael]]; [[Robion Kirby|Kirby, Robion]], \"A geometric proof of Rochlin's theorem\", in: Algebraic and geometric topology (Proc.

      "text": "{{Technical|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn [[surgery theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''stable normal bundle''' of a [[differentiable manifold]] is an invariant which encodes the stable normal (dually, tangential) data. There are analogs for generalizations of manifold, notably [[PL-manifold]]s and [[topological manifold]]s. There is also an analogue in [[homotopy theory]] for [[Poincaré space]]s, the '''Spivak spherical fibration''', named after [[Michael Spivak]].<ref>{{citation\n|last=Spivak\n|first=Michael\n|author-link=Michael Spivak\n|title=Spaces satisfying Poincaré duality\n|journal=[[Topology (journal)|Topology]]\n|issue=6\n|year=1967\n|pages=77–101\n|mr=0214071\n}}</ref>\n\n==Construction via embeddings==\nGiven an embedding of a manifold in [[Euclidean space]] (provided by the theorem of [[Hassler Whitney]]), it has a [[normal bundle]]. The embedding is not unique, but for high dimension of the Euclidean space it is unique up to [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], thus the (class of the) bundle is unique, and called the ''stable normal bundle''.\n\nThis construction works for any [[Poincaré space]] ''X'': a finite [[CW-complex]] admits a stably unique (up to homotopy) embedding in [[Euclidean space]], via [[general position]], and this embedding yields a spherical fibration over ''X''. For more restricted spaces (notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds), one gets stronger data.\n\n===Details===\n\nTwo embeddings <math>i,i'\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m</math> are ''isotopic'' if they are [[homotopic]]\nthrough embeddings. Given a manifold or other suitable space ''X,'' with two embeddings into Euclidean space <math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m,</math> <math>j\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^n,</math> these will not in general be isotopic, or even maps into the same space (<math>m</math> need not equal <math>n</math>). However, one can embed these into a larger space <math>\\mathbf{R}^N</math> by letting the last <math>N-m</math> coordinates be 0:\n:<math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m \\cong \\R^m \\times \\left\\{(0,\\dots,0)\\right\\} \\subset \\R^m \\times \\R^{N-m} \\cong \\R^N</math>.\nThis process of adjoining trivial copies of Euclidean space is called ''stabilization.''\nOne can thus arrange for any two embeddings into Euclidean space to map into the same Euclidean space (taking <math>N = \\max(m,n)</math>), and, further, if <math>N</math> is sufficiently large, these embeddings are isotopic, which is a theorem.\n\nThus there is a unique stable isotopy class of embedding: it is not a particular embedding (as there are many embeddings), nor an isotopy class (as the target space is not fixed: it is just \"a sufficiently large Euclidean space\"), but rather a stable isotopy class of maps. The normal bundle associated with this (stable class of) embeddings is then the stable normal bundle.\n\nOne can replace this stable isotopy class with an actual isotopy class by fixing the target space, either by using [[Hilbert space]] as the target space, or (for a fixed dimension of manifold <math>n</math>) using a fixed <math>N</math> sufficiently large, as ''N'' depends only on ''n'', not the manifold in question.\n\nMore abstractly, rather than stabilizing the embedding, one can take any embedding, and then take a vector bundle direct sum with a sufficient number of trivial line bundles; this corresponds exactly to the normal bundle of the stabilized embedding.\n\n==Construction via [[classifying space]]s==\nAn ''n''-manifold ''M'' has a tangent bundle, which has a classifying map (up to homotopy)\n:<math>\\tau_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n).</math>\n\nComposing with the inclusion <math>B\\textrm{O}(n) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> yields (the homotopy class of a classifying map of) the stable tangent bundle. The normal bundle of an embedding <math>M \\subset \\R^{n+k}</math> (<math>k</math> large) is an inverse <math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k)</math> for <math>\\tau_M</math>, such that the [[Whitney sum]] <math>\\tau_M\\oplus \\nu_M\n\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n+k)</math> is trivial. The homotopy class of the composite\n<math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> is independent of the choice of inverse, classifying the stable normal bundle <math>\\nu_M</math>.\n\n==Motivation==\nThere is no intrinsic notion of a normal vector to a manifold, unlike tangent or cotangent vectors – for instance, the normal space depends on which dimension one is embedding into – so the stable normal bundle instead provides a notion of a stable normal space: a normal space (and normal vectors) up to trivial summands.\n\nWhy stable normal, instead of stable tangent? Stable normal data is used instead of unstable tangential data because generalizations of manifolds have natural stable normal-type structures, coming from [[tubular neighborhood]]s and generalizations, but not unstable tangential ones, as the local structure is not smooth.\n\nSpherical fibrations over a space ''X'' are classified by the homotopy classes of maps <math>X \\to BG</math> to a\n[[classifying space]] <math>BG</math>, with [[homotopy groups]] the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]\n\n:<math>\\pi_*(BG)=\\pi_{*-1}^S</math>.\n\nThe forgetful map <math>B\\textrm{O} \\to BG</math> extends to a [[fibration]] sequence\n\n:<math>B\\textrm{O} \\to BG \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math>.\n\nA [[Poincaré space]] ''X'' does not have a tangent bundle, but it does have a well-defined stable spherical [[fibration]], which for a differentiable manifold is the spherical fibration associated to the stable normal bundle; thus a primary obstruction to ''X'' having the homotopy type of a differentiable manifold is that the spherical fibration lifts to a vector bundle, i.e., the Spivak spherical fibration <math>X \\to BG</math> must lift to <math>X \\to B\\textrm{O}</math>, which is equivalent to the map <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math> being [[null homotopic]]\nThus the bundle obstruction to the existence of a (smooth) manifold structure is the class <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math>.\nThe secondary obstruction is the Wall [[surgery obstruction]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe stable normal bundle is fundamental in [[surgery theory]] as a primary obstruction:\n*For a [[Poincaré space]] ''X'' to have the homotopy type of a smooth manifold, the map <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math> must be [[null homotopic]]\n*For a homotopy equivalence <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> between two manifolds to be homotopic to a diffeomorphism, it must pull back the stable normal bundle on ''N'' to the stable normal bundle on ''M''.\n\nMore generally, its generalizations serve as replacements for the (unstable) tangent bundle.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n[[Category:Surgery theory]]"

      "text": "In the mathematical  [[surgery theory]] the '''surgery exact sequence''' is the main technical tool to calculate the [[surgery structure set]] of a compact [[manifold]] in dimension <math>>4</math>. The [[surgery structure set]] <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> of a compact <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>X</math> is a [[pointed set]] which classifies <math>n</math>-dimensional manifolds within the homotopy type of <math>X</math>.\n\nThe basic idea is that in order to calculate <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> it is enough to understand the other terms in the sequence, which are usually easier to determine. These are on one hand the [[normal invariants]] which form [[Cohomology#Cohomology theories|generalized cohomology groups]], and hence one can use standard tools of [[algebraic topology]] to calculate them at least in principle. On the other hand, there are the [[L-theory|L-groups]] which are defined algebraically in terms of [[quadratic forms]] or in terms of [[chain complex]]es with quadratic structure. A great deal is known about these groups. Another part of the sequence are the [[surgery obstruction]] maps from normal invariants to the L-groups. For these maps there are certain [[characteristic classes]] formulas, which enable to calculate them in some cases. Knowledge of these three components, that means: the normal maps, the L-groups and the surgery obstruction maps is enough to determine the structure set (at least up to extension problems).\n\nIn practice one has to proceed case by case, for each manifold <math>\\mathcal{} X</math> it is a unique task to determine the surgery exact sequence, see some examples below. Also note that there are versions of the surgery exact sequence depending on the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of manifolds we work with: smooth (DIFF), PL, or [[topological manifold]]s and whether we take [[Whitehead torsion]] into account or not (decorations <math>s</math> or <math>h</math>).\n\nThe original 1962 work of [[William Browder (mathematician)|Browder]] and [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Novikov]] on the existence and uniqueness of manifolds within a [[simply-connected]] homotopy type was reformulated by [[Dennis Sullivan|Sullivan]] in 1966 as a '''surgery exact sequence'''.\nIn 1970 [[C.T.C. Wall|Wall]] developed [[non-simply-connected]] surgery theory and the surgery exact sequence for manifolds with arbitrary [[fundamental group]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe surgery exact sequence is defined as\n\n: <math>\n\\cdots \\to \\mathcal{N}_\\partial (X \\times I) \\to L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X)) \\to \\mathcal{S}(X) \\to \\mathcal{N} (X) \\to L_n (\\pi_1 (X))\n</math>\n\nwhere:\n\nthe entries <math>\\mathcal{N}_\\partial (X \\times I)</math> and <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> are the [[abelian group]]s of [[normal invariants]],\n\nthe entries <math>\\mathcal{} L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X)) </math> and <math>\\mathcal{} L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X)) </math> are the [[L-theory|L-groups]] associated to the [[group ring]] <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\pi_1 (X)]</math>,\n\nthe maps <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}_\\partial (X \\times I) \\to L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> and <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\to L_n (\\pi_1 (X))</math> are the [[surgery obstruction]] maps,\n\nthe arrows <math>\\partial \\colon L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X)) \\to \\mathcal{S}(X)</math> and <math>\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}(X) \\to \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> will be explained below.\n\n==Versions==\nThere are various versions of the surgery exact sequence. One can work in either of the three categories of manifolds: differentiable (smooth), PL, topological. Another possibility is to work with the decorations <math>s</math> or <math>h</math>.\n\n==The entries==\n\n===Normal invariants===\n{{main|Normal invariants}}\n\nA degree one normal map <math>(f,b) \\colon M \\to X</math> consists of the following data: an <math>n</math>-dimensional oriented closed manifold <math>M</math>, a map <math>f</math> which is of degree one (that means <math>f_* ([M]) = [X]</math>, and a bundle map <math>b \\colon TM \\oplus \\varepsilon^k \\to \\xi</math> from the stable tangent bundle of <math>M</math> to some bundle <math>\\xi</math> over <math>X</math>. Two such maps are equivalent if there exists a normal bordism between them (that means a bordism of the sources covered by suitable bundle data). The equivalence classes of degree one normal maps are called '''normal invariants'''.\n\nWhen defined like this the normal invariants <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> are just a pointed set, with the base point given by <math>(id,id)</math>. However the [[Pontrjagin-Thom construction#Framed cobordism|Pontrjagin-Thom]] construction gives <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> a structure of an abelian group. In fact we have a non-natural bijection\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (X) \\cong [X,G/O]</math>\n\nwhere <math>G/O</math> denotes the homotopy fiber of the map <math>J \\colon BO \\to BG</math>, which is an infinite loop space and hence maps into it define a generalized cohomology theory. There are corresponding identifications of the normal invariants with <math>[X,G/PL]</math> when working with PL-manifolds and with <math>[X,G/TOP]</math> when working with topological manifolds.\n\n===L-groups===\n{{main|L-theory}}\n\nThe <math>L</math>-groups are defined algebraically in terms of [[quadratic forms]] or in terms of chain complexes with quadratic structure. See the main article for more details. Here only the properties of the L-groups described below will be important.\n\n===Surgery obstruction maps===\n{{main|Surgery obstruction}}\n\nThe map <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\to L_n (\\pi_1 (X))</math> is in the first instance a set-theoretic map (that means not necessarily a homomorphism) with the following property (when <math>n \\geq 5</math>:\n\nA degree one normal map <math>(f,b) \\colon M \\to X</math> is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence if and only if the image <math>\\theta (f,b)=0</math> in <math>L_n (\\mathbb{Z} [\\pi_1 (X)])</math>.\n\n===The normal invariants arrow <math>\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}(X) \\to \\mathcal{N} (X)</math>===\n\nAny homotopy equivalence <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> defines a degree one normal map.\n\n===The surgery obstruction arrow <math>\\partial \\colon L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X)) \\to \\mathcal{S}(X)</math>===\n\nThis arrow describes in fact an action of the group <math>L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> on the set <math>\\mathcal{S}(X)</math> rather than just a map. The definition is based on the realization theorem for the elements of the <math>L</math>-groups which reads as follows:\n\nLet <math>M</math> be an <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold with <math>\\pi_1 (M) \\cong \\pi_1 (X)</math> and let <math>x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>. Then there exists a degree one normal map of manifolds with boundary\n\n: <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (M \\times I, M \\times 0, M \\times 1)</math>\n\nwith the following properties:\n\n1. <math>\\theta (F,B) = x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>\n\n2. <math>F_0 \\colon M \\to M \\times 0</math> is a diffeomorphism\n\n3. <math>F_1 \\colon M' \\to M \\times 1</math> is a homotopy equivalence of closed manifolds\n\nLet <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> represent an element in <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> and let <math>x \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>. Then <math>\\partial (f,x)</math> is defined as <math>f \\circ F_1 \\colon M' \\to X</math>.\n\n==The exactness==\n\nRecall that the surgery structure set is only a pointed set and that the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta</math> might not be a homomorphism. Hence it is necessary to explain what is meant when talking about the \"exact sequence\". So the surgery exact sequence is an exact sequence in the following sense:\n\nFor a normal invariant <math>z \\in \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> we have <math>z \\in  \\mathrm{Im} (\\eta)</math> if and only if <math>\\theta (z) = 0</math>. For two manifold structures <math>x_1, x_2 \\in \\mathcal{S} (X)</math> we have <math>\\eta (x_1) = \\eta(x_2)</math> if and only if there exists <math>u \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> such that <math>\\partial (u,x_1) = x_2</math>. For an element <math>u \\in L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> we have <math>\\partial (u,\\mathrm{id}) = \\mathrm{id}</math> if and only if <math>u \\in \\mathrm{Im} (\\theta)</math>.\n\n==Versions revisited==\n\nIn the topological category the surgery obstruction map can be made into a homomorphism. This is achieved by putting an alternative abelian group structure on the normal invariants as described [[Normal invariants|here]]. Moreover, the surgery exact sequence can be identified with the algebraic surgery exact sequence of Ranicki which is an exact sequence of abelian groups by definition. This gives the structure set <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math> the structure of an abelian group. Note, however, that there is to this date no satisfactory geometric description of this abelian group structure.\n\n==Classification of manifolds==\nThe answer to the organizing questions of the [[surgery theory]] can be formulated in terms of the surgery exact sequence. In both cases the answer is given in the form of a two-stage obstruction theory.\n\nThe existence question. Let <math>X</math> be a finite Poincaré complex. It is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if the following two conditions are satisfied. Firstly, <math>X</math> must have a vector bundle reduction of its Spivak normal fibration. This condition can be also formulated as saying that the set of normal invariants <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math> is non-empty. Secondly, there must be a normal invariant <math>x \\in \\mathcal{N} (X)</math> such that <math>\\theta (x) = 0</math>. Equivalently, the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta  \\colon \\mathcal{N} (X) \\rightarrow L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> hits <math>0 \\in L_{n} (\\pi_1 (X))</math>.\n\nThe uniqueness question. Let <math>f \\colon M \\to X</math> and <math>f' \\colon M' \\to X</math> represent two elements in the [[surgery structure set]] <math>\\mathcal{S} (X)</math>. The question whether they represent the same element can be answered in two stages as follows. First there must be a normal cobordism between the degree one normal maps induced by <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math>, this means <math>\\mathcal{} \\eta (f) = \\eta (f')</math> in <math>\\mathcal{N} (X)</math>. Denote the normal cobordism <math>(F,B) \\colon (W,M,M') \\to (X \\times I, X \\times 0, X \\times 1)</math>. If the surgery obstruction <math>\\mathcal{} \\theta (F,B)</math> in <math>\\mathcal{} L_{n+1} (\\pi_1 (X))</math> to make this normal cobordism to an [[h-cobordism]] (or [[s-cobordism]]) relative to the boundary vanishes then <math>\\mathcal{} f</math> and <math>\\mathcal{} f'</math> in fact represent the same element in the [[surgery structure set]].\n\n==Examples==\n\n===1. [[Homotopy sphere]]s===\n\nThis is an example in the smooth category, <math>n \\geq 5</math>.\n\nThe idea of the surgery exact sequence is implicitly present already in the original article of Kervaire and Milnor on the groups of homotopy spheres. In the present terminology we have\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Theta^n</math>\n\n<math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n) = \\Omega^{alm}_n</math> the cobordism group of almost framed <math>n</math> manifolds, <math>\\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) = \\Omega^{alm}_{n+1}</math>\n\n<math>L_n (1) =\\mathbb{Z}, 0, \\mathbb{Z}_2, 0</math> where <math>n \\equiv 0,1,2,3</math> mod <math>4</math> (recall the <math>4</math>-periodicity of the [[L-theory|L-groups]])\n\nThe surgery exact sequence in this case is an exact sequence of abelian groups. In addition to the above identifications we have\n\n<math>bP^{n+1} = \\mathrm{ker} (\\eta \\colon \\mathcal{S}^{DIFF} (S^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF} (S^n)) = \\mathrm{coker} (\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{DIFF}_\\partial (S^n \\times I) \\to L_{n+1} (1))</math>\n\nBecause the odd-dimensional L-groups are trivial one obtains these exact sequences:\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i} \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to bP^{4i} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\Theta^{4i-2} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{4i-2} \\to \\mathbb{Z}/2 \\to bP^{4i-2} \\to 0</math>\n\n: <math>0 \\to bP^{2j} \\to \\Theta^{2j-1} \\to \\Omega^{alm}_{2j-1} \\to 0</math>\n\nThe results of Kervaire and Milnor are obtained by studying the middle map in the first two sequences and by relating the groups <math>\\Omega_i^{alm}</math> to stable homotopy theory.\n\n===2. Topological spheres===\n\nThe [[generalized Poincaré conjecture]] in dimension <math>n</math> can be phrased as saying that <math>\\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (S^n) = 0</math>. It has been proved for any <math>n</math> by the work of Smale, Freedman and Perelman. From the surgery exact sequence for <math>S^n</math> for <math>n \\geq 5</math> in the topological category we see that\n\n: <math>\\theta \\colon \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (S^n) \\to L_n (1)</math>\n\nis an isomorphism. (In fact this can be extended to <math>n \\geq 1</math> by some ad-hoc methods.)\n\n===3. Complex [[projective space]]s in the topological category===\n\nThe complex projective space <math>\\mathbb{C} P^n</math> is a <math>(2n)</math>-dimensional topological manifold with <math>\\pi_1 (\\mathbb{C} P^n)=1</math>. In addition it is known that in the case <math>\\pi_1 (X) =1</math> in the topological category the surgery obstruction map <math>\\theta</math> is always surjective. Hence we have\n\n: <math>0 \\to \\mathcal{S}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to \\mathcal{N}^{TOP} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\to L_{2n}(1) \\to 0</math>\n\nFrom the work of Sullivan one can calculate\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{N} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n+1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math> and hence <math>\\mathcal{S} (\\mathbb{C} P^n) \\cong \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor (n-1)/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\oplus_{i=1}^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} \\mathbb{Z}_2</math>\n\n===4. [[Aspherical space|Aspherical]] manifolds in the topological category===\n\nAn aspherical <math>n</math>-dimensional manifold <math>X</math> is an <math>n</math>-manifold such that <math>\\pi_i (X) = 0</math> for <math>i \\geq 2</math>. Hence the only non-trivial homotopy group is <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math>\n\nOne way to state the [[Borel conjecture]] is to say that for such <math>X</math> we have that the [[Whitehead torsion|Whitehead group]] <math>Wh (\\pi_1 (X))</math> is trivial and that\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{S} (X) = 0</math>\n\nThis conjecture was proven in many special cases - for example when <math>\\pi_1 (X)</math> is <math>\\mathbb{Z}^n</math>, when it is the fundamental group of a negatively curved manifold or when it is a word-hyperbolic group or a CAT(0)-group.\n\nThe statement is equivalent to showing that the surgery obstruction map to the right of the surgery structure set is injective and the surgery obstruction map to the left of the surgery structure set is surjective. Most of the proofs of the above-mentioned results are done by studying these maps or by studying the [[assembly map]]s with which they can be identified.

It is a consequence of [[Poincaré duality]] that if we can achieve this for <math>m > \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math> then the map <math>f</math> already is a homotopy equivalence. The word ''systematically'' above refers to the fact that one tries to do surgeries on <math>M</math> to kill elements of <math>\\pi_i (f)</math>. In fact it is more convenient to use [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] of the [[universal cover]]s to observe how connected the map <math>f</math> is. More precisely, one works with the '''surgery kernels''' <math>K_i (\\tilde M) : = \\mathrm{ker} \\{f_* \\colon H_i (\\tilde M) \\rightarrow H_i (\\tilde X)\\}</math> which one views as <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\pi_1 (X)]</math>-modules. If all these vanish, then the map <math>f</math> is a homotopy equivalence. As a consequence of Poincaré duality on <math>M</math> and <math>X</math> there is a <math>\\mathbb{Z}[\\pi_1 (X)]</math>-modules Poincaré duality <math>K^{n-i} (\\tilde M) \\cong K_i (\\tilde M)</math>, so one only has to watch half of them, that means those for which <math>i \\leq \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math>.\n\nAny degree-one normal map can be made <math>\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math>-connected by the process called surgery below the middle dimension. This is the process of killing elements of <math>K_i (\\tilde M)</math> for <math>i < \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math> described [[Surgery theory|here]] when we have <math>p+q = n</math> such that <math>i = p < \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math>. After this is done there are two cases.\n\n1. If <math>n=2k</math> then the only nontrivial homology group is the kernel <math>K_k (\\tilde M) : = \\mathrm{ker} \\{f_* \\colon H_k (\\tilde M) \\rightarrow H_k (\\tilde X)\\}</math>. It turns out that the cup-product pairings on <math>M</math> and <math>X</math> induce a cup-product pairing on <math>K_k(\\tilde M)</math>. This defines a symmetric bilinear form in case <math>k=2l</math> and a skew-symmetric bilinear form in case <math>k=2l+1</math>. It turns out that these forms can be refined to <math>\\varepsilon</math>-quadratic forms, where <math>\\varepsilon = (-1)^k</math>. These <math>\\varepsilon</math>-quadratic forms define elements in the L-groups <math>L_n (\\pi_1 (X))</math>.\n\n2. If <math>n=2k+1</math> the definition is more complicated. Instead of a quadratic form one obtains from the geometry a quadratic formation, which is a kind of automorphism of quadratic forms. Such a thing defines an element in the odd-dimensional L-group <math>L_n (\\pi_1 (X))</math>.\n\nIf the element <math>\\theta (f,b)</math> is zero in the L-group surgery can be done on <math>M</math> to modify <math>f</math> to a homotopy equivalence.\n\nGeometrically the reason why this is not always possible is that performing surgery in the middle dimension to kill an element in <math>K_k (\\tilde M)</math> possibly creates an element in <math>K_{k-1} (\\tilde M)</math> when <math>n = 2k</math> or in <math>K_{k} (\\tilde M)</math> when <math>n=2k+1</math>. So this possibly destroys what has already been achieved. However, if <math>\\theta (f,b)</math> is zero, surgeries can be arranged in such a way that this does not happen.\n\n==Example==\n\nIn the simply connected case the following happens.\n\nIf <math>n = 2k+1</math> there is no obstruction.\n\nIf <math>n = 4l</math> then the surgery obstruction can be calculated as the difference of the signatures of M and X.\n\nIf <math>n = 4l+2</math> then the surgery obstruction is the Arf-invariant of the associated kernel quadratic form over <math>\\mathbb{Z}_2</math>.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Browder | first1=William | title=Surgery on simply-connected manifolds | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York |mr=0358813 | year=1972}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Lück | first1=Wolfgang | title=A basic introduction to surgery theory | url=http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/u/lueck/publ/lueck/ictp.pdf | publisher= ICTP Lecture Notes Series 9, Band 1, of the school \"High-dimensional manifold theory\" in Trieste, May/June 2001, Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics, Trieste 1-224 | year=2002}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Ranicki | first1=Andrew | title=Algebraic and Geometric Surgery | url=http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/books/index.htm  | publisher=Oxford Mathematical Monographs, Clarendon Press | isbn=978-0-19-850924-0 |mr=2061749 | year=2002}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wall | first1=C.

      "text": "In [[geometric topology]], a field within mathematics, the obstruction to a [[homotopy equivalence]] <math>f\\colon X \\to Y</math> of finite [[CW-complex]]es being a [[simple homotopy equivalence]] is its '''Whitehead torsion''' <math>\\tau(f)</math> which is an element in the '''Whitehead group''' <math>\\operatorname{Wh}(\\pi_1(Y))</math>. These concepts are named after the mathematician [[J. H. C. Whitehead]].\n\nThe Whitehead torsion is important in applying [[surgery theory]] to non-[[simply connected]] [[manifold]]s of dimension&nbsp;>&nbsp;4: for simply-connected manifolds, the Whitehead group vanishes, and thus homotopy equivalences and simple homotopy equivalences are the same. The applications are to differentiable manifolds, PL manifolds and topological manifolds. The proofs were first obtained in the early 1960s by [[Stephen Smale]], for differentiable manifolds. The development of [[handlebody]] theory allowed much the same proofs in the differentiable and PL categories. The proofs are much harder in the topological category, requiring the theory of [[Robion Kirby]] and [[Laurent C. Siebenmann]]. The restriction to manifolds of dimension >4 are due to the application of the [[Whitney trick]] for removing double points.\n\nIn generalizing the [[h-cobordism|''h''-cobordism]] theorem, which is a statement about simply connected manifolds, to non-simply connected manifolds, one must distinguish simple homotopy equivalences and non-simple homotopy equivalences. While an ''h''-cobordism ''W'' between simply-connected closed connected manifolds ''M'' and ''N'' of dimension ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;4 is isomorphic to a cylinder (the corresponding homotopy equivalence can be taken to be a diffeomorphism, PL-isomorphism, or homeomorphism, respectively), the [[s-cobordism theorem|''s''-cobordism theorem]] states that if the manifolds are not simply-connected, an ''h''-cobordism is a cylinder if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion <math>M \\hookrightarrow W</math> vanishes.\n\n==Whitehead group==\nThe '''Whitehead group''' of a connected CW-complex or a manifold ''M'' is equal to the Whitehead group <math>\\operatorname{Wh}(\\pi_1(M))</math> of the [[fundamental group]] <math>\\pi_1(M)</math> of ''M''.\n\nIf ''G'' is a group, the '''Whitehead group''' <math>\\operatorname{Wh}(G)</math> is defined to be the [[cokernel]] of the map ''G'' × {±1} → K<sub>1</sub>('''Z'''[''G'']) which sends (''g'',±1) to the invertible (1,1)-matrix (±''g''). Here '''Z'''[''G''] is the [[group ring]] of ''G''. Recall that the [[Algebraic K-theory#K1|K-group]] K<sub>1</sub>(''A'') of a ring ''A'' is defined as the quotient of GL(A) by the subgroup generated by [[elementary matrices]]. The group GL(''A'') is the [[direct limit]] of the finite-dimensional groups GL(''n'', ''A'') → GL(''n''+1, ''A''); concretely, the group of invertible infinite matrices which differ from the identity matrix in only a finite number of coefficients. An [[elementary matrix]] here is a [[Shear matrix|transvection]]: one such that all [[main diagonal]] elements are 1 and there is at most one non-zero element not on the diagonal. The subgroup generated by elementary matrices is exactly the [[derived subgroup]], in other words the smallest normal subgroup such that the quotient by it is abelian.\n\nIn other words, the Whitehead group <math>\\operatorname{Wh}(G)</math> of a group ''G'' is the quotient of <math>\\operatorname{GL}(\\mathbb{Z}[G])</math> by the subgroup generated by elementary matrices, elements of ''G'' and <math>\\pm 1</math>. Notice that this is the same as the quotient of the reduced K-group <math>{\\tilde K}_1(\\mathbf{Z}[G])</math> by ''G''.\n\n==Examples==\n*The Whitehead group of the [[trivial group]] is trivial. Since the group ring of the trivial group is '''Z''', we have to show that any matrix can be written as a product of elementary matrices times a diagonal matrix; this follows easily from the fact that '''Z''' is a [[Euclidean domain]].\n*The Whitehead group of a [[free abelian group]] is trivial, a 1964 result of [[Hyman Bass]], Alex Heller and [[Richard Swan]]. This is quite hard to prove, but is important as it is used in the proof that an ''s''-cobordism of dimension at least 6 whose ends are [[torus|tori]] is a product. It is also the key algebraic result used in the [[surgery theory]] classification of [[piecewise linear manifold|piecewise linear]] [[manifolds]] of dimension at least 5 which are homotopy equivalent to a [[torus]]; this is the essential ingredient of the 1969 Kirby–Siebenmann structure theory of [[topological manifold]]s of dimension at least 5.\n*The Whitehead group of a [[braid group]] (or any subgroup of a braid group) is trivial. This was proved by [[F. Thomas Farrell]] and Sayed K. Roushon.\n*The Whitehead group of the [[cyclic group]]s of orders 2, 3, 4, and 6 are trivial.\n*The Whitehead group of the cyclic group of order 5 is '''Z'''. This was proved in 1940 by [[Graham Higman]]. An example of a non-trivial unit  in the group ring is (1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t''<sup>4</sup>)(1&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''t''<sup>3</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, where ''t'' is a generator of the cyclic group of order&nbsp;5. This example is closely related to the existence of units of infinite order (in particular, the [[golden ratio]]) in the ring of integers of the cyclotomic field generated by fifth roots of unity.\n*The Whitehead group of any finite group ''G'' is finitely generated, of rank equal to the number of irreducible [[real representation]]s of ''G'' minus the number of irreducible [[rational representation]]s. this was proved in 1965 by Bass.\n* If ''G'' is a finite abelian group then K<sub>1</sub>('''Z'''[''G'']) is isomorphic to the units of the group ring '''Z'''[''G''] under the determinant map, so Wh(''G'') is just the group of units of '''Z'''[''G''] modulo the group of \"trivial units\" generated by elements of ''G'' and &minus;1.\n* It is a well-known conjecture that the Whitehead group of any torsion-free group should vanish.\n\n==The Whitehead torsion==\nAt first we define the '''Whitehead torsion''' <math>\\tau(h_*) \\in {\\tilde K}_1(R)</math> for a chain homotopy equivalence <math>h_*\\colon D_* \\to E_*</math> of finite based free ''R''-chain complexes. We can assign to the homotopy equivalence its [[Mapping cone (homological algebra)|mapping cone]] C<sub>*</sub> := cone<sub>*</sub>(h<sub>*</sub>) which is a contractible finite based free ''R''-chain complex. Let <math>\\gamma_*\\colon C_* \\to C_{*+1}</math> be any chain contraction of the mapping cone, i.e., <math>c_{n+1} \\circ \\gamma_n + \\gamma_{n-1} \\circ c_n = \\operatorname{id}_{C_n}</math> for all ''n''. We obtain an isomorphism <math>(c_* + \\gamma_*)_\\mathrm{odd}: C_\\mathrm{odd} \\to C_\\mathrm{even}</math> with \n\n:<math>C_\\mathrm{odd} := \\bigoplus_{n \\text{ odd}} C_n,\\quad C_\\mathrm{even} := \\bigoplus_{n \\text{ even}} \\, C_n</math>. \n\nWe define <math>\\tau(h_*) := [A] \\in {\\tilde K}_1(R)</math>, where ''A'' is the matrix of <math>(c_* + \\gamma_*)_{\\rm odd}</math> with respect to the given bases.\n\nFor a homotopy equivalence <math>f\\colon X\\to Y</math> of connected finite CW-complexes we define the '''Whitehead torsion''' <math>\\tau(f) \\in \\operatorname{Wh}(\\pi_1(Y))</math> as follows. Let <math>{\\tilde f}: {\\tilde X} \\to {\\tilde Y}</math> be the lift of ƒ: ''X'' → ''Y'' to the universal covering. It induces '''Z'''[π<sub>1</sub>(''Y'')]-chain homotopy equivalences <math>C_*({\\tilde f}): C_*({\\tilde X}) \\to C_*({\\tilde Y})</math>. Now we can apply the definition of the Whitehead torsion for a chain homotopy equivalence and obtain an element in <math>{\\tilde K}_1(\\mathbf{Z}[\\pi_1(Y)])</math> which we map to Wh(π<sub>1</sub>(''Y'')). This is the Whitehead torsion τ(ƒ) ∈ Wh(π<sub>1</sub>(''Y'')).\n\n==Properties==\nHomotopy invariance: Let ƒ, ''g'': ''X'' → ''Y'' be homotopy equivalences of finite connected CW-complexes. If ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are homotopic then ''τ''(''ƒ'') = ''τ''(''g'').\n\nTopological invariance: If ƒ: ''X'' → ''Y'' is a homeomorphism of finite connected CW-complexes then ''τ''(''ƒ'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nComposition formula: Let ƒ: ''X'' → ''Y'', ''g'': ''Y'' → ''Z'' be homotopy equivalences of finite connected CW-complexes. Then <math>\\tau(g \\circ f) = g_* \\tau(f) + \\tau(g)</math>.\n\n==Geometric interpretation==\nThe [[s-cobordism theorem]] states for a closed connected oriented manifold ''M'' of dimension ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;4 that an [[h-cobordism]] ''W'' between ''M'' and another manifold ''N'' is trivial over ''M'' if and only if the Whitehead torsion of the inclusion ''M'' <math>\\hookrightarrow</math> ''W'' vanishes. Moreover, for any element in the Whitehead group there exists an h-cobordism ''W'' over ''M'' whose Whitehead torsion is the considered element. The proofs use [[handle decomposition]]s.\n\nThere exists a homotopy theoretic analogue of the s-cobordism theorem. Given a [[CW-complex]] ''A'', consider the set of all pairs of CW-complexes (''X'',''A'') such that the inclusion of ''A'' into ''X'' is a homotopy equivalence. Two pairs (''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''A'') and (''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''A'') are said to be equivalent, if there is a [[simple homotopy equivalence]] between ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> relative to ''A''. The set of such equivalence classes form a group where the addition is given by taking union of ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> with common subspace ''A''. This group is natural isomorphic to the Whitehead group Wh(''A'') of the CW-complex ''A''. The proof of this fact is similar to the proof of [[s-cobordism theorem]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Algebraic K-theory]]\n*[[Reidemeister torsion]]\n*[[s-Cobordism theorem]]\n*[[Wall's finiteness obstruction]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last1=Bass|first1= Hyman|authorlink1=Hyman Bass|last2=Heller|first2= Alex|last3=Swan|first3= Richard| authorlink3=Richard Swan| title=The Whitehead group of a polynomial extension|journal= [[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]]|volume= 22|year= 1964|pages= 61–79|mr=0174605|url= http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1964__22__61_0}}\n*Cohen, M.

It encodes the information of relation: an element ''a'' is related to an element ''b'' if and only if the pair (''a'', ''b'') belongs to the set.\n\nAn example is the \"[[divides]]\" relation over the set of [[prime number]]s '''P''' and the set of [[integer]]s '''Z''', in which each prime ''p'' is related to each integer ''z'' that is a [[Divisibility|multiple]] of ''p'', but not to an integer that is not a multiple of ''p''. In this relation, for instance, the prime 2 is related to numbers that include −4, 0, 6, 10, but not 1 or 9; and the prime 3 is related to numbers that include 0, 6, and 9, but not 4 or 13.\n\nBinary relations are used in many branches of mathematics to model concepts like \"[[Inequality (mathematics)|is greater than]]\", \"[[Equality (mathematics)|is equal to]]\", and \"divides\" in [[arithmetic]], \"[[Congruence (geometry)|is congruent to]]\" in [[geometry]], \"is adjacent to\" in [[graph theory]], \"is [[orthogonal]] to\" in [[linear algebra]] and many more. A [[Function (mathematics)|function]] may be defined as a special kind of binary relation. Binary relations are also heavily used in [[computer science]].\n\nA binary relation is the special case {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} of an [[finitary relation|''n''-ary relation]] {{nowrap|''R'' ⊆ ''A''<sub>1</sub> × ⋯ × ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, that is, a set of [[tuple|''n''-tuple]]s where the ''j''th component of each ''n''-tuple is taken from the ''j''th domain ''A''<sub>''j''</sub> of the relation. An example for a ternary relation over '''Z''' is \"… lies between… and …\", containing e.g., the triples {{nowrap|(5, 2, 8)}}, {{nowrap|(5, 8, 2)}}, and {{nowrap|(−4, 9, −7)}}.\n\nA binary relation over ''A'' and ''B'' is an element in the [[power set]] on {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}. Since the latter set is ordered by [[Inclusion (set theory)|inclusion]] (⊂), each relation has a place in the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of subsets of {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}}. A binary relation over the same set is also called a homogeneous relation (and a binary relation is sometimes called a [[heterogeneous relation]] to emphasize the fact it is not necessarily homogeneous). An example of a homogeneous relation is a [[kinship]] where the relations are over people. Homogeneous relation may be viewed as [[directed graph]]s, and in the symmetric case as ordinary [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s. Homogeneous relations also encompass [[Order theory|orderings]] as well as [[partitions of a set]] (called equivalence relations).\n\nAs part of [[set theory]], relations are manipulated with the [[algebra of sets]], including [[complement (set theory)|complementation]]. Furthermore, the two sets are considered symmetrically by introduction of the [[converse relation]] which exchanges their places. Another operation is [[composition of relations]]. Altogether these tools form the [[calculus of relations]], for which there are [[textbook]]s by [[Ernst Schröder]], [[Clarence Lewis]], and [[Gunther Schmidt]]. A deeper analysis of relations involves decomposing them into [[subset]]s called ''concepts'' and placing them in a [[complete lattice]].\n\nIn some systems of [[axiomatic set theory]], relations are extended to [[Class (mathematics)|classes]], which are generalizations of sets. This extension is needed for, among other things, modeling the concepts of \"is an element of\" or \"is a subset of\" in [[set theory]], without running into logical inconsistencies such as [[Russell's paradox]].\n\nThe terms '''correspondence''',<!---keep boldface: [[Correspondence (mathematics)]] redirects here---><ref>Jacobson, Nathan (2009), Basic Algebra II (2nd ed.) § 2.1.</ref> '''dyadic relation'''<!---[[Dyadic relation]]---> and '''two-place relation'''<!---[[Two-place relation]]---> are synonyms for binary relation. But some authors use the term \"binary relation\" for any subset of a Cartesian product {{nowrap|''A'' × ''B''}} without the reference to ''A'' and ''B'' while the term \"correspondence\" is reserved for a binary relation with the reference to ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n== Definition ==\nGiven two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', there is the set called the [[Cartesian product]] {{nowrap begin}}''X'' × ''Y'' = {(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X'' and ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}{{nowrap end}}, whose elements are called [[ordered pair]]s.\n\nA binary relation ''R'' from ''X'' to ''Y'' is a subset of {{nowrap|''X'' × ''Y''}}; that is, it is a set of ordered pairs {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} consisting of elements {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} and {{nowrap|''y'' ∈ ''Y''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Enderton|1977|loc=Ch 3. pg. 40}}</ref><ref group=note>the set ''R'' is also sometimes called the graph of the relation ''R''.</ref> The set ''X'' is called the ''set of departure'' and the set ''Y'' the ''set of destination'' or ''[[codomain]]''.

For example, restricting the relation \"''x'' is parent of ''y''\" to females yields the relation \"''x'' is mother of the woman ''y''\"; its transitive closure doesn't relate a woman with her paternal grandmother. On the other hand, the transitive closure of \"is parent of\" is \"is ancestor of\"; its restriction to females does relate a woman with her paternal grandmother.\n\nAlso, the various concepts of [[completeness (order theory)|completeness]] (not to be confused with being \"total\") do not carry over to restrictions. For example, over the [[real number]]s a property of the relation ≤ is that every [[empty set|non-empty]] subset ''S'' of '''R''' with an [[upper bound]] in '''R''' has a [[supremum|least upper bound]] (also called supremum) in '''R'''. However, for the rational numbers this supremum is not necessarily rational, so the same property does not hold on the restriction of the relation ≤ to the rational numbers.\n\nThe ''left-restriction'' (''right-restriction'', respectively) of a binary relation over two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' to a subset ''S'' of its domain (codomain) is the set of all pairs {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the relation for which ''x'' (''y'') is an element of ''S''.\n\n=== Matrix representation ===\nBinary relations over two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' can be represented algebraically by matrices indexed by ''X'' and ''Y'' with entries in the [[Boolean semiring]] (addition corresponds to OR and multiplication to AND), [[matrix addition]] corresponds to union of relations, [[matrix multiplication]] corresponds to composition of relations (of a relation over ''X'' and ''Y'' and a relation over ''Y'' and ''Z''),<ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=quantum mechanics over a commutative rig |author=[[John C.

For example, if we try to model the general concept of \"equality\" as a binary relation =, we must take the domain and codomain to be the \"class of all sets\", which is not a set in the usual set theory.\n\nIn most mathematical contexts, references to the relations of equality, membership and subset are harmless because they can be understood implicitly to be restricted to some set in the context. The usual work-around to this problem is to select a \"large enough\" set ''A'', that contains all the objects of interest, and work with the restriction =<sub>''A''</sub> instead of =. Similarly, the \"subset of\" relation ⊆ needs to be restricted to have domain and codomain P(''A'') (the power set of a specific set ''A''): the resulting set relation can be denoted ⊆<sub>''A''</sub>. Also, the \"member of\" relation needs to be restricted to have domain ''A'' and codomain P(''A'') to obtain a binary relation ∈<sub>''A''</sub> that is a set. Bertrand Russell has shown that assuming ∈ to be defined over all sets leads to a [[Russell's paradox|contradiction]] in naive set theory.\n\nAnother solution to this problem is to use a set theory with proper classes, such as [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory|NBG]] or [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], and allow the domain and codomain (and so the graph) to be [[proper class]]es: in such a theory, equality, membership, and subset are binary relations without special comment. (A minor modification needs to be made to the concept of the ordered triple {{nowrap|(''X'', ''Y'', ''G'')}}, as normally a proper class cannot be a member of an ordered tuple; or of course one can identify the binary relation with its graph in this context.)<ref>{{cite book |title=A formalization of set theory without variables |last1=Tarski |first1=Alfred |authorlink=Alfred Tarski|last2=Givant |first2=Steven |year=1987 |page=3 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |isbn=0-8218-1041-3}}</ref> With this definition one can for instance define a binary relation over every set and its power set.\n\n== Homogeneous relation ==\n\nA '''homogeneous relation'''<!---keep boldface: [[Homogeneous relation]] redirects to here---> (also called '''endorelation'''<!---[[endorelation]]--->) over a set ''X'' is a binary relation over the set ''X'' and itself, i.e. it is a subset of the Cartesian product {{nowrap|''X'' × ''X''}}.<ref name=\"Winter2007\">{{cite book|author=Michael Winter|title=Goguen Categories: A Categorical Approach to L-fuzzy Relations|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-6164-6|pages=x-xi}}</ref><ref name=\"Müller2012\">{{cite book|author=M.

      "text": "{{Expert needed|logic|reason=inaccurate, partly wrong, presentation|date=November 2016}}\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2016}}\nIn [[modal logic]], an '''accessibility relation''' <math>R</math> is a [[binary relation]] such that <math>R \\subseteq W \\times W </math>  where <math> W </math> is a set of [[possible world]]s. The accessibility relation determines for each world <math> w \\in W </math> which worlds <math>w'</math> are accessible from <math>w</math>. If a possible world <math>w'</math> is accessible from <math>w</math> we usually write <math>wRw'</math> (or sometimes <math>Rww'</math>).\n\n==Description of terms==\n\nA '''statement''' in logic refers to a sentence (with a subject, predicate, and verb) that can be true or false. So, 'The room is cold' is a statement because it contains a subject, predicate and verb, and it can be true that 'the room is cold' or false that 'the room is cold.'\n\nGenerally, commands, beliefs and sentences about probabilities aren't judged as true or false. \"Inhale and exhale\" is therefore not a statement in logic because it is a command and cannot be true or false, although a person can obey or refuse that command. \"I believe I can fly or I can't fly\" isn't taken as a statement of truth or falsity, because beliefs don't say anything about the truth or falsity of the parts of the entire \"and\" or \"or\" statement and therefore the entire \"and\" or \"or\" statement.\n  \nA '''possible world''' is a possible situation. In every case, a possible world is contrasted with an actual situation. Earth one minute from now is a \"possible world\". Earth as it is actually {{Not a typo|is is}} also a \"possible world\". Hence the oddity of and controversy in contrasting a \"possible\" world with an \"actual\" world (Earth is necessarily possible). In logic, \"worlds\" are described as a non-empty set, where the set could consist of anything, depending on what the statement says.\n\n'''Modal logic''' is a description of the reasoning in making statements about possibility or necessity. \"It is possible that it rains tomorrow\" is a statement in modal logic, because it is a statement about possibility. \"It is necessary that it rains tomorrow\" also counts as a statement in modal logic, because it is a statement about \"necessity\". There are at least six logical axioms or principles that show what people mean whenever they make statements about necessity or possibility (described below).<ref>For a detailed explanation on modal logic, see [http://videolectures.net/ssll09_gore_iml/ here].</ref>\n\nAs described in greater detail below:\n\n'''Necessarily''' <small><math>p</math></small> means that <small><math>p</math></small> is true at '''every''' 'possible world' <small><math>w</math></small> such that <small><math>R(w^*,w).</math></small>\n\n'''Possibly''' <small><math>p</math></small> means that <small><math>p</math></small> is true at '''some''' possible world <small><math>w</math></small> such that <small><math>R(w^*,w)</math></small>.\n\n'''Truth-value''' is whether a statement is true or false. Whether or not a statement is true, in turn, depends on the meanings of words, laws of logic, or experience (observation, hearing, etc.).\n\n'''Formal Semantics''' refers to the meaning of statements written in symbols. The sentence <small><math>(\\Box p \\lor \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\lor q)</math></small>, for example, is a statement about 'necessity' in 'formal semantics.' It has a meaning that can be represented by the symbol <small><math>R</math>.</small> \n \nThe '''accessibility relation''' is a relationship between two 'possible worlds.' More precisely<sup>please clarify definition</sup>, the ''''accessibility relation'''' is the idea that modal statements, like 'it's possible that it rains tomorrow,' may not take the same [[truth-value]] in all 'possible worlds.' \nOn earth, the statement could be true or false. By contrast, in a planet where water is non-existent, this statement will always be false.\n\nDue to the difficulty in judging if a modal statement is true in every 'possible world,' logicians have derived certain axioms or principles that show ''on what basis'' ''any'' statement is true in ''any'' 'possible world.' These axioms describing the relationship between 'possible worlds' is the 'accessibility relation' in detail.\n\nPut another way, these modal axioms describe in detail the 'accessibility relation,' <small><math>R</math></small> between two 'worlds.' That relation, <math>R</math> symbolizes that from any given 'possible world' some ''other'' 'possible worlds' may be ''accessible,'' and others may not be.  \n \nThe '''accessibility relation''' has important uses in both the formal/theoretical aspects of [[modal logic]] (theories about 'modal logic'). It also has applications to a variety of disciplines including [[epistemology]] (theories about how people know something is true or false), [[metaphysics]] (theories about reality), [[value theory]] (theories about morality and ethics), and [[computer science]] (theories about programmatic manipulation of data).\n\n==Propositional modal logic==\n\nThe reasoning behind the 'accessibility relation' uses the basics of 'propositional modal logic' (see [[modal logic]] for a detailed discussion). 'Propositional modal logic' is traditional [[propositional logic]] with the addition of two key unary operators:\n\n'''<math>\\Box </math>''' symbolizes the phrase ''''It is necessary that'''...'\n\n'''<math>\\Diamond</math>''' symbolizes the phrase ''''It is possible that'''...'\n\nThese operators can be attached to a single sentence to form a new compound sentence.\n\nFor example, '''<math>\\Box </math>''' can be attached to a sentence such as 'I walk outside.' \nThe new sentence would look like: '''<math>\\Box </math>''''I walk outside.' \nThe entire ''new'' sentence would therefore read: 'It is necessary that I walk outside.'\n\nBut the symbol <math>A</math> can be used to stand for any sentence instead of writing out entire sentences. So any sentence such as 'I walk outside' or 'I walk outside ''and'' I look around' are symbolized by <math>A</math>.\n\nThus for any sentence <math>A</math> (simple or compound), the compound sentences <math>\\Box A</math> and <math>\\Diamond A</math> can be formed. Sentences such as 'It is necessary that I walk outside' or 'It is possible that I walk outside' would therefore look like '''<math>\\Box </math>'''<math>A</math> and <math>\\Diamond A</math>, respectively.\n\nHowever, the symbols <math>p</math>, <math>q</math> can also be used to stand for any statement of our language. For example, <math>p</math> can stand for 'I walk outside' or 'I walk outside and I look around.' The sentence 'It is necessary that I walk outside' would look like: '''<math>\\Box </math>'''<math>q</math>. The sentence 'It is possible that I walk outside' would look like: '''<math>\\Diamond</math>'''<math>q</math>.\n\n'''Six Basic Axioms of Modal Logic''':\n\nThere are at least six basic axioms or principles of almost all modal logics or steps in thinking/reasoning. The first two hold in all [[regular modal logic]]s, and the last holds in all [[normal modal logic]]s.\n\n'''1st Modal Axiom''':\n\n* <math>\\Box p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Diamond \\lnot p</math> (Duality)\n\nThe double arrow stands symbolizes ''''if and only if,'''' 'necessary and sufficient' conditions. A 'necessary' condition is something that must be the case for something else. Being literate, for instance, is a 'necessary' condition for ''reading'' about the 'accessibility relation.'  A 'sufficient condition' a condition that is good enough for something else. Being literate, for instance, is a 'sufficient' condition for learning about the accessibility relation.' In other words, it is enough to be literate in order to ''learn'' about the 'accessibility relation,' but may not be 'necessary' because the relation could be learned in different ways (such as through speech). Aside from 'necessary and sufficient,' the double arrow represents equivalence between the meaning of two statements, the statement to the left and the statement to the right of the double arrow.\n\nThe half square symbols before the diamond and <math>p</math> symbol in the sentence '<math>\\Box p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Diamond \\lnot p</math>' stand for 'it is not the case, or 'not.'\n\nThe <math>p</math> symbol stands for any statement such as 'I walk outside.' Therefore, it could also stand for 'The apple is Red.'\n\n'''Example 1''':\n\nThe first principle says that any statement involving 'necessity' on the left side of the double arrow is equivalent to the statement about the negation of 'possibility' on the right.\n\nSo using the symbols and their meaning, the first modal axiom, <math>\\Box p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Diamond \\lnot p</math> could stand for: 'It's necessary that I walk outside if and only if it's not possible that it is not the case that I walk outside.'\n\nAnd when I say that 'It's necessary that I walk outside,' this is the same as saying that 'It's not possible that it is not the case that I walk outside.' Furthermore, when I say that 'It's not possible that it is not the case that I walk outside,' this is the same as saying that 'It's necessary that I walk outside.'\n\n'''Example 2''':\n\n<math>p</math> stands for 'The apple is red.'\n\nSo using the symbols and their meaning described above, the first modal axiom, <math>\\Box p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Diamond \\lnot p</math> could stand for: 'It's necessary that the apple is red if and only if it's not possible that it is not the case that the apple is red.'\n\nAnd when I say that 'It's necessary that the apple is red,' this is the same as saying that 'It's not possible that it is not the case that the apple is red.' Furthermore, when I say that 'It's not possible that it is not the case that the apple is red,' this is the same as saying that 'It's necessary that the apple is red.'\n\n'''Second Modal Axiom''':\n\n* <math>\\Diamond p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Box \\lnot p</math> (Duality)\n\n'''Example 1''':\n\nThe second principle says that any statement involving 'possibility' on the left side of the double arrow is the same as the statement about the negation of 'necessity' on the right.\n\n<math>p</math> stands for 'Spring has not arrived.'\n\nUsing the symbols and their meaning described above, the second modal axiom, <math>\\Diamond p \\leftrightarrow \\lnot \\Box \\lnot p</math> could stand for: 'It's possible that Spring has not arrived if and only if it is not the case that it is necessary that it is not the case that Spring has not arrived.'\n\nEssentially, the second axiom says that any statement about possibility called 'X' is the same as a negation or denial of a different statement about necessity 'Y.' The statement about necessity shows the denial of the same original statement 'X.'\n\nThe other axioms can be read and interpreted in the same way, by substituting letters <math>p</math> for any statement and following the reasoning. Brackets in a symbolized sentence mean that anything inside the brackets counts as a whole sentence. Any symbol before the brackets therefore applies to the sentence as a whole, not just the letters or an individual sentence.\n\nAn arrow stands for \"then\" where the left statement before the arrow is the \"if\" of the entire sentence.\n  \n'''Other Modal Axioms''':\n\n<small>* <math>\\Box (p \\land q) \\leftrightarrow (\\Box p \\land \\Box q)</math></small>\n\n<small>* <math>(\\Box p \\lor \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\lor q)</math></small>\n\n<small>* <math>\\Box (p \\to q) \\to (\\Box p \\to \\Box q)</math></small> (Kripke property)\n\nMost of the other ''axioms'' concerning the modal operators are dependent on the specialization of the modal logic. Here are the most commonly used and discussed of these:\n\n:: <big><small>(T)</big> <math>\\Box p \\rightarrow p</math></small>\n\n:: <big><small>(4)</big> <math>\\Box p \\rightarrow \\Box \\Box p</math></small>\n\n:: <big><small>(5)</big> <math>\\Diamond p \\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond p</math></small>\n\n:: <big><small>(B)</big> <math>p \\rightarrow \\Box \\Diamond p</math></small>\n\nHere, \"(T)\",\"(4)\",\"(5)\", and \"(B)\" represent the traditional names of these axioms (or principles).\n\nAccording to the traditional 'possible worlds' semantics of modal logic, the compound sentences that are formed out of the modal operators are to be [[interpretation (logic)|interpreted]] in terms of quantification over possible worlds, subject to the relation of accessibility. A sentence like <small><math>(\\Box p \\lor \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\lor q)</math></small> is to be interpreted as true or false in ''all'' or ''some'' 'possible worlds.' In turn, the grounds on which the sentence is true (symmetry, transitive property, etc.) in all 'possible worlds' is the 'accessibility relation.'\n\nThe relation of accessibility can now be defined as an (uninterpreted) relation <small><math>R(w_1,w_2)</math></small> that holds between 'possible worlds' <small><math>w_1</math></small> and <small><math>w_2</math></small> only when <small><math>w_2</math></small> is accessible from <small><math>w_1</math></small>.\n\nAdditionally, to make things more specific, any formula, axiom like <small><math>(\\Box p \\lor \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\lor q)</math></small> can be translated into a formula of [[first-order logic]] through [[standard translation]]. That first-order logic formula or sentence makes the meaning of the boxes and diamonds in modal logic explicit.\n\n==Some common accessibility relation conditions==\n\n''''Formal semantics'''' studies the meaning of statements written in symbols. The sentence <small><math>(\\Box p \\lor \\Box q) \\rightarrow \\Box (p \\lor q)</math></small>, for example, is a statement about 'necessity' in 'formal semantics.' It has a meaning that can be represented by the symbol <small><math>R</math>,</small> where <small><math>R</math></small> takes the form of the 'necessity relation' described below.\n\nSo, the 'accessibility relation,' <small><math>R</math></small> can take on at least four forms, that is, the 'accessibility relation' can be described in at least four ways.\n\nEach type is either about 'possibility' or 'necessity' where 'possibility' and 'necessity' is defined as:\n\n*(TS) '''Necessarily''' <small><math>p</math></small> means that <small><math>p</math></small> is true at '''every''' 'possible world' <small><math>w</math></small> such that <small><math>R(w^*,w)</math></small>.\n* '''Possibly''' <small><math>p</math></small> means that <small><math>p</math></small> is true at '''some''' possible world <small><math>w</math></small> such that <small><math>R(w^*,w)</math>.</small>\n\nThe four types of <small><math>R</math></small> will be a variation of these two general types. They will specify on what conditions a statement is true either in every possible world, or some possible. The four specific types of <small><math>R</math></small> are:\n\n'''Reflexive''', or *Axiom (T) above:\n\nIf <small><math>R</math></small> is [[binary relation#Relations over a set|reflexive]], every world is accessible to itself. Reflexivity guarantees that any world at which <math>A</math> is true is a world from which there is an accessible world at which <math>A</math> is true, and thus <math>A</math> is possible at worlds where it's true, which isn't necessarily the case in worlds that aren't accessible to themselves. Without the reflexivity condition, <math>A</math> can be necessary at a world where it's false, if that world isn't accessible to itself; thus axiom T—that <small><math>\\Box A</math></small> at a world implies <math>A</math> is true at that world—follows from reflexivity.\n\n'''Transitive''', or *Axiom (4) above:\n\nIf <small><math>R</math></small> is transitive, any world accessible to any world <small><math>w'</math></small> accessible to world <small><math>w</math></small> is also accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>. Transitively, <small><math>\\Box A</math></small> is true at a world <small><math>w</math></small> only when <small><math>A</math></small> is true at every world <small><math>w'</math></small> accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>, including every world <small><math>w''</math></small> accessible to any <small><math>w'</math></small>, and every world accessible to any <small><math>w''</math></small>, etc., so when <small><math>\\Box A</math></small> is true at <small><math>w</math></small>, it’s also true at every <small><math>w'</math></small> and every <small><math>w''</math></small>, etc., which means <small><math>\\Box\\Box A</math></small> is also true at <small><math>w</math></small>, which is axiom 4.\n\n'''Euclidean''' or *Axiom (5) above:\n\nIf <small><math>R</math></small> is [[euclidean relation|euclidean]], any two worlds accessible to a given world are accessible to each other. <math>\\Box \\Diamond A</math></small> is true at a world <small><math>w</math></small> if and only if, for every world <small><math>w'</math></small> accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>, there is a world <small><math>w''</math></small> accessible to <small><math>w'</math></small> at which <small><math>A</math></small> is true. If <small><math>A</math></small> is true at a world <small><math>w'</math></small> accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>, then if that world is accessible to every other world accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>, it will be true that for every world accessible to <small><math>w</math></small> there is an accessible world (<small><math>w'</math></small>) at which <small><math>A</math></small> is true, so <math>\\Diamond A</math></small> is true at all worlds accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>. The euclidean property thus entails that <math>\\Diamond A</math></small> implies <math>\\Box \\Diamond A</math></small>, which is axiom 5.\n\n'''Symmetric''' or *Axiom (B) above:\n\nIf <small><math>R</math></small> is symmetric, then if world <small><math>w'</math></small> is accessible to world <small><math>w</math></small>, <small><math>w</math></small> is accessible to <small><math>w'</math></small>. If <small><math>A</math></small> is true at <small><math>w</math></small>, then at every <small><math>w'</math></small> accessible to <small><math>w</math></small>, there is a world (<small><math>w</math></small>) accessible to <small><math>w'</math></small> at which <small><math>A</math></small> is true, so <small><math>A</math></small> is possible at ''all'' <small><math>w'</math></small>, and thus it's necessary at <small><math>w</math></small> that <small><math>A</math></small> is possible, which is axiom B.\n\n==Philosophical applications==\n\nOne of the applications of 'possible worlds' semantics and the 'accessibility relation' is to physics. Instead of just talking generically about 'necessity (or [[logical truth|logical necessity]]),' the relation in physics deals with 'nomological necessity.' The fundamental translational schema (TS) described earlier can be exemplified as follows for physics:\n\n*(TSN) <math>P</math> is nomologically necessary means that <math>P</math> is true at all possible worlds that are nomologically accessible from the actual world. In other words, <math>P</math> is true at all possible worlds that obey the physical laws of the actual world.\n\nThe interesting thing to observe is that instead of having to ask, now, \"Does nomological necessity satisfy the axiom (5)?\", that is, \"Is something that is nomologically possible nomologically necessarily possible?\", we can ask instead: \"Is the nomological accessibility relation euclidean?\" And different theories of the nature of physical laws will result in different answers to this question. (Notice however that if the objection raised earlier is true, each different theory of the nature of physical laws would be 'possible' and 'necessary,' since the euclidean concept depends on the idea about 'possibility' and 'necessity'). The theory of Lewis, for example, is asymmetric. His [[counterpart theory]] also requires an intransitive relation of accessibility because it is based on the notion of similarity and similarity is generally intransitive. For example, a pile of straw with one less handful of straw may be similar to the whole pile but a pile with two (or more) less handfuls may not be. So <math>x</math> can be necessarily <math>P</math> without <math>x</math> being necessarily necessarily <math>P</math>. On the other hand, Saul Kripke has an account of ''de re'' modality which is based on (metaphysical) identity across worlds and is therefore transitive.\n\nAnother interpretation of the 'accessibility relation' with a physical meaning was given in Gerla 1987 where the claim “is possible <small><math>P</math></small> in the world <small><math>w''</math></small> is interpreted as \"it is possible to transform <small><math>w</math></small> into a world in which <small><math>P</math></small> is true\". So, the properties of the modal operators depend on the algebraic properties of the set of admissible transformations.\n\nThere are other applications of the 'accessibility relation' in philosophy. In epistemology, one can, instead of talking about nomological accessibility, talk about epistemic accessibility. A world <math>w'</math> is epistemically accessible from <math>w</math> for an individual <math>I</math> in <math>w</math> if and only if <math>I</math> does not know something which would rule out the hypothesis that <math>w'=w</math>. We can ask whether the relation is transitive. If <math>I</math> knows nothing that rules out the possibility that <math>w'=w</math> and knows nothing that rules the possibility that <math>w''=w'</math>, it does not follow that <math>I</math> knows nothing which rules out the hypothesis that <math>w''=w</math>. To return to our earlier example, one may not be able to distinguish a pile of sand from the same pile with one less handful and one may not be able to distinguish the pile with one less handful from the same pile with two less handfuls of sand, but one may still be able to distinguish the original pile from the pile with two less handfuls of sand.\n\nYet another example of the use of the 'accessibility relation' is in [[deontic logic]]. If we think of obligatoriness as truth in all morally perfect worlds, and permissibility as truth in some morally perfect world, then we will have to restrict out universe to include only morally perfect worlds. But, in that case, we will have left out the actual world. A better alternative would be to include all the metaphysically possible worlds but restrict the 'accessibility relation' to morally perfect worlds. Transitivity and the euclidean property will hold, but reflexivity and symmetry will not.\n\n==Computer science applications==\n\nIn modeling a computation, a 'possible world' can be a possible computer state.  Given the current computer state, you might define the accessible possible worlds to be all future possible computer states, or to be all possible immediate \"next\" computer states (assuming a discrete computer).  Either choice defines a particular 'accessibility relation' giving rise to a particular modal logic suited specifically for theorems about the computation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Modal logic]]\n* [[Possible worlds]]\n* [[Propositional attitude]]\n* [[Modal depth]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Gerla, G.; ''Transformational semantics for first order logic'', [http://www.vub.ac.be/CLWF/L&A/ Logique et Analyse], No. 117–118, pp.&nbsp;69–79, 1987.<!-- Gerda's own home page cites this as \"Logique et Analysis\", but the journal's name is \"Logique et Analyse\" -->\n* Fitelson, Brandon; ''Notes on \"Accessibility\" and Modality'', 2003.\n* Brown, Curtis; ''Propositional Modal Logic: A Few First Steps'', 2002.\n* Kripke, Saul; ''Naming and Necessity'', Oxford, 1980.\n* Lewis, David K.; ''[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0022-362X(19680307)65:5%3C113:CTAQML%3E2.0.CO;2-G&cookieSet=1 Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic]'' <sup>(subscription required)</sup>, The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. LXV, No. 5 (1968-03-07), pp.&nbsp;113–126, 1968\n* [http://www.cc.utah.edu/~nahaj/logic/structures/systems/index.html List of Logic Systems] List of most of the more popular modal logics.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Accessibility Relation}}\n[[Category:Modal logic]]\n[[Category:Binary relations]]"

It is controversial whether [[second-order logic]] with standard semantics is really \"logic\" at all. Quine famously claimed that it was really 'set theory in logic's clothing.' In his books setting out formal systems related to PM and capable of modelling significant portions of Mathematics, namely - and in order of publication - 'A System of Logistic', 'Mathematical Logic' and 'Set Theory and its Logic', Quine's ultimate view as to the proper cleavage between logical and extralogical systems appears to be that once axioms that allow incompleteness phenomena to arise are added to a system, the system is no longer purely logical.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[ Begriffsschrift]]''\n*[[Gottlob Frege]]\n*[[Transitive closure]]\n<!-- - The ancestral of a relation is not to be confused with its [[Reflexive transitive closure]], although the notation ''R<sup>*</sup>'' is used for both. -->\n\n==References==\n*[[George Boolos]], 1998.

      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is '''antisymmetric''' if there is no pair of ''distinct'' elements of ''X'' each of which is related by ''R'' to the other. More formally, ''R'' is antisymmetric precisely if for all ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X''\n:if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') with ''a''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''b'', then ''R''(''b'', ''a'') must not hold,\nor, equivalently,\n:if ''R''(''a'', ''b'') and ''R''(''b'', ''a''), then ''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''b''.\n(The definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether ''R''(''a'', ''a'') actually holds or not for any ''a''.)\n\nThe [[divisibility]] relation on the [[natural number]]s is an important example of an antisymmetric relation. In this context, antisymmetry means that the only way each of two numbers can be divisible by the other is if the two are, in fact, the same number; equivalently, if ''n'' and ''m'' are distinct and ''n'' is a factor of ''m'', then ''m'' cannot be a factor of ''n''.  For example,  12 is divisible by 4, but 4 is not divisible by 12.\n\nThe usual [[order relation]] ≤ on the [[real number]]s is antisymmetric: if for two real numbers ''x'' and ''y'' both [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''y'' and ''y''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x'' hold then ''x'' and ''y'' must be equal. Similarly,  the [[subset order]] ⊆ on the subsets of any given set is antisymmetric: given two sets ''A'' and ''B'', if every [[Element (mathematics)|element]] in ''A'' also is in ''B'' and every element in ''B'' is also in ''A'', then ''A'' and ''B'' must contain all the same elements and therefore be equal:\n:<math>A \\subseteq B \\land B \\subseteq A \\Rightarrow A = B</math>\n\n[[partial order|Partial]] and [[total order]]s are antisymmetric by definition. A relation can be both [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and antisymmetric (e.g., [[equality (mathematics)|the equality relation]]), and there are relations which are neither symmetric nor antisymmetric (e.g., the \"preys on\" relation on biological [[species]]).\n\nAntisymmetry is different from [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]], which requires both antisymmetry and [[reflexive relation|irreflexivity]].

Every better-quasi-ordering is a [[well-quasi-ordering]].\n\n== Motivation ==\n\nThough ''well-quasi-ordering'' is an appealing notion, many important infinitary operations do not preserve well-quasi-orderedness. \nAn example due to [[Richard Rado]] illustrates this.<ref name=\"Rado54\"/> \nIn a 1965 paper [[Crispin Nash-Williams]] formulated the stronger notion of ''better-quasi-ordering'' in order to prove that the class of [[Tree (set theory)|tree]]s of height [[Ordinal number#Ordinals extend the natural numbers|ω]] is well-quasi-ordered under the ''[[topological minor]]'' relation.<ref name=\"Nash-Williams65\"/> Since then, many [[quasi-ordering]]s have been proven to be well-quasi-orderings by proving them to be better-quasi-orderings. For instance, [[Richard Laver]] established [[Roland Fraïssé|Fraïssé's]] conjecture by proving that the class of scattered [[linear order]] types is better-quasi-ordered.<ref name=\"Laver71\"/> More recently, Carlos Martinez-Ranero has proven that, under the [[Proper Forcing Axiom]], the class of [[Aronszajn line]]s is better-quasi-ordered under the embeddability relation.<ref name=\"Martinez-Ranero2011\"/>\n\n== Definition ==\n\nIt is common in better-quasi-ordering theory to write <math> {_*}x </math> for the sequence <math>x</math> with the first term omitted. Write <math>[\\omega]^{<\\omega}</math> for the set of finite, strictly increasing [[sequence]]s with terms in <math>\\omega</math>, and define a relation <math>\\triangleleft</math> on <math>[\\omega]^{<\\omega}</math> as follows: <math>s\\triangleleft t</math> if there is <math>u \\in [\\omega]^{<\\omega}</math> such that <math>s</math> is a strict initial segment of <math>u</math> and <math>t={}_*u</math>.

The first composition results in a homogeneous relation on ''A'' and the second is on ''B''. Since the images of these hom functors are in '''Rel''' itself, in this case hom is an [[internal hom functor]]. With its internal hom functor, '''Rel''' is a [[closed category]], and furthermore a [[dagger compact category]].\n\nThe category '''Rel''' can be obtained from the category '''Set''' as the [[Kleisli category]] for the [[monad (category theory)|monad]] whose functor corresponds to [[power set]], interpreted as a covariant functor.\n\nPerhaps a bit surprising at first sight is the fact that [[Product (category theory)|product]] in '''Rel''' is given by the [[disjoint union]]<ref name=MB&CW/>{{rp|181}} (rather than the [[cartesian product]] as it is in '''Set'''), and so is the [[coproduct]].\n\n'''Rel''' is [[Closed monoidal category|monoidal closed]], with both the monoidal product ''A'' ⊗ ''B'' and the [[internal hom]] ''A'' ⇒ ''B'' given by [[cartesian product]] of sets.\n\nThe category '''Rel''' was the prototype for the algebraic structure called an [[allegory (category theory)|allegory]] by [[Peter J. Freyd]] and Andre Scedrov in 1990.<ref>[[Peter J.

For example, ''A'' is a set and ''R'' ⊂ ''A'' × ''A'' is a binary relation on ''A''.

      "text": "{{For|inverse relationships in statistics|negative relationship}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''converse relation''', or '''transpose''', of a [[binary relation]] is the relation that occurs when the order of the elements is switched in the relation. For example, the converse of the relation 'child&nbsp;of' is the relation 'parent&nbsp;of'. In formal terms, if {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are sets and {{math|''L'' ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y''}} is a relation from {{math|''X''}} to {{math|''Y''}}, then {{math|''L''<sup>{{font|T}}</sup>}} is the relation defined so that {{math|''y L''<sup>{{font|T}}</sup> ''x''}} if and only if {{math|''x L y''}}. In [[set-builder notation]], {{math|1=''L''<sup>{{font|T}}</sup> = {(''y, x'') ∈ ''Y'' × ''X'' {{!}} (''x, y'') ∈ ''L'' }}}.\n\nThe notation is analogous with that for an [[inverse function]]. Although many functions do not have an inverse, every relation does have a unique converse. The [[unary operation]] that maps a relation to the converse relation is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], so it induces the structure of a [[semigroup with involution]] on the binary relations on a set, or, more generally, induces a [[dagger category]] on the [[category of relations]] as [[#Properties|detailed below]]. As a [[unary operation]], taking the converse (sometimes called '''conversion''' or '''transposition''') commutes with the order-related operations of the calculus of relations, that is it commutes with union, intersection, and complement.\n\nThe converse relation is also called the or '''transpose relation'''&mdash; the latter in view of its similarity with the [[transpose]] of a matrix.<ref name=R&G>{{cite book|author1=Gunther Schmidt|author2=Thomas Ströhlein|title=Relations and Graphs: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Scientists|year=1993|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-77970-1|pages=9–10}}</ref> It has also been called the '''opposite''' or '''dual''' of the original relation<ref>{{cite book|author1=Celestina Cotti Ferrero|author2=Giovanni Ferrero|title=Nearrings: Some Developments Linked to Semigroups and Groups|year=2002|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|isbn=978-1-4613-0267-4|page=3}}</ref>, or the '''inverse''' of the original relation,<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel J.

The relation \"''A'' is a [[sibling]] of ''B''\" is its own converse, since it is a symmetric relation.\n\nIn set theory, one presumes a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] ''U'' of discourse, and a fundamental relation of [[set membership]] ''x'' ∈ ''A'' when ''A'' is a subset of ''U''. The [[power set]] of all subsets of ''U'' is the domain of the converse <math>{\\ni} = {\\in^\\mathsf{T}}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\nIn the [[monoid]] of binary [[endorelation]]s on a set (with the [[binary operation]] on relations being the [[composition of relations]]), the converse relation does not satisfy the definition of an inverse from group theory, i.e. if ''L'' is an arbitrary relation on ''X'', then <math>L \\circ L^\\mathsf{T}</math> does ''not'' equal the [[Identity function|identity relation]] on ''X'' in general. The converse relation does satisfy the (weaker) axioms of a [[semigroup with involution]]: <math>\\left(L^\\mathsf{T}\\right)^\\mathsf{T} = L</math> and <math>\\left(L \\circ R\\right)^\\mathsf{T} = R^\\mathsf{T} \\circ L^\\mathsf{T}</math>.<ref name=\"Lambek2001\"/>\n\nSince one may generally consider relations between different sets (which form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] rather than a monoid, namely the [[category of relations]] '''Rel'''), in this context the converse relation conforms to the axioms of a [[dagger category]] (aka category with involution).<ref name=\"Lambek2001\"/> A relation equal to its converse is a [[symmetric relation]]; in the language of dagger categories, it is [[self-adjoint]].\n\nFurthermore, the semigroup of endorelations on a set is also a partially ordered structure (with inclusion of relations as sets), and actually an involutive [[quantale]].

Some authors also use the term cover to denote any such pair <math>(x,y)</math> in the covering relation.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* In a finite [[linearly ordered]] set {1, 2, ..., ''n''}, ''i'' + 1 covers ''i'' for all ''i'' between 1 and ''n'' − 1 (and there are no other covering relations).\n* In the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] of the [[power set]] of a set ''S'', a subset ''B'' of ''S'' covers a subset ''A'' of ''S'' if and only if ''B'' is obtained from ''A'' by adding one element not in ''A''.\n* In [[Young's lattice]], formed by the [[partition (number theory)|partitions]] of all nonnegative integers, a partition ''λ'' covers a partition ''μ'' if and only if the [[Young diagram]] of ''λ'' is obtained from the Young diagram of ''μ'' by adding an extra cell.\n* The Hasse diagram depicting the covering relation of a [[Tamari lattice]] is the [[n-skeleton|skeleton]] of an [[associahedron]].\n* The covering relation of any finite [[distributive lattice]] forms a [[median graph]].\n* On the [[real number]]s with the usual total order ≤, the cover set is empty: no number covers another.\n\n== Properties ==\n* If a partially ordered set is finite, its covering relation is the [[transitive reduction]] of the partial order relation.  Such partially ordered sets are therefore completely described by their Hasse diagrams.  On the other hand, in a [[dense order]], such as the [[rational number]]s with the standard order, no element covers another.\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last = Knuth | first = Donald E. | author-link = Donald Knuth | year = 2006 | title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 4, Fascicle 4 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-321-33570-8}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Stanley | first = Richard P. | author-link = Richard P.

That is, all totally ordered sets are directed sets (contrast [[partially ordered sets|''partially'' ordered sets]], which need not be directed). Join [[semilattice]]s (which are partially ordered sets) are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s are directed sets both upward and downward.\n\nIn [[topology]], directed sets are used to define [[net (topology)|nets]], which generalize [[sequence]]s and unite the various notions of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] used in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Directed sets also give rise to [[direct limit]]s in [[abstract algebra]] and (more generally) [[category theory]].\n\n== Equivalent definition ==\nIn addition to the definition above, there is an equivalent definition. A '''directed set''' is a set ''A'' with a [[preorder]] such that every finite subset of ''A'' has an upper bound. In this definition, the existence of an upper bound of the [[empty set|empty subset]] implies that ''A'' is nonempty.\n\n== Examples ==\nExamples of directed sets include:\n* The set of [[natural number]]s '''N''' with the ordinary order ≤ is a directed set (and so is every [[total order|totally ordered set]]).\n* Let '''D<sub>1</sub>''' and '''D<sub>2</sub>''' be directed sets. Then the Cartesian product set '''D<sub>1</sub> <math>\\times</math> D<sub>2</sub>''' can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>) ≤ (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) if and only if ''n''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ''m''<sub>2</sub>. In analogy to the [[product order]] this is the product direction on the Cartesian product.\n* It follows from previous example that the set '''N''' <math>\\times</math> '''N''' of pairs of natural numbers can be made into a directed set by defining (''n''<sub>0</sub>, ''n''<sub>1</sub>) ≤ (''m''<sub>0</sub>, ''m''<sub>1</sub>) if and only if ''n''<sub>0</sub> ≤ ''m''<sub>0</sub> and ''n''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''m''<sub>1</sub>.\n* If ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a [[real number]], we can turn the set '''R''' − {''x''<sub>0</sub>} into a directed set by writing ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if <br>|''a'' − ''x''<sub>0</sub>| ≥ |''b'' − ''x''<sub>0</sub>|. We then say that the reals have been ''directed towards x<sub>0</sub>''. This is an example of a directed set that is not [[partial order|ordered]] (neither totally nor partially).\n* A (trivial) example of a partially ordered set that is '''''not''''' directed is the set {''a'', ''b''}, in which the only order relations are ''a'' ≤ ''a'' and ''b'' ≤ ''b''. A less trivial example is like the previous example of the \"reals directed towards x<sub>0</sub>\" but in which the ordering rule only applies to pairs of elements on the same side of x<sub>0</sub>.\n* If ''T'' is a [[topological space]] and ''x''<sub>0</sub> is a point in ''T'', we turn the set of all [[topological neighbourhood|neighbourhoods]] of ''x''<sub>0</sub> into a directed set by writing ''U'' ≤ ''V'' if and only if ''U'' contains ''V''.\n** For every ''U'': ''U'' ≤ ''U''; since ''U'' contains itself.\n** For every ''U'', ''V,'' and ''W'': if ''U'' ≤ ''V'' and ''V'' ≤ ''W'', then we have ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''V'' and ''V'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''W'', which implies ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''W''. Thus ''U ≤ W.''\n** For every ''U'' and ''V'': since ''x<sub>0</sub>'' <math>\\in</math> ''U'' <math>\\cap</math> ''V'', and since both ''U'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''U <math>\\cap</math> V'' and ''V'' <math>\\supseteq</math> ''U <math>\\cap</math> V'', we have ''U ≤ U <math>\\cap</math> V'' and V ''≤ U <math>\\cap</math> V.''\n* In a [[poset]] ''P'', every [[Upper_set#Upper_closure_and_lower_closure|lower closure]] of an element, i.e. every subset of the form {''a'' | ''a'' in ''P'', ''a'' ≤ ''x''} where ''x'' is a fixed element from ''P'', is directed.\n\n== Contrast with semilattices ==\n[[File:Directed_set,_but_no_join_semi-lattice.png|thumb|x100px|Witness]]\n\nDirected sets are a more general concept than (join) semilattices: every [[semilattice|join semilattice]] is a directed set, as the join or least upper bound of two elements is the desired ''c''.  The converse does not hold however, witness the directed set {1000,0001,1101,1011,1111} [[coordinatewise order|ordered bitwise]] (e.g. 1000 ≤ 1011 holds, but 0001 ≤ 1000 does not, since in the last bit 1 > 0), where {1000,0001} has three upper bounds but no ''least'' upper bound, cf. picture. (Also note that without 1111, the set is not directed.)\n\n== Directed subsets ==\nThe order relation in a directed set is not required to be [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and therefore directed sets are not always [[partial order]]s. However, the term ''directed set'' is also used frequently in the context of posets. In this setting, a subset ''A'' of a partially ordered set (''P'',≤) is called a '''directed subset''' if it is a directed set according to the same partial order: in other words, it is not the [[empty set]], and every pair of elements has an upper bound. Here the order relation on the elements of ''A'' is inherited from ''P''; for this reason, reflexivity and transitivity need not be required explicitly.\n\nA directed subset of a poset is not required to be [[lower set|downward closed]]; a subset of a poset is directed if and only if its downward closure is an [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]]. While the definition of a directed set is for an \"upward-directed\" set (every pair of elements has an upper bound), it is also possible to define a downward-directed set in which every pair of elements has a common lower bound. A subset of a poset is downward-directed if and only if its upper closure is a [[filter (mathematics)|filter]].\n\nDirected subsets are used in [[domain theory]], which studies [[directed complete partial order]]s.<ref>Gierz, p. 2.</ref> These are posets in which every upward-directed set is required to have a [[least upper bound]]. In this context, directed subsets again provide a generalization of convergent sequences.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Filtered category]]\n* [[Centered set]]\n* [[Linked set]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* J.

They were originally included among the [[Peano axioms]] for natural numbers. Although the symmetric and transitive properties are often seen as fundamental, they can be deduced from substitution and reflexive properties.\n\n== Equality as predicate ==\nWhen ''A'' and ''B'' are not fully specified or depend on some [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]], equality is a [[proposition (mathematics)|proposition]], which may be true for some values and false for some other values. Equality is a [[binary relation]] or, in other words, a two-argument [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]], which may produce a [[truth value]] (''false'' or ''true'') from its arguments. In [[computer programming]], its computation from two expressions is known as [[relational operator|comparison]].\n\n== Identities==\n{{main|Identity (mathematics)}}\nWhen ''A'' and ''B'' may be viewed as [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of some variables, then ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''B'' means that ''A'' and ''B'' define the same function. Such an equality of functions is sometimes called an [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]. An example is (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Sometimes, but not always, an identity is written with a triple bar: (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;≡&nbsp;''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n==Equations==\nAn [[equation]] is a problem of finding values of some variables, called ''unknowns'', for which the specified equality is true. ''Equation'' may also refer to an equality relation that is satisfied only for the values of the variables that one is interested in. For example, ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 is the ''equation'' of the [[unit circle]].\n\nThere is no standard notation that distinguishes an equation from an identity or other use of the equality relation: a reader has to guess an appropriate interpretation from the semantics of expressions and the context. An identity is ''asserted'' to be true for all values of variables in a given domain. An \"equation\" may sometimes mean an identity, but more often it ''specifies'' a subset of the variable space to be the subset where the equation is true.\n\n==Congruences==\n{{Main|Congruence relation|Congruence (geometry)}}\n\nIn some cases, one may consider as '''equal''' two mathematical objects that are only equivalent for the properties that are considered. Particularly in the case of [[geometry]], this is where two [[geometric shape]]s are said to be equal when one may be moved to coincide with the other. The word '''congruence''' is also used for this kind of equality.\n\n== Approximate equality ==\nThere are some [[mathematical logic|logic systems]] that do not have any notion of equality. This reflects the [[undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the equality of two [[real number]]s defined by formulas involving the [[integer]]s, the basic [[arithmetic operation]]s, the [[logarithm]] and the [[exponential function]]. In other words, there cannot exist any [[algorithm]] for deciding such an equality.\n\nThe [[binary relation]] \"[[approximation|is approximately equal]]\" between [[real number]]s or other things, even if more precisely defined, is not transitive (it may seem so at first sight, but many small [[Difference (mathematics)|differences]] can add up to something big). However, equality [[almost everywhere]] ''is'' transitive.\n\n== Relation with equivalence and isomorphism ==\n{{Main|Equivalence relation|Isomorphism}}\n\nViewed as a relation, equality is the archetype of the more general concept of an [[equivalence relation]] on a set: those binary relations that are [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]]. The identity relation is an equivalence relation. Conversely, let ''R'' be an equivalence relation, and let us denote by ''x<sup>R</sup>'' the equivalence class of ''x'', consisting of all elements ''z'' such that ''x R z''. Then the relation ''x R y'' is equivalent with the equality ''x<sup>R</sup>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y<sup>R</sup>''. It follows that equality is the finest equivalence relation on any set ''S'' in the sense that it is the relation that has the smallest equivalence classes (every class is reduced to a single element).\n\nIn some contexts, equality is sharply distinguished from ''[[equivalence relation|equivalence]]'' or ''[[isomorphism]].''<ref>{{Harv|Mazur|2007}}</ref> For example, one may distinguish ''[[fraction (mathematics)|fractions]]'' from ''[[rational number]]s,'' the latter being equivalence classes of fractions: the fractions <math>1/2</math> and <math>2/4</math> are distinct as fractions (as different strings of symbols) but they \"represent\" the same rational number (the same point on a number line). This distinction gives rise to the notion of a [[quotient set]].\n\nSimilarly, the sets\n:<math>\\{\\text{A}, \\text{B}, \\text{C}\\} </math> and <math>\\{ 1, 2, 3 \\} </math>\n\nare not equal sets — the first consists of letters, while the second consists of numbers — but they are both sets of three elements and thus isomorphic, meaning that there is a [[bijection]] between them. For example\n:<math>\\text{A} \\mapsto 1, \\text{B} \\mapsto 2, \\text{C} \\mapsto 3.</math>\n\nHowever, there are other choices of isomorphism, such as\n:<math>\\text{A} \\mapsto 3, \\text{B} \\mapsto 2, \\text{C} \\mapsto 1,</math>\n\nand these sets cannot be identified without making such a choice — any statement that identifies them \"depends on choice of identification\". This distinction, [[Isomorphism#Relation with equality|between equality and isomorphism]], is of fundamental importance in [[category theory]] and is one motivation for the development of category theory.\n\n== Logical definitions ==\n{{See also|First-order logic#Equality and its axioms}}\n\n[[Leibniz]] characterized the notion of equality as follows:\n: [[Given any]] ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' = ''y'' [[material equivalence|if and only if]], given any [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] ''P'', ''P''(''x'') [[if and only if]] ''P''(''y'').\n\nIn this law, \"''P''(''x'') if and only if ''P''(''y'')\" can be weakened to \"''P''(''x'') if ''P''(''y'')\"; the modified law is equivalent to the original, since a statement that applies to \"any ''x'' and ''y''\" applies just as well to \"any ''y'' and ''x''\".\n\nInstead of considering Leibniz's law as a true statement that can be proven from the usual laws of logic (including axioms about equality such as symmetry, reflexivity and substitution), it can also be taken as the ''definition'' of equality. The property of being an equivalence relation, as well as the properties given below, can then be proved: they become [[theorem]]s.\n\n== Equality in set theory ==\n{{Main|Axiom of extensionality}}\n\nEquality of sets is axiomatized in set theory in two different ways, depending on whether the axioms are based on a first-order language with or without equality.\n\n=== Set equality based on first-order logic with equality ===\nIn first-order logic with equality, the axiom of extensionality states that two sets which ''contain'' the same elements are the same set.<ref>{{harvnb|Kleene|2002|page=189}}. {{harvnb|Lévy|2002|page=13}}. {{harvnb|Shoenfield|2001|page=239}}.</ref>\n\n* Logic axiom: ''x'' = ''y'' ⇒ ∀''z'', (''z'' ∈ ''x'' ⇔ ''z'' ∈ ''y'')\n* Logic axiom: ''x'' = ''y'' ⇒ ∀''z'', (''x'' ∈ ''z'' ⇔ ''y'' ∈ ''z'')\n* Set theory axiom: (∀''z'', (''z'' ∈ ''x'' ⇔ ''z'' ∈ ''y'')) ⇒ ''x'' = ''y''\n\nIncorporating half of the work into the first-order logic may be regarded as a mere matter of convenience, as noted by Lévy.\n: \"The reason why we take up first-order predicate calculus ''with equality'' is a matter of convenience; by this we save the labor of defining equality and proving all its properties; this burden is now assumed by the logic.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lévy|2002|page=4}}.</ref>\n\n=== Set equality based on first-order logic without equality ===\nIn first-order logic without equality, two sets are ''defined'' to be equal if they contain the same elements.

      "text": "In [[Euclidean geometry]], '''equipollence''' is a [[binary relation]] between [[line segment#Directed line segment|directed line segment]]s. A line segment ''AB'' from point ''A'' to point ''B'' has the opposite direction to line segment ''BA''. Two directed line segments are '''equipollent''' when they have the same length and direction.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of equipollent line segments was advanced by [[Giusto Bellavitis]] in 1835. Subsequently the term '''vector''' was adopted for a class of equipollent line segments. Bellavitis's use of the idea of a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] to compare different but similar objects has become a common mathematical technique, particularly in the use of [[equivalence relation]]s. Bellavitis used a special notation for the equipollence of segments ''AB'' and ''CD'': \n:<math>AB  \\bumpeq CD .</math>\n\nThe following passages, translated by Michael J. Crowe, show the anticipation that Bellavitis had of [[Euclidean vector|vector]] concepts:\n:Equipollences continue to hold when one substitutes for the lines in them, other lines which are respectively equipollent to them, however they may be situated in space. From this it can be understood how any number and any kind of lines may be ''summed'', and that in whatever order these lines are taken, the same equipollent-sum will be obtained...\n\n:In equipollences, just as in equations, a line may be transferred from one side to the other, provided that the sign is changed...\nThus oppositely directed segments are negatives of each other: <math>AB + BA \\bumpeq 0 .</math>\n\n:The equipollence <math>AB \\bumpeq n.CD ,</math> where ''n'' stands for a positive number, indicates that ''AB'' is both parallel to and has the same direction as ''CD'', and that their lengths have the relation expressed by ''AB'' = ''n.CD''.<ref>Michael J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]], \"Giusto Bellavitis and His Calculus of Equipollences\", pp 52–4, [[University of Notre Dame Press]]</ref>\n\nThe segment from ''A'' to ''B'' is a ''bound vector'', while the class of segments equipollent to it is a [[free vector]], in the parlance of [[Euclidean vector]]s.\n\n==Extension==\nGeometric equipollence is also used on the sphere:\n:To appreciate [[W. R. Hamilton|Hamilton's]] method, let us first recall the much simpler case of the Abelian group of translations in Euclidean three-dimensional space. Each translation is representable as a vector in space, only the direction and magnitude being significant, and the location irrelevant. The composition of two translations is given by the head-to-tail parallelogram rule of vector addition; and taking the inverse amounts to reversing direction. In Hamilton's theory of turns, we have a generalization of such a picture from the Abelian translation group to the non-Abelian [[SU(2)]]. Instead of vectors in space, we deal with directed great circle arcs, of length < &pi; on a unit sphere S<sup>2</sup> in a Euclidean three-dimensional space. Two such arcs are deemed equivalent if by sliding one along its great circle it can be made to coincide with the other.<ref>[[N.

The [[calculus of relations]] includes the [[algebra of sets]], extended by [[composition of relations]] and the use of [[converse relation]]s. The inclusion ''R'' ⊆ ''S'', meaning that ''aRb'' implies ''aSb'', sets the scene in a [[lattice (order theory)|lattice]] of relations. But since <math>P \\subseteq Q \\equiv (P \\cap \\bar{Q} = \\varnothing ) \\equiv (P \\cap Q = P),</math> the inclusion symbol is superfluous. Nevertheless, composition of relations and manipulation of the operators according to [[composition of relations#Schröder rules|Schröder rules]], provides a calculus to work in the [[power set]] of ''A'' × ''B''.\n\nIn contrast to homogeneous relations, the [[composition of relations]] operation is only a [[partial function]]. The necessity of matching range to domain of composed relations has led to the suggestion that the study of heterogeneous relations is a chapter of [[category theory]] as in the [[category of sets]], except that the [[morphism]]s of this category are relations. The ''objects'' of the category [[Category of relations|Rel]] are sets, and the relation-morphisms compose as required in a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:LocationOceans_transparent.png|thumb|250px|right|Oceans and continents]]\n{|  class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|+Ocean borders continent\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | NA\n! scope=\"col\"      | SA\n! scope=\"col\"            | AF\n! scope=\"col\"                 | EU\n! scope=\"col\"                       | AS\n! scope=\"col\"                             | OC\n! scope=\"col\"                                  | AA\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Indian||0||0||1||0||1||1||1\n|-  \n! scope=\"row\" | Arctic||1||0||0||1||1||0||0 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Atlantic||1||1||1||1||0||0||1\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Pacific||1||1||0||0||1||1||1\n|}\n\n1) Let ''A'' = {Indian, Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific}, the [[ocean]]s of the globe, and ''B'' = { NA, SA, AF, EU, AS, OC, AA }, the [[continent]]s. Let ''aRb'' represent that ocean ''a'' borders continent ''b''. Then the [[logical matrix]] for this relation is:\n:<math>R = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} .</math>\nThe connectivity of the planet Earth can be viewed through ''R R''<sup>T</sup> and ''R''<sup>T</sup> ''R'', the former being a 4 × 4 relation on ''A'', which is the universal relation (''A'' × ''A'' or a logical matrix of all ones). This universal relation reflects the fact that every ocean is separated from the others by at most one continent. On the other hand, ''R''<sup>T</sup> ''R'' is a relation on ''B'' × ''B'' which ''fails'' to be universal because at least two oceans must be traversed to voyage from [[Europe]] to [[Oceania]].\n\n2) Visualization of relations leans on [[graph theory]]: For relations on a set (homogeneous relations), a [[directed graph]] illustrates a relation and a [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] a symmetric relation. For heterogeneous relations a [[hypergraph]] has edges possibly with more than two nodes, and can be illustrated by a [[bipartite graph]]. \n\nJust as the [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] is integral to relations on a set, so [[biclique]]s are used to describe heterogeneous relations; indeed, they are the \"concepts\" that generate a lattice associated with a relation.\n[[File:Add_velocity_ark_POV.svg|right|thumb|200px|The various ''t'' axes represent time for observers in motion, the corresponding ''x'' axes are their lines of simultaneity]]\n3) [[Hyperbolic orthogonality]]: Time and space are different categories, and temporal properties are separate from spatial properties. The idea of ''simultaneous events'' is simple in [[absolute time and space]] since each time ''t'' determines a simultaneous [[hyperplane]] in that cosmology. [[Herman Minkowski]] changed that when he articulated the notion of ''relative simultaneity'', which exists when spatial events are \"normal\" to a time characterized by a velocity. He used an indefinite inner product, and specified that a time vector is normal to a space vector when that product is zero. The indefinite inner product in a [[composition algebra]] is given by\n:<math><x, z> \\ =\\ x \\bar{z} + \\bar{x}z </math> &nbsp;where the overbar denotes conjugation.\nAs a relation between some temporal events and some spatial events, [[hyperbolic orthogonality]] (as found in [[split-complex number]]s) is a heterogeneous relation.<ref>{{wikibooks-inline|Calculus/Hyperbolic angle#Split-complex theory|Relative simultaneity}}</ref>\n\n4) A [[geometric configuration]] can be considered a relation between its points and its lines. The relation is expressed as [[incidence relation|incidence]]. Finite and infinite projective and affine planes are included. [[Jakob Steiner]] pioneered the cataloguing of configurations with the [[Steiner system]]s S(''t,k,n'') which have an n-element set ''S'' and a set of k-element subsets called '''blocks''', such that a subset with ''t'' elements lies in just one block. These [[incidence structure]]s have been generalized with [[block design]]s. The [[incidence matrix]] used in these geometrical contexts corresponds to the logical matrix used generally with binary relations.\n:An incidence structure is a triple '''D''' = (''V'', '''B''', ''I'') where ''V'' and '''B''' are any two disjoint sets and ''I'' is a binary relation between ''V'' and '''B''', i.e. ''I'' ⊆ ''V'' × '''B'''. The elements of ''V'' will be called ''points'', those of '''B''' blocks and those of ''I flags''.<ref> {{cite book|first1=Thomas|last1=Beth|first2=Dieter|last2=Jungnickel|authorlink2=Dieter Jungnickel|first3=Hanfried|last3=Lenz|authorlink3=Hanfried Lenz|title=Design Theory|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=15|year=1986}}. 2nd ed.

(2) ''C'' is maximal, not contained in any other outer product. Thus ''C'' is described as a non-enlargeable rectangle.\n\nFor a given relation ''R'': ''X'' → ''Y'', the set of concepts, enlarged by their joins and meets, forms an \"induced lattice of concepts\", with inclusion <math>\\sqsubseteq</math> forming a [[preorder]].\n\nThe [[MacNeille completion theorem]] (1937) (that any partial order may be embedded in a [[complete lattice]]) is cited in a 2013 survey article \"Decomposition of relations on concept lattices\".<ref>[[R.

With heterogeneous relations the idea is to partition objects by distinguishing attributes. One way this can be done is with an intervening set ''Z'' = {''x, y, z'', ...} of [[indicator (research)|indicator]]s. The partitioning relation ''R'' = ''F G''<sup>T</sup> is a [[composition of relations]] using ''univalent'' relations ''F'' ⊆ ''A'' × ''Z'' and ''G'' ⊆ ''B'' × ''Z''. \n\nThe [[logical matrix]] of such a relation ''R'' can be re-arranged as a [[block matrix]] with blocks of ones along the diagonal.\nIn terms of the calculus of relations, in 1950 [[Jacques Riguet]] showed that such relations satisfy the inclusion\n:<math>R \\ R^T \\ R \\ \\subseteq \\ R .</math><ref>[[Jacques Riguet]] (1950) \"Quelques proprietes des relations difonctionelles\", ''Comptes Rendus'' 230: 1999–2000</ref>\n\nHe named these relations '''difunctional''' since the composition ''F G''<sup>T</sup> involves univalent relations, commonly called ''functions''.\n\nUsing the notation {''y'': ''xRy''} = ''xR'', a difunctional relation can also be characterized as a relation ''R'' such that wherever ''x''<sub>1</sub>''R'' and ''x''<sub>2</sub>''R'' have a non-empty intersection, then these two sets coincide; formally ''x''<sub>1</sub>''R'' ∩ ''x''<sub>2</sub>''R'' ≠ ∅ implies ''x''<sub>1</sub>''R'' = ''x''<sub>2</sub>''R''.<ref name=\"BrinkKahl1997\">{{cite book|author1=Chris Brink|author2=Wolfram Kahl|author3=Gunther Schmidt|title=Relational Methods in Computer Science|year=1997|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-211-82971-4|page=200}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997 researchers found \"utility of binary decomposition based on difunctional dependencies in [[database]] management.\"<ref>Ali Jaoua, Nadin Belkhiter, Habib Ounalli, and Theodore Moukam (1997) \"Databases\", pages 197–210 in ''Relational Methods in Computer Science'', edited by Chris Brink, Wolfram Kahl, and [[Gunther Schmidt]], [[Springer Science & Business Media]] {{isbn|978-3-211-82971-4}}</ref> Furthermore, bifunctional relations are fundamental in the study of [[bisimulation]]s.<ref>{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-44124-4_7\n| chapter = Coalgebraic Simulations and Congruences| title = Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science| volume = 8446| pages = 118| series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]]| year = 2014| last1 = Gumm | first1 = H.

(3) ∀ ''y'' in ''Y'', ''y g Z'' and ''x g Y'' implies ''x g Z''. The [[set membership]] relation, &epsilon; = \"is an element of\", satisfies these properties so &epsilon; is a contact relation.

Some authors call a relation  ''intransitive'' if it is not transitive, i.e. (if the relation in question is named <math>R</math>)\n\n:<math>\\lnot\\left(\\forall a, b, c: a R b \\land b R c \\Rightarrow a R c\\right).</math>\n\nThis statement is equivalent to\n\n: <math>\\exists a,b,c : a R b \\land b R c \\land \\lnot(a R c)</math>\n\nFor instance, in the [[food chain]], wolves feed on deer, and deer feed on grass, but wolves do not feed on grass.<ref>Wolves ''do'' in fact eat grass – see {{cite book|title=Wild Health: Lessons in Natural Wellness from the Animal Kingdom|first1=Cindy|last1=Engel|year=2003|edition=paperback|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=0-618-34068-8|page=141}}.</ref> Thus, the ''feed on'' relation among life forms is intransitive, in this sense.\n\nAnother example that does not involve preference loops arises in [[freemasonry]]: in some instances lodge A recognizes lodge B, and lodge B recognizes lodge C, but lodge A does not recognize lodge C. Thus the recognition relation among Masonic lodges is intransitive.\n\n==Antitransitivity==\n\nOften the term '''intransitive''' is used to refer to the [[mathematical jargon#stronger|stronger property]] of antitransitivity.\n\nWe just saw that the ''feed on'' relation is not transitive, but it still contains some transitivity: for instance: humans feed on rabbits, rabbits feed on carrots, and humans also feed on carrots.\n\nA relation is '''antitransitive''' if this never occurs at all, i.e.,\n\n:<math>\\forall a, b, c: a R b \\land b R c \\Rightarrow \\lnot (a R c)</math>\n\nMany authors use the term intransitivity to mean antitransitivity.<ref>[http://www.jgsee.kmutt.ac.th/exell/Logic/Logic42.htm#33 Guide to Logic, Relations II<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.virtual.cvut.cz/kifb/en/concepts/_intransitive_relation.html IntransitiveRelation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAn example of an antitransitive relation: the ''defeated'' relation in [[knockout tournament]]s.  If player A defeated player B and player B defeated player C, A can have never played C, and therefore, A has not defeated C.\n\nBy [[transposition (logic)|transposition]], each of the following formulas is equivalent to antitransitivity of ''R'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  &\\forall a, b, c: a R b \\land a R c \\Rightarrow \\lnot (b R c) \\\\[3pt]\n  &\\forall a, b, c: a R c \\land b R c \\Rightarrow \\lnot (a R b)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAn antitransitive relation is always irreflexive.\nAn irreflexive and [[left-unique relation|left-]] (or [[right-unique relation|right-]])unique relation is always anti-transitive.\n\n==Cycles==\n[[File:Three-part cycle diagram.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Three-part%20cycle%20diagram.png|alt=Cycle diagram|thumb|Sometimes, when people are asked their preferences through a series of binary questions, they will give logically impossible responses:  1 is better than 2, and 2 is better than 3, but 3 is better than 1.]]\nThe term ''intransitivity'' is often used when speaking of scenarios in which a relation describes the relative preferences between pairs of options, and weighing several options produces a \"loop\" of preference:\n\n*A is preferred to B\n*B is preferred to C\n*C is preferred to A\n\n[[Rock, paper, scissors]]; [[Nontransitive dice]]; Intransitive machines<ref>[https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03869 Poddiakov, A.

For if it is, each option in the loop is preferred to each option, including itself. This can be illustrated for this example of a loop among A, B, and C. Assume the relation is transitive. Then, since A is preferred to B and B is preferred to C, also A is preferred to C. But then, since C is preferred to A, also A is preferred to A.\n\nTherefore such a preference loop (or ''[[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]]'') is known as an '''intransitivity'''.\n\nNotice that a cycle is neither necessary nor sufficient for a binary relation to be not transitive.  For example, an [[equivalence relation]] possesses cycles but is transitive.  Now, consider the relation \"is an enemy of\" and suppose that the relation is symmetric and satisfies the condition that for any country, any enemy of an enemy of the country is not itself an enemy of the country.  This is an example of an antitransitive relation that does not have any cycles.  In particular, by virtue of being antitransitive the relation is not transitive.\n\nThe game of [[rock, paper, scissors]] is an example.  The relation over rock, paper, and scissors is \"defeats\", and the standard rules of the game are such that rock defeats scissors, scissors defeats paper, and paper defeats rock.  Furthermore, it is also true that scissors does not defeat rock, paper does not defeat scissors, and rock does not defeat paper.  Finally, it is also true that no option defeats itself. This information can be depicted in a table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\n! !! rock !! scissors !! paper\n|-\n! rock\n| 0 || 1 || 0\n|-\n! scissors\n| 0 || 0 || 1\n|-\n! paper\n| 1 || 0 || 0 \n|}\n\nThe first argument of the relation is a row and the second one is a column.  Ones indicate the relation holds, zero indicates that it does not hold.  Now, notice that the following statement is true for any pair of elements x and y drawn (with replacement) from the set {rock, scissors, paper}:  If x defeats y, and y defeats z, then x does not defeat z.  Hence the relation is antitransitive.\n\nThus, a cycle is neither necessary nor sufficient for a binary relation to be antitransitive.\n\n==Occurrences in preferences<!--This section is linked from [[Preference (economics)]]-->==\n\n* Intransitivity can occur under [[majority rule]], in probabilistic outcomes of [[game theory]], and in the [[Condorcet voting]] method in which ranking several candidates can produce a loop of preference when the weights are compared (see [[voting paradox]]). [[Intransitive dice]] demonstrate that probabilities are not necessarily transitive.\n* In [[psychology]], intransitivity often occurs in a person's [[Value system|system of values]] (or [[preference]]s, or [[Taste (sociology)|tastes]]), potentially leading to unresolvable conflicts.\n* Analogously, in [[economics]] intransitivity can occur in a consumer's [[Preference#Preference in economics|preferences]]. This may lead to consumer behaviour that does not conform to perfect [[Rationality#Rationality in the humanities and social sciences|economic rationality]]. In recent years, economists and philosophers have questioned whether violations of transitivity must necessarily lead to 'irrational behaviour' (see Anand (1993)).\n\n==Likelihood==\n\nIt has been suggested that [[Condorcet method|Condorcet voting]] tends to eliminate \"intransitive loops\" when large numbers of voters participate because the overall assessment criteria for voters balances out.  For instance, voters may prefer candidates on several different units of measure such as by order of social consciousness or by order of most fiscally conservative.\n\nIn such cases intransitivity reduces to a broader equation of numbers of people and the weights of their units of measure in assessing candidates.  \n\nSuch as:\n\n*30% favor 60/40 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism\n*50% favor 50/50 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism\n*20% favor a 40/60 weighting between social consciousness and fiscal conservatism\n\nWhile each voter may not assess the units of measure identically, the trend then becomes a single [[probability vector|vector]] on which the [[consensus]] agrees is a preferred balance of candidate criteria.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Anand|first1=P|year=1993|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}.\n[[Category:Binary relations]]\n* [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225909889_How_vicious_are_cycles_of_intransitive_choice Bar-Hillel, M., & Margalit, A.

A poset consists of a set together with a [[binary relation]] indicating that, for certain pairs of elements in the set, one of the elements precedes the other in the ordering. The word \"partial\" in the names \"partial order\" or \"partially ordered set\" is used as an indication that not every pair of elements needs to be comparable. That is, there may be pairs of elements for which neither element precedes the other in the poset. Partial orders thus generalize [[total order]]s, in which every pair is comparable.  \n\nTo be a partial order, a binary relation must be [[Reflexive relation|reflexive]] (each element is comparable to itself), [[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] (no two different elements precede each other), and [[Transitive relation|transitive]] (the start of a chain of precedence relations must precede the end of the chain).\n\nOne familiar example of a partially ordered set is a collection of people ordered by [[genealogy|genealogical]] descendancy. Some pairs of people bear the descendant-ancestor relationship, but other pairs of people are incomparable, with neither being a descendant of the other. \n\nA poset can be visualized through its [[Hasse diagram]], which depicts the ordering relation.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Merrifield |first1=Richard E. |last2=Simmons |first2=Howard E. |authorlink2=Howard Ensign Simmons, Jr. |title=Topological Methods in Chemistry |year=1989 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=New York |isbn=0-471-83817-9 |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0471838179.html |accessdate=27 July 2012 |pages=28 |quote=A partially ordered set is conveniently represented by a ''Hasse diagram''...}}</ref>\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\n{{stack|{{Binary relations}}}}\n\nA (non-strict) '''partial order'''<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Partially Ordered Sets|title=Mathematical Tools for Data Mining: Set Theory, Partial Orders, Combinatorics|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9781848002012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6i-F3ZNcub4C&pg=PA127|author1=Simovici, Dan A.  |author2=Djeraba, Chabane |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref> is a [[binary relation]] ≤ over a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' satisfying particular axioms which are discussed below. When ''a'' ≤ ''b'', we say that ''a'' is '''related to''' ''b''. (This does not imply that ''b'' is also related to ''a'', because the relation need not be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]].)  \n\nThe axioms for a non-strict partial order state that the relation ≤ is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], and [[transitive relation|transitive]]. That is, for all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in ''P'', it must satisfy:\n\n# ''a'' ≤ ''a'' ([[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]: every element is related to itself).\n# if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'', then ''a'' = ''b'' ([[Antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]]: two distinct elements cannot be related in both directions).\n# if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''c'', then ''a'' ≤ ''c'' ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]: if a first element is related to a second element, and, in turn, that element is related to a third element, then the first element is related to the third element).\n\nIn other words, a partial order is an antisymmetric [[preorder]].\n\nA set with a partial order is called a '''partially ordered set''' (also called a '''poset'''). The term ''ordered set'' is sometimes also used, as long as it is clear from the context that no other kind of order is meant. In particular, [[Total order|totally ordered sets]] can also be referred to as \"ordered sets\", especially in areas where these structures are more common than posets.\n\nFor ''a, b'', elements of a partially ordered set ''P'', if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''b'' ≤ ''a'', then ''a'' and ''b'' are '''[[Comparability|comparable]]'''. Otherwise they are '''incomparable'''. In the figure on top-right, e.g. {x} and {x,y,z} are comparable, while {x} and {y} are not. A partial order under which every pair of elements is comparable is called a '''[[totally ordered set|total order]]''' or '''linear order'''; a totally ordered set is also called a '''chain''' (e.g., the natural numbers with their standard order). A subset of a poset in which no two distinct elements are comparable is called an '''[[antichain]]''' (e.g. the set of [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s {{x}, {y}, {z}} in the top-right figure). An element ''a'' is said to be '''[[Covering relation|covered]]''' by another element ''b'', written ''a''<:''b'', if ''a'' is strictly less than ''b'' and no third element ''c'' fits between them; formally: if both ''a''≤''b'' and ''a''≠''b'' are true, and ''a''≤''c''≤''b'' is false for each ''c'' with ''a''≠''c''≠''b''. A more concise definition will be given [[#Strict and non-strict partial orders|below]] using the strict order corresponding to \"≤\". For example, {x} is covered by {x,z} in the top-right figure, but not by {x,y,z}.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nStandard examples of posets arising in mathematics include:\n\n* The [[real number]]s ordered by the standard ''less-than-or-equal'' relation ≤ (a totally ordered set as well).\n* The set of [[subset]]s of a given set (its [[power set]]) ordered by [[subset|inclusion]] (see the figure on top-right). Similarly, the set of [[sequence]]s ordered by [[subsequence]], and the set of [[string (computer science)|string]]s ordered by [[substring]].\n* The set of [[natural number]]s equipped with the relation of [[divisor#Divisibility of numbers|divisibility]].\n* The vertex set of a [[directed acyclic graph]] ordered by [[reachability]].\n* The set of [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] of a [[vector space]] ordered by inclusion.\n* For a partially ordered set ''P'', the [[sequence space]] containing all [[sequence]]s of elements from ''P'', where sequence ''a'' precedes sequence ''b'' if every item in ''a'' precedes the corresponding item in ''b''.

In this reduced poset, the top row of elements are all ''maximal'' elements, and the bottom row are all ''minimal'' elements, but there is no ''greatest'' and no ''least'' element. The set {x, y} is an ''upper bound'' for the collection of elements {{x}, {y}}.]]\n|}\nThere are several notions of \"greatest\" and \"least\" element in a poset ''P'', notably:\n* [[Greatest element]] and least element: An element ''g'' in ''P'' is a greatest element if for every element ''a'' in ''P'', ''a''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''g''. An element ''m'' in ''P'' is a least element if for every element ''a'' in ''P'', ''a''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''m''. A poset can only have one greatest or least element.\n* [[Maximal element]]s and minimal elements: An element ''g'' in P is a maximal element if there is no element ''a'' in ''P'' such that ''a''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''g''. Similarly, an element ''m'' in ''P'' is a minimal element if there is no element ''a'' in P such that ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m''. If a poset has a greatest element, it must be the unique maximal element, but otherwise there can be more than one maximal element, and similarly for least elements and minimal elements.\n* [[Upper and lower bounds]]: For a subset ''A'' of ''P'', an element ''x'' in ''P'' is an upper bound of ''A'' if ''a''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x'', for each element ''a'' in ''A''. In particular, ''x'' need not be in ''A'' to be an upper bound of ''A''. Similarly, an element ''x'' in ''P'' is a lower bound of ''A'' if ''a''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''x'', for each element ''a'' in ''A''. A greatest element of ''P'' is an upper bound of ''P'' itself, and a least element is a lower bound of ''P''.\n\nFor example, consider the [[positive integer]]s, ordered by divisibility: 1 is a least element, as it divides all other elements; on the other hand this poset does not have a greatest element (although if one would include 0 in the poset, which is a multiple of any integer, that would be a greatest element; see figure). This partially ordered set does not even have any maximal elements, since any ''g'' divides for instance 2''g'', which is distinct from it, so ''g'' is not maximal. If the number 1 is excluded, while keeping divisibility as ordering on the elements greater than 1, then the resulting poset does not have a least element, but any [[prime number]] is a minimal element for it. In this poset, 60 is an upper bound (though not a least upper bound) of the subset {2,3,5,10}, which does not have any lower bound (since 1 is not in the poset); on the other hand 2 is a lower bound of the subset of powers of 2, which does not have any upper bound.\n\n==Orders on the Cartesian product of partially ordered sets==\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n|[[File:Strict product order on pairs of natural numbers.svg|thumb|x150px|Reflexive closure of strict direct product order on ℕ×ℕ.

Note that this source refers to asymmetric relations as \"strictly antisymmetric\".</ref>).\n\nStrict and non-strict partial orders are closely related. A non-strict partial order may be converted to a strict partial order by removing all relationships of the form ''a'' &le; ''a''. Conversely, a strict partial order may be converted to a non-strict partial order by adjoining all relationships of that form. Thus, if \"≤\" is a non-strict partial order, then the corresponding strict partial order \"<\" is the [[irreflexive kernel]] given by:\n\n:''a'' < ''b'' if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b''\nConversely, if \"<\" is a strict partial order, then the corresponding non-strict partial order \"≤\" is the [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|reflexive closure]] given by:\n\n: ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if ''a'' < ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b''.\nThis is the reason for using the notation \"≤\".\n\nUsing the strict order \"<\", the relation \"''a'' is covered by ''b''\" can be equivalently rephrased as \"''a''<''b'', but not ''a''<''c''<''b'' for any ''c''\".\nStrict partial orders are useful because they correspond more directly to [[directed acyclic graph]]s (dags): every strict partial order is a dag, and the [[transitive closure]] of a dag is both a strict partial order and also a dag itself.\n\n==Inverse and order dual==\n\nThe inverse (or converse) of a partial order relation ≤ is the [[converse relation|converse]] of ≤. Typically denoted ≥, it is the relation that satisfies ''x''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''y'' if and only if ''y''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x''.  The inverse of a partial order relation is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric, and hence itself a partial order relation.  The [[Duality (order theory)|order dual]] of a partially ordered set is the same set with the partial order relation replaced by its inverse.  The irreflexive relation &gt; is to ≥ as &lt; is to ≤.\n\nAny one of the four relations ≤, &lt;, ≥, and &gt; on a given set uniquely determines the other three.\n\nIn general two elements ''x'' and ''y'' of a partial order may stand in any of four mutually exclusive relationships to each other: either ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'', or ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y'', or ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''y'', or ''x'' and ''y'' are ''incomparable'' (none of the other three).  A [[total order|totally ordered]] set is one that rules out this fourth possibility: all pairs of elements are comparable and we then say that [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]] holds.  The [[natural number]]s, the [[integer]]s, the [[Rational number|rationals]], and the [[Real number|real]]s are all totally ordered by their algebraic (signed) magnitude whereas the [[complex number]]s are not.  This is not to say that the complex numbers cannot be totally ordered; we could for example order them lexicographically via ''x''+'''i'''''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''u''+'''i'''''v'' if and only if ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''u'' or (''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''u'' and ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''v''), but this is not ordering by magnitude in any reasonable sense as it makes 1 greater than 100'''i'''.  Ordering them by absolute magnitude yields a preorder in which all pairs are comparable, but this is not a partial order since 1 and '''i''' have the same absolute magnitude but are not equal, violating antisymmetry.\n\n==Mappings between partially ordered sets==\n\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n|[[File:Birkhoff120.svg|thumb|x150px|Order isomorphism between the divisors of 120 (partially ordered by divisibility) and the divisor-closed subsets of {2,3,4,5,8} (partially ordered by set inclusion)]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n|[[File:Monotonic but nonhomomorphic map between lattices.gif|thumb|x150px|Order-preserving, but not order-reflecting (since ''f''(''u'')≤''f''(''v''), but not ''u''≤''v'') map.]]\n|}\nGiven two partially ordered sets (''S'',≤) and (''T'',≤), a function ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' is called '''[[order-preserving]]''', or '''[[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in order theory|monotone]]''', or '''isotone''', if for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', ''x''≤''y'' implies ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'').\nIf (''U'',≤) is also a partially ordered set, and both ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' and ''g'': ''T'' → ''U'' are order-preserving, their [[function composition|composition]] (''g''∘''f''): ''S'' → ''U'' is order-preserving, too.\nA function ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' is called '''order-reflecting''' if for all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''S'', ''f''(''x'') ≤ ''f''(''y'') implies ''x''≤''y''.\nIf ''f'' is both order-preserving and order-reflecting, then it is called an '''[[order-embedding]]''' of (''S'',≤) into (''T'',≤).\nIn the latter case, ''f'' is necessarily [[injective]], since ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y'') implies ''x'' ≤ ''y'' and ''y'' ≤ ''x''.

If an order-embedding ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' is [[bijective]], it is called an '''[[order isomorphism]]''', and the partial orders (''S'',≤) and (''T'',≤) are said to be '''isomorphic'''. Isomorphic orders have structurally similar [[Hasse diagram]]s (cf. right picture). It can be shown that if order-preserving maps ''f'': ''S'' → ''T'' and ''g'': ''T'' → ''S'' exist such that ''g''∘''f'' and ''f''∘''g'' yields the [[identity function]] on ''S'' and ''T'', respectively, then ''S'' and ''T'' are order-isomorphic.\n<ref name=\"dp02\">{{Cite book\n | last1 = Davey | first1 = B.

It is order-preserving: if ''x'' divides ''y'', then each prime divisor of ''x'' is also a prime divisor of ''y''. However, it is neither injective (since it maps both 12 and 6 to {2,3}) nor order-reflecting (since besides 12 doesn't divide 6). Taking instead each number to the set of its [[prime power]] divisors defines a map ''g'': ℕ → ℙ(ℕ) that is order-preserving, order-reflecting, and hence an order-embedding. It is not an order-isomorphism (since it e.g. doesn't map any number to the set {4}), but it can be made one by [[Injective function#Injections may be made invertible|restricting its codomain]] to ''g''(ℕ). The right picture shows a subset of ℕ and its isomorphic image under ''g''. The construction of such an order-isomorphism into a power set can be generalized to a wide class of partial orders, called [[distributive lattice]]s, see \"[[Birkhoff's representation theorem]]\".\n\n==Number of partial orders==\nSequence [{{fullurl:OEIS:A001035}} A001035] in [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] gives the number of partial orders on a set of ''n'' labeled elements:\n\n{{Number of relations}}\n\nThe number of strict partial orders is the same as that of partial orders.\n\nIf the count is made only [[up to]] isomorphism, the sequence 1, 1, 2, 5, 16, 63, 318, … {{OEIS|A000112}} is obtained.\n\n== Linear extension ==\nA partial order ≤<sup>*</sup> on a set ''X'' is an '''extension''' of another partial order ≤ on ''X'' provided that for all elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''X'', whenever ''x'' ≤ ''y'', it is also the case that ''x''&nbsp;≤<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;''y''. A [[linear extension]] is an extension that is also a linear (i.e., total) order.  Every partial order can be extended to a total order ([[order-extension principle]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Jech |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Jech |title=The Axiom of Choice |year=2008 |origyear=1973 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-46624-8}}</ref>\n\nIn [[computer science]], algorithms for finding linear extensions of partial orders (represented as the [[reachability]] orders of [[directed acyclic graph]]s) are called [[topological sorting]].\n\n== In category theory ==\nEvery poset (and every [[preorder]]) may be considered as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where, for objects ''x'' and ''y'', there is at most one [[morphism]] from ''x'' to ''y''. More explicitly, let hom(''x'', ''y'') = {(''x'', ''y'')} if ''x'' ≤ ''y'' (and otherwise the empty set) and (''y'', ''z'')∘(''x'', ''y'') = (''x'', ''z''). Such categories are sometimes called ''posetal''.\n\nPosets are [[Equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to one another if and only if they are [[Isomorphism of categories|isomorphic]]. In a poset, the smallest element, if it exists, is an [[initial object]], and the largest element, if it exists, is a [[terminal object]]. Also, every preordered set is equivalent to a poset. Finally, every subcategory of a poset is [[isomorphism-closed]].\n\n==Partial orders in topological spaces==\n{{Main|Partially ordered space}}\nIf ''P'' is a partially ordered set that has also been given the structure of a [[topological space]], then it is customary to assume that {{math|{(''a'', ''b'') : ''a'' &le; ''b''} }} is a [[closed (mathematics)|closed]] subset of the topological [[product space]] <math>P\\times P</math>.

(This definition generalizes the ''[[interval (mathematics)|interval]]'' definition for real numbers.)\n\nFor ''a'' ≤ ''b'', the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}} is the set of elements ''x'' satisfying ''a'' ≤ ''x'' ≤ ''b'' (i.e. ''a'' ≤ ''x'' and ''x'' ≤ ''b''). It contains at least the elements ''a'' and ''b''.\n\nUsing the corresponding strict relation \"<\", the [[open interval]] {{open-open|''a'', ''b''}} is the set of elements ''x'' satisfying ''a'' < ''x'' < ''b'' (i.e. ''a'' < ''x'' and ''x'' < ''b''). An open interval may be empty even if ''a'' < ''b''.  For example, the open interval {{open-open|1, 2}} on the integers is empty since there are no integers {{mvar|I}} such that {{math|1 < {{var|I}} < 2}}.\n\nThe ''half-open intervals'' {{closed-open|''a'', ''b''}} and {{open-closed|''a'', ''b''}} are defined similarly.\n\nSometimes the definitions are extended to allow ''a'' > ''b'', in which case the interval is empty.\n\nAn interval {{mvar|I}} is bounded if there exist elements ''a'' and ''b'' of ''P'' such that {{math|{{var|I}} ⊆ {{closed-closed|''a'', ''b''}}}}. Every interval that can be represented in interval notation is obviously bounded, but the converse is not true. For example, let {{math|1=''P'' = {{open-open|0, 1}} ∪ {{open-open|1, 2}} ∪ {{open-open|2, 3}}}} as a subposet of the [[real numbers]]. The subset {{open-open|1, 2}} is a bounded interval, but it has no [[infimum]] or [[supremum]] in ''P'', so it cannot be written in interval notation using elements of ''P''.\n\nA poset is called [[Locally finite poset|locally finite]] if every bounded interval is finite. For example, the [[integers]] are locally finite under their natural ordering. The lexicographical order on the cartesian product ℕ×ℕ is not locally finite, since {{math|(1, 2) ≤ (1, 3) ≤ (1, 4) ≤ (1, 5) ≤ ... ≤ (2, 1)}}.\nUsing the interval notation, the property \"''a'' is covered by ''b''\" can be rephrased equivalently as [''a'', ''b''] = {''a'', ''b''}.\n\nThis concept of an interval in a partial order should not be confused with the particular class of partial orders known as the [[interval order]]s.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[antimatroid]], a formalization of orderings on a set that allows more general families of orderings than posets\n*[[causal set]]\n*[[comparability graph]]\n*[[complete partial order]]\n*[[directed set]]\n*[[graded poset]]\n*[[incidence algebra]]\n*[[lattice (order)|lattice]]\n*[[locally finite poset]]\n*[[incidence algebra|Möbius function on posets]]\n*[[ordered group]]\n*[[poset topology]], a kind of topological space that can be defined from any poset\n*[[Scott continuity]] – continuity of a function between two partial orders.\n*[[semilattice]]\n*[[semiorder]]\n*[[stochastic dominance]]\n*[[strict weak ordering]] – strict partial order \"<\" in which the relation {{nowrap|\"neither ''a'' < ''b''}} {{nowrap|nor ''b'' < ''a''\"}} is transitive.\n*[[Zorn's lemma]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite journal|first=Jayant V. |last=Deshpande|title= On Continuity of a Partial Order|journal= Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|volume= 19|year= 1968|pages= 383–386|issue= 2|doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1968-0236071-7|postscript=.}}\n* {{cite book|first=Gunther|last=Schmidt|authorlink=Gunther Schmidt|year= 2010|title=Relational Mathematics|series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications|volume= 132|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76268-7}}\n* {{cite book|first=Bernd S.

Preorders are more general than [[equivalence relation]]s and (non-strict) [[partial order]]s, both of which are special cases of a preorder. An [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] preorder is a partial order, and a  [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] preorder is an [[equivalence relation]].\n\nThe name ''preorder'' comes from the idea that preorders (that are not partial orders) are 'almost' (partial) orders, but not quite; they are neither necessarily antisymmetric nor [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]].  Because a preorder is a binary relation, the symbol ≤ can be used as the notational device for the relation.  However, because they are not necessarily antisymmetric, some of the ordinary intuition associated to the symbol ≤ may not apply.  On the other hand, a preorder can be used, in a straightforward fashion, to define a partial order and an equivalence relation.  Doing so, however, is not always useful or worthwhile, depending on the problem domain being studied.\n\nIn words, when {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}, one may say that ''b'' ''covers'' ''a'' or that ''a'' ''precedes'' ''b'', or that ''b'' ''reduces'' to ''a''.  Occasionally, the notation ← or ≲ is used instead of ≤.\n\nTo every preorder, there corresponds a [[directed graph]], with elements of the set corresponding to vertices, and the order relation between pairs of elements corresponding to the directed edges between vertices. The converse is not true: most directed graphs are neither reflexive nor transitive. In general, the corresponding graphs may contain [[cycle (graph theory)|cycles]].  A preorder that is antisymmetric no longer has cycles; it is a partial order, and corresponds to a [[directed acyclic graph]].  A preorder that is symmetric is an equivalence relation; it can be thought of as having lost the direction markers on the edges of the graph.  In general, a preorder's corresponding directed graph may have many disconnected components.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\nConsider some [[set (mathematics)|set]] ''P'' and a [[binary relation]] ≤ on ''P''. Then ≤ is a '''preorder''', or '''quasiorder''', if it is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] and [[transitive relation|transitive]]; i.e., for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''P'', we have that:\n: ''a'' ≤ ''a'' (reflexivity)\n: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''c'' then ''a'' ≤ ''c'' (transitivity)\n\nA set that is equipped with a preorder is called a '''preordered set''' (or '''proset''').<ref>For \"proset\", see e.g. {{citation\n | last1 = Eklund | first1 = Patrik\n | last2 = Gähler | first2 = Werner\n | doi = 10.1002/mana.19901470123\n | journal = Mathematische Nachrichten\n | mr = 1127325\n | pages = 219–233\n | title = Generalized Cauchy spaces\n | volume = 147\n | year = 1990\n}}.</ref>\n\nIf a preorder is also [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]], that is, {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''a''}} implies {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}, then it is a [[partially ordered set|partial order]].\n\nOn the other hand, if it is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], that is, if {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} implies {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''a''}}, then it is an [[equivalence relation]].\n\nA preorder is [[total preorder|total]] if either {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} or {{nowrap|''b'' ≤ ''a''}} for all ''a'', ''b''.\n\nEquivalently, the notion of a preordered set ''P'' can be formulated in a [[category theory|categorical framework]] as a [[thin category]]; i.e., as a category with at most one morphism from an object to another. Here the [[object (category theory)|objects]] correspond to the elements of ''P'', and there is one morphism for objects which are related, zero otherwise. Alternately, a preordered set can be understood as an [[enriched category]], enriched over the category {{nowrap|'''2''' {{=}} (0 → 1)}}.\n\nA [[preordered class]] is a [[class (mathematics)|class]] equipped with a preorder. Every set is a class and so every preordered set is a preordered class.\n\n==Examples==\n* The [[reachability]] relationship in any [[directed graph]] (possibly containing cycles) gives rise to a preorder, where {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} in the preorder if and only if there is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' in the directed graph. Conversely, every preorder is the reachability relationship of a directed graph (for instance, the graph that has an edge from ''x'' to ''y'' for every pair {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} with {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}). However, many different graphs may have the same reachability preorder as each other. In the same way, reachability of [[directed acyclic graph]]s, directed graphs with no cycles, gives rise to [[partially ordered set]]s (preorders satisfying an additional antisymmetry property).\n* Every [[finite topological space]] gives rise to a preorder on its points by defining {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if and only if ''x'' belongs to every [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of ''y''. Every finite preorder can be formed as the [[Specialization (pre)order|specialization preorder]] of a topological space in this way. That is, there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between finite topologies and finite preorders. However, the relation between infinite topological spaces and their specialization preorders is not one-to-one.\n* A [[net (mathematics)|net]] is a [[directed set|directed]] preorder, that is, each pair of elements has an [[upper bound]].  The definition of convergence via nets is important in [[topology]], where preorders cannot be replaced by [[partially ordered set]]s without losing important features.\n* The relation defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if {{nowrap|f(''x'') ≤ f(''y'')}}, where ''f'' is a function into some preorder.\n* The relation defined by {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} if there exists some [[injective function|injection]] from ''x'' to ''y''. Injection may be replaced by [[surjection]], or any type of structure-preserving function, such as [[ring homomorphism]], or [[permutation]].\n* The [[embedding]] relation for countable [[total order]]ings.\n* The [[graph-minor]] relation in [[graph theory]].\n* A [[category (mathematics)|category]] with at most one [[morphism]] from any object ''x'' to any other object ''y'' is a preorder. Such categories are called [[thin category|thin]].  In this sense, categories \"generalize\" preorders by allowing more than one relation between objects: each morphism is a distinct (named) preorder relation.\n\nIn computer science, one can find examples of the following preorders.\n* [[Many-one reduction|Many-one]] and [[Turing reduction]]s are preorders on complexity classes.\n* The [[subtype|subtyping]] relations are usually preorders.\n* [[Simulation preorder]]s are preorders (hence the name).\n* [[Reduction relation]]s in [[abstract rewriting system]]s.\n* The [[encompassment preorder]] on the set of [[term (logic)|term]]s, defined by {{nowrap|''s'' ≤ ''t''}} if a [[term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterm]] of ''t'' is a [[substitution instance]] of ''s''.\n\nExample of a [[strict weak ordering#Total preorders|total preorder]]:\n* [[Preference]], according to common models.\n\n==Uses==\nPreorders play a pivotal role in several situations:\n* Every preorder can be given a topology, the [[Alexandrov topology]]; and indeed, every preorder on a set is in one-to-one correspondence with an Alexandrov topology on that set.\n* Preorders may be used to define [[interior algebra]]s.\n* Preorders provide the [[Kripke semantics]] for certain types of [[modal logic]].\n\n==Constructions==\n\nEvery binary relation R on a set S can be extended to a preorder on S by taking the [[transitive closure]] and [[Binary relation#Operations on binary relations|reflexive closure]], R<sup>+=</sup>.  The transitive closure indicates path connection in {{nowrap|R: ''x'' R<sup>+</sup> ''y''}} if and only if there is an R-[[Path (graph theory)|path]] from ''x'' to y.\n\nGiven a preorder ≲ on S one may define an [[equivalence relation]] ~ on S such that {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''b'' ≲ ''a''}}.  (The resulting relation is reflexive since a preorder is reflexive, transitive by applying transitivity of the preorder twice, and symmetric by definition.)\n\nUsing this relation, it is possible to construct a partial order on the quotient set of the equivalence, S / ~, the set of all [[equivalence class]]es of ~.  Note that if the preorder is R<sup>+=</sup>, {{nowrap|S / ~}} is the set of R-[[cycle (graph theory)|cycle]] equivalence classes: {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ [''y'']}} if and only if {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''y''}} or ''x'' is in an R-cycle with ''y''.  In any case, on {{nowrap|S / ~}} we can define {{nowrap|[''x''] ≤ [''y'']}} if and only if {{nowrap|''x'' ≲ ''y''}}. By the construction of ~, this definition is independent of the chosen representatives and the corresponding relation is indeed well-defined. It is readily verified that this yields a partially ordered set.\n\nConversely, from a partial order on a partition of a set S one can construct a preorder on S. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order).\n\nFor a preorder \"≲\", a relation \"<\" can be defined as {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} if and only if ({{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}} and not {{nowrap|''b'' ≲ ''a''}}), or equivalently, using the equivalence relation introduced above, (''a'' ≲ ''b'' and not ''a'' ~ ''b''). It is a [[strict partial order]]; every strict partial order can be the result of such a construction. If the preorder is antisymmetric, hence a partial order \"≤\", the equivalence is equality, so the relation \"<\" can also be defined as {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} if and only if ({{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}).\n\n(We do ''not'' define the relation \"<\" as {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} if and only if ({{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}} and {{nowrap|''a'' ≠ ''b''}}).  Doing so would cause problems if the preorder was not antisymmetric, as the resulting relation \"<\" would not be transitive (think of how equivalent non-equal elements relate).)\n\nConversely we have {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}} if and only if {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} or {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}}. This is the reason for using the notation \"≲\"; \"≤\" can be confusing for a preorder that is not antisymmetric, it may suggest that {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} implies that {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} or {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}}.\n\nNote that with this construction multiple preorders \"≲\" can give the same relation \"<\", so without more information, such as the equivalence relation, \"≲\" cannot be reconstructed from \"<\". Possible preorders include the following:\n* Define {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} as {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} or {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''b''}} (i.e., take the reflexive closure of the relation). This gives the partial order associated with the strict partial order \"<\" through reflexive closure; in this case the equivalence is equality, so we don't need the notations ≲ and ~.\n* Define {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}} as \"not {{nowrap|''b'' < ''a''}}\" (i.e., take the inverse complement of the relation), which corresponds to defining {{nowrap|''a'' ~ ''b''}} as \"neither {{nowrap|''a'' < ''b''}} nor {{nowrap|''b'' < ''a''}}\"; these relations ≲ and ~ are in general not transitive; however, if they are, ~ is an equivalence; in that case \"<\" is a [[strict weak order]]. The resulting preorder is [[total relation|total]], that is, a [[total preorder]].\n\nGiven a binary relation <math>R</math>, the complemented composition <math>R \\backslash R = \\overline{R^\\textsf{T} \\circ \\overline{R}}</math> forms a preorder called the [[heterogeneous relation#Preorder R\\R|left residual]], where <math>R^\\textsf{T}</math> denotes the [[converse relation]] of <math>R</math>, and <math>\\overline{R}</math> denotes the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] relation of <math>R</math>, while <math>\\circ</math> denotes [[relation composition]].\n\n==Number of preorders==\n{{Number of relations}}\n\nAs explained above, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between preorders and pairs (partition, partial order). Thus the number of preorders is the sum of the number of partial orders on every partition. For example:\n{{unordered list\n| for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}}:\n* 1 partition of 3, giving 1 preorder\n* 3 partitions of {{nowrap|2 + 1}}, giving {{nowrap|3 × 3 {{=}} 9}} preorders\n* 1 partition of {{nowrap|1 + 1 + 1}}, giving 19 preorders\n\nI.e., together, 29 preorders.\n| for {{nowrap|n {{=}} 4}}:\n* 1 partition of 4, giving 1 preorder\n* 7 partitions with two classes (4 of {{nowrap|3 + 1}} and 3 of {{nowrap|2 + 2}}), giving {{nowrap|7 × 3 {{=}} 21}} preorders\n* 6 partitions of {{nowrap|2 + 1 + 1}}, giving {{nowrap|6 × 19 {{=}} 114}} preorders\n* 1 partition of {{nowrap|1 + 1 + 1 + 1}}, giving 219 preorders\n\nI.e., together, 355 preorders.\n}}\n\n==Interval==\nFor {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''b''}}, the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{nowrap|[''a'', ''b'']}} is the set of points ''x'' satisfying {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''x''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ≲ ''b''}}, also written {{nowrap|''a'' ≲ ''x'' ≲ ''b''}}. It contains at least the points ''a'' and ''b''. One may choose to extend the definition to all pairs {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}.

In other words, if <math>\\leq</math> is a prewellordering on a set <math>X</math>, and if we define <math>\\sim</math> by\n:<math>x\\sim y\\iff x\\leq y \\land y\\leq x</math>\nthen <math>\\sim</math> is an [[equivalence relation]] on <math>X</math>, and <math>\\leq</math> induces a [[wellordering]] on the [[Quotient set|quotient]] <math>X/\\sim</math>.  The [[order-type]] of this induced wellordering is an [[ordinal number|ordinal]], referred to as the '''length''' of the prewellordering.\n\nA '''norm''' on a set <math>X</math> is a map from <math>X</math> into the ordinals.  Every norm induces a prewellordering; if <math>\\phi:X\\to Ord</math> is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by\n:<math>x\\leq y\\iff\\phi(x)\\leq\\phi(y)</math>\nConversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique '''regular norm''' (a norm <math>\\phi:X\\to Ord</math> is regular if, for any <math>x\\in X</math> and any <math>\\alpha<\\phi(x)</math>, there is <math>y\\in X</math> such that <math>\\phi(y)=\\alpha</math>).\n\n== Prewellordering property ==\nIf <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math> is a [[pointclass]] of subsets of some collection <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> of [[Polish space]]s, <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> closed under [[Cartesian product]], and if <math>\\leq</math> is a prewellordering of some subset <math>P</math> of some element <math>X</math> of <math>\\mathcal{F}</math>, then <math>\\leq</math> is said to be a <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math>-'''prewellordering''' of <math>P</math> if the relations <math><^*</math> and <math>\\leq^*</math> are elements of <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math>, where for <math>x,y\\in X</math>,\n# <math>x<^*y\\iff x\\in P\\land[y\\notin P\\lor\\{x\\leq y\\land y\\not\\leq x\\}]</math>\n# <math>x\\leq^* y\\iff x\\in P\\land[y\\notin P\\lor x\\leq y]</math>\n\n<math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math> is said to have the '''prewellordering property''' if every set in <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math> admits a <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Gamma}</math>-prewellordering.\n\nThe prewellordering property is related to the stronger [[scale property]]; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions.\n\n===Examples===\n<math>\\boldsymbol{\\Pi}^1_1</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^1_2</math> both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] alone.

In this sense it is more useful for modeling some everyday situations than a [[monotone consequence relation]] because the latter relation models facts in a more strict boolean fashion - something either follows under all circumstances or it does not.\n\n===Example===\nThe statement ''\"If a cake contains sugar then it tastes good\"'' implies under a monotone consequence relation the statement ''\"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it tastes good.\"'' Clearly this doesn't match our own understanding of cakes. By asserting ''\"If a cake contains sugar then it '''usually''' tastes good\"'' a rational consequence relation allows for a more realistic model of the real world, and certainly it does not automatically follow that ''\"If a cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\"''\n\nNote that if we also have the information ''\"If a cake contains sugar then it usually contains butter\"'' then we may legally conclude (under CMO) that ''\"If a cake contains sugar and butter then it usually tastes good.\"''. Equally in the absence of a statement such as ''\"If a cake contains sugar then usually it contains no soap''\" then we may legally conclude from RMO that ''\"If the cake contains sugar and soap then it usually tastes good.\"''\n\nIf this latter conclusion seems ridiculous to you then it is likely that you are subconsciously asserting your own preconceived knowledge about cakes when evaluating the validity of the statement. That is, from your experience you know that cakes which contain soap are likely to taste bad so you add to the system your own knowledge such as ''\"Cakes which contain sugar do not usually contain soap.\"'', even though this knowledge is absent from it. If the conclusion seems silly to you then you might consider replacing the word ''soap'' with the word ''eggs'' to see if it changes your feelings.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider the sentences:\n*''Young people are usually happy''\n*''Drug abusers are usually not happy''\n*''Drug abusers are usually young''\n\nWe may consider it reasonable to conclude:\n\n*''Young drug abusers are usually not happy''\n\nThis would not be a valid conclusion under a monotonic deduction system (omitting of course the word 'usually'), since the third sentence would contradict the first two. In contrast the conclusion follows immediately using the Gabbay-Makinson rules: applying the rule '''CMO''' to the last two sentences yields the result.\n\n==Consequences==\n\nThe following consequences follow from the above rules:\n\n:;MP : [[Modus ponens]] <math>\\frac{\\theta \\vdash \\phi \\quad \\theta \\vdash \\left( \\phi \\rightarrow \\psi \\right)}{\\theta \\vdash \\psi}</math>\n::MP is proved via the rules AND and RWE.\n\n:;CON : Conditionalisation <math>\\frac{\\theta \\wedge \\phi \\vdash \\psi}{\\theta \\vdash \\left(\\phi \\rightarrow \\psi \\right)}</math>\n\n:;CC : Cautious Cut <math>\\frac{\\theta \\vdash \\phi \\quad \\theta \\wedge \\phi \\vdash \\psi}{\\theta \\vdash \\psi}</math>\n::The notion of Cautious Cut simply encapsulates the operation of conditionalisation, followed by MP. It may seem redundant in this sense, but it is often used in proofs so it is useful to have a name for it to act as a shortcut.\n\n:;SCL : Supraclassity <math>\\frac{\\theta \\models \\phi}{\\theta \\vdash \\phi}</math>\n::SCL is proved trivially via REF and RWE.\n\n==Rational consequence relations via atom preferences==\n\nLet <math>L = \\{p_1, \\ldots , p_n\\}</math> be a finite language. An atom is a formula of the form <math>\\bigwedge_{i=1}^n p^\\epsilon_i</math> (where <math>p^1 = p</math> and <math>p^{-1} = \\neg p</math>). Notice that there is a unique valuation which makes any given atom true (and conversely each valuation satisfies precisely one atom). Thus an atom can be used to represent a preference about what we believe ought to be true.\n\nLet <math>At^L</math> be the set of all atoms in L. For <math>\\theta \\in</math> [[Sentential logic|SL]], define <math>S_\\theta = \\{\\alpha \\in At^L | \\alpha \\models^{SC} \\theta \\}</math>.\n\nLet <math>\\vec{s} = s_1, \\ldots , s_m</math> be a sequence of subsets of <math>At^L</math>. For <math>\\theta</math>, <math>\\phi</math> in SL, let the relation <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math> be such that <math>\\theta \\vdash_{\\vec{s}} \\phi</math> if one of the following holds:\n#<math>S_\\theta \\cap s_i = \\emptyset</math> for each <math>1 \\leq i \\leq m</math>\n#<math>S_\\theta \\cap s_i \\neq \\emptyset</math> for some <math>1 \\leq i \\leq m</math> and for the least such i, <math>S_\\theta \\cap s_i \\subseteq S_\\phi</math>.\n\nThen the relation  <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math>  is a rational consequence relation. This may easily be verified by checking directly that it satisfies the GM-conditions.\n\nThe idea behind the sequence of atom sets is that the earlier sets account for the most likely situations such as ''\"young people are usually law abiding\"'' whereas the later sets account for the less likely situations such as ''\"young joyriders are usually not law abiding\"''.\n\n===Notes===\n#By the definition of the relation <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math>, the relation is unchanged if we replace <math>s_2</math> with <math>s_2 \\setminus s_1</math>, <math>s_3</math> with <math>s_3 \\setminus s_2 \\setminus s_1</math> ... and <math>s_m</math> with <math>s_m \\setminus \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m-1} s_i</math>. In this way we make each <math>s_i</math> disjoint. Conversely it makes no difference to the rcr <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math> if we add to subsequent <math>s_i</math> atoms from any of the preceding <math>s_i</math>.\n\n==The representation theorem==\nIt can be proven that any rational consequence relation on a finite language is representable via a sequence of atom preferences above. That is, for any such rational consequence relation <math>\\vdash</math> there is a sequence <math>\\vec{s} = s_1, \\ldots , s_m</math> of subsets of <math>At^L</math> such that the associated rcr <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math> is the same relation: <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s} = \\vdash</math>\n\n===Notes===\n#By the above property of <math>\\vdash_\\vec{s}</math>, the representation of an rcr <math>\\vdash</math> need not be unique - if the <math>s_i</math> are not disjoint then they can be made so without changing the rcr and conversely if they are disjoint then each subsequent set can contain any of the atoms of the previous sets without changing the rcr.\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~jeff/theses/lee-hill.ps A mathematical paper in which the GM rules are defined]\n\n[[Category:Logical consequence]]\n[[Category:Binary relations]]\n[[Category:Non-classical logic]]"

      "text": "[[File:Semiorder.svg|thumb|An example of a semiorder, shown by its [[Hasse diagram]]. Two points are comparable when their vertical  coordinates differ by at least one unit (the spacing between consecutive solid blue lines).]]\nIn [[order theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''semiorder''' is a type of ordering that may be determined for a set of items with numerical scores by declaring two items to be incomparable when their scores are within a given [[margin of error]] of each other, and by using the numerical comparison of their scores when those scores are sufficiently far apart. Semiorders were introduced and applied in [[mathematical psychology]] by {{harvtxt|Luce|1956}} as a model of human preference without the assumption that indifference is [[transitive relation|transitive]]. They generalize [[strict weak ordering]]s, form a special case of [[partial order]]s and [[interval order]]s, and can be characterized among the partial orders by two forbidden four-item suborders.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''X'' be a set of items, and let < be a [[binary relation]] on ''X''.\nItems ''x'' and ''y'' are said to be ''incomparable'', written here as ''x''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''y'', if neither ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'' nor ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x'' is true. Then the pair (''X'',<) is a semiorder if it satisfies the following three axioms:<ref>{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}} describes an equivalent set of four axioms, the first two of which combine the definition of incomparability and the first axiom listed here.</ref>\n#For all ''x'' and ''y'', it is not possible for both ''x'' < ''y'' and ''y'' < ''x'' to be true. That is, < must be an [[asymmetric relation]]\n#For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''w'', if it is true that ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'', ''y''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''z'', and ''z''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''w'', then it must also be true that ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''w''.\n#For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''w'', if it is true that ''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y'', ''y''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''z'', and ''y''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''w'', then it cannot also be true that ''x''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''w'' and ''z''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''w'' simultaneously.\n\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:SemiorderAxiom3 svg.svg|thumb|100px|Axiom 3]]\n|}\n{| style=\"float:right\"\n| [[File:SemiorderAxiom2 svg.svg|thumb|100px|Axiom 2]]\n|}\nIt follows from the first axiom that ''x''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''x'', and therefore the second axiom (with ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'') implies that < is a [[transitive relation]].\n\nOne may define a [[partial order]] (''X'',≤) from a semiorder (''X'',<) by declaring that {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} whenever either {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} or {{nowrap|1=''x'' = ''y''}}. Of the axioms that a partial order is required to obey, reflexivity follows automatically from this definition, antisymmetry follows from the first semiorder axiom, and transitivity follows from the second semiorder axiom. Conversely, from a partial order defined in this way, the semiorder may be recovered by declaring that {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ ''y''}}. The first of the semiorder axioms listed above follows automatically from the axioms defining a partial order, but the others do not. The second and third semiorder axioms forbid partial orders of four items forming two disjoint chains: the second axiom forbids two chains of two items each, while the third item forbids a three-item chain with one unrelated item.\n\n==Properties==\nEvery strict weak ordering < is also a semi-order. More particularly, transitivity of < and transitivity of incomparability with respect to < together imply the above axiom 2, while transitivity of incomparability alone implies axiom 3. The semiorder shown in the top image is not a strict weak ordering, since the rightmost vertice is incomparable to its two closest left neighbors, but they are comparable.\n\nA relation is a semiorder if, and only if, it can be obtained as an [[interval order]] of unit length intervals <math>(\\ell _{i},\\ell _{i}+1)</math>.\n\nAccording to [[Amartya K. Sen]],<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.ihs.ac.at/publications/eco/visit_profs/blume/sen.pdf | author=Amartya K. Sen | title=Choice Functions and Revealed Preference | journal=[[The Review of Economic Studies]] | volume=38 | number=3 | pages=307–317 | date=Jul 1971 }} Here: Sect.10, p.314</ref> semi-orders were examined by [[Dean T. Jamison]] and [[Lawrence J. Lau]]<ref>{{cite report | url= | author=Dean T. Jamison and Lawrence J. Lau | title=Semiorders, Revealed Preference,  and the Theory of the Consumer Demand | institution=Stanford University,  Institute for Mathematical Studies in the Social Sciences | type=Technical Report No.31 | date=Jul 1970 }} Presented at the World Economics Congress, Cambridge, Sep 1970.</ref> and found to be a special case of [[quasitransitive relation]]s. In fact, every semiorder is a quasitransitive relation, since it is a transitive one. Moreover, adding to a given semiorder all its pairs of incomparable items keeps the resulting relation a quasitransitive one.<ref>{{cite report | arxiv=1806.05036v2 | author=Jochen Burghardt | title=Simple Laws about Nonprominent Properties of Binary Relations | type=Technical Report | date=Nov 2018 }} Here: Lemma 20, p.27. Since Luce modelled indifference between ''x'' and ''y'' as \"neither ''xRy'' nor ''yRx''\", while Sen modelled it as \"both ''xRy'' and ''xRy''\", Sen's remark on p.314 is likely to mean the latter property.</ref>\n\n===Utility theory===\nThe original motivation for introducing semiorders was to model human preferences without assuming (as strict weak orderings do) that incomparability is a [[transitive relation]]. For instance, if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' represent three quantities of the same material, and ''x'' and ''z'' differ by the smallest amount that is perceptible as a difference, while ''y'' is halfway between the two of them, then it is reasonable for a preference to exist between ''x'' and ''z'' but not between the other two pairs, violating transitivity.<ref>{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, p. 179.</ref>\n\nThus, suppose that ''X'' is a set of items, and ''u'' is a [[utility function]] that maps the members of ''X'' to [[real number]]s. A strict weak ordering can be defined on ''x'' by declaring two items to be incomparable when they have equal utilities, and otherwise using the numerical comparison, but this necessarily leads to a transitive incomparability relation. Instead, if one sets a numerical threshold (which may be normalized to 1) such that utilities within that threshold of each other are declared incomparable, then a semiorder arises.\n\nSpecifically, define a binary relation < from ''X'' and ''u'' by setting ''x'' < ''y'' whenever ''u''(''x'')&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''u''(''y'')&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1. Then (''X'',<) is a semiorder.<ref>{{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, Theorem 3 describes a more general situation in which the threshold for comparability between two utilities is a function of the utility rather than being identically 1.</ref> It may equivalently be defined as the [[interval order]] defined by the intervals [''u''(''x''),''u''(''x'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;1].<ref>{{harvtxt|Fishburn|1970}}.</ref>\n\nIn the other direction, not every semiorder can be defined from numerical utilities in this way. For instance, if a semiorder (''X'',<) includes an [[uncountable]] [[total order|totally ordered subset]] then there do not exist sufficiently many sufficiently well-spaced real-numbers to represent this subset numerically. However, every finite semiorder can be defined from a utility function.<ref>This result is typically credited to {{harvtxt|Scott|Suppes|1958}}; see, e.g., {{harvtxt|Rabinovitch|1977}}. However, {{harvtxt|Luce|1956}}, Theorem 2 proves a more general statement, that a finite semiorder can be defined from a utility function and a threshold function whenever a certain underlying weak order can be defined numerically. For finite semiorders, it is trivial that the weak order can be defined numerically with a unit threshold function.</ref> {{harvtxt|Fishburn|1973}} supplies a precise characterization of the semiorders that may be defined numerically.\n\n==Other results==\nThe number of distinct semiorders on ''n'' unlabeled items is given by the [[Catalan number]]s\n:<math>\\frac{1}{n+1}\\binom{2n}{n},</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Kim|Roush|1978}}.</ref>\nwhile the number of semiorders on ''n'' labeled items is given by the sequence\n:1, 1, 3, 19, 183, 2371, 38703, 763099, 17648823, ... {{OEIS|A006531}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chandon|Lemaire|Pouget|1978}}.</ref>\n\nAny finite semiorder has [[order dimension]] at most three.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rabinovitch|1978}}.</ref>\n\nAmong all partial orders with a fixed number of elements and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the partial orders that have the largest number of [[linear extension]]s are semiorders.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fishburn|Trotter|1992}}.</ref>\n\nSemiorders are known to obey the [[1/3–2/3 conjecture]]: in any finite semiorder that is not a total order, there exists a pair of elements ''x'' and ''y'' such that ''x'' appears earlier than ''y'' in between 1/3 and 2/3 of the linear extensions of the semiorder.<ref>{{harvtxt|Brightwell|1989}}.</ref>\n\nThe set of semiorders on an ''n''-element set is ''well-graded'': if two semiorders on the same set differ from each other by the addition or removal of ''k'' order relations, then it is possible to find a path of ''k'' steps from the first semiorder to the second one, in such a way that each step of the path adds or removes a single order relation and each intermediate state in the path is itself a semiorder.<ref>{{harvtxt|Doignon|Falmagne|1997}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Comparability graph|incomparability graph]]s of semiorders are called [[indifference graph]]s, and are a special case of the [[interval graph]]s.{{sfnp|Roberts|1969}}\n\nIf a semiorder is given only in terms of the order relation between its pairs of elements, then it is possible to construct a utility function that represents the order in time {{math|''O''(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}, where {{mvar|n}} is the number of elements in the semiorder.{{sfnp|Avery|1992}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Avery | first = Peter\n | doi = 10.1016/0196-6774(92)90010-A\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Journal of Algorithms\n | mr = 1146337\n | pages = 144–147\n | title = An algorithmic proof that semiorders are representable\n | volume = 13\n | year = 1992}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Brightwell | first = Graham R. | authorlink = Graham Brightwell\n | doi = 10.1007/BF00353656\n | issue = 4\n | journal = [[Order (journal)|Order]]\n | pages = 369–380\n | title = Semiorders and the 1/3–2/3 conjecture\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1989}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Chandon | first1 = J.-L.\n | last2 = Lemaire | first2 = J.\n | last3 = Pouget | first3 = J.\n | mr = 517680\n | issue = 62\n | journal = Centre de Mathématique Sociale.

      "title": "Separoid",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separoid",
      "text": "{{No footnotes|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''separoid''' is a [[binary relation]] between [[disjoint sets]] which is stable as an [[ideal (order theory)|ideal]] in the canonical order induced by [[subset|inclusion]]. Many mathematical objects which appear to be quite different, find a common generalisation in the framework of separoids; e.g., [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], configurations of [[convex set]]s, [[oriented matroid]]s, and [[polytopes]]. Any countable [[Category (mathematics)|category]] is an induced subcategory of separoids when they are endowed with [[homomorphism]]s [http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/search/?q=an:pre05158439&format=complete] (viz., mappings that preserve the so-called ''[[Radon's theorem|minimal Radon partitions]]'').\n\nIn this general framework, some results and invariants of different categories turn out to be special cases of the same aspect; e.g., the pseudoachromatic number from graph theory and the [[Tverberg theorem]] from combinatorial convexity are simply two faces of the same aspect, namely, complete colouring of separoids.\n\n== The axioms ==\n\nA '''separoid''' [http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/search/?q=an:1090.52005&format=complete] is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>S</math> endowed with a binary relation <math>\\mid\\ \\subseteq2^S\\times2^S</math> on its [[power set]], which satisfies the following simple properties for <math>A,B\\subseteq S</math>:\n\n: <math>A\\mid B\\Leftrightarrow B\\mid A,</math>\n: <math>A\\mid B\\Rightarrow A\\cap B=\\varnothing,</math>\n: <math>A\\mid B \\hbox{ and } A'\\subset A\\Rightarrow A'\\mid B.</math>\n\nA related pair <math>A\\mid B</math> is called a '''separation''' and we often say that ''A is separated from B''. It is enough to know the ''maximal'' separations to reconstruct the separoid.\n\nA [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] <math>\\varphi\\colon S\\to T</math> is a [[morphism]] of separoids if the preimages of separations are separations; that is, for <math>A,B\\subseteq T</math>\n\n: <math>A\\mid B\\Rightarrow\\varphi^{-1}(A)\\mid\\varphi^{-1}(B).</math>\n\n== Examples ==\n\nExamples of separoids can be found in almost every branch of [[mathematics]]. Here we list just a few.\n\n1. Given a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] G=(V,E), we can define a separoid on its [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] by saying that two (disjoint) subsets of V, say A and B, are separated if there are no [[Edge (graph theory)|edges]] going from one to the other; i.e.,\n\n: <math>A\\mid B\\Leftrightarrow\\forall a\\in A\\hbox{ and }b\\in B\\colon ab\\not\\in E.</math>\n\n2. Given an oriented matroid [http://www.zentralblatt-math.org/zmath/en/search/?q=an:1109.52016&format=complete] ''M'' = (''E'',''T''), given in terms of its topes ''T'', we can define a separoid on ''E'' by saying that two subsets are separated if they are contained in opposite signs of a tope. In other words, the topes of an oriented matroid are the ''maximal'' separations of a separoid. This example includes, of course, all [[directed graph]]s.\n\n3. Given a family of objects in an [[Euclidean space]], we can define a separoid in it by saying that two subsets are separated if there exists a [[hyperplane]] that ''separates'' them; i.e., leaving them in the two opposite sides of it.\n\n4. Given a [[topological space]], we can define a separoid saying that two subsets are separated if there exist two disjoint [[open set]]s which contains them (one for each of them).\n\n== The basic lemma ==\n\nEvery separoid can be represented with a family of convex sets in some Euclidean space and their separations by hyperplanes.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Strausz Ricardo; \"Separoides\".

The series composition of ''P'' and ''Q'', written {{nowrap|''P''; ''Q''}},<ref name=\"accdc\"/> {{nowrap|''P'' * ''Q''}},<ref name=\"m\"/> or  {{nowrap|''P'' ⧀ ''Q''}},<ref name=\"bgr\"/>is the partially ordered set whose elements are the [[disjoint union]] of the elements of ''P'' and ''Q''.  In {{nowrap|''P''; ''Q''}}, two elements ''x'' and ''y'' that both belong to ''P'' or that both belong to ''Q'' have the same order relation that they do in ''P'' or ''Q'' respectively. However, for every pair ''x'', ''y'' where ''x'' belongs to ''P'' and ''y'' belongs to ''Q'', there is an additional order relation {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} in the series composition.  Series composition is an [[associative operation]]: one can write {{nowrap|''P''; ''Q''; ''R''}} as the series composition of three orders, without ambiguity about how to combine them pairwise, because both of the parenthesizations {{nowrap|(''P''; ''Q''); ''R''}} and {{nowrap|''P''; (''Q''; ''R'')}} describe the same partial order. However, it is not a [[commutative operation]], because switching the roles of ''P'' and ''Q'' will produce a different partial order that reverses the order relations of pairs with one element in ''P'' and one in ''Q''.<ref name=\"bgr\"/>\n\nThe parallel composition of ''P'' and ''Q'', written ''P''&nbsp;||&nbsp;''Q'',<ref name=\"accdc\"/> {{nowrap|''P'' + ''Q''}},<ref name=\"m\"/> or {{nowrap|''P'' ⊕ ''Q''}},<ref name=\"bgr\"/> is defined similarly, from the disjoint union of the elements in ''P'' and the elements in ''Q'', with pairs of elements that both belong to ''P'' or both to ''Q'' having the same order as they do in ''P'' or ''Q'' respectively. In ''P''&nbsp;||&nbsp;''Q'', a pair ''x'', ''y'' is incomparable whenever ''x'' belongs to ''P'' and ''y'' belongs to ''Q''. Parallel composition is both commutative and associative.<ref name=\"bgr\"/>\n\nThe class of series-parallel partial orders is the set of partial orders that can be built up from single-element partial orders using these two operations. Equivalently, it is the smallest set of partial orders that includes the single-element partial order and is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the series and parallel composition operations.<ref name=\"bgr\"/><ref name=\"m\"/>\n\nA [[weak order]] is the series parallel partial order obtained from a sequence of composition operations in which all of the parallel compositions are performed first, and then the results of these compositions are combined using only series compositions.<ref name=\"m\"/>\n\n==Forbidden suborder characterization==\nThe partial order ''N'' with the four elements ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' and exactly the three order relations {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≥ ''c'' ≤ ''d''}} is an example of a [[Fence (mathematics)|fence]] or zigzag poset; its [[Hasse diagram]] has the shape of the capital letter \"N\". It is not series-parallel, because there is no way of splitting it into the series or parallel composition of two smaller partial orders. A partial order ''P'' is said to be N-free if there does not exist a set of four elements in ''P'' such that the restriction of ''P'' to those elements is order-isomorphic to ''N''. The series-parallel partial orders are exactly the nonempty finite N-free partial orders.<ref name=\"bgr\"/><ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"vtl\"/>\n\nIt follows immediately from this (although it can also be proven directly) that any nonempty restriction of a series-parallel partial order is itself a series-parallel partial order.<ref name=\"bgr\"/>\n\n==Order dimension==\nThe [[order dimension]] of a partial order ''P'' is the minimum size of a realizer of ''P'', a set of [[linear extension]]s of ''P'' with the property that, for every two distinct elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''P'', {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} in ''P'' if and only if ''x'' has an earlier position than ''y'' in every linear extension of the realizer. Series-parallel partial orders have order dimension at most two. If ''P'' and ''Q'' have realizers {''L''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>} and {''L''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>4</sub>}, respectively, then {''L''<sub>1</sub>''L''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>2</sub>''L''<sub>4</sub>} is a realizer of the series composition {{nowrap|''P''; ''Q''}}, and {''L''<sub>1</sub>''L''<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;''L''<sub>4</sub>''L''<sub>2</sub>} is a realizer of the parallel composition ''P''&nbsp;||&nbsp;''Q''.<ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"vtl\"/> A partial order is series-parallel if and only if it has a realizer in which one of the two permutations is the identity and the other is a [[separable permutation]].\n\nIt is known that a partial order ''P'' has order dimension two if and only if there exists a conjugate order ''Q'' on the same elements, with the property that any two distinct elements ''x'' and ''y'' are comparable on exactly one of these two orders. In the case of series parallel partial orders, a conjugate order that is itself series parallel may be obtained by performing a sequence of composition operations in the same order as the ones defining ''P'' on the same elements, but performing a series composition for each parallel composition in the decomposition of ''P'' and vice versa. More strongly, although a partial order may have many different conjugates, every conjugate of a series parallel partial order must itself be series parallel.<ref name=\"m\"/>\n\n==Connections to graph theory==\nAny partial order may be represented (usually in more than one way) by a [[directed acyclic graph]] in which there is a path from ''x'' to ''y'' whenever ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of the partial order with {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}}. The graphs that represent series-parallel partial orders in this way have been called vertex series parallel graphs, and their [[transitive reduction]]s (the graphs of the [[covering relation]]s of the partial order) are called minimal vertex series parallel graphs.<ref name=\"vtl\"/> Directed trees and (two-terminal) [[series parallel graph]]s are examples of minimal vertex series parallel graphs; therefore, series parallel partial orders may be used to represent reachability relations in directed trees and series parallel graphs.<ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"vtl\"/>\n\nThe [[comparability graph]] of a partial order is the [[undirected graph]] with a vertex for each element and an undirected edge for each pair of distinct elements ''x'', ''y'' with either {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''y''}} or {{nowrap|''y'' ≤ ''x''}}. That is, it is formed from a minimal vertex series parallel graph by forgetting the [[orientation (graph theory)|orientation]] of each edge. The comparability graph of a series-partial order is a [[cograph]]: the series and parallel composition operations of the partial order give rise to operations on the comparability graph that form the disjoint union of two subgraphs or that connect two subgraphs by all possible edges; these two operations are the basic operations from which cographs are defined. Conversely, every cograph is the comparability graph of a series-parallel partial order. If a partial order has a cograph as its comparability graph, then it must be a series-parallel partial order, because every other kind of partial order has an N suborder that would correspond to an induced four-vertex path in its comparability graph, and such paths are forbidden in cographs.<ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"j\"/>\n\n==Computational complexity==\nThe forbidden suborder characterization of series-parallel partial orders can be used as a basis for an algorithm that tests whether a given binary relation is a series-parallel partial order, in an amount of time that is linear in the number of related pairs.<ref name=\"m\"/><ref name=\"vtl\"/> Alternatively, if a partial order is described as the [[reachability]] order of a [[directed acyclic graph]], it is possible to test whether it is a series-parallel partial order, and if so compute its transitive closure, in time proportional to the number of vertices and edges in the transitive closure; it remains open whether the time to recognize series-parallel reachability orders can be improved to be linear in the size of the input graph.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Ma | first1 = Tze-Heng\n | last2 = Spinrad | first2 = Jeremy\n | doi = 10.1007/BF00383402\n | issue = 2\n | journal = Order\n | pages = 175–183\n | title = Transitive closure for restricted classes of partial orders\n | volume = 8\n | year = 1991}}.</ref>\n\nIf a series-parallel partial order is represented as an [[expression tree]] describing the series and parallel composition operations that formed it, then the elements of the partial order may be represented by the leaves of the expression tree. A comparison between any two elements may be performed algorithmically by searching for the [[lowest common ancestor]] of the corresponding two leaves; if that ancestor is a parallel composition, the two elements are incomparable, and otherwise the order of the series composition operands determines the order of the elements. In this way, a series-parallel partial order on ''n'' elements may be represented in O(''n'') space with O(1) time to determine any comparison value.<ref name=\"m\"/>\n\nIt is [[NP-complete]] to test, for two given series-parallel partial orders ''P'' and ''Q'', whether ''P'' contains a restriction isomorphic to ''Q''.<ref name=\"vtl\"/>\n\nAlthough the problem of counting the number of linear extensions of an arbitrary partial order is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]],<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Brightwell | first1 = Graham R.\n | last2 = Winkler | first2 = Peter | author2-link = Peter Winkler\n | doi = 10.1007/BF00383444\n | issue = 3\n | journal = [[Order (journal)|Order]]\n | pages = 225–242\n | title = Counting linear extensions\n | volume = 8\n | year = 1991}}.</ref> it may be solved in polynomial time for series-parallel partial orders.

An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a [[linear extension]] of that partial order.\n\n== Strict total order ==\nFor each (non-strict) total order ≤ there is an associated [[Asymmetric relation|asymmetric]] (hence [[Reflexive relation|irreflexive]]) [[Transitive relation|transitive]] [[Connex relation|semiconnex]] relation <, called a '''strict total order''' or '''strict semiconnex order''',{{sfn|Schmidt|Ströhlein|1993|p=32}} which can be defined in two equivalent ways:\n* ''a'' < ''b'' if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b''\n* ''a'' < ''b'' if not ''b'' ≤ ''a'' (i.e., < is the [[binary relation#Operations on binary relations|inverse]] of the [[Binary relation#Complement|complement]] of ≤)\n\nProperties:\n* The relation is transitive: ''a'' < ''b'' and ''b'' < ''c'' implies ''a'' < ''c''.\n* The relation is [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomous]]: exactly one of ''a'' < ''b'', ''b'' < ''a'' and ''a'' = ''b'' is true.\n* The relation is a [[strict weak order]], where the associated equivalence is equality.\n\nWe can work the other way and start by choosing < as a transitive trichotomous binary relation; then a total order ≤ can be defined in two equivalent ways:\n* ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if ''a'' < ''b'' or ''a'' = ''b''\n* ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if not ''b'' < ''a''\n\nTwo more associated orders are the complements ≥ and >, completing the [[tuple|quadruple]] {<, >, ≤, ≥}.\n\nWe can define or explain the way a set is totally ordered by any of these four relations; the notation implies whether we are talking about the non-strict or the strict total order.\n\n== Examples ==\n* The letters of the alphabet ordered by the standard [[Alphabetical order|dictionary order]], e.g., {{math|''A'' < ''B'' < ''C''}} etc.\n* Any subset of a totally ordered set {{math|''X''}} is totally ordered for the restriction of the order on {{math|''X''}}. \n* The unique order on the empty set, {{math|∅}}, is a total order.\n* Any set of [[cardinal number]]s or  [[ordinal number]]s (more strongly, these are [[well-order]]s).\n* If {{math|''X''}} is any set and {{math|''f''}}{{math|}} an [[injective function]] from {{math|''X''}} to a totally ordered set then {{math|''f''}} induces a total ordering on {{math|''X''}} by setting {{math|''x''<sub>1</sub> < ''x''<sub>2</sub>}} if and only if {{math|''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>) < ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>)}}.\n* The [[lexicographical order]] on the [[Cartesian product]] of a family of totally ordered sets, [[Index set|indexed]] by a [[well-order|well ordered set]], is itself a total order.  \n* The set of ''[[real numbers]]'' ordered by the usual less than ({{math|<}}) or greater than ({{math|>}}) relations is totally ordered, hence also the subsets of ''[[natural numbers]]'', ''[[integers]]'', and ''[[rational numbers]]''. Each of these can be shown to be the unique (to within [[isomorphism]]) ''smallest'' example of a totally ordered set with a certain property, (a total order {{math|''A''}} is the ''smallest'' with a certain property if whenever {{math|''B''}} has the property, there is an order isomorphism from {{math|''A''}} to a subset of {{math|''B''}}):\n** The ''natural numbers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set with no [[upper bound]].\n** The ''integers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set with neither an upper nor a [[lower bound]].\n** The ''rational numbers'' comprise the smallest totally ordered set which is ''[[dense order|dense]]'' in the real numbers. The definition of density used here says that for every {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} in the real numbers such that {{math|''a'' < ''b''}}, there is a {{math|''q''}} in the rational numbers such that {{math|''a'' < ''q'' < ''b''}}.\n** The ''real numbers'' comprise the smallest unbounded totally ordered set that is [[connectedness|connected]] in the order topology (defined below).\n* [[Ordered field]]s are totally ordered by definition. They include the rational numbers and the real numbers. Every ordered field contains an ordered subfield that is isomorphic to the rational numbers. Any [[Dedekind-complete]] ordered field is isomorphic to the real numbers.\n\n== Chains ==\n* The term '''chain''' is a synonym for a totally ordered set, but the term is often used to mean a totally ordered [[subset]] of some [[partially ordered set]], for example in [[Zorn's lemma]].<ref>{{cite book | author=Paul R. Halmos | title=Naive Set Theory | location=Princeton | publisher=Nostrand | year=1968 }} Here: Chapter 14</ref> \n* An '''ascending chain''' is a totally ordered set having a (unique) minimal element, while a '''descending chain''' is a totally ordered set having a (unique) maximal element.{{fact|date=January 2019}} See also [[Infinite descending chain]] and [[Ascending chain condition]] for this notion.\n: The '''height''' of a poset denotes the [[cardinality]] of its largest chain in this sense.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n: For example, consider the set of all subsets of the [[integer]]s, [[partially ordered]] by [[Subset|inclusion]]. Then the set { ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> : ''n'' is a [[natural number]]}, where ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is the set of natural numbers below ''n'', is a chain in this ordering, as it is totally ordered under inclusion:  If ''n''&le;''k'', then ''I''<sub>''n''</sub> is a subset of ''I''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\n== Further concepts ==\n=== Lattice theory ===\nOne may define a totally ordered set as a particular kind of [[Lattice (order)|lattice]], namely one in which we have\n: <math>\\{a\\vee b, a\\wedge b\\} = \\{a, b\\}</math> for all ''a'', ''b''.\n\nWe then write ''a'' ≤ ''b'' [[if and only if]] <math>a = a\\wedge b</math>. Hence a totally ordered set is a [[distributive lattice]].\n\n=== Finite total orders ===\nA simple [[counting]] argument will verify that any non-empty finite totally ordered set (and hence any non-empty subset thereof) has a least element. Thus every finite total order is in fact a [[well order]].  Either by direct proof or by observing that every well order is [[order isomorphic]] to an [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] one may show that every finite total order is [[order isomorphic]] to an [[initial segment]] of the natural numbers ordered by <. In other words, a total order on a set with ''k'' elements induces a bijection with the first ''k'' natural numbers. Hence it is common to index finite total orders or well orders with [[order type]] &omega; by natural numbers in a fashion which respects the ordering (either starting with zero or with one).\n\n=== Category theory ===\nTotally ordered sets form a [[subcategory|full subcategory]] of the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of [[partially ordered set]]s, with the [[morphism]]s being maps which respect the orders, i.e. maps ''f'' such that if ''a'' ≤ ''b'' then ''f''(''a'') ≤ ''f''(''b'').\n\nA [[bijection|bijective]] [[map (mathematics)|map]] between two totally ordered sets that respects the two orders is an [[isomorphism]] in this category.\n\n=== Order topology ===\nFor any totally ordered set ''X'' we can define the '''[[interval (mathematics)|open interval]]s''' (''a'', ''b'') = {''x'' : ''a'' < ''x'' and ''x'' < ''b''}, (−∞, ''b'') = {''x'' : ''x'' < ''b''}, (''a'', ∞) = {''x'' : ''a'' < ''x''} and (−∞, ∞) = ''X''.  We can use these open intervals to define a [[topology]] on any ordered set, the [[order topology]].\n\nWhen more than one order is being used on a set one talks about the order topology induced by a particular order.  For instance if '''N''' is the natural numbers, < is less than and > greater than we might refer to the order topology on '''N''' induced by < and the order topology on '''N''' induced by > (in this case they happen to be identical but will not in general).\n\nThe order topology induced by a total order may be shown to be hereditarily [[Normal space|normal]].\n\n=== Completeness ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Completely distributive lattice]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nA totally ordered set is said to be '''complete''' if every nonempty subset that has an [[upper bound]], has a [[least upper bound]]. For example, the set of [[real number]]s '''R''' is complete but the set of [[rational number]]s '''Q''' is not.\n\nThere are a number of results relating properties of the order topology to the completeness of X:\n* If the order topology on ''X'' is connected, ''X'' is complete.\n* ''X'' is connected under the order topology if and only if it is complete and there is no ''gap'' in ''X'' (a gap is two points ''a'' and ''b'' in ''X'' with ''a'' < ''b'' such that no ''c'' satisfies ''a'' < ''c'' < ''b''.)\n* ''X'' is complete if and only if every bounded set that is closed in the order topology is compact.\n\nA totally ordered set (with its order topology) which is a [[complete lattice]] is [[Compact space|compact]]. Examples are the closed intervals of real numbers, e.g. the [[unit interval]] [0,1], and the [[affinely extended real number system]] (extended real number line). There are order-preserving [[homeomorphism]]s between these examples.\n\n=== Sums of orders ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Scattered_order]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] -->\nFor any two disjoint total  orders <math>(A_1,\\le_1)</math>  and <math>(A_2,\\le_2)</math>, there is a natural order <math>\\le_+</math> on the set <math>A_1\\cup A_2</math>, which is called the sum of the two orders or sometimes just <math>A_1+A_2</math>: \n: For <math>x,y\\in A_1\\cup A_2</math>, <math>x\\le_+ y</math> holds if and only if one of the following holds:\n:# <math>x,y\\in A_1</math> and <math>x\\le_1 y</math>\n:# <math>x,y\\in A_2</math> and <math>x\\le_2 y</math>\n:# <math>x\\in A_1</math> and <math>y\\in A_2</math>\nIntutitively, this means that the elements of the second set are added on top of the elements of the first set.\n\nMore generally, if <math>(I,\\le)</math> is a totally ordered index set, and for each <math>i\\in I</math> the structure <math>(A_i,\\le_i)</math> is a linear order, where the sets <math>A_i</math> are pairwise disjoint, then the natural total order on <math>\\bigcup_i A_i</math> is defined by \n: For <math>x,y\\in \\bigcup_{i\\in I} A_i</math>, <math>x\\le y</math> holds if: \n:# Either there is some <math>i\\in I</math> with <math> x\\le_i y </math>\n:# or there are  some <math>i<j</math> in <math>I</math>  with <math> x\\in A_i</math>,  <math> y\\in A_j</math>\n\n== Orders on the Cartesian product of totally ordered sets ==\nIn order of increasing strength, i.e., decreasing sets of pairs, three of the possible orders on the [[Cartesian product]] of two totally ordered sets are:\n* [[Lexicographical order]]: (''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'') if and only if ''a'' < ''c'' or (''a'' = ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''). This is a total order. \n* (''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'') if and only if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d'' (the [[product order]]). This is a partial order. \n* (''a'',''b'') ≤ (''c'',''d'') if and only if (''a'' < ''c'' and ''b'' < ''d'') or (''a'' = ''c'' and ''b'' = ''d'') (the reflexive closure of the [[Direct product#Direct product of binary relations|direct product]] of the corresponding strict total orders). This is also a partial order.\n\nAll three can similarly be defined for the Cartesian product of more than two sets.\n\nApplied to the [[vector space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, each of these make it an [[ordered vector space]].\n\nSee also [[Partially ordered set#Examples|examples of partially ordered sets]].\n\nA real function of ''n'' real variables defined on a subset of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> [[Strict weak ordering#Function|defines a strict weak order and a corresponding total preorder]] on that subset.\n\n== Related structures ==\nA binary relation that is antisymmetric, transitive, and reflexive (but not necessarily total) is a [[partial order]].\n\nA [[group (mathematics)|group]] with a compatible total order is a [[totally ordered group]].\n\nThere are only a few nontrivial structures that are (interdefinable as) reducts of a total order. Forgetting the orientation results in a [[betweenness relation]]. Forgetting the location of the ends results in a [[cyclic order]]. Forgetting both data results in a [[separation relation]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Macpherson |first=H.

      "text": "{{Other uses|Closure (disambiguation)}}\n{{About|the transitive closure of a binary relation|the transitive closure of a set|transitive set#Transitive closure}}\n \nIn [[mathematics]], the '''transitive closure''' of a [[binary relation]] ''R'' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X'' is the smallest relation on ''X'' that contains ''R'' and is [[Transitive relation|transitive]].\n\nFor example,  if ''X'' is a set of airports and ''xRy'' means \"there is a direct flight from airport ''x'' to airport ''y''\" (for ''x'' and ''y'' in ''X''), then the transitive closure of ''R'' on ''X'' is the relation ''R''<sup>+</sup> such that ''x R<sup>+</sup> y'' means \"it is possible to fly from ''x'' to ''y'' in one or more flights\". Informally, the ''transitive closure'' gives you the set of all places you can get to from any starting place.\n\nMore formally, the transitive closure of a binary relation ''R'' on a set ''X'' is the [[transitive relation]] ''R''<sup>+</sup> on set ''X'' such that ''R''<sup>+</sup> contains ''R'' and ''R''<sup>+</sup> is minimal {{harvtxt|Lidl|Pilz|1998|p=337}}. If the binary relation itself is transitive, then the transitive closure is that same binary relation; otherwise, the transitive closure is a different relation.\n\n== Transitive relations and examples ==\n\nA relation ''R'' on a set ''X'' is transitive if, for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''X'', whenever {{nowrap|''x R y''}} and {{nowrap|''y R z''}} then {{nowrap|''x R z''}}. Examples of transitive relations include the equality relation on any set, the \"less than or equal\" relation on any linearly ordered set, and the relation \"''x'' was born before ''y''\" on the set of all people. Symbolically, this can be denoted as: if {{nowrap|''x'' < ''y''}} and {{nowrap|''y'' < ''z''}} then {{nowrap|''x'' < ''z''}}.\n\nOne example of a non-transitive relation is \"city ''x'' can be reached via a direct flight from city ''y''\" on the set of all cities. Simply because there is a direct flight from one city to a second city, and a direct flight from the second city to the third, does not imply there is a direct flight from the first city to the third. The transitive closure of this relation is a different relation, namely \"there is a sequence of direct flights that begins at city ''x'' and ends at city ''y''\". Every relation can be extended in a similar way to a transitive relation.\n\nAn example of a non-transitive relation with a less meaningful transitive closure is \"''x'' is the [[day of the week]] after ''y''\". The transitive closure of this relation is \"some day ''x'' comes after a day ''y'' on the calendar\", which is trivially true for all days of the week ''x'' and ''y'' (and thus equivalent to the [[Cartesian product|Cartesian square]], which is \"''x'' and ''y'' are both days of the week\").\n\n== Existence and description ==\nFor any relation ''R'', the transitive closure of ''R'' always exists. To see this, note that the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of any [[indexed family|family]] of transitive relations is again transitive. Furthermore, [[there exists]] at least one transitive relation containing ''R'', namely the trivial one: ''X'' × ''X''. The transitive closure of ''R'' is then given by the intersection of all transitive relations containing ''R''.\n\nFor finite sets, we can construct the transitive closure step by step, starting from ''R'' and adding transitive edges.\nThis gives the intuition for a general construction. For any set ''X'', we\ncan prove that transitive closure is given by the following expression\n:<math>R^{+}=\\bigcup_{i\\in \\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}} R^i.</math>\nwhere <math>R^i</math> is the ''i''-th power of ''R'', defined inductively by\n:<math>R^1 = R</math>\nand, for <math>i>0</math>,\n:<math>R^{i+1} = R \\circ R^i</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes [[composition of relations]].\n\nTo show that the above definition of ''R''<sup>+</sup> is the least transitive relation containing ''R'', we show that it contains ''R'', that it is transitive, and that it is the smallest set with both of those characteristics.\n\n* <math>R \\subseteq R^{+}</math>: <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math> contains all of the <math>\\displaystyle R^i</math>, so in particular  <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math> contains <math>\\displaystyle R</math>.\n* <math>\\displaystyle R^{+}</math> is transitive: every element of <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math> is in one of the <math>\\displaystyle R^i</math>, so <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math> must be transitive by the following reasoning: if <math>(s_1, s_2)\\in R^j</math> and <math>(s_2, s_3)\\in R^k</math>, then from composition's associativity, <math>(s_1, s_3)\\in R^{j+k}</math> (and thus in <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math>) because of the definition of <math>\\displaystyle R^i</math>.\n* <math>\\displaystyle R^{+}</math> is minimal: Let <math>\\displaystyle G</math> be any transitive relation containing <math>\\displaystyle R</math>, we want to show that <math>R^{+} \\subseteq G</math>. It is sufficient to show that for every <math>i>0</math>, <math>R^i\\subseteq G</math>. Well, since <math>\\displaystyle G</math> contains <math>\\displaystyle R</math>, <math>R^1\\subseteq G</math>. And since <math>\\displaystyle G</math> is transitive, whenever <math>R^i\\subseteq G</math>, <math>R^{i+1}\\subseteq G</math> according to the construction of <math>R^i</math> and what it means to be transitive. Therefore, by induction, <math>\\displaystyle G</math> contains every <math>R^i</math>, and thus also <math>\\displaystyle R^+</math>.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of two transitive relations is transitive.\n\nThe [[union (set theory)|union]] of two transitive relations need not be transitive. To preserve transitivity, one must take the transitive closure. This occurs, for example, when taking the union of two [[equivalence relation]]s or two [[preorder]]s. To obtain a new equivalence relation or preorder one must take the transitive closure (reflexivity and symmetry—in the case of equivalence relations—are automatic).\n\n== In graph theory ==\n[[File:Transitive-closure.svg|thumb|right|alt=Transitive closure constructs the output graph from the input graph.|Transitive closure constructs the output graph from the input graph.]]\nIn [[computer science]], the concept of transitive closure can be thought of as constructing a data structure that makes it possible to answer [[reachability]] questions. That is, can one get from node ''a'' to node ''d'' in one or more hops?  A binary relation tells you only that node a is connected to node ''b'', and that node ''b'' is connected to node ''c'', etc.  After the transitive closure is constructed, as depicted in the following figure, in an O(1) operation one may determine that node ''d'' is reachable from node ''a''.  The data structure is typically stored as a matrix, so if matrix[1][4] = 1, then it is the case that node 1 can reach node 4 through one or more hops.\n\nThe transitive closure of the adjacency relation of a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG) is the reachability relation of the DAG and a [[strict partial order]].\n\n== In logic and computational complexity ==\nThe transitive closure of a binary relation cannot, in general, be expressed in [[first-order logic]] (FO).\nThis means that one cannot write a formula using predicate symbols ''R'' and ''T'' that will be satisfied in\nany model if and only if ''T'' is the transitive closure of ''R''.\nIn [[finite model theory]], first-order logic (FO) extended with a transitive closure operator is usually called '''transitive closure logic''', and abbreviated FO(TC) or just TC. TC is a sub-type of [[fixpoint logic]]s. The fact that FO(TC) is strictly more expressive than FO was discovered by [[Ronald Fagin]] in 1974; the result was then rediscovered by [[Alfred Aho]] and [[Jeffrey Ullman]] in 1979, who proposed to use fixpoint logic as a [[database query language]] (Libkin 2004:vii). With more recent concepts of finite model theory, proof that FO(TC) is strictly more expressive than FO follows immediately from the fact that FO(TC) is not [[Gaifman-local]] (Libkin 2004:49).\n\nIn [[computational complexity theory]], the [[complexity class]] [[NL (complexity)|NL]] corresponds precisely to the set of logical sentences expressible in TC. This is because the transitive closure property has a close relationship with the [[NL-complete]] problem [[STCON]] for finding [[directed path]]s in a graph. Similarly, the class [[L (complexity)|L]] is first-order logic with the commutative, transitive closure. When transitive closure is added to [[second-order logic]] instead, we obtain [[PSPACE]].\n\n== In database query languages ==\n{{further|Hierarchical and recursive queries in SQL}}\nSince the 1980s [[Oracle Database]] has implemented a proprietary [[SQL]] extension CONNECT BY... START WITH that allows the computation of a transitive closure as part of a declarative query. The [[SQL 3]] (1999) standard added a more general WITH RECURSIVE construct also allowing transitive closures to be computed inside the query processor; as of 2011 the latter is implemented in [[IBM DB2]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[Oracle Database|Oracle]], and [[PostgreSQL]], although not in [[MySQL]] (Benedikt and Senellart 2011:189).\n\n[[Datalog]] also implements transitive closure computations (Silberschatz et al. 2010:C.3.6).\n\n== Algorithms ==\nEfficient algorithms for computing the transitive closure of the adjacency relation a graph can be found in Nuutila (1995).  The fastest worst-case methods, which are not practical, reduce the problem to [[matrix multiplication]].  The problem can also be solved by the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], or by repeated [[breadth-first search]] or [[depth-first search]] starting from each node of the graph.\n\nMore recent research has explored efficient ways of computing transitive closure on distributed systems based on the [[MapReduce]] paradigm (Afrati et al. 2011).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ancestral relation]]\n* [[Deductive closure]]\n* [[Reflexive closure]]\n* [[Symmetric closure]]\n* [[Transitive reduction]] (a smallest relation having the transitive closure of ''R'' as its transitive closure)\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|last1=Lidl|first1= R.|last2=Pilz|first2=G.|year=1998|title=''Applied abstract algebra''|edition=2nd|series= [[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|publisher= Springer|isbn=0-387-98290-6}}\n* Keller, U., 2004, ''[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.127.8266 Some Remarks on the Definability of Transitive Closure in First-order Logic and Datalog]'' (unpublished manuscript)\n* {{cite book|author1=Erich Grädel|author2=Phokion G.

If the order is a [[total order]] then it is called a [[well-order]].\n\nIn [[set theory]], a set ''x'' is called a '''well-founded set''' if the [[element (mathematics)|set membership]] relation is well-founded on the [[Transitive closure (set)|transitive closure]] of ''x''. The [[axiom of regularity]], which is one of the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], asserts that all sets are well-founded.\n\nA relation ''R'' is '''converse well-founded''', '''upwards well-founded''' or '''Noetherian''' on ''X'', if the [[converse relation]] ''R''<sup>−1</sup> is well-founded on ''X''. In this case ''R'' is also said to satisfy the [[ascending chain condition]]. In the context of [[rewriting]] systems, a Noetherian relation is also called '''terminating'''.\n\n==Induction and recursion==\nAn important reason that well-founded relations are interesting is because a version of [[transfinite induction]] can be used on them: if (''X'', ''R'') is a well-founded relation, ''P''(''x'') is some property of elements of ''X'', and we want to show that\n\n:''P''(''x'') holds for all elements ''x'' of ''X'',\n\nit suffices to show that:\n\n: If ''x'' is an element of ''X'' and ''P''(''y'') is true for all ''y'' such that ''y R x'', then ''P''(''x'') must also be true.\n\nThat is,\n:<math>(\\forall x \\in X)\\;[(\\forall y \\in X)\\;[yRx \\implies P(y)] \\implies P(x)]\\quad\\text{implies}\\quad(\\forall x \\in X)\\,P(x).</math>\n\nWell-founded induction is sometimes called Noetherian induction,<ref>Bourbaki, N. (1972) ''Elements of mathematics. Commutative algebra'', Addison-Wesley.</ref> after [[Emmy Noether]].\n\nOn par with induction, well-founded relations also support construction of objects by [[transfinite recursion]]. Let (''X'', ''R'') be a [[binary relation#Relations over a set|set-like]] well-founded relation and ''F'' a function that assigns an object ''F''(''x'', ''g'') to each pair of an element ''x ∈ X'' and a function ''g'' on the [[initial segment]] {''y'': ''y'' ''R'' ''x''} of ''X''. Then there is a unique function ''G'' such that for every ''x ∈ X'',\n:<math>G(x) = F\\left(x, G\\vert_{\\left\\{y:\\, yRx\\right\\}}\\right)</math>\n\nThat is, if we want to construct a function ''G'' on ''X'', we may define ''G''(''x'') using the values of ''G''(''y'') for ''y R x''.\n\nAs an example, consider the well-founded relation ('''N''', ''S''), where '''N''' is the set of all [[natural numbers]], and ''S'' is the graph of the successor function ''x'' → ''x'' + 1. Then induction on ''S'' is the usual [[mathematical induction]], and recursion on ''S'' gives [[primitive recursive functions|primitive recursion]]. If we consider the order relation ('''N''', <), we obtain [[complete induction]], and [[course-of-values recursion]]. The statement that ('''N''', <) is well-founded is also known as the [[well-ordering principle]].\n\nThere are other interesting special cases of well-founded induction. When the well-founded relation is the usual ordering on the class of all [[ordinal numbers]], the technique is called [[transfinite induction]]. When the well-founded set is a set of recursively-defined data structures, the technique is called [[structural induction]]. When the well-founded relation is set membership on the universal class, the technique is known as [[∈-induction]]. See those articles for more details.\n\n==Examples==\nWell-founded relations which are not totally ordered include:\n* the positive [[integer]]s {1, 2, 3, ...}, with the order defined by ''a'' < ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''a'' [[divisor|divides]] ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b''.\n* the set of all finite [[string (computer science)|strings]] over a fixed alphabet, with the order defined by ''s'' < ''t'' if and only if ''s'' is a proper substring of ''t''.\n* the set '''N''' × '''N''' of [[Cartesian product|pairs]] of [[natural number]]s, ordered by (''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>) < (''m''<sub>1</sub>, ''m''<sub>2</sub>) if and only if ''n''<sub>1</sub> < ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''n''<sub>2</sub> < ''m''<sub>2</sub>.\n* the set of all [[regular expression]]s over a fixed alphabet, with the order defined by ''s'' < ''t'' if and only if ''s'' is a proper subexpression of ''t''.\n* any class whose elements are sets, with the relation <math>\\in</math> (\"is an element of\"). This is the [[axiom of regularity]].\n* the nodes of any finite [[directed acyclic graph]], with the relation ''R'' defined such that ''a R b'' if and only if there is an edge from ''a'' to ''b''.\nExamples of relations that are not well-founded include:\n* the negative integers {−1, −2, −3, …}, with the usual order, since any unbounded subset has no least element.\n* The set of strings over a finite alphabet with more than one element, under the usual ([[lexicographic ordering|lexicographic]]) order,  since the sequence \"B\" > \"AB\" > \"AAB\" > \"AAAB\" > … is an infinite descending chain.  This relation fails to be well-founded even though the entire set has a minimum element, namely the empty string.\n* the [[rational number]]s (or [[real numbers|reals]]) under the standard ordering, since, for example, the set of positive rationals (or reals) lacks a minimum.\n\n==Other properties==\nIf (''X'', <) is a well-founded relation and ''x'' is an element of ''X'', then the descending chains starting at ''x'' are all finite, but this does not mean that their lengths are necessarily bounded. Consider the following example: \nLet ''X'' be the union of the positive integers and a new element ω, which is bigger than any integer.  Then ''X'' is a well-founded set, but\nthere are descending chains starting at ω of arbitrary great (finite) length; \nthe chain ω, ''n'' − 1, ''n'' − 2, ..., 2, 1 has length ''n'' for any ''n''.\n\nThe [[Mostowski collapse|Mostowski collapse lemma]] implies that set membership is a universal among the extensional well-founded relations: for any set-like well-founded relation ''R'' on a class ''X'' which is extensional, there exists a class ''C'' such that (''X'',''R'') is isomorphic to (''C'',∈).\n\n==Reflexivity==\nA relation ''R'' is said to be [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] if ''a'' R ''a'' holds for every ''a'' in the domain of the relation. Every reflexive relation on a nonempty domain has infinite descending chains, because any constant sequence is a descending chain.  For example, in the natural numbers with their usual order ≤, we have <math>1 \\geq 1 \\geq 1 \\geq \\cdots</math>.  To avoid these trivial descending sequences, when working with a reflexive relation ''R'' it is common to use (perhaps implicitly) the alternate relation ''R′'' defined such that ''a'' ''R′'' ''b'' if and only if ''a'' ''R'' ''b'' and ''a'' ≠ ''b''. In the context of the natural numbers, this means that the relation <, which is well-founded, is used instead of the relation ≤, which is not.  In some texts, the definition of a well-founded relation is changed from the definition above to include this convention.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Just, Winfried and Weese, Martin (1998) ''Discovering Modern Set Theory.

      "text": "{{stack|{{Binary relations}}}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''well-order''' (or '''well-ordering''' or '''well-order [[Binary_relation|relation]]''') on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a [[total order]] on ''S'' with the property that every [[non-empty]] [[subset]] of ''S'' has a [[least element]] in this ordering. The set ''S'' together with the well-order relation is then called a '''well-ordered set'''. In some academic articles and textbooks these terms are instead written as '''wellorder''', '''wellordered''', and '''wellordering''' or '''well order''', '''well ordered''', and '''well ordering'''.\n\nEvery non-empty well-ordered set has a least element. Every element ''s'' of a well-ordered set, except a possible [[greatest element]], has a unique successor (next element), namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than ''s''. There may be elements besides the least element which have no predecessor (see ''[[#Natural numbers|Natural numbers]]'' below for an example). In a well-ordered set ''S'', every subset ''T'' which has an upper bound has a [[Supremum|least upper bound]], namely the least element of the subset of all upper bounds of ''T'' in ''S''.\n\nIf ≤ is a [[non-strict order|non-strict]] well ordering, then < is a strict well ordering. A relation is a strict well ordering if and only if it is a [[well-founded relation|well-founded]] [[strict total order]]. The distinction between strict and non-strict well orders is often ignored since they are easily interconvertible.\n\nEvery well-ordered set is uniquely [[order isomorphic]] to a unique [[ordinal number]], called the [[order type]] of the well-ordered set. The [[well-ordering theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], states that every set can be well ordered. If a set is well ordered (or even if it merely admits a [[well-founded relation]]), the proof technique of [[transfinite induction]] can be used to prove that a given statement is true for all elements of the set.\n\nThe observation that the [[natural numbers]] are well ordered by the usual less-than relation is commonly called the [[well-ordering principle]] (for natural numbers).\n\n== Ordinal numbers ==\n{{main|Ordinal number}}\n\nEvery well-ordered set is uniquely [[order isomorphic]] to a unique [[ordinal number]], called the [[order type]] of the well-ordered set. The position of each element within the ordered set is also given by an ordinal number. In the case of a finite set, the basic operation of [[counting]], to find the ordinal number of a particular object, or to find the object with a particular ordinal number, corresponds to assigning ordinal numbers one by one to the objects. The size (number of elements, [[cardinal number]]) of a finite set is equal to the order type. Counting in the everyday sense typically starts from one, so it assigns to each object the size of the initial segment with that object as last element. Note that these numbers are one more than the formal ordinal numbers according to the isomorphic order, because these are equal to the number of earlier objects (which corresponds to counting from zero). Thus for finite ''n'', the expression \"''n''-th element\" of a well-ordered set requires context to know whether this counts from zero or one. In a notation \"&beta;-th element\" where β can also be an infinite ordinal, it will typically count from zero.\n\nFor an infinite set the order type determines the [[cardinality]], but not conversely: well-ordered sets of a particular cardinality can have many different order types. For a [[countably infinite]] set, the set of possible order types is even uncountable.\n\n== Examples and counterexamples ==\n\n=== Natural numbers ===\nThe standard ordering ≤ of the [[natural number]]s is a well ordering and has the additional property that every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor.\n\nAnother well ordering of the natural numbers is given by defining that all even numbers are less than all odd numbers, and the usual ordering applies within the evens and the odds:\n\n:0 2 4 6 8 ... 1 3 5 7 9 ...\n\nThis is a well-ordered set of order type ω&nbsp;+&nbsp;ω. Every element has a successor (there is no largest element).  Two elements lack a predecessor: 0 and 1.\n\n=== Integers ===\nUnlike the standard ordering ≤ of the [[natural number]]s, the standard ordering ≤ of the [[integer]]s is not a well ordering, since, for example, the set of [[negative number|negative]] integers does not contain a least element.\n\nThe following relation ''R'' is an example of well ordering of the integers: ''[[Binary relation|x R y]]'' [[if and only if]] one of the following conditions holds:\n# ''x'' = 0\n# ''x'' is positive, and ''y'' is negative\n# ''x'' and ''y'' are both positive, and ''x'' ≤ ''y''\n# ''x'' and ''y'' are both negative, and |''x''| ≤ |''y''|\nThis relation ''R'' can be visualized as follows: \n:0  1  2  3  4  ...  −1  −2  −3  ...\n''R'' is isomorphic to the [[ordinal number]] ω + ω.\n\nAnother relation for well ordering the integers is the following definition: ''x''&nbsp;≤<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;''y'' [[iff]] (|''x''|&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;|''y''| or (|''x''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;|''y''| and ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''y'')). This well order can be visualized as follows: \n: 0  −1  1  −2  2  −3  3  −4  4  ...\n\nThis has the [[order type]] ω.\n\n=== Reals ===\nThe standard ordering ≤ of any [[Interval_(mathematics)|real interval]] is not a well ordering, since, for example, the [[open interval]] (0, 1) ⊆ [0,1] does not contain a least element.   From the [[ZFC]] axioms of set theory (including the [[axiom of choice]]) one can show that there is a well order of the reals. Also [[Wacław Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH (the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]]) imply the axiom of choice and hence a well order of the reals. Nonetheless, it is possible to show that the ZFC+GCH axioms alone are not sufficient to prove the existence of a definable (by a formula) well order of the reals.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Solomon Feferman |first=S. |last=Feferman |title=Some Applications of the Notions of Forcing and Generic Sets |journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae |volume=56 |issue=3 |year=1964 |pages=325-345 |url=https://eudml.org/doc/213821}}</ref> However it is consistent with ZFC that a definable well ordering of the reals exists—for example, it is consistent with ZFC that [[V=L]], and it follows from ZFC+V=L that a particular formula well orders the reals, or indeed any set.\n\nAn uncountable subset of the real numbers with the standard ordering ≤ cannot be a well order: Suppose ''X'' is a subset of '''R''' well ordered by ≤. For each ''x'' in ''X'', let ''s''(''x'') be the successor of ''x'' in ≤ ordering on ''X'' (unless ''x'' is the last element of ''X''). Let ''A'' = { (''x'', ''s''(''x'')) | ''x'' ∈ ''X'' } whose elements are nonempty and disjoint intervals. Each such interval contains at least one rational number, so there is an [[injective function]] from ''A'' to '''Q'''. There is an injection from ''X'' to ''A'' (except possibly for a last element of ''X'' which could be mapped to zero later). And it is well known that there is an injection from ''Q'' to the natural numbers (which could be chosen to avoid hitting zero). Thus there is an injection from ''X'' to the natural numbers which means that ''X'' is countable. On the other hand, a countably infinite subset of the reals may or may not be a well order with the standard \"≤\". For example,\n\n* The natural numbers are a well order under the standard ordering ≤.\n* The set {1/n : n =1,2,3,...} has no least element and is therefore not a well order under standard ordering ≤.\n\nExamples of well orders:\n*The set of numbers { − 2<sup>−''n''</sup> | 0 ≤ ''n'' < ω } has order type ω.\n*The set of numbers { − 2<sup>−''n''</sup> − 2<sup>−''m''−''n''</sup> | 0 ≤ ''m'',''n'' < ω } has order type ω². The previous set is the set of [[limit point]]s within the set. Within the set of real numbers, either with the ordinary topology or the order topology, 0 is also a limit point of the set. It is also a limit point of the set of limit points.\n*The set of numbers { − 2<sup>−''n''</sup> | 0 ≤ ''n'' < ω } ∪ { 1 } has order type ω + 1. With the [[order topology]] of this set, 1 is a limit point of the set. With the ordinary topology (or equivalently, the order topology) of the real numbers it is not.\n\n== Equivalent formulations ==\nIf a set is [[Total order|totally ordered]], then the following are equivalent to each other:\n\n# The set is well ordered. That is, every nonempty subset has a least element.\n# [[Transfinite induction]] works for the entire ordered set.\n# Every strictly decreasing sequence of elements of the set must terminate after only finitely many steps (assuming the [[axiom of dependent choice]]).\n# Every subordering is isomorphic to an initial segment.\n\n== Order topology==\nEvery well-ordered set can be made into a [[topological space]] by endowing it with the  [[order topology]].\n\nWith respect to this topology there can be two kinds of elements:\n*[[isolated point]]s — these are the minimum and the elements with a predecessor.\n*[[limit point]]s — this type does not occur in finite sets, and may or may not occur in an infinite set; the infinite sets without limit point are the sets of order type ω, for example '''N'''.\n\nFor subsets we can distinguish:\n*Subsets with a maximum (that is, subsets which are [[Bounded set#Boundedness in order theory|bounded]] by themselves); this can be an isolated point or a limit point of the whole set; in the latter case it may or may not be also a limit point of the subset.\n*Subsets which are unbounded by themselves but bounded in the whole set; they have no maximum, but a supremum outside the subset; if the subset is non-empty this supremum is a limit point of the subset and hence also of the whole set; if the subset is empty this supremum is the minimum of the whole set.\n*Subsets which are unbounded in the whole set.\n\nA subset is [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in the whole set if and only if it is unbounded in the whole set or it has a maximum which is also maximum of the whole set.\n\nA well-ordered set as topological space is a [[first-countable space]] if and only if it has order type less than or equal to ω<sub>1</sub> ([[first uncountable ordinal|omega-one]]), that is, if and only if the set is [[countable]] or has the smallest [[uncountable]] order type.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Tree (set theory)]], generalization\n*[[Ordinal number]]\n*[[Well-founded set]]\n*[[Well partial order]]\n*[[Prewellordering]]\n*[[Directed set]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | last = Folland | first = Gerald B. | authorlink = Gerald Folland\n  | title = Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and Their Applications | edition = 2nd\n  | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] | series = Pure and applied mathematics | year = 1999\n  | isbn = 978-0-471-31716-6\n  | pages = 4–6,&nbsp;9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wI4fAwAAQBAJpg=PT18 <!-- Link from new edition -->}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Binary relations]]\n[[Category:Order theory]]\n[[Category:Wellfoundedness]]\n[[Category:Ordinal numbers]]"

However the class of well-founded quasiorders is not closed under certain operations—that is, when a quasi-order is used to obtain a new quasi-order on a set of structures derived from our original set, this quasiorder is found to be not well-founded. By placing stronger restrictions on the original well-founded quasiordering one can hope to ensure that our derived quasiorderings are still well-founded.\n\nAn example of this is the [[power set]] operation. Given a quasiordering <math>\\le</math> for a set <math>X</math> one can define a quasiorder <math>\\le^{+}</math> on <math>X</math>'s power set <math>P(X)</math> by setting <math>A \\le^{+} B</math> if and only if for each element of <math>A</math> one can find some element of <math>B</math> that is larger than it under <math>\\le</math>. One can show that this quasiordering on <math>P(X)</math> needn't be well-founded, but if one takes the original quasi-ordering to be a well-quasi-ordering, then it is.\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\nA '''well-quasi-ordering''' on a set <math>X</math> is a [[quasi-ordering]] (i.e., a [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], [[transitive relation|transitive]] [[binary relation]]) such that any [[Infinity|infinite]] sequence of elements <math>x_0</math>, <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, … from <math>X</math> contains an increasing pair <math>x_i</math>≤<math>x_j</math> with <math>i</math>&lt;<math>j</math>. The set <math>X</math> is said to be '''well-quasi-ordered''', or shortly '''wqo'''.\n\nA '''well partial order''', or a '''wpo''', is a wqo that is a proper ordering relation, i.e., it is [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]].\n\nAmong other ways of defining wqo's, one is to say that they are quasi-orderings which do not contain infinite ''strictly decreasing'' sequences (of the form\n<math>x_0</math>&gt;<math>x_1</math>&gt;<math>x_2</math>&gt;…){{ref|a}}\nnor infinite sequences of ''pairwise incomparable'' elements. Hence a quasi-order (''X'',≤) is wqo if and only if (''X'',<) is [[well-founded relation|well-founded]] and has no infinite [[antichain]]s.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Integers-line.svg|thumb|200px|'''Pic.1:''' Integer numbers with the usual order]]\n[[File:Infinite lattice of divisors.svg|thumb|200px|'''Pic.2:''' [[Hasse diagram]] of the natural numbers ordered by divisibility]]\n[[File:N-Quadrat, gedreht.svg|thumb|200px|'''Pic.3:''' Hasse diagram of <math>\\mathbb{N}^2</math> with componentwise order]]\n* <math>(\\mathbb{N}, \\le)</math>, the set of natural numbers with standard ordering, is a well partial order (in fact, a [[well-order]]).

Similarly, <math>X^*</math> ordered by the [[prefix (computer science)#Prefix|prefix]] relation is '''not''' a well-quasi-order, because the previous sequence is an infinite antichain of this partial order.

So <math>I</math> is finite, and any <math>x_n</math> with <math>n</math> larger than any index in <math>I</math> can be used as the starting point of an infinite increasing subsequence.\n\nThe existence of such infinite increasing subsequences is sometimes taken as a definition for well-quasi-ordering, leading to an equivalent notion.\n\n== Properties of wqos ==\n\n* Given a quasiordering <math>(X,\\le)</math> the quasiordering <math>(P(X), \\le^+)</math> defined by  <math> A \\le^+ B \\iff \\forall a \\in A, \\exists b \\in B, a \\le b</math> is well-founded if and only if <math>(X,\\le)</math> is a wqo.<ref name=\"forster\"/>\n* A quasiordering is a wqo if and only if the corresponding partial order (obtained by quotienting by <math> x \\sim y \\iff x\\le y \\land y \\le x</math>) has no infinite descending sequences or [[antichain]]s.

There are a number of different contexts in which these inequalities appear.\n\n==Entropic inequalities==\n{{main|Entropic vector}}\nConsider a tuple <math>X_1,X_2,\\dots,X_n</math> of <math>n</math> [[Discrete probability distribution|finitely (or at most countably) supported]] [[random variable]]s on the same [[probability space]].  There are 2<sup>''n''</sup> subsets, for which ([[joint entropy|joint]]) entropies can be computed.  For example, when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, we may consider the entropies <math>H(X_1),</math> <math>H(X_2),</math> and <math>H(X_1, X_2),</math>. They satisfy the following inequalities (which together characterize the range of the marginal and joint entropies of two random variables):\n* <math>H(X_1) \\ge 0</math>\n* <math>H(X_2) \\ge 0</math>\n* <math>H(X_1) \\le H(X_1, X_2)</math>\n* <math>H(X_2) \\le H(X_1, X_2)</math>\n* <math>H(X_1, X_2) \\le H(X_1) + H(X_2).</math>\nIn fact, these can all be expressed as special cases of a single inequality involving the '''[[conditional mutual information]]''', namely\n:<math>I(A;B|C) \\ge 0,</math>\n\nwhere <math>A</math>, <math>B</math>, and <math>C</math> each denote the joint distribution of some arbitrary (possibly empty) subset of our collection of random variables.  Inequalities that can be derived as linear combinations of this are known as '''Shannon-type''' inequalities.\n\nFor larger <math>n</math> there are further restrictions on possible values of entropy.\nTo make this precise, a vector <math>h</math> in <math>\\mathbb{R}^{2^n}</math> indexed by subsets of <math>\\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math> is said to be ''[[entropic vector|entropic]]'' if there is a joint, discrete distribution of ''n'' random variables <math>X_1,\\dots,X_n</math> such that <math>h_I = H(X_i \\colon i \\in I)</math> is their [[joint entropy]], for each subset <math>I</math>.\nThe set of entropic vectors is denoted <math>\\Gamma^*_n</math>, following the notation of Yeung <ref>{{cite journal|last=Yeung|first=R.W.|year=1997|title=A framework for linear information inequalities|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=43|issue=6|pages=1924–1934|doi=10.1109/18.641556}})</ref>.\nIt is not closed nor convex for <math>n \\geq 3</math>, but it's [[topological closure]] <math>\\overline{\\Gamma^*_n}</math> is known to be convex and hence it can be characterized by the (infinitely many) linear inequalities satisfied by all entropic vectors, called '''[[Entropic vector|entropic inequalities]]'''.\n\nThe set of all vectors that satisfy Shannon-type inequalities (but not necessarily other entropic inequalities) contains <math>\\overline{\\Gamma^*_n}</math>.\nThis containment is strict for <math>n \\geq 4</math> and further inequalities are known as ''non-Shannon type'' inequalities.\nZhang and Yeung reported the first non-Shannon-type inequality.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal |first=Z. |last=Zhang |first2=R.

Even the Shannon-type inequalities can be considered part of this category, since the [[multivariate mutual information|bivariate mutual information]] can be expressed as the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the joint distribution with respect to the product of the marginals, and thus these inequalities can be seen as a special case of [[Gibbs' inequality]].\n\nOn the other hand, it seems to be much more difficult to derive useful upper bounds for the Kullback–Leibler divergence.  This is because the Kullback–Leibler divergence ''D''<sub>''KL''</sub>(''P''||''Q'') depends very sensitively on events that are very rare in the reference distribution ''Q''.  ''D''<sub>''KL''</sub>(''P''||''Q'') increases without bound as an event of finite non-zero probability in the distribution ''P'' becomes exceedingly rare in the reference distribution ''Q'', and in fact ''D''<sub>''KL''</sub>(''P''||''Q'') is not even defined if an event of non-zero probability in ''P'' has zero probability in ''Q''.  (Hence the requirement that ''P'' be absolutely continuous with respect to ''Q''.)\n\n===Gibbs' inequality===\n{{main|Gibbs' inequality}}\nThis fundamental inequality states that the [[Kullback–Leibler divergence]] is non-negative.\n\n===Kullback's inequality===\n{{main|Kullback's inequality}}\nAnother inequality concerning the Kullback–Leibler divergence is known as '''Kullback's inequality'''.<ref>{{cite book |first=Aimé |last=Fuchs |first2=Giorgio |last2=Letta |title=L'inégalité de Kullback.

These relations are known as '''strict inequalities'''. The notation ''a'' < ''b'' may also be read as \"''a'' is strictly less than ''b''\".\n\nIn contrast to strict inequalities, there are two types of inequality relations that are not strict:\n* The notation ''a'' ≤ ''b'' or ''a'' ⩽ ''b'' means that ''a'' is '''less than or equal to''' ''b'' (or, equivalently, '''not greater than''' ''b'', or '''at most''' ''b''); \"not greater than\" can also be represented by ''a'' ≯ ''b'', the symbol for \"greater than\" bisected by a vertical line, \"not\". (The [[Unicode]] characters are: {{unichar|2264|Less-Than or Equal To}}, {{unichar|2A7D|Less-Than or Slanted Equal To}}, and {{unichar|226F|Not Greater-Than}}.)\n* The notation ''a'' ≥ ''b'' or ''a'' ⩾ ''b'' means that ''a'' is '''greater than or equal to''' ''b'' (or, equivalently, '''not less than''' ''b'', or '''at least''' ''b''); \"not less than\" can also be represented by ''a'' ≮ ''b'', the symbol for \"less than\" bisected by a vertical line, \"not\". (The Unicode characters are: {{unichar|2265|Greater-Than or Equal To}}, {{unichar|2A7E|Greater-Than or Slanted Equal To}}, and {{unichar|226E|Not Less-Than}}.)\n\nIn engineering sciences, a less formal use of the notation is to state that one quantity is \"much greater\" than another, normally by several [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]].  This implies that the lesser value can be neglected with little effect on the accuracy of an [[approximation]].  (For example, the [[ultrarelativistic limit]] in physics.)\n\n* The notation ''a'' ≪ ''b'' means that ''a'' is '''much less than''' ''b''. (In [[measure theory]], however, this notation is used for [[Absolute continuity#Absolute continuity of measures|absolute continuity]], an unrelated concept.)\n* The notation ''a'' ≫ ''b'' means that ''a'' is '''much greater than''' ''b''.\n\n==Properties==\nInequalities are governed by the following [[Property (philosophy)|properties]].

Applying a monotonically decreasing function to both sides of an inequality means the opposite inequality now holds.  The rules for the additive inverse, and the multiplicative inverse for positive numbers, are both examples of applying a monotonically decreasing function.\n\nIf the inequality is strict (''a'' < ''b'', ''a'' > ''b'') ''and'' the function is strictly monotonic, then the inequality remains strict.  If only one of these conditions is strict, then the resultant inequality is non-strict.  The rules for additive and multiplicative inverses are both examples of applying a ''strictly'' monotonically decreasing function.\n\nA few examples of this rule are: \n* Exponentiating both sides of an inequality by ''n'' > 0 when ''a'' and ''b'' are positive real numbers:\n:''a'' ≤ ''b'' ⇔ ''a<sup>n</sup>'' ≤ ''b<sup>n</sup>''.\n:''a'' ≤ ''b'' ⇔ ''a''<sup>−''n''</sup> ≥ ''b''<sup>−''n''</sup>.\n* Taking the [[natural logarithm]] to both sides of an inequality when ''a'' and ''b'' are positive real numbers:\n:''a'' ≤ ''b'' ⇔ ln(''a'') ≤ ln(''b'').\n:''a'' < ''b'' ⇔ ln(''a'') < ln(''b'').\n:This is true because the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function.\n\n==Ordered fields==\nIf (''F'', +, ×) is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] and ≤ is a [[total order]] on ''F'', then (''F'', +, ×, ≤) is called an [[ordered field]] if and only if:\n* ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'';\n* 0 ≤ ''a'' and 0 ≤ ''b'' implies 0 ≤ ''a'' × ''b''.\n\nNote that both ('''Q''', +, ×, ≤) and ('''R''', +, ×, ≤) are [[ordered field]]s, but ≤ cannot be defined in order to make ('''C''', +, ×, ≤) an [[ordered field]], because −1 is the square of ''i'' and would therefore be positive.\n\nThe non-strict inequalities ≤ and ≥ on real numbers are [[total order]]s. That is, given arbitrary ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''R''', at least one of ''a'' ≤ ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' holds; at the same time, at least one of ''a'' ≥ ''b'' and ''b'' ≥ ''a'' holds. The strict inequalities < and > on real numbers are [[Total order#Strict total order|strict total orders]]. That is, < on '''R''' has [[trichotomy property]]: given arbitrary ''a'', ''b'' ∈ '''R''', exactly one of ''a'' < ''b'', ''b'' < ''a'' and ''a'' = ''b'' is true; likewise, > on '''R''' has the [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy property]].\n\n== Chained notation ==\n\nThe notation '''''a'' < ''b'' < ''c''''' stands for \"''a'' < ''b'' and ''b'' < ''c''\", from which, by the transitivity property above, it also follows that ''a'' < ''c''. By the above laws, one can add or subtract the same number to all three terms, or multiply or divide all three terms by same nonzero number and reverse all inequalities if that number is negative. Hence, for example, ''a'' < ''b'' + ''e'' < ''c'' is equivalent to ''a'' − ''e'' < ''b'' < ''c'' − ''e''.\n\nThis notation can be generalized to any number of terms: for instance, '''''a''<sub>1</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>2</sub> ≤ ... ≤ ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''' means that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>''i''+1</sub> for ''i'' = 1, 2, ..., ''n'' − 1.  By transitivity, this condition is equivalent to ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> ≤ ''a''<sub>''j''</sub> for any 1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''j'' ≤ ''n''.\n\nWhen solving inequalities using chained notation, it is possible and sometimes necessary to evaluate the terms independently. For instance, to solve the inequality 4''x'' < 2''x'' + 1 ≤ 3''x'' + 2, it is not possible to isolate ''x'' in any one part of the inequality through addition or subtraction. Instead, the inequalities must be solved independently, yielding ''x'' < 1/2 and ''x'' ≥ −1 respectively, which can be combined into the final solution −1 ≤ ''x'' < 1/2.\n\nOccasionally, chained notation is used with inequalities in different directions, in which case the meaning is the [[logical conjunction]] of the inequalities between adjacent terms.  For instance, ''a'' < ''b'' = ''c'' ≤ ''d'' means that ''a'' < ''b'', ''b'' = ''c'', and ''c'' ≤ ''d''.  This notation exists in a few [[programming language]]s such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]].\n<!--\n== Representing inequalities on the real number line ==\nEvery inequality involving real numbers can be represented on the real [[number line]] showing darkened regions on the line. A \"<\" or \">\" is graphed by an open circle on the number. A \"≤\" or \"≥\" is graphed with a closed or black circle.\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}} -->\n\n==Sharp inequalities==\n\nAn inequality is said to be ''sharp'', if it cannot be ''relaxed'' and still be valid in general. Formally, a [[universally quantified]] inequality ''φ'' is called sharp if, for every valid universally quantified inequality ''ψ'', if {{nowrap|''ψ'' [[material conditional|⇒]] ''φ''}} holds, then {{nowrap|''ψ'' [[equivalence (logic)|⇔]] ''φ''}} also holds. For instance, the inequality {{nowrap|[[universal quantification|∀]]''a'' ∈ [[real number|ℝ]]. ''a''<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0}} is sharp, whereas the inequality {{nowrap|∀''a'' ∈ ℝ. ''a''<sup>2</sup> ≥ −1}} is not sharp.{{cn|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Inequalities between means==\n{{see also|Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means}}\n\nThere are many inequalities between means. For example, for any positive numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, …, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> we have {{nowrap|''H'' ≤ ''G'' ≤ ''A'' ≤ ''Q'',}} where\n\n:{| style=\"height:200px\"\n|-\n|<math>H = \\frac{n}{1/a_1 + 1/a_2 + \\cdots + 1/a_n}</math>   || ([[harmonic mean]]),\n|-\n|<math>G = \\sqrt[n]{a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdots a_n} </math>             || ([[geometric mean]]),\n|-\n|<math>A = \\frac{a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_n}{n}</math>              || ([[arithmetic mean]]),\n|-\n|<math>Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \\cdots + a_n^2}{n}}</math> || ([[Root mean square|quadratic mean]]).\n|}\n\n==Power inequalities==\nA \"'''power inequality'''\" is an inequality containing terms of the form ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>, where ''a'' and ''b'' are real positive numbers or variable expressions.

To make <math>(\\mathbb{C}, +, \\times, \\le)</math> an [[ordered field]], it would have to satisfy the following two properties:\n* if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c'';\n* if 0 ≤ ''a'' and 0 ≤ ''b'', then 0 ≤ ''a b''.\n\nBecause ≤ is a [[total order]], for any number ''a'', either 0 ≤ ''a'' or ''a'' ≤ 0 (in which case the first property above implies that 0 ≤ −''a''). In either case 0 ≤ ''a''<sup>2</sup>; this means that <math>i^2 > 0</math> and <math>1^2 > 0</math>; so <math>-1 > 0</math> and <math>1 > 0</math>, which means <math>(-1 + 1) > 0</math>; contradiction.\n\nHowever, an operation ≤ can be defined so as to satisfy only the first property (namely, \"if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''\"). Sometimes the [[lexicographical order]] definition is used:\n* <math>a \\le b</math>, if <math> \\mathrm{Re}(a) < \\mathrm{Re}(b)</math> or <math>\\left(\\mathrm{Re}(a) = \\mathrm{Re}(b)\\right.</math> and <math>\\left.\\mathrm{Im}(a) \\le \\mathrm{Im}(b)\\right).</math>\nIt can easily be proven that for this definition ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''a'' + ''c'' ≤ ''b'' + ''c''.\n\n==Vector inequalities==\nInequality relationships similar to those defined above can also be defined for [[column vector]]s.  If we let the vectors <math>x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n</math> (meaning that <math>x = (x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)^\\mathsf{T}</math> and <math>y = (y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_n)^\\mathsf{T}</math>, where <math>x_i</math> and <math>y_i</math> are real numbers for <math>i = 1, \\ldots, n</math>), we can define the following relationships:\n* <math>x = y </math>, if <math>x_i = y_i</math> for <math>i = 1, \\ldots, n</math>.\n* <math>x < y </math>, if <math>x_i < y_i</math> for <math>i = 1, \\ldots, n</math>.\n* <math>x \\leq y </math>, if <math>x_i \\leq y_i </math> for <math>i = 1, \\ldots, n</math> and <math>x \\neq y</math>.\n* <math>x \\leqq y </math>, if <math>x_i \\leq y_i </math> for <math>i = 1, \\ldots, n</math>.\n\nSimilarly, we can define relationships for <math>x > y</math>, <math>x \\geq y</math>, and <math>x \\geqq y</math>.  We note that this notation is consistent with that used by Matthias Ehrgott in ''Multicriteria Optimization'' (see References).\n\nThe [[trichotomy property]] (as stated [[#Ordered fields|above]]) is not valid for vector relationships.  For example, when <math>x = (2, 5)^\\mathsf{T}</math> and <math>y = (3, 4)^\\mathsf{T}</math>, there exists no valid inequality relationship between these two vectors.  Also, a [[multiplicative inverse]] would need to be defined on a vector before this property could be considered.   However, for the rest of the aforementioned properties, a parallel property for vector inequalities exists.\n\n== General existence theorems ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\nFor a general system of polynomial inequalities, one can find a condition for a solution to exist. Firstly, any system of polynomial inequalities can be reduced to a system of quadratic inequalities by increasing the number of variables and equations (for example, by setting a square of a variable equal to a new variable). A single quadratic polynomial inequality in ''n'' − 1 variables can be written as\n\n: <math>X^T A X \\geq 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''X'' is a vector of the variables <math>X = (x, y, z, \\ldots, 1)^\\mathsf{T}</math>, and ''A'' is a matrix. This has a solution, for example, when there is at least one positive element on the main diagonal of ''A''.\n\nSystems of inequalities can be written in terms of matrices ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', etc., and the conditions for existence of solutions can be written as complicated expressions in terms of these matrices. The solution for two polynomial inequalities in two variables tells us whether two [[conic section]] regions overlap or are inside each other. The general solution is not known, but such a solution could be theoretically used to solve such unsolved problems as the [[kissing number problem]]. However, the conditions would be so complicated as to require a great deal of computing time or clever algorithms.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Binary relation]]\n*[[Bracket (mathematics)]], for the use of similar ‹ and › signs as [[bracket]]s\n*[[Fourier–Motzkin elimination]]\n*[[Inclusion (set theory)]]\n*[[Inequation]]\n*[[Interval (mathematics)]]\n*[[List of inequalities]]\n*[[List of triangle inequalities]]\n*[[Partially ordered set]]\n*[[Relational operator]]s, used in programming languages to denote inequality\n<!--\n==Notes==  \n{{Reflist}}-->\n\n==References==  \n* {{cite book | author=Hardy, G., Littlewood J. E., Pólya, G.| title=Inequalities| publisher=Cambridge Mathematical Library, Cambridge University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-521-05206-8}}\n* {{cite book | author=Beckenbach, E. F., Bellman, R.| title=An Introduction to Inequalities| publisher=Random House Inc | year=1975 | isbn=0-394-01559-2}}\n* {{cite book | author=Drachman, Byron C., Cloud, Michael J.| title=Inequalities: With Applications to Engineering| publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1998 | isbn=0-387-98404-6}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Grinshpan | first1=A.

In a well-known 1935 paper, [[Boris Podolsky]] and co-authors Einstein and [[Nathan Rosen]] (collectively \"EPR\") sought to demonstrate by the [[EPR paradox]] that quantum mechanics was incomplete.  This provided hope that a more complete (and less troubling) theory might one day be discovered.  But that conclusion rested on the seemingly reasonable assumptions of ''locality'' and ''realism'' (together called \"local realism\" or \"[[local hidden variables]]\", often interchangeably). In the vernacular of Einstein: [[Principle of locality|locality]] meant no instantaneous [[quantum entanglement|(\"spooky\") action at a distance]]; realism meant the moon is there even when not being observed. These assumptions were hotly debated in the physics community, notably [[Bohr–Einstein debates|between Einstein and Niels Bohr]].\n\nIn his groundbreaking 1964 paper, \"On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen paradox\",<ref name=Bell1964/><ref>Reprinted in {{cite book |title=Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics: Collected Papers on Quantum Philosophy  |author=JS Bell |chapter=Chapter 2:On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mwAhAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT8 |isbn=978-0521523387  |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition=Alain Aspect introduction to 1987 |pages=14–21}}</ref> physicist [[John Stewart Bell]] presented an analogy (based on spin measurements on pairs of entangled electrons) to EPR's hypothetical paradox.  Using their reasoning, he said, a choice of measurement setting here should not affect the outcome of a measurement there (and vice versa).  After providing a mathematical formulation of locality and realism based on this, he showed specific cases where this would be inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics theory.\n\nIn experimental tests following Bell's example, now using [[quantum entanglement]] of photons instead of electrons, [[John Clauser]] and [[Stuart Freedman]] (1972) and [[Alain Aspect]] ''et al''. (1981) demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct in this regard, although relying on additional unverifiable assumptions that open [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|loopholes]] for local realism.\n\nIn October 2015, Hensen and co-workers<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |doi = 10.1038/nature15759 | volume=526 | issue=7575 | title=Loophole-free Bell inequality violation using electron spins separated by 1.3 kilometres | journal=Nature | pages=682–686|bibcode = 2015Natur.526..682H |arxiv=1508.05949 | pmid=26503041 | last1 = Hensen | first1 = B | last2 = Bernien | first2 = H | last3 = Dréau | first3 = AE | last4 = Reiserer | first4 = A | last5 = Kalb | first5 = N | last6 = Blok | first6 = MS | last7 = Ruitenberg | first7 = J | last8 = Vermeulen | first8 = RF | last9 = Schouten | first9 = RN | last10 = Abellán | first10 = C | last11 = Amaya | first11 = W | last12 = Pruneri | first12 = V | last13 = Mitchell | first13 = MW | last14 = Markham | first14 = M | last15 = Twitchen | first15 = DJ | last16 = Elkouss | first16 = D | last17 = Wehner | first17 = S | last18 = Taminiau | first18 = TH | last19 = Hanson | first19 = R| year=2015 }}</ref> reported that they performed a loophole-free Bell test which might force one to reject at least one of the principles of locality, realism, or [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments#Free choice of detector orientations|freedom-of-choice]] (the last \"could\" lead to alternative [[Superdeterminism|superdeterministic]] theories).<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Zeeya Merali |title=Quantum 'spookiness' passes toughest test yet |journal=Nature |volume= 525 |issue=7567 |pages=14–15 |date=2015-08-27|doi=10.1038/nature.2015.18255 |pmid=26333448 }}</ref> Two of these logical possibilities, non-locality and non-realism, correspond to well-developed interpretations of quantum mechanics, and have many supporters; this is not the case for the third logical possibility, non-freedom. Conclusive experimental evidence of the violation of Bell's inequality would drastically reduce the class of acceptable deterministic theories but would not falsify absolute determinism, which was described by Bell himself as \"not just inanimate nature running on behind-the-scenes clockwork, but with our behaviour, including our belief that we are free to choose to do one experiment rather than another, absolutely predetermined\". However, Bell himself considered absolute determinism an implausible solution.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{Specific|section|date=June 2019}}\nBell's theorem states that any physical theory that incorporates [[Principle of locality#Local realism|local realism]] cannot reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanical theory.  Because numerous experiments agree with the predictions of quantum mechanical theory, and show differences between correlations that could not be explained by local hidden variables, the experimental results have been taken by many as refuting the concept of local realism as an explanation of the physical phenomena under test. For a hidden variable theory, if Bell's conditions are correct, the results that agree with quantum mechanical theory appear to indicate [[superluminal]] (faster-than-light) effects, in contradiction to the principle of locality.\n\nThese three key concepts – locality, realism, freedom&nbsp;– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, the concept of ''realism'' is now somewhat different from what it was in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called ''[[counterfactual definiteness]]''; it means that we may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. ''Locality'' is short for ''local relativistic causality''. (Currently accepted [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] ''are'' local in the terminology of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian formalism]] and [[Local quantum field theory|axiomatic approach]].) ''Freedom'' refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.\n\nThe theorem is usually proved by consideration of a quantum system of two [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] [[qubit]]s. The most common examples concern systems of particles that are entangled in [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[polarization (waves)|polarization]]. Quantum mechanics allows predictions of correlations that would be observed if these two particles have their spin or polarization measured in different directions. Bell showed that if a local hidden variable theory holds, then these correlations would have to satisfy certain constraints, called Bell inequalities. However, for the quantum correlations arising in the specific example considered, those constraints are not satisfied, hence the phenomenon being studied cannot be explained by a local hidden variables theory.\n\nFollowing the argument in the [[EPR paradox|Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen (EPR) paradox]] paper (but using the example of spin, as in [[David Bohm]]'s version of the EPR argument<ref name=\"Bell1964\">{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=John |year=1964 |title=On the Einstein Podolsky Rosen Paradox |url=http://www.drchinese.com/David/Bell_Compact.pdf |journal=[[Physics (American Physical Society journal)|Physics]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=195–200|doi=10.1103/PhysicsPhysiqueFizika.1.195 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Bohm|first=David|title=Quantum Theory|authorlink=David Bohm|publisher=Prentice−Hall|year=1951}}</ref>), Bell considered an experiment in which there are \"a pair of spin one-half particles formed somehow in the [[Singlet state|singlet spin state]] and moving freely in opposite directions.\"<ref name=Bell1964/> The two particles travel away from each other to two distant locations, at which measurements of spin are performed, along axes that are independently chosen. Each measurement yields a result of either spin-up&nbsp;(+) or spin-down&nbsp;(−); it means, spin in the positive or negative direction of the chosen axis.\n\nThe probability of the same result being obtained at the two locations depends on the relative angles at which the two spin measurements are made, and is strictly between zero and one for all relative angles other than perfectly parallel or antiparallel alignments (0° or 180°). Since total angular momentum is conserved, and since the total spin is zero in the singlet state, the probability of the same result with parallel (antiparallel) alignment is 0 (1). This last prediction is true classically as well as quantum mechanically.\n\nBell's theorem is concerned with correlations defined in terms of averages taken over very many trials of the experiment. The [[Quantum correlation|correlation]] of two binary variables is usually defined in quantum physics as the average of the products of the pairs of measurements. Note that this is different from the usual definition of [[correlation]] in statistics. The quantum physicist's \"correlation\" is the statistician's \"raw (uncentered, unnormalized) product [[Moment (mathematics)|moment]]\". They are similar in that, with either definition, if the pairs of outcomes are always the same, the correlation is +1; if the pairs of outcomes are always opposite, the correlation is −1; and if the pairs of outcomes agree 50% of the time, then the correlation is 0. The correlation is related in a simple way to the probability of equal outcomes, namely it is equal to twice the probability of equal outcomes, minus one.\n\n[[Pauli operator|Measuring the spin]] of these entangled particles along anti-parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely opposite directions, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) the set of all results is perfectly correlated. On the other hand, if measurements are performed along parallel directions (i.e., facing in precisely the same direction, perhaps offset by some arbitrary distance) they always yield opposite results, and the set of measurements shows perfect anti-correlation. This is in accord with the above stated probabilities of measuring the same result in these two cases. Finally, measurement at perpendicular directions has a 50% chance of matching, and the total set of measurements is uncorrelated. These basic cases are illustrated in the table below. Columns should be read as ''examples'' of pairs of values that could be recorded by Alice and Bob with time increasing going to the right.\n\n{| style=\"float:center; text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"text-align:left;\" | Anti-parallel\n! colspan=6 | Pair\n! rowspan=2 |\n|-\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! … !! {{math|''n''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], 0°\n| +    || −  || +  || +  || … || −              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Bob]], 180°\n| +    || −  || +  || +  || … || −              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( +1 || +1 || +1 || +1 || … || +1 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = +1\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(100% identical)</small>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Parallel\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! … !! {{math|''n''}}\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Alice]], 0°\n| +    || −  || −  || +  || … || +              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | [[Alice and Bob|Bob]], 0° or 360°\n| −    || +  || +  || −  || … || −              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( −1 || −1 || −1 || −1 || … || −1 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = −1\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(100% opposite)</small>\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | Orthogonal\n! 1    !! 2  !! 3  !! 4  !! … !! {{math|''n''}}\n!\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Alice, 0°\n| +    || −  || +  || −  || … || −              ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | Bob, 90° or 270°\n| −    || −  || +  || +  || … || −              ||\n|- style=\"text-align:left;\"\n| Correlation\n| ( −1 || +1 || +1 || −1 || … || +1 )           || / {{math|''n''}} = 0\n|-\n| colspan=7 |\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" | <small>(50% identical, 50% opposite)</small>\n|}\n\n[[Image:Bell.svg|400px|thumb|The best possible local realist imitation (red) for the quantum correlation of two spins in the singlet state (blue), insisting on perfect anti-correlation at 0°, perfect correlation at 180°.

In his paper, Bell started from the same two assumptions as did EPR, namely (i) ''reality'' (that microscopic objects have real properties determining the outcomes of quantum mechanical measurements), and (ii) ''locality'' (that reality in one location is not influenced by measurements performed simultaneously at a distant location). Bell was able to derive from those two assumptions an important result, namely Bell's inequality. The theoretical (and later experimental) violation of this inequality implies that at least one of the two assumptions must be false.\n\nIn two respects Bell's 1964 paper was a step forward compared to the EPR paper: firstly, it considered more [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] than merely the [[EPR paradox|element of physical reality]] in the EPR paper; and Bell's inequality was, in part, experimentally testable, thus raising the possibility of testing the local realism hypothesis. Limitations on such tests to date are noted below.  Whereas Bell's paper deals only with deterministic hidden variable theories, Bell's theorem was later generalized to [[stochastic]] theories<ref name=\"Clauser–Horne\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.10.526|title=Experimental consequences of objective local theories|year=1974|last1=Clauser|first1=John F.|journal=Physical Review D|volume=10|issue=2|pages=526–535|bibcode=1974PhRvD..10..526C|url=http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225072037/http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/physics/Clauser1974/Clauser1974.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}</ref> as well, and it was also realised<ref>{{cite journal |last= Eberhard |first=P.

Existence of these variables is called the assumption of realism, or the assumption of [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nAfter the EPR paper, quantum mechanics was in an unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, in the sense that it failed to account for some elements of physical reality, or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical [[Observer (quantum physics)|observers]], now commonly referred to as [[Alice and Bob|''Alice'' and ''Bob'']], perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a ''[[spin singlet]] state''. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the ''x'' axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an ''element of physical reality'', or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.\n\nIn QM, predictions are formulated in terms of [[probability|probabilities]] — for example, the probability that an [[electron]] will be detected in a particular place, or the probability that its spin is up or down. The idea persisted, however, that the electron in fact has a ''definite'' position and spin, and that QM's weakness is its inability to predict those values precisely. The possibility existed that some unknown theory, such as a ''hidden variables theory'', might be able to predict those quantities exactly, while at the same time also being in complete agreement with the probabilities predicted by QM. If such a hidden variables theory exists, then because the hidden variables are not described by QM the latter would be an incomplete theory.\n\n==Local realism==\nThe concept of local realism is formalized to state, and prove, Bell's theorem and generalizations.  A common approach is the following:\n# There is a [[probability space]] {{math|Λ}} and the observed outcomes by both Alice and Bob result by random sampling of the (unknown, \"hidden\") parameter {{math|''λ'' ∈ Λ}}.\n# The values observed by Alice or Bob are functions of the local detector settings and the hidden parameter only. Thus, there are functions {{math|''A'',''B'' : ''S''<sup>2</sup> × Λ → {-1, +1} }}, where a detector setting is modeled as a location on the unit sphere {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}}, such that\n#*The value observed by Alice with detector setting {{mvar|a}} is {{math|''A''(''a'', ''λ'')}}\n#*The value observed by Bob with detector setting {{mvar|b}} is {{math|''B''(''b'', ''λ'')}}\n\nPerfect anti-correlation would require {{math|''B''(''c'', ''λ'') {{=}} −''A''(''c'', ''λ''), ''c'' ∈ ''S''<sup>2</sup>}}. Implicit in assumption 1) above, the hidden parameter space {{math|Λ}} has a [[probability measure]] {{mvar|μ}} and the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation]] of a random variable {{mvar|X}} on {{math|Λ}} with respect to {{mvar|μ}} is written\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{E}(X) = \\int_\\Lambda X(\\lambda) p(\\lambda) d \\lambda, </math>\n\nwhere for accessibility of notation we assume that the probability measure has a [[probability density]] {{mvar|p}} that therefore is nonnegative and integrates to {{math|1}}. The hidden parameter is often thought of as being associated with the source but it can just as well also contain components associated with the two measurement devices.\n\n== Bell inequalities ==\nBell inequalities concern measurements made by observers on pairs of particles that have interacted and then separated. Assuming local realism, certain constraints must hold on the relationships between the correlations between subsequent measurements of the particles under various possible measurement settings. Let {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} be as above. Define for the present purposes three correlation functions:\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''e''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the experimentally measured correlation defined by\n*:<math>C_e(a, b) = \\frac{N_{++} + N_{--} - N_{+-} - N_{-+}}{N_{++} + N_{--} + N_{+-} + N_{-+}},</math>\n:where {{math|''N''<sub>++</sub>}} is the number of measurements yielding \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''a'''}} measured by Alice (first subscript {{math|+}}) ''and'' \"spin up\" in the direction of {{math|'''b'''}} measured by Bob. The other occurrences of {{mvar|N}} are analogously defined.\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by quantum mechanics. This is given by the expression\n*:<math>C_q(a, b) = \\left\\langle A \\left|(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf b)^{(2)}(\\boldsymbol\\sigma \\cdot \\mathbf a)^{(1)}\\right| A \\right\\rangle,</math>\n:where {{mvar|A}} is the antisymmetric spin wave function. This value is calculated to be\n::<math>C_q(a, b) = -\\mathbf a \\cdot \\mathbf b.</math>\n*Let {{math|''C''<sub>''h''</sub>(''a'', ''b'')}} denote the correlation as predicted by any hidden variable theory. In the formalization of above, this is\n*:<math>C_h(a, b) = E(A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda) B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda)) = \\int_\\Lambda A(\\mathbf{a}, \\lambda)B(\\mathbf{b}, \\lambda) p(\\lambda) d\\lambda.</math>\n\n{{Hidden begin\n | title style=color:green; background:lightgrey;\n | title=Details on calculation of {{math|''C''<sub>''q''</sub>('''a''', '''b''')}}\n}}\nThe two-particle spin space is the [[tensor product]] of the two-dimensional spin Hilbert spaces of the individual particles. Each individual space is an [[Irreducible representation|irreducible representation space]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The product space decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations with definite total spins {{math|0}} and {{math|1}} of dimensions {{math|1}} and {{math|3}} respectively. Full details may be found in [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Clebsch—Gordan decomposition]].

The singlet state has total spin {{math|0}} as may be verified by application of the operator of total spin {{math|'''J''' · '''J''' {{=}} ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>) ⋅ ('''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub>)}} by a calculation similar to that presented below.\n\nThe expectation value of the operator\n:<math>\n  \\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)^{(2)}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a}\\right)^{(1)} =\n  \\left(\\operatorname{Id} \\otimes \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{a} \\otimes \\operatorname{Id}\\right),\n</math>\n\nin the singlet state can be calculated straightforwardly.

That is to say, predictions of quantum mechanics have never been falsified by experiment. These experiments include such that can rule out local hidden variable theories. But see below on possible loopholes.\n\n=== Original Bell's inequality ===\nThe inequality that Bell derived can then be written as:<ref name=Bell1964/>\n\n:<math>C_h(a, c) - C_h(b, a) - C_h(b, c) \\le 1,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|a, b}} and {{mvar|c}} refer to three arbitrary settings of the two analysers. This inequality is however restricted in its application to the rather special case in which the outcomes on both sides of the experiment are always exactly anticorrelated whenever the analysers are parallel. The advantage of restricting attention to this special case is the resulting simplicity of the derivation. In experimental work, the inequality is not very useful because it is hard, if not impossible, to create ''perfect'' anti-correlation.\n\nThis simple form has an intuitive explanation, however. It is equivalent to the following elementary result from probability theory. Consider three (highly correlated, and possibly biased) coin-flips {{mvar|X, Y}}, and ''Z'', with the property that:\n#''X'' and ''Y'' give the same outcome (both heads or both tails) 99% of the time\n#''Y'' and ''Z'' also give the same outcome 99% of the time,\n\nthen ''X'' and ''Z'' must also yield the same outcome at least 98% of the time. The number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Y'' (1/100) plus the number of mismatches between ''Y'' and ''Z'' (1/100) are together the ''maximum possible'' number of mismatches between ''X'' and ''Z'' (a simple [[Fréchet inequalities|Boole–Fréchet inequality]]).\n\nImagine a pair of particles that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't know in advance how they are going to be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.\n\nStart with one setting exactly opposite to the other. All the pairs of particles give the same outcome (each pair is either both spin up or both spin down). Now shift Alice's setting by one degree relative to Bob's. They are now one degree off being exactly opposite to one another. A small fraction of the pairs, say ''f'', now give different outcomes. If instead we had left Alice's setting unchanged but shifted Bob's by one degree (in the opposite direction), then again a fraction ''f'' of the pairs of particles turns out to give different outcomes. Finally consider what happens when both shifts are implemented at the same time: the two settings are now exactly two degrees away from being opposite to one another. By the mismatch argument, the chance of a mismatch at two degrees can't be more than twice the chance of a mismatch at one degree: it cannot be more than 2''f''.\n\nCompare this with the predictions from quantum mechanics for the singlet state. For a small angle {{mvar|θ}}, measured in radians, the chance of a different outcome is approximately <math>f_1=\\theta^2/4</math> as explained by [[small-angle approximation]]. At two times this small angle, the chance of a mismatch is therefore about 4 times larger, since <math>f_2=(2\\theta)^2/4=2^2 \\theta^2/4 \\approx 4f_1</math>. But we just argued that it cannot be more than 2 times as large.\n\nThis intuitive formulation is due to [[David Mermin]]. The small-angle limit is discussed in Bell's original article, and therefore goes right back to the origin of the Bell inequalities.\n\n===CHSH inequality===\n{{Main article|CHSH inequality}}\nGeneralizing Bell's original inequality,<ref name=Bell1964/> [[John Clauser]], Michael Horne, [[Abner Shimony]] and R.

It follows that for any <math>\\lambda\\in\\Lambda</math>, one of <math>B+B'</math> and <math>B-B'</math> is zero, and the other is <math>\\pm2</math>.

However, before the discovery of quantum mechanics, both realism and locality were completely uncontroversial features of physical theories.\n\n====Quantum mechanical predictions violate CHSH inequalities====\nThe measurements performed by Alice and Bob are spin measurements on electrons. Alice can choose between two detector settings labeled <math>a</math> and <math>a'</math>; these settings correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z</math> or the ''<math>x</math>'' axis. Bob can choose between two detector settings labeled ''<math>b</math>'' and <math>b'</math>; these correspond to measurement of spin along the <math>z'</math> or <math>x'</math> axis, where the <math>x'-z'</math> coordinate system is rotated 135° relative to the <math>x-z</math> coordinate system.  The spin observables are represented by the 2 × 2 self-adjoint matrices:\n\n:<math> S_x = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 &  0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad S_z = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThese are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]], which are known to have eigenvalues equal to <math>\\pm 1</math>. As is customary, we will use [[bra–ket notation]] to denote the eigenvectors of <math>S_z</math> as <math>|0\\rangle,|1\\rangle</math>, where<math display=\"block\">|0\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\n|1\\rangle\\equiv\\begin{pmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>Consider now the single state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math> defined as <math display=\"block\">|\\Phi^-\\rangle\\equiv\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}\\left(|0,1\\rangle-|1,0\\rangle\\right),</math>where we used the shortened notation <math>|0,1\\rangle\\equiv|0\\rangle\\otimes|1\\rangle,\n|1,0\\rangle\\equiv|1\\rangle\\otimes|0\\rangle.</math>\n\nAccording to quantum mechanics, the choice of measurements is encoded into the choice of Hermitian operators applied to this state. In particular, consider the following operators:<math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  A(a)  &= S_z \\otimes I\\\\\n  A(a') &= S_x \\otimes I\\\\\n  B(b)  &= \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z + S_x)\\\\\n  B(b') &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\ I \\otimes (S_z - S_x),\n\\end{align}</math>where <math>A(a),A(a')</math> represent two measurement choices of Alice, and <math>B(b),B(b')</math> two measurement choices of Bob.\n\nTo obtain the expectation value given by a given measurement choice of Alice and Bob, one has to compute the expectation value of the corresponding pair of operators (for example, <math>A(a)B(b)</math> if the inputs are chosen to be <math>a, b</math>) over the shared state <math>|\\Phi^-\\rangle</math>.\n\nFor example, the expectation value <math>\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle</math> corresponding to Alice choosing the measurement setting <math>a</math> and Bob choosing the measurement setting <math>b</math> is computed as<math display=\"block\">\\langle A(a)B(b)\\rangle \\equiv \\langle \\Phi^-|\\left(\\frac{-1}{\\sqrt2}S_z\\otimes(S_x+S_z) \\right)\n|\\Phi^-\\rangle =\n-\\frac{1}{2}\\langle\\Phi^-|\\Big[|0\\rangle\\otimes(|0\\rangle-|1\\rangle)+|1\\rangle\\otimes(|1\\rangle+|0\\rangle)\\Big]\n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt2}.</math>Similar computations are used to obtain<math display=\"block\">\\begin{align}\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B(b) \\right\\rangle =\n    \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B\\left(b'\\right) \\right\\rangle &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\n                \\left\\langle A(a) B\\left(b'\\right) \\right\\rangle &= -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n\\end{align}</math>It follows that the value of <math>S</math> given by this particular experimental arrangement is\n\n:<math>\n  \\left\\langle A(a) B(b) \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B\\left(b'\\right) \\right\\rangle +\n  \\left\\langle A\\left(a'\\right) B(b) \\right\\rangle - \\left\\langle A(a) B\\left(b'\\right) \\right\\rangle =\n    \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2} > 2.\n</math>\n\nBell's Theorem: If the quantum mechanical formalism is correct, then the system consisting of a pair of entangled electrons cannot satisfy the principle of local realism.

The quantum state of the pair of entangled photons is not the singlet state, and the correspondence between angles and outcomes is different from that in the spin-half set-up. The polarization of a photon is measured in a pair of perpendicular directions. Relative to a given orientation, polarization is either vertical (denoted by V or by +) or horizontal (denoted by H or by -). The photon pairs are generated in the quantum state\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left (|V\\rangle\\otimes |V\\rangle+|H\\rangle\\otimes|H\\rangle \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>|V\\rangle</math> and <math>|H\\rangle</math> denotes the state of a single vertically or horizontally polarized photon, respectively (relative to a fixed and common reference direction for both particles).\n\nWhen the polarization of both photons is measured in the same direction, both give the same outcome: perfect correlation. When measured at directions making an angle 45° with one another, the outcomes are completely random (uncorrelated). Measuring at directions at 90° to one another, the two are perfectly anti-correlated. In general, when the polarizers are at an angle {{mvar|θ}} to one another, the correlation is {{math|cos(2''θ'')}}. So relative to the correlation function for the singlet state of spin half particles, we have a positive rather than a negative cosine function, and angles are halved: the correlation is periodic with period {{mvar|π}} instead of {{math|2''π''}}.\n\nBell's inequalities are tested by \"coincidence counts\" from a Bell test experiment such as the optical one shown in the diagram.  Pairs of particles are emitted as a result of a quantum process, analysed with respect to some key property such as polarisation direction, then detected.  The setting (orientations) of the analysers are selected by the experimenter.\n\nBell test experiments to date overwhelmingly violate Bell's inequality.\n\n===Two classes of Bell inequalities===\nThe [[Loopholes_in_Bell_test_experiments#Detection_efficiency,_or_fair_sampling|fair sampling problem]] was faced openly in the 1970s. In early designs of their 1973 experiment, Freedman and Clauser<ref name=\"Clauser–Freedman\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.28.938 |title=Experimental Test of Local Hidden-Variable Theories |year=1972 |last1=Freedman |first1=Stuart J. |last2=Clauser |first2=John F. |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=28 |issue=14 |pages=938–941|bibcode = 1972PhRvL..28..938F |url= http://dieumsnh.qfb.umich.mx/archivoshistoricosMQ/ModernaHist/Freedman.pdf }}</ref> used ''fair sampling'' in the form of the Clauser–Horne–Shimony–Holt (CHSH<ref name=\"Clauser 1969\"/>) hypothesis. However, shortly afterwards Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser–Horne\"/>  made the important distinction between inhomogeneous (IBI) and homogeneous (HBI) Bell inequalities. Testing an IBI requires that we compare certain coincidence rates in two separated detectors with the singles rates of the two detectors. Nobody needed to perform the experiment, because singles rates with all detectors in the 1970s were at least ten times all the coincidence rates. So, taking into account this low detector efficiency, the QM prediction actually satisfied the IBI. To arrive at an experimental design in which the QM prediction violates IBI we require detectors whose efficiency exceeds 82.8% for singlet states,<ref name=\"Garg & Mermin, 1987\">{{citation |author1=Anupam Garg |author2=N.D.

This is now within reach.\n\n===Practical challenges===\n{{Main article|Loopholes in Bell test experiments}}\n\nBecause, at that time, even the best detectors didn't detect a large fraction of all photons, Clauser and Horne<ref name=\"Clauser–Horne\"/> recognized that testing Bell's inequality required some extra assumptions. They introduced the ''No Enhancement Hypothesis'' (NEH):\n\n{{quote|A light signal, originating in an [[atomic cascade]] for example, has a certain probability of activating a detector.  Then, if a polarizer is interposed between the cascade and the detector, the detection probability cannot increase.}}\n\nGiven this assumption, there is a Bell inequality between the coincidence rates with polarizers and coincidence rates without polarizers.\n\nThe experiment was performed by Freedman and Clauser,<ref name=\"Clauser–Freedman\"/> who found that the Bell's inequality was violated. So the no-enhancement hypothesis cannot be true in a local hidden variables model.\n\nWhile early experiments used atomic cascades,  later experiments have used parametric down-conversion, following a suggestion by Reid and Walls,<ref>{{cite journal|author1-link=Margaret D. Reid |first1=M. D. |last1=Reid |first2=D.

As a result, recent experiments with photons no longer have to suffer from the detection loophole. This made the photon the first experimental system for which all main experimental loopholes were surmounted, although at first only in separate experiments. From 2015, experimentalists were able to surmount all the main experimental loopholes simultaneously; see [[Bell test experiments]].\n\n== Metaphysical aspects ==\nMost advocates of the hidden-variables idea believe that experiments have ruled out local hidden variables.  They are ready to give up locality, explaining the violation of Bell's inequality by means of a non-local [[hidden variable theory]], in which the particles exchange information about their states. This is the basis of the [[Bohm interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which requires that all particles in the universe be able to instantaneously exchange information with all others. A 2007 experiment ruled out a large class of non-Bohmian non-local hidden variable theories.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature05677 |title=An experimental test of non-local realism |year=2007 |last1=Gröblacher |first1=Simon |last2=Paterek |first2=Tomasz |last3=Kaltenbaek |first3=Rainer |last4=Brukner |first4=Časlav |last5=Żukowski |first5=Marek |last6=Aspelmeyer |first6=Markus |last7=Zeilinger |first7=Anton |journal=Nature |volume=446 |issue=7138 |pages=871–5 |pmid=17443179|bibcode = 2007Natur.446..871G | arxiv= 0704.2529 }}</ref>\n\nIf the hidden variables can communicate with each other faster than light, Bell's inequality can easily be violated. Once one particle is measured, it can communicate the necessary correlations to the other particle. Since in relativity the notion of simultaneity is not absolute, this is unattractive. One idea is to replace instantaneous communication with a process that travels backwards in time along the past [[light cone]]. This is the idea behind a [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics, which interprets the statistical emergence of a quantum history as a gradual coming to agreement between histories that go both forward and backward in time.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.58.647|title=The transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics|year=1986|last1=Cramer|first1=John|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics| volume=58| issue=3| pages=647–687| bibcode = 1986RvMP...58..647C }}</ref>\n\nA few advocates of deterministic models have not given up on local hidden variables. For example, [[Gerard 't Hooft]] has argued that the [[superdeterminism]] loophole cannot be dismissed.<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=0908.3408 |author1=Gerard 't Hooft |title=Entangled quantum states in a local deterministic theory |class=quant-ph |year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite arXiv|eprint=quant-ph/0701097|author1=Gerard 't Hooft|title=The Free-Will Postulate in Quantum Mechanics |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nA possible (but not universally accepted) solution is offered by the [[many-worlds interpretation|many worlds theory]] of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement does not lead to a random choice of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.\n\nThis point underlines the fact that the argument that realism is incompatible with quantum mechanics and locality depends on a particular formalization of the concept of realism. In its weakest form, the assumption underpinning that particular formalization is called [[counterfactual definiteness]]. This is the assumption that outcomes of measurements that are not performed are just as real as those of measurements that were performed.  Counterfactual definiteness is an uncontroversial property of all classical physical theories prior to quantum theory, due to their determinism. Many worlds interpretations are not only counterfactually indefinite, but are also factually indefinite. The results of all experiments, even ones that have been performed, are not uniquely determined.\n\nIf one chooses to reject counterfactual definiteness, reality has been made smaller, and there is no non-locality problem. On the other hand, one is thereby introducing irreducible or intrinsic randomness into our picture of the world: randomness that cannot be \"explained\" as merely the reflection of our ignorance of underlying, variable, physical quantities. Non-determinism becomes a fundamental property of nature.\n\nAssuming counterfactual definiteness, reality has been enlarged, and there is a non-locality problem. On the other hand, in the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, reality consists only of a deterministically evolving wave function and non-locality is a non-issue.\n\nThere have also been repeated claims that Bell's arguments are irrelevant because they depend on hidden assumptions that, in fact, are questionable.  For example, [[E. T. Jaynes]]<ref name=\"E.T. Jaynes 1989\">{{Cite book |title=Clearing up Mysteries—The Original Goal |year=1989 |last1=Jaynes |first1=E.

It only applies to a certain class of local hidden variable theories.  In fact, it might have just missed the kind of hidden variable theories that Einstein is most interested in.\n\n[[Richard D. Gill]] claimed that Jaynes misunderstood Bell's analysis.

Rabin|Rabin's]] [[oblivious transfer]] protocol. This non-locality was originally supposed to be illusory, because the standard interpretation could easily do away with action-at-a-distance by simply assigning to each particle definite spin-states for all possible spin directions. The EPR argument was: therefore these definite states exist, therefore quantum theory is incomplete in the EPR sense, since they do not appear in the theory. Bell's theorem showed that the \"entangledness\" prediction of quantum mechanics has a degree of non-locality that cannot be explained away by any classical theory of local hidden variables.\n\nWhat is powerful about Bell's theorem is that it doesn't refer to any particular theory of local hidden variables. It shows that nature violates the most general assumptions behind classical pictures, not just details of some particular models. No combination of local deterministic and local random hidden variables can reproduce the phenomena predicted by quantum mechanics and repeatedly observed in experiments.<ref>{{cite book|author1=R.G.

Here, <math>r=3.</math>]]\nIn [[real analysis]], '''Bernoulli's inequality''' (named after [[Jacob Bernoulli]]) is an [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] that approximates [[exponentiation]]s of&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''.\n\nThe inequality states that\n\n:<math>(1 + x)^r \\geq 1 + rx</math>\n\nfor every [[integer]] ''r''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;0 and every [[real number]] ''x''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;−2. \nIf the exponent ''r'' is [[even number|even]], then the inequality is valid for ''all'' real numbers&nbsp;''x''. The strict version of the inequality reads\n\n:<math>(1 + x)^r > 1 + rx</math>\n\nfor every integer ''r''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2 and every real number ''x''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;−1 with ''x''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0.\n\nThere is also a generalized version that says for every real number r ≥ 1 and real number x ≥ -1,\n:<math>(1 + x)^r \\geq 1 + rx,</math>\n\nwhile for 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1 and real number x ≥ -1,\n\n:<math>(1 + x)^r \\leq 1 + rx.</math>\n\nBernoulli's inequality is often used as the crucial step in the [[proof (math)|proof]] of other inequalities. It can itself be proved using [[mathematical induction]], as shown below.\n\n==History==\nJacob Bernoulli first published the inequality in his treatise “Positiones Arithmeticae de Seriebus Infinitis” (Basel, 1689), where he used the inequality often.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/1891 mathematics - First use of Bernoulli's inequality and its name - History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAccording to Joseph E. Hofmann, Über die Exercitatio Geometrica des M. A. Ricci (1963), p.&nbsp;177, the inequality is actually due to Sluse in his Mesolabum (1668 edition), Chapter IV \"De maximis & minimis\".<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Proof of the inequality==\n\nWe proceed with mathematical induction in the following form:\n* we prove the inequality for <math>r\\in\\{0,1\\}</math>,\n* from validity for some ''r'' we deduce validity for ''r+2''.\n\nFor ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>(1+x)^0 \\ge 1+0x </math>\n\nis equivalent to 1&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1 which is true as required.\n\nSimilarly, for ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 we have\n\n:<math>(1+x)^r=1+x\\ge 1+x=1+rx. </math>\n\nNow suppose the statement is true for ''r''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k'':\n\n:<math>(1+x)^k \\ge 1+kx. </math>\n\nThen it follows that \n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(1+x)^{k+2} &= (1+x)^k(1+x)^2 \\ge \\\\\n&\\ge (1+kx)\\left(1+2x+x^2\\right)= \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\text{ by hypothesis and }(1+x)^2\\ge 0 \\\\\n&=1+2x+x^2+kx+2kx^2+kx^3= \\\\ \n&=1+(k+2)x+kx^2(x+2)+x^2\\ge \\\\\n&\\ge 1+(k+2)x\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nsince <math>x^2\\ge 0</math> as well as <math>x+2\\ge0</math>. By the modified induction we conclude the statement is true for every non-negative integer ''r''.\n\n==Generalization==\n\nThe exponent ''r'' can be generalized to an arbitrary real number as follows: if ''x''&nbsp;>&nbsp;−1, then\n\n:<math>(1 + x)^r \\geq 1 + rx</math>\n\nfor ''r''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;0 or ''r''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1, and\n\n:<math>(1 + x)^r \\leq 1 + rx</math>\n\nfor 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1.\n\nThis generalization can be proved by comparing [[derivative]]s.\nAgain, the strict versions of these inequalities require ''x''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 and&nbsp;''r''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1.\n\n== Related inequalities ==\nThe following inequality estimates the ''r''-th power of 1 + ''x'' from the other side.

Its major interest is the way it restricts the possible topological types of the underlying real 4-manifold. It was proved independently by {{harvs|txt|last=Yau|first=Shing-Tung|authorlink=Shing-Tung Yau| year1=1977|year2=1978}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yoichi Miyaoka|first=Yoichi|last=Miyaoka|year=1977}}, after {{harvs|txt|last=Van de Ven|first=Antonius|year=1966}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Fedor Bogomolov|first=Fedor|last=Bogomolov|year=1978}} proved weaker versions with the constant 3 replaced by 8 and 4.\n\n[[Armand Borel]] and [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]] showed that the inequality is  best possible by finding infinitely many cases where equality holds. The inequality is false in positive characteristic: {{harvs|txt|first=William E. |last=Lang|year=1983}} and {{harvs|txt|last=Easton|first=Robert W.|year=2008}} gave examples of surfaces in characteristic ''p'', such as [[generalized Raynaud surface]]s, for which it fails.\n\n==Formulation of the inequality==\nThe conventional formulation of the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality is as follows. Let ''X'' be a compact complex surface of [[general type]], and let ''c''<sub>1</sub> =&nbsp;''c''<sub>1</sub>(''X'') and ''c''<sub>2</sub> =&nbsp;''c''<sub>2</sub>(''X'') be the first and second [[Chern class]] of the complex tangent bundle of the surface.  Then\n\n: <math> c_1^2 \\le 3 c_2. </math>\n\nMoreover if equality holds then ''X'' is a quotient of a ball. The latter statement is a consequence of Yau's differential geometric approach which is based on his resolution of the [[Calabi conjecture]].\n \nSince <math> c_2(X) = e(X) </math> is the topological [[Euler characteristic]] and by the [[Hirzebruch signature theorem|Thom–Hirzebruch signature theorem]] <math> c_1^2(X) = 2 e(X) + 3\\sigma(X) </math> where <math>\\sigma(X)</math> is the signature of the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] on the second cohomology, the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality can also be written as a restriction on the topological type of the surface of general type:\n\n:<math>  \\sigma(X) \\le \\frac{1}{3} e(X), </math>\n\nmoreover if <math>\\sigma(X) = (1/3)e(X)</math> then the universal covering is a ball.\n\nTogether with the [[Noether inequality]] the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality sets boundaries in the search for complex surfaces. Mapping out the topological types that are realized as complex surfaces is called [[geography of surfaces]]. see [[Surface of general type|surfaces of general type]].\n\n==Surfaces with ''c''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> ==\n\nIf ''X'' is a surface of general type with <math> c_1^2 = 3 c_2</math>, so that  equality holds in the Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality,  then {{harvtxt|Yau|1977}} proved that ''X'' is isomorphic to a quotient of the unit ball in <math>{\\mathbb C}^2</math> by an infinite discrete group. Examples of surfaces satisfying this equality are hard to find.  {{harvtxt|Borel|1963}} showed that there are infinitely many values of ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> for which a surface exists. {{harvs|txt|last=Mumford|first=David|authorlink=David Mumford|year=1979}} found a [[fake projective plane]] with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> = 9, which is the minimum possible value because ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} + ''c''<sub>2</sub> is always divisible by 12, and {{harvtxt|Prasad|Yeung|2007}}, {{harvtxt|Prasad|Yeung|2010}}, {{harvs|txt | last1=Cartwright | first1=Donald I. | last2=Steger | first2=Tim | title=Enumeration of the 50 fake projective planes | publisher=Elsevier Masson SAS  | doi=10.1016/j.crma.2009.11.016 | journal=[[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences|Comptes Rendus Mathématique]] | volume=348 | issue=1 | pages=11–13|year=2010}} showed that there are exactly 50 fake projective planes.\n\n{{harvtxt|Barthel|Hirzebruch|Höfer|1987}} gave a method for finding examples, which in particular produced a surface ''X'' with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> = 3<sup>2</sup>5<sup>4</sup>. \n{{harvtxt|Ishida|1988}} found a quotient of this surface with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> = 45, and taking unbranched coverings of this quotient gives examples with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> = 45''k'' for any positive integer ''k''.\n{{harvs|txt | last1=Cartwright | first1=Donald I. | last2=Steger | first2=Tim | title=Enumeration of the 50 fake projective planes | publisher=Elsevier Masson SAS  | doi=10.1016/j.crma.2009.11.016 | journal=Comptes Rendus Mathématique | volume=348 | issue=1 | pages=11–13|year=2010}} found examples with ''c''{{sup sub|2|1}} = 3''c''<sub>2</sub> = 9''n'' for every positive integer ''n''.\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Barth | first1=Wolf P. | last2=Hulek | first2=Klaus | last3=Peters | first3=Chris A.M. | last4=Van de Ven | first4=Antonius | title=Compact Complex Surfaces | publisher= Springer-Verlag, Berlin | series=Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3.

From the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]] applied to  the numbers <math>1\\cdot a_1,2\\cdot a_2,\\dots,n \\cdot a_n</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{MG}(a_1,\\dots,a_n)=\\mathrm{MG}(1a_1,2a_2,\\dots,na_n)(n!)^{-1/n}\\le \\mathrm{MA}(1a_1,2a_2,\\dots,na_n)(n!)^{-1/n}</math>\n\nwhere MG stands for geometric mean, and MA &mdash; for arithmetic mean. The [[Stirling formula|Stirling-type]] inequality <math>n!\\ge  \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\, n^n e^{-n}</math> applied to <math>n+1</math> implies\n\n:<math>(n!)^{-1/n} \\le \\frac{e}{n+1}</math> for all <math>n\\ge1.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>MG(a_1,\\dots,a_n) \\le \\frac{e}{n(n+1)}\\,  \\sum_{1\\le k \\le n}   k a_k   \\, ,</math>\n\nwhence\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n\\ge1}MG(a_1,\\dots,a_n) \\le\\,  e\\, \\sum_{k\\ge1} \\bigg( \\sum_{n\\ge k}  \\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\\bigg) \\, k a_k =\\, e\\, \\sum_{k\\ge1}\\,  a_k  \\,  ,</math>\n\nproving the inequality. Moreover, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means of <math>n</math> non-negative numbers is known to be an equality if and only if all the numbers coincide, that is, in the present case, if and only if <math>a_k= C/k</math> for <math>k=1,\\dots,n</math>. As a   consequence, Carleman's inequality is never an equality for a convergent series, unless all <math>a_n</math> vanish, just because the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] is divergent.\n\nOne can also prove Carleman's inequality by starting with [[Hardy's inequality]]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left (\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots +a_n}{n}\\right )^p\\le \\left (\\frac{p}{p-1}\\right )^p\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n^p</math>\n\nfor the non-negative numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub>,''a''<sub>2</sub>,...  and ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1,  replacing each ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> with ''a''{{su|b=n|p=1/''p''}}, and letting ''p''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;&infin;.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n | last       = Hardy\n | first      = G.

We prove the inequality\n: <math>\\big| \\langle u,v \\rangle \\big| \\leq \\|u\\| \\|v\\|</math>\nand that equality holds if and only if either <math>u</math> or <math>v</math> is a multiple of the other (which includes the special case that either is the zero vector).\n\nIf <math>v = 0</math>, it is clear that there is equality, and in this case <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are also linearly dependent, regardless of <math>u</math>, so the theorem is true. Similarly if <math>u = 0</math>. One henceforth assumes that <math>v</math> is nonzero.\n\nLet\n: <math>z= u-u_v= u-\\frac {\\langle u, v \\rangle} {\\langle v, v \\rangle} v.</math>\nThen, by linearity of the inner product in its first argument, one has\n: <math>\\langle z, v \\rangle = \\left\\langle u -\\frac {\\langle u, v \\rangle} {\\langle v, v \\rangle} v, v \\right\\rangle = \\langle u, v \\rangle - \\frac {\\langle u, v \\rangle} {\\langle v, v \\rangle} \\langle v, v \\rangle = 0.</math>\nTherefore,  <math>z</math> is a vector orthogonal to the vector <math>v</math> (Indeed, <math>z</math>  is the [[vector projection|projection]] of <math>u</math>  onto the plane orthogonal to <math>v</math> .) We can thus apply the [[Pythagorean theorem#Inner product spaces|Pythagorean theorem]] to\n: <math>u= \\frac {\\langle u, v \\rangle} {\\langle v, v \\rangle} v+z</math>\nwhich gives\n: <math>\\|u\\|^2 = \\left|\\frac{\\langle u, v \\rangle}{\\langle v, v \\rangle}\\right|^2 \\|v\\|^2 + \\|z\\|^2 = \\frac{|\\langle u, v \\rangle|^2}{( \\|v\\|^2 )^2}\\,\\|v\\|^2 +\\|z\\|^2= \\frac{|\\langle u, v \\rangle|^2}{\\|v\\|^2} + \\|z\\|^2 \\geq \\frac{|\\langle u, v \\rangle|^2}{\\|v\\|^2}</math>\nand, after multiplication by <math>\\| v \\|^2</math> and taking square root, we get the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\nMoreover, if the relation <math>\\geq</math> in the above expression is actually an equality, then <math>\\| z \\|^2 = 0</math> and hence <math>z = 0</math>; the definition of <math>z</math> then establishes a relation of linear dependence between <math>u</math> and <math>v</math>. On the other hand, if <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are linearly dependent, then there exists <math>c \\in \\mathbb{F}</math> such that <math>u=c \\cdot v</math> (since <math>v \\ne 0</math>).

It can also be restated in terms of the vector coordinates <math>v_1, v_2, u_1</math> and <math>u_2</math> as\n: <math>(u_1v_1 + u_2v_2)^2 \\leq (u_1^2 + u_2^2) (v_1^2 + v_2^2),</math>\nwhere equality holds if and only if the vector <math>(u_1,u_2)</math> is in the same or opposite direction as the vector <math>(v_1, v_2),</math> or if one of them is the zero vector.\n\n=== R<sup>''n''</sup> (''n''-dimensional Euclidean space)===\nIn [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\mathbb R ^n</math> with the standard inner product, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is\n: <math>\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i v_i\\right)^2\\leq \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n u_i^2\\right) \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n v_i^2\\right)</math>\n\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality can be proved using only ideas from elementary algebra in this case. \nConsider the following quadratic polynomial in <math>x</math>\n: <math>0 \\leq (u_1 x + v_1)^2 + \\cdots + (u_n x + v_n)^2 = \\left( \\sum u_i^2 \\right) x^2 + 2 \\left( \\sum u_i v_i \\right) x + \\sum v_i^2.</math>\nSince it is nonnegative, it has at most one real root for <math>x</math>, hence its [[discriminant]] is less than or equal to zero. That is,\n: <math>\\left(\\sum ( u_i v_i ) \\right)^2 - \\sum {u_i^2}  \\sum {v_i^2} \\le 0,</math>\nwhich yields the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.\n\n===L<sup>2</sup>===\nFor the inner product space of [[square-integrable]] complex-valued [[function (mathematics)|functions]], one has\n: <math>\\left|\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} f(x) \\overline{g(x)}\\,dx\\right|^2 \\leq \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |f(x)|^2\\,dx  \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^n} |g(x)|^2 \\,dx.</math>\nA generalization of this is the [[Hölder inequality]].\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== Analysis ===\nThe [[triangle inequality]] for the standard norm is often shown as a consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, as follows: given vectors ''x'' and ''y'':\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\|x + y\\|^2 & = \\langle x + y, x + y \\rangle \\\\\n& = \\|x\\|^2 + \\langle x, y \\rangle + \\langle y, x \\rangle + \\|y\\|^2 \\\\\n& = \\|x\\|^2 + 2 \\operatorname{Re} \\langle x, y \\rangle + \\|y\\|^2\\\\\n& \\le \\|x\\|^2 + 2|\\langle x, y \\rangle| + \\|y\\|^2 \\\\\n& \\le \\|x\\|^2 + 2\\|x\\|\\|y\\| + \\|y\\|^2 \\\\\n& = (\\|x\\| + \\|y\\|)^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTaking square roots gives the triangle inequality.\n\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality is used to prove that the inner product is a [[continuous function]] with respect to the [[topology]] induced by the inner product itself.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bachman |first1=George |last2=Narici |first2=Lawrence |date=2012-09-26 |title=Functional Analysis |publisher=Courier Corporation |isbn=9780486136554 |pages=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_lTDAgAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Swartz |first=Charles |date=1994-02-21 |title=Measure, Integration and Function Spaces |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9789814502511 |pages=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SsbsCgAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n=== Geometry ===\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality allows one to extend the notion of \"angle between two vectors\" to any [[real numbers|real]] inner-product space by defining:<ref>{{cite book |last=Ricardo |first=Henry |date=2009-10-21 |title=A Modern Introduction to Linear Algebra |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781439894613 |pages=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7bMBQAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Banerjee |first1=Sudipto |last2=Roy |first2=Anindya |date=2014-06-06 |title=Linear Algebra and Matrix Analysis for Statistics |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781482248241 |pages=181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDTcBQAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n: <math>\\cos\\theta_{xy}=\\frac{\\langle x,y\\rangle}{\\|x\\| \\|y\\|}.</math>\nThe Cauchy–Schwarz inequality proves that this definition is sensible, by showing that the right-hand side lies in the interval [&minus;1,&nbsp;1] and justifies the notion that (real) [[Hilbert space]]s are simply generalizations of the [[Euclidean space]].

They did not in the original article discuss how the two-channel inequality could be applied in real experiments with real imperfect detectors, though it was later proved (Bell, 1971)<ref name=\"Bell-1971\">J.

The diagram shows a typical optical experiment.  Coincidences (simultaneous detections) are recorded, the results being categorised as '++', '+&minus;', '&minus;+' or '&minus;&minus;' and corresponding counts accumulated.\n\nFour separate subexperiments are conducted, corresponding to the four terms <math>E(a, b)</math> in the test statistic ''S'' ({{EquationRef|2}}, above).  The settings ''a'', ''a''&prime;, ''b'' and ''b''&prime; are generally in practice chosen to be 0, 45°, 22.5° and 67.5° respectively &mdash; the \"Bell test angles\" &mdash; these being the ones for which the QM formula gives the greatest violation of the inequality.\n\nFor each selected value of ''a'' and ''b'', the numbers of coincidences in each category <math>\\left\\{ N_{++}, N_{--}, N_{+-}, N_{-+} \\right\\}</math> are recorded.  The experimental estimate for <math>E(a, b)</math> is then calculated as:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>E = \\frac {N_{++}  - N_{+-} - N_{-+} + N_{--}} {N_{++}  + N_{+-} + N_{-+}+ N_{--}}</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nOnce all the ''E''’s have been estimated, an experimental estimate of ''S'' ({{EquationNote|2}}) can be found.  If it is numerically greater than 2 it has infringed the CHSH inequality and the experiment is declared to have supported the QM ([[Quantum Mechanics]]) prediction and ruled out all local hidden variable theories.\n\nThe CHSH paper lists many preconditions (or \"reasonable and/or presumable assumptions\") to derive the simplified theorem and formula. For example, for the method to be valid, it has to be assumed that the detected pairs are a fair sample of those emitted. In actual experiments, detectors are never 100% efficient, so that only a sample of the emitted pairs are detected. A subtle, related requirement is that the hidden variables do not influence or determine detection probability in a way that would lead to different samples at each arm of the experiment.\n\n== Derivation ==\n\nThe original 1969 derivation will not be given here since it is not easy to follow and involves the assumption that the outcomes  are all +1 or &minus;1, never zero. Bell's 1971 derivation is more general.  He effectively assumes the \"Objective Local Theory\" later used by Clauser and Horne (Clauser, 1974).<ref name=\"Clauser-1974\"/>  It is assumed that any hidden variables associated with the detectors themselves are independent on the two sides and can be averaged out from the start.  Another derivation of interest is given in Clauser and Horne's 1974 paper, in which they start from the CH74 inequality.\n\nIt would appear from both these later derivations that the only assumptions really needed for the inequality itself (as opposed to the method of estimation of the test statistic) are that the distribution of the possible states of the source remains constant and the detectors on the two sides act independently.\n\n=== Bell's 1971 derivation ===\nThe following is based on page 37 of Bell's ''Speakable and Unspeakable'' (Bell, 1971),<ref name=\"Bell-1971\"/> the main change being to use the symbol ‘''E''’ instead of ‘''P''’ for the expected value of the quantum correlation.  This avoids any implication that the [[quantum correlation]] is itself a probability.\n\nWe start with the standard assumption of independence of the two sides, enabling us to obtain the joint probabilities of pairs of outcomes by multiplying the separate probabilities, for any selected value of the \"hidden variable\" λ.  λ is assumed to be drawn from a fixed distribution of possible states of the source, the probability of the source being in the state λ for any particular trial being given by the density function ρ(λ), the integral of which over the complete hidden variable space is 1.  We thus assume we can write:\n\n:<math>E(a, b) = \\int \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda</math>\n\nwhere <u>''A''</u> and <u>''B''</u> are the average values of the outcomes.  Since the possible values of ''A'' and ''B'' are &minus;1, 0 and +1, it follows that:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\left| \\underline{A} \\right| \\leq 1 \\quad \\left| \\underline{B} \\right| \\leq 1</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThen, if ''a'', ''a''&prime;, ''b'' and ''b''&prime; are alternative settings for the detectors,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      &E(a, b) - E\\left(a, b'\\right) \\\\\n\n  ={} &\\int \\left[ \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) - \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\\\\n\n  ={} &\\int \\left[ \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) - \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\pm {A}(a, \\lambda) {B}(b, \\lambda) {A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) {B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\mp {A}(a, \\lambda) {B}(b, \\lambda) {A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) {B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda\\\\\n\n  ={} &\\int \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\left[1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda - \\int \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\left[1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTaking absolute values of both sides, and applying the [[triangle inequality]] to the right-hand side, we obtain\n\n:<math>\\left| E(a, b) - E\\left(a, b'\\right) \\right| \\leq \\left| \\int \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\right| + \\left| \\int \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\left[1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\right|</math>\n\nWe use the fact that <math> \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) </math> and <math> \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) </math> are both non-negative to rewrite the right-hand side of this as\n\n:<math>\n  \\int \\left| \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right|\n       \\left| \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right)\\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\right| +\n  \\int \\left| \\underline{A}(a, \\lambda) \\underline{B}(b', \\lambda) \\right|\n       \\left| \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\right|\n</math>\n\nBy ({{EquationNote|4}}), this must be less than or equal to\n\n:<math>\\int \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda + \\int \\left[ 1 \\pm \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\right] \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda</math>\n\nwhich, using the fact that the integral of ρ(λ) is 1, is equal to\n\n:<math>2 \\pm \\left[ \\int \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}\\left(b', \\lambda\\right) \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda + \\int \\underline{A}\\left(a', \\lambda\\right) \\underline{B}(b, \\lambda) \\rho(\\lambda) d\\lambda \\right]</math>\n\nwhich is equal to <math>2 \\pm \\left[ E\\left(a', b'\\right) + E\\left(a', b\\right) \\right]</math>.\n\nPutting this together with the left-hand side, we have:\n\n:<math>\\left| E(a, b) - E\\left(a, b'\\right) \\right| \\; \\leq 2 \\; \\pm \\left[ E\\left(a', b'\\right) + E\\left(a', b\\right) \\right]</math>\n\nwhich means that the left-hand side is less than or equal to both <math>2 + \\left[ E\\left(a', b'\\right) + E\\left(a', b\\right) \\right]</math> and <math>2 - \\left[ E\\left(a', b'\\right) + E\\left(a', b\\right) \\right]</math>.

For instance, the [[Szemerédi–Trotter theorem]], an [[upper bound]] on the number of incidences that are possible between given numbers of points and lines in the plane,\nfollows by constructing a graph whose vertices are the points and whose edges are the segments of lines between incident points. If there were more incidences than the Szemerédi–Trotter bound, this graph would necessarily have more crossings than the total number of pairs of lines, an impossibility.\nThe inequality can also be used to prove [[Beck's theorem (geometry)|Beck's theorem]], that if a finite point set does not have a linear number of collinear points, then it determines a quadratic number of distinct lines.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Székely | first = L.

Each of these crossings can be removed by removing an edge from {{mvar|G}}. Thus we can find a graph with at least {{math|''e'' − cr(''G'')}} edges and {{mvar|n}} vertices with no crossings, and is thus a [[planar graph]]. But from [[planar graph#Euler's formula|Euler's formula]] we must then have {{math|''e'' − cr(''G'') ≤ 3''n''}}, and the claim follows. (In fact we have {{math|''e'' − cr(''G'') ≤ 3''n'' − 6}} for {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}).\n\nTo obtain the actual crossing number inequality, we now use a [[probabilistic method|probabilistic argument]]. We let {{math|0 < ''p'' < 1}} be a [[probability]] parameter to be chosen later, and construct a [[random graph|random subgraph]] {{mvar|H}} of {{mvar|G}} by allowing each vertex of {{mvar|G}} to lie in {{mvar|H}} independently with probability {{mvar|p}}, and allowing an edge of {{mvar|G}} to lie in {{mvar|H}} if and only if its two vertices were chosen to lie in {{mvar|H}}. Let {{mvar|e<sub>H</sub>, n<sub>H</sub>}} and {{math|cr<sub>''H''</sub>}} denote the number of edges, vertices and crossings of {{mvar|H}}, respectively. Since {{mvar|H}} is a subgraph of {{mvar|G}}, this diagram contains a diagram of {{mvar|H}}. By the preliminary crossing number inequality, we have\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{cr}_H \\geq e_H - 3n_H.</math>\n\nTaking [[expected value|expectation]]s we obtain\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{E}[\\operatorname{cr}_H] \\geq \\mathbf{E}[e_H] - 3 \\mathbf{E}[n_H].</math>\n\nSince each of the {{mvar|n}} vertices in {{mvar|G}} had a probability {{mvar|p}} of being in {{mvar|H}}, we have {{math|'''E'''[''n<sub>H</sub>''] {{=}} ''pn''}}. Similarly, each of the edges in {{mvar|G}} has a probability {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup>}} of remaining in {{mvar|H}} since both endpoints need to stay in {{mvar|H}}, therefore {{math|'''E'''[''e<sub>H</sub>''] {{=}} ''p''<sup>2</sup>''e''}}. Finally, every crossing in the diagram of {{mvar|G}} has a probability {{math|''p''<sup>4</sup>}} of remaining in {{mvar|H}}, since every crossing involves four vertices. To see this consider a diagram of {{mvar|G}} with {{math|cr(''G'')}} crossings. We may assume that any two edges in this diagram with a common vertex are disjoint, otherwise we could interchange the intersecting parts of the two edges and reduce the crossing number by one. Thus every crossing in this diagram involves four distinct vertices of {{mvar|G}}. Therefore, {{math|'''E'''[cr<sub>''H''</sub>] {{=}} ''p''<sup>4</sup>cr(''G'')}} and we have\n\n: <math> p^4 \\operatorname{cr}(G) \\geq p^2 e - 3 p n.</math>\n\nNow if we set {{math|''p'' {{=}} 4''n''/''e'' < 1}} (since we assumed that {{math|''e'' > 4''n''}}), we obtain after some algebra\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{cr}(G) \\geq \\frac{e^3}{64 n^2}.</math>\n\nA slight refinement of this argument allows one to replace {{math|64}} by {{math|33.75}} for {{math|''e'' > 7.5''n''}}.<ref name=\"pt\"/>\n\n==Variations==\nFor graphs with [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] larger than {{math|2''r''}} and {{math|''e'' ≥ 4''n''}}, {{harvtxt|Pach|Spencer|Tóth|2000}} demonstrated an improvement of this inequality to<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Pach | first1 = J. | author1-link = János Pach\n | last2 = Spencer | first2 = J. | author2-link = Joel Spencer\n | last3 = Tóth | first3 = G.\n | doi = 10.1145/304893.304943\n | issue = 4\n | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]\n | mr = 1799605\n | pages = 623–644\n | title = New bounds on crossing numbers\n | volume = 24\n | year = 2000}}.</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{cr}(G) \\geq c_r\\frac{e^{r+2}}{n^{r+1}}.</math>\n[[Karim Adiprasito|Adiprasito]] showed a generalization to higher dimensions<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Adiprasito|first=Karim|date=2018-12-26|title=Combinatorial Lefschetz theorems beyond positivity|url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.10454v3|language=en}}</ref>: If <math>\\Delta</math>is a simplicial complex that is mapped piecewise-linearly to <math>\\mathbf{R}^{2d}</math>, and it has <math>f_d(\\Delta)\\ \\ d\n</math>-dimensional faces and <math>f_{d-1}(\\Delta)\\ \\ (d-1)\n</math>-dimensional faces such that <math>f_d(\\Delta)> (d+3)f_{d-1}(\\Delta)\n</math>, then the number of pairwise intersecting <math>d</math>-dimensional faces is at least \n\n<math>\\frac{f_d^{d+2}(\\Delta)}{(d+3)^{d+2}f_{d-1}^{d+1}(\\Delta)}.</math> \n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Topological graph theory]]\n[[Category:Inequalities]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:Graph drawing]]"
