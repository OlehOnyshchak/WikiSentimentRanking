The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends – statics and dynamics – turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics.

He studied [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and other religions. He treated religions objectively, striving to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. \"What al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another.\"{{sfn|Rosenthal|1976|p=10}}\n\nAl-Biruni divides [[Hindus]] into an educated and an uneducated class. He describes the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing all forms of idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshiped a multiplicity of idols yet points out that even some Muslims (such as the Jabiriyya) have adopted [[anthropomorphic]] concepts of God.{{sfn|Ataman|2005}}\n\n== Anthropology ==\n\nAl-Biruni wrote about the peoples, customs and religions of the Indian subcontinent.\nAccording to Akbar S.

Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which—claimed Al-Biruni—contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.<ref>{{Cite book | last= Bīrūnī |first=Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad | date = 1910 | title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030 | chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them | volume = 1 |page = 17 | publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner | place = London | url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/ | accessdate =  | postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}</ref> He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nOne of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar.

He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian.

The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Mohammad Yasin compares it to \"a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers & Distri|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}</ref>\nBiruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times.

The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]\nTwo major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.</ref> Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that \"from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point\".<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.</ref> This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}.\"/>  He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye, only the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued, using a physical analogy, that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays: in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}</ref> He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.<ref>{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}</ref>\n\nHis arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}</ref> His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76–78}}</ref> However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe. Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\">{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.</ref> [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.</ref> His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.<ref>{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', but Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of science and technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: \"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.\"</ref> and early analysis<ref>{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: \"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.\"</ref> of the device.\n\nAlhazen utilized his species of [[camera obscura]] to observe the eclipse. In his essay \"On the Form of the Eclipse\" he writes that he observed the sickle-like shape of the sun at the time of an eclipse. The introduction to his essay reads as follows: The image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moonsickle. His findings solidified the importance in the history of the [[Camera obscura|camera obscura]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of Photography|last=Eder|first=Josef|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1945|isbn=|location=New York|pages=37}}</ref>\n\nAlhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.<ref>{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.</ref> Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], with whom Alhazen was extremely familiar. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}</ref> In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.</ref> In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune<ref>{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.</ref> and Sabra,<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.</ref> Raynaud<ref>{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.</ref> showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.\n\n[[File:Alhazen1652.png|left|thumb|upright|The structure of the [[human eye]] according to Ibn al-Haytham.

It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, \"Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.\" This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].<ref>\n{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.</ref> This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].<ref>{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165–9 &amp; 173–4}}.</ref> Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof.

For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.</ref> He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.<ref>{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=}}.</ref>\n\nSudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of [[experimental psychology]], for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{harvnb|Khaleefa|1999}}</ref> Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the \"founder of [[psychophysics]]\", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.<ref>{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}.</ref>\n\nAlhazen offered an explanation of the [[Moon illusion]], an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|Plug|2002}}.</ref> Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9–10}}.</ref> Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135–50 BC).<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|2000}}.</ref> Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.<ref>{{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}.</ref> Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.\n\n== Other works on physics ==\n\n=== Optical treatises ===\n\nBesides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw’'' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.</ref>\n\n=== Celestial physics ===\nAlhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] \"greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West\". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses \"were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]\", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.<ref>{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.</ref>\n\nHe also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').\n\n=== Mechanics ===\n\nIn his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}.\"/> In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\">{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Astronomy}}<!-- -Anchor for a wikilink in Celestial Spheres article.

It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61</ref>}}\n\nThe book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]<ref name=\"{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}.\">{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.</ref> during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34–41}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.</ref>\n\n=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===\n\nIn his ''Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\">{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.</ref> He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:<ref>{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8–10}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}</ref>}}\n\nHaving pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a \"true configuration\" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}.\"/> In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:\n\n{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...<ref name=\"{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}.\"/>}}\n\nHe held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.\n\n=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===\n\nAlhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.</ref>\n\n=== Other astronomical works ===\n\nAlhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.<ref>{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49–50}}</ref> The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.<ref>{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}.</ref>\n\n== Mathematical works ==\n[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]\nIn [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on \"the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395–6}}:\n{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. ...

His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].<ref name=\"{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}.\"/>\n\n=== Calculus ===\nAlhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163–174 |year=1995 }} [165–9, 173–4]</ref>\n\n== Other works ==\n\n=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===\n\nAlhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived.

He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.<ref>{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459.</ref>\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n\nIn his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\"/> [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place'') for its geometrization of place.<ref name=\"{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}.\"/>\n\nAlhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. In \"tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision.

Al-Rudānī wrote a book describing it,  ''Al Nāfia fī amal al jāmia'' (Medina, 1662).

He worked as ''muwaqqit'' (موقت, religious timekeeper) in the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]] and constructed a [[sundial]] for its [[minaret]] in 1371/72.\n\n==Astronomy==\nIbn al-Shatir most important astronomical treatise was ''kitab nihayat al-sul fi tashih al-usul'' (\"The Final Quest Concerning the Rectification of Principles\"). In it he drastically reformed the [[Geocentric model#Claudius Ptolemy|Ptolemaic models]] of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[planets]]. His model incorporated the [[Urdi lemma]], and eliminated the need for an [[equant]] by introducing an extra epicycle (the [[Tusi-couple]]), departing from the Ptolemaic system in a way that was mathematically identical to what [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] did in the 16th century. \n\nUnlike previous astronomers before him, Ibn al-Shatir was not concerned with adhering to the theoretical principles of [[natural philosophy]] or Aristotelian [[cosmology]], but rather to produce a model that was more consistent with [[empirical]] observations. For example, it was Ibn al-Shatir's concern for observational accuracy which led him to eliminate the epicycle in the Ptolemaic [[Sun|solar]] model and all the eccentrics, epicycles and equant in the Ptolemaic [[Moon|lunar]] model. His model was thus in better agreement with empirical [[observation]]s than any previous model,<ref name=Saliba-1994>{{Harv|Saliba|1994b|pp=233–234 & 240}}</ref> and was also the first that permitted empirical [[Experiment|testing]].<ref>Y. M. Faruqi (2006). \"Contributions of Islamic scholars to the scientific enterprise\", ''International Education Journal'' '''7''' (4): 395-396.</ref> His work thus marked a turning point in astronomy, which may be considered a \"Scientific Revolution before the Renaissance\".<ref name=Saliba-1994/> \n\n[[Image:Shatir500.jpg|thumb|right|Ibn al-Shatir's model for the appearances of Mercury, showing the multiplication of epicycles in a Ptolemaic enterprise]]\n\nDrawing on the observation that the distance to the Moon did not change as drastically as required by Ptolemy's lunar model, Ibn al-Shatir produced a new lunar model that replaced Ptolemy's crank mechanism with a double epicycle model that reduced the computed range of distances of the Moon from the Earth.<ref>[[#refHAMA1975|Neugebauer (1975)]], volume&nbsp;3 at pages&nbsp;1108-1109.</ref> This was the first accurate lunar model which matched physical observations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=T.

Ibn al-Shatir was aware that \"using a [[gnomon]] that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year.\" His sundial is the oldest polar-axis sundial still in existence.

His model for the planetary system is believed to be the most advanced of his time, and was used extensively until the development of the heliocentric model in the time of [[Nicolaus Copernicus]].

Wickens). London: Allen & Unwin, p.&nbsp;45.</ref> The animals \"which reach the stage of perfection [...] are distinguished by fully developed weapons\", such as antlers, horns, teeth, and claws. Tusi described these organs as adaptations to each species's lifestyle, in a way anticipating [[natural theology]]. He continued:\n\n{{quote|\"The noblest of the species is that one whose sagacity and perception is such that it accepts discipline and instruction: thus there accrues to it the perfection not originally created in it. Such are the schooled horse and the trained falcon. The greater this faculty grows in it, the more surpassing its rank, until a point is reached where the (mere) observation of action suffices as instruction: thus, when they see a thing, they perform the like of it by mimicry, without training [...].

He was born in [[Egypt]] between 950 and 952 and came from a respected family in [[Fostat|Fustat]]. His father was a historian, biographer, and scholar of [[hadith]], who wrote two volumes about the history of Egypt—one about the [[Egyptians]] and one based on traveller commentary on Egypt.<ref>Eternal Egypt.

James Piscatori. ''Muslim Travellers: Pilgrimage, Migration, and the Religious Imagination''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1990. p. 58</ref> His great-grandfather had been an associate of the noted legal scholar [[Imam Shafi]].\n\nEarly in the life of Ibn Yunus, the [[Fatimid]] [[dynasty]] came to power and the new city of [[Cairo]] was founded. In Cairo, he worked as an astronomer for the Fatimid dynasty for twenty-six years, first for the [[Caliph]] [[al-Aziz]] and then for [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]]. Ibn Yunus dedicated his most famous astronomical work, ''al-Zij al-Kabir al-Hakimi'', to the latter.\n\nAs well as for his mathematics, Ibn Yunus was also known as an eccentric and a poet.<ref>{{citation|title=Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam|first=J.

According to N. M. Swerdlow, the ''Zij al-Kabir al-Hakimi'' is \"a work of outstanding originality of which just over half survives\".<ref>N. M. Swerdlow (1993), \"Montucla's Legacy: The History of the Exact Sciences\", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''54''' (2): 299-328 [320].</ref>\n\nYunus expressed the solutions in his ''zij'' without mathematical symbols,<ref>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830904759.html Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography], 2008</ref> but [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Delambre|Delambre]] noted in his 1819 translation of the Hakemite tables that two of Ibn Yunus' methods for determining the time from solar or stellar altitude were equivalent to the [[trigonometric identity]] <math>2\\cos(a)\\cos(b) = \\cos(a+b)+\\cos(a-b)</math><ref>David A. King, '[http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1978JHA.....9..212K&db_key=AST&page_ind=6&plate_select=NO&data_type=GIF&type=SCREEN_GIF&classic=YES Islamic Math and Science]', Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 9, p.212</ref> identified in [[Johannes Werner]]'s 16th-century manuscript on conic sections.  Now recognized as one of Werner's formulas, it was essential for the development of [[prosthaphaeresis]] and [[logarithms]] decades later.\n\nIbn Yunus described 40 [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|planetary conjunctions]] and 30 [[lunar eclipse]]s. For example, he accurately describes the planetary conjunction that occurred in the year 1000 as follows:\n:A conjunction of Venus and Mercury in Gemini, observed in the western sky: The two planets were in conjunction after sunset on the night [of Sunday 19 May 1000]. The time was approximately eight equinoctial hours after midday on Sunday ... . Mercury was north of Venus and their latitude difference was a third of a degree.<ref name=MacTutor>{{MacTutor|id=Yunus|title=Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn Abd al-Rahman ibn Yunus}}</ref>\n\nModern knowledge of the positions of the planets confirms that his description and his calculation of the distance being one-third of a degree is exactly correct. Ibn Yunus's observations on conjunctions and [[eclipse]]s were used in [[Richard Dunthorne]] and [[Simon Newcomb]]s' respective calculations of the secular acceleration of the [[moon]].<ref name=MacTutor/><ref>Raymond Mercer (1994), 'English Orientalists and Mathematical Astronomy' in ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in 17th-Century England'', p.198</ref>\n\n===Pendulum===\nRecent encyclopaedias<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = Good\n  | first = Gregory\n  | title = Sciences of the Earth: An Encyclopedia of Events, People, and Phenomena\n  | publisher = [[Routledge]]\n  | date = 1998\n  | location =\n  | pages = 394\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vdqXVddh0hUC&printsec=frontcover\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 978-0-8153-0062-5}}<br/>{{cite encyclopedia\n  | title = Pendulum\n  | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Americana\n  | volume = 21\n  | pages = 502\n  | publisher = The Americana Corp.\n  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=icRWAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22Ibn+Yunis%22+pendulum\n  | date = 1967\n  | accessdate = 2009-02-20}}<br/>{{cite book\n  | last = Baker\n  | first = Cyril Clarence Thomas\n  | title = Dictionary of Mathematics\n  | publisher = G.

These pieces are among the last works completed by the sculptor [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]]. The artist died in a car accident on May 23, 1965, soon after the completion of ''Cubi XXVIII'', which may or may not have been the last sculpture he intended to create in this series. The ''Cubis'' are among Smith's final experiments in his progression toward a more simplified, abstract form of expression. As an example of [[Modernism]], these are representative of the monumental works in industrial materials that characterized much of the sculpture from this period.  \n\nAlthough the ''Cubis'' are abstract works composed of geometric shapes, they are ambiguously figural. For example, the pictured ''Cubi VI'' appears to be standing on a pair of crossed legs. Like many of the [[Abstract Expressionists]], Smith possessed the ability to easily switch between an abstract and figurative style of working. His process also involved going back and forth between the different stages of development within a certain style or serial group, as suggested by the ''Cubis''. These sculptures were not completed in the order in which they are numbered, as revealed by the inscriptions (see below) that Smith welded onto the base of each.<ref name=\"krauss\">Rosalind E. Krauss, ''The Sculpture of David Smith: A Catalogue Raisonne'', 1977.</ref>\n\nToday, the majority of the ''Cubi'' works are part of well-known museum collections around the world, including the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York, the [[Tate Modern]] in London and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. In 2005, ''Cubi XXVIII'' was sold at [[Sotheby's]] for $23.8 million, breaking a record for the most expensive piece of contemporary art ever sold at auction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artdaily.com/news/15463/David-Smith-s-CUBI-XXVIII-Sells-for--23-8-Million#.W7D8mi9aZQI|title=David Smith's CUBI XXVIII Sells for $23.8 Million|last=|first=|date=|website=Artdaily.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> \"This exceedingly rare work was the pinnacle of a four-decade career,\" said [[Tobias Meyer]], Sotheby's worldwide head of contemporary art and the auctioneer for the evening.\n\n{{Div col}}\n* ''Cubi I''  March 4, 1963 \n* ''Cubi II''  October 25, 1962\n* ''Cubi III''  November 10, 1961 \n* ''Cubi IV'' January 17, 1963\n* ''Cubi V'' January 16, 1963\n* ''Cubi VI'' March 21, 1963\n* ''[[Cubi VII]]'' March 28, 1963\n* ''Cubi VIII'' December 24, 1962\n* ''Cubi IX'' October 26, 1961\n* ''Cubi X'' April 4,1963\n* ''[[Cubi XI]]'' March 30, 1963\n* ''[[Cubi XII]]'' April 7, 1963\n* ''Cubi XIII'' March 25, 1963\n* ''Cubi XIV'' September 25, 1963\n* ''[[Cubi XV]]'' September 27, 1963\n* ''Cubi XVI'' November 4, 1963\n* ''Cubi XVII'' December 4, 1963\n* ''Cubi XVIII'' February 14, 1964\n* ''Cubi XIX'' February 20, 1964\n* ''Cubi XX'' February 20, 1964\n* ''Cubi XXI'' April 4, 1964\n* ''Cubi XXII'' June 5, 191964\n* ''Cubi XXIII'' November 30, 1964\n* ''Cubi XXIV'' December 8, 1964\n* ''Cubi XXV'' January 9, 1965\n* ''[[Cubi XXVI]]'' January 12, 1965\n* ''Cubi XXVII'' March 5, 1965\n* ''Cubi XXVIII'' May 5, 1965\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*Carmean, E.

It first appeared in the [[Marvel Universe]] in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #79 (July 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].\n\nIn the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], the Cosmic Cube (renamed the '''Tesseract''') contains the Space Stone, one of the fictional universe's [[Infinity Stones]].\n\n==Publication history==\nThe first Cosmic Cube appeared in a story in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #79–81 (July–Sept. 1966) and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. It was established as a device created by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] and capable of transforming any wish into reality, irrespective of the consequences. The Cube was also a plot device in a story that introduced the character of the [[Super-Adaptoid]] in ''Tales of Suspense'' #82–84 (Oct.–Dec. 1966).  The Cube was also featured in a one-off story in the ''Avengers'' #40 (1967) being found and briefly wielded by [[Namor]].\n\nThe Cube reappeared in ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' #115–120 (July–Dec. 1969), and featured in an epic cosmic storyline that starred arch-villain [[Thanos]] in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #107 (Jan. 1974) and ''[[Captain Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Captain Marvel]]'' #25–33 (March 1972–July 1974: bi-monthly). Retrieved after Thanos' defeat, this original Cube featured in several [[Project Pegasus]] stories in ''[[Marvel Two-in-One]]'' #42–43 (Aug.–Sept. 1978), ''Marvel Two-in-One'' #57–58 (Dec. 1979–Jan. 1980), and ''Marvel Team-Up Annual'' #5 (1982).\n\nThe creation of a second Cube was shown in ''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #16–17 (May 1979, June 1980) but this Cube was initially powerless and did not gain any reality-altering ability until years after its creation.\n\nA major element was added to the Cube's origin—that each is in fact an evolving sentient being—in ''Captain America Annual'' #7 (1983). The sentient Cube returned in ''Avengers'' #289–290 (March–April 1988) to end the threat of the [[Super-Adaptoid]] (itself originally empowered by a \"shard\" of a Cosmic Cube), and then in ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319 (Oct. 1988). This story revealed that the villain [[Molecule Man]] had ties to the Cube and introduced a new character.\n\nThe [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''[[The Infinity War]]'' #1–6 (June–Nov. 1992) and ''[[Infinity Crusade]]'' #1–6 (June–Nov. 1993) established that the items actually exist in a variety of [[geometric]] forms called Cosmic Containment Units.\n\nA third Cosmic Cube was created during the \"Taking A.I.M.\" storyline that ran through ''Avengers'' vol. 1, #386–388 (May–July 1995) and ''Captain America'' vol. 2, #440–441 (June–July 1995). This unstable Cube has not been seen since it was sealed in a containment chamber at the conclusion of the storyline.\n\nThe previously powerless second Cosmic Cube finally gained an ability to alter reality in ''Captain America'' vol. 2, #445–448 (November, 1995–February, 1996) but it was unstable and exploded at the end of that storyline. The second Cube's power reappeared in a storyline in ''Captain America'' vol. 3, #14–19 (Feb.–July 1999) during which its power was internalized within the Red Skull and then stolen by Korvac and taken to an alternate 31st Century Earth before being returned to the Red Skull on present-day Earth after which it was seemingly destroyed again by exposure to anti-matter energy.\n\n[[Doctor Doom]] acquires the Cosmic Cube in the [[Fantastic Four]] limited-series ''The World's Greatest Comics Magazine'' (2001). Doom uses a time machine to get the Cube from the ocean floor into which it had dropped during a battle between the [[Red Skull]] and [[Captain America]].\n\nA Cube—together with 11 other items from Marvel and [[DC Comics]] continuity—was used once again as a plot device in [[intercompany crossover]] series ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #1–4 (Sept. 2003–April 2004: bi-monthly).\n\nThe Cube also shows up in ''[[Captain America]]'' vol. 5. [[Aleksander Lukin]] wants the Cube and is willing to trade the Red Skull for it. The Red Skull claims he does not have it, but has spies out looking for it. Five years later, the Skull is in [[New York City]] and is in possession of it. General Lukin sent the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]] to retrieve the Cube from the Skull, and to kill him. The Skull transfers his mind into the body of Lukin through the powers of the Cube.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 6, #1–2</ref>\n\nA fragment of a Cube empowered a new character that featured in a single storyline in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' vol. 3, #20–24 (July–Nov. 2006), and a Cube also appeared in ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' vol. 2, #19 (Dec. 2009). The item added a new aspect to the abilities of character the [[Absorbing Man]] in ''[[The Mighty Avengers]]'' #32–33 (Feb.–March 2010). A new Cosmic Cube was revealed in ''[[Avengers Assemble (comics)|Avengers Assemble]]'' #5 (July 2012); it was revealed to be a working facsimile with more limited powers than the 'real thing'.{{issue|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Fictional item history==\nThe Cosmic Cubes are actually containment devices created by various civilizations throughout the Marvel Universe at various times. Examples including the [[Skrull]]s (creators of the Cube that would eventually evolve into the [[Shaper of Worlds]]), and various other, unnamed civilizations (whose Cubes were gathered/stolen by unknown means by [[Magus (comics)|The Magus]] in the \"[[The Infinity War|Infinity War]]\" story arc and [[Goddess (comics)|The Goddess]] in the \"[[Infinity Crusade]]\" story arc). These matrices—which may or may not actually be shaped like a Cube—are suffused with reality-warping energies of unknown composition that comes from the realm of the [[Beyonders]].\n\nUnknown to almost everyone in the Marvel Universe, including its creators, the nature of the mysterious energies are such that, after a sufficient but undefined period of time, the matrix will become self-aware and evolve into an independent, free-willed being still possessed of the original Cube's tremendous powers; the new being's overall personality is psychically imprinted with the beliefs, desires, and personalities of those who wielded it as a Cube (for example, the Shaper of Worlds, wielded for a long time by an insane and warlike Skrull Emperor, immediately destroyed a large portion of the galaxy that it was located in once it became sentient).\n\nOn Earth, the Cosmic Cube containment matrix was developed and created by a society of para-military scientists known as [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] to further their ultimate goal of world conquest. The object is revealed to be so powerful that it drove to insanity its co-creator [[MODOK]]. Master villain and former [[Nazi]] [[Red Skull]] obtains the device after taking control of the mind of the A.I.M. agent holding it using a handheld device. Although apparently now all-powerful, the Skull became overconfident and was tricked and defeated by hero [[Captain America]], who pretended to surrender and ask to be the Skull's slave, then knocked the Cube away, causing it to fall into the ocean.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #79–81 (July–Sept. 1966)</ref> It was found by Prince Namor after [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] accidentally revealed it to him, but while battling the Avengers he lost contact with it, and it fell into the Earth. [[Mole Man]] found it, but threw it away not realizing its true value.<ref>''Avengers'' vol.1, #40 (May, 1967)</ref> Later a shard of the Cube is also used by A.I.M. to power the [[Android (robot)|android]] known as the [[Super-Adaptoid]], who is sent in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Captain America.<ref>''Tales of Suspense'' #82–84 (Oct.–Dec. 1966)</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull eventually retrieves the Cube and toys with Captain America, but Red Skull is defeated when A.I.M. uses an object called the \"Catholite Block\" to dissolve the Cube.<ref>''Captain America'' #115–120 (July–Dec. 1969)</ref>\n\nThe Cube was eventually found (apparently having reformed) by [[Thanos]]<ref>''Daredevil'' #107 (Jan. 1974); ''Captain Marvel'' #28 (Sept. 1973)</ref> who, like the Red Skull, wishes to control the universe (this also attracts the amorous attention of the entity [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]]). Although opposed by superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the alien [[Kree]] warrior [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Mar-Vell]], Thanos becomes supreme when he wills the Cube to make him a part of—and therefore in control of—everything. Thanos discards the Cube, believing it to be drained of power, and is then stripped of the power by the dying superhero named [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Mar-Vell]], who shatters the Cube and restores the universe.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' #25–33 (bi-monthly: March 1972–July 1974)</ref>\n\nBrought to research installation [[Project Pegasus|Project: Pegasus]], the Cube was stolen by villain and [[cult]] leader [[Victorius (comics)|Victorius]], and is used to create the being Jude the Entropic Man. Both are neutralized when in simultaneous contact with the Cube (and the creature the [[Man Thing]]).<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #42–43 (Aug.–Sept. 1978)</ref> The Cube is returned to Pegasus by Captain America and the [[Fantastic Four]] member the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] where it eventually transforms the alien [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Wundarr]] into the entity the Aquarian.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #57–58 (Dec. 1979–Jan. 1980)</ref>\n\nA second Cube was created on the Island of Exiles by a team of scientists (including [[Arnim Zola]]) working for the Red Skull and the Hate-Monger. Planning to transfer his consciousness into the completed Cube, the Hate-Monger secretly arranged for a distraction in the form of a strike team from the spy organization [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] attacking the island in an attempt to retrieve the Cube. However, the Red Skull was aware of his plans and had kept secret the fact that the Cube project had succeeded only in creating a perfect prison but had failed to capture the mysterious, omnidimensional x-element which gives the Cubes their reality-warping power. As a result, the Hate-Monger's mind was left trapped in a powerless Cube in the Red Skull's possession.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #16–17 (May 1979, June 1980)</ref> This Cube was one of the trophies that the Red Skull kept in his home, Skull House.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 2, #299 (November, 1984)</ref>\n\nDuring a battle to stop A.I.M. from using the Cube once again, Captain America witnesses the Cube evolve into the entity called [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]], which becomes a student of the Shaper of Worlds.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #7 (1983)</ref> Kubik returns to Earth when attracted by an [[wikt:anomaly|anomaly]] possessing a fraction of its power, revealed to be the [[robot]] the [[Super-Adaptoid]]. The Super-Adaptoid uses its abilities to \"copy\" Kubik's abilities and banishes the entity, intent on creating a race in its own image. The Adaptoid, however, is tricked into shutting down by Captain America. Kubik returns and then removes the sliver of the original Cosmic Cube from the Adaptoid that gave the robot its abilities.<ref>''Avengers'' #289–290 (March–April 1988)</ref>\n\nKubik also battles the renegade entity the [[Beyonder]], and reveals to the entity and former Fantastic Four villain the [[Molecule Man]] that they are in fact both parts of an incomplete Cube (officially [[retcon|ret-conning]] the Beyonder's powers as shown in ''[[Secret Wars]]'' in the process), and convinces them to merge their powers. This forms a new being called [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]], who becomes the pupil of Kubik.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319 (Oct. 1988)</ref>\n\nThe character the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]]—an evil version of anti-hero [[Adam Warlock]]—acquires five Cosmic Cubes from neighboring universes, with each appearing in a different geometric form. The Magus uses mechanical aids to manipulate the Cubes, as their combined presence would quickly cause permanent [[brain damage]]. The character uses the Cubes to create an evil [[doppelganger]] of almost all of the Marvel heroes and then alters the universe, but is tricked and defeated when acquiring the [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]], as the Reality Gem is revealed to be a fake, thus creating a gap in his powers.<ref>''Infinity War'' #1–6 (June–Nov. 1992)</ref>\n\nAlthough the Magus is defeated, Warlock's \"good side\"—the female [[Goddess (comics)|Goddess]]—also appears and wishes to purge the universe of all evil. To do this the character collects 30 containment units, with each storing the power of a Cosmic Cube, and merges them into a \"Cosmic Egg\". Despite the fact that the Egg can fulfill the Goddess' wishes—although, unlike the Infinity Gauntlet, it has no power over the Soul—the character is defeated by Warlock and Thanos. During this time the two questioned [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] about the origins of the Cubes in exchange for giving a Cube to Mephisto, but they were able to cheat the deal by giving Mephisto a drained Cube as he never specified that the Cube had to still be functional.<ref>''Infinity Crusade'' #1–6 (June–Nov. 1993)</ref>\n\nA third Cosmic Cube was created by an Adaptoid-controlled faction of A.I.M. based on the island of Boca Caliente. This Cube was unstable and its reality-warping ability began to leak out onto the surrounding island, creating Cube constructs of anybody that was in the thoughts of nearby people. An Avengers team attempted to stop the Cube and the dying Captain America was willing to sacrifice himself to do so. In the end it was an Adaptoid who had been accompanying Captain America and had been impressed by his heroic nature who ended the threat by willingly transforming itself into a non-sentient containment chamber for the Cube's energies.<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1, #386–388 (May–July 1995) and ''Captain America'' vol. 2, #440–441 (June–July 1995)</ref>\n\nThe second Cube was eventually recovered by the KubeKult, fanatical followers of the Hate-Monger, who spied upon the A.I.M. Adaptoids and discovered how to power it. Fearing how the Hate-Monger would punish him for his betrayal, the Red Skull allied himself with then-rogue S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter to kidnap the dying Captain America and restore him to health. Reluctantly working together, the trio invaded a KubeKult base to steal the erratically functioning Cube but the Red Skull seized it and willed Captain America to be drawn inside it into an artificial reality during World War II, where Captain America and [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] were on a mission to kill Hitler. The Red Skull believed that he would be able to wield the Cube's power only if Captain America killed Hitler's consciousness within the Cube. However, the Bucky within the Cube (actually a projection of Cap's own mind) revealed what was really going on and Captain America was able to will himself out of the Cube. Appearing before the Skull, Captain America threw his shield in such a way that it first severed the Skull's arm, causing him to drop the Cube, and then struck and shattered the Cube itself, causing an explosion that seemingly destroyed both itself and the Red Skull.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 2, #445–448 (November 1995–February 1996)</ref>\n\nMonths later, the Red Skull reappears, now with the Cube's power internalized within his body. He was approached by the time-traveller [[Kang the Conqueror|Kang]] (actually the disguised [[Cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entity]] [[Korvac]]) who told him that the reason he had failed to completely control the Cube's power in the past was because his knowledge of the universe was incomplete. At the suggestion of \"Kang\", the Skull willed the starship of [[Galactus]] to travel to Earth so he could drain it of the needed information. At the same time, Korvac (now disguised as [[Uatu the Watcher]]) appeared to Captain America and Sharon Carter and managed to convince them that the only way to prevent the Skull from becoming unstoppable was for Captain America to kill him during a brief moment of vulnerability. Captain America did so but as the Skull died his body released the Cube energy which flowed into \"Uatu\" who revealed his true identity and used his increased power to return to his alternate 31st Century Earth to conquer it. However, Captain America followed him and fought him repeatedly, with Korvac rebooting the 31st Century reality each time Captain America disturbed his perfectly ordered machine world. Eventually, Captain America managed to convince Korvac that the reason he was able to achieve anything at all against Korvac was due there being too much humanity left within Korvac when he acquired the Cube power. Accordingly, Korvac transported himself and Captain America back to just before the Skull died but this time Captain America did not strike the fatal blow. Vulnerable to the Skull's power, Korvac teleported himself, Captain America and Carter aboard the starship but the Skull soon found him and scattered Korvac across six dimensions. Soon afterwards, the Skull was tricked by Captain America into entering an anti-matter energy beam within the starship's engine room which separated the Cube energy from him. Before the energy dissipated, Captain America and the Skull were each able to use its wish-granting ability to save themselves and Carter from death.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 3, #14–19 (Feb.–July 1999)</ref>\n\nA Cosmic Cube was one of the twelve items of power sought by superhero teams the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] when they competed against each other in a game organized by entities [[Krona (comics)|Krona]] and the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]]. It was the final item of the quest, found in the [[Savage Land]], where both teams converged for a full-scale fight during which [[Green Lantern]] [[Kyle Rayner]] was able to use the Cube as a substitute power source for his [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]] when his usual battery had been stolen and the ring was running out of power. [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] was finally able to gain the Cube, bringing the game to a stalemate, but to make sure Krona lost, Captain America helped [[Batman]] to take it, because they were the only ones, aside from the [[Atom (comics)|Atom]], who knew the true stakes of the game: Krona had forced the Grandmaster to take the Justice League as his representatives, so the League had to win in order to prevent Krona from destroying the Marvel Universe. Batman briefly attempted to use the Cube to end the game — having been filled in on its capabilities by Captain America — before Grandmaster took it from him to tally up the score. Enraged at his loss, Krona attacked the Grandmaster, who then used the Cube along with all other items of power to temporarily fuse the Marvel and DC Universes and imprison Krona in the intersection, hoping he would be unable to destroy an universe if his own existence were linked to it.<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #2 and 3 (Nov. 2003, Feb. 2004)</ref>\n\nThe Red Skull has finally created one by using pieces of the previous Cubes, and Aleksander Lukin wants it as much. The Red Skull is assassinated by the one person that Lukin was willing to trade for the Cube—the [[Bucky Barnes|Winter Soldier]]. In the process of being assassinated, the Skull uses the Cube's power to transfer his mind into the body of Lukin for some time.<ref>''Captain America'' vol. 5</ref>\n\nA youth called Curtis Doyle becomes the hero [[Freedom Ring]] when he finds a fragment of the original Cube in the form of a ring, which allows the altering of reality in a very limited area of 15 feet around the wearer. The character dies in battle saving Captain America, Spider-Man, [[Spider-Woman]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] from the villain [[Alternative versions of Iron Man#Iron Maniac|Iron Maniac]]. The ring is later found by a friend of Doyle, a Skrull who had settled on Earth and adopts the name 'Crusader'.<ref>''Marvel Team-Up'' vol. 3, #20–24 (July–Nov. 2006)</ref>\n\nThe powerful entity [[D'Spayre]] attempted to enhance his power by using a Cosmic Cube to draw on the grief of the general public in the aftermath of [[Captain America]]'s assassination,<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #7</ref> only for his use of the Cube to have an apparently unintended side-effect when it granted the 'wish' of those who wanted Captain America back by drawing the [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]] into the present. He was defeated in a confrontation with the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] when [[Echo (Marvel Comics)|Echo]] proved immune to his powers due to her [[Hearing impairment|deafness]], allowing her to take the Cube from him. The Cube is then used by Paul Anslem, a World War II soldier who had traveled with the Invaders against his will. Anslem's intentions to save his friends, who had died during an assault on a Nazi stronghold, allows the Red Skull of the World War II era to gain enough power to take over Earth. Anslem again regains control of the Cube with super-powered assistance and restores the timeline to what it should have been.<ref>''Avengers/Invaders'' #1-12 (2009)</ref>\n\nA Cube is also given to [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] member [[Star-Lord]] by time-traveling villain [[Kang the Conqueror]] to use against [[Adam Warlock]]'s evil [[alter ego]], the [[Magus (comics)|Magus]].<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #19 (Dec. 2009)</ref>  However, Magus altered perception to make it seem like the Cube's power was used up. Star-Lord used the Cube's last bit of energy for real by subduing the reborn Thanos, rendering it a \"cosmic paperweight\".<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' vol. 2, #25</ref>\n\n[[Absorbing Man]] becomes capable of assimilating the abilities of a fraction of a Cube. He is stopped by criminal mastermind [[Norman Osborn]], who uses a [[magical sword]] (provided by the [[Asgardian (comics)|Asgardian]] god [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]) to neutralize the Absorbing Man's abilities.<ref>''Mighty Avengers'' #32–33 (Feb.–March 2010)</ref>\n\nA new Cosmic Cube is later revealed to have been created by the U.S. government. It is stolen by members of the [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]] at the behest of Thanos.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' #5-6</ref> Thanos' plot is later foiled by the combined might of the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy.<ref>''Avengers Assemble'' #7-8</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[Avengers: Standoff!]]'' storyline, [[Maria Hill]] and the rest of S.H.I.E.L.D. used pieces of a Cosmic Cube to create '''[[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]]''', a near-[[omnipotent]] child. With Kobik's help, S.H.I.E.L.D. began brainwashing supervillains into becoming mild-mannered civilians who were then imprisoned in a [[gated community]] called Pleasant Hill.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill'' #1</ref><ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1</ref> When the villains rebel, Kobik decides to bring Steve Rogers, then reduced to an old man due to the breakdown of his Super-Soldier serum, back to his physical peak, but due to the Red Skull's influence over the Cube from which Kobik was made, she unknowingly replaces Rogers with a covert HYDRA loyalist version of him, believing that to be the \"right\" version of him. This results in the real Rogers' consciousness becoming trapped within the Cube until he finds Kobik and encourages her to set things right by showing the atrocities his doppelgänger had committed in the name of HYDRA during the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline; she then brings him back to the real world, with some help from the heroes outside.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #10</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n===Ultimate Marvel===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] title ''[[Ultimate Fantastic Four]]'', [[Mister Fantastic]] builds a \"cuboid volitional lattice\" courtesy of a deliberate, subconscious suggestion from the Ultimate version of the Titan [[Thanos]].<ref>''Ultimate Fantastic Four'' #42 (May 2007)</ref> Another version of the Cube exists as a creation of [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] under the employment of [[Red Skull]], which they stole blueprints of from the [[Ultimate Fantastic Four|Fantastic Four]]'s [[Ultimatum (Ultimate Marvel)|recently]] abandoned [[Baxter Building]].<ref>''Ultimate Avengers'' #1</ref><ref>''Ultimate Avengers'' #5</ref>\n\nA version of the Cosmic Cube is seen in [[Project Pegasus]] alongside the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] and [[Infinity Gems|Infinity Gauntlet]].<ref>''Ultimate Origins'' #3 (2008)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\nIn ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]'' episode \"Everything is Wonderful\", it is revealed that [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] is creating a Cosmic Cube for [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|HYDRA]]. Later, MODOK reveals that A.I.M. was using the Cosmic Cube project to swindle money out of HYDRA. But when A.I.M. determines that there is a chance that the Cosmic Cube might be an unintended success, they return the money that HYDRA has paid, saying the project was a failure, but they really intend to keep such a all-powerful device to themselves. [[Baron Strucker]] sees through MODOK's deception, and a war for possession of the Cube erupts between A.I.M. and HYDRA in the subsequent episode \"Hail Hydra\" forcing the Avengers to get involved. The clash ends when Captain America and Baron Strucker seize the Cube simultaneously and nothing appears to happen. But unknown to the heroes, the Cosmic Cube actually acts upon Captain America's desires and returns his deceased sidekick [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]] to life.\n\n===Film===\nA version of the Cube can be seen in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], where it is known as the Tesseract.<ref>http://movieline.com/2012/04/30/kevin-feige-on-avengers-marvel-universe-building-and-the-legacy-of-elektra</ref> It is introduced in the mid-credits scene of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', in the custody of Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', it is revealed that the Tesseract was brought to Earth by [[Odin (Marvel Comics)|Odin]] centuries ago. In the film, the [[Red Skull]] finds the Tesseract and uses its power to create weapons for [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] before he is defeated by [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] and the Tesseract is retrieved by [[Howard Stark]]. It is seen again in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', where it is stolen by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] Loki then uses it to create a portal to allow an invading army of [[Chitauri]] to attack the Earth, but they are defeated by the Avengers and the Tesseract is taken back to [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]]. From there, it is briefly mentioned in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' and in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', where it is revealed that the Tesseract contains the Space Stone, one of the six [[Infinity Stones]] that [[Thanos]] wishes to obtain. At the end of ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', Loki steals the Tesseract as the survivors flee Asgard to escape from [[Hela (comics)|Hela]]. At the start of ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', Loki hands the Tesseract over to Thanos so that Thanos will spare Thor's life. Thanos crushes the Cube in his hand, revealing the Space Stone within before placing it in his gauntlet. In the 2019 film ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', set in the year 1995, it is shown that while in [[Project Pegasus|government possession]], [[Mar-Vell|Dr. Wendy Lawson]] tries to use the Tesseract to unlock [[light-speed]] travel but fails. While aboard Dr. Lawson's laboratory, Goose ingests the Tesseract, then later regurgitates it onto Fury's desk. In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', the Space Stone, along with the other Infinity Stones is destroyed by Thanos after his success of eliminating half of existence.  The Avengers go back in time to retrieve the Tesseract, first to New York City during 2012, although Tony Stark and Scott Lang fail in stealing the Tesseract, resulting instead in Loki escaping with it. Stark, along with Steve Rogers, then goes back to 1970 and successfully retrieves the Tessaract.\n\n===Video games===\nIn ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', [[Silver Surfer]] has a board made of \"Cosmic Bricks\" instead of just one Cosmic Cube. The bricks are collected throughout the game and many heroes race to get them before the villains, mainly [[Doctor Doom]] and [[Loki (comics)|Loki]], do. The Tesseract itself appears in the game when [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] have to go retrieve it. They succeed in recovering it. While everyone is discussing how to deal with it, Wolverine takes the \"Glow Cube\" for himself and brings it to the [[X-Mansion]], hoping that [[Professor X]] will use it to locate [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Magneto and the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]] then break in and take the Tesseract. Magneto takes the Cube to Doctor Doom who is going to use it in a ray gun to save the world from Galactus' hunger by controlling his mind, but Loki uses his magic mind control to make Doom hide that fact instead saying that he would use it to enslave the world. After Doctor Doom is defeated, Loki reveals its true purpose as a mind-control ray with the Tesseract serving as an infinite power source.

The film received generally positive reviews, and was followed by [[Cube (film series)|two sequels]]. A remake is in development at [[Lionsgate]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://screenrant.com/cube-movie-remake-cubed/|title='Cube' Reboot 'Cubed' Being Developed by Lionsgate|date=2015-04-30|work=Screen Rant|access-date=2017-05-27|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nAfter a man named Alderson is killed in a mysterious cube-shaped room, five strangers – Quentin, Worth, Holloway, Leaven, and Rennes – awaken and meet in another identical room. None know where they are or how they got there. Quentin informs the group that some rooms contain traps, which he discovered while exploring. Rennes, a convict who has escaped seven prisons, assumes each trap is triggered by a [[motion detector]] and tests each room by throwing one of his boots in first. The maze is beset by frequent tremors, and Leaven notices numbers inscribed in the narrow passageways between rooms. Rennes enters a room that he assumes to be safe and is killed when he is sprayed with acid, indicating that each trap uses different sensors to trigger them.\n\nQuentin believes each person was chosen to be there: He is a divorced police officer, Leaven is a [[mathematics]] student, and Holloway is a [[free clinic]] doctor, while the surly Worth says he is only an office worker. Leaven hypothesizes that any room marked with a [[prime number]] is a trap, and they find a mentally challenged man named Kazan, whom Holloway insists they bring along. Quentin injures his leg in a trapped room deemed safe by Leaven's calculations, and tensions rise over personal conflicts and the ensuing mystery over the maze's purpose. After being provoked by Quentin, Worth finally admits that he designed the maze's outer shell—in the shape of a gigantic cube—for a shadowy bureaucracy, and guesses that its original purpose has been forgotten; they have been imprisoned within the maze simply to put it to use.\n\nWorth's knowledge of the outer shell's dimensions allows Leaven to determine that each side of the Cube is 26 rooms across and that there are 17,576 rooms in total. She then guesses that the numbers indicate the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of each room. The group moves toward the nearest edge as determined by her theory, but each of the rooms near the outer wall is trapped. Rather than backtrack, they travel silently through a room with a sound-activated trap. After Kazan makes a sound and nearly causes Quentin's death, Quentin threatens Kazan. Holloway defends Kazan, and she and Quentin clash, with Holloway insinuating that Quentin may have been an abusive husband. When they reach the edge, Holloway scouts the darkened gap between the Cube and its outer shell but slips during another violent tremor; Quentin initially saves her but then lets her fall to her death.\n\nQuentin becomes mentally unhinged; he attempts to persuade Leaven to join him in abandoning the others and makes a sexual advance, but she rejects him. Worth intervenes, but Quentin beats him savagely and drops him into another room through a floor hatch. There, the group finds Rennes' corpse and are demoralized by the thought of having wandered in circles. Worth then realizes that the rooms move periodically throughout the Cube, which is the cause of all the tremors. Leaven also deduces that traps are not tagged by prime numbers, but by [[Prime power|powers of prime numbers]], and Kazan reveals himself to be an [[Savant syndrome|autistic savant]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v158816/review|title=''Cube'' review|work=[[AllMovie]]|first=Derek|last=Armstrong|accessdate=12 June 2017|quote=The wild card in the equation, as if there needed to be one, is Andrew Miller's autistic man.}}</ref> who can quickly do [[Integer factorization|prime factorization]]s mentally. With Kazan's help, Leaven guides the group to the bridge room that will lead them out of the maze. Worth ambushes and seemingly kills Quentin before leaving him behind. Kazan opens the final hatch, revealing a bright white light, but Worth declines to leave the Cube as he has lost faith in humanity.\n\nAs Leaven tries to convince Worth to join her, Quentin reappears, stabs and kills her with a hatch lever, and mortally wounds Worth while Kazan flees. As Quentin moves to kill Kazan, Worth grabs Quentin's leg and pins him in the narrow passageway as the rooms shift again. Quentin is torn apart, and Worth crawls back to Leaven's corpse and dies next to her. Kazan slowly walks into the bright light, his ultimate fate unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Maurice Dean Wint]] as Quentin McNeil, a [[police officer]].

The initial draft had a slightly comedic tone to it, and featured surreal images, a cannibal, edible moss that grew on the walls, and a monster that roamed the cube. Roommate and childhood filmmaking partner Andre Bijelic helped Natali strip the central idea – people avoiding deadly traps in a maze – down to its essence. Scenes that took place outside of the cube were jettisoned, and the identity of the victims themselves changed. In some drafts, they were accountants and in others criminals, with the implication being that their banishment to the cube was part of a penal sentence. One of the most important dramatic changes was the complete removal of food and water from the scenario; this created a sense of urgency for escape.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cube: Inside the Making of a Cult Film Classic|last=Berman|first=A.S.|publisher=BearManor Media|year=2018|isbn=978-1629332918|location=https://www.amazon.com/Cube-Inside-Making-Cult-Classic/dp/1629332917|pages=25–27, pp. 47–51}}</ref>\n\nAfter writing ''Cube'', Natali developed and filmed a short entitled ''[[Elevated (film)|Elevated]]''. The short was set in an elevator and was intended to give investors an idea of how ''Cube'' would hypothetically look and come across. While working on ''Elevated'', cinematographer Derek Rogers developed strategies for shooting in the tightly confined spaces in which he would later work on ''Cube''. The short eventually helped ''Cube'' procure financing. ''Cube'' was shot on a [[Toronto]] soundstage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/darkhours.html |title=CBC.ca |publisher=CBC.ca |date=2005-11-15 |access-date=2011-02-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211014753/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/darkhours.html| archive-date=2006-02-11| deadurl = yes}}</ref>\n\n=== The Cube design ===\nThe fictional Cube device in the film was conceived by David W. Pravica, a mathematician. It consists of an outer cubical shell (the ''sarcophagus'') and the inner cube. Each side of the outer shell is {{convert|434|ft|m}} long. The inner cube consists of 26<sup>3</sup> = 17,576 cubical rooms (minus an unknown number of rooms to allow for movement, as shown in the film), each having a side length of {{convert|15.5|ft|m}}. There is a space of {{convert|15.5|ft|m}} between the inner cube and the outer shell. Each room is labelled with three identification numbers, for example, 517 478 565. These numbers encode the starting coordinates of the room and the X, Y, and Z coordinates are the sums of the digits of the first, second, and third number, respectively. The numbers also determine the movement of the room - the subsequent positions are obtained by cyclically subtracting the digits from one another, and the resulting numbers are then successively added to the starting numbers.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Polster | first1 = Burkard | last2 = Ross | first2 = Marty | title = Math Goes to the Movies | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2012 | location = Baltimore | pages = 85–96 | chapter = 6 Escape from the Cube | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=4IfyzQuEJ3wC&pg=PA85&dq=cube+natali&hl=de&sa=X&ei=Nz6SUe2kC4PAhAeD0oHgAg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=cube%20natali&f=false | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4IfyzQuEJ3wC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | isbn = 978-1-4214-0484-4}}</ref>\n\nOnly one cube, with each of its sides measuring {{convert|14|ft|m}} in length, was actually built, with only one working door that could actually support the weight of the actors.

It was intended that there would be six different colours of rooms to match the recurring theme of six throughout the movie; five sets of gel panels, plus pure white. However, the budget did not stretch to the sixth gel panel, and so there are only five different room colours in the movie.

Rubik can only come alive when the colored squares on his sides had been matched up. The voice of Rubik, [[Ron Palillo]], told ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1983 that for the role, he spoke very slowly and then technicians sped up the tapes and raised the pitch. Palillo said Rubik's giggle is very different from the trademark laugh of Horshack, his character on the TV series ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', and that it is pretty \"for an inanimate object\".<ref>{{cite journal | date=November 5, 1983| title=Palillo's Puzzled| journal=[[TV Guide]]| volume=31| issue=45| page=78 | issn=0039-8543}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nRubik had fallen out of the stagecoach of an evil magician, who became the main villain of the series. Rubik helped Carlos, Lisa, and Reynaldo Rodriguez, in foiling the magician’s attempts to recover Rubik.  Once, Rubik was recovered by a detective who was a relative of the magician, but then decided the children should keep Rubik as the magician would use him for evil and selfish purposes.\n\nOutside of the evil magician, episodes usually dealt with more normal adversaries, such as when the eldest son had run afoul of a bully who had thwarted his efforts to gain a potential girlfriend, while at the same time the bully was making himself appear decent to the girl.  Rubik worked in secret to expose the bully’s true brutal personality in front of the girl.\n\nFor dramatic purposes, the cube was easily fully scrambled (such as by being dropped or grabbed by the family dog, and at least once Rubik scrambled himself) and usually solved quickly by the Rodriguez children, although in stressful circumstances it took them longer. When scrambled, Rubik can only be heard making low-key gibberish and sometime can be heard saying, \"Help.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ron Palillo]] – Rubik\n* [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] – Reynaldo Rodriguez\n* Jennifer Fajardo – Lisa Rodriguez\n* [[Michael Saucedo]] – Carlos Rodriguez\n* Angela Moya – Marla\n\nAdditional voices: [[Jack DeLeon]], Alan Dinehart, [[Laurie Faso]], [[Takayo Fischer]], [[Bob Holt (actor)|Bob Holt]], [[Tress MacNeille]], Tysun McMullan, [[Neil Ross]], [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]], [[Janet Waldo]], [[Alan Young]]\n\n==Theme music==\nIn keeping with the Hispanic flavor of the show, the theme song was sung by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] boy band [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]].

This dimension was originally believed to be accidentally accessed by lab technician [[Molecule Man|Owen Reece]]. Part of the energy from the dimension escapes and imbues Reece with infinite powers, which he wields as the villainous [[Molecule Man]]—potentially one of the most powerful villains in the [[Marvel Universe]]. The remaining energy of the pocket dimension gains sentience and curiosity, and becomes the Beyonder. The Beyonder creates a planet called [[Battleworld]] out of pieces of various planets (one such piece being a suburb of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]) and abducts a number of [[superhero]]es and [[supervillain]]s from Earth and forces them to fight each other so that he can observe the never-ending battle between good and evil. During this time, his powers were once stolen by [[Doctor Doom]].<ref>''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' (vol. 1) #10 (February 1985). Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Secret Wars II''===\nIntrigued by what he has witnessed during the first Secret Wars, the Beyonder comes to Earth during the ''[[Secret Wars II]]'' story line to walk among humans and study them and learn of human desire firsthand. He creates a human body for himself (this body originally resembles Molecule Man). He also transforms a television writer named Steward Cadwell into [[Thundersword]].<ref name=\"SWII#1\">''Secret Wars II'' #1.

Marvel Comics.</ref> The Beyonder later meets the blind superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and restores his ability to see, asking for legal representation in return. After realizing that the desire to protect his eyesight might compromise his integrity and dedication, Daredevil demands that the Beyonder take his sight away again, which he does.<ref>''Daredevil'' #223.

Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn order to combat Beyonder, [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] sent his demon agent Bitterhorn to form the Legion Accursed where he managed to get 99 villains together upon shaking their hand. While waiting for the Legion Accursed to arrive, Mephisto tricked Thing into signing a contract that would increase his strength. When the Legion Accursed had arrived, Thing had to defend Beyonder from them. By the time Mephisto planned to drop his contract with Thing, nearly all of the Legion Accursed were defeated. Due to Beyonder and Thing ruining his plan, Mephisto returned all the villains to where they were before he began his scheme.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter being encouraged to find enlightenment by [[Doctor Strange]], and failing, a frustrated Beyonder decides to destroy the entire multiverse, leading to several more battles with various Marvel superheroes, all of which end up with the Beyonder victorious. The Beyonder is finally defeated by a huge group of superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], and [[Spider-Man]], after the [[Molecule Man]] intervenes and kills him, while he had temporarily transformed into an infant in the midst of a re-birthing process.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===''Deadpool Team-Up''===\nLong after the ''Secret Wars II'' crossover had ended, a [[Deadpool]] special featured the \"Secret Wars II continues in this issue\" corner tag that was used during that original storyline. In this issue, a younger, less-experienced Deadpool is hired by the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] to kill the Beyonder. The flashback sequence ends with Deadpool chasing him into a portal with a footnote saying \"to be continued in Secret Wars III\".<ref>''[[Deadpool]] Team-up'' #1.

The Beyonder then merges with the Molecule Man.<ref>\"Secret Wars 3\", ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' #319.

Kosmos takes on a female form and is tutored by [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]], touring the universe with him.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #23.

After the [[amnesia]]c Maker destroys a [[Shi'ar]] colony, the [[Imperial Guard (comics)|Imperial Guard]] manage to imprison it in the interstellar prison called the [[Kyln]]. The Maker's madness takes control of several inmates but is finally subdued by [[Thanos]] and several of his allies among the prisoners. Thanos confronts the Maker, and, by refusing to reveal its origins at a critical juncture, manipulates it to psychically shut down its own mind. Thanos instructs the Shi'ar that the body should be kept alive but brain-dead, or the Beyonder essence would go free again.<ref>''Thanos'' #10 (2003).

Xavier also deduced the apparent secret behind the Beyonder's seemingly godlike abilities, which was that the Beyonder was not only an Inhuman but also a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], and the exposure of his mutant genes to [[Terrigen Mist]]s had created an unprecedented power.<ref>[http://www.popcultureshock.com/new-avengers-illuminati-3/41826/ \"New Avengers: Illuminati #3 Preview\"].

When encountered, the Beyonder is dwelling in a simulacrum of Manhattan Island on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], a [[dwarf planet]] in the [[asteroid belt]].<ref>''New Avengers: The Illuminati'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Illuminati convince the Beyonder to leave the universe, causing the Beyonder's human form and his simulacrum city to crumble into dust. However, Black Bolt admits that he has no memory of an Inhuman becoming the Beyonder, and the final image of the story hints that the entire event may have been orchestrated by the Beyonder himself, leaving his true nature in doubt.{{issue|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Time Runs Out===\nIt was revealed in ''Secret Wars Official Guide to the Marvel Multiverse'' that in the distant past, the enigmatic [[Beyonders]] created [[pocket universe]]s holding vast amounts of sentient energy, possibly as incubator units for their young. Some were later tapped into by various beings, including [[Skrull]]s and Humans, to create reality-warping [[Cosmic Cube]]s. The Beyonders also had engineered an accident that created a pinhole to the universe containing the \"Child Unit\" Beyonder which had also caused Molecule Man to obtain his power. [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] described the Beyonder as a \"child unit\" to the Beyonders.<ref>''New Avengers'' (vol. 3) #30 (April 2015).

Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nThe Beyonder proved capable of destroying, and recreating, the abstract entity known as [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] across the multiverse, although it extremely exerted and weakened him to do so. However, even in this state, he was capable of easily sending a horde of demons back to hell with a wave of his hand.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #6 (1985). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nDespite his power, the Beyonder has shown moments of vulnerability. He was overwhelmed when [[Rachel Summers]] returned the enormous powers that he had bestowed upon her along with the thoughts of the past and present beings in the universe, to the point that he collapsed on the ground,<ref>[http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/56904/2226158-beyonder_vs_phoenix2.jpg ''Uncanny X-Men'' #203].

Marvel Comics</ref> He also stated that the [[Puma (comics)|Puma]]—when in perfect harmony with the Universe—was capable of killing him, but there was no proof of this.<ref>''Peter Parker the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #111. Marvel Comics</ref> However, on another occasion, after trying to be a superhero by fighting a superpowered biker gang, the Beyonder stated that he limits his powers to keep them more in line with the world around him.<ref>[http://marvel.wikia.com/Dazzler_Vol_1_40 ''Dazzler'' Vol.1 #40 (Nov. 1985)]. Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nAfter his creator, [[Jim Shooter]], left Marvel, writer-editor [[Tom DeFalco]] re-tooled the Beyonder, diminishing his power greatly: He was no longer nearly omnipotent, and several of the cosmic beings who were previously established to be below him in power were vastly upgraded in conjunction.<ref name=\"FF27\"/><ref>''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' Vol.2 #7 (June 1986). Marvel Comics</ref><ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319 (1988). Marvel Comics</ref><ref name=\"FF23\"/>\n\nNonetheless, the Beyonder retained his reality-warping powers, allowing him to control and manipulate matter, energy, and reality at a cosmic level beyond all but the strongest and most powerful of [[cosmic entities (Marvel Comics)|cosmic entities]].\n\nHe repelled [[Galactus]] \"like a bug\",<ref name=\"SW1\">''Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars'' #1.

To prepare [[Spider-Man]] for the Chosen One's role, Beyonder teleports [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Alistair Smythe]], the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]] and the [[Red Skull]] to a peaceful planet and accelerated its time to where It's conquered. After Beyonder provides Spider-Man with a base, he and Madame Web watch Spider-Man lead [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] into fighting the villains. Doctor Doom later learned about Beyonder and stole his powers which led to his nightmares coming to reality. After Spider-Man defeated Doctor Doom with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]'s help, Beyonder declared Spider-Man the winner and sent everyone back to Earth. The next step for Spider-Man is to stop a plot by Spider-Carnage in [[Ben Reilly]]'s reality that would threaten all existence. While Spider-Man stopped Spider-Carnage's plot there, Beyonder withdrew to his world to recover after using his energy to send the Six-Armed Spider-Man's Man-Spider form away.\n* The Beyonder appears in ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers: Secret Wars]]'', voiced by [[Steven Weber (actor)|Steven Weber]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Beyond|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=4|number=17|airdate=January 14, 2018}}</ref> This version creates Battleworld out of other worlds as part of his experiment. In the episode \"Beyond\", he recreates [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] for the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]] and he tells the two groups about Battleworld as part of his experiment. In the episode \"Underworld\", it's revealed that Beyonder manipulated [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]. Beyonder also demonstrates his abilities by splitting the [[Hulk]] and Bruce Banner apart before sending the two to the other parts of Battleworld. In the episode \"The Citadel\", Beyonder has [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]], [[Absorbing Man]], [[Black Widow (Yelena Belova)|Crimson Widow]] and [[MODOK]] bring him both Iron Man and Captain America. While his enforcers fight Captain America, Beyonder tries to convince Iron Man to be a part of his experiment. In actuality, Beyonder manipulates Iron Man and Captain America to fight each other. Wanting to see who will win, he gets blindsided when the two Avengers were acting and get away with his own information. Enraged, Beyonder swats his enforcers away, however, he spares Ares for his future revenge. In the episode \"The Wastelands\", Beyonder goes after the Avengers' two groups due to wanting to undo Battleworld. He first sends Ares and an army of [[Ghost Rider]]s, and then personally goes after the two groups, leading to [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] using Mjolnir to defeat him.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://marvel.wikia.com/Beyonder_(Earth-616) The Beyonder] at the Marvel wiki.\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Maker The Beyonder] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/beyondersw.htm|The Beyonder}}\n\n{{Marvel Cosmic Entities}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Avengers}}\n{{Doctor Doom}}\n{{Silver Surfer}}\n{{Thanos}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Deadpool}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jim Shooter]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains]]\n[[Category:Fictional higher-dimensional characters]]\n[[Category:God in fiction]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Cosmic Cubes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics cosmic entities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"

He [[first appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' #20 in November 1963 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. He is often portrayed as a [[supervillain]], but sometimes takes the role of a reformed outlaw or [[reluctant hero]].\n\n==Publication history==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2019}}\nMolecule Man was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]], and first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #20.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===1960s===\nOwen Reece was a timid child from [[Brooklyn, New York]] who obsessively clung to his mother. He grew into a weak-willed adult, made bitter and lonely by his mother's death, and full of fear and hatred of what he regarded as a deeply unfriendly world. Reece became a lowly laboratory technician working at a [[nuclear plant]] owned by the Acme Atomics Corporation. He was disgruntled by his job's long hours and low pay. One day, Reece accidentally activated an experimental particle generator, which bombarded him with an unknown form of radiation. The radiation had a mutagenic effect on Reece, releasing his potential for [[psionic]] powers on a cosmic scale. Reece could now control all matter, even down to the molecular level, and all energy. The radiation also left markings resembling lightning bolts across Reece's face. Reece named himself the \"Molecule Man\" after his power to control molecules.\n\nThe tremendous forces released by the accident also opened a [[wormhole]] between Earth's dimension and the dimension containing the immensely powerful entity later known as the [[Beyonder]]. During the following years, the Beyonder observed Earth and its multiverse through the interdimensional pinhole.<ref name=\"Secret Wars II #1-9\">''Secret Wars II'' #1-9</ref>\n\nThe day after the accident, the president of Acme Atomics fired Reece for his carelessness, not even knowing his name after his twelve years of work there. Angered, Molecule Man covered the president and his desk with ice that he formed from molecules in the air. Reece became a criminal and set out to use his powers to take revenge on a world he believed had belittled and persecuted him. However, Reece's self-doubt, fear, and self-hatred subconsciously restricted his powers. He believed he was unable to affect organic molecules, and that his power resided in a metal wand.\n\n[[Uatu]] the [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]] recognized the threat that Molecule Man posed and alerted the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Molecule Man easily defeated the Fantastic Four, forcing them to retreat. He created a glass barrier around Long Island, saying the people would be trapped until the Fantastic Four were brought to him. Mister Fantastic, realizing Reece had only affected inorganic molecules, had [[Alicia Masters]] lure him to her apartment with the Fantastic Four flare. The Fantastic Four pretended to be statues by covering themselves with plaster. When Reece found himself unable to affect the statues, he dropped his wand in shock, allowing [[Mister Fantastic]] to grab it. The Watcher transported Molecule Man to confinement in an other-dimensional world where time passed at an accelerated rate.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #20</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nBelieving himself unable to escape, Reece created a humanoid construct to serve as his companion and, through unknown means, endowed it with consciousness. Reece let the construct believe itself to be his son. Before dying, Reece transferred his consciousness and powers into the wand his son carried. Not bound by human limitations, the construct, known as the new Molecule Man, escaped to Earth. In an attempt to avenge his father, the new Molecule Man battled both the [[Man-Thing]] and the Thing of the Fantastic Four. Dependent on the metal wand to maintain his existence in this dimension, the new Molecule Man disintegrated when the wand was taken from him.<ref>''Marvel Two-in-One'' #1</ref>\n\nHowever, the consciousness and powers of the original Molecule Man remained within the wand, and Molecule Man could overpower the minds of whoever touched the wand and take control of their bodies. He took mental possession of Cynthia McClellan, and through her, battled [[Iron Man]].<ref>''Iron Man Annual'' #3</ref> Molecule Man then took mental possession of Aaron Stankey and Mister Fantastic.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #187-188</ref>\n\n===1980s===\nThe wand passed through the hands of a succession of holders until Reece's mind recreated his mutated body and transferred his consciousness and powers out of the wand and into the body. He threatened to destroy the world, but was persuaded by [[Tigra]] to give himself up and seek psychiatric help.<ref>''Avengers'' #215-216</ref>\n\nReece did so, and soon began to change. He now had simple goals: true love, friendship, and a good home. However, Reece found himself sent to Battleworld, the planet created by the Beyonder, as part of the small army of criminal superhuman beings that were to engage in the first [[Secret Wars|Secret War]]. Impressed by the charismatic dictator [[Doctor Doom]], Reece agreed to help fight the superheroes also brought to Battleworld. During the course of the war, Reece and a superhuman called [[Volcana (Marvel Comics)|Volcana]] fell in love. Doctor Doom eventually succeeded in temporarily stealing the power of the Beyonder and transferring it into himself. Believing himself abandoned by Doctor Doom, Reece threatened to kill him. But Doctor Doom helped Reece break through his mental blocks and realize that his power was greater than he had believed. No longer angry at Doctor Doom, Reece transported himself, Volcana, and most of the criminals back to Earth. On Earth, Reece and Volcana began living together quietly in a Denver suburb, and Reece took a job as a worker in an atomic plant.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #1-12</ref>\n\nMonths later, the Beyonder, again in possession of his full power, came to Earth in humanoid form seeking emotional fulfillment. When he failed, the Beyonder decided to rid himself of the problem by obliterating the multiverse. Reece attempted to save the universe by destroying the Beyonder, but the Beyonder's immense power far surpassed even Reece's own. Reece joined forces with many of Earth's superhuman champions to battle him. But the Molecule Man exhausted himself fighting the Beyonder, who unleashed an immensely powerful blast of energy to destroy Reece and his allies. The blast ripped open Earth's crust in the area of the Rocky Mountains, and would have caused incredible planet-wide instability if not for Molecule Man's power. Molecule Man used his power to shield himself and his allies, and to remove every living thing from the path of the blast to safety. As a result of his monumental efforts, Reece severely injured himself internally.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nHis foes appearing to have been defeated, the Beyonder proceeded with his new plan to find fulfillment by using a complex machine to transform himself into a mortal being with his full power. The machine drained the Beyonder's power into itself, transformed him into a mortal baby, and then began transferring the energy back into him. The infant would soon again become an adult. Molecule Man and his allies found the machine, and Reece, believing they could not take the chance that the newly reborn Beyonder would not someday destroy the multiverse, decided to kill him while he was vulnerable. Reece destroyed the machine, causing the infant's death, and diverted the Beyonder's immense power, which the machine released, through an interdimensional portal into the dimension from which the Beyonder had originally come.<ref name=\"Secret Wars II #1-9\"/> There the energy created a new universe.<ref>''Secret Wars II'' #9</ref>\n\nThe injured Molecule Man and the [[Silver Surfer]], uniting their power temporarily, repaired all the damage done to the Earth, restoring the mountains and the part of the crust that the Beyonder had destroyed. Reece, believing that Earth's superhuman champions would always worry about his misusing them, pretended his powers had been burned out. Only Volcana and Silver Surfer know that Reece still has his powers. Reece lived quietly for a time with Rosenberg in their Denver suburb.<ref>''Avengers'' #266</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nReece was briefly merged with the Beyonder in order to take part in the creation of the complete [[Cosmic Cube]] being known as [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #318-319</ref> He managed to separate himself and return to Earth. He was then defeated in combat by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and separated from Volcana.<ref>''Fantastic Four Annual'' #24</ref> Molecule Man was later placed under the mental control of the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]]. The Puppet Master used Reece to combat [[Aron (comics)|Aron]] the Rogue [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher]], but Aron defeated him.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #372-373</ref> The now generally benevolent Reece accidentally releases his \"darkest aspect\", which takes separate form and attacks Kosmos in search of revenge upon the Beyonder, and it extracts and fights this part of the whole in a more than three-dimensional battle. After it defeats the Beyonder, [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] and the original Molecule Man stop it from delivering the death blow, as this would also kill the peaceful Kosmos. Owen reabsorbs it, and as farewell, Kubik states that Owen's true self's full potential is far greater than that of his dark side.<ref name=\"FF27\"/>\n\n[[Doc Samson]] stumbles upon the Molecule Man while searching for the missing [[Hulk|Bruce Banner]]. Owen mistakenly thinks that he is being stalked, and captures Samson to explain himself. After [[She-Hulk]] gets involved, they clear up the misunderstanding. He reveals that his relationship with Marsha has hit a road bump, leading to temporary separation that makes him depressed. Samson convinces Owen to display his affection more openly, whereupon the latter decides to repair areas destroyed by recent terrorist activity in Marsha's honor, including rebuilding [[Mount Rushmore]] with the addition of her own likeness, which his girlfriend apparently finds touching.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #441-442</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nMolecule Man was listed as one of the Raft escapees after the events of ''[[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]'' #1.\n\nHe is one of the villains incarcerated in the Raft when the [[Skrull]]s strike.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #1</ref>\n\nA series of disappearances in the small town of [[Dinosaur, Colorado]], causes [[Norman Osborn]]'s \"[[Dark Avengers]]\" to visit the area. [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] arrives first and is instantly disintegrated. Owen, isolated from everyone, has lost the [[Schizophrenia|ability to differentiate between hallucinations and reality]], and secluded himself near the area he was born. After the other Avengers are defeated, [[Victoria Hand]] convinces Reece to restore everyone and everything he destroyed and to stop being a threat, in return for being left alone in the future. Sentry returns at this point, attacks Molecule Man, and pulls him into the air, but is destroyed again. Sentry immediately reforms, and takes advantage of Owen's distraction from an incoming missile to take control of his body. Apparently unaware that Owen had already promised to do so, Sentry tells the Molecule Man to restore everything or be killed. Owen does so, but Sentry still disintegrates his body in return.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #10-12</ref>\n\n===2010s===\nReece's body was reformed and imprisoned by Dr. Doom, who intended to use him, as his energy frequency matched with the beacon of the Mapmakers, to oppose whatever was the origin of the Incursions and the decay of the universe.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 3 #24</ref> The Molecule Man took Doom elsewhere,<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 3 #27</ref> a blank void from where they subsequently traveled backwards through the mists of time.<ref>''New Avengers'' Vol 3 #29</ref>\n\nDoom and the Molecule Man arrived twenty-five years into the past of another universe, where they witnessed the origin of said reality's Molecule Man.{{issue|date=June 2015}} The journey affected Molecule Man's mind, restoring it from its chaotic state which enables Reece to inform Doom that his accident was caused by the Beyonders, who created the Molecule Man in the first place as a singularity across every reality, to have the function of a \"bomb\", which would destroy its universe if he died. To prove his point the Molecule Man killed his counterpart, which set off the early death of his counterpart's universe, and is the default origin of the Incursions. The Molecule Man convinced Doom that in order to thwart the plans of the Beyonders, he had to embark on a mission to kill every one of the Molecule Men.{{issue|date=June 2015}}\n\nDuring the 2015 \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline, the nearly omnipotent Doctor Doom kept Molecule Man in a special chamber in his castle following the formation of his Battleworld.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the attack on Castle Doom, the two Spider-Men ([[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] and [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]]) found the chamber that Molecule Man is in. Like every visitor before him, Molecule Man asks if they had any food with them. Miles gives him a cheeseburger from his pocket, for which Molecule Man states he is in debt to Miles. Upon learning that Molecule Man is the source of Doom's powers, the two Spider-Men leave.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Fantastic and Maker (the Earth-1610 version of Mister Fantastic) enter Molecule Man's chamber where Maker is seemingly killed by Molecule Man while Mister Fantastic fights God Emperor Doom. To make the fight between Mister Fantastic and Doctor Doom fair, Molecule Man depowered Doom. During the fight, Doom admits that Mister Fantastic would have done better with the godlike powers, and in response, Molecule Man gives his powers to Mister Fantastic, causing Battleworld to fall apart. Using Molecule Man's powers in conjunction with [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' ability to conjure entire universes, Mister Fantastic begins to reconstruct the Multiverse. As each new reality is recreated, a portion of Molecule Man attached to it as an \"anchor\", which has the effect of restoring his sanity. In gratitude to Miles, Molecule Man transfers him, his family (including his now-resurrected mother), and his friends to Earth-616, now known as The Prime Earth. Their entire life histories are merged with this new Prime Earth, and have no memory of having originated from a different universe, except the participants of the Battleworld who still have their former respective original universes' memories intact.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nMolecule Man was later seen with Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Franklin Richards, Valeria Richards, and the Future Foundation on a world where he has noticed that Franklin's reality-warping abilities are depleting. When the Griever at the End of All Things attacked, she killed Molecule Man and had her Endlings feed off his energies.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Vol. 6 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nOwen Reece originally had the ability to mentally manipulate molecules, allowing for a variety of effects, such as the creation of [[force field (fiction)|force field]]s, energy beams, and [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] portals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, Reece later gained the power to warp reality itself on a multiversal scale.<ref name=\"Ultimates6\">''Ultimates'' #6 (April 2016)</ref>\n\nOriginally, he subconsciously imposed mental blocks on himself which prevented him from affecting organic molecules, which has since been overcome.<ref>''Secret Wars'' #11</ref> He was also dependent on using a steel rod, which he called a wand, to focus his powers,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but subsequently learned how to direct his powers without it.<ref>''Avengers'' #215</ref>\n\nWhen the Molecule Man extracted the Beyonder from Kosmos, their battle took place in more than [[Projective geometry|three spatial dimensions]] and threatened to cause a [[Brane cosmology|multi-universal]] scale of destruction.<ref name=\"FF27\">''Fantastic Four Annual'' #27 (1994). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Doctor Doom]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and Owen Reece himself, he is a \"multiversal composite entity\": a single creature that manifests \"fractions\" of its entire being in each universe of the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Marvel Multiverse]].<ref>''Secret Wars'' vol. 2, issue #9</ref>\n\nThe ''actual,'' primary function of Owen Reece, is to serve as a living bomb, one capable of destroying the entire universe that he is inhabiting if he dies for any reason, in accordance with the deliberate design of the [[Beyonders]] (who placed one \"slice\" of him into each universe simultaneously). He is, apparently, utterly unable to stop his own death from happening (at the hands of the Beyonders) even with his vast powers.<ref name=\"New Avengers vol. 3, Issue #33\">''New Avengers'' vol. 3, Issue #33</ref><ref>''Secret Wars (2015), Issue #9</ref>\n\nIn an issue of ''Ultimates'', [[Galactus]], having recently evolved into a more powerful form, hears a voice he recognizes as belonging to someone who can destroy him \"with a thought,\" and passes through a doorway into a quasi-reality constructed by Owen Reece. Reece explains that he chose the name Molecule Man out of a love of alliteration even though his power makes even atoms seem \"clunky,\" and that his abilities function at deeper levels, with him going through a list of more appropriate names \"Proton Man, or Quark Man. Superstring Man. Information Man.\" The next panel is drawn from an angle that causes Reece to appear to be looking out of the panel at the reader as he describes himself as \"Editing and ordering the base information of reality. Owen Reece, Narrative Man. Heh.\", implying that he may realize that he is a character in a story, and that it is the narrative elements of the story itself that he is manipulating.<ref name=\"Ultimates66\">''Ultimates'' vol. 2, #6 (June 2016). Marvel Comics</ref>\n\nCounter-intuitively, the ''less'' divided that he is across the multiverse, the ''more'' mentally unstable (and potentially dangerous) the Molecule Man becomes.<ref name=\"New Avengers vol. 3, Issue #33\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n===''JLA/Avengers''===\nIn ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Molecule Man is seen among the enthralled villains defending [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]'s stronghold. He is shown encased in stone. When [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] asks who did this, the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] tells him it was [[Sersi]].<ref>''JLA/Avengers'' #4</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* Molecule Man appeared in the 1960s ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' series, voiced by [[Henry Corden]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He was seen in his eponymously-titled episode \"Molecule Man\".\n* Molecule Man appears in ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'', voiced by [[Fred Stoller]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} He was first mentioned in the episode \"Night in the Sanctorum\". In the episode \"Villainy Redux Syndrome\", Molecule Man and Volcana come to the aid of [[Doctor Doom]], [[MODOK]] and [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] when MODOK accidentally summoned him instead of [[Mole Man]]. He used his abilities to turn the guard tower that [[Captain America]] and [[Carol Danvers|Ms. Marvel]] were on into butter enabling Doctor Doom, MODOK, Abomination, Molecule Man and Volcana to escape. In the episode \"When Strikes the Surfer\", Volcana has Molecule Man make a mouth for [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] (whose mouth was removed from her by Thanos' Reality Gem) while they are at a galactic diner. Nebula tells Molecule Man and Volcana that the [[Silver Surfer|Dark Surfer]] is causing havoc. Doctor Doom approaches the three villains stating that they should band together to trap Dark Surfer in the machine Doctor Doom once used to drain the [[Silver Surfer]]'s powers. Molecule Man later joins Doctor Doom into attacking Dark Surfer. Dark Surfer ends up sending the villains on Doctor Doom's side through a portal.\n* Molecule Man appears in the ''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|Avengers Assemble]]'' animated series. He once tried to leave with the town until he fought the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and was disarmed of his wand. However, his son '''Aaron Reece''' (voiced by [[Daryl Sabara]]<ref name=\"Molecule Kid\">{{cite episode|title=Molecule Kid|serieslink=Avengers Assemble (TV series)|series=Avengers Assemble|network=Disney XD|season=1|number=8|airdate=August 11, 2013}}</ref>) inherited the wand. In the episode \"Molecule Kid\", [[Ultimate Nick Fury|Nick Fury]] assigns [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] to track down what someone believed to be Molecule Man and confiscate his technology. Following a S.H.I.E.L.D. lead, Hawkeye and Black Widow discover that the person actually being pursued is also being targeted by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]]: Aaron. After ditching A.I.M., Aaron goes on the run with Hawkeye and Black Widow in pursuit. Aaron considers the Avengers and A.I.M. the same as they want his father's wand. Things get worse when MODOK (via [[Super-Adaptoid]]) arrives and captures Aaron. While Captain America and [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] fight the Adaptoid, Black Widow and Hawkeye try to reason with Aaron until [[Iron Man]] arrives and the wand is accidentally broken, causing reality to be broken. When the Adaptoid attacks, Aaron uses the wand's fragments to defeat Super-Adaptoid and undo the damages with Iron Man's help. While Aaron undoes the damages, the others shut down the Adaptoid. Aaron is then given to S.H.I.E.L.D. to put in Fury's [[New Warriors|training program for teenage superheroes]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Molecule_Man Molecule Man] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{Fantastic Four}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic Entities}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Jack Kirby}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Jack Kirby]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1963]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with nuclear or radiation abilities]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Cosmic Cubes]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics mutates]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics supervillains]]"

Its origin was first revealed in ''Captain America Annual'' #7 (1983).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nThe Shaper of Worlds' existence began thousands of years ago as a [[Cosmic Cube]] created by [[Skrull]] scientists on an unnamed planet in the Andromeda Galaxy that was part of the Skrull Empire. It was used by the Skrull Emperor to enforce his rule over the Empire as a god-king. The Cube subsequently developed sentience and, because its mind had been imprinted by the [[megalomania]]cal personality of the emperor, it lashed out and devastated a significant portion of the Empire before it reached emotional maturity. It was after this that it started calling itself the \"Shaper of Worlds\" and chose the form that it uses to this day: an ivory male Skrull torso atop a metallic [[frustum]] and tractor treads for apparent mobility.<ref>origin revealed in ''Captain America Annual'' #7</ref>\n\nOn an unnamed extradimensional micro-world, the Shaper created a \"world\" based on the Nazi-dominated 1940s Earth from the mind of ex-Nazi scientist Otto Kronsteig. This \"world\" was destroyed by the intervention of the [[Hulk]].<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #155</ref> On Earth, the Shaper then created a \"world\" based on 1950s American popular culture from the mind of ex-henchman \"Slugger\" Johnson; this \"world\" was destroyed by the intervention of the [[Fantastic Four]]. The Shaper took [[Glorian|Thomas Gideon]] as his apprentice before leaving Earth.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #136-137</ref> The Shaper returns later, creating a \"paradise world\" of peace for the Hulk on an unnamed planetoid, based on his fondest dreams from the mind of the Hulk. This is because the Shaper feels guilty for harassing the Hulk earlier. The Shaper creates illusions of the Hulk's long lost love interest, [[Jarella]]; and deceased friend, Crackajack Johnson. The peace is marred by the appearance of the Toad Men, who have invaded looking for slaves.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' #190 (Aug. 1975)</ref> In the next issue, the Toad Men kill the Shaper's friend, [[Glorian]]. This causes the illusion to fall apart, which sends the Hulk on a rampage. The Toad Men are defeated and the Hulk rejects the Shaper's offer for a new illusionary reality, which destroyed the \"paradise world\".<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #191</ref>\n\nGlorian was later revealed to be the transformed Thomas Gideon, and was not actually killed on the paradise world. The Shaper witnessed Glorian's attempt to create a \"world\" based on the dreams of the inhabitants from a small town ruined by the accidental intervention of the Hulk.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #267</ref> The Shaper was sent by the [[Kree]] [[Supreme Intelligence]] to guide the evolution of Earth's [[Kubik (comics)|Cosmic Cube]] into a sentient being; while there, the Shaper encountered [[Captain America]] and the [[Wundarr the Aquarian|Aquarian]] and revealed to them his origin as the Cosmic Cube created long ago by the Skrulls.<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #7</ref>\n\nWith [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] (formerly the Earth Cosmic Cube), the Shaper encountered the Fantastic Four and [[Doctor Doom]] in the universe of the [[Beyonder]]. The Shaper recounted the Beyonder's true origin as part of the same force that created the [[Molecule Man]], and witnessed the transformation of the Beyonder and Molecule Man into a [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|new Cosmic Cube]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #319</ref> The Shaper later allowed Glorian to return to Earth to use his power to help the Hulk achieve nobility.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #355-356</ref> The outing ultimately went badly for Glorian, and the Shaper rescued the Hulk and Glorian from the demonic attention of [[Satannish]] (in the guise of Cloot).<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #359</ref>\n\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Glorian tells Silver Surfer and Dawn how the Shaper of Worlds will help him rebuild the universe for the heroes to return to after they finish up in [[Battleworld]]. It is revealed that the white area that Glorian and his assistant Zee are in is the small spot that is between his eye and his nose.<ref>''Silver Surfer'' Vol. 7 #13</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nThe Shaper of Worlds is an alien matter-energy construct with unknown, and potentially incalculable physical power. He has the ability to restructure finite pockets of reality and to alter the molecular configuration of persons and objects. He is also capable of intergalactic and interdimensional teleportation, and empathic perception. The Shaper's intelligence is immeasurable, but lacking a creative imagination, the Shaper must use the mind of another sentient being as a template for his transformations of worlds.\n\nThe Shaper has massive power, but he cannot actually create new worlds; after destroying a significant portion of the Skrull Empire, he deliberately limited the scope of his powers.{{issue|date=September 2013}} He only rearranges the structure of an existing world to fit the template that has been requested by another. The alien can only create worlds if it has the dreams of another living being to use as a blueprint. These factors are often considered to be the greatest drawbacks to its powers.\n\nIt is his curse that he has a strong desire to make dreams come true, but does not have any dreams himself. He seeks out other beings that he senses have wishes he can fulfill. Only in this way can he find a release for his strong desire to shape reality.\n\n[[Glorian]] and [[Kubik (comics)|Kubik]] are his protégés.\n\nThe Shaper of Worlds has fought the [[Hulk]],{{issue|date=September 2013}} and the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #136-137</ref> It was he who taught the [[Beyonder]] and the [[Molecule Man]] that they shared a common origin and merged them into the being known as [[Kosmos (Marvel Comics)|Kosmos]].{{issue|date=September 2013}}\n\n==Other versions==\n===Batman vs. the Incredible Hulk===\nIn the 1981 DC and Marvel crossover ''Batman vs the Incredible Hulk'', the Shaper of Worlds, who was stranded on Earth, teamed with the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to acquire a gamma-ray gun to treat a disease he had acquired that was driving him mad. The Joker finally succeeds in stealing the gamma-ray gun, but finding its insufficient power but the entity realizes the Hulk contains the key to his power being restored, leading Joker to kidnap the Hulk instead. The plan succeeds, with the Shaper subsequently making the Joker's dreams real, but Batman and the Hulk team up to defeat the duo.<ref>''DC Special Series'' #27 (Fall 1981)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.marvel.com/universe/Shaper_of_Worlds Shaper of Worlds] at Marvel.com\n* {{Marveldatabase}}\n\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic Entities}}\n\n[[Category:Characters created by Archie Goodwin]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Herb Trimpe]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1972]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics Cosmic Cubes]]"

It requires six 180° turns to complete one rotation resulting in a twisty puzzle. The design of the Gear Cube places all gears externally in order for the mechanics to be seen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oskarvandeventer.nl/meffert.html|title=Meffert|website=oskarvandeventer.nl|access-date=2017-07-23}}</ref> While looking rather formidable at first sight, it is nevertheless \nactually simpler to solve than the original Rubik's Cube.\n\nThere are two objectives when solving the cube. The first goal is taking the mixed up puzzle back to its original cubic state. The second goal is to actually solve the puzzle by arranging each side back to their own beginning colors.\n\n== Mechanics ==\nThe Gear Cube has a design like no other because the puzzle is made almost completely out of gears. The cube has 12 edge pieces, four on every layer, which are all gear cogs. Each edge piece has two different colors on it, the colors of the two sides it lies between. It also has eight corners, four on the top layer and four on the bottom layer. Each corner connects three different sides and possesses those three colors. Also, the cube has a total of 41,472 possible [[permutation]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEach side is permitted to turn in only 180° increments or half turns. Due to the gears not making a full rotation along with the side it's attached to, it prohibits 90° turns. This is why all of the algorithms involve either half turns or a full rotation.\n\nIt has six stationary centers, each with a different color, that always stay opposite another specific center. White is always opposite yellow. Blue is always opposite green. Red is always opposite purple. Each center determines what color that side will be. The centers are exactly based on the original Rubik's Cube. They are connected by a three dimensional cross with screws and springs allowing for less tension.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://rubikscube.info/concepts.php|title=Basic Concepts of the Rubik's Cube|website=rubikscube.info|language=en|access-date=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\n== Solution ==\n\n=== Move notation ===\nMany cube solvers use the same [[notation]] when completing a cube, whether they are working on the original Rubik's Cube, the [[Pyraminx]], or even the Gear Cube. They are most likely using \"Singmaster notation\", originally developed by [[David Singmaster]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48013200|title=Adventures in group theory : Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and other mathematical toys|last=1959-|first=Joyner, David|date=2002|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801869471|location=Baltimore|oclc=48013200}}</ref> It allows for algorithms to be written in a way that a solver can use it no matter what side of the cube they are on. \n* ''F'' (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n* ''B'' (Back): the side opposite the front\n* ''U'' (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n* ''D'' (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the cube\n* ''L'' (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n* ''R'' (Right): the side directly to the right of the front<ref name=\":1\" />\nWhen a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] ( ' ) follows a letter it indicates that move must be rotated in a [[Counter Clockwise|counter-clockwise]] fashion. However, if the prime symbol is absent after the letter, that move must be rotated in a [[clockwise]] fashion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://solvethecube.com/notation|title=SolveTheCube|website=solvethecube.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-23}}</ref>\n\n'''For example''': '''R''' - rotate the right side clockwise. '''R'''' - rotate the right side counter-clockwise.\n\nSometimes in an algorithm there might be a number following a letter. That is just saying how many times to rotate that specific side.\n\n'''For example''': F2 means rotate the front side two times in a clockwise direction.\n\nThere is also a possibility of a set of moves in parenthesis followed by a number. Meaning do that set of moves a certain number of times in a row.\n\n'''For example''': (R' F B L') 2 means complete the set once, then repeat a second time.\n\n==== Algorithms ====\nWhen solving the Gear Cube, there are only two basic [[algorithm]]s needed:\n# Switch an upper-front edge gear with the upper-back edge gear directly across from it: (U2 R4) 2\n# Position all edge gears evenly into a cubic state: R4 (Repeat as necessary).\n\n=== Solving steps  ===\nSolving the Gear Cube is based more on the observations the solver makes. There are only two algorithms needed to solve the cube, so finding the patterns is a key skill. However, using the algorithms is simple once the patterns are located.\n\n'''Phase 1: Solve the corners:''' (This step is intuitive; there are no algorithms to complete this step.)\n\nStep 1: Get two corners next to each other that belong next to each other. Do any moves necessary to achieve this position (green corner paired with another green corner, both having matching side colors)\n\nStep 2: As soon as two green corners are paired together, the other set of green corners should be paired as well, but is most likely located somewhere else on the cube.\n\n- Pair both sets of green corners to complete the green side, then rotate the opposite (blue) side until all of the sides corners match.\n\n- Rotate each side until those corners match the center piece color.\n\n'''Phase 2: Position the edges:''' (first algorithm used)\n\nStep 1: Find two gear edge pieces across from each other that need to be swapped in order for each edge to correspond with the color of the two sides they lie between.\n\n- Place those two edges on the top side and complete the following algorithm: (U2 R4) 2.\n\nStep 2: Repeat the previous step until all edge pieces are in the correct position (edge colors match the colors of the sides it is between).\n\n'''Phase 3: Orient the edges:''' (second algorithm used)\n\nStep 1: Rotate all sides until the cube is back in a cubic state using the following algorithm: R4 (repeat as necessary).<ref>{{Citation|last=RedKB|title=How to solve a Gear Cube|date=2010-06-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSwcrVhSQkI|accessdate=2017-07-23}}</ref> \n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Mixed Gear Cube.jpg|Beginning mix\nFile:Corners Gear Cube.jpg|End of Phase 1\nFile:Position edges gear cube.jpg|End of Phase 2\nFile:Edges oriented.jpg|End of Phase 3\n</gallery>\n\n== Variations ==\nThere are multiple variations of the Gear Cube, ranging from the most simple, a 2x2 Gear Shift, to the most complicated, the 3x3 Even Less Gears Cube. Three 3x3 cubes are very similar to the original: the Gear Cube Extreme, the Gear Cube Ultimate, and the Even Less Gears Cube.\n\n'''Gear Cube Extreme''': Unlike the original Gear Cube with 12 total gears, the Gear Cube Extreme (also known as the [[Anisotropy|Anisotropic]] Cube) has only eight gears.<ref>{{Citation|last=OskarPuzzle|title=Anisotropic Cube|date=2010-08-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tm-FNfpIQY|accessdate=2017-07-23}}</ref> The top and bottom rows remain gear cogs, whereas the middle layer edge cogs have been removed. Taking away the middle layer cogs and replacing them with standard edges allows for different movement between rows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/gearcube2.htm|title=Gear Cube Extreme|website=www.jaapsch.net|access-date=2017-07-22}}</ref> Due to the added straight edges, the cube can now make 90° turns on two rows and as well as 180° turns on four rows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ruwix.com/twisty-puzzles/gear-cube-extreme-ultimate-how-to-solve-gearcube-solution/|title=Gear Cube Extreme and Ultimate solutions|work=Ruwix|access-date=2017-07-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n'''Gear Cube Ultimate''': This cube is built exactly like the Gear Cube Extreme with only eight gears. The only difference is that it added [[Tony Fisher (puzzle designer)|Tony Fisher]] style stickers to the four inner pieces on each side, making it one step more difficult to correctly orient the six sides. A common issue while solving this cube is having the entire puzzle complete except for the newly added stickers being mismatched with different sides.<ref>{{Citation|last=RedKB|title=Gear Cube Extreme Unboxing|date=2010-10-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge5p_ndK0G8|accessdate=2017-07-23}}</ref>\n\n'''Even Less Gears''': The only 3x3 type of Gear Cube with a total of four gears. It takes another four gears out and replaces them with standard edges. As the number of gears get fewer and fewer, the difficulty level rises. So four sides can make 90° turns whereas the fifth and sixth sides are using the gear cogs giving only one option being a 180° turn.<ref>{{Citation|last=OskarPuzzle|title=Even Less Gears!|date=2010-12-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79p9vfqsquE|accessdate=2017-07-23}}</ref>\n\n'''Gear Ball''': This cube has two sets of edges. The outer edges are gear shaped with six teeth, and a black barrier on it. The inner edges are smaller and not circular, and only have too teeth. In addition, the corners have a three-pronged barrier. This cube is manufactured by [[Uwe Mèffert|Mefferts]], the inventor of the [[Pyraminx]].<ref>https://www.rubiks.com/store/puzzles/mefferts-gear-ball</ref>\n\n[[File:The Gear Ball.jpg|thumb|'''Gear Ball''']]\n\n=== Variants  ===\n* Gear Shift\n* Skewb Shift\n* Gear Egg\n* Gear Cube Extreme\n* Gear Cube Ultimate\n* Even Less Gears Cube\n* Gear Barrel\n* Gear MasterMorphix\n* Gear Pyraminx\n* Gear Minx\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Logic puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes]]"

The tiles were based upon a 5x5 matrix where the outer squares may be present or absent. The central 3x3 kernel was fixed. Initially the puzzle is assembled into a 2-dimensional, flat 2x3 piece rectangle fitted into a frame. The basic challenge is to construct a perfect, 6-sided [[cube]] out of these 6 pieces.\nUsually, there is only one way to fit the pieces into a complete cube and it can be reached with various levels of difficulty by trial and error.\n\n==Variations==\nThere are four families of Happy Cube puzzles, each containing 6 different cubes. Each family has a unique texture, style and difficulty level. Within each puzzle family the cubes are differentiared by color. The four families of Happy Cube puzzles are:\n* '''The Little Genius''' - Textured with various icons of foods, vehicles, emotions etc.'. These are the easiest cubes to build and are designed for children aged three to seven years.\n* '''The Happy Cube''' - Plainly colored with a single color each and with no texture, medium difficulty. These are the original cubes that were designed by the inventor in 1986.\n* '''The Profi Cube''' - Textured with two interleaving colors, slightly harder to build than the Happy Cubes. There are two versions of this family, the first is colored with one dominant color and a black background and the newer version is much more lighter in shade, replacing the black background with a second dominant color similar in shade to the first one.\n* '''The Marble Cube''' - Textures as colored marble, the hardest difficulty.\n\n==Solutions==\nThe basic challenge of the Happy Cubes puzzles is to construct a single perfect cube from the 6 pieces of a single puzzle which share the same color scheme and texture. A subsequent challenge to this is to fit the pieces back into the 2-dimensional frame from which they came.\n\nWith the presence of more than one puzzle available, pieces of several different cube puzzles can be joined together to make up larger and more complex structures other than the basic 6 faced cube. Some structures are more difficult to construct than others and the more pieces available, the easier it is to find a solution that makes a closed shape since there are more options of pieces to choose from. With enough pieces, virtually any structure imaginable can be constructed.\n\nTwo of the most popular complex structures are the 2×2×2 cube which is a perfect cube with each face made of 4 pieces (all in all, 24 pieces) and the Star structure, which is made of 6 cubes attached in a single-cube sized common centre (all in all, 30 pieces). Several computer applications exist to aid in the process of designing large structures and finding solutions for them automatically.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* [http://happycube.com Happy Cubes official site]\n* [http://www.cricro.com/inventor/index.html The inventor's home page]\n* [http://happysolver.sourceforge.net/ The Happy Cube Solver] An interactive application which solves happy cube puzzles and uses a 3D graphical user interface.\n* [http://thomer.com/wirrel/ Happy Cube (Wirrel Warrel) Solver] The first well-known Happy Cube Solver, using textual interface\n* [http://happycube.hu/ Happy Cube (official hungarian site)]\n\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes]]\n[[Category:Educational toys]]"

At first glance, the Helicopter Cube may seem like a combination of the [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]] and the [[Skewb]], but it actually cuts differently, and twists around cube edges rather than cube faces. The purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore them back to their original state of a single color per face.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[Image:Helicube-scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|Helicopter cube, scrambled]]\nThe Helicopter Cube is made in the shape of a cube, cut into 8 corner pieces and 24 face center pieces. Each corner piece has 3 colors, and each face center piece has only a single color. Unlike the Rubik's Cube, its faces do not rotate; rather, the pieces are scrambled by rotating around a cube edge.\n\nWhen twisting the puzzle, a 180° turn exchanges two corner pieces and swaps two pairs of face center pieces, but preserves the cube shape. The entire puzzle can be scrambled in this way.\n\nHowever, it is also possible to twist an edge by ~71°, such that the base of two groups of a corner piece and a face center piece each is aligned with the rotational plane of a different edge. The second edge can then be rotated, thus intermixing the corner pieces and the face center pieces and leaving the puzzle in a non-cubical shape. This kind of intermixing is known as a ''jumbling move''. Due to the differing shapes of the intermixed pieces, some rotations possible in the cubical shape may no longer be possible in the jumbled shape. By using a combination of such \"jumbling\" moves, it is possible to return to cubical shape but with some face center pieces in the wrong orientation, thus jutting outwards like spikes rather than lie flat on the face of the cube. More subtle changes may also be introduced, which are described later.\n\nThere are four variants of the Helicopter Cube:\n* the original Helicopter Cube, manufactured by The Twisty Store (sold also by [[Uwe Mèffert]]), consisting only of 8 corner pieces and 24 face center pieces;\n* the \"Curvy Copter\" by Tom van der Zanden,<ref name=\"zanden\"/> which has an additional 12 edge pieces with 2 colors each. This require the person to build around the edge pieces, whereas on the helicopter cube, these are hidden underneath, and it doesn't matter where you build around\n* the \"Curvy Copter Plus\", also created by Tom van der Zanden, with additional cuts in the middle of the face center pieces, allowing the puzzle to jumble even more;\n* the \"Helicopter Skewb\", also by Tom Van Der Zanden, which looks exactly the same as the original Helicopter Cube but it can also twist like the [[Skewb]].\n* the \"Curvy copter 3\",produced in 2014 by mf8\n\n:{|\n|[[Image:Helicube-jumbling-1.jpg|thumb|The ~71° turn in preparation for a jumbling move]]\n|[[Image:Helicube-jumbling-2.jpg|thumb|The start of a jumbling move]]\n|[[Image:Helicube-4.jpg|thumb|Thoroughly jumbled helicopter cube]]\n|}\n\n==Solutions==\n\n[[Image:Helicube-white.jpg|thumb|right|Mèffert's Helicopter Cube, white body, solved]]\nIf the puzzle is only scrambled using 180° twists, then it is obviously solvable using only 180° twists. However, if some jumbling moves were made, even if the puzzle was subsequently returned to cube shape, it may not be possible to solve it using only 180° twists. The reason for this is that using only 180° twists, each face center piece can only be permuted within a 6-member cycle, often referred to as its ''[[Orbit (group theory)|orbit]]''.<ref name=\"fan2cube\"/> Face center pieces in different orbits cannot be interchanged using only 180° twists. However, jumbling moves are able to permute face center pieces between different orbits, thus leaving the puzzle in a state that cannot be solved by 180° twists alone.\n\n==Number of combinations==\n\nAssume that Helicopter Cube is scrambled without jumbling moves (i.e. mixed with only 180 degree twists). Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving [[factorial|8!]]×3<sup>7</sup> combinations.\n\nThere are 24 face centers, which can be arranged in 24! different ways. But the face centers actually occur in 4 distinct orbits, each containing all colours. So the number of permutations is reduced to 6!<sup>4</sup> arrangements.<ref name=\"jaapsch\">{{cite web|url= http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/helicopter.htm|title= Helicopter Cube|last= Scherphuis|first= Jaap|date= 12 December 2017}}</ref> The permutation of the face centers is even, the number of permutations is divided by 2.\n\nAssuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centres. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centres which identify the cube's spatial orientation.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of\n:<math>\\frac{7!\\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 6!^4}{2}\\approx 4.94\\times 10^{17}.</math>\n\nThe expanded number is {{val|493694233804800000}} (approximately 494 billiard on the [[Names of large numbers|long scale]] or 494 quadrillion on the short scale)<ref name=\"fan2cube\"/>.\n\nWhen a Helicopter Cube is scrambled with jumbling moves but still retains its cube shape, then face centers do not occur in 4 distinct orbits. Assuming that the four centres of each colour are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(4!<sup>6</sup>) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given colour. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colours.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of\n:<math>\\frac{7!\\cdot 3^6 \\cdot 24!}{4!^6}.</math>\n\nThe expanded number is {{val|11928787020628077600000}} (approximately {{val|11929}} trillion or 12 trilliard on the long scale or 12 sextillion on the short scale)<ref name=\"jaapsch\"/>\n\nTo count non-cube positions, we need to count all the possible shapes (ignoring the colours). Counting those shapes is tricky, since sometimes moves are blocked purely due to the shape of the pieces rather than the underlying mechanism. Matt Galla has done a full analysis, and wrote up his results in [http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=28265 this post] on TwistyPuzzles Forum. I have reproduced and verified his results. He found 14,098 shapes, or 28,055 if mirror images are counted too. Some of these have symmetry however, and therefore occur in fewer than 24 (or 48) possible orientations. Here is a breakdown of those symmetries<ref name=\"jaapsch\"/>:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=right\n|colspan=2|\n|[[File:Mr4r3r2.gif|50px]]||[[File:Mr3r2.gif|50px]]||[[File:R3r2.gif|50px]]||[[File:Mfr2e.gif|50px]]||[[File:Mer2e.gif|50px]]||[[File:R2er2e.gif|50px]]||[[File:M4.gif|50px]]||[[File:Me.gif|50px]]||[[File:R2e.gif|50px]]||[[File:R2f.gif|50px]]||[[File:Mc.gif|50px]]||[[File:I.gif|50px]]\n|- align=right\n!rowspan=3|[[List of finite spherical symmetry groups|Sym.]]||\n|mr<sub>4</sub>r<sub>3</sub>r<sub>2</sub>||mr<sub>3</sub>r<sub>2</sub>||r<sub>3</sub>r<sub>2</sub>||m<sub>f</sub>r<sub>2e</sub>||m<sub>e</sub>r<sub>2e</sub>||r<sub>2e</sub>r<sub>2e</sub>||m<sub>4</sub>||m<sub>e</sub>||r<sub>2e</sub>||r<sub>2f</sub>||m<sub>c</sub>||i\n|rowspan=3|Total\n|- align=right\n![[Hermann–Mauguin notation|Intl]]\n||O<sub>h</sub>||D<sub>3d</sub>||D<sub>3</sub>||C<sub>2v</sub>||C<sub>2h</sub>||D<sub>2</sub>||S<sub>4</sub>||C<sub>s</sub>||C<sub>2</sub>||C<sub>2</sub>||S<sub>2</sub>||C<sub>1</sub>\n|- align=right\n![[Schönflies notation|Schön.]]\n||m{{overline|3}}m||{{overline|3}}m||322||mm2||2/m||222||{{overline|4}}||m||2||2||{{overline|1}}||1\n|- align=right\n!colspan=2|Order\n|48||12||6||4||4||4||4||2||2||2||2||1||\n|- align=right\n!colspan=2|Index\n||1||4||8||12||12||12||12||24||24||24||24||48||\n|- align=right\n!rowspan=2 colspan=2|Shapes<BR>mirror image\n||1||1||8||1||18||4||1||82||764||5||37||13,176||14,098\n|- align=right\n||1||1||16||1||18||8||1||82||1,528||10||37||26,352||28,055\n|- align=right\n!colspan=2|Total\n||1||4||128||12||216||96||12||1,968||36,672||240||888||1,264,896||1,305,133\n|}\n\nThe row marked Order shows the sizes of the symmetry groups.

Nichols was granted {{US patent|3655201}} on April 11, 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\n\nNichols assigned his [[patent]] to his employer Moleculon Research Corp., which sued [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal]] in 1982. In 1984, Ideal lost the patent infringement suit and appealed. In 1986, the appeals court affirmed the judgment that Rubik's 2×2×2 Pocket Cube infringed Nichols's patent, but overturned the judgment on Rubik's 3×3×3 Cube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital-law-online.info/cases/229PQ805.htm |title=Moleculon Research Corporation v.

This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent due to the lack of fixed centers.

More advanced methods combine multiple steps and require more algorithms. These algorithms designed for solving a 2x2x2 cube are often significantly shorter and faster than the algorithms one would use for solving a 3x3x3 cube. \n\nThe '''Ortega method,'''<ref>[http://www.cubewhiz.com/ortega.php Ortega method tutorial] by Bob Burton</ref> also called the Varasano method,<ref>[http://www.cyotheking.com/ortega/ What is Varasano?]</ref> is an intermediate method. First a face is built (but the pieces may be permuted incorrectly), then the last layer is oriented (OLL) and lastly both layers are permuted (PBL). The Ortega method requires a total of 12 algorithms.\n\nThe '''CLL method'''<ref>[http://www.cyotheking.com/cll2-2/ What is CLL?]</ref> first builds a layer (with correct permutation) and then solves the second layer in one step by using one of 42 algorithms.<ref>[http://www.cyotheking.com/cll2-2/ CLL tutorial] by Christopher Olson</ref> A more advanced version of CLL is the '''TCLL Method''' also known as Twisty CLL. One layer is built with correct permutation similarly to normal CLL, however one corner piece can be incorrectly orientated. The rest of the cube is solved, and the incorrect corner orientated in one step. There are 83 cases for TCLL, however algorithms have not been generated for solving all of them.<ref>[http://www.cyotheking.com/tcll What is Twisty CLL?]</ref>\n \n\nThe most advanced method is the '''EG method''',<ref>[https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/EG_Method Description of the EG method]</ref> named after Eric Gunner.  It also starts by building a layer (in any permutation), but then solves the rest of the puzzle in one step. It requires knowing 128 algorithms, 42 of which are the CLL algorithms.\n\n== World records ==\n[[File:1.55.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vicente Albíter of [[Mexico]] solving it in 1.55 seconds at the ''Mexican Open 2008'']]\n\nThe world record fastest solve is 0.49 seconds, set by Maciej Czapiewski of [[Poland]] on 20 March 2016 at Grudziądz Open 2016 in [[Grudziądz]], [[Poland]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 2x2x2 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=222&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 2x2x2 Cube].</ref>\n\nThe world record average of 5 solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 1.21 seconds, set by Martin Vædele Egdal of [[Denmark]] on 21 October 2018 at Kjeller Open 2018, in [[Kjeller]], [[Norway]], with the times (1.06), 1.09, (1.64), 1.47, and 1.07 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - 2x2x2 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=222&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 2x2x2 Cube].</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=222&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 2x2x2 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

All non-central pieces have extensions that fit into slots on the outer pieces of the 3×3×3, which keeps them from falling out of the cube while making a turn. The fixed centers have two sections (one visible, one hidden) which can turn independently. This feature is unique to the original design.<ref name=\"Krell patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4600199.html United States Patent 4600199]</ref>\n\nThe Eastsheen version of the puzzle uses a different mechanism. The fixed centers hold the centers next to the central edges in place, which in turn hold the outer edges. The non-central edges hold the corners in place, and the internal sections of the corner pieces do not reach the center of the cube.<ref name=\"Eastsheen patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/6129356.html United States Patent 6129356]</ref>\n\nThe V-Cube 5 mechanism, designed by Panagiotis Verdes, has elements in common with both. The corners reach to the center of the puzzle (like the original mechanism) and the center pieces hold the central edges in place (like the Eastsheen mechanism). The middle edges and center pieces adjacent to them make up the supporting frame and these have extensions which hold rest of the pieces together. This allows smooth and fast rotation and creating arguably the fastest and most durable version of the puzzle. Unlike the original 5×5×5 design, the V-Cube 5 mechanism was designed with [[speedcubing]] in mind.<ref name=\"Verdes patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:Professor's Cube disassembled.jpg|A disassembled Professor's Cube\nFile:V-Cube 5 disassembled.jpg|A disassembled V-Cube 5\nFile:Disassembled Eastsheen 5x5x5.jpg|A disassembled Eastsheen cube\n</gallery>\n\n===Durability===\n[[File:5×5×5 misaligned.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original cube with a misaligned center. This cannot occur on the Eastsheen or V-Cube puzzles.]]\nThe original Professor's Cube is inherently more delicate than the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube because of the much greater number of moving parts. Because of the fragile design, the Professor's Cube is not suitable for [[speedcubing]]. Applying excessive force to the cube when twisting it may result in broken pieces.<ref>[http://www.rubiks.com/Shop/Products/Rubiks%205x5%20Cube%20Hex%20Packaging.aspx Rubik's 5×5×5 Cube notice section]</ref>  Both the Eastsheen 5×5×5 and the V-Cube 5 are designed with different mechanisms in an attempt to remedy the fragility of the original design.\n\n==Permutations==\nThere are 98 pieces on the exterior of the cube: 8 corners, 36 edges, and 54 centers (48 movable, 6 fixed).\n\nAny [[permutation]] of the corners is possible, including odd permutations, giving [[factorial|8!]] possible arrangements. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (or 2,187) combinations.\n\nThere are 54 centers. Six of these (the center square of each face) are fixed in position. The rest consist of two sets of 24 centers. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the product of the permutations of the two sets, 24!<sup>2</sup>/(24<sup>12</sup>).\n\nThe 24 outer edges cannot be flipped, since the interior shape of those pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding outer edges are distinguishable, since the pieces are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements. The 12 central edges can be flipped. Eleven can be flipped and arranged independently, giving 12!/2 × 2<sup>11</sup> or 12! × 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities (an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the central edges, and vice versa, thus the division by 2). There are 24! × 12! × 2<sup>10</sup> possibilities for the inner and outer edges together.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of \n:<math>  \\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 24!^3}{24^{12}} \\approx 2.83 \\times 10^{74}</math>\n\nThe full number is precisely 282 870 942 277 741 856 536 180 333 107 150 328 293 127 731 985 672 134 721 536 000 000 000 000 000 possible permutations<ref name=\"Cubic Circular\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p18 Cubic Circular Issues 3 & 4] [[David Singmaster]], 1982</ref> (about 283 duodecillion on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 283 tresvigintillion on the short scale).\n\nSome variations of the Professor's Cube have one of the center pieces marked with a logo, which can be put into four different orientations. This increases the number of permutations by a factor of four to 1.13×10<sup>75</sup>, although any orientation of this piece could be regarded as correct. By comparison, the number of atoms in the [[observable universe]] is estimated at about 10<sup>80</sup>. Other variations increase the difficulty by making the orientation of all center pieces visible. An example of this is shown below.\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Rubik szétszedve.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original Professor's Cube with many of the pieces removed, showing the 3×3×3 equivalence of the remaining pieces]]\n[[File:3cubes.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Center is an EastSheen 5×5×5 cube with multicolored stickers, which increase difficulty because the centers need to be in correct places.]]\nPeople able to rapidly solve puzzles like this usually favour the reduction method of grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3×3×3 cube. As illustrated to the right, the fixed centers, middle edges and corners can be treated as equivalent to a 3×3×3 cube. As a result, once reduction is complete the parity errors sometimes seen on the 4×4×4 cannot occur on the 5×5×5, or any cube with an odd number of edges for that matter.\n\nAnother frequently used strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4×4×4 cube.\n\nA less frequently used strategy is to solve one side and one rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, and finally the last side and rim. That is, like building a  building. First the basement, then each floor, and finally the roof.<ref>[http://www.rubiks-cube.org Rubiks-Cube.org]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nThe world record fastest 5×5×5 solve is 36.06 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of the [[United States]] on 22 June, 2019 at CubingUSA Western Championship 2019, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe world record for average of five solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 39.65 seconds, also set by Max Park on 22 June, 2019 at CubingUSA Western Championship 2019 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], with the times of 40.34 (36.06) (42.65) 40.82 and 37.80 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe record fastest time for solving a 5×5×5 cube blindfolded is 2 minutes, 48.19 seconds (including inspection), set by Stanley Chapel of the United States on 23 June 2019 at Bulldog Qualifier 2019 in [[Uniontown, Ohio]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\nThe record for mean of three solves solving a 5x5x5 cube blindfolded is 3 minutes, 54.71 seconds (including inspection), set by Kaijun Lin (林恺俊) of [[China]] on 24 February 2018 at Singapore Cube Championship 2018 in [[Singapore]], with the times of 4:04.86, 3:52.71, and 3:46.56<ref name=\"Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded\" >[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=555bf&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 5x5x5 Blindfolded]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=555&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 5x5x5 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Similar puzzles have now been produced with various numbers of sides, dimensions, and stickers, not all of them by Rubik.\n\nAlthough the Rubik's Cube reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1980s, it is still widely known and used. Many [[speedcubing|speedcubers]] continue to practice it and similar puzzles; they also compete for the fastest times in various categories. Since 2003, the [[World Cube Association]], the Rubik's Cube's international governing body, has organised competitions worldwide and recognises world records.\n\n==Conception and development==\n\n===Similar precursors===\n[[File:Patent US3655201.png|thumb|Diagram from Nichols' patent showing a cube held together with magnets]]\n\nIn March 1970, [[Larry D. Nichols]] invented a 2×2×2 \"Puzzle with Pieces Rotatable in Groups\" and filed a Canadian patent application for it. Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted {{US patent|3655201}} on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his Cube.\n\nOn 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an \"amusement device\", a type of [[sliding puzzle]] on a spherical surface with \"at least two 3×3 arrays\" intended to be used for the game of [[noughts and crosses]]. He received his UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.<ref name=frankfoxpatent>{{cite web|title=Patent Specification 1344259|url=http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/patents/gb1344259.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Rubik's invention===\n[[File:1980-Rubik's-Cube.jpg|thumb|Packaging of Rubik's Cube, Toy of the year 1980–Ideal Toy Corp., made in Hungary]]\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the [[Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design|Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts]] in Budapest.<ref name=\"ampop\">{{Cite book|author=Kelly Boyer Sagert |title=The 1970s (American Popular Culture Through History) |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn |year=2007 |page=130 |isbn=0-313-33919-8}}</ref> Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart.

Magic Cube was held together with interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle being easily pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's [[Nuremberg]] Toy Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it.<ref name=\"holper\">{{Cite book|last=Holper|first=Paul|title=Inventing Millions|year=2006|pages=64–5|publisher=Orient|isbn=8122204589}}</ref> It was noticed by Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer and they signed a deal with [[Ideal Toy Company|Ideal Toys]] in September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide.<ref name=\"holper\"/> Ideal wanted at least a recognisable name to trademark; of course, that arrangement put Rubik in the spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980. The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris, Nuremberg and New York in January and February 1980. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyorgykata.hu/design/rubik/demo/cubehistory.html|title=History |publisher=Rubiks |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=25 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy shop shelves of the West was briefly halted so that it could be manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications.

The puzzle consists of twenty-six unique miniature cubes, also called \"cubies\" or \"cubelets\". Each of these includes a concealed inward extension that interlocks with the other cubes while permitting them to move to different locations. However, the centre cube of each of the six faces is merely a single square façade; all six are affixed to the core mechanism. These provide structure for the other pieces to fit into and rotate around. So there are twenty-one pieces: a single core piece consisting of three intersecting axes holding the six centre squares in place but letting them rotate, and twenty smaller plastic pieces which fit into it to form the assembled puzzle.\n\nEach of the six centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by the centre piece, a \"3D cross\". A spring between each screw head and its corresponding piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the \"feel\" of the Cube. Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.\n\nThe Cube can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by rotating the top layer by 45° and then prying one of its edge cubes away from the other two layers. Consequently, it is a simple process to \"solve\" a Cube by taking it apart and reassembling it in a solved state.\n\nThere are six central pieces which show one coloured face, twelve edge pieces which show two coloured faces, and eight corner pieces which show three coloured faces. Each piece shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting an outer third of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares. However, Cubes with alternative colour arrangements also exist; for example, with the yellow face opposite the green, the blue face opposite the white, and red and orange remaining opposite each other.\n\n[[Douglas Hofstadter]], in the July 1982 issue of ''Scientific American'', pointed out that Cubes could be coloured in such a way as to emphasise the corners or edges, rather than the faces as the standard colouring does; but neither of these alternative colourings has ever become popular.<ref name=\"hofstadter\"/>\n\n==Mathematics==\n\nThe puzzle was originally advertised as having \"over 3,000,000,000 (three [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]) combinations but only one solution\".<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkhA3RO5fU|title=Rubik's Cube Commercial 1981|last=TELEVISIONARCHIVES|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=10 October 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref>  Depending on how combinations are counted, the actual number can be significantly higher.\n\n===Permutations===\n[[File:Rubik's cube colors.svg|thumb|The current colour scheme of a Rubik's Cube]]\nThe original (3×3×3) Rubik's Cube has eight corners and twelve edges. There are [[factorial|8!]] (40,320) ways to arrange the corner cubes. Each corner has three possible orientations, although only seven (of eight) can be oriented independently; the orientation of the eighth (final) corner depends on the preceding seven, giving 3<sup>7</sup> (2,187) possibilities. There are 12!/2 (239,500,800) ways to arrange the edges, restricted from 12! because edges must be in an [[even permutation]] exactly when the corners are. (When arrangements of centres are also permitted, as described below, the rule is that the combined arrangement of corners, edges, and centres must be an even permutation.) Eleven edges can be flipped independently, with the flip of the twelfth depending on the preceding ones, giving 2<sup>11</sup> (2,048) possibilities.<ref>Martin Schönert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^7 \\times (12!/2) \\times 2^{11}} = 43,252,003,274,489,856,000</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 43 [[quintillion]].<ref name=\"Vaughen\">[http://faculty.mc3.edu/cvaughen/rubikscube/cube_counting.ppt Counting the Permutations of the Rubik's Cube], Scott Vaughen.

If one considers permutations reached through disassembly of the cube, the number becomes twelve times larger:\n:<math> {8! \\times 3^8 \\times 12! \\times 2^{12}} = 519,024,039,293,878,272,000.</math>\n\nwhich is approximately 519 quintillion<ref name=\"Vaughen\"/> possible arrangements of the pieces that make up the Cube, but only one in twelve of these are actually solvable. This is because there is no sequence of moves that will swap a single pair of pieces or rotate a single corner or edge cube. Thus there are twelve possible sets of reachable configurations, sometimes called \"universes\" or \"[[orbit (group theory)|orbits]]\", into which the Cube can be placed by dismantling and reassembling it.\n\nThe preceding numbers assume the center faces are in a fixed position.  If one considers turning the whole cube to be a different permutation, then each of the preceding numbers should be multiplied by 24.  A chosen color can be on one of six sides, and then one of the adjacent colors can be in one of four positions; this determines the positions of all remaining colors.\n\n===Centre faces===\nThe original Rubik's Cube had no orientation markings on the centre faces (although some carried the words \"Rubik's Cube\" on the centre square of the white face), and therefore solving it does not require any attention to orienting those faces correctly. However, with marker pens, one could, for example, mark the central squares of an unscrambled Cube with four coloured marks on each edge, each corresponding to the colour of the adjacent face; a cube marked in this way is referred to as a \"supercube\". Some Cubes have also been produced commercially with markings on all of the squares, such as the [[Lo Shu Square|Lo Shu]] [[magic square]] or [[playing card]] [[suit (cards)|suits]]. Cubes have also been produced where the nine stickers on a face are used to make a single larger picture, and centre orientation matters on these as well. Thus one can nominally solve a Cube yet have the markings on the centres rotated; it then becomes an additional test to solve the centres as well.\n\nMarking the Rubik's Cube's centres increases its difficulty because this expands the set of distinguishable possible configurations. There are 4<sup>6</sup>/2 (2,048) ways to orient the centres since an even permutation of the corners implies an even number of quarter turns of centres as well. In particular, when the Cube is unscrambled apart from the orientations of the central squares, there will always be an even number of centre squares requiring a quarter turn. Thus orientations of centres increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 43,252,003,274,489,856,000 (4.3×10<sup>19</sup>) to 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×10<sup>22</sup>).<ref>''Scientific American'', p28, '''vol 246''', 1982 [https://books.google.com/books?id=vDo7AAAAMAAJ&q=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&dq=orientations+of+face+centers+matter&lr=&pgis=1 retrieved online] 29 January 2009.</ref>\n\nWhen turning a cube over is considered to be a change in permutation then we must also count arrangements of the centre faces. Nominally there are 6! ways to arrange the six centre faces of the cube, but only 24 of these are achievable without disassembly of the cube. When the orientations of centres are also counted, as above, this increases the total number of possible Cube permutations from 88,580,102,706,155,225,088,000 (8.9×10<sup>22</sup>) to 2,125,922,464,947,725,402,112,000 (2.1×10<sup>24</sup>).\n\n===Algorithms===\nIn Rubik's cubers' parlance, a memorised sequence of moves that has a desired effect on the cube is called an algorithm. This terminology is derived from the mathematical use of ''[[algorithm]]'', meaning a list of well-defined instructions for performing a task from a given initial state, through well-defined successive states, to a desired end-state. Each method of solving the Rubik's Cube employs its own set of algorithms, together with descriptions of what effect the algorithm has, and when it can be used to bring the cube closer to being solved.\n\nMany algorithms are designed to transform only a small part of the cube without interfering with other parts that have already been solved so that they can be applied repeatedly to different parts of the cube until the whole is solved. For example, there are well-known algorithms for cycling three corners without changing the rest of the puzzle or flipping the orientation of a pair of edges while leaving the others intact.\n\nSome algorithms do have a certain desired effect on the cube (for example, swapping two corners) but may also have the side-effect of changing other parts of the cube (such as permuting some edges). Such algorithms are often simpler than the ones without side-effects and are employed early on in the solution when most of the puzzle has not yet been solved and the side-effects are not important. Most are long and difficult to memorise. Towards the end of the solution, the more specific (and usually more complicated) algorithms are used instead.\n\n===Relevance and application of mathematical group theory===\nRubik's Cube lends itself to the application of [[Rubik's Cube group|mathematical group theory]], which has been helpful for deducing certain algorithms – in particular, those which have a ''[[commutator]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>−1</sup>''Y''<sup>−1</sup> (where ''X'' and ''Y'' are specific moves or move-sequences and ''X''<sup>−1</sup> and ''Y''<sup>−1</sup> are their respective inverses), or a ''[[Conjugation (group theory)|conjugate]]'' structure, namely ''XYX''<sup>−1</sup>, often referred to by speedcubers colloquially as a \"setup move\".<ref name=\"Singmaster\"/> In addition, the fact that there are well-defined [[subgroup]]s within the [[Rubik's Cube group]] enables the puzzle to be learned and mastered by moving up through various self-contained \"levels of difficulty\". For example, one such \"level\" could involve solving cubes which have been scrambled using only 180-degree turns. These subgroups are the principle underlying the computer cubing methods by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite]] and [[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube#Kociemba's algorithm|Kociemba]], which solve the cube by further reducing it to another subgroup.\n\n==Solutions==\n\n===Move notation===\nMany 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube enthusiasts use a notation developed by [[David Singmaster]] to denote a sequence of moves, referred to as \"Singmaster notation\".<ref name=\"advgroup\">{{Cite book|author=Joyner, David |title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |page=7 |isbn=0-8018-6947-1}}</ref> Its relative nature allows [[algorithms]] to be written in such a way that they can be applied regardless of which side is designated the top or how the colours are organised on a particular cube.\n* ''F'' (Front): the side currently facing the solver\n* ''B'' (Back): the side opposite the front\n* ''U'' (Up): the side above or on top of the front side\n* ''D'' (Down): the side opposite the top, underneath the Cube\n* ''L'' (Left): the side directly to the left of the front\n* ''R'' (Right): the side directly to the right of the front\n* ''ƒ'' (Front two layers): the side facing the solver and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''b'' (Back two layers): the side opposite the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''u'' (Up two layers): the top side and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''d'' (Down two layers): the bottom layer and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''l'' (Left two layers): the side to the left of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''r'' (Right two layers): the side to the right of the front and the corresponding middle layer\n* ''x'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''R''\n* ''y'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''U''\n* ''z'' (rotate): rotate the entire Cube on ''F''\n\nWhen a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (&nbsp;′&nbsp;) follows a letter, it denotes an anticlockwise face turn; while a letter without a prime symbol denotes a clockwise turn. These directions are as one is looking at the specified face.  A letter followed by a&nbsp;2 (occasionally a superscript&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>) denotes two turns, or a 180-degree turn. ''R'' is right side clockwise, but ''R′'' is right side anticlockwise. The letters ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are used to indicate that the entire Cube should be turned about one of its axes, corresponding to R, U, and F turns respectively. When ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'' are primed, it is an indication that the cube must be rotated in the opposite direction. When they are squared, the cube must be rotated 180 degrees. <!-- Which axis (x, y, z) is which? user Nikevich -->\n\nThe most common deviation from Singmaster notation, and in fact the current official standard, is to use \"w\", for \"wide\", instead of lowercase letters to represent moves of two layers; thus, a move of ''Rw'' is equivalent to one of ''r''.<ref name=wcarules>{{cite web|title=World Cube Association Competition Regulations|url=http://worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor methods using middle-layer turns (particularly corners-first methods) there is a generally accepted \"MES\" extension to the notation where letters ''M'', ''E'', and ''S'' denote middle layer turns. It was used e.g. in Marc Waterman's Algorithm.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Treep |first1=Anneke |last2=Waterman |first2=Marc |title=Marc Waterman's Algorithm, Part 2 |series=Cubism For Fun 15 |year=1987 |publisher=Nederlandse Kubus Club |page=10}}</ref>\n* ''M'' (Middle): the layer between L and R, turn direction as L (top-down)\n* ''E'' (Equator): the layer between U and D, turn direction as D (left-right)\n* ''S'' (Standing): the layer between F and B, turn direction as F\n\nThe 4×4×4 and larger cubes use an extended notation to refer to the additional middle layers. Generally speaking, uppercase letters (''F B U D L R'') refer to the outermost portions of the cube (called faces). Lowercase letters (''f b u d l r'') refer to the inner portions of the cube (called slices). An asterisk (L*), a number in front of it (2L), or two layers in parentheses (Ll), means to turn the two layers at the same time (both the inner and the outer left faces) For example: (''Rr'')<nowiki>'</nowiki>&nbsp;''l''2&nbsp;''f''<nowiki>'</nowiki> means to turn the two rightmost layers anticlockwise, then the left inner layer twice, and then the inner front layer anticlockwise. By extension, for cubes of 6×6×6 and larger, moves of three layers are notated by the number 3, for example, 3L.\n\nAn alternative notation, Wolstenholme notation,<ref>http://www.topaccolades.com/notation/rubikscube.htm Wolstenholme notation</ref> is designed to make memorising sequences of moves easier for novices.  This notation uses the same letters for faces except it replaces U with T (top), so that all are consonants.  The key difference is the use of the vowels O, A and I for cl'''o'''ckwise, '''a'''nticlockwise and tw'''i'''ce (180-degree) turns, which results in word-like sequences such as LOTA RATO LATA ROTI (equivalent to LU′R′UL′U′RU2 in Singmaster notation). Addition of a C implies rotation of the entire cube, so ROC is the clockwise rotation of the cube around its right face. Middle layer moves are denoted by adding an M to corresponding face move, so RIM means a 180-degree turn of the middle layer adjacent to the R face.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1981 book [[The Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube]]. Singmaster notation was not widely known at the time of publication. The faces were named Top (T), Bottom (B), Left (L), Right (R), Front (F) and Posterior (P), with + for clockwise, – for anticlockwise and 2 for 180-degree turns.\n\nAnother notation appeared in the 1982 \"The Ideal Solution\" book for Rubik's Revenge. Horizontal planes were noted as tables, with table 1 or T1 starting at the top. Vertical front to back planes were noted as book, with book 1 or B1 starting from the left. Vertical left to right planes were noted as windows, with window 1 or W1 starting at the front. Using the front face as a reference view, table moves were left or right, book moves were up or down, and window moves were clockwise or anticlockwise.\n\n===Optimal solutions===\n{{Main article|Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube}}\n[[File:1982 expedition to Tartu Ülikool 350 (23).jpg|thumb|[[Mountaineering|Mountaineer]] solving Rubik's Cube during 1982 expedition in [[Pamir Mountains]] to peak [[Tartu Ülikool 350]]]]\n\nAlthough there are a significant number of possible permutations for the Rubik's Cube, a number of solutions have been developed which allow solving the cube in well under 100 moves.\n\nMany general solutions for the Rubik's Cube have been discovered independently. [[David Singmaster]] first published his solution in the book ''Notes on Rubik's \"Magic Cube\"'' in 1981.<ref name = \"Singmaster\">{{cite book|last=Singmaster|first=David|title=Notes on Rubik's Magic Cube|year=1981|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-907395-00-7|location=Harmondsworth, Eng}}</ref> This solution involves solving the Cube layer by layer, in which one layer (designated the top) is solved first, followed by the middle layer, and then the final and bottom layer. After sufficient practice, solving the Cube layer by layer can be done in under one minute. Other general solutions include \"corners first\" methods or combinations of several other methods. In 1982, David Singmaster and Alexander Frey hypothesised that the number of moves needed to solve the Rubik's Cube, given an ideal algorithm, might be in \"the low twenties\".<ref>{{cite book |title= Handbook of Cubik Math|last= Frey, Jr.|first= Alexander H.|author2= Singmaster, David|year=1982 |publisher= Enslow Publishers|location= Hillside, N.J|isbn= 0-89490-058-7}}</ref> In 2007, Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman used computer search methods to demonstrate that any 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube configuration can be solved in 26 moves or fewer.<ref name=D.Kunkle>{{cite conference\n | first = D.\n | last = Kunkle\n | author2 = Cooperman, C.\n | title = Twenty-Six Moves Suffice for Rubik's Cube\n | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC '07)\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = ACM Press\n | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/papers/rubik.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference\n | last = KFC\n | title = Rubik's cube proof cut to 25 moves\n | year = 2008\n | url = http://arxivblog.com/?p=332\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://blog.sciencenews.org/mathtrek/2007/08/cracking_the_cube.html\n|title=Cracking the Cube\n|author=Julie J.

This method is called [[CFOP]] standing for \"cross, F2L, OLL, PLL\".  It is similar to the layer-by-layer method but employs the use of a large number of algorithms, especially for orienting and permuting the last layer. The cross is done first, followed by first layer corners and second layer edges simultaneously, with each corner paired up with a second-layer edge piece, thus completing the first two layers (F2L). This is then followed by [[Orientation (geometry)|orienting]] the last layer, then [[permutation|permuting]] the last layer (OLL and PLL respectively). [[Fridrich Method|Fridrich's solution]] requires learning roughly 120 algorithms but allows the Cube to be solved in only 55 moves on average.\n\nA now well-known method was developed by [[Lars Petrus]]. In this method, a 2×2×2 section is solved first, followed by a 2×2×3, and then the incorrect edges are solved using a three-move algorithm, which eliminates the need for a possible 32-move algorithm later. The principle behind this is that in layer-by-layer, one must constantly break and fix the completed layer(s); the 2×2×2 and 2×2×3 sections allow three or two layers (respectively) to be turned without ruining progress. One of the advantages of this method is that it tends to give solutions in fewer moves. For this reason, the method is also popular for fewest move competitions.<ref name=larspatrus>{{cite web|url=https://lar5.com/cube/ |title=Rubik's Cube Solution - Petrus Method |publisher=lar5.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Roux Method, developed by [[Gilles Roux]], is similar to the Petrus method in that it relies on block building rather than layers, but derives from corners-first methods. In Roux, a 3×2×1 block is solved, followed by another 3×2×1 on the opposite side. Next, the corners of the top layer are solved. The cube can then be solved using only moves of the U layer and M slice.<ref name=rouxmeth>{{cite web|url=http://grrroux.free.fr/method/Intro.html |title=Introduction |publisher=Grrroux.free.fr |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Beginners' methods===\nMost beginner solution methods involve solving the cube one layer at a time, using algorithms that preserve what has already been solved. The easiest layer by layer methods require only 3–8 algorithms.<ref>{{cite web|title=How to solve a Rubik's Cube|url=https://how-to-solve-a-rubix-cube.com/|publisher=how-to-solve-a-rubix-cube.com|accessdate=28 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Beginner Solution to the Rubik's Cube (available in multiple languages)|url=http://ozcubegirl.com/rubikscubesolution.html|publisher=Jasmine Lee|accessdate=17 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, thirteen-year-old Patrick Bossert developed a solution for solving the cube, along with a graphical notation, designed to be easily understood by novices.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0beD5LVNugC&pg=PA802|title=Restore your cube|first=Rob|last=Evans|date=24 September 1981|work=New Scientist|p=802}}</ref> It was subsequently published as ''You Can Do The Cube'' and became a best-seller.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yvomAQAAIAAJ&q=%22you+can+do+the+cube%22&dq=%22you+can+do+the+cube%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4gpdU-qgG8yI7AalwYCoBQ&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCQ|work=Newsweek|volume=99|page=16|title=Rubik's Cube}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Denny Dedmore published a solution described using diagrammatic icons representing the moves to be made, instead of the usual notation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helm.lu/cube/solutions/rubikscube/ |title=Website with solutions created by Denny Dedmore |publisher=Helm.lu |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Marshall's ''The Ultimate Solution to Rubik's Cube'' takes a different approach, averaging only 65 twists yet requiring the memorisation of only ''two'' algorithms.

Their recorded time for this event includes both the time spent memorizing the cube and the time spent manipulating it.\n\nIn Multiple Blindfolded, all of the cubes are memorised, and then all of the cubes are solved once blindfolded; thus, the main challenge is memorising many&nbsp;– often ten or more&nbsp;– separate cubes. The event is scored not by time but by the number of points achieved after the one hour time limit has elapsed. The number of points achieved is equal to the number of cubes solved correctly, minus the number of cubes unsolved after the end of the attempt, where a greater number of points is better. If multiple competitors achieve the same number of points, rankings are assessed based on the total time of the attempt, with a shorter time being better.\n\nIn Fewest Moves solving, the contestant is given one hour to find a solution and must write it down.\n\n===Records===\n* Single time: The world record time for solving a 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube is 3.47 seconds, held by Du Yusheng of China, on November 24th, 2018 in Wuhu Open 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/e.php?i=333|title=World Cube Association - Official Results|last=Team|first=WCA Website|website=www.worldcubeassociation.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}</ref>\n* Average time: The world record average of the middle three of five solve times (which excludes the fastest and slowest) is 5.69 seconds, set by [[Feliks Zemdegs]] of Australia at the Koalafication Brisbane 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=333&regionId=&years=&show=100+Results&average=Average|title=World Cube Association – Official Results|first=WCA Website|last=Team|website=''worldcubeassociation.org''|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref>\n* One-handed solving: The world record fastest one-handed solve is 6.88 seconds, set by [[Feliks Zemdegs]] of Australia on 10 May 2015 at Canberra Autumn 2015.

One of the newest 3×3×3 Cube variants is the Rubik's TouchCube. Sliding a finger across its faces causes its patterns of coloured lights to rotate the same way they would on a mechanical cube. The TouchCube also has buttons for hints and self-solving, and it includes a charging stand.

Some such shapes include the [[tetrahedron]] ([[Pyraminx]]), the [[octahedron]] ([[Skewb Diamond]]), the [[dodecahedron]] ([[Megaminx]]), the [[icosahedron]] ([[Dogic]]). There are also puzzles that change shape such as [[Rubik's Snake]] and the [[Square One (puzzle)|Square One]].\n\nIn 2011, [[Guinness World Records]] awarded the \"largest order Rubiks magic cube\" to a 17×17×17 cube, made by [[Oskar van Deventer]].<ref name=\"largestguinness\">{{cite web |title=Largest Order Rubiks / Magic Cube |work=Guinness World Records |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/11000/largest-order-rubiks-magic-cube |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=van Deventer|first=Oskar|title=Over the Top – 17x17x17|url=http://www.shapeways.com/model/64058/over-the-top-17x17x17.html}}</ref> On 2 December 2017, [[Grégoire Pfennig]] announced that he had broken this record, with a 33×33×33 cube, and that his claim had been submitted to Guinness for verification.<ref name=\"cube33\"/> On 8 April 2018, Grégoire Pfennig announced another world record, the 2x2x50 cube.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtIP3lmQHXg|title=World Record 2x2x50 Rubik's Cube !!! :D|last=Greg's Puzzles|date=8 April 2018|accessdate=13 April 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> Whether this is a replacement for the 33x33x33 record, or an additional record, remains to be seen.\n\n[[File:Rubiks Platonic Solids.jpg|thumb|All five platonic solids represented by twisty puzzles]]\n\nSome puzzles have also been created in the shape of the [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]], such as [[Alexander's Star]] (a [[great dodecahedron]]). Grégoire Pfennig has also created at least one puzzle in the shape of a [[small stellated dodecahedron]].\n\n===Custom-built puzzles===\n[[File:Novelty Keychain Rubiks Cube.JPG|thumb|Novelty keychain]]\n\nPuzzles have been built resembling the Rubik's Cube or based on its inner workings. For example, a cuboid is a puzzle based on the Rubik's Cube, but with different functional dimensions, such as 2×2×4, 2×3×4, and 3×3×5.<ref>Martin, W. Eric. \"Gamebits: Rubik's Cube... Cubed\". ''[[Games (magazine)|Games]]''. Issue 199 (Vol. 28 No. 3). p. 4. April 2004.</ref> Many cuboids are based on 4×4×4 or 5×5×5 mechanisms, via building plastic extensions or by directly modifying the mechanism itself.\n\nSome custom puzzles are not derived from any existing mechanism, such as the Gigaminx v1.5-v2, Bevel Cube, SuperX, Toru, Rua, and 1×2×3. These puzzles usually have a set of masters 3D printed, which then are copied using moulding and casting techniques to create the final puzzle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nOther Rubik's Cube modifications include cubes that have been extended or truncated to form a new shape. An example of this is the Trabjer's Octahedron, which can be built by truncating and extending portions of a regular 3×3. Most shape mods can be adapted to higher-order cubes. In the case of [[Tony Fisher (puzzle designer)|Tony Fisher's]] Rhombic Dodecahedron, there are 3×3, 4×4, 5×5, and 6×6 versions of the puzzle.\n\n=== Rubik's Cube software ===\n[[Puzzle]]s like the Rubik's Cube can be simulated by [[computer software]], which provide functions such as recording of player metrics, storing scrambled Cube positions, conducting online competitions, analysing of move sequences, and converting between different move [[notation]]s. Software can also simulate very large puzzles that are impractical to build, such as 100×100×100 and 1,000×1,000×1,000 cubes, as well as virtual puzzles that cannot be physically built, such as 4- and 5-dimensional analogues of the cube.<ref>{{cite web|author=Melinda Green |url=http://www.superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm |title=Magic Cube 4D |publisher=Superliminal.com |date=25 June 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gravitation3d.com/magiccube5d |title=Magic Cube 5D |publisher=Gravitation3d.com |accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"185px\">\nFile:4-cube 4^4.png|Magic Cube 4D, a [[Tesseract|4×4×4×4]] virtual puzzle\nFile:5D Rubik's Cube.png|Magic Cube 5D, a 3×3×3×3×3 virtual puzzle\nFile:4d cube.png|high-dimensional Octagon Magic Cube Puzzle simulated phone application\nFile:4-cube 2^4 highlighted.png|4D virtual 2x2x2x2 sequential move puzzle\n</gallery>\n\n===Chrome Cube Lab===\nGoogle has released the Chrome Cube Lab in association with<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Calvin|last2=Goldstine|first2=Susan|date=September 2014|title=Review: Beyond Rubik's Cube Exhibit|journal=The College Mathematics Journal|volume=45|pages=254–256|doi=10.4169/college.math.j.45.4.254|jstor=10.4169/college.math.j.45.4.254}}</ref> [[Ernő Rubik]].

It was released in 1981. Invented by Péter Sebestény, the Rubik's Revenge was nearly called the '''Sebestény Cube''' until a somewhat last-minute decision changed the puzzle's name to attract fans of the original Rubik's Cube.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://algana.com/DMFB&C/rubix_cube1.php | title=Rubik's Cube How to Play | publisher=DMFB&C | accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref> Unlike the original puzzle (and the [[Professor's Cube|5×5×5 cube]]), it has no fixed facets: the centre facets (four per face) are free to move to different positions.\n\nMethods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 4×4×4 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colours &mdash; since the centre facets can no longer be used for identification.\n\n==Mechanics==\n[[File:Rubiks revenge scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|Rubik's Revenge in scrambled state]]\n[[File:Rubiks Revenge 1982.jpg|thumb|right|Early Rubik's Revenge cube, with white opposite blue, and green opposite yellow]]\n[[File:Eastsheen vs. Rubik 4x4.jpg|thumb|An Eastsheen cube is on the left, and an official Rubik's Revenge is on the right.]]\n[[File:Unassembled Rubik's Revenge.JPG|thumb|A disassembled Rubik's Revenge, showing all the pieces and central ball]]\n[[File:Disassembled Eastsheen 4×4×4.jpg|thumb|A disassembled Eastsheen 4×4×4]]\nThe puzzle consists of 56 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. These consist of 24 centres which show one colour each, 24 edges which show two colours each, and 8 corners which show three colours each. The original Rubik's Revenge can be taken apart without much difficulty, typically by turning one side through a 30° angle and prying an edge upward until it dislodges. \n\nThe original mechanism designed by Sebestény uses a grooved ball to hold the centre pieces in place. The edge pieces are held in place by the centres and the corners are held in place by the edges, much like the original cube. There are three mutually perpendicular grooves for the centre pieces to slide through. Each groove is only wide enough to allow one row of centre pieces to slide through it. The ball is shaped to prevent the centre pieces of the other row from sliding, ensuring that the ball remains aligned with the outside of the cube. Turning one of the centre layers moves either just that layer or the ball as well.<ref name=\"Sebestény patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4421311.html United States Patent 4421311]</ref>\n\nThe Eastsheen version of the cube, which is slightly smaller at 6cm to an edge, has a completely different mechanism. Its mechanism is very similar to Eastsheen's version of the Professor's cube, instead of the ball-core mechanism. There are 42 pieces (36 movable and six fixed) completely hidden within the cube, corresponding to the centre rows on the Professor's Cube. This design is more durable than the original and also allows for screws to be used to tighten or loosen the cube. The central spindle is specially shaped to prevent it from becoming misaligned with the exterior of the cube.<ref name=\"Eastsheen patent\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5992850.html United States Patent 5992850]</ref>\n\nThere are 24 edge pieces which show two coloured sides each, and eight corner pieces which show three colours. Each corner piece or pair of edge pieces shows a unique colour combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, if red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the cube, but the location of the coloured sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the centre squares and the distribution of colour combinations on edge and corner pieces. \n\nFor most recent Cubes, the colours of the stickers are red opposite orange, yellow opposite white, and green opposite blue. However, there also exist Cubes with alternative colour arrangements (yellow opposite green, blue opposite white and red opposite orange).  The Eastsheen version has purple (opposite red) instead of orange.\n\n===Permutations===\n[[File:Rubiks revenge tilt.jpg|thumb|none|Rubik's Revenge with a tilted side]]\nThere are 8 corners, 24 edges and 24 centres.\n\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving [[factorial|8!]]×3<sup>7</sup> combinations. \n\nThere are 24 centres, which can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centres of each colour are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given colour. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colours. An odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of the centres and vice versa; however, even and odd permutations of the centres are indistinguishable due to the identical appearance of the pieces.<ref name=\"Cubic Circular 7 & 8\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic7.htm#p11 Cubic Circular Issue 7 & 8] [[David Singmaster]], 1985</ref> There are several ways to make the centre pieces distinguishable, which would make an odd centre permutation visible.\n\nThe 24 edges cannot be flipped, because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical. Corresponding edges are distinguishable, since they are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements, independently of the corners or centres.\n\nAssuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because all 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centres. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centres which identify the cube's spatial orientation.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of \n:<math>\\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 24!^2}{24^7} \\approx 7.40 \\times 10^{45}.</math>\n\nThe full number is {{val|7401196841564901869874093974498574336000000000}} possible permutations<ref name=\"Cubic Circular 3 & 4\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p14 Cubic Circular Issues 3 & 4] [[David Singmaster]], 1982</ref> (about {{val|7401}} septillion or 7.4 septilliard on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 7.4 quattuordecillion on the short scale).\n\nSome versions of Rubik's Revenge have one of the centre pieces marked with a logo, distinguishing it from the other three of the same colour. This increases the number of distinguishable permutations by a factor of four to 2.96×10<sup>46</sup>, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.\n\n==Solutions==\nThere are several methods that can be used to solve a Rubik's Revenge.  The most common method is '''reduction''', so called because it effectively reduces the 4×4×4 to a 3×3×3.  Cubers first group the centre pieces of common colours together, then pair edges that show the same two colours.  Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3×3×3 cube.  However, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3×3×3 cube may be reached.  There are two possible problems not found on the 3×3×3.  The first is two edge pieces reversed on one edge, resulting in the colours for that edge not matching the rest of the cubies on either face (OLL parity): \n{{Rubik's Revenge face\n   |r| | |r\n |y| |r|r| |g\n |y| | | | |g\n |y| | | | |g\n |y| | | | |g\n   |b|b|b|b\n|10px}} Notice that these two edge pieces are swapped. The second is two edge pairs being swapped with each other (PLL parity), may be two corners swapped instead depending on situation and/or method: \n{{Rubik's Revenge face\n   |r|y|y|r\n |y| | | | |g\n |r| | | | |g\n |r| | | | |g\n |y| | | | |g\n   |b|b|b|b\n|10px}}  These situations are known as [[Parity of a permutation|parity]] errors.  These positions are still solvable; however, special algorithms must be applied to fix the errors.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morris|first=Frank|title=solving the revenge|url=http://bigcubes.com/4×4×4/4×4×4.html|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above.  For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centres last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the centre pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centres by cycling 3 face centres, two of which are visually identical.\n\nParity occurs on all cubes with an even number of edges from the 4x4x4 onwards. It does not, however, occur on cubes with an odd number of edges, such as the 3x3x3 and the 5x5x5. This is due to the fact that the latter have fixed center pieces and the former do not.\n\nDirect solving of a 4×4×4 is uncommon, but possible, with methods such as K4. Doing so mixes a variety of techniques and is heavily reliant on commutators for the final steps.<ref name=k4>{{cite web|last=Barlow|first=Thom|title=K4 Method|url=http://snk.digibase.ca/k4/index.htm|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nSome algorithms of Rubik's revenge are:\n\n1.

      "text": "\n[[Image:Skewb.jpg|thumb|The Skewb in scrambled state\n[[Image:Permutohedron order 3.svg|thumb|The four turning planes of the Skewb bisect it as shown in this figure.]]\nThe '''Skewb''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|k|juː|b}}) is a [[combination puzzle]] and a [[mechanical puzzle]] in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was invented by Tony Durham and marketed by [[Uwe Mèffert]]. Although it is cubical in shape, it differs from Rubik's construction in that its axes of rotation pass through the corners of the cube rather than the centres of the faces. There are four such axes, one for each [[space diagonal]] of the cube. As a result, it is a ''deep-cut'' puzzle in which each twist affects all six faces.\n\nMèffert's original name for this puzzle was the ''Pyraminx Cube'', to emphasize that it was part of a series including his first tetrahedral puzzle [[Pyraminx]]. The catchier name Skewb was coined by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in his ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' column, and Mèffert liked it enough not only to market the Pyraminx Cube under this name but also to name some of his other puzzles after it, such as the [[Skewb Diamond]].\n\nHigher order Skewbs, named Master Skewb and Elite Skewb, have also been made.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1353 Master Skewb]</ref><ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2004 Elite Skewb]</ref>\n\n== Piece orientation ==\nAlthough the Skewb looks simple, its pieces are actually divided into subgroups and have restrictions that are apparent upon examining the puzzle's mechanism. The 8 corners are split into two groups—the four corners attached to the central 4-armed spider and the four \"floating\" corners that can be removed from the mechanism easily. These corners cannot be interchanged i.e. in a single group of four corners, their relative positions are unchanged. They can be distinguished by applying pressure on the corner—if it squishes down a bit, it's a floating corner. The centers only have two possible orientations—this becomes apparent by either scrambling a Skewb-alike puzzle where the center orientation is visible (such as the [[Skewb Diamond]] or [[Skewb Ultimate]]), or by disassembling the puzzle.\n\n== Records ==\nThe world record time for a Skewb is 1.10 by Jonatan Kłosko of Poland on 17 October 2015 at ŚLS Wodzisław Śląski 2015 in [[Wodzisław Śląski]], [[Poland]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\nThe world record average of 5 (excluding fastest and slowest) is 2.03 seconds, set by Łukasz Burliga of Poland on 17 December 2017 at CFL Santa Claus Cube Race 2017 in [[Bełchatów]], [[Poland]], with the times of 2.48 1.91 1.71 1.39, and 4.98 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - Skewb\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=skewb&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Skewb]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=skewb&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official Skewb Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

      "text": "The '''Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle''' is a packing problem that calls for packing six 1 × 2 × 2 blocks and three 1 × 1 × 1 blocks into a 3 × 3 × 3 box. The solution to this puzzle is unique ([[up to]] mirror reflections and rotations). It was named after its inventors Jan Slothouber and William Graatsma.\n\nThe puzzle is essentially the same if the three 1 × 1 × 1 blocks are left out, so that the task is to pack six 1 × 2 × 2 blocks into a cubic box with volume 27. The Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle is regarded as the smallest [[nontrivial]] [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[packing problem]].{{Citation needed|reason=It's not obvious how there does not exist a smaller \"nontrivial\" 3D packing puzzle.|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Solution==\n[[File:Slothouber-Graatsma (solution).PNG|thumb|Solution of Slothouber-Graatsma puzzle showing the six 1 x 2 x 2 pieces in [[exploded view]].]]\nThe solution of the Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle is straightforward when one realizes that the three 1 × 1 × 1 blocks (or the three holes) need to be placed along a body diagonal of the box, as each of the 3 x 3 layers in the various directions needs to contain such a unit block. This follows from [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] considerations, because the larger blocks can only fill an even number of the 9 cells in each 3 x 3 layer.<ref name=\"BCG\">Elwyn R. Berlekamp, John H. Conway and Richard K. Guy: Winning ways for your mathematical plays, 2nd ed, vol. 4, 2004.</ref>\n\n==Variations==\nThe Slothouber–Graatsma puzzle is an example of a cube-packing puzzle using [[Convex set|convex]] [[polycubes]]. More general puzzles involving the packing of convex rectangular blocks exist. The best known example is the [[Conway puzzle]] which asks for the packing of eighteen convex rectangular blocks into a 5 x 5 x 5 box. A harder convex rectangular block packing problem is to pack forty-one 1 x 2 x 4 blocks into a 7 x 7 x 7 box (thereby leaving 15 holes); the solution is analogous to the 5x5x5 case, and has three 1x1x5 cuboidal holes in mutually perpendicular directions covering all 7 slices.<ref name=\"BCG\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Soma cube]]\n*[[Bedlam cube]]\n*[[Diabolical cube]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090123084520/http://www.johnrausch.com/PuzzlingWorld/chap03f.htm The Slothouber-Graatsma puzzle in Stewart Coffin's \"The Puzzling World of Polyhedral Dissections\"]\n*[http://www.designws.com/pagina/1ccceng.htm Jan Slothouber and William Graatsma: Cubic constructs]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090522231053/http://www.genicap.com/Site/Components/SitePageCP/ShowPage.aspx?ItemID=f4e85ecc-81d0-48f8-b972-d606e9dcd60a&SelectedMenuItemID=b0947550-80c1-4fa7-af5b-e26d883ff532  William Graatsma and Jan Slothouber: Dutch mathematical art]\n\n{{Packing problem}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Slothouber-Graatsma puzzle}}\n[[Category:Packing problems]]\n[[Category:Recreational mathematics]]\n[[Category:Tiling puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes]]"

[[Martin Gardner]] (1961). ''The 2nd Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles & Diversions''. New York: Simon & Schuster.

The pieces can also be used to make a variety of other [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] shapes.\n\nThe pieces of the Soma cube consist of all possible combinations of three or four unit cubes, joined at their faces, such that at least one inside corner is formed. There is one combination of three cubes that satisfies this condition, and six combinations of four cubes that satisfy this condition, of which two are mirror images of each other (see [[Chirality (mathematics)|Chirality]]). Thus, 3 + (6 × 4) is 27, which is exactly the number of cells in a 3×3×3 cube.\n\nThe Soma cube was analyzed in detail by [[John Horton Conway]] in the September 1958 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'', and the book ''[[Winning Ways for your Mathematical Plays]]'' also contains a detailed analysis of the Soma cube problem.\n\nThere are 240 distinct solutions of the Soma cube puzzle, excluding rotations and reflections: these are easily generated by a simple [[Recursion|recursive]] [[backtracking search]] computer program similar to that used for the [[eight queens puzzle]]. Current world record for the fastest time to solve a soma cube is 2.93 seconds and was set by [[Krishnam Raju Gadiraju]], [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/435864-fastest-time-to-complete-a-soma-cube/|title=Fastest time to complete a Soma cube|work=guinnessworldrecords.com}}</ref>\n\n==Pieces==\nThe seven Soma pieces are six [[polycube]]s of order four, and one of order three:\n* [[Image:Soma-ra.svg|60x40px]] Piece 1, or \"V\".\n* [[Image:Soma-l.svg|60x40px]] Piece 2, or \"L\": a row of three blocks with one added below the left side.\n* [[Image:Soma-t.svg|60x40px]] Piece 3, or \"T\": a row of three blocks with one added below the center.\n* [[Image:Soma-s.svg|60x40px]] Piece 4, or \"Z\": bent tetromino with block placed on outside of clockwise side.\n* [[Image:Soma-rscrew.svg|60x40px]] Piece 5, or \"A\": unit cube placed on top of clockwise side.

Beginning in about 1967, it was marketed in the U.S. for several years by the game manufacturer [[Parker Brothers]]. Plastic Soma cube sets were also commercially produced by Parker Brothers in several colors (blue, red, and orange) during the 1970s. The package for the Parker Brothers version claimed there were 1,105,920 possible solutions. This figure includes rotations and reflections of each solution as well as rotations of the individual pieces. The puzzle is currently sold as a logic game by ThinkFun (formerly Binary Arts) under the name Block by Block.\n\n==Solutions==\n[[File:Soma cube solution.svg|thumb|One of the possible ways of assembling the Soma cube]]\nSolving the Soma cube has been used as a task to measure individuals' performance and effort in a series of psychology experiments. In these experiments, test subjects are asked to solve a soma cube as many times as possible within a set period of time. For example, In 1969, [[Edward Deci]], a Carnegie Mellon University graduate assistant at the time,<ref>Pink, Daniel H. (2009). \"Drive, The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us\". Riverhead Books.</ref> asked his research subjects to solve a soma cube under conditions with varying incentives in his dissertation work on [[intrinsic motivation|intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic motivation|extrinsic]] motivation establishing the [[social psychological]] theory of [[Motivation crowding theory|crowding out]].\n\nIn each of the 240 solutions to the cube puzzle, there is only one place that the \"T\" piece can be placed. Each solved cube can be rotated such that the \"T\" piece is on the bottom with its long edge along the front and the \"tongue\" of the \"T\" in the bottom center cube (this is the normalized position of the large cube). This can be proven as follows: If you consider all the possible ways that the \"T\" piece can be placed in the large cube (without regard to any of the other pieces), it will be seen that it will always fill either two corners of the large cube or zero corners. There is no way to orient the \"T\" piece such that it fills only one corner of the large cube. The \"L\" piece can be oriented such that it fills two corners, or one corner, or zero corners. Each of the other five pieces have no orientation that fills two corners; they can fill either one corner or zero corners. Therefore, if you exclude the \"T\" piece, the maximum number of corners that can be filled by the remaining six pieces is seven (one corner each for five pieces, plus two corners for the \"L\" piece). A cube has eight corners. But the \"T\" piece cannot be oriented to fill just that one remaining corner, and orienting it such that it fills zero corners will obviously not make a cube. Therefore, the \"T\" must always fill two corners, and there is only one orientation (discounting rotations and reflections) in which it does that. It also follows from this that in all solutions, five of the remaining six pieces will fill their maximum number of corners and one piece will fill one fewer than its maximum (this is called the deficient piece).<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.fam-bundgaard.dk/SOMA/NEWS/N030518.HTM|title=The complete \"SOMAP\" is found|journal=SOMA News|first=William|last=Kustes|date=May 18, 2003|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}.</ref>\n\n==Similar puzzles==\n[[Image:Soma-cube-disassembled.jpg|thumb|An easier variant of the puzzle, where alternating cubes have different colors]]\nSimilar to Soma cube is the 3D [[pentomino]] puzzle, which can fill boxes of 2×3×10, 2×5×6 and 3×4×5 units.\n\nThe [[Bedlam cube]] is a 4×4×4 sided cube puzzle consisting of twelve [[pentacube]]s and one [[Polycube|tetracube]].

On March 16, 1993, it was patented in the USA with patent number US5,193,809.[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=/netahtml/srchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=5193809.WKU.&OS=PN/5193809&RS=PN/5193809] Its design was also patented on October 5, 1993, with patent number D340,093.\n\n=== Description ===\nThe Square-1 consists of three layers. The upper and lower layers contain [[kite (geometry)|kite]] and [[triangle|triangular]] pieces. They are also called [[Corner angle|corner]] and [[edge (geometry)|edge]] pieces, respectively. There are all together 8 kite and 8 triangular pieces. The kite pieces are 60 degrees wide, while the triangular pieces are 30 degrees wide, relative to the center of the layer.\n\nThe middle layer contains two [[trapezoid]] pieces, which together may form an irregular [[hexagon]] or a [[Square (geometry)|square]].\n\nEach layer can be rotated freely, and if the boundaries of pieces in all layers line up, the puzzle can be twisted vertically, interchanging half of the top layer with half of the bottom. In this way, the pieces of the puzzle can be scrambled. Note that because the kite pieces are precisely twice the angular width of the triangular pieces, the two can be freely intermixed, with two triangular pieces taking the place of a single kite piece and vice versa. This leads to bizarre shape changes within the puzzle at any point.\n\nFor the puzzle to be in cube shape, the upper and lower layers must have alternating kite and triangular pieces, with 4 kite and 4 triangular pieces on each layer, and the middle layer must have a square shape. However, since only two shapes are possible for the middle layer, there is a quick sequence of twists which changes the shape of the middle layer from one to the other without touching the rest of the puzzle.\n\nOnce the puzzle has a cube shape, the upper and lower layers are cut in an [[Iron Cross]]-like fashion, or equivalently cut by two [[concentric]] (standard) [[cross]]es, that make an angle with each other.\n\nLike Rubik's Cube, the pieces are colored. For the puzzle to be solved, not only does it need to be in cube shape, but each face of the cube must also have a uniform color. In its solved (or original) state, viewing the cube from the face with the word \"Square-1\" printed on it, the colors are: white on top, green on the bottom, yellow in front, red on the left, orange on the right, and blue behind. Alternative versions of the Square-1 may have different color schemes.\n[[File:Square-1 half-turn.jpg|thumb|200px|The Square-1 puzzle was sold in this shape with instructions for turning it back to a cube. This is halfway through a vertical turn.]]\n\n=== Solutions ===\nA good number of solutions for this puzzle exist on the Internet. Some solutions employ the classical layer-by-layer method, while other approaches include putting the corner pieces in place first, then the edge pieces, or vice versa. Some solutions are a combination of these approaches. Although these solutions use different approaches, most of them try to restore the cube shape of the puzzle first, regardless of the placement of the pieces and the parity of the middle layer, and then proceed to put the pieces in their correct places while preserving the cube shape. The shape is often restored first because it allows for the greatest range of possible moves at any one time – other shapes have fewer moves available.\n\nThe majority of solutions provide a large set of [[Rubik's Cube#Algorithms|algorithms]]. These are sequences of turns and twists that will rearrange a small number of pieces while leaving the rest of the puzzle untouched. Examples include swapping two pieces, cycling through three pieces, etc. Larger scale algorithms are also possible, such as interchanging the top and bottom layers. Through the systematic use of these algorithms, the puzzle is gradually solved.\n\nLike solutions of the Rubik's Cube, the solutions of Square-1 depend on the use of algorithms discovered either by trial and error, or by using computer searches. However, while solutions of Rubik's Cube rely on these algorithms more towards the end, they are heavily used throughout the course of solving the Square-1. This is because the uniform shape of the pieces in the Rubik's Cube allows one to focus on positioning a small subset of pieces while disregarding the rest, at least at the beginning of a solution. However, with the Square-1, the free intermixing of corner and edge pieces can sometimes cause a certain desired operation to be physically blocked; so one must take all pieces into account right from the beginning. Some solutions of the Square-1 rely solely on the use of algorithms.\n\n=== Number of positions ===\nIf different rotations of a given permutation are counted only once while reflections are counted individually, there are 170 &times; 2 &times; 8! &times; 8! = 552,738,816,000 positions.\n\nIf both rotations and reflections are counted once only, the number of positions reduces to 15! ÷ 3 = 435,891,456,000. Also, it always can be solved in a maximum of 14 moves.<ref>https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/square1.htm#numpos</ref>\n\n== World records ==\nThe world record fastest Square-1 solve is 4.95 seconds, set by Jackey Zheng of the [[United States]] on 25 May 2019 at Brooklyn 2019 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name=\"Official Results - Square-1\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=sq1&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Square-1]</ref>\n\nThe world record average of 5 solves (excluding fastest and slowest) is 6.73 seconds, set by Vicenzo Guerino Cecchini of [[Brazil]] set at Schoolmark Open 2018 in [[São Paulo]] Brazil, with the times of: (8.45), 6.53, 6.79, (5.00) and 6.87 seconds.<ref name=\"Official Results - Square-1\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=sq1&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - Square-1]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=sq1&regionId=&years=&show=100%252BPersons&single=Single Official Square-1 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Just like the Square-1, it can adopt non-cubic shapes as it is twisted. As of 2009, it is sold by [[Uwe Mèffert]] in his puzzle shop, ''Meffert's''.\n\nIt consists of 4 layers of 8 pieces, each surrounding a circular column which can be rotated along a perpendicular axis. This allows the pieces from the top and bottom layers and the middle two layers to be interchanged. Each layer consists of 8 movable pieces: 4 wider wedges and 4 narrower wedges. In the top and bottom layers, the wider pieces are the \"corner\" pieces, and the narrower pieces are the \"edge pieces\". In the middle two layers, the wider pieces are the \"edge\" pieces, and the narrower pieces are the \"face centers\". The wider pieces are exactly twice the angular width of the narrower pieces, so that two narrower pieces can fit in the place of one wider piece. Thus, they can be freely intermixed. This leads to the puzzle adopting a large variety of non-cubic shapes.\n\n===Solution===\n\nDespite its appearance, the Super Square One is not significantly more difficult to solve than the original Square-1. The middle layers are nearly identical to the top and bottom layers of the Square-1, and may be solved independently using the same methods as the Square-1. The corners of the middle layers are distinguishable because the corners with the same two colors are mirror images of each other, but the middle edges of each face are interchangeable since they show only one color each.\n\n==Square Two==\n[[File:Square-2.jpg|thumb|Square Two cube]]\nThe \"Square Two\" is yet another variation of the popular Square-1 puzzle, with extra cuts on the top and bottom layers. It is also currently marketed by ''Meffert's'' online store.\n\nThe Square Two is mechanically the same as a Square-1, but the large corner wedges of the top and bottom layers are cut in half, effectively making the corner wedges as versatile as the edge wedges. This removes the ''locking'' issue present on the Square-1, which in many ways makes the Square Two easier to solve (and scramble) than its predecessor.\n\n===Solution===\n\nThe Square Two, like the Super Square One, isn't much more difficult than the Square-1. In many ways, it's actually easier considering one can always make a slice turn regardless of the positions of the top and bottom layers. Mostly, it's solved just like the Original, merely requiring the extra step of combining the corner wedges. After that, it is solved exactly like the Square-1.\n\n===Number of positions===\n\nThere are a total of 24 wedge pieces on the puzzle.\n\nAny permutation of the wedge pieces is possible, including even and odd permutations. This implies there are 24!=620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000 possible permutations of these pieces.\n\nHowever, the middle layer has two possible orientations for each position, increasing the number of positions by a factor of 2.\n\nThis would theoretically yield a grand total of (24!)*2=1,240,896,803,466,478,878,720,000 possible positions for the puzzle, but since the layers have 12 different orientations for each position, some positions have been counted too many times this way. This reduces the number of positions by 12^2.\n\nThe final count is (24!)/72=8,617,338,912,961,658,880,000 total possible positions.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Combination puzzle]]\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]]\n* [[Professor's Cube]]\n* [[V-Cube 6]]\n* [[V-Cube 7]]\n* [[V-Cube 8]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=5,193,809 The Square-1 patent]\n*[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=D340,093 The design patent]\n*[http://spisy.upv.cz/Patents/FullDocuments/277/277266.pdf Original Czechoslovak patent (PDF)]\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/square1.htm (Back to) Square One / Cube 21] (With a program to solve Square-1)\n*[http://ruwix.com/online-puzzle-simulators/square-1-simulator.php Solve the Square-1 online]\n*[http://www.ganpuzzle.com/square1.htm http://www.ganpuzzle.com/square1.htm] Learn to Solve Square-1 with step by step animation accompanied by detailed descriptions.\n*[http://www.ganpuzzle.com/superSquare1.htm http://www.ganpuzzle.com/superSquare1.htm] Learn to Solve Super Square-1 with step by step animation accompanied by detailed descriptions.\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes]]\n[[Category:Logic puzzles]]"

      "title": "V-Cube 6",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Cube_6",
      "text": "[[Image:V-Cube 6 in box.jpg|thumb|right|V-Cube 6 in original packaging]]\n\nThe '''V-Cube 6''' is a 6×6×6 version of [[Rubik's Cube]]. The first mass-produced 6×6×6 was invented by [[Panagiotis Verdes]] and is produced by the [[Greece|Greek]] company Verdes Innovations SA. Other such puzzles have since been introduced by a number of Chinese companies,<ref name=\"Cubicle\">[https://thecubicle.us/6x6-c-30.html 6×6×6 cubes at The Cubicle.us]</ref> some of which have mechanisms which improve on the original. Unlike the original puzzle (but like the [[Rubik's Revenge|4×4×4 cube]]), it has no fixed facets: the center facets (16 per face) are free to move to different positions. \n\nMethods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 6×6×6 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colors &mdash; since the center facets can no longer be used for identification.\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n[[Image:V-Cube 6 scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|V-Cube 6 in a scrambled state]]\n[[Image:V-Cube 6 small.jpg|thumb|Solved]]\nThe puzzle consists of 152 pieces (\"cubies\") on the surface. There are also 60 movable pieces entirely hidden within the interior of the cube, as well as six fixed pieces attached to the central \"spider\" frame. The [[V-Cube 7]] uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter these hidden pieces (corresponding to the center rows) are made visible.<ref>\n[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20070057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref>\n\nThere are 96 center pieces which show one color each, 48 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors. Each piece (or quartet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces.\n\nCurrently, the V-Cube 6 is produced with white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite black. One black center piece is branded with the letter '''V'''. Verdes also sells a version with black plastic and a white face, with the other colors remaining the same.\n\nUnlike the rounded [[V-Cube 7]], the original V-Cube 6 has flat faces. However, the outermost pieces are slightly wider than those in the center. This subtle difference allows the use of a thicker stalk to hold the corner pieces to the internal mechanism, thus making the puzzle more durable. The V-Cube 6b, which has the same \"pillowed\" shape as the V-Cube 7, was introduced later.\n\n===Permutations===\n[[Image:V-Cube 6 size comparison.jpg|thumb|left|The V-Cube 6 is roughly the same size as the official [[Professor's Cube]].]]\nThere are 8 corners, 48 edges and 96 centers.\n\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving [[factorial|8!]]×3<sup>7</sup> combinations.\n\nThere are 96 centers, consisting of four sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of center permutations is the permutations of a single set raised to the fourth power, 24!<sup>4</sup>/(24<sup>24</sup>).\n\nThere are 48 edges, consisting of 24 inner and 24 outer edges. These cannot be flipped (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an inner edge exchange places with an outer edge. The four edges in each matching quartet are distinguishable, since corresponding edges are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges in each set is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!<sup>2</sup> total, regardless of the position or orientation any other pieces.\n\nAssuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because the 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of\n:<math>\\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 24!^6}{24^{25}} \\approx 1.57 \\times 10^{116}</math>\nThe entire number is 157 152 858 401 024 063 281 013 959 519 483 771 508 510 790 313 968 742 344 694 684 829 502 629 887 168 573 442 107 637 760 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (around 157 novemdecillion on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 157 septentrigintillion on the short scale).<ref name=\"Jaap\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cube6.htm V-Cube 6 at Jaap's Puzzle Site]</ref>\n\nOne of the center pieces is marked with a '''V''', which distinguishes it from the other three in its set. This increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 6.29×10<sup>116</sup>, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.\n[[Image:V-Cube 6 disassembled.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Disassembled]]\n\n==Solutions==\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\nThere are a number of methods that can be used to solve a V-Cube 6.  One method is to first group the center pieces of common colors together, then to match up edges that show the same two colors.  Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3×3×3 cube.  However, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3×3×3 cube may be reached. For instance, a single quartet of edges may be inverted, or the cube may appear to have an odd [[permutation]] (that is, two pieces must be swapped, which is not possible on the 3×3×3 cube).  These situations are known as [[parity of a permutation|parity]] errors, and require special algorithms to be solved.<ref name=\"Jaap\"/>\n\nAnother similar approach to solving this cube is to first pair the edges, and then the centers.  This, too, is vulnerable to the parity errors described above.\n\nOther methods solve the cube by solving a cross and the centers, but not solving any of the edges and corners not needed for the cross, then the other edges would be placed similar to the 3x3x3 [[CFOP|Fridrich method]].\n\nSome methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above.  For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centers last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the center pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centers by cycling 3 face centers, two of which are visually identical.\n\n==Records==\nThe world record fastest 6x6x6 solve is 1 minute, 13.82 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of [[United States]] on 19 August 2018 at WCA Asian Championship 2018 in [[New Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 6x6x6 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=666&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 6x6x6 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe world record mean of three solves is 1 minute, 17.10 seconds, also set by Max Park at WCA Asian Championship, with the times of 1:15.94 1:13.82, and 1:21.54.<ref name=\"Official Results - 6x6x6 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=666&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 6x6x6 Cube]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=666&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 6x6x6 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

      "text": " \n[[Image:7-layer-cubes.jpg|thumb|right|V-Cube 7 (left), Shengshou 7×7 (right)]]\nThe '''V-Cube 7''' is a [[combination puzzle]] in the form of a 7×7×7 cube. The first mass-produced 7×7×7 was invented by [[Panagiotis Verdes]] and is produced by the [[Greece|Greek]] company Verdes Innovations SA. Other such puzzles have since been introduced by a number of Chinese companies,<ref name=\"Cubicle\">[https://thecubicle.us/7x7-c-34.html 7×7×7 cubes at The Cubicle.us]</ref> some of which have mechanisms which improve on the original. Like the [[Professor's Cube|5×5×5]], the V-Cube 7 has both fixed and movable center facets.\n== Mechanics ==\n\n[[Image:V-Cube 7 scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|The V-Cube 7 in a scrambled state]]\n[[Image:LargeRubiksCube Corners.png|thumb|right|Issue with corners in a large cube]]\n[[Image:V-Cube 7 solved.jpg|thumb|right|The V-Cube 7 in solved state]]\nThe puzzle consists of 218 unique miniature cubes (\"cubies\") on the surface. Six of these (the central tiles of the six faces) are attached directly to the internal \"spider\" frame and are fixed in position relative to one another. The [[V-Cube 6]] uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter the central rows, which hold the rest of the pieces together, are completely hidden.<ref>\n[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20070057455.html United States Patent 20070057455]</ref>\n\nThere are 150 center pieces which show one color each, 60 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors each. Each piece (or quintet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the outer layers of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the relative positions of the fixed center squares and the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces.\n\nCurrently, the V-Cube 7 is produced with white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite black. Verdes and other manufacturers also sell cubes with black plastic and a white face, with the other colors remaining the same, and solid plastic versions with the plastic the colour itself and no stickers. The fixed black or white center piece is branded with the logo of the manufacturer, which is '''V''' on cubes by Verdes. Flag variations of 7×7s including Germany, Poland and Russia, are also sold by Verdes.\n\nUnlike the flat-sided [[V-Cube 6]], the V-Cube 7 is noticeably rounded. This departure from a true cube shape is necessary, since the mechanism used on this puzzle would not function properly with layers of identical thickness. Other means (such as magnets) would be required. Note from the image at right that if a 7×7×7 were to be constructed with layers of identical thickness the corner pieces (shown in red) would lose contact with the rest of the puzzle when a side was rotated 45 degrees. The V-Cube 6 and V-Cube 7 both solve the problem by using thicker outer layers. The rounded shape of the V-Cube 7 results in corner stickers that are similar in size to the center stickers, which helps hide the unequal thickness.\n\nCubes from other manufacturers can be found with rounded or flat sides, but all use thicker outer layers.<ref name=\"Cubicle\"/>\n\n===Permutations===\n[[Image:3x3x3 standard cube and 7x7x7 v-cube.jpeg|thumb|left|A size comparison between an original size 3×3×3 cube, and a 7×7×7 V-Cube 7]]\n[[Image:V-Cube 7 disassembled.jpg|thumb|left|Disassembled]]\nThere are 8 corner \"cubies\", 60 edges and 150 centers (6 fixed, 144 movable).\n\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving [[factorial|8!]]×3<sup>7</sup> combinations. \n\nThere are 144 movable centers, consisting of six sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations of each set is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements, all of which are possible. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 (4!) ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of permutations of all movable centers is the permutations of a single set raised to the sixth power, 24!<sup>6</sup>/(24<sup>36</sup>). \n\nThere are 60 edge pieces, consisting of 12 central, 24 intermediate, and 24 outer edges. The central edges can be flipped but the rest cannot (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an edge from one set exchange places with one from another set. The five edges in each matching quintet are distinguishable, since corresponding non-central edges are mirror images of each other. There are 12!/2 ways to arrange the central edges, since an odd permutation of the corners implies an odd permutation of these pieces as well. There are 2<sup>11</sup> ways that they can be flipped, since the orientation of the twelfth edge depends on the preceding eleven. Any permutation of the intermediate and outer edges is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!<sup>2</sup> total, regardless of the position or orientation any other pieces.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of\n:<math>\\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 24!^8}{24^{36}} \\approx 1.95 \\times 10^{160}</math>\nThe entire number is 19 500 551 183 731 307 835 329 126 754 019 748 794 904 992 692 043 434 567 152 132 912 323 232 706 135 469 180 065 278 712 755 853 360 682 328 551 719 137 311 299 993 600 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (roughly 19,501 sexvigintillion or 19.5 sexvigintilliard on the [[names of large numbers|long scale]] or 19.5 duoquinquagintillion on the short scale).<ref name=\"Jaap\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cube7.htm V-Cube 7 at Jaap's Puzzle Site]</ref>\n\nOne of the fixed center pieces is usually marked with the logo of the manufacturer, such as '''V''' in a cube by V-Cube. This center piece can be oriented in four different ways, which increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 7.80×10<sup>160</sup>. Any orientation of the fixed center piece is usually regarded as solved.\n\n==Solution==\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Rubik szétszedve.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An original [[Professor's Cube]] with many of the pieces removed shows the 3×3×3 equivalence of the remaining pieces. The same principle applies to the V-Cube 7.]]\nOne strategy involves grouping similar edge pieces into solid strips, and centers into one-colored blocks.  This allows the cube to be quickly solved with the same methods one would use for a 3×3×3 cube. Because the permutations of the corners, central edges and fixed centers have the same parity restrictions as the 3×3×3 cube, once reduction is complete the parity errors seen on the 4×4×4 and 6×6×6 cannot occur on the 7×7×7.<ref name=\"Jaap\"/>\n\nAnother strategy is to solve the edges of the cube first. The corners can be placed just as they are in any previous order of cube puzzle, and the centers are manipulated with an algorithm similar to the one used in the 4×4×4 cube.\n\n==Records==\nThe world record fastest 7x7x7 solve is 1 minute, 47.89 seconds, set by [[Max Park]] of the [[United States]] on 14 July 2018 at WCCT Fresno 2018 in [[Fresno, California]].<ref name=\"Official Results - 7x7x7 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=777&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 7x7x7 Cube]</ref>\n\nThe world record mean of three solves is also held by [[Max Park]] of the [[United States]] with a time of 1 minute, 51.63 seconds, set on 22 December 2018 at CubeChella 2018 in [[Bermuda Dunes, California| Bermuda Dunes]], [[California]], with the times of 1:52.58 1:53.97, and 1:48.35.<ref name=\"Official Results - 7x7x7 Cube\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=777&years=&mixed=Mixed Official Results - 7x7x7 Cube]</ref>\n\n=== Top 5 solvers by single solve<ref>[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=777&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official 7×7×7 Ranking Single]</ref>===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

      "text": "{{Distinguish|BB-8}}\n{{refimprove|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[File:8-layer cube.jpg|thumb|Shengshou 8×8 compared to a 3×3×3]]The '''V-Cube 8''' is an 8×8×8 version of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. Unlike the original puzzle (but like the [[Rubik's Revenge|4×4×4]] and [[V-Cube 6|6×6×6]] cubes), it has no fixed facets: the center facets (36 per face) are free to move to different positions. The design was covered by [[Panagiotis Verdes]]' patent from 2007<ref name=\"USPTO\">[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2007/0057455.html US Patent 20070057455]</ref> but Verdes Innovations SA did not produce it for sale until 2014. Other 8×8×8 cubes are produced by the Chinese companies ShengShou, MoYu, and YuXin.<ref name=\"the cubicle\">[https://thecubicle.us/13x13-c-62.html 8×8×8-17×17×17 cubes at TheCubicle.us]</ref>\n\nMethods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 8×8×8 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colors &mdash; since the center facets can no longer be used for identification.\n\n== Mechanics ==\n\n\nThe puzzle consists of 296 pieces (\"cubies\") on the surface. There are also 84 movable pieces entirely hidden within the interior of the cube, as well as six fixed pieces attached to the central \"spider\" frame. The [[V-Cube 9]] uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter these hidden pieces (corresponding to the center rows) are made visible.<ref name=\"USPTO\"/>\n\nThere are 216 center pieces which show one color each, 72 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors. Each piece (or sextet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces.\n\nCurrently, the 8×8×8 is produced with black or white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite white or black. The V-Cube version has one center piece marked the letter '''V'''.\n\nThe V-Cube has rounded sides like the [[V-Cube 7]], whereas the Chinese versions have flat faces. On all versions the outermost layers are thicker than the middle ones. Without this alteration there would be no way to connect the corner pieces to the rest of the mechanism.\n\n===Permutations===\nThere are 8 corners, 72 edges and 216 centers.\n\nAny permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving [[factorial|8!]]×3<sup>7</sup> combinations.\n\nThere are 216 centers, consisting of nine sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(24<sup>6</sup>) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 24 ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of center permutations is the permutations of a single set raised to the ninth power, 24!<sup>9</sup>/(24<sup>54</sup>).\n\nThere are 72 edges, consisting of 24 inner, 24 intermediate and 24 outer edges. These cannot be flipped (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an edge from one set exchange places with an edge from another set. The six edges in each matching sextet are distinguishable, since corresponding edges are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges in each set is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!<sup>3</sup> total, regardless of the position or orientation any other pieces.\n\nAssuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because the 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation.\n\nThis gives a total number of permutations of\n:<math>\\frac{8! \\times 3^7 \\times 24!^{12}}{24^{55}} \\approx 3.52 \\times 10^{217}</math>\nThe entire number is 35 173 780 923 109 452 777 509 592 367 006 557 398 539 936 328 978 098 352 427 605 879 843 998 663 990 903 628 634 874 024 098 344 287 402 504 043 608 416 113 016 679 717 941 937 308 041 012 307 368 528 117 622 006 727 311 360 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000.\n\nThe V-Cube has one center piece marked with a '''V''', which distinguishes it from the other three in its set. This increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 1.41×10<sup>218</sup>, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.\n\n==Solutions==\n{{original research section|date=January 2013}}\nThere are a number of methods that can be used to solve a V-Cube 8.  One method is to first group the center pieces of common colors together, then to match up edges that show the same two colors.  Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3×3×3 cube.  However, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3×3×3 cube may be reached. For instance, a single sextet of edges may be inverted, or the cube may appear to have an odd [[permutation]] (that is, two pieces must be swapped, which is not possible on the 3×3×3 cube).  These situations are known as [[parity of a permutation|parity]] errors, and require special algorithms to be solved.<ref>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cube4.htm Jaap's puzzle page for the 4×4×4 cube] has algorithms that also apply to the 8×8×8.</ref>\n\nAnother similar approach to solving this cube is to first pair the edges, and then the centers.  This, too, is vulnerable to the parity errors described above.\n\nOther methods solve the cube by solving a cross and the centers, but not solving any of the edges and corners not needed for the cross, then the other edges would be placed similar to the 3x3 Fridrich method.\n\nSome methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above.  For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centers last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the center pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centers by cycling 3 face centers, two of which are visually identical.\n\n==Records==\nThe [[World Cube Association]] does not keep records for this puzzle as of 2018. Mattia Furlan claims the unofficial world record with a time of 4:36.30 minutes.<ref>https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/List_of_Unofficial_World_Records</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pocket Cube]] (2×2×2)\n* [[Rubik's Cube]] (3×3×3)\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]] (4×4×4)\n* [[Professor's Cube]] (5×5×5)\n* [[V-Cube 6]] - (6×6×6)\n* [[V-Cube 7]] - (7×7×7)\n* [[Combination puzzles]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rubik's Revenge: The Simplest Solution (Book) by William L.

      "text": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=November 2015}}\n{{synthesis|date=June 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Void Cube.jpg|thumb|right|Solved Void Cube]]\nThe '''Void Cube''' is a [[Three-dimensional space|3-D]] [[mechanical puzzle]] similar to a [[Rubik's Cube]], with the notable difference being that the center pieces are missing, which causes the puzzle to resemble a level 1 [[Menger sponge]]. The core used on the Rubik's Cube is also absent, creating holes straight through the cube on all three axes. Due to the restricted volume of the puzzle it employs an entirely different structural mechanism from a regular Rubik's Cube, though the possible moves are the same. The Void Cube was invented by [[Katsuhiko Okamoto]]. Gentosha Education, in Japan, holds the license to manufacture Void Cubes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cubepuzzle.arrow.jp/modules/pico/index.php?cat_id=2|title=Okamoto's official website (in Japanese)|first=Katsuhiko|last=Okamoto}}</ref>\n\n==Solution==\n\nThe Void Cube is slightly more difficult than a regular Rubik's Cube due to [[Parity of a permutation|parity]]. The lack of center cubes alters the parity considerations. A 90˚ rotation of a face either on the regular Rubik's Cube or on the Void Cube swaps the positions of eight cubes in two, odd parity, four cycles. Overall, a face turn is an [[Parity of a permutation|even permutation]]. On the regular cube a 90˚ rotation of the whole cube about a principal axis swaps the positions of 24 cubes in six, odd parity, four cycles. On the regular cube a whole cube rotation is an even permutation. On the other hand, lacking center cubes, a 90˚ whole cube rotation on the Void Cube swaps 20 cubes in five, odd parity, four cycles. Thus, a whole cube rotation on the Void Cube is an odd permutation. In consequence, on the Void Cube turning the faces of the cube together with whole cube rotations can produce an arrangement where two cubes are swapped and the rest are in their original positions. This and other odd parity arrangements are not possible on the regular Rubik's Cube and afford the solver an additional challenge. These permutations are solvable with a number of simple algorithms.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzcYnPnIoSA Solution algorithms]</ref>\n[[File:Rubik's cube vs void cube odd parity swap.jpg|thumbnail|right|Odd Parity Single Swap]] \nTo see the relationship between parity on the regular cube and the void cube consider the regular cube.  A regular cube solution takes a scrambled cube to the identity cube where the color of all the edge and corner facelets match the center facelets.  A void cube solution takes a scrambled cube to an arrangement where the color of the edge and corner facelets match each other regardless of the color of the center facelet.  These \"cat's eye\" arrangements are formed by rotating the edge and corner cubes as a whole with respect to the center cubies.  This may be done in 24 different ways but because of parity only 12 may be formed by turning the faces of the cube.  Odd parity void cube positions are formed on odd parity \"cat's eye\" regular cube positions.\n\n== Internal mechanism ==\n[[File:Disassembled Void Cube.JPG|thumb|right|Disassembled Void Cube.]]\nThe parts of a Void Cube are:\n* 20 pieces\n** 8 corner pieces\n** 12 edge (middle) pieces\n* 6 internal support pieces with the square hole through them\n* 12 mostly-hidden internal sliding pieces with several functions\n\nEssentially, the \"frame\" of the mechanism comprises six identical pieces with square holes (the ones you can look through). Part of the interior of each hole is the inside surface of these pieces. Say that one of them is lying separately on a work surface, \"exterior\" side facing up. If you look straight down at one of these pieces (so your line of sight is parallel to that face's rotational axis) its exterior is also square.\n\nSeen from a more-typical oblique position, however, each side of a square piece is somewhat akin to a low arch that joins neighboring corners. The low part of that arch engages mostly-hidden internal sliding pieces that (among other functions) support the edge cubies. The high surface of the arch includes convex curved circular flanges that engage grooves inside the cubies, to hold the structure together.\n\nWhen all faces of the puzzle are in their normal aligned state, these six pieces are akin to the sides of an internal cube. Each one is free to rotate without any obstruction from the other five pieces. When a face is rotated, its own square piece also rotates with that face's cubies, but that square piece's own flanges do not move relative to the cubies.\n\nWhat retains the cubies when a face is rotated is the set of four curved flanges on the four neighboring square-hole pieces. Grooves inside the cubies fit over those flanges. Edge cubie grooves engage flanges on neighboring square pieces, thus keeping them together.\n\nAs described so far, however, the individual parts of the mechanism would move out of position easily. Each edge of the puzzle therefore includes a mostly-hidden sliding piece (already mentioned) with a complex shape that includes a curved dovetail surface. This surface is widest at its innermost extension, and in the center of the piece along its length.\nThe dovetail of this piece, acting somewhat like a wedge, keeps neighboring square pieces spaced apart.\n\nKeeping the square pieces apart ensures that the grooves inside the cubies stay engaged with the flanges. Close manufacturing tolerances result in sufficient friction to keep parts of the puzzle from moving on their own, but also\nstill allow easy movement.\n\nEdge cubies fit onto positioning lugs on the exteriors of these internal sliding pieces, so that rotating a face makes its edge cubies push the sliding pieces around in a circle. The interior surfaces that face inward toward the hole drive this face's square piece so that it rotates with the cubies.\n\nThe square pieces ensure that these internal sliding pieces stay toward the edges of the puzzle.\n\nEdge cubies in their normal position are retained by the flanges of neighboring square pieces. Corner cubies are retained by a trio of short circular flanges at the ends of the interior sliding pieces. When a face is rotated, those short flanges temporarily retain edge cubies, particularly when the face is rotated about 1/8 of a turn (roughly 45 degrees). As well, the corner cubies are temporarily retained by the curved flanges on the neighboring square pieces.\nDuring a rotation, flanges \"change roles\" as cubies travel along their circular paths.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Megaminx#Variations|Holey Megaminx]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Void Cube}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzle cubes]]\n[[Category:Logic puzzles]]"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_Method",
      "text": "The '''CFOP Method''' (Cross – F2L – OLL – PLL), sometimes known as the '''Fridrich''' method, is one of the most commonly used methods in [[speedcubing|speedsolving]] a 3×3×3 [[Rubik's Cube]]. This method was first developed in the early 1980s combining innovations by a number of speed cubers.  Czech speedcuber and the namesake of the method [[Jessica Fridrich]] is generally credited for popularizing it by publishing it online in 1997.<ref>{{cite web\n |author=Shotaro \"Macky\" Makisumi \n |title=Speedcubing \n |work=cubefreak.net \n |url=http://www.cubefreak.net/speedcubing.html \n |accessdate=2007-08-31 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703151003/http://www.cubefreak.net/speedcubing.html \n |archivedate=2007-07-03 \n |deadurl=yes \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nThe method works on a layer-by-layer system, first solving a cross typically on the bottom, continuing to solve the first two layers (F2L), orienting the last layer (OLL), and finally permuting the last layer (PLL).\n\n==History==\nBasic layer-by-layer methods were among the first to arise during the early 1980s cube craze. [[David Singmaster]] published a layer-based solution in 1980 which proposed the use of a cross.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beginner's Rubik's Cube Solution|url=http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/beginner.html|accessdate=15 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926083418/http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/beginner.html|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe major innovation of CFOP over beginner methods is its use of F2L, which solves the first two layers simultaneously. This step was not invented by Jessica Fridrich. According to Singmaster's report on the [[1982 World Rubik's Cube Championship]], Fridrich was then using a basic layer method, while Dutch competitor Guus Razoux Schultz had a primitive F2L system.<ref name=jaapsch>{{cite web|last=Singmaster|first=David|title=Cubic Circular Issue 3, Spring 1982|url=http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p3}}</ref>\n\nThe last layer steps OLL and PLL involve first orienting the last layer pieces, then permuting them into their correct positions. This step was proposed by Hans Dockhorn and Anneke Treep.\n\nFridrich switched to F2L later in 1987. Her main contribution to the method was developing the OLL and PLL algorithms, which together allowed any last layer position to be solved with two algorithms and was significantly faster than previous last layer systems.<ref name=fridhist>{{cite web|last=Fridrich|first=Jessica|title=20 years of speedcubing|url=http://ws2.binghamton.edu/fridrich/history.html|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==The method==\n[[Image:CubeCross.svg|thumb|Cross solved (view from bottom)]]{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}[[Image:F2LUp.svg|thumb|First Two Layers solved]]\n[[Image:OLL.svg|thumb|Orientation of the Last Layer complete]]\nThe method consists of 4 steps:\n* '''The Cross''' - This first stage involves solving the four edge pieces in one outer layer of the puzzle, centering around a commonly coloured centre piece. Many speedcubers usually solve the cross on the bottom side to avoid cube rotations, which slow down solve times.\n* '''First Two Layers (F2L)''' - In F2L, corner and edge pieces are paired up and later moved to their correct location. There are 42 standard cases for each corner-edge pair including the case where it is already solved. It can also be done intuitively. \n* '''Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL)''' - This stage involves manipulating the top layer so that all the pieces therein have the same colour on top, at the expense of incorrect colours on other sides. This stage involves a total of 57 algorithms. A simpler version, called \"two-look OLL\" orients edges first and corners afterwards. Algorithms are usually performed two to three time for this version. It uses ten algorithms, 3 for edge orientation and seven for corner orientation.\n* '''Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL)''' - The final stage involves moving the pieces of the top layer while preserving their orientation. There are a total of 21 algorithms for this stage. They are distinguished by letter names, usually based on what they look like with arrows representing what pieces are swapped around (e.g. A permutation, F permutation, T permutation, etc.). \"Two-look\" PLL solves the corners first and edges separately. It uses six algorithms, two for corner permutation and between four for edge permutation. Also, a U-perm can be repeated if the user wishes to use even less algorithms at the expense of usually faster solve times.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zemdegs |first1=Feliks |title=2-look last layer |url=https://www.cubeskills.com/tutorials/2-look-last-layer |website=Cubeskills}}</ref>\n\n==Competition use==\nCFOP is heavily used and relied upon by many [[Speedcubing|speedcubers]], including [[Rowe Hessler]], [[Mats Valk]], and [[Feliks Zemdegs]] for its heavy reliance on [[algorithm]]s, [[pattern recognition]] and [[muscle memory]]; as opposed to more intuitive methods such as the [[Speedcubing#Roux method|Roux]] or [[Speedcubing#Petrus method|Petrus]] method.

The maximal number of moves is 15 (including the four vertex moves).]\"</ref> It refers to any algorithm which produces a solution having the fewest possible moves, the idea being that an [[omniscient]] being would know an optimal step from any given configuration.\n\n== Scope ==\n\n===Definition===\n\nThe notion applies to [[puzzle]]s that can assume a [[wiktionary:Finite|finite]] number of \"configurations\", with a relatively small, well-defined arsenal of \"moves\" that may be applicable to configurations and then lead to a new configuration. Solving the puzzle means to reach a designated \"final configuration\", a singular configuration, or one of a collection of configurations. To solve the puzzle a sequence of moves is applied, starting from some arbitrary initial configuration.\n\n===Solution===\n\nAn algorithm can be considered to solve such a puzzle if it takes as input an arbitrary initial configuration and produces as output a sequence of moves leading to a final configuration (''if'' the puzzle is solvable from that initial configuration, otherwise it signals the impossibility of a solution). A solution is optimal if the sequence of moves is as short as possible. This count is known as '''God's number''',<ref>{{cite news |author=Jonathan Fildes  |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Rubik's Cube quest for speedy solution comes to an end |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-10929159 |date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> or, more formally, the '''minimax''' value.<ref name=Sing311/> God's algorithm, then, for a given puzzle, is an algorithm that solves the puzzle and produces only optimal solutions.\n\nSome writers, such as David Joyner, consider that for an algorithm to be properly referred to as \"God's algorithm\", it should also be ''practical'', meaning that the algorithm does not require extraordinary amounts of memory or time.  For example, using a giant [[lookup table]] indexed by initial configurations would allow solutions to be found very quickly, but would require an extraordinary amount of memory.<ref>Joyner, page 149</ref>\n\nInstead of asking for a full solution, one can equivalently ask for a single move from an initial but not final configuration, where the move is the first of some optimal solution. An algorithm for the single-move version of the problem can be turned into an algorithm for the original problem by invoking it repeatedly while applying each move reported to the present configuration, until a final one is reached. Conversely, any algorithm for the original problem can be turned into an algorithm for the single-move version by truncating its output to its first move.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nWell-known puzzles fitting this description are [[mechanical puzzle]]s like [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Towers of Hanoi]], and the [[15 puzzle]]. The one-person game of [[peg solitaire]] is also covered, as well as many [[logic puzzle]]s, such as the [[missionaries and cannibals problem]]. These have in common that they can be [[Mathematical model|modeled mathematically]] as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Directed graph|directed graph]], in which the configurations are the vertices, and the moves the arcs.\n\n===Mechanical puzzles===\n\n====n-Puzzles====\n\nThe [[Fifteen puzzle]] can be solved in 80 single-tile moves<ref>A. Brüngger, A. Marzetta, K. Fukuda and J. Nievergelt, [http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gendron/Pisa/References/BB/Brungger99.pdf The parallel search bench ZRAM and its applications], ''Annals of Operations Research'' '''90''' (1999), pp. 45–63.</ref> or 43 multi-tile moves<ref>[http://cubezzz.duckdns.org/drupal/?q=node/view/223 \"The Fifteen Puzzle can be solved in 43 ''moves''\"].

Warmuth (1986). [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/1986/AAAI86-027.pdf \"Finding a shortest solution for the N × N extension of the 15-puzzle is intractable\"]. in ''Proceedings AAAI-86''. National Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 1986. pp.&nbsp;168–172.</ref> Therefore, whether a practical God's algorithm for this problem exists remains unknown, but appears unlikely.\n\n====Towers of Hanoi====\n\nFor the [[Towers of Hanoi]] puzzle, a God's algorithm is known for any given number of disks. The number of moves is exponential in the number of disks.<ref>Carlos Rueda, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040605074124/http://yupana.autonoma.edu.co/publicaciones/yupana/003/hanoi/hanoi_eng.html \"An optimal solution to the Towers of Hanoi Puzzle\"].</ref>\n\n====Rubik's Cube====\n{{main|Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube}}\n\nAn algorithm for finding optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube was published in 1997 by Richard Korf.<ref>Richard E. Korf, \"Finding optimal solutions to Rubik's Cube using pattern databases\", ''Proc. Natl. Conf. on Artificial Intelligence'' (AAAI-97), Providence, Rhode Island, Jul 1997, pp. 700–705.</ref> While it had been known since 1995 that 20 was a lower bound on the number of moves for the solution in the worst case, it was proven  in 2010 through extensive computer calculations that no configuration requires more than 20 moves.<ref name=\"GN20\">[http://www.cube20.org/ \"God's Number is 20\"]. Cube20.org</ref> Thus 20 is a [[Mathematical jargon#sharp|sharp]] [[upper bound]] on the length of optimal solutions. Mathematician [[David Singmaster]] had \"rashly conjectured\" this number to be 20 in 1980.<ref name=Sing311>Singmaster, p. 311, 1980</ref>\n\n==Unsolved games==\nSome well known games with a very limited set of simple well-defined rules and moves have nevertheless never had their God's algorithm for a winning strategy determined.  Examples are the board games [[chess]] and [[go (game)|Go]].<ref>Rothenberg, p. 11</ref>  Both these games have a rapidly increasing number of positions with each move.  The total number of all possible positions, approximately 10<sup>154</sup> for chess<ref>Baum, p. 187</ref> and 10<sup>180</sup> (on a 19×19 board) for Go,<ref>Baum, p. 199</ref> is much too large to allow a brute force solution with current computing technology (compare the now solved, with great difficulty, Rubik's Cube at only about 4.3×10<sup>19</sup> positions<ref>Singmaster, 1981</ref>).  Consequently, a brute force determination of God's algorithm for these games is not possible.  While chess computers have been built that are capable of beating even the best human players, they do not calculate the game all the way to the end.  [[Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue]], for instance, searched only 11 moves ahead (counting a move by each player as two moves), reducing the search space to only 10<sup>17</sup>.<ref>Baum, p. 188</ref>  After this, it assessed each position for advantage according to rules derived from human play and experience.\n\nEven this strategy is not possible with Go.  Besides having hugely more positions to evaluate, no one so far has successfully constructed a set of simple rules for evaluating the strength of a Go position as has been done for chess.<ref>{{multiref|Baum, p. 197|Mohammadian, p. 11}}</ref>  Evaluation algorithms are prone to make elementary mistakes<ref>Baum, p.197</ref> so even for a limited look ahead with the goal limited to finding the strongest interim position, a God's algorithm has not been possible for Go.\n\nOn the other hand, [[draughts]], with superficial similarities to chess, has long been suspected of being \"played out\" by its expert practitioners.<ref>Fraser & Hannah, p. 197</ref>  In 2007 Schaeffer ''et al.'' proved this to be so by calculating a database of all positions with ten or fewer pieces.  Thus Schaeffer has a God's algorithm for all end games of draughts and used this to prove that all perfectly played games of draughts will end in a draw.<ref>Moore & Mertens, chapter 1.3, \"Playing chess with God\"</ref>  However, draughts with only 5×10<sup>20</sup> positions<ref>Schaeffer ''et al.'', p. 1518</ref> and even fewer, 3.9×10<sup>13</sup>, in Schaeffer's database,<ref>Moore & Mertens, \"Notes\" to chapter 1</ref> is a much easier problem to crack and is of the same order as Rubik's cube.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oracle machine]]\n*[[Divine move]]\n*''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Baum, Eric B., ''What is Thought?'', MIT Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0262025485}}.\n* Davis, Darryl N.; Chalabi, T.; Berbank-Green, B., \"Artificial-life, agents and Go\", in Mohammadian, Masoud, ''New Frontiers in Computational Intelligence and its Applications'', pp.&nbsp;125–139, IOS Press, 2000 {{ISBN|9051994761}}.\n* Fraser, Rober (ed); Hannah, W.

There are many unofficial world records for the fastest solve, the most recent of which being held by Sebastian Häfner, who solved the cube in 9.32 seconds (since the Mirror Blocks is not a [[World Cube Association|WCA]]-sanctioned puzzle, records are harder to establish).<ref name=\"AB\">{{cite web|url=https://www.grubiks.com/puzzles/rubiks/mirror-cube-3x3x3/|title=Online Mirror Cube (3x3x3) - Grubiks|website=www.grubiks.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"BC\">{{cite web|url=http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1579|title=TwistyPuzzles.com > Museum > Bump Cube|website=twistypuzzles.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"CD\">{{cite web|url=https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/List_of_Unofficial_World_Records|title=List of Unofficial World Records - Speedsolving.com Wiki|website=www.speedsolving.com|accessdate=15 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"DE\">{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/|title=World Cube Association|website=www.worldcubeassociation.org|accessdate=23 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mirror Cube scrambled.png|frameless|right|Mirror Cube scrambled]]\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Mirror Blocks was originally invented by Hidetoshi Takeji in 2006. He initially named the puzzle the \"Bump Cube\" due to it having an uneven, bumpy surface when scrambled. At a competition in Osaka, Hidetoshi showed his puzzle to a speedcuber who took great interest in it. Hidetoshi decided to lend his puzzle to the speedcuber, who showed it to a project group. In the fall of 2008, the puzzle was first mass-produced in Boston by Rubik's and manufactured by MegaHouse. When it was released, it was officially named the Mirror Blocks.<ref name=\"AB\" /><ref name=\"BC\" /><ref name=\"CD\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Logic puzzles]]"

The 4-D nature of the stickers is clearly visible in this screen shot.]]\n\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] is the original and best known of the three-dimensional [[sequential move puzzles]]. There have been many virtual implementations of this puzzle in [[software]]. It is a natural extension to create '''sequential move puzzles in more than three dimensions'''. Although no such puzzle could ever be physically constructed, the rules of how they operate are quite rigorously defined mathematically and are analogous to the rules found in three-dimensional geometry. Hence, they can be simulated by software. As with the mechanical sequential move puzzles, there are records for solvers, although not yet the same degree of competitive organisation.\n\n==Glossary==\n\n*'''[[Vertex (geometry)|Vertex]]'''. A zero-dimensional point at which higher-dimension figures meet.\n*'''[[Edge (geometry)|Edge]]'''. A one-dimensional figure at which higher-dimension figures meet.\n*'''[[Face (geometry)|Face]]'''. A two-dimensional figure at which (for objects of dimension greater than three) higher-dimension figures meet.\n*'''[[Cell (geometry)|Cell]]'''. A three-dimensional figure at which (for objects of dimension greater than four) higher-dimension figures meet.\n*'''''n''-[[Polytope]]'''. A [[n-dimensional|''n''-dimensional]] figure continuing as above. A specific geometric shape may replace polytope where this is appropriate, such as 4-cube to mean the [[tesseract]].\n*'''''n''-cell'''. A higher-dimension figure containing ''n'' cells.\n*'''Piece'''. A single moveable part of the puzzle having the same dimensionality as the whole puzzle.\n*'''Cubie'''. In the solving community this is the term generally used for a 'piece'.\n*'''Sticker'''. The coloured labels on the puzzle which identify the state of the puzzle. For instance, the corner cubies of a Rubik's cube are a single piece but each has three stickers. The stickers in higher-dimensional puzzles will have a dimensionality greater than two. For instance, in the 4-cube, the stickers are three-dimensional solids.\n\nFor comparison purposes, the data relating to the standard 3<sup>3</sup> Rubik's cube is as follows;\n{|\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#88DDDD;font-weight:bold;\"|Piece count\n|-\n|Number of vertices (''V'')||style=\"width:50px;\"|8||Number of 3-colour pieces||8\n|-\n|Number of edges (''E'')||12||Number of 2-colour pieces||12\n|-\n|Number of faces (''F'')||6||Number of 1-colour pieces||6\n|-\n|Number of cells (''C'')||1||Number of 0-colour pieces||1\n|-\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|Number of coloured pieces (''P'')||26\n|-\n|Number of stickers||54\n|}\n\nNumber of achievable combinations &nbsp;<math> = \\frac{12!\\cdot 8!}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2^{12}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3^8}{3} \\sim 10^{20}</math>\n\nThere is some debate over whether the face-centre cubies should be counted as separate pieces as they cannot be moved relative to each other. A different number of pieces may be given in different sources. In this article the face-centre cubies are counted as this makes the arithmetical sequences more consistent and they can certainly be rotated, a solution of which requires algorithms. However, the cubie right in the middle is not counted because it has no visible stickers and hence requires no solution. Arithmetically we should have\n\n: <math>P = V+E+F+C \\,\\!</math>\n\nBut ''P'' is always one short of this (or the ''n''-dimensional extension of this formula) in the figures given in this article because ''C'' (or the corresponding highest-dimension polytope, for higher dimensions) is not being counted.\n\n==Magic 4D Cube==\n[[File:4-cube solved.png|thumb|4-cube 3<sup>4</sup> virtual puzzle, solved.

[[pentagon]]s. The 120-cell is the 4-D analogue of the dodecahedron in the same way that the tesseract (4-cube) is the 4-D analogue of the cube. The 4-D 120-cell software sequential move puzzle from Gravitation3d is therefore the 4-D analogue of the [[Megaminx]], 3-D puzzle, which has the shape of a [[dodecahedron]].\n\nThe puzzle is rendered in only one size, that is three cubies on a side, but in six colouring schemes of varying difficulty. The full puzzle requires a different colour for each cell, that is 120 colours. This large number of colours adds to the difficulty of the puzzle in that some shades are quite difficult to tell apart. The easiest form is two interlocking tori, each torus forming a ring of cubies in different dimensions. The full list of colouring schemes is as follows;\n*2-colour tori.\n*9-colour 4-cube cells. That is, the same colouring scheme as the 4-cube.\n*9-colour layers.\n*12-colour rings.\n*60-colour antipodal. Each pair of diametrically opposed dodecahedron cells is the same colour.\n*120-colour full puzzle.\n\nThe controls are very similar to the 4-D Magic Cube with controls for 4-D perspective, cell size, sticker size and distance and the usual zoom and rotation. Additionally, there is the ability to completely turn off groups of cells based on selection of tori, 4-cube cells, layers or rings.\n\nGravitation3d has created a \"Hall of Fame\" for solvers, who must provide a log file for their solution.

Retrieved 4 April 2009.</ref> A 3-D puzzle could be constructed with no stickers on the third dimension which would then behave as a 2-D puzzle but the true implementation of the puzzle remains in the virtual world. The implementation shown here is from Superliminal who  call it the 2D Magic Cube.\n\nThe puzzle is not of any great interest to solvers as its solution is quite trivial. In large part this is because it is not possible to put a piece in position with a twist. Some of the most difficult algorithms on the standard Rubik's Cube are to deal with such twists where a piece is in its correct position but not in the correct orientation. With higher-dimension puzzles this twisting can take on the rather disconcerting form of a piece being apparently inside out. One has only to compare the difficulty of the 2×2×2 puzzle with the 3×3 (which has the same number of pieces) to see that this ability to cause twists in higher dimensions has much to do with difficulty, and hence satisfaction with solving, the ever popular Rubik's Cube.\n\n{|\n|colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#88DDDD;font-weight:bold;\"|Piece count<ref name=\"pieces\"/>\n|-\n|Number of vertices||style=\"width:50px;\"|4||Number of 2-colour pieces||4\n|-\n|Number of edges||4||Number of 1-colour pieces||4\n|-\n|Number of faces||1||Number of 0-colour pieces||1\n|-\n|style=\"width:150px;\"|Number of coloured pieces||8\n|-\n|Number of stickers||12\n|}\n\nAchievable combinations:\n\n: <math>=4!\\,\\! = 24 </math>\n\nThe centre pieces are in a fixed orientation relative to each other (in exactly the same way as the centre pieces on the standard 3×3×3 cube) and hence do not figure in the calculation of combinations.\n\nThis puzzle is not really a true 2-dimensional analogue of the Rubik's Cube. If the group of operations on a single polytope of an ''n''-dimensional puzzle is defined as any rotation of an (''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)-dimensional polytope in (''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;1)-dimensional space then the size of the group,\n\n*for the 5-cube is rotations of a 4-polytope in 4-space = 8×6×4 = 192,\n*for the 4-cube is rotations of a 3-polytope (cube) in 3-space = 6×4 = 24,\n*for the 3-cube is rotations of a 2-polytope (square) in 2-space = 4\n*for the 2-cube is rotations of a 1-polytope in 1-space = 1\n\nIn other words, the 2D puzzle cannot be scrambled at all if the same restrictions are placed on the moves as for the real 3D puzzle. The moves actually given to the 2D Magic Cube are the operations of reflection. This reflection operation can be extended to higher-dimension puzzles. For the 3D cube the analogous operation would be removing a face and replacing it with the stickers facing into the cube. For the 4-cube, the analogous operation is removing a cube and replacing it inside-out.\n\n==1D projection==\n\nAnother alternate-dimension puzzle is a view achievable in David Vanderschel's Magic Cube 3D. A 4-cube projected on to a 2D computer screen is an example of a general type of an ''n''-dimensional puzzle projected on to a (''n''&nbsp;–&nbsp;2)-dimensional space. The 3D analogue of this is to project the cube on to a 1-dimensional representation, which is what Vanderschel's program is capable of doing.\n\nVanderschel bewails that nobody has claimed to have solved the 1D projection of this puzzle.<ref>[http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/4D_Cubing/message/330 Vanderschel posting on the 4D Cubing group at Yahoo] retrieved and [https://www.webcitation.org/5dKVJKczw archived] 25 December 2008.</ref> However, since records are not being kept for this puzzle it might not actually be the case that it is unsolved.\n[[File:1drubik'scube.png|thumb|1-dimensional projection of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube as shown in Magic Cube 3D.]]\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Rubik's Cube group]]\n*[[List of Rubik's Cube software]]\n*[[List of four dimensional games]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*H.

      "text": "[[Image:Rubik's cube scrambled.svg|150px|right|thumb|A computer graphic of a scrambled Rubik's Cube]]'''Optimal solutions for [[Rubik's Cube]]''' refer to solutions that are the shortest. There are two common ways to measure the length of a solution.  The first is to count the number of quarter turns. The second is to count the number of outer-layer twists, called \"face turns\". A move to turn an outer layer two quarter (90°) turns in the same direction would be counted as two moves in the quarter turn metric (QTM), but as one turn in the face metric (FTM, or HTM \"Half Turn Metric\", or OBTM \"Outer Block Turn Metric\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#12a3|title=World Cube Association|website=www.worldcubeassociation.org|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>\n\nThe maximum number of face turns needed to solve any instance of the Rubik's Cube is 20,<ref name=\"cube20_ftm\" /> and the maximum number of quarter turns is 26.<ref name=\"cube20_qtm\" /> These numbers are also the [[Distance (graph theory)|diameters]] of the corresponding  [[Cayley graph]]s of the [[Rubik's Cube group]]. In STM (slice turn metric) it's unknown.\n\nThere are many [[algorithm]]s to solve scrambled [[Rubik's Cube]]s. An algorithm that solves a cube in the minimum number of moves is known as [[God's algorithm]].\n\n== Move notation ==\n{{main|Rubik's_Cube#Move_notation|l1=Rubik's Cube Move notation}}\n\nTo denote a sequence of moves on the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube, this article uses \"Singmaster notation\",<ref>{{cite book|author=Joyner, David |title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2002 |pages=7 |isbn=0-8018-6947-1}}</ref> which was developed by [[David Singmaster]]. \n\nThe letters L, R, F, B, U, and D indicate a clockwise quarter turn of the left, right, front, back, up, and down face respectively. Half turns are indicated by appending a 2. A counterclockwise quarter turn is indicated by appending a [[Prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] (&nbsp;′&nbsp;).\n\nThe letters M, S and E are used to denote the turning of a middle layer. M represents turning the layer between the R and L faces 1 quarter turn top to bottom. S represents turning the layer between the F and B faces 1 quarter turn clockwise, as seen from the front. E represents turning the layer between the U and D faces 1 quarter turn clockwise left to right. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a double turn and a prime (') indicates a quarter turn anticlockwise.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/|title=Rubik's Cube Notation|work=Ruwix|access-date=2017-03-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe letters X, Y and Z are used to signify cube rotations. X signifies the rotation of the cube forwards 90 degrees. Y signifies the rotation of the cube to the left 90 degrees. Z signifies the rotation of the cube clockwise 90 degrees. These cube rotations are used in algorithms to the algorithms smoother and faster. As with regular turns, a 2 signifies a half rotation and a prime (') indicates a quarter rotation in the opposite direction. Note that these letters are usually lowercase instead.\n\n==Lower bounds==\n\nIt can be proven by counting arguments that there exist positions needing at least 18 moves to solve. To show this, first count the number of cube positions that exist in total, then count the number of positions achievable using at most 17 moves starting from a solved cube. It turns out that the latter number is smaller. \n\nThis argument was not improved upon for many years. Also, it is not a [[constructive proof]]: it does not exhibit a concrete position that needs this many moves. It was [[conjecture]]d that the so-called [[superflip]] would be a position that is very difficult.  A Rubik's Cube is in the superflip pattern when each corner piece is in the correct position, but each edge piece is incorrectly oriented.<ref name=\"reid-bryan_1995\">[http://cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/m_symmetric.html Michael Reid's Rubik's Cube page M-symmetric positions]</ref> In 1992, a solution for the superflip with 20 face turns was found by [[Dik T. Winter]], of which the minimality was shown in 1995 by [[Michael Reid (mathematician)|Michael Reid]], providing a new lower bound for the diameter of the cube group. Also in 1995, a solution for superflip in 24 quarter turns was found by Michael Reid, with its minimality proven by [[Jerry Bryan]].<ref name=\"reid-bryan_1995\"/> In 1998, a new position requiring more than 24 quarter turns to solve was found. The position, which was called a 'superflip composed with four spot' needs 26 quarter turns.<ref>[http://cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/Cubelovers/cube-mail-25 Posted to Cube lovers on 2 Aug 1998]</ref>\n\n==Upper bounds==\n\nThe first upper bounds were based on the 'human' algorithms. By combining the worst-case scenarios for each part of these algorithms, the typical upper bound was found to be around 100.\n\nPerhaps the first concrete value for an upper bound was the 277 moves mentioned by [[David Singmaster]] in early 1979. He simply counted the maximum number of moves required by his cube-solving algorithm.<ref name=\"rikvangrol_2010\" />{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=16}} Later, Singmaster reported that [[Elwyn Berlekamp]], [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]], and [[Richard K. Guy]] had come up with a different algorithm that took at most 160 moves.<ref name=\"rikvangrol_2010\" />{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=26}} Soon after, Conway’s Cambridge Cubists reported that the cube could be restored in at most 94 moves.<ref name=\"rikvangrol_2010\" />{{sfn|Singmaster|1981|p=30}}\n\n===Thistlethwaite's algorithm===\nThe breakthrough, known as \"descent through nested sub-groups\" was found by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]]; details of [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's algorithm]] were published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1981 by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. The approaches to the cube that led to algorithms with very few moves are based on [[group (mathematics)|group theory]] and on extensive computer searches. Thistlethwaite's idea was to divide the problem into subproblems. Where algorithms up to that point divided the problem by looking at the parts of the cube that should remain fixed, he divided it by restricting the type of moves that could be executed. In particular he divided the [[Rubik's Cube group|cube group]] into the following chain of subgroups:\n\n*<math>G_0=\\langle L,R,F,B,U,D\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_1=\\langle L,R,F,B,U^2,D^2\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_2=\\langle L,R,F^2,B^2,U^2,D^2\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_3=\\langle L^2,R^2,F^2,B^2,U^2,D^2\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_4=\\{1\\}</math>\n\nNext he prepared tables for each of the right [[coset]] spaces <math>G_{i+1}\\setminus G_i</math>. For each element he found a sequence of moves that took it to the next smaller group. After these preparations he worked as follows. A random cube is in the general cube group <math>G_0</math>. Next he found this element in the right [[coset]] space <math>G_1\\setminus G_0</math>. He applied the corresponding process to the cube. This took it to a cube in <math>G_1</math>. Next he looked up a process that takes the cube to <math>G_2</math>, next to <math>G_3</math> and finally to <math>G_4</math>.\n[[File:Rubik-3-facelet-kociemba.png|thumb|Intermediate state of the Rubik's Cube in Kociemba's algorithm. Any state from G<sub>1</sub> will have the \"+\" and \"–\" symbols as shown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kociemba.org/math/20moves/subgroupH.html |title=The Subgroup H and its cosets |author=Herbert Kociemba |accessdate=2013-07-28 }}</ref>|518x518px]]\n\nAlthough the whole cube group <math>G_0</math> is very large (~4.3&times;10<sup>19</sup>), the right coset spaces <math>G_1\\setminus G_0, G_2\\setminus G_1, G_3\\setminus G_2</math> and <math>G_3</math> are much smaller.\nThe coset space <math>G_2\\setminus G_1</math> is the largest and contains only 1082565 elements. The number of moves required by this algorithm is the sum of the largest process in each step.\n\nInitially, Thistlethwaite showed that any configuration could be solved in at most 85 moves. In January 1980 he improved his strategy to yield a maximum of 80 moves. Later that same year, he reduced the number to 63, and then again to 52.<ref name=\"rikvangrol_2010\" /> By exhaustively searching the coset spaces it was later found that the worst possible number of moves for each stage was 7, 10, 13, and 15 giving a total of 45 moves at most.<ref>[http://cubeman.org/dotcs.txt Progressive Improvements in Solving Algorithms]</ref>\n\n===Kociemba's algorithm===\nThistlethwaite's algorithm was improved by [[Herbert Kociemba]] in 1992. He reduced the number of intermediate groups to only two:\n*<math>G_0=\\langle U,D,L,R,F,B\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_1=\\langle U,D,L^2,R^2,F^2,B^2\\rangle</math>\n*<math>G_2=\\{1\\}</math>\n\nAs with [[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's Algorithm]], he would search through the right coset space <math>G_1\\setminus G_0</math> to take the cube to group <math>G_1</math>. Next he searched the optimal solution for group <math>G_1</math>. The searches in <math>G_1\\setminus G_0</math> and <math>G_1</math> were both done with a method equivalent to [[IDA*]]. The search in <math>G_1\\setminus G_0</math> needs at most 12 moves and the search in <math>G_1</math> at most 18 moves, as Michael Reid showed in 1995. By also generating suboptimal solutions that take the cube to group <math>G_1</math> and looking for short solutions in <math>G_1</math>, much shorter overall solutions are usually obtained. Using this algorithm solutions are typically found of fewer than 21 moves, though there is no proof that it will always do so.\n\nIn 1995 Michael Reid proved that using these two groups every position can be solved in at most 29 face turns, or in 42 quarter turns. This result was improved by Silviu Radu in 2005 to 40.\n\nAt first glance, this algorithm appears to be impractically inefficient - If <math>G_0</math>contains 18 possible moves (each move, its prime, and its 180 degree rotation), that leaves <math>18^{12}</math>(Over 1 quadrillion) cube states to be searched.  Even with a [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]]-based computer algorithm like [[Iterative deepening A*|IDA*]], which may narrow it down considerably, searching through that many states is likely not practical.  To solve this problem, Kociemba devised a lookup table that provides an exact heuristic for <math>G_0</math>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kociemba.org/cube.htm|title=Solve Rubik's Cube with Cube Explorer|website=kociemba.org|access-date=2018-11-27}}</ref>  When the exact number of moves needed to reach <math>G_1</math>is available, the search becomes virtually instantaneous - one need only generate 18 cube states for each of the 12 moves and choose the one with the lowest heuristic each time.  This allows the second heuristic, that for <math>G_1</math>, to be less precise and still allow for a solution to be computed in reasonable time on a modern computer.\n\n===Korf's algorithm===\nUsing these group solutions combined with computer searches will generally quickly give very short solutions. But these solutions do not always come with a guarantee of their minimality. To search specifically for minimal solutions a new approach was needed.\n\nIn 1997 Richard Korf<ref>{{cite article\n | author = Richard Korf\n | title = Finding Optimal Solutions to Rubik's Cube Using Pattern Databases\n | url = http://www-compsci.swan.ac.uk/~csphil/CS335/korfrubik.pdf\n | year = 1997\n}}</ref> announced an algorithm with which he had optimally solved random instances of the cube. Of the ten random cubes he did, none required more than 18 face turns. The method he used is called [[IDA*]] and is described in his paper \"Finding Optimal Solutions to Rubik's Cube Using Pattern Databases\". Korf describes this method as follows\n: IDA* is a depth-first search that looks for increasingly longer solutions in a series of iterations, using a lower-bound heuristic to prune branches once a lower bound on their length exceeds the current iterations bound.\n\nIt works roughly as follows. First he identified a number of subproblems that are small enough to be solved optimally. He used:\n\n#The cube restricted to only the corners, not looking at the edges\n#The cube restricted to only 6 edges, not looking at the corners nor at the other edges.\n#The cube restricted to the other 6 edges.\n\nClearly the number of moves required to solve any of these subproblems is a lower bound for the number of moves needed to solve the entire cube.\n\nGiven a [[random]] cube C, it is solved as [[iterative deepening]]. First all cubes are generated that are the result of applying 1 move to them. That is C * F, C * U, … Next, from this list, all cubes are generated that are the result of applying two moves. Then three moves and so on. If at any point a cube is found that needs too many moves based on the upper bounds to still be optimal it can be eliminated from the list.\n\nAlthough this [[algorithm]] will always find optimal solutions, there is no worst case analysis. It is not known how many moves this algorithm might need. An implementation of this algorithm can be found here.<ref>[http://www.cflmath.com/~reid/Rubik/optimal_solver.html Michael Reid's Optimal Solver for Rubik's Cube] (requires a compiler such as gcc)</ref>\n\n===Further improvements, and finding God's Number===\nIn 2006, Silviu Radu further improved his methods to prove that every position can be solved in at most 27 face turns or 35 quarter turns.<ref>[http://forum.cubeman.org/?q=node/view/53 Rubik can be solved in 27f]</ref> Daniel Kunkle and Gene Cooperman in 2007 used a [[supercomputer]] to show that all unsolved cubes can be solved in no more than 26 moves (in face-turn metric). Instead of attempting to solve each of the billions of variations explicitly, the computer was programmed to bring the cube to one of 15,752 states, each of which could be solved within a few extra moves. All were proved solvable in 29 moves, with most solvable in 26. Those that could not initially be solved in 26 moves were then solved explicitly, and shown that they too could be solved in 26 moves.<ref>[http://www.neu.edu/nupr/news/0507/rubik.html Press Release on Proof that 26 Face Turns Suffice]</ref><ref>\n{{cite conference\n  | first = D.\n  | last = Kunkle\n  | author2 = Cooperman, C.\n  | title = Twenty-Six Moves Suffice for Rubik's Cube\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC '07)\n  | year = 2007 \n  | publisher = ACM Press\n  | url = http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/gene/papers/rubik.pdf\n  | format = PDF\n}}</ref>\n\nTomas Rokicki reported in a 2008 computational proof that all unsolved cubes could be solved in 25 moves or fewer.<ref>\n{{cite arxiv\n|eprint=0803.3435\n|title=Twenty-Five Moves Suffice for Rubik's Cube\n|author=Tom Rokicki\n}}</ref> This was later reduced to 23 moves.<ref>[http://forum.cubeman.org/?q=node/view/117 Twenty-Three Moves Suffice] — Domain of the Cube Forum</ref> In August 2008 Rokicki announced that he had a proof for 22 moves.<ref>[http://forum.cubeman.org/?q=node/view/121 twenty-two moves suffice]</ref>\n\nFinally, in 2010, Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson, and John Dethridge gave the final [[computer-assisted proof]] that all cube positions could be solved with a maximum of 20 face turns.<ref name=\"cube20_ftm\" />\nIn 2009, Tomas Rokicki proved that 29 moves in the quarter-turn metric is enough to solve any scrambled cube.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.cubeman.org/?q=node/view/143|title=Twenty-Nine QTM Moves Suffice|author = Tom Rokicki|accessdate= 2010-02-19}}</ref> And in 2014, Tomas Rokicki and Morley Davidson proved that the maximum number of quarter-turns needed to solve the cube is 26.<ref name=\"cube20_qtm\" />\n\nThe face-turn and quarter-turn metrics differ in the nature of their antipodes.<ref name=\"cube20_qtm\" />\nAn antipode is a scrambled cube that is maximally far from solved, one that requires the maximum number of moves to solve.

He is best known for the invention of [[mechanical puzzle]]s including [[Rubik's Cube]] (1974), [[Rubik's Magic]], [[Rubik's Magic#Rubik.27s Magic: Master Edition|Rubik's Magic: Master Edition]], and [[Rubik's Snake]].<ref name=\"sporting\">{{Cite book|author=William Fotheringham |title=Fotheringham's Sporting Pastimes |publisher=Anova Books |year=2007 |page= 50|isbn=1-86105-953-1}}</ref>\n\nWhile Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik's Cube and his other puzzles, much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in education. Rubik is involved with several organisations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation all of whose aim is to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age.\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood and parental influence===\nErnő Rubik was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary, 13 July 1944, during [[World War II]], and has lived all his life in Hungary. His father, [[Ernő Rubik (aircraft designer)|Ernő Rubik Sr.]], was a flight engineer at the [[Esztergom]] aircraft factory, and his mother, Magdolna Szántó, was a poet.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{cite book|last=|first=|authorlink=|author2=|title=International Who's Who 2000|publisher=Europa|year=1999|location=|pages=1342|url=|isbn=1-85743-050-6}}</ref> He has stated in almost every interview that he got his inspiration from his father.\n\nHis father, Ernő Sr., was a highly respected engineer of [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]]. His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ernő Rubik has stated that:<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\n{{quote|Beside him I learned a lot about work in the sense of a value-creating process which has a target, and a positive result too. Both figuratively and literally he was a person capable of 'moving a hill'. There was nothing that could prevent him from doing what he decided or bringing a project to a completion, if necessary even with his own hands. No work was unworthy or undeserving for him.}}\n\nRubik studied sculpture at the Technical University in Budapest and architecture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary’s state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik’s Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik’s Cube. Following his cube’s popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik’s Magic.\n\n===Education===\nFrom 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialised in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Budapest University of Technology]] where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was on the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\nRubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik has stated that \"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\"<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early professorship and birth of Rubik's Cube===\nFrom 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the [[Hungarian University of Applied Arts|Budapest College of Applied Arts]] (''Iparművészeti Főiskola''). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the [[Rubik's Cube]] in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with [[CNN]], Rubik stated that he was \"searching to find a good task for my students.\"<ref name=\"CNN\">[http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/10/tech/rubiks-cube-inventor The little cube that changed the world] Retrieved 2013-04-29.</ref>\n\n{{quote|Space always intrigued me, with its incredibly rich possibilities, space alteration by (architectural) objects, objects' transformation in space (sculpture, design), movement in space and in time, their correlation, their repercussion on mankind, the relation between man and space, the object and time. I think the CUBE arose from this interest, from this search for expression and for this always more increased acuteness of these thoughts...}}\n\n[[File:Rubik's cube v3.svg|thumb|Rubik's Cube]]\n\n===From classroom tool to Magic Cube to Rubik's Cube===\nStarting with blocks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set out to create a structure which would allow the individual pieces to move without the whole structure falling apart. Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together<ref name=\"CNN\"/>\n\nRubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that, because of the cube's simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik's father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces.<ref name=\"Rubik Interview\"/> The cube was originally known in Hungary as the 'Magic Cube'.\n\nRubik licensed the Magic Cube to [[Ideal Toys]], a US company in 1979. Ideal rebranded The Magic Cube to the Rubik's Cube before its introduction to an international audience in 1980.<ref name=\"IBT\">Villapaz, Luke.[http://www.ibtimes.com/rubiks-cube-40th-anniversary-9-facts-behind-famous-3-d-toy-puzzle-1576562 \"Rubik's Cube 40th Anniversary: 9 Facts Behind The Famous 3-D Toy Puzzle\"].International Business Times, 25 April 2014.

      "text": "{{Orphan|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[File:Cube scram to set.png|thumb]]\nThe original Rubik's cube was a mechanical 3×3×3 cube puzzle invented in 1974 by the Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture [[Ernő Rubik]]. Extensions of the Rubik's cube have been around for a long time and come in both hardware and software forms. The major extension have been the availability of cubes of larger size and the availability of the more complex cubes with marked centres. The properties of Rubik’s family cubes of any size together with some special attention to software cubes is the main focus of this article. Many properties are mathematical in nature and are functions of the cube size variable.\n\n==Definitions==\nIn the main, the terminology used here is in agreement with what is in general use. Elsewhere, some terms are used with different meanings. To avoid misconceptions, the meaning of most terms in use in this article is defined below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Cube size\n|| The standard Rubik's cube is often referred to as a 3×3×3 cube. That cube will be referred to as a size 3 cube and in general an <math>n\\times n\\times n</math> cube will be referred to as a size <math>n</math> cube.\n|-\n! Rubik cube family\n|| Cubes that have similar rotational properties to the standard Rubik's size 3 cube and obey generalized rules for a size <math>n</math> cube are considered to be members of the Rubik cube family. Cubes of size 2 and above that meet this condition are available.\n|-\n! Cubie\n|| Individual cube elements will be referred to as cubies (others sometimes refer to them as \"cubelets\"). There are three types of cubies: corner cubies (three coloured surfaces), edge cubies (two coloured surfaces) and centre cubies (one coloured surface). The absolute centre cubies for odd size cubes sit on the central axes of the six faces and their relative positions never change.\n|-\n! Cubicle\n|| A cubicle is the compartment in which a cubie resides. For a permutation (defined below), cubicles are considered to occupy fixed positions in the space occupied by the cube object but their contents (cubies) may shift position.\n|-\n! Facelet\n|| A facelet is a visible coloured surface of a cubie (corner cubies have three facelets, edge cubies have two and centre cubies have one).\n|-\n! Cube style\n|| Two cube styles are referred to herein: firstly a standard cube with unmarked centres and secondly a cube with marked centres.\n|-\n! Cube state\n|| A particular arrangement of the cubies will be referred to as a cube state. What looks the same is considered to be the same (unless specific mention to the contrary is made). Each state has equal probability of being produced after a genuine random scrambling sequence. A rotation of the whole cube does not change the state considered herein. In other texts the various states are often referred to as permutations or arrangements.\n|-\n! Cube layer\n|| A cube layer is a one-cubie-thick slice of the cube perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Outer layers (faces) contain more cubies than inner layers. For a cube of size <math>n</math> there will be <math>n</math> layers along any given axis.\n|-\n! Cube face\n|| The meaning of a cube face depends on the context in which it is used. It usually means one of the six three-dimensional outer layers but can also refer to just the outside layer's surface which is perpendicular to its axis of rotation. The faces are usually designated as up (U), down (D), front (F), back (B), left (L) and right (R).\n|-\n! Set state\n|| The set (or solved) state of the cube is one for which a uniform colour appears on each of the six faces. For cubes with marked centres the set state is characterised by a unique arrangement of all centre cubies and the labelling of those cubies must reflect that.\n|-\n! Scrambled state\n|| The scrambled state is the starting point for unscrambling the cube. It arises when a cube in the set or any other state is subject to a large number of randomly chosen layer rotations.\n|-\n! \"Fixed-in-space\" axes of rotation\n|| There are [[Cartesian coordinate system|three mutually perpendicular axes]] of rotation for the cube. One set of axes defined in terms of D, U, B, F, L and R terms can be considered to have a fixed orientation in space. Think of these axes as belonging to a cube-shaped container in which the cube object can be positioned in any of 24 orientations. One axis can be drawn through the centres of the D and U faces (the DU axis). The others are the BF and LR axes.\n|-\n! \"Cube object\" axes of rotation\n|| Another set of axes can be defined for the cube object itself. These axes relate to the face colours, the most common being white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue. The axes are usually white-blue, red-orange and yellow-green. For odd size cubes these axes are always fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object. For even size cubes these axes remain fixed relative to the internal frame of the cube object after initial selections. The origin for the axes is the centre of the cube object.\n|-\n! Layer rotation\n|| The only way that cube state can be changed is by rotations of cube layers about their axes of rotation. All changes of state involve rotation steps that can be considered as a sequence of single layer quarter turns.\n|-\n! Orbit\n|| For a basic quarter turn of a cube layer for cubes of all sizes, sets-of-four cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories. When all the possible trajectories for a given cubie type are considered for the whole cube we will refer to all the possible movement positions as being in a given orbit. We consider that the size 3 cube has two orbits, one in which the eight corner cubies are constrained to move and one in which the 12 edge cubies are constrained to move. Transfer of cubies between these orbits is impossible.\n\nFor cubes of size 4 and above we will also define an edge cubie orbit as comprising 12 cubies but will use the term complementary orbit to describe a pair of orbits between which edge cubies can move. A pair of complementary edge cubie orbits contains a total of 24 cubies. Cubes of size 4 and above include centre cubie orbits that contain 24 cubies. Transfer of cubies between one such orbit and another is not possible (applies to cubes of size 5 and above).\n|-\n! Move\n|| A move is a quarter turn rotation of a layer or a sequence of such quarter turns that a person would apply as a single step.\n|-\n! Move notation\n|| A clockwise quarter turn of an outer layer is usually expressed as U, D, F, B, L or R. In other respects the notation used varies among authors.\n|-\n! Algorithm\n|| An algorithm defines a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state. Usually an algorithm is expressed as a printable character sequence according to some move notation. An algorithm can be considered to be a \"smart\" move. All algorithms are moves but few moves are considered to be algorithms.\n|-\n! [[Permutation group|Permutation]]\n|| A permutation of the cube as used herein means the act of permuting (i.e. rearranging) the positions of cubies. A permutation is an all-inclusive term which includes a sequence of quarter turns of any length Even the solving of the cube from a scrambled state represents a permutation. The term \"permutation\" is used extensively by mathematicians who use [[Group (mathematics)|Group Theory]] to quantify the process involved in a rearrangement of cubies. \n\nThe term \"permutation\" is also often used to mean the state of the cube that results after it is rearranged but that meaning will not be used herein. In such cases the term \"cube state\" will be used. That allows the term \"permutation\" to be used when the permutation results in no change of state - an area of special interest for Rubik’s family cube permutations.\n|-\n! [[Parity (mathematics)|Parity]]\n|| A cube permutation can be represented by a number of swaps of two cubies. If that number is even the permutation has even parity, and if the number is odd the permutation has odd parity.\n|}\n\n==Cube types==\n\n=== Hardware cubes ===\nHardware (physical) cubes are based on the original size 3 cube invented by Erno Rubik in 1974. These cubes usually use coloured stickers on the facelets for cubie identification. The [[Rubik's Cube|size 3]] standard Rubik’s cube gained peak interest in the 1980s and was closely followed by the [[Rubik's Revenge|size 4]] (Rubik's Revenge) cube. Other, usually more recently available, hardware forms of the cube come in [[Pocket Cube|size 2]] (Pocket Cube), [[Professor's Cube|size 5]] (Professor's Cube), [[V-Cube 6|size 6]] (V-Cube 6) and [[V-Cube 7|size 7]] (V-Cube 7). Lesser known hardware cubes of larger sizes have also been produced. Currently, the largest hardware cube made is the size 33<ref>https://www.puzzlcrate.com/blog/2017/12/12/how-gregs-33x33-was-assembled-video</ref>, and the largest mass-produced is size 17<ref>https://thecubicle.us/yuxin-huanglong-17x17-p-10097.html</ref>.\n\n===Software cubes===\nIn parallel with the hardware form of the cube there are many software forms available that obey the same rules as the hardware forms. Software cube [[emulator]]s are not subject to the physical restraints that impose a size limit on the hardware forms. Hence the only really big cubes available are those in software form. Also, unlike the hardware forms, a range of cube sizes can easily be accommodated by the one program. The design characteristics of programs that allow users to unscramble cubes vary considerably with such features as the capability to allow the user to save a partially unscrambled state being often available.\n\nSoftware cubes were in use in the 1980s when monochrome monitors were in common use. The lack of colour meant a different way of face identification was required. A [[#Large Freeware cubes|program]] that retained 1980s monochrome capability (using numerals 1 to 6 to identify facelets) for cubes in the size 2 to 11 range was produced in 1991 (together with colour capability in the size 2 to 15 range). More recently developed software cubes use coloured facelets as for hardware cubes.\n\nThe most common, but by no means universal, approach is to emulate the cube by providing a \"three-dimensional\" display of the cube that makes it look like a real hardware cube. A drawback of the \"three-dimensional\" display is that, without some extra enhancements, the state of parts of the cube for any given view is hidden.\n\nOther interactive software approaches that do not emulate a three-dimensional cube are also used by some programmers. Generally, an aim of such approaches is to allow the state of all cubies to be in view all the time but has the disadvantage (for some viewers) that the display does not appear like a real-world cube. A conventional two-dimensional (unfolded) display with all cube elements appearing of equal size is one approach. Another form of display where all cube elements do not appear of equal size is also in use. The upper cube size limit for software cubes is limited by the monitor’s available pixels and what viewers find as acceptable which, in turn, is a function of their visual acuity. For cubes of large size it can be advantageous to allow a portion of the cube to be scrolled out of view.\n\nAll emulators provide a means for the user to change the cube state step-by-step and unscramble the cube. Most emulators use mouse movements to control the rotation of the cube elements, others use keyboard commands, and some use a combination of both.\n\nSoftware cubes present some major capabilities that are not possible with hardware cubes. Instant return to the set state is always available. If the program allows a partially unscrambled state to be saved then, by regularly updating the saved state, users need not despair if they do something that leaves their cube in a mess. They can return to their previously recorded state and continue from there. The bigger the cube the more helpful such a capability becomes.\n\nSome [[Freeware]] large cube (size greater than 10) implementations are [[#Large Freeware cubes|available]].\n\n==Cube design variants==\nWhile there are multiple variants in use only two will be considered here: \n* Standard cubes with unmarked centres.\n* Cubes with marked centres.\n\n=== Standard cubes with unmarked centres ===\nA 2-layer (size 2) cube has corner cubies only.\n \nCubes of size 2 and size 3 have single solutions meaning that all the cube elements can have only one correct location for a solved cube.\n \nCentre cubies differ from the corner and edge cubies in that their orientation or position has multiple possibilities. For cubes of odd size, there will be a centre cubie that is centrally located on the cube face and that cubie has only one correct location for a solved cube. However, multiple locations of all other centre cubies apply for a solved cube. The centre cubies (other than the single central one for cubes of odd size) form sets-of-four on each face and sets-of-24 for the whole cube for the various orbits. These centre cubies have four possible final positions (their orientation changes with position but cannot be changed independently) that would satisfy the solved state. \n\n=== Cubes with marked centres ===\nTypically, hardware cubes with marked centres use images or logos on the faces to designate what centre cubie(s) orientation is required for a solved cube. Such cubes are also referred to as \"supercubes\" and the application of markings of this type is generally restricted to just cubes of very small size.\n \nSolving a cube with marked centres is considerably more complex than that for standard cubes. The use of jig-saw style image marking on cubes of large size would make a difficult task even more difficult. Two possibilities in current use on software cubes are the use of a numerical graphic in the \"1\" to \"4\" range and the use of a corner marking graphic. \n\nThere is a direct correspondence between numerical and corner marking. A top left corner quadrant marking is equivalent to a numerical marking 1, second quadrant to 2, third quadrant to 3, and fourth quadrant to 4. The following image illustrates these different forms of marking. \n\n[[File:Num cnr marking.png|thumb|center|364 px]]\n\nBecause transfer of cubies between orbits is impossible, the same 1-2-3-4 markings can be used for each orbit. With the exception of the absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size, there are 24 centre cubies (4 per face) in each orbit. If <math>n</math> is cube size, there will be <math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math> orbits where <math>a</math> is zero if <math>n</math> is even or <math>a</math> is one if <math>n</math> is odd. \n\nNumerical marking is typically applicable for cubes up to about size 32. Corner marking while less user-friendly can allow the marked centres range to be extended beyond the numerical marking limit.\n\nExcept for absolute centre marking for cubes of odd size, numerical marking would provide the best means of centre cubie marking for hardware cubes as their size range is limited. Rotation of the numbers would mean a small inconvenience relative to non-rotated numbers that can be used for software cubes. The big advantage of numbers is that they reduce the complexity of solving the last cube face when markings are in use (e.g. if the set-of-four sequence is 1-3-4-2 (even parity, needs two swaps to become the required 1-2-3-4) then the algorithm requirement is clear. Algorithms have been defined in<ref name=\"fraser_marked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/markctr.pdf \"Implementing and Solving Rubik's Family Cubes with Marked Centres\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and are, of course, equally applicable to hardware cubes.\n\n==Rules for Rubik’s family cubes==\nA cube is solvable if the set state has existed some time in the past and if no tampering of the cube has occurred (e.g. by rearrangement of stickers on hardware cubes or by doing the equivalent on software cubes).

Those rules limit what arrangements are possible and mean that, of the possible unrestricted cubie arrangements, the number that are unreachable far outnumber those that are reachable.\n\nCubes of all sizes have three mutually perpendicular axes about which one or more layers can be rotated. All moves for the cube can be considered as a sequence of quarter-turn rotations about these axes. The movement possibilities give rise to a set of rules (or laws) which in most cases can be expressed in analytical terms.\n\nFor a cube of size <math>n</math>:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em;\n|Number of corner cubies\n|<math>8</math>\n|-\n|Number of edge cubies\n|<math>12\\left(n-2\\right)</math>\n|-\n|Number of centre cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>\n|-\n|Number of facelets\n|<math>6n^2</math>\n|-\n|Total number of cubies\n|<math>6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2</math>\n|-\n|Increase in total number of cubies for unit increase in cube size from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math>\n|<math>12n-6</math>\n|}\nEvery cube move can be considered as a permutation. The relationship between the cube state after a move with that before a move can be expressed mathematically using Group Theory<ref name=\"davis_permut\">Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/group.pdf \"Group Theory via Rubik’s Cube\"].

Since every move can be considered as a sequence of quarter turn rotations, it is appropriate to examine what is involved in a quarter turn rotation. Except for the absolute centre cubie for odd size cubes, during the quarter turn the cubies move in separate four-cubicle trajectories (also referred to as a 4-cycle movement since four quarter turns will restore the cubies in the specified trajectory to their original positions). A quarter turn of a 4-cubie set can be represented by three swaps as indicated below where swap 1-2 means the contents of cubicle 1 is swapped with the contents of cubicle 2, etc.{{col-begin|width=auto; margin:0 auto}}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Start\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 1/A\n| width=\"50%\" | 2/B\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | 4/D\n| width=\"50%\" | 3/C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-2\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" | Swap 1-3\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em 1em; width:9em; text-align:center;\" cellpadding=5\n|+ style=\"font-weight:normal;\" |Swap 1-4\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | D\n| width=\"50%\" | A\n|-\n| width=\"50%\" | C\n| width=\"50%\" | B\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe parity<ref>Ryan Heise, [http://www.ryanheise.com/cube/parity.html \"Rubik's Cube Theory - Parity\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> of a permutation refers to whether that permutation is even or odd. An even permutation is one that can be represented by an even number of swaps while an odd permutation is one that can be represented by an odd number of swaps. An odd permutation followed by an odd permutation will represent an overall even permutation (adding two odd numbers always returns an even number). Since a quarter turn is made up of a number of 4-cycles each involving three swaps, if the number of 4-cycles is odd, overall parity of the quarter turn permutation will be odd and vice versa.\n\nQuarter turn permutation parity for a size <math>n</math> cube is given in the following table.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; max-width:45em; text-align:center;\"\n|- valign=bottom\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Cube size<br />(odd or even)}}\n! style=\"width:15%\" | {{nowrap|Layer type}} \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Number of 4-cycle movements \n! style=\"width:35%\" |Overall parity\n|-\n| odd||inner||<math>n-1</math>||even\n|-\n| odd||outer||<math>\\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1}{4}+\\left(n-1\\right)</math>||even{{Efn|name=a}}\n|-\n| even||inner||<math>n-1</math>||odd\n|-\n| even||outer|| <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2+\\left(n-1\\right)</math> ||even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even {{Efn|name=b}}\n<br>odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd\n|-\n| colspan=4 |{{notelist|refs={{efn|name=a|Since <math>\\left(n-2\\right)^2-1</math> equals <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(n-3\\right)</math>, a product of two consecutive even numbers, which must always be evenly divisible by 8.}} {{efn|name=b|Since <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)^2</math> will be odd if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is odd (i.e. if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even) giving overall even since <math>(n-1)</math> is odd. The reverse applies if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd.}}}}\n|}\nSummarising the above parity results we conclude:\n* All permutations for odd size cubes have even overall parity.\n* All individual quarter turns for even size cubes, where half the cube size is an odd number, have odd overall parity.\n* For even size cubes where half the cube size is an even number, inner layer quarter turns have odd overall parity and outer layer quarter turns have even overall parity.\n\nThe above analysis considered the parity for corner (where applicable), edge and centre cubies combined. It is possible to consider these in isolation and when that is done an even combined quarter turn parity will involve a number of odd parity elements.\n\nStandard cubes (i.e. cubes with unmarked centres) of any size greater than 3 behave exactly like the size 3 cube if only outer layer rotations are permitted. Parity rules dictate that, for cubes of odd size, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies. It can be shown<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> that, for the size 4 cube the swapping and inverting of the two complementary cubies in a single edge set can be achieved without any change in the position of any other cubies. It can also be shown that, for cubes of even size 6 and above, the swapping of the two cubies in a single edge set requires a change in the position of centre cubies.\n\nA permutation as used here takes account of the change in the positions of cubies, not any change in their orientations. For the 24 edge cubie sets (made up of 12 complementary pairs) there is no restriction on position. Orientation is set by position and cannot be changed independently of position.\n\nCorner cubies behave the same for cubes of all sizes. They have three possible orientations made up from a combination of <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> twists where a full twist (about an axis drawn from the cube corner to the cubie's internal corner) returns the corner cubie to its original orientation. If we designate a unit clockwise twist by <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and a unit counter-clockwise twist by <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>, then the twist possibilities for a corner cubie relative to any given initial state (the set state for example) are 0, <math>\\frac{1}{3}</math> and <math>-\\frac{1}{3}</math>. The sum of the twist increments across all corner cubies must always be an integer (0, 1 or 2).\n\nWhen inner layer rotations are included for cubes of size greater than 3, some of the edge cubie movement limitations mentioned above no longer apply. These are expanded on in the [[#Final layer problems|Final layer problems]] section.\n\nCubie position and orientation are of special concern when unscrambling the final layer. Edge cubies must always end up in exactly the same positions they occupied in the initial set state before scrambling. If any edge cubie in a given edge set in the final layer has a wrong orientation (only applicable to cubes of size greater than 3), it must be in a wrong position and will need to be swapped with a complementary edge cubie also having wrong orientation. With everything else in place, corner cubies can be in the right position but two or more can have incorrect orientation. For standard cubes of size greater than 3, there is a negligible possibility that centre cubies (other than absolute centre cubies for cubes of odd size) will occupy the same positions they had in the initial set state (assuming the centre cubies are unmarked).\n\nBoth even and odd size cubes with either marked or unmarked centres obey the rule: \"Any permutation that results in only a rearrangement of centre cubies in 24 cubie orbits must have even parity\".\n\nIf permutations of facelets rather than cubies are considered then both position and orientation of cubies will be taken into account. For software cubes, the states (six colour possibilities) of the <math>6n^2</math> facelets (in a <math>6\\times n\\times n</math> array for instance) is what would allow complete information on cube state to be saved for later use.\n\nA cube of any size that is subject to repeats of the same permutation will eventually return to the state (e.g. the set state) it occupied before the first application of the permutation.<ref name=\"davis_permut\" /><ref name=\"davis_gptheory\" /> The number of times that a permutation has to be applied to first return the cube to its initial state is referred to as the order or the cycle length of the permutation and is applicable to cubes of all sizes. An overall permutation that results in no change of state is referred to as an Identity Permutation. A program that allows permutation cycle length of any size cube to be determined is available<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/unravelcube.htm \"Unravelling Cubes of Size 2x2x2 and Above\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and sample cycle length results have been documented.<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /> For a given permutation, cycle length can vary according to:\n* Cube size.\n* Initial cube state (for standard cubes with unmarked centres).\n* Cube style (whether standard or marked centres are in use).\n* Spatial orientation (checking all 24 of these rather than just one may give a different result).\n\nThe parity of an Identity Permutation is always even. That result for cubes of odd size is obviously true since every quarter turn has even parity. The result is less obvious for cubes of even size. For cubes of even size if the scrambling permutation relative to the previous set state is odd, then any permutation to solve the cube must also have odd parity and vice versa.\n\nThe generalized number of possible states for a size <math>n</math> cube is considered in the [[#Reachable states for cubes of all sizes|Reachable states for cubes of all sizes]] section.\n\n==Cube solving==\n\n===Solving by people===\nCube solving involves starting with a scrambled cube and applying step-by-step layer rotations to eventually end up with a solved cube. For cubes with unmarked centres that means all faces would need to appear in uniform colour. For cubes with marked centres a unique arrangement of all centre cubies in addition to the uniform colour requirement would need to apply. Since the starting point is always different, there can never be a unique set of rotations that can be applied to solve a cube. Usually, people work through the solution with the possible use of [[algorithms]], mainly in the latter stage of the unscrambling. In theory, it is possible for a person to write a computer program that \"thinks\" like a human and solves the cube without human intervention (refer to the [[#Solving by computer program|Solving by computer program]] section).\n\nThe aim of most software cube emulators is to provide a means for the user to interact with the program to solve (unscramble) the cube in a similar manner to the way they would unscramble a hardware cube.\n\nEfficient rotation sequences (algorithms) can be developed using Group Theory permutation mathematics. However, there are many references to the relevant rotation sequences required to solve cubes of small size (refer to some for size 3, 4, and 5 cubes<ref>Peter Still, [http://peter.stillhq.com/jasmine/rubikscubesolution.html \"Beginner Solution to the Rubik's Cube\"].

The steps involved in solving any cube of size greater than 4 are fairly straightforward extensions of those required to solve size 3 and size 4 cubes. However, there is limited availability of generalized instructions that can be applied for solving cubes of any size (particularly the large ones). Generalized guidance on one way of solving standard cubes<ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\">Ken Fraser, [http://www.kenblackbox.com/cube/solving/cubesolving.pdf \"Instructions for Solving Cubes of Various Sizes\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and cubes with marked centres<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> of all sizes is available.\n\nAnybody who can solve a size 4 cube should be able to solve cubes of larger size provided they accept an increased time-to-solve penalty. Software design features, unavailable in hardware cubes, can simplify the cube solving process. For a given set of cube design features the complexity (difficulty) of solving a Rubik’s family cube increases if the number of reachable states increases. Three main properties affect that number:\n# Cube size: The number of cubies to be placed is a [[Quadratic function|quadratic (second order polynomial) function]] of cube size and therefore has a major influence on cube solving complexity.\n# Odd or even size: Even size cubes have an additional effect to just cube size that adds complexity relative to odd size cubes. This effect is relatively small and is independent of cube size (the added contribution when cube size changes from <math>n</math> to <math>\\left(n+1\\right)</math> for <math>n</math> odd is constant). This effect will be expanded upon when the number of reachable states is considered later.\n# Unmarked or marked centre cubies: Centre cubie marking adds complexity to cube solving.\n\nAdditional algorithms to assist users to solve the size 3<ref>Matthew Monroe, [http://www.alchemistmatt.com/cube/rubikcenter.html \"How to handle pictures or logos on the faces\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> and to solve any size<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> cube with marked centres have been defined.\n\n===Large cube issues===\nLarge cube emulators claimed to cater for cubes up to and beyond size 100 are available. Irrespective of what upper size limit is claimed, available pixels (that vary according to the monitor in use) and the user's visual acuity are going to impose practical limits on the maximum cube size that a person can handle.\n\nAs indicated in the [[#Rules for Rubik’s family cubes|Rules for Rubik’s family cubes]] section, total number of cubies is <math>\\left\\{6\\left(n-1\\right)^2+2\\right\\}</math> and the number of centre cubies is <math>6\\left(n-2\\right)^2</math>, where <math>n</math> is cube size. For large size cubes the number of centre cubies becomes very dominant as indicated below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left:1em; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Cube size:\n| width=\"10%\" |4|| width=\"10%\" |8|| width=\"10%\" |16|| width=\"10%\" |32|| width=\"10%\" |64\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Total cubies:\n| width=\"10%\" |56|| width=\"10%\" |296|| width=\"10%\" |1352|| width=\"10%\" |5768|| width=\"10%\" |23816\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:right\" | Centre cubie proportion of total cubies (%):\n| width=\"10%\" |42.8|| width=\"10%\" |73.0|| width=\"10%\" |87.0|| width=\"10%\" |93.6|| width=\"10%\" |96.8\n|}\n\nIt follows that placement of centre cubies will become increasingly more significant than the placement of other cubies as cube size is increased. The time to solve a cube will rise dramatically with cube size. For example, there are about 24 times as many cubies to place in a size 16 cube than there are in a size 4 cube. If the average time to place a cubie were the same in both cases, that factor of 24 in time would also apply. The 24 factor is likely to be an under-estimation because the presence of a large number of cubies makes it more difficult (and time-consuming) to identify what belongs where.\n\nProviding a software program that allows the state of cubes of big size to be changed is not much more difficult than doing the same thing for cubes of small size. However, solving big cubes is a much more demanding and time-consuming task than doing the same for small cubes. Therefore, it is likely that most really big software cubes that are available have never been solved.\n\nIdentifying the exact locations to look for cubies (mainly the quadruple centre cubie sets) is a major issue for big cubes. Use of a secondary marker grid<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /> can ease identification. For example, a marker grid to form 4×4 segments for a size 16 cube (16 such segments per face) could be used.\n\nA common set of six cubie colours adopted for both hardware cubes and software cubes comprises white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue. This colour set may be non-optimum for software cubes of large size where the number of pixels per cubie is small. For instance the differentiation between white and yellow may be problematic. Reducing the number of colors in the red to blue range from five to four and adding violet (the colour at the extreme of the\n[[visible spectrum]]) produces a colour set that may be considered more suitable for cubes of large size. Some software cube implementations allow users to change the default colour set if desired. This is a useful addition for users whose colour perception is at variance with the norm.\n\n===Solving by computer program===\nCube solving by computer program<ref>Eric Dietz(deceased), [http://cubex.sourceforge.net/ \"Rubik's Cube Solver\"]. Retrieved\n2017-02-24.</ref> (as distinct from the normal way people solve a cube) for small size (e.g. size 3) cubes has been developed, and it is equally easy to solve large size cubes by computer.\n\n===Final layer problems===\nA \"final layer problem\" is defined here to mean a need for a rearrangement of final layer edge cubies that cannot be achieved using standard size 3 cube moves. These are often referred to as parity problems or errors, but such terminology may be misleading. If moves were limited to those available to the size 3 cube, such states would be unreachable (break parity rules). There are numerous variations in the way the final layer problems are presented and the algorithms to resolve them, but the correction requirement will be similar to that described below. The problems considered here apply equally to standard cubes and to those with marked centres but in the latter case additional final layer issues arise for aligning centre cubies. The problems for larger cubes can be considered as straightforward extensions of those that apply to the size 4 cube. Basically, two types of problem can arise:\n* There is a need to flip a complementary pair or a complete set of edge cubies in the final edge set. This condition will be referred to as an OLL (orientation of last layer) requirement.\n* There is a need to swap the positions of two edge cubie sets in the final layer. This condition will be referred to as a PLL (permutation of last layer) requirement.\n\nOLL and PLL as used here can be considered to be sub-sets of the [[Fridrich Method|usual definitions]] of these terms. There are many references to moves that can be used to resolve these problems. Fewer references<ref name=\"fraser_rules\" /><ref>Chris Hardwick, [http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/4speedsolve3.html \"Fix parity for 4x4x4 cube\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> demonstrate how these moves satisfy parity rules. From a parity perspective, there is a need to consider the rearrangement of centre cubies which is not readily observable in cubes with unmarked centres. Only OLL parity compliance will be illustrated here.\n\nA typical OLL correction for a size 9 cube is shown. The cubies shown in colour are the only ones in the cube that change positions.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|- valign=top\n|[[File:OLL before correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL before correction for size 9 cube]]\n| style=\"width:20px\" | \n|[[File:OLL after correction.png|thumb|center|250px|OLL after correction for size 9 cube]]\n|}\nFor the OLL correction there are <math>n-2</math> centre cubie swaps and overall there are <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> swaps when the edge pair is included. For odd size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always even (and conforms with the universal even parity requirement for odd size cubes). For even size cubes <math>\\left(n-1\\right)</math> is always odd which means in this case a parity reversal always occurs, an allowable parity condition for even size cubes.\n\nFor the complete edge set flip (a requirement that can arise only for cubes of even size), the number of swaps will be <math>\\left(n-1\\right)\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math>. The overall number of swaps will be even if <math>\\left(\\frac{n}{2}-1\\right)</math> is even (i.e. <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd). The overall number of swaps will be odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even. Hence overall parity will be even if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is odd and odd if <math>\\frac{n}{2}</math> is even.\n\nThe parity of a given algorithm can, of course, also be deduced from its content using the rules detailed in the [[#Rules for Rubik’s family cubes|Rules for Rubik’s family cubes]] section.\n\nFor standard cubes the rearrangement of centre cubies to resolve the OLL and PLL problems is unimportant. For cubes with marked centre cubies the effect of this rearrangement of these cubies is a serious drawback. For cubes with marked centres it is not possible (except for the size 4 cube) to align all final layer centre cubies until all edge cubies have been placed in their final positions.\n\n===Algorithms===\nInstructions for people on how to solve Rubik's type cubes are normally conveyed either in purely graphical form or as sequences defined using a printable character notation. A character sequence that can be translated and applied to perform a sequence of layer rotations to transform a given state to another (usually less scrambled) state is often referred to as an [[Algorithms|algorithm]]. Algorithms are most commonly used when unscrambling the latter portion of the cube but can be applied more extensively if desired. Algorithms can be written down as instructions that can be memorized or looked up in a document. The printable characters used (e.g. to indicate an anticlockwise quarter turn, a single layer quarter turn or a multiple layer quarter turn) in algorithm instructions vary among authors as does their positions in the instructions. Where people interpret instructions the way they are presented is insignificant. The only time the form of presentation has significance is when computer keyboard entry is used to change the state of software cubes, and automatic updating of the screen image occurs whenever a valid instruction is received. For example, if F′ is used to represent an anticlockwise quarter turn of the front face then, as the user types in F, a clockwise quarter turn will occur and a correction will be needed when the user types the ′ character. The end result will still be correct but use of −F rather than F′ would eliminate the superfluous rotation. Any text enhancements, such as superscripts or subscripts, must be avoided in the method of presenting cube rotation sequences when users communicate with software cubes via keyboard commands. When computer keyboard entry of instructions is used, [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] (which map a short input text string to a longer string) can be used<ref name=\"fraser_unravel\" /><ref name=\"fraser_solving_unmarked\" /><ref>Tom Davis, [http://www.geometer.org/rubik/ \"Rubik Test Release\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> as algorithm shortcuts.\n\n===Time to solve cubes===\nSpeedcubing (or speedsolving) is the practice of solving a cube in the Rubik's cube family in the shortest time possible (which usually implies reducing the number of quarter turn moves required). It is most commonly applied to cubes of small size and there are numerous solving methods that have been documented. An international team of researchers using computer power from Google has found every way the standard size 3 Rubik's cube can be solved and have shown it is possible to complete the solution in 20 moves or less<ref>Tomas Rokicki, Herbert Kociemba, Morley Davidson and John Dethridge, [http://www.cube20.org/ \"God's Number is 20\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> for any initial scrambled state (where a move here is defined as a quarter or a half turn of a face). Generally, speed solving methods apply more to specialist cubists than typical cubists and are more complex than simple layer-by-layer type methods used by most other people.\n\n==Reachable and unreachable states for cubes of all sizes==\nIf a cube has at some previous time occupied the set state, then any state that can arise after legal moves is considered to be a reachable state. For small size cubes (size 2, 3 or 4) an unreachable state is one that cannot be reached by legal moves. For larger cubes there needs to be some further qualification on what is meant by an unreachable state. In this article notional movement between 24-cubie orbits for edge and for centre cubies is excluded.\n\n===Relationship between reachable and unreachable states===\nIf, for a cube of any size, ''m'' represents the number of reachable states, ''u'' represents the number of unreachable states and ''t'' equals their sum:\n\n:<math>t=u+m</math>\n:<math>t=km</math> where <math>k</math> is a positive integer\n:<math>u=\\left(k-1\\right)m</math>\n\nBoth ''m'' and ''k'' are functions of cube size <math>n</math>. Values for ''m'' and ''k'' will be considered in the following sections. In other texts \"reachable states\" are often referred to as \"permutations\".\n\n===Reachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of reachable states is based on:\n* Standard ''permutations and combinations mathematics''.<ref name=\"mason\">Oliver Mason, [http://www.hamilton.ie/ollie/EE304/Counting.pdf \"Some Simple Counting Rules, EE304 - Probability and Statistics\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref>\n* Reduction factors that must be applied to above to reflect movement restrictions specific to Rubik’s family cubes.\n\nThe number of different states that are reachable for cubes of any size can be simply related to the numbers that are applicable to the size 3 and size 4 cubes. [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]] in his 1981 paper<ref>Hofstadter, D.R., Metamagical Themas, \"The Magic Cube's cubies twiddled by cubists and solved by cubemeisters\", Scientific American, March 1981.</ref> provided a full derivation of the number of states for the standard size 3 Rubik's cube.

Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> The brief material provided below presents the results in the form used in one of these references<ref name=\"fraser_states\" /> which covers the topic in far more detail.\n\nFor cubes with unmarked centre cubies the following positive integer constants (represented by P, Q, R and S) apply. These constants are in agreement with figures frequently quoted for the size 3 and size 4 cubes.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=\"58%\" align=\"left\" | Corner cubie possibilities for even size cubes\n| width=\"4%\"  | P\n| width=\"13%\"  | (7!) 3<sup>6</sup>\n| width=\"25%\"  | 3.67416000000000 × 10<sup>6</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Central edge cubie possibilities for odd size cubes, multiplied by 24\n| Q\n| 24 (12!) 2<sup>10</sup>\n| 1.17719433216000 × 10<sup>13</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Edge cubie possibilities for each dual set (12 pairs)\n| R\n| 24!\n| 6.20448401733239 × 10<sup>23</sup>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | Centre cubie possibilities for each quadruple set (6 groups of 4)\n| S\n| (24!)/(4!)<sup>6</sup>\n| 3.24667053711000 × 10<sup>15</sup>\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"font-size:88%\" | Note: ! is the [[factorial]] symbol (N! means the product 1 × 2 × ... × N).\n|}\n\nThe value of S may warrant a word of explanation as it is commonly inferred that the number of possible states for centre cubies with identifying markings for a size 4 cube is 24!. Use of that value is guaranteed to yield the wrong answer if cubes with marked centres are under consideration. The first 20 cubies can be arbitrarily placed giving rise to factor 24!/4!. However, for each possible arrangement of edge cubies, only half the 4! hypothetical arrangements for the last four are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /><ref name=\"fraser_states\" /> Hence the correct value for the cube with marked centres is 24!/2. If the markings are removed, then a \"permutation with some objects identical\"<ref name=\"mason\" /> applies. For the standard cube the marked cube value needs to be divided by (4!)<sup>6</sup>/2 (the 2 divisor must also be applied here). That gives an overall S value for the size 4 cube of 24!/(4!)<sup>6</sup>. All states for 24-centre-cubie orbits for standard Rubik’s family cubes are reachable (if required, even parity is always achievable by swapping the positions of a couple of centre cubies of the same colour).\n\n:<math>m = \\textrm{P}\\textrm{Q}^a\\textrm{R}^b\\textrm{S}^c</math>\n::where <math>a</math>, <math>b</math> and <math>c</math> are positive integer [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] (functions of cube size <math>n</math>) as given below.\n::<math>a = n \\textrm{ mod }2</math> (i.e. 0 if <math>n</math> is even or 1 if <math>n</math> is odd)\n::<math>b = \\frac{n-2-a}{2}</math>\n::<math>c = \\frac{\\left(n-2\\right)^2-a}{4}</math>\n\nFor even size cubes <math>\\textrm{Q}^a = 1</math> (see [[exponentiation]]).\n\nFor further simplification, parameter <math>m</math> may also be expressed as <math>m = 10^y</math> where <math>y=\\textrm{log}_{10}m</math>. Parameter <math>y</math> can be related to <math>n</math> by a continuous [[Quadratic function|quadratic\n\nfunction]] subject to the restriction that <math>n</math> must be an integer greater than 1 when referring to possible states for cubes:\n\n:<math>y = \\textrm{A}n^2+\\textrm{B}n+\\textrm{C}</math>\nwhere A, B and C are constants. Constants A and B are the same for <math>n</math> even and for <math>n</math> odd but the value of C is different.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The difference is imperceptible except when plotted over a small range of <math>n</math>, as indicated in the graphs reproduced below. Only Rubik’s family values for <math>n</math> equal to 2 and 3 are included in the second graph.\n{| style=\"margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n| [[File:Logplot 2to16.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n| width=\"20px\" |\n| [[File:logplot vertex.png|thumb|center|300px]]\n|}\n\nUse of the log function ''y'' provides the only practical means of plotting numbers that vary over such a huge range as that for the Rubik's cube family. The difference between the curves translates as a factor of 505.08471690483 (equal to <math>\\frac{\\textrm{R}^{0.5}\\textrm{S}^{0.25}}{\\textrm{Q}}</math>). This is the factor that defines the effect of even size, relative to odd size, on the number of reachable states for cubes with unmarked centres.\n\nHence, with the logarithmic presentation the number of cube states can be expressed using just four<ref>Math reference, [https://www.reference.com/math/non-integer-6b374df18d851eea \"non-integer\"]. Retrieved 2017-02-24.</ref> numbers (A, B and the two C values). Furthermore, the number of cube states form a restricted set of values for a more general continuous quadratic (parabolic) function for which <math>n</math> can have non-integer and negative values. Calculating the value of ''m'' from the corresponding value of ''y'' is a straightforward process.\n\nCentre cubies are different from corner or edge cubies in that, unless they have indicative markings, there are multiple possibilities for their final orientation and/or locations. The number of different ways centre cubies can be arranged to yield a solved cube with unmarked centre cubies may be of interest. To calculate that, the impact of centre cubie marking needs to be assessed. Define <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math>, <math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}</math> and <math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}</math> to be the changed parameters for marked centre cubies (P and R remain unchanged).\n\n:<math>\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T Q}</math> where <math>\\textrm{T} = \\frac{4^6}{2} = 2048 </math>\n:<math>\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{V S}</math> where <math>\\textrm{V} = \\frac{(4!)^6}{2} = 95551488 </math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{P}\\left(\\textrm{Q}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^a\\textrm{R}^b\\left(\\textrm{S}_\\textrm{M}\\right)^c</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = m_\\textrm{D}m</math>\n:<math>m_\\textrm{M} = \\textrm{T}^a\\textrm{V}^c</math>\n\nParameter <math>m_\\textrm{M}</math> defines the number of reachable states for cubes with marked centres. Factor <math>m_\\textrm{D}</math> gives the number of different arrangements of unmarked centre cubies that will provide a solved size <math>n</math> cube. It is also the factor by which the number of different states for a standard cube needs to be multiplied by when marked centres apply.\n\n===Unreachable states for cubes of all sizes===\nThe number of unreachable states far exceeds the number of reachable states. There are many references to the number of unreachable states for the size 3 cube but very few for larger size cubes.\n\nThe unreachable arrangements for corner and edge cubies are the same for cubes with or without marked centres.\n\nIf a corner cubie for cubes of any size is considered, then a 1/3 twist clockwise leaving everything else unchanged will represent an unreachable state, and similarly for a 1/3 twist counter-clockwise. Hence only 1/3 of the twist possibilities are reachable.\n\nFor the central edge cubie for odd size cubes the behaviour is the same as that for the size 3 cube. Only half the conceivable positions are reachable and only half the conceivable orientations are reachable. Hence only 1/4 of the central edge cubie movement possibilities are reachable.\n\n[[File:Edge cube reach unreach 1.png|thumb|center|554px]]\nEdge cubies that comprise 12 complementary pairs (24 cubies total) behave as if the complementary cubies did not look the same. Any given edge cubie can move to any position in the 24-cubie orbit but for any given position there is one reachable and one unreachable orientation for that cubie. The reverse applies for the complementary edge cubie. For a given cubie (1-2) the reachable and unreachable orientations for a given face for a given orbit for a size 8 cube is illustrated below. One of the 24 reachable possibilities for a given edge cubie matches that of the set cube.\n\nThe number of unreachable states for a 24-edge-cubie set is the same as the number of reachable states (24! in each case).\n\nIn the case of the marked centre cubies only half the conceivable arrangements for each set of 24 cubies for any given orbit are reachable.<ref name=\"fraser_marked\" /> The same parity rules that apply for marked centre cubies also apply for the unmarked centre cubies. A quarter turn of a set-of-four centre cubies cannot be achieved without changing the arrangement elsewhere to meet the parity requirement. Because there are 95551488 ways of arranging the individual centre cubies so that the resulting arrangement appears exactly the same, parity rules can be met without any observable indication of how the parity compliance is achieved. Hence, for the normal case (24 cubies comprising four of each of six colours) there is no restriction on the achievable states for the centre cubies.\n\nThe following table uses the values noted above to represent the ''k'' component factors for the size <math>n</math> cube. Exponents ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' are functions of cube size <math>n</math> as defined above.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left; width:40em\" |  Reduction components for factor ''k'' (for standard cube with unmarked centres) and for <math>k_\\textrm{M}</math> (for cube with marked centres)\n| Unmarked centres'<br />cube type\n| Marked centres'<br />cube type\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Corner cubie factor\n| 3\n| 3\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Central edge cubie factor (such cubies exist only for cubes of odd size)\n| <math>2^{2a}</math>\n| <math>2^{2a}</math>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Complementary edge cubie factor for all 12-pair sets combined\n| <math>2^b</math>\n|<math>2^b</math>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" |  Absolute centre cubie factor (such cubies exist only for cubes of odd size)\n| 1\n|<math>2^a</math>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | Centre cubie factor for all 24-cubie sets combined\n| 1\n|<math>2^c</math>\n|}\n\nTaking the product of these factors:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n| width=\"60%\" align=\"left\" | For the standard size <math>n</math> cube\n| width=\"40%\"  | <math>k=\\left(3\\right)2^{2a+b}</math>\n|-\n| align=\"left\" | For the marked centres' size <math>n</math> cube\n|<math>k_\\textrm{M}=\\left(3\\right)2^{3a+b+c}</math>\n|}\n\nSome values for cubes of small size are given below.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

It was part of Hasbro's classical games collection of PC related games, translating their most famous [[board games]] into best possible quality video games. A history of the Rubik's Cube and its inventor, written out in a webpage type file, with pictures is available from the Menu.\n\n==The games==\nAll games have a Challenge and free play mode.\n\n'''Rubik's Classics''' The main puzzle 3x3 was composed of a standard [[Rubik's Cube]], where the player could play and solve the puzzle using the PC's mouse, and even a paint and solve feature where they could paint the sides of the cube and then click on the solve feature, the computer would find the quickest solution to that arrangement of the puzzle. This could help the player solve a standard cube that they had at home without having to peel off the stickers or without taking their Cube apart so they can have a solved cube to play with. The Classics section also has the 2x2, 2x3, 4x4 5x5 versions of the puzzle.\n\n'''Cover Up'''\nOn a [[wikt:grid|grid]] of various sizes a series of colored columns are stacked up and the players job is to lay all the tiles so they completely cover the grid. As the grids become larger the stacks also become larger and more difficult to figure out in which patterns the tiles will fit onto the grid. The grid board can be turned at different angles to better see the grid.\n\n'''Zigthrough'''\nA chain of five squares, like a snake, can be moved left and right while it comes down from the top of the screen. As the chain moves the colors of the chain can be moved forward as desired so the head of the chain can be any of the five colors. As the chain reaches another block set on the playing field it stops, and the only way to clear the colored blocks off the playing field is to connect three squares of the same color. There are also unremovable blocks, that act as a barrier to get around. Once the path is clear the chain can reach the goal.\n\n'''Rubik's Playground'''\nWorking more as an experiment in Physics the player guides a series of balls down ramps and across other hazards to reach the exit. There are four different types of balls: iron, rubber, plastic and exploding. The player can bump the balls into each other, or speed them up using ramps and [[magnets]]. A required number of balls entering the Exit are needed to complete each puzzle. The player can create and save their own Playground puzzles, and save them into files on their computer, and uploaded to the Game's Official webpage.\n\n'''Paint War'''\nIs a Chess type game where the player has pieces that rank from zero to five and only pieces with a smaller number can take the pieces of their opponent, the zero piece can be taken by another zero piece that strikes first or a number 5. Like the pawns in Chess being promoted the zero piece can be promoted to a number 5 if the players #5 piece has been taken out of the game. There are two ways to complete each match against the computer, or over the internet using the games webpage link.<br>\n1. Paint more of the 42 squares before the computer does.<br>\n2. Take all the computers players this is known as a [[KO]].<br>\nThe number of the piece determines the number of squares that piece can paint. The player's opponent can paint a square and the player can paint over it, yet the match ends when all the squares have been painted or all the opponents pieces have been taken.\n\n==Challenge and weblink==\n'''Rubik's Challenges''' consist of 100 challenges spread out between all five of the games. Once players have managed to complete all the Challenges they are given the option to upload their names onto the ''''Eternal Rubik's Master'''' list on  the game's official site. Completing all these challenges is only the beginning and only a small portion of the game is required to be beaten to get this ranking. The game allowed players to save their high scores and best times and even upload them to the game's website. Playability was also increased by players being able to create their own puzzles in the '''Rubik's Playground''' and upload them to the website or email them to other players.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rubik's Puzzle World]]\n* [[Atari Video Cube]]\n\n==References==\n* [http://faqs.ign.com/articles/652/652484p1.html Walk through and Solutions of all 'Rubik's Games' puzzles, by \"Teary Eyes\" Anderson at IGN.com]\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.rubiks.com Official Rubik's webpage]\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:Puzzle video games]]\n[[Category:1999 video games]]"

      "text": "[[Image:Rubiksmagic.jpg|right|thumb|Rubik's Magic]]\n[[Image:Rubiksmagic solved.jpg|right|thumb|Rubik's Magic (solved)]]\n'''Rubik's Magic''', like [[Rubik's Cube]], is a mechanical [[puzzle]] invented by [[Ernő Rubik]] and first manufactured by [[Matchbox (toy company)|Matchbox]] in the mid-1980s.\n\nThe puzzle consists of eight black square tiles (changed to red squares with goldish rings in 1997) arranged in a 2 × 4 rectangle; diagonal grooves on the tiles hold wires that connect them, allowing them to be folded onto each other and unfolded again in two perpendicular directions (assuming that no other connections restrict the movement) in a manner similar to a [[Jacob's ladder (toy)|Jacob's Ladder]] toy. The front side of the puzzle shows, in the initial state, three separate, rainbow-coloured rings; the back side consists of a scrambled picture of three interconnected rings. The goal of the game is to fold the puzzle into a heart-like shape and unscramble the picture on the back side, thus interconnecting the rings.\n\nNumerous ways to accomplish this exist, and experienced players can transform the puzzle from its initial into the solved state in less than 2 seconds.<ref>[http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/events.php?eventId=magic&regionId=&years=&show=100%2BPersons&single=Single Official World Rankings]</ref> Other challenges for Rubik's Magic include reproducing given shapes (which are often three-dimensional), sometimes with certain tiles required to be in certain positions and/or orientations.\n\n==History==\nRubik's Magic was first manufactured by [[Matchbox (toy company)|Matchbox]] in 1986. Professor Rubik holds both a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] patent (HU 1211/85, issued 19 March 1985) and a US patent (US 4,685,680, issued 11 August 1987) on the mechanism of Rubik's Magic. \n\nIn 1987, ''Rubik's Magic: Master Edition'' was published by Matchbox; it consisted of 12 silver tiles arranged in a 2 × 6 rectangle, showing 5 interlinked rings that had to be unlinked by transforming the puzzle into a shape reminiscent of a W. Around the same time, Matchbox also produced ''Rubik's Magic Create the Cube'',<ref name=\"Create the Cube release\">[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=496 Rubik's Create The Cube] at TwistyPuzzles.com, retrieved May 2, 2007</ref> a \"Level Two\" version of ''Rubik's Magic'', in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube.<ref name=\"Create the Cube solution\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/magiccrea.htm Rubik's Magic: Create the Cube] at Jaap's Puzzle Page, retrieved May 2, 2007</ref> It did not have as wide a release, and is rare to find.\n\nIn 1996, the original version of Rubik's Magic was re-released by Oddzon, this time with yellow rings on a red background; other versions (for example, a variant of the original with silver tiles instead of black ones) were also produced, and there also was a strategy game based on Rubik's Magic. An unlicensed 2 × 8 version was also produced, with spheres printed on its tiles instead of rings. Custom versions as large as 2 × 12 have been built using kits available from Oddzon.\n\n== Details ==\n[[Image:Rubiksmagic chain.png|right|framed|A Rubik's Magic chain]]\n\nIt can be seen that the total number of 2 × 4 rectangles that can possibly be created using Rubik's Magic is only thirty-two; these can be created from eight distinct chains. The easiest way to classify chains is by the means of the middle tile of the puzzle's finished form (the only tile that has segments of all three rings) and the tile next to it featuring a yellow/orange ring segment (the indicator tile).\n\nEvery chain either has the middle tile on the outside (O) or the inside (I) of the chain; if it is arranged so that the indicator tile is to the right of the middle tile, then the position of the ring segment on the indicator tile can either be the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL) or lower right (LR) corner. The position and orientation of the remaining tiles is then determined by the middle and indicator tiles, and eight distinct chains (OUL to ILR) is obtained, although the naming convention is not standardized.\n\nSimilarly, the 2 × 4 rectangle forms of them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2 or 3 to the chain's name, depending on whether the number of tiles to the right of the middle tile before the folding edge, a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.\nThe cube now is rainbow and has silver rings. A game rule for this is one is you can match the silver rings and color squares, which can make it more complicated.\nA similar classification can also be obtained for the heart-shaped forms of the puzzle, of which 64 exist.\n\n==Analysis==\n\nOne question when analyzing Rubik's Magic concerns its [[state space]]: What is the set of configurations that can be reached from the initial state? This question is harder to answer than for [[Rubik's Cube]], because the set of operations on Rubik's Magic does not form a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]].\n\nThe basic operation (move) consists of transferring a hinge between two tiles T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>, from one pair of edges (E<sub>11</sub> of T<sub>1</sub> and E<sub>21</sub> on T<sub>2</sub>) to another pair E<sub>12</sub> and E<sub>22</sub>.\nHere, edges E<sub>11</sub> and E<sub>12</sub> are adjacent on tile T<sub>1</sub>,\nand so are edges E<sub>21</sub> and E<sub>22</sub> on tile T<sub>2</sub> but in opposite order. See the figure below for an example, where E<sub>11</sub> is the East edge of the yellow tile, E<sub>21</sub> is the West edge of the red tile, and both E<sub>21</sub> and E<sub>22</sub> are the North edges.\n[[File:Rubik's Magic Move.png|thumb|center|400 px|A basic move, transferring a hinge between two tiles to another pair of edges]]\n\nIn order to carry out such a move, the hinge being moved cannot cross another hinge. Thus, the two hinges on a tile can take up one of five relative positions (see figure below). The positions are encoded as a number in the range from -2 to +2, called the ''wrap''. The difference between wrap -2 and wrap +2 is the order of the neighboring tiles (which one is on top). The total wrap of a configuration is calculated as the ''alternating sum'' of the wraps of the individual tiles in the chain.\n\nThe total wrap is invariant under a move. Thus, one can calculate the number of theoretically possible shapes of the chain (disregarding the patterns on the individual tiles) as 1351.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Verhoeff | first = Tom | title = Magic and Is Nho Magic | journal = Cubism For Fun | year = 1987 | issue = 15 | pages=24–31 | accessdate = 2014-08-27 | url = http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/publications/Magic_and_Is_Nho_Magic-CFF-nr-15-pp-24-31.pdf}}</ref>\n[[File:Rubik's Magic Wrap.png|thumb|center|500 px|All possible relative positions of the two hinges on a single tile; the number below the tile is the amount of wrap]]\nFurthermore, the other tiles in the chain will have to move through space appropriately to allow the folding and unfolding needed to carry out a move. This limits the practically reachable number of configurations further. That number also depends on how much stretching of the wires you tolerate.\n\n== Records ==\n\nThe world record for a single solve of the Magic is 0.69 seconds, set by Yuxuan Wang. Yuxuan Wang also holds the record for an average of five solves - 0.76 seconds set at the Beijing Summer Open 2011 competition.<ref>[http://worldcubeassociation.org/results/regions.php?regionId=&eventId=magic&years=&mixed=Mixed World Cube Association Official Results - Rubik's Magic]</ref> Due to the [[World Cube Association]] no longer recognizing Rubik's Magic as an official event as of 2012, Yuxuan Wang holds the permanent world record for this puzzle.\n\n==Rubik's Magic: Master Edition==\n[[Image:Rubiksmagicmasteredition.jpg|right|thumb|Rubik's Magic: Master Edition]]\n[[Image:Rubiksmagicmasteredition solved.jpg|right|thumb|Rubik's Magic: Master Edition in solved state]]\nRubik's Magic: Master Edition (most commonly known as '''Master Magic''') was manufactured by [[Matchbox (toy company)|Matchbox]] in 1987. It is a modification from the Rubik's Magic, with 12 tiles instead of the original's 8 tiles. The puzzle has 12 panels interconnected with nylon wires. In a 2 &times; 6 rectangular shape, measuring approximately 4.25&nbsp;inches (10.5&nbsp;cm) by 13&nbsp;inches (32&nbsp;cm).\n\nThe goal of the game is the same as for Rubik's Magic, which is to fold the puzzle from a 2 &times; 6 rectangular shape into a W-like shape with a certain tiles arrangement. Initially, the front side shows a set of 5 linked rings. Once solved, the puzzle takes the shape of the letter W, and shows 5 unlinked rings on the back side of the previous initial state.<ref name=jaap>{{cite web |title=Jaap's Puzzle Page: Master Magic |accessdate=2010-06-01 |url=http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/magicmast.htm }}</ref>\n\nAs a puzzle, the Master Edition is actually simpler than the original Rubik's Magic. It offers more degrees of freedom (more hinges), allowing you to work on one part, mostly ignoring the other parts. The minimal solution involves 16 quarter turns moves.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Verhoeff |first=Tom |title=Minimal Solutions for the 12-Magic |journal=Cubism For Fun |year =1987 |issue=16 |pages=12–13 |accessdate=2014-08-27 |url=http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/publications/Minimal_Solutions_for_the_12-Magic-CFF-nr-16-pp-12-13.pdf}}</ref> There are multiple solutions.<ref name=jaap/>\n\nThe puzzle was an official [[World Cube Association|WCA]] event from 2003-2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=WCA Competitions |publisher=WCA |year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-01 |url=http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/competitions.php }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]]\n* [[Professor's Cube]]\n* [[V-Cube 6]]\n* [[V-Cube 7]]\n* [[V-Cube 8]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n*[[Jacob's ladder (toy)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://web.inter.nl.net/users/C.Eggermont/Puzzels/Magic/ Pictures of Rubik's Magic in various configurations]\n* [http://www.mathematische-basteleien.de/magics.htm Detailed description and analysis]\n* [http://www.win.tue.nl/~wstomv/publications/List-of-Rubik-Magic-Wrap-Shapes.txt List of all 1351 theoretically possible shapes] (Legend: = stands for wrap -2; - stands for wrap -1; 0 stands for wrap 0; + stands for wrap +1; # stands for wrap +2)\n* [http://www.powerstrike.net/puzzles/index_theory.htm Categorising folding plate puzzles (plus tips)]\n* [http://www.kastellorizo.org/puzzles/folding/ New themes and different (solving-wise) mechanical types of folding plate puzzles]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Hungarian inventions]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:1985 works]]\n[[Category:1985 introductions]]\n[[Category:1980s toys]]"

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n\n[[Image:RubiksRevolution1.jpg|thumb|350px|Rubik's Revolution]]\n\nThe '''Rubik's Revolution''' is a [[handheld electronic game]] invented, designed, developed and patented by Rehco, LLC, a Chicago toy and game inventing firm. The Rubik's Revolution was formerly distributed by [[Techno Source]] and received the 2008 TOTY Game of the Year Award. Designed to resemble the classic [[Rubik's Cube]] puzzle, the device is a single rigid cube; it is about as large as a [[Professor's Cube]], with each face subdivided into 9 square sub-faces. The center square of each face features a recessed [[LED]]-lit [[Push button|button]] colored to correspond with the stickers on the remaining squares. Gameplay involves pressing the buttons when they light up, or when directed to by the game's recorded voice.\n\nThis gameplay is completely different from that of the [[Rubik's Cube]], despite the physical resemblance to the Rubik's Cube's solved state. There are no separate, movable sub-cubes as in the Rubik's Cube; the 6 faces are of uniform, unchanging color, and the 9 facets on each face are fixed in place.\n\n==Features==\nThe Rubik's Revolution 15 includes 6 electronic games, using the 6 lighted buttons in the recessed squares at the center of each face of the cube and the internal speaker. These games are called \"Light Speed\", \"Rapid Recharge\", \"Pattern Panic\", \"Cube Catcher\", \"Code Cracker\", and \"Multiplayer Madness\". A secret seventh mode is accessible by studying the instruction manual, referred to only as the \"ultimate challenge\" by the manual. There is also a Titanium Edition, a Micro Edition and an Ice Edition. The Titanium comes equipped with a memory system that keeps track of your score. The Micro Edition is a \"keychain\" style cube that only allows you to play a shorter version of Light Speed. Like the Titanium Edition, the Ice Edition keeps track of your score but also tracks your progress.\n\nAn [[Speech synthesis|electronic voice]] is used to guide the players both during game play and for configuration, such as\nchanging the volume (hint: press the Yellow & Silver squares when turning on the game).<ref>{{cite web|title=First review: The Rubik’s Revolution|url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2007/2/26/7221}}</ref> The games also employ various other sound effects, such as a soft \"click\" sound when a button is pressed.\n\n===Light Speed===\nOne button will light up, and the player has a certain amount of time to press the correct button. As the player makes progress, the player has less time to press the correct button. The game ends if the player presses the wrong button, runs out of time, or beats the game with the maximum score of 999 (20 minutes). The Titanium version of Light Speed allows you to score over 2,384 points (over an hour's worth of game play). The Ice Edition allows you to score over 9,999 points (that's 7,615 more points than the Titanium Edition). The Micro Edition has a maximum score of 99 and, unlike the other editions, has a ranking system for how well a person plays.\n\n===Rapid Recharge===\nButtons will randomly light up for a short period of time. When a button has been lit for a certain amount of time, it will start flashing and a warning alarm will sound. The player must rapidly press that button to \"recharge\" it. The player wins if they can simultaneously charge every button. The game ends if the player fails to recharge any of the buttons in time, or beats the game.\n\n===Pattern Panic===\nA sequence of buttons light up and their colors are spoken, starting with one button on the first round, two on the next, etc. The player has five seconds to correctly press the same sequence of buttons. The game ends if the player presses the wrong button or runs out of time, or beats the game.\n\n===Cube Catcher===\nVarious buttons light up randomly. The player has thirty seconds to press as many correct buttons as possible. Time warnings are given at 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, and a five second countdown from 5 to 1. After time runs out, the player's accuracy is assigned a percentage rating.\n\n===Code Cracker===\nThe player must try to guess the order in which the buttons should be pressed. If a wrong button is pressed, an alarm sounds and the player must begin again. Once the \"code\" is \"cracked\", the player is told how long it took and how many tries it took.\n\n===Multiplayer Madness===\n\"Multiplayer Madness\" is the same as \"Light Speed\", but for many players. The cube is passed between players. When a player cannot press the button in time or presses the wrong button, that player is eliminated. At the end, one player wins.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.technosourcehk.com/rubiksfaq.php Frequently Asked Questions]\n* [http://toys.about.com/od/toptentoysof2004/gr/rubiksrevolutio.htm Review of the puzzle]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:2007 introductions]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:Handheld electronic games]]"

The bank of panels is mounted on a central spring-loaded pivot that can both slide a short distance in each of the four cardinal directions, as well as rotate or yaw slightly around the pivot. Each Slide and Twist maneuver triggers a change in the game's state.\n\nThe CPU selects a random pattern of lights as the goal state, then it selects another random pattern of lights as the starting state. The latter pattern visibly illuminates the panels. The goal pattern can be viewed at will by holding a button on the side of the device. Reaching the goal states scores a point, and the CPU generates a new puzzle.\n\nA Slide maneuver will shift all rows or columns one space in the direction of the push. Rows or columns that are shifted off the visible play area \"wrap around\" to the opposite side. A Twist maneuver's effect varies based on the difficulty setting.\n\nThe game has three difficulty settings:\n\n===Easy Difficulty===\n\n* Lights can be in one of two states: on or off.\n*Lights that are on are all blue or all red i.e. only one colour is used in each puzzle.\n* Twists shift the lights 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, akin to the outcome of twisting one face of a traditional [[Rubik's Cube]].\n\n===Medium Difficulty===\n\n* Lights can be in one of two states: on or off.\n*Lights that are on are all blue or all red i.e. only one colour is used in each puzzle.\n* Twists shift the lights 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise. The top left light moves to the top center position, the top center light moves to the top right position, the top right light moves to the right side position, and so on.\n\n===Hard Difficulty===\n\n* Lights can be in one of three states: off, red, or blue.\n* Twists shift the lights 45 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, as in medium difficulty.\n\n==Criticism and reviews==\n[[Gizmodo]] praised the device for having a pleasing tactile quality and encouraging repeated play.<ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the Rubik’s Slide: New Shape, New Frustrations|url=https://gizmodo.com/5472723/meet-the-rubiks-slide-new-shape-new-frustrations|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=29 November 2012}}</ref> Tech Crunch suggested it was fun and addictive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Biggs|first=John|title=Hands-on with the Rubik's Slide|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/17/hands-on-with-the-rubiks-slide/|work=Tech Crunch|accessdate=29 November 2012|date=February 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]"

By being twisted, the Rubik's Snake can be made to resemble a wide variety of objects, animals, or geometric shapes. Its \"ball\" shape in its packaging is a non-uniform concave [[rhombicuboctahedron]].\n\nThe snake was invented by [[Ernő Rubik]], better known as the inventor of the [[Rubik's Cube]].\n\nRubik's Snake was released during 1981 at the height of the Rubik's Cube craze.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/08/24/Now-meet-Rubiks-snake-Bigger-than-Rubiks-cube/9742367473600/ |last=Jensen |first=Gregory |title=Now meet Rubik's snake – 'Bigger than Rubik's cube!' |date=24 August 1981 |publisher=United Press International}}</ref> According to [[Ernő Rubik]]: \"The snake is not a problem to be solved; it offers infinite possibilities of combination. It is a tool to test out ideas of shape in space. Speaking theoretically, the number of the snake's combinations is limited. But speaking practically, that number is limitless, and a lifetime is not sufficient to realize all of its possibilities.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1981/10/04/rubiks-snake-of-infinite-possibilities/f24890bf-0e18-488d-b2a8-56dd154016cc/ |last=Fenyvesi |first=Charles |title=Rubik's snake of 'Infinite Possibilities' |date=4 October 1981 |newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nThe 24 prisms are aligned in row with an alternating orientation (normal and upside down). Each prism can adopt 4 different positions, each with an offset of 90°. Usually the prisms have alternating colors.\n\n== Notation ==\n\n=== Twisting instructions ===\nThe steps needed to make an arbitrary shape or figure can be described in a number of ways.\n\nOne common starting configuration is a straight bar with alternating upper and lower prisms, with the rectangular faces facing up and down, and the triangular faces facing towards the player. The 12 lower prisms are numbered 1 through 12 starting from the left, with the left and the right sloping faces of these prisms are labeled L and R respectively. The last of the upper prisms is on the right, so the L face of prism 1 does not have an adjacent prism.\n\nThe four possible positions of the adjacent prism on each L and R sloping face are numbered 0, 1, 2 and 3 (representing the number of twists between the bottom prism and the L or R adjacent prism). Numbering is based on always twisting the adjacent prism so it swings towards the player: position 1 turns the adjacent blocks towards them, position 2 makes a 90° turn, and position 3 turns the adjacent block away from the player. Position 0 is the starting position, therefore it is not explicitly noted in step-by-step instructions.\n\nUsing these rules, a twist can be simply described as:\n# Number of the downward-facing prism (from the left): 1 to 12\n# Left or right sloping side of the prism: L or R\n# Position of the twist: 1, 2 or 3\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Here the positions 0, 1, 2 and 3 are always based on the degrees of twist between the right-hand prisms relative to the left-hand prism, when viewed from the right of the axis of rotation.\nHowever, this notation is impractical for human readers, because it is difficult to determine the order of the twists.\n\n* for example '''Cat'''\n:00000000000001321000003202\n  \n* for example '''Three Peaks'''\n: 1232103203210230102030201\n\n=== Fiore method ===\nRather than numbers Albert Fiore uses letters to refer to the direction the second (rightward) section is turned in relation to the first (leftward) section: D, L, U, and R.{{sfnp|Fiore|1981|p=9}} These are listed consecutively rather than numbered, so that a completely straight figure rather than being presumed as a starting point is notated DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.{{sfnp|Fiore|1981|p=11}}\n\n== Mathematical formulation ==\nThe number of different shapes of the Rubik's Snake is at most 4<sup>23</sup> = {{val|70,368,744,177,664}} (⁠ ⁠≈⁠ ⁠7×10<sup>13</sup> or 70{{nbsp}}trillion), i.e. 23 turning areas with 4 positions each. The real number of different shapes is lower, since some configurations are spatially impossible (because they would require multiple prisms to occupy the same region of space).

The book's solution to the cube was considered to be one of the easiest, simplest, and most straightforward solutions to solving the cube. However, this ease and simpliciy involves a tradeoff in that this solution takes longer than other solutions that are harder and more complex.<ref>[http://helm.lu/cube/MarshallPhilipp/page_1.htm A Comparison of Various Methods]</ref>\n\nIn his book, Nourse used a notation that is different from [[Rubik's Cube#Move notation|that of David Singmaster]], which had not yet become widely known. Instead of being named Up and Down and represented in moves by U and D,  the horizontal faces are named Top and Bottom and represented by T and B.  To avoid the single-letter ambiguity, the rear face is called Posterior and represented by P. However, as is typically the case in most popular solutions to the puzzle, especially the ones aimed at the beginner, none of the algorithms presented in the book actually uses the posterior face in its move sequence(s). Additionally, clockwise and counterclockwise moves are indicated by + and -, respectively, instead of bare letters and primes.  Thus, for example, Nourse gives the algorithm for rotating three corners of the bottom face anticlockwise (solving the position [[Lars Petrus]] named the \"Sune\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Sune|url=https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Sune|publisher=speedsolving.com}}</ref>) as follows:\n\n    R- B- R+ B- R- B2 R+ B2\n\nIn Singmaster's notation, that same move sequence would be written thus:\n\n    R' D' R D' R' D2 R D2\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Simple Solution to Rubik's Cube}}\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]\n[[Category:1981 books]]\n[[Category:Books about games]]\n[[Category:Bantam Books books]]\n\n\n{{game-book-stub}}"

For most puzzles, solving entails performing a series of moves that alters a scrambled puzzle into a state in which every face of the puzzle is a single, solid color. Some puzzles have different requirements to be considered solved, such as the [[Rubik's Clock|Clock]], for which all the dials must be moved into the 12 'o clock position<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#10h1|title=WCA Regulations|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>.\nThe standard puzzle sizes are [[Pocket Cube|2x2x2]], [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]], [[Rubik's Revenge|4x4x4]], [[Professor's Cube|5x5x5]], [[V-Cube 6|6x6x6]], and [[V-Cube 7|7x7x7]]. There are also different shapes of the famous puzzles, including [[Pyraminx]], [[Megaminx]], [[Skewb]], and [[Square-1 (puzzle)|Square-1]]. An individual who competes in speedcubing is known as a '''speedcuber'''.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rubik's Cube]] was invented in 1974 by [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] professor of [[architecture]], [[Ernő Rubik]]. A widespread international interest in the cube began in 1980, which soon developed into a global craze. On June 5, 1982, the first world championship was held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. 19 people competed in the event and the American [[Minh Thai]] won with a single solve time of 22.95 seconds. Other notable attendees include [[Jessica Fridrich]] and [[Lars Petrus]], two people who would later be influential in the development of solving methods and the speedcubing community. The height of the Rubik's Cube craze began to fade away after 1983, but with the advent of the [[Internet]], [[Website|sites]] relating to speedcubing began to surface. Simultaneously spreading effective speedsolving methods and teaching people new to the cube to solve it for the first time, these sites brought in a new generation of cubers, created a growing international online community, and raised the profile of the art. People prominent in this online community, such as [[Ron van Bruchem]], [[Tyson Mao]], [[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]], and Ton Dennenbroek, eventually wanted to meet in person and compete, so twenty years after the first world championship they orchestrated a second one in [[Toronto]] in 2003, and another smaller competition in the [[Netherlands]] later that same year. This revival of competition sparked a new wave of organized speedcubing events, which include regular national and international competitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions|title=Competitions|publisher=World Cube Association|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref> There were twelve competitions in 2004, 58 more from 2005 to 2006, over 100 in 2008, and over 880 in 2017, with more happening every year. There have been eight more World Championships since [[Budapest]]'s 1982 competition, which are traditionally held every other year, with the most recent in [[Paris]], [[France]], in 2017. This new wave of speedcubing competitions have been and still are organised by the [[World Cube Association]] (WCA), founded by [[Ron van Bruchem]] and [[Tyson Mao]].\n\n==Solving methods==\nThe standard [[Rubik's Cube|3x3x3]] can be solved using a number of methods, not all of which are intended for speedcubing. Although some methods employ a layer-by-layer system and algorithms, other significant (though less widely used) methods include corners-first methods and the [[Gilles Roux|Roux]] method. [[CFOP Method]], Roux, ZZ, and [[Lars Petrus|Petrus]] are often referred to as the \"big four\" methods, as they are the most popular and can be used to achieve faster times than the others. The [[CFOP Method]] is used by most speedcubers.\n\n===CFOP method===\n{{main article|CFOP Method}}\nThe CFOP (Cross - F2L - OLL - PLL) method, also known as the [[Fridrich Method]], was named after one of its inventors, [[Jessica Fridrich]], who finished second in the 2003 Rubik's Cube World Championships. While it is known as the Fridrich method, its origins are actually credited to David Singmaster, who was one of the first to publish a layer by layer method of solving in 1980,<ref>{{Cite web|title = David Singmaster Solution|url = http://van-ness.com/Kurt/Hobbies/RubiksCube/3x3x3/DavidSingmasterSolution.htm|website = Van Ness Web|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> and Guus Razoux Schultz, who built upon this and developed a more efficient system for the first two layers (F2L).<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guus Razoux Schultz|url = https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Guus_Razoux_Schultz|website = Speedsolving.com Wiki|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> Jessica Fridrich then finished developing the method and published it online in 1997,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Speed Cubing|url = http://www.rubiks.com/speed-cubing|website = Rubik's Official Website|accessdate = 2 August 2016}}</ref> an event that was very influential in the revival of competitive speedcubing. The first step of the method is to solve a cross-shaped arrangement of edge pieces on the first layer. The remainder of the first layer and all of the second layer are then solved together in what are referred to as \"corner-edge pairs\", or slots. Finally, the last layer is solved in two steps — first, all of the pieces in the layer are oriented to form a solid color (but without the individual pieces always being in their correct places on the cube). This step is referred to as orientation and is usually performed with a single set of algorithms known as OLL (Orientation of Last Layer). Then, all of those pieces are permuted to their correct spots. This is also usually performed as a single set of algorithms known as PLL (Permutation of Last Layer).\n\nThe [[CFOP Method]] can be used as a less-advanced method by dividing the steps into more steps, reducing the number of algorithms you need to learn but sacrifices time. Most people start learning CFOP with 4LLL (Four-Look Last Layer), which is the less advanced, slower, and algorithm-reducing way to learn CFOP. The 4 steps are divided into Edge Orientation, Corner Orientation, Corner Permutation, and Edge Permutation. Later on, you can learn Full PLL which replaces the permutation of the edges and corners, making the solve more efficient and therefore faster. Even later, you can learn Full OLL which will replace the Orientation of the corners and edges, again making the solve faster.\n\nThe CFOP method is a widely used speedcubing method. Its popularity stems from the speed at which it can be easily performed. Many advanced speedcubers such as two-time Former World Champion [[Feliks Zemdegs]] have also learned additional sets of algorithms for the last slot and layer, such as Corners of Last Layer (COLL), which orients and permutes the corners when the edges are oriented.\n\n===Roux method===\nThe Roux method was invented by [[French people|French]] speedcuber [[Gilles Roux]]. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3×2×1 block usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3×2×1 on the opposite side, such that each block is sharing a bottom color. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regard to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step, L6E or LSE (Last Six Edges).\n\nThis method is not as dependent on algorithm memorization as the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]], since all but the third step is done with intuition as opposed to predefined sets of algorithms. The Roux method can be performed without rotations (unlike the CFOP method) which means it is easier to look ahead (solving a collection of pieces while at the same time looking for the solution to the next step) while solving. It is also considered one of the most efficient speedsolving methods with its average move count being in between 45 and 50 moves for experienced solvers.\n\nOne of the users of this method, [[Kian Mansour]], broke the one-handed (OH) world-record average with the time of 9.54 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCfLsh5vDt0&t=56s |title= The video of Kian Monsour breaking the 3x3 OH world Record |publisher= Kian Monsour |accessdate= 27 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===ZZ method===\nThe ZZ method (short for \"Zbigniew Zborowski\") is a modern speedcubing method originally proposed by Zbigniew Zborowski in 2006. The method was designed specifically to achieve high turning speed by focusing on move ergonomics, and is the combination of a block-building method and a layer-by-layer method. The initial pre-planned step is called EOLine, and is the most distinctive hallmark of the ZZ method. It involves orienting all edges while placing two oppositely placed down-face edges aligned with the correspondingly colored center. The next step solves the remaining first two layers using only left, right, top and bottom face turns, one of the advantages of ZZ. On completion of the first two layers, the last layer's edges are all correctly oriented because of edge pre-orientation during EOLine. The last layer may be completed using a number of techniques including those used in the [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. An expert variant of this method (ZZ-a) allows the last layer to be completed in a single step with an average of just over 12 moves and knowledge of at least 494 algorithms.<ref name=\"Bernard Helmstetter's Move Count Statistics\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.univ-paris8.fr/~bh/cube/|title=Rubik's Cube: Algorithms for the last layer|publisher=Université Paris 8|accessdate=2 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Petrus method===\nThe Petrus method, named after its inventor [[Lars Petrus]], is considered to be more intuitive than the structured [[Fridrich method|CFOP method]]. The first step of the Petrus method is to solve a 2×2×2 block of the cube. This block is then extended to a solved 2×2×3 block. All edges that are unoriented are then oriented, and then the first and second layers are completed using only turns of the right layer and the upper layer. Next, the top corners are put in the right place and the layer is oriented correctly (all stickers facing up) and finally the last edges are permuted (moved around). [[Lars Petrus]] developed this method to address what he felt were inherent inefficiencies in layer-by-layer approaches.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://lar5.com/cube/|title=Solving Rubik's Cube for speed|last=Petrus|first=Lars|accessdate=13 Jan 2017}}</ref> This method is often used as the basis of a method for fewest moves competitions.\n\n===Corners-first methods===\nCorners-first methods involve solving the corners then finishing the edges with slice turns. Corners-first solutions were common in the 1980s, and was one of the most popular methods that 1982 world champion [[Minh Thai]] used. Currently corners-first solutions are less common among speedsolvers. [[Dutch people|Dutch]] cuber Marc Waterman created a corners-first method in the cube craze, and averaged 18 seconds in the mid-late 1980s.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Estonian Open 2009 - Anssi Vanhala.JPG|thumb|Anssi Vanhala solving a 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube with his feet in 36.72 seconds, at the 2009 Estonian Open.]]\n\n===[[World Cube Association]]===\nSince 2003, speedcubing competitions have been held regularly. The World Cube Association (WCA) was formed in 2004 to govern all official competitions. For a competition to be official, it must be approved by the WCA and follow the WCA regulations. Included in the regulations is the necessity of having one or more [[World Cube Association#WCA Delegates|WCA delegate]] in attendance. A delegate's main role is to ensure all regulations are followed during the competition. Once the competition has finished, the results are uploaded on to the WCA [[website]].\n\n===Format===\nThe majority of puzzle competitions are held using a [[Truncated mean|trimmed mean]] of 5 format. This involves the competitor executing 5 solves in the round in question, after which the fastest and slowest solve are disregarded and the [[mean]] of the remaining 3 is used. The 6×6×6 and 7×7×7 events are ranked by straight mean of 3 — only three solves, none of which are disregarded. In 3×3×3 blindfolded and 3×3×3 fewest moves challenges, either straight mean of 3 or best of 3 is used, while 4×4×4 blindfolded, 5×5×5 blindfolded, and multiple blindfolded challenges are ranked using best of 1, 2 or 3, depending on the competition. Occasionally an event is held using an uncommon format, such as best of 3 for 3×3×3.\n\nWhen a round begins, competitors hand in the puzzle they will use. Puzzles are scrambled using a computer-generated scramble. Each round, five, three or one (depending on the format, mentioned above) scrambles are used. Every competitor in the round will receive each scramble once. Before starting a solve, a competitor has up to 15 seconds to inspect the puzzle (inspection is removed for blindfolded events). This is monitored by a judge with a stopwatch. Once the solve is complete, the judge records the time on the competitor's scorecard and it is signed by both. If the puzzle is unsolved and the timer is stopped, the time is recorded as \"DNF\" (Did Not Finish). There are also numerous reasons why the solve can receive a two-second addition to the solve time, such as a face being more than 45 degrees off, or the competitor going over the allowed inspection time. A competitor can also receive an extra solve to replace the one just completed, for example having a timer malfunction or being deliberately distracted by another person.\n\nThe official timer used in competitions is the [[StackMat timer]]. This device has touch-sensitive pads that are triggered by the user lifting one or both of their hands to start the time and placing both their hands back on the pads after releasing the puzzle to stop the timer.\n\nOfficial competitions are currently being held in several categories.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

No longer is there just the original [[Rubik's Cube]], there are dozens upon dozens of worldwide companies making their own cubes, with improved technology to allow faster solving. Notable companies include [http://moyucube.com/en/ Moyu], [https://www.gancube.com/en/ Gancube] and [http://en.qiyitoys.net QiYi]. \n\nThere are also a notable number of companies specialising in selling speedcubes, as well as making their own adjustments and high performance [https://speedcubeshop.com/collections/supernova-series modifications]. From the US, stores include The [https://www.thecubicle.com Cubicle] and [https://speedcubeshop.com Speedcubeshop]. From the UK there is [https://www.kewbz.co.uk Kewbz], [https://www.thepuzzlestore.uk The Puzzle Store] and [https://www.britcubes.co.uk BritCubes]. Worldwide there are companies such as [https://www.lightake.com Lightake].\n\nAll of this has helped to launch speedcubing onto the global scene, not only as a sport and hobby, but a worldwide business.\n\n==Terminology==\nBelow are some definitions of words generally used by the speedcubing community. For a more complete list of speedcubing terminology, see the [http://www.cubefreak.net/other/glossary.php cubefreak.net glossary].\n\n;1LLL : A set of 3915 algorithms to solve every possible state that the last layer could be in after completing F2L.  The average move count is 12.58.\n;[[Algorithm]] : A predefined sequence of moves used to effect a specific change on the cube. Often referred to as ''alg'' or (less commonly) an ''algo''.\n;BJ : Short for Bad Job, usually used to harass or tease a cuber on a bad solve.\n;BLD : Blindfolded solving, i.e. memorize, don blindfold, then solve.\n;Center piece : One of the centers of the faces of the cube. The centers never move relative to each other on an NxNxN cube, where N is odd. On NxNxN cubes where N>3, every piece with only one sticker is referred to as a 'center piece', including those pieces that can move relative to each other.\n;CLL : Corners of the Last Layer. This is the first of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube. In the process, edges may be unoriented. This is used in Corners First methods for the last layer, in which the first all corners are solved, followed by the edges (see ELL). CLL is also commonly used to solve the last layer of a 2x2x2 cube in one step.\n;[[Commutator]] : A commutator is a sequence of the form X Y X' Y' (also represented as [X:Y] or [X,Y]) which affects only specific portions of the cube, leaving the rest untouched. This is used in Blindfolded solving and Fewest Moves Competition.\n;Corner piece : One of the 8 pieces with exactly three stickers, called a \"corner\" piece because a corner is exposed.\n;CR : Short for Continental Record (e.g. Record for a continent). Can also be \"Continental Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;Cuber : Someone who solves a Rubik's cube, any of its other sizes, and/or other shaped puzzles.\n;Cubie : One of the mechanically independent pieces that make up a puzzle. The cubies do not include fixed center pieces, the central axis to which they are attached, or any other internal pieces (Such as the internal edges of a 4x4 or 2x2).\n;Cycle : To rotate pieces' positions on the cube. e.g. a 3-cycle would make cubie set A-B-C become C-A-B.\n;DNF : Initialism for Did Not Finish, used in competitions and self-timing. e.g. when a piece pop occurs and the competitor decides not to continue solving the puzzle, or when the solver stops the timer with the cube still unsolved.\n;DNS : Did Not Start, used in competition when the competitor does not begin a solve, either by opting to skip it (common in Blindfold Cubing), by not showing up when he or she is called, or not qualifying for the remaining (usually three) solves of a certain round.\n;Edge piece : One of the 12 pieces with exactly two stickers, called an \"edge\" piece because only one edge is exposed.\n;ELL : Edges of the Last Layer. The second of two steps of one of the methods of solving the last layer of the cube, solving the edge pieces without disturbing the corner pieces (see CLL).\n;EPLL : Edge Permutation of the Last Layer, specifically refers to the PLL cases in which only edges must be permuted to solve the cube.\n;Explode : When, during a solve, multiple cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;F2B : First two blocks. This is used in the Roux method.\n;F2L : First two layers. This is used in the CFOP (Fridrich), Petrus, and ZZ methods.\n;GJ : Short for Good Job, usually used to congratulate a cuber on a fast solve\n;Layer : One section of a cube consisting of a number of cubies that turn as a unit. (e.g. A standard [[Rubik's Cube]] has 3 ''layers''.)\n;LL : Last Layer. Usually refers to the top layer of the cube, but for the Roux method can refer to the middle layer between the left and right faces.\n;Method : A combination of steps that can be used to solve a cube.\n;Move : A turn of one of the sides of a puzzle or knobs in the case of the clock.\n;''N''-look, also known as ''X''-Look: Refers to the maximum number of iterations of algorithms necessary to complete a step in a particular solving method, often the last layer, e.g. '4-look LL'.\n;NR : Short for National Record (e.g. a record for a country). Can also be \"National Rank\" when referring to the rank of a person's record in a database.\n;OH : Short for One-Handed, it is the event or practice of solving a cube with one hand, left or right.\n;OLL : Orientation of the Last Layer, usually used in reference to the respective step of the CFOP and ZZ methods.\n;OLLCP : Orientation of the Last Layer with Corner Permutation.  An advanced technique where multiple algorithms are learned for one OLL case, in order to use one that will solve the case while also permuting the corners, which results in an easy PLL case.\n;Orient : To change the orientation of a piece.\n;PB :Personal Best - personal record time to solve a puzzle. This can either be a single attempt or a [[Truncated mean|trimmed average]], depending on context:'''PR'''\n:Personal Record - the personal record time to solve a puzzle achieved in competition.\n;[[Permutation|Permute]] : To relocate certain pieces in a way to achieve the desired result.\n;Phasing : Used in various methods, it is a technique that allows the shrinking of algorithm sets by using alternative moves. e.g. Using phasing with ZZ-a will turn it into a reduced subset known as ZZ-b.\n;PLL : Permutation of the Last Layer. Usually used in reference to the respective step of the [[CFOP Method|CFOP]] and ZZ methods, in which case it would follow the OLL step.\n;Pop : When, during a solve, one or more cubies come out of contact with the puzzle, usually causing the puzzle to be unstable, in which, upon turning, more pieces may become loose and possibly pop out too.\n;Prime : A counter-clockwise move popularly denoted with a ', e.g. 'R-Prime', denoted as R', R-, <math>R^{-1}</math>, or Ri. Also (less commonly) known as \"inverse\" or \"inverted\".\n;Slice : The four center pieces and four edge pieces between two opposite layers of the cube.  On a cube with four or more layers, it refers to any of the layers of the puzzle that don't have corner pieces. Also refers '/' moves in Square-1 puzzles.\n;Summer Variation : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair can be solved with R U R' or L' U' L.\n;SQ-1 : Abbreviation for Square-1. Sometimes used as 'Squan'.\n;TPS : Turns per second - the number count of turns per second indicating how fast the cuber turns.\n;Two-Second Penalty, also known as +2 : A penalty of 2 seconds which is added to a solving time in official competitions when the cube is placed back on the timing pad with one or more faces misaligned 45 degrees or more. It can also be given in other cases, such as when the competitor starts the timer too slow or does not correctly stop the timer after finishing the solve.\n;UWR : Unofficial World Record.\n;WCA : [[World Cube Association]], the international governing body for official cube competitions.\n;Winter Variation, also known as WV : A subset of algorithms for F2L that allows the user to force all upper-face corners to be oriented correctly, or an OLL-Skip, while the last F2L pair is already formed. It is used when the last F2L pair (One corner and its corresponding edge correctly positioned relative to each other) to be inserted is in the top layer, with the 3 top-layer edges oriented correctly. There are a total of 27 cases. WV has an average lower move count than the standard OLL.\n;WR : World Record.

      "text": "[[Image:Superflip Rubik's Cube position.png|150px|right|thumb|A computer graphic of a Superflip]]\nThe '''superflip''' or '''12-flip''' is a [[Rubik's Cube]] configuration in which all 20 of the movable subcubes (or \"cubies\") are in the correct permutation, and the eight corners are correctly oriented, but all twelve of the edges are oriented incorrectly (\"flipped\").  It has been shown<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rokicki|first1=Tomas|title=God's Number is 20|url=http://www.cube20.org|website=Cube 20}}</ref> that the shortest path between a solved cube and the Superflip position requires 20 moves under the usual half-turn metric (HTM, in which rotating a face 180° counts as a single move), and that no position requires more  (although there are many other positions that also require 20 moves).\n\nUnder the more restrictive quarter-turn metric (QTM), only 90° face turns are allowed, so 180° turns count as two \"moves\".  In those terms, the Superflip requires 24 moves,<ref>[http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/patterns/U080.01.html The first algorithm is one of several 24 qtm solutions]</ref> and is not maximally distant from the solved state. Instead, when Superflip is composed with the \"four-dot\" or \"four-spot\" position, in which four faces have their centers exchanged with the centers on the opposite face, the resulting position may be unique in requiring 26 moves under QTM.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rokicki|first1=Tomas|title=God's Number is 26 in the Quarter-Turn Metric|url=http://www.cube20.org/qtm/|website=Cube 20}}</ref>\n\n==Solution==\nThis is one possible sequence of moves to generate the Superflip (starting from a solved Rubik's cube), recorded in [[Rubik's Cube#Move notation|Singmaster notation]].

Thistlethwaite''' is a [[Knot theory|knot theorist]] and professor of mathematics for the [[University of Tennessee]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]]. He has made important contributions to both [[knot theory]] and [[Rubik's Cube group]] theory.\n\n==Biography==\nMorwen Thistlethwaite received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1967, his [[M.S.]] from the [[University of London]] in 1968, and his [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Manchester]] in 1972 where his advisor was Michael Barratt. He studied [[piano]] with Tanya Polunin, James Gibb and [[Balint Vazsonyi]], giving concerts in London before deciding to pursue a career in mathematics in 1975. He taught at the [[North London Polytechnic]] from 1975 to 1978 and the [[London South Bank University|Polytechnic of the South Bank, London]] from 1978 to 1987. He served as a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] for a year before going to the [[University of Tennessee]], where he currently is a professor. Thistlethwaite's son Oliver is also a mathematician.<ref>[http://www.oliverthistlethwaite.com Oliver Thistlethwaite]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Tait conjectures===\nMorwen Thistlethwaite helped prove the [[Tait conjectures]], which are:\n#Reduced [[alternating knot|alternating diagrams]] have minimal link [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]].\n#Any two reduced alternating diagrams of a given [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] have equal [[writhe]].\n#Given any two reduced alternating diagrams D<sub>1</sub>,D<sub>2</sub> of an oriented, prime alternating link, D<sub>1</sub> may be transformed to D<sub>2</sub> by means of a sequence of certain simple moves called ''[[flype]]s''. Also known as the [[Tait flyping conjecture]].<br><small>(adapted from MathWorld—A Wolfram Web Resource. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/TaitsKnotConjectures.html)</small><ref>{{MathWorld|TaitsKnotConjectures|Tait's Knot Conjectures}}</ref>\nMorwen Thistlethwaite, along with [[Louis Kauffman]] and [[Kunio Murasugi]] proved the first two Tait conjectures in 1987 and Thistlethwaite and [[William Menasco]] proved the [[Tait flyping conjecture]] in 1991.\n\n===Thistlethwaite's algorithm===\nThistlethwaite also came up with a famous solution to the [[Rubik's Cube]]. The way the algorithm works is by restricting the positions of the cubes into [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of cube positions that can be solved using a certain set of moves. The groups are:\n*G<sub>0</sub> = &lt;L,R,F,B,U,D&gt;\n:This group contains all possible positions of the Rubik's Cube.\n*G<sub>1</sub> = &lt;L,R,F,B,U2,D2&gt;\n:This group contains all positions that can be reached (from the solved state) with quarter turns of the left, right, front and back sides of the Rubik's Cube, but only double turns of the up and down sides.\n*G<sub>2</sub> = &lt;L,R,F2,B2,U2,D2&gt;\n:In this group, the positions are restricted to ones that can be reached with only double turns of the front, back, up and down faces and quarter turns of the left and right faces.\n*G<sub>3</sub> = &lt;L2,R2,F2,B2,U2,D2&gt;\n:Positions in this group can be solved using only double turns on all sides.\n*G<sub>4</sub> = {I}\n:The final group contains only one position, the solved state of the cube.\nThe cube is solved by moving from group to group, using only moves in the current group, for example, a scrambled cube likely lies in group G<sub>0</sub>. A look up table of possible permutations is used that uses quarter turns of all faces to get the cube into group G<sub>1</sub>. Once in group G<sub>1</sub>, quarter turns of the up and down faces are disallowed in the sequences of the look-up tables, and the tables are used to get to group G<sub>2</sub>, and so on, until the cube is solved.<ref>[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/thistle.htm Thistlethwaite's 52-move algorithm<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Dowker notation===\nThistlethwaite, along with [[Clifford Hugh Dowker]], developed [[Dowker notation]], a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] notation suitable for computer use and derived from notations of [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* http://www.math.utk.edu/~morwen/ - Morwen Thistlethwaite's home page.\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=22485 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thistlethwaite, Morwen}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Topologists]]\n[[Category:Academics of London South Bank University]]\n[[Category:University of Tennessee faculty]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of London]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Manchester]]\n[[Category:20th-century British mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century British mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]"

WCA Directors are Officers of the WCA and in addition have the role of Full Delegate. The WCA Board is responsible for the WCA organization as a whole. As part of their day-to-day work, they discuss issues that affect the WCA and advise the committees. The WCA Board oversees that the applications to hold WCA Competitions meet fair conditions to give all the world similar chances to compete, and finally approves and announces the competitions accordingly. After competitions, they read reports from the WCA delegates about competitions in order to be up to date on the WCA activity worldwide and take part in the discussion of any incidents that occur.\n\nThe Board is also responsible for helping WCA fulfill its mission: “more competitions in more countries with more people and more fun, under fair and equal conditions.” This means spreading cubing to new communities and countries and working together with the Senior Delegates to open up cubing to even more people.\n\n===WCA Teams and Committees===\n====WCA Communication Team====\nThe WCA Communications Team (WCT) is in charge of overseeing and supporting communications of the WCA with the community and general public. This includes answering general requests that are submitted via the WCA website and maintaining the social media accounts of the WCA. The team responds to multiple emails a day from all around the world regarding starting cubing competitions in new areas, what to do for your first competition, big media requests about competitive speedcubing, and many other issues. Many requests are also forwarded to the appropriate WCA team or delegate if they are in regard to a particular competition or specialization.\n\n====WCA Competition Announcement Team====\nThe WCA Competition Announcement Team (WCAT) is responsible for approving and announcing WCA Competitions and ensure such announcements adhere to WCA quality standards. They Review and announce competition submissions in WCA. They train Delegates to properly utilize the tools that WCA has for them.\n\n====WCA Disciplinary Committee====\nThe WCA Disciplinary Committee (WDC) investigates a variety of situations and proposes solutions including punishments when necessary. Among other topics, these situations could be serious violations of WCA regulations or community issues. They deal with many instances of cheating, general conduct, or disputes in the way that delegates and organizers run events. They are also responsible for issues that may occur in the WCA internally.\n\nThey can be contacted by WCA officials or community members to be made aware of possible violations at WCA competitions. Initial contact with the team is usually through emails or directly from any competitor or delegate. If the Team Leader agrees that this case falls under the WDC’s jurisdiction, a WDC case is initiated. The team attempts to correspond with everyone involved, to get all sides of the story and to provide an independent report for the investigation. Once the case is closed and the decision made, they inform all relevant persons of any actions and make a public announcement, if necessary.\n\n====WCA Financial Committee====\nThe WCA Financial Committee (WFC) is responsible for everything regarding finances within the WCA. As an Advisory Committee, they manage the finances and accounts of the WCA in accordance with an approved annual budget proposal, which is also their work to provide on a regular basis. Similarly, the Financial Committee pays invoices and taxes that are directed to the WCA, after consultation and with permission of the WCA Board. On a quarterly basis they report and advise the WCA Board on all finances of the WCA, to give them a summary of the scope of financial possibilities and options that the WCA has.\n\n====WCA Regulations Committee====\nThe WCA Regulations Committee (WRC) was founded to support the WCA Board in maintaining the WCA Regulations in 2011. Over the years, their area of responsibility has been broadened, so that they handle all issues which are related to the application, the improvement and the development of the WCA Regulations today. They support delegates on any kind of procedural matters happening at competitions and decide on unresolved and uncovered incidents. The WRC regularly publishes WCA internal reports to help all delegates and improve their knowledge of the Regulations.\nThis includes regulation changes based on feedback from the WCA staff and the community, while also taking into account their own insights and reports of incidents that occur during WCA competitions. New versions of the Regulations are published on a periodic basis. Another part of their work is to encourage members of the WCA community to create and maintain translations of the Regulations.\n\n====WCA Results Team====\nThe WCA Results Team (WRT) is responsible for managing all data in the databases of the WCA, most importantly competition results and person data.\n\nThe most time-consuming regular task of the WCA Results Team is posting results of WCA competitions to the WCA website, once the delegate of the competition has sent them in. They rigorously check if the results were submitted correctly and if so, transfer them into the WCA results database. This work of the Results Team assures the data quality of the databases of the WCA. Each such posting procedure is ended by creating a public post on the WCA website - these are the posts that you can see on the front page of the WCA website!\nApart from posting competition results, the WCA Results Team is also responsible for making corrections to competition results if necessary and they are in charge of administering all WCA profile pages. This includes for example changing user data, like dates of birth, according to verified requests and managing profile picture requests.\n\n====WCA Software Team====\nThe WCA website is a huge open source project on [[GitHub]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org|title=WCA Github Repository|publisher=World Cube Association|access-date=24 September 2017}}</ref> They bring continuous improvements to the website very frequently, to allow all of community members to easily access and enjoy WCA content. Recently internationalization was implemented, so now people can use the WCA website in their native language. Other important milestones are the development of the registration system, and especially payments. The team keeps an eye on the website all the time to ensure it's permanently available and they react as fast as possible whenever something is wrong.\n\nThe Software Team develops new software for various tasks within the WCA whenever needed. Thus, they created an app simplifying translating the website, to engage more people translating into their language. Also, few years back, the WCA Workbook assistant was designed, which is used by all delegates to submit the competition results to the WCA Results Team. The Software Team also updates the official WCA Scrambler, TNoodle, according to data provided by the WCA Regulations Committee if changes are needed. Additionally, they maintain and develop administrative tools for various Delegates, Committees and Board members on the WCA website.\n\n===WCA Delegates===\nWCA Delegates are members of the WCA who are responsible for making sure that all WCA competitions are run according to the mission, regulations, and spirit of the WCA. This means that at every competition a WCA Delegate needs to be present to be considered official. The WCA has three different types of delegates: WCA Senior Delegates, WCA Delegates and WCA Candidate Delegates. Beyond the duties of a WCA Delegate a WCA Senior Delegate is responsible for managing the delegates in their area and should also be contacted by the community for regional matters. They are available to mentor the delegates in their area - especially when new communities are being developed. New delegates are listed as WCA Candidate Delegates at first and need to show their ability of managing competitions successfully before being listed as WCA Delegates. If possible they may delegate their first competitions alongside more experienced delegates to get the hang of all responsibilities connected to delegate a WCA competition.\n\nAll acknowledged WCA Delegates, Candidate Delegates and Senior Delegates can be found on their official Website.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates |title=WCA Delegates |publisher=World Cube Association |access-date=24 September 2017}}</ref>\n<!--\nWCA Delegates are present at competition.

[[Chris Hardwick (speedcuber)|Chris Hardwick]] from Raleigh, NC founded the Yahoo! Group \"Speedsolvingrubikscube\" and the Unofficial World Records, a place where cubers could post their personal best times. [[Ron van Bruchem]] started speedcubing.com together with his friend Ton Dennenbroek, an avid puzzle collector.\n\nBecause the cubers were living all over the world, they wanted to organize a competition at which they could all meet. In 2003, under the guidance of Dan Gosbee, they organized the Rubik's Cube World Championship in [[Toronto]]. This first modern-age Rubik's Cube competition was a huge success, but there were lots of issues, largely due to the lack of any regulations. After the World Championship, van Bruchem and [[Tyson Mao]] started organizing competitions in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]], as well as at [[Caltech]] in the [[United States]]. In 2004, they started the World Cube Association, which today has held competitions in more than 90 countries.\n\n==Events==\nCurrently, the WCA offers competitions in 18 events. Not all of them are offered at every competition, but they are usually all offered at national, continental, and global championships.

Magnetic connectors ensure continuous data exchange between the self-contained modules and the streamlined gaming process. Several games have been designed for WowCube, including [[puzzles]], [[brain-teasers]], [[Scrabble]], [[platformers]], and [[mazes]]. The gaming experience provided by WOWCube is based on the [[mixed reality]] approach, which combines twisting and shaking the cube in reality with digital actions visualized on 24 squared subdisplays.\n\nThe console combines the properties of physical gadgets, such dynamic twiddling toys (e.g., [[Fidget spinner]]), and [[Video game console|digital gaming consoles]] in one unit.\n.<ref name=venturebeat/><ref name=knowtechie>{{cite news|author=Josiah Motley|title=WOWCube is a digital, interactive gadget designed by a 13-year-old|url=https://knowtechie.com/wowcube-gadget/|work=KnowTechie|date= 2018-05-31|accessdate=2018-07-19}}</ref>\n\n== Technical Description ==\nThe unit consists of eight identical sections which exchange data via groups of magnetic contacts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf;?docId=WO2018075714 |title=Patent WO2018075714 \"ELECTRICAL CONNECTOR\" 2018 |publisher=WIPO.int |accessdate=2018-07-18 |language=en}}</ref> The contacts, along with acting as communicating devices, ensure the stability of the entire structure, which allows the player to observe the gaming process on common faces comprised by displays of four adjacent sections.\n\nEach section contains: \n* three 1.56” 240x240 IPS [[Thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display|TFT]] displays protected by [[Gorilla Glass]]; \n* an [[STM32|STM32F405]] [[microcontroller]] 168&nbsp;MHz clock speed and 192 kB main memory; \n* an 8 MB [[Flash memory|flash]] memory;\n* a 6-axis [[gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]]; \n* a 540 mA/h battery, and\n* a [[Bluetooth]] module for connection with a [[smartphone]] or a [[tablet PC]].\n\nIn the current version, the size of the unit is 3″ x 3″ x 3″ (76х76х76mm) and its weight is 14 oz (400g).

The [[P-code machine|P-code]] is interpreted by the [[abstract machine]] of the Pawn language, which allows executing precompiled game logics both on the console, and in its software [[Video game console emulator|emulation]]. The WowCube [[Software development kit|SDK]] contains a [[software emulator]], which allows launching the designed games on a PC without an actual console. All components of the WowCube software are used under open licenses, such as [[MIT License]], [[BSD Licenses]], and [[Apache License]].\n\n== WowCube SDK ==\n[[File:WOWCube Emulator GUI.gif.gif|thumb|right|The WOWCube 3D Emulator Interface in the Language of [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]]]]\nThe WowCube [[Software development kit|SDK]] includes a [[Video game console emulator|software emulator]] which allows developing software programs with no actual WowCube console available. Currently, the supported operating systems are Windows and MacOS. The emulator is based on the following free open-source software\n* [[Processing (programming language)|Processing]] language is used for 3D visualization of the game console, game (picture) uploading and displaying, and conveying various events (turning of the puzzle elements, accelerometer actions) from the user to the logics written in the Pawn language. \n* Pawn language is used to write gaming logics, which reacts to events occurring in the actual WowCube console or in the emulator, and responding, in its turn, with a sequence of commands on visualizing the changes in the game environment.\n* [[Visual Studio Code]] [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] is used to edit the game code in the Pawn language and execute it in the software emulator. The code for the 3D viewer of the WowCube, which is written in the Processing language, can be also edited.\n\n== Similar gadgets ==\n\n*[[Siftable]] (the retail product sold by Sifteo, Inc. is called [[Sifteo cubes]]) are interactive module units (cubes) developed in the [[MIT Media Lab]] and capable of reproducing graphic images, determine the nature of their own spatial location, and interact with other modules. The interaction occurs when cubes are brought in contact, tilted, shaken, or turned. Each Siftable cube is equipped with a color display and IR ports on four sides of the unit for communication with other modules. The communication with a PC is via a [[Bluetooth]] module, images and data are stored in a flash storage. An [[accelerometer]] is used to monitor motions along three axes, shaking, tilting, and other changes in the spatial position of modules.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Merrill |first1=D. |last2=Kalanithi |first2=J. |last3=Maes |first3=P. |date=2007-02-15 |title=Siftables: towards sensor network user interfaces |url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1226984 |journal=Proceedings of the 1st international conference on Tangible and embedded interaction.

It was patented on 26 March 1985, with US patent number 4,506,891, and sold by the [[Ideal Toy Company]].\nIt came in two varieties: painted surfaces or stickers. Since the design of the puzzle practically forces the stickers to peel with continual use, the painted variety is likely a later edition.\n\n==Description==\n\nThe puzzle has 30 moving pieces, which rotate in star-shaped groups of five around its outermost vertices. The purpose of the puzzle is to rearrange the moving pieces so that each star is surrounded by five faces of the same color, and opposite stars are surrounded by the same color. This is equivalent to solving just the edges of a six-color [[Megaminx]].\nThis is an odd puzzle to solve, and never really looks complete unless you know what you're looking for. The puzzle is solved when each pair of parallel planes is made up of only one colour. To see a plane, however, you have to look \"past\" the five pieces on top of it, all of which could/should have different colours than the plane you're solving.\n\nIf considering the pentagonal regions as faces, like in the great dodecahedron represented by [[Schläfli symbol]] {5,5/2}, then the requirement is for all faces to be monochrome (same color) and for opposite faces to share the same color.\n\nThe puzzle does not turn smoothly, due to its unique design.<ref>Wray, C. G. (1981). The cube: How to do it. Totternhoe (, Church Green, Totternhoe, Beds. ): C.G. Wray.</ref>\n\n==Permutations==\nThere are 30 edges, each of which can be flipped into two positions, giving a theoretical maximum of 30!×2<sup>30</sup> permutations. This value is not reached for the following reasons:\n# Only even permutations of edges are possible, reducing the possible edge arrangements to 30!/2.\n# The orientation of the last edge is determined by the orientation of the other edges, reducing the number of edge orientations to 2<sup>29</sup>.\n# Since opposite sides of the solved puzzle are the same color, each edge piece has a duplicate. It would be impossible to swap all 15 pairs (an odd permutation), so a reducing factor of 2<sup>14</sup> is applied.\n# The orientation of the puzzle does not matter (since there are no fixed face centers to serve as reference points), dividing the final total by 60. There are 60 possible positions and orientations of the first edge, but all of them are equivalent because of the lack of face centers.\n\nThis gives a total of <math>\\frac{30!\\times 2^{15}}{120} \\approx 7.24\\times 10^{34}</math> possible combinations.\n\nThe precise figure is 72 431 714 252 715 638 411 621 302 272 000 000 (roughly 72.4 decillion on the [[names of large numbers|short scale]] or 72.4 quintilliard on the long scale).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/alexandr.htm Description and solution]\n\n==References==\n{{RefList}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Ideal Toy Company]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

It was invented in 1985 by Robert Webb, however it was not mass-produced until ten years later. It has a total of 12 external movable pieces to rearrange, compared to 20 movable pieces on the Rubik's Cube.\n\n==History==\nRobert Webb designed and made the first prototype of what would become the Dino Cube in 1985; his original prototype was made entirely out of [[paper]].<ref name=\"paper\" /> Since then the puzzle was reinvented twice, but full mass production of the puzzle did not start until 1995.<ref name=\"6f\" />  The first mass-produced version had pictures of [[dinosaur]]s depicted on each piece, which led to the adoption of the puzzle's current name of ''Dino Cube''.<ref name=\"dino\">[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=606 Dino Cube (with dinosaurs)] - Twisty Puzzles Museum</ref> It is not known what the puzzle had been called before this dinosaur version was introduced. The later versions, however, adopted the practice of using standard single-colour stickers, in common with most other twisty puzzles.<ref name=\"6f\" />\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Dino Cube twist.jpg|thumb|The six-colour Dino Cube in the middle of a move, showing how the puzzle can be scrambled. Note the black pieces inside of the puzzle: these are \"hidden\" corner pieces which form the core of the puzzle.]]\nThe Dino Cube is a twisty puzzle in the shape of a cube. It consists of 12 movable pieces, all of which are located on the edges of the cube.<ref name=\"6f\" /><ref name=\"paper\" /><ref name=\"dino\" />\n\nThe puzzle can be thought of as twisting around its corners: each ''move'' changes the position of three edge pieces adjacent to the same corner, by rotating them around that corner.<ref name=\"6f\" /><ref name=\"Jaap\" /> There are in fact eight more \"hidden\" pieces inside the puzzle, which are located at the corners and are fixed to the puzzle's core; these pieces only become visible in the middle of a move.\n\nThe vast majority of mass-produced Dino Cubes have the standard six-colour scheme, with one colour on each face of the cube in the solved state.<ref name=\"6f\" /> This is in common with most other cubic twisty puzzles, including the [[Rubik's Cube]]. However, a few versions with other colour schemes also exist, including one with four colours (where each colour is centred around one corner of the cube in the solved state),<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=828 Dino Cube (4 colours)] - Twisty Puzzles Museum</ref> and one with just two colours (where each colour present on half of the puzzle).<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=858 Dino Cube (2 colours)] - Twisty Puzzles Museum</ref>\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colours and then restore them to their original configuration, usually of one colour per face.\n\n==Solving==\n[[File:Dino Cube mix.jpg|thumb|The six-colour Dino Cube, fully scrambled]]\n[[File:Dino Cube 2.jpg|thumb|The Dino cube in its second solved state, which is a mirror image of the first one.]]\nThe Dino Cube is considered to be one of the easiest twisty puzzles to solve. One of the things that make it so easy is the fact that each move only affects three edge pieces at once, which means it is easy to solve one part of the puzzle without disturbing what is already solved. In addition, each edge piece only has one possible orientation, meaning that if a given piece is in the correct position, it will always be orientated the correct way as well. Therefore, the solver never has to worry about changing the orientation of any pieces.<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\nAlthough not obvious at the first glance, the six-colour Dino Cube actually has two distinct configurations that represent a solved puzzle. The two solutions are mirror images of each other and the only visual difference between them is their colour schemes; for example, one solution has the colours ''Blue - Yellow - Red'' going [[clockwise]] around one vertex, while in the other these colours go anticlockwise.<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\nMathematically, the puzzle is identical to Hoberman's [[BrainTwist]], which is a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] puzzle that can \"flip\" inside out and reveal another set of four faces. Like the Dino Cube, The BrainTwist has twelve movable pieces, and each move rotates three pieces around one corner. It also likewise has two distinct solutions: one with the same colour on each of the faces and one with the same colour at each of the corners.<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThe Dino Cube has twelve edge pieces. This means naturally there are twelve possible positions for the first given edge, however due to the lack of visible fixed \"reference\" pieces, all of these positions are [[rotational symmetry|rotationally symmetrical]] to each other. Therefore, the position of the first given edge is not taken into account.\n\nThe remaining eleven edge pieces can be permutated in 11[[factorial|!]] different ways, relative to the first edge piece. Only even permutations of these pieces are possible (i.e. it is impossible to swap one pair of pieces while leaving the rest of the puzzle solved), which divides the limit by 2.\n\nThe edge pieces cannot be flipped or misorientated (See [[#Solving|''Solving'']]), therefore this is also not taken into account.\n\nThe total number of possible combinations on the six-colour Dino Cube is therefore equal to:<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\n:<math>\\frac{11!}{2} = 19</math> <math>958</math> <math>400</math>\n\nThis number is low compared to the number of combinations of the Rubik's Cube (which has over 4.3×10<sup>19</sup> combinations) but still larger than many other puzzles in the Rubik's Cube family, notably the [[Pocket Cube]] (over 3.6 million combinations) and the [[Pyraminx]] (just over 930 thousand combinations, excluding rotations of the trivial tips).\n\n===Optimal solutions===\nThe number of possible of configurations, 19 958 400, is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarises the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' moves to solve the six-colour Dino Cube (''p<sub>2</sub>'' for either solution, ''p<sub>1</sub>'' for one specific solution):<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

These include the aforementioned ''[[BrainTwist]]'', in the shape of a tetrahedron that can flip inside out, the ''Platypus'', whose shape is also based on a tetrahedron, the ''Redi Cube'', a cubic version with shallower cuts, and the ''Rainbow Cube'', in the shape of a [[cuboctahedron]].<ref name=\"Jaap\" /> The latter three puzzles, unlike the Dino Cube, also have their \"core\" pieces visible.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Skewb]]\n* [[BrainTwist]]\n* [[Pyraminx Duo]]\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Skewb Diamond]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]"

There are also a good number of internal moving pieces inside the puzzle, which are necessary to keep it in one piece as its surface pieces are rearranged. [[Image:Dogic10-3.jpg|frame|left|The 10-color Dogic, with the two possible layers of rotation slightly twisted.]] There are two types of twists that it can undergo: a shallow twist which rotates the 5 triangles around a single tip, and a deep twist which rotates 5 entire faces (including the triangles around the tip) around the tip. The shallow twist moves the triangles between faces but keeps them around the same tip; the deeper twist moves the triangles between the 5 tips lying at the base of the rotated faces but keeps them on the same faces. Each triangle has a single color, while the face centers may have up to 3 colors, depending on the particular coloring scheme employed.\n\n== Solutions ==\n\nThe solutions for the different versions of the Dogic differ.\n\nThe 12-color Dogic is the more challenging version, where the face centers must be rearranged to match the colors of the face centers in adjacent faces. The triangles must then match the corresponding colors in the face centers. The face centers are mathematically equivalent to the corner pieces of the [[Megaminx]], and so the same algorithms may be used for solving either. The triangles are relatively easy to solve once the face centers are in place, because the 5 triangles per tip are identical in color and may be freely interchanged.\n\nThe 10-color Dogic is slightly less challenging, since there is no unique solved state: the face centers may be randomly placed relative to each other, and the result would still look 'solved'. However, it may still be desirable to put them in aesthetically pleasing arrangements, such as pairing up faces of the same color, as depicted in the second photograph. The triangles are slightly more tricky to solve than in the 12-color Dogic, because adjacent triangles in the solved state are not the same color and so cannot be freely interchanged.\n\nThe 5-color and 2-color Dogics are even less of a challenge, since there is a large number of identical pieces. These simpler versions cater to those puzzle fans who are not yet at the skill level to manage the full complexity of the 12-color Dogic.\n\n== Number of combinations ==\n\nDue to different numbers of visually identical pieces in the two versions of the puzzle, they each have a different number of possible combinations. There are 60 tip pieces and 20 centres with 3 orientations, giving a theoretical maximum of 60!·20!·3<sup>20</sup> positions. This limit is not reached on either puzzle, due to reducing factors detailed below.\n\n=== 12-color Dogic ===\n# Only even permutations of centres are possible (2)\n# The orientation of the first 19 centres determines the orientation of the last centre. (3)\n# Some tip pieces are indistinguishable (5!<sup>12</sup>)\n# The orientation of the puzzle does not matter (60): all 60 possible positions and orientations of the first center are equivalent because of the lack of fixed reference points.\n\nThis leaves <math>\\frac{59!\\times 20!\\times 3^{19}}{2\\times 5!^{12}} \\approx 2.20\\times 10^{82}</math> positions for the 12-color Dogic.\n\nThe precise figure is 21 991 107 793 244 335 592 538 616 581 443 187 569 604 232 889 165 919 156 829 382 848 981 603 083 878 400 000 (roughly 22 sesvigintillion on the [[names of large numbers|short scale]] or 22 tredecilliard on the long scale).\n\n=== 10-color Dogic ===\n\n# Only even permutations of the centres are possible (2)\n# Centre orientation does not matter (3<sup>20</sup>)\n# Ten of the centres are visually identical to the other ten (2<sup>10</sup>)\n# Some tip pieces are indistinguishable (6!<sup>10</sup>)\n# The orientation of the puzzle does not matter (60)\n\nThis leaves <math>\\frac{59!\\times 20!}{2^{11}\\times 6!^{10}} \\approx 4.40\\times 10^{66}</math> positions for the 10-color Dogic.\n\nThe precise figure is 4 400 411 583 858 825 100 777 127 453 704 140 502 784 413 155 112 522 644 357 120 000 000 (roughly 4.4 unvigintillion on the short scale or 4.4 undecillion on the long scale).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Pyraminx]]\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Impossiball]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n\n== References ==\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/dogic.htm Jaap's Dogic page], which includes solutions and some brief historical data.\n*[http://www.calormen.com/TwistyPuzzles/twisty.htm The Magic Polyhedra Patent Page]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

      "text": "{{self-published|date=September 2018}}\n{{notability|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Floppy Cube solved 1.png|thumb|The Floppy Cube in its solved state.]]\n[[File:Floppy Cube twisted 2.png|thumb|The original Floppy Cube has a mechanism that causes the centre piece to \"bend\" outwards during a twist, preventing the corners from falling off.]]\n[[File:Floppy Cube scrambled 1.png|thumb|The Floppy Cube, scrambled.]]\nThe '''Floppy Cube'''<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/floppy.htm Floppy Cube] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref> is a [[cuboid]]al [[twisty puzzle]] in the style of the [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was originally invented by [[Katsuhiko Okamoto]] and mass-produced by Gentosha Toys,<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\" /> although several other companies have since mass-produced it as well.\n\n==Overview==\nThe Floppy Cube is essentially a 1x3x3 Rubik's Cube: it is made up of 9 identical [[Cube|cubic]] pieces arranged into a 1x3x3 cuboid.<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\" />\n\nThe puzzle consists of 4 corner pieces, 4 edge pieces and 1 centre piece. Each corner piece has four colours each, each edge piece has three colours each, while the centre piece has two colours (on the opposite faces). The puzzle can be thought of as twisting around its edge pieces - each twist causes one edge piece to rotate 180° in place, and the two adjacent corner pieces to swap positions (while also being rotated).\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colours, and then restore it to its original state of having one colour per face.\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThere are 4 edge pieces, each of which can be twisted into two different orientations, independently of the other edge pieces. Therefore, the edges can be orientated in 2<sup>4</sup> different ways. They cannot be permutated. There are also 4 corner pieces, which can be permutated in 4! different ways. They cannot be flipped; their orientation is fully determined by their location. The whole puzzle also has a parity constraint: the parity of the corner permutation is the same as the parity of the number of flipped edges. This divides the full number by 2.\n\nThe full number of possible combinations on the Floppy Cube is therefore:<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\" />\n\n:<math>\\frac{2^{4} \\times 4!}{2} = 192</math>\n\nIn relative terms, this number is extremely low compared to other puzzles like the [[Rubik's Cube]] (with over 43 quintillion combinations),<ref name=\"cube20\">[http://www.cube20.org/ God's Number is 20]</ref> the [[Rubik's Domino]] (which has just under 410 million combinations),<ref name=\"Jaap Domino\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/domino.htm Rubik's Domino] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref> or the [[Pocket Cube]] (with over 3.6 million combinations).<ref name=\"Jaap 2x2x2\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cube2.htm 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>\n\n===God's Number===\nAs explained above, the total number of possible configurations of the Floppy Cube is 192, which is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarises the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the puzzle:<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\" />\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! ''n''\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n! ''p''\n| 1 || 4 || 10 || 24 || 53 || 64 || 31 || 4 || 1 || '''192'''\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe above table shows that the puzzle is always at most 8 twists away from its solved state (i.e. its [[God's Number]] is 8). Similarly to the total number of combinations, this number is very low compared to the Rubik's Cube (20),<ref name=\"cube20\" /> the Rubik's Domino (18)<ref name=\"Jaap Domino\" /> and, to some extent, the Pocket Cube (11).<ref name=\"Jaap 2x2x2\" />\n\nThe table also shows that there is only one combination that is exactly 8 moves away from the solved state; this is the combination in which all the corners are in their correct places but all the edges are flipped, analogous to the \"superflip\" on the Rubik's Cube, which requires 20 moves to solve.<ref name=\"Jaap Floppy\" />\n\n==Super Floppy Cube==\nThe '''Super Floppy Cube''' (often shortened to ''Super Floppy'')<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\">[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/floppy2.htm Super Floppy] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref> is a common variant of the Floppy Cube. It was also invented by Katsuhiko Okamoto<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\" /> but several versions have also been produced by other companies.\n\nThe key difference between this puzzle and the Floppy Cube is that the Floppy Cube is restricted to only 180° rotations (i.e. an edge piece cannot be twisted 90°), while the Super Floppy Cube does allow edges to rotate 90°. This in turn allows the corner pieces to move to locations ''above'' and ''below'' the edge pieces and thus change the shape of the puzzle.<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\" />\n\nThere is also a subtle difference between the original version of the puzzle and the version mass-produced by other companies. The original puzzle has an internal mechanism which prevents an isolated edge piece from turning - i.e. an edge piece may only twist if there is at least one corner piece adjacent to it. The mass-produced version does not feature this mechanism, which allows edge pieces to twist \"on their own\" - causing the puzzle to be considerably easier.<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\" />\n\n===Number of combinations===\nThe four edge pieces now have 4 orientations each on the Super Floppy Cube (compared to the Floppy Cube's 2); therefore, the edges can now be orientated in 4<sup>4</sup> different ways. However, the edges still cannot be permutated.\n\nThere are now 12 different locations that the four corner pieces could be located in (up from 4); this means they can now be permutated in 12!/(12-4)! different ways. The corners still cannot be flipped; their orientation continues to be fully dependent on their position.\n\nAll of these positions are attainable: there is no parity constraint, regardless of whether the edge pieces can twist on their own or not.\n\nThe full number is therefore:<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\" />\n\n:<math>\\frac{4^{4} \\times 12!}{(12-4)!} = \\frac{4^{4} \\times 12!}{8!} = 3</math> <math>041</math> <math>280</math>\n\nThis number is significantly larger than the number of combinations on the Floppy Cube. The God's Number for this puzzle is also considerably larger than that of the Floppy Cube: 13 (when edges can twist on their own) or 15 (when they cannot).<ref name=\"Jaap Super Floppy\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Rubik's Domino]]\n*[[Pyraminx Duo]]\n*[[Square One (puzzle)|Square One]]\n*[[Rubik's Clock]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

It has a total of 20 movable pieces to rearrange, same as the Rubik's Cube, but all of the Impossiball's pieces are corners, like the [[Pocket Cube]].\n\n== History ==\nWilliam O. Gustafson applied for a patent for the Impossiball design in 1981 and it was issued in 1984.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=koIzAAAAEBAJ&dq=US+4,474,376 Impossiball patent]</ref> [[Uwe Mèffert]] eventually bought the rights to some of the patents and continues to sell it in his puzzle shop under the Impossiball moniker.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Impossiball is made in the shape of an [[icosahedron]] that has been rounded out to a sphere, and has 20 pieces, all of them corners. The puzzle has twelve circles located at the vertices of the icosahedron, and on the six-color version opposite circles are the same color. Because of the rounded shape of the puzzle, the pieces move up and down as they are rotated. It is also possible to remove one piece, turning the puzzle into a spherical version of the [[15 puzzle]].\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore it to its original state of having one color per circle. This puzzle is equivalent to solving just the corners of a [[Megaminx]]. The original Impossiball had the same colors as the Rubik's Cube: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and white. Meffert currently produces two versions, one with six colors and one with twelve. The six-color version (pictured) uses pink, two shades of orange, yellow, green and blue. All the pieces are still distinguishable, however, because the two pieces with the same three colors are mirror images of each other. The twelve-color version has red, pink, orange, yellow, two shades of green, three shades of blue, purple, brown and white.\n\n== Solutions ==\nIn spite of its daunting appearance and greater number of possible positions, the Impossiball is not much more difficult than the standard 2×2×2 [[Pocket Cube]]. This is because it is not a deep-cut puzzle; it only has pentagonal face layers which are similar in structure to the square face layers of the cube. There are no pieces that do not have a counterpart on the cube. Many of the techniques employed in the solution of the Pocket Cube can also be adapted for the Impossiball.\n\n== Number of combinations ==\nThere are 20!/2 ways to arrange the pieces, since there is no way to create odd permutations without tampering with the puzzle. There are 3<sup>19</sup> ways to orient the pieces, since the orientation of the last depends on that of the preceding ones. Since the Impossiball has no fixed face centers, this result is divided by 60. There are 60 possible positions and orientations of the first corner, but all are equivalent because of the lack of face centers.\n\n:<math>\\frac{20! \\times 3^{19}}{120} \\approx 2.36 \\times 10^{25}</math>\nThe entire number is 23 563 902 142 421 896 679 424 000 (roughly 23.6 septillion on the [[long and short scales|short scale]] or 23.6 quadrillion on the long scale).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Alexander's Star]]\n*[[Tuttminx]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.mefferts.com/ Meffert's puzzle shop]\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/impossi.htm Jaap's Impossiball page] &mdash; contains solutions and other information\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]"

It has a total of 50 movable pieces to rearrange, compared to the 20 movable pieces of the Rubik's Cube.\n\n== History ==\nThe Megaminx, or Magic Dodecahedron, was invented by several people independently and produced by several different manufacturers with slightly different designs. [[Uwe Mèffert]] eventually bought the rights to some of the patents and continues to sell it in his puzzle shop under the Megaminx moniker.<ref>[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/megaminx.htm Jaap's puzzle page, Megaminx]</ref> It is also known by the name Hungarian Supernova, invented by Dr.&nbsp;Cristoph Bandelow.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pid=651 twistypuzzles.com, Hungarian Supernova]</ref> His version came out first, shortly followed by Meffert's Megaminx. The proportions of the two puzzles are slightly different.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Megaminx is made in the shape of a [[dodecahedron]], and has 12 faces and center pieces, 20 corner pieces, and 30 edge pieces. The face centers each have a single color, which identifies the color of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colors, and the corner pieces have three. Each face contains a center piece, 5 corner pieces and 5 edge pieces. The corner and edge pieces are shared with adjacent faces. The face centers can only rotate in place, but the other pieces can be permuted by twisting the face layer around the face center.\n\nThere are two main versions of the Megaminx: one with 6 colors, with opposite faces having the same color, and one with 12 different colors. The 12-color Megaminx is the only type legal in official [[World Cube Association|WCA]] competitions, and is therefore much more popular than the 6-color version.\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore it to its original state of having one color per face.\n\n== Solutions ==\nThe 6-color Megaminx comes with an additional challenge which is not immediately obvious (and which does not occur on the 12-color puzzle). Its edge pieces come in visually identical pairs, because of the duplicated colors of opposite faces. However, although visually indistinguishable, they are nevertheless mathematically bound in a [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] relationship. In any legal position (reachable from the solved state without disassembling the puzzle), there is always an even number of swapped pairs of edges. However, since swaps may be between visually identical edges, one may find that having solved almost the entire puzzle, one is left with a pair of swapped (distinct) edges that seems to defy all attempts to exchange them. The solution is to swap a single pair of 'identical' edges to resolve the parity issue, and then restore the rest of the puzzle.\n\nThis property is absent in the 12-color Megaminx, because all its edges are distinguishable, and it would be immediately obvious that there is another pair of swapped edges besides the pair one is working with.\n\nBesides solving a Megaminx the regular way, patterns can be made on it just like a [[Rubik's Cube]].  Examples of these include a star, checkerboard, and pentagon in a pentagon patterns.\n\n== Variations ==\nThere are many similar puzzles with different numbers of layers, most of which change the \"mega\" in the puzzle's name to another [[metric prefix]]. They are the Kilominx (2 layers), Master Kilominx (4 layers), Gigaminx (5 layers), Elite Kilominx (6 layers), Teraminx (7 layers), Petaminx (9 layers), Examinx (11 layers), Zettaminx (13 layers), and Yottaminx (15 layers).<ref>[http://www.chaosottolo.it/se-pensate-che-il-cubo-di-rubik-sia-difficile-non-avete-ancora-visto-megaminx-gigaminx-teraminx-e-petaminx.html Gigaminx and Teraminx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606000042/http://www.chaosottolo.it/se-pensate-che-il-cubo-di-rubik-sia-difficile-non-avete-ancora-visto-megaminx-gigaminx-teraminx-e-petaminx.html |date=2009-06-06 }} {{it icon}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLyFqm4D9tI Video of Petaminx]</ref> The highest order mass-produced variant of the Megaminx is the Petaminx, which was released by MF8 and then later by ShengShou, and the highest order variant of the Megaminx ever made to date is the Yottaminx, created by Matt Bahner using 3D printing.

In both cases, only even permutations are possible, regardless of the position of the other set of pieces.

There are 20!/2 ways to arrange the corners and 3<sup>19</sup> ways to orient them, since the orientation of the last corner depends on that of the preceding ones.

There are 15 pairs of identical edges. It would not be possible to swap all 15 pairs, since this would be an odd permutation of the edges, so a reducing factor of 2<sup>14</sup> is applied to the preceding figure.\n\n:<math>20! \\times 3^{19} \\times 30! \\times 2^{13} \\approx 6.14 \\times 10^{63}</math>\nThe full number is 6 144 385 775 971 883 979 645 753 925 393 402 415 081 061 792 664 780 800 000 000 000 (roughly 6.1 vigintillion on the short scale or 6.1 decilliard on the long scale).\n\nFor the larger size variations (gigaminx, teraminx, petaminx etc), the general number of combinations is <math>\\frac{30! \\times 20! \\times 60!^{n^2-1} \\times 2^{28-n} \\times 3^{19}}{5!^{12n(n-1)}}</math> where <math>n = 1,2,3,4,...</math> respectively for megaminx, gigaminx, teraminx, petaminx, etc.<ref>[http://michael-gottlieb.blogspot.com/2008/05/number-of-positions-of-generalized.html Generalized number of permutations for all twisty puzzles.

This name was later shortened by some to '''Nine-Colour Cube'''.<ref name=\"Jaap\" /> When [[Uwe Mèffert|Meffert's]] started mass-producing the puzzle, the company changed the shape of the cubies into spheres and thus adopted the name '''Ball Sudoku Cube'''<ref name=\"Meffert.B\" /> (since the aim of the puzzle is similar to that of the [[Sudoku Cube]]). However, when [[Recent Toys]] started selling the puzzle with Meffert's branding, they named it '''Molecube'''<ref name=\"RedKB\" /><ref>[http://www.recenttoys.com/rt-download/molecube/ Molecube] - Recent Toys Int.</ref> (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|k|juː|b}}), presumably due to its resemblance to a [[molecular model]]. The Twisty Puzzles Museum already uses the term \"Molecube\" to refer to another, mechanically different twisty puzzle.<ref>[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=2089 Molecube] - Twisty Puzzles Museum</ref> In late 2016, Meffert's introduced a stickerless, cubic (albeit pillowed) version of the puzzle and called it the '''Kokonotsu Pillow'''.<ref name=\"Mefferts.K\">[http://www.mefferts.com/products/details.php?lang=en&category=13&id=1198 Kokonotsu Pillow] - Meffert's</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nJust like a regular Rubik's Cube, the Nine-Colour Cube consists of 6 face centre pieces, 12 edge pieces and 8 corner pieces; each twist rotates one face centre piece and moves the four edge and four corner pieces that surround it. However, the difference between the two puzzles is their purpose: on a standard Rubik's Cube, the aim is to arrange the puzzle in such a way that every face has only ''one colour''; on the Nine-Colour Cube, the goal is opposite: to arrange it so that every face contains ''all nine colours exactly once''.<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\nThe [[Sudoku Cube]] is similar to the Nine-Colour Cube in that the objective of the Sudoku Cube is to arrange it such that each face contains each ''number'' (1 to 9) exactly once.\n\n===Structure===\nThere are a total of 26 pieces (called cubies) on the puzzle. Out of the nine colours, one colour (green in the picture) only appears on 2 cubies; both of these are corner pieces. The remaining eight colours all appear on 3 cubies each; two of those (red and purple in the picture) appear on three edge pieces, while the other six are on one corner, one edge and one face centre each.<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThe puzzle has eight corner pieces, which can be permutated in 8! different ways, and twelve edge pieces, which can be permutated in 12! ways. The position of the face centre pieces is fixed, therefore there is only one possible permutation for the face centres. Since all cubies only consist of one colour (unlike on the Rubik's Cube), they have no visible orientation and therefore this is not taken into account. The exact number of combinations is not yet reached because of several constraints:\n* There is one pair of corner pieces with the same colour; these pieces can be swapped with each other without changing the configuration. This divides the limit by 2!.\n* Similarly, there are two triplets of edge pieces with the same colours; these pieces can also be swapped with each other, which divides the limit by 3!<sup>2</sup>.\n\nAs some pieces are identical to each other, there is no parity constraint; all of the above positions are attainable.\n\nThe full number is therefore:<ref name=\"Jaap\" />\n\n:<math>\\frac{12! \\times 8!}{2! \\times 3!^{2}} = 268</math> <math>240</math> <math>896</math> <math>000</math>\n\n===Solutions===\nOut of the 268 240 896 000 possible configurations, there are 80 that represent a solved puzzle. These solutions fall into three categories:<ref name=\"Jaap\" /><ref name=\"RedKB\" />\n* The first category consists of the most symmetrical solutions.{{efn|One of these is shown in the picture.}} The corner pieces of the same colour are located at the opposite corners of the cube, while the two edge-only colours form an alternating hexagonal \"ring\" around the cube, equidistant from the two corners.  The three cubies of any of the remaining six colours lie on a diagonal plane that also contains the two similar corners; the colours whose centres are opposite each other lie on the same plane. There are only 8 solutions of this type.\n* The second category is similar to the first one in that the two corners of the same colour are still opposite each other and the two edge-only colours still form the hexagonal \"ring\"; however, this time some edges of the ring are adjacent to the two corners. The colours with opposite centres still lie on the same plane, although the plane may not necessarily align with the two similar corners. There are a total of 24 solutions in this category.\n* The solutions in the third category are the least symmetrical. In this category, the two edge-only colours do not form the \"ring\" around the cube; instead, they form two \"semi-rings\" which are opposite and perpendicular to each other. The colours with opposite centres do not always lie on the same plane and the planes do not always align with the two similar corners. This is the most common type, with a total of 48 solutions.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Sudoku Cube]]\n*[[Skewb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]"

      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}\n[[File:Pyraminx solved.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in its solved state]]\n\nThe '''Pyraminx''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|r|ə|m|ɪ|ŋ|k|s}}) is a regular [[tetrahedron]] puzzle in the style of [[Rubik's Cube]]. It was made and patented by [[Uwe Mèffert]] after the original 3 layered Rubik's Cube by [[Erno Rubik]], and introduced by [[Tomy|Tomy Toys]] of Japan (then the 3rd largest toy company in the world) in 1981.<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles-pyraminx-kokonotsu.htm</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-3.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx in the middle of a twist]]\n\nThe Pyraminx was first conceived by Mèffert in 1970.  He did nothing with his design until 1981 when he first brought it to Hong Kong for production.  Uwe is fond of saying had it not been for Erno Rubik's invention of the cube, his Pyraminx would have never been produced.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe Pyraminx is a puzzle in the shape of a regular tetrahedron, divided into 4 axial pieces, 6 edge pieces, and 4 trivial tips. It can be twisted along its cuts to permute its pieces. The axial pieces are [[octahedron|octahedral]] in shape, although this is not immediately obvious, and can only rotate around the axis they are attached to. The 6 edge pieces can be freely permuted. The trivial tips are so called because they can be twisted independently of all other pieces, making them trivial to place in solved position. Meffert also produces a similar puzzle called the '''Tetraminx''', which is the same as the Pyraminx except that the trivial tips are removed, turning the puzzle into a [[truncated tetrahedron]].\n\n[[File:Pyraminx-4.jpg|frame|right|Scrambled Pyraminx]]\nThe purpose of the Pyraminx is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to their original configuration.\n\nThe 4 trivial tips can be easily rotated to line up with the axial piece which they are respectively attached to; and the axial pieces are also easily rotated so that their colors line up with each other. This leaves only the 6 edge pieces as a real challenge to the puzzle. They can be solved by repeatedly applying two 4-twist sequences, which are mirror-image versions of each other. These sequences permute 3 edge pieces at a time, and change their orientation differently, so that a combination of both sequences is sufficient to solve the puzzle. However, more efficient solutions (requiring a smaller total number of twists) are generally available (see below).\n\nThe twist of any axial piece is independent of the other three, as is the case with the tips. The six edges can be placed in 6!/2 positions and flipped in 2<sup>5</sup> ways, accounting for parity. Multiplying this by the 3<sup>8</sup> factor for the axial pieces gives 75,582,720 possible positions. However, setting the trivial tips to the right positions reduces the possibilities to 933,120, which is also the number of possible patterns on the Tetraminx. Setting the axial pieces as well reduces the figure to only 11,520, making this a rather simple puzzle to solve.\n\n== Optimal solutions ==\n\nThe maximum number of twists required to solve the Pyraminx is 11. There are 933,120 different positions (disregarding the trivial rotation of the tips), a number that is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarizes the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx<ref name=jaap>[https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Pyraminx] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!''n''\n|0||1||2 ||3  ||4   ||5   ||6    ||7     ||8     ||9     ||10  ||11\n|-\n!''p''\n|1||8||48||288||1728||9896||51808||220111||480467||166276||2457||32\n|}\n\n== Records ==\n[[File:Pyraminx, Estonian Open 2011.jpg|thumb|Solving a pyraminx in competition.

They can be split up into two groups.\n\n1) V first- In these methods, two or three edges, and not a side, is solved first, and a set of algorithms, also called LL algs (last layer algs), are given to solve the remaining puzzle.\n\n2) Top first methods- In these methods three edges around a corner are solved first, and the remaining is solved using a set of algorithms.\n\nCommon V first methods-\n\na) Layer by Layer - In this method a face with all edges oriented in the right spot (a.k.a. a layer) is solved and then the remaining puzzle is solved by a single algorithm from a set of 5.\n\nb) L4E- L4E or last 4 edges is very similar to Layer by Layer. The only difference is that TWO edges are solved around three centers, and the rest is done by a set of algorithms.\n\nc) Intuitive L4E- A method similar to the L4E, as the name suggests, in which a lot of visualization is required. The set of algorithms mentioned in the previous method are not memorized. In speedsolving, cases are solved intuitively by anticipating the movement of pieces. This is the most advanced V first method.\n\nCommon top first methods-\n\na) One Flip- This method uses two edges around one centre solved and the third edge flipped. There are a total of six cases after this step, for which algorithms are memorized and executed. The third step involves using a common set of algorithms for ALL top first methods, also called Keyhole last layer, which involves 5 algorithms, four of them being the mirrors of each other.\n\nb) Keyhole- This method uses two edges in the right place around one center, and the third edge does not match any color of the edge i.e. it is not in the right place OR flipped. The centers of the fourth color are then solved using the non oriented edge (a.k.a. keyhole). The last step is solved using Keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nc) OKA- In this method, One edge is oriented around two edges in the wrong place, but one of the edges that is in the wrong place belongs to the block itself. The last edge is found on the bottom layer and a very simple algorithm is executed to get it in the right place, followed by keyhole last layer algorithms.\n\nSome other common top first methods are WO and Nutella.\n\nMany Pyraminx speedsolvers learn several methods, and while observing a case, decide which method best suits that case.<ref name=\"results\">[[World Cube Association]] [https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2010BRAD01?tab=results-by-event&event=pyram - Drew Brads results.]</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n[[File:Tetraminx.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Tetraminx.]]\nThere are several variations of the puzzle. The simplest, '''Tetraminx''', is equivalent to the (3x) Pyraminx but without the tips (see photo).  There also exist \"higher-order\" versions, such as the 4x Master Pyraminx (see photos) and the 5x Professor's Pyraminx.\n\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A basic pattern on a Master Pyraminx]]\n[[File:MasterPyraminx-Solved.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A solved Master Pyraminx]]\nThe '''Master Pyraminx''' has 4 layers and 16 triangles-per-face (compared to 3 layers and 9 triangles-per-face of the original), and is based on the [[Skewb Diamond]] mechanism.  This version has about 2.6817 × 10<sup>15</sup> combinations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full List of Puzzles|url=http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|website=gandreas software|accessdate=2016-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428094549/http://www.gandreas.com/iphone/twisty/page2/page2.html|archive-date=28 April 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Twisty Puzzles|url=http://michael-gottlieb.blogspot.com/2008/05/number-of-positions-of-generalized.html|publisher=Michael Gottlieb|accessdate=2016-12-31}}</ref>  The Master Pyraminx has\n* 4 \"tips\" (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"middle axials\"  (same as the original Pyraminx)\n* 4 \"centers\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 6 \"inner edges\" (similar to Rubik's Cube, none in the original Pyraminx)\n* 12 \"outer edges\" (2-times more than the 6 of the original Pyraminx)\nIn summary, the Master Pyraminx has 30 \"manipulable\" pieces.  However, like the original, 8 of the pieces (the tips and middle axials) are fixed in position (relative to each other) and can only be rotated in place.  Also, the 4 centers are fixed in position and can only rotate (like the Rubik's Cube).  So there are only 18 (30-8-4) \"truly movable\" pieces; since this is 10% ''less'' than the 20 \"truly movable\" pieces of the Rubik's Cube, it should be no surprise that the Master Pyraminx has about 10,000-times ''fewer'' combinations than a Rubik's Cube (about 4.3252 × 10<sup>19</sup><ref>Martin Schönert ''[http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html \"Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP\"]'': the [[permutation group]] of Rubik's Cube is examined with [[GAP computer algebra system]]</ref>).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Pyraminx Duo]]\n*[[Pyramorphix]] and [[Pyramorphix#Master Pyramorphix|Master Pyramorphix]], two regular tetrahedron puzzles which resemble the Pyraminx but are mechanically very different from it\n* [[Pocket Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Rubik's Revenge]]\n* [[Professor's Cube]]\n* [[V-Cube 6]]\n* [[V-Cube 7]]\n* [[V-Cube 8]]\n*[[Skewb]]\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Pyraminx}}\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraminx.htm Jaap's Pyraminx and related puzzles page, with solution]\n*[http://www.puzzlesolver.com/puzzle.php?id=28 Pyraminx solution] from [http://www.puzzlesolver.com/ PuzzleSolver]\n*[ftp://ftp.comlab.ox.ac.uk/pub/Cards/txt/Pyramix.txt A solution to the Pyraminx]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by [[Jonathan Bowen]]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071231043207/http://www.geocities.com/rubiks_galaxia/PyraSol.html An efficient and easy to follow solution favoured by speed solvers]\n*[http://www.randelshofer.ch/rubik/pyraminx Patterns] A collection of pretty patterns for the Pyraminx\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:1980s toys]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

It is manufactured by [[Uwe Mèffert]] and has been sold in his puzzle shop since 2008.\n\nThe puzzle was originally called the Brilic,<ref>http://www.helm.lu/gallery2/main.php?g2_itemId=365</ref> and was first made in 2006 by Aleh Hladzilin,<ref>http://twistypuzzles.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4221</ref> a member of the Twisty Puzzles Forum.\n\nIt is not to be confused with the [[Pyraminx]], which is also invented and sold by Meffert.\n\n== History ==\n\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Pyraminx crystal white star.jpg|thumb|left|200px|White-bodied Pyraminx Crystal with a star pattern applied to the faces.]]\n\nThe Pyraminx Crystal was patented in Europe on July 16, 1987. The patent number is DE8707783U.\n\nIn late 2007, due to requests by puzzle fans worldwide, Uwe Mèffert began manufacturing the puzzle. The puzzles were first shipped in February 2008. There are two 12-color versions, one with the black body commonly used for the Rubik's Cube and its variations, and one with a white body.\n\nThe puzzle company QJ started manufacturing this puzzle in 2010, leading Meffert's Puzzles to file a lawsuit against QJ.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe Pyraminx Crystal ran out of stock fairly quickly, and became a collector's puzzle. In October 2011, a new set was created with some slight improvements to the quality.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Description ==\n\n[[Image:Pyracrys02.jpg|frame|right|Pyraminx Crystal, one face in the middle of a twist]]\n\nThe puzzle consists of a dodecahedron sliced in such a way that the slices meet at the center of each [[pentagon]]al face. This cuts the puzzle into 20 corner pieces and 30 edge pieces, with 50 pieces in total.\n\nEach face consists of five corners and five edges. When a face is turned, these pieces and five additional edges move with it. Each corner is shared by 3 faces, and each edge is shared by 2 faces. By alternately rotating adjacent faces, the pieces may be permuted.\n\nThe goal of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then return it to its original state.\n\n== Solutions ==\n\nThe puzzle is essentially a deeper-cut version of the [[Megaminx]], and the same algorithms used for solving the Megaminx's corners may be used to solve the corners on the Pyraminx Crystal. The edge pieces can then be permuted by a simple 4-twist [[Rubik's Cube#Algorithms|algorithm]], R L' R' L, that leaves the corners untouched, in a manner similar to the [[Pyraminx]]. This can be applied repeatedly until the edges are solved.\n\n== Number of combinations ==\n\nThere are 30 edge pieces with 2 orientations each, and 20 corner pieces with 3 orientations each, giving a maximum of 30!·2<sup>30</sup>·20!·3<sup>20</sup> possible combinations. However, this limit is not reached because:\n# Only even permutations of edges are possible, reducing the possible edge arrangements to 30!/2.\n# The orientation of the last edge is determined by the orientation of the other edges, reducing the number of edge orientations to 2<sup>29</sup>.\n# Only even permutations of corners are possible, reducing the possible corner arrangements to 20!/2.\n# The orientation of the last corner is determined by the orientation of the other corners, reducing the number of corner combinations to 3<sup>19</sup>.\n# The orientation of the puzzle does not matter (since there are no fixed face centers to serve as reference points), dividing the final total by 60. There are 60 possible positions and orientations of the first corner, but all of them are equivalent because of the lack of face centers.\n\nThis gives a total of <math>\\frac{30!\\times 2^{27}\\times 20!\\times 3^{19}}{60} \\approx 1.68\\times 10^{66}</math> possible combinations.\n\nThe full figure is 1 677 826 942 558 722 452 041 933 871 894 091 752 811 468 606 850 329 477 120 000 000 000 (roughly 1.68 unvigintillion on the [[names of large numbers|short scale]] or 1.68 undecillion on the long scale).\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Pyraminx]]\n*[[Combination puzzle]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.calormen.com/TwistyPuzzles/twisty.htm The Magic Polyhedra Patent Page]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"
