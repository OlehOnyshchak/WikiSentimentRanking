      "text": "In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''Davenport chained rotations''' are three chained [[intrinsic]] rotations about body-fixed specific axes. [[Euler's rotation theorem|Euler rotations]] and Tait–Bryan rotations are particular cases of the Davenport general rotation decomposition. The angles of rotation are called Davenport angles because the general problem of decomposing a rotation in a sequence of three was studied first by Paul B. Davenport.<ref>[http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/3.6842?journalCode=aiaaj P. B. Davenport, Rotations about nonorthogonal axes]</ref>\n\nThe non-[[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] rotating coordinate system may be imagined to be rigidly attached to a rigid body. In this case, it is sometimes called a ''local'' coordinate system. Being rotation axes are solidary with the moving body, the generalized rotations can be divided into two groups (here ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' refer to the non-orthogonal moving frame):\n\n* '''generalized Euler rotations''' {{math|(''z-x-z, x-y-x, y-z-y, z-y-z, x-z-x, y-x-y'')}}\n* '''generalized Tait–Bryan rotations''' {{math|(''x-y-z, y-z-x, z-x-y, x-z-y, z-y-x, y-x-z'')}}.\n\nMost of the cases belong to the second group, being the generalized Euler rotations are a degenerated case in which first and third axes are overlapping.\n\n== Davenport rotation theorem ==\n[[File:Davenport theorem axes.svg|thumb|right|Davenport possible axes for steps 1 and 3 given Z as the step 2]]\n\nThe general problem of decomposing a [[rotation]] into three composed movements about intrinsic axes was studied by P. Davenport, under the name \"generalized [[Euler angles]]\", but later these angles were named \"Davenport angles\" by M. Shuster and L. Markley.<ref>M. Shuster and L. Markley, Generalization of Euler angles, Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, Vol. 51, No. 2, April–June 2003, pp. 123–123</ref>\n\nThe general problem consists of obtaining the matrix decomposition of a rotation given the three known axes. In some cases one of the axes is repeated. This problem is equivalent to a decomposition problem of matrices<ref>J. Wittenburg, L. Lilov, Decomposition of a finite rotation in three rotations about given axes [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1023389218547#page-1]</ref>\n\nDavenport proved that any orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations using non-orthogonal axes. The elemental rotations can either occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system ([[#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotations]]) or about the axes of a rotating coordinate system, which is initially aligned with the fixed one and modifies its orientation after each elemental rotation ([[#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotations]]).\n\nAccording to the Davenport theorem, a unique decomposition is possible if and only if the second axis is perpendicular to the other two axes. Therefore, axes 1 and 3 must be in the plane orthogonal to axis 2.<ref>M. Shuster and L. Markley, Generalization of Euler angles, Journal of the Astronautical Sciences, Vol. 51, No. 2, April–June 2003, pp. 123–123</ref>\n\nTherefore, decompositions in Euler chained rotations and Tait–Bryan chained rotations are particular cases of this. The Tait–Bryan case appears when axes 1 and 3 are perpendicular, and the Euler case appears when they are overlapping.\n\n== Complete system of rotations ==\n[[File:PlaneOnRest.svg|thumb|left|Image 2: Airplane resting on a plane]]\n\nA set of Davenport rotations is said to be complete if it is enough to generate any rotation of the space by composition. Speaking in matrix terms, it is complete if it can generate any orthonormal matrix of the space, whose determinant is +1. Due to the non-commutativity of the matrix product, the rotation system must be ordered.\n\nSometimes the order is imposed by the geometry of the underlying problem. For example, when used for vehicles, which have a special axis pointing to the \"forward\" direction, only one of the six possible combinations of rotations is useful. The interesting composition is the one able to control the heading and the elevation of the aircraft with one independent rotation each.\n\nIn the adjacent drawing, the yaw, pitch and roll (YPR) composition allows adjustment of the direction of an aircraft with the two first angles. A different composition like YRP would allow establishing the direction of the wings axis, which is obviously not useful in most cases.\n\n==Tait–Bryan chained rotations==\n[[Image:Yaw Axis Corrected.svg|thumb|left|70|70|Image 1: The [[Aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] of an aircraft]]\n\nTait–Bryan rotations are a special case in which the first and third axes are perpendicular among them. Assuming a [[frame of reference|reference frame]] <''x'',''y'',''z''> with a [[Axes conventions|convention]] as in image 2, and a plane with <yaw, pitch, roll> [[Aircraft principal axes|axes]] like in the image 1, lying horizontal on the plane <x,y> in the beginning, after performing intrinsic rotations Y, P and R in the yaw, pitch and roll axes (in this order) we obtain something similar to image 3.\n\n[[File:Plane with ENU embedded axes.svg|thumb|right|70|70|Image 3: Heading, elevation and bank angles after yaw, pitch and roll rotations (Z-Y’-X’’)]]\n\nIn the beginning :\n\n*the plane roll axis is on axis ''x'' of the reference frame\n*the plane pitch axis is on axis ''y'' of the reference frame\n*the plane yaw axis is on axis ''z'' of the reference frame\n\nThe rotations are applied in order '''yaw, pitch and roll'''. In these conditions, the Heading (angle on the horizontal plane) will be equal to the yaw applied, and the Elevation will be equal to the pitch.\n\nMatrix expressions for the three Tait–Bryan rotations in 3 dimensions are:\n\n:<math>\nR_x(\\phi) = \\mathrm{Roll}(\\phi) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi \\\\\n0 & \\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi\n\\end{bmatrix} \n</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\\\\nR_y(\\theta) = \\mathrm{Pitch}(\\theta) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & 0 & \\sin \\theta \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0  \\\\\n-\\sin \\theta & 0 & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\\\\nR_z(\\psi) = \\mathrm{Yaw}(\\psi) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\psi & -\\sin \\psi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\psi & \\cos \\psi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe matrix of the composed rotations is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} M &= \\mathrm{Roll}(\\phi) \\, \\mathrm{Pitch}(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{Yaw}(\\psi) \\\\\n&= R_x(\\phi) R_y(\\theta) R_z(\\psi).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOf the six possible combinations of yaw, pitch and roll, this combination is the only one in which the heading (direction of the roll axis) is equal to one of the rotations (the yaw), and the elevation (angle of the roll axis with the horizontal plane) is equal to other of the rotations (to the pitch).\n\n==Euler chained rotations==\n[[File:PlaneRestingVertical.svg|thumb|right|Starting position of an aircraft to apply proper Euler angles]]\n\nEuler rotations appear as the special case in which the first and third axes of rotations are overlapping. These Euler rotations are related to the proper Euler angles, which were thought to study the movement of a rigid body such as a planet. The angle to define the direction of the roll axis is normally named \"longitude of the revolution axis\" or \"longitude of the line of nodes\" instead of \"heading\", which makes no sense for a planet.\n\nAnyway, Euler rotations can still be used when speaking about a vehicle, though they will have a weird behavior. As the vertical axis is the origin for the angles, it is named \"inclination\" instead of \"elevation\". As before, describing the attitude of a vehicle, there is an axis considered pointing forward, and therefore only one out of the possible combinations of rotations will be useful.\n\nThe combination depends on how the axis are taken and what the initial position of the plane is. Using the one in the drawing, and combining rotations in such a way that an axis is repeated, only '''roll–pitch–roll''' will allow controlling the longitude and the inclination with one rotation each.\n\nThe three matrices to multiply are:\n\n:<math>\nR_z(\\phi) = \\mathrm{Roll}_1(\\phi) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\phi & -\\sin \\phi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\phi & \\cos \\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nR_y(\\theta) = \\mathrm{Pitch}(\\theta) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\theta & 0 & \\sin \\theta \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0  \\\\\n-\\sin \\theta & 0 & \\cos \\theta\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\nR_z(\\psi) = \\mathrm{Roll}_2(\\psi) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\psi & -\\sin \\psi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\psi & \\cos \\psi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn this convention Roll<sub>1</sub> imposes the \"heading\", Pitch is the \"inclination\" (complementary of the elevation), and Roll<sub>2</sub> imposes the \"tilt\".\n\n==Conversion to extrinsic rotations==\n[[Image:EulerG.png|thumb|300px|A rotation represented by Euler angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'') = (−60°, 30°, 45°), using ''z-x’-z″'' intrinsic rotations]]\n[[Image:EulerX.png|thumb|300px|The same rotation represented by (γ, β, α) = (45°, 30°, −60°), using ''z-x-z'' extrinsic rotations]]\n\nDavenport rotations are usually studied as an intrinsic rotation composition, because of the importance of the axes fixed to a moving body, but they can be converted to an extrinsic rotation composition, in case it could be more intuitive.\n\nAny extrinsic rotation is equivalent to an intrinsic rotation by the same angles but with inverted order of elemental rotations, and vice versa. For instance, the intrinsic rotations ''x-y’-z″'' by angles ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' are equivalent to the extrinsic rotations ''z-y-x'' by angles ''γ'', ''β'', ''α''. Both are represented by a matrix\n\n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nif ''R'' is used to pre-multiply [[column vector]]s, and by a matrix\n:<math>R = Z(\\gamma) Y(\\beta) X(\\alpha) </math>\nif ''R'' is used to post-multiply [[row vector]]s. See [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]] for more details.\n\n== Relationship with physical motions ==\n{{see also|Givens rotation{{!}}Givens rotations|Davenport rotations}}\n\n===Intrinsic rotations===\n\nIntrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the rotating coordinate system ''XYZ'', which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three intrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''. The Euler or Tait-Bryan angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'') are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows:\n\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates  by ''α'' about the ''Z'' axis (which coincides with the ''z'' axis). The ''X'' axis now lies on the line of nodes.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates about the now rotated ''X'' axis by ''β''. The ''Z'' axis is now in its final orientation, and the ''X'' axis remains on the line of nodes.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates a third time about the new ''Z'' axis by ''γ''.\n\nThe above-mentioned [[#Alternative definition|notation]] allows us to summarize this as follows: the three elemental rotations of the XYZ-system occur about ''z'', ''x''’ and ''z''″. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted ''z-x’-z″''. Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait-Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details). Sometimes, the same sequence is simply called ''z-x-z'', ''Z-X-Z'', or ''3-1-3'', but this notation may be ambiguous as it may be identical to that used for extrinsic rotations. In this case, it becomes necessary to separately specify whether the rotations are intrinsic or extrinsic.\n\n[[Rotation matrix|Rotation matrices]] can be used to represent a sequence of intrinsic rotations. For instance, \n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nrepresents a composition of intrinsic rotations about axes ''x-y’-z″'', if used to pre-multiply [[column vector]]s, while\n:<math>R = Z(\\gamma) Y(\\beta) X(\\alpha) </math>\nrepresents exactly the same composition when used to post-multiply [[row vector]]s. See [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]] for more details.\n\n===Extrinsic rotations===\n\nExtrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system ''xyz''. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three extrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''. The Euler or Tait-Bryan angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'') are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows:\n\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates about the ''z'' axis by ''α''. The ''X'' axis is now at angle ''α'' with respect to the ''x'' axis.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates again about the ''x'' axis by ''β''. The ''Z'' axis is now at angle β with respect to the ''z'' axis.\n*The ''XYZ'' system rotates a third time about the ''z'' axis by ''γ''.\n\nIn sum, the three elemental rotations occur about ''z'', ''x'' and ''z''. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted ''z-x-z'' (or 3-1-3). Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait–Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details).\n\n[[Rotation matrix|Rotation matrices]] can be used to represent a sequence of extrinsic rotations. For instance, \n:<math>R = Z(\\gamma) Y(\\beta) X(\\alpha) </math>\nrepresents a composition of extrinsic rotations about axes ''x-y-z'', if used to pre-multiply [[column vector]]s, while\n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nrepresents exactly the same composition when used to post-multiply [[row vector]]s. See [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]] for more details.\n\n===Conversion between intrinsic and extrinsic rotations===\n[[Image:EulerG.png|thumb|300px|A rotation represented by Euler angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'') = (−60°, 30°, 45°), using ''z-x’-z″'' intrinsic rotations]]\n[[Image:EulerX.png|thumb|300px|The same rotation represented by (γ, β, α) = (45°, 30°, −60°), using ''z-x-z'' extrinsic rotations]]\n\nAny extrinsic rotation is equivalent to an intrinsic rotation by the same angles but with inverted order of elemental rotations, and vice versa. For instance, the intrinsic rotations ''x-y’-z″'' by angles ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' are equivalent to the extrinsic rotations ''z-y-x'' by angles ''γ'', ''β'', ''α''. Both are represented by a matrix\n\n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nif ''R'' is used to pre-multiply [[column vector]]s, and by a matrix\n:<math>R = Z(\\gamma) Y(\\beta) X(\\alpha) </math>\nif ''R'' is used to post-multiply [[row vector]]s. See [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]] for more details.\n\n==== The proof of the conversion in the pre-multiply case ====\nThe rotation matrix of the intrinsic rotation sequence ''x-y’-z″'' can be obtained by the sequential intrinsic element rotations from the right to the left:\n\n<math>R=Z''Y'X.</math>\n\nIn this process there are three frames related in the intrinsic rotation sequence. Let's denote the frame 0 as the initial frame, the frame 1 after the first rotation around the ''x axis'', the frame 2 after the second rotation around the ''y’'' axis and the frame 3 as the third rotation around ''z″''  axis.\n\nSince a rotation matrix can be represented among these three frames, let's use the left shoulder index to denote the representation frame. The following notation means the rotation matrix that transforms the frame ''a'' to the frame ''b'' and that is represented in the frame ''c'' :\n\n<math>{}^c\\!R_{a \\rightarrow b}.</math>\n\nAn intrinsic element rotation matrix represented in that frame where the rotation happens has the same value as that of the corresponding extrinsic element rotation matrix:\n\n<math>{}^0\\!R_{1\\rightarrow0}=X, \\quad {}^1\\!R_{2\\rightarrow1}=Y, \\quad {}^2\\!R_{3\\rightarrow2}=Z.</math>\n\nThe intrinsic element rotation matrix ''Y’'' and ''Z″''  represented in the frame 0 can be expressed as other forms:\n\n<math>\\begin{align} Y' & ={}^0\\!R_{2\\rightarrow1} \\\\\n& ={}^0\\!R_{1\\rightarrow0}{}^1\\!R_{2\\rightarrow1}{}^0\\!R_{1\\rightarrow0}^{-1} \\\\\n& =XYX^{-1} \\\\ \\end{align}</math>\n\n<math>\\begin{align} Z'' & ={}^0\\!R_{3\\rightarrow2} \\\\\n& ={}^0\\!R_{1\\rightarrow0}{}^1\\!R_{3\\rightarrow2}{}^0\\!R_{1\\rightarrow0}^{-1} \\\\\n& =X({}^1\\!R_{2\\rightarrow1}{}^2\\!R_{3\\rightarrow2}{}^1\\!R_{2\\rightarrow1}^{-1})X^{-1} \\\\\n& =XYZY^{-1}X^{-1} \\\\ \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe two equations above are substituted to the first equation:\n\n<math>\\begin{align} R & =Z''Y'X \\\\\n& = (XYZY^{-1}X^{-1})(XYX^{-1})X \\\\\n& = XYZY^{-1}(X^{-1}X)Y(X^{-1}X) \\\\\n& = XYZ(Y^{-1}Y) \\\\\n& = XYZ \\\\ \\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, the rotation matrix of an intrinsic element rotation sequence is the same as that of the inverse extrinsic element rotation sequence:\n\n<math> R = Z''Y'X = XYZ.</math>\n\n\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Matrix decomposition]]\n*[[Givens rotation]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]\n[[Category:Euclidean symmetries]]\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Aerodynamics]]"

      "text": "{{About|the Euler angles used in [[mathematics]]|the use of the term in [[physics]] and [[aerospace engineering]]|rigid body dynamics|chained rotations|chained rotations}}\n\nThe '''Euler angles''' are three angles introduced by [[Leonhard Euler]] to describe the [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of a [[rigid body]] with respect to a fixed [[coordinate system]].<ref name=\"Euler\">Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 20, 1776, pp. 189–207 (E478) [https://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E478.pdf PDF]</ref> They can also represent the orientation of a mobile [[frame of reference]] in physics or the orientation of a general [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in [[dimension|3-dimensional]] linear algebra.\n\nAny orientation can be achieved by composing three ''[[elemental rotation]]s'', i.e., rotations about the axes of a [[coordinate system]]. Euler angles can be defined by three of these rotations. They can also be defined by elemental [[geometry]] and the geometrical definition demonstrates that three rotations are always sufficient to reach any frame.\n\nThe three elemental rotations may be [[#Definition by extrinsic rotations|extrinsic]] (rotations about the axes ''xyz'' of the original coordinate system, which is assumed to remain motionless), or [[#Definition by intrinsic rotations|intrinsic]] (rotations about the axes of the rotating coordinate system ''XYZ'', solidary with the moving body, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation).\n\nEuler angles are typically denoted as [[Alpha|''&alpha;'']], [[Beta|''&beta;'']], [[Gamma|''&gamma;'']], or [[Phi|''&phi;'']], [[Theta|''&theta;'']], [[Psi (letter)|''&psi;'']]. Different authors may use different sets of rotation axes to define Euler angles, or different names for the same angles. Therefore, any discussion employing Euler angles should always be preceded by their definition.\n\nWithout considering the possibility of using two different conventions for the definition of the rotation axes (intrinsic or extrinsic), there exist twelve possible sequences of rotation axes, divided in two groups:\n\n* '''Proper Euler angles''' {{math|(''z''-''x''-''z'', ''x''-''y''-''x'', ''y''-''z''-''y'', ''z''-''y''-''z'', ''x''-''z''-''x'', ''y''-''x''-''y'')}}\n* '''Tait–Bryan angles''' {{math|(''x''-''y''-''z'', ''y''-''z''-''x'', ''z''-''x''-''y'', ''x''-''z''-''y'', ''z''-''y''-''x'', ''y''-''x''-''z'')}}.\n\nTait–Bryan angles are also called '''Cardan angles'''; '''nautical angles'''; '''[[heading (navigation)|heading]], elevation, and bank'''; or '''yaw, pitch, and roll'''. Sometimes, both kinds of sequences are called \"Euler angles\". In that case, the sequences of the first group are called ''proper'' or ''classic'' Euler angles.\n\n==Proper Euler angles==\n[[Image:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|300px|Proper Euler angles geometrical definition. The ''xyz'' (fixed) system is shown in blue, the ''XYZ'' (rotated) system is shown in red. The [[line of nodes]] (''N'') is shown in green]]\n\n===Geometrical definition===\nThe axes of the original frame are denoted as ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' and the axes of the rotated frame as ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z''. The '''geometrical definition''' (sometimes referred to as static) begins by defining the [[line of nodes]] as the intersection of the planes ''xy'' and ''XY'' (it can also be defined as the common perpendicular to the axes ''z'' and ''Z'' and then written as the vector product ''N'' = ''z'' <math>\\times</math> ''Z''). Using it, the three Euler angles can be defined as follows:\n\n* <math>\\alpha</math> (or <math>\\varphi</math>) is the angle between the ''x'' axis and the ''N'' axis (''x''-convention - it could also be defined between ''y'' and ''N'', called ''y''-convention).\n* <math>\\beta</math> (or <math>\\theta\\,</math>) is the angle between the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis.\n* <math>\\gamma</math> (or <math>\\psi</math>) is the angle between the ''N'' axis and the ''X'' axis (''x''-convention).\n\nEuler angles between two reference frames are defined only if both frames have the same [[Orientation (mathematics)|handedness]].\n\n===Definition by intrinsic rotations===\n\nIntrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of a coordinate system ''XYZ'' attached to a moving body. Therefore, they change their orientation after each elemental rotation. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three intrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''.\n\nEuler angles can be defined by intrinsic rotations. The rotated frame ''XYZ'' may be imagined to be initially aligned with ''xyz'', before undergoing the three elemental rotations represented by Euler angles. Its successive orientations may be denoted as follows:\n\n* ''x''-''y''-''z'', or ''x''<sub>0</sub>-''y''<sub>0</sub>-''z''<sub>0</sub> (initial)\n* ''x''′-''y''′-''z''′, or ''x''<sub>1</sub>-''y''<sub>1</sub>-''z''<sub>1</sub> (after first rotation)\n* ''x''″-''y''″-''z''″, or ''x''<sub>2</sub>-''y''<sub>2</sub>-''z''<sub>2</sub> (after second rotation)\n* ''X''-''Y''-''Z'', or ''x''<sub>3</sub>-''y''<sub>3</sub>-''z''<sub>3</sub> (final)\n\nFor the above-listed sequence of rotations, the [[line of nodes]] ''N'' can be simply defined as the orientation of ''X'' after the first elemental rotation. Hence, ''N'' can be simply denoted ''x''′. Moreover, since the third elemental rotation occurs about ''Z'', it does not change the orientation of ''Z''. Hence ''Z'' coincides with ''z''″. This allows us to simplify the definition of the Euler angles as follows:\n\n* ''α'' (or <math>\\varphi</math>) represents a rotation around the ''z'' axis,\n* ''β'' (or <math>\\theta</math>) represents a rotation around the ''x''′ axis, \n* ''γ'' (or <math>\\psi</math>) represents a rotation around the ''z''″ axis.\n\n===Definition by extrinsic rotations===\nExtrinsic rotations are elemental rotations that occur about the axes of the fixed coordinate system ''xyz''. The ''XYZ'' system rotates, while ''xyz'' is fixed. Starting with ''XYZ'' overlapping ''xyz'', a composition of three extrinsic rotations can be used to reach any target orientation for ''XYZ''. The Euler or Tait–Bryan angles (''α'', ''β'', ''γ'') are the amplitudes of these elemental rotations. For instance, the target orientation can be reached as follows:\n\n* The ''XYZ'' system rotates about the ''z'' axis by ''γ''. The ''X'' axis is now at angle ''γ'' with respect to the ''x'' axis.\n* The ''XYZ'' system rotates again about the ''x'' axis by ''β''. The ''Z'' axis is now at angle ''β'' with respect to the ''z'' axis.\n* The ''XYZ'' system rotates a third time about the ''z'' axis by ''α''.\n\nIn sum, the three elemental rotations occur about ''z'', ''x'' and ''z''. Indeed, this sequence is often denoted ''z''-''x''-''z'' (or 3-1-3). Sets of rotation axes associated with both proper Euler angles and Tait–Bryan angles are commonly named using this notation (see above for details).\n\n===Conventions===\nThere are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for proper Euler angles. In all of them, the first and third rotation axes are the same. The six possible sequences are:\n\n# ''z''<sub>1</sub>-''x''′-''z''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''z''<sub>2</sub>-''x''-''z''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''x''<sub>1</sub>-''y''′-''x''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''x''<sub>2</sub>-''y''-''x''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''y''<sub>1</sub>-''z''′-''y''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''y''<sub>2</sub>-''z''-''y''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''z''<sub>1</sub>-''y''′-''z''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''z''<sub>2</sub>-''y''-''z''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''x''<sub>1</sub>-''z''′-''x''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''x''<sub>2</sub>-''z''-''x''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n# ''y''<sub>1</sub>-''x''′-''y''<sub>2</sub>″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''y''<sub>2</sub>-''x''-''y''<sub>1</sub> (extrinsic rotations)\n\n===Signs and ranges===\nAngles are commonly defined according to the [[right-hand rule]]. Namely, they have positive values when they represent a rotation that appears clockwise when looking in the positive direction of the axis, and negative values when the rotation appears counter-clockwise. The opposite convention (left hand rule) is less frequently adopted.\n\nAbout the ranges (using [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|interval notation]]):\n\n* for ''α'' and ''γ'', the range is defined [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2π [[radian]]s. For instance, a valid range could be {{closed-closed|&minus;π, π}}.\n* for ''β'', the range covers π radians (but can't be said to be modulo π). For example, it could be {{closed-closed|0, π}} or {{closed-closed|&minus;π/2, π/2}}.\n\nThe angles ''α'', ''β'' and ''γ'' are uniquely determined except for the singular case that the ''xy'' and the ''XY'' planes are identical, i.e. when the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis have the same or opposite directions. Indeed, if the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis are the same, ''β''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and only (''α''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''γ'') is uniquely defined (not the individual values), and, similarly, if the ''z'' axis and the ''Z'' axis are opposite, ''β''&nbsp;=&nbsp;π and only (''α''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''γ'') is uniquely defined (not the individual values). These ambiguities are known as [[gimbal lock]] in applications.\n\n===Precession, nutation and intrinsic rotation===\n[[Image:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|left|Euler basic motions of the Earth. Intrinsic (green), Precession (blue) and Nutation (red)]]\n\n[[Precession]], [[nutation]], and [[rotation|intrinsic rotation]] (spin) are defined as the movements obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. These motions are not expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a '''mixed axes of rotation''' system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis ''z'', the second rotates around the line of nodes ''N'' and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around ''Z'', an axis fixed in the body that moves.\n\n{{multiple image\n  | image1    = gimbaleuler.svg\n  | width1    = 180\n  | image2    = gimbaleuler2.svg\n  | width2    = 160\n  | footer    = '''Left:''' A [[gimbal]] set, showing a ''z''-''x''-''z'' rotation sequence.

'''Right:''' A simple diagram showing similar Euler angles in a diagram.\n}}\n\nThe static definition implies that:\n\n* ''α'' (precession) represents a rotation around the ''z'' axis,\n* ''β'' (nutation) represents a rotation around the ''N'' or x′ axis, \n* ''γ'' (intrinsic rotation) represents a rotation around the ''Z'' or z″ axis.\n\nIf ''β'' is zero, there is no rotation about ''N''. As a consequence, ''Z'' coincides with ''z'', ''α'' and ''γ'' represent rotations about the same axis (''z''), and the final orientation can be obtained with a single rotation about ''z'', by an angle equal to {{nowrap|''α'' + ''γ''}}.\n\nAs an example, consider a [[top]]. The top spins around its own axis of symmetry; this corresponds to its intrinsic rotation. It also rotates around its pivotal axis, with its center of mass orbiting the pivotal axis; this rotation is a precession. Finally, the top can wobble up and down; the inclination angle is the nutation angle. The same example can be seen with the movements of the earth.\n\nThough all three movements can be represented by a rotation operator with constant coefficients in some frame, they cannot be represented by these operators all at the same time. Given a reference frame, at most one of them will be coefficient-free. Only precession can be expressed in general as a matrix in the basis of the space without dependencies of the other angles.\n\nThese movements also behave as a gimbal set. If we suppose a set of frames, able to move each with respect to the former according to just one angle, like a gimbal, there will exist an external fixed frame, one final frame and two frames in the middle, which are called \"intermediate frames\". The two in the middle work as two gimbal rings that allow the last frame to reach any orientation in space.\n\n==Tait–Bryan angles==\n{{see also|Aircraft principal axes}}\n[[Image:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|left|200px|Tait–Bryan angles. ''z''-''y''′-''x''″ sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''y’''). The angle rotation sequence is ''ψ'', ''θ'', ''Ф''. Note that in this case {{nowrap|''ψ'' > 90°}} and ''θ'' is a negative angle.]]\n\nThe second type of formalism is called '''Tait–Bryan angles''', after [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] and [[George H. Bryan]]. It is the convention normally used for aerospace applications, so that zero degrees elevation represents the horizontal attitude. Tait–Bryan angles represent the orientation of the aircraft with respect to the world frame. When dealing with other vehicles, different [[axes conventions]] are possible.\n\n===Definitions===\n[[Image:taitbrianangles.svg|thumb|right|325px|Tait–Bryan angles. ''z''-''x''′-''y''″ sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''x''′)]]\nThe definitions and notations used for Tait–Bryan angles are similar to those described above for proper Euler angles ([[#Geometrical definition|geometrical definition]], [[#Definition by intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotation definition]], [[#Definition by extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotation definition]]). The only difference is that Tait–Bryan angles represent rotations about three distinct axes (e.g. ''x''-''y''-''z'', or ''x''-''y''′-''z''″), while proper Euler angles use the same axis for both the first and third elemental rotations (e.g., ''z''-''x''-''z'', or ''z''-''x''′-''z''″).\n\nThis implies a different definition for the [[line of nodes]] in the geometrical construction. In the proper Euler angles case it was defined as the intersection between two homologous Cartesian planes (parallel when Euler angles are zero; e.g. ''xy'' and ''XY''). In the second one, it is defined as the intersection of two non-homologous planes (perpendicular when Euler angles are zero; e.g. ''xy'' and ''YZ'').\n\n===Conventions===\n[[File:Plane with ENU embedded axes.svg|thumb|left|100|100|Heading, elevation and bank angles (''Z''-''Y''′-''X''″) for an aircraft using onboard ENU axes both onboard and for the ground tracking station.

This figure doesn't respect the RHS rules: the ''Z''-axis must be turned upside down]]\n\nThe three elemental rotations may occur either about the axes of the original coordinate system, which remains motionless ([[#Extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotations]]), or about the axes of the rotating coordinate system, which changes its orientation after each elemental rotation ([[#Intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotations]]).\n\nThere are six possibilities of choosing the rotation axes for Tait–Bryan angles. The six possible sequences are:\n\n* ''x''-''y''′-''z''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''z''-''y''-''x'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''y''-''z''′-''x''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''x''-''z''-''y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''z''-''x'''-''y''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''y''-''x''-''z'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''x''-''z''′-''y''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''y''-''z''-''x'' (extrinsic rotations)\n* ''z''-''y''′-''x''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''x''-''y''-''z'' (extrinsic rotations): the intrinsic rotations are known as: yaw, pitch and roll\n* ''y''-''x''′-''z''″ (intrinsic rotations) or ''z''-''x''-''y'' (extrinsic rotations)\n\n===Signs and ranges===\n[[Image:Yaw Axis Corrected.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] of an aircraft according to the air norm [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] 9300. Notice that fixed and mobile frames must be coincident with angles zero. Therefore, this norm would force also a compatible [[Axes conventions|axes convention]] in the reference system]]\nTait–Bryan convention is widely used in engineering with different purposes. There are several [[axes conventions]] in practice for choosing the mobile and fixed axes, and these conventions determine the signs of the angles. Therefore, signs must be studied in each case carefully.\n\nThe range for the angles ''&psi;'' and ''&phi;'' covers 2&pi; radians. For ''&theta;'' the range covers &pi; radians.\n\n===Alternative names===\nThese angles are normally taken as one in the external reference frame ([[Heading (navigation)|heading]], [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]]), one in the intrinsic moving frame ([[Banked turn|bank]]) and one in a middle frame, representing an [[Elevation (ballistics)|elevation]] or inclination respect the horizontal plane, which is equivalent to the line of nodes for this purpose.\n\nFor an aircraft, they can be obtained with three rotations around its [[aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] if done in the proper order. A [[Yaw (rotation)|yaw]] will obtain the bearing, a [[Pitching moment|pitch]] will yield the elevation and a roll gives the bank angle. Therefore, in aerospace they are sometimes called '''yaw, pitch and roll'''. Notice that this will not work if the rotations are applied in any other order or if the airplane axes start in any position non-equivalent to the reference frame.\n\nTait–Bryan angles, following ''z''-''y''′-''x''″ (intrinsic rotations) convention, are also known as '''nautical angles''', because they can be used to describe the orientation of a ship or aircraft, or '''Cardan angles''', after the Italian mathematician and physicist [[Gerolamo Cardano]], who first described in detail the [[Cardan suspension]] and the [[Cardan joint]].\n\n==Angles of a given frame==\n[[Image:EulerProjections.svg|right|thumb|200px|Projections of ''Z'' vector]]\n[[Image:EulerProjections2.svg|right|thumb|200px|Projections of ''Y'' vector]]\nA common problem is to find the Euler angles of a given frame. The fastest way to get them is to write the three given vectors as columns of a matrix and compare it with the expression of the theoretical matrix (see later table of matrices). Hence the three Euler Angles can be calculated. Nevertheless, the same result can be reached avoiding matrix algebra and using only elemental geometry. Here we present the results for the two most commonly used conventions: ''ZXZ'' for proper Euler angles and ''ZYX'' for Tait–Bryan. Notice that any other convention can be obtained just changing  the name of the axes.\n\n===Proper Euler angles===\nAssuming a frame with [[unit vector]]s (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') given by their coordinates as in the main diagram, it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\cos (\\beta) = Z_3.</math>\n\nAnd, since \n:<math>\\sin^2 x = 1 - \\cos^2 x,</math>\nwe have\n:<math>\\sin (\\beta) = \\sqrt {1 - Z_3^2}.</math>\n\nAs <math>Z_2</math> is the double projection of a unitary vector,\n:<math>\\cos(\\alpha) \\cdot \\sin(\\beta) = -Z_2,</math>\n:<math>\\cos(\\alpha) = -Z_2 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}.</math>\n\nThere is a similar construction for <math>Y_3</math>, projecting it first over the plane defined by the axis ''z'' and the line of nodes. As the angle between the planes is <math>\\pi/2 - \\beta</math> and <math>\\cos(\\pi/2 - \\beta) = \\sin(\\beta)</math>, this leads to:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\beta) \\cdot \\cos(\\gamma) = Y_3,</math>\n:<math>\\cos(\\gamma) = Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2},</math>\n\nand finally, using the [[inverse trigonometric functions|inverse cosine]] function,\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\arccos(-Z_2 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}),</math>\n:<math>\\beta = \\arccos(Z_3),</math>\n:<math>\\gamma = \\arccos(Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - Z_3^2}).</math>\n\n===Tait–Bryan angles===\n[[File:Projections_of_Tait-Bryan_angles.svg|thumb|right|projections of X axis after three Tait–Bryan rotations. Notice that theta is a negative rotation around the axis ''y''′.]]\n\nAssuming a frame with [[unit vector]]s (''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'') given by their coordinates as in this new diagram (notice that the angle theta is negative), it can be seen that:\n\n:<math>\\sin (\\theta) = -X_3</math>\n\nAs before,\n:<math>\\cos^2 x = 1 - \\sin^2 x,</math>\nwe have\n:<math>\\cos (\\theta) = \\sqrt {1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n\nin a way analogous to the former one:\n\n:<math>\\sin(\\psi) = X_2 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n:<math>\\sin(\\phi) = Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}.</math>\n\nLooking for similar expressions to the former ones:\n\n:<math>\\psi = \\arcsin(X_2 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}),</math>\n:<math>\\theta = \\arcsin(-X_3),</math>\n:<math>\\phi = \\arcsin(Y_3 / \\sqrt{1 - X_3^2}).</math>\n\n===Last remarks===\nNote that the inverse sine and cosine functions yield two possible values for the argument. In this geometrical description only one of the solutions is valid. When Euler Angles are defined as a sequence of rotations, all the solutions can be valid, but there will be only one inside the angle ranges. This is because the sequence of rotations to reach the target frame is not unique if the ranges are not previously defined.<ref>[http://www.gregslabaugh.net/publications/euler.pdf Gregory G. Slabaugh, Computing Euler angles from a rotation matrix]</ref>\n\nFor computational purposes, it may be useful to represent the angles using {{nowrap|[[atan2]](''y'', ''x'')}}. For example, in the case of proper Euler angles:\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\operatorname{atan2}(Z_1 , -Z_2),</math>\n:<math>\\gamma = \\operatorname{atan2}(X_3 , Y_3).</math>\n\n==Conversion to other orientation representations==\n{{Main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions#Conversion formulae between formalisms}}\n\nEuler angles are one way to represent orientations. There are others, and it is possible to change to and from other conventions. Three parameters are always required to describe orientations in a [[dimension|3-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]]. They can be given in several ways, Euler angles being one of them; see [[charts on SO(3)]] for others.\n\nThe most used orientation representation are the [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]], the [[axis-angle]] and the [[quaternion]]s, also known as [[Euler–Rodrigues parameters]], which provide [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|another mechanism]] for representing 3D rotations. This is equivalent to the special unitary group description.\n\nExpressing rotations in 3D as unit quaternions instead of matrices has some advantages:\n\n* Concatenating rotations is computationally faster and numerically more stable.\n* Extracting the angle and axis of rotation is simpler.\n* Interpolation is more straightforward. See for example [[slerp]].\n* Quaternions do not suffer from [[gimbal lock]] as Euler angles do.\n\nRegardless, the rotation matrix calculation is the first step for obtaining the other two representations.\n\n===Rotation matrix===\nAny orientation can be achieved by composing three elemental rotations, starting from a known standard orientation. Equivalently, any [[rotation matrix]] ''R'' can be [[Matrix decomposition|decomposed]] as a product of three elemental rotation matrices. For instance:\n\n:<math>R = X(\\alpha) Y(\\beta) Z(\\gamma)</math>\nis a rotation matrix that may be used to represent a composition of [[Euler angles#Definition by extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotations]] about axes ''z'', ''y'', ''x'', (in that order), or a composition of [[Euler angles#Definition by intrinsic rotations|intrinsic rotations]] about axes ''x''-''y''′-''z''″ (in that order). However, both the definition of the elemental rotation matrices ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', and their multiplication order depend on the choices taken by the user about the definition of both rotation matrices and Euler angles (see, for instance, [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]]). Unfortunately, different sets of conventions are adopted by users in different contexts. The following table was built according to this set of conventions:\n\n# Each matrix is meant to operate by pre-multiplying [[column vector]]s <math display=\"inline\">\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}</math> (see [[Rotation matrix#Ambiguities|Ambiguities in the definition of rotation matrices]])\n# Each matrix is meant to represent an [[Active and passive transformation|active rotation]] (the composing and composed matrices are supposed to act on the coordinates of vectors defined in the initial fixed reference frame and give as a result the coordinates of a rotated vector defined in the same reference frame).\n# Each matrix is meant to represent primary the composition of [[extrinsic rotations]] (which corresponds to the constructive evaluation of the R matrix by the multiplication of three truly elemental matrices), and secondary the composition of three non elemental matrices representing globally an [[intrinsic rotations]] (around the axes of the rotating reference frame, in inverse order).\n# [[Right hand rule|Right handed]] reference frames are adopted, and the [[right hand rule]] is used to determine the sign of the angles ''α'', ''β'', ''γ''.\nFor the sake of simplicity, the following table uses the following nomenclature:\n# 1, 2, 3 represent the angles ''α'', ''β'' and ''γ'', i.e. the angles corresponding to the first, second and third elemental rotations respectively.\n# ''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'' are the matrices representing the elemental rotations about the axes ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' of the fixed frame (e.g., ''X''<sub>1</sub> represents a rotation about ''x'' by an angle ''α'').\n# ''s'' and ''c'' represent sine and cosine (e.g., ''s''<sub>1</sub> represents the sine of ''α'').\n# Each matrix is denoted by the formula used to calculate it.

The chart is smooth except for a polar coordinate style singularity along {{Nowrap|1=''β'' = 0}}. See [[charts on SO(3)]] for a more complete treatment.\n\nThe space of rotations is called in general \"The [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Quaternion rotation operations|Hypersphere of rotations]]\", though this is a misnomer: the group [[Spin group|Spin(3)]] is [[isometric embedding|isometric]] to the hypersphere ''S''<sup>3</sup>, but the rotation space SO(3) is instead isometric to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>3</sup> which is a 2-fold [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient space]] of the hypersphere. This 2-to-1 ambiguity is the mathematical origin of [[Spin (physics)|spin in physics]].\n\nA similar three angle decomposition applies to [[SU(2)]], the [[special unitary group]] of rotations in complex 2D space, with the difference that ''β'' ranges from 0 to 2π. These are also called Euler angles.\n\nThe [[Haar measure]] for SO(3) in Euler angles is given by the Hopf angle parametrisation of SO(3), <math>\\textrm{d}V \\propto \\sin \\alpha . \\textrm{d}\\alpha . \\textrm{d}\\beta . \\textrm{d}\\gamma</math>,<ref>Section 8 - Derivation of Hopf parametrisation : [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896220/ Generating Uniform Incremental Grids on SO(3) Using the Hopf Fibration] &nbsp;.</ref> where <math>(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> parametrise <math>S^{2}</math>, the space of rotation axes.\n\nFor example, to generate uniformly randomized orientations, let ''α'' and ''γ'' be uniform from 0 to 2π, let ''z'' be uniform from &minus;1 to 1, and let {{nowrap|1=''β'' = arccos(''z'')}}.\n\n===Geometric algebra===\nOther properties of Euler angles and rotations in general can be found from the [[Geometric algebra]](GA). GA is a higher level abstraction, in which the quaternions are an even subalgebra. The principal tool in GA is the rotor <math> \\mathbf{\\R} = [ \\cos(\\theta / 2) - I u \\sin(\\theta / 2) ] </math> where <math>\\mathbf\\theta =</math>[[angle of rotation]], <math>\\mathbf(u) =</math>rotation axis (unitary vector) and <math>\\mathbf(I)=</math>pseudoscalar (trivector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math>)\n\n===Higher dimensions===\nIt is possible to define parameters analogous to the Euler angles in dimensions higher than three.<ref>{{it icon}} [http://ansi.altervista.org A generalization of Euler Angles to ''n''-dimensional real spaces]</ref>\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom of a rotation matrix is always less than the dimension of the matrix squared. That is, the elements of a rotation matrix are not all completely independent. For example, the rotation matrix in dimension 2 has only one degree of freedom, since all four of its elements depend on a single angle of rotation. A rotation matrix in dimension 3 (which has nine elements) has three degrees of freedom, corresponding to each independent rotation, for example by its three Euler angles or a magnitude one (unit) quaternion.\n\nIn [[SO(4)]] the rotation matrix [[Rotation (mathematics)#In four dimensions|is defined by two quaternions]], and is therefore 6-parametric (three degrees of freedom for every quaternion). The {{gaps|4|×|4}} rotation matrices have therefore 6 out of 16 independent components.\n\nAny set of 6 parameters that define the rotation matrix could be considered an extension of Euler angles to dimension 4.\n\nIn general, the number of euler angles in dimension D is quadratic in D; since any one rotation consists of choosing two dimensions to rotate between, the total number of rotations available in dimension <math>D</math> is <math>N_{rot}=\\binom{D}{2}=D(D-1)/2</math>, which for <math>D=2,3,4</math> yields <math>N_{rot}=1,3,6</math>.\n\n==Applications==\n[[image:Gyroscope operation.gif|thumb|right|A [[gyroscope]] keeps its rotation axis constant. Therefore, angles measured in this frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame.]]\n\n===Vehicles and moving frames===\n{{Main|rigid body}}\n{{See also|axes conventions}}\n\nTheir main advantage over other orientation descriptions is that they are directly measurable from a gimbal mounted in a vehicle. As gyroscopes keep their rotation axis constant, angles measured in a gyro frame are equivalent to angles measured in the lab frame. Therefore, gyros are used to know the actual orientation of moving spacecraft, and Euler angles are directly measurable. Intrinsic rotation angle cannot be read from a single gimbal, so there has to be more than one gimbal in a spacecraft. Normally there are at least three for redundancy. There is also a relation to the well-known [[gimbal lock]] problem of [[mechanical engineering]] <ref>The relation between the Euler angles and the Cardan suspension is explained in chap. 11.7 of the following textbook: U. Krey, A. Owen, ''Basic Theoretical Physics – A Concise Overview, New York, London, Berlin, Heidelberg, Springer (2007)&nbsp;.</ref>&nbsp;.\n\nWhen studying rigid bodies in general, one calls the ''xyz'' system ''space coordinates'', and the ''XYZ'' system ''body coordinates''. The space coordinates are treated as unmoving, while the body coordinates are considered embedded in the moving body. Calculations involving [[acceleration]], [[angular acceleration]], [[angular velocity]], [[angular momentum]], and [[kinetic energy]] are often easiest in body coordinates, because then the moment of inertia tensor does not change in time.  If one also diagonalizes the rigid body's moment of inertia tensor (with nine components, six of which are independent), then one has a set of coordinates (called the principal axes) in which the moment of inertia tensor has only three components.\n\nThe angular velocity of a rigid body takes a [[Angular velocity#Components from Euler angles|simple form]] using Euler angles in the moving frame. Also the [[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)|Euler's rigid body equations]] are simpler because the inertia tensor is constant in that frame.\n\n===Crystallographic texture===\n[[File:MAUD-MTEX-TiAl-hasylab-2003-Liss.png|thumb|Pole figures displaying crystallographic texture of gamma-TiAl in an alpha2-gamma alloy, as measured by high energy X-rays.<ref name=Liss>{{ cite journal |vauthors=Liss KD, Bartels A, Schreyer A, Clemens H |title=High energy X-rays: A tool for advanced bulk investigations in materials science and physics |journal=Textures Microstruct. |month= |year=2003 |volume=35 |issue=3/4 |pages=219–52 |doi=10.1080/07303300310001634952 }}</ref>]]\nIn materials science, crystallographic [[texture (crystalline)|texture]] (or preferred orientation) can be described using Euler angles.

They are also used in [[Electronic stability control]] in a similar way.\n\nGun fire control systems require corrections to gun-order angles (bearing and elevation) to compensate for deck tilt (pitch and roll). In traditional systems, a stabilizing gyroscope with a vertical spin axis corrects for deck tilt, and stabilizes the optical sights and radar antenna. However, gun barrels point in a direction different from the line of sight to the target, to anticipate target movement and fall of the projectile due to gravity, among other factors. Gun mounts roll and pitch with the deck plane, but also require stabilization. Gun orders include angles computed from the vertical gyro data, and those computations involve Euler angles.\n\nEuler angles are also used extensively in the quantum mechanics of angular momentum. In quantum mechanics, explicit descriptions of the representations of SO(3) are very important for calculations, and almost all the work has been done using Euler angles. In the early history of quantum mechanics, when physicists and chemists had a sharply negative reaction towards abstract group theoretic methods (called the ''Gruppenpest''), reliance on Euler angles was also essential for basic theoretical work.\n\nMany mobile computing devices contain [[accelerometer]]s which can determine these devices' Euler angles with respect to the earth's gravitational attraction.  These are used in applications such as games, [[bubble level]] simulations, and [[kaleidoscope]]s.{{citation needed|reason=accelerometers can measure orientation, yes; is there any evidence they use Euler angles for this?|date=May 2011}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[3D projection]]\n* [[Axis-angle representation]]\n* [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n* [[Euler's rotation theorem]]\n* [[Quaternion]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n* [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n* [[Spherical coordinate system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<!--added under references heading by script-assisted edit-->\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{citation\n |last1= Biedenharn\n |first1= L.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Rodrigues_formula",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]] and [[mechanics]], the '''Euler&ndash;Rodrigues formula''' describes the rotation of a vector in three dimensions. It is based on [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]], but uses a different parametrization.\n\nThe rotation is described by four '''Euler parameters''' due to [[Leonhard Euler]]. The Rodrigues formula (named after [[Olinde Rodrigues]]), a method of calculating the position of a rotated point, is used in some software applications, such as [[flight simulator]]s and [[PC game|computer games]].\n\n== Definition ==\nA rotation about the origin is represented by four real numbers, {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}} such that\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1.</math>\nWhen the rotation is applied, a point at position {{math|{{vec|''x''}}}} rotates to its new position\n:<math>\\vec x' = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2 & 2(bc-ad) & 2(bd + ac) \\\\\n                                       2(bc+ad) & a^2+c^2-b^2-d^2 & 2(cd - ab) \\\\\n                                       2(bd-ac) & 2(cd+ab) & a^2+d^2-b^2-c^2 \\end{pmatrix}\\vec x.</math>\n\n=== Vector formulation ===\nThe parameter {{mvar|a}} may be called the ''scalar'' parameter, while {{math|{{vec|''ω''}} {{=}} (''b, c, d'')}} the ''vector'' parameter. In standard vector notation, the Rodrigues rotation formula takes the compact form\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  \n<math>\\vec x ' = \\vec x + 2a(\\vec \\omega\\times\\vec x) + 2\\left (\\vec \\omega\\times(\\vec \\omega\\times\\vec x)\\right )</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\n\n=== Symmetry ===\nThe parameters {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'')}} and {{math|(−''a'', −''b'', −''c'', −''d'')}} describe the same rotation. Apart from this symmetry, every set of four parameters describes a unique rotation in three-dimensional space.\n\n=== Composition of rotations ===\nThe composition of two rotations is itself a rotation. Let {{math|(''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ''d''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|(''a''<sub>2</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''c''<sub>2</sub>, ''d''<sub>2</sub>)}} be the Euler parameters of two rotations. The parameters for the compound rotation (rotation 2 after rotation 1) are as follows:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na & = a_1a_2 - b_1b_2 - c_1c_2 - d_1d_2; \\\\\nb & = a_1b_2 + b_1a_2 - c_1d_2 + d_1c_2; \\\\\nc & = a_1c_2 + c_1a_2 - d_1b_2 + b_1d_2; \\\\\nd & = a_1d_2 + d_1a_2 - b_1c_2 + c_1b_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is straightforward, though tedious, to check that {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}. (This is essentially [[Euler's four-square identity]], also used by Rodrigues.)\n\n== Rotation angle and rotation axis ==\nAny central rotation in three dimensions is uniquely determined by its axis of rotation (represented by a [[unit vector]] {{math|{{vec|''k''}} {{=}} (''k<sub>x</sub>'', ''k<sub>y</sub>'', ''k<sub>z</sub>'')}}) and the rotation angle {{math|''φ''}}. The Euler parameters for this rotation are calculated as follows:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na & = \\cos \\frac{\\varphi}{2}; \\\\\nb & = k_x \\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2}; \\\\       \nc & = k_y \\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2}; \\\\       \nd & = k_z \\sin \\frac{\\varphi}{2}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nNote that if {{math|''φ''}} is increased by a full rotation of 360 degrees, the arguments of sine and cosine only increase by 180 degrees. The resulting parameters are the opposite of the original values, {{math|(−''a'', −''b'', −''c'', −''d'')}}; they represent the same rotation.\n\nIn particular, the identity transformation (null rotation, {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}}) corresponds to parameter values {{math|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') {{=}} (±1, 0, 0, 0)}}. Rotations of 180 degrees about any axis result in {{math|''a'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\n== Connection with quaternions ==\nThe Euler parameters can be viewed as the coefficients of a [[quaternion]]; the scalar parameter {{mvar|a}} is the real part, the vector parameters {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}} are the imaginary parts.\nThus we have the quaternion\n:<math>q = a + bi + cj + dk,</math>\nwhich is a quaternion of unit length (or [[versor]]) since\n:<math>\\left\\|q\\right\\|^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1.</math>\nMost importantly, the above equations for composition of rotations are precisely the equations for multiplication of quaternions. In other words, the group of unit quaternions with multiplication, modulo the negative sign, is isomorphic to the group of rotations with composition.\n\n== Connection with SU(2) spin matrices ==\nThe [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]] can be used to represent three-dimensional rotations in {{nowrap|2 × 2}} matrices. The SU(2)-matrix corresponding to a rotation, in terms of its Euler parameters, is\n:<math>U = \\begin{pmatrix} \\ \\ \\,a+di & b+ci \\\\ -b+ci & a-di \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nAlternatively, this can be written as the sum\n:<math>\\begin{align}U & = a\\ \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n    + b\\ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    + c\\ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n    + d\\ \\begin{pmatrix} i & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n&   = a\\,I+ic\\,\\sigma_x+ib\\,\\sigma_y+id\\,\\sigma_z,\\end{align}</math>\nwhere the {{mvar|σ<sub>i</sub>}} are the [[Pauli spin matrix|Pauli spin matrices]]. Thus, the Euler parameters are the coefficients for the representation of a three-dimensional rotation in&nbsp;SU(2).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n*[[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n*[[Versor]]\n*[[Spinors in three dimensions]]\n*[[SO(4)]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book | last=Cartan |first=Élie|title=The Theory of Spinors |authorlink=Élie Cartan| publisher=Dover |year=1981 |isbn=0-486-64070-1}}\n*{{cite book | last=Hamilton |first=W.

      "text": "{{about|[[rigid body dynamics]]|other uses|Euler equation{{!}}Euler equations (disambiguation)}}\n{{Classical mechanics|cTopic=Core topics}}\n{{no footnotes|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn [[classical mechanics]], '''Euler's rotation equations''' are a vectorial quasilinear [[first-order ordinary differential equation]] describing the rotation of a [[rigid body]], using a [[rotating reference frame]] with its axes fixed to the body and parallel to the body's [[Moment of inertia|principal axes of inertia]]. Their general form is:\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{I} \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} + \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\left( \\mathbf{I} \\boldsymbol\\omega \\right) = \\mathbf{M}.\n</math>\n\nwhere ''M'' is the applied [[torque]]s, ''I'' is the [[inertia matrix]], and ω is the [[angular velocity]] about the principal axes.\n\nIn three-dimensional principal [[orthogonal coordinates]], they become:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI_1\\dot{\\omega}_{1}+(I_3-I_2)\\omega_2\\omega_3 &= M_{1}\\\\\nI_2\\dot{\\omega}_{2}+(I_1-I_3)\\omega_3\\omega_1 &= M_{2}\\\\\nI_3\\dot{\\omega}_{3}+(I_2-I_1)\\omega_1\\omega_2 &= M_{3}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''M<sub>k</sub>'' are the components of the applied torques, ''I<sub>k</sub>'' are the [[moment of inertia|principal moments of inertia]] and ω<sub>''k''</sub> are the components of the angular velocity about the principal axes.\n\n==Motivation and derivation==\nStarting from [[Newton's second law]], in an [[inertial frame of reference]] (subscripted \"in\"), the [[time derivative]] of the [[angular momentum]] '''L''' equals the applied [[torque]]\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}_{\\text{in}}}{dt} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\mathbf{I}_{\\text{in}} \\boldsymbol\\omega \\right) = \\mathbf{M}_{\\text{in}}\n</math>\n\nwhere '''I'''<sub>in</sub> is the [[moment of inertia]] [[tensor]] calculated in the inertial frame. Although this law is universally true, it is not always helpful in solving for the motion of a general rotating rigid body, since both '''I'''<sub>in</sub> and '''ω''' can change during the motion.\n\nTherefore, we change to a coordinate frame fixed in the rotating body, and chosen so that its axes are aligned with the principal axes of the [[moment of inertia]] tensor.  In this frame, at least the moment of inertia tensor is constant (and diagonal), which simplifies calculations.  As described in the [[moment of inertia]], the angular momentum '''L''' can be written\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{L} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \nL_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1} + L_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2} + L_{3}\\mathbf{e}_{3} = \nI_{1}\\omega_{1}\\mathbf{e}_{1} + I_{2}\\omega_{2}\\mathbf{e}_{2} + I_{3}\\omega_{3}\\mathbf{e}_{3}\n</math>\n\nwhere ''M<sub>k</sub>'', ''I<sub>k</sub>'' and ω<sub>''k''</sub> are as above.\n\nIn a ''rotating'' reference frame, the time derivative must be replaced with (see [[Rotating reference frame#Time derivatives in the two frames|time derivative in rotating reference frame]])\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt}\\right)_\\mathrm{rot}+\n\\boldsymbol\\omega\\times\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{M}\n</math>\n\nwhere the subscript \"rot\" indicates that it is taken in the rotating reference frame. The expressions for the torque in the rotating and inertial frames are related by\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\text{in}} = \\mathbf{Q}\\mathbf{M},\n</math>\n\nwhere '''Q''' is the rotation tensor (not [[rotation matrix]]), an [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal tensor]] related to the angular velocity vector by \n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\boldsymbol{v} = \\dot{\\mathbf{Q}} \\mathbf{Q}^{-1}\\boldsymbol{v}</math> \nfor any vector '''v'''.\n\nIn general, '''L''' = '''Iω''' is substituted and the time derivatives are taken realizing that the inertia tensor, and so also the principal moments, do not depend on time. This leads to the general vector form of Euler's equations\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{I} \\dot{\\boldsymbol\\omega} + \\boldsymbol\\omega \\times \\left( \\mathbf{I} \\boldsymbol\\omega \\right) = \\mathbf{M}.\n</math>\n\nIf principal axis rotation \n:<math>L_{k} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  I_{k}\\omega_{k}</math> \nis substituted, and then taking the cross product and using the fact that the principal moments do not change with time, we arrive at the Euler equations in components at the beginning of the article.\n\n==Torque-free solutions==\nFor the [[left-hand side and right-hand side of an equation|RHS]]s equal to zero there are non-trivial solutions: torque-free [[precession]]. Notice that if '''I''' is constant (because the inertia tensor is the 3×3 [[identity matrix]], because we work in the intrinsic frame, or because the torque is driving the rotation around the same axis <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math> so that '''I''' is not changing) then we may write\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{M} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  I \\frac{d\\omega}{dt}\\mathbf{\\hat{n}} = \nI \\alpha \\, \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:'''α''' is called the [[angular acceleration]] (or ''rotational acceleration'') about the rotation axis <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>.\n\nHowever, if '''I''' is not constant in the external reference frame (i.e. the body is moving and its inertia tensor is not the identity) then we cannot take the '''I''' outside the [[derivative]]. In this case we will have [[torque-free precession]], in such a way that '''I'''(''t'') and '''ω'''(''t'') change together so that their derivative is zero. This motion can be visualized by [[Poinsot's construction]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nIt is also possible to use these equations if the axes in which \n:<math>\\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{L}}{dt}\\right)_\\mathrm{relative}</math> \nis described are not connected to the body. Then '''ω''' should be replaced with the rotation of the axes instead of the rotation of the body. It is, however, still required that the chosen axes are still principal axes of inertia. This form of the Euler equations is useful for rotation-symmetric objects that allow some of the principal axes of rotation to be chosen freely.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Euler angles]]\n* [[Galois axis]]\n* [[Tennis racket theorem|Dzhanibekov effect]]\n* [[MacCullagh ellipsoid]] \n* [[Moment of inertia]]\n* [[Poinsot's construction]]\n* [[Rigid rotor]]\n\n==References==\n\n* C.

      "title": "Euler's rotation theorem",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_rotation_theorem",
      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=September 2010}}\n[[Image:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], '''Euler's rotation theorem''' states that, in [[three-dimensional space]], any displacement of a [[rigid body]] such that a point on the rigid body remains fixed, is equivalent to a single rotation about some axis that runs through the [[fixed point (mathematics)| fixed point]]. It also means that the composition of two rotations is also a rotation. Therefore the set of rotations has a group structure, known as a ''[[Rotation group SO(3)|rotation group]]''.\n\nThe theorem is named after [[Leonhard Euler]], who proved it in 1775 by means of [[spherical geometry]]. The axis of rotation is known as an '''Euler axis''', typically represented by a [[unit vector]] {{math|'''ê'''}}. Its product by the rotation angle is known as an [[axis-angle]]. The extension of the theorem to [[kinematics]] yields the concept of [[instant axis of rotation]], a line of fixed points.\n\nIn linear algebra terms, the theorem states that, in 3D space, any two [[Cartesian coordinate systems]] with a common origin are related by a rotation about some fixed axis. This also means that the product of two rotation matrices is again a rotation matrix and that for a non-identity [[rotation matrix]] one [[eigenvalue]] is 1 and the other two are both complex, or both equal to −1. The [[eigenvector]] corresponding to this eigenvalue is the axis of rotation connecting the two systems.\n\n==Euler's theorem (1776)==\n\nEuler states the theorem as follows:<ref>Novi Commentarii academiae scientiarum Petropolitanae 20, 1776, pp. 189–207 (E478)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n'''''Theorema.'''\nQuomodocunque sphaera circa centrum suum conuertatur, semper assignari potest diameter,\ncuius directio in situ translato conueniat cum situ initiali.''\n</blockquote>\n\nor (in English):\n<blockquote>When a sphere is moved around its centre it is always possible to find a diameter whose direction in the displaced position is the same as in the initial position.</blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Euler Rotation 1.JPG|200px|left|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Blue great circle on sphere transforms into red great circle when rotated about diameter through {{math|'''O'''}}.]]\n===Proof===\n\nEuler's original proof was made using [[spherical geometry]] and therefore whenever he speaks about triangles they must be understood as [[spherical triangle]]s.\n\n====Previous analysis====\nTo arrive at a proof, Euler analyses what the situation would look like if the theorem were true. To that end, suppose the yellow line in '''Figure 1''' goes through the center of the sphere and is the axis of rotation we are looking for, and point {{math|'''O'''}} is one of the two intersection points of that axis with the sphere. Then he considers an arbitrary great circle that does not contain {{math|'''O'''}} (the blue circle), and its image after rotation (the red circle), which is another great circle not containing {{math|'''O'''}}. He labels a point on their intersection as point {{math|'''A'''}}. (If the circles coincide, then {{math|'''A'''}} can be taken as any point on either; otherwise {{math|'''A'''}} is one of the two points of intersection.) \n\n[[Image:Euler Rotation 2.JPG|200px|right|thumb|'''Figure 2''': Arcs connecting preimage {{math|'''α'''}} and image {{math|'''a'''}} of {{math|'''A'''}} with bisector {{math|'''AO'''}} of the angle at {{math|'''A'''}}.]]\n\nNow {{math|'''A'''}} is on the initial circle (the blue circle), so its image will be on the transported circle (red). He labels that image as point {{math|'''a'''}}. Since {{math|'''A'''}} is also on the transported circle (red), it is the image of another point that was on the initial circle (blue) and he labels that preimage as {{math|'''α'''}} (see '''Figure 2'''). Then he considers the two arcs joining {{math|'''α'''}} and {{math|'''a'''}} to {{math|'''A'''}}. These arcs have the same length because arc {{math|'''αA'''}} is mapped onto arc {{math|'''Aa'''}}. Also, since {{math|'''O'''}} is a fixed point, triangle {{math|'''αOA'''}} is mapped onto triangle {{math|'''AOa'''}}, so these triangles are isosceles, and arc {{math|'''AO'''}} bisects angle {{math|∠'''αAa'''}}.\n\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Euler Rotation 3.JPG|200px|left|thumb|'''Figure 3''': {{math|'''O'''}} goes to {{math|'''O′'''}}, but {{math|'''O′'''}} must coincide with {{math|'''O'''}}.]]\n\n====Construction of the best candidate point====\nLet us construct a point that could be invariant using the previous considerations. We start with the blue great circle and its image under the transformation, which is the red great circle as in the '''Figure 1'''. Let point {{math|'''A'''}} be a point of intersection of those circles. If {{math|'''A'''}}’s image under the transformation is the same point then {{math|'''A'''}} is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing {{math|'''A'''}} is the axis of rotation and the theorem is proved.\n\nOtherwise we label {{math|'''A'''}}’s image as {{math|'''a'''}} and its preimage as {{math|'''α'''}}, and connect these two points to {{math|'''A'''}} with arcs {{math|'''αA'''}} and {{math|'''Aa'''}}. These arcs have the same length. Construct the great circle that bisects {{math|∠'''αAa'''}} and locate point {{math|'''O'''}} on that great circle so that arcs {{math|'''AO'''}} and {{math|'''aO'''}} have the same length, and call the region of the sphere containing {{math|'''O'''}} and bounded by the blue and red great circles the interior of {{math|∠'''αAa'''}}. (That is, the yellow region in '''Figure 3'''.) Then since {{math|'''αA''' {{=}} '''Aa'''}} and {{math|'''O'''}} is on the bisector of {{math|∠'''αAa'''}}, we also have {{math|'''αO''' {{=}} '''aO'''}}.\n\n====Proof of its invariance under the transformation====\nNow let us suppose that {{math|'''O′'''}} is the image of {{math|'''O'''}}. Then we know {{math|∠'''αAO''' {{=}} ∠'''AaO′'''}} and orientation is preserved,{{efn|Orientation is preserved in the sense that if {{math|'''αA'''}} is rotated about {{math|'''A'''}} counterclockwise to align with {{math|'''Oa'''}}, then {{math|'''Aa'''}} must be rotated about {{math|'''a'''}} counterclockwise to align with {{math|'''O′a'''}}. Likewise if the rotations are clockwise.}} so {{math|'''O′'''}} must be interior to {{math|∠'''αAa'''}}. Now {{math|'''AO'''}} is transformed to {{math|'''aO′'''}}, so {{math|'''AO''' {{=}} '''aO′'''}}. Since {{math|'''AO'''}} is also the same length as {{math|'''aO'''}}, {{math|∠'''AaO''' {{=}} ∠'''aAO'''}}. But {{math|∠'''aAO''' {{=}} ∠'''AaO′'''}}, so {{math|∠'''AaO''' {{=}} ∠'''AaO′'''}} and therefore {{math|'''O′'''}} is the same point as {{math|'''O'''}}. In other words, {{math|'''O'''}} is a fixed point of the transformation, and since the center is also a fixed point, the diameter of the sphere containing {{math|'''O'''}} is the axis of rotation.\n\n{{clear}}\n====Final notes about the construction====\n[[Image:Eulerrotation.svg|200px|left|thumb|Euler's original drawing]]\n\nEuler also points out that {{math|'''O'''}} can be found by intersecting the perpendicular bisector of {{math|'''Aa'''}} with the angle bisector of {{math|∠'''αAO'''}}, a construction that might be easier in practice. He also proposed the intersection of two planes:\n\n*the symmetry plane of the angle {{math|∠'''αAa'''}} (which passes through the center {{math|'''C'''}} of the sphere), and\n*the symmetry plane of the arc {{math|'''Aa'''}} (which also passes through {{math|'''C'''}}).\n\n:'''Proposition'''. These two planes intersect in a diameter. This diameter is the one we are looking for.\n\n:'''Proof'''. Let us call {{math|'''O'''}} either of the endpoints (there are two) of this diameter over the sphere surface. Since {{math|'''αA'''}} is mapped on {{math|'''Aa'''}} and the triangles have the same angles, it follows that the triangle {{math|'''OαA'''}} is transported onto the triangle {{math|'''OAa'''}}. Therefore the point {{math|'''O'''}} has to remain fixed under the movement.\n\n:'''Corollaries'''. This also shows that the rotation of the sphere can be seen as two consecutive reflections about the two planes described above. Points in a mirror plane are invariant under reflection, and hence the points on their intersection (a line: the axis of rotation) are invariant under both the reflections, and hence under the rotation.\n\nAnother simple way to find the rotation axis is by considering the plane on which the points {{math|'''α'''}}, {{math|'''A'''}}, {{math|'''a'''}} lie. The rotation axis is obviously orthogonal to this plane, and passes through the center {{math|'''C'''}} of the sphere.\n\nGiven that for a rigid body any movement that leaves an axis invariant is a rotation, this also proves that any arbitrary composition of rotations is equivalent to a single rotation around a new axis.\n\n==Matrix proof==\nA spatial rotation is a linear map in one-to-one correspondence with a {{nowrap|3 × 3}} [[rotation matrix]] {{math|'''R'''}} that transforms a coordinate [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] {{math|'''x'''}} into {{math|'''X'''}}, that is {{math|'''Rx''' {{=}} '''X'''}}. Therefore, another version of Euler's theorem is that for every rotation {{math|'''R'''}}, there is a nonzero vector {{math|'''n'''}} for which {{math|'''Rn''' {{=}} '''n'''}}; this is exactly the claim that {{math|'''n'''}} is an [[eigenvector]] of {{math|'''R'''}} associated with the [[eigenvalue]] 1. Hence it suffices to prove that 1 is an eigenvalue of {{math|'''R'''}}; the rotation axis of {{math|'''R'''}} will be the line {{math|''μ'''''n'''}}, where {{math|'''n'''}} is the eigenvector with eigenvalue 1.\n\nA rotation matrix has the fundamental property that its inverse is its transpose, that is\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{R} = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T} = \\mathbf{I},\n</math>\nwhere {{math|'''I'''}} is the {{nowrap|3 × 3}} identity matrix and superscript T indicates the transposed matrix. \n\nCompute the determinant of this relation to find that a rotation matrix has [[determinant]] ±1. In particular,\n:<math>\n1=\\det(\\mathbf{I})=\\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{R}\\right) = \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T}\\right)\\det(\\mathbf{R})\n= \\det(\\mathbf{R})^2 \\quad\\Longrightarrow \\quad \\det(\\mathbf{R}) = \\pm 1.\n</math>\nA rotation matrix with determinant +1 is a proper rotation, and one with a negative determinant −1 is an ''improper rotation'', that is a reflection combined with a proper rotation.\n\nIt will now be shown that a rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} has at least one invariant vector {{math|'''n'''}}, i.e., {{math|'''Rn''' {{=}} '''n'''}}. Because this requires that {{math|('''R''' − '''I''')'''n''' {{=}} 0}}, we see that the vector {{math|'''n'''}} must be an [[eigenvector]] of the matrix {{math|'''R'''}} with eigenvalue {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 1}}. Thus, this is equivalent to showing that {{math|det('''R''' − '''I''') {{=}} 0}}.\n\nUse the two relations\n:<math> \\det(-\\mathbf{A}) = (-1)^{3} \\det(\\mathbf{A}) = - \\det(\\mathbf{A}) \\quad</math>\nfor any {{nowrap|3 × 3}} matrix '''A''' and\n:<math> \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\right) = 1 \\quad</math>\n(since {{math|det('''R''') {{=}} 1}}) to compute\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\det(\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I}) =\\det\\left((\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I})^\\mathsf{T}\\right) &= \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^\\mathsf{T} - \\mathbf{I}\\right) = \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{-1} - \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{R}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{-1} (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{R}) \\right) = \\det\\left(\\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\right) \\, \\det( -(\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I}) )\n= - \\det(\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I})\\quad \\Longrightarrow\\quad \\det(\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I}) = 0.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThis shows that {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 1}} is a root (solution) of the [[Characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]], that is,\n:<math>\n\\det(\\mathbf{R} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0\\quad \\hbox{for}\\quad \\lambda=1.\n</math>\nIn other words, the matrix {{math|'''R''' − '''I'''}} is singular and has a non-zero [[Kernel (matrix)|kernel]], that is, there is at least one non-zero vector, say {{math|'''n'''}}, for which\n:<math>\n(\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{I}) \\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{n}.\n</math>\nThe line {{math|''μ'''''n'''}} for real {{mvar|μ}} is invariant under {{math|'''R'''}}, i.e., {{math|''μ'''''n'''}} is a rotation axis. This proves Euler's theorem.\n<!--\nThis result is often used as a showcase for the elementary theory of zeroes of polynomials, proving by a process of elimination that there are no other possibilities than that of the characteristic polynomial having 1 as a zero, but that ultimately results in a longer argument than the one above. First, since the matrix is real and has side 3, its characteristic polynomial must be real and of odd degree, hence it has a real zero. Second, multiplication by the matrix preserves the length of all vectors, and thus all eigenvalues must have absolute value 1. This leaves only 1 and −1 as candidates for being the real eigenvalue. Because complex eigenvalues occur in conjugate pairs, they give no net contribution to the determinant. Hence, the fact that the determinant is 1 means the multiplicity of −1 as a zero of the characteristic equation must be even. If the multiplicity is 2 then the third zero must be 1. If the multiplicity of −1 is 0 then the real zero must be 1. Either way, 1 is a zero of the characteristic equation.\n-->\n==Equivalence of an orthogonal matrix to a rotation matrix==\nTwo matrices (representing linear maps) are said to be equivalent if there is a change of basis that makes one equal to the other. A proper [[orthogonal matrix]] is always equivalent (in this sense) to either the following matrix or to its vertical reflection:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{R} \\sim\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad 0\\le \\phi \\le 2\\pi.\n</math>\n\nThen, any orthogonal matrix is either a rotation or an [[improper rotation]]. A general orthogonal matrix has only one real eigenvalue, either +1 or&nbsp;−1. When it is +1 the matrix is a rotation. When −1, the matrix is an improper rotation.\n\nIf {{math|'''R'''}} has more than one invariant vector then {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|'''R''' {{=}} '''I'''}}. ''Any'' vector is an invariant vector of {{math|'''I'''}}.\n\n===Excursion into matrix theory===\nIn order to prove the previous equation some facts from matrix theory must be recalled.\n\nAn {{math|''m'' × ''m''}} matrix {{math|'''A'''}} has {{math|''m''}} orthogonal eigenvectors if and only if {{math|'''A'''}} is [[normal operator|normal]], that is, if {{math|'''A'''<sup>†</sup>'''A''' {{=}} '''AA'''<sup>†</sup>}}.{{efn|The dagger symbol {{math|†}} stands for [[complex conjugation]] followed by transposition. For real matrices complex conjugation does nothing and daggering a real matrix is the same as transposing it.}} This result is equivalent to stating that normal matrices can be brought to diagonal form by a unitary similarity transformation:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}\\; \\operatorname{diag}(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_m)\\quad \\Longleftrightarrow\\quad\n\\mathbf{U}^\\dagger \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{U} = \\operatorname{diag}(\\alpha_1,\\ldots,\\alpha_m),\n</math>\nand {{math|'''U'''}} is unitary, that is,\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{U}^\\dagger = \\mathbf{U}^{-1}.\n</math>\nThe eigenvalues {{math|''α''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''α<sub>m</sub>''}} are roots of the characteristic equation. If the matrix {{math|'''A'''}} happens to be unitary (and note that unitary matrices are normal), then\n:<math>\n\\left(\\mathbf{U}^\\dagger\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{U}\\right)^\\dagger = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\alpha^*_1,\\ldots,\\alpha^*_m\\right) =\n\\mathbf{U}^\\dagger\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{U} = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha_1},\\ldots,\\frac{1}{\\alpha_m}\\right)\n</math>\nand it follows that the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix are on the unit circle in the complex plane:\n:<math>\n\\alpha^*_k = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_k} \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad \\alpha^*_k\\alpha_k = \\left|\\alpha_k\\right|^2 = 1,\\qquad k=1,\\ldots,m.\n</math>\nAlso an orthogonal (real unitary) matrix has eigenvalues on the unit circle in the complex plane. Moreover, since its characteristic equation (an {{mvar|m}}th order polynomial in {{mvar|λ}}) has real coefficients, it follows that its roots appear in complex conjugate pairs, that is, if {{mvar|α}} is a root then so is {{math|''α''<sup>∗</sup>}}. There are 3 roots, thus at least one of them must be purely real (+1 or −1).\n\nAfter recollection of these general facts from matrix theory, we return to the rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}}. It follows from its realness and orthogonality that we can find a {{math|'''U'''}} such that:\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{U}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\phi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\phi} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & \\pm 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nIf a matrix {{math|'''U'''}} can be found that gives the above form, and there is only one purely real component and it is −1, then we define R to be an improper rotation. Let us only consider the case, then, of matrices R that are proper rotations (the third eigenvalue is just 1). The third column of the {{nowrap|3 × 3}} matrix {{math|'''U'''}} will then be equal to the invariant vector {{math|'''n'''}}. Writing {{math|'''u'''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|'''u'''<sub>2</sub>}} for the first two columns of {{math|'''U'''}}, this equation gives\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{u}_1 = e^{i\\phi}\\, \\mathbf{u}_1 \\quad\\hbox{and}\\quad \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{u}_2 = e^{-i\\phi}\\, \\mathbf{u}_2.\n</math>\nIf {{math|'''u'''<sub>1</sub>}} has eigenvalue 1, then {{math|''φ'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|'''u'''<sub>2</sub>}} has also eigenvalue 1, which implies that in that case {{math|'''R''' {{=}} '''E'''}}.\n\nFinally, the matrix equation is transformed by means of a unitary matrix,\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{U}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\mathbf{U}\n\\underbrace{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}_{=\\;\\mathbf{I}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\ne^{i\\phi} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & e^{-i\\phi} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nwhich gives\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{U'}^\\dagger \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{U'} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos\\phi & -\\sin\\phi & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\phi & \\cos\\phi & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\\text{ with }\\quad \\mathbf{U'}\n= \\mathbf{U}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} & \\frac{-i}{\\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} .\n</math>\nThe columns of {{math|'''U'''′}} are orthonormal. The third column is still {{math|'''n'''}}, the other two columns are perpendicular to {{math|'''n'''}}. We can now see how our definition of improper rotation corresponds with the geometric interpretation: an improper rotation is a rotation around an axis (here, the axis corresponding to the third coordinate) and a reflection on a plane perpendicular to that axis. If we only restrict ourselves to matrices with determinant 1, we can thus see that they must be proper rotations. This result implies that any orthogonal matrix {{math|'''R'''}} corresponding to a proper rotation is equivalent to a rotation over an angle {{mvar|φ}} around an axis {{math|'''n'''}}.\n\n==Equivalence classes==\nThe [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] (sum of diagonal elements) of the real rotation matrix given above is {{math|1 + 2 cos ''φ''}}. Since a trace is invariant under an orthogonal matrix similarity transformation,\n:<math>\n\\mathrm{Tr}\\left[\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{A}^\\mathsf{T}\\right] =\n\\mathrm{Tr}\\left[ \\mathbf{R} \\mathbf{A}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{A}\\right] = \\mathrm{Tr}[\\mathbf{R}]\\quad\\text{ with }\\quad \\mathbf{A}^\\mathsf{T} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1},\n</math>\nit follows that all matrices that are equivalent to {{math|'''R'''}} by such orthogonal matrix transformations have the same trace: the trace is a ''class function''. This matrix transformation is clearly an [[equivalence relation]], that is, all such equivalent matrices form an equivalence class. \n\nIn fact, all proper rotation {{nowrap|3 × 3}} rotation matrices form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], usually denoted by SO(3) (the special orthogonal group in 3 dimensions) and all matrices with the same trace form an equivalence class in this group. All elements of such an equivalence class ''share their rotation angle'', but all rotations are around different axes. If {{math|'''n'''}} is an eigenvector of {{math|'''R'''}} with eigenvalue 1, then {{math|'''An'''}} is also an eigenvector of {{math|'''ARA'''}}<sup>T</sup>, also with eigenvalue 1. Unless {{math|'''A''' {{=}} '''I'''}}, {{math|'''n'''}} and {{math|'''An'''}} are different.\n\n==Applications==\n===Generators of rotations===\n{{Main|Rotation matrix|Rotation group SO(3)|Infinitesimal transformation}}\n\nSuppose we specify an axis of rotation by a unit vector {{math|[''x'', ''y'', ''z'']}}, and suppose we have an [[Infinitesimal rotation|infinitely small rotation]] of angle {{math|Δ''θ''}} about that vector. Expanding the rotation matrix as an infinite addition, and taking the first order approach, the rotation matrix {{math|Δ''R''}} is represented as:\n\n: <math>\n\\Delta R =\n \\begin{bmatrix}\n 1&0&0\\\\\n 0&1&0\\\\\n 0&0&1\n \\end{bmatrix}\n+\n \\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & z&-y\\\\\n -z& 0& x\\\\\n y &-x& 0\n \\end{bmatrix}\\,\\Delta \\theta\n= \\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{A}\\,\\Delta \\theta.\n</math>\n\nA finite rotation through angle {{mvar|θ}} about this axis may be seen as a succession of small rotations about the same axis. Approximating {{math|Δ''θ''}} as {{math|{{sfrac|''θ''|''N''}}}} where {{math|''N''}} is a large number, a rotation of {{mvar|θ}} about the axis may be represented as:\n\n:<math>\nR =\\left(\\mathbf{1}+\\frac{\\mathbf{A}\\theta}{N}\\right)^N\n\\approx e^{\\mathbf{A}\\theta}.</math>\n\nIt can be seen that Euler's theorem essentially states that ''all'' rotations may be represented in this form. The product {{math|'''A'''''θ''}} is the \"generator\" of the particular rotation, being the vector {{math|(''x'',''y'',''z'')}} associated with the matrix {{math|'''A'''}}. This shows that the rotation matrix and the [[Axis–angle representation|axis–angle]] format are related by the exponential function.\n\nOne can derive a simple expression for the generator {{math|'''G'''}}. One starts with an arbitrary plane (in Euclidean space) defined by a pair of perpendicular unit vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}. In this plane one can choose an arbitrary vector {{math|'''x'''}} with perpendicular {{math|'''y'''}}. One then solves for {{math|'''y'''}} in terms of {{math|'''x'''}} and substituting into an expression for a rotation in a plane yields the rotation matrix {{math|'''R'''}} which includes the generator {{nowrap|{{math|'''G''' {{=}} '''ba'''}}<sup>T</sup>{{math| − '''ab'''}}<sup>T</sup>}}.\n\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{x}&=\\mathbf{a}\\cos \\alpha + \\mathbf{b}\\sin \\alpha \\\\ \n\\mathbf{y}&=-\\mathbf{a}\\sin \\alpha + \\mathbf{b}\\cos \\alpha \\\\ \n\\cos \\alpha &= \\mathbf{a}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{x} \\\\\n\\sin \\alpha &= \\mathbf{b}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{x} \\\\[8px]\n\\mathbf{y} &= -\\mathbf{ab}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{x}+\\mathbf{ba}^\\mathsf{T}\\mathbf{x}=\\left( \\mathbf{ba}^\\mathsf{T}-\\mathbf{ab}^\\mathsf{T} \\right)\\mathbf{x} \\\\[8px]\n\\mathbf{x}'&=\\mathbf{x}\\cos \\beta + \\mathbf{y}\\sin \\beta \\\\ \n&=\\left( \\mathbf{I}\\cos \\beta +\\left( \\mathbf{ba}^\\mathsf{T}-\\mathbf{ab}^\\mathsf{T} \\right)\\sin \\beta \\right)\\mathbf{x} \\\\[8px] \n\\mathbf{R} &= \\mathbf{I}\\cos \\beta + \\left( \\mathbf{ba}^\\mathsf{T}-\\mathbf{ab}^\\mathsf{T} \\right)\\sin\\beta \\\\ \n&= \\mathbf{I} \\cos \\beta + \\mathbf{G} \\sin \\beta \\\\[8px] \n\\mathbf{G} &= \\mathbf{ba}^\\mathsf{T}-\\mathbf{ab}^\\mathsf{T} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo include vectors outside the plane in the rotation one needs to modify the above expression for {{math|'''R'''}} by including two [[Projection (linear algebra)|projection operators]] that partition the space. This modified rotation matrix can be rewritten as an [[Matrix exponential#Rotation case|exponential function]].\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\mathbf{P_{ab}} &= -\\mathbf{G}^2 \\\\ \n \\mathbf{R} &= \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{P_{ab}} + \\left( \\mathbf{I} \\cos \\beta + \\mathbf{G} \\sin \\beta \\right)\\mathbf{P_{ab}}= e^{\\mathbf{G}\\beta } \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnalysis is often easier in terms of these generators, rather than the full rotation matrix. Analysis in terms of the generators is known as the [[Lie algebra]] of the rotation group.\n\n===Quaternions===\n{{Main|Rotation operator (vector space)|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\n\nIt follows from Euler's theorem that the relative orientation of any pair of coordinate systems may be specified by a set of three independent numbers. Sometimes a redundant fourth number is added to simplify operations with quaternion algebra. Three of these numbers are the direction cosines that orient the eigenvector. The fourth is the angle about the eigenvector that separates the two sets of coordinates. Such a set of four numbers is called a '''[[quaternion]]'''.\n\nWhile the quaternion as described above, does not involve [[complex number]]s, if quaternions are used to describe two successive rotations, they must be combined using the non-commutative [[quaternion]] algebra derived by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] through the use of imaginary numbers.\n\nRotation calculation via quaternions has come to replace the use of [[direction cosines]] in aerospace applications through their reduction of the required calculations, and their ability to minimize [[round-off error]]s. Also, in [[computer graphics]] the ability to perform spherical interpolation between quaternions with relative ease is of value.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{see also|Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space}}\n\nIn higher dimensions, any rigid motion that preserves a point in dimension {{math|2''n''}} or {{math|2''n'' + 1}} is a composition of at most {{mvar|n}} rotations in orthogonal [[plane of rotation|planes of rotation]], though these planes need not be uniquely determined, and a rigid motion may fix multiple axes.\n\n[[File:Pure screw.svg|thumb|A screw motion.]]\nA rigid motion in three dimensions that does not necessarily fix a point is a \"screw motion\". This is because a composition of a rotation with a translation perpendicular to the axis is a rotation about a parallel axis, while composition with a translation parallel to the axis yields a screw motion; see [[screw axis]]. This gives rise to [[screw theory]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Euler angles]]\n* [[Euler–Rodrigues parameters]]\n* [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n* [[Rotation operator (vector space)]]\n* [[Angular velocity]]\n* [[Rotation around a fixed axis]]\n* [[Matrix exponential#Rotation case|Matrix exponential]]\n* [[Axis–angle representation]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n:{{Citizendium|title=Euler's theorem (rotation)}}\n* {{Cite journal|year=2009|title=A Disorienting Look at Euler's Theorem on the Axis of a Rotation|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=116|issue=10|pages=892–909|first1=Bob |last1=Palais |first2=Richard |last2=Palais |first3=Stephen |last3=Rodi |doi=10.4169/000298909x477014}}\n* Euler's theorem and its proof are contained in paragraphs 24–26 of the appendix (''Additamentum''. pp.&nbsp;201–203) of L.

A set of three gimbals mounted together to allow three degrees of freedom: roll, pitch and yaw. When two gimbals rotate around the same axis, the system loses one degree of freedom.]]\n[[File:Gimbal lock still occurs with 4 axis.png|thumb|Adding a fourth rotational axis can solve the problem of gimbal lock, but it requires the outermost ring to be actively driven so that it stays 90 degrees out of alignment with the innermost axis (the flywheel shaft). Without active driving of the outermost ring, all four axes can become aligned in a plane as shown above, again leading to gimbal lock and inability to roll.]]\n\n'''Gimbal lock''' is the loss of one [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] in a three-dimensional, three-[[gimbal]] mechanism that occurs when the axes of two of the three gimbals are driven into a parallel configuration, \"locking\" the system into [[rotation]] in a degenerate two-dimensional space.\n\nThe word ''lock'' is misleading: no gimbal is restrained. All three gimbals can still rotate freely about their respective axes of suspension. Nevertheless, because of the parallel orientation of two of the gimbals' axes there is no gimbal available to accommodate rotation about one axis.\n\n==Gimbals==\n{{Main|Gimbal}}\n\nA gimbal is a ring that is suspended so it can rotate about an axis. Gimbals are typically nested one within another to accommodate rotation about multiple axes.\n\nThey appear in [[gyroscope]]s and in [[inertial measurement unit]]s to allow the inner gimbal's orientation to remain fixed while the outer gimbal suspension assumes any orientation. In [[compasses]] and [[flywheel energy storage]] mechanisms they allow objects to remain upright. They are used to orient [[Rocket engine|thrusters]] on rockets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/gimbal.htm|title=What is a gimbal -- and what does it have to do with NASA?|author=Jonathan Strickland|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nSome [[coordinate system]]s in mathematics behave as if there were real gimbals used to measure the angles, notably [[Euler angles]].\n\nFor cases of three or fewer nested gimbals, gimbal lock inevitably occurs at some point in the system due to properties of [[covering space]]s (described below).\n\n==In engineering==\nWhile only two specific orientations produce exact gimbal lock, practical mechanical gimbals encounter difficulties near those orientations.  When a set of gimbals is close to the locked configuration, small rotations of the gimbal platform require large motions of the surrounding gimbals.  Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of gimbal lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the gimbals&mdash;due to inertia (resulting from the mass of each gimbal ring), bearing friction, the flow resistance of air or other fluid surrounding the gimbals (if they are not in a vacuum), and other physical and engineering factors&mdash;limit the motion of the platform close to that point.\n\n===In two dimensions===\nGimbal lock can occur in gimbal systems with two degrees of freedom such as a [[theodolite]] with rotations about an [[azimuth]] and elevation in two dimensions. These systems can gimbal lock at [[zenith]] and [[nadir]], because at those points azimuth is not well-defined, and rotation in the azimuth direction does not change the direction the theodolite is pointing.\n\nConsider tracking a helicopter flying towards the theodolite from the horizon. The theodolite is a telescope mounted on a tripod so that it can move in azimuth and elevation to track the helicopter. The helicopter flies towards the theodolite and is tracked by the telescope in elevation and azimuth. The helicopter flies immediately above the tripod (i.e. it is at zenith) when it changes direction and flies at 90 degrees to its previous course. The telescope cannot track this maneuver without a discontinuous jump in one or both of the gimbal orientations. There is no continuous motion that allows it to follow the target. It is in gimbal lock. So there is an infinity of directions around zenith for which the telescope cannot continuously track all movements of a target.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug98/896993617.Eg.r.html |title= Re: What is meant by the term gimbal lock? |author= Adrian Popa |date= June 4, 1998}}</ref> Note that even if the helicopter does not pass through zenith, but only ''near'' zenith, so that gimbal lock does not occur, the system must still move exceptionally rapidly to track it, as it rapidly passes from one bearing to the other. The closer to zenith the nearest point is, the faster this must be done, and if it actually goes through zenith, the limit of these \"increasingly rapid\" movements becomes ''infinitely'' fast, namely discontinuous.\n\nTo recover from gimbal lock the user has to go around the zenith – explicitly: reduce the elevation, change the azimuth to match the azimuth of the target, then change the elevation to match the target.\n\nMathematically, this corresponds to the fact that [[spherical coordinates]] do not define a [[coordinate chart]] on the sphere at zenith and nadir. Alternatively, the corresponding map ''T''<sup>2</sup>&rarr;''S''<sup>2</sup> from the [[torus]] ''T''<sup>2</sup> to the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> (given by the point with given azimuth and elevation) is not a [[covering map]] at these points.\n\n===In three dimensions===\n[[File:Gimbal Lock Plane.gif|thumb|Gimbal locked airplane.

If the aircraft pitches up 90 degrees, the aircraft and platform's yaw axis gimbal becomes parallel to the roll axis gimbal, and changes about yaw can no longer be compensated for.\n\n===Solutions===\nThis problem may be overcome by use of a fourth gimbal, actively driven by a motor so as to maintain a large angle between roll and yaw gimbal axes.  Another solution is to rotate one or more of the gimbals to an arbitrary position when gimbal lock is detected and thus reset the device.\n\nModern practice is to avoid the use of gimbals entirely. In the context of [[inertial navigation system]]s, that can be done by mounting the inertial sensors directly to the body of the vehicle (this is called a [[strapdown]] system)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|title=Overview of Pen Design and Navigation Background|author=Chris Verplaetse|year=1995|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214023126/http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~verp/projects/smartpen/node8.html#SECTION00322000000000000000|archivedate=2009-02-14|df=}}</ref> and integrating sensed rotation and acceleration digitally using [[quaternion]] methods to derive vehicle orientation and velocity.

From this point, the spacecraft would have to be manually moved away from the gimbal lock position, and the platform would have to be manually realigned using the stars as a reference.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/gimbals.html|title=Gimbal Angles, Gimbal Lock, and a Fourth Gimbal for Christmas|author1=Eric M. Jones |author2=Paul Fjeld |year=2006}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Lunar Module had landed, [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] aboard the Command Module joked \"How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?\"\n\n===Robotics===\n[[File:Automation of foundry with robot.jpg|thumb|right|Industrial robot operating in a foundry.]]\nIn robotics, gimbal lock is commonly referred to as \"wrist flip\", due to the use of a \"triple-roll wrist\" in [[robotic arm]]s, where three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point.\n\nAn example of a wrist flip, also called a wrist singularity, is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot's wrist to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the end effector. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the end effector, and the process.\n\nThe importance of avoiding singularities in robotics has led the American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements to define it as \"a condition caused by the collinear alignment of two or more robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities\".<ref>ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999</ref>\n\n==In applied mathematics==\n{{No footnotes|section|date=July 2013}}\nThe problem of gimbal lock appears when one uses [[Euler angles]] in applied mathematics; developers of 3D [[computer program]]s, such as [[3D modeling]], [[inertial guidance system|embedded navigation systems]], and [[video game]]s must take care to avoid it.\n\nIn formal language, gimbal lock occurs because the map from Euler angles to rotations (topologically, from the 3-torus ''T<sup>3</sup>'' to the [[real projective space]] '''RP'''<sup>3</sup> which is the same as the space of 3d rotations SO3) is not a [[local homeomorphism]] at every point, and thus at some points the [[Rank (differential topology)|rank]] (degrees of freedom) must drop below 3, at which point gimbal lock occurs. Euler angles provide a means for giving a numerical description of any [[rotation]] in three-dimensional space using three numbers, but not only is this description not unique, but there are some points where not every change in the target space (rotations) can be realized by a change in the source space (Euler angles). This is a topological constraint – there is no covering map from the 3-torus to the 3-dimensional real projective space; the only (non-trivial) covering map is from the 3-sphere, as in the use of [[quaternions]].\n\nTo make a comparison, all the [[translation (geometry)|translations]] can be described using three numbers <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math>, as the succession of three consecutive linear movements along three perpendicular axes <math>X</math>, <math>Y</math> and <math>Z</math> axes. The same holds true for rotations: all the rotations can be described using three numbers <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\beta</math>, and <math>\\gamma</math>, as the succession of three rotational movements around three axes that are perpendicular one to the next. This similarity between linear coordinates and angular coordinates makes Euler angles very [[intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]], but unfortunately they suffer from the gimbal lock problem.\n\n===Loss of a degree of freedom with Euler angles===\nA rotation in 3D space can be represented numerically with [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in several ways. One of these representations is:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nR &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos \\alpha & -\\sin \\alpha \\\\\n0 & \\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\beta & 0 & \\sin \\beta \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-\\sin \\beta & 0 & \\cos \\beta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\gamma & -\\sin \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\gamma & \\cos \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAn example worth examining happens when <math>\\beta = \\tfrac{\\pi}{2}</math>. Knowing that <math>\\cos \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} = 0</math> and <math>\\sin \\tfrac{\\pi}{2} = 1</math>, the above expression becomes equal to:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n R &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\cos \\alpha & -\\sin \\alpha \\\\\n0 & \\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\gamma & -\\sin \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\gamma & \\cos \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\nCarrying out [[matrix multiplication]]:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n R &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha & 0 \\\\\n-\\cos \\alpha & \\sin \\alpha & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos \\gamma & -\\sin \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n\\sin \\gamma & \\cos \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\sin \\alpha \\cos \\gamma + \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\gamma & -\\sin \\alpha \\sin \\gamma + \\cos \\alpha \\cos \\gamma & 0 \\\\\n-\\cos \\alpha \\cos \\gamma + \\sin \\alpha \\sin \\gamma & \\cos \\alpha \\sin \\gamma + \\sin \\alpha \\cos \\gamma & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAnd finally using the [[trigonometry formulas#Angle sum and difference identities|trigonometry formulas]]:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n R &= \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\sin ( \\alpha + \\gamma ) & \\cos (\\alpha + \\gamma) & 0 \\\\\n-\\cos ( \\alpha + \\gamma ) & \\sin (\\alpha + \\gamma) & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\nChanging the values of <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\gamma</math> in the above matrix has the same effects: the rotation angle <math>\\alpha + \\gamma</math> changes, but the rotation axis remains in the <math>Z</math> direction: the last column and the first row in the matrix won't change. The only solution for <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\gamma</math> to recover different roles is to change <math>\\beta</math>.\n\nIt is possible to imagine an airplane rotated by the above-mentioned Euler angles using the '''X-Y-Z''' convention. In this case, the first angle - <math>\\alpha</math> is the pitch. Yaw is then set to <math>\\tfrac{\\pi}{2}</math> and the final rotation - by <math>\\gamma</math> - is again the airplane's pitch. Because of gimbal lock, it has lost one of the degrees of freedom - in this case the ability to roll.\n\nIt is also possible to choose another convention for representing a rotation with a matrix using Euler angles than the '''X-Y-Z''' convention above, and also choose other variation intervals for the angles, but in the end there is always at least one value for which a degree of freedom is lost.\n\nThe gimbal lock problem does not make Euler angles \"invalid\" (they always serve as a well-defined coordinate system), but it makes them unsuited for some practical applications.\n\n===Alternate orientation representation===\nThe cause of gimbal lock is representing an orientation as three axial rotations with [[Euler angles]]. A potential solution therefore is to represent the orientation in some other way. This could be as a [[rotation matrix]], a quaternion (see [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]), or a similar orientation representation that treats the orientation as a value rather than three separate and related values. Given such a representation, the user stores the orientation as a value. To apply angular changes, the orientation is modified by a delta angle/axis rotation. The resulting orientation must be re-normalized to prevent [[Floating point#Accuracy problems|floating-point error]] from successive transformations from accumulating. For matrices, re-normalizing the result requires converting the matrix into its [[orthonormal matrix#Nearest orthogonal matrix|nearest orthonormal representation]]. For quaternions, re-normalization requires [[unit quaternions|performing quaternion normalization]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Charts on SO(3)]]\n* [[Flight dynamics]]\n* [[Grid north]] (equivalent navigational problem on polar expeditions)\n* [[Inertial navigation system]]\n* [[Motion planning]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrUCBOlJdt4 Gimbal Lock - Explained] at [[YouTube]]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5PDboNJwks Gimbal Lock in 30 Seconds] at [[YouTube]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gimbal Lock}}\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Gyroscopes]]\n[[Category:Spaceflight concepts]]\n[[Category:3D computer graphics]]"

      "text": "In [[numerical linear algebra]], a '''Givens rotation''' is a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] in the plane spanned by two coordinates axes. Givens rotations are named after [[Wallace Givens]], who introduced them to numerical analysts in the 1950s while he was working at [[Argonne National Laboratory]].\n\n== Matrix representation ==\n\nA Givens rotation is represented by a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of the form\n\n:<math>G(i, j, \\theta) = \n       \\begin{bmatrix}   1   & \\cdots &    0   & \\cdots &    0   & \\cdots &    0   \\\\\n                      \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots &        & \\vdots &        & \\vdots \\\\\n                         0   & \\cdots &    c   & \\cdots &   -s   & \\cdots &    0   \\\\\n                      \\vdots &        & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots &        & \\vdots \\\\\n                         0   & \\cdots &    s   & \\cdots &    c   & \\cdots &    0   \\\\\n                      \\vdots &        & \\vdots &        & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n                         0   & \\cdots &    0   & \\cdots &    0   & \\cdots &    1\n       \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|1=''c'' = cos ''θ''}} and {{math|1=''s'' = sin ''θ''}} appear at the intersections {{mvar|i}}th and {{mvar|j}}th rows and columns. That is, for fixed {{mvar|i}} {{mvar|>}} {{mvar|j}}, the non-zero elements of Givens matrix are given by:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n g_{kk} &{}= 1 \\qquad \\text{for} \\ k \\ne i,\\,j\\\\\n g_{kk} &{}= c \\qquad \\text{for} \\ k = i,\\,j\\\\\n g_{ji} &{} = -g_{ij}= -s\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe product {{math|''G''(''i'', ''j'', ''θ'')'''x'''}} represents a counterclockwise rotation of the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] {{math|'''x'''}} in the {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} plane of {{mvar|θ}} radians, hence the name Givens rotation.\n\nThe main use of Givens rotations in [[numerical linear algebra]] is to introduce zeros{{clarify|date=March 2014}} in vectors or matrices.\nThis effect can, for example, be employed for computing the [[QR decomposition]] of a matrix. One advantage over [[Householder transformation]]s is that they can easily be parallelised, and another is that often for very sparse matrices they have a lower operation count.\n\n== Stable calculation ==\nWhen a Givens rotation matrix, {{math|''G''(''i'', ''j'', ''θ'')}}, multiplies another matrix, {{mvar|A}}, from the left, {{math|''G A''}}, only rows {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} of {{mvar|A}} are affected. Thus we restrict attention to the following counterclockwise problem. Given {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, find {{math|1=''c'' = cos ''θ''}} and {{math|1=''s'' = sin ''θ''}} such that\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} c & -s \\\\ s & c \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a \\\\ b \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} r \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} , </math>\nwhere <math> r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} </math> is the length of the vector <math>(a,b)</math>.\nExplicit calculation of {{mvar|θ}} is rarely necessary or desirable. Instead we directly seek {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|s}}. An obvious solution would be\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n c &{}\\larr a / r \\\\\n s &{}\\larr -b / r.\n\\end{align}</math><ref>{{cite book|last1=Björck|first1=Ake|title=Numerical Methods for Least Squares Problems|date=1996|publisher=SIAM|location=United States|isbn=9780898713602|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQD1LLYz6tkC|accessdate=16 August 2016|language=en}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the computation for {{mvar|r}} may [[arithmetic overflow|overflow]] or underflow. An alternative formulation avoiding this problem {{harv|Golub|Van Loan|1996|loc=§5.1.8}} is implemented as the [[hypot]] function in many programming languages.\n\nThe following fortran code is a minimalistic implementation of Givens rotation for real numbers.

This means that they can [[transformation (geometry)|transform]] the [[standard basis]] of the space to any other frame in the space.{{clarify|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhen rotations are performed in the right order, the values of the rotation angles of the final frame will be equal to the [[Euler angles]] of the final frame in the corresponding convention. For example, an operator <math>R = R_Y(\\theta_3).R_X(\\theta_2).R_Z(\\theta_1)</math> transforms the basis of the space into a frame with angles roll, pitch and yaw <math>YPR = (\\theta_3,\\theta_2,\\theta_1)</math> in the [[Tait–Bryan angles|Tait–Bryan convention]] ''z''-''x''-''y'' (convention in which the line of nodes is perpendicular to ''z'' and ''Y'' axes, also named ''Y''-''X′''-''Z″'').\n\nFor the same reason, any [[rotation matrix]] in 3D can be decomposed in a product of three of these [[three-dimensional rotation operator|rotation operators]].\n\nThe meaning of the composition of two Givens rotations {{math|''g'' ∘ ''f''}} is an operator that transforms vectors first by {{mvar|f}} and then by {{mvar|g}}, being {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} rotations about one axis of basis of the space. This is similar to the [[Euler angles#Euler angles as composition of extrinsic rotations|extrinsic rotation equivalence]] for Euler angles.\n\n===Table of composed rotations===\n\nThe following table shows the three Givens rotations equivalent to the different Euler angles conventions using extrinsic composition (composition of rotations about the basis axes) of [[Active and passive transformation|active rotations]] and the right-handed rule for the positive sign of the angles.\n\nThe notation has been simplified in such a way that {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} means {{math|cos ''θ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''s''<sub>2</sub>}} means {{math|sin ''θ''<sub>2</sub>)}}. The subindexes of the angles are the order in which they are applied using ''extrinsic'' composition (1 for intrinsic rotation, 2 for nutation, 3 for precession)\n\nAs rotations are applied just in the opposite order of the [[Euler angles#Table of composed rotations|Euler angles table of rotations]], this table is the same but swapping indexes 1 and 3 in the angles associated with the corresponding entry. An entry like ''zxy'' means to apply first the ''y'' rotation, then ''x'', and finally ''z'', in the basis axes.\n\nAll the compositions assume the right hand convention for the matrices that are multiplied, yielding the following results.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background-color:white; font-weight:500\"\n|-\n!''xzx''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n c_2 & - c_1 s_2 & s_1 s_2 \\\\\n c_3 s_2   & c_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1  & - c_2 c_3 s_1 - c_1 s_3 \\\\\n s_2 s_3   & c_3 s_1 + c_1 c_2 s_3  & c_3 c_1 - c_2 s_3 s_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''xzy''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_2 c_3     & - c_3 s_2 c_1 + s_3 s_1   &  c_3 s_2 s_1 + s_3 c_1 \\\\\ns_2         & c_1 c_2                  & - c_2 s_1 \\\\\n- s_3 c_2   & s_3 s_2 c_1+c_3 s_1     & -s_3 s_2 s_1 + c_3 c_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n!''xyx''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_2       & s_1 s_2    & c_1 s_2 \\\\\ns_2 s_3   & c_3 c_1 - c_2 s_3 s_1 & - c_3 s_1 - c_1 c_2 s_3 \\\\\n-c_3 s_2  & c_3 c_2 s_1 + c_1 s_3 & c_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''xyz''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_3 c_2 &\t-s_3 c_1 + c_3 s_2 s_1 &\ts_3 s_1 + c_3 s_2 c_1 \\\\\ns_3 c_2 &\tc_3 c_1 + s_3 s_2 s_1 &\t-c_3 s_1 + s_3 s_2 c_1 \\\\\n-s_2 &\tc_2 s_1 &\tc_2 c_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n!''yxy''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n c_3 c_1 - c_2 s_3 s_1 & s_2 s_3 & c_3 s_1 + s_3 c_2 c_1 \\\\\n s_1 s_2 & c_2 & - c_1 s_2 \\\\\n -c_2 c_3 s_1 - c_1 s_3 & c_3 s_2 & c_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''yxz''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_3 c_1-s_3 s_2 s_1 &\t-s_3 c_2 &\tc_3 s_1+s_3 s_2 c_1 \\\\\ns_3 c_1+c_3 s_2 s_1 &\tc_3 c_2 &\ts_3 s_1-c_3 s_2 c_1 \\\\\n-c_2 s_1 &\ts_2 &\tc_2 c_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n!''yzy''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1 & - c_3 s_2 & c_2 c_3 s_1 + c_1 s_3 \\\\\n c_1 s_2 & c_2 & s_1 s_2 \\\\\n -c_3 s_1 - c_1 c_2 s_3 & s_2 s_3 & c_3 c_1 - c_2 s_3 s_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''yzx''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_2 c_1 &\t-s_2 &\tc_2 s_1 \\\\\nc_3 s_2 c_1+s_3 s_1 &\tc_3 c_2 &\tc_3 s_2 s_1-s_3 c_1 \\\\\ns_3 s_2 c_1-c_3 s_1 &\ts_3 c_2 &\ts_3 s_2 s_1+c_3 c_1\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n!''zyz''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1  & - c_2 s_1 c_3 - c_1 s_3 & c_3 s_2 \\\\\nc_3 s_1 + c_1 c_2 s_3  &  c_3 c_1 - c_2 s_3 s_1 & s_2 s_3 \\\\\n -c_1 s_2 & s_1 s_2 & c_2\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''zyx''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n c_2 c_1 \t     &           -c_2 s_1    &   s_2 \\\\\n s_3 s_2 c_1+c_3 s_1 &\t-s_3 s_2 s_1+c_3 c_1 &\t-s_3 c_2 \\\\\n-c_3 s_2 c_1+s_3 s_1 &\t c_3 s_2 s_1+s_3 c_1 &\t c_3 c_2\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n!''zxz''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_3 c_1 - c_2 s_1 s_3 & - c_3 s_1 - c_1 c_2 s_3 & s_2 s_3 \\\\\nc_2 c_3 s_1 + c_1 s_3 & c_3 c_2 c_1 - s_3 s_1 & - c_3 s_2 \\\\\ns_1 s_2 & c_1 s_2 & c_2\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n!''zxy''\n|<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n c_3 c_1+s_3 s_2 s_1 &\t-c_3 s_1+s_3 s_2 c_1 &\ts_3 c_2 \\\\\n c_2 s_1          &\tc_2 c_1 \t   &      -s_2 \\\\\n-s_3 c_1+c_3 s_2 s_1 &\ts_3 s_1+c_3 s_2 c_1  &  \tc_3 c_2\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Jacobi rotation]]\n* [[Plane of rotation]]\n* [[Householder transformation]]\n* [[Davenport rotations]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{Citation\n  | last1=Bindel | first1=D.\n  | last2=Demmel | first2=J.\n  | last3=Kahan | first3=W.\n  | last4=Marques | first4=O.\n  | url=http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lawns/downloads/\n  | title=On Computing Givens rotations reliably and efficiently\n  | year=2000 }}.

In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the second [[Euler angles#Euler rotations|Euler angle]]. If it is not caused by forces external to the body, it is called ''free nutation'' or ''[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] nutation''.<ref name=Lowrie/> A ''pure nutation'' is a movement of a rotational axis such that the first Euler angle is constant.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In spacecraft dynamics, [[precession]] (a change in the first Euler angle) is sometimes referred to as nutation.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kasdin|first=N.

After a short interval, the top settles into a motion in which each point on its rotation axis follows a circular path. The vertical force of gravity produces a horizontal torque {{math|'''&tau;'''}} about the point of contact with the surface; the top rotates in the direction of this torque with an angular velocity {{math|'''&Omega;'''}} such that at any moment\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{L},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''L'''}} is the instantaneous angular momentum of the top.<ref name=Feynman>{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|2011|pp=20–7{{clarify|date=December 2013}}}}</ref>\n\nInitially, however, there is no precession, and the top falls straight downward. This gives rise to an imbalance in torques that starts the precession. In falling, the top overshoots the level at which it would precess steadily and then oscillates about this level. This oscillation is called ''nutation''. If the motion is damped, the oscillations will die down until the motion is a steady precession.<ref name=Feynman/><ref name=Goldstein220>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=220}}</ref>\n\nThe physics of nutation in tops and [[gyroscope]]s can be explored using the model of a ''heavy symmetrical top'' with its tip fixed. Initially, the effect of friction is ignored. The motion of the top can be described by three [[Euler angles]]: the tilt angle {{math|''&theta;''}} between the symmetry axis of the top and the vertical; the [[azimuth]] {{math|''&phi;''}} of the top about the vertical; and the rotation angle {{math|''&psi;''}} of the top about its own axis. Thus, precession is the change in {{math|''&phi;''}} and nutation is the change in {{math|''&theta;''}}.<ref name=Goldstein217>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=217}}</ref>\n\nIf the top has mass {{math|''M''}} and its [[center of mass]] is at a distance {{math|''l''}} from the pivot point, its [[gravitational potential]] relative to the plane of the support is\n:<math>V = Mgl\\cos(\\theta).</math>\n\nIn a coordinate system where the {{math|''z''}} axis is the axis of symmetry, the top has [[angular velocity|angular velocities]] {{math|''&omega;''<sub>1</sub>, ''&omega;''<sub>2</sub>, ''&omega;''<sub>3</sub>}} and [[moments of inertia]] {{math|''I''<sub>1</sub>, ''I''<sub>2</sub>, ''I''<sub>3</sub>}} about the {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} axes. The [[kinetic energy]] is\n:<math>E_\\text{r} = \\frac{1}{2}I_1\\left(\\omega_1^2 + \\omega_2^2\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}I_3\\omega_3^2.</math>\n\nIn terms of the Euler angles, this is\n:<math>E_\\text{r} = \\frac{1}{2}I_1\\left(\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\dot{\\phi}^2\\sin^2(\\theta)\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}I_3\\left(\\dot{\\psi} + \\dot{\\phi}\\cos(\\theta)\\right)^2.</math>\n\nIf the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Euler–Lagrange equations]] are solved for this system, it is found that the motion depends on two constants {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} (each related to a [[constant of motion]]). The rate of precession is related to the tilt by\n:<math>\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{b - a\\cos(\\theta)}{\\sin^2(\\theta)}.</math>\n\nThe tilt is determined by a differential equation for {{math|''u'' {{=}} cos(''&theta;'')}} of the form\n:<math>\\dot{u}^2 = f(u)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''f''}} is a [[cubic function|cubic polynomial]] that depends on parameters {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} as well as constants that are related to the energy and the gravitational torque. The roots of {{math|''f''}} are [[cosine]]s of the angles at which the [[time derivative|rate of change]] of {{math|''&theta;''}} is zero. One of these is not related to a physical angle; the other two determine the upper and lower bounds on the tilt angle, between which the gyroscope oscillates.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=213–217}}</ref>\n\n==Astronomy==\n{{main|Astronomical nutation|Perturbation (astronomy)}}\n\nThe nutation of a planet occurs because the gravitational effects of other bodies cause the speed of its [[axial precession]] to vary over time, so that the speed is not constant. English astronomer [[James Bradley]] discovered the nutation of [[Earth's rotation|Earth's axis]] in 1728.\n\n===Earth===\n{{further|Geodynamics}}\n[[File:Trópico de Cáncer en México - Carretera 83 (Vía Corta) Zaragoza-Victoria, Km 27+800.jpg|thumb|240px|Yearly changes in the location of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] near a highway in Mexico]]\n\nNutation subtly changes the [[axial tilt]] of Earth with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane, shifting the [[Circle of latitude#Major circles of latitude|major circles of latitude]] that are defined by the Earth's tilt (the [[tropical circle]]s and the [[polar circle]]s).\n\nIn the case of Earth, the principal sources of tidal force are the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], which continuously change location relative to each other and thus cause nutation in Earth's axis. The largest component of Earth's nutation has a period of 18.6 years, the same as that of the precession of the [[Lunar node|Moon's orbital nodes]].<ref name=Lowrie>{{cite book |last=Lowrie |first=William |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |date=2007 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge [u.a.] |isbn=9780521675963 |pages=58–59 |edition=2nd}}</ref> However, there are other significant periodic terms that must be accounted for depending upon the desired accuracy of the result. A mathematical description (set of equations) that represents nutation is called a \"theory of nutation\". In the theory, parameters are adjusted in a more or less ''ad hoc'' method to obtain the best fit to data. Simple [[rigid body dynamics]] do not give the best theory; one has to account for deformations of the Earth, including [[asthenosphere|mantle inelasticity]] and changes in the [[core–mantle boundary]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_10382/IERS/EN/Science/Recommendations/resolutionB3.html |title=Resolution 83 on non-rigid Earth nutation theory |work=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |publisher=Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe principal term of nutation is due to the regression of the Moon's [[nodal line]] and has the same period of 6798 days (18.61 years).

The periods of all terms larger than 0.0001&Prime; (about as accurately as one{{who|date=May 2018}} can measure) lie between 5.5 and 6798 days; for some reason (as with ocean tidal periods) they seem to avoid the range from 34.8 to 91 days, so it is customary to split the nutation into long-period and short-period terms. The long-period terms are calculated and mentioned in the almanacs, while the additional correction due to the short-period terms is usually taken from a table.\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1961 disaster film ''[[The Day the Earth Caught Fire]]'', the near-simultaneous detonation of two super-[[hydrogen bomb]]s near the poles causes a change in Earth's nutation, as well as an 11° shift in the axial tilt and a change in Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Libration]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Feynman|first=Richard P.|first2= Robert B. |last2=Leighton |first3=Matthew |last3=Sands |title=The Feynman lectures on physics |date=2011|publisher=BasicBooks|location=New York|isbn=978-0465024933|edition=New millennium |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Herbert|title=Classical mechanics|date=1980|publisher=Addison-Wesley Pub.

A rotation may not be enough to reach the current placement. It may be necessary to add an imaginary [[translation (geometry)|translation]], called the object's location (or position, or linear position). The location and orientation together fully describe how the object is placed in space. The above-mentioned imaginary rotation and translation may be thought to occur in any order, as the orientation of an object does not change when it translates, and its location does not change when it rotates.\n\n[[Euler's rotation theorem]] shows that in three dimensions any orientation can be reached with a single [[rotation around a fixed axis]]. This gives one common way of representing the orientation using an [[axis–angle representation]]. Other widely used methods include [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation quaternions]], [[Euler angles]], or [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]. More specialist uses include [[Miller indices]] in crystallography, [[strike and dip]] in geology and [[grade (slope)|grade]] on maps and signs.\n\nTypically, the orientation is given relative to a [[frame of reference]], usually specified by a [[Cartesian coordinate system]].\n\n==Mathematical representations==\n\n=== Three dimensions ===\nIn general the position and orientation in space of a [[rigid body]] are defined as the position and orientation, relative to the main reference frame, of another reference frame, which is fixed relative to the body, and hence translates and rotates with it (the body's ''local reference frame'', or ''local coordinate system''). At least three independent values are needed to describe the orientation of this local frame. Three other values describe the position of a point on the object.\nAll the points of the body change their position during a rotation except for those lying on the rotation axis. If the rigid body has [[rotational symmetry]] not all orientations are distinguishable, except by observing how the orientation evolves in time from a known starting orientation.  For example, the orientation in space of a [[Line (geometry)|line]], [[line segment]], or [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] can be specified with only two values, for example two [[direction cosines]]. Another example is the position of a point on the earth, often described using the orientation of a line joining it with the earth's center, measured using the two angles of [[longitude and latitude]].  Likewise, the orientation of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] can be described with two values as well, for instance by specifying the orientation of a line [[surface normal|normal]] to that plane, or by using the strike and dip angles.\n\nFurther details about the mathematical methods to represent the orientation of rigid bodies and planes in three dimensions are given in the following sections.\n\n=== Two dimensions ===\nIn [[two dimensions]] the orientation of any object (line, vector, or [[plane figure]]) is given by a single value: the angle through which it has rotated. There is only one degree of freedom and only one fixed point about which the rotation takes place.\n\n== Rigid body in three dimensions ==\n{{Main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions}}\n\nSeveral methods to describe orientations of a rigid body in three dimensions have been developed. They are summarized in the following sections.\n\n===Euler angles===\n{{Main|Euler angles}}\n[[File:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|150px|Euler angles, one of the possible ways to describe an orientation]]\nThe first attempt to represent an orientation was owed to [[Leonhard Euler]]. He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one around the other, and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and another to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called [[Euler angles]].\n\n====Tait–Bryan angles====\n{{Main|Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles}}\n[[File:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|left|150px|Tait–Bryan angles. Other way for describing orientation]]\nThese are three angles, also known as yaw, pitch and roll, Navigation angles and Cardan angles. Mathematically they constitute a set of six possibilities inside the twelve possible sets of Euler angles, the ordering being the one best used for describing the orientation of a vehicle such as an airplane. In aerospace engineering they are usually referred to as Euler angles.\n\n[[File:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|150px|A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]\n\n===Orientation vector {{anchor|Euler vector|Euler orientation vector}}===\n{{Main|Axis–angle representation}}\nEuler also realized that the composition of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]). Therefore, the composition of the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed.\n\nBased on this fact he introduced a vectorial way to describe any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module equal to the value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector.\n\nA similar method, called [[axis–angle representation]], describes a rotation or orientation using a [[unit vector]] aligned with the rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure).\n\n===Orientation matrix===\n{{Main|Rotation matrix}}\nWith the introduction of matrices, the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an orientation, a rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix.\n\nThe above-mentioned Euler vector is the [[eigenvector]] of a rotation matrix (a rotation matrix has a unique real [[eigenvalue]]). \nThe product of two rotation matrices is the composition of rotations. Therefore, as before, the orientation can be given as the rotation from the initial frame to achieve the frame that we want to describe.\n\nThe [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]] of a non-[[symmetry|symmetrical]] object in ''n''-dimensional space is [[Orthogonal group|SO(''n'')]] [[Product topology|&times;]] [[Euclidean space|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>]]. Orientation may be visualized by attaching a basis of [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] to an object. The direction in which each vector points determines its orientation.\n\n===Orientation quaternion===\n{{Main|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nAnother way to describe rotations is using [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation quaternions]], also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, they can be more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions.\n\n== Plane in three dimensions ==\n\n===Miller indices===\n{{Main|Miller index}}\n[[File:Miller Indices Cubes.svg|thumb|150px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]\nThe attitude of a [[lattice plane]] is the orientation of the line normal to the plane,<ref name=Granville>\n{{cite book |author=William Anthony Granville |title=Elements of the Differential and Integral Calculus |page=275 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0jcAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA275 |chapter=§178 Normal line to a surface |publisher=Ginn & Company |year=1904}}\n\n</ref> and is described by the plane's [[Miller indices]].

By extension, this can be used to transform all three [[basis vector]]s to compute a [[rotation matrix]] in [[Rotation group SO(3)|{{math|SO(3)}}]], the group of all rotation matrices, from an [[axis–angle representation]]. In other words, the Rodrigues' formula provides an algorithm to compute the [[matrix exponential|exponential map]] from {{math|'''so'''(3)}}, the [[Lie algebra]] of {{math|SO(3)}}, to {{math|SO(3)}} without actually computing the full matrix exponential.\n\n==Statement==\nIf {{math|'''v'''}} is a vector in {{math|ℝ<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|'''k'''}} is a [[unit vector]] describing an axis of rotation about which {{math|'''v'''}} rotates by an angle {{mvar|θ}} according to the [[Right hand rule#Direction associated with a rotation|right hand rule]], the Rodrigues formula for the rotated vector {{math|'''v'''<sub>rot</sub>}} is\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =<math>\\mathbf{v}_\\mathrm{rot} = \\mathbf{v} \\cos\\theta + (\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{v})\\sin\\theta + \\mathbf{k} ~(\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) (1 - \\cos\\theta)\\,.</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\n\nAn alternative statement is to write the axis vector as a [[cross product]] {{math|'''a''' × '''b'''}} of any two nonzero vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} which define the plane of rotation, and the sense of the angle {{math|''θ''}} is measured away from {{math|'''a'''}} and towards {{math|'''b'''}}. Letting {{math|''α''}} denote the angle between these vectors, the two angles {{math|''θ''}} and {{math|''α''}} are not necessarily equal, but they are measured in the same sense. Then the unit axis vector can be written\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}|} = \\frac{\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}}{|\\mathbf{a}||\\mathbf{b}|\\sin\\alpha}\\,. </math>\n\nThis form may be more useful when two vectors defining a plane are involved. An example in physics is the [[Thomas precession]] which includes the rotation given by Rodrigues' formula, in terms of two non-collinear boost velocities, and the axis of rotation is perpendicular to their plane.\n\n== Derivation ==\n\n[[Image:Rodrigues-formula.svg|300px|right|thumb|Rodrigues' rotation formula rotates {{math|'''v'''}} by an angle {{math|''θ''}} around vector {{math|''k''}} by decomposing it into its components parallel and perpendicular to {{math|''k''}}, and rotating only the perpendicular component.]] \n[[File:Orthogonal decomposition unit vector rodrigues rotation formula.svg|350px|thumb|Vector geometry of Rodrigues' rotation formula, as well as the decomposition into parallel and perpendicular components.]]\n\nLet {{math|'''k'''}} be a [[unit vector]] defining a rotation axis, and let {{math|'''v'''}} be any vector to rotate about {{math|'''k'''}} by angle {{math|''θ''}} ([[right hand rule]], anticlockwise in the figure).\n\nUsing the [[dot product|dot]] and [[cross product]]s, the vector {{math|'''v'''}} can be decomposed into components parallel and perpendicular to the axis {{math|'''k'''}},\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_\\parallel + \\mathbf{v}_\\perp \\,, </math>\n\nwhere the component parallel to {{math|'''k'''}} is\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{v}_\\parallel = (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}) \\mathbf{k} </math>\n\ncalled the [[vector projection]] of {{math|'''v'''}} on {{math|'''k'''}}, and the component perpendicular to {{math|'''k'''}} is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{v}_{\\parallel} = \\mathbf{v} - (\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\mathbf{k} = - \\mathbf{k}\\times(\\mathbf{k}\\times\\mathbf{v})</math>\n\ncalled the [[vector rejection]] of {{math|'''v'''}} from {{math|'''k'''}}. \n\nThe vector {{math|'''k''' × '''v'''}} can be viewed as a copy of {{math|'''v'''<sub>⊥</sub>}} rotated anticlockwise by 90° about {{math|'''k'''}}, so their magnitudes are equal but directions are perpendicular. Likewise the vector {{math|'''k''' × ('''k''' × '''v''')}} a copy of {{math|'''v'''<sub>⊥</sub>}} rotated anticlockwise through {{math|180°}} about {{math|'''k'''}}, so that {{math|'''k''' × ('''k''' × '''v''')}} and {{math|'''v'''<sub>⊥</sub>}} are equal in magnitude but in opposite directions (i.e. they are negatives of each other, hence the minus sign).

This generates {{math|1=2 {{mvar|s}} + 1}} different values of {{mvar|m}}<sub>{{mvar|s}}</sub>.\n\nThe allowed values for ''s'' are non-negative [[integer]]s or [[half-integer]]s. [[Fermion]]s (such as the [[electron]], [[proton]] or [[neutron]]) have half-integer values, whereas [[boson]]s (e.g., [[photon]], [[meson]]s) have integer spin values.\n\n== Algebra ==\nThe algebraic theory of spin is a carbon copy of the [[Angular momentum#Angular momentum in quantum mechanics|angular momentum in quantum mechanics]] theory.\nFirst of all, spin satisfies the fundamental commutation relation:\n:<math>[S_i, S_j ] = i \\hbar \\epsilon_{ijk} S_k</math>,\n:<math>\\left[S_i, S^2 \\right] = 0</math>\nwhere  ε<sub>lmn</sub> is the (antisymmetric) [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. This means that it is impossible to know two coordinates of the spin at the same time because of the restriction of the [[uncertainty principle]].\n\nNext, the [[Eigenstate|eigenvectors]] of <math>S^2</math> and <math>S_z</math> satisfy:\n:: <math> S^2 | s, m_s \\rangle= {\\hbar}^2 s(s+1) | s, m_s \\rangle </math>\n:: <math> S_z | s, m_s \\rangle = \\hbar m_s | s, m_s \\rangle </math>\n:: <math> S_\\pm | s, m_s \\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{s(s+1)-m_s(m_s \\pm 1)} | s, m_s \\pm 1 \\rangle </math>\nwhere <math> S_\\pm = S_x \\pm i S_y </math> are the [[creation and annihilation operators|creation and annihilation]] (or \"raising\" and \"lowering\" or \"up\" and \"down\") operators.\n\n==History==\nEarly attempts to explain the behavior of electrons in [[atom]]s focused on solving the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]] for the [[hydrogen atom]], the simplest possible case, with a single electron bound to the [[atomic nucleus]].  This was successful in explaining many features of atomic [[Spectroscopy|spectra]].\n\nThe solutions required each possible state of the [[electron]] to be described by three \"quantum numbers\".  These were identified as, respectively, the electron \"shell\" number {{mvar|n}}, the \"orbital\" number {{mvar|l}}, and the \"orbital angular momentum\" number {{mvar|m}}.  [[Angular momentum]] is a so-called \"classical\" concept measuring the [[momentum]]{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} of a mass in circular motion about a point.  The shell numbers start at 1 and increase indefinitely.  Each shell of number {{mvar|n}} contains {{mvar|n}}² orbitals. Each orbital is characterized by its number {{mvar|l}}, where {{mvar|l}} takes integer values from ''0'' to {{mvar|n}}−1, and its angular momentum number {{mvar|m}}, where {{mvar|m}} takes integer values from +{{mvar|l}} to −{{mvar|l}}. By means of a variety of approximations and extensions, physicists were able to extend their work on hydrogen to more complex atoms containing many electrons.\n\nAtomic [[Spectroscopy|spectra]] measure radiation absorbed or emitted by electrons [[atomic electron transition|\"jumping\"]] from one \"state\" to another, where a state is represented by values of {{mvar|n}}, {{mvar|l}}, and {{mvar|m}}.  The so-called \"[[Transition rule]]\" limits what \"jumps\" are possible.  In general, a jump or \"transition\" is allowed only if all three numbers change in the process.  This is because a transition will be able to cause the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation only if it involves a change in the electromagnetic [[dipole]] of the atom.\n\nHowever, it was recognized in the early years of quantum mechanics that atomic [[Spectroscopy|spectra]] measured in an external magnetic field (see [[Zeeman effect]]) cannot be predicted with just {{mvar|n}}, {{mvar|l}}, and {{mvar|m}}.\n\nIn January 1925, when [[Ralph Kronig]] was still a Columbia University PhD student, he first proposed electron spin after hearing [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in Tübingen. [[Werner Heisenberg]] and Pauli immediately hated the idea. They had just ruled out all imaginable actions from quantum mechanics. Now Kronig was proposing to set the electron rotating in space. Pauli especially ridiculed the idea of spin, saying that \"it is indeed very clever but of course has nothing to do with reality\". Faced with such criticism, Kronig decided not to publish his theory and the idea of electron spin had to wait for others to take the credit.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bertolotti|first=Mario|title=The History of the Laser|publisher=CRC Press|volume=|issue=|pages=150–153|doi=|year=2004|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JObDnEtzMJUC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=22 March 2017}}</ref> Ralph Kronig had come up with the idea of electron spin several months before [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]]. Most textbooks credit these two Dutch physicists with the discovery.\n\nPauli subsequently proposed (also in 1925) a new quantum degree of freedom (or [[quantum number]]) with two possible values, in order to resolve inconsistencies between observed molecular spectra and the developing theory of quantum mechanics.\n\nShortly thereafter Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit identified Pauli's new degree of freedom as [[electron]] [[spin (physics)|spin]].\n\n==Electron spin==<!-- This section is linked from [[Caesium]] -->\nThe spin angular momentum is characterized by a quantum number; '''[[spin-½|s = 1/2]]''' specifically for electrons.  In a way analogous to other [[Angular momentum operator|quantized angular momenta]], '''L''', it is possible to obtain an expression for the total spin angular momentum:\n\n:<math>S = \\hbar\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{1}{2}+1 \\right) } = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\hbar</math>\n\nwhere\n: <math>\\hbar</math> is the [[reduced Planck constant]].\n\nThe hydrogen spectra fine structure is observed as a doublet corresponding to two possibilities for the ''z''-component of the angular momentum, where for any given direction&nbsp;''z'':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{S_z} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}\\hbar</math>\n\nwhose solution has only two possible ''z''-components for the electron.  In the electron, the two different spin orientations are sometimes called \"spin-up\" or \"spin-down\".\n\nThe spin property of an electron would give rise to [[magnetic moment]], which was a requisite for the fourth quantum number. The electron spin magnetic moment is given by the formula:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\mu_s} = -\\frac{e}{2m}gS</math>\n\nwhere\n:{{mvar|e}} is the charge of the electron\n:{{mvar|g}} is the [[Landé g-factor]]\n\nand by the equation:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{\\mu_z} = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}g{\\mu_B}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu_B</math> is the [[Bohr magneton]].\n\nWhen atoms have even numbers of electrons the spin of each electron in each orbital has opposing orientation to that of its immediate neighbor(s). However, many atoms have an odd number of electrons or an arrangement of electrons in which there is an unequal number of \"spin-up\" and \"spin-down\" orientations. These atoms or electrons are said to have unpaired spins that are detected in [[electron spin resonance]].\n\n== Detection of spin ==\nWhen lines of the hydrogen spectrum are examined at very high resolution, they are found to be closely spaced doublets. This splitting is called fine structure, and was one of the first experimental evidences for electron spin. The direct observation of the electron's intrinsic angular momentum was achieved in the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]].\n\n=== The Stern–Gerlach experiment ===\nThe theory of spatial quantization of the spin moment of the momentum of electrons of atoms situated in the [[magnetic field]] needed to be proved experimentally. In [[1920 in science|1920]] (two years before the theoretical description of the spin was created) [[Otto Stern]] and [[Walter Gerlach]] observed it in the experiment they conducted.\n\n[[Silver]] atoms were evaporated using an electric furnace in a vacuum. Using thin slits, the atoms were guided into a flat beam and the beam sent through an in-homogeneous magnetic field before colliding with a metallic plate. The laws of classical  physics predict that the collection of condensed silver atoms on the plate should form a thin solid line in the same shape as the original beam. However, the in-homogeneous magnetic field caused the beam to split in two separate directions, creating two lines on the metallic plate.\n\nThe phenomenon can be explained with the spatial quantization of the spin moment of momentum. In atoms the electrons are paired such that one spins upward and one downward, neutralizing the effect of their spin on the action of the atom as a whole. But in the valence shell of silver atoms, there is a single electron whose spin remains unbalanced.\n\nThe unbalanced spin creates [[spin magnetic moment]], making the electron act like a very small magnet. As the atoms pass through the in-homogeneous magnetic field, the [[force moment]] in the magnetic field influences the electron's dipole until its position matches the direction of the stronger field. The atom would then be pulled toward or away from the stronger magnetic field a specific amount, depending on the value of the valence electron's spin. When the spin of the electron is +1/2 the atom moves away from the stronger field, and when the spin is −1/2 the atom moves toward it. Thus the beam of silver atoms is split while traveling through the in-homogeneous magnetic field, according to the spin of each atom's valence electron.\n\nIn [[1927 in science|1927]] Phipps and Taylor conducted a similar experiment, using atoms of [[hydrogen]] with similar results.  Later scientists conducted experiments using other atoms that have only one electron in their valence shell: ([[copper]], [[gold]], [[sodium]], [[potassium]]). Every time there were two lines formed on the metallic plate.\n\nThe [[atomic nucleus]] also may have spin, but protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons (about 1836 times), and the magnetic dipole moment is inversely proportional to the mass. So the nuclear magnetic dipole momentum is much smaller than that of the whole atom. This small magnetic dipole was later measured by Stern, Frisch and Easterman.\n\n== Energy levels from the Dirac equation ==\n\nIn 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] developed a [[relativistic wave equation]], now termed the [[Dirac equation]], which predicted the [[spin magnetic moment]] correctly, and at the same time treated the electron as a point-like particle. Solving the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[energy level]]s of an electron in the hydrogen atom, all four quantum numbers including {{mvar|s}} occurred naturally and agreed well with experiment.\n\n== Total spin of an atom or molecule ==\n\nFor some atoms the spins of several unpaired electrons (s<sub>1</sub>, s<sub>2</sub>, ...) are coupled to form a ''total spin'' quantum number S.<ref name=Merzbacher>[[Eugen Merzbacher|Merzbacher E.]], ''Quantum Mechanics'' (3rd ed., John Wiley 1998) p.430-1 {{ISBN|0-471-88702-1}}</ref><ref name=Atkins>[[Peter Atkins|Atkins P.]] and de Paula J.

Here L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number.<ref name=Atkins />\n\nFor atoms with a well-defined S, the [[Multiplicity (chemistry)|multiplicity]] of a state is defined as (2S+1). This is equal to the number of different possible values of the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum J for a given (L, S) combination, provided that S ≤ L (the typical case). For example, if S = 1, there are three states which form a [[triplet state|triplet]]. The eigenvalues of S<sub>z</sub> for these three states are +1ħ, 0 and -1ħ.<ref name=Merzbacher /> The [[term symbol]] of an atomic state indicates its values of L, S, and J.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Total angular momentum quantum number]]\n* [[Rotational spectroscopy]]\n* [[Basic quantum mechanics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/spin/spin.html Full treatment of Spin--including origins, evolution of Spin Theory, and details of the Spin equations]\n\n{{Electron configuration navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Atomic physics]]\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Quantum numbers]]\n[[Category:Quantum models]]"

The dynamics of spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} objects cannot be accurately described using [[classical physics]]; they are among the simplest systems which require [[quantum mechanics]] to describe them.  As such, the study of the behavior of spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} systems forms a central part of [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n== Stern–Gerlach experiment ==\n\nThe necessity of introducing half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] goes back experimentally to the results of the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]]. A beam of atoms is run through a strong [[heterogeneous magnetic field]], which then splits into N parts depending on the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms. It was found that for silver atoms, the beam was split in two—the [[ground state]] therefore could not be integral, because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into 3 parts, corresponding to atoms with ''L<sub>z</sub>''&nbsp;= −1, 0, and +1.{{huh|date=December 2018}} The conclusion was that silver atoms had net intrinsic angular momentum of {{sfrac|1|2}}.<ref name=\"Atoms, Molecules 1985\"/>\n\n== General properties ==\n[[File:Spin half angular momentum.svg|260px|thumb|Heuristic depiction of [[spin (physics)|spin]] angular momentum cones for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle.]]\nSpin-{{sfrac|1|2}} objects are all [[fermions]] (a fact explained by the [[spin–statistics theorem]]) and satisfy the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].  Spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles can have a permanent [[magnetic moment]] along the direction of their spin, and this magnetic moment gives rise to [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] interactions that depend on the spin.  One such effect that was important in the discovery of spin is the [[Zeeman effect]], the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field.\n\nUnlike in more complicated quantum mechanical systems, the spin of a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] of just two [[eigenvectors|eigenstates]], or [[eigenspinor]]s. These are traditionally labeled spin up and spin down.  Because of this, the quantum-mechanical spin [[Operator (physics)|operators]] can be represented as simple 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. These matrices are called the [[Pauli matrices]].\n\n[[Creation and annihilation operators]] can be constructed for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} objects; these obey the same [[commutator|commutation]] relations as other [[angular momentum operator]]s.\n\n== Connection to the uncertainty principle ==\n\nOne consequence of the [[uncertainty principle|generalized uncertainty principle]] is that the spin projection operators (which measure the spin along a given direction like ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'') cannot be measured simultaneously.  Physically, this means that it is ill-defined what axis a particle is spinning about. A measurement of the ''z''-component of spin destroys any information about the ''x''- and ''y''-components that might previously have been obtained.\n\n==Mathematical description==\nA spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle is characterized by an [[angular momentum quantum number]] for spin '''s''' of {{sfrac|1|2}}.  In solutions of the [[Schrödinger equation]], angular momentum is quantized according to this number, so that total spin angular momentum\n\n:<math>S = {{\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}+1\\right)}}}\\ \\hbar = \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\hbar .</math>\n\nHowever, the observed [[fine structure]] when the electron is observed along one axis, such as the ''z''-axis, is quantized in terms of a [[magnetic quantum number]], which can be viewed as a quantization of a [[vector component]] of this total angular momentum, which can have only the values of {{nowrap|±{{sfrac|1|2}}''ħ''}}.\n\nNote that these values for angular momentum are functions only of the [[reduced Planck constant]] (the angular momentum of any [[photon]]), with no dependence on mass or charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/spin.html#c3|title=Electron Spin|first=C. R.|last= Nave|publisher=[[Georgia State University]]|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Complex phase ===\n\nMathematically, quantum mechanical spin is not described by a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] as in classical angular momentum. It is described by a complex-valued vector with two components called a [[spinor]]. There are subtle differences between the behavior of spinors and vectors under [[coordinate rotation]]s, stemming from the behavior of a vector space over a complex field.\n\nWhen a spinor is rotated by 360° (one full turn), it transforms to its negative, and then after a further rotation of 360° it transforms back to its initial value again. This is because in quantum theory the state of a particle or system is represented by a complex [[probability amplitude]] ([[wavefunction]]) ''ψ'', and when the system is measured, the probability of finding the system in the state ''ψ'' equals {{nowrap|{{abs|''ψ''}}<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''ψ''*''ψ''}}, the square of the [[absolute value]] of the amplitude. In mathematical terms, the quantum Hilbert space carries a [[projective representation]] of the rotation group SO(3).\n\nSuppose a detector that can be rotated measures a particle in which the probabilities of detecting some state are affected by the rotation of the detector. When the system is rotated through 360°, the observed output and physics are the same as initially but the amplitudes are changed for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle by a factor of [[−1]] or a phase shift of half of 360°. When the probabilities are calculated, the −1 is squared, (−1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp; 1, so the predicted physics is the same as in the starting position. Also, in a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle there are only two spin states and the amplitudes for both change by the same −1 factor, so the interference effects are identical, unlike the case for higher spins. The complex probability amplitudes are something of a theoretical construct which cannot be directly observed.\n\nIf the probability amplitudes rotated by the same amount as the detector, then they would have changed by a factor of −1 when the equipment was rotated by 180° which when squared would predict the same output as at the start, but experiments show this to be wrong. If the detector is rotated by 180°, the result with spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles can be different to what it would be if not rotated, hence the factor of a half is necessary to make the predictions of the theory match the experiments.\n\nIn terms of more direct evidence, physical effects of the difference between the rotation of a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle by 360° as compared with 720° have been experimentally observed in classic experiments <ref name=\"Neutron Interferometry 2015\">{{cite book|title=Neutron Interferometry: Lessons in Experimental Quantum Mechanics, Wave-Particle Duality, and Entanglement |first1= Helmut|last1=Rauch|first2=Samuel A. |last2=Werner|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|date= 2015}}</ref> in neutron interferometry. In particular, if a beam of spin-oriented spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles is split, and just one of the beams is rotated about the axis of its direction of motion and then recombined with the original beam, different interference effects are observed depending on the angle of rotation. In the case of rotation by 360°,  cancellation effects are observed, whereas in the case of rotation by 720°,  the beams are mutually reinforcing.<ref name=\" Neutron Interferometry 2015\"/>\n\n===NRQM (non-relativistic quantum mechanics)===\nThe [[quantum state]] of a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle can be described by a two-component complex-valued vector called a [[spinor]]. Observable states of the particle are then found by the spin operators ''S<sub>x</sub>'', ''S<sub>y</sub>'', and ''S<sub>z</sub>,'' and the total spin operator '''S'''.\n\n====Observables====\nWhen spinors are used to describe the quantum states, the three spin operators (''S<sub>x</sub>'', ''S<sub>y</sub>'', ''S<sub>z</sub>,'') can be described by 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 matrices called the Pauli matrices whose [[eigenvalue]]s are {{nowrap|±{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}.\n\nFor example, the spin projection operator ''S<sub>z</sub>'' affects a measurement of the spin in the ''z'' direction.\n:<math> S_z = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\sigma _z  = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}  \\begin{bmatrix}\n1&0\\\\ 0&-1 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nThe two eigenvalues of ''S<sub>z</sub>'', {{nowrap|±{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}, then correspond to the following eigenspinors:\n\n:<math>\\chi_+ =  \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\left \\vert {s_z = +\\textstyle\\frac 1 2} \\right \\rang = | {\\uparrow  } \\rang = | 0 \\rang </math>\n:<math>\\chi_- =  \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\left \\vert {s_z = -\\textstyle\\frac 1 2} \\right \\rang = | {\\downarrow} \\rang = | 1 \\rang. </math>\n\nThese vectors form a complete basis for the [[Hilbert space]] describing the spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle.  Thus, linear combinations of these two states can represent all possible states of the spin, including in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions.\n\nThe [[ladder operator]]s are:\n:<math> S_+ = \\hbar  \\begin{bmatrix} 0&1\\\\ 0&0 \\end{bmatrix},\nS_-= \\hbar  \\begin{bmatrix} 0&0\\\\ 1&0 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nSince {{nowrap|''S''<sub>±</sub> {{=}}''S<sub>x</sub>'' ± ''i S<sub>y</sub>''}}, {{nowrap|''S<sub>x</sub>'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}(''S''<sub>+</sub> + ''S''<sub>−</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|''S<sub>y</sub>'' {{=}}{{sfrac|1|2''i''}}(''S''<sub>+</sub> − ''S''<sub>−</sub>)}}.

Let <math> \\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2</math> be the corresponding measured directions of the reference unit vectors as resolved in a body fixed frame of reference. Then they are related by the equations,\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math> \n\\vec{R}_i = A \\vec{r}_i \n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nfor <math> i = 1,2 </math>, where <math> A </math> is a rotation matrix (sometimes also known as a proper [[orthogonal matrix]], i.e., <math>A^{T}A = I, det(A) = +1 </math>). <math> A </math> transforms vectors in the body fixed frame into the frame of the reference vectors. Among other properties, rotational matrices preserve the length of the vector they operate on. Note that the direction cosine matrix <math> A </math> also transforms the cross product vector, written as,\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math> \n\\vec{R}_1 \\times \\vec{R}_2 = A \\left( \\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_2 \\right)\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nTriad proposes an estimate of the direction cosine matrix <math> A </math> as a solution to the linear system equations given by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\left[ \\vec{R}_1 ~\\vdots~ \\vec{R}_2 ~\\vdots~ \\left(\\vec{R}_1 \\times \\vec{R}_2 \\right) \\right] = A \\left[ \\vec{r}_1 ~\\vdots~ \\vec{r}_2 ~\\vdots~ \\left( \\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_2 \\right) \\right]\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nwhere <math> \\vdots </math> have been used to separate different column vectors.\n\nThe solution presented above works well in the noise-free case. However, in practice, <math> \\vec{r}_1, \\vec{r}_2 </math> are noisy and the orthogonality condition of the attitude matrix (or the direction cosine matrix) is not preserved by the above procedure. Triad incorporates the following elegant procedure to redress this problem. To this end, we define unit vectors\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\hat{S} = \\frac{\\vec{R}_1}{|| \\vec{R}_1||} \n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\hat{s} = \\frac{\\vec{r}_1}{||\\vec{r}_1||}\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nand\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\hat{M} = \\frac{\\vec{R}_1 \\times \\vec{R}_2}{|| \\vec{R}_1 \\times \\vec{R}_2 ||} \n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\hat{m} = \\frac{\\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_2 }{||\\vec{r}_1 \\times \\vec{r}_2 ||}\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nto be used in place of the first two columns of ({{EquationNote|3}}). Their cross product is used as the third column in the linear system of equations obtaining a proper orthogonal matrix for the spacecraft attitude given by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\left[ \\hat{S} ~ \\vdots ~ \\hat{M} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{S} \\times \\hat{M} \\right] = A \\left[ \\hat{s} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{m} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{s} \\times \\hat{m} \\right]\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|8}}}}\n\nWhile the normalizations of Equations ({{EquationNote|4}}) - ({{EquationNote|7}}) are not necessary, they have been carried out to achieve a computational advantage in solving the linear system of equations in ({{EquationNote|8}}). Thus an estimate of the spacecraft attitude is given by the proper orthogonal matrix as \n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\hat{A} = \\left[ \\hat{S} ~ \\vdots ~ \\hat{M} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{S} \\times \\hat{M} \\right] \\left[ \\hat{s} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{m} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{s} \\times \\hat{m} \\right]^T.\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|9}}}}\nNote that computational efficiency has been achieved in this procedure by replacing the matrix inverse with a transpose. This is possible because the matrices involved in computing attitude are each composed of a triad of [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]] basis vectors. \"TRIAD\" derives its name from this observation.\n\n==Triad Attitude Matrix and Handed-ness of Measurements==\nIt is of consequence to note that the Triad method always produces a proper orthogonal matrix irrespective of the handedness of the reference and body vectors employed in the estimation process. This can be shown as follows.\nLet us re-write  Eq. ({{EquationNote|8}}) in a matrix form given by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\n\\Gamma = A \\Delta\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|10}}}}\n\nwhere  <math>\n\\Gamma := \\left[ \\hat{S} ~ \\vdots ~ \\hat{M} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{S} \\times \\hat{M} \\right]\n</math>\nand \n<math>\n\\Delta = \\left[ \\hat{s} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{m} ~\\vdots~ \\hat{s} \\times \\hat{m} \\right].\n</math>\nNote that if the columns of <math> \\Gamma </math> form a left handed triad, then the columns of <math> \\Delta </math> are also left handed because of the one-one correspondence between the vectors. This is because of the simple fact that, in Euclidean geometry, the angle between any two vectors remains invariant to coordinate transformations. Therefore, the determinant <math> det \\left( \\Gamma \\right) </math> is <math> 1 </math> or <math> -1 </math> depending on whether its columns are right or left - handed respectively (similarly, <math> \\Delta  = \\pm 1</math> ). Taking determinant on both sides of the relation in Eq. ({{EquationNote|10}}), we conclude that \n{{NumBlk|:|\n<math>\ndet \\left( A \\right) = 1.\n</math>\n|{{EquationRef|11}}}}\nThis is quite useful in practical applications since the analyst is always guaranteed a proper orthogonal matrix irrespective of the nature of the reference and measured vector quantities.\n\n==Applications==\nTriad was used as an attitude determination technique to process the telemetry data from the Transit satellite system (used by the U.S. Navy for navigation). The principles of the Transit system gave rise to the global positioning system satellite constellation. In an application problem, the reference vectors are usually known directions (e.g., stars, Earth magnetic field, gravity vector, etc.). Body fixed vectors are the measured directions as observed by an on-board sensor (e.g., star tracker, magnetometer, etc.). With advances in micro-electronics, attitude determination algorithms such as Triad have found their place in a variety of devices (e.g., smart phones, cars, tablets, UAVs etc.) with a broad impact on the modern society.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attitude dynamics and control|Attitude Dynamics and Control]]\n*[[Orientation (geometry)|Orientation (Geometry)]]\n* [[Wahba's problem]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft attitude control]]\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]"

      "text": "{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]\n\n'''Precession''' is a change in the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of the rotational axis of a [[rotation|rotating]] body. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the first [[Euler angles|Euler angle]], whereas the third Euler angle defines the [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotation itself]]. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called ''[[nutation]]''. In [[physics]], there are two types of precession: [[torque]]-free and torque-induced.\n\nIn astronomy, ''precession'' refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body's rotational or orbital parameters. An important example is the steady change in the orientation of the axis of rotation of the [[Earth]], known as the [[axial precession|precession of the equinoxes]].\n\n==Torque-free==\nTorque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In torque-free precession, the [[angular momentum]] is a constant, but the [[angular velocity]] vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying [[moment of inertia]], or more precisely, a time-varying [[Moment of inertia#The inertia tensor|inertia matrix]]. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate [[Basis (linear algebra)|coordinate axes]] (e.g. {{math|''x''}}, {{math|''y''}}, {{math|''z''}}). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the [[Vector component#Decomposition|component]] of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis' moment of inertia.\n\nThe torque-free precession rate of an object with an axis of symmetry, such as a disk, spinning about an axis not aligned with that axis of symmetry can be calculated as follows:<ref>{{Citation\n| last       =Schaub\n| first      =Hanspeter\n| year       =2003\n| title      =Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems\n| publisher  =AIAA\n| isbn       =9781600860270\n| pages      =149–150\n| url        =https://books.google.com/books?id=qXvESNWrfpUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Hanspeter+Schaub%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lohrU6KFIq7NsQT80IHwAw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false\n| accessdate =1 May 2014\n}}</ref>\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\omega_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\boldsymbol I_\\mathrm{s} \\boldsymbol\\omega_\\mathrm{s} } {\\boldsymbol I_\\mathrm{p} \\cos(\\boldsymbol \\alpha)}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''''ω'''''<sub>p</sub>}} is the precession rate, {{math|'''''ω'''''<sub>s</sub>}} is the spin rate about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''<sub>s</sub>}} is the moment of inertia about the axis of symmetry, {{math|'''''I'''''<sub>p</sub>}} is moment of inertia about either of the other two equal perpendicular principal axes, and {{math|'''''α'''''}} is the angle between the moment of inertia direction and the symmetry axis.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = https://www.sfu.ca/~boal/211lecs/211lec26.pdf\n| title = Lecture 26 – Torque-free rotation – body-fixed axes\n| first = David\n| last = Boal\n| year = 2001 \n| accessdate = 2008-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\nWhen an object is not perfectly [[solid]], internal [[vortices]] will tend to damp torque-free precession, and the rotation axis will align itself with one of the inertia axes of the body.\n\nFor a generic solid object without any axis of symmetry, the evolution of the object's orientation, represented (for example) by a rotation matrix {{math|'''''R'''''}} that transforms internal to external coordinates, may be numerically simulated. Given the object's fixed internal [[moment of inertia tensor]] {{math|'''''I'''''<sub>0</sub>}} and fixed external angular momentum {{math|'''''L'''''}}, the instantaneous angular velocity is\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\omega\\left(\\boldsymbol R\\right) = \\boldsymbol R \\boldsymbol I_0^{-1} \\boldsymbol R ^T \\boldsymbol L</math>\nPrecession occurs by repeatedly recalculating {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and applying a small [[Rotation representation (mathematics)#Euler axis and angle .28rotation vector.29|rotation vector]] {{math|'''''ω''' dt''}} for the short time {{math|''dt''}}; e.g.:\n:<math>\\boldsymbol R_\\text{new} = \\exp\\left(\\left[\\boldsymbol\\omega\\left(\\boldsymbol R_\\text{old}\\right)\\right]_{\\times} dt\\right) \\boldsymbol R_\\text{old}</math>\nfor the [[Cross product#Conversion to matrix multiplication|skew-symmetric matrix]] {{math|['''''ω''''']<sub>×</sub>}}. The errors induced by finite time steps tend to increase the rotational kinetic energy:\n:<math>E\\left(\\boldsymbol R\\right) = \\boldsymbol \\omega\\left(\\boldsymbol R\\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\boldsymbol L }{ 2}</math>\nthis unphysical tendency can be counteracted by repeatedly applying a small rotation vector {{math|'''''v'''''}} perpendicular to both {{math|'''''ω'''''}} and {{math|'''''L'''''}}, noting that\n:<math>E\\left(\\exp\\left(\\left[\\boldsymbol v\\right]_{\\times}\\right) \\boldsymbol R\\right) \\approx E\\left(\\boldsymbol R\\right) + \\left(\\boldsymbol \\omega\\left(\\boldsymbol R\\right) \\times \\boldsymbol L\\right) \\cdot \\boldsymbol v</math>\n\nAnother type of torque-free precession can occur when there are multiple reference frames at work. For example, Earth is subject to local torque induced precession due to the gravity of the Sun and Moon acting on Earth's axis, but at the same time the Solar System is moving around the galactic center. As a consequence, an accurate measurement of Earth's axial reorientation relative to objects outside the frame of the moving galaxy (such as distant quasars commonly used as precession measurement reference points) must account for a minor amount of non-local torque-free precession, due to the Solar System's motion.\n\n==Torque-induced==\nTorque-induced precession ('''gyroscopic precession''') is the phenomenon in which the [[axis of rotation|axis]] of a spinning object (e.g., a [[gyroscope]]) describes a [[Cone (geometry)|cone]] in space when an external [[torque]] is applied to it. The phenomenon is commonly seen in a [[spinning top|spinning toy top]], but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the [[speed]] of the rotation and the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at [[right angle]]s to the [[Direction (geometry, geography)|direction]] that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the [[normal force]] (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on it at the point of contact with the support. These two opposite forces produce a torque which causes the top to precess.\n\n[[Image:Gyroscopic precession 256x256.png|frame|right|The response of a rotating system to an applied torque. When the device swivels, and some roll is added, the wheel tends to pitch.]]\nThe device depicted on the right (or above on mobile devices) is [[gimbal]] mounted. From inside to outside there are three axes of rotation: the hub of the wheel, the gimbal axis, and the vertical pivot.\n\nTo distinguish between the two horizontal axes, rotation around the wheel hub will be called ''spinning'', and rotation around the gimbal axis will be called ''pitching''.  Rotation around the vertical pivot axis is called ''rotation''.\n\nFirst, imagine that the entire device is rotating around the (vertical) pivot axis. Then, spinning of the wheel (around the wheelhub) is added. Imagine the gimbal axis to be locked, so that the wheel cannot pitch. The gimbal axis has sensors, that measure whether there is a [[torque]] around the gimbal axis.\n\nIn the picture, a section of the wheel has been named {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}}. At the depicted moment in time, section {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}} is at the [[perimeter]] of the rotating motion around the (vertical) pivot axis. Section {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}}, therefore, has a lot of angular rotating [[velocity]] with respect to the rotation around the pivot axis, and as {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}} is forced closer to the pivot axis of the rotation (by the wheel spinning further), because of the [[Coriolis effect]], with respect to the vertical pivot axis, {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}} tends to move in the direction of the top-left arrow in the diagram (shown at 45°) in the direction of rotation around the pivot axis.<ref name=\"Teodorescu\">{{cite book\n | last = Teodorescu\n | first = Petre P\n | authorlink = \n | title = Mechanical Systems, Classical Models\n | publisher = Springer\n | series =\n | volume =\n | edition =\n | date = 2002\n | location =\n | pages = 420 \n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=aXCBlHOtO3kC&pg=PA396&lpg=PA396&dq=gyroscope+%22inertial+forces%22&source=bl&ots=wI6O4MXsZa&sig=8UvIyH2dc8lVJOz8d0AkdUtfdvw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ntNFVIHjM4vt8AW594KICQ&ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=gyroscope%20%22inertial%20forces%22&f=false\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = \n | mr =\n | zbl =\n | jfm = }}</ref>  Section {{math|''dm''<sub>2</sub>}} of the wheel is moving away from the pivot axis, and so a force (again, a Coriolis force) acts in the same direction as in the case of {{math|''dm''<sub>1</sub>}}. Note that both arrows point in the same direction.\n\nThe same reasoning applies for the bottom half of the wheel, but there the arrows point in the opposite direction to that of the top arrows. Combined over the entire wheel, there is a torque around the gimbal axis when some spinning is added to rotation around a vertical axis.\n\nIt is important to note that the torque around the gimbal axis arises without any delay; the response is instantaneous.\n\nIn the discussion above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In the case of a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity – via the pitching motion – elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.\n\nPrecession or gyroscopic considerations have an effect on [[bicycle]] performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind [[gyrocompass]]es.\n\n===Classical (Newtonian)===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n[[Image:PrecessionOfATop.svg|thumb|right|300px|The [[torque]] caused by the normal force – {{math|'''F'''<sub>g</sub>}} and the weight of the top causes a change in the [[angular momentum]] {{math|'''L'''}} in the direction of that torque. This causes the top to precess.]]\n\nPrecession is the change of [[angular velocity]] and [[angular momentum]] produced by a torque. The general equation that relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum is:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{L}}{\\mathrm{d}t}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\boldsymbol{\\tau}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> are the torque and angular momentum vectors respectively.\n\nDue to the way the torque vectors are defined, it is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the forces that create it. Thus it may be seen that the angular momentum vector will change perpendicular to those forces. Depending on how the forces are created, they will often rotate with the angular momentum vector, and then circular precession is created.\n\nUnder these circumstances the angular velocity of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\omega_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{\\ mgr}{I_\\mathrm{s}\\boldsymbol\\omega_\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{ \\tau}{I_\\mathrm{s}\\boldsymbol\\omega_\\mathrm{s}}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''I''<sub>s</sub>}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|'''''ω'''''<sub>s</sub>}} is the angular velocity of spin about the spin axis, {{math|''m''}} is the mass, {{math|''g''}} is the acceleration due to gravity and {{math|''r''}} is the perpendicular distance of the spin axis about the axis of precession.  The torque vector originates at the center of mass. Using {{math|'''''ω''''' {{=}} {{sfrac|2π|''T''}}}}, we find that the [[Frequency|period]] of precession is given by:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n:<math>T_\\mathrm{p} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 I_\\mathrm{s}}{\\ mgrT_\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{4\\pi^2 I_\\mathrm{s}}{\\ \\tau T_\\mathrm{s}}</math>\n\nWhere {{math|''I''<sub>s</sub>}} is the [[moment of inertia]], {{math|''T''<sub>s</sub>}} is the period of spin about the spin axis, and {{math|'''''τ'''''}} is the [[torque]]<!-- Torque is not introduced -->. In general, the problem is more complicated than this, however.\n\nThere is an easy way to understand why gyroscopic precession occurs without using any mathematics. The behavior of a spinning object simply obeys laws of inertia by resisting any change in direction. A spinning object possesses a property known as rigidity in space, meaning the spin axis resists any change in orientation. It is the inertia of matter comprising the object as it resists any change in direction that provides this property. Of course, the direction this matter travels constantly changes as the object spins, but any further change in direction is resisted. If a force is applied to the surface of a spinning disc, for example, matter experiences no change in direction at the place the force was applied (or 180 degrees from that place). But 90 degrees before and 90 degrees after that place, matter is forced to change direction. This causes the object to behave as if the force was applied at those places instead. When a force is applied to anything, the object exerts an equal force back but in the opposite direction. Since no actual force was applied 90 degrees before or after, nothing prevents the reaction from taking place, and the object causes itself to move in response. A good way to visualize why this happens is to imagine the spinning object to be a large hollow doughnut filled with water, as described in the book ''Thinking Physics'' by Lewis Epstein. The doughnut is held still while water circulates inside it. As the force is applied, the water inside is caused to change direction 90 degrees before and after that point. The water then exerts its own force against the inner wall of the doughnut and causes the doughnut to rotate as if the force was applied 90 degrees ahead in the direction of rotation. Epstein exaggerates the vertical and horizontal motion of the water by changing the shape of the doughnut from round to square with rounded corners.\n\nNow imagine the object to be a spinning bicycle wheel, held at both ends of its axle in the hands of a subject. The wheel is spinning clock-wise as seen from a viewer to the subject's right. Clock positions on the wheel are given relative to this viewer. As the wheel spins, the molecules comprising it are traveling exactly horizontal and to the right the instant they pass the 12-o'clock position. They then travel vertically downward the instant they pass 3 o'clock, horizontally to the left at 6 o'clock, vertically upward at 9 o’clock and horizontally to the right again at 12 o'clock. Between these positions, each molecule travels components of these directions. Now imagine the viewer applying a force to the rim of the wheel at 12 o’clock. For this example's sake, imagine the wheel tilting over when this force is applied; it tilts to the left as seen from the subject holding it at its axle. As the wheel tilts to its new position, molecules at 12 o’clock (where the force was applied) as well as those at 6 o’clock, still travel horizontally; their direction did not change as the wheel was tilting. Nor is their direction different after the wheel settles in its new position; they still move horizontally the instant they pass 12 and 6 o’clock. BUT, molecules passing 3 and 9 o’clock were forced to change direction. Those at 3 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight downward, to downward and to the right as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. Molecules passing 9 o’clock were forced to change from moving straight upward, to upward and to the left. This change in direction is resisted by the inertia of those molecules. And when they experience this change in direction, they exert an equal and opposite force in response AT THOSE LOCATIONS-3 AND 9 O’CLOCK. At 3 o’clock, where they were forced to change from moving straight down to downward and to the right, they exert their own equal and opposite reactive force to the left. At 9 o’clock, they exert their own reactive force to the right, as viewed from the subject holding the wheel. This makes the wheel as a whole react by momentarily rotating counter-clockwise as viewed from directly above. Thus, as the force was applied at 12 o’clock, the wheel behaved as if that force was applied at 3 o’clock, which is 90 degrees ahead in the direction of spin. Or, you can say it behaved as if a force from the opposite direction was applied at 9 o'clock, 90 degrees prior to the direction of spin.\n\nIn summary, when you apply a force to a spinning object to change the direction of its spin axis, you are not changing the direction of the matter comprising the object at the place you applied the force (nor at 180 degrees from it); matter experiences zero change in direction at those places. Matter experiences the maximum change in direction 90 degrees before and 90 degrees beyond that place, and lesser amounts closer to it. The equal and opposite reaction that occurs 90 degrees before and after then causes the object to behave as it does. This principle is demonstrated in helicopters. Helicopter controls are rigged so that inputs to them are transmitted to the rotor blades at points 90 degrees prior to and 90 degrees beyond the point at which the change in aircraft attitude is desired. The effect is dramatically felt on motorcycles. A motorcycle will suddenly lean and turn in the opposite direction the handle bars are turned.\n\nGyro precession causes another phenomenon for spinning objects such as the bicycle wheel in this scenario. If the subject holding the wheel removes a hand from one end of its axle, the wheel will not topple over, but will remain upright, supported at just the other end. However, it will immediately take on an additional motion; it will begin to rotate about a vertical axis, pivoting at the point of support as it continues spinning. If you allowed the wheel to continue rotating, you would have to turn your body in the same direction as the wheel rotated. If the wheel was not spinning, it would obviously topple over and fall when one hand is removed. The initial action of the wheel beginning to topple over is equivalent to applying a force to it at 12 o'clock in the direction toward the unsupported side (or a force at 6 o’clock toward the supported side). When the wheel is spinning, the sudden lack of support at one end of its axle is equivalent to this same force. So, instead of toppling over, the wheel behaves as if a continuous force is being applied to it at 3 or 9 o’clock, depending on the direction of spin and which hand was removed. This causes the wheel to begin pivoting at the one supported end of its axle while remaining upright. Although it pivots at that point, it does so only because of the fact that it is supported there; the actual axis of precessional rotation is located vertically through the wheel, passing through its center of mass. Also, this explanation does not account for the effect of variation in the speed of the spinning object; it only illustrates how the spin axis behaves due to precession. More correctly, the object behaves according to the balance of all forces based on the magnitude of the applied force, mass and rotational speed of the object. Once it is visualized why the wheel remains upright and rotates, it can easily be seen why the axis of a spinning top slowly rotates while the top spins as shown in the illustration on this page. A top behaves exactly like the bicycle wheel due to the force of gravity pulling downward. The point of contact with the surface it spins on is equivalent to the end of the axle the wheel is supported at. As the top's spin slows, the reactive force that keeps it upright due to inertia is overcome by gravity. Once the reason for gyro precession is visualized, the mathematical formulas start to make sense.\n\n===Relativistic (Einsteinian) ===\nThe special and general theories of [[Theory of relativity|relativity]] give three types of corrections to the Newtonian precession, of a gyroscope near a large mass such as Earth, described above. They are:\n* [[Thomas precession]] a special relativistic correction accounting for the observer's being in a rotating non-inertial frame.\n* [[Geodetic effect|de Sitter precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the Schwarzschild metric of curved space near a large non-rotating mass.\n* [[Lense–Thirring precession]] a general relativistic correction accounting for the frame dragging by the Kerr metric of curved space near a large rotating mass.\n\n== Astronomy ==\n\nIn astronomy, precession refers to any of several gravity-induced, slow and continuous changes in an astronomical body's rotational axis or orbital path. Precession of the equinoxes, perihelion precession, changes in the [[Axial tilt#Earth|tilt of Earth's axis]] to its orbit, and the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of its orbit over tens of thousands of years are all important parts of the astronomical theory of [[ice age]]s. ''(See [[Milankovitch cycles]].)''\n\n=== Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes) ===\n{{Main|Axial precession}}\n\nAxial precession is the movement of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the ''precession of the equinoxes'', ''lunisolar precession'', or ''precession of the equator''. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both [[equatorial coordinates]] and [[ecliptic longitude]]. Over this cycle, Earth's north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of [[Polaris]], in a circle around the [[ecliptic pole]], with an angular radius of about 23.5°.\n\nThe [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek astronomer]] [[Hipparchus]] (c. 190–120 BC) is generally accepted to be the earliest known astronomer to recognize and assess the precession of the equinoxes at about 1° per century (which is not far from the actual value for antiquity, 1.38°),<ref>{{cite book |last=Barbieri |first=Cesare |authorlink= |title=Fundamentals of Astronomy |url= |accessdate= |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7503-0886-1 |page=71 }}</ref> although there is some minor dispute about whether he was.<ref>{{cite book\n |last = Swerdlow\n |first = Noel\n |authorlink = \n |title = On the cosmical mysteries of Mithras\n |publisher = Classical Philology, 86, (1991), 48-63\n |series =\n |volume =\n |edition =\n |date = 1991\n |location =\n |pages = 59\n |url =\n |doi =\n |id =\n |isbn = \n}}</ref> In [[ancient China]], the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin-dynasty]] scholar-official [[Yu Xi]] (fl. 307-345 AD) made a similar discovery centuries later, noting that the position of the Sun during the [[winter solstice]] had drifted roughly one degree over the course of fifty years relative to the position of the stars.<ref>Sun, Kwok.

The torque exerted by the planets, particularly [[Jupiter]], also plays a role.<ref name=\"Bradt\">\n{{cite book\n |last = Bradt\n |first = Hale\n |authorlink = \n |title = Astronomy Methods\n |publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n |series =\n |volume =\n |edition =\n |date = 2007\n |location =\n |pages = 66\n |url =\n |doi =\n |id =\n |isbn = 978 0 521 53551 9\n}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align= center\n |width1= 158\n |width2= 308\n |width3= 180\n |alt3=Small white disks representing the northern stars on a black background, overlaid by a circle showing the position of the north pole over time \n |image1=Earth precession.svg\n |image2=Equinox path.png\n |image3=Precession N.gif\n |footer=Precessional movement of the axis (left), precession of the equinox in relation to the distant stars (middle), and the path of the north celestial pole among the stars due to the precession.

This is called perihelion precession or [[apsidal precession]].\n\nIn the adjunct image, Earth's apsidal precession is illustrated. As the Earth travels around the Sun, its elliptical orbit rotates gradually over time. The eccentricity of its ellipse and the precession rate of its orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and nearly stationary.\n\nDiscrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and that predicted by [[classical mechanics]] were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[Theory of Relativity]] (in particular, his [[General relativity|General Theory of Relativity]]), which accurately predicted the anomalies.<ref>[[Max Born]] (1924), ''Einstein's Theory of Relativity'' (The 1962 Dover edition, page 348 lists a table documenting the observed and calculated values for the precession of the perihelion of Mercury, Venus, and Earth.)</ref><ref>[http://www.dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2008/03/18-billion-suns.html An even larger value for a precession has been found, for a black hole in orbit around a much more massive black hole, amounting to 39 degrees each orbit.]</ref> Deviating from Newton's law, Einstein's theory of gravitation predicts an extra term of {{math|{{sfrac|''A''|''r''<sup>4</sup>}}}}, which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43″ every 100 years.\n\nThe gravitational forces due to the Sun and the Moon induce the precession in the terrestrial orbit. This precession is the major cause of the climate oscillation on the Earth having a period of 19,000 to 23,000 years. It follows that the changes in Earth's orbital parameters (e.g., orbital inclination, the angle between Earth's rotation axis and its plane of orbit) are important for the study of Earth's climate, in particular for the study of past ice ages.\n\n===Nodal precession===\n{{main|Nodal precession}}\n[[Orbital node]]s also [[nodal precession|precess]] over time.\n\n{{for|the precession of the Moon's orbit|lunar precession}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Larmor precession]]\n*[[Nutation]]\n*[[Polar motion]]\n*[[Precession (mechanical)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikibooks|Rotational Motion}}\n*{{Commonscat-inline}}\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/top.html Explanation and derivation of formula for precession of a top]\n*[http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sprecess.htm Precession and the Milankovich theory] [http://www.phy6.org/stargaze/Sintro.htm From Stargazers to Starships]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Precession| ]]\n[[Category:Earth]]\n[[Category:Dynamics (mechanics)]]"

Non-spherical mass effects are caused by the application of external potential(s): the centrifugal potential of spinning bodies like the spinning of pizza dough causes flattening between the poles and the gravity of a nearby mass raises tidal bulges.

Archeoastronomers in general do not 'believe' in astrology, but they study the cultural traditions of societies that did refer extensively to astrology.\n# Astrologers have been interested in relating world history to the astrological ages since the late 19th century;<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 117</ref> however, most astrologers study horoscopes, not astrological ages.\n# The general public has become aware of the Age of Aquarius since it was publicized in the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, pp. 124–5</ref>\n\n===Contentious aspects of the astrological ages===\nDefinitive details on the astrological ages are lacking, and consequently most details available about the astrological ages are disputed. The 20th century British astrologer [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] stated that\n\n<blockquote>\n\"''It is probable that there is no branch of Astrology upon which more nonsense has been poured forth than the doctrine of the precession of the equinoxes.''\" ([[precession of the equinoxes]] as the root cause of the astrological ages)<ref>Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, Bournemouth, Great Britain, 1999, p. 485</ref>\n</blockquote> In 2000 Neil Spencer in his book ''True as the Stars Above'' expressed a similar opinion about the astrological ages. Spencer singles out the astrological ages as being \"fuzzy\", \"speculative\", and the least-defined area of astrological lore.<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above - Adventures in Modern Astrology'', Victor Gollancz, London, 2000, p. 115</ref> Derek and Julia Parker claim that it is impossible to state the exact date for the start of any astrological age and acknowledge that many astrologers believe the Age of Aquarius has arrived while many claim the world is at the end of the Age of Pisces.<ref>Derek & Julia Parker, Parkers' Encyclopedia of astrology, Watkins Publishing, London, 2009, p. 3</ref>\n\nRay Grasse states in ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'' that \"there is considerable dispute over the exact starting and ending times for the different Great Ages.\"<ref>Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, p. 5</ref> Paul Wright in ''The Great Ages and Other Astrological Cycles'' believes that much of the uncertainty related to the astrological ages is because many astrologers have a poor understanding of the meaning of the astrological symbolism and \"even poorer historical knowledge\".<ref>Paul Wright, ''The Great Ages and other astrological cycles'', Parlando Press, Edinburgh, 2007, p. 8</ref>\n\n===Consensus approach to the astrological ages===\nThough so many issues are contentious or disputed, there are two aspects of the astrological ages that have virtually unanimous consensus—firstly, the claimed link of the astrological ages to the axial precession of the Earth and commonly referred to as ''precession of the equinoxes'';<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 116</ref> secondly, that, due to the nature of the precession of the equinoxes, the progression of the ages proceeds in reverse direction through the zodiacal signs.<ref>Terry MacKinnell, ''A New Look at the Old Ages'', NCGR Member Newsletter, National Council for Geocosmic Research Inc., June–July 2002, p. 10</ref>\n\n===Ages of equal or variable lengths===\nAstrologers use many ways to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages. There are two popular methods. One method is to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages of approximately equal lengths of around 2160 years per age based on the [[vernal equinox]] moving through the [[sidereal zodiac]].<ref>[[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]], ''An Introduction to Political Astrology (Mundane Astrology)'', The Camelot Press, Great Britain, 1973, p. 74</ref> Another method is to significantly vary the duration of each astrological age based on the passage of the [[vernal equinox]] measured against the actual [[zodiacal constellations]].<ref>Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, 1999, p. 489 clearly refers to both conventions adopted by many astrologers basing the Ages on either the zodiacal constellations or the sidereal signs.</ref> Each of those twelve sections of the Great Year can be called either an astrological age, Precessional Age or a Great Month.<ref>Marcia Moore & Mark Douglas, ''Astrology, The Divine Science'', Arcane Publications, York Harbour, Maine USA, 1971, p. 676</ref>\n\nThe method based on the zodiacal constellations has a flaw in that the stars of many constellations overlap. For example, by 2700 the vernal point will have moved into Aquarius, but due to overlap the vernal point will also point to Pisces.<ref>Ray Grass ''Signs of the Times'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, 2002, p. 263</ref>\n\n===Age transitions===\nMany astrologers consider the entrance into a new astrological age a gradual transition called a \"cusp\". For example, Ray Grasse states that an astrological age does not begin at an exact day or year.<ref>Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, p. 14</ref> Paul Wright states that a transition effect does occur at the border of the astrological ages. Consequently, the beginning of any age cannot be defined to a single year or a decade but blend its influences with the previous age for a period of time until the new age can stand in its own right.<ref>Paul Wright, ''The Great Ages and Other Astrological Cycles'', Parlando Press, Edinburgh, 2007, pp. 7–8</ref> \n\nMany astrologers believe that the world is transitioning from the Pisces and Aquarian Ages <ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.aquariuspapers.com/astrology/2015/01/are-we-in-the-age-of-aquarius-or-still-in-the-age-of-pisces.html\n| title = Are We In The Age of Aquarius Or Still In The Age of Pisces?\n| work = Aquarius Papers\n| accessdate = 2018-04-13\n}}</ref>, which is claimed to explain that developments in the world today can be aligned to Pisces (i.e. continuing strong religious influences especially from Christianity) and Aquarius (traditional [[archetypes]] associated with Aquarius include electricity, computers, and democracy) <ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://astrologyclub.org/aquarius-archetype/\n| title = The Archetype of Aquarius\n| work = Astrology Club\n| accessdate = 2018-04-13\n}}</ref>. A few astrologers consider the last c. 10 degrees of a given age (c. 720 years) as the time period during which the new age starts to make visible its influences, also called \"orb of influence\". In [[Nicholas Campion]]'s ''The Book of World Horoscopes'' there are six pages listing researchers and their proposed dates for the start of the Age of Aquarius indicating that many researchers believe that each age commences at an exact date.<ref>Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, Bournemouth UK, 1999, pp. 489–495</ref>\n\nAlbert Amao Ph.D. states that the transition period between any two ages is based on one degrees either side of the point of intersection of two adjoining zodiacal constellations. As one degree is approximately 72 years, Amao has a transition period between ages of 144 years.<ref>Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age & The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, p. 56</ref>\n\n===Other opinions on the astrological ages===\n\n====Ages exactly 2,000 years each====\nMany astrologers find ages too erratic based on either the vernal point moving through the randomly sized zodiacal constellations or sidereal zodiac and, instead, round all astrological ages to exactly 2000 years each. In this approach the ages are usually neatly aligned so that the Aries age is found from 2000 BC to AD 1, Pisces age AD 1 to AD 2000, the Aquarian Age AD 2000 - AD 4000, and so on.<ref>Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 119</ref> This approach is inconsistent with the precession of the equinoxes. Based on precession of the equinoxes, there is a one-degree shift approximately every 72 years, so a 30-degree movement requires 2160 years to complete.\n\n====Ages involving the opposite sign====\nAn established school of thought that an age is also influenced by the sign opposite to the one of the astrological age. Referring back to the precession of the Equinoxes, as the Sun crosses one constellation in the Northern Hemisphere's spring Equinox (March 21), it will cross the opposite sign in the spring Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere (September 21). For instance, the Age of Pisces is complemented by its opposite astrological sign of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (the Virgin); so a few refer to the Piscean age as the 'Age of Pisces-Virgo'.<ref>Derek & Julia Parker, Parkers' Encyclopedia of Astrology, Watkins Publishing, London, 2009, p. 3</ref> Adopting this approach, the Age of Aquarius would become the Age of Aquarius-Leo. Ray Grasse also claims that each sign of the zodiac is involving with the opposite sign.<ref>Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, pp. 113–127</ref>\n\n====Mayan Long Count Calendar & Precession====\n{{See|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}\n\nWilliam Sullivan in ''The Secret of the Incas'' claims there is a direct connection between the history of the [[Inca Empire]] and [[precession of the equinoxes]]. [[John Major Jenkins]] in 'Maya Cosmogenesis 2012' believes that the [[Mayan Long Count Calendar]] is based on precession of the equinoxes and solstices.<ref>Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age & The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, p. 4</ref> Jenkins believes that the Maya related the precession of the winter solstice sunrise against the Milky Way—an event which is currently developing and supposedly instrumental in mankind's spiritual renewal.<ref>Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age & The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, pp. 57–8</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==History of the Astrological Ages==\n\n===Hipparchus===\nThe great demarcation point in the history of the astrological ages is around 127 BC when the Greek astronomer-astrologer [[Hipparchus]] from observation discovered that the great immovable sphere of fixed stars was not fixed but slowly moving eastwards due to what is now known as [[precession of the equinoxes]]. It is possible that some other astronomers before Hipparchus had also noticed the phenomenon, but it is Hipparchus who is credited with this discovery. \n\nThis discovery by Hipparchus is not entirely unexpected as Hipparchus is considered to have been the greatest observational astronomer in his time and up until [[Tycho Brahe]] in the 16th century AD. What is highly contentious in modern times is the claim by many that observation of the effects of precession of the equinoxes was known well before the time of Hipparchus and his contemporaries in Greece or even Mesopotamia.\n\n===Possible pre-Hipparchian recognition of precession===\n[[Giorgio de Santillana]] (1902 – 1974) became professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1954, and along with Hertha von Dechend they published a book entitled ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' in 1969. It was an attempt to marry science and mythology that had become separated by the ancient Greeks. Santillana and von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters, and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization.\n\nSantillana and von Dechend state that ancient myths have no historical basis but a cosmological one based on a primitive form of astrology. They recognized the importance of the heliacally rising constellation as markers for the astrological ages and claimed that knowledge of this phenomenon had been known for thousands of years previously. They claim that to understand ancient thinking it is necessary to understand astrology, not the modern sun-sign or horoscopic astrology, but the astrology of ancient times which was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of ancient times.<ref>Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend, \"Hamlet's Mill\", David R Godine, Boston, publisher, 1977, pp. 50, 59, 66, 74, 120, 142–3, 146</ref>\n\nThey go further and state that our knowledge of the dawn of astrology and its relationship to ancient myths and star names is limited, and only extends back to about 2100 BC, which was during the Renaissance of Sumerian Culture; we are not able, they say, to examine older material on the subject. In ''Hamlet's Mill'' it is claimed that the ancient Greeks knew of three successive destructions that correlate to three ages, and that since the beginning of history the vernal point has moved through Taurus, Aries, and Pisces. Hesiod in ''Works and Days'' refers to five successive ages.<ref>Giorgio de Santillana & Hertha von Dechend, \"Hamlet's Mill\", David R Godine, Boston, publisher, 1977, pp. 50, 59, 66, 74, 120, 142–3, 146</ref>\n\nAs early as 1811, modern researchers were examining evidence for knowledge of precession of the equinoxes and astrological ages before Hipparchus. Sir [[William Drummond of Logiealmond|William Drummond]] published ''Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament'' in 1811. Drummond expounds on his hypothesis that a greater part of the Hebrew Scriptures are merely allegorical writings that hide the true content. Furthermore, the Orientalists were mainly concerned with astronomy and most of their ancient myths are really disguised astronomical records.<ref>William Drummond, ''Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament'', Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p xix, 159</ref> Drummond believed that the 49th chapter of Genesis contains prophecies allied to astronomy and that the twelve tribes of Israel represented the 12 zodiacal signs.<ref>William Drummond, \"Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament\", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p. 5</ref> \n\nDrummond makes his case that at the time of [[Abraham]], the [[Amorites]] first recorded the shift from the Age of Taurus to the Age of Aries as represented by the year commencing with the Ram (Aries) rather than the bull (Taurus). The [[Book of Joshua]] indicates that by the time of [[Moses]] the equinoxes had already shifted from [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] to [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], as [[Moses]] had ordained that the civil year should commence with the month of [[Nisan]] (Aries) rather than the month of Taurus. The feast of the [[Passover]] is probably a celebration of the Age of Aries with the Paschal Lamb representative of Aries, traditionally associated with the symbol of the ram or sheep.<ref>William Drummond, \"Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament\", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p. 193</ref> \n\nDrummond also hypothesizes that most number references in ancient texts were coded to hide their real value by multiples of 1,000. For example, in the [[Old Testament]] [[Joshua]] commanded 30,000 men, and he slew 12,000 inhabitants of the city of Ai. The historian [[Berossus|Berosus]] stated the Babylonians commenced astronomical observations 49,000 years (7 x 7 x 1000) before Alexander the Great.<ref>William Drummond, \"Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament\", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), pp. 223, 225</ref> Most early references were related to 7 (Sun, Moon, and five visible planets), 12 (number of zodiacal signs and months per year), 30 (degrees per sign of the zodiac), and higher combinations of these numbers and other numbers associated with astronomical observations and astrology.\n\nThe problem of understanding the exact nature of ancient astrology is that it was only partly documented, leaving the question of the extent of their undocumented astrological knowledge. Michael Baigent in ''From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia'' suggests that there is evidence that there was probably an older or parallel oral tradition of astrology at the time of publication of [[Enuma Anu Enlil]]<ref>Michael Baigent, ''From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia'', Penguin Books, 1994, pp. 55–6, 65,71</ref> believed published over the period (1595–1157 BC). The ancient Mesopotamians believed that history repeated itself after a massive cycle of many years.<ref>\"From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia, Penguin Books, 1994, p. 85</ref>\n\n===Post-Hipparchus===\n\n====Trepidation====\nIn the early post-[[Hipparchus]] period, two schools of thought developed about the slow shift of the fixed sphere of stars as discovered by [[Hipparchus]]. One school believed that at 1 degree shift per 100 years, the sphere of fixed stars would return to its starting point after 36,000 years. The [[trepidation (astronomy)|trepidation]] school believed that the fixed stars first moved one way, then moved the other way - similar to a giant pendulum. It was believed that the 'swinging' stars first moved 8 degrees one direction, then reversed this 8 degrees travelling the other direction. \n\nTheon of Alexandria in the 4th century AD includes trepidation when he wrote ''Small Commentary to the Handy Tables''. In the 5th century AD, the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Proclus]] mentions that both theories were being discussed. The Indians around the 5th century AD preferred the trepidation theory but because they had observed the movement of the fixed stars by 25 degrees since ancient times (since around 1325 BC), they considered that trepidation swung back and forth around 27 degrees.\n\nThe significant early exponent of the 'circular 36,000' years method was [[Ptolemy]] and, due to the status placed upon [[Ptolemy]] by later scholars, the Christian and Muslim astronomers of the [[Middle Ages]] accepted the [[Great Year]] of 36,000 years rather than trepidation. However some scholars gave credence to both theories based on the addition of another sphere which is represented in the [[Alfonsine tables]] produced by the [[Toledo School of Translators]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. The [[Alfonsine tables]] computed the positions of the sun, moon, and planets relative to the fixed stars. The Italian astronomer [[Cecco d'Ascoli]], professor of astrology at the University of Bologna in the early 14th century, continued to have faith in trepidation but believed it swung 10 degrees in either direction. [[Copernicus]] refers to trepidation in ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' published in 1543.<ref>Jim Tester, \"A History of Western Astrology\", The Boydell Press, 1987, pp. 161–2, 196</ref>\n\n====Rate of Precession====\nThough the one degree per hundred years calculated for [[precession of the equinoxes]] as defined by [[Hipparchus]] and promulgated by [[Ptolemy]] was too slow, another rate of precession that was too fast also gained popularity in the 1st millennium AD. By the fourth century AD, Theon of [[Alexandria]]<ref>Pingree, David: Precession and Trepidation in Indian Astronomy before A.D. 1200. Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 3, p.27 - 35</ref> assumed a changing rate (trepidation) of one degree per 66 years. The tables of the Shah (Zij-i Shah)<ref>Pingree, David Edwin: \"The Recovery of early Greek astronomy from India\", Journal for the History of Astronomy, Bd. 7, 1976, S. 112</ref> originate in the sixth century, but are unfortunately lost, but many later Arabic and Persian astronomers and astrologers refer to them and also use this value. \n\nThese later astronomers-astrologers or sources include: [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Zij al Sindhind]] or \"Star Tables Based on the Indian Calculation Method\"(c. 800); \"Tabulae probatae\" or \"az-Zig al-mumtan\" (c. 830); [[Al-Battani]], [[Albategnius]], al-Zij (c. 880); and al-Sufi, [[Azophi]] (c. 965); [[Al Biruni]] (973-1048), \"al Canon al Masud\" or \"The Masʿūdic Canon\"; Arabic fixed star cataloque of 1 October 1112 (ed. Paul Kunitzsch); and \"Libros del Saber de Astronomía\" by [[Alfonso X of Castile]](1252-1284).<ref>Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, \"Astronomy and Civilization In the New Enlightenment: Passions of the Skies\", Springer, p 96</ref> At one degree per 66 years, one decan of a zodiacal sign (i.e. 10 degrees) is precessed in a period of 666 years - a value made famous in the [[Book of Revelation]] as the [[Number of the Beast]] {{Original research inline|date=February 2013}}.\n\n====Anno Domini====\nThere exists evidence that the modern calendar developed by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the 6th century AD commencing with the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] at AD 1 was influenced by [[precession of the equinoxes]] and astrological ages. Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years (Diocletian persecuted Christians) with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time it was believed that the [[Resurrection]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that based on the Anno Mundi calendar Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.<ref>Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006</ref><ref>Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328</ref> \n\nAnno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection of Christ and the end of the world.<ref>Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000</ref> Since this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius, he therefore searched for a new end of the world at a later date. He was heavily influenced by ancient cosmology, in particular the doctrine of the [[Great Year]] that places a strong emphasis on planetary conjunctions. This doctrine says that when all the planets were in conjunction that this cosmic event would mark the end of the world. Dionysius accurately calculated that this conjunction would occur in May AD 2000. Dionysius then applied another astronomical timing mechanism based on [[precession of the equinoxes]]. Though incorrect, some oriental astronomers at the time believed that the precessional cycle was 24,000 years which included twelve astrological ages of 2,000 years each. Dionysius believed that if the planetary alignment marked the end of an age (i.e. the Pisces age), then the birth of Jesus Christ marked the beginning of the Age of Pisces 2,000 years earlier. He therefore deducted 2,000 years from the May 2000 conjunction to produce AD 1<ref>Consideration of the Origin of the Yearly Count in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars. Cosmology Through Time.

Medieval and Renaissance Studies, University of California Press, 1970, Pp 149  </ref>\n\n====Giovanni Pico della Mirandola====\nThe 15th century Italian Renaissance philosopher [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] published a massive attack on astrological predictions, but he did not object to all of [[astrology]] and he commented on the position of the vernal point in his day. Pico was aware of the effects of [[precession of the equinoxes]] and knew that the first point of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] no longer existed in the constellation of Aries. Pico not only knew that the vernal point had shifted back into [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], he stated that in his time, the vernal point (zero degrees tropical Aries) was located at 2 degrees (sidereal) Pisces. This suggests that by whatever method of calculation he was employing, Pico expected the vernal point to shift into (sidereal) [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] age 144 years later as a one degree shift takes 72 years.<ref>Jim Tester, \"A History of Western Astrology\", The Boydell Press, Suffolk, UK, 1999, pp 209,214</ref>\n\n==Calculation aspects==\n[[Image:Outside view of precession.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Precessional movement as seen from 'outside' the celestial sphere. The rotation axis of the Earth describes over a period of about 25,800 years a small circle (blue) among the stars, centred on the [[ecliptic coordinates|ecliptic]] northpole (blue '''E''') and with an angular radius of about 23.4°: the angle known as the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis 5000 years ago when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris is the situation now. Note that when the [[celestial sphere]] is seen from outside constellations appear in mirror image. Also note that the daily rotation of the Earth around its axis is opposite to the precessional rotation. When the polar axis ''precesses'' from one direction to another, then the equatorial plane of the Earth (indicated with the circular grid around the equator) and the associated celestial equator will move too. Where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic (red line) there are the equinoxes. As seen from the drawing, the orange grid, 5000 years ago one intersection of equator and ecliptic, the [[vernal equinox]] was close to the star [[Aldebaran]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. By now (the yellow grid) it has shifted (red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces. Note that this is an astronomical description of the precessional movement and the vernal equinox position in a given constellation may not imply the astrological meaning of an Age carrying the same name, as they (ages and constellations) only have an exact alignment in the \"[[first point of Aries]]\", meaning once in each c. 25800 ([[Great year|Great Sidereal Year]]).]]\n\nThe Earth, in addition to its diurnal (daily) rotation upon its axis and annual rotation around the Sun, incurs a precessional motion involving a slow periodic shift of the axis itself: approximately one degree every 72 years. This motion, which is caused mostly by the Moon's [[gravity]], gives rise to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] in which the Sun's position on the [[ecliptic]] at the time of the vernal equinox, measured against the background of fixed stars, gradually changes with time.\n\nIn graphical terms, the Earth behaves like a spinning top, and tops tend to wobble as they spin. The spin of the Earth is its daily (diurnal) rotation. The spinning Earth slowly wobbles over a period slightly less than 26,000 years. From our perspective on Earth, the stars are ever so slightly 'moving' from west to east at the rate of one degree approximately every 72 years. One degree is about twice the diameter of the Sun or Moon as viewed from Earth. The easiest way to notice this slow movement of the stars is at any fixed time each year. The most common fixed time is at the vernal equinox around 21 March each year.\n\nIn astrology, an astrological age has usually been defined by the constellation or superimposed [[sidereal zodiac]] in which the Sun actually appears at the [[vernal equinox]]. This is the method that [[Hipparchus]] appears to have applied around 127 BC when he calculated precession. Since each sign of the zodiac is composed of 30 degrees, each astrological age might be thought to last about 72 (years) × 30 (degrees) = about 2160 years. \n\nThis means the Sun crosses the equator at the vernal equinox moving backwards against the fixed stars from one year to the next at the rate of one degree in seventy-two years, one constellation (on average) in about 2160 years, and the whole twelve signs in about 25,920 years, sometimes called a [[Great Year|Platonic Year]]. However the length of the ages are decreasing with time as the rate of precession is increasing. Therefore, no two ages are of equal length.\n\n===First point of Aries alignment - the fiducial point===\nApproximately every 26,000 years the zodiacal constellations, the associated [[sidereal zodiac]], and the tropical zodiac used by western astrologers basically align. Technically this is when the tropical and sidereal \"first point in Aries\" (Aries 0°) coincided. This alignment is often called the [[wikt:fiducial|fiducial]] point and, if the fiducial point could be found, fairly exact timeframes of all the astrological ages could be accurately determined if the method used to determine the astrological ages is based on the equal-sized 30 degrees per age and do not correspond to the exact constellation configuration in the sky. \n\nHowever this fiducial point is difficult to determine because while there is no ambiguity about the [[tropical zodiac]] used by western astrologers, the same cannot be said of the sidereal zodiac used by [[Vedic period|Vedic]] astrologers. Vedic astrologers do not have unanimity on the exact location in space of their sidereal zodiac. This is because the sidereal zodiac is superimposed upon the irregular zodiacal constellation, and there are no unambiguous boundaries of the zodiacal constellations. \n\nModern day astronomers have defined boundaries, but this is a recent development by astronomers who are divorced from astrology, and cannot be assumed to be correct from the astrological perspective. While most astronomers and some astrologers agree that the fiducial point occurred in or around the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, there is no consensus on any exact date or tight timeframe within these three centuries. A number of dates are proposed by various astronomers and even wider timeframes by astrologers. (For an alternative approach to calibrating precession, see [[#Alternative approach to calibrating precession|Alternative approach to calibrating precession]] in New, alternative, and fringe theories section below).\n\nAs an example of a [[mysticism|mystic]] contemporary approach to precession, in [[Max Heindel]]'s astrology writings,<ref>[http://www.rosicrucian.com/asthtme1.htm A Rosicrucian Spiritual Astrology library], a Western [[Esoteric Christian]] astrology library</ref> it is described, that last time the starting-point of the [[sidereal zodiac]] agreed with the [[tropical zodiac]] occurred in AD 498. A year after these points were in exact agreement, the Sun crossed the equator about fifty seconds of space into the constellation Pisces. The year following it was one minute and forty seconds into Pisces, and so it has been creeping backwards ever since, until at the present time the Sun crosses the equator in about nine degrees in the constellation Pisces. Based on this approach, it will thus be about 600 years before it actually crosses the celestial equator in the constellation Aquarius. However this is only one of many approaches and so this must remain speculation at this point of time.\n\n==Past ages==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2008}}\n\n===The Age of Leo (The Leonian Age)===\nSymbol for [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]: [[Image:Leo.svg|33px]]\n\nWhen the March equinox used to occur in [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]].\n\n====Timeframes====\n*''Zodiacal 30 degrees'':\n**Patrick Burlingame{{who|date=September 2018}}{{year needed|date=September 2018}} interpretation: began c. 10,006 BC and ended c. 8006 BC\n**Common interpretation: c. 10,500 BC to 8000 BC\n\n====Overview====\n\"The Golden Age\".

However, the themes emphasised during this age relate to courage, initiative, war, and adventure. Nations during this age such as the expanding empires of [[history of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Persia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], are often cited as examples of the archetypes of Aries in action. Also the Aries constellation shows a ram running. This could correspond with the sacrifice of Abraham's Ram. While the number of names containing the sound of the ram during this period is noted: [[Ra]] (Sun God), Ram, Rama, Brahman, Brahma, Abram/Abraham, Amon Ra, and [[Ramesses I]].{{Dubious|date=September 2008}} The [[battering ram]] was employed by the Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans with great success during this time.{{Dubious|date=September 2008}} (The symbol of Mars, the planetary ruler of Aries, evokes this interpretation.) According to the Roman state religion, the Roman people were the \"Sons of Mars\".\n\nAries is associated with the metal [[iron]], and iron ore was for the first time smelted and worked into iron swords in [[Anatolia]] during the early phase of this era, replacing the heavier, softer-metalled, duller-edged bronze swords of the previous Taurus Age.\n\nTraits of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] such as 'initiative' may suggest the explosion of originality in the development of social aspects, sciences and arts in regions such as [[Ancient Greece]] but at the same time traits such as 'Impulsivity' may be attributed to the various Wars of the time.\n\n====Religious similarities====\nThe Age of Aries ushered in efforts to replace [[polytheism]] with [[monotheism]]. The earliest known attempt was by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], who, in about 1350 BC, decreed the Sun God [[Aten]] to be the supreme deity, apparently in reaction to his earlier lack of inclusion in religious rites by his family. After his death, however, power reverted to the original polytheistic priests, who re-established the old religion. Speculation (including that of [[Freud]]) has it that later, during the reign of [[Ramesses II]], [[Moses]] was influenced by rumour of Akhenaten's revolutionary idea, and grasped the idea of a single supreme God, who especially favoured his people, as an inspirational mechanism that best suited his people held in bondage. The symbol of Aries can be seen as representing the power of multiple gods streaming down into a single god-head.\n\n[[Moses]] (born c. 16th–13th century BC; 7 Adar 2368 – 7 Adar 2488 in the [[Hebrew calendar]]), an early [[Biblical Hebrew]] religious leader, lawgiver, [[prophet]], and military leader, condemns his own people upon finding them worshiping a 'golden calf' (a symbol of the previous [[Age of Taurus]] and of the worship of the [[Apis (god)|bull deity]]) after coming down [[Mount Sinai]].

Furthermore, they see the appearance of dictators, self-expression, and the rising influence of the entertainment industry are linked to the Aquarian Age by its opposite sign Leo.\n\n====Popular culture====\nIn popular culture, the expression \"Age of Aquarius\" usually refers to the heyday of the [[hippie]] and [[New Age]] movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1967 successful musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', with its opening song \"[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]\" and the memorable line \"This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius\", brought the Aquarian Age concept to the attention of a huge worldwide audience.\nThis New Age phenomenon is seen by some astrologers to be marked by the conjunction of the planet Uranus, ruler of the sign Aquarius, and the coming age, with Pluto, ruler of the masses, bringing radical change, in the 1960s. However, as the song relates, it is only considered by astrologers as the \"dawning\" or \"[[cusp (astrology)|cusp]]\" of the Age, with the full strength of the Age not occurring until some time in the future.\n\nSee also\n*[[Age of Aquarius]]\n*[[Secularism]]\n*[[Technological convergence]]\n*[[Modernism]]\n*[[Humanitarianism]]\n*[[Cosmic pluralism|Pluralism]]\n\n===The Age of Capricorn ===\n\nThe Age of Capricorn will follow the Age of Aquarius approximately 2150 years after the beginning of the Age of Aquarius, but the actual date for the start of the Age of Capricorn depends upon which system is used to calculate the length of an age and which system is applied to mark the start of the Age of Aquarius.  There is no consensus on these matters but in broad terms, the Age of Capricorn can be expected to arrive somewhere from around the year 3500 to 4600 CE.\n\n==The sub-periods of ages==\nMany research astrologers believe that the astrological ages can be divided into smaller sections along the lines of 'wheels within wheels'. The most common method is to divide each astrological ages into twelve sub-periods.<ref>Terry MacKinnell, \"A New Look at the Old Ages\", published in the \"NCGR member letter\" June- July 2002, National Center for Geocosmic Research Inc, p. 10</ref> There are two common ways of undertaking this process and two ways of applying these sub-periods. Furthermore, some astrologers divide the ages in different ways. For example, Lcdr David Williams employs a [[Decans|decan]]ate sub-division whereby each age is divided into three equal sections.<ref>Lcdr David Williams, ''Simplified Astronomy for Astrologers'', 1980, American Federation of Astrologers, Tempe Arizona</ref> [[Robert Hand]] developed another approach entirely whereby the conjunction of the moving vernal point with specific stars within the zodiacal constellations provides an extra flavour to the corresponding historical events based on the nature of the star involved.<ref>Robert Hand, ''Cardinal Points'', 1997</ref>\n\nHowever Robert Hand believes that the moving Capricorn solstice point (around 20 December) near the modern New Year provides greater correlation to historical events compared to the vernal equinox. Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet used a variety of sub-periods including decans, but Patrizia advocated that the ninefold division of each sign was the most powerful and influential sub-division.<ref>Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, ''The Gnostic Circle'', Samual Weiser Inc, New York, 1978, pp. 105–122</ref> The ninefold division (termed 'navamsa') of the zodiacal signs is also the most popular sign sub-division system employed by [[Vedic astrology|Vedic astrologers]]. Vedic astrologers also apply their [[nakshatra]] star asterisms in place of the twelve zodiacal constellations. There are 27 nakshatras of 13 degrees 20 minutes each, thus the average length of a 'nakshatra' age is 960 years.\n\n===Aries to Pisces sub-periods===\nThe most popular method of sub-dividing astrological ages is to divide each age equally into twelve sub-periods with the first sub-period Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, and so on, until the last sub-division, Pisces. [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] was an early advocate of this approach.<ref>Charles Carter, ''An Introduction to Political Astrology (Mundane Astrology)'', The Camelot Press, Great Britain, 1973, pp. 75–6</ref> Technically this approach is based on the twelfth harmonic of the zodiacal signs.\n\n===Dwadasamsa sub-periods===\nThe alternative approach is to apply a method commonly used in Vedic astrology but with long antecedents also in western astrology.<ref>the ancient Roman astrologer Manilius used dwadasamsa but called them dodecatemorion (sometimes 'duodecatemorion') - Stephanie Jean Ennis, ''Decanates and Dwads'', 1983, p. 57 {{ISBN|0-86690-239-2}}</ref> This method also divides each astrological age into twelve sub-periods but the first sub-period for each sign is the same as the sign itself, then with the following sub-periods in natural order. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn. Technically this approach is based on attributes of both the twelfth and thirteenth harmonics of the zodiacal signs and can be considered to be halfway between the 12th and 13th harmonics.\n\n===Sub-period direction (forward or retrograde?)===\nThere are two ways of applying the above sub-periods to the astrological ages.\n*Natural Order - The most common way is to arrange the sub-periods so that they go forward in the natural order. Therefore, if the Aries to Pisces method is adopted for example in the Aquarian Age, the first sub-period is Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini and so on until the last sub-division – Pisces. This is the approach made by [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]]. If the dwadasamsa sub-period is adopted they also progress in the natural order of the signs. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn.\n\n*Geometric Order (Retrograde) - The other approach is to arrange the sub-periods geometrically and reverse the direction of the sub-periods in line with the retrograde order of the astrological ages. For example, if applying the Aries to Pisces method, the first sub-period of any astrological age is Pisces, followed by Aquarius, Capricorn, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aries. [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] indicated there was some merit to this approach.<ref>[[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]], ''An Introduction to Political Astrology'', 1973, LN Fowler & Co Ltd, London, p. 76</ref> If applying the dwadasamsa sub-period system geometrically for example the first sub-period in the Aquarian Age is Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, Scorpio, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aquarius. This approach is adopted by Terry MacKinnell,<ref>Terry MacKinnell, \"The Cusp of Ages\" published in ''The FAA Journal'' June 2001 Vol 31 No. 2. pp. 33–42</ref> Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet<ref>Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, ''The Gnostic Circle'', Samual Weiser Inc, New York, 1978</ref> and Lcdr David Williams applied his [decans] (threefold division) geometrically thus supporting this approach.\n\n==New, alternative, and fringe myths==\nDue to the lack of consensus of almost all aspects of the astrological ages, except for the astrological ages relationship to [[precession of the equinoxes]] and the retrograde order of the astrological ages, there are alternative, esoteric, innovative, fringe and newly expressed ideas about the astrological ages which have not established credibility in the wider astrological community or amongst archeoastronomers.\n\n===Alternative approach to calibrating precession===\nTerry MacKinnell has developed an alternative approach to calibrating precession of the equinoxes to determine the Astrological Age. His major point of departure from the traditional modern approach is how he applies the vernal equinox to the zodiacal constellations. Instead of referring to the position of the Sun at the vernal equinox (a 'modern' mathematical technique developed by the Greeks in the late 1st millennium BC), he refers to the [[heliacal rising]] constellation on the day of the vernal equinox. This approach is based on the ancient approach to astronomical observations (the same ancient period that also saw the invention of the zodiacal constellations) prior to the development of mathematical astronomy by the ancient Greeks in the 1st millennium BC. All ancient astronomical observations were based on visual techniques.<ref>O Neugebaurer, ''The Exact Sciences in Antiquity'', 1969, p. 106</ref> \n\nOf all the key techniques used in ancient times, the most common in Babylon (most likely the source of astrology) and most other ancient cultures were based on phenomena that occurred close to the eastern or western horizons.<ref>O Neugebaurer, ''The Exact Sciences in Antiquity'', 1969, p. 98</ref> MacKinnell claims that it is incongruent to use a 'modern' mathematical approach to the much older constellations that were first described well before these mathematical approaches were invented.\n\nThe heliacal rising constellation at the vernal equinox is based on the last zodiacal constellation rising above the Eastern Horizon just before dawn and before the light of the approaching Sun obliterates the stars on the eastern horizon. Currently at the vernal equinox the constellation of Aquarius has been the heliacal rising constellation for some centuries. The stars disappear about one hour before dawn depending upon magnitude, latitude, and date. This one hour represents approximately 15 degrees difference compared to the contemporary method based on the position of the Sun amongst the zodiacal constellations.<ref>John H Rogers, \"Origins of the ancient constellations: I.

Therefore, 15 degrees represents about half an age or about 1080 years. Therefore, based on the heliacal rising method, the Age of Aquarius arrived about 1,080 years earlier than the modern system. John H Rogers in part one of his paper ''Origins of the ancient constellations'' also states that using the ancient heliacal rising method compared to the (modern) solar method produces a result that is approximately 1,000 in advance.<ref>John H Rogers, \"Origins of the ancient constellations: I.

In particular, it can refer to the gradual shift in the orientation of [[Earth]]'s axis of rotation in a cycle of approximately 25,772 years.<ref>Hohenkerk, C.Y., Yallop, B.D., Smith, C.A., & Sinclair, A.T. \"Celestial Reference Systems\" in Seidelmann, P.K.

The term \"precession\" typically refers only to this largest part of the motion; other changes in the alignment of Earth's axis—[[astronomical nutation|nutation]] and [[polar motion]]—are much smaller in magnitude.\n\nEarth's precession was historically called the '''precession of the equinoxes''', because the [[Equinox_(celestial_coordinates)|equinoxes]] moved westward along the [[ecliptic]] relative to the [[fixed star]]s, opposite to the yearly motion of the [[Sun]] along the ecliptic. This term is still used in non-technical discussions, that is, when detailed mathematics are absent.

Planetary precession (an advance) is due to the small angle between the gravitational force of the other planets on Earth and its orbital plane (the ecliptic), causing the plane of the ecliptic to shift slightly relative to inertial space. Lunisolar precession is about 500 times greater than planetary precession.<ref name=Williams/> In addition to the Moon and Sun, the other planets also cause a small movement of Earth's axis in inertial space, making the contrast in the terms lunisolar versus planetary misleading, so in 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] recommended that the dominant component be renamed the '''precession of the equator''', and the minor component be renamed '''precession of the ecliptic''', but their combination is still named general precession.<ref>[http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2006_Resol1.pdf IAU 2006 Resolution B1: Adoption of the P03 Precession Theory and Definition of the Ecliptic]</ref> Many references to the old terms exist in publications predating the change.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n[[File:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]\nEtymologically, \"precession\" and \"[[procession]]\" are both terms that relate to [[motion (physics)|motion]]. \"Precession\" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:praecedo|praecedere]]'', \"to precede, to come before or earlier\"), while \"procession\" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:procedo|procedere]]'', \"to march forward, to advance\"). Generally the term \"procession\" is used to describe a group of objects moving forward. The stars viewed from Earth are seen to proceed in a procession from east to west daily, due to the Earth's [[diurnal motion]], and yearly, due to the Earth's revolution around the Sun. At the same time the stars can be observed to anticipate slightly such motion, at the rate of approximately 50 arc seconds per year, a phenomenon known as the \"precession of the equinoxes\".\n\nIn describing this motion astronomers generally have shortened the term to simply \"precession\". In describing the ''cause'' of the motion physicists have also used the term \"precession\", which has led to some confusion between the observable phenomenon and its cause, which matters because in astronomy, some precessions are real and others are apparent. This issue is further obfuscated by the fact that many astronomers are physicists or astrophysicists.\n\nIt should be noted that the term \"precession\" used in [[astronomy]] generally describes the observable precession of the equinox (the stars moving [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde]] across the sky), whereas the term \"precession\" as used in [[physics]], generally describes a mechanical process.\n\n==Effects==\n[[File:Earth axial precession.svg|thumb|300px|The coincidence of the annual cycles of the apses (closest and further approach to the sun) and calendar dates (with seasons noted) at four equally spaced stages of precessionary 26,000-year-cycle. The season dates are those in the north. The tilt of Earth's axis and the eccentricity of its orbit are exaggerated. Approximate estimates. Effects of weak planetary precession on the stages shown are ignored.]]\nThe precession of the Earth's axis has a number of observable effects. First, the positions of the south and north [[celestial pole]]s appear to move in circles against the space-fixed backdrop of stars, completing one circuit in approximately 26,000 years. Thus, while today the star [[Polaris]] lies approximately at the north celestial pole, this will change over time, and other stars will become the \"[[pole star|north star]]\".<ref name=\"Astro 101\"/> In approximately 3200 years, the star [[Gamma Cephei]] in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position. The south celestial pole currently lacks a bright star to mark its position, but over time precession also will cause bright stars to become [[South Star|south stars]]. As the celestial poles shift, there is a corresponding gradual shift in the apparent orientation of the whole star field, as viewed from a particular position on Earth.\n\nSecondly, the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun at the [[solstice]]s, [[equinox]]es, or other time defined relative to the seasons, slowly changes.<ref name=\"Astro 101\"/> For example, suppose that the Earth's orbital position is marked at the summer solstice, when the Earth's [[axial tilt]] is pointing directly toward the Sun. One full orbit later, when the Sun has returned to the same apparent position relative to the background stars, the Earth's axial tilt is not now directly toward the Sun: because of the effects of precession, it is a little way \"beyond\" this. In other words, the solstice occurred a little ''earlier'' in the orbit. Thus, the [[tropical year]], measuring the cycle of seasons (for example, the time from solstice to solstice, or equinox to equinox), is about 20 minutes shorter than the [[sidereal year]], which is measured by the Sun's apparent position relative to the stars. After about 26&nbsp;000 years the difference amounts to a full year, so the positions of the seasons relative to the orbit are \"back where they started\". (Other effects also slowly change the shape and orientation of the Earth's orbit, and these, in combination with precession, create various cycles of differing periods; see also [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The magnitude of the Earth's tilt, as opposed to merely its orientation, also changes slowly over time, but this effect is not attributed directly to precession.)\n\nFor identical reasons, the apparent position of the Sun relative to the backdrop of the stars at some seasonally fixed time slowly regresses a full 360° through all twelve traditional constellations of the [[zodiac]], at the rate of about 50.3 [[Arcsecond|seconds of arc]] per year, or 1 degree every 71.6 years.\n\nAt present, the rate of precession corresponds to a period of 25,772 years, but the rate itself varies somewhat with time (see [[#Values|Values]] below), so one cannot say that in exactly 25,772 years the earth's axis will be back to where it is now.\n\nFor further details, see [[#Changing pole stars|Changing pole stars]] and [[#Polar shift and equinoxes shift|Polar shift and equinoxes shift]], below.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hellenistic world===\n\n====Hipparchus====\nThe discovery of precession usually is attributed to [[Hipparchus]] (190–120 BC) of [[Rhodes]] or [[İznik|Nicaea]], a [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]]. According to [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Almagest]]'', Hipparchus measured the longitude of [[Spica]] and other bright stars. Comparing his measurements with data from his predecessors, [[Timocharis]] (320–260 BC) and [[Aristillus]] (~280 BC), he concluded that Spica had moved 2° relative to the [[autumnal equinox]]. He also compared the lengths of the [[tropical year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to an equinox) and the [[sidereal year]] (the time it takes the Sun to return to a fixed star), and found a slight discrepancy. Hipparchus concluded that the equinoxes were moving (\"precessing\") through the zodiac, and that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century, in other words, completing a full cycle in no more than 36000 years.\n\nVirtually all of the writings of Hipparchus are lost, including his work on precession. They are mentioned by Ptolemy, who explains precession as the rotation of the [[celestial sphere]] around a motionless Earth. It is reasonable to presume that Hipparchus, similarly to Ptolemy, thought of precession in [[geocentric]] terms as a motion of the heavens, rather than of the Earth.\n\n====Ptolemy====\nThe first astronomer known to have continued Hipparchus's work on precession is [[Ptolemy]] in the second century AD. Ptolemy measured the longitudes of [[Regulus]], [[Spica]], and other bright stars with a variation of Hipparchus's lunar method that did not require eclipses. Before sunset, he measured the longitudinal arc separating the Moon from the Sun. Then, after sunset, he measured the arc from the Moon to the star. He used Hipparchus's model to calculate the Sun's longitude, and made corrections for the Moon's motion and its [[parallax]] (Evans 1998, pp.&nbsp;251–255). Ptolemy compared his own observations with those made by Hipparchus, [[Menelaus of Alexandria]], [[Timocharis]], and [[Agrippa (astronomer)|Agrippa]]. He found that between Hipparchus's time and his own (about 265 years), the stars had moved 2°40', or 1° in 100 years (36\" per year; the rate accepted today is about 50\" per year or 1° in 72 years). He also confirmed that precession affected all fixed stars, not just those near the ecliptic, and his cycle had the same period of 36,000 years as found by Hipparchus.\n\n====Other authors====\nMost ancient authors did not mention precession and, perhaps, did not know of it. For instance, [[Proclus]] rejected precession, while [[Theon of Alexandria]], a commentator on Ptolemy in the fourth century, accepted Ptolemy's explanation. Theon also reports an alternate theory:\n\n:''According to certain opinions ancient astrologers believe that from a certain epoch the solstitial signs have a motion of 8° in the order of the signs, after which they go back the same amount. . . .'' (Dreyer 1958, p. 204)\n\nInstead of proceeding through the entire sequence of the zodiac, the equinoxes \"trepidated\" back and forth over an arc of 8°. The theory of [[trepidation]] is presented by Theon as an alternative to precession.\n\n===Alternative discovery theories===\n\n====Babylonians====\nVarious assertions have been made that other cultures discovered precession independently of Hipparchus. According to [[Al-Battani]], the [[Babylonian astronomy|Chaldean astronomers]] had distinguished the [[tropical year|tropical]] and [[sidereal year]] so that by approximately 330 BC, they would have been in a position to describe precession, if inaccurately, but such claims generally are regarded as unsupported.<ref>Neugebauer, O. \"The Alleged Babylonian Discovery of the Precession of the Equinoxes\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 70, No. 1. (Jan. – Mar., 1950), pp. 1–8.</ref>\n\n====Maya====\nThe archaeologist [[Susan Milbrath]] has speculated that the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] of \"30,000 years involving the [[Pleiades]]...may have been an effort to calculate the precession of the equinox.\"<ref>Susan Milbrath, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726181418/http://www.instituteofmayastudies.org/Milbrath2012.pdf \"Just How Precise is Maya Astronomy?\"], Institute of Maya Studies newsletter, December 2007.</ref> This view is held by few other professional [[Mayanist|scholars of Mayan civilization]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n====Ancient Egyptians====\nSimilar claims have been made that precession was known in [[Ancient Egypt]] during the dynastic era, prior to the time of Hipparchus ([[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] period). However, these claims remain controversial. Some buildings in the [[Karnak]] temple complex, for instance, allegedly were oriented toward the point on the horizon where certain stars rose or set at key times of the year.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Nonetheless, they kept accurate calendars and if they recorded the date of the temple reconstructions it would be a fairly simple matter to plot the rough precession rate. The [[Dendera Zodiac]], a star-map from the [[Hathor temple]] at [[Dendera]] from a late (Ptolemaic) age, allegedly records precession of the equinoxes (Tompkins 1971). In any case, if the ancient Egyptians knew of precession, their knowledge is not recorded as such in any of their surviving astronomical texts.\n\nMichael Rice wrote in his ''Egypt's Legacy'', \"Whether or not the ancients knew of the mechanics of the Precession before its definition by Hipparchos the Bithynian in the second century BC is uncertain, but as dedicated watchers of the night sky they could not fail to be aware of its effects.\" (p.&nbsp;128) Rice believes that \"the Precession is fundamental to an understanding of what powered the development of Egypt\" (p.&nbsp;10), to the extent that \"in a sense Egypt as a nation-state and the king of Egypt as a living god are the products of the realisation by the Egyptians of the astronomical changes effected by the immense apparent movement of the heavenly bodies which the Precession implies.\" (p.&nbsp;56). Rice says that \"the evidence that the most refined astronomical observation was practised in Egypt in the third millennium BC (and probably even before that date) is clear from the precision with which the Pyramids at Giza are aligned to the cardinal points, a precision which could only have been achieved by their alignment with the stars. \" (p.&nbsp;31) The Egyptians also, says Rice, were \"to alter the orientation of a temple when the star on whose position it had originally been set moved its position as a consequence of the Precession, something which seems to have happened several times during the New Kingdom.\" (p.&nbsp;170)\n\n===Indian views===\n{{Main|Ayanamsa}}\nIndian astrologers were aware of axial precession since before the [[Common Era]]. Although many of the astronomical texts stored in [[Taxila]] were burnt during [[Muslim]] invasion of [[India]], {{citation needed|date=June 2018}} the classic astronomical text [[Suryasiddhanta]] survived and contains references about ayana movements. In a later commentary on [[Suryasiddhanta]] around twelfth century, [[Bhāskara II]]<ref>Siddhānta-shiromani, Golādhyāya, section-VI, verses 17–19</ref> says: \"sampāt revolves negatively 30000 times in a Kalpa of 4320 million years according to [[Surya Siddhanta|Suryasiddhanta]], while Munjāla and others say ayana moves forward 199669 in a [[Kalpa (aeon)|Kalpa]], and one should ''combine the two'', before ascertaining declension, ascensional difference, etc.\"<ref>Translation of the Surya Siddhānta by Pundit Bāpu Deva Sāstri and of the Siddhānta Siromani by the Late Lancelot Wilkinson revised by Pundit Bāpu Deva Sāstri, printed by C B Lewis at Baptist Mission Press, Calcutta, 1861; Siddhānta Shiromani Hindu commentary by Pt Satyadeva Sharmā, Chowkhambā Surbhārati Prakāshan, Varanasi, India.</ref> Lancelot Wilkinson translated the last of these three verses in a too concise manner to convey the full meaning, and skipped the portion ''combine the two'' which the modern Hindu commentary has brought to the fore. According to the Hindu commentary, the final value of period of precession should be obtained by combining +199669 revolutions of ayana with −30000 revolutions of sampaat, to get +169669 revolutions per Kalpa, i.e. one revolution in 25461 years, which is near the modern value of 25771 years.\n\nMoreover, Munjāla's value gives a period of 21636 years for ayana's motion, which is the modern value of precession when anomalistic precession also is taken into account. The latter has a period of 136000 years now, but Bhāskar-II gives its value at 144000 years (30000 in a Kalpa), calling it sampāt. Bhāskar-II did not give any name of the final term after combining the negative sampāt with the positive ayana. The value he gave indicates, however, that by ''ayana'' he meant precession on account of the combined influence of orbital and anomalistic precessions, and by sampāt he meant the anomalistic period, but defined it as equinox. His language is a bit confused, which he clarified in his own Vāsanābhāshya commentary Siddhānta Shiromani,<ref>Vāsanābhāshya commentary Siddhānta Shiromani (published by Chowkhamba)</ref> by saying that Suryasiddhanta was not available and he was writing on the basis of hearsay. Bhāskar-II did not give his own opinion, he merely cited Suryasiddhanta, Munjāla, and unnamed \"others\".\n\nExtant Suryasiddhanta supports the notion of trepidation within a range of ±27° at the rate of 54\" per year according to traditional commentators, but Burgess opined that the original meaning must have been of a cyclical motion, for which he quoted the Suryasiddhanta mentioned by Bhāskar II.<ref>cf. Suryasiddhanta, commentary by E. Burgess, ch.iii, verses 9–12.</ref>\n\n===Chinese astronomy===\n[[Yu Xi]] (fourth century AD) was the first [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomer]] to mention precession. He estimated the rate of precession as 1° in 50 years (Pannekoek 1961, p.&nbsp;92).\n\n===Middle Ages and Renaissance===\nIn [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Islamic astronomy]], precession was known based on Ptolemy's Almagest, and by observations that refined the value.\n\n[[Al-Battani]], in his [[Zij Al-Sabi']], after mentioning Hipparchus calculating precession, and Ptolemy's value of 1 degree per 100 solar years, says that he measured precession and found it to be one degree per 66 solar years.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |title=Zij Al-Sabi'\n |author=Al-Battani\n |url=http://shamela.ws/browse.php/book-452#page-132\n}}</ref>\n\nSubsequently, [[Al-Sufi]] mentions the same values in his [[Book of Fixed Stars]], that Ptolemy's value for precession is 1 degree per 100 solar years. He then quotes a different value from [[Zij Al Mumtahan]], which was done during [[Al-Ma'mun]]'s reign, as 1 degree for every 66 solar years. He also quotes the aforementioned [[Al-Battani]]'s [[Zij Al-Sabi']] as adjusting coordinates for stars by 11 degrees and 10 minutes of arc to account for the difference between Al-Battani's time and Ptolemy's.<ref>\n{{Cite web\n |title=Book of Fixed Stars\n |author=Al-Sufi\n |url=https://www.wdl.org/ar/item/18412/view/1/20/\n}}</ref>\n\nLater, the ''[[Zij-i Ilkhani]]'' compiled at the [[Maragheh observatory]] sets the precession of the equinoxes at 51 arc seconds per annum, which is very close to the modern value of 50.2 arc seconds.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The Influence of Islamic Astronomy in Europe and the Far East|last=Rufus|first=W. C.|journal=Popular Astronomy|volume=47|issue=5|date=May 1939|pages=233–238 [236]|bibcode = 1939PA.....47..233R}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages, Islamic and Latin Christian astronomers treated \"trepidation\" as a motion of the fixed stars to be ''added to'' precession. This theory is commonly attributed to the [[Arab]] astronomer [[Thabit ibn Qurra]], but the attribution has been contested in modern times. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] published a different account of trepidation in ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (1543). This work makes the first definite reference to precession as the result of a motion of the Earth's axis. Copernicus characterized precession as the third motion of the Earth.\n\n===Modern period===\nOver a century later precession was explained in [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), to be a consequence of [[gravitation]] (Evans 1998, p.&nbsp;246). Newton's original precession equations did not work, however, and were revised considerably by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and subsequent scientists.\n\n==Hipparchus's discovery==\nHipparchus gave an account of his discovery in ''On the Displacement of the Solsticial and Equinoctial Points'' (described in ''Almagest'' III.1 and VII.2). He measured the ecliptic [[longitude]] of the star [[Spica]] during lunar eclipses and found that it was about 6° west of the [[autumnal equinox]]. By comparing his own measurements with those of [[Timocharis]] of Alexandria (a contemporary of [[Euclid]], who worked with [[Aristillus]] early in the 3rd century BC), he found that Spica's longitude had decreased by about 2° in the meantime (exact years are not mentioned in Almagest). Also in VII.2, Ptolemy gives more precise observations of two stars, including Spica and concludes that in each case a 2°:40' change occurred during 128 BC and AD 139 (hence, 1° per century or one full cycle in 36000 years, that is, the precessional period of Hipparchus as reported by Ptolemy ; cf. page 328 in Toomer's translation of Almagest, 1998 edition)). He also noticed this motion in other stars. He speculated that only the stars near the zodiac shifted over time. Ptolemy called this his \"first hypothesis\" (''Almagest'' VII.1), but did not report any later hypothesis Hipparchus might have devised. Hipparchus apparently limited his speculations, because he had only a few older observations, which were not very reliable.\n\nWhy did Hipparchus need a [[lunar eclipse]] to measure the position of a star? The equinoctial points are not marked in the sky, so he needed the Moon as a reference point. Hipparchus already had developed a way to calculate the longitude of the Sun at any moment. A lunar eclipse happens during [[Full moon]], when the Moon is in [[Opposition (astronomy)|opposition]]. At the midpoint of the eclipse, the Moon is precisely 180° from the Sun. Hipparchus is thought to have measured the longitudinal arc separating Spica from the Moon. To this value, he added the calculated longitude of the Sun, plus 180° for the longitude of the Moon. He did the same procedure with Timocharis' data (Evans 1998, p.&nbsp;251). Observations such as these eclipses, incidentally, are the main source of data about when Hipparchus worked, since other biographical information about him is minimal. The lunar eclipses he observed, for instance, took place on April 21, 146 BC, and March 21, 135 BC (Toomer 1984, p.&nbsp;135 n. 14).\n\nHipparchus also studied precession in ''On the Length of the Year''. Two kinds of year are relevant to understanding his work. The [[tropical year]] is the length of time that the [[Sun]], as viewed from the Earth, takes to return to the same position along the ecliptic (its path among the stars on the celestial sphere). The [[sidereal year]] is the length of time that the Sun takes to return to the same position with respect to the stars of the celestial sphere. Precession causes the stars to change their longitude slightly each year, so the sidereal year is longer than the tropical year. Using observations of the equinoxes and solstices, Hipparchus found that the length of the tropical year was 365+1/4−1/300 days, or 365.24667 days (Evans 1998, p.&nbsp;209). Comparing this with the length of the sidereal year, he calculated that the rate of precession was not less than 1° in a century. From this information, it is possible to calculate that his value for the sidereal year was 365+1/4+1/144 days (Toomer 1978, p.&nbsp;218). By giving a minimum rate he may have been allowing for errors in observation.\n\nTo approximate his tropical year Hipparchus created his own [[lunisolar calendar]] by modifying those of [[Meton]] and [[Callippus]] in ''On Intercalary Months and Days'' (now lost), as described by [[Ptolemy]] in the ''Almagest'' III.1 (Toomer 1984, p.&nbsp;139). The [[Babylonian calendar]] used a cycle of 235 lunar months in 19 years since 499 BC (with only three exceptions before 380 BC), but it did not use a specified number of days. The [[Metonic cycle]] (432 BC) assigned 6,940 days to these 19 years producing an average year of 365+1/4+1/76 or 365.26316 days. The [[Callippic cycle]] (330 BC) dropped one day from four Metonic cycles (76 years) for an average year of 365+1/4 or 365.25 days. Hipparchus dropped one more day from four Callippic cycles (304 years), creating the [[Hipparchic cycle]] with an average year of 365+1/4−1/304 or 365.24671 days, which was close to his tropical year of 365+1/4−1/300 or 365.24667 days.\n\nWe find Hipparchus's mathematical signatures in the [[Antikythera Mechanism]], an ancient astronomical computer of the second century BC. The mechanism is based on a solar year, the [[Metonic Cycle]], which is the period the Moon reappears in the same place in the sky with the same phase (full Moon appears at the same position in the sky approximately in 19 years), the [[Callipic cycle]] (which is four Metonic cycles and more accurate), the [[Saros cycle]] and the [[Exeligmos|Exeligmos cycles]] (three Saros cycles for the accurate eclipse prediction). The study of the Antikythera Mechanism proves that the ancients have been using very accurate calendars based on all the aspects of solar and lunar motion in the sky. In fact, the Lunar Mechanism which is part of the Antikythera Mechanism depicts the motion of the Moon and its phase, for a given time, using a train of four gears with a pin and slot device which gives a variable lunar velocity that is very close to the second law of [[Kepler]], i.e. it takes into account the fast motion of the Moon at [[perigee]] and slower motion at [[apogee]]. This discovery proves that Hipparchus mathematics were much more advanced than Ptolemy describes in his books, as it is evident that he developed a good approximation of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler΄s second law]].\n\n==Mithraic question==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\nThe [[Mithraic Mysteries]], colloquially also known as [[Mithraism]], was a 1st–4th century neo-platonic [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cult]] of the Roman god Mithras. The near-total lack of written descriptions or scripture necessitates a reconstruction of beliefs and practices from the archaeological evidence, such as that found in Mithraic temples (in modern times called ''[[mithraeum|mithraea]]''), which were real or artificial \"caves\" representing the cosmos. Until the 1970s most scholars followed [[Franz Cumont]] in identifying Mithras as a continuation of the Persian god [[Mithra]]. Cumont's continuity hypothesis, and his concomitant theory that the astrological component was a late and unimportant accretion, is no longer followed. Today, the cult and its beliefs are recognized as a product of (Greco-)Roman thought, with an astrological component even more heavily pronounced than the already very astrology-centric Roman beliefs generally were. The details, however, are debated.\n\nAs far as axial precession is concerned, one scholar of Mithraism, David Ulansey, has interpreted Mithras as a personification of the force responsible for precession (Ulansey, 1989). He argues that the cult was a religious response to Hipparchus's discovery of precession, which—from the ancient geocentric perspective—amounted to the discovery that the ''entire cosmos'' (i.e., the outermost [[celestial sphere]] of the fixed stars) was moving in a previously unknown way. His analysis is based on the so-called \"[[tauroctony]]\": the image of Mithras killing a bull that was located in the central place in every Mithraic temple. In the standard tauroctony, Mithras and the bull are accompanied by a ''dog'', a ''snake'', a ''raven'', and a ''scorpion''. According to Ulansey, the tauroctony is a [[star chart]]. The bull is [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]], a constellation of the zodiac. In the [[astrological age]] that preceded the time of Hipparchus, the vernal equinox had taken place when the Sun was in the constellation of Taurus, and during that previous epoch the constellations of [[Canis Minor |Canis Minor (The Dog)]], [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra (The Snake)]], [[Corvus (constellation)|Corvus (The Raven)]], and [[Scorpius |Scorpius (The Scorpion)]]—i.e., the constellations that correspond to the animals depicted in the tauroctony—all lay on the celestial equator (the location of which is shifted by the precession) and thus had privileged positions in the sky during that epoch. Mithras himself represents the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]], which is located directly above Taurus the Bull: the same location occupied by Mithras in the tauroctony image. Mithras' killing of the Bull, by this reasoning, represented the power possessed by this new god to shift the entire cosmic structure, turning the cosmic sphere so that the location of the spring equinox left the constellation of Taurus (a transition symbolized by the killing of the Bull), and the Dog, Snake, Raven, and Scorpion likewise lost their privileged positions on the celestial equator.\n\nThe [[iconography]] also contains two torch-bearing twins ([[Cautes and Cautopates]]) framing the bull-slaying image—one holding a torch pointing up and the other a torch pointing down. These torch-bearers are sometimes depicted with one of them (torch up) holding or associated with a Bull and a tree with leaves, and the other (torch down) holding or associated with a Scorpion and a tree with fruit. Ulansey interprets these torch-bearers as representing the spring equinox (torch up, tree with leaves, Bull) and the autumn equinox (torch down, tree with fruit, Scorpion) in Taurus and Scorpius respectively, which is where the equinoxes were located during the preceding \"Age of Taurus\" symbolized in the tauroctony as a whole. Thus Ulansey concludes that Mithraic iconography was an \"astronomical code\" whose secret was the existence of a new cosmic divinity, unknown to those outside the cult, whose fundamental attribute was his ability to shift the structure of the entire cosmos and thereby to control the astrological forces believed at that time to determine human existence, thus giving him the power to grant his devotees success during life and salvation after death (i.e., a safe journey through the planetary spheres and a subsequent immortal existence in the realm of the stars).\n\n==Changing pole stars==\n[[Image:Precession N.gif|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Precession of Earth's axis around the north ecliptical pole]]\nA consequence of the precession is a changing [[pole star]]. Currently [[Polaris]] is extremely well suited to mark the position of the north celestial pole, as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] of 2.1 (variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole, with no stars of similar brightness too close.<ref name=\"hipparcos\">{{cite web | url=http://webviz.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-5?-out.add=.&-source=I/311/hip2&recno=11739 | title=HIP 11767 | work=Hipparcos, the New Reduction | author=van Leeuwen, F. | date=2007 | accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n[[Image:Precession S.gif|left|thumb|upright=1.2|Precession of Earth's axis around the south ecliptical pole]]\n\nThe previous pole star was [[Beta Ursae Minoris|Kochab]] (Beta Ursae Minoris, β UMi, β Ursae Minoris), the brightest star in the bowl of the \"Little Dipper\", located 16 degrees from Polaris. It held that role from 1500 BC to AD 500 .<ref name=StardateKochab>{{cite news|last1=Benningfield|first1=Damond|title=Kochab|url=http://stardate.org/radio/program/2015-06-14|accessdate=14 June 2015|work=Stardate Magazine|publisher=University of Texas McDonald Observatory|date=14 June 2015}}</ref> It was not quite as accurate in its day as Polaris is today.<ref name=StardateKochab/> Today, Kochab and its neighbor Pherkad are referred to as the \"Guardians of the Pole\" (meaning Polaris).<ref name=StardateKochab/>\n\nOn the other hand, [[Thuban]] in the [[constellation]] [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]], which was the pole star in [[30th century BC|3000 BC]], is much less conspicuous at magnitude 3.67 (one-fifth as bright as Polaris); today it is invisible in [[Light pollution|light-polluted]] urban skies.\n\nWhen Polaris becomes the north star again around 27,800, due to its [[proper motion]] it then will be farther away from the pole than it is now, while in 23,600 BC it came closer to the pole.\n\nIt is more difficult to find the south celestial pole in the sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and the nominal south pole star is [[Sigma Octantis]], which with magnitude 5.5 is barely visible to the naked eye even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when the south celestial pole travels through the [[False Cross]].\n\nThis situation also is seen on a star map. The orientation of the south pole is moving toward the [[Crux|Southern Cross]] constellation. For the last 2,000 years or so, the Southern Cross has pointed to the south celestial pole. As a consequence, the constellation is no longer visible from subtropical northern latitudes, as it was in the time of the [[ancient Greeks]].{{clear|right}}\n\n==Polar shift and equinoxes shift==\n[[Image:Outside view of precession.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Precessional movement as seen from 'outside' the celestial sphere]]\n[[File:Precession animation small new.gif|right|thumb|jmpl|upright=1.3|The 26,000-year cycle of precession as seen from near the Earth.

The Earth's rotation is not depicted to scale – in this span of time, it should rotate over 9 million times.]]\n\nThe images at right attempt to explain the relation between the precession of the Earth's axis and the shift in the equinoxes. These images show the position of the Earth's axis on the ''[[celestial sphere]]'', a fictitious sphere which places the stars according to their position as seen from Earth, regardless of their actual distance. The first image shows the celestial sphere from the outside, with the constellations in mirror image. The second image shows the perspective of a near-Earth position as seen through a very wide angle lens (from which the apparent distortion arises).\n\nThe rotation axis of the Earth describes, over a period of 25,700 years, a small circle (blue) among the stars, centered on the [[ecliptic coordinates|ecliptic]] north pole (the blue ''E'') and with an angular radius of about 23.4°, an angle known as the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The direction of precession is opposite to the daily rotation of the Earth on its axis. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis 5,000 years ago, when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris, marks the axis now.\n\nThe equinoxes occur where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic (red line), that is, where the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the Sun and Earth. (Note that the term \"equinox\" here refers to a point on the celestial sphere so defined, rather than the moment in time when the Sun is overhead at the Equator, though the two meanings are related.) When the axis ''precesses'' from one orientation to another, the equatorial plane of the Earth (indicated by the circular grid around the equator) moves. The celestial equator is just the Earth's equator projected onto the celestial sphere, so it moves as the Earth's equatorial plane moves, and the intersection with the ecliptic moves with it. The positions of the poles and equator ''on Earth'' do not change, only the orientation of the Earth against the fixed stars.\n\nAs seen from the orange grid, 5,000 years ago, the [[vernal equinox]] was close to the star [[Aldebaran]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. Now, as seen from the yellow grid, it has shifted (indicated by the red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]].\n\nStill pictures like these are only first approximations, as they do not take into account the variable speed of the precession, the variable [[Axial tilt|obliquity]] of the ecliptic, the planetary precession (which is a slow rotation of the [[ecliptic plane]] itself, presently around an axis located on the plane, with longitude 174°.8764) and the proper motions of the stars. [[File:Equinox path.png|right|upright=2|thumb|Diagram showing the westward shift of the vernal equinox among the stars over the past six millennia]]\n\nThe precessional eras of each constellation, often known as Great Months<!--essentially the same thing as Astrological Ages-->, are approximately:<ref>{{cite book|last=Kaler|first=James B. |title=The ever-changing sky: a guide to the celestial sphere |date=2002 |type=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521499187 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYLSMsduNqcC&pg=PA152 |authorlink=James B.

It was first explained by Sir [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/sci/A0840032.html The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed., 2007]</ref>\n\nAxial precession is similar to the precession of a spinning top. In both cases, the applied force is due to gravity. For a spinning top, this force tends to be almost parallel to the rotation axis initially and increases as the top slows down. For a gyroscope on a stand it can approach 90 degrees. For the Earth, however, the applied forces of the Sun and the Moon are closer to perpendicular to the axis of rotation.\n\nThe Earth is not a perfect sphere but an [[oblate spheroid]], with an equatorial diameter about 43 kilometers larger than its polar diameter. Because of the Earth's [[axial tilt]], during most of the year the half of this bulge that is closest to the Sun is off-center, either to the north or to the south, and the far half is off-center on the opposite side. The gravitational pull on the closer half is stronger, since gravity decreases with the square of distance, so this creates a small torque on the Earth as the Sun pulls harder on one side of the Earth than the other. The axis of this torque is roughly perpendicular to the axis of the Earth's rotation so the axis of rotation [[precession|precesses]]. If the Earth was a perfect sphere, there would be no precession.\n\nThis average torque is perpendicular to the direction in which the rotation axis is tilted away from the ecliptic pole, so that it does not change the axial tilt itself. The magnitude of the torque from the Sun (or the Moon) varies with the angle between the Earth's spin axis direction and that of the gravitational attraction. It approaches zero when they are perpendicular. For example, this happens at the equinoxes in the case of the interaction with the Sun. This can be seen to be since the near and far points are aligned with the gravitational attraction, so there is no torque due to the difference in gravitational attraction.\n\nAlthough the above explanation involved the Sun, the same explanation holds true for any object moving around the Earth, along or close to the ecliptic, notably, the Moon. The combined action of the Sun and the Moon is called the lunisolar precession. In addition to the steady progressive motion (resulting in a full circle in about 25,700 years) the Sun and Moon also cause small periodic variations, due to their changing positions. These oscillations, in both precessional speed and axial tilt, are known as the [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]. The most important term has a period of 18.6 years and an amplitude of 9.2 arcseconds.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf2-1.php#nutation|title = Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 2|date = 2013-10-29|accessdate = 2015-03-26|website = Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to lunisolar precession, the actions of the other planets of the Solar System cause the whole ecliptic to rotate slowly around an axis which has an ecliptic longitude of about 174° measured on the instantaneous ecliptic. This so-called planetary precession shift amounts to a rotation of the ecliptic plane of 0.47 seconds of arc per year (more than a hundred times smaller than lunisolar precession). The sum of the two precessions is known as the general precession.\n\n==Equations==\n[[Image:Field tidal.svg|thumb|Tidal force on Earth due to the Sun, Moon, or a planet]]\nThe [[tidal force]] on Earth due to a perturbing body (Sun, Moon or planet) is expressed by [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], whereby the gravitational force of the perturbing body on the side of Earth nearest is said to be greater than the gravitational force on the far side by an amount proportional to the difference in the cubes of the distances between the near and far sides. If the gravitational force of the perturbing body acting on the mass of the Earth as a point mass at the center of Earth ( which provides the [[centripetal force]] causing the orbital motion ) is subtracted from the gravitational force of the perturbing body everywhere on the surface of Earth, what remains may be regarded as the tidal force. This gives the paradoxical notion of a force acting away from the satellite but in reality it is simply a lesser force towards that body due to the gradient in the gravitational field. For precession, this tidal force can be grouped into two forces which only act on the [[equatorial bulge]] outside of a mean spherical radius. This [[couple (mechanics)|couple]] can be decomposed into two pairs of components, one pair parallel to Earth's equatorial plane toward and away from the perturbing body which cancel each other out, and another pair parallel to Earth's rotational axis, both toward the [[ecliptic]] plane.<ref>Ivan I.

[[Jay Henry Lieske]] developed an updated theory in 1976, where ''p'' equals 5,029.0966 arcseconds (or 1.3969713 degrees) per Julian century. Modern techniques such as [[VLBI]] and [[Lunar laser ranging|LLR]] allowed further refinements, and the [[International Astronomical Union]] adopted a new constant value in 2000, and new computation methods and polynomial expressions in 2003 and 2006; the '''accumulated''' precession is:<ref name=Capitaine2003>[http://syrte.obspm.fr/iau2006/aa03_412_P03.pdf N.

In any case it must be stressed that this formula is only valid over a ''limited time period''. It is a polynomial expression centred on the J2000 datum, empirically fitted to observational data, not on a deterministic model of the solar system. It is clear that if ''T'' gets large enough (far in the future or far in the past), the ''T''² term will dominate and ''p'' will go to very large values. In reality, more elaborate calculations on the [[numerical model of the Solar System]] show that the precessional ''constants'' have a period of about 41,000 years, the same as the obliquity of the ecliptic. Note that the ''constants'' mentioned here are the linear and all higher terms of the formula above, not the precession itself. That is,\n:''p'' = ''A'' + ''BT'' + ''CT''<sup>2</sup> + …\nis an approximation of\n:''p'' = ''a'' + ''b'' sin (2π''T''/''P''), where ''P'' is the 41,000 year period.\n\nTheoretical models may calculate the constants (coefficients) corresponding to the higher powers of ''T'', but since it is impossible for a (finite) polynomial to match a periodic function over all numbers, the difference in all such approximations will grow without bound as ''T'' increases. However, greater accuracy can be obtained over a limited time span by fitting a high enough order polynomial to observation data, rather than a necessarily imperfect dynamic numerical model. So for present flight trajectory calculations of artificial satellites and spacecraft, the polynomial method gives better accuracy.  In that respect, the International Astronomical Union chose the best-developed available theory. For up to a few centuries in the past and the future, all formulas do not diverge very much. For up to a few thousand years in the past and the future, most agree to some accuracy. For eras farther out, discrepancies become too large – the exact rate and period of precession may not be computed using these polynomials even for a single whole precession period.\n\nThe precession of Earth's axis is a very slow effect, but at the level of accuracy at which astronomers work, it does need to be taken into account on a daily basis. Note that although the precession and the tilt of Earth's axis (the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and thus, are related to each other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.\n\nPrecession exhibits a secular decrease due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] from 59\"/a to 45\"/a (a = [[annum]] = [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]]) during the 500 million year period centered on the present. After short-term fluctuations (tens of thousands of years) are averaged out, the long-term trend can be approximated by the following polynomials for negative and positive time from the present in \"/a, where ''T'' is in [[1,000,000,000|billion]]s of Julian years (Ga):<ref>J.

The jump to this excess over ''p''{{sup|+}} will occur in only {{nowrap|20 Ma}} beginning now because the secular decrease in precession is beginning to cross a resonance in Earth's orbit caused by the other planets.\n\nAccording to Ward, when, in about 1,500 million years, the distance of the Moon, which is continuously increasing from tidal effects, has increased from the current 60.3 to approximately 66.5 Earth radii, resonances from planetary effects will push precession to 49,000 years at first, and then, when the Moon reaches 68 Earth radii in about 2,000 million years, to 69,000 years. This will be associated with wild swings in the obliquity of the ecliptic as well. Ward, however, used the abnormally large modern value for tidal dissipation. Using the 620-million year average provided by [[tidal acceleration#Historical evidence|tidal rhythmites]] of about half the modern value, these resonances will not be reached until about 3,000 and 4,000 million years, respectively. However, due to the gradually increasing luminosity of the Sun, the oceans of the Earth will have vaporized before that time (about 2,100 million years from now).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Age of Aquarius]]\n* [[Astrological age]]\n* [[Astronomical nutation]]\n* [[Axial tilt]]\n* [[Euler angles]]\n* [[Longitude of vernal equinox]]\n* [[Milankovitch cycles]]\n* [[Sidereal year]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite article|first1=A.

Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes.<ref name=Ward>{{cite journal|last1=William Ward|title=Large-Scale Variations in the Obliquity of Mars|journal=Science|volume=181|issue=4096|pages=260–262|date=20 July 1973|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.260|pmid=17730940|bibcode=1973Sci...181..260W}}</ref> The rate varies due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] and [[Planetary core|core]]-[[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] interaction, among other things.

      "text": "[[File:Präzession2.png|thumb|Direction of precession for a negatively-charged particle. The large arrow indicates the external magnetic field, the small arrow the spin angular momentum of the particle.]]\nIn [[physics]], '''Larmor precession''' (named after [[Joseph Larmor]]) is the [[precession]] of the [[magnetic moment]] of an object about an external [[magnetic field]]. Objects with a magnetic moment also have angular momentum and effective internal electric current proportional to their angular momentum; these include [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, other [[fermion]]s, many [[atom]]ic and [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] systems, as well as classical macroscopic systems. The external magnetic field exerts a [[torque]] on the magnetic moment,\n:<math>\\vec{\\tau} =\n\\vec{\\mu}\\times\\vec{B}=\n\\gamma\\vec{J}\\times\\vec{B}</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\vec{\\tau}</math> is the torque, <math>\\vec{\\mu}</math> is the magnetic dipole moment, <math>\\vec{J}</math> is the [[angular momentum]] vector, <math>\\vec{B}</math> is the external magnetic field, <math>\\times</math> symbolizes the [[cross product]], and <math>\\gamma</math> is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] which gives the proportionality constant between the magnetic moment and the angular momentum. The phenomenon is similar to the precession of a tilted classical [[gyroscope]] in an external torque-exerting gravitational field.\n\n==Larmor frequency==\nThe angular momentum vector <math>\\vec{J}</math> precesses about the external field axis with an [[angular frequency]] known as the '''Larmor frequency''',\n:<math>\\omega = -\\gamma B</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular frequency]],<ref>Spin Dynamics, Malcolm H.

The g-factor is the unit-less proportionality factor relating the system's angular momentum to the intrinsic magnetic moment; in classical physics it is just 1.\n\nIn nuclear physics the g-factor of a given system includes the effect of the nucleon spins, their orbital angular momenta, and their couplings. Generally, the g-factors are very difficult to calculate for such many-body systems, but they have been measured to high precision for most nuclei. The Larmor frequency is important in [[NMR spectroscopy]]. The gyromagnetic ratios, which give the Larmor frequencies at a given magnetic field strength, have been measured and tabulated [http://www-lcs.ensicaen.fr/pyPulsar/index.php/List_of_NMR_isotopes here].\n\nCrucially, the Larmor frequency is independent of the polar angle between the applied magnetic field and the magnetic moment direction. This is what makes it a key concept in fields such as [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) and [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR), since the precession rate does not depend on the spatial orientation of the spins.\n\n==Including Thomas precession==\nThe above equation is the one that is used in most applications. However, a full treatment must include the effects of [[Thomas precession]], yielding the equation (in [[CGS units]]) (The CGS units are used so that E has the same units as B):\n:<math>\\omega_s = \\frac{geB}{2mc} + (1-\\gamma)\\frac{eB}{mc\\gamma} = \\frac{eB}{2mc}\\left(g - 2 + \\frac{2}{\\gamma}\\right)</math>\nwhere <math>\\gamma</math> is the relativistic [[Lorentz factor]] (not to be confused with the gyromagnetic ratio above).

It is a [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] [[frame-dragging]] effect.  It is a prediction of general relativity consisting of [[secular variation|secular]] precessions of the longitude of the [[ascending node]] and the [[argument of pericenter]] of a test particle freely orbiting a central spinning mass endowed with [[angular momentum]] <math>S</math>.\n\nThe difference between [[de Sitter precession]] and the Lense–Thirring effect is that the de Sitter effect is due simply to the presence of a central mass, whereas the Lense–Thirring effect is due to the rotation of the central mass. The total precession is calculated by combining the de Sitter precession with the Lense–Thirring precession.\n\nAccording to a recent historical analysis by Pfister,<ref>{{cite journal |last =Pfister |first=H. | title=On the history of the so-called Lense–Thirring effect| journal = General Relativity and Gravitation|date=November 2007|volume =39|issue=11|pages=1735–1748|doi=10.1007/s10714-007-0521-4 | bibcode=2007GReGr..39.1735P|citeseerx=10.1.1.693.4061 }}</ref> the effect should be renamed as [[Einstein]]–Thirring–Lense effect.\n\n==The Lense–Thirring metric==\nThe gravitational field of a spinning spherical body of constant density was studied by Lense and Thirring in 1918, in the [[weak-field approximation]].

One way is to solve for [[geodesics]]; these will then exhibit a [[Coriolis force]]-like term, except that, in this case (unlike the standard Coriolis force), the force is not fictional, but is due to frame dragging induced by the rotating body. So, for example, an (instantaneously) radially infalling geodesic at the equator will satisfy the equation<ref name=abs/>\n\n: <math>0 = r \\frac{d^2 \\varphi}{dt^2} + 2 \\frac{GJ}{c^2r^3} \\frac{dr}{dt},</math>\nwhere\n: <math>t</math> is the time,\n: <math>\\varphi</math> is the [[spherical coordinate system|azimuthal angle]] (longitudinal angle),\n: <math>J = \\Vert S \\Vert</math> is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the spinning massive body.\n\nThe above can be compared to the standard equation for motion subject to the [[Coriolis force]]:\n\n: <math>0 = r \\frac{d^2 \\varphi}{dt^2} + 2 \\omega\\frac{dr}{dt},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega</math> is the [[angular velocity]] of the rotating coordinate system.  Note that, in either case, if the observer is not in radial motion, i.e. if <math>dr/dt = 0</math>, there is no effect on the observer.\n\n==Precession==\nThe frame-dragging effect will cause a [[gyroscope]] to [[precess]]. The rate of precession is given by<ref name=mtw/>\n\n: <math>\\Omega^k = \\frac{G}{c^2 r^3} \\left[S^k - 3 \\frac{(S \\cdot x) x^k}{r^2}\\right],</math>\nwhere:\n: <math>\\Omega</math> is the [[angular velocity]] of the precession, a vector, and <math>\\Omega_k</math> one of its components,\n: <math>S_k</math> the angular momentum of the spinning body, as before,\n: <math>S \\cdot x</math> the ordinary flat-metric [[inner product]] of the position and the angular momentum.\n\nThat is, if the gyroscope's angular momentum relative to the fixed stars is <math>L^i</math>, then it precesses as\n\n: <math>\\frac{dL^i}{dt} = \\epsilon_{ijk} \\Omega^j L^k.</math>\n\nThe rate of precession is given by\n\n: <math>\\epsilon_{ijk} \\Omega^k = \\Gamma_{ij0},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma_{ij0}</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]] for the above metric. \"[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]\" by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler<ref name=mtw/> provides hints on how to most easily calculate this.\n\n==Gravitomagnetic analysis==\nIt is popular in some circles to use the [[gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic]] approach to the [[linearized gravity|linearized field equations]]. The reason for this popularity should be immediately evident below, by contrasting it to the difficulties of working with the equations above. The linearized metric <math>h_{\\mu\\nu} = g_{\\mu\\nu} - \\eta_{\\mu\\nu}</math> can be read off from the Lense–Thirring metric given above, where <math>ds^2 = g_{\\mu\\nu} \\,dx^\\mu \\,dx^\\nu</math>, and <math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu} \\,dx^\\mu \\,dx^\\nu = c^2 \\,dt^2 - dx^2 - dy^2 - dz^2</math>. In this approach, one writes the linearized metric, given in terms of the gravitomagneitc potentials <math>\\phi</math> and <math>\\vec{A}</math> is\n\n: <math>h_{00} = \\frac{-2\\phi}{c^2}</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>h_{0i} = \\frac{2A_i}{c^2},</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\phi = \\frac{-GM}{r}</math>\n\nis the gravito-electric potential, and\n\n: <math>\\vec{A} = \\frac {G}{r^3c} \\vec{S} \\times \\vec{r}</math>\n\nis the gravitomagnetic potential. Here <math>\\vec{r}</math> is the 3D spatial coordinate of the observer, and <math>\\vec{S}</math> is the angular momentum of the rotating body, exactly as defined above. The corresponding fields are\n\n: <math>\\vec{E} = -\\nabla\\phi - \\frac{1}{2c} \\frac{\\partial \\vec{A}}{\\partial t}</math>\n\nfor the gravito-electric field, and\n\n: <math>\\vec{B} = \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{\\nabla} \\times \\vec{A}</math>\n\nis the gravitomagnetic field. It is then a matter of plugging and chugging to obtain\n\n: <math>\\vec{B} = -\\frac{G}{2cr^3} \\left[ \\vec{S} - 3 \\frac{(\\vec{S}\\cdot\\vec{r}) \\vec{r}}{r^2}\\right]</math>\n\nas the gravitomagnetic field. Note that it is half the Lense–Thirring precession frequency. In this context, Lense–Thirring precession can essentially be viewed as a form of [[Larmor precession]]. The factor of 1/2 suggests that the correct gravitomagnetic analog of the [[g-factor (physics)|gyromagnetic ratio]] is (curiously!) two.\n\nThe gravitomagnetic analog of the [[Lorentz force]] is given by\n\n: <math>\\vec{F} = m \\vec{E} + 4m \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{B},</math>\n\nwhere <math>m</math> is the mass of a test particle moving with velocity <math>\\vec{v}</math>. This can be used in a straightforward way to compute the classical motion of bodies in the gravitomagnetic field.  For example, a radially infalling body will have a velocity <math>\\vec{v} = -\\hat{r} \\,dr/dt</math>; direct substitution yields the Coriolis term given in a previous section.\n\n==Example: Foucault's pendulum==\nTo get a sense of the magnitude of the effect, the above can be used to compute the rate of precession of [[Foucault's pendulum]], located at the surface of the Earth.\n\nFor a solid ball of uniform density, such as the Earth, of radius <math>R</math>, the [[moment of inertia]] [[List of moments of inertia|is given by]] <math>2MR^2/5,</math> so that the absolute value of the angular momentum <math>S</math> is <math>\\Vert S\\Vert = 2MR^2\\omega/5,</math> with <math>\\omega</math> the angular speed of the spinning ball.\n\nThe direction of the spin of the Earth may be taken as the ''z'' axis, whereas the axis of the pendulum is perpendicular to the Earth's surface, in the radial direction.  Thus, we may take <math>\\hat{z} \\cdot \\hat{r} = \\cos\\theta</math>, where <math>\\theta</math> is the [[latitude]].  Similarly, the location of the observer <math>r</math> is at the Earth's surface <math>R</math>.  This leaves rate of precession is as\n\n: <math>\\Omega_\\text{LT} = \\frac{2}{5} \\frac{G M \\omega}{c^2 R} \\cos\\theta.</math>\n\nAs an example the latitude of the city of [[Nijmegen]] in the Netherlands is used for reference.

As in Figure 2, the result is the sum of a prograde and a retrograde circular polarized wave.

What may be less evident is that even tightly fitting parts have relative clearance due to their elasticity, metals not being rigid materials as is evident from steel springs. Under load, micro deformations, enough to cause motion, occur in such joints. This can be seen from wear marks where pedal spindles seat on crank faces.\"<ref name=Brandt/>\n\nThis precession is a process purely due to [[contact force]]s and does not depend on inertia and is not inversely proportional to spin rate. It is completely unrelated to torque-free and torque-induced [[precession]].\n\n==Examples==\nPrecession caused by fretting can cause fastenings under large torque loads to unscrew themselves.\n\n===Automobile lug nuts===\nAutomobiles have also used left-threaded [[lug nut]]s on left-side wheels, but now commonly use tapered lug nuts, which do not precess.\n\n===Bicycle pedals===\n[[Bicycle pedal]]s are left-threaded on the left-hand [[Crankset#Cranks|crank]] so that precession tightens the pedal rather than loosening it. This may seem counter-intuitive, but the torque exerted due to the precession is several orders of magnitude greater than that caused by a jammed pedal bearing.\n\nShimano SPD axle units, which can be unscrewed from the pedal body for servicing, have a left-hand thread where the axle unit screws into the right-hand pedal; the opposite case to the pedal-crank interface. Otherwise precession of the pedal body around the axle would tend to unscrew one from the other.\n\n===Bicycle bottom brackets===\nEnglish threaded bicycle [[bottom bracket]]s are left-threaded on the right-hand (usually drive) side into the [[Bicycle frame#Bottom bracket shell|bottom bracket shell]]. This is the opposite of pedals into cranks because the sense of the relative motion between the parts is opposite.  (Italian and French threaded bottom brackets have right-hand threading on both sides.)\n\n===Bearings in manual transmissions===\nA bearing supported gear in a [[Manual transmission#Maintenance|manual transmission]] rotates synchronously with its shaft due to the dog-gear engagement. In this case, the small diametrical clearance in the bearing will induce precession of the roller group relative to the gear mitigating any fretting that occurs if the same bearing rollers always push against the same spot on the gear. Typically the 4th and 5th gears will have precession inducing features, while 1st through 3rd gears might not since cars spend less time in those gears. Transmission failure due to lack of precession is possible in gear boxes when low gears are engaged for long periods of time.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fretting]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanics]]\n[[Category:Precession]]"

      "text": "{{distinguish|Thomas rotation}}\n{{spacetime}}\n\n[[File:Thomas,Llewellyn 1926 Kopenhagen.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Llewellyn Thomas]] (1903 – 1992)]]\n\nIn [[physics]], the '''Thomas precession''', named after [[Llewellyn Thomas]], is a [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] correction that applies to the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of an elementary particle or the rotation of a macroscopic [[gyroscope]] and relates the [[angular velocity]] of the spin of a particle following a [[curvilinear]] orbit to the angular velocity of the orbital motion.\n\nFor a given [[inertial frame]], if a second frame is Lorentz-boosted relative to it, and a third boosted relative to the second, but non-colinear with the first boost, then the Lorentz transformation between the first and third frames involves a combined boost and rotation, known as the \"[[Wigner rotation]]\" or \"Thomas rotation\". For accelerated motion, the accelerated frame has an inertial frame at every instant. Two boosts a small time interval (as measured in the lab frame) apart leads to a Wigner rotation after the second boost. In the limit the time interval tends to zero, the accelerated frame will rotate at every instant, so the accelerated frame rotates with an angular velocity.\n\nThe precession can be understood geometrically as a consequence of the fact that the [[mathematical space|space]] of velocities in relativity is [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]], and so [[parallel transport]] of a vector (the gyroscope's angular velocity) around a circle (its linear velocity) leaves it pointing in a different direction, or understood algebraically as being a result of the [[non-commutativity]] of [[Lorentz transformation]]s. Thomas precession gives a correction to the [[spin–orbit interaction]] in [[quantum mechanics]], which takes into account the [[relativistic time dilation]] between the [[electron]] and the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]].\n\nThomas precession is a [[kinematic|kinematic effect]] in the [[flat spacetime]] of [[special relativity]]. In the curved spacetime of [[general relativity]], Thomas precession combines with a geometric effect to produce [[de Sitter precession]]. Although Thomas precession (''net rotation after a trajectory that returns to its initial velocity'') is a purely kinematic effect, it only occurs in curvilinear motion and therefore cannot be observed independently of some external force causing the curvilinear motion such as that caused by an [[electromagnetic field]], a [[gravitational field]] or a mechanical force, so Thomas precession is usually accompanied by [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamical effects]].<ref>{{harvnb|Malykin|2006}}</ref>\n\nIf the system experiences no external torque, e.g., in external scalar fields, its spin dynamics is determined only by the Thomas precession. A single discrete Thomas rotation (as opposed to the series of infinitesimal rotations that add up to the Thomas precession) is present in situations anytime there are three or more inertial frames in non-collinear motion, as can be seen using [[Lorentz transformation]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThomas precession in relativity was already known to [[Ludwik Silberstein]],<ref>{{harvnb|Silberstein|1914|p=169}}</ref> in 1914. But the only knowledge Thomas had of relativistic precession came from [[de Sitter]]'s paper on the relativistic precession of the moon, first published in a book by [[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eddington|1924}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Thomas relativistically recomputed the precessional frequency of the doublet separation in the fine structure of the atom. He thus found the missing factor 1/2, which came to be known as the Thomas half.\n\nThis discovery of the relativistic precession of the electron spin led to the understanding of the significance of the relativistic effect. The effect was consequently named \"Thomas precession\".\n\n== Introduction ==\n\n=== Definition ===\nConsider a physical system moving through [[Minkowski spacetime]]. Assume that there is at any moment an inertial system such that in it, the system is at rest. This assumption is sometimes called the third postulate of relativity.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980}}</ref> This means that at any instant, the coordinates and state of the system can be Lorentz transformed to the lab system through ''some'' Lorentz transformation.\n\nLet the system be subject to ''external forces'' that produce no [[torque]] with respect to its center of mass in its (instantaneous) rest frame. The condition of \"no torque\" is necessary to isolate the phenomenon of Thomas precession. As a simplifying assumption one assumes that the external forces bring the system back to its initial velocity after some finite time. Fix a Lorentz frame {{mvar|O}} such that the initial and final velocities are zero.\n\nThe '''Pauli&ndash;Lubanski spin vector''' {{mvar|S<sub>μ</sub>}} is defined to be {{math|(0, ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>)}} in the system's ''rest'' frame, with {{mvar|S<sub>i</sub>}} the angular-momentum three-vector about the center of mass. In the motion from initial to final position, {{mvar|S<sub>μ</sub>}} undergoes a rotation, as recorded in {{mvar|O}}, from its initial to its final value. This continuous change is the Thomas precession.<ref>{{harvnb|Ben-Menahem|1986}}</ref>\n\n===Statement===\n\n[[File:Thomas precession coefficient.svg|thumb|400px|Value of {{math|''γ''<sup>2</sup>/(''γ'' + 1)}} as {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''v/c''}} increases, with ''v'' the instantaneous magnitude of the particle's velocity. The Thomas rotation is negligible for {{math|''β'' < 0.5}}, increases steadily for {{math|0.5 < ''β'' < 0.8}}, then rapidly shoots to infinity as {{math|''β''}} tends to 1. The \"Thomas half\" is evident in the low-speed limit, and the rotation is only very clear for speeds approaching that of light.]]\n\nConsider the motion of a [[particle]]. Introduce a [[lab frame]] {{math|Σ}} in which an observer can measure the relative motion of the particle. At each instant of time the particle has an [[inertial frame]] in which it is at rest. Relative to this lab frame, the instantaneous velocity of the particle is {{math|'''v'''(''t'')}} with magnitude {{math|{{abs|'''v'''}} {{=}} ''v''}} bounded by the [[speed of light]] {{mvar|c}}, so that {{math|0 ≤ ''v'' < ''c''}}. Here the time {{mvar|t}} is the [[coordinate time]] as measured in the lab frame, ''not'' the [[proper time]] of the particle.\n\nApart from the upper limit on magnitude, the velocity of the particle is arbitrary and not necessarily constant, its corresponding vector of [[acceleration]] is {{math|'''a''' {{=}} ''d'''''v'''(''t'')/''dt''}}. As a result of the Wigner rotation at every instant, the particle's frame precesses with an [[angular velocity]] given by the<ref>{{harvnb|Jackson|1975|page=543–546}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|page=288}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sard|1970|page=280}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sexl|Urbantke|1992|page=42}}</ref>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|title='''Thomas precession'''\n|equation = <math>\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_\\text{T}  = \\frac{1}{c^2}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma^2}{\\gamma+1}\\right)\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{v} </math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border = 1\n|border colour = black\n|background colour=white}}\n\nwhere × is the [[cross product]] and\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\dfrac{|\\mathbf{v}(t)|^2}{c^2}}}</math>\n\nis the instantaneous [[Lorentz factor]], a function of the particle's instantaneous velocity. Like any angular velocity, {{math|'''ω'''<sub>T</sub>}} is a [[pseudovector]]; its magnitude is the angular speed the particle's frame precesses (in [[radian]]s per second), and the direction points along the rotation axis. As is usual, the right-hand convention of the cross product is used (see [[right-hand rule]]).\n\nThe precession depends on ''accelerated'' motion, and the non-[[collinear]]ity of the particle's instantaneous velocity and acceleration. No precession occurs if the particle moves with uniform velocity (constant {{math|'''v'''}} so {{math|'''a''' {{=}} '''0'''}}), or accelerates in a straight line (in which case {{math|'''v'''}} and {{math|'''a'''}} are parallel or antiparallel so their cross product is zero). The particle has to move in a curve, say an arc, [[spiral]], [[helix]], or a [[circular orbit]] or [[elliptical orbit]], for its frame to precess. The angular velocity of the precession is a maximum if the velocity and acceleration vectors are perpendicular throughout the motion (a circular orbit), and is large if their magnitudes are large (the magnitude of {{math|'''v'''}} is almost {{mvar|c}}).\n\nIn the non-relativistic limit, {{math|'''v''' → '''0'''}} so {{math|''γ'' → 1}}, and the angular velocity is approximately\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_\\text{T} \\approx \\frac{1}{2c^2}\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{v} </math>\n\nThe factor of 1/2 turns out to be the critical factor to agree with experimental results. It is informally known as the \"Thomas half\".\n\n==Mathematical explanation==\n\n===Lorentz transformations===\n\nThe description of relative motion involves [[Lorentz transformation]]s, and it is convenient to use them in [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] form; symbolic matrix expressions summarize the transformations and are easy to manipulate, and when required the full matrices can be written explicitly. Also, to prevent extra factors of {{mvar|c}} cluttering the equations, it is convenient to use the definition {{math|'''β'''(''t'') {{=}} '''v'''(''t'')/''c''}} with magnitude {{math|{{abs|'''β'''}} {{=}} ''β''}} such that {{math|0 ≤ ''β'' < 1}}.\n\nThe spacetime coordinates of the lab frame are collected into a 4×1 [[column vector]], and the boost is represented as a 4×4 [[symmetric matrix]], respectively\n\n:<math>X = \\begin{bmatrix} c t \\\\ x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix}\\,,\\quad B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \n\\begin{bmatrix} \\gamma&-\\gamma\\beta_x &-\\gamma\\beta_y&-\\gamma\\beta_z\\\\ \n-\\gamma\\beta_x &1+(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_x^2}{\\beta^2} &(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_x \\beta_y}{\\beta^2} &(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_x \\beta_z}{\\beta^2} \\\\ \n-\\gamma\\beta_y &(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_y \\beta_x}{\\beta^2} &1+(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_y^2}{\\beta^2} &(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_y \\beta_z}{\\beta^2} \\\\ \n-\\gamma\\beta_z&(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_z \\beta_x}{\\beta^2} &(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_z \\beta_y}{\\beta^2} & 1+(\\gamma-1)\\dfrac{\\beta_z^2}{\\beta^2} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nand turn\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}|^2}}</math>\n\nis the [[Lorentz factor]] of {{math|'''β'''}}. In other frames, the corresponding coordinates are also arranged into column vectors. The [[inverse matrix]] of the boost corresponds to a boost in the opposite direction, and is given by {{math|''B''('''β''')<sup>−1</sup> {{=}} ''B''(−'''β''')}}.\n\nAt an instant of lab-recorded time {{mvar|t}} measured in the lab frame, the transformation of spacetime coordinates from the lab frame {{math|Σ}} to the particle's frame Σ{{math|&prime;}} is\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X' = B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta})X </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nand at later lab-recorded time {{math|''t'' + Δ''t''}} we can define a new frame {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}} for the particle, which moves with velocity {{math|'''β''' + Δ'''β'''}} relative to {{math|Σ}}, and the corresponding boost is\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X'' = B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta})X </math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nThe vectors {{math|'''β'''}} and {{math|Δ'''β'''}} are two separate vectors. The latter is a small increment, and can be conveniently split into components parallel ( ‖ ) and perpendicular (⊥) to {{math|'''β'''}}<ref group=nb>Explicitly, using [[vector projection]] and rejection relative to the direction of {{math|'''β'''}} gives\n\n:<math>\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\parallel = \\frac{\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{\\beta^2}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\,,\\quad \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\perp = \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta} - \\frac{\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}{\\beta^2}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} </math>\n\nbut it is easier to simply use the parallel-perpendicular components.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\parallel + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_\\perp</math>\n\nCombining ({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}) obtains the Lorentz transformation between {{math|Σ&prime;}} and {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}},\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X'' = B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta})B(-\\boldsymbol{\\beta})X' \\,, </math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nand this composition contains all the required information about the motion between these two lab times. Notice {{math|''B''('''β''' + Δ'''β''')''B''(−'''β''')}} and {{math|''B''('''β''' + Δ'''β''')}} are infinitesimal transformations because they involve a small increment in the relative velocity, while {{math|''B''(−'''β''')}} is not.\n\nThe composition of ''two'' boosts equates to a single boost combined with a [[Wigner rotation]] about an axis perpendicular to the relative velocities;\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\Lambda = B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta})B(-\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = R(\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta})B(\\Delta\\mathbf{b})  </math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe rotation is given by is a 4×4 rotation matrix {{math|''R''}} in the [[axis–angle representation]], and coordinate systems are taken to be [[orientation (vector space)|right-handed]]. This matrix rotates 3d vectors anticlockwise about an axis ([[active transformation]]), or equivalently rotates coordinate frames clockwise about the same axis (passive transformation). The axis-angle vector {{math|Δ'''θ'''}} parametrizes the rotation, its magnitude {{math|Δ''θ''}} is the angle {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}} has rotated, and direction is parallel to the rotation axis, in this case the axis is parallel to the [[cross product]] {{math|(−'''β''')×('''β''' + Δ'''β''') {{=}} −'''β'''×Δ'''β'''}}. If the angles are negative, then the sense of rotation is reversed. The inverse matrix is given by {{math|''R''(Δ'''θ''')<sup>−1</sup> {{=}} ''R''(−Δ'''θ''')}}.\n\nCorresponding to the boost is the (small change in the) boost vector {{math|Δ'''b'''}}, with magnitude and direction of the relative velocity of the boost (divided by {{math|''c''}}). The boost {{math|''B''(Δ'''b''')}} and rotation {{math|''R''(Δ'''θ''')}} here are infinitesimal transformations because {{math|Δ'''b'''}} and rotation {{math|Δ'''θ'''}} are small.\n\nThe rotation gives rise to the Thomas precession, but there is a subtlety. To interpret the particle's frame as a co-moving inertial frame relative to the lab frame, and agree with the non-relativistic limit, we expect the transformation between the particle's instantaneous frames at times {{math|''t''}} and {{math|''t'' + Δ''t''}} to be related by a boost ''without'' rotation. Combining ({{EquationNote|3}}) and ({{EquationNote|4}}) and rearranging gives\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>B(\\Delta\\mathbf{b})X' = R(-\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) X'' = X''' \\,, </math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nwhere another instantaneous frame {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;&prime;}} is introduced with coordinates {{math|''X''&prime;&prime;&prime;}}, to prevent conflation with {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}}. To summarize the frames of reference: in the lab frame {{math|Σ}} an observer measures the motion of the particle, and three instantaneous inertial frames in which the particle is at rest are {{math|Σ&prime;}} (at time {{mvar|t}}), {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}} (at time {{math|''t'' + Δ''t''}}), and {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;&prime;}} (at time {{math|''t'' + Δ''t''}}). The frames {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;}} and {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;&prime;}} are at the same location and time, they differ only by a rotation. By contrast {{math|Σ&prime;}} and {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;&prime;}} differ by a boost and lab time interval {{math|Δ''t''}}.\n\nRelating the coordinates {{math|''X''&prime;&prime;&prime;}} to the lab coordinates {{math|''X''}} via ({{EquationNote|5}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}});\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>X''' = R(-\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) X'' = R(-\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) B(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\beta}) X  \\,, </math>|{{EquationRef|6}}}}\n\nthe frame {{math|Σ&prime;&prime;&prime;}} is rotated in the negative sense.\n\nThe rotation is between two instants of lab time. As {{math|Δ''t'' → 0}}, the particle's frame rotates at every instant, and the continuous motion of the particle amounts to a continuous rotation with an [[angular velocity]] at every instant. Dividing {{math|−Δ'''θ'''}} by {{math|Δ''t''}}, and taking the [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] {{math|Δ''t'' → 0}}, the angular velocity is by definition\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_T = -\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0 }\\frac{\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}{\\Delta t} </math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\n\nIt remains to find what {{math|Δ'''θ'''}} precisely is.\n\n===Extracting the formula===\n\nThe composition can be obtained by explicitly calculating the matrix product.

The spin 4-vector is orthogonal to the velocity 4-vector.  Fermi-Walker transport preserves this relation.  One finds that the dot product of the acceleration 4-vector with the spin 4-vector varies sinusoidally with time with an angular frequency Ύ ω, where ω is the angular frequency of the circular motion and Ύ=1/√⟨1-v^2/c^2).  This is easily shown by taking the second time derivative of that dot product.  Because this angular frequency exceeds ω, the spin precesses in the retrograde direction.  The difference (γ-1)ω is the Thomas precession angular frequency already given, as is simply shown by realizing that that the magnitude of the 3-acceleration is ω v.\n\n== Applications ==\n\n=== In electron orbitals ===\n\nIn quantum mechanics '''Thomas precession''' is a correction to the [[spin-orbit interaction]], which takes into account the [[special relativity|relativistic]] [[time dilation]] between the [[electron]] and the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] in [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogenic atom]]s.\n\nBasically, it states that spinning objects [[precess]] when they accelerate in [[special relativity]] because [[Lorentz boost]]s do not commute with each other.\n\nTo calculate the spin of a particle in a [[magnetic field]], one must also take into account [[Larmor precession]].\n\n=== In a Foucault pendulum ===\n\nThe rotation of the swing plane of [[Foucault pendulum]] can be treated as a result of [[parallel transport]] of the pendulum in a 2-dimensional sphere of Euclidean space. The [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic]] space of velocities in [[Minkowski spacetime]] represents a 3-dimensional (pseudo-) sphere with imaginary radius and imaginary timelike coordinate. Parallel transport of a spinning particle in relativistic velocity space leads to Thomas precession, which is similar to the rotation of the swing plane of a Foucault pendulum.<ref>{{harvnb|Krivoruchenko|2009}}</ref> The angle of rotation in both cases is determined by the area integral of curvature in agreement with the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]].\n\nThomas precession gives a correction to the precession of a Foucault pendulum. For a Foucault pendulum located in the city of Nijmegen in the Netherlands the correction is:\n\n:<math>\\omega \\approx 9.5 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\, \\mathrm{arcseconds} / \\mathrm{day}.</math>\n\nNote that it is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the precession due to the general-relativistic correction arising from [[frame-dragging]], the [[Lense–Thirring precession]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Velocity-addition formula]]\n* [[Relativistic angular momentum]]\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Ben-Menahem|first=A.|title=Wigner's rotation revisited|journal=Am.

The integrated field that studies the combination of sensors, actuators and algorithms is called \"Guidance, Navigation and Control\" (GNC).\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{cleanup merge|3-axis stabilized spacecraft|date=September 2013}}\n\nA spacecraft's attitude must typically be stabilized and controlled for a variety of reasons. It is oftentimes needed so that the spacecraft [[high-gain antenna]] may be accurately pointed to Earth for communications, so that onboard experiments may accomplish precise pointing for accurate collection and subsequent interpretation of data, so that the heating and cooling effects of sunlight and shadow may be used intelligently for thermal control, and also for guidance: short propulsive maneuvers must be executed in the right direction.\n\n===Types of stabilization===\n<!-- Note that this section is the target of two redirects: [[Spin-stabilized satellite]] and [[3-axis stabilized spacecraft]]. If you change the section title or re-do the sections in this article, make sure to point these redirects to the correct place!! -->\nThere are two principal approaches to stabilizing attitude control on spacecraft:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n*'''{{vanchor |Spin stabilization}}''' is accomplished by setting the spacecraft spinning, using the gyroscopic action of the rotating spacecraft mass as the stabilizing mechanism. Propulsion system thrusters are fired only occasionally to make desired changes in spin rate, or in the spin-stabilized attitude. If desired, the spinning may be stopped through the use of thrusters or by [[yo-yo de-spin]]. The [[Pioneer 10]] and [[Pioneer 11]] probes in the outer solar system are examples of spin-stabilized spacecraft.\n*'''{{vanchor |Three-axis stabilization}}''' is an alternative method of spacecraft attitude control in which the spacecraft is held fixed in the desired orientation without any rotation.\n**One method is to use small  thrusters to continually nudge the spacecraft back and forth within a [[deadband]] of allowed attitude error. Thrusters may also be referred to as mass-expulsion control (MEC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf11-2.php|title=Basics of Space Flight Section II. Space Flight Projects|publisher=[[Nasa.gov]]|accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref> systems, or [[reaction control system]]s (RCS). The space probes [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]] employ this method, and have used up about three quarters<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/weekly-reports/2015-01-16.html|title=Voyager Weekly Reports|publisher=Nasa.gov|accessdate=2015-07-15}}</ref> of their 100&nbsp;kg of propellant as of July 2015. \n**Another method for achieving three-axis stabilization is to use electrically powered [[reaction wheel]]s, also called momentum wheels, which are mounted on three orthogonal axes aboard the spacecraft. They provide a means to trade [[angular momentum]] back and forth between spacecraft and wheels. To rotate the vehicle on a given axis, the reaction wheel on that axis is accelerated in the opposite direction. To rotate the vehicle back, the wheel is slowed. Excess momentum that builds up in the system due to external torques from, for example, solar photon pressure or [[gravity gradient]]s, must be occasionally removed from the system by applying controlled torque to the spacecraft to allowing the wheels to return to a desired speed under computer control. This is done during maneuvers called momentum desaturation or momentum unload maneuvers. Most spacecraft use a system of thrusters to apply the torque for desaturation maneuvers. A different approach was used by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], which had sensitive optics that could be contaminated by thruster exhaust, and instead used [[magnetic torquers]] for desaturation maneuvers.\n\nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both spin stabilization and three-axis stabilization. Spin-stabilized craft provide a continuous sweeping motion that is desirable for fields and particles instruments, as well as some optical scanning instruments, but they may require complicated systems to de-spin antennas or optical instruments that must be pointed at targets for science observations or communications with Earth. Three-axis controlled craft can point optical instruments and antennas without having to de-spin them, but they may have to carry out special rotating maneuvers to best utilize their fields and particle instruments. If thrusters are used for routine stabilization, optical observations such as imaging must be designed knowing that the spacecraft is always slowly rocking back and forth, and not always exactly predictably. Reaction wheels provide a much steadier spacecraft from which to make observations, but they add mass to the spacecraft, they have a limited mechanical lifetime, and they require frequent momentum desaturation maneuvers, which can perturb navigation solutions because of accelerations imparted by the use of thrusters.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Articulation===\nMany spacecraft have components that require articulation. [[Voyager program|Voyager]] and [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], for example, were designed with scan platforms for pointing optical instruments at their targets largely independently of spacecraft orientation. Many spacecraft, such as Mars orbiters, have solar panels that must track the Sun so they can provide electrical power to the spacecraft. [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini's]] main engine nozzles were steerable. Knowing where to point a solar panel, or scan platform, or a nozzle — that is, how to articulate it — requires knowledge of the spacecraft's attitude. Because a single subsystem keeps track of the spacecraft's attitude, the Sun's location, and Earth's location, it can compute the proper direction to point the appendages. It logically falls to the same subsystem – the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), then, to manage both attitude and articulation. The name AACS may even be carried over to a spacecraft even if it has no appendages to articulate.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n== Geometry ==\n{{main|Attitude (geometry)}}\n{{summarize|from|Attitude (geometry)|date=September 2013}}\n{{expand section|small=n|date=September 2013}}\n\n== Sensors ==\n\n===Relative attitude sensors===\nMany sensors generate outputs that reflect the rate of change in attitude. These require a known initial attitude, or external information to use them to determine attitude. Many of this class of sensor have some noise, leading to inaccuracies if not corrected by absolute attitude sensors.\n\n====Gyroscopes====\n[[Gyroscope]]s are devices that sense rotation in [[three-dimensional space]] without reliance on the observation of external objects. Classically, a gyroscope consists of a spinning mass, but there are also \"[[Laser ring gyroscope|ring laser gyros]]\" utilizing coherent light reflected around a closed path. Another type of \"gyro\" is a [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|hemispherical resonator gyro]] where a crystal cup shaped like a wine glass can be driven into oscillation just as a wine glass \"sings\" as a finger is rubbed around its rim. The orientation of the oscillation is fixed in inertial space, so measuring the orientation of the oscillation relative to the spacecraft can be used to sense the motion of the spacecraft with respect to inertial space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Documents/hrg.pdf|title=Hemispherical Resonator Gyros|publisher=Northropgrumman.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref>\n\n====Motion reference units====\nMotion reference units are a kind of [[inertial measurement unit]] with single- or multi-axis motion sensors. They utilize [[Vibrating structure gyroscope#MEMS Gyroscopes|MEMS gyroscopes]]. Some multi-axis MRUs are capable of measuring [[Six degrees of freedom|roll, pitch, yaw and heave]]. They have applications outside the aeronautical field, such as:<ref>{{cite web|title=MRU Applications|url=http://www.km.kongsberg.com/ks/web/nokbg0240.nsf/AllWeb/2582AE354AD7FF31C1257BC5003041CA?OpenDocument|publisher=Kongsberg Maritime AS |accessdate=29 Jan 2015}}</ref>\n\n* [[antenna (radio)|Antenna]] motion compensation and stabilization\n* [[Dynamic positioning]]\n* [[Active heave compensation|Heave compensation]] of offshore cranes\n* High speed craft motion control and damping systems\n* Hydro acoustic positioning\n* Motion compensation of single and [[multibeam echosounder]]s\n* Ocean wave measurements\n* Offshore structure motion monitoring\n* Orientation and attitude measurements on [[Autonomous underwater vehicle]]s and [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s\n* Ship motion monitoring\n\n===Absolute attitude sensors===\n\nThis class of sensors sense the position or orientation of fields, objects or other phenomena outside the spacecraft.\n\n====Horizon sensor====\nA ''horizon sensor'' is an optical instrument that detects light from the 'limb' of Earth's atmosphere, i.e., at the horizon. [[Infrared#Heat|Thermal infrared]] sensing is often used, which senses the comparative warmth of the atmosphere, compared to the much colder [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic background]]. This sensor provides orientation with respect to Earth about two orthogonal axes. It tends to be less precise than sensors based on stellar observation. Sometimes referred to as an Earth sensor.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n====Orbital gyrocompass====\nSimilar to the way that a terrestrial [[gyrocompass]] uses a [[pendulum]] to sense local gravity and force its gyro into alignment with Earth's spin vector, and therefore point north, an ''orbital gyrocompass'' uses a horizon sensor to sense the direction to Earth's center, and a gyro to sense rotation about an axis normal to the orbit plane. Thus, the horizon sensor provides pitch and roll measurements, and the gyro provides yaw.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} See [[Tait-Bryan angles]].\n\n====Sun sensor====\nA [[sun sensor]] is a device that senses the direction to the [[Sun]]. This can be as simple as some [[solar cell]]s and shades, or as complex as a steerable [[telescope]], depending on mission requirements.\n\n====Earth sensor====\nAn ''Earth sensor'' is a device that senses the direction to [[Earth]]. It is usually an [[infrared camera]]; nowadays the main method to detect attitude is the [[star tracker]], but Earth sensors are still integrated in satellites for their low cost and reliability.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n====Star tracker====\n{{main|Star tracker}}\n[[File:STARS on EBEX ld2012 image.png|thumb|The STARS real-time star tracking software operates on an image from [[The E and B Experiment|EBEX]] 2012, a high-altitude balloon-borne cosmology experiment launched from Antarctica on 2012-12-29]]\n\nA ''star tracker'' is an optical device that measures the position(s) of [[star]](s) using [[photocell]](s) or a camera.<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Camera|url=http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=25 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721054014/http://nmp.nasa.gov/st6/TECHNOLOGY/star_camera.html|archivedate=July 21, 2011|date=May 2004}}</ref> It uses magnitude of brightness and spectral type to identify and then calculate the relative position of stars around it.\n\n====Magnetometer====\nA ''[[magnetometer]]'' is a device that senses [[magnetic field]] strength and, when used in a three-axis triad, magnetic field direction. As a spacecraft navigational aid, sensed field strength and direction is compared to a map of [[Earth's magnetic field]] stored in the memory of an on-board or ground-based guidance computer. If spacecraft position is known then attitude can be inferred.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n==Algorithms==\n[[Algorithms|Control algorithms]] are [[computer program]]s that receive data from vehicle sensors and derive the appropriate commands to the actuators to rotate the vehicle to the desired attitude. The algorithms range from very simple, e.g. [[proportional control]], to complex nonlinear estimators or many in-between types, depending on mission requirements. Typically, the attitude control algorithms are part of the [[Computer software|software]] running on the [[Computer hardware|hardware]], which receives commands from the ground and formats vehicle data [[telemetry]] for transmission to a ground station.\n\nThe attitude control algorithms are written and implemented based on requirement for a particular attitude maneuver. Asides the implementation of passive attitude control such as the [[gravity-gradient stabilization]], most spacecrafts make use of active control which exhibits a typical attitude control loop. The design of the control algorithm depends on the actuator to be used for the specific attitude maneuver although using a simple [[PID controller|'''proportional–integral–derivative controller''' ('''PID controller''')]] satisfies most control needs.\n\nThe appropriate commands to the actuators are obtained based on error signals described as the difference between the measured and desired attitude. The error signals are commonly measured as [[euler angles]] (Φ, θ, Ψ), however an alternative to this could be described in terms of [[direction cosine]] matrix or error [[quaternion]]<nowiki/>s. The PID controller which is most common reacts to an error signal (deviation) based on attitude as follows\n\n<math>T_c (t) = K_\\text{p} e(t) + K_\\text{i} \\int_0^t e(\\tau) \\,d\\tau + K_\\text{d} \\dot{e}(t),</math>\n\nwhere <math>T_c </math> is the control torque, <math> e</math> is the attitude deviation signal, and  <math> K_\\text{p}, K_\\text{i}, K_\\text{d} </math> are the PID controller parameters.\n\nA simple implementation of this can be the application of the proportional control for [[Nadir|nadir pointing]] making use of either momentum or reaction wheels as actuators. Based on the change in momentum of the wheels, the control law can be defined in 3-axes x, y, z as\n\n<math>T_cx  = -K_\\text{q1} q_1 + K_\\text{w1} {w_x},</math>\n\n<math>T_cy  = -K_\\text{q2} q_2 + K_\\text{w2} {w_y},</math>\n\n<math>T_cz  = -K_\\text{q3} q_3 + K_\\text{w3} {w_z},</math>\n\nThis control algorithm also affects momentum dumping.\n\nAnother important and common control algorithm involves the concept of detumbling, which is attenuating the angular momentum of the spacecraft. The need to detumble the spacecraft arises from the uncontrollable state after release from the launch vehicle. Most spacecraft in [[Low Earth orbit|low earth orbit]] (LEO) makes use of magnetic detumbling concept which utilizes the effect of the earth's magnetic field. The control algorithm is called the B-Dot controller and relies on [[Magnetic torquer|magnetic coils]] or torque rods as control actuators. The control law is based on the measurement of the rate of change of body-fixed [[magnetometer]] signals.\n\n<math>m  = -K\\dot{B}</math>\n\nwhere <math>m  </math> is the commanded magnetic dipole moment of the magnetic torquer and <math>k  </math> is the proportional gain and <math>\\dot{B}  </math> is the rate of change of the Earth's magnetic field.\n\n==Actuators==\nAttitude control can be obtained by several mechanisms, specifically:{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Thrusters===\n{{Main|Reaction control system}}\n[[Vernier thruster]]s are the most common actuators, as they may be used for station keeping as well. Thrusters must be organized as a system to provide stabilization about all three axes, and at least two thrusters are generally used in each axis to provide torque as a [[couple (mechanics)|couple]] in order to prevent imparting a [[translation (geometry)|translation]] to the vehicle. Their limitations are fuel usage, engine wear, and cycles of the control valves. The fuel efficiency of an attitude control system is determined by its [[specific impulse]] (proportional to exhaust velocity) and the smallest torque impulse it can provide (which determines how often the thrusters must fire to provide precise control). Thrusters must be fired in one direction to start rotation, and again in the opposing direction if a new orientation is to be held. Thruster systems have been used on most manned space vehicles, including [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]], [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo]], [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]], and the [[Space Shuttle]].\n\nTo minimize the fuel limitation on mission duration, auxiliary attitude control systems may be used to reduce vehicle rotation to lower levels, such as small [[ion thruster]]s that accelerate ionized gases electrically to extreme velocities, using power from solar cells.\n\n===Spin stabilization===\n{{main|Spin-stabilisation}}\nThe entire space vehicle itself can be spun up to stabilize the orientation of a single vehicle axis. This method is widely used to stabilize the final stage of a launch vehicle. The entire spacecraft and an attached solid rocket motor are spun up about the rocket's thrust axis, on a \"spin table\" oriented by the attitude control system of the lower stage on which the spin table is mounted. When final orbit is achieved, the satellite may be de-spun by various means, or left spinning. Spin stabilization of satellites is only applicable to those missions with a primary axis of orientation that need not change dramatically over the lifetime of the satellite and no need for extremely high precision pointing. It is also useful for missions with instruments that must scan the star field or Earth's surface or atmosphere.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} See [[spin-stabilized satellite]].\n\n===Momentum wheels===\n{{main|Momentum wheel}}\nThese are [[electric motor]] driven rotors made to spin in the direction opposite to that required to re-orient the vehicle. Because momentum wheels make up a small fraction of the spacecraft's mass and are computer controlled, they give precise control. Momentum wheels are generally suspended on [[magnetic bearing]]s to avoid bearing friction and breakdown problems.{{citation needed|reason=|date=September 2015}} To maintain orientation in three dimensional space a minimum of three must be used,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erps.spacegrant.org/uploads/images/images/iepc_articledownload_1988-2007/1997index/7128.pdf |title=Investigation of Pulsed Plasma Thrusters for Spacecraft Attitude Control |publisher=Erps.spacegrant.org |accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref> with additional units providing single failure protection. See [[Euler angles]].\n\n===Control moment gyros===\n{{main|Control moment gyroscope}}\nThese are rotors spun at constant speed, mounted on [[gimbal]]s to provide attitude control. Although a CMG provides control about the two axes orthogonal to the gyro spin axis, triaxial control still requires two units. A CMG is a bit more expensive in terms of cost and mass, because gimbals and their drive motors must be provided. The maximum torque (but not the maximum angular momentum change) exerted by a CMG is greater than for a momentum wheel, making it better suited to large spacecraft. A major drawback is the additional complexity, which increases the number of failure points. For this reason, the [[International Space Station]] uses a set of four CMGs to provide dual failure tolerance.\n\n===Solar sails===\n{{main|Solar sail}}\nSmall solar sails (devices that produce thrust as a reaction force induced by reflecting incident light) may be used to make small attitude control and velocity adjustments. This application can save large amounts of fuel on a long-duration mission by producing control moments without fuel expenditure. For example, [[Mariner 10]] adjusted its attitude using its solar cells and antennas as small solar sails.\n\n===Gravity-gradient stabilization===\n{{main|Gravity-gradient stabilization}}\nIn orbit, a spacecraft with one axis much longer than the other two will spontaneously orient so that its long axis points at the planet's center of mass. This system has the virtue of needing no active control system or expenditure of fuel. The effect is caused by a [[tidal force]]. The upper end of the vehicle feels less gravitational pull than the lower end. This provides a restoring torque whenever the long axis is not co-linear with the direction of gravity. Unless some means of damping is provided, the spacecraft will oscillate about the local vertical. Sometimes [[tether propulsion|tethers]] are used to connect two parts of a satellite, to increase the stabilizing torque. A problem with such tethers is that meteoroids as small as a grain of sand can part them.\n\n===Magnetic torquers===\n{{main|Magnetic torquers}}\n[[Electromagnetic coil|Coils]] or (on very small satellites) [[permanent magnets]] exert a moment against the local magnetic field. This method works only where there is a magnetic field against which to react. One classic field \"coil\" is actually in the form of a [[Electrodynamic tether|conductive tether]] in a planetary magnetic field. Such a conductive tether can also generate electrical power, at the expense of [[orbital decay]]. Conversely, by inducing a counter-current, using solar cell power, the orbit may be raised. Due to massive variability in Earth's magnetic field from an ideal radial field, control laws based on torques coupling to this field will be highly non-linear. Moreover, only two-axis control is available at any given time meaning that a vehicle reorient may be necessary to null all rates.\n\n===Pure passive attitude control===\nThere exist two main passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and it leads to four stable states with the long axis (axis with smallest moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet.<ref>[http://vincent.francois-l.be/OUFTI_ADCS_2010_05_31.pdf Attitude and Determination Control Systems for the OUFTI nanosatellites]. Vincent Francois-Lavet (2010-05-31)</ref> These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Spaceflight}}\n* [[Longitudinal static stability]]\n* [[Directional stability]]\n* [[Reaction control system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft attitude control| ]]\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Orbits]]\n[[Category:Spaceflight concepts]]"

      "text": "{{More citations needed|date=October 2008}}\nA '''control moment gyroscope''' (CMG) is an [[attitude control]] device generally used in [[spacecraft]] attitude control systems. A CMG consists of a spinning rotor and one or more motorized [[gimbal]]s that tilt the rotor’s [[angular momentum]]. As the rotor tilts, the changing angular momentum causes a [[gyroscopic]] torque that rotates the spacecraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100021932.pdf|title=Space Station Control Moment Gyroscope Lessons Learned|last=|first=|date=|website=NASA.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://aerospace.honeywell.com/en/products/space/control-moment-gyroscopes-cmg|title=Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMG)|website=aerospace.honeywell.com|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanics==\nCMGs differ from [[reaction wheel]]s. The latter apply [[torque]] simply by changing rotor spin speed, but the former tilt the rotor's spin axis without necessarily changing its spin speed. CMGs are also far more power efficient. For a few hundred watts and about 100&nbsp;kg of mass, large CMGs have produced thousands of [[newton meter]]s of torque. A reaction wheel of similar capability would require [[watt|megawatts]] of power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=smallsat|title=R Votel, D Sinclair. \"Comparison of control moment gyros and reaction wheels for small Earth-observing satellites.\" 26th Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites.}}</ref>\n\n==Design varieties==\n\n===Single-gimbal===\nThe most effective CMGs include only a single [[gimbal]]. When the gimbal of such a CMG rotates, the change in direction of the rotor's angular momentum represents a torque that reacts onto the body to which the CMG is mounted, e.g. a spacecraft. Except for effects due to the motion of the spacecraft, this torque is due to a constraint, so it does no mechanical work (i.e., requires no energy). Single-gimbal CMGs exchange angular momentum in a way that requires very little power, with the result that they can apply very large torques for minimal electrical input.\n\n===Dual-gimbal===\nSuch a CMG includes two gimbals per rotor. As an actuator, it is more versatile than a single-gimbal CMG because it is capable of pointing the rotor's momentum vector in any direction. However, the torque generated by one gimbal's motion must often be reacted by the other gimbal on its way to the spacecraft, requiring more power for a given torque than a single-gimbal CMG. If the goal is simply to store momentum in a mass-efficient way, as in the case of the [[International Space Station]], dual-gimbal CMGs are a good design choice. However, if a spacecraft instead requires large output torque while consuming minimal power, single-gimbal CMGs are a better choice.\n\n===Variable-speed===\nMost CMGs hold rotor speed constant using relatively small motors to offset changes due to dynamic coupling and non-conservative effects. Some academic research has focused on the possibility of increasing and decreasing rotor speed while the CMG gimbals. Variable-speed CMGs (VSCMGs) offer few practical advantages when considering actuation capability because the output torque from the rotor is typically much smaller than that caused by the gimbal motion. The primary practical benefit of the VSCMG when compared to the conventional CMG is an additional degree of freedom—afforded by the available rotor torque—which can be exploited for continuous CMG singularity avoidance and VSCMG cluster reorientation. Research has shown that the rotor torques required for these two purposes are very small and within the capability of conventional CMG rotor motors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schaub|first1=Hanspeter|last2=Junkins|first2=John L.|title=Singularity Avoidance Using Null Motion and Variable-Speed Control Moment Gyros|journal=Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics|date=January 2000|volume=23|issue=1|pages=11–16|doi=10.2514/2.4514|accessdate=|bibcode=2000JGCD...23...11S}}</ref> Thus, the practical benefits of VSCMGs are readily available using conventional CMGs with alterations to CMG cluster steering and CMG rotor motor control laws. The VSCMG also can be used as a [[flywheel energy storage|mechanical battery]] to store electric energy as [[kinetic energy]] of the flywheels.\n\n==Potential problems==\n\n===Singularities===\nAt least three single-axis CMGs are necessary for control of spacecraft attitude. However, no matter how many CMGs a spacecraft uses, gimbal motion can lead to relative orientations that produce no usable output torque along certain directions. These orientations are known as ''singularities'' and are related to the [[kinematics]] of robotic systems that encounter limits on the end-effector velocities due to certain joint alignments. Avoiding these singularities is naturally of great interest, and several techniques have been proposed. David Bailey and others have argued (in patents and in academic publications) that merely avoiding the \"divide by zero\" error that is associated with these singularities is sufficient.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=6154691.PN.&OS=PN/6154691&RS=PN/6154691 |title=Orienting a satellite with controlled momentum gyros - US Patent 6154691 |publisher=Patft.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last1= Heiberg\n|first1= Christopher J.\n|last2= Bailey\n|first2= David\n|last3= Wie\n|first3= Bong\n|title= Precision Spacecraft Pointing Using Single-Gimbal Control Moment Gyroscopes with Disturbance\n|journal= Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics\n|volume= 23\n|issue= 1\n|pages= 77&ndash;85\n|publisher= American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n|date= January 2000\n|url= http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/2.4489\n|issn= 0731-5090\n|doi= 10.2514/2.4489\n|access-date= 31 March 2016|bibcode= 2000JGCD...23...77H\n}}</ref> Two more recent patents summarize competing approaches.<ref>[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7,246,776 US Patent 7246776]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220070124032%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20070124032&RS=DN/20070124032 |title=US Patent Application 20070124032 |publisher=Appft1.uspto.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref> See also [[Gimbal lock]].\n\n===Saturation===\nA cluster of CMGs can become saturated, in the sense that it is holding a maximum amount of angular momentum in a particular direction and can hold no more.\n\nAs an example, suppose a spacecraft equipped with two or more dual-gimbal CMGs experiences a transient unwanted torque, perhaps caused by reaction from venting waste gas, tending to make it roll clockwise about its forward axis and thus increase its angular momentum along that axis. Then the CMG control program will command the gimbal motors of the CMGs to slant the rotors' spin axes gradually more and more forward, so that the angular momentum vectors of the rotors point more nearly along the forward axis. While this gradual change in rotor spin direction is in progress, the rotors will be creating gyroscopic torques whose resultant is anticlockwise about the forward axis, holding the spacecraft steady against the unwanted waste gas torque.\n\nWhen the transient torque ends, the control program will stop the gimbal movement, and the rotors will be left pointing more forward than before. The inflow of unwanted forward angular momentum has been routed through the CMGs and dumped into the rotors; the forward component of their total angular momentum vector is now greater than before.\n\nIf these events are repeated, the angular momentum vectors of the individual rotors will bunch more and more closely together round the forward direction. In the limiting case, they will all end up parallel, and the CMG cluster will now be saturated in that direction; it can hold no more angular momentum. If the CMGs were initially holding no angular momentum about any other axes, they will end up saturated exactly along the forward axis. If however (for example) they were already holding a little angular momentum in the \"up\" (yaw left) direction, they will saturate (end up parallel) along an axis pointing forward and slightly up, and so on. Saturation is possible about any axis.\n\nIn the saturated condition attitude control is impossible. Since the gyroscopic torques can now only be created at right angles to the saturation axis, roll control about that axis itself is now non-existent. There will also be major difficulties with control about other axes. For example, an unwanted left yaw can only be countered by storing some \"up\" angular momentum in the CMG rotors. This can only be done by tilting at least one of their axes up, which will slightly reduce the forward component of their total angular momentum. Since they can now store less \"right roll\" forward angular momentum, they will have to release some back into the spacecraft, which will be forced to start an unwanted roll to the right.{{efn|In fact control will already be difficult even when the cluster is not quite saturated. For example, roll control needs the gyroscopic torques to have a forward-facing component. Those gyroscopic torques are always at right angles to the rotor spin axes, so near saturation in our example the forward-facing components are quite small compared to the total gyroscopic torques. This means that the total gyroscopic torques will have to be quite large to give usable roll control, and this can only be achieved by making the gimbal motions faster. Eventually these will exceed the capabilities of the gimbal motors.}}\n\nThe only remedy for this loss of control is to desaturate the CMGs by removing the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use [[Reaction Control System]] (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin fanning out away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS as long as it is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the [[angular momentum#Discussion|moment of momentum]] of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.{{efn|It might be asked why the RCS thrusters were not used originally to directly oppose the torque created by the waste gas venting, thus bypassing the CMGs altogether and rendering them unnecessary. One answer is that RCS thrusters usually produce much more thrust than venting waste gas, or the other likely causes of unwanted torque; a few seconds of RCS firing can drain away angular momentum that has taken hours to accumulate in the CMGs. The RCS is used for \"coarse\" attitude control, with the CMGs providing \"fine\" adjustments. Another reason for temporarily storing angular momentum in the CMGs is that quite possibly one unwanted torque may be followed some time later by another unwanted torque in the opposite direction. In this case the angular momentum left stored after the first event is used to counter the second event, without expenditure of precious RCS fuel. Cyclic unwanted torques like this are often caused by orbital interactions with a gravity gradient.}}\n\nIt is worth noting that \"saturation\" can only apply to a cluster of two or more CMGs, since it means that their rotor spins have become parallel. It is meaningless to say that a single constant-speed CMG can become saturated; in a sense it is \"permanently saturated\" in whatever direction the rotor happens to be pointing. This contrasts with a single [[reaction wheel]], which can absorb more and more angular momentum along its fixed axis by spinning faster, until it reaches saturation at its maximum design speed.\n\n===Anti-parallel alignment===\nThere are other undesirable rotor axis configurations apart from saturation, notably anti-parallel alignments. For example, if a spacecraft with two dual-gimbal CMGs gets into a state in which one rotor spin axis is facing directly forward, while the other rotor spin is facing directly aft (i.e. anti-parallel to the first), then all roll control will be lost. This happens for the same reason as for saturation; the rotors can only produce gyroscopic torques at right angles to their spin axes, and here these torques will have no fore-and-aft components and so no influence on roll. However, in this case the CMGs are not saturated at all; their angular momenta are equal and opposite, so the total stored angular momentum adds up to zero. Just as for saturation, however, and for exactly the same reasons, roll control will become increasingly difficult if the CMGs even approach anti-parallel alignment.\n\nIn the anti-parallel configuration, although roll control is lost, control about other axes still works well (in contrast to the situation with saturation). An unwanted left yaw can be dealt with by storing some \"up\" angular momentum, which is easily done by tilting both rotor spin axes slightly up by equal amounts. Since their fore and aft components will still be equal and opposite, there is no change in fore-and-aft angular momentum (it will still be zero) and therefore no unwanted roll. In fact the situation will be improved, because the rotor axes are no longer quite anti-parallel and some roll control will be restored.\n\nAnti-parallel alignment is therefore not quite as serious as saturation but must still be avoided. It is theoretically possible with any number of CMGs; as long as some rotors are aligned parallel along a particular axis, and all the others point in exactly the opposite direction, there is no saturation but still no roll control about that axis. With three or more CMGs the situation can be immediately rectified simply by redistributing the existing total angular momentum among the rotors (even if that total is zero).{{efn|For example, suppose there are four CMGs and the starting configuration is two spins facing forward and two facing back. Then one of the forward-facing rotors can be swung smoothly to \"up\", while one rear-facing rotor is swung simultaneously to \"down\". The resulting gyroscopic torques will cancel each other out exactly while this motion is in progress, and the final \"+\" shaped configuration is no longer anti-parallel.}} In practice the CMG control program will continually redistribute the total angular momentum to avoid the situation arising in the first place.\n\nIf there are only two CMGs in the cluster, as in our first example, then anti-parallel alignment will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero. The remedy is to keep it away from zero, possibly by using RCS firings. This is not very satisfactory, and in practice all spacecraft using CMGs are fitted with at least three. However it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working CMGs, and the control program must be able to deal with this situation.\n\n===Hitting the gimbal stops===\nOlder CMG models like the ones launched with Skylab in 1973 had limited gimbal travel between fixed mechanical stops. On the Skylab CMGs the limits were plus or minus 80 degrees from zero for the inner gimbals, and from plus 220 degrees to minus 130 degrees for the outer ones (so zero was offset by 45 degrees from the centre of travel). Visualising the inner angle as 'latitude' and the outer as 'longitude', it can be seen that for an individual CMG there were 'blind spots' with radius 10 degrees of latitude at the 'North and South poles', and an additional 'blind strip' of width 10 degrees of 'longitude' running from pole to pole, centred on the line of 'longitude' at plus 135 degrees. These 'blind areas' represented directions in which the rotor's spin axis could never be pointed.<ref name= ChubbSeltz1971/>{{rp|11}}\n\nSkylab carried three CMGs, mounted with their casings (and therefore their rotor axes when the gimbals were set to zero) facing in three mutually perpendicular directions. This ensured that the six 'polar blind spots' were spaced 90 degrees apart from each other. The 45 degree zero offset then ensured that the three 'blind strips' of the outer gimbals would pass halfway between neighbouring 'polar blind spots' and at a maximum distance from each other. The whole arrangement ensured that the 'blind areas' of the three CMGs never overlapped, and thus that at least two of the three rotor spins could be pointed in any given direction.<ref name= ChubbSeltz1971/>{{rp|4}}\n\nThe CMG control program was responsible for making sure that the gimbals never hit the stops, by redistributing angular momentum between the three rotors to bring large gimbal angles closer to zero. Since the total angular momentum to be stored had only three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], while the control program could change six independent variables (the three pairs of gimbal angles), the program had sufficient freedom of action to do this while still obeying other constraints such as avoiding anti-parallel alignments.<ref name= ChubbSeltz1971/>{{rp|5}}\n\nOne advantage of limited gimbal movement such as Skylab's is that singularities are less of a problem. If Skylab's inner gimbals had been able to reach 90 degrees or more away from zero, then the 'North and South poles' could have become singularities; the gimbal stops prevented this.\n\nMore modern CMGs such as the four units [[Integrated Truss Structure#Z1 truss|installed on the ISS]] in 2000 have unlimited gimbal travel and therefore no 'blind areas'. Thus they do not have to be mounted facing along mutually perpendicular directions; the four units on the ISS all face the same way. The control program need not concern itself with gimbal stops, but on the other hand it must pay more attention to avoiding singularities.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Skylab===\n[[Skylab]], launched in May 1973, was the first spacecraft to be fitted with large CMGs for attitude control.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-400/ch3.htm\n|title= SP-400 Skylab, Our First Space Station; Chapter 3: \"We Can Fix Anything\"\n|last1= Belew\n|first1= Leland F.\n|author-link1=\n|year= 1977\n|website= history.nasa.gov\n|publisher= NASA History Office\n|access-date= 1 April 2016\n}}</ref> Three dual-gimbal CMGs were mounted on the equipment rack of the [[Apollo Telescope Mount]] at the hub of the windmill-shaped array of solar panels on the side of the station.

Since the units were dual-gimballed, each one could produce a torque about any axis at right angles to its rotor axis, thus providing some redundancy; if any one of the three failed, the combination of the remaining two could in general still produce a torque around any desired axis.<ref name= ChubbSeltz1971>{{cite web\n|url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19710007043.pdf\n|title= Skylab Attitude and Pointing Control System\n|last1= Chubb\n|first1= W.

The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative to the surface of the Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of [[gravity gradient]], [[atmospheric drag]], [[solar pressure]], and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, external control torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}<!-- The cite is from 1990. The first ISS module was launched in 1998.

The main advantage over using active stabilization with [[propellant]]s, [[gyroscope]]s or [[reaction wheel]]s is the low use of power and resources.\n\nThe idea is to use the [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]] and [[tidal forces]] to keep the spacecraft aligned in the desired orientation.  The [[gravity]] of the Earth decreases according to the [[inverse-square law]], and by extending the long axis perpendicular to the orbit, the \"lower\" part of the orbiting structure will be more attracted to the Earth.  The effect is that the satellite will tend to align its axis of minimum [[moment of inertia]] vertically.\n\nThe first experimental attempt to use the technique on a human spaceflight was performed on September 13, 1966, on the US [[Gemini 11]] mission, by attaching the Gemini spacecraft to its [[Agena target vehicle]] by a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} tether.

      "text": "A '''magnetorquer''' or '''magnetic torquer''' (also known as '''torque rod''') is a [[satellite]] system for [[attitude control]], detumbling, and stabilization built from [[electromagnetic coil]]s. The magnetorquer creates a magnetic dipole that interfaces with an ambient magnetic field, usually [[Earth's magnetic field|Earth's]], so that the counter-forces produced provide useful [[torque]].\n\n== Functional principle ==\n\nMagnetorquers are essentially sets of electromagnets which are laid out to yield a rotationally asymmetric ([[anisotropic]]) magnetic field over an extended area. That field is controlled by switching [[Electric current|current]] flow through the coils on or off, usually under computerized [[feedback]] [[control theory|control]]. The magnets themselves are mechanically anchored to the craft, so that any magnetic force they exert on the surrounding magnetic field will lead to a magnetic reverse force and result in mechanical torque about the vessel's [[center of gravity]]. This makes it possible to freely pivot the craft around in a known local [[gradient]] of the magnetic field by only using electrical energy.\nThe magnetic dipole generated by the ''magnetorquer'' is expressed by the formula:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{m}=  n I \\mathbf{A} \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the number of turns of the wire, ''I'' is the current provided, and '''A''' is the [[vector area]] of the coil. \nThe dipole interacts with the magnetic field generating a torque whose expression is:\n\n<math>\\mathbf{\\tau}= \\mathbf{m}\\times \\mathbf{B}\\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere '''m''' is the magnetic dipole vector, '''B''' the magnetic field vector (for a spacecraft it is the Earth magnetic field vector) and '''τ''' is the generated torque vector.\n\n== Construction ==\n\nThe construction of a ''magnetorquer'' is based on the realization of a coil with a defined area and number of turns according to the required performances. However, there are different ways to obtain the coil, thus according to the construction strategy it is possible to find three type of magnetorquer, apparently very different from each other but based on the same concept <ref>{{cite document\n |url             = http://amslaurea.unibo.it/7506/\n |format          = pdf\n |title           = Magnetic actuators for nanosatellite attitude control\n |author          = Niccolò Bellini\n |date            = 2014-09-10\n}}</ref>: \n*'''Air-core magnetorquer''': this comprises the basic concept of ''magnetorquer'', a conductive wire wrapped around a non-conductive support anchored to the satellite. This kind of ''magnetorquer'' can provide a consistent magnetic dipole with an acceptable mass and encumbrance. \n*'''Embedded coil''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is constructed creating a spiral trace inside the [[Printed circuit board|PCBs]] of solar panels which generates the effect of the coil. This solution is the one with the least impact on the satellite as it is entirely contained within the solar panels. However, due to the physical limit in the board thickness and the presence of other circuits and electronic components, it is not possible to reach a high value of the magnetic dipole.  \n*'''Torquerod''': this kind of ''magnetorquer'' is the most efficient solution. A conductive wire is wrapped around a ferromagnetic core which is magnetized when excited by the coil, thus generating a dipole considerably higher than the other solutions. However, the disadvantage is the presence of a residual magnetic dipole that remains even when the coil is turned off because of the [[Magnetic hysteresis|hysteresis]] in the magnetization curve of the core. It is therefore necessary to demagnetize the core with a proper demagnetizing procedure. Normally, the presence of the core (generally consisting of heavy metal) increases the mass of the system.\n\nTypically three coils are used, although reduced configurations of two or even one magnet can suffice where full attitude control is not needed or external forces like asymmetric [[Drag (physics)|drag]] allow [[Underactuation|underactuated control]]. The three coil assembly usually takes the form of three perpendicular coils, because this setup equalizes the rotational symmetry of the fields which can be generated; no matter how the external field and the craft are placed with respect to each other, approximately the same torque can always be generated simply by using different amounts of current on the three different coils.\n\nAs long as [[Electric current|current]] is passing through the coils and the spacecraft has not yet been stabilized in a fixed orientation with respect to the external field, the craft's spinning will continue.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nVery small satellites may use [[permanent magnet]]s instead of coils.\n\n== Advantages ==\n\nMagnetorquers are lightweight, reliable, and energy-efficient. Unlike [[Rocket engine|thrusters]], they do not require expendable [[propellant]] either, so they could in theory work indefinitely as long as sufficient [[Electric power|power]] is available to match the [[resistive]] load of the coils. In Earth orbit, sunlight is one such practically inexhaustible energy source, using [[solar panels]].\n\nA further advantage over [[momentum wheel]]s and [[control moment gyroscope]]s is the absence of [[moving parts]] and therefore significantly higher reliability.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\nThe main disadvantage of magnetorquers is that very high [[magnetic flux density|magnetic flux densities]] are needed if large craft have to be turned very fast. This either necessitates a very high [[amperage|current]] in the coils, or much higher ambient flux densities than are available in [[Earth orbit]]. Consequently, the torques provided are very limited and only serve to accelerate or decelerate the change in a spacecraft's attitude by minute amounts. Over time active control can produce very fast spinning even here, but for accurate attitude control and stabilization the torques provided often aren't enough.  To overcome this, magnetorquer are often combined with [[reaction wheels]].\n\nA broader disadvantage is the dependence on Earth's magnetic field strength, making this approach unsuitable for deep space missions, and also more suitable for [[low Earth orbit]]s as opposed to higher ones like the [[geosynchronous]]. The dependence on the highly variable intensity of Earth's magnetic field is also problematic because then the attitude control problem becomes highly [[nonlinear]].

It provided both automatic and manual [[rotation]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] by means of 16 [[vernier thruster]]s using [[hypergolic]] propellants.\n\n==Operations==\nThe OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust [[rocket engine]]s which burned [[hypergolic]] propellants ([[monomethylhydrazine]] fuel using [[nitrogen tetroxide]] as [[oxidizer]]) fed under pressure from a pair of tanks located in the aft Equipment Module. \nBesides providing [[attitude control]], the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft [[translation (physics)|translation]] of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with another spacecraft, the [[Agena Target Vehicle]].\nThe system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II launch vehicle]] on first reaching orbit.\n\n*The eight rotational control engines were mounted off the spacecraft's [[center of mass]] around the aft section of the Equipment Module, pointed at 90 degree positions up, down, left and right. These were rated at {{convert|25|lbf|N}} thrust and fired in pairs, causing it to [[yaw, pitch, or roll]] to control attitude.\n*Six of the translational control engines were mounted on the side of the Retrorocket Module, near the spacecraft's center of mass. Four of these were rated at {{convert|100|lbf|N}} thrust, one each pointed up, down, left or right. The other two were pointed forward, at the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions, to provide aft thrust. These were rated at {{convert|85|lbf|N}} (reduced from the original spec of {{convert|100|lbf|N}} in July 1962).\n*The two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrust forward translation control engines were mounted on the inside of the aft end of the equipment adapter, at the twelve o'clock and six o'clock positions.\n\n[[Project Mercury]] astronauts could only adjust yaw, pitch, or roll, but Gemini crewmen had full manual control over their flight path. [[Walter Schirra]] said that on [[Gemini 6]] \"I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of [[Gemini 7]], literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence\".

Two curves represent the specific energies for conventional rockets with I<sub>sp</sub> = 500 s and 3,000 s, respectively.  The upper straight solid line represents the specific energy for BLP and the lower straight solid line for photonic railway or PLT-BLP with M=1,000.  Here M is the photon thrust amplification factor.  It is interesting that BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I<sub>sp</sub>=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 1 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I<sub>sp</sub>=3,000 s, if the travel time is shorter than a week. However, photonic railway or PLT-BPL with M=1,000 becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I<sub>sp</sub>=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 2 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I<sub>sp</sub>=3,000 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than two weeks. Eventually, when the flight time needs to be 3 days, for example, both BLP and photonic railway or PLT-BLP are more energy efficient than rockets with I<sub>sp</sub>=3,000 s.  This estimate demonstrates photonic railway is potentially the most energy efficient way to commute to planets in the solar system.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the Spacetrain on the photonic railway was realized that the continuous low level acceleration of up to 1 g will create an artificial gravity that may eliminate or minimize the health effects of [[weightlessness]] long term space travel in zero-gravity environment.<ref name=\":2\" />  This artificial gravity will play a crucial role in reducing or eliminating the health problems arising from the typical zero-g space travel environment.\n\nA simple PLT system could provide continuous and constant thrust in a straight line.

Use of diverted engine thrust to provide stable attitude control of a [[V/STOL|short-or-vertical takeoff and landing aircraft]] below conventional winged flight speeds, such as with the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier#Controls and handling|Harrier \"jump jet\"]], may also be referred to as a reaction control system.\n\nAn RCS is capable of providing small amounts of [[thrust]] in any desired direction or combination of directions. An RCS is also capable of providing [[torque]] to allow control of [[rotation]] ([[aircraft principal axes|roll, pitch, and yaw]]).\n\nReaction control systems often use combinations of large and small ([[vernier thruster|vernier]]) thrusters, to allow different levels of response.

For stationkeeping, some spacecraft (particularly those in [[geosynchronous orbit]]) use high-[[specific impulse]] engines such as [[arcjet]]s, [[ion thruster]]s, or [[Hall effect thruster]]s. To control orientation, a few spacecraft, including the [[International Space Station|ISS]], use [[momentum wheel]]s which spin to control rotational rates on the vehicle.\n\n==Location of thrusters on spacecraft==\n[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|left|Gemini OAMS and Re-entry Control System]]\nThe [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] [[space capsule]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] re-entry module both used groupings of nozzles to provide [[attitude control]]. The thrusters were located off their [[center of gravity]], thus providing a [[torque]] to rotate the capsule. The Gemini capsule was also capable of adjusting its re-entry course by rolling, which directed its off-center lifting force. The Mercury thrusters used a [[hydrogen peroxide]] monopropellant which turned to steam when forced through a [[tungsten]] screen, and the Gemini thrusters used [[hypergolic]] [[mono-methyl hydrazine]] fuel oxidized with [[nitrogen tetroxide]].\n\nThe Gemini spacecraft was also equipped with a hypergolic [[Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System]], which made it the first manned spacecraft with [[translation (physics)|translation]] as well as rotation capability. In-orbit attitude control was achieved by firing pairs of eight {{convert|25|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located around the circumference of its adapter module at the extreme aft end. Lateral translation control was provided by four {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters around the circumference at the forward end of the adaptor module (close to the spacecraft's center of mass). Two forward-pointing {{convert|85|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters at the same location, provided aft translation, and two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrusters located in the aft end of the adapter module provided forward thrust, which could be used to change the craft's orbit.\n\nThe [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Apollo Command Module]] had a set of twelve hypergolic thrusters for attitude control, and directional re-entry control similar to Gemini.\n\nThe Apollo [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] each had a set of sixteen [[R-4D]] hypergolic thrusters, grouped into external clusters of four, to provide both translation and attitude control.

Shuttle thrusters were grouped in the nose of the vehicle and on each of the two aft [[Orbital Maneuvering System]] pods. No nozzles interrupted the heat shield on the underside of the craft; instead, the nose RCS nozzles which control positive pitch were mounted on the side of the vehicle, and were canted downward.

Doing so alters the spacecraft's rotational dynamics so that disturbance torques perpendicular to one axis of the satellite (the axis parallel to the wheel's spin axis) do not result directly in spacecraft angular motion about the same axis as the disturbance torque; instead, they result in (generally smaller) angular motion ([[precession]]) of that spacecraft axis about a perpendicular axis. This has the effect of tending to stabilize that spacecraft axis to point in a nearly-fixed direction,<ref name=smad/>{{rp|362}} allowing for a less-complicated attitude control system. Satellites using this \"momentum-bias\" stabilization approach include [[SCISAT-1]]; by orienting the momentum wheel's axis to be parallel to the orbit-normal vector, this satellite is in a \"pitch momentum bias\" configuration.\n\nA [[control moment gyroscope]] (CMG) is a related but different type of attitude actuator, generally consisting of a momentum wheel mounted in a one-axis or two-axis [[gimbal]].<ref name=smad/>{{rp|362}} When mounted to a rigid spacecraft, applying a constant torque to the wheel using one of the gimbal motors causes the spacecraft to develop a constant angular velocity about a perpendicular axis, thus allowing control of the spacecraft's pointing direction. CMGs are generally able to produce larger sustained torques than RWs with less motor heating, and are preferentially used in larger and/or more-agile spacecraft, including [[Skylab]], [[Mir]], and the [[International Space Station]].\n\n==Theory==\nReaction wheels are used to control the attitude of a satellite without the use of thrusters, which reduces the [[payload fraction|mass fraction]] needed for fuel. \n\nThey work by equipping the spacecraft with an electric motor attached to a flywheel which, when its rotation speed is changed, causes the spacecraft to begin to counter-rotate proportionately through [[Angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conservation of angular momentum]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=NASA |url=https://spinoff.nasa.gov/spinoff1997/t3.html |title=Reaction/Momentum Wheel |accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> Reaction wheels can rotate a spacecraft only around its center of mass (see [[torque]]); they are not capable of moving the spacecraft from one place to another (see [[translation (physics)|translational force]]).\n\n== Implementation ==\nFor three axis control, reaction wheels must be mounted along at least three directions, with extra wheels providing additional redundancy to the attitude control system. A redundant mounting configuration could consist of four wheels along tetrahedral axes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kleinsatelliten.de/flying_laptop/systeme/lageregelung.en.html|title=Attitude Control|publisher=Universität Stuttgart Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme|accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref> or a spare wheel carried in addition to a three axis configuration.<ref name=smad/>{{rp|369}} Changes in speed (in either direction) are controlled electronically by computer. The strength of the materials used in a reaction wheel determine the speed at which the wheel would come apart, and therefore how much [[angular momentum]] it can store.\n\nSince the reaction wheel is a small fraction of the spacecraft's total mass, easily controlled, temporary changes in its speed result in small changes in angle. The wheels therefore permit very precise changes in a spacecraft's [[attitude control|attitude]]. For this reason, reaction wheels are often used to aim spacecraft carrying cameras or telescopes.\n\nOver time, reaction wheels may build up enough stored momentum to exceed the maximum speed of the wheel, called saturation, which will need to be cancelled. Designers therefore supplement reaction wheel systems with other attitude control mechanisms. In the presence of a magnetic field (as in low Earth orbit), a spacecraft can employ [[magnetorquer]]s (better known as torque rods) to transfer angular momentum to the Earth through its planetary magnetic field.<ref name=smad/>{{rp|368}} In the absence of a magnetic field, the most efficient practice is to use either high-efficiency attitude jets such as [[ion thruster]]s, or small, lightweight [[solar sail]]s placed in locations away from the spacecraft's center of mass, such as on solar cell arrays or projecting masts.\n\n== Spacecraft using Reaction wheel ==\n=== [[SpaceIL#Beresheet_lander|Beresheet ]]===\nBeresheet was launched on a [[Falcon 9]] rocket on 22 February 2019 1:45 UTC <ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israels-moon-mission-launched-successfully-1001274334|title=israels-moon-mission-launched-successfully|df=}}</ref>, with the goal of landing on the [[moon]].

      "text": "{{for|a somewhat similar system that uses fibre optic cables|fibre optic gyroscope}}\n[[File:Ring laser gyroscope at MAKS-2011 airshow.jpg|thumb|Ring laser gyroscope]]\n\nA '''ring laser gyroscope''' ('''RLG''') consists of a [[ring laser]] having two independent counter-propagating resonant modes over the same path; the difference in the frequencies is used to detect rotation. It operates on the principle of the [[Sagnac effect]] which shifts the nulls of the internal standing wave pattern in response to angular rotation. [[Interference (wave propagation)|Interference]] between the counter-propagating beams, observed externally, results in motion of the standing wave pattern, and thus indicates rotation.\n\n==Description==\nThe first experimental ring laser gyroscope was demonstrated in the US by Macek and Davis in 1963.<ref>Warren M. Macek and D. T. M. Davis, Jr. (1963) \"Rotation rate sensing with traveling-wave ring lasers,\" ''Applied Physics Letters'', vol. 2, pages 67–68.</ref>  Various organizations worldwide subsequently developed ring-laser technology further. Many tens of thousands of RLGs are operating in [[inertial navigation system]]s and have established high accuracy, with better than 0.01°/hour bias uncertainty, and [[mean time between failures]] in excess of 60,000 hours.\n\n[[Image:ring laser interferometer.png|frame|right|Schematic representation of a ring laser setup. At the beam sampling location, a fraction of each of the counterpropagating beams exits the laser cavity.]]\n\nRing laser gyroscopes can be used as the stable elements (for one degree of freedom each) in an [[inertial reference system]]. The advantage of using an RLG is that there are no moving parts (apart from the dither motor assembly, see further description below and laser-lock), compared to the conventional spinning [[gyroscope]]. This means there is no friction, which in turn means there will be no inherent drift terms. Additionally, the entire unit is compact, lightweight and highly durable, making it suitable for use in aircraft and also satellites. Unlike a mechanical gyroscope, the device does not resist changes to its orientation.\n\nContemporary applications of the Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG) include an embedded GPS capability to further enhance accuracy of RLG Inertial Navigation Systems (INS)s on military aircraft, commercial airliners, ships and spacecraft. These hybrid INS/GPS units have replaced their mechanical counterparts in most applications. Where ultra accuracy is needed however, spin gyro based INSs are still in use today.<ref>Peter M. Taylor – INS Test Engineer Honeywell, Inc.</ref>\n\n==Principle of operation==\nA certain rate of rotation induces a small difference between the time it takes light to traverse the ring in the two directions according to the [[Sagnac effect]]. This introduces a tiny separation between the frequencies of the counter-propagating beams, a motion of the [[standing wave]] pattern within the ring, and thus a beat pattern when those two beams are interfered outside the ring. Therefore, the net shift of that interference pattern follows the rotation of the unit in the plane of the ring.\n\nRLGs, while more accurate than mechanical gyroscopes, suffer from an effect known as \"lock-in\" at very slow rotation rates. When the ring laser is hardly rotating, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser modes become almost identical. In this case, crosstalk between the counter-propagating beams can allow for [[injection locking]] so that the standing wave \"gets stuck\" in a preferred phase, thus locking the frequency of each beam to each other rather than responding to gradual rotation.\n\nForced [[dithering]] can largely overcome this problem. The ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anti-clockwise about its axis using a mechanical spring driven at its resonance frequency. This ensures that the angular velocity of the system is usually far from the lock-in threshold.  Typical rates are 400&nbsp;Hz, with a peak dither velocity of 1 arc-second per second{{dubious|date=July 2013}}. <!--What is a typical lock-in rate? Much higher than that would possibly solve!!--> Dither does not fix the lock-in problem completely, as each time the direction of rotation is reversed, a short time interval exists in which the rotation rate is near zero and lock-in can briefly occur. If a pure frequency oscillation is maintained, these small lock-in intervals can accumulate. This was remedied by introducing noise to the 400&nbsp;Hz vibration.<ref name=\"MacKenzie\">''Knowing Machines'', Donald MacKenzie, The MIT Press, (1991).</ref>\n\n==Fibre optic gyroscope==\nA related device is the [[fibre optic gyroscope]] which also operates on the basis of the Sagnac effect, but in which the ring is not a part of the laser. Rather, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an [[optical fiber]] ring, where rotation causes a relative phase shift between those beams when interfered after their pass through the fiber ring. The phase shift is proportional to the rate of rotation. This is less sensitive in a single traverse of the ring than the RLG in which the externally observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation itself, not its derivative. However the sensitivity of the fiber optic gyro is enhanced several times over the RLG by having a long optical fiber, coiled  for compactness, in which the Sagnac effect is multiplied according to the number of turns.\n\n==Example applications==\n*[[Airbus A320]]<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/farn/farn_02/farn_02d2_honeywellpg48.html\n | title=Honeywell's ADIRU selected by Airbus\n | date=22–28 July 2002\n | location=Farnborough\n | accessdate=2008-07-16\n | publisher=[[Aviation International News]] via [[archive.org]]\n | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061017052942/http://www.ainonline.com/Publications/farn/farn_02/farn_02d2_honeywellpg48.html\n | archivedate = 2006-10-17\n }}</ref>\n*[[Agni III]]<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Agni-III missile ready for induction\n | url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Agni-III_missile_ready_for_induction/articleshow/3018810.cms\n | publisher = [[Press Trust of India]]\n | date = 2008-05-07\n | accessdate = 2008-05-08\n }}</ref> and [[Agni-IV]]<ref>{{cite news\n | title = India successfully test fires Agni-IV missile\n | url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-01-20/news/46374897_1_wheeler-island-missile-ring-laser-gyros\n | publisher=Ecconomic Times India via Press Trust of India\n | date= 2014-01-20\n | accessdate= 2015-10-14\n }}</ref>\n*[[Agni-V]]<ref>{{cite news\n | title = Agni-V missile to take India into elite nuclear club\n | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17738633\n | publisher=[[BBC News]]| date= 2012-04-19\n | accessdate= 2015-10-14\n }}</ref>\n*[[ASM-135]] US Anti-satellite missile\n*[[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-200]]\n*[[Boeing 777]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP9VAAAAMAAJ|title=Digital Avionics Systems|publisher=[[IEEE]], [[AIAA]]|year=1995|accessdate=2008-10-16|isbn=0-7803-3050-1}}</ref>\n* [[B-52H]] with the AMI upgrade<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/n19991119_992119.htm\n | title=B-52 Maps Its Way Into New Century\n | date=19 Nov 1999\n | accessdate=2009-02-24\n | publisher=[[fas.org]]\n }}</ref>\n*[[EF-111 Raven]]\n*[[F-15 Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]]\n*[[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]\n*[[HAL Tejas]]\n*[[MC-130E Combat Talon I]] and [[MC-130H Combat Talon II]]\n*[[MQ-1C Warrior]]\n*MK39 Ship's Internal Navigation System used in NATO surface ships and submarines<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/mk39/assets/mk39.pdf\n |title       = MK 39 MOD 3A Ring Laser\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090205074409/http://www.es.northropgrumman.com/solutions/mk39/assets/mk39.pdf\n |archivedate = 2009-02-05\n |df          = \n}}</ref>\n*[[P-3C Orion|P3 Orion]] (with upgrade)\n*[[Shaurya (missile)|Shaurya]] missile.<ref>[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/stories/20090102252609400.htm Missile success – Frontline Magazine]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n*[[SH-60 Seahawk#MH-60S Knight Hawk (Sierra)|MH-60R]], [[SH-60 Seahawk#MH-60R Seahawk|MH-60S]], [[SH-60 Seahawk#SH-60F Oceanhawk (Foxtrot)|SH60F]] and [[SH-60 Seahawk#SH-60B Seahawk|SH60B]] Seahawk helicopters\n*[[Sukhoi Su-30MKI]]\n*[[Trident I]] and [[Trident II]] Missiles\n*[[PARALIGN]], used for roller alignment\n*[[International Space Station]]\n*[[CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder|JF-17 Thunder]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pac.org.pk/jf-17|title=Pakistan Aeronautical Complex Kamra – JF-17 Thunder Aircraft|website=www.pac.org.pk|access-date=2017-02-26}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{commons category|Ring laser gyroscopes}}\n* [[Accelerometer]]\n* [[Active laser medium]]\n* [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope]]\n* [[Laser construction]]\n* [[Laser science]]\n* [[List of laser applications]]\n* [[List of laser types]]\n* [[Optical ring resonators]]\n* [[Fibre optic gyroscope]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.phys.canterbury.ac.nz/ringlaser/about_us.shtml Canterbury Ring Laser Research Group]\n*[http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/fun/rlg.htm Weapons and Systems Engineering Department, United States Naval Academy]\n* {{cite journal\n  |author=A.D.

In a letter to Galileo in 1610, he wrote, \"Provide ships or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will brave even that void.\" He might have had the comet tail phenomenon in mind when he wrote those words, although his publications on comet tails came several years later.<ref>Johannes Kepler (1604) ''Ad vitellionem parali pomena'', Frankfort; (1619) ''De cometis liballi tres '', Augsburg</ref>\n\n[[James Clerk Maxwell]], in 1861–1864, published his theory of [[electromagnetic field]]s and radiation, which shows that light has [[momentum]] and thus can exert pressure on objects. [[Maxwell's equations]] provide the theoretical foundation for sailing with light pressure. So by 1864, the physics community and beyond knew [[sunlight]] carried momentum that would exert a pressure on objects.\n\n[[Jules Verne]], in ''From the Earth to the Moon'',<ref name=\"Verne1865\">Jules Verne (1865) ''De la Terre à la Lune'' (''From the Earth to the Moon'')</ref> published in 1865, wrote \"there will some day appear velocities far greater than these [of the planets and the projectile], of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent ... we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars.\"<ref name=\"Impey\">Chris Impey, ''Beyond: Our Future in Space,'' W.

An actual square sail can be modeled as:\n\n:F = F<sub>0</sub> (0.349 + 0.662 cos 2θ − 0.011 cos 4θ) / R<sup>2</sup>\n\nNote that the force and acceleration approach zero generally around θ = 60° rather than 90° as one might expect with an ideal sail.<ref>Wright, Appendix B.</ref>\n\nIf some of the energy is absorbed, the absorbed energy will heat the sail, which re-radiates that energy from the front and rear surfaces, depending on the [[emissivity]] of those two surfaces.\n\n[[Solar wind]], the flux of charged particles blown out from the Sun, exerts a nominal dynamic pressure of about 3 to 4 [[Pascal (unit)|nPa]], three orders of magnitude less than solar radiation pressure on a reflective sail.<ref>[http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127142813/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html |date=November 27, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Sail parameters===\nSail loading (areal density) is an important parameter, which is the total mass divided by the sail area, expressed in g/m<sup>2</sup>. It is represented by the Greek letter σ.\n\nA sail craft has a characteristic acceleration, a<sub>c</sub>, which it would experience at 1&nbsp;AU when facing the Sun. Note this value accounts for both the incident and reflected momentums. Using the value from above of 9.08 μN per square metre of radiation pressure at 1 AU, a<sub>c</sub> is related to areal density by:\n\n:a<sub>c</sub> = 9.08(efficiency) / σ mm/s<sup>2</sup>\n\nAssuming 90% efficiency, a<sub>c</sub> =  8.17 / σ mm/s<sup>2</sup>\n\nThe lightness number, λ, is the dimensionless ratio of maximum vehicle acceleration divided by the Sun's local gravity.  Using the values at 1&nbsp;AU:\n\n:λ = a<sub>c</sub> / 5.93\n\nThe lightness number is also independent of distance from the Sun because both gravity and light pressure fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun. Therefore, this number defines the types of orbit maneuvers that are possible for a given vessel.\n\nThe table presents some example values. Payloads are not included. The first two are from the detailed design effort at JPL in the 1970s. The third, the lattice sailer, might represent about the best possible performance level.<ref name=\"Wright \" />  The dimensions for square and lattice sails are edges.  The dimension for heliogyro is blade tip to blade tip.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Type\n!σ (g/m<sup>2</sup>)\n!a<sub>c</sub> (mm/s<sup>2</sup>)\n!λ\n!Size (km<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n|Square sail\n|5.27\n|1.56\n|0.26\n|0.820\n|-\n|Heliogyro\n|6.39\n|1.29\n|0.22\n|15\n|-\n|Lattice&nbsp;sailer\n|0.07\n|117\n|20\n|0.840\n|}\n\n===Attitude control===\nAn active [[attitude control]] system (ACS) is essential for a sail craft to achieve and maintain a desired orientation. The required sail orientation changes slowly (often less than 1 degree per day) in interplanetary space, but much more rapidly in a planetary orbit. The ACS must be capable of meeting these orientation requirements. Attitude control is achieved by a relative shift between the craft's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] and its [[center of mass]]. This can be achieved with control vanes, movement of individual sails, movement of a control mass, or altering reflectivity.\n\nHolding a constant attitude requires that the ACS maintain a net torque of zero on the craft. The total force and torque on a sail, or set of sails, is not constant along a trajectory. The force changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes the billow in the sail and deflects some elements of the supporting structure, resulting in changes in the sail force and torque.\n\nSail temperature also changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes sail dimensions. The radiant heat from the sail changes the temperature of the supporting structure. Both factors affect total force and torque.\n\nTo hold the desired attitude the ACS must compensate for all of these changes.<ref name=\"wright 6+B\">Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix B.</ref>\n\n===Constraints===\nIn Earth orbit, solar pressure and drag pressure are typically equal at an altitude of about 800&nbsp;km, which means that a sail craft would have to operate above that altitude. Sail craft must operate in orbits where their turn rates are compatible with the orbits, which is generally a concern only for spinning disk configurations.\n\nSail operating temperatures are a function of solar distance, sail angle, reflectivity, and front and back emissivities. A sail can be used only where its temperature is kept within its material limits. Generally, a sail can be used rather close to the Sun, around 0.25&nbsp;AU, or even closer if carefully designed for those conditions.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n==Applications==\nPotential applications for sail craft range throughout the [[Solar System]], from near the Sun to the comet clouds beyond Neptune.  The craft can make outbound voyages to deliver loads or to take up station keeping at the destination.  They can be used to haul cargo and possibly also used for human travel.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n===Inner planets===\nFor trips within the inner Solar System, they can deliver loads and then return to Earth for subsequent voyages, operating as an interplanetary shuttle.  For Mars in particular, the craft could provide economical means of routinely supplying operations on the planet according to Jerome Wright, \"The cost of launching the necessary conventional propellants from Earth are enormous for manned missions. Use of sailing ships could potentially save more than $10 billion in mission costs.\"<ref name=\"Wright \"/>\n\nSolar sail craft can approach the Sun to deliver observation payloads or to take up station keeping orbits.  They can operate at 0.25 AU or closer.  They can reach high orbital inclinations, including polar.\n\nSolar sails can travel to and from all of the inner planets.  Trips to Mercury and Venus are for rendezvous and orbit entry for the payload.  Trips to Mars could be either for rendezvous or swing-by with release of the payload for [[Aerobraking|aerodynamic braking]].<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Sail size<br/>m!!colspan=2|Mercury Rendezvous!!colspan=2|Venus Rendezvous!!colspan=2|Mars Rendezvous!!colspan=2|Mars Aerobrake\n|-\n!days!!tons!!days!!tons!!days!!tons!!days!!tons\n|-\n|rowspan=3|800<br/>σ = 5 g/m²<br/>w/o cargo\n|600||9||200||1||400||2||131||2\n|-\n|900||19||270||5||500||5||200||5\n|-\n|1200||28|| || ||700||9||338||10\n|-\n|rowspan=3|2000<br/>σ = 3 g/m²<br/>w/o cargo\n|600||66||200||17||400||23||131||20\n|-\n|900||124||270||36||500||40||200||40\n|-\n|1200||184|| || ||700||66||338||70\n|}\n\n===Outer planets===\nMinimum transfer times to the outer planets benefit from using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  However, this method results in high arrival speeds.  Slower transfers have lower arrival speeds.\n\nThe minimum transfer time to Jupiter for ''a<sub>c</sub>'' of 1&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup> with no departure velocity relative to Earth is 2 years when using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  The arrival speed (''V''<span style=\"font-size:140%;\"><sub>∞</sub></span>) is close to 17&nbsp;km/s.  For Saturn, the minimum trip time is 3.3 years, with an arrival speed of nearly 19&nbsp;km/s.<ref name=\"Wright \" />\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 300px; height: 120px;\"\n|+ Minimum times to the outer planets (''a<sub>c</sub>'' = 1&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup>)\n|-\n!&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturn&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Uranus&nbsp;&nbsp;\n!&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptune&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-\n|Time, yr\n|2.0\n|3.3\n|5.8\n|8.5\n|-\n|Speed, km/s\n|17\n|19\n|20\n|20\n|}\n\n=== Oort Cloud/Sun's inner gravity focus ===\n\nThe Sun's inner [[Solar lens|gravitational focus]] point lies at minimum distance of 550 AU from the Sun, and is the point to which light from distant objects is [[Two-body problem in general relativity#Bending of light by gravity|focused by gravity]] as a result of it passing by the Sun. This is thus the distant point to which solar gravity will cause the region of deep space on the other side of the Sun to be focused, thus serving effectively as a very large telescope objective lens.<ref>Eshleman, Von R., \"Gravitational lens of the Sun: its potential for observations and communications over interstellar distances,\" ''Science, Vol. 205'', No. 4411 (1979) pp. 1133-1135. {{DOI|10.1126/science.205.4411.1133}}</ref><ref name=lens>{{cite web|last1=Maccone |first1=Claudio |title=The Sun as a Gravitational Lens : A Target for Space Missions A Target for Space Missions Reaching 550 AU to 1000 AU |url=http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715033119/http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIt has been proposed that an inflated sail, made of [[beryllium]], that starts at 0.05 AU from the Sun would gain an initial acceleration of 36.4&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup>, and reach a speed of 0.00264c (about 950&nbsp;km/s) in less than a day. Such proximity to the Sun could prove to be impractical in the near term due to the structural degradation of beryllium at high temperatures, diffusion of hydrogen at high temperatures as well as an electrostatic gradient, generated by the ionization of beryllium from the solar wind, posing a burst risk. A revised perihelion of 0.1 AU would reduce the aforementioned temperature and solar flux exposure.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Gilster |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=4238 |title=An Inflatable Sail to the Oort Cloud |publisher=Centauri-dreams.org |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2015-02-02}}</ref>\nSuch a sail would take \"Two and a half years to reach the heliopause, six and a half years to reach the Sun’s inner gravitational focus, with arrival at the inner Oort Cloud in no more than thirty years.\"<ref name=lens/> \"Such a mission could perform useful astrophysical observations en route, explore gravitational focusing techniques, and image Oort Cloud objects while exploring particles and fields in that region that are of galactic rather than solar origin.\"\n\n===Satellites===\n[[Robert L. Forward]] has commented that a solar sail could be used to modify the orbit of a satellite about the Earth. In the limit, a sail could be used to \"hover\" a satellite above one pole of the Earth. Spacecraft fitted with solar sails could also be placed in close orbits such that they are stationary with respect to either the Sun or the Earth, a type of satellite named by Forward a \"[[statite]]\". This is possible because the propulsion provided by the sail offsets the gravitational attraction of the Sun. Such an orbit could be useful for studying the properties of the Sun for long durations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Likewise a solar sail-equipped spacecraft could also remain on station nearly above the polar [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]] of a planet such as the Earth by tilting the sail at the appropriate angle needed to counteract the planet's gravity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Case for Mars]]'', [[Robert Zubrin]] points out that the reflected sunlight from a large statite, placed near the polar terminator of the planet Mars, could be focused on one of the Martian polar ice caps to significantly warm the planet's atmosphere. Such a statite could be made from asteroid material.\n\n===Trajectory corrections===\nThe [[MESSENGER]] probe orbiting [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] used light pressure on its solar panels to perform fine trajectory corrections on the way to Mercury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514095117/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title=MESSENGER Sails on Sun's Fire for Second Flyby of Mercury |date=2008-09-05 |quote=On September 4, the MESSENGER team announced that it would not need to implement a scheduled maneuver to adjust the probe's trajectory. This is the fourth time this year that such a maneuver has been called off. The reason? A recently implemented navigational technique that makes use of solar-radiation pressure (SRP) to guide the probe has been extremely successful at maintaining MESSENGER on a trajectory that will carry it over the cratered surface of Mercury for a second time on October 6.}}</ref> By changing the angle of the solar panels relative to the Sun, the amount of solar radiation pressure was varied to adjust the spacecraft trajectory more delicately than possible with thrusters. Minor errors are greatly amplified by [[gravity assist]] maneuvers, so using radiation pressure to make very small corrections saved large amounts of propellant.\n\n===Interstellar flight===\nIn the 1970s, [[Robert Forward]] proposed two [[beam-powered propulsion]] schemes using either lasers or [[maser]]s to push giant sails to a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]].<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\">{{Cite journal| author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187–195 | year=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}</ref>\n\nIn the science fiction novel ''[[Rocheworld]]'', Forward described a light sail propelled by super lasers. As the starship neared its destination, the outer portion of the sail would detach. The outer sail would then refocus and reflect the lasers back onto a smaller, inner sail. This would provide braking thrust to stop the ship in the destination star system.\n\nBoth methods pose monumental engineering challenges. The lasers would have to operate for years continuously at [[gigawatt]] strength. Forward's solution to this requires enormous solar panel arrays to be built at or near the planet Mercury. A planet-sized mirror or [[fresnel lens]] would need to be located at several dozen [[astronomical unit]]s from the Sun to keep the lasers focused on the sail. The giant braking sail would have to act as a precision mirror to focus the braking beam onto the inner \"deceleration\" sail.\n\nA potentially easier approach would be to use a maser to drive a \"solar sail\" composed of a mesh of wires with the same spacing as the wavelength of the microwaves directed at the sail, since the manipulation of microwave radiation is somewhat easier than the manipulation of visible light. The hypothetical \"[[Starwisp]]\" interstellar probe design<ref name=starwisp>Forward, Robert L., \"Starwisp: An Ultralight Interstellar Probe,” ''J.

Masers spread out more rapidly than optical lasers owing to their longer wavelength, and so would not have as great an effective range.\n\nMasers could also be used to power a painted solar sail, a conventional sail coated with a layer of chemicals designed to evaporate when struck by microwave radiation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_sail_050211.html |title=Earth To Mars in a Month With Painted Solar Sail |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> The momentum generated by this [[evaporation]] could significantly increase the [[thrust]] generated by solar sails, as a form of lightweight [[ablative laser propulsion]].\n\nTo further focus the energy on a distant solar sail, Forward proposed a lens designed as a large [[zone plate]]. This would be placed at a location between the laser or maser and the spacecraft.<ref name=\"Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar\" />\n\nAnother more physically realistic approach would be to use the light from the Sun to accelerate.<ref>\"Solar Sail Starships:Clipper Ships of the Galaxy,\" chapter 6, [[Eugene F. Mallove]] and [[Gregory L. Matloff]], ''The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer's Guide to Interstellar Travel'', pp. 89-106, John Wiley & Sons, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0471619123}}</ref> The ship would first drop into an orbit making a close pass to the Sun, to maximize the solar energy input on the sail, then it would begin to accelerate away from the system using the light from the Sun. Acceleration will drop approximately as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun, and beyond some distance, the ship would no longer receive enough light to accelerate it significantly, but would maintain the final velocity attained. When nearing the target star, the ship could turn its sails toward it and begin to use the outward pressure of the destination star to decelerate. Rockets could augment the solar thrust.\n\nSimilar solar sailing launch and capture were suggested for [[directed panspermia]] to expand life in other solar system. Velocities of 0.05% the speed of light could be obtained by solar sails carrying 10&nbsp;kg payloads, using thin solar sail vehicles with effective areal densities of 0.1&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup> with thin sails of 0.1&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] thickness and sizes on the order of one square kilometer.

As of 2015, it was still under thrust, proving the practicality of a solar sail for long-duration missions.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2012/03/20120321_sac_ikaros.pdf | title=Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator machine (小型ソーラー電力セイル実証機) | publisher=JAXA | accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>  It is spin-deployed, with tip-masses in the corners of its square sail.  The sail is made of thin [[polyimide]] film, coated with evaporated aluminium.  It steers with electrically-controlled [[liquid crystal]] panels.  The sail slowly spins, and these panels turn on and off to control the attitude of the vehicle.  When on, they diffuse light, reducing the momentum transfer to that part of the sail.  When off, the sail reflects more light, transferring more momentum.  In that way, they turn the sail.<ref>{{cite web|last=JAXA|title=Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator 'IKAROS'  Successful Attitude Control by Liquid Crystal Device|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100723_ikaros_e.html|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref>  Thin-film [[solar cell]]s are also integrated into the sail, powering the spacecraft.  The design is very reliable, because spin deployment, which is preferable for large sails, simplified the mechanisms to unfold the sail and the LCD panels have no moving parts.\n\nParachutes have very low mass, but a parachute is not a workable configuration for a solar sail. Analysis shows that a parachute configuration would collapse from the forces exerted by shroud lines, since radiation pressure does not behave like aerodynamic pressure, and would not act to keep the parachute open.<ref>Wright, ibid., p. 71, last paragraph</ref>\n\nThe highest thrust-to-mass designs for ground-assembled deploy-able structures are square sails with the masts and [[guy (sailing)|guy]] lines on the dark side of the sail. Usually there are four masts that spread the corners of the sail, and a mast in the center to hold [[guy-wire]]s. One of the largest advantages is that there are no hot spots in the rigging from wrinkling or bagging, and the sail protects the structure from the Sun. This form can, therefore, go close to the Sun for maximum thrust. Most designs steer with small moving sails on the ends of the spars.<ref name=jpl>{{cite web|url=http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |title=Design & Construction|publisher=NASA JPL |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050311004606/http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |archivedate = 2005-03-11}}</ref>\n\n[[File:sail-design-types.gif|center]]\n\nIn the 1970s [[JPL]] studied many rotating blade and ring sails for a mission to rendezvous with [[Halley's Comet]]. The intention was to stiffen the structures using angular momentum, eliminating the need for struts, and saving mass. In all cases, surprisingly large amounts of tensile strength were needed to cope with dynamic loads. Weaker sails would ripple or oscillate when the sail's attitude changed, and the oscillations would add and cause structural failure. The difference in the thrust-to-mass ratio between practical designs was almost nil, and the static designs were easier to control.<ref name=jpl />\n\nJPL's reference design was called the \"heliogyro\". It had plastic-film blades deployed from rollers and held out by centrifugal forces as it rotated. The spacecraft's attitude and direction were to be completely controlled by changing the angle of the blades in various ways, similar to the cyclic and collective pitch of a [[helicopter]]. Although the design had no mass advantage over a square sail, it remained attractive because the method of deploying the sail was simpler than a strut-based design.<ref name=jpl />\n\nHeliogyro design is similar to the blades on a helicopter. The design is faster to manufacture due to lightweight centrifugal stiffening of sails. Also, they are highly efficient in cost and velocity because the blades are lightweight and long. Unlike the square and spinning disk designs, heliogyro is easier to deploy because the blades are compacted on a reel. The blades roll out when they are deploying after the ejection from the spacecraft. As the heliogyro travels through space the system spins around because of the centrifugal acceleration. Finally, payloads for the space flights are placed in the center of gravity to even out the distribution of weight to ensure stable flight.<ref name=jpl />\n\nJPL also investigated \"ring sails\" (Spinning Disk Sail in the above diagram), panels attached to the edge of a rotating spacecraft. The panels would have slight gaps, about one to five percent of the total area. Lines would connect the edge of one sail to the other. Masses in the middles of these lines would pull the sails taut against the coning caused by the radiation pressure. JPL researchers said that this might be an attractive sail design for large manned structures. The inner ring, in particular, might be made to have artificial gravity roughly equal to the gravity on the surface of Mars.<ref name=jpl />\n\nA solar sail can serve a dual function as a high-gain antenna.<ref name=ant>{{cite web|author=Khayatian, Rahmatsamii, Porgorzelski, UCLA and JPL|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12275/1/01-0276.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527065541/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12275/1/01-0276.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-27|title=An Antenna Concept Integrated with Future Solar Sails}}</ref> Designs differ, but most modify the [[metallizing|metalization]] pattern to create a holographic monochromatic lens or mirror in the radio frequencies of interest, including visible light.<ref name=ant />\n\n== Electric solar wind sail ==\n{{main article | Electric sail }}\n\n[[Pekka Janhunen]] from [[Finnish Meteorological Institute|FMI]] has invented a type of solar sail called the [[electric solar wind sail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.fmi.fi/~pjanhune/Esail/|title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space|author=NASA}}</ref> Mechanically it has little in common with the traditional solar sail design. The sails are replaced with straightened conducting tethers (wires) placed [[radius|radially]] around the host ship. The wires are electrically charged to create an [[electric field]] around the wires. The electric field extends a few tens of metres into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. The solar electrons are reflected by the electric field (like the photons on a traditional solar sail). The radius of the sail is from the electric field rather than the actual wire itself, making the sail lighter. The craft can also be steered by regulating the electric charge of the wires. A practical electric sail would have 50–100 straightened wires with a length of about 20&nbsp;km each.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nElectric solar wind sails can adjust their electrostatic fields and sail attitudes.\n\n== Magnetic sail ==\n{{main article | Magnetic sail }}\n\nA [[magnetic sail]] would also employ the solar wind. However, the magnetic field deflects the electrically charged particles in the wind. It uses wire loops, and runs a static current through them instead of applying a static voltage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf |title=Fellows meeting |date=1999 |website=www.niac.usra.edu/files }}</ref>\n\nAll these designs maneuver, though the mechanisms are different.\n\nMagnetic sails bend the path of the charged protons that are in the [[solar wind]]. By changing the sails' attitudes, and the size of the magnetic fields, they can change the amount and direction of the thrust.\n\n==Sail making==\n\n===Materials===\n\nThe most common material in current designs is a thin layer of aluminum coating on a polymer (plastic) sheet, such as aluminized 2&nbsp;µm [[Kapton]] film. The polymer provides mechanical support as well as flexibility, while the thin metal layer provides the reflectivity.  Such material resists the heat of a pass close to the Sun and still remains reasonably strong. The aluminum reflecting film is on the Sun side. The sails of ''[[Cosmos 1]]'' were made of [[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminized PET film]] ([[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar]]).\n\n[[Eric Drexler]] developed a concept for a sail in which the polymer was removed.<ref name=Drexler>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/16234/06483741.pdf?sequence=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604235745/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/16234/06483741.pdf?sequence=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-04|author=Drexler, K. E.|year=1977|title=Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System, MS Thesis |publisher=Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Techniology, Boston}}</ref> He proposed very high thrust-to-mass solar sails, and made prototypes of the sail material. His sail would use panels of thin aluminium film (30 to 100 [[nanometre]]s thick) supported by a [[tension (physics)|tensile]] structure. The sail would rotate and would have to be continually under thrust. He made and handled samples of the film in the laboratory, but the material was too delicate to survive folding, launch, and deployment. The design planned to rely on space-based production of the film panels, joining them to a deploy-able tension structure. Sails in this class would offer high area per unit mass and hence accelerations up to \"fifty times higher\" than designs based on deploy-able plastic films.<ref name=Drexler />\nThe material developed for the Drexler solar sail was a thin aluminium film with a baseline thickness of 0.1&nbsp;µm, to be fabricated by vapor deposition in a space-based system. Drexler used a similar process to prepare films on the ground. As anticipated, these films demonstrated adequate strength and robustness for handling in the laboratory and for use in space, but not for folding, launch, and deployment.\n\nResearch by [[Geoffrey Landis]] in 1998–1999, funded by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]], showed that various materials such as [[alumina]] for laser lightsails and [[carbon fiber]] for microwave pushed lightsails were superior sail materials to the previously standard aluminium or Kapton films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/4Landis.pdf|title=Advanced Solar- and Laser-pushed Lightsail Concepts|author=Geoffrey A. Landis, Ohio Aerospace Institute|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Energy Science Laboratories developed a new [[carbon fiber]] material that might be useful for solar sails.<ref name=\"carbonsail_000302.html\">[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101191444/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |date=January 1, 2011 }} (DEAD LINK!)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/99/sbir/phase1/SBIR-99-1-25.02-2034.html|title=Carbon Solar Sail|website=sbir.nasa.gov}}</ref> The material is over 200 times thicker than conventional solar sail designs, but it is so porous that it has the same mass. The rigidity and durability of this material could make solar sails that are significantly sturdier than plastic films. The material could self-deploy and should withstand higher temperatures.\n\nThere has been some theoretical speculation about using [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques to create advanced, strong, hyper-light sail material, based on [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]] mesh weaves, where the weave \"spaces\" are less than half the wavelength of light impinging on the sail. While such materials have so far only been produced in laboratory conditions, and the means for manufacturing such material on an industrial scale are not yet available, such materials could mass less than 0.1&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news5890.html |title=Researchers produce strong, transparent carbon nanotube sheets |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref> making them lighter than any current sail material by a factor of at least 30. For comparison, 5 micrometre thick [[Mylar]] sail material mass 7&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>, aluminized Kapton films have a mass as much as 12&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=jpl /> and Energy Science Laboratories' new carbon fiber material masses 3&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"carbonsail_000302.html\"/>\n\nThe least dense metal is [[lithium]], about 5 times less dense than aluminium.  Fresh, unoxidized surfaces are reflective.  At a thickness of 20&nbsp;nm, lithium has an area density of 0.011&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>.  A high-performance sail could be made of lithium alone at 20&nbsp;nm (no emission layer).  It would have to be fabricated in space and not used to approach the Sun. In the limit, a sail craft might be constructed with a total areal density of around 0.02&nbsp;g/m<sup>2</sup>, giving it a lightness number of 67 and a<sub>c</sub> of about 400&nbsp;mm/s<sup>2</sup>. [[Magnesium]] and [[beryllium]] are also potential materials for high-performance sails.  These 3 metals can be alloyed with each other and with aluminium.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\n===Reflection and emissivity layers===\nAluminium is the common choice for the reflection layer.  It typically has a thickness of at least 20&nbsp;nm, with a reflectivity of 0.88 to 0.90.  Chromium is a good choice for the emission layer on the face away from the Sun.  It can readily provide emissivity values of 0.63 to 0.73 for thicknesses from 5 to 20&nbsp;nm on plastic film.  Usable emissivity values are empirical because thin-film effects dominate; bulk emissivity values do not hold up in these cases because material thickness is much thinner than the emitted wavelengths.<ref name=\"Wright Ch4\">Wright, ibid. Ch 4</ref>\n\n===Fabrication===\nSails are fabricated on Earth on long tables where ribbons are unrolled and joined to create the sails. Sail material needed to have as little weight as possible because it would require the use of the shuttle to carry the craft into orbit. Thus, these sails are packed, launched, and unfurled in space.<ref>Rowe, W. m. 'Sail film materials and supporting structure for a solar sail, a preliminary design, volume 4.\" Jet Propulsion Lab. California, Pasadena, California.</ref>\n\nIn the future, fabrication could take place in orbit inside large frames that support the sail.  This would result in lower mass sails and elimination of the risk of deployment failure.\n\n==Operations==\n[[File:Sail-InOut.gif|thumb|A solar sail can spiral inward or outward by setting the sail angle]]\n\n===Changing orbits===\nSailing operations are simplest in interplanetary orbits, where altitude changes are done at low rates. For outward bound trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented forward of the Sun line, which increases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving farther from the Sun. For inward trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented behind the Sun line, which decreases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving in toward the Sun.  It is worth noting that only the Sun's gravity pulls the craft toward the Sun—there is no analog to a sailboat's tacking to windward. To change orbital inclination, the force vector is turned out of the plane of the velocity vector.\n\nIn orbits around planets or other bodies, the sail is oriented so that its force vector has a component along the velocity vector, either in the direction of motion for an outward spiral, or against the direction of motion for an inward spiral.\n\nTrajectory optimizations can often require intervals of reduced or zero thrust.  This can be achieved by rolling the craft around the Sun line with the sail set at an appropriate angle to reduce or remove the thrust.<ref name=\"Wright\" />\n\n===Swing-by maneuvers===\nA close solar passage can be used to increase a craft's energy.  The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System.  The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical.  The minimum approach distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other structure, load effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity).  A close passage can result in substantial optical degradation.  Required turn rates can increase substantially for a close passage.  A sail craft arriving at a star can use a close passage to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.\n\nA lunar swing-by can have important benefits for trajectories leaving from or arriving at Earth.  This can reduce trip times, especially in cases where the sail is heavily loaded.  A swing-by can also be used to obtain favorable departure or arrival directions relative to Earth.\n\nA planetary swing-by could also be employed similar to what is done with coasting spacecraft, but good alignments might not exist due to the requirements for overall optimization of the trajectory.<ref>Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix C.</ref>\n\nThe following table lists some example concepts using beamed laser propulsion as proposed by the physicist [[Robert L.

In order to do this, the star tracker must obtain an image of the stars, measure their apparent position in the reference frame of the spacecraft, and identify the stars so their position can be compared with their known absolute position from a star catalog. A star tracker may include a processor to identify stars by comparing the pattern of observed stars with the known pattern of stars in the sky.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, star trackers were an important part of early long-range [[ballistic missile]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, in the era when [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) were not sufficiently accurate for intercontinental ranges.<ref name=tech/>\n\nSelecting a guide star depends on the time, due to the Earth's rotation, and the location of the target. Generally, a selection of several bright stars would be used. For systems based solely on star tracking, some sort of recording mechanism, typically a [[magnetic tape]], was pre-recorded with a signal that represented the angle of the star over the period of a day. At launch, the tape was forwarded to the appropriate time.<ref name=tech/>\n\nDuring the flight, the signal on the tape was used to roughly position a telescope so it would point at the expected position of the star. At the telescope's focus was a photocell and some sort of signal-generator, typically a spinning disk known as a ''chopper''. The chopper caused the star to repeatedly appear and disappear on the photocell, producing a signal that was then smoothed to produce an [[alternating current]] output. The phase of that signal was compared to the one on the tape to produce a guidance signal.<ref name=tech/>\n\nThe system could be further improved by combining it with an INS, in which case additional circuitry on the INS generated the reference signal, eliminating the need for the separate tape.<ref name=tech>{{cite book |first= Marvin |last=Hobbs |title= Basics of Missile Guidance and Space Techniques |publisher= [[Wildside Press]] |date=2010 |pages=1–104 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=a0TxaTq2rQIC&pg=SA1-PA104}}</ref> These \"stellar inertial\" systems were especially common from the 1950s through the 1980s, although some systems use it to this day.{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Current technology ==\n\nMany models<ref>{{cite web|title=Star Trackers|url=http://www.isr.goodrich.com/StarTrackers.shtml|publisher=Goodrich|accessdate=25 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517004222/http://www.isr.goodrich.com/StarTrackers.shtml|archivedate=May 17, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ballaerospace.com/page.jsp?page=104|title= Ball Aerospace star trackers|publisher=Ballaerospace.com|accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.jena-optronik.de/en/aocs.html|title= Attitude and Orbit Control Systems|publisher=Jena-optronik.de|accessdate=2013-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sodern.com/website/en/ref/Optronic_215.html|title= Optronic activities|publisher=[[Sodern]]|accessdate=2017-11-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://openstartracker.org/|title= OpenStartracker|publisher=[[UBNL]]|accessdate=2018-01-14}}</ref> are currently available. Star trackers, which require high sensitivity, may become confused by sunlight reflected from the spacecraft, or by exhaust gas plumes from the spacecraft thrusters (either sunlight reflection or contamination of the star tracker window). Star trackers are also susceptible to a variety of errors (low spatial frequency, high spatial frequency, temporal, ...) in addition to a variety of optical sources of error ([[spherical aberration]], [[chromatic aberration]], etc.). There are also many potential sources of confusion for the star identification [[algorithm]] ([[planets]], [[comets]], [[supernovae]], the [[bimodal]] character of the [[point spread function]] for adjacent stars, other nearby satellites, point-source light pollution from large cities on Earth, ...). There are roughly 57 bright [[List of selected stars for navigation|navigational stars]] in common use. However, for more complex missions, entire [[Ephemeris|star field databases]] are used to determine spacecraft orientation. A typical [[star catalog]] for high-fidelity attitude determination is originated from a standard base catalog (for example from the [[United States Naval Observatory]]) and then filtered to remove problematic stars, for example due to [[apparent magnitude]] variability, [[color index]] uncertainty, or a location within the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]] implying unreliability. These types of star catalogs can have thousands of stars stored in memory on board the spacecraft, or else processed using tools at the [[ground station]] and then uploaded.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Celestial navigation]]\n* [[GoTo (telescopes)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Spacecraft attitude control]]\n[[Category:Astrodynamics]]\n[[Category:Orbits]]\n[[Category:Spaceflight concepts]]\n[[Category:Celestial navigation]]"

Depending on the design of a craft's maneuvering and stability systems, it may simply be a smaller thruster complementing the main propulsion system,<ref name=nasa20111230/> or it may complement larger [[attitude control]] thrusters,<ref name=nasaRCS/> or may be a part of the [[reaction control system]].\nThe name is derived from [[Vernier scale|vernier calipers]] (named after [[Pierre Vernier]]) which have a primary scale for gross measurements, and a secondary scale for fine measurements.\n\nVernier thrusters are used when a heavy spacecraft requires a wide range of different thrust levels for attitude or velocity control, as for maneuvering during docking with other spacecraft.\n\nOn space vehicles with two sizes of attitude control thrusters, the main ACS (Attitude Control System) thrusters are used for larger movements, while the verniers are reserved for smaller adjustments.\n\nDue to their weight and the extra plumbing required for their operation, vernier rockets are seldom used in new designs.<ref name=nasa20111230>\n{{cite web\n | title = Rocket Control: Examples of Controls\n | publisher = NASA's Glenn Research Center\n | url = http://microgravity.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktcontrl.html\n | accessdate = December 30, 2011\n}}\n</ref>\nInstead, as modern rocket engines gained better control, larger thrusters could also be fired for very short pulses, resulting in the same change of [[momentum]] as a longer thrust from a smaller thruster.\n\nVernier thrusters are used in rockets such as the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] for vehicle maneuvering because the main engine is fixed in place. For earlier versions of the [[Atlas rocket]] family (prior to the Atlas III), in addition to maneuvering, the verniers were used for roll control, although the booster engines could also perform this function. After sustainer engine cutoff, the verniers would execute solo mode and fire for several seconds to make fine adjustments to the vehicle attitude. The Thor/Delta family also used verniers for roll control, but were mounted on the base of the thrust section flanking the main engine.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket engines.jpg|thumbnail|right|The first and second-stage engines of a [[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]], showing the four [[RD-107]] modules with twin vernier nozzles each, and the central RD-108 with four steerable vernier thrusters.]]\n\n* The [[R-7 family|R-7 rocket family]], with over 1700 successful launches to date, still depends on the S1.358000 vernier thrusters in its first and second stage.

Because its appearance is identical in three distinct orientations, its rotational symmetry is three-fold.]]\n'''Rotational symmetry''', also known as '''radial symmetry''' in biology, is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn. An object's degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks exactly the same for each rotation.\n\n== Formal treatment ==\n{{See also|Rotational invariance}} \nFormally the  rotational symmetry is [[symmetry]] with respect to some or all [[rotation]]s in ''m''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Rotations are [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]], i.e., [[Isometry|isometries]] preserving [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]. Therefore, a [[symmetry group]] of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of ''E''<sup>+</sup>(''m'') (see [[Euclidean group]]).\n\nSymmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies [[translational symmetry]] with respect to all translations, so space is homogeneous, and the symmetry group is the whole ''E''(''m''). With the [[Symmetry#Mathematical model for symmetry|modified notion of symmetry for vector fields]] the symmetry group can also be ''E''<sup>+</sup>(''m'').\n\nFor symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin. These rotations form the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(''m''), the group of ''m''×''m'' [[orthogonal matrices]] with determinant 1. For {{math|1=''m'' = 3}} this is the [[rotation group SO(3)]].\n\nIn another definition of the word, the rotation group ''of an object'' is the symmetry group within ''E''<sup>+</sup>(''n''), the [[Euclidean group|group of direct isometries]] ; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.\n\nLaws of physics [[isotropy|are SO(3)-invariant]] if they do not distinguish different directions in space. Because of [[Noether's theorem]], rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the [[angular momentum]] conservation law.\n\n===Discrete rotational symmetry===\n'''Rotational symmetry of order&nbsp;''n''''', also called '''''n''-fold rotational symmetry''', or '''discrete rotational symmetry of the ''n''th order''', with respect to a particular point (in 2D) or axis (in 3D) means that rotation by an angle of 360°/n (180°, 120°, 90°, 72°, 60°, 51&nbsp;{{frac|3|7}}°, etc.) does not change the object.  Note that \"1-fold\" symmetry is no symmetry (all objects look alike after a rotation of 360°).\n\nThe [[Crystal system#Overview of point groups by crystal system|notation]] for ''n''-fold symmetry is '''''C<sub>n</sub>''''' or simply \"''n''\". The actual [[symmetry group]] is specified by the point or axis of symmetry, together with the ''n''. For each point or axis of symmetry, the abstract group type is [[cyclic group]] of order&nbsp;''n'', Z<sub>''n''</sub>. Although for the latter also the notation ''C''<sub>''n''</sub> is used, the geometric and abstract ''C''<sub>''n''</sub> should be distinguished: there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different, see [[Point groups in three dimensions#Cyclic symmetry groups in 3D cyclic symmetry groups|cyclic symmetry groups in 3D]].\n\nThe [[fundamental domain]] is a sector of 360°/n.\n\nExamples without additional [[reflection symmetry]]:\n*''n'' = 2, 180°: the ''dyad''; letters Z, N, S; the outlines, albeit not the colors, of the [[yin and yang]] symbol; the [[Union Flag]] (as divided along the flag's diagonal and rotated about the flag's center point)\n*''n'' = 3, 120°: ''triad'', [[triskelion]], [[Borromean rings]], [[Mitsubishi]] logo; sometimes the term ''trilateral symmetry'' is used;\n*''n'' = 4, 90°: ''tetrad'', [[swastika]]\n*''n'' = 6, 60°: ''hexad'', [[Star of David]]\n*''n'' = 8, 45°: ''octad'', Octagonal [[muqarnas]], computer-generated (CG), ceiling\n\n''C''<sub>''n''</sub> is the rotation group of a regular ''n''-sided [[polygon]] in 2D and of a regular ''n''-sided [[pyramid]] in 3D.\n\nIf there is e.g. rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100°, then also with respect to one of 20°, the [[greatest common divisor]] of 100° and 360°.\n\nA typical 3D object with rotational symmetry (possibly also with perpendicular axes) but no mirror symmetry is a [[propeller]].\n\n===Examples===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=600\n|- \n!

The group is [[isomorphic]] to [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>4</sub>. \n*3×4-fold, 4×3-fold, and 6×2-fold axes: the rotation group&nbsp;''O'' of order&nbsp;24 of a [[cube]] and a regular [[octahedron]]. The group is isomorphic to [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>4</sub>. \n*6×5-fold, 10×3-fold, and 15×2-fold axes: the rotation group&nbsp;''I'' of order&nbsp;60 of a [[dodecahedron]] and an [[icosahedron]]. The group is isomorphic to alternating group&nbsp;''A''<sub>5</sub>. The group contains 10 versions of ''D<sub>3</sub>'' and 6 versions of ''D<sub>5</sub>'' (rotational symmetries like prisms and antiprisms).\n\nIn the case of the [[Platonic solid]]s, the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges, and the number of them is half the number of edges. The other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces, except in the case of the tetrahedron, where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one face.\n\n===Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle===<!-- [[axisymmetric]], [[axisymmetrical]] and [[axisymmetry]] redirect to here -->\nRotational symmetry with respect to any angle is, in two dimensions, [[circular symmetry]]. The fundamental domain is a [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|half-line]].\n\nIn three dimensions we can distinguish '''cylindrical symmetry''' and '''spherical symmetry''' (no change when rotating about one axis, or for any rotation). That is, no dependence on the angle using [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)#Cylindrical coordinates|cylindrical coordinates]] and no dependence on either angle using [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)#Spherical coordinates|spherical coordinates]]. The fundamental domain is a [[half-plane]] through the axis, and a radial half-line, respectively. '''Axisymmetric''' or '''axisymmetrical''' are [[adjective]]s which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry, or '''axisymmetry''' (i.e. rotational symmetry with respect to a central axis) like a [[doughnut]] ([[torus]]). An example of approximate spherical symmetry is the Earth (with respect to density and other physical and chemical properties).\n\nIn 4D, continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2D rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane, about the point of intersection. An object can also have  rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes, e.g. if it is the [[Cartesian product]] of two rotationally symmetry 2D figures, as in the case of e.g. the [[duocylinder]] and various regular [[duoprism]]s.\n\n===Rotational symmetry with translational symmetry===\n{| class=wikitable align=right width=400\n|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p4.png|160px]]<BR>Arrangement within a [[primitive cell]] of 2- and 4-fold rotocenters.

For the case p6, a fundamental domain is indicated in yellow.\n|}\n2-fold rotational symmetry together with single [[translational symmetry]] is one of the [[Frieze group]]s. There are two rotocenters per [[primitive cell]].\n\nTogether with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the  following [[wallpaper group]]s, with axes per primitive cell:\n*p2 (2222): 4×2-fold; rotation group of a [[parallelogram]]mic, [[rectangle|rectangular]], and [[rhombus|rhombic]] [[Lattice (group)|lattice]].\n*p3 (333): 3×3-fold; ''not'' the rotation group of any lattice (every lattice is upside-down the same, but that does not apply for this symmetry); it is e.g. the rotation group of the [[Tilings of regular polygons#Regular tilings|regular triangular tiling]] with the  equilateral triangles alternatingly colored. \n*p4 (442): 2×4-fold, 2×2-fold; rotation group of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] lattice.\n*p6 (632): 1×6-fold, 2×3-fold, 3×2-fold; rotation group of a [[hexagonal]] lattice.\n*2-fold rotocenters (including possible 4-fold and 6-fold), if present at all, form the translate of a lattice equal to the translational lattice, scaled by a factor 1/2. In the case translational symmetry in one dimension, a similar property applies, though the term \"lattice\" does not apply.\n*3-fold rotocenters (including possible 6-fold), if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 30° (or equivalently 90°), and scaled by a factor <math>\\frac{1}{3} \\sqrt {3}</math>\n*4-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular square lattice equal to the translational lattice, rotated by 45°, and scaled by a factor <math>\\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt {2}</math>\n*6-fold rotocenters, if present at all, form a regular hexagonal lattice which is the translate of the translational lattice.\n\nScaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor. Therefore, the number of 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively, again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold, etc.\n\n3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one (or ditto in 3D with respect to parallel axes) implies rotation group p6, i.e. double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point (or, in 3D, parallel axis).

      "text": "{{Short description|Coupling in quantum physics}}{{Coupling in molecules}}\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the procedure of constructing [[eigenstates]] of  total  angular momentum out of eigenstates of  separate angular momenta is called  '''angular momentum coupling'''. For instance, the orbit and spin of a single particle can interact through [[spin–orbit interaction]], in which case the complete physical picture must include spin-orbit coupling. Or two charged particles, each with a well-defined angular momentum, may interact   by [[Electrostatic#Coulomb's law|Coulomb forces]], in which case coupling of the two one-particle angular momenta  to a total angular momentum is a useful step in the solution of the two-particle [[Schrödinger equation]].\nIn both cases the  separate angular momenta are no longer [[constants of motion]], but the sum of the two angular momenta usually still is.  Angular momentum coupling in atoms is of importance in  atomic [[spectroscopy]]. Angular momentum coupling of [[electron spin]]s is of importance in [[quantum chemistry]]. Also in the [[nuclear shell model]] angular momentum coupling is ubiquitous.<ref>{{cite book|title = Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|author=R.

Atkins|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1974|isbn=0-19-855493-1}}</ref>\n\nIn [[astronomy]], '''spin-orbit coupling''' reflects the general law of [[conservation of angular momentum]], which holds for celestial systems as well. In simple cases, the direction of the [[angular momentum]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]] is neglected, and the spin-orbit coupling is the ratio between the frequency with which a [[planet]] or other [[celestial body]] spins about its own axis to that with which it orbits another body. This is more commonly known as [[orbital resonance]]. Often, the underlying physical effects are [[tide|tidal forces]].\n\n==General theory and detailed origin==\n[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|right|thumb|Orbital angular momentum (denoted '''l''' or '''L''').]]\n\n===Angular momentum conservation===\n\n[[Conservation of angular momentum]] is the principle that the total angular momentum of a system has a constant magnitude and direction if the system is subjected to no external [[torque]]. [[Angular momentum]] is a property of a physical system that is a [[constant of motion]] (also referred to as a ''conserved'' property, time-independent and well-defined) in two situations:\n\n#The system experiences a spherically symmetric potential field. \n#The system moves (in quantum mechanical sense) in isotropic space.\n\nIn both cases the angular momentum operator [[commutator|commutes]] with the  [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] of the system. By Heisenberg's [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle|uncertainty relation]] this means that the angular momentum and the energy (eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian) can be measured at the same time.\n\nAn example of the first situation is an atom whose [[electron]]s only experiences the [[Coulomb force]] of its [[atomic nucleus]]. If we ignore the electron-electron interaction (and other small interactions such as [[spin-orbit coupling]]),  the ''orbital angular momentum'' '''l''' of each electron commutes with the total Hamiltonian. In this model the atomic Hamiltonian is a sum of kinetic energies of the electrons and the spherically symmetric electron-nucleus interactions. The individual electron angular momenta '''l'''<sub>''i''</sub> commute with this Hamiltonian. That is, they are conserved properties of this approximate model of the atom.\n\nAn example of the second situation is a [[rigid rotor]] moving in field-free space. A rigid rotor has a well-defined, time-independent,  angular momentum.\n\nThese two situations originate in classical mechanics. The third kind of conserved angular momentum, associated with [[spin (physics)|spin]], does not have a classical counterpart. However, all rules of angular momentum coupling apply to spin as well.\n\nIn general the conservation of angular momentum implies full rotational symmetry \n(described by the groups [[SO(3)]] and [[SU(2)]]) and, conversely, spherical symmetry implies conservation of angular momentum. If two or more physical systems have conserved angular momenta, it can be useful to combine these momenta to a total angular momentum of the combined system&mdash;a conserved property of the total system. \nThe building of eigenstates of the total conserved angular momentum from the angular momentum eigenstates of the individual subsystems is referred to as ''angular momentum coupling''.\n\nApplication of angular momentum coupling is useful  when there is an interaction between subsystems that, without  interaction, would have conserved angular momentum. By the very interaction the spherical symmetry of the subsystems is broken, but the angular momentum of the total system remains a constant of  motion. Use of the latter fact is helpful in the solution of the Schrödinger equation.\n\n===Examples===\n\nAs an example we consider two electrons, 1 and 2, in an atom (say the [[helium]] atom). If there is no electron-electron interaction, but only electron-nucleus interaction, the two electrons can be rotated around the nucleus independently of each other; nothing happens to their energy. Both operators,  '''l'''<sub>1</sub> and '''l'''<sub>2</sub>,  are conserved.\nHowever, if we switch on the electron-electron interaction that depends on the distance ''d''(1,2) between the electrons, then only a simultaneous\nand equal rotation of the two electrons will leave  ''d''(1,2) invariant. In such a case neither\n'''l'''<sub>1</sub> nor '''l'''<sub>2</sub> is a constant of  motion in general, but the total orbital angular momentum '''L''' = '''l'''<sub>1</sub> + '''l'''<sub>2</sub>\nis. Given the eigenstates of '''l'''<sub>1</sub> and '''l'''<sub>2</sub>, the construction of eigenstates of '''L''' (which still is conserved)  is the ''coupling of the angular momenta of electrons 1 and 2''.\n\nThe total orbital angular momentum quantum number '''L''' is restricted to integer values and must satisfy the triangular condition that <math>|l_1 - l_2| \\leq L \\leq l_1 + l_2</math>, \nsuch that the three nonnegative integer values could correspond to the three sides of a triangle.<ref>Merzbacher, Eugen (1998). Quantum Mechanics (3rd ed.). John Wiley. pp. 428–9. {{ISBN|0-471-88702-1}}.</ref>\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], coupling also exists between angular momenta belonging to different [[Hilbert space]]s of a single object, e.g. its [[spin (physics)|spin]] and its orbital [[angular momentum]]. If the spin has half-integer values, such as 1/2 for an electron, then the total (orbital plus spin) angular momentum will also be restricted to half-integer values.\n\nReiterating slightly differently the above:  one expands the [[quantum state]]s of composed systems (i.e. made of subunits like two [[hydrogen atom]]s or two [[electron]]s) in [[basis (linear algebra)|basis sets]] which are made of [[tensor product]]s of [[quantum state]]s which in turn describe the subsystems individually.  We assume that the states of the subsystems can be chosen as eigenstates of their angular momentum operators (and of their component along any arbitrary ''z'' axis).\n\nThe subsystems are therefore correctly described by a set of ''{{ell}}'', ''m'' [[quantum number]]s (see [[angular momentum]] for details). When there is interaction among the subsystems, the total Hamiltonian contains terms that do not commute with the angular operators acting on the subsystems only. However, these terms ''do'' commute with the ''total'' angular momentum operator. Sometimes one refers to the non-commuting interaction terms in the Hamiltonian as ''angular momentum coupling terms'', because they necessitate the angular momentum coupling.\n\n==Spin-orbit coupling==\n{{Main article|Spin-orbit coupling}}\n\nThe behavior of [[atoms]] and smaller [[Subatomic particle|particles]] is well described by the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], in which each particle has an intrinsic angular momentum called [[spin (physics)|spin]] and specific configurations (of e.g. electrons in an atom) are described by a set of [[quantum numbers]].  Collections of particles also have angular momenta and corresponding quantum numbers, and under different circumstances the angular momenta of the parts couple in different ways to form the angular momentum of the whole. Angular momentum coupling is a category including some of the ways that subatomic particles can interact with each other.\n\nIn [[atomic physics]], [[spin-orbit coupling]], also known as '''spin-pairing''', describes a weak magnetic interaction, or [[coupling (physics)|coupling]], of the particle [[spin (physics)|spin]] and the [[orbital motion (quantum)|orbital motion]] of this particle, e.g. the [[electron]] spin and its motion around an [[atom]]ic [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. One of its effects is to separate the energy of internal states of the atom, e.g. spin-aligned and spin-antialigned that would otherwise be identical in energy.   This interaction is responsible for many of the details of atomic structure.\n\nIn [[solid-state physics]], the spin coupling with the orbital motion can lead to splitting of [[Electronic band structure|energy bands]] due to [[Dresselhaus effect|Dresselhaus]] or [[Rashba effect|Rashba]] effects. \n\nIn the [[macroscopic]] world of [[astrodynamics|orbital mechanics]], the term ''spin-orbit coupling'' is sometimes used in the same sense as [[orbital resonance|spin-orbital resonance]].\n\n===LS coupling===\n[[File:LS coupling.svg|250px|thumb|Illustration of L-S coupling.

The interaction between the quantum numbers '''L''' and '''S''' is called '''Russell&ndash;Saunders coupling''' (after [[Henry Norris Russell]] and Frederick A. Saunders<!-- (1875-1963) -->) or '''LS coupling'''.

In this situation, each orbital angular momentum '''ℓ'''<sub>''i''</sub> tends to combine with the corresponding individual spin angular momentum '''s'''<sub>''i''</sub>, originating an individual total angular momentum '''j'''<sub>''i''</sub>.

When the state of an atom has been specified with a term symbol, the allowed transitions can be found through [[selection rule]]s by considering which transitions would conserve [[angular momentum]]. A [[photon]] has spin 1, and when there is a transition with emission or absorption of a photon the atom will need to change state to conserve angular momentum. The term symbol selection rules are. Δ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, Δ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;±1, Δ''l''&nbsp;=&nbsp;±&nbsp;1, Δ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0,&nbsp;±1\n\nThe expression \"term symbol\" is derived from the \"term series\" associated with the [[Rydberg state]]s of an atom and their [[Atomic energy level#Orbital state energy level|energy levels]]. In the [[Rydberg formula]] the frequency or wave number of the light emitted by a hydrogen-like atom is proportional to the difference between the two terms of a transition. The series known to early [[Atomic spectral line|spectroscopy]] were designated ''sharp'', ''principal'', ''diffuse'' and ''fundamental'' and consequently the letters S, P, D, and F were used to represent the orbital angular momentum states of an atom.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herzberg|first=Gerhard|title=Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure|publisher=Dover|location=New York|year=1945|isbn=0-486-60115-3|pages=54–5}}</ref>\n\n== Relativistic effects ==\n\nIn very heavy atoms, relativistic shifting of the energies of the electron energy levels accentuates spin-orbit coupling effect.  Thus, for example, uranium molecular orbital diagrams must directly incorporate relativistic symbols when considering interactions with other atoms.\n\n== Nuclear coupling ==\n\nIn atomic nuclei, the spin-orbit interaction is much stronger than for atomic electrons, and is incorporated directly into the nuclear shell model.  In addition, unlike atomic-electron term symbols, the lowest energy state is not ''L''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''S'', but rather, ''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s''. All nuclear levels whose ''ℓ'' value (orbital angular momentum) is greater than zero are thus split in the shell model to create states designated by ''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s'' and ''ℓ''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''s''.  Due to the nature of the [[Nuclear shell model|shell model]], which assumes an average potential rather than a central Coulombic potential, the nucleons that go into the ''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s'' and ''ℓ''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''s'' nuclear states are considered degenerate within each orbital (e.g. The 2''p''3/2 contains four nucleons, all of the same energy. Higher in energy is the 2''p''1/2 which contains two equal-energy nucleons).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Clebsch&ndash;Gordan coefficients]]\n* [[Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)]]\n* [[Spherical basis]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atomic/lcoup.html#c1 LS and jj coupling]\n* [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/atomic/term.html#c1 Term symbol]\n* [http://nucracker.volya.net/index.php?p=spins Web calculator of spin couplings: shell model, atomic term symbol]\n\n[[Category:Atomic physics]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n\n[[ar:ترابط مغزلي مداري]]\n[[it:Interazione spin-orbita]]"

In both classical and quantum mechanical systems, angular momentum (together with [[linear momentum]] and [[energy]]) is one of the three fundamental properties of motion.<ref name=\"Liboff\">Introductory Quantum Mechanics, [[Richard L.

'''L''' (just like '''p''' and '''r''') is a ''vector operator'' (a vector whose components are operators), i.e. <math>\\mathbf{L} = \\left(L_x, L_y, L_z\\right)</math> where ''L''<sub>x</sub>, ''L''<sub>y</sub>, ''L''<sub>z</sub> are three different quantum-mechanical operators.\n\nIn the special case of a single particle with no [[electric charge]] and no [[spin (physics)|spin]], the orbital angular momentum operator can be written in the position basis as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L} = -i\\hbar(\\mathbf{r} \\times \\nabla)</math>\n\nwhere ∇ is the vector differential operator, [[del]].\n\n===Spin angular momentum===\n{{main|Spin (physics)}}\nThere is another type of angular momentum, called [[spin (physics)|''spin angular momentum'']] (more often shortened to ''spin''), represented by the spin operator '''S'''. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is only a metaphor: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space. All [[elementary particles]] have a characteristic spin, which is usually nonzero. For example, [[electron]]s always have \"spin 1/2\" while [[photon]]s always have \"spin 1\" (details [[#Quantization|below]]).\n\n===Total angular momentum===\nFinally, there is [[total angular momentum]] '''J''', which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of a particle or system:\n:<math>\\mathbf{J} = \\mathbf{L} + \\mathbf{S}.</math>\n\n[[Conservation of angular momentum]] states that '''J''' for a closed system, or '''J''' for the whole universe, is conserved.

Two complementary observables cannot be measured simultaneously; instead they satisfy an [[uncertainty principle]]. The more accurately one observable is known, the less accurately the other one can be known. Just as there is an uncertainty principle relating position and momentum, there are uncertainty principles for angular momentum.\n\nThe [[uncertainty principle|Robertson–Schrödinger relation]] gives the following uncertainty principle:\n:<math>\\sigma_{L_x} \\sigma_{L_y} \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\left| \\langle L_z \\rangle \\right|.</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma_X</math> is the [[standard deviation]] in the measured values of ''X'' and <math>\\langle X \\rangle</math> denotes the [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]] of ''X''. This inequality is also true if ''x, y, z'' are rearranged, or if ''L'' is replaced by ''J'' or ''S''.\n\nTherefore, two orthogonal components of angular momentum (for example L<sub>x</sub> and L<sub>y</sub>) are complementary and cannot be simultaneously known or measured, except in special cases such as <math>L_x = L_y = L_z = 0</math>.\n\nIt is, however, possible to simultaneously measure or specify ''L''<sup>2</sup> and any one component of ''L''; for example, ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>. This is often useful, and the values are characterized by the [[azimuthal quantum number]] (''l'') and the [[magnetic quantum number]] (''m''). In this case the quantum state of the system is a simultaneous eigenstate of the operators ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, but ''not'' of ''L''<sub>x</sub> or ''L''<sub>y</sub>. The eigenvalues are related to ''l'' and ''m'', as shown in the table below.\n\n==Quantization==\n{{see also|Azimuthal quantum number|Magnetic quantum number}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], angular momentum is ''quantized'' – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in \"quantum leaps\" between certain allowed values.

In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.]]\n\n===Derivation using ladder operators===\n{{main|Ladder operator#Angular momentum}}\nA common way to derive the quantization rules above is the method of ''[[ladder operator]]s''.<ref name=Griffithsladder>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | pages=147–149}}</ref> The ladder operators are defined:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  J_+ &\\equiv J_x + i J_y, \\\\\n  J_- &\\equiv J_x - i J_y\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSuppose a state <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z</math> (i.e., a state with a single, definite value of <math>J^2</math> and a single, definite value of <math>J_z</math>). Then using the commutation relations, one can prove that <math>J_+ |\\psi\\rangle</math> and <math>J_-|\\psi\\rangle</math> are ''also'' in the simultaneous eigenbasis, with the same value of <math>J^2</math>, but where <math>J_z |\\psi\\rangle</math> is increased or decreased by <math>\\hbar</math>, respectively. (It is also possible that one or both of these result vectors is the zero vector.) (For a proof, see [[ladder operator#Angular momentum]].)\n\nBy manipulating these ladder operators and using the commutation rules, it is possible to prove almost all of the quantization rules above.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=\"75%\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n! Click [show] on the right to see more details in the ladder-operator proof of the quantization rules<ref name=Griffithsladder/>\n|-\n| Before starting the main proof, we will note a useful fact: That <math>J_x^2, J_y^2, J_z^2</math> are [[positive-semidefinite matrix|positive-semidefinite operator]]s, meaning that all their eigenvalues are nonnegative. That also implies that the same is true for their sums, including <math>J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2</math> and <math>\\left(J^2 - J_z^2\\right) = \\left(J_x^2 + J_y^2\\right)</math>. The reason is that the square of ''any'' [[Hermitian operator]] is always positive semidefinite. (A Hermitian operator has real eigenvalues, so the squares of those eigenvalues are nonnegative.)\n\nAs above, assume that a state <math>| \\psi \\rangle</math> is a state in the simultaneous eigenbasis of <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z</math>. Its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J^2</math> can be written in the form <math>\\hbar^2 j (j + 1)</math> for some real number ''j'' > 0 (because as mentioned in the previous paragraph, <math>J^2</math> has nonnegative eigenvalues), and its eigenvalue with respect to <math>J_z</math> can be written <math>\\hbar m</math> for some real number ''m''. Instead of <math>|\\psi\\rangle</math> we will use the more descriptive notation <math>|\\psi\\rangle = |j, m\\rangle</math>.\n\nNext, consider the sequence (\"ladder\") of states\n:<math>\\{\\ldots\\;,\\; J_- J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_- |j, m\\rangle,\\; |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; J_+ J_+ |j, m\\rangle,\\; \\ldots\\}</math>\n\nSome entries in this infinite sequence may be the [[zero vector]] (as we will see). However, as described above, all the nonzero entries have the same value of <math>J^2</math>, and among the nonzero entries, each entry has a value of <math>J_z</math> which is exactly <math>\\hbar</math> more than the previous entry.\n\nIn this ladder, there can only be a finite number of nonzero entries, with infinite copies of the zero vector on the left and right. The reason is, as mentioned above, <math>(J^2 - J_z^2)</math> is positive-semidefinite, so if any quantum state is an eigenvector of both <math>J^2</math> and <math>J_z^2</math>, the former eigenvalue is larger. The states in the ladder all have the same <math>J^2</math> eigenvalue, but going very far to the left or the right, the <math>J_z^2</math> eigenvalue gets larger and larger. The only possible resolution is, as mentioned, that there are only finitely many nonzero entries in the ladder.\n\nNow, consider the last nonzero entry to the right of the ladder, <math>|j,m_{max} \\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_+ |j,m_{max}\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_+ |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m + 1)}|j, m + 1\\rangle</math>\n\nIf this is zero, then <math>j(j + 1) = m_\\text{max}\\left(m_\\text{max} + 1\\right)</math>, so <math>j = m</math> or <math>j = -m - 1</math>. However, because <math>J^2 - J_z^2</math> is positive-semidefinite, <math>\\hbar^2 j(j + 1) \\geq (\\hbar m)^2</math>, which means that the only possibility is <math>m_\\text{max} = j</math>.\n\nSimilarly, consider the first nonzero entry on the left of the ladder, <math>|j, m_\\text{min}\\rangle</math>. This state has the property that <math>J_- \\left|j, m_\\text{min}\\right\\rangle = 0</math>. As proven in the [[ladder operator]] article,\n:<math>J_- |j, m\\rangle = \\hbar \\sqrt{j(j + 1) - m(m - 1)} |j, m - 1\\rangle</math>\n\nAs above, the only possibility is that <math>m_\\text{min} = -j</math>\n\nSince ''m'' changes by 1 on each step of the ladder, <math>(j - (-j))</math> is an integer, so ''j'' is an integer or half-integer (0 or 0.5 or 1 or 1.5...).\n|}\n\nSince '''S''' and '''L''' have the same commutation relations as '''J''', the same ladder analysis works for them.\n\nThe ladder-operator analysis does '''''not''''' explain one aspect of the quantization rules above: the fact that '''L''' (unlike '''J''' and '''S''') cannot have half-integer quantum numbers. This fact can be proven (at least in the special case of one particle) by writing down every possible eigenfunction of ''L''<sup>2</sup> and ''L''<sub>z</sub>, (they are the [[spherical harmonic]]s), and seeing explicitly that none of them have half-integer quantum numbers.<ref>{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | year=1995 | pages=148–153}}</ref> An alternative derivation is [[#SU(2), SO(3), and 360° rotations|below]].\n\n===Visual interpretation===\n[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|\"250px\"|right|thumb|Illustration of the vector model of orbital angular momentum.]]\n{{main|Vector model of the atom}}\nSince the angular momenta are quantum operators, they cannot be drawn as vectors like in classical mechanics. Nevertheless, it is common to depict them heuristically in this way. Depicted on the right is a set of states with quantum numbers <math>\\ell = 2</math>, and <math>m_\\ell = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2</math> for the five cones from bottom to top. Since <math>|L| = \\sqrt{L^2} = \\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>, the vectors are all shown with length <math>\\hbar \\sqrt{6}</math>. The rings represent the fact that <math>L_z</math> is known with certainty, but <math>L_x</math> and  <math>L_y</math> are unknown; therefore every classical vector with the appropriate length and ''z''-component is drawn, forming a cone. The expected value of the angular momentum for a given ensemble of systems in the quantum state characterized by <math> \\ell</math> and <math>m_\\ell</math> could be somewhere on this cone while it cannot be defined for a single system (since the components of <math>L</math> do not commute with each other).\n\n===Quantization in macroscopic systems===\nThe quantization rules are technically true even for macroscopic systems, like the angular momentum '''L''' of a spinning tire. However they have no observable effect. For example, if <math>L_z/\\hbar</math> is roughly 100000000, it makes essentially no difference whether the precise value is an integer like 100000000 or 100000001, or a non-integer like 100000000.2—the discrete steps are too small to notice.\n\n==Angular momentum as the generator of rotations==\n{{see also|Total angular momentum quantum number}}\nThe most general and fundamental definition of angular momentum is as the ''generator'' of rotations.<ref name=littlejohn>{{cite web|url=http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1011/notes/spinrot.pdf|title= Lecture notes on rotations in quantum mechanics|first= Robert |last=Littlejohn|accessdate= 13 Jan 2012|work=Physics 221B Spring 2011|year=2011}}</ref> More specifically, let <math>R(\\hat{n},\\phi)</math> be a [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]], which rotates any quantum state about axis <math>\\hat{n}</math> by angle <math>\\phi</math>.

(This is different from a 360° rotation of the ''internal'' (spin) state of the particle, which might or might not be the same as no rotation at all.)

This is a [[vector space]], and therefore the manner in which the rotation operators map one state onto another is a [[group representation|''representation'']] of the group of rotation operators.\n:''When rotation operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]] (for R and R<sub>internal</sub>), or [[SO(3)]] (for R<sub>spatial</sub>).''\n\nFrom the relation between '''J''' and rotation operators,\n:''When angular momentum operators act on quantum states, it forms a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{su}(2)</math>  or <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math>.''\n\n(The Lie algebras of SU(2) and SO(3) are identical.)\n\nThe ladder operator derivation above is a method for classifying the representations of the Lie algebra SU(2).\n\n===Connection to commutation relations===\nClassical rotations do not commute with each other: For example, rotating 1° about the ''x''-axis then 1° about the ''y''-axis gives a slightly different overall rotation than rotating 1° about the ''y''-axis then 1° about the ''x''-axis. By carefully analyzing this noncommutativity, the commutation relations of the angular momentum operators can be derived.<ref name=littlejohn/>\n\n(This same calculational procedure is one way to answer the mathematical question \"What is the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]]s [[SO(3)]] or [[SU(2)]]?\")\n\n==Conservation of angular momentum==\nThe [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] ''H'' represents the energy and dynamics of the system. In a spherically-symmetric situation, the Hamiltonian is invariant under rotations:\n:<math>RHR^{-1} = H</math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is a [[rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]]. As a consequence, <math>[H, R] = 0</math>, and then <math>[H,\\mathbf{J}]=\\mathbf 0</math> due to the relationship between '''J''' and ''R''. By the [[Ehrenfest theorem]], it follows that '''J''' is conserved.\n\nTo summarize, if ''H'' is rotationally-invariant (spherically symmetric), then total angular momentum '''J''' is conserved. This is an example of [[Noether's theorem]].\n\nIf ''H'' is just the Hamiltonian for one particle, the total angular momentum of that one particle is conserved when the particle is in a [[central potential]] (i.e., when the potential energy function depends only on <math>\\left|\\mathbf{r}\\right|</math>). Alternatively, ''H'' may be the Hamiltonian of all particles and fields in the universe, and then ''H'' is ''always'' rotationally-invariant, as the fundamental laws of physics of the universe are the same regardless of orientation. This is the basis for saying [[conservation of angular momentum]] is a general principle of physics.\n\nFor a particle without spin, '''J''' = '''L''', so orbital angular momentum is conserved in the same circumstances. When the spin is nonzero, the [[spin-orbit interaction]] allows angular momentum to transfer from '''L''' to '''S''' or back. Therefore, '''L''' is not, on its own, conserved.\n\n==Angular momentum coupling==\n{{main|Angular momentum coupling|Clebsch–Gordan coefficients}}\n\nOften, two or more sorts of angular momentum interact with each other, so that angular momentum can transfer from one to the other. For example, in [[spin-orbit coupling]], angular momentum can transfer between '''L''' and '''S''', but only the total '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''' is conserved. In another example, in an atom with two electrons, each has its own angular momentum '''J'''<sub>1</sub> and '''J'''<sub>2</sub>, but only the total '''J''' = '''J'''<sub>1</sub> + '''J'''<sub>2</sub> is conserved.\n\nIn these situations, it is often useful to know the relationship between, on the one hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)_z, \\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)_z, \\left(J_2\\right)^2</math> all have definite values, and on the other hand, states where <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2, J_z</math> all have definite values, as the latter four are usually conserved (constants of motion). The procedure to go back and forth between these [[basis (linear algebra)|bases]] is to use [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]].\n\nOne important result in this field is that a relationship between the quantum numbers for <math>\\left(J_1\\right)^2, \\left(J_2\\right)^2, J^2</math>:\n:<math>j \\in \\left\\{ \\left|j_1 - j_2\\right|, \\left(\\left|j_1 - j_2\\right| + 1\\right), \\ldots, \\left(j_1 + j_2\\right) \\right\\} </math>.\n\nFor an atom or molecule with '''J''' = '''L''' + '''S''', the [[term symbol]] gives the quantum numbers associated with the operators <math>L^2, S^2, J^2</math>.\n\n==Orbital angular momentum in spherical coordinates==\n\nAngular momentum operators usually occur when solving a problem with [[spherical symmetry]] in [[spherical coordinates]].

There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body's centre of rotation revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g. [[radians per second]]. The  [[SI]] unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as ''1/sec''. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol [[omega]] ('''ω''', sometimes '''Ω'''). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.\n\nFor example, a [[Geosynchronous orbit|geostationary]] satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator, or 360 degrees per 24 hours, and has angular velocity ''&omega;'' = 360 / 24 = 15 degrees per hour, or 2&pi; / 24 &asymp; 0.26 radians per hour. If angle is measured in [[radians]], the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, <math>v = r\\omega</math>. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth's center, the satellite's speed through space is thus ''v'' = 42,000 &times; 0.26 &asymp; 11,000 km/hr. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the Earth's rotation (counter-clockwise from above the north pole.)\n\nIn three dimensions, angular velocity is a [[pseudovector]], with its magnitude measuring the rate at which an object rotates or revolves, and its direction pointing perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. The orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the [[right-hand rule]].<ref name= EM1>{{cite book\n  | last =  Hibbeler\n  | first = Russell C.\n  | title = Engineering Mechanics\n  | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n  | year = 2009\n  | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n  | pages = 314, 153\n  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=tOFRjXB-XvMC&pg=PA314&dq=angular+velocity\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 978-0-13-607791-6}}(EM1)</ref>\n\n== Orbital angular velocity of a point particle ==\n\n=== Particle in two dimensions ===\n[[Image:Angular velocity1.svg|right|256 px|thumb|The angular velocity of the particle at ''P'' with respect to the origin ''O'' is determined by the [[perpendicular component]] of the velocity vector '''v'''.]]\n\nIn the simplest case of circular motion at radius <math>r</math>, with position given by the angular displacement <math>\\phi(t)</math> from the x-axis, the orbital angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: <math>\\omega = \\tfrac{d\\phi}{dt}</math>. If <math>\\phi</math> is measured in [[radian]]s, the distance from the x-axis around the circle to the particle is <math>\\ell=r\\phi</math>, and the linear velocity is <math>v(t)=\\tfrac{d\\ell}{dt}=r\\omega(t)</math>, so that <math>\\omega=\\tfrac{v}{r}</math>.  \n\nIn the general case of a particle moving in the plane, the orbital angular velocity is the rate at which the position vector relative to a chosen origin \"sweeps out\" angle. The diagram shows the position vector <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> from the origin <math>O</math> to a particle <math>P</math>, with its [[polar coordinates]] <math>(r, \\phi)</math>. (All variables are functions of time <math>t</math>.) The particle has linear velocity splitting as <math>\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v}_\\|+\\mathbf{v}_\\perp</math>,  with the radial component <math>\\mathbf{v}_\\|</math> parallel to the radius, and the cross-radial (or tangential) component <math>\\mathbf{v}_\\perp</math> perpendicular to the radius. When there is no radial component, the particle moves around the origin in a circle; but when there is no cross-radial component, it moves in a straight line from the origin. Since radial motion leaves the angle unchanged, only the cross-radial component of linear velocity contributes to angular velocity.\n\nThe angular velocity ''ω'' is the rate of change of angular position with respect to time, which can be computed from the cross-radial velocity as:\n\n: <math>\\omega = \\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = \\frac{v_\\perp}{r}.</math>\n\nHere the cross-radial speed <math>v_\\perp</math> is the signed magnitude of <math>\\mathbf{v}_\\perp</math>, positive for counter-clockwise motion, negative for clockwise. Taking polar coordinates for the linear velocity <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> gives magnitude <math>v</math> (linear speed) and angle <math>\\theta</math> relative to the radius vector; in these terms, <math>v_\\perp = v\\sin(\\theta)</math>, so that \n\n: <math>\\omega = \\frac{v\\sin(\\theta)}{r}.</math>\n\nThese formulas may be derived from <math>\\mathbf{r}=(x(t),y(t))</math>, <math>\\mathbf{v}=(x'(t),y'(t))</math> and <math>\\phi = \\arctan(y(t)/x(t))</math>, together with the projection formula <math>v_\\perp = \\tfrac{\\mathbf{r}^\\perp\\!\\!}{r}\\cdot \\mathbf{v}</math>, where <math>\\mathbf{r}^\\perp = (-y,x)</math>.\n\nIn two dimensions, angular velocity is a number with plus or minus sign indicating orientation, but not pointing in a direction. The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity then may be termed a [[pseudoscalar]], a numerical quantity which changes sign under a [[parity (physics)|parity inversion]], such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.\n\n=== Particle in three dimensions ===\n[[Image:Angular velocity.svg|thumb|250px|The orbital angular velocity vector encodes the time rate of change of angular position, as well as the instantaneous plane of angular displacement. In this case (counter-clockwise circular motion) the vector points up.]]\n\nIn  [[three-dimensional space]], we again have the position vector '''r''' of a moving particle. Here, orbital angular velocity is a [[pseudovector]] whose magnitude is the rate at which '''r''' sweeps out angle, and whose direction is perpendicular to the instantaneous plane in which '''r''' sweeps out angle (i.e. the plane spanned by '''r''' and '''v'''). However, as there are ''two'' directions perpendicular to any plane, an additional condition is necessary to uniquely specify the direction of the angular velocity; conventionally, the [[right-hand rule]] is used.\n\nLet the pseudovector <math>\\mathbf{u}</math> be the unit vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by '''r''' and '''v''', so that the right-hand rule is satisfied (i.e. the instantaneous direction of angular displacement is counter-clockwise looking from the top of <math>\\mathbf{u}</math>). Taking polar coordinates <math>(r,\\phi)</math> in this plane, as in the two-dimensional case above, one may define the orbital angular velocity vector as: \n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega =\\omega \\mathbf u = \\tfrac{d\\phi}{dt}\\mathbf u=\\frac{v \\sin(\\theta)}{r}\\mathbf u,</math> \n\nwhere ''&theta;'' is the angle between '''r''' and '''v'''. In terms of the cross product, this is:\n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega\n=\\frac{\\mathbf r\\times\\mathbf v}{r^2}.</math>\n\nFrom the above equation, one can recover the tangential velocity as:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}_{\\perp} =\\boldsymbol{\\omega} \\times\\mathbf{r}</math>\n\n==== Addition of angular velocity vectors ====\n[[image:gimbaleuler.svg|thumb|Schematic construction for addition of angular velocity vectors for rotating frames]]\n\nIf a point rotates with orbital angular velocity <math>\\omega_1</math> about its center of rotation in a [[Frame of a vector space|coordinate frame]] <math>F_1</math> which itself rotates with a spin angular velocity <math>\\omega_2</math> with respect to an external frame <math>F_2</math>, we can define <math>\\omega_1 + \\omega_2</math> to be the composite orbital angular velocity vector of the point about its center of rotation with respect to <math>F_2</math>. This operation coincides with usual addition of vectors, and it gives angular velocity the algebraic structure of a true [[Vector space#Definition|vector]], rather than just a pseudo-vector.\n\nThe only non-obvious property of the above addition is [[Commutative property|commutativity]]. This can be proven from the fact that the velocity tensor ''W'' (see below) is skew-symmetric, so that <math>R=e^{Wt}</math> is a rotation matrix which can be expanded as <math>R = I + W\\cdot dt + \\tfrac 12 (W \\cdot dt)^2 + \\ldots</math>. The composition of rotations is not commutative, but <math>(I+W_1\\cdot dt)(I+W_2 \\cdot dt)=(I+W_2 \\cdot dt)(I+W_1\\cdot dt)</math> is commutative to first order, and therefore <math>\\omega_1 + \\omega_2 = \\omega_2 + \\omega_1</math>.\n\nNotice that this also defines the substraction as the addition of a negative vector.\n\n== Spin angular velocity vector for a frame ==\n\nGiven a rotating frame of three unit coordinate vectors, all the three must have the same angular speed at each instant. In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.\n\nThe rotating frame appears in the context of [[rigid body|rigid bodies]], and special tools have been developed for it: the spin angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a [[Tensor|tensor]]. \n\nConsistent with the general definition, the spin angular velocity of a frame is defined as the orbital angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all) with respect to its own centre of rotation. The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a [[gimbal]]. Components of the vector can be calculated as derivatives of the parameters defining the moving frames (Euler angles or rotation matrices). As in the general case, addition is commutative: <math>\\omega_1 + \\omega_2 = \\omega_2 + \\omega_1</math>.\n\nBy [[Euler's rotation theorem]], any rotating frame possesses an [[instantaneous axis of rotation]], which is the direction of the angular velocity vector, and the magnitude of the angular velocity is consistent with the two-dimensional case.\n\n=== Components from the vectors of the frame ===\n\nConsidering a coordinate vector of the frame as a particle, <math>\\mathbf{r}=\\mathbf{e}_i</math> with <math>|\\mathbf{e}_i|=1</math>, we obtain the orbital angular velocity vector:\n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega=\\frac{\\mathbf{r}\\times\\mathbf{v}}{r^2}\n= \\mathbf{e}_1\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_1 =\\mathbf{e}_2\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_2 = \\mathbf{e}_3\\times\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_3.</math>\n\nHere <math>\\mathbf{e}_i</math> are the columns of the matrix of the frame, and  <math>\\dot{\\mathbf{e}}_i</math> their time derivatives.\n\n=== Components from Euler angles ===\n\n[[Image:Eulerframe.svg|thumb|Diagram showing Euler frame in green]]\n\nThe components of the spin angular velocity pseudovector were first calculated by [[Leonhard Euler]] using his [[Euler angles]] and the use of an intermediate frame:\n* One axis of the reference frame (the precession axis)\n* The line of nodes of the moving frame with respect to the reference frame (nutation axis)\n* One axis of the moving frame (the intrinsic rotation axis)\n\nEuler proved that the projections of the angular velocity pseudovector on each of these three axes is the derivative of its associated angle (which is equivalent to decomposing the instantaneous rotation into three instantaneous [[Euler rotations]]). Therefore:<ref>[http://www.vti.mod.gov.rs/ntp/rad2007/3-07/hedr/hedr.pdf K.S.HEDRIH: Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) and rigid body dynamics]</ref>\n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega = \\dot\\alpha\\mathbf u_1+\\dot\\beta\\mathbf u_2+\\dot\\gamma \\mathbf u_3</math>\n\nThis basis is not orthonormal and it is difficult to use, but now the velocity vector can be changed to the fixed frame or to the moving frame with just a change of bases. For example, changing to the mobile frame:\n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega = (\\dot\\alpha\\sin\\beta\\sin\\gamma+\\dot\\beta\\cos\\gamma)\\mathbf i+(\\dot\\alpha\\sin\\beta\\cos\\gamma-\\dot\\beta\\sin\\gamma)\\mathbf j +(\\dot\\alpha\\cos\\beta+\\dot\\gamma)\\mathbf k</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf i,\\mathbf j,\\mathbf k</math> are unit vectors for the frame fixed in the moving body.

For <math>A=A(t)</math> a frame matrix, taking the time derivative of the equation gives:\n\n: <math>0=\\frac{dA}{dt}A^\\text{T}+A\\frac{dA^\\text{T}}{dt}</math>\n\nApplying the formula <math>(A B)^\\text{T}=B^\\text{T}A^\\text{T}</math>,\n\n: <math>0 = \\frac{dA}{dt}A^\\text{T}+\\left(\\frac{dA}{dt} A^\\text{T}\\right)^\\text{T} = W + W^\\text{T}</math>\n\nThus, ''W'' is the negative of its transpose, which implies it is skew symmetric.\n\n=== Coordinate-free description ===\nAt any instant <math>t</math>, the angular velocity tensor represents a linear map between the position vector <math>\\mathbf{r}(t)</math> and the velocity vectors <math>\\mathbf{v}(t)</math> of a point on a rigid body rotating around the origin:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v} = W\\mathbf{r} .</math>\n\nThe relation between this linear map and the angular velocity [[pseudovector]] <math>\\omega</math> is the following.\n\nBecause ''W'' is the derivative of an [[orthogonal transformation]], the bilinear form\n\n: <math>B(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{s}) = (W\\mathbf{r}) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} </math>\n\nis [[Bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]]. Thus we can apply the fact of [[exterior algebra]] that there is a unique [[linear form]] <math>L</math> on <math>\\Lambda^2 V </math> that\n\n: <math>L(\\mathbf{r}\\wedge \\mathbf{s}) = B(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{s})</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{r}\\wedge \\mathbf{s} \\in \\Lambda^2 V </math> is the [[exterior product]] of <math>\\mathbf{r}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{s}</math>.\n\nTaking the [[Musical isomorphism|sharp]] ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}} of ''L'' we get\n\n: <math> (W\\mathbf{r})\\cdot \\mathbf{s} = L^\\sharp \\cdot (\\mathbf{r}\\wedge \\mathbf{s}) </math>\n\nIntroducing <math> \\omega := {\\star} (L^\\sharp) </math>, as the [[Hodge dual]] of ''L''{{sup|{{music|sharp}}}}, and applying the definition of the Hodge dual twice supposing that the preferred unit 3-vector is <math> \\star 1</math>\n\n: <math> (W\\mathbf{r}) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = {\\star} ( {\\star} ( L^\\sharp ) \\wedge \\mathbf{r} \\wedge \\mathbf{s}) = {\\star} (\\omega \\wedge \\mathbf{r} \\wedge \\mathbf{s}) = {\\star} ( \\omega \\wedge \\mathbf{r} ) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = ( \\omega \\times \\mathbf{r} ) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} ,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>\\omega \\times \\mathbf{r} := {\\star} (\\omega \\wedge \\mathbf{r}) </math>\n\nby definition.\n\nBecause <math>\\mathbf{s}</math> is an arbitrary vector, from nondegeneracy of [[scalar product]] follows\n\n: <math> W\\mathbf{r} = \\omega \\times \\mathbf{r}</math>\n\n=== Angular velocity as a vector field ===\nSince the spin angular velocity tensor of a rigid body (in its rest frame) is a linear transformation that maps positions to velocities (within the rigid body), it can be regarded as a constant [[vector field]]. In particular, the spin angular velocity is a [[Killing vector field]] belonging to an element of the [[Lie algebra]] SO(3) of the 3-dimensional [[rotation group SO(3)]]. Also, it can be shown that the spin angular velocity vector field is exactly half of the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the linear velocity vector field '''v'''('''r''') of the rigid body.\n\n== Rigid body considerations ==\n{{see also|axes conventions}}\n\n[[Image:AngularVelocity02.svg|right|320 px|thumb|Position of point P located in the rigid body (shown in blue). '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the position with respect to the lab frame, centered at ''O'' and '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the position with respect to the rigid body frame, centered at {{′|''O''}}. The origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position '''R''' from the lab frame.]]\n\nThe same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating [[rigid body]]. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity ''V''(''t'') in each instant.\n\nTo obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed \"laboratory\" system.\n\nAs shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point ''O'', the rigid body system origin is at {{′|''O''}} and the vector from ''O'' to {{′|''O''}} is '''R'''. A particle (''i'') in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is '''R'''<sub>''i''</sub> in the lab frame, and at position '''r'''<sub>''i''</sub> in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{R}_i=\\mathbf{R}+\\mathbf{r}_i</math>\n\nThe defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector <math>\\mathbf{r}_i</math> is unchanging. By [[Euler's rotation theorem]], we may replace the vector <math>\\mathbf{r}_i</math> with <math>\\mathcal{R}\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math> where <math>\\mathcal{R}</math> is a 3×3 [[rotation matrix]] and <math>\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math> is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say {{nowrap|1=''t'' = 0}}. This replacement is useful, because now it is only the rotation matrix <math>\\mathcal{R}</math> that is changing in time and not the reference vector <math>\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math>, as the rigid body rotates about point {{′|''O''}}. Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three [[versor]]s of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector <math>\\mathbf{r}_i</math> would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it). The position of the particle is now written as:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{R}_i=\\mathbf{R}+\\mathcal{R}\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math>\n\nTaking the time derivative yields the velocity of the particle:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i=\\mathbf{V}+\\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dt}\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math>\n\nwhere '''V'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the velocity of the particle (in the lab frame) and '''V''' is the velocity of {{′|''O''}} (the origin of the rigid body frame). Since <math>\\mathcal{R}</math> is a rotation matrix its inverse is its transpose. So we substitute <math>\\mathcal{I}=\\mathcal{R}^\\text{T}\\mathcal{R}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\mathbf{V}+\\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dt}\\mathcal{I}\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\mathbf{V}+\\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dt}\\mathcal{R}^\\text{T}\\mathcal{R}\\mathbf{r}_{io}</math>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\mathbf{V}+\\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dt}\\mathcal{R}^\\text{T}\\mathbf{r}_{i}</math>\n\nor\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i = \\mathbf{V}+W\\mathbf{r}_{i}</math>\n\nwhere <math>W = \\frac{d\\mathcal{R}}{dt}\\mathcal{R}^\\text{T}</math> is the previous [[angular velocity tensor]].\n\nIt can be [[#W is skew-symmetric|proved]] that this is a [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew symmetric matrix]], so we can take its [[dual space|dual]] to get a 3 dimensional pseudovector that is precisely the previous angular velocity vector <math>\\vec \\omega</math>:\n\n: <math>\\boldsymbol\\omega=[\\omega_x,\\omega_y,\\omega_z]</math>\n\nSubstituting ''ω'' for ''W'' into the above velocity expression, and replacing matrix multiplication by an equivalent cross product:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{V}_i=\\mathbf{V}+\\boldsymbol\\omega\\times\\mathbf{r}_i</math>\n\nIt can be seen that the velocity of a point in a rigid body can be divided into two terms – the velocity of a reference point fixed in the rigid body plus the cross product term involving the orbital angular velocity of the particle with respect to the reference point. This angular velocity is what physicists call the \"spin angular velocity\" of the rigid body, as opposed to the ''orbital'' angular velocity of the reference point {{′|''O''}} about the origin ''O''.\n\n=== Consistency ===\nWe have supposed that the rigid body rotates around an arbitrary point. We should prove that the spin angular velocity previously defined is independent of the choice of origin, which means that the spin angular velocity is an intrinsic property of the spinning rigid body. (Note the marked contrast of this with the ''orbital'' angular velocity of a point particle, which certainly ''does'' depend on the choice of origin.)\n\n[[image:AngularVelocity03.svg|right|320 px| thumb| Proving the independence of spin angular velocity from choice of origin]]\n\nSee the graph to the right: The origin of lab frame is ''O'', while ''O''<sub>1</sub> and ''O''<sub>2</sub> are two fixed points on the rigid body, whose velocity is <math>\\mathbf{v}_1</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}_2</math> respectively. Suppose the angular velocity with respect to ''O''<sub>1</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> is <math>\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1</math> and <math>\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2</math> respectively. Since point ''P'' and ''O''<sub>2</sub> have only one velocity,\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1\\times\\mathbf{r}_1 = \\mathbf{v}_2 + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2\\times\\mathbf{r}_2 </math>\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v}_2 = \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1\\times\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{v}_1 + \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1\\times (\\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2) </math>\n\nThe above two yields that\n\n: <math> (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1-\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2) \\times \\mathbf{r}_2=0 </math>\n\nSince the point ''P'' (and thus <math> \\mathbf{r}_2 </math>) is arbitrary, it follows that\n\n: <math> \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_1 = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_2 </math>\n\nIf the reference point is the [[instantaneous axis of rotation]] the expression of the velocity of a point in the rigid body will have just the angular velocity term. This is because the velocity of the instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of the instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Angular acceleration]]\n* [[Angular frequency]]\n* [[Angular momentum]]\n* [[Areal velocity]]\n* [[Isometry]]\n* [[Orthogonal group]]\n* [[Rigid body dynamics]]\n* [[Vorticity]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{note_label|Symon1971||}}{{cite book|last=Symon | first=Keith |title=Mechanics|publisher=Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA|year=1971|isbn = 978-0-201-07392-8 }}\n* {{note_label|LL||}}{{cite book |last=Landau |first=L.D. |authorlink=Lev Landau |author2=[[Evgeny Lifshitz|Lifshitz, E.M.]] |title= Mechanics|year=1997 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0-7506-2896-9 }}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Angular velocity}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=QBc5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA88 A college text-book of physics] By Arthur Lalanne Kimball (''Angular Velocity of a particle'')\n* {{cite web|last=Pickering|first=Steve|title=ω Speed of Rotation [Angular Velocity]|url=http://www.sixtysymbols.com/videos/angularvelocity.htm|work=Sixty Symbols|publisher=[[Brady Haran]] for the [[University of Nottingham]]|year=2009}}\n\n{{Classical mechanics derived SI units}}\n\n[[Category:Angle]]\n[[Category:Physical quantities]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Tensors]]\n[[Category:Velocity]]"

The [[principal quantum number]] (''n'') is at the right of each row and the azimuthal quantum number (''ℓ'') is denoted by letter at top of each column.]]\n{{quantum mechanics}}\n\nThe '''azimuthal quantum number''' is a [[quantum number]] for an [[atomic orbital]] that determines its [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] and describes the shape of the orbital.  The [[azimuthal]] quantum number is the second of a set of quantum numbers which describe the unique [[quantum state]] of an electron (the others being the [[principal quantum number]] [following [[spectroscopic notation]]], the [[magnetic quantum number]], and the [[spin quantum number]]).  It is also known as the '''orbital angular momentum''' quantum number, '''orbital quantum number''' or '''second quantum number''', and is symbolized as '''ℓ''' (pronounced ''ell'').\n\n== Derivation ==\nConnected with the energy states of the atom's electrons are four quantum numbers: ''n'', ''ℓ'', ''m''<sub>''ℓ''</sub>, and ''m''<sub>''s''</sub>. These specify the complete, unique [[quantum state]] of a single electron in an atom, and make up its [[wavefunction]] or [[atomic orbital|orbital]]. The wavefunction of the [[Schrödinger equation]] reduces to three equations that when solved, lead to the first three quantum numbers. Therefore, the equations for the first three quantum numbers are all interrelated. The azimuthal quantum number arose in the solution of the polar part of the wave equation as shown below, reliant on the [[spherical coordinate system]] as opposed to the [[Cartesian coordinate system]]. Generally, the spherical coordinate system works best with spherical models, the [[cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical system]] with cylinders, the cartesian with general volumes, etc.\n\n[[File:Vector model of orbital angular momentum.svg|250px|left|thumb|Illustration of quantum mechanical orbital angular momentum.]]\n\nAn atomic electron's [[angular momentum operator|angular momentum]], ''L'', is related to its quantum number ''ℓ'' by the following equation:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{L}^2\\Psi = \\hbar^2{\\ell(\\ell+1)}\\Psi</math>\n\nwhere ''ħ'' is the [[reduced Planck's constant]], '''L'''<sup>2</sup> is the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum operator]] and <math>\\Psi</math> is the wavefunction of the electron. The quantum number ''ℓ'' is always a non-negative integer: 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. While many introductory textbooks on quantum mechanics will refer to '''L''' by itself, '''L''' has no real meaning except in its use as the [[angular momentum operator]]. When referring to angular momentum, it is better to simply use the quantum number ''ℓ''.\n\nAtomic orbitals have distinctive shapes denoted by letters. In the illustration, the letters '''s''', '''p''', and '''d''' (a [[Spectroscopic_notation|convention originating in spectroscopy]]) describe the shape of the [[atomic orbital]].\n\nTheir [[wavefunctions]] take the form of [[spherical harmonic]]s, and so are described by [[associated Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomials]]. The various orbitals relating to different values of ''ℓ'' are sometimes called '''sub-shells''', and (mainly for historical reasons) are referred to by letters, as follows:\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 125%;\"| Quantum Subshells for the Azimuthal Quantum Number\n|-\n! style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom;\"| Azimuthal<br/>number&nbsp;(''ℓ'')\n! style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom;\"| Historical<br/>Letter\n! style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom;\"| Maximum<br/>Electrons\n! style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: bottom;\"| Historical<br/>Name\n! style=\"text-align: left;   vertical-align: bottom;\"| Shape\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 0 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''s''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 2\n| '''s'''harp || [[sphere|'''s'''pherical]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 1 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''p''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 6 \n| '''p'''rincipal \n| three [[atomic orbital|dumbbell-shaped]] '''p'''olar-aligned orbitals; one lobe on each '''p'''ole of the x, y, and z (+ and &minus; axes); two electrons each lobe.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 2 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''d''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 \n| '''d'''iffuse || nine '''d'''umbbells and one '''d'''oughnut (or “unique shape #1” see [[:File:Spherical Harmonics.png|this picture of spherical harmonics, third row center]])\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 3 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''f''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 14 \n| '''f'''undamental || “unique shape #2” (see [[:File:Spherical Harmonics.png|this picture of spherical harmonics, bottom row center]])\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 4 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''g''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 18 \n|   ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 5 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''h''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 22 \n|   ||\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 6 \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| '''i''' \n| style=\"text-align: center;\"| 26 \n|   ||\n|-\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: left; text-align: center;\" | The letters after the '''f''' sub-shell just follow letter&nbsp;''f'' in alphabetical order except the letter&nbsp;''j'' and those already used.\n|}\n\nEach of the different angular momentum states can take 2(2''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) electrons. This is because the third quantum number ''m''<sub>ℓ</sub> (which can be thought of loosely as the [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] projection of the angular momentum vector on the z-axis) runs from &minus;''ℓ'' to ''ℓ'' in integer units, and so there are 2''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 possible states. Each distinct ''n'',&thinsp;''ℓ'',&thinsp;''m''<sub>ℓ</sub> orbital can be occupied by two electrons with opposing spins (given by the quantum number ''m''<sub>s</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;±½), giving 2(2''ℓ''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) electrons overall. Orbitals with higher ''ℓ'' than given in the table are perfectly permissible, but these values cover all atoms so far discovered.\n\nFor a given value of the [[principal quantum number]] ''n'', the possible values of ''ℓ'' range from 0 to ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1; therefore, the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 shell only possesses an s subshell and can only take 2&nbsp;electrons, the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 shell possesses an '''s''' and a '''p''' subshell and can take 8&nbsp;electrons overall, the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 shell possesses '''s''', '''p''', and '''d''' subshells and has a maximum of 18&nbsp;electrons, and so on. Generally speaking, the maximum number of electrons in the ''n''th energy level is 2''n''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe angular momentum quantum number, ''ℓ'', governs the number of planar nodes going through the nucleus. A planar node can be described in an electromagnetic wave as the midpoint between crest and trough, which has zero magnitude. In an s orbital, no nodes go through the nucleus, therefore the corresponding azimuthal quantum number ''ℓ'' takes the value of 0. In a '''p''' orbital, one node traverses the nucleus and therefore ''ℓ'' has the value of 1. <math>L</math> has the value <math>\\sqrt{2}\\hbar</math>.\n\nDepending on the value of ''n'', there is an angular momentum quantum number ''ℓ'' and the following series. The wavelengths listed are for a [[hydrogen atom]]: \n:<math>n = 1, L = 0</math>, [[Lyman series]] (ultraviolet)\n:<math>n = 2, L = \\sqrt{2}\\hbar</math>, [[Balmer series]] (visible)\n:<math>n = 3, L = \\sqrt{6}\\hbar</math>, [[Paschen series|Ritz-Paschen series]] ([[near infrared]])\n:<math>n = 4, L = 2\\sqrt{3}\\hbar</math>, [[Brackett series]] ([[infrared#Commonly used sub-division scheme|short-wavelength infrared]])\n:<math>n = 5, L = 2\\sqrt{5}\\hbar</math>, [[Pfund series]] ([[infrared#Commonly used sub-division scheme|mid-wavelength infrared]]).\n\n== Addition of quantized angular momenta ==\n{{details|Angular momentum coupling}}\nGiven a quantized total angular momentum <math>\\vec{\\jmath}</math> which is the sum of two individual quantized angular momenta <math>\\vec{\\ell_1}</math> and <math>\\vec{\\ell_2}</math>,\n\n:<math>\\vec{\\jmath} = \\vec{\\ell_1} + \\vec{\\ell_2}</math>\n\nthe [[quantum number]] <math>j</math> associated with its magnitude can range from <math>|\\ell_1 - \\ell_2|</math> to <math>\\ell_1 + \\ell_2</math> in integer steps\nwhere <math>\\ell_1</math> and <math>\\ell_2</math> are quantum numbers corresponding to the magnitudes of the individual angular momenta.\n\n=== Total angular momentum of an electron in the atom ===\n[[File:LS coupling.svg|250px|thumb|\"Vector cones\" of total angular momentum '''J''' (purple), orbital '''L''' (blue), and spin '''S''' (green). The cones arise due to [[quantum uncertainty]] between measuring angular momentum components (see [[vector model of the atom]].]]\n\nDue to the [[spin-orbit interaction]] in the atom, the orbital angular momentum no longer [[Commutativity|commutes]] with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], nor does the [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. These therefore change over time. However the [[total angular momentum]] '''J''' does [[Commutativity|commute]] with the Hamiltonian and so is constant. '''J''' is defined through\n:<math>\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}</math>\n'''L''' being the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] and '''S''' the spin.

The former quantum numbers can be related to the latter.\n\nFurthermore, the [[eigenvector]]s of ''j'', ''s'', ''m''<sub>''j''</sub> and parity, which are also [[eigenvector]]s of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], are linear combinations of the [[eigenvector]]s of ''ℓ'', ''s'', ''m''<sub>''ℓ''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''s''</sub>.\n\n== List of angular momentum quantum numbers ==\n* Intrinsic (or spin) angular momentum quantum number, or simply [[spin quantum number]]\n* orbital angular momentum quantum number (the subject of this article)\n* [[magnetic quantum number]], related to the orbital momentum quantum number\n* [[total angular momentum quantum number]]\n\n== History ==\nThe [[azimuthal]] quantum number was carried over from the [[Bohr atom|Bohr model of the atom]], and was posited by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Eisberg|first=Robert|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|year=1974|publisher=John Wiley & Sons Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-23464-7|pages=114–117}}</ref> The Bohr model was derived from [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic analysis]] of the atom in combination with the [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]] atomic model.

So the whole phrase would mean \"the flow of time\".\n\n==Modern usage==\n[[File:Tedo Zibzibadze 2011.jpg|thumb|Georgian rugby player with Borjgali on his shorts and shirt]]\nNowadays, the symbol is used in Georgian IDs and passports, as well as on [[Georgian lari|currency]] and by the [[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgian Rugby Union]]. Georgian rugby team players are called ბორჯღალოსნები (''borjgalosnebi''), which means \"Men bearing Borjgali\".

Therefore, knowing the radius of the sphere, and the distance from the plane of the small circle to C, the radius of the small circle can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem.]]\nA '''circle of a sphere''' is a circle that lies on a [[sphere]]. Such a circle can be formed as the intersection of a [[sphere]] and a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], or of two spheres. A circle on a sphere whose plane passes through the center of the sphere is called a [[great circle]]; otherwise it is a '''small circle'''. Circles of a sphere have radius less than or equal to the sphere radius, with equality when the circle is a great circle.\n\n==On the earth==\nIn the [[geographic coordinate system]] on a globe, the parallels of [[latitude]] are small circles, with the [[Equator]] the only great circle. By contrast, all meridians of [[longitude]], paired with their opposite meridian in the other [[hemisphere of the Earth|hemisphere]], form great circles.\n\n==Related terminology==\nThe diameter of the sphere which passes through the center of the circle is called its '''axis''' and the endpoints of this diameter are called its '''poles'''. A '''circle of a sphere''' can also be defined as the set of points at a given [[angular distance]] from a given pole.\n\n==Sphere-plane intersection==\nWhen the intersection of a sphere and a plane is not empty or a single point, it is a circle. This can be seen as follows:\n\nLet ''S'' be a sphere with center ''O'', ''P'' a plane which intersects ''S''. Draw {{overline|''OE''}} perpendicular to ''P'' and meeting ''P'' at ''E''. Let ''A'' and ''B'' be any two different points in the intersection. Then ''AOE'' and ''BOE'' are right triangles with a common side, ''OE'', and hypotenuses ''AO'' and ''BO'' equal. Therefore, the remaining sides ''AE'' and ''BE'' are equal. This proves that all points in the intersection are the same distance from the point ''E'' in the plane ''P'', in other words all points in the intersection lie on a circle ''C'' with center ''E''.<ref>Proof follows Hobbs, Prop. 304</ref> This proves that the intersection of ''P'' and ''S'' is contained in ''C''. Note that ''OE'' is the axis of the circle.\n\nNow consider a point ''D'' of the circle ''C''. Since ''C'' lies in ''P'', so does ''D''. On the other hand, the triangles ''AOE'' and ''DOE'' are right triangles with a common side, ''OE'', and legs ''EA'' and ''ED'' equal. Therefore, the hypotenuses ''AO'' and ''DO'' are equal, and equal to the radius of ''S'', so that ''D'' lies in ''S''. This proves that ''C'' is contained in the intersection of ''P'' and ''S''.\n\nAs a corollary, on a sphere there is exactly one circle that can be drawn through three given points.<ref>Hobbs, Prop. 308</ref>\n\nThe proof can be extended to show that the points on a circle are all a common angular distance from one of its poles.<ref>Hobbs, Prop. 310</ref>\n\n==Sphere-sphere intersection==\nTo show that a non-trivial intersection of two spheres is a circle, assume (without loss of generality) that one sphere (with radius <math>R</math>) is centered at the origin. Points on this sphere satisfy\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = R^2.</math>\nAlso without loss of generality, assume that the second sphere, with radius <math>r</math>, is centered at a point on the positive x-axis, at distance <math>a</math> from the origin. Its points satisfy\n:<math>(x-a)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2.</math>\nThe intersection of the spheres is the set of points satisfying both equations. Subtracting the equations gives\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n(x-a)^2 - x^2 & = r^2 - R^2 \\\\\n    a^2 - 2ax & = r^2 - R^2 \\\\\n            x & = \\frac{a^2 + R^2 - r^2}{2a}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nIn the singular case <math>a = 0</math>, the spheres are concentric. There are two possibilities: if <math>R = r</math>, the spheres coincide, and the intersection is the entire sphere; if <math>R \\not= r</math>, the spheres are disjoint and the intersection is empty.\nWhen ''a'' is nonzero, the intersection lies in a vertical plane with this x-coordinate, which may intersect both of the spheres, be tangent to both spheres, or external to both spheres.\nThe result follows from the previous proof for sphere-plane intersections.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Line-plane intersection]]\n*[[Line–sphere intersection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book |title=Solid Geometry|first=C.A.|last=Hobbs|publisher=G.H.

      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Spin multiplicity diagram.svg|thumb|Examples of atoms in [[singlet state|singlet]], '''doublet''', and [[triplet state|triplet]] states.]]\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], a '''doublet''' is a [[mixed quantum state]] of a system with a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1/2, such that there are two allowed values of the spin component, −1/2 and +1/2. Quantum systems with two possible states are sometimes called [[two-level system]]s. Essentially all occurrences of doublets in nature arise from [[rotational symmetry]]; spin 1/2 is associated with the [[fundamental representation]] of the [[Lie group]] [[SU(2)]], the [[group theory|group]] that defines rotational symmetry in three-dimensional space.\n\n==History and applications==\nThe term \"doublet\" dates back to the 19th century, when it was observed that certain [[spectral lines]] of an ionized, excited gas would split into two under the influence of a strong [[magnetic field]], in an effect known as the [[anomalous Zeeman effect]]. Such spectral lines were observed not only in the laboratory, but also in astronomical [[spectroscopy]] observations, allowing astronomers to deduce the existence of, and measure the strength of magnetic fields around the sun, stars and galaxies. Conversely, it was the observation of doublets in spectroscopy that allowed physicists to deduce that the [[electron]] had a spin, and that furthermore, the magnitude of the spin had to be 1/2. See the history section of the article on [[spin (physics)]] for greater detail. \n\nDoublets continue to play an important role in physics. For example, the [[healthcare]] technology of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] is based on [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]. In this technology, a spectroscopic doublet occurs in a spin-1/2 [[atomic nucleus]], whose doublet splitting is in the radio-frequency range. By applying both a magnetic field and carefully tuning a radio-frequency transmitter, the nuclear spins will flip and re-emit radiation, in an effect known as the [[Rabi cycle]]. The strength and frequency of the emitted radio waves allows the concentration of such nuclei to be measured.\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{GoldBookRef |title=doublet state |file=D01853.html }}\n{{refend}} \n\n==See also==\n* [[Singlet state]]\n* [[Triplet state]]\n* [[Spin multiplicity]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Doublet State}}\n[[Category:Spectroscopy]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Quantum states]]"

Since there are no true regular continuous hexagrams, the term is instead used to refer to the compound figure of two [[equilateral triangle]]s shown to the right. The intersection is a regular [[hexagon]].\n\nThe hexagram is part of an infinite series of shapes which are compounds of two n-dimensional [[simplex|simplices]]. In three dimensions, [[Compound of two tetrahedra|the analogous compound]] is the [[stellated octahedron]], and in four dimensions the [[compound of two 5-cells]] is obtained.\n\nIt has been historically used in religious and cultural contexts and as decorative motifs; for example by medieval [[Muslims]], especially [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] dynasties,<ref>''[[Delhi: Adventures in a Megacity]]'' (PB) - Page 91, Sam Miller, Sam - 2010</ref> and later in [[Judaism]] and [[occultism]]. The symbol was used merely as a decorative motif in medieval Christian churches many centuries before its first known use in a Jewish synagogue.{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=244|ps=:\"It is not to be found at all in medieval synagogues or on medieval ceremonial objects, although it has been found in quite a number of medieval Christian churches again, not as a Christian symbol but only as a decorative motif. The appearance of the symbol in Christian churches long before its appearance in our synagogues should warn the overzealous interpreters. \"}} It was first used as a religious symbol by Arabs in the medieval period, known as the [[Seal of Solomon]], depicted as either a hexagram or [[pentagram]], and which was later adopted by Jewish [[Kabbalists]].{{sfn|Scholem|1949|p=246|ps=:\"In the beginning these designs had no special names or terms, and it is only in the Middle Ages that definite names began to be given to some of those most widely used.

This name is obviously related to the Jewish legend of Solomon's dominion over the spirits, and of his ring with the Ineffable Name engraved on it. These legends expanded and proliferated in a marked fashion during the Middle Ages, among Jews and Arabs alike, but the name, \"Seal of Solomon,\" apparently originated with the Arabs.\"}}<ref>Leonora Leet, \"The Hexagram and Hebraic Sacred Science\" in :''The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah'', 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=61hpoogearsC&pg=PA212 pp. 212-217].</ref>\n\n==Group theory==\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[root system]] for the simple [[Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]] is in the form of a hexagram, with six long roots and six short roots.<br/>\n[[File:Root system G2.svg|250px]]\n\n== Construction by compass and a straight edge ==\nA six-pointed star, like a [[regular hexagon]], can be created using a compass and a straight edge:\n*Make a circle of any size with the compass.\n*Without changing the radius of the compass, set its pivot on the circle's circumference, and find one of the two points where a new circle would intersect the first circle.\n*With the pivot on the last point found, similarly find a third point on the circumference, and repeat until six such points have been marked.\n*With a straight edge, join alternate points on the circumference to form two overlapping equilateral triangles.\n\n== Construction by linear algebra ==\n[[File:Hexagram-cube.png|thumb]]\nA regular hexagram can be constructed by [[orthographic projection|orthographically projecting]] any [[cube]] onto a plane through three vertices that are all adjacent to the same vertex.  The twelve midpoints to edges of the cube form a hexagram.  For example, consider the projection of the unit cube with vertices at the eight possible binary vectors in three dimensions <math>(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1),(1,1,0),(1,0,1),(0,1,1),(1,1,1)</math> onto the plane <math>x+y+z=1</math>.  The midpoints are <math>(0,0,1/2),(0,1/2,1/2),(0,1,1/2),(1,1,1/2)</math>, and all points resulting from these by applying a permutation to their entries.  These 12 points project to a hexagram: six vertices around the outer hexagon and six on the inner.\n\n==Origins and shape==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2009}}\nIt is possible that as a simple geometric shape, like for example the triangle, circle, or square, the hexagram has been created by various peoples with no connection to one another.\n\nThe hexagram is a [[mandala]] symbol called ''satkona yantra'' or ''sadkona yantra'' found on ancient South [[India]]n [[Hindu]] temples. It symbolizes the [[nara-narayana]], or perfect [[meditative]] state of balance achieved between Man and God, and if maintained, results in \"[[moksha]],\" or \"[[nirvana]]\" (release from the bounds of the earthly world and its material trappings).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nSome researchers have theorized that the hexagram represents the [[astrological]] chart at the time of David's birth or [[anointment]] as king. The hexagram is also known as the \"King's Star\" in astrological circles.\n\nIn antique [[papyri]], [[pentagram]]s, together with stars and other signs, are frequently found on [[amulet]]s bearing the Jewish names of [[God]], and used to guard against fever and other diseases. Curiously the hexagram is not found among these signs. In the [[Greek Magical Papyri]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} (Wessely, l.c. pp.&nbsp;31, 112) at Paris and London there are 22 signs side by side, and a circle with twelve signs, but neither a pentagram nor a hexagram.\n\n==Usage in Dharmic religions==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2018}}\n[[File:Jain Cosmology0007small.JPG|thumb|Diagram showing the two mystic syllables Om and Hrim]]\nSix-pointed stars have also been found in cosmological diagrams in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. The reasons behind this symbol's common appearance in Indic religions and the West are unknown. One possibility is that they have a common origin. The other possibility is that artists and religious people from several cultures independently created the hexagram shape, which is a relatively simple geometric design.\n\nWithin Indic lore, the shape is generally understood to consist of two triangles—one pointed up and the other down—locked in harmonious embrace. The two components are called \"Om\" and the \"Hrim\" in Sanskrit, and symbolize man's position between earth and sky. The downward triangle symbolizes [[Shakti]], the sacred embodiment of femininity, and the upward triangle symbolizes [[Shiva]], or [[Agni Tattva]], representing the focused aspects of masculinity. The mystical union of the two triangles represents Creation, occurring through the divine union of male and female. The two locked triangles are also known as 'Shanmukha'—the six-faced, representing the six faces of Shiva & Shakti's progeny [[Kartikeya]]. This symbol is also a part of several yantras and has deep significance in Hindu ritual worship and history.\n\nIn [[Buddhism]], some old versions of the [[Bardo Thodol]], also known as The \"Tibetan Book of the Dead\", contain a hexagram with a [[Swastika]] inside. It was made up by the publishers for this particular publication. In Tibetan, it is called the \"origin of phenomenon\" (chos-kyi 'byung-gnas). It is especially connected with [[Vajrayogini]], and forms the center part of Her [[mandala]]. In reality, it is in three dimensions, not two, although it may be portrayed either way.\n\nThe [[Shatkona]] is a symbol used in [[Hindu]] [[yantra]] that represents the union of both the [[male]] and [[Female|feminine]] form. More specifically it is supposed to represent [[Purusha]] (the supreme being), and [[Prakriti]] (mother nature, or causal matter). Often this is represented as [[Shiva]] - [[Shakti]].<ref>[http://sivasakti.com/articles/intro-yantra.html sivasakti.com: ''Introduction to Yantra'']</ref>\n\nThe Shatkona is a hexagram and looks exactly like the [[Star of David]].\n\n===Anahata: The Heart Chakra===\n{| border=\"0\"\n|width=170 valign=top|[[File:Anahata Mandala.svg|center|170px]]\n|valign=top|'''[[Anahata]]''' (also known as '''Anahata-puri''', or '''Padma-sundara''') is symbolized by a lotus flower with twelve petals. (See also [[bodhicitta|heartmind]]). Anahata is related to the colors green or pink. Key issues involving Anahata involve complex emotions, compassion, tenderness, unconditional love, equilibrium, rejection and well-being. Physically Anahata governs circulation, emotionally it governs unconditional love for the self and others, mentally it governs passion, and spiritually it governs devotion.<ref>The Chakra Bible, Patricia Mercier, Octopus Publishing Group Ltd., 2007, p. 199</ref>\n|-\n|}\nIn the [[endocrine system]], [[Anahata]] is associated with the [[thymus]] gland, located in the chest. This gland produces [[T-cells]], that combat disease, and bring equilibrium to the body. The functioning of the [[thymus]] is greatest before [[puberty]] and is impaired by the appearance of [[sex hormones]] in the blood stream from [[puberty]] onwards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\n==Usage by the Abrahamic religions==\n\n===Usage by Jews===\n{{Main|Star of David}}\n[[File:Leningrad Codex Carpet page e.jpg|thumb|The Star of David in the oldest surviving complete copy of the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Leningrad Codex]], dated 1008.]]\nThe ''Magen David'' is a generally recognized symbol of Judaism and Jewish identity and is also known colloquially as the Jewish Star or \"Star of David.\" Its usage as a sign of Jewish identity began in the Middle Ages, though its religious usage began earlier, with the current earliest archeological evidence being a stone bearing the shield from the arch of a 3–4th century synagogue in the Galilee.<ref>\"King Solomon's Seal\", ''MFA'', [http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/2/King%20Solomon-s%20Seal King Solomon-s Seal]</ref>\n\n===Usage by Christians===\nThe hexagram may be found in some Churches and stained-glass windows. In Christianity it is sometimes called the star of creation.  A very early example, noted by [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], can be found in [[Winchester Cathedral]], England in one of the canopies of the choir stalls, circa 1308.<ref>Buildings of England: Hampshire and the North (now second edition) {{ISBN|978 0 300 12084 4}}, p.604. </ref>\n\nIn Balkan countries, hexagrams can be found more often in Orthodox Christian churches than in Roman Catholic churches.  \n \n====Latter-day Saints (Mormons)====\n[[File:Salt Lake Assembly Hall Star of David.jpg|thumb|Star of David on the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall]]]]\n{{Main|Mormonism and Judaism}}\nThe Star of David is also used less prominently by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the temples and in architecture. It symbolizes God reaching down to man and man reaching up to God, the union of Heaven and earth. It may also symbolize the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]] and friendship and their affinity towards the Jewish people. Additionally, it is sometimes used to symbolize the quorum of the twelve apostles, as in Revelation 12, wherein the Church of God is symbolized by a woman wearing a crown of twelve stars. It is also sometimes used to symbolize the Big Dipper, which points to the North Star, a symbol of Jesus Christ.\n\n====Rastafari====\nA black star of David is used to identify the black population, in Africa or otherwise, with one of the [[Israelite|Tribes of Israel]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\nDue to the culture of Rastafari emerging out of the Judeo-Christian Ethiopian history, dating back to Solomonic dynastic rule, the star of David, or the Seal of Solomon is a prevalent symbol amongst its adherents. Rastafari has adherents from every race across the globe, rooted in Christian doctrine, it is not an African or bloodline doctrine.\n\n===Usage by Muslims===\n<gallery>\nFile:Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover.JPG|Morocco Fez Embroidery Horse Cover\nFile:Gateway-Humayuns-Tomb-104.JPG|Hexagram at [[Humayun's Tomb]], Delhi, India\nFile:Moroccan 4 Falus Coin (AH 1290).jpg|Hexagram on obverse of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] 4 Falus coin (1873)\nFile:PrizrenCollection2 2010 100 3123.JPG|Hexagram on the Minaret of Arasta Mosque, [[Prizren]], Kosovo\nFile:BarbarosSancagi.svg| Hexagram on the flag of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]]\nFile:Qur'an 4475.jpg|Use in a Quran\nFile:Karamanid Dynasty flag.svg|Hexagram on the flag of [[Karamanid]] beylik\n</gallery>\n\nThe symbol is known in Arabic as ''Khātem Sulaymān'' ([[Seal of Solomon]]; {{lang|ar|خاتم سليمان}}) or ''Najmat Dāwūd'' ([[Star of David]]; {{lang|ar|نجمة داوود}}). The \"Seal of Solomon\" may also be represented by a five-pointed star or [[pentagram]].\n\nIn the [[Qur'an]], it is written that David and [[King Solomon]] (Arabic, ''Suliman'' or ''Sulayman'') were prophets and kings, and are figures revered by Muslims. The Medieval pre-Ottoman [[Hanafi]] [[Anatolian beyliks]] of the [[Karamanids]] and [[Jandarids]] used the star on their flag.<ref name=\"Muwahhidists\">The Muslim Empires of the Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals, By Stephen F.

The superposed triangles thus represented combinations of those elements. From Aristotle's writings those symbols made their ways into early, pre-Muslim Arab literature.\n\n==Usage in heraldry==\nIn [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a hexagram is a fairly common charge employed, though it is rarely called by this name. In Germanic regions it is known simply as a \"star.\" In English and French heraldry, however, the hexagram is known as a \"mullet of six points,\" where ''mullet'' is a French term for a [[spur|spur rowel]] which is shown with five pointed arms by default unless otherwise specified. In [[Albania]]n heraldry and vexillology, hexagram has been used since [[classical antiquity]] and it is commonly referred to as ''sixagram''. [[:File:Coa Kastrioti Family.svg|Coa Kastrioti Family]] of the [[House of Kastrioti]] depicts the hexagram on a '''[[pile (heraldry)|pile]]''' argent over the double headed eagle. A hexagram also appears on the '''Dardania''' Flag, proposed for [[Kosovo]] by the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]].\n\n==Usage in theosophy==\nThe Star of David is used in the seal and the emblem of the [[Theosophical Society]] (founded in 1875). Although it is more pronounced, it is used along with other religious symbols. These include the [[Swastika]], the [[Ankh]], the [[Om|Aum]], and the [[Ouroboros]]. The star of David is also known as the Seal of Solomon that was its original name until around 50 years ago.\n\n==Usage in occultism==\nThe hexagram, like the [[pentagram]], was and is used in practices of the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]] and is attributed to the 7 \"old\" planets outlined in [[astrology]].\n\nThe six-pointed star is commonly used both as a [[talisman]]<ref>P299 (and throughout) of ''The Complete Goldendawn'' by Israel Regardie. {{ISBN|978-0875426631}}</ref> and for conjuring spirits and spiritual forces in diverse forms of [[Magic (paranormal)|occult magic]]. In the book [[The History and Practice of Magic, Vol. 2]], the six-pointed star is called the talisman of Saturn and it is also referred to as the Seal of Solomon.<ref>\"The History and Practice of Magic\" (Secaucus, NJ: University Books, published by arrangement with Lyle Stewart, 1979), Vol. II, p. 304</ref> Details are given in this book on how to make these symbols and the materials to use.\n[[File:Star of David GGNC grave marker engraving.JPG|thumb|200x200px|Double hexagram.]]\nTraditionally, the Hexagram can be seen as the combination of the four elements. Fire is symbolized as an upwards pointing triangle, while Air (its elemental opposite) is also an upwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. Water is symbolized as a downwards pointing triangle, while Earth (its elemental opposite) is also a downwards pointing triangle, but with a horizontal line through its center. When you combine the symbols of Fire and Water, a hexagram (six-pointed star) is created. The same follows for when you combine the symbols of Air and Earth.

A [[singlet state]] is a molecular [[electronic state]] such that all [[electron spin]]s are paired.  That is, the spin of the excited electron is still paired with the [[ground state]] electron (a pair of electrons in the same energy level must have opposite spins, per the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]).  In a [[triplet state]] the excited electron is no longer paired with the ground state electron; that is, they are parallel (same spin).  Since excitation to a triplet state involves an additional \"forbidden\" spin transition, it is less probable that a triplet state will form when the molecule absorbs radiation.\n\n[[Image:ISC excited states.png|thumb|300 px|right|Singlet and triplet energy levels.]]\n\nWhen a singlet state nonradiatively passes to a triplet state, or conversely a triplet transitions to a singlet, that process is known as intersystem crossing.  In essence, the spin of the excited electron is reversed.  The probability of this process occurring is more favorable when the vibrational levels of the two excited states overlap, since little or no energy must be gained or lost in the transition.   As the spin/orbital interactions in such molecules are substantial and a change in spin is thus more favourable, intersystem crossing is most common in heavy-atom molecules (e.g. those containing [[iodine]] or [[bromine]]).  This process is called \"[[spin-orbit coupling]]\".   Simply-stated,  it involves coupling of the electron spin with the orbital angular momentum of non-circular orbits.  In addition, the presence of [[paramagnetic]] species in solution enhances intersystem crossing.<ref>Douglas A. Skoog, F. James Holler, and Timothy A. Nieman. ''Principles of Instrumental Analysis'', 5th Ed.  Brooks/Cole, 1998.</ref>\n\nThe radiative decay from an excited triplet state back to a singlet state is known as [[phosphorescence]].  Since a transition in spin multiplicity occurs, phosphorescence is a manifestation of intersystem crossing.  The time scale of intersystem crossing is on the order of 10<sup>−8</sup> to 10<sup>−3</sup> s, one of the slowest forms of relaxation.<ref>Donald A. McQuarrie and John D. Simon.

In most practical problems such as planetary motion, however, the interaction [[potential energy]] between two bodies is not exactly an [[inverse square law]], but may include an additional central force, a so-called ''perturbation'' described by a [[potential energy]] {{math|''h''(''r'')}}.  In such cases, the LRL vector rotates slowly in the plane of the orbit, corresponding to a slow [[apsidal precession]] of the orbit.\n\nBy assumption, the perturbing potential {{math|''h''(''r'')}} is a [[conservation of energy|conservative]] central force, which implies that the total energy {{mvar|E}} and [[angular momentum]] vector '''L''' are conserved.  Thus, the motion still lies in a plane perpendicular to '''L''' and the magnitude {{mvar|A}} is conserved, from the equation {{math|''A''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''m''<sup>2</sup>''k''<sup>2</sup> + 2''mEL''<sup>2</sup>}}.

A conserved quantity is usually associated with such symmetries.<ref name=\"goldstein_1980\" />  For example, every [[central force]] is symmetric under the [[rotation group SO(3)]], leading to the conservation of [[angular momentum]] '''L'''.  Classically, an overall rotation of the system does not affect the energy of an orbit; quantum mechanically, rotations mix the [[spherical harmonic]]s of the same [[quantum number]] ''l'' without changing the energy.\n\n[[File:Kepler hodograph family.png|thumb|right|Figure 7: The family of circular momentum hodographs for a given energy ''E''.  All the circles pass through the same two points <math>\\pm p_0 = \\pm \\sqrt{2m|E|}</math> on the ''p''<sub>''x''</sub> axis (see Figure 3).  This family of hodographs corresponds to one family of [[Apollonian circles]], and the σ isosurfaces of [[bipolar coordinates]].]]\n\nThe symmetry for the inverse-square central force is higher and more subtle.  The peculiar symmetry of the Kepler problem results in the conservation of both the angular momentum vector '''L''' and the LRL vector '''A''' (as defined [[#Mathematical definition|above]]) and, [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanically]], ensures that the energy levels of [[hydrogen]] do not depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers ''l'' and ''m''.  The symmetry is more subtle, however, because the symmetry operation must take place in a [[dimension|higher-dimensional space]]; such symmetries are often called \"hidden symmetries\".<ref name=\"prince_eliezer_1981\" />\n\nClassically, the higher symmetry of the Kepler problem allows for continuous alterations of the orbits that preserve energy but not angular momentum; expressed another way, orbits of the same energy but different angular momentum (eccentricity) can be transformed continuously into one another.  Quantum mechanically, this corresponds to mixing orbitals that differ in the ''l'' and ''m'' [[quantum number]]s, such as the ''s'' ({{nowrap|1=''l'' = 0}}) and ''p'' ({{nowrap|1=''l'' = 1}}) [[atomic orbital]]s.  Such mixing cannot be done with ordinary three-dimensional translations or rotations, but is equivalent to a rotation in a higher dimension.\n\nFor ''negative'' energies – i.e., for bound systems – the higher symmetry group is [[SO(4)]], which preserves the length of four-dimensional vectors\n\n:<math>\n|\\mathbf{e}|^2 = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + e_3^2 + e_4^2.\n</math>\n\nIn 1935, [[Vladimir Fock]] showed that the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] bound Kepler problem is equivalent to the problem of a free particle confined to a three-dimensional [[three-sphere|unit sphere]] in four-dimensional space.<ref name=\"fock_1935\" />  Specifically, Fock showed that the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger]] [[wavefunction]] in the momentum space for the Kepler problem was the [[stereographic projection]] of the [[spherical harmonic]]s on the sphere.  Rotation of the sphere and reprojection results in a continuous mapping of the elliptical orbits without changing the energy; quantum mechanically, this corresponds to a mixing of all orbitals of the same energy quantum number ''n''.  [[Valentine Bargmann]] noted subsequently that the Poisson brackets for the angular momentum vector '''L''' and the scaled LRL vector '''D''' formed the [[Lie algebra]] for SO(4).<ref name=\"bargmann_1936\" /><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 18.9.</ref>  Simply put, the six quantities '''D''' and '''L''' correspond to the six conserved angular momenta in four dimensions, associated with the six possible [[SO(4)|simple rotations]] in that space (there are six ways of choosing two axes from four).  This conclusion does not imply that our [[universe]] is a three-dimensional sphere; it merely means that this particular physics problem (the [[two-body problem]] for inverse-square [[central force]]s) is ''mathematically equivalent'' to a free particle on a three-dimensional sphere.\n\nFor ''positive'' energies –&nbsp;i.e., for unbound, \"scattered\" systems&nbsp;– the higher symmetry group is [[SO(3,1)]], which preserves the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski length]] of [[4-vector]]s\n\n:<math>\nds^2 = e_1^2 + e_2^2 + e_3^2 - e_4^2.\n</math>\n\nBoth the negative- and positive-energy cases were considered by Fock<ref name=\"fock_1935\" /> and Bargmann<ref name=\"bargmann_1936\" /> and have been reviewed encyclopedically by Bander and Itzykson.<ref name=\"bander_itzykson_1966\">{{cite journal | last = Bander | first = M. |author2=Itzykson C.  | date = 1966 | title = Group Theory and the Hydrogen Atom (I) | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 38 | pages = 330–345 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.330 | bibcode=1966RvMP...38..330B}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Bander | first = M. |author2=Itzykson C.  | date = 1966 | title = Group Theory and the Hydrogen Atom (II) | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 38 | pages = 346–358 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.346 | bibcode=1966RvMP...38..346B}}</ref>\n\nThe orbits of [[central force|central-force]] systems&nbsp;– and those of the Kepler problem in particular&nbsp;– are also symmetric under [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]].

This scaled vector '''e''' has the same direction as '''A''' and its magnitude equals the [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of the orbit, and thus vanishes for circular orbits.  \n\nOther scaled versions are also possible, e.g., by dividing '''A''' by ''m'' alone\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{L} - k\\mathbf{\\hat{r}},\n</math>\nor by ''p''<sub>0</sub>\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{D} = \\frac{\\mathbf{A}}{p_{0}} = \n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2m|E|}}\n\\left\\{ \\mathbf{p} \\times \\mathbf{L} - m k \\mathbf{\\hat{r}} \\right\\},\n</math>\nwhich has the same units as the [[angular momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] '''L'''.  \n\nIn rare cases, the sign of the LRL vector may be reversed, i.e., scaled by −1.  Other common symbols for the LRL vector include '''a''', '''R''', '''F''', '''J''' and '''V'''.  However, the choice of scaling and symbol for the LRL vector do not affect its [[constant of motion|conservation]].\n\n[[File:Kepler trivector.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 4: The angular momentum vector '''L''', the LRL vector '''A''' and Hamilton's vector, the binormal '''B''', are mutually perpendicular; '''A''' and '''B''' point along the major and minor axes, respectively, of an elliptical orbit of the Kepler problem.]]\n\nAn alternative conserved vector is the [[binormal]] vector '''B''' studied by [[William Rowan Hamilton]],<ref name=\"hamilton_1847_quaternions\" />\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation =  <math>\n\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{p} - \\left(\\frac{mk}{L^{2}r} \\right) \\  \\left( \\mathbf{L} \\times \\mathbf{r} \\right),\n</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0070BF\n|bgcolor=#FAFFFB}}\nwhich is conserved and points along the ''minor'' semiaxis of the ellipse. (It is not defined for vanishing eccentricity.)\n\nThe LRL vector {{nowrap|1='''A''' = '''B''' × '''L'''}} is the [[cross product]] of '''B''' and '''L''' (Figure 4). On the momentum hodograph in the relevant section above, '''B''' is readily seen to connect the origin of momenta with the center of the circular hodograph, and to possess magnitude ''A/L''. At perihelion, it points in the direction of the momentum.\n\nThe vector '''B''' is denoted as \"binormal\" since it is perpendicular to both '''A''' and '''L'''.  Similar to the LRL vector itself, the binormal vector can be defined with different scalings and symbols.\n\nThe two conserved vectors, '''A''' and '''B''' can be combined to form a conserved [[dyadic tensor]] '''W''',<ref name=\"fradkin_1967\" />\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{W} = \\alpha \\mathbf{A} \\otimes \\mathbf{A} + \\beta \\, \\mathbf{B} \\otimes \\mathbf{B},\n</math>\nwhere ''α'' and ''β'' are arbitrary scaling constants and <math>\\otimes</math> represents the [[tensor product]] (which is not related to the [[cross product|vector cross product]], despite their similar symbol).  Written in explicit components, this equation reads\n:<math>\nW_{ij} = \\alpha A_i A_j + \\beta B_i B_j.\n</math>\n\nBeing perpendicular to each another, the vectors '''A''' and '''B''' can be viewed as the [[principal axis (mechanics)|principal axes]] of the conserved [[tensor]] '''W''', i.e., its scaled [[eigenvector]]s.

Ionized material carried along the field lines will at some point <math> r_c </math> escape the magnetic field lines and thus take away the Sun's angular momentum]]\n'''Magnetic braking''' is a theory explaining the loss of stellar [[angular momentum]] due to material getting captured by the [[stellar magnetic field]] and thrown out at great distance from the surface of the star. It plays an important role in the evolution of [[binary star]] systems.\n\n==The problem==\nThe currently accepted theory of the [[solar systems|solar system's]] evolution states that the Solar System originates from a contracting gas cloud. As the cloud contracts, the [[angular momentum]] <math> L</math> must be [[angular momentum#Conservation of angular momentum|conserved]]. Any small net rotation of the cloud will cause the spin to increase as the cloud collapses, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a [[protostar]] forms, which gains heat from the [[gravitational energy]] of the collapse. As the collapse continues, the rotation rate can increase to the point where the accreting protostar can break up due to [[centrifugal force]] at the equator.\n\nThus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000 years of the star's life to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind. In the case of our own Sun, when the planets' angular momenta are compared to the Sun's own, the Sun has less than 1% of its supposed angular momentum. In other words, the Sun has slowed down its spin while the planets have not.\n\n==The idea behind magnetic braking==\nIonized material captured by the magnetic field lines will rotate with the Sun as if it were a solid body. As material escapes from the Sun due to the [[solar wind]], the highly ionized material will be captured by the field lines and rotate with the same angular velocity as the Sun, even though it is carried far away from the Sun's surface, until it eventually escapes. This effect of carrying mass far from the centre of the Sun and throwing it away slows down the spin of the Sun.<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Ferreira, J.; Pelletier, G.; Appl, S. |title=Reconnection X-winds: spin-down of low-mass protostars |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |year=2000 |volume=312 |issue=2 |pages=387–397 |bibcode=2000MNRAS.312..387F |doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03215.x |citeseerx=10.1.1.30.5409 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Devitt |title=What Puts The Brakes On Madly Spinning Stars? |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/5732 |accessdate=2007-06-27 }}</ref> The same effect is used in slowing the spin of a [[Yo-yo de-spin|rotating satellite]]; here two wires spool out weights to a distance slowing the satellites spin, then the wires are cut, letting the weights escape into space and permanently robbing the spacecraft of its [[angular momentum]].\n\n==Theory behind magnetic braking==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\n{{original research section|date=April 2013}}\nAs ionized material follows the Sun's magnetic field lines, due to the effect of the field lines being frozen in the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], the charged particles feel a force <math> \\mathbf{F} </math> of the magnitude:\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}=q \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B} </math>\nwhere <math>q</math> is the charge, <math>\\mathbf{v}</math> is the velocity and <math>\\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic field vector.

The set is: [[principal quantum number]], [[azimuthal quantum number]], magnetic quantum number, and [[spin quantum number]]. Together, they describe the unique [[quantum state]] of an electron. The magnetic quantum number distinguishes the [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] available within a [[Electron shell|subshell]], and is used to calculate the azimuthal component of the orientation of orbital in space.  Electrons in a particular subshell (such as s, p, d, or f) are defined by values of ''ℓ'' (0, 1, 2, or 3).  The value of ''m<sub>l</sub>'' can range from -''ℓ'' to +''ℓ'', inclusive of zero.  Thus the s, p, d, and f subshells contain 1, 3, 5, and 7 orbitals each, with values of ''m'' within the ranges 0, ±1, ±2, ±3 respectively.  Each of these orbitals can accommodate up to two electrons (with opposite spins), forming the basis of the [[periodic table]].\n\n==Derivation==\n[[File:Atomic orbitals spdf m-eigenstates.png|thumb|These orbitals have magnetic quantum numbers <math>m=-\\ell, \\ldots,\\ell</math> from left to right in ascending order.

The magnetic quantum number <math>m</math> only affects the electron's energy if it is in a magnetic field because in the absence of one, all spherical harmonics corresponding to the different arbitrary values of <math>m</math> are equivalent.  The magnetic quantum number determines the energy shift of an [[atomic orbital]] due to an external magnetic field (the [[Zeeman effect]]) &mdash; hence the name ''magnetic'' quantum number.  However, the actual [[magnetic dipole moment]] of an electron in an atomic orbital arrives not only from the electron angular momentum, but also from the electron spin, expressed in the [[spin quantum number]].\n\nSince each electron has a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, it will be subject to a torque which tends to make the vector <math>\\mathbf{L}</math> parallel to the field, a phenomenon known as [[Larmor precession]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quantum number]]\n** [[Azimuthal quantum number]]\n** [[Principal quantum number]]\n** [[Spin quantum number]]\n** [[Total angular momentum quantum number]]\n* [[Basic quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Bohr atom]]\n* [[Schrödinger equation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{electron configuration navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Atomic physics]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Quantum numbers]]"

Radial functions are contrasted with [[spherical harmonics|spherical functions]], and any decent function (e.g., [[continuous function|continuous]] and [[rapidly decreasing]]) on Euclidean space can be decomposed into a series consisting of radial and spherical parts: the [[solid spherical harmonic]] expansion.\n\nA function is radial [[if and only if]] it is invariant under all [[rotation]]s leaving the origin fixed.

The [[distance]] between any two given [[Point (geometry)|point]]s on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external [[force]]s exerted on it. A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass.\n\nIn the study of [[special relativity]], a perfectly rigid body does not exist; and objects can only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the [[speed of light]]. In [[quantum mechanics]] a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses. For instance, in quantum mechanics [[molecules]] (consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies (see [[Rotational spectroscopy#Classification of molecules based on rotational behavior|classification of molecules as rigid rotors]]).\n\n==Kinematics==\n\n=== Linear and angular position ===\n\nThe position of a rigid body is the [[Coordinate system#Examples|position]] of all the particles of which it is composed. To simplify the description of this position, we exploit the property that the body is rigid, namely that all its particles maintain the same distance relative to each other. If the body is rigid, it is sufficient to describe the position of at least three non-[[collinear]] particles. This makes it possible to reconstruct the position of all the other particles, provided that their [[time-invariant]] position relative to the three selected particles is known. However, typically a different, mathematically more convenient, but equivalent approach is used. The position of the whole body is represented by:\n# the '''linear position''' or '''position''' of the body, namely the position of one of the particles of the body, specifically chosen as a reference point (typically coinciding with the [[center of mass]] or [[centroid]] of the body), together with\n# the '''[[orientation (geometry)|angular position]]''' (also known as '''orientation''', or '''attitude''') of the body.\n\nThus, the position of a rigid body has two components: '''linear''' and '''angular''', respectively.<ref>In general, the position of a point or particle is also known, in physics, as '''linear position''', as opposed to the '''angular position''' of a line, or line segment (e.g., in [[circular motion]], the \"radius\" joining the rotating point with the center of rotation), or [[basis (linear algebra)|basis set]], or [[coordinate system]].</ref>  The same is true for other [[kinematics|kinematic]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|kinetic]] quantities describing the motion of a rigid body, such as linear and angular [[velocity]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], [[Impulse (physics)|impulse]], and [[kinetic energy]].<!--\n\nFOOTNOTE\n--><ref>In [[kinematics]], ''linear'' means \"along a straight or curved line\" (the path of the particle in [[space (physics)|space]]). In [[mathematics]], however, [[linear]] has a different meaning. In both contexts, the word \"linear\" is related to the word \"line\". In mathematics, a [[Line (geometry)|line]] is often defined as a straight [[curve]]. For those who adopt this definition, a [[curve]] can be straight, and curved lines are not supposed to exist. In [[kinematics]], the term ''line'' is used as a synonym of the term ''trajectory'', or ''path'' (namely, it has the same non-restricted meaning as that given, in mathematics, to the word ''curve''). In short, both straight and curved lines are supposed to exist. In kinematics and [[dynamics (physics)|dynamics]], the following words refer to the same non-restricted meaning of the term \"line\":\n* \"linear\" (= along a straight or curved line),\n* \"rectilinear\" (= along a straight line, from Latin ''rectus'' = straight, and ''linere'' = spread),\n* \"curvilinear\" (=along a curved line, from Latin ''curvus'' = curved, and ''linere'' = spread).\nIn [[topology]] and [[meteorology]], the term \"line\" has the same meaning; namely, a [[contour line]] is a curve.</ref><!--\nEND OF FOOTNOTE\n-->\n\nThe linear [[Coordinate system#Examples|position]] can be represented by a [[position vector|vector]] with its tail at an arbitrary reference point in [[Space#Classical mechanics|space]] (the origin of a chosen [[coordinate system]]) and its tip at an arbitrary point of interest on the rigid body, typically coinciding with its [[center of mass]] or [[centroid]]. This reference point may define the origin of a [[coordinate system]] fixed to the body.\n\nThere are several ways to numerically describe the [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]] of a rigid body, including a set of three [[Euler angles]], a [[quaternion]], or a [[Direction cosines#Cartesian coordinates|direction cosine matrix]] (also referred to as a [[rotation matrix]]). All these methods actually define the orientation of a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis set]] (or [[coordinate system]]) which has a fixed orientation relative to the body (i.e. rotates together with the body), relative to another basis set (or coordinate system), from which the motion of the rigid body is observed. For instance, a basis set with fixed orientation relative to an airplane can be defined as a set of three orthogonal [[unit vector]]s ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ''b''<sub>2</sub>, ''b''<sub>3</sub>, such that ''b''<sub>1</sub> is parallel to the chord line of the wing and directed forward, ''b''<sub>2</sub> is normal to the plane of symmetry and directed rightward, and ''b''<sub>3</sub> is given by the cross product <math> b_3 = b_1 \\times b_2 </math>.\n\nIn general, when a rigid body moves, both its position and orientation vary with time. In the kinematic sense, these changes are referred to as ''[[Translation (physics)|translation]]'' and ''[[rotation]]'', respectively. Indeed, the position of a rigid body can be viewed as a hypothetic translation and rotation (roto-translation) of the body starting from a hypothetic reference position (not necessarily coinciding with a position actually taken by the body during its motion).\n\n=== Linear and angular velocity ===\n\n[[Velocity]] (also called '''linear velocity''') and [[angular velocity]] are measured with respect to a [[frame of reference]].\n\nThe linear '''[[velocity]]''' of a rigid body is a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] quantity, equal to the [[time derivative|time rate of change]] of its linear position. Thus, it is the velocity of a reference point fixed to the body.  During purely translational motion (motion with no rotation), all points on a rigid body move with the same [[velocity]].  However, when [[motion (physics)|motion]] involves rotation, the instantaneous velocity of any two points on the body will generally not be the same. Two points of a rotating body will have the same instantaneous velocity only if they happen to lie on an axis parallel to the instantaneous [[axis of rotation]].\n\n'''[[Angular velocity]]''' is a [[Vector (geometry)|vector]] quantity that describes the [[angular speed]] at which the orientation of the rigid body is changing and the instantaneous [[Axis of rotation|axis]] about which it is rotating (the existence of this instantaneous axis is guaranteed by the [[Euler's rotation theorem]]). All points on a rigid body experience the same [[angular velocity]] at all times.  During purely rotational motion, all points on the body change position except for those lying on the instantaneous [[axis of rotation]]. The relationship between orientation and angular velocity is not directly analogous to the relationship between position and velocity.  Angular velocity is not the [[time derivative|time rate of change]] of orientation, because there is no such concept as an orientation vector that can be [[derivative|differentiated]] to obtain the angular velocity.\n\n== Kinematical equations ==\n\n=== Addition theorem for angular velocity ===\n\nThe angular velocity of a rigid body B in a reference frame N is equal to the sum of the angular velocity of a rigid body D in N and the angular velocity of B with respect to D:<ref>{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Thomas|author2=Levinson, David |title=Dynamics Online|publisher=OnLine Dynamics, Inc.|location=Sunnyvale, California|year=1996|chapter=2-4 Auxiliary Reference Frames}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {}^\\mathrm{N}\\!\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\mathrm{B} = {}^\\mathrm{N}\\!\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\mathrm{D} + {}^\\mathrm{D}\\!\\boldsymbol{\\omega}^\\mathrm{B}.</math>\n\nIn this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.\n\n=== Addition theorem for position ===\n\nFor any set of three points P, Q, and R, the position vector from P to R is the sum of the position vector from P to Q and the position vector from Q to R:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r}^\\mathrm{PR} = \\mathbf{r}^\\mathrm{PQ} + \\mathbf{r}^\\mathrm{QR}.</math>\n\n=== Mathematical definition of velocity ===\n\nThe velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the [[time derivative]] in N of the position vector from O to P:<ref name=\"od26\">{{cite book|last=Kane|first=Thomas|author2=Levinson, David |title=Dynamics Online|publisher=OnLine Dynamics, Inc.|location=Sunnyvale, California|year=1996|chapter=2-6 Velocity and Acceleration}}</ref>\n\n:<math> {}^\\mathrm{N}\\mathbf{v}^\\mathrm{P} = \\frac{{}^\\mathrm{N}\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}(\\mathbf{r}^\\mathrm{OP}) </math>\n\nwhere O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/d''t'' operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N.

Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360°. This integer is the [[winding number]] with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the [[Polygon#Angles|amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon]].\n\n==Kinetics==\n{{Main|Rigid body dynamics}}\n\nAny point that is rigidly connected to the body can be used as reference point (origin of coordinate system ''L'') to describe the linear motion of the body (the linear position, velocity and acceleration vectors depend on the choice).\n\nHowever, depending on the application, a convenient choice may be:\n*the [[center of mass]] of the whole system, which generally has the simplest motion for a body moving freely in space;\n*a point such that the translational motion is zero or simplified, e.g. on an [[axle]] or [[hinge]], at the center of a [[ball and socket joint]], etc.\n\nWhen the center of mass is used as reference point:\n*The (linear) [[momentum]] is independent of the rotational motion. At any time it is equal to the total mass of the rigid body times the translational velocity.\n*The [[angular momentum]] with respect to the center of mass is the same as without translation: at any time it is equal to the [[moment of inertia|inertia tensor]] times the angular velocity. When the angular velocity is expressed with respect to a coordinate system coinciding with the [[Moment of inertia#Inertia tensor|principal axes]] of the body, each component of the angular momentum is a product of a moment of inertia (a principal value of the inertia tensor) times the corresponding component of the angular velocity; the [[torque]] is the inertia tensor times the [[angular acceleration]].\n*Possible motions in the absence of external forces are translation with constant velocity, steady rotation about a fixed principal axis, and also torque-free [[precession]].\n*The net external force on the rigid body is always equal to the total mass times the translational acceleration (i.e., [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]] holds for the translational motion, even when the net external torque is nonzero, and/or the body rotates).\n*The total [[kinetic energy]] is simply the sum of translational and  [[rotational energy]].\n\n==Geometry==\n\nTwo rigid bodies are said to be [[equality (objects)|different]] (not copies) if there is no [[proper rotation]] from one to the other. \nA rigid body is called [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] if its [[mirror image]] is different in that sense, i.e., if it has either no [[symmetry]] or its [[symmetry group]] contains only proper rotations. In  the opposite case an object is called achiral: the mirror image is a copy, not a different object. Such an object may have a symmetry plane, but not necessarily: there may also be a plane of reflection with respect to which the image of the object is a rotated version. The latter applies for [[Point groups in three dimensions|''S<sub>2n''</sub>]], of which the case ''n'' = 1 is inversion symmetry.\n\nFor a (rigid) rectangular transparent sheet, inversion symmetry corresponds to having on one side an image without rotational symmetry and on the other side an image such that what shines through is the image at the top side, upside down. We can distinguish two cases:\n*the sheet surface with the image is not symmetric - in this case the two sides are different, but the mirror image of the object is the same, after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.\n*the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - in this case the two sides are the same, and the mirror image of the object is also the same, again after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.\n\nA sheet with a [[through and through]] image is achiral. We can distinguish again two cases:\n*the sheet surface with the image has no symmetry axis - the two sides are different\n*the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - the two sides are the same\n\n==Configuration space==\nThe [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of a rigid body with one point fixed (i.e., a body with zero translational motion) is given by the underlying [[manifold]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The configuration space of a nonfixed (with non-zero translational motion) rigid body is [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|''E''<sup>+</sup>(3)]], the subgroup of [[Euclidean group#Direct and indirect isometries|direct isometries]] of the [[Euclidean group]] in three dimensions (combinations of [[translation (geometry)|translations]] and [[rotation]]s).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Angular velocity]]\n*[[Axes conventions]]\n*[[Rigid body dynamics]]\n*[[Skew-symmetric matrix#Infinitesimal rotations|Infinitesimal rotations]]\n*[[Euler's equations (rigid body dynamics)]]\n*[[Euler's laws]]\n*[[Born rigidity]]\n*[[Rigid rotor]]\n*[[Geometric Mechanics]]\n* [[Classical Mechanics (Goldstein book)|''Classical Mechanics'' (Goldstein)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|title=Robot Dynamics Algorithms|author=Roy Featherstone|publisher=Springer|year=1987|isbn=0-89838-230-0}} This reference effectively combines [[screw theory]] with rigid body [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] for robotic applications.

The assumption that the bodies are rigid, which means that they do not deform under the action of applied forces, simplifies the analysis by reducing the parameters that describe the configuration of the system to the translation and rotation of reference frames attached to each body.<ref>B.

Rigid bodies are also characterized as being non-deformable, as opposed to [[deformable bodies]]. As such, '''rigid-body dynamics''' is used heavily in analyses and [[computer simulation]]s of physical systems and machinery where rotational motion is important but [[Deformation (engineering)|material deformation]] does not have a significant effect on the motion of the system.------>\nThe dynamics of a rigid body system is described by the laws of [[kinematics]] and by the application of Newton's second law ([[Newton's laws of motion|kinetics]]) or their derivative form [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. The solution of these equations of motion provides a description of the position, the motion and the acceleration of the individual components of the system and overall the system itself, as a function of time.  The formulation and solution of rigid body dynamics is an important tool in the computer simulation of [[mechanical system]]s.\n[[File:SteamEngine Boulton&Watt 1784.png|thumb|300px|right|alt=Boulton & Watt Steam Engine|Movement of each of the components of the Boulton & Watt Steam Engine (1784) can be described by a set of equations of kinematics and kinetics]]\n\n==Planar rigid body dynamics==\nIf a system of particles moves parallel to a fixed plane, the system is said to be constrained to planar movement.

They are summarized in the following sections.\n\n====Euler angles====\n{{Main|Euler angles}}\n[[File:Eulerangles.svg|right|thumb|150px|Euler angles, one of the possible ways to describe an orientation.]]\nThe first attempt to represent an orientation is attributed to [[Leonhard Euler]]. He imagined three reference frames that could rotate one around the other, and realized that by starting with a fixed reference frame and performing three rotations, he could get any other reference frame in the space (using two rotations to fix the vertical axis and other to fix the other two axes). The values of these three rotations are called [[Euler angles]].\n\n====Tait–Bryan angles====\n{{Main|Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles}}\n[[File:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|left|150px|Tait–Bryan angles, another way to describe orientation.]]\nThese are three angles, also known as yaw, pitch and roll, Navigation angles and Cardan angles. Mathematically they constitute a set of six possibilities inside the twelve possible sets of Euler angles, the ordering being the one best used for describing the orientation of a vehicle such as an airplane. In aerospace engineering they are usually referred to as Euler angles.\n\n[[File:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|150px|A rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]\n\n====Orientation vector {{anchor|Euler vector|Euler orientation vector}}====\n{{Main|Axis-angle representation}}\nEuler also realized that the composition of two rotations is equivalent to a single rotation about a different fixed axis ([[Euler's rotation theorem]]). Therefore, the composition of the former three angles has to be equal to only one rotation, whose axis was complicated to calculate until matrices were developed.\n\nBased on this fact he introduced a vectorial way to describe any rotation, with a vector on the rotation axis and module equal to the value of the angle. Therefore, any orientation can be represented by a rotation vector (also called Euler vector) that leads to it from the reference frame. When used to represent an orientation, the rotation vector is commonly called orientation vector, or attitude vector.\n\nA similar method, called [[axis-angle representation]], describes a rotation or orientation using a [[unit vector]] aligned with the rotation axis, and a separate value to indicate the angle (see figure).\n\n====Orientation matrix====\n{{Main|Rotation matrix}}\nWith the introduction of matrices the Euler theorems were rewritten. The rotations were described by [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] referred to as rotation matrices or direction cosine matrices. When used to represent an orientation, a rotation matrix is commonly called orientation matrix, or attitude matrix.\n\nThe above-mentioned Euler vector is the [[eigenvector]] of a rotation matrix (a rotation matrix has a unique real [[eigenvalue]]). \nThe product of two rotation matrices is the composition of rotations. Therefore, as before, the orientation can be given as the rotation from the initial frame to achieve the frame that we want to describe.\n\nThe [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of a non-[[symmetry|symmetrical]] object in ''n''-dimensional space is [[Orthogonal group|SO(''n'')]] [[Product topology|&times;]] [[Euclidean space|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>]]. Orientation may be visualized by attaching a basis of [[tangent space|tangent vectors]] to an object. The direction in which each vector points determines its orientation.\n\n====Orientation quaternion====\n{{Main|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\nAnother way to describe rotations is using [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation quaternions]], also called versors. They are equivalent to rotation matrices and rotation vectors. With respect to rotation vectors, they can be more easily converted to and from matrices. When used to represent orientations, rotation quaternions are typically called orientation quaternions or attitude quaternions.\n\n===Newton's second law in three dimensions===\nTo consider rigid body dynamics in three-dimensional space, Newton's second law must be extended to define the relationship between the movement of a rigid body and the system of forces and torques that act on it.\n\nNewton formulated his second law for a particle as, \"The change of motion of an object is proportional to the force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which the force is impressed.\"<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/371907/mechanics/77534/Newtons-laws-of-motion-and-equilibrium Newtons laws of motion].</ref>  Because Newton generally referred to mass times velocity as the \"motion\" of a particle, the phrase \"change of motion\" refers to the mass times acceleration of the particle, and so this law is usually written as\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a},</math>\nwhere '''F''' is understood to be the only external force acting on the particle, ''m'' is the mass of the particle, and '''a''' is its acceleration vector.  The extension of Newton's second law to rigid bodies is achieved by considering a rigid system of particles.\n\n===Rigid system of particles===\nIf a system of ''N'' particles, P<sub>i</sub>, i=1,...,''N'', are assembled into a rigid body, then Newton's second law can be applied to each of the particles in the body.  If '''F'''<sub>i</sub> is the external force applied to particle P<sub>i</sub> with mass ''m''<sub>i</sub>, then\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}_i + \\sum_{j=1}^N \\mathbf{F}_{ij} = m_i\\mathbf{a}_i,\\quad i=1, \\ldots, N,</math>\nwhere '''F'''<sub>ij</sub> is the internal force of particle P<sub>j</sub> acting on particle P<sub>i</sub> that maintains the constant distance between these particles.\n\n[[File:Rigid bodies.jpg|thumb|Human body modelled as a system of rigid bodies of geometrical solids. Representative bones were added for better visualization of the walking person.]]\nAn important simplification to these force equations is obtained by introducing the [[resultant force]] and torque that acts on the rigid system.  This resultant force and torque is obtained by choosing one of the particles in the system as a reference point, '''R''', where each of the external forces are applied with the addition of an associated torque.  The resultant force '''F''' and torque '''T''' are given by the formulas,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbf{F}_i,\\quad  \\mathbf{T} = \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\mathbf{R}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times \\mathbf{F}_i, </math>\nwhere '''R'''<sub>i</sub> is the vector that defines the position of particle P<sub>i</sub>.\n\nNewton's second law for a particle combines with these formulas for the resultant force and torque to yield,\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i\\mathbf{a}_i,\\quad \\mathbf{T} = \\sum_{i=1}^N (\\mathbf{R}_i-\\mathbf{R})\\times (m_i\\mathbf{a}_i), </math>\nwhere the internal forces '''F'''<sub>ij</sub> cancel in pairs.  The [[kinematics]] of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle P<sub>i</sub> in terms of the position '''R''' and acceleration '''a''' of the reference particle as well as the angular velocity vector ω and angular acceleration vector α of the rigid system of particles as,\n:<math> \\mathbf{a}_i = \\alpha\\times(\\mathbf{R}_i-\\mathbf{R})  + \\omega\\times(\\omega\\times(\\mathbf{R}_i-\\mathbf{R}))  + \\mathbf{a}.</math>\n\n===Mass properties===\nThe mass properties of the rigid body are represented by its [[center of mass]] and [[moment of inertia|inertia matrix]].  Choose the reference point '''R''' so that it satisfies the condition\n:<math> \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i(\\mathbf{R}_i-\\mathbf{R})=0,</math>\nthen it is known as the center of mass of the system.\nThe inertia matrix [I<sub>R</sub>] of the system relative to the reference point '''R''' is defined by\n:<math>[I_R] = \\sum_{i=1}^N m_i(\\mathbf{I}(\\mathbf{S}_i^T\\mathbf{S}_i) - \\mathbf{S}_i\\mathbf{S}_i^T), </math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{S}_i</math> is the column vector '''R'''<sub>i</sub>–'''R'''; and <math>\\mathbf{S}_i^T</math> is its transpose.\n\n<math>\\mathbf{S}_i^T\\mathbf{S}_i</math> is the scalar product of <math>\\mathbf{S}_i</math> with itself, while <math>\\mathbf{S}_i\\mathbf{S}_i^T</math> is the tensor product of <math>\\mathbf{S}_i</math> with itself.\n\n<math>\\mathbf{I}</math> is the 3 by 3 identity matrix.\n\n===Force-torque equations===\nUsing the center of mass and inertia matrix, the force and torque equations for a single rigid body take the form\n:<math> \\mathbf{F} = m\\mathbf{a},\\quad \\mathbf{T}=[I_R]\\alpha + \\omega\\times[I_R]\\omega,</math>\nand are known as Newton's second law of motion for a rigid body.\n\nThe dynamics of an interconnected system of rigid bodies, ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''j''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''M'',  is formulated by isolating each rigid body and introducing the interaction forces.  The resultant of the external and interaction forces on each body, yields the force-torque equations\n:<math> \\mathbf{F}_j = m_j \\mathbf{a}_j, \\quad \\mathbf{T}_j =[I_R]_j\\alpha_j + \\omega_j\\times[I_R]_j\\omega_j,\\quad j=1,\\ldots,M.</math>\n\nNewton's formulation yields 6''M'' equations that define the dynamics of a system of ''M'' rigid bodies.<ref>K.

This motion is called ''precession''. The angular velocity of precession '''Ω'''<sub>P</sub> is given by the [[cross product]]:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n:<math>\\boldsymbol\\tau=\\boldsymbol\\Omega_{\\mathrm{P}} \\times \\mathbf{L}.</math>\n\n[[Image:Gyroscope precession.gif|thumb|Precession of a [[gyroscope]]]]\n\nPrecession can be demonstrated by placing a spinning top with its axis horizontal and supported loosely (frictionless toward precession) at one end. Instead of falling, as might be expected, the top appears to defy gravity by remaining with its axis horizontal, when the other end of the axis is left unsupported and the free end of the axis slowly describes a circle in a horizontal plane, the resulting precession turning. This effect is explained by the above equations. The torque on the top is supplied by a couple of forces: gravity acting downward on the device's centre of mass, and an equal force acting upward to support one end of the device. The rotation resulting from this torque is not downward, as might be intuitively expected, causing the device to fall, but perpendicular to both the gravitational torque (horizontal and perpendicular to the axis of rotation) and the axis of rotation (horizontal and outwards from the point of support), i.e., about a vertical axis, causing the device to rotate slowly about the supporting point.\n\nUnder a constant torque of magnitude ''τ'', the speed of precession ''Ω''<sub>P</sub> is inversely proportional to ''L'', the magnitude of its angular momentum:\n:<math>\\tau = \\mathit{\\Omega}_{\\mathrm{P}} L \\sin\\theta,\\!</math>\nwhere ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors '''Ω'''<sub>P</sub> and '''L'''. Thus, if the top's spin slows down (for example, due to friction), its angular momentum decreases and so the rate of precession increases. This continues until the device is unable to rotate fast enough to support its own weight, when it stops precessing and falls off its support, mostly because friction against precession cause another precession that goes to cause the fall.\n\nBy convention, these three vectors - torque, spin, and precession - are all oriented with respect to each other according to the [[right-hand rule]].\n\n==Virtual work of forces acting on a rigid body==\nAn alternate formulation of rigid body dynamics that has a number of convenient features is obtained by considering the [[virtual work]] of forces acting on a rigid body.\n\nThe virtual work of forces acting at various points on a single rigid body can be calculated using the velocities of their point of application and the [[resultant force|resultant force and torque]].

Any rotation is a [[motion (geometry)|motion]] of a certain [[space (mathematics)|space]] that preserves at least one [[point (geometry)|point]]. It can describe, for example, the motion of a [[rigid body]] around a fixed point. A rotation is different from other types of motions: [[translation (geometry)|translations]], which have no fixed points, and [[reflection (mathematics)|(hyperplane) reflections]], each of them having an entire {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional [[flat (geometry)|flat]] of fixed points in a {{mvar|n}}-[[dimension (mathematics)|dimensional]] space. A clockwise rotation is a negative magnitude so a counterclockwise turn has a positive magnitude.\n\nMathematically, a rotation is a [[map (mathematics)|map]]. All rotations about a fixed point form a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]] called the '''rotation group''' (of a particular space). But in [[mechanics]] and, more generally, in [[physics]], this concept is frequently understood as a [[coordinate transformation]] (importantly, a transformation of an [[orthonormal basis]]), because for any motion of a body there is an inverse transformation which if applied to the [[frame of reference]] results in the body being at the same coordinates. For example, in two dimensions rotating a body [[clockwise]] about a point keeping the axes fixed is equivalent to rotating the axes counterclockwise about the same point while the body is kept fixed.  These two types of rotation are called [[active and passive transformation]]s.\n\n==Related definitions and terminology==\nThe ''rotation group'' is a [[Lie group]] of rotations about a [[Group action (mathematics)#Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups|fixed point]]. This (common) fixed point is called the ''[[center (geometry)|center]] of rotation'' and is usually identified with the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]. The rotation group is a ''[[Group action (mathematics)#Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups|point stabilizer]]'' in a broader group of (orientation-preserving) [[motion (geometry)|motions]].\n\nFor a particular rotation:\n* The ''axis of rotation'' is a [[line (geometry)|line]] of its fixed points. They exist only in {{math|''n'' > 2}}.\n* The ''[[plane of rotation]]'' is a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] that is [[Group action (mathematics)#Invariant subsets|invariant]] under the rotation. Unlike the axis, its points are not fixed themselves. The axis (where present) and the plane of a rotation are [[orthogonal]].<!-- I hope not only in Euclidean and not only in 3D? --Incnis Mrsi -->\n\nA ''representation'' of rotations is a particular formalism, either algebraic or geometric, used to parametrize a rotation map. This meaning is somehow inverse to [[group representation|the meaning in the group theory]].\n\nRotations of [[affine space|(affine) spaces of points]] and of respective [[vector space]]s are not always clearly distinguished. The former are sometimes referred to as ''affine rotations'' (although the term is misleading), whereas the latter are ''vector rotations''. See the article below for details.\n\n==Definitions and representations==\n===In Euclidean geometry===<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\n{{further|Euclidean space #Rotations and reflections|Special orthogonal group}}\n[[Image:Rotation4.svg|right|thumb|A plane rotation around a point followed by another rotation around a different point results in a total motion which is either a rotation (as in this picture), or a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]].]]\nA motion of a [[Euclidean space]] is the same as its [[isometry]]: it leaves [[Euclidean distance|the distance]] between any two points unchanged after the transformation. But a (proper) rotation also has to preserve the [[orientation (vector space)|orientation structure]]. The \"[[improper rotation]]\" term refers to isometries that reverse (flip) the orientation. In the language of [[group theory]] the distinction is expressed as ''direct'' vs ''indirect'' isometries in the [[Euclidean group]], where the former comprise the [[identity component]]. Any direct Euclidean motion can be represented as a composition of a rotation about the fixed point and a translation.\n\nThere are no non-[[triviality (mathematics)|trivial]] rotations in one dimension. In [[two-dimensional space|two dimensions]], only a single [[angle]] is needed to specify a rotation about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] – the ''angle of rotation'' that specifies an element of the [[circle group]] (also known as {{math|U(1)}}). The rotation is acting to rotate an object [[counterclockwise]] through an angle {{mvar|θ}} about the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]]; see [[#Two dimensions|below]] for details. Composition of rotations [[summation|sums]] their angles [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 1 [[turn (geometry)|turn]], which implies that all two-dimensional rotations about ''the same'' point [[Abelian group|commute]]. Rotations about ''different'' points, in general, do not commute. Any two-dimensional direct motion is either a translation or a rotation; see [[Euclidean plane isometry]] for details.\n\nRotations in [[three-dimensional space]] differ from those in two dimensions in a number of important ways. Rotations in three dimensions are generally not [[commutative]], so the order in which rotations are applied is important even about the same point. Also, unlike the two-dimensional case, a three-dimensional direct motion, in [[general position]], is not a rotation but a [[screw axis|screw operation]]. Rotations about the origin have three degrees of freedom (see [[rotation formalisms in three dimensions]] for details), the same as the number of dimensions.\n\n{{anchor|Euler angles}}[[Image:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|left|Euler rotations of the Earth. Intrinsic (green), precession (blue) and nutation (red)]]\nA three-dimensional rotation can be specified in a number of ways. The most usual methods are:\n* [[Euler angles]] (pictured at the left). Any rotation about the origin can be represented as the [[function composition|composition]] of three rotations defined as the motion obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. They constitute a '''mixed axes of rotation''' system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis ''z'', the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves. This presentation is convenient only for rotations about a fixed point.\n[[Image:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|104px]]\n* [[Axis–angle representation]] (pictured at the right) specifies an angle with the axis about which the rotation takes place. It can be easily visualised. There are two variants to represent it:\n** as a pair consisting of the angle and a [[unit vector]] for the axis, or\n** as a [[Euclidean vector]] obtained by multiplying the angle with this unit vector, called the ''rotation vector'' (although, strictly speaking, it is a [[pseudovector]]).\n* Matrices, versors (quaternions), and other [[algebra]]ic things: see the section [[#Linear and multilinear algebra formalism|''Linear and Multilinear Algebra Formalism'']] for details.\n\n[[File:8-cell.gif|thumb|An orthogonal projection onto three-dimensions of a [[tesseract]] being rotated in four-dimensional Euclidean space.]]\nA general rotation in [[four-dimensional space|four dimensions]] has only one fixed point, the centre of rotation, and no axis of rotation; see [[rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space]] for details. Instead the rotation has two mutually orthogonal planes of rotation, each of which is fixed in the sense that points in each plane stay within the planes. The rotation has two angles of rotation, one for each [[plane of rotation]], through which points in the planes rotate. If these are {{math|''ω''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ω''<sub>2</sub>}} then all points not in the planes rotate through an angle between {{math|''ω''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ω''<sub>2</sub>}}. Rotations in four dimensions about a fixed point have six degrees of freedom. A four-dimensional direct motion in general position ''is'' a rotation about certain point (as in all [[even number|even]] Euclidean dimensions), but screw operations exist also.\n\n===Linear and multilinear algebra formalism===<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\n{{main|Rotation matrix}}\nWhen one considers motions of the Euclidean space that preserve [[origin (mathematics)|the origin]], the [[point–vector distinction|distinction between points and vectors]], important in pure mathematics, can be erased because there is a canonical [[one-to-one correspondence]] between points and [[position (vector)|position vectors]]. The same is true for geometries other than [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], but whose space is an [[affine space]] with a supplementary [[mathematical structure|structure]]; see [[#In relativity|an example below]]. Alternatively, the vector description of rotations can be understood as a parametrization of geometric rotations [[up to]] their composition with translations. In other words, one vector rotation presents many [[equivalence relation|equivalent]] rotations about ''all'' points in the space.\n\nA motion that preserves the origin is the same as a [[linear operator]] on vectors that preserves the same geometric structure but expressed in terms of vectors. For [[Euclidean vector]]s, this expression is their ''magnitude'' ([[Euclidean norm]]). In [[real coordinate space|components]], such operator is expressed with {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} [[orthogonal matrix]] that is multiplied to [[column vector]]s.\n\nAs it [[#In Euclidean geometry|was already stated]], a (proper) rotation is different from an arbitrary fixed-point motion in its preservation of the orientation of the vector space. Thus, the [[determinant]] of a rotation orthogonal matrix must be 1. The only other possibility for the determinant of an orthogonal matrix is {{num|−1}}, and this result means the transformation is a [[reflection (mathematics)|hyperplane reflection]], a [[point reflection]] (for [[odd number|odd]] {{mvar|n}}), or another kind of [[improper rotation]]. Matrices of all proper rotations form the [[special orthogonal group]].\n\n====Two dimensions====<!-- caution: an internal #-link -->\n[[File:Coordinate system rotation svg.svg|thumb|500px|Geometric derivation of the coordinates after rotating the axes by an angle <math>\\alpha</math>, or, equivalently, after rotating a point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} by <math>\\theta = -\\alpha</math>.]]\nIn two dimensions, to carry out a rotation using a matrix, the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} to be rotated counterclockwise is written as a column vector, then multiplied by a [[rotation matrix]] calculated from the angle {{math|''θ''}}:\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{bmatrix} =\n \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\ \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}</math>.\n\nThe coordinates of the point after rotation are {{math|''x′'', ''y′''}}, and the formulae for {{mvar|x′}} and {{mvar|y′}} are\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx'&=x\\cos\\theta-y\\sin\\theta\\\\\ny'&=x\\sin\\theta+y\\cos\\theta.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe vectors <math> \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} </math> and <math> \\begin{bmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\end{bmatrix} </math> have the same magnitude and are separated by an angle {{mvar|θ}} as expected.\n\n{{anchor|Complex numbers}}\nPoints on the {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} plane can be also presented as [[complex number]]s: the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} in the plane is represented by the complex number\n\n:<math> z = x + iy </math>\n\nThis can be rotated through an angle {{mvar|θ}} by multiplying it by  {{math|''e''<sup>''iθ''</sup>}}, then expanding the product using [[Euler's formula]] as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ne^{i \\theta} z &= (\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta) (x + i y) \\\\\n               &= x \\cos \\theta + i y \\cos \\theta + i x \\sin \\theta - y \\sin \\theta \\\\\n               &= (x \\cos \\theta - y \\sin \\theta) + i ( x \\sin \\theta + y \\cos \\theta) \\\\\n               &= x' + i y' ,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand equating real and imaginary parts gives the same result as a two-dimensional matrix:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx'&=x\\cos\\theta-y\\sin\\theta\\\\\ny'&=x\\sin\\theta+y\\cos\\theta.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince complex numbers form a [[commutative ring]], vector rotations in two dimensions are commutative, unlike in higher dimensions. They have only one [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]], as such rotations are entirely determined by the angle of rotation.<ref>Lounesto 2001, p. 30.</ref>\n\n====Three dimensions====\n{{main|Rotation formalisms in three dimensions}}\nAs in two dimensions, a matrix can be used to rotate a point {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} to a point {{math|(''x′'', ''y′'', ''z′'')}}. The matrix used is a {{gaps|3|×|3}} matrix,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i  \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nThis is multiplied by a vector representing the point to give the result\n\n:<math>\n \\mathbf{A}\n \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} =\n \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i  \\end{pmatrix}\n \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} =\n \\begin{pmatrix} x' \\\\ y' \\\\ z' \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\nThe set of all appropriate matrices together with the operation of [[matrix multiplication]] is the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The matrix {{math|'''A'''}} is a member of the three-dimensional [[special orthogonal group]], {{math|SO(3)}}, that is it is an [[orthogonal matrix]] with [[determinant]] 1. That it is an orthogonal matrix means that its rows are a set of orthogonal [[unit vector]]s (so they are an [[orthonormal basis]]) as are its columns, making it simple to spot and check if a matrix is a valid rotation matrix.\n\n[[#Euler angles|Above-mentioned]] Euler angles and axis–angle representations can be easily converted to a rotation matrix.\n\nAnother possibility to represent a rotation of three-dimensional Euclidean vectors are quaternions described below.\n\n====Quaternions====\n{{Main|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\n\nUnit [[quaternion]]s, or ''[[versor]]s'', are in some ways the least intuitive representation of three-dimensional rotations. They are not the three-dimensional instance of a general approach. They are more compact than matrices and easier to work with than all other methods, so are often preferred in real-world applications.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nA versor (also called a ''rotation quaternion'') consists of four real numbers, constrained so the [[normed vector space|norm]] of the quaternion is 1. This constraint limits the degrees of freedom of the quaternion to three, as required. Unlike matrices and complex numbers two multiplications are needed:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x'} = \\mathbf{qxq}^{-1},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''q'''}} is the versor, {{math|'''q'''<sup>−1</sup>}} is its [[multiplicative inverse|inverse]], and {{math|'''x'''}} is the vector treated as a quaternion with zero [[quaternion#Scalar and vector parts|scalar part]]. The quaternion can be related to the rotation vector form of the axis angle rotation by the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] over the quaternions,\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{q}  = e^{\\mathbf{v}/2},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|'''v'''}} is the rotation vector treated as a quaternion.\n\nA single multiplication by a versor, [[left and right (algebra)|either left or right]], is itself a rotation, but in four dimensions. Any four-dimensional rotation about the origin can be represented with two quaternion multiplications: one left and one right, by two ''different'' unit quaternions.\n\n====Further notes====\nMore generally, coordinate rotations in any dimension are represented by orthogonal matrices.  The set of all orthogonal matrices in {{mvar|n}} dimensions which describe proper rotations (determinant = +1), together with the operation of matrix multiplication, forms the [[special orthogonal group]] {{math|SO(''n'')}}.\n\nMatrices are often used for doing transformations, especially when a large number of points are being transformed, as they are a direct representation of the [[Linear map|linear operator]]. Rotations represented in other ways are often converted to matrices before being used. They can be extended to represent rotations and transformations at the same time using [[homogeneous coordinates]]. [[Projective transformation]]s are represented by {{gaps|4|×|4}} matrices. They are not rotation matrices, but a transformation that represents a Euclidean rotation has a {{gaps|3|×|3}} rotation matrix in the upper left corner.\n\nThe main disadvantage of matrices is that they are more expensive to calculate and do calculations with. Also in calculations where [[numerical stability|numerical instability]] is a concern matrices can be more prone to it, so calculations to restore [[orthonormality]], which are expensive to do for matrices, need to be done more often.\n\n====More alternatives to the matrix formalism====\nAs was demonstrated above, there exist three [[multilinear algebra]] rotation formalisms: one [[#Complex numbers|of U(1), or complex numbers]], for two dimensions, and yet two [[#Quaternions|of versors, or quaternions]], for three and four dimensions.\n\nIn general (and not necessarily for Euclidean vectors) the rotation of a vector space equipped with a [[quadratic form]] can be expressed as a [[bivector]]. This formalism is used in [[geometric algebra]] and, more generally, in the [[Clifford algebra]] representation of Lie groups.\n\nThe doubly [[covering group]] of {{math|SO(''n'')}} is known as the [[Spin group]], {{math|Spin(''n'')}}. It can be conveniently described in terms of Clifford algebra. Unit quaternions present the group {{math|Spin(3)}}.\n\n===In non-Euclidean geometries===\nIn [[spherical geometry]], a direct motion of the [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] (an example of the [[elliptic geometry]]) is the same as a rotation of {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-dimensional Euclidean space about the origin ({{math|SO(''n'' + 1)}}). For odd {{mvar|n}}, most of these motions do not have fixed points on the {{mvar|n}}-sphere and, strictly speaking, are not rotations ''of the sphere''; such motions are<!-- all of them? --> sometimes referred to as ''[[William Kingdon Clifford|Clifford]] translations''. Rotations about a fixed point in elliptic and [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic]] geometries are not different from Euclidean ones.\n\n[[Affine geometry]] and [[projective geometry]] have not a distinct notion of rotation.\n\n===In relativity===\n{{main|Lorentz transformation}}\nOne application of this is [[special relativity]], as it can be considered to operate in a four-dimensional space, [[spacetime]], spanned by three space dimensions and one of time. In special relativity this space is linear and the four-dimensional rotations, called [[Lorentz transformation]]s, have practical physical interpretations. The [[Minkowski space]] is not a [[metric space]], and the term ''isometry'' is inapplicable to Lorentz transformation.\n\nIf a rotation is only in the three space dimensions, i.e. in a plane that is entirely in space, then this rotation is the same as a spatial rotation in three dimensions. But a rotation in a plane spanned by a space dimension and a time dimension is a [[hyperbolic rotation]], a transformation between two different [[Frame of reference|reference frames]], which is sometimes called a \"Lorentz boost\". These transformations demonstrate the [[pseudo-Euclidean space|pseudo-Euclidean]] nature of the Minkowski space. They are sometimes described as ''[[squeeze mapping]]s'' and frequently appear on [[Minkowski diagram]]s which visualize (1 + 1)-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean geometry on planar drawings. The study of relativity is concerned with the [[Lorentz group]] generated by the space rotations and hyperbolic rotations.<ref>Hestenes 1999, pp. 580–588.</ref>\n\nWhereas {{math|SO(3)}} rotations, in physics and astronomy, correspond to rotations of [[celestial sphere]] as a [[sphere|2-sphere]] in the Euclidean 3-space, Lorentz transformations from {{math|SO(3;1)<sup>+</sup>}} induce [[conformal map|conformal]] transformations of the celestial sphere. It is a broader class of  the sphere transformations known as [[Möbius transformation]]s.\n\n===Discrete rotations===\n{{main|point group}}\n{{expand section|date=February 2014}}\n\n==Importance==\nRotations define important classes of [[symmetry]]: [[rotational symmetry]] is an [[invariant (mathematics)|invariance]] with respect to a ''particular rotation''. The [[circular symmetry]] is an invariance with respect to all rotation about the fixed axis.\n\nAs was stated above, Euclidean rotations are applied to [[rigid body dynamics]]. Moreover, most of mathematical formalism in [[physics]] (such as the [[vector calculus]]) is rotation-invariant; see [[rotation]] for more physical aspects.

This is why, it is first shown how the translation operator is acting on a particle at position x (the particle is then in the [[quantum state|state]] <math>|x\\rangle</math> according to [[Quantum Mechanics]]).\n\nTranslation of the particle at position x to position x+a: <math>\\mbox{T}(a)|x\\rangle = |x + a\\rangle</math>        \n\nBecause a translation of 0 does not change the position of the particle, we have (with 1 meaning the [[identity function|identity operator]], which does nothing):\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{T}(0) = 1</math>\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{T}(a) \\mbox{T}(da)|x\\rangle = \\mbox{T}(a)|x + da\\rangle = |x + a + da\\rangle = \\mbox{T}(a + da)|x\\rangle \\Rightarrow</math>\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{T}(a) \\mbox{T}(da) = \\mbox{T}(a + da)</math>\n\n[[Taylor series|Taylor]] development gives:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{T}(da) = \\mbox{T}(0) + \\frac{d\\mbox{T}(0)}{da} da + ... = 1 - \\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\ p_x\\ da</math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>\\,p_x = i \\hbar \\frac{d\\mbox{T}(0)}{da}</math>\n\nFrom that follows:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{T}(a + da) = \\mbox{T}(a) \\mbox{T}(da) = \\mbox{T}(a)\\left(1 - \\frac{i}{\\hbar} p_x da\\right) \\Rightarrow</math>\n\n:<math>\\,[\\mbox{T}(a + da) - \\mbox{T}(a)]/da = \\frac{d\\mbox{T}}{da} = - \\frac{i}{\\hbar} p_x \\mbox{T}(a)</math>\n\nThis is a [[differential equation]] with the solution <math>\\,\\mbox{T}(a) = \\mbox{exp}\\left(- \\frac{i}{\\hbar} p_x a\\right)</math>.\n\nAdditionally, suppose a [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]] <math>\\,H</math> is independent of the <math>\\,x</math> position. Because the translation operator can be written in terms of <math>\\,p_x</math>, and <math>\\,[p_x,H]=0</math>, we know that <math>\\,[H,\\mbox{T}(a)]=0</math>. This result means that linear [[momentum]] for the system is conserved.\n\n==In relation to the orbital angular momentum==\nClassically we have for the [[angular momentum]] <math>\\,l = r \\times p</math>. This is the same in [[quantum mechanics]] considering <math>\\,r</math> and <math>\\,p</math> as operators. Classically, an infinitesimal rotation <math>\\,dt</math> of the vector r=(x,y,z) about the z-axis to r'=(x',y',z) leaving z unchanged can be expressed by the following infinitesimal translations (using [[Taylor series|Taylor approximation]]):\n\n:<math>\\,x' = r \\cos(t + dt) = x - y dt + ...</math>\n\n:<math>\\,y' = r \\sin(t + dt) = y + x dt + ...</math>\n\nFrom that follows for states:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{R}(z, dt)|r\\rangle</math><math>= \\mbox{R}(z, dt)|x, y, z\\rangle</math><math>= |x - y dt, y + x dt, z\\rangle</math><math>= \\mbox{T}_x(-y dt) \\mbox{T}_y(x dt)|x, y, z\\rangle</math><math>= \\mbox{T}_x(-y dt) \\mbox{T}_y(x dt)|r\\rangle</math>\n\nAnd consequently:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{R}(z, dt) = \\mbox{T}_x (-y dt) \\mbox{T}_y(x dt)</math>\n\nUsing <math>\\,T_k(a) = \\exp\\left(- \\frac{i}{h}\\ p_k\\ a\\right)</math> from above with <math>\\,k = x,y</math> and Taylor expansion we get:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{R}(z, dt) = \\exp\\left[- \\frac{i}{h}\\ (x p_y - y p_x) dt\\right]</math><math>= \\exp\\left(- \\frac{i}{h}\\ l_z dt\\right) = 1 - \\frac{i}{h} l_z dt + ...</math>\n\nwith l<sub>z</sub> = x p<sub>y</sub> - y p<sub>x</sub> the z-component of the angular momentum according to the classical [[cross product]].\n\nTo get a rotation for the angle <math>\\,t</math>, we construct the following differential equation using the condition <math>\\mbox{R}(z, 0) = 1</math>:\n\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{R}(z, t + dt) = \\mbox{R}(z, t) \\mbox{R}(z, dt) \\Rightarrow</math>\n:<math>\\,[\\mbox{R}(z, t + dt) - \\mbox{R}(z, t)]/dt = d\\mbox{R}/dt</math><math>\\,= \\mbox{R}(z, t) [\\mbox{R}(z, dt) - 1]/dt</math><math>\\,= - \\frac{i}{h} l_z \\mbox{R}(z, t) \\Rightarrow</math>\n:<math>\\,\\mbox{R}(z, t) = \\exp\\left(- \\frac{i}{h}\\ t\\ l_z\\right)</math>\n\nSimilar to the translation operator, if we are given a Hamiltonian <math>\\,H</math> which rotationally symmetric about the z axis, <math>\\,[l_z,H]=0</math> implies <math>\\,[\\mbox{R}(z,t),H]=0</math>. This result means that angular momentum is conserved.\n\nFor the spin angular momentum about the y-axis we just replace <math>\\,l_z</math> with <math>\\,S_y = \\frac{h}{2} \\sigma_y</math> and we get the [[spin (physics)|spin]] rotation operator <math>\\,\\mbox{D}(y, t) = \\exp\\left(- i \\frac{t}{2} \\sigma_y\\right)</math>.\n\n==Effect on the spin operator and quantum states==\n{{Main|Spin (physics)#Rotations}}\n{{see also|Rotation group SO(3)#A note on Lie algebra}}\nOperators can be represented by [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. From [[linear algebra]] one knows that a certain matrix <math>\\,A</math> can be represented in another [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] through the transformation\n\n:<math>\\,A' = P A P^{-1}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\,P</math> is the basis transformation matrix. If the vectors <math>\\,b</math> respectively <math>\\,c</math> are the z-axis in one basis respectively another, they are perpendicular to the y-axis with a certain angle <math>\\,t</math> between them. The spin operator <math>\\,S_b</math> in the first basis can then be transformed into the spin operator <math>\\,S_c</math> of the other basis through the following transformation:\n\n:<math>\\,S_c = \\mbox{D}(y, t) S_b \\mbox{D}^{-1}(y, t)</math>\n\nFrom standard quantum mechanics we have the known results <math>\\,S_b |b+\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |b+\\rangle</math> and <math>\\,S_c |c+\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |c+\\rangle</math> where  <math>\\,|b+\\rangle</math> and <math>\\,|c+\\rangle</math> are the top spins in their corresponding bases. So we have:\n\n:<math>\\,\\frac{\\hbar}{2} |c+\\rangle = S_c |c+\\rangle = \\mbox{D}(y, t) S_b \\mbox{D}^{-1}(y, t) |c+\\rangle \\Rightarrow</math>\n\n:<math>\\,S_b \\mbox{D}^{-1}(y, t) |c+\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} \\mbox{D}^{-1}(y, t) |c+\\rangle</math>\n\nComparison with <math>\\,S_b |b+\\rangle = \\frac{\\hbar}{2} |b+\\rangle</math> yields <math>\\,|b+\\rangle = D^{-1}(y, t) |c+\\rangle</math>.\n\nThis means that if the state <math>\\,|c+\\rangle</math> is rotated about the y-axis by an angle <math>\\,t</math>, it becomes the state <math>\\,|b+\\rangle</math>, a result that can be generalized to arbitrary axes. It is important, for instance, in [[Sakurai's Bell inequality]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Symmetry in quantum mechanics]]\n*[[Spherical basis]]\n*[[Optical phase space]]\n\n==References==\n*L.D.

The orbital [[angular momentum operator]] is the quantum-mechanical counterpart to the classical angular momentum of [[orbital revolution]] and appears when there is periodic structure to its wavefunction as the angle varies.<ref>[http://galileo.phys.virginia.edu/classes/751.mf1i.fall02/AngularMomentum.htm \"Angular Momentum Operator Algebra\", class notes by Michael Fowler]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_7uriPX028C&pg=PA31 ''A modern approach to quantum mechanics'', by Townsend, p. 31 and p. 80]</ref> The existence of spin angular momentum is [[inferred]] from experiments, such as the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]], in which silver atoms were observed to possess two possible discrete angular momenta despite having no orbital angular momentum.<ref name=\"eisberg272\">{{cite book|last=Eisberg|first=Robert|last2=Resnick|first2=Robert|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei, and Particles|edition=2nd|year=1985|pages=272&ndash;3}}</ref> \n\nIn some ways, spin is like a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity; it has a definite magnitude, and it has a \"direction\" (but [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] makes this \"direction\" different from the direction of an ordinary vector). All elementary particles of a given kind have the same magnitude of spin angular momentum, which is indicated by assigning the particle a [[spin quantum number]].<ref name=\"griffiths183\" />\n\nThe [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of spin is the ([[Newton (unit)|N]]·[[metre|m]]·[[second|s]]) or ([[Kilogram|kg]]·m<sup>2</sup>·s<sup>−1</sup>), just as with classical angular momentum.  In practice, spin is given as a [[dimensionless]] spin quantum number by dividing the spin angular momentum by the [[reduced Planck constant]] {{mvar|ħ}}, which has the same units of angular momentum, although this is not the full computation of this value.  Very often, the \"spin quantum number\" is simply called \"spin\", leaving its meaning as the unitless \"spin quantum number\" to be inferred from context.\n\nWhen combined with the [[spin-statistics theorem]], the spin of electrons results in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which in turn underlies the [[periodic table]] of [[chemical element]]s.\n\n[[Wolfgang Pauli]] in 1924 was the first to propose a doubling of electron states due to a two-valued non-classical \"hidden rotation\".<ref name=Pais201>{{cite book |last=Pais |first=Abraham |date=1991 |title=Niels Bohr's Times |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=201 |isbn=978-0-19-852049-8 |author-link=Abraham Pais}}</ref> In 1925, [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] at [[Leiden University]] suggested the simple physical interpretation of a particle spinning around its own axis, in the spirit of the [[old quantum theory]] of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]] and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]].<ref name=Pais241>{{cite book |last=Pais |first=Abraham |date=1991 |title=Niels Bohr's Times |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=241–244 |isbn=978-0-19-852049-8 |author-link=Abraham Pais}}</ref> [[Ralph Kronig]] anticipated the Uhlenbeck-Goudsmit model in discussion with [[Hendrik Kramers]] several months earlier in Copenhagen, but did not publish.<ref name=Pais241/> The mathematical theory was worked out in depth by Pauli in 1927. When [[Paul Dirac]] derived his [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] in 1928, electron spin was an essential part of it.\n\n==Quantum number==\n\n{{main|Spin quantum number}}\n\nAs the name suggests, spin was originally conceived as the rotation of a particle around some axis. This picture is correct so far as spin obeys the same mathematical laws as [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]] [[angular momentum|angular momenta]] do. On the other hand, spin has some peculiar properties that distinguish it from orbital angular momenta:\n*Spin quantum numbers may take half-integer values.\n*Although the direction of its spin can be changed, an elementary particle cannot be made to spin faster or slower.\n*The spin of a charged particle is associated with a [[magnetic dipole moment]] with a [[g-factor (physics)|{{mvar|g}}-factor]] differing from 1. This could only occur classically [[Gyromagnetic ratio#Gyromagnetic ratio for a classical rotating body|if the internal charge of the particle were distributed differently from its mass]].\n\nThe conventional definition of the '''spin quantum number''', {{mvar|s}}, is {{math|''s'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}, where {{mvar|n}} can be any [[non-negative]] [[integer]]. Hence the allowed values of {{mvar|s}} are 0, [[Spin-½|{{sfrac|1|2}}]], 1, {{sfrac|3|2}}, 2, etc. The value of {{mvar|s}} for an [[elementary particle]] depends only on the type of particle, and cannot be altered in any known way (in contrast to the ''spin direction'' described below). The spin angular momentum, {{mvar|S}}, of any physical system is [[angular momentum quantization|quantized]]. The allowed values of {{mvar|S}} are\n\n:<math>S = \\hbar \\, \\sqrt{s (s+1)}=\\frac{h}{4\\pi} \\, \\sqrt{n(n+2)},</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|h}} is the [[Planck constant]] and {{math| <math>\\hbar</math> {{=}} {{sfrac|''h''|2π}}}} is the reduced Planck constant. In contrast, [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] can only take on integer values of {{mvar|s}}; i.e., even-numbered values of {{mvar|n}}.\n\n===Fermions and bosons===\nThose particles with half-integer spins, such as {{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, are known as [[fermion]]s, while those particles with integer spins, such as 0, 1, 2, are known as [[bosons]].  The two families of particles obey different rules and ''broadly'' have different roles in the world around us. A key distinction between the two families is that fermions obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]; that is, there cannot be two identical fermions simultaneously having the same quantum numbers (meaning, roughly, having the same position, velocity and spin direction).  In contrast, bosons obey the rules of [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] and have no such restriction, so they may \"bunch together\" even if in identical states. Also, composite particles can have spins different from their component particles.  For example, a [[helium atom]] in the ground state has spin 0 and behaves like a boson, even though the [[quarks]] and electrons which make it up are all fermions.\n\nThis has some profound consequences:\n\n* [[Quarks]] and [[leptons]] (including [[electrons]] and [[neutrinos]]), which make up what is classically known as [[matter]], are all fermions with [[spin 1/2|spin {{sfrac|1|2}}]]. The common idea that \"matter takes up space\" actually comes from the Pauli exclusion principle acting on these particles to prevent the fermions that make up matter from being in the same quantum state. Further compaction would require electrons to occupy the same energy states, and therefore a kind of [[pressure]] (sometimes known as [[degenerate matter|degeneracy pressure of electrons]]) acts to resist the fermions being overly close.\n:Elementary fermions with other spins ({{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, etc.) are not known to exist.\n* Elementary particles which are thought of as [[force carrier|carrying forces]] are all bosons with spin&nbsp;1. They include the [[photon]] which carries the [[electromagnetic force]], the [[gluon]] ([[strong force]]), and the [[W and Z bosons]] ([[weak force]]). The ability of bosons to occupy the same quantum state is used in the [[laser]], which aligns many photons having the same quantum number (the same direction and frequency), [[superfluid]] [[liquid helium]] resulting from helium-4 atoms being bosons, and [[superconductivity]] where [[Cooper pair|pairs of electrons]] (which individually are fermions) act as single composite bosons.\n:Elementary bosons with other spins (0, 2, 3, etc.) were not historically known to exist, although they have received considerable theoretical treatment and are well established within their respective mainstream theories. In particular, theoreticians have proposed the [[graviton]] (predicted to exist by some [[quantum gravity]] theories) with spin 2, and the [[Higgs boson]] (explaining [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]) with spin 0. Since 2013, the Higgs boson with spin&nbsp;0 has been considered proven to exist.<ref>[http://home.cern/topics/higgs-boson Information about Higgs Boson] in [[CERN]]'s official website.</ref> It is the first [[scalar boson|scalar elementary particle]] (spin&nbsp;0) known to exist in nature.\n\n===Spin-statistics theorem===\nThe [[spin-statistics theorem]] states (1) that particles with half-integer spin (fermions) obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] and the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and (2) that particles with integer spin (bosons) obey Bose–Einstein statistics, occupy \"symmetric states\", and thus can share quantum states. The theorem relies on both quantum mechanics and the theory of [[special relativity]], and this connection between spin and statistics has been called \"one of the most important applications of the special relativity theory\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pauli | first1 = Wolfgang | authorlink = Wolfgang Pauli | year = 1940 | title = The Connection Between Spin and Statistics | url = http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/pauli40b/eng.pdf | journal = Phys.

Experimental results have put the neutrino magnetic moment at less than {{val|1.2|e=-10}}&nbsp;times the electron's magnetic moment.\n\n==Curie temperature and loss of alignment==\nIn ordinary materials, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms produce magnetic fields that cancel one another, because each dipole points in a random direction, with the overall average being very near zero. [[Ferromagnet]]ic materials below their [[Curie temperature]], however, exhibit [[magnetic domain]]s in which the atomic dipole moments are locally aligned, producing a macroscopic, non-zero magnetic field from the domain. These are the ordinary \"magnets\" with which we are all familiar.\n\nIn paramagnetic materials, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align with an externally applied magnetic field. In diamagnetic materials, on the other hand, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms spontaneously align oppositely to any externally applied magnetic field, even if it requires energy to do so.\n\nThe study of the behavior of such \"[[spin model]]s\" is a thriving area of research in [[condensed matter physics]]. For instance, the [[Ising model]] describes spins (dipoles) that have only two possible states, up and down, whereas in the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|Heisenberg model]] the spin vector is allowed to point in any direction. These models have many interesting properties, which have led to interesting results in the theory of [[phase transition]]s.\n\n==Direction==\n{{further|Angular momentum operator}}\n\n===Spin projection quantum number and multiplicity===\nIn classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle possesses not only a magnitude (how fast the body is rotating), but also a direction (either up or down on the [[axis of rotation]] of the particle). Quantum mechanical spin also contains information about direction, but in a more subtle form. Quantum mechanics states that the [[Spatial vector|component]] of angular momentum measured along any direction can only take on the values <ref>Quanta: A handbook of concepts, P.W. Atkins, Oxford University Press, 1974, {{ISBN|0-19-855493-1}}</ref>\n\n:<math> S_i = \\hbar s_i, \\quad s_i \\in \\{ - s, -(s-1), \\dots, s-1, s \\} \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|S<sub>i</sub>}} is the spin component along the {{mvar|i}}-axis (either {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, or {{mvar|z}}), {{mvar|s<sub>i</sub>}} is the spin projection quantum number along the {{mvar|i}}-axis, and {{mvar|s}} is the principal spin quantum number (discussed in the previous section). Conventionally the direction chosen is the {{mvar|z}}-axis:\n\n:<math> S_z = \\hbar s_z, \\quad s_z \\in \\{ - s, -(s-1), \\dots, s - 1, s \\} \\,\\!</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|S<sub>z</sub>}} is the spin component along the {{mvar|z}}-axis, {{mvar|s<sub>z</sub>}} is the spin projection quantum number along the {{mvar|z}}-axis.\n\nOne can see that there are {{math|2''s'' + 1}} possible values of {{mvar|s<sub>z</sub>}}. The number \"{{math|2''s'' + 1}}\" is the [[Multiplicity (chemistry)|multiplicity]] of the spin system. For example, there are only two possible values for a [[spin-1/2|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle: {{math|''s<sub>z</sub>'' {{=}} +{{sfrac|1|2}}}} and {{math|''s<sub>z</sub>'' {{=}} −{{sfrac|1|2}}}}. These correspond to [[quantum state]]s in which the spin component is pointing in the +z or −z directions respectively, and are often referred to as \"spin up\" and \"spin down\". For a spin-{{sfrac|3|2}} particle, like a [[delta baryon]], the possible values are +{{sfrac|3|2}}, +{{sfrac|1|2}}, −{{sfrac|1|2}}, −{{sfrac|3|2}}.\n\n===Vector===\n[[File:Spin One-Half (Slow).gif|thumb|A single point in space can spin continuously without becoming tangled. Notice that after a 360-degree rotation, the spiral flips between clockwise and counterclockwise orientations.  It [[spinor|returns to its original configuration after spinning a full 720 degrees.]]]]\n\nFor a given [[quantum state]], one could think of a spin vector <math display=\"inline\"> \\lang S \\rang </math> whose components are the [[expectation value (quantum physics)|expectation value]]s of the spin components along each axis, i.e., <math display=\"inline\"> \\lang S \\rang = [\\lang S_x \\rang, \\lang S_y \\rang, \\lang S_z \\rang]</math>. This vector then would describe the \"direction\" in which the spin is pointing, corresponding to the classical concept of the [[axis of rotation]]. It turns out that the spin vector is not very useful in actual quantum mechanical calculations, because it cannot be measured directly: {{mvar|s<sub>x</sub>}}, {{mvar|s<sub>y</sub>}} and {{mvar|s<sub>z</sub>}} cannot possess simultaneous definite values, because of a quantum [[uncertainty principle|uncertainty relation]] between them. However, for statistically large collections of particles that have been placed in the same pure quantum state, such as through the use of a [[Stern–Gerlach apparatus]], the spin vector does have a well-defined experimental meaning: It specifies the direction in ordinary space in which a subsequent detector must be oriented in order to achieve the maximum possible probability (100%) of detecting every particle in the collection. For spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles, this maximum probability drops off smoothly as the angle between the spin vector and the detector increases, until at an angle of 180 degrees—that is, for detectors oriented in the opposite direction to the spin vector—the expectation of detecting particles from the collection reaches a minimum of 0%.\n\nAs a qualitative concept, the spin vector is often handy because it is easy to picture classically. For instance, quantum mechanical spin can exhibit phenomena analogous to classical [[gyroscope|gyroscopic effects]]. For example, one can exert a kind of \"[[torque]]\" on an electron by putting it in a [[magnetic field]] (the field acts upon the electron's intrinsic [[magnetic dipole moment]]—see the following section). The result is that the spin vector undergoes [[precession]], just like a classical gyroscope.  This phenomenon is known as [[Electron paramagnetic resonance|electron spin resonance (ESR)]]. The equivalent behaviour of protons in atomic nuclei is used in [[Nuclear magnetic resonance| nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]] spectroscopy and imaging.\n\nMathematically, quantum-mechanical spin states are described by vector-like objects known as [[spinor]]s. There are subtle differences between the behavior of spinors and vectors under [[coordinate rotation]]s. For example, rotating a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle by 360 degrees does not bring it back to the same quantum state, but to the state with the opposite quantum [[phase (waves)|phase]]; this is detectable, in principle, with [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] experiments. To return the particle to its exact original state, one needs a 720-degree rotation.  (The [[Plate trick]] and [[Möbius strip]] give non-quantum  analogies.)   A spin-zero particle can only have a single quantum state, even after torque is applied. Rotating a spin-2 particle 180 degrees can bring it back to the same quantum state and a spin-4 particle should be rotated 90 degrees to bring it back to the same quantum state. The spin-2 particle can be analogous to a straight stick that looks the same even after it is rotated 180 degrees and a spin 0 particle can be imagined as sphere, which looks the same after whatever angle it is turned through.\n\n==Mathematical formulation==\n\n===Operator===\nSpin obeys [[commutation relations]] analogous to those of the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]]:\n\n:<math>[S_j, S_k ] = i \\hbar \\varepsilon_{jkl} S_l</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|ε<sub>jkl</sub>}} is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]. It follows (as with [[angular momentum]]) that the [[eigenvectors]] of {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}} and {{math|''S''<sub>z</sub>}} (expressed as [[Bra-ket notation|ket]]s in the total {{mvar|S}} [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]) are:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  S^2 |s,m_{s}\\rangle &= \\hbar^2 s(s + 1) |s,m_{s}\\rangle \\\\\n  S_z |s,m_{s}\\rangle &= \\hbar m_{s} |s,m_{s}\\rangle.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe spin [[Creation and annihilation operators|raising and lowering operators]] acting on these eigenvectors give:\n\n:<math>S_\\pm |s,m_{s}\\rangle = \\hbar\\sqrt{s(s+1)-m_{s}(m_{s}\\pm 1)} |s,m_{s}\\pm 1 \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|''S''<sub>±</sub> {{=}} ''S<sub>x</sub>'' ± ''i S<sub>y</sub>''}}.\n\nBut unlike orbital angular momentum the eigenvectors are not [[spherical harmonics]]. They are not functions of {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}}. There is also no reason to exclude half-integer values of {{mvar|s}} and {{mvar|m<sub>s</sub>}}.\n\nIn addition to their other properties, all quantum mechanical particles possess an intrinsic spin (though this value may be equal to zero). The spin is quantized in units of the reduced [[Planck's constant|Planck constant]], such that the state function of the particle is, say, not {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ''ψ''('''r''')}}, but {{math|''ψ'' {{=}} ''ψ''('''r''',''σ'')}} where {{mvar|σ}} is out of the following discrete set of values:\n\n:<math>\\sigma \\in \\{-s\\hbar, -(s - 1)\\hbar, \\cdots, +(s - 1)\\hbar, +s\\hbar\\}.</math>\n\nOne distinguishes [[boson]]s (integer spin) and [[fermion]]s (half-integer spin). The total angular momentum conserved in interaction processes is then the sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin.\n\n=== Pauli matrices ===\n{{main|Pauli matrices}}\nThe [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] [[Operator (mathematics)|operators]] associated with spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} [[observables]] are:\n\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}=\\frac{\\hbar}{2}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}</math>\n\nwhere in Cartesian components:\n\n:<math> S_x = {\\hbar \\over 2} \\sigma_x,\\quad S_y = {\\hbar \\over 2} \\sigma_y,\\quad S_z = {\\hbar \\over 2} \\sigma_z \\,.</math>\n\nFor the special case of spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles, {{mvar|σ<sub>x</sub>}}, {{mvar|σ<sub>y</sub>}} and {{mvar|σ<sub>z</sub>}} are the three [[Pauli matrices]], given by:\n\n:<math>\n\\sigma_x =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\\, \\quad\n\\sigma_y =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -i\\\\\ni & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\, \\quad\n\\sigma_z =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\\,.\n</math>\n\n===Pauli exclusion principle===\n\nFor systems of {{mvar|N}} identical particles this is related to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], which states that by interchanges of any two of the {{mvar|N}} particles one must have\n\n:<math>\\psi ( \\cdots \\mathbf r_i,\\sigma_i\\cdots \\mathbf r_j,\\sigma_j\\cdots ) = (-1)^{2s}\\psi ( \\cdots \\mathbf r_j,\\sigma_j\\cdots \\mathbf r_i,\\sigma_i\\cdots ) .</math>\n\nThus, for bosons the prefactor {{math|(−1)<sup>2''s''</sup>}} will reduce to +1, for fermions to −1. In quantum mechanics all particles are either bosons or fermions. In some speculative relativistic quantum field theories \"[[Supersymmetry|supersymmetric]]\" particles also exist, where linear combinations of bosonic and fermionic components appear. In two dimensions, the prefactor {{math|(−1)<sup>2''s''</sup>}} can be replaced by any complex number of magnitude 1 such as in the [[anyon]].\n \nThe above permutation postulate for {{mvar|N}}-particle state functions has most-important consequences in daily life, e.g. the [[periodic table]] of the chemical elements.\n\n===Rotations===\n\n{{see also|symmetries in quantum mechanics}}\n\nAs described above, quantum mechanics states that [[Spatial vector|components]] of angular momentum measured along any direction can only take a number of discrete values. The most convenient quantum mechanical description of particle's spin is therefore with a set of complex numbers corresponding to amplitudes of finding a given value of projection of its intrinsic angular momentum on a given axis. For instance, for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle, we would need two numbers {{math|''a''<sub>±{{sfrac|1|2}}</sub>}}, giving amplitudes of finding it with projection of angular momentum equal to {{math|{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} and {{math|−{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}, satisfying the requirement\n\n:<math>\\left|a_\\frac{1}{2}\\right|^2 + \\left|a_{-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right|^2 \\, = 1.</math>\n\nFor a generic particle with spin {{mvar|s}}, we would need {{math|2''s'' + 1}} such parameters. Since these numbers depend on the choice of the axis, they transform into each other non-trivially when this axis is rotated. It's clear that the transformation law must be linear, so we can represent it by associating a matrix with each rotation, and the product of two transformation matrices corresponding to rotations A and B must be equal (up to phase) to the matrix representing rotation AB. Further, rotations preserve the quantum mechanical inner product, and so should our transformation matrices:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                    \\sum_{m=-j}^{j} a_m^* b_m &= \\sum_{m=-j}^j \\left(\\sum_{n=-j}^j U_{nm} a_n\\right)^* \\left(\\sum_{k=-j}^j U_{km} b_k\\right) \\\\\n  \\sum_{n=-j}^j \\sum_{k=-j}^j U_{np}^* U_{kq} &= \\delta_{pq}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nMathematically speaking, these matrices furnish a unitary [[projective representation|projective]] [[group representation|representation]] of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. Each such representation corresponds to a representation of the covering group of SO(3), which is [[SU(2)]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n |author=B.C.

However, if {{mvar|s}} is a half-integer, the values of {{mvar|m}} are also all half-integers, giving {{math|(−1)<sup>2''m''</sup> {{=}} −1}} for all {{mvar|m}}, and hence upon rotation by 2{{pi}} the state picks up a minus sign. This fact is a crucial element of the proof of the [[spin-statistics theorem]].\n\n===Lorentz transformations===\nWe could try the same approach to determine the behavior of spin under general [[Lorentz transformation]]s, but we would immediately discover a major obstacle. Unlike SO(3), the group of Lorentz transformations [[SO(3,1)]] is [[Compact group|non-compact]] and therefore does not have any faithful, unitary, finite-dimensional representations.\n\nIn case of spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particles, it is possible to find a construction that includes both a finite-dimensional representation and a scalar product that is preserved by this representation. We associate a 4-component [[Dirac spinor]] {{mvar|ψ}} with each particle. These spinors transform under Lorentz transformations according to the law\n\n:<math>\\psi' = \\exp{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{8} \\omega_{\\mu\\nu} [\\gamma_{\\mu}, \\gamma_{\\nu}]\\right)} \\psi</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|γ<sub>ν</sub>}} are [[gamma matrices]] and {{mvar|ω<sub>μν</sub>}} is an antisymmetric 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 matrix parametrizing the transformation. It can be shown that the scalar product\n\n:<math>\\langle\\psi|\\phi\\rangle = \\bar{\\psi}\\phi = \\psi^{\\dagger}\\gamma_0\\phi</math>\n\nis preserved. It is not, however, positive definite, so the representation is not unitary.\n\n===Measurement of spin along the {{mvar|x}}-, {{mvar|y}}-, or {{mvar|z}}-axes===\nEach of the ([[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]]) Pauli matrices has two [[eigenvalues]], +1 and −1.

In this article, the convention is chosen to make the first element imaginary and negative if there is a sign ambiguity. The present convention is used by software such as sympy; while many physics textbooks, such as Sakurai and Griffiths, prefer to make it real and positive.)\n\nBy the [[Postulates of quantum mechanics#Postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates of quantum mechanics]], an experiment designed to measure the electron spin on the {{mvar|x}}-, {{mvar|y}}-, or {{mvar|z}}-axis can only yield an eigenvalue of the corresponding spin operator ({{mvar|S<sub>x</sub>}}, {{mvar|S<sub>y</sub>}} or {{mvar|S<sub>z</sub>}}) on that axis, i.e. {{math|{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} or {{math|–{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}. The [[quantum state]] of a particle (with respect to spin), can be represented by a two component [[spinor]]:\n\n:<math>\\psi = \\begin{pmatrix} a + bi \\\\ c + di \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nWhen the spin of this particle is measured with respect to a given axis (in this example, the {{mvar|x}}-axis), the probability that its spin will be measured as {{math|{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} is just <math display=\"inline\"> \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{x+} \\vert \\psi \\rangle \\right\\vert ^2</math>. Correspondingly, the probability that its spin will be measured as {{math|–{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} is just <math display=\"inline\"> \\left\\vert \\left\\langle\\left. \\psi_{x-} \\right\\vert \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^2</math>. Following the measurement, the spin state of the particle will [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the corresponding eigenstate. As a result, if the particle's spin along a given axis has been measured to have a given eigenvalue, all measurements will yield the same eigenvalue (since <math display=\"inline\"> \\left\\vert \\left\\langle\\left. \\psi_{x+} \\right\\vert \\psi_{x+} \\right\\rangle \\right\\vert ^2 = 1 </math>, etc), provided that no measurements of the spin are made along other axes.\n\n===Measurement of spin along an arbitrary axis===\nThe operator to measure spin along an arbitrary axis direction is easily obtained from the Pauli spin matrices. Let {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''u<sub>x</sub>'', ''u<sub>y</sub>'', ''u<sub>z</sub>'')}} be an arbitrary unit vector. Then the operator for spin in this direction is simply \n:<math> S_u = \\frac{\\hbar}{2}(u_x\\sigma_x + u_y\\sigma_y + u_z\\sigma_z)</math>.\nThe operator {{mvar|S<sub>u</sub>}} has eigenvalues of {{math|±{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}, just like the usual spin matrices. This method of finding the operator for spin in an arbitrary direction generalizes to higher spin states, one takes the dot product of the direction with a vector of the three operators for the three {{mvar|x}}-, {{mvar|y}}-, {{mvar|z}}-axis directions.\n\nA normalized spinor for spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} in the {{math|(''u<sub>x</sub>'', ''u<sub>y</sub>'', ''u<sub>z</sub>'')}} direction (which works for all spin states except spin down where it will give {{sfrac|0|0}}), is:\n\n:<math> \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2+2u_z}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1+u_z \\\\ u_x+iu_y \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above spinor is obtained in the usual way by diagonalizing the {{mvar|σ<sub>u</sub>}} matrix and finding the eigenstates corresponding to the eigenvalues. In quantum mechanics, vectors are termed \"normalized\" when multiplied by a normalizing factor, which results in the vector having a length of unity.\n\n=== Compatibility of spin measurements ===\nSince the Pauli matrices do not [[commutativity|commute]], measurements of spin along the different axes are incompatible. This means that if, for example, we know the spin along the {{mvar|x}}-axis, and we then measure the spin along the {{mvar|y}}-axis, we have invalidated our previous knowledge of the {{mvar|x}}-axis spin. This can be seen from the property of the eigenvectors (i.e. eigenstates) of the Pauli matrices that:\n\n:<math> \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{x\\pm} \\mid \\psi_{y\\pm} \\rangle \\right\\vert ^ 2 = \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{x\\pm} \\mid \\psi_{z\\pm} \\rangle \\right\\vert ^ 2 = \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{y\\pm} \\mid \\psi_{z\\pm} \\rangle \\right\\vert ^ 2 = \\tfrac{1}{2}. </math>\n\nSo when [[physicist]]s measure the spin of a particle along the {{mvar|x}}-axis as, for example, {{math|{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}, the particle's spin state [[wavefunction collapse|collapses]] into the eigenstate <math display=\"inline\"> \\mid \\psi_{x+} \\rangle</math>. When we then subsequently measure the particle's spin along the {{mvar|y}}-axis, the spin state will now collapse into either <math display=\"inline\"> \\mid \\psi_{y+} \\rangle</math> or <math display=\"inline\"> \\mid \\psi_{y-} \\rangle</math>, each with probability {{sfrac|1|2}}. Let us say, in our example, that we measure {{math|−{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}}. When we now return to measure the particle's spin along the {{mvar|x}}-axis again, the probabilities that we will measure {{math|{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} or {{math|−{{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}}} are each {{sfrac|1|2}} (i.e. they are <math display=\"inline\">  \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{x+} \\mid \\psi_{y-} \\rangle \\right\\vert ^ 2</math> and <math display=\"inline\"> \\left\\vert \\langle \\psi_{x-} \\mid \\psi_{y-} \\rangle \\right\\vert ^ 2 </math> respectively). This implies that the original measurement of the spin along the x-axis is no longer valid, since the spin along the {{mvar|x}}-axis will now be measured to have either eigenvalue with equal probability.\n\n===Higher spins===\n\nThe spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} operator {{math|'''S''' {{=}} {{sfrac|''ħ''|2}}'''σ'''}} forms the [[fundamental representation]] of [[Representation theory of SU(2)|SU(2)]]. By taking [[Kronecker product]]s of this representation with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations.  That is, the  resulting [[spin operator]]s for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions, for arbitrarily large {{mvar|s}},  can be calculated using this [[spin operator]] and [[Ladder operator#Angular momentum|ladder operators]].\n\nThe resulting spin matrices and eigenvalues in the z-basis\n\n# For spin 1 they are\n#:<math>\\begin{align}\n                         S_x &= \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\n                           \\begin{pmatrix}\n                             0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n                             1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n                             0 & 1 & 0\n                           \\end{pmatrix}, & \n  \\left|1, +1\\right\\rangle_x &= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}{1}\\\\{\\sqrt{2}}\\\\{1}\\end{pmatrix},  &\n  \\left|1,  0\\right\\rangle_x &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix}{-1}\\\\{0}\\\\{1}\\end{pmatrix}, &\n  \\left|1, -1\\right\\rangle_x &= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}{1}\\\\{-\\sqrt{2}}\\\\{1}\\end{pmatrix}  \\\\\n                         S_y &= \\frac{\\hbar}{\\sqrt{2}}\n                           \\begin{pmatrix}\n                             0 & -i  &  0 \\\\\n                             i &  0  & -i \\\\\n                             0 &  i  &  0\n                           \\end{pmatrix}, & \n  \\left|1, +1\\right\\rangle_y &= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ -i\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}, &\n  \\left|1,  0\\right\\rangle_y &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix},    &\n  \\left|1, -1\\right\\rangle_y &= \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\  i\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}  \\\\\n                         S_z &= \\hbar\n                           \\begin{pmatrix}\n                             1 & 0 &  0 \\\\\n                             0 & 0 &  0 \\\\\n                             0 & 0 & -1\n                           \\end{pmatrix}, & \n  \\left|1, +1\\right\\rangle_z &= \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, &\n  \\left|1,  0\\right\\rangle_z &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, &\n  \\left|1, -1\\right\\rangle_z &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}  \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n# For spin {{sfrac|3|2}} they are\n#: <math>\n\\begin{array}{lclc}\n  S_x = \\frac\\hbar2\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0        &\\sqrt{3} &0        &0\\\\\n      \\sqrt{3} &0        &2        &0\\\\\n      0        &2        &0        &\\sqrt{3}\\\\\n      0        &0        &\\sqrt{3} &0\n    \\end{pmatrix}, \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!

This refers to the [[Parity (physics)|parity]] with \"+\" for even parity (wave function unchanged by spatial inversion) and \"−\" for odd parity (wave function negated by spatial inversion). For example, see the [[isotopes of bismuth]] in which the List of isotopes includes the column Nuclear spin and parity. For Bi-209, the only stable isotope, the entry 9/2– means that the nuclear spin is 9/2 and the parity is odd.\n\n== Applications ==\nSpin has important theoretical implications and practical applications. Well-established ''direct'' applications of spin include:\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy in chemistry;\n* [[Electron spin resonance]] spectroscopy in chemistry and physics;\n* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) in medicine, a type of applied NMR, which relies on proton spin density;\n* [[Giant magnetoresistive effect|Giant magnetoresistive]] (GMR) drive head technology in modern [[hard disk]]s.\n\nElectron spin plays an important role in [[magnetism]], with applications for instance in computer memories. The manipulation of ''nuclear spin'' by radiofrequency waves ([[nuclear magnetic resonance]]) is important in chemical spectroscopy and medical imaging.\n\n[[Spin-orbit coupling]] leads to the [[fine structure]] of atomic spectra, which is used in [[atomic clock]]s and in the modern definition of the [[second]]. Precise measurements of the {{mvar|g}}-factor of the electron have played an important role in the development and verification of [[quantum electrodynamics]]. ''Photon spin'' is associated with the [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light.\n\nAn emerging application of spin is as a binary information carrier in [[spin transistor]]s. The original concept, proposed in 1990, is known as Datta-Das spin transistor.<ref>{{cite journal| doi =  10.1063/1.102730| author =  Datta. S and B.

In 1924 [[Wolfgang Ernst Pauli|Wolfgang Pauli]] introduced what he called a \"two-valuedness not describable classically\"<ref>{{cite-web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1945/pauli/lecture/ |author=Wolfgang Pauli |title=Exclusion Principle and Quantum Mechanics |date=December 13, 1946 |work=Nobel Lecture |publisher=[[Nobel Prize]]}}</ref> associated with the electron in the outermost [[electron shell|shell]]. This allowed him to formulate the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], stating that no two electrons can have the same [[quantum state]] in the same quantum system.\n\nThe physical interpretation of Pauli's \"degree of freedom\" was initially unknown. [[Ralph Kronig]], one of [[Alfred Landé|Landé]]'s assistants, suggested in early 1925 that it was produced by the self-rotation of the electron. When Pauli heard about the idea, he criticized it severely, noting that the electron's hypothetical surface would have to be moving faster than the [[speed of light]] in order for it to rotate quickly enough to produce the necessary angular momentum. This would violate the [[theory of relativity]]. Largely due to Pauli's criticism, Kronig decided not to publish his idea.\n\nIn the autumn of 1925, the same thought came to two Dutch physicists, [[George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Goudsmit]] at [[Leiden University]]. Under the advice of [[Paul Ehrenfest]], they published their results. It met a favorable response, especially after [[Llewellyn Thomas]] managed to resolve a factor-of-two discrepancy between experimental results and Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit's calculations (and Kronig's unpublished results). This discrepancy was due to the orientation of the electron's tangent frame, in addition to its position.\n\nMathematically speaking, a [[fiber bundle]] description is needed. The [[tangent bundle]] effect is additive and relativistic; that is, it vanishes if {{mvar|c}} goes to infinity. It is one half of the value obtained without regard for the tangent space orientation, but with opposite sign. Thus the combined effect differs from the latter by a factor two ([[Thomas precession]], known to [[Ludwik Silberstein]] in 1914).\n\nDespite his initial objections, Pauli formalized the theory of spin in 1927, using the modern theory of [[quantum mechanics]] invented by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]] and [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]. He pioneered the use of [[Pauli matrices]] as a [[group representation|representation]] of the spin operators, and introduced a two-component [[spinor]] wave-function.\n\nPauli's theory of spin was non-relativistic. However, in 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] published the [[Dirac equation]], which described the relativistic [[electron]]. In the Dirac equation, a four-component spinor (known as a \"[[Dirac spinor]]\") was used for the electron wave-function. Relativistic spin explained gyromagnetic anomaly, which was (in retrospect) first observed by [[Samuel Jackson Barnett]] in 1914 (see [[Einstein–de Haas effect]]). In 1940, Pauli proved the ''[[spin-statistics theorem]]'', which states that [[fermion]]s have half-integer spin and [[boson]]s have integer spin.\n\nIn retrospect, the first direct experimental evidence of the electron spin was the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] of 1922. However, the correct explanation of this experiment was only given in 1927.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author=B. Friedrich, D.

      "text": "{{Short description|Magnetic moment derived from particle spin}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2016}}\n{{quantum mechanics}}\n{{main article|magnetic moment}}\n\nIn physics, mainly [[quantum mechanics]] and [[particle physics]], a '''spin magnetic moment''' is the [[magnetic moment]] caused by the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of [[elementary particles]]. For example, the [[electron]] is an elementary [[spin-1/2]] [[fermion]]. [[Quantum electrodynamics]] gives the most accurate prediction of the [[anomalous magnetic moment#Electron|anomalous magnetic moment of the electron]].\n\n\"Spin\" is a non-classical property of elementary particles, since [[classical mechanics|classically]] the \"spin angular momentum\" of a material object is really just the total ''orbital'' [[angular momentum|angular momenta]] of the object's constituents about the rotation axis. [[Elementary particle]]s are conceived as concepts which have no axis to \"spin\" around (see [[wave–particle duality]]).\n\nIn general, a [[magnetic moment]] can be defined in terms of an [[electric current]] and the area enclosed by the [[current loop]]. Since angular momentum corresponds to rotational motion, the magnetic moment can be related to the orbital angular momentum of the [[charge carrier]]s in the constituting current. However, in [[magnetic material]]s, the atomic and molecular dipoles have magnetic moments not just because of their [[angular momentum (quantum mechanics)|quantized orbital angular momentum]], but, due to the spin of elementary particles constituting them (electrons, and the [[quark]]s in the [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s of the [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]]). A particle may have a spin magnetic moment without having an [[electric charge]]. For example, the [[neutron]] is electrically neutral but has a non-zero magnetic moment because of its internal quark structure.\n\n==Calculation==\n\nWe can calculate the observable spin magnetic moment, a vector, ''{{vec|&mu;}}''<sub>S</sub>, for a sub-atomic particle with charge ''q'', mass ''m'', and [[spin (physics)|spin angular momentum]] (also a vector), {{vec|''S''}}, via:<ref group=n>{{cite book|author1=Y.

The ''g''-factor depends on the particle: it is ''g'' = −2.0023 for the [[electron]], ''g'' = 5.586 for the [[proton]], and {{nowrap|1=''g'' = −3.826}} for the [[neutron]]. The proton and neutron are composed of [[quarks]], which have a non-zero charge and a spin of ''ħ''/2, and this must be taken into account when calculating their g-factors. Even though the neutron has a charge {{nowrap|1=''q'' = 0}}, its quarks give it a [[neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment]]. The proton and electron's spin magnetic moments can be calculated by setting {{nowrap|1=''q'' = +''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = −''e''}}, respectively, where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge]].\n\nThe intrinsic [[electron magnetic dipole moment]] is approximately equal to the [[Bohr magneton]] ''μ''<sub>B</sub> because {{nowrap|''g'' ≈ −2}} and the electron's spin is also ''ħ''/2:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\mu_\\text{S}\\approx -2\\frac{-e}{2m_\\text{e}}\\frac{\\hbar}{2}=\\mu_\\text{B}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nEquation ({{EquationNote|1}}) is therefore normally written as<ref group=n>{{cite book|title=Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and Particles|edition=2nd|page=274|author1=R.

Equations ({{EquationNote|1}}), ({{EquationNote|2}}), ({{EquationNote|3}}) give the [[Observable|physical observable]], that component of the magnetic moment measured along an axis, relative to or along the applied field direction. Assuming a [[Cartesian coordinate system]], conventionally, the ''z''-axis is chosen but the observable values of the component of spin angular momentum along all three axes are each ±''ħ''/2. However, in order to obtain the magnitude of the total spin angular momentum, {{vec|''S''}} be replaced by its [[eigenvalue]], {{sqrt|''s''(''s'' + 1)}}, where ''s'' is the [[spin quantum number]]. In turn, calculation of the magnitude of the total spin magnetic moment requires that ({{EquationNote|3}}) be replaced by:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math> |\\vec{\\mu}_\\text{S}| = g \\mu_\\text{B} \\sqrt{s(s + 1)} </math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThus, for a single electron, with spin quantum number {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 1/2}}, the component of the magnetic moment along the field direction is, from ({{EquationNote|3}}), {{nowrap|1={{abs|''{{vec|&mu;}}''<sub>S,z</sub>}} = ''&mu;''<sub>B</sub>}}, while the (magnitude of the) total spin magnetic moment is, from ({{EquationNote|4}}), {{nowrap|1={{abs|''{{vec|&mu;}}''<sub>S</sub>}} = {{sqrt|3}} ''&mu;''<sub>B</sub>}}, or approximately 1.73 Bohr magnetons.\n\nThe analysis is readily extended to the spin-only magnetic moment of an atom.  For example, the total spin magnetic moment (sometimes referred to as the ''effective magnetic moment'' when the orbital moment contribution to the total magnetic moment is neglected) of a [[transition metal]] [[ion]] with a single [[d shell]] electron outside of closed [[Electron shell|shell]]s (e.g. [[Titanium]] Ti<sup>3+</sup>) is 1.73 ''μ''<sub>B</sub> since {{nowrap|1=''s'' = 1/2}}, while an atom with two unpaired electrons (e.g. [[Vanadium]] V<sup>3+</sup>) with {{nowrap|1=''S'' = 1}} would have an effective magnetic moment of {{nowrap|2.83 ''μ''<sub>B</sub>}}.\n\n==Spin in chemistry==\n\n{{main article|Quantum chemistry}}\n\nSpin magnetic moments create a basis for one of the most important principles in chemistry, the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. This principle, first suggested by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], governs most of modern-day chemistry. The theory plays further roles than just the explanations of [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]]s within [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This additional quantum number, spin, became the basis for the modern [[standard model]] used today, which includes the use of [[List of Hund's rules|Hund's rules]], and an explanation of [[beta decay]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea of a spin angular momentum was first proposed in a 1925 publication by [[George Eugene Uhlenbeck|George Uhlenbeck]] and [[Samuel Abraham Goudsmit|Samuel Goudsmit]] to explain [[hyperfine splitting]] in atomic spectra.<ref group=n>Earlier the same year, [[Ralph Kronig]] discussed the idea with [[Wolfgang Pauli]], but Pauli criticized the idea so severely that Kronig decided not to publish it.{{harv|Scerri|1995}}</ref> In 1928, [[Paul Dirac]] provided a rigorous theoretical foundation for the concept in the [[Dirac equation]] for the [[wavefunction]] of the [[electron]].<ref group=n>{{harv|Dirac|1928}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Nuclear magneton]]\n*[[Pauli exclusion principle]]\n*[[Nuclear magnetic resonance]]\n*[[Multipole expansion]]\n*[[Relativistic quantum mechanics]]\n*[[Magnetic spin vortex disc]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Selected books===\n*{{cite book| author=B.

The spin-weighted harmonics are organized by degree {{mvar|l}}, just like ordinary spherical harmonics, but have an additional '''spin weight''' {{mvar|s}} that reflects the additional {{math|U(1)}} symmetry.  A special basis of harmonics can be derived from the Laplace spherical harmonics {{math|''Y''<sub>''lm''</sub>}}, and are typically denoted by {{math|<sub>''s''</sub>''Y''<sub>''lm''</sub>}}, where {{mvar|l}} and {{mvar|m}} are the usual parameters familiar from the standard Laplace spherical harmonics.  In this special basis, the spin-weighted spherical harmonics appear as actual functions, because the choice of a polar axis fixes the {{math|U(1)}} gauge ambiguity.

At a point {{math|'''x'''}} on the sphere, a positively oriented [[orthonormal basis]] of [[tangent vector]]s at {{math|'''x'''}} is a pair {{math|'''a''', '''b'''}} of vectors such that\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} &= 0\\\\\n\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} &= 1\\\\\n\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} &= 0\\\\\n\\mathbf{x}\\cdot (\\mathbf{a}\\times\\mathbf{b}) &> 0,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere the first pair of equations states that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are tangent at {{math|'''x'''}}, the second pair states that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are [[unit vector]]s, the penultimate equation that {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}} are [[orthogonal]], and the final equation that {{math|('''x''', '''a''', '''b''')}} is a right-handed basis of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.\n\nA spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function {{mvar|f}} is a function accepting as input a point {{math|'''x'''}} of {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}} and a positively oriented orthonormal basis of tangent vectors at {{math|'''x'''}}, such that\n:<math>f\\bigl(\\mathbf x,(\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{a}-(\\sin\\theta)\\mathbf{b}, (\\sin\\theta)\\mathbf{a} + (\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{b}\\bigr) = e^{is\\theta}f(\\mathbf x,\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b})</math>\nfor every rotation angle {{mvar|θ}}.\n\nFollowing {{harvtxt|Eastwood|Tod|1982}}, denote the collection of all spin-weight {{mvar|s}} functions by {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}}.  Concretely, these are understood as functions {{mvar|f}} on {{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>\\{0}}} satisfying the following homogeneity law under complex scaling\n:<math>f\\left(\\lambda z,\\overline{\\lambda}\\bar{z}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\overline{\\lambda}}{\\lambda}\\right)^s f\\left(z,\\bar{z}\\right).</math>\nThis makes sense provided {{mvar|s}} is a half-integer.\n\nAbstractly, {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}} is [[isomorphic]] to the smooth [[vector bundle]] underlying the [[antiholomorphic]] vector bundle {{math|{{overline|'''O'''(2''s'')}}}} of the [[Serre twist]] on the [[complex projective line]] {{math|'''CP'''<sup>1</sup>}}.  A section of the latter bundle is a function {{mvar|g}} on {{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>\\{0}}} satisfying\n:<math>g\\left(\\lambda z,\\overline{\\lambda}\\bar{z}\\right) = \\overline{\\lambda}^{2s} g\\left(z,\\bar{z}\\right).</math>\nGiven such a {{mvar|g}}, we may produce a spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function by multiplying by a suitable power of the hermitian form\n:<math>P\\left(z,\\bar{z}\\right) = z\\cdot\\bar{z}.</math>\nSpecifically, {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''P''<sup>−''s''</sup>''g''}} is a spin-weight {{mvar|s}} function.  The association of a spin-weighted function to an ordinary homogeneous function is an isomorphism.\n\n===The operator {{mvar|ð}}===\nThe spin weight bundles {{math|'''B'''(''s'')}} are equipped with a [[differential operator]] {{mvar|ð}} ([[eth]]).  This operator is essentially the [[Dolbeault operator]], after suitable identifications have been made,\n:<math>\\partial : \\overline{\\mathbf O(2s)} \\to \\mathcal{E}^{1,0}\\otimes \\overline{\\mathbf O(2s)} \\cong \\overline{\\mathbf O(2s)}\\otimes\\mathbf{O}(-2).</math>\nThus for {{math|''f'' ∈ '''B'''(''s'')}},\n:<math>\\eth f \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ P^{-s+1}\\partial \\left(P^s f\\right) </math>\ndefines a function of spin-weight {{math|''s'' + 1}}.\n\n==Spin-weighted harmonics==\nJust as conventional spherical harmonics are the [[eigenfunction]]s of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator]] on the sphere, the spin-weight {{mvar|s}} harmonics are the eigensections for the Laplace-Beltrami operator acting on the bundles {{math|{{mathcal|E}}(''s'')}} of spin-weight {{mvar|s}} functions.\n       \n==Representation as functions==\nThe spin-weighted harmonics can be represented as functions on a sphere once a point on the sphere has been selected to serve as the North pole.  By definition, a function {{mvar|η}} with ''spin weight {{mvar|s}}'' transforms under rotation about the pole via\n:<math>\\eta \\rightarrow e^{i s \\psi}\\eta.</math>\n\nWorking in standard spherical coordinates, we can define a particular operator {{mvar|ð}} acting on a function {{mvar|η}} as:\n:<math>\\eth\\eta =  - \\left(\\sin{\\theta}\\right)^s \\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} + \\frac{i}{\\sin{\\theta}} \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial \\phi} \\right\\} \\left[ \\left(\\sin{\\theta}\\right)^{-s} \\eta \\right].</math>\nThis gives us another function of {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}}. (The operator {{mvar|ð}} is effectively a [[covariant derivative]] operator in the sphere.)\n\nAn important property of the new function {{mvar|ðη}} is that if {{mvar|η}} had spin weight {{mvar|s}}, {{mvar|ðη}} has spin weight {{math|''s'' + 1}}.  Thus, the operator raises the spin weight of a function by 1.  Similarly, we can define an operator {{mvar|{{overline|ð}}}} which will lower the spin weight of a function by 1:\n:<math>\\bar\\eth\\eta =  - \\left(\\sin{\\theta}\\right)^{-s} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{i}{\\sin{\\theta}} \\frac{\\partial} {\\partial \\phi} \\right\\} \\left[ \\left(\\sin{\\theta}\\right)^{s} \\eta \\right].</math>\n\nThe spin-weighted spherical harmonics are then defined in terms of the usual [[spherical harmonics]] as:\n:<math>\n{}_sY_{l m} = \\begin{cases}\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(l-s)!}{(l+s)!}}\\ \\eth^s Y_{l m},&& 0\\leq s \\leq l; \\\\\n\\sqrt{\\frac{(l+s)!}{(l-s)!}}\\ \\left(-1\\right)^s \\bar\\eth^{-s} Y_{l m},&& -l\\leq s \\leq 0; \\\\\n0,&&l < |s|.\\end{cases}</math>\nThe functions {{math|<sub>''s''</sub>''Y''<sub>''lm''</sub>}} then have the property of transforming with spin weight {{mvar|s}}.\n\nOther important properties include the following:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\eth\\left({}_sY_{l m}\\right)     &= +\\sqrt{(l-s)(l+s+1)}\\, {}_{s+1}Y_{l m};\\\\\n\\bar\\eth\\left({}_sY_{l m}\\right) &= -\\sqrt{(l+s)(l-s+1)}\\, {}_{s-1}Y_{l m};\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Orthogonality and completeness ==\nThe harmonics are orthogonal over the entire sphere:\n:<math>\\int_{S^2} {}_sY_{l m}\\, {}_s\\bar{Y}_{l'm'}\\, dS = \\delta_{ll'} \\delta_{mm'}, </math>\nand satisfy the completeness relation\n:<math>\\sum_{l m} {}_s\\bar Y_{l m}\\left(\\theta',\\phi'\\right) {}_s Y_{l m}(\\theta,\\phi) = \\delta\\left(\\phi'-\\phi\\right)\\delta\\left(\\cos\\theta'-\\cos\\theta\\right)</math>\n\n==Calculating==\nThese harmonics can be explicitly calculated by several methods.  The obvious recursion relation results from repeatedly applying the raising or lowering operators.  Formulae for direct calculation were derived by {{harvtxt|Goldberg|Macfarlane|Newman|Rohlich|1967}}.  Note that their formulae use an old choice for the [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Condon-ShortleyPhase.html Condon–Shortley phase].  The convention chosen below is in agreement with Mathematica, for instance.\n\nThe more useful of the Goldberg, et al., formulae is the following:\n:<math>{}_sY_{l m} (\\theta, \\phi) = \\left(-1\\right)^m \\sqrt{ \\frac{(l+m)! (l-m)! (2l+1)} {4\\pi (l+s)! (l-s)!} } \\sin^{2l} \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\times\\sum_{r=0}^{l-s} {l-s \\choose r} {l+s \\choose r+s-m} \\left(-1\\right)^{l-r-s} e^{i m \\phi} \\cot^{2r+s-m} \\left( \\frac{\\theta} {2} \\right)\\, .</math>\n\nA Mathematica notebook using this formula to calculate arbitrary spin-weighted spherical harmonics can be found [http://www.black-holes.org/SpinWeightedSphericalHarmonics.nb here].\n\nWith the phase convention here:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n{}_s\\bar Y_{l m} &= \\left(-1\\right)^{s+m}{}_{-s}Y_{l(-m)}\\\\\n{}_sY_{l m}(\\pi-\\theta,\\phi+\\pi) &= \\left(-1\\right)^l {}_{-s}Y_{l m}(\\theta,\\phi).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== First few spin-weighted spherical harmonics ==\n\nAnalytic expressions for the first few orthonormalized spin-weighted spherical harmonics:\n\n=== Spin-weight {{math|''s'' {{=}} 1}}, degree {{math|''l'' {{=}} 1}} ===\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n{}_1 Y_{10}(\\theta,\\phi)     &=  \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{8\\pi}}\\,\\sin\\theta \\\\\n{}_1 Y_{1\\pm 1}(\\theta,\\phi) &= -\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{16\\pi}}(1 \\mp \\cos\\theta)\\,e^{\\pm i\\phi}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Relation to Wigner rotation matrices ==\n\n:<math>D^l_{-m s}(\\phi,\\theta,-\\psi) =\\left(-1\\right)^m \\sqrt\\frac{4\\pi}{2l+1} {}_sY_{l m}(\\theta,\\phi) e^{is\\psi}</math>\n\nThis relation allows the spin harmonics to be calculated using recursion relations for the [[Wigner D-matrix|{{mvar|D}}-matrices]].\n\n== Triple integral ==\n\nThe triple integral in the case that {{math|''s''<sub>1</sub> + ''s''<sub>2</sub> + ''s''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} 0}} is given in terms of the [[3-j symbol|3-{{mvar|j}} symbol]]:\n:<math>\\int_{S^2} \\,{}_{s_1} Y_{j_1 m_1}\n\\,{}_{s_2} Y_{j_2m_2}\\, {}_{s_3} Y_{j_3m_3} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\left(2j_1+1\\right)\\left(2j_2+1\\right)\\left(2j_3+1\\right)}{4\\pi}}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  j_1 & j_2 & j_3\\\\\n  m_1 & m_2 & m_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  j_1 & j_2 & j_3\\\\\n  -s_1 & -s_2 & -s_3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Spherical basis]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{citation | title = The relationship between monopole harmonics and spin-weighted spherical harmonics | first = Tevian | last=Dray | journal = J.

Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.\n\nThe modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the \"Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]\" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the \"[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]\" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.<ref>Joseph A.

In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or \"Yellow River diagram\" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the \"Great Monad\",<ref>Labelled \"The Great Monad\" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]</ref> and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the \"yin-yang symbol\" since the 1960s.<ref>\"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.)

Strictly speaking, the \"yin and yang symbol\", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.\n\n*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')\n*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.\n*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).\n*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the \"ten thousand things\". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').\n*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  \"The ten thousand things are born by transformation\" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}\nThe term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple \"divided circle\" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].\n\n=== Song era ===\nWhile the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,<ref>in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).</ref>\nthe interest in \"diagrams\" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again\nin the Ming period, by the 16th century.<ref name=\"Adler152\">Joseph A.

The replica of the [[Khodoriv|Chodorow]] [[Synagogue]] from Poland (on display at the [[Beth Hatefutsoth|Museum of the Jewish Diaspora]] in [[Tel Aviv]]) has a ceiling with a large central painting which depicts a double-headed eagle holds two brown rabbits in its claws without harming them. The painting is surrounded by a citation from the end of [[Deuteronomy]]:\n\n{{quote|\n:.כנשר יעיר קינו על גוזליו ירחף. יפרוש כנפיו יקחהו ישאהו על אברתו\n|Deuteronomy 32:11, [[The Song of Moses]]}}\n\nThis may be translated: \"As an eagle that stirreth up her nest, hovereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her pinions  (...thus is [[God]] to the Jewish people).\"<ref name=\"Wonnenberg\"/>\n\nThe hare frequently appears in the form of the symbol of the \"rotating rabbits\". An ancient German [[riddle]] describes this graphic thus:\n\n{{quote|<poem>Three hares sharing three ears,\nYet every one of them has two.<ref name=\"Wonnenberg\"/></poem>}}\n\nThis curious graphic riddle can be found in all of the famous [[wooden synagogues]] from the period of the 17th and 18th century in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashknaz]] region (in Germany) that are on museum display in [[Beth Hatefutsoth]] Museum in Tel Aviv, the [[Jewish Museum Berlin]] and The [[Israel Museum]] in Jerusalem. They also appear in the Synagogue from [[Horb am Neckar]] (donated to the Israel Museum). The three animals adorn the wooden panels of the prayer room from [[Unterlimpurg]] near [[Schwäbisch Hall]], which may be seen in replica in the Jewish Museum Berlin. They also are seen in a main exhibit of the Diaspora Museum in Tel Aviv. Israeli art historian Ida Uberman wrote about this house of worship: \"... Here we find depictions of three kinds of animals, all organized in circles: eagles, fishes and hares. These three represent the Kabbalistic elements of the world: earth, water and fire/heavens...

It is particularly important for systems at atomic length scales, such as individual [[atoms]], [[protons]], or [[electrons]].\n\nAlmost all molecules encountered in daily life exist in a [[singlet state]], but [[molecular oxygen]] is an exception.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Borden |first1=Weston Thatcher |last2=Hoffmann |first2=Roald |last3=Stuyver |first3=Thijs |last4=Chen |first4=Bo |date=2017 |title=Dioxygen: What Makes This Triplet Diradical Kinetically Persistent? |journal=JACS |volume=139|issue=26 |pages=9010–9018 |doi=10.1021/jacs.7b04232 |pmid=28613073 }}</ref> At [[room temperature]], O<sub>2</sub> exists in a triplet state, which can only undergo a chemical reaction by making the [[forbidden transition]] into a singlet state. This makes it kinetically nonreactive despite being thermodynamically a strong oxidant. Photochemical or thermal activation can bring it into the [[Singlet oxygen|singlet state]], which makes it kinetically as well as thermodynamically a strong oxidant.\n\n__TOC__\n\n== Two spin-1/2 particles ==\nIn a system with two spin-1/2 particles - for example the proton and electron in the ground state of hydrogen, measured on a given axis, each particle can be either spin up or spin down so the system has four basis states in all\n\n:<math>\\uparrow\\uparrow,\\uparrow\\downarrow,\\downarrow\\uparrow,\\downarrow\\downarrow</math>\n\nusing the single particle spins to label the basis states, where the first arrow and second arrow in each combination indicate the spin direction of the first particle and second particle respectively.\n\nMore rigorously\n\n:<math>\n|s_1,m_1\\rangle|s_2,m_2\\rangle=|s_1,m_1\\rangle\\otimes|s_2,m_2\\rangle,\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>s_1</math> and <math>s_2</math> are the spins of the two particles, and <math>m_1</math> and <math>m_2</math> are their projections onto the z-axis.  Since for spin-1/2 particles, the <math>|1/2,m\\rangle</math> basis states span a 2-dimensional space, the <math>|1/2,m_1\\rangle|1/2,m_2\\rangle</math> basis states span a 4-dimensional space.\n\nNow the total spin and its projection onto the previously defined axis can be computed using the rules for adding angular momentum in [[quantum mechanics]] using the [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]]. In general\n\n:<math>|s,m\\rangle = \\sum_{m_1+m_2=m}C_{m_1m_2m}^{s_1s_2s}|s_1m_1\\rangle|s_2m_2\\rangle</math>\n\nsubstituting in the four basis states\n\n:<math> |1/2,+1/2\\rangle\\;|1/2,+1/2\\rangle\\ (\\uparrow\\uparrow)</math>\n\n:<math> |1/2,+1/2\\rangle\\;|1/2,-1/2\\rangle\\ (\\uparrow\\downarrow)</math>\n\n:<math> |1/2,-1/2\\rangle\\;|1/2,+1/2\\rangle\\ (\\downarrow\\uparrow)</math>\n\n:<math> |1/2,-1/2\\rangle\\;|1/2,-1/2\\rangle\\ (\\downarrow\\downarrow)</math>\n\nreturns the possible values for total spin given along with their representation in the <math>|1/2,\\ m_1\\rangle|1/2,\\ m_2\\rangle</math> basis. There are three states with total spin angular momentum 1\n\n:<math>\n\\left.\\begin{array}{ll}\n|1,1\\rangle & =\\;\\uparrow\\uparrow\\\\\n|1,0\\rangle & =\\;(\\uparrow\\downarrow + \\downarrow\\uparrow)/\\sqrt2\\\\\n|1,-1\\rangle & =\\;\\downarrow\\downarrow\n\\end{array}\\right\\}\\quad s=1\\quad\\mathrm{(triplet)}\n</math>\nwhich are symmetric and a fourth state with total spin angular momentum 0\n\n:<math>\\left.|0,0\\rangle=(\\uparrow\\downarrow - \\downarrow\\uparrow)/\\sqrt2\\;\\right\\}\\quad s=0\\quad\\mathrm{(singlet)}</math>\nwhich is antisymmetric. The result is that a combination of two spin-1/2 particles can carry a total spin of 1 or 0, depending on whether they occupy a triplet or singlet state.\n\n== A mathematical viewpoint ==\n\nIn terms of representation theory, what has happened is that the two conjugate 2-dimensional spin representations of the spin group SU(2)=Spin(3) (as it sits inside the 3-dimensional Clifford algebra) have tensored to produce a 4 dimensional representation. The 4 dimensional representation descends to the usual orthogonal group SO(3) and so its objects are tensors, corresponding to the integrality of their spin.  The 4 dimensional representation decomposes into the sum of a one-dimensional trivial representation (singlet, a scalar, spin zero) and a three-dimensional representation (triplet, spin 1) that is nothing more than the standard representation of SO(3) on <math>R^3</math>. Thus the \"three\" in triplet can be identified with the three rotation axes of physical space.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Singlet state]]\n* [[Doublet state]]\n* [[Diradical]]\n* [[Angular momentum]]\n* [[Pauli matrices]]\n* [[Spin multiplicity]]\n* [[Spin quantum number]]\n* [[Spin-1/2]]\n* [[Spin tensor]]\n* [[Spinor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J.|title=Introduction to Quantum Mechanics|edition=2nd | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-13-111892-8}}\n*{{cite book | author=Shankar, R. | title=Principles of Quantum Mechanics | edition=2nd | publisher=Springer| date=1994 |isbn=978-0-306-44790-7 |chapter=chapter 14-Spin}}\n\n[[Category:Quantum mechanics]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Spectroscopy]]"

It is therefore a type of [[polyptych]], the term for all multi-panel works. The middle panel is typically the largest and it is flanked by two smaller related works, although there are triptychs of equal-sized panels. The form can also be used for [[pendant]] jewelry.\n\nDespite its connection to an art format, the term is sometimes used more generally to connote anything with three parts, particularly if they are integrated into a single unit.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/triptych |title=Triptych |quote=Although triptych originally described a specific type of Roman writing tablet that had three hinged sections, it is not surprising that the idea was generalized first to a type of painting, and then to anything composed of three parts. |work=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In art==\n[[File:Klosterneuburg - Stift, Verduner Altar (1).JPG|thumb|The Verdun Altar in [[Klosterneuburg Monastery]]]]\nThe triptych form arises from early Christian art, and was a popular standard format for altar paintings from the Middle Ages onwards. Its geographical range was from the eastern [[Byzantine]] churches to the Celtic churches in the west. During the Byzantine period, triptychs were often used for private devotional use, along with other relics such as icons.<ref>2014. ''History of the World in 1,000 Objects.''London, New York. [[Dorling Kindersley|D.K. Publishing]].</ref> Renaissance painters such as [[Hans Memling]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]] used the form. Sculptors also used it. Triptych forms also allow ease of transport.\n\nFrom the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] period onward, both in Europe and elsewhere, altarpieces in churches and cathedrals were often in triptych form. One such cathedral with an altarpiece triptych is [[Llandaff Cathedral]]. The [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Our Lady]] in [[Antwerp (city)|Antwerp]], Belgium, contains two examples by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]] is another example of the use of triptych in architecture. The form is echoed by the structure of many ecclesiastical [[stained glass window]]s. Although strongly identified as an [[altarpiece]] form, triptychs outside that context have been created, some of the best-known examples being works by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], [[Max Beckmann]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].\n\nThe then highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was $142.4 million for a 1969 triptych, ''[[Three Studies of Lucian Freud]]'', by [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in November 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Carol|title=Bacon's Study of Freud Sells for $142.4 Million|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 12, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/arts/design/bacons-study-of-freud-sells-for-more-than-142-million.html|accessdate=November 12, 2013}}</ref> The record was broken in May 2015 by $179.4 million for [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1955 painting ''[[Les Femmes d'Alger|Les Femmes d’Alger]]''.<ref>[https://digg.com/2015/modigliani-nu-couche-140-million A History Of Insane Art Prices] Digg.com Retrieved 16 November 2015.</ref>\n\nThe format has migrated and been used in other religions, including [[Islam]] and [[Buddhism]]. For example: the triptych ''Hilje-j-Sherif'' displayed at the [[National Museum of Oriental Art]], Rome, Italy, and a page of the ''[[Qur'an]]'' at the [[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum|Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts]] in Istanbul, Turkey, exemplify [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] religious art adapting the motif.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Museum With No Frontiers]] |publisher=Museum With No Frontiers, Arab Institute for Research and Publishing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gA3dSlLBG38C&pg=PA258&lpg=PA258&dq=islamic+triptych&source=bl&ots=sCWXu3Zrse&sig=Hm07LC4FwEbcecVNBxv6KRSBkvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiD0ufi2eTRAhVB7YMKHSkICIgQ6AEIODAJ#v=onepage&q=islamic%20triptych&f=false |location=Brussels, Belgium, Beirut, Lebanon |year=2007 |title=Discover Islamic Art in the Mediterranean |page=258 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>  Likewise, Tibetan Buddhists have used it in traditional altars.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Tibetan-Buddhist-Altars-Gallery-Traditional/dp/1577314670/ref=pd_sim_14_1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=1577314670&pd_rd_r=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK&pd_rd_w=jTPLw&pd_rd_wg=Y0eb9&psc=1&refRID=5ZSFCH5ZDKR1R8YFWHXK |title=Tibetan Buddhist Altars: A Pop-Up Gallery of Traditional Art and Wisdom |type=Hardcover |first1=Tad |last1=Wise |first2=Robert |last2=Beers |first3=David A. |last3=Carter |publisher=[[New World Library]]  |date=August 25, 2004 |ISBN=978-1577314677 |accessdate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==In photography==\n[[File:Epilobium hirsutum - Seed head - Triptych.jpg|thumb|Modern photographic triptych]]\nA photographic triptych is a common style used in modern commercial artwork.

Also known as a \"Trinity Knot\" when parallel doubled-lines are in the graph, the design is used as a religious symbol adapted from ancient Pagan Celtic images by Christianity. It is similar to the [[valknut]], a Norse symbol.\n\n==Ancient usage==\n\n===Celtic art===\nThe triquetra is often found in [[insular art]], most notably metal work and in [[illuminated manuscript]]s like the ''[[Book of Kells]]''. It is also found in similar artwork on Celtic crosses and slabs from the early Christian period. The fact that the triquetra rarely stood alone in medieval Celtic art has cast reasonable doubt on its use as a primary symbol of belief. In manuscripts it is used primarily as a space filler or ornament in much more complex compositions, and in knotwork panels it is a design motif integrated with other design elements.  This widely recognised knot has been used as a singular symbol for the past two centuries by Celtic Christians, pagans and agnostics as a sign of special things and people that are threefold.<ref>Walker, Stephen (2001). \"[http://www.celtarts.com/in_search_of_meaning.htm In Search of Meaning]\", ''Dalriada Magazine''.</ref>\n\n===Japanese use===\nThe triquetra has been a known symbol in Japan called ''Musubi Mitsugashiwa''. Being one of the forms of the [[Aryan]] [[Ikshvaku dynasty|Iakšaku dynasty]] signs, it reached Japan with the dynasty's [[Kāśyapīya]] spreading technology and [[Buddhism]] via [[Kingdom of Khotan]], after which the Japanese sword [[katana]] is called, [[Chinese Buddhism|China]] and [[Korean Buddhism|Korea]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Germanic paganism===\nThe triquetra has been found on [[runestone]]s in Northern Europe and on early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] coins. It presumably had [[Germanic paganism|pagan]] religious meaning and it bears a resemblance to the ''[[valknut]]'', a symbol associated with [[Norse mythology]].\n\n===Christian use===\nThe symbol has been used in [[Christian Church|Christian]] tradition as a sign of the [[Trinity]] ([[God the Father|Father]], [[Jesus Christ|Son]] and [[Holy Spirit]]), especially since the Celtic revival of the 19th century. When modern designers began to display the triquetra as a stand-alone design, it recalled the three-leafed shamrock which was similarly offered as a Trinity symbol by Saint Patrick{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. \nIt has also been suggested that the triquetra has a similarity to the Christian [[Ichthys|Ιχθυς]] symbol. The triquetra has been used extensively on Christian sculpture, vestments, book arts and stained glass. It has been used on the title page and binding of some editions of the [[New King James Version]]{{examples|date=November 2014}}.\n\nA very common representation of the symbol is with a circle that goes through the three interconnected loops of the triquetra. The circle emphasises the unity of the whole combination of Three Persons. It is also said to symbolise [[God]]'s love around the Holy Trinity.\n\n==Modern use==\nIn contemporary Ireland, it is traditional for lovers to exchange jewelry such as a necklace or rings signifying their affection. The triquetra, also known as a \"trinity knot\", is often found as a design element is popular Irish jewelry such as [[Claddagh ring|claddaghs]] and other wedding or engagement rings.<ref>McMahon, Seán (1999).

[[Celtic neopaganism|Celtic pagans]], or even [[Neopaganism|neopagans]] who are not of a Celtic cultural orientation, may use the triquetra to symbolise a variety of concepts and mythological figures.\n\nDue to its presence in insular Celtic art, [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic Reconstructionists]] use the triquetra either to represent one of the various triplicities in their cosmology and theology (such as the tripartite division of the world into the realms of Land, Sea and Sky),<ref name=\"Mac Mathúna\">Mac Mathúna, Liam (1999) [http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c23/c23-174.pdf \"Irish Perceptions of the Cosmos\"] ''Celtica'' vol. 23 (1999), pp.174–187</ref> or as a symbol of one of the specific Celtic [[Triple deity|triple goddesses]], for example the battle goddess, [[The Morrígan]].\n\n[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic neopagan]] groups who use the triquetra to symbolise their faith generally believe it is originally of Norse and Germanic origins.\n\nThe symbol is also sometimes used by wiccans and some [[new age]]rs to symbolise the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]], or as a protective symbol.<ref name=\"scott-cunningham\">{{Citation |last=Cunningham |first=Scott |authorlink=Scott Cunningham |title=Wicca: A Guide to the Solitary Practitioner |year=2004 |origyear=1988 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN, U.S.A. |isbn=978-0-87542-118-6 |page=191 |chapter=Rune Magic}}.</ref>\n\n===Popular culture===\n<!-- Do not add more pop culture mentions here unless they are 1. sourced and 2.vplay a significant role in the symbology or identification of the referenced subject.

Many who identify as [[modern Celts]] may use the symbol to display an identification with [[Celtic Europe|Celtic culture]], whether they live in the [[Celtic Nations]] or the [[diaspora]].\n\n====In literature and publications====\n*The double triquetra is used to represent the Holy Trinity on the ''New King James Version'' [[Bibles]], published by Thomas Nelson, Inc\n\n====In Television====\n\n* The symbol is used as the official logo for the 1998–2006 TV series ''[[Charmed]]'' and its [[Charmed (2018 TV series)|2018 reboot series]]. The logo represents the \"[[Power of Three (Charmed)|Power of Three]]\", which is the bond and connection between the three sisters in both series.\n\n*[[Michonne]]'s [[katana]] in the TV series ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' features a triquetra on the inner [[crossguard]]. Custom-designed for the character, propmaster John Sanders intentionally chose the triquetra for its meaning as a triple goddess symbol.<ref name=EW>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/walking-dead-14-props-and-stories-behind-em/670478_michonnes-katana | title=Michonne's Katana | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=17 November 2013 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | author=Ross, Dalton |author2=Snetiker, Marc}}</ref><ref name=USAtoday>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2014/10/08/walkers-weapons-bees-at-amc-the-walking-dead/16886945/ | title=<nowiki>'</nowiki>The Walking Dead,' up close and personal | newspaper=[[USA Today]] | date=12 October 2014 | accessdate=30 October 2016 | last=Keveney | first=Bill | quote=We put a trinity on there – mind, body, soul.

The triple spiral motif is a [[Neolithic]] symbol in Western Europe. Though popularly considered a \"Celtic\" symbol, it is in fact a pre-Celtic symbol.<ref>Anthony Murphy and Richard Moore, ''Island of the Setting Sun: In Search of Ireland's Ancient Astronomers,'' 2nd ed., Dublin: The Liffey Press, 2008, pp. 168–169</ref> It is carved into the rock of a stone lozenge near the main entrance of the prehistoric [[Newgrange]] monument in [[County Meath]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

The symbol is also found [[petroglyph|carved in rock]] in [[Castro Culture]] settlement in modern-day [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Northern Portugal]]. In Ireland before the 5th century, in [[Celtic Christianity]] the triskele took on new meaning, as a symbol of the [[Trinity]] (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and therefore also a symbol of eternity.

Because symmetries of differential equations are essential to both physics and mathematics, the theory of special functions is closely related to the theory of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s, as well as certain topics in [[mathematical physics]].\n\n[[Computer algebra|Symbolic computation]] engines usually recognize the majority of special functions.\n\n===Notations used for special functions===\nFunctions with established international notations are the [[sine]] (<math>\\sin</math>), [[cosine]] (<math>\\cos</math>), [[exponential function]] (<math>\\exp</math>), and [[error function]] (<math>\\rm erf</math> or <math>\\rm erfc</math>).\n\nSome special functions have several notations:\n\n* The [[natural logarithm]] may be denoted <math>\\ln</math>, <math>\\log</math>, <math>\\log_e</math>, or <math>\\rm Log</math> depending on the context. \n* The [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tangent]] function may be denoted <math>\\tan</math>, <math>\\rm Tan</math>, or <math>\\rm tg</math> (<math>\\rm tg</math> is used in Russian and Bulgarian literature).\n* The [[arctangent]] may be denoted <math>\\arctan</math>, <math>\\rm atan</math>, <math>\\rm arctg</math>, or <math>\\tan^{-1}</math>.\n* The [[Bessel function]]s may be denoted\n** <math>~J_n(x),~</math>\n** <math>~{\\rm besselj}(n,x), ~</math>\n** <math>~ {\\rm BesselJ}[n,x].~</math>\n\nSubscripts are often used to indicate arguments, typically integers. In a few cases, the semicolon (;) or even backslash (\\) is used as a separator. In this case, the translation to algorithmic languages admits [[Ambiguity#Ambiguity in names of functions|ambiguity]] and may lead to confusion.\n\nSuperscripts may indicate not only exponentiation, but modification of a function. Examples (particularly with [[trigonometric function]]s and [[hyperbolic function]]s) include:\n\n* <math>~\\cos^3(x)~</math> usually indicates <math>~(\\cos(x))^3~</math>\n* <math>~\\cos^2(x)~</math> is typically <math>~(\\cos(x))^2~</math>, but never <math>~\\cos(\\cos(x))~</math>\n* <math>~\\cos^{-1}(x)~</math> usually means <math>~\\arccos(x)~</math>, and not <math>~(\\cos(x))^{-1}~</math>; this one typically causes the most confusion, since interpretation with this exponent value is inconsistent with the others.\n\n===Evaluation of special functions===\nMost special functions are considered as a function of a complex variable. They are [[analytic function|analytic]]; the singularities and cuts are described; the differential and integral representations are known and the expansion to the [[Taylor series]] or [[asymptotic series]] are available. In addition, sometimes there exist relations with other special functions; a complicated special function can be expressed in terms of simpler functions. Various representations can be used for the evaluation;  the simplest way to evaluate a function is to expand it into a Taylor series. However, such representation may converge slowly if at all. In algorithmic languages, [[Pade approximation|rational approximation]]s are typically used, although they may behave badly in the case of complex argument(s).\n\n==History of special functions==\n\n===Classical theory===\nWhile [[trigonometry]] can be codified{{snd}} as was clear already to expert mathematicians of the eighteenth century (if not before){{snd}} the search for a complete and unified theory of special functions has continued since the nineteenth century. The high point of special function theory in the period 1800-1900 was the theory of [[elliptic function]]s; treatises that were essentially complete, such as that of [[Tannery and Molk]], could be written as handbooks to all the basic identities of the theory. They were based on techniques from [[complex analysis]].\n\nFrom that time onwards it would be assumed that [[analytic function]] theory, which had already unified the trigonometric and [[exponential function]]s, was a fundamental tool. The end of the century also saw a very detailed discussion of [[spherical harmonic]]s.\n\n===Changing and fixed motivations===\nOf course the wish for a broad theory including as many as possible of the known special functions has its intellectual appeal, but it is worth noting other motivations.  For a long time, the special functions were in the particular province of [[applied mathematics]]; applications to the physical sciences and engineering determined the relative importance of functions. In the days before the [[electronic computer]], the ultimate compliment to a special function was the computation, by hand, of extended [[Mathematical table|tables of its values]]. This was a capital-intensive process, intended to make the function available by [[Look-up table|look-up]], as for the familiar [[logarithm tables]]. The aspects of the theory that then mattered might then be two:\n\n* for [[numerical analysis]], discovery of [[infinite series]] or other [[analytical expression]] allowing rapid calculation; and\n* reduction of as many functions as possible to the given function.\n\nIn contrast, one might say, there are approaches typical of the interests of [[pure mathematics]]: [[asymptotic analysis]], [[analytic continuation]] and [[monodromy]] in the [[complex plane]], and the discovery of [[symmetry]] principles and other structure behind the façade of endless formulae in rows.  There is not a real conflict between these approaches, in fact.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nThe twentieth century saw several waves of interest in special function theory.  The classic ''[[Whittaker and Watson]]'' (1902) textbook sought to unify the theory by using [[complex variable]]s; the [[G. N. Watson]] tome ''A Treatise on the Theory of Bessel Functions'' pushed the techniques as far as possible for one important type that particularly admitted asymptotics to be studied.\n\nThe later [[Bateman Manuscript Project]], under the editorship of [[Arthur Erdélyi]], attempted to be encyclopedic, and came around the time when electronic computation was coming to the fore and tabulation ceased to be the main issue.\n\n===Contemporary theories===\nThe modern theory of [[orthogonal polynomials]] is of a definite but limited scope. [[Hypergeometric series]] became an intricate theory, in need of later conceptual arrangement. [[Lie group]]s, and in particular their [[representation theory]], explain what a [[Zonal spherical function|spherical function]] can be in general; from 1950 onwards substantial parts of classical theory could be recast in terms of Lie groups. Further,  work on [[algebraic combinatorics]] also revived interest in older parts of the theory. Conjectures of [[Ian G. Macdonald]] helped to open up large and active new fields with the typical special function flavour. [[Difference equation]]s have begun to take their place besides [[differential equation]]s as a source for special functions.\n\n==Special functions in number theory==\nIn [[number theory]], certain special functions have traditionally been studied, such as particular [[Dirichlet series]] and [[modular form]]s. Almost all aspects of special function theory are reflected there, as well as some new ones, such as came out of the [[monstrous moonshine]] theory.\n==Researchers==\n*[[George Andrews (mathematician)]]\n*[[Richard Askey]]\n*[[Harold Exton]]\n*[[George Gasper]]\n*[[Wolfgang Hahn]]\n*[[Mizan Rahman]]\n==See also==\n* [[List of mathematical functions]]\n* [[List of special functions and eponyms]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* {{Cite book | last1=Andrews | first1=George E. | authorlink=George E.

Namely, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = ''x''}} for a [[positive number|positive]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, {{math|1={{!}}''x''{{!}} = −''x''}} for a [[negative number|negative]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} (in which case {{math|−''x''}} is positive), and {{math|1={{!}}0{{!}} = 0}}. For example, the absolute value of 3 is 3, and the absolute value of −3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its [[distance]] from zero.\n\nGeneralisations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example, an absolute value is also defined for the [[complex number]]s, the [[quaternion]]s, [[ordered ring]]s, [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[vector space]]s. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]], [[distance]], and [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]] in various mathematical and physical contexts.\n\n==Terminology and notation==\nIn 1806, [[Jean-Robert Argand]] introduced the term ''module'', meaning ''unit of measure'' in French, specifically for the ''complex'' absolute value,<ref name=oed>[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Draft Revision, June 2008</ref><ref>Nahin, [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html O'Connor and Robertson], and [http://functions.wolfram.com/ComplexComponents/Abs/35/ functions.Wolfram.com.]; for the French sense, see [[Dictionnaire de la langue française (Littré)|Littré]], 1877</ref> and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent ''modulus''.<ref name=oed /> The term ''absolute value'' has been used in this sense from at least 1806 in French<ref>[[Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot|Lazare Nicolas M. Carnot]], ''Mémoire sur la relation qui existe entre les distances respectives de cinq point quelconques pris dans l'espace'', p.&nbsp;105 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YyIOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA105 at Google Books]</ref> and 1857 in English.<ref>James Mill Peirce, ''A Text-book of Analytic Geometry'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJALAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42 at Google Books].  The oldest citation in the 2nd edition of the Oxford English Dictionary is from 1907. The term ''absolute value'' is also used in contrast to ''relative value''.</ref> The notation {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}}, with a [[vertical bar]] on each side, was introduced by [[Karl Weierstrass]] in 1841.<ref>Nicholas J. Higham, ''Handbook of writing for the mathematical sciences'', SIAM. {{ISBN|0-89871-420-6}}, p.&nbsp;25</ref> Other names for ''absolute value'' include ''numerical value''<ref name=oed /> and ''magnitude''.<ref name=oed />  In programming languages and computational software packages, the absolute value of ''x'' is generally represented by abs(''x''), or a similar expression.\n\nThe vertical bar notation also appears in a number of other mathematical contexts: for example, when applied to a set, it denotes its [[cardinality]]; when applied to a [[Matrix (math)|matrix]], it denotes its [[determinant]].  Vertical bars denote the absolute value only for algebraic objects for which the notion of an absolute value is defined, notably an element of a [[normed division algebra]], for example a real number, a complex number, or a quaternion.  A closely related but distinct notation is the use of vertical bars for either the [[euclidean norm]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Calculus on Manifolds|last=Spivak|first=Michael|publisher=Westview|year=1965|isbn=0805390219|location=Boulder, CO|pages=1|quote=|via=}}</ref> or [[sup norm]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Analysis on Manifolds|last=Munkres|first=James|publisher=Westview|year=1991|isbn=0201510359|location=Boulder, CO|pages=4|quote=|via=}}</ref> of a vector in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, although double vertical bars with subscripts (<math>||\\cdot||_2</math> and <math>||\\cdot||_\\infty</math>, respectively) are a more common and less ambiguous notation.\n\n==Definition and properties==\n\n===Real numbers===\nFor any [[real number]]&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is denoted by {{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}}}} (a [[vertical bar]] on each side of the quantity) and is defined as<ref>Mendelson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A8hAm38zsCMC&pg=PA2 p.&nbsp;2].</ref>\n\n:<math>|x| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     x, & \\text{if }  x \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -x, & \\text{if } x < 0.\n   \\end{array}\\right.\n </math>\n\nThe absolute value of&nbsp;{{mvar|x}} is thus always either [[positive number|positive]] or [[0|zero]], but never [[negative number|negative]]: when {{mvar|x}} itself is negative ({{math|''x'' < 0}}), then its absolute value is necessarily positive ({{math|{{!}}''x''{{!}} {{=}} −''x'' > 0}}).\n\nFrom an [[analytic geometry]] point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number's [[distance]] from zero along the [[real number line]], and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed, the notion of an abstract [[distance function]] in mathematics can be seen to be a generalisation of the absolute value of the difference (see [[#Distance|\"Distance\"]] below).\n\nSince the [[radical symbol|square root symbol]] represents the unique ''positive'' square root (when applied to a positive number), it follows that\n\n:<math>|x| = \\sqrt{x^2}</math>\n\nis equivalent to the definition above, and may be used as an alternative definition of the absolute value of real numbers.<ref>{{Cite book| author=Stewart, James B. | coauthors= | title=Calculus: concepts and contexts | year=2001 | publisher=Brooks/Cole | location=Australia  | isbn=0-534-37718-1 | pages=}}, p.&nbsp;A5</ref>\n\nThe absolute value has the following four fundamental properties (''a'', ''b'' are real numbers), that are used for generalization of this notion to other domains:\n\n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"width: 250px\" |<math>|a| \\ge 0 </math>\n| Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>|a| = 0 \\iff a = 0 </math>\n|Positive-definiteness\n|-\n|<math>|ab| = |a|\\,|b|</math>\n|[[Multiplicativeness|Multiplicativity]]\n|-\n|<math>|a+b|  \\le |a| + |b|  </math>\n| [[Subadditivity]], specifically the [[triangle inequality]]\n|}\n\nNon-negativity, positive definiteness, and multiplicativity are readily apparent from the definition.  To see that subadditivity holds, first note that one of the two alternatives of taking {{mvar|s}} as either {{math|–1}} or {{math|+1}} guarantees that <math>s \\cdot (a+b) = |a+b| \\geq 0.</math> Now, since <math>-1 \\cdot x \\le |x|</math> and <math>+1 \\cdot x \\le |x|</math>, it follows that, whichever is the value of {{mvar|s}}, one has <math>s \\cdot x\\leq |x|</math> for all real <math>x</math>. Consequently, <math>|a+b|=s \\cdot (a+b) = s \\cdot a + s \\cdot b \\leq |a| + |b|</math>, as desired.  (For a generalization of this argument to complex numbers, see [[Absolute value#Proof of the complex triangle inequality|\"Proof of the triangle inequality for complex numbers\"]] below.)\n\nSome additional useful properties are given below.  These are either immediate consequences of the definition or implied by the four fundamental properties above.\n\n:{|\n|-\n| style=\"width:250px\" |<math>\\big|\\,|a|\\,\\big| = |a|</math> \n|[[Idempotence]] (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value)\n|-\n| style=\"width:250px\" |<math>|-a| = |a|</math>\n|[[even function|Evenness]] ([[reflection symmetry]] of the graph)\n|-\n|<math>|a - b| = 0 \\iff a = b </math>\n|[[Identity of indiscernibles]] (equivalent to positive-definiteness)\n|-\n|<math>|a - b|  \\le |a - c| + |c - b|  </math>\n|[[Triangle inequality#Example norms|Triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)\n|-\n|<math>\\left|\\frac{a}{b}\\right| = \\frac{|a|}{|b|}\\ </math> (if <math>b \\ne 0</math>)\n|Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativity)\n|-\n|<math>|a-b| \\geq \\big|\\,|a| - |b|\\,\\big| </math>\n|[[Reverse triangle inequality]] (equivalent to subadditivity)\n|}\n\nTwo other useful properties concerning inequalities are:\n:<math>|a| \\le b \\iff -b \\le a \\le b </math>\n:<math>|a| \\ge b \\iff a \\le -b\\ </math> or <math>a\\ge b </math>\n\nThese relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example:\n\n:{|\n|-\n|<math>|x-3| \\le 9 </math>\n|<math>\\iff -9 \\le x-3 \\le 9 </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>\\iff -6 \\le x \\le 12 </math>\n|}\n\nThe absolute value, as \"distance from zero\", is used to define the [[absolute difference]] between arbitrary real numbers, the standard [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on the real numbers.\n\n===Complex numbers===\n{{Anchor|complex modulus}}[[Image:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|The absolute value of a complex number&nbsp;<math>z</math> is the distance&nbsp;<math>r</math> of <math>z</math> from the origin. It is also seen in the picture that <math>z</math> and its [[complex conjugate]]&nbsp;<math>\\bar z</math> have the same absolute value.]]\n\nSince the [[complex number]]s are not [[Totally ordered set|ordered]], the definition given at the top for the real absolute value cannot be directly applied to complex numbers. However, the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalised. The absolute value of a complex number is defined by the Euclidean distance of its corresponding point in the [[complex plane]] from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]].  This can be computed using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]: for any complex number\n\n:<math>z = x + iy,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are real numbers, the '''absolute value''' or '''modulus''' of&nbsp;{{mvar|z}} is denoted {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} and is defined by<ref>{{cite book|author=González, Mario O.|title=Classical Complex Analysis|publisher=CRC Press|year=1992|isbn=9780824784157|page=19|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncxL7EFr7GsC&pg=PA19}}</ref>\n\n:<math>|z| =  \\sqrt{[\\mathrm{Re}(z)]^2 + [\\mathrm{Im}(z)]^2}=\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2},</math>\n\nwhere Re(''z'') = ''x'' and Im(''z'') = ''y'' denote the real and imaginary parts of ''z'', respectively.

It is [[derivative|differentiable]] everywhere except for {{mvar|x}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.  It is [[monotonic function|monotonically decreasing]] on the interval {{open-closed|−∞,0}} and monotonically increasing on the interval {{closed-open|0,+∞}}. Since a real number and its [[additive inverse|opposite]] have the same absolute value, it is an [[even function]], and is hence not [[Inverse function|invertible]]. The real absolute value function is a [[piecewise linear function|piecewise linear]], [[convex function]].\n\nBoth the real and complex functions are [[idempotent]].\n\n===Relationship to the sign function===\nThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the [[sign function|sign (or signum) function]] returns a number's sign irrespective of its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions:\n:<math>|x| = x \\sgn(x),</math>\nor\n:<math> |x| \\sgn(x) = x,</math>\nand for {{math|''x'' ≠ 0}},\n:<math>\\sgn(x) = \\frac{|x|}{x} = \\frac{x}{|x|}.</math>\n\n===Derivative===\nThe real absolute value function has a derivative for every {{math|''x'' ≠ 0}}, but is not [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}.

As a [[generalised function]], the second derivative may be taken as two times the [[Dirac delta function]].\n\n===Antiderivative===\nThe [[antiderivative]] (indefinite integral) of the real absolute value function is\n\n:<math>\\int|x|dx=\\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|C}} is an arbitrary [[constant of integration]]. This is not a [[complex antiderivative]] because complex antiderivatives can only exist for complex-differentiable ([[holomorphic]]) functions, which the complex absolute value function is not.\n\n==Distance==\n{{see also|Metric space}}\nThe absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the [[distance]] from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.\n\nThe standard [[Euclidean distance]] between two points\n\n:<math>a = (a_1, a_2, \\dots , a_n) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>b = (b_1, b_2, \\dots , b_n) </math>\n\nin [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space]] is defined as:\n:<math>\\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}. </math>\n\nThis can be seen as a generalisation, since for <math>a_1</math> and <math>b_1</math> real, i.e. in a 1-space, according to the alternative definition of the absolute value,\n\n:<math>|a_1 - b_1| = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^1(a_i-b_i)^2},</math>\n\nand for <math> a = a_1 + i a_2 </math> and <math> b = b_1 + i b_2 </math> complex numbers, i.e. in a 2-space,\n \n:{|\n|-\n|<math>|a - b| </math>\n|<math> = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|</math>\n|-\n|\n|<math> = \\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2} = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^2(a_i-b_i)^2}.</math>\n|}\n\nThe above shows that the \"absolute value\"-distance, for real and complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance, which they inherit as a result of considering them as one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces, respectively.\n\nThe properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a [[distance function]] as follows:\n\nA real valued function {{mvar|d}} on a set {{math|''X'' × ''X''}} is called a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] (or a ''distance function'') on&nbsp;{{mvar|X}}, if it satisfies the following four axioms:<ref>These axioms are not minimal; for instance, non-negativity can be derived from the other three: {{math|1=0 = ''d''(''a'', ''a'') ≤ ''d''(''a'', ''b'') + ''d''(''b'', ''a'') = 2''d''(''a'', ''b'')}}.</ref>\n:{|\n|-\n|style=\"width:250px\" | <math>d(a, b) \\ge 0 </math>\n|Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b) = 0 \\iff a = b </math>\n|Identity of indiscernibles\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b) = d(b, a) </math>\n|Symmetry\n|-\n|<math>d(a, b)  \\le d(a, c) + d(c, b)  </math>\n|Triangle inequality\n|}\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Ordered rings===\nThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any [[ordered ring]]. That is, if&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} is an element of an ordered ring&nbsp;''R'', then the '''absolute value''' of&nbsp;{{mvar|a}}, denoted by {{math|{{!}}''a''{{!}}}}, is defined to be:<ref>Mac Lane, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L6FENd8GHIUC&pg=PA264 p.&nbsp;264].</ref>\n\n:<math>|a| = \\left\\{\n   \\begin{array}{rl}\n     a, & \\text{if }  a \\geq 0 \\\\\n     -a, & \\text{if } a < 0.\n   \\end{array}\\right.\n </math>\n\nwhere {{math|−''a''}} is the [[additive inverse]] of&nbsp;{{mvar|a}}, 0 is the additive [[identity element]], and < and ≥ have the usual meaning with respect to the ordering in the ring.\n\n===Fields===\n{{main|Absolute value (algebra)}}\nThe four fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used to generalise the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.\n\nA real-valued function&nbsp;{{mvar|v}} on a [[field (mathematics)|field]]&nbsp;{{mvar|F}} is called an ''absolute value'' (also a ''modulus'', ''magnitude'', ''value'', or ''valuation'')<ref>Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&pg=PA260 p.&nbsp;260]. This meaning of ''valuation'' is rare. Usually, a [[valuation (algebra)|valuation]] is the logarithm of the inverse of an absolute value</ref> if it satisfies the following four axioms:\n\n:{| cellpadding=10\n|-\n|<math>v(a) \\ge 0 </math>\n|Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>v(a) = 0 \\iff a = \\mathbf{0} </math>\n|Positive-definiteness\n|-\n|<math>v(ab) = v(a) v(b) </math>\n|Multiplicativity\n|-\n|<math>v(a+b)  \\le v(a) + v(b)  </math>\n|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality\n|}\n\nWhere '''0''' denotes the [[additive identity]] element of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativity that {{math|1=''v''('''1''') = 1}}, where '''1''' denotes the [[multiplicative identity]] element of&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.\n\nIf {{mvar|v}} is an absolute value on&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, then the function&nbsp;{{mvar|d}} on {{math|''F'' × ''F''}}, defined by {{math|1=''d''(''a'', ''b'') = ''v''(''a'' − ''b'')}}, is a metric and the following are equivalent:\n\n* {{mvar|d}} satisfies the [[ultrametric]] inequality <math>d(x, y) \\leq \\max(d(x,z),d(y,z))</math> for all {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, {{mvar|z}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}.\n* <math> \\big\\{ v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) : n \\in \\mathbb{N} \\big\\} </math> is [[bounded set|bounded]] in&nbsp;'''R'''.\n* <math> v\\Big({\\textstyle \\sum_{k=1}^n } \\mathbf{1}\\Big) \\le 1\\ </math> for every <math>n \\in \\mathbb{N}.</math>\n* <math> v(a) \\le 1 \\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\le 1\\ </math> for all <math>a \\in F.</math>\n* <math> v(a + b) \\le \\mathrm{max}\\{v(a), v(b)\\}\\ </math> for all <math>a, b \\in F.</math>\n\nAn absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be '''non-Archimedean''', otherwise it is said to be [[Archimedean field|Archimedean]].<ref>Shechter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&pg=PA260 pp.&nbsp;260–261].</ref>\n\n===Vector spaces===\n{{Main|Norm (mathematics)}}\nAgain the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalise the notion to an arbitrary vector space.\n\nA real-valued function on a [[vector space]]&nbsp;{{mvar|V}} over a field&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, represented as <big>{{math|‖·<!-- do not replace with ⋅: not a multiplication sign! -->‖}}</big>, is called an '''absolute value''', but more usually a [[Norm (mathematics)|'''norm''']], if it satisfies the following axioms:\n\nFor all&nbsp;{{mvar|a}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|F}}, and {{math|'''v'''}}, {{math|'''u'''}} in&nbsp;{{mvar|V}},\n\n:{| cellpadding=10\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|  \\ge 0 </math>\n|Non-negativity\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v}\\| = 0 \\iff \\mathbf{v} = 0</math>\n|Positive-definiteness\n|-\n|<math>\\|a \\mathbf{v}\\| = |a| \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| </math>\n|Positive homogeneity or positive scalability\n|-\n|<math>\\|\\mathbf{v} + \\mathbf{u}\\| \\le \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| + \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| </math>\n|Subadditivity or the triangle inequality\n|}\n\nThe norm of a vector is also called its ''length'' or ''magnitude''.\n\nIn the case of [[Euclidean space]]&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, the function defined by\n\n:<math>\\|(x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) \\| = \\sqrt{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}</math>\n\nis a norm called the [[Euclidean norm]]. When the real numbers&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''}} are considered as the one-dimensional vector space&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, the absolute value is a [[Norm (mathematics)|norm]], and is the {{mvar|p}}-norm (see [[L^p space#Definition|L<sup>p</sup> space]]) for any&nbsp;{{mvar|p}}. In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on {{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, in the sense that, for every norm {{math|‖·‖}} on&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>1</sup>}}, {{math|1=‖''x''‖ = ‖1‖ ⋅ {{!}}''x''{{!}}}}. The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an [[inner product space]]. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the [[complex plane]] is identified with the [[Euclidean plane]]&nbsp;{{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}.\n\n===Composition algebras===\n{{main|Composition algebra}}\nEvery composition algebra ''A'' has an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''x'' → ''x''* called its '''conjugation'''. The product in ''A'' of an element ''x'' and its conjugate ''x''* is written ''N''(''x'') = ''x x''* and called the '''norm of x'''.\n\nThe real numbers ℝ, complex numbers ℂ, and quaternions ℍ are all composition algebras with norms given by [[definite quadratic form]]s. The absolute value in these [[division algebra]]s is given by the [[square root]] of the composition algebra norm.\n\nIn general the norm of a composition algebra may be a [[quadratic form]] that is not definite and has [[null vector]]s. However, as in the case of division algebras, when an element ''x'' has a non-zero norm, then ''x'' has a [[multiplicative inverse]] given by ''x''*/''N''(''x'').\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Bartle; Sherbert; ''Introduction to real analysis'' (4th ed.), John Wiley & Sons, 2011 {{ISBN|978-0-471-43331-6}}.\n* Nahin, Paul J.; ''An Imaginary Tale''; Princeton University Press; (hardcover, 1998). {{ISBN|0-691-02795-1}}.\n* Mac Lane, Saunders, Garrett Birkhoff, ''Algebra'', American Mathematical Soc., 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-8218-1646-2}}.\n* Mendelson, Elliott, ''Schaum's Outline of Beginning Calculus'', McGraw-Hill Professional, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-07-148754-2}}.\n* O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.; [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Mathematicians/Argand.html \"Jean Robert Argand\"].\n* Schechter, Eric; ''Handbook of Analysis and Its Foundations'', pp.&nbsp;259–263, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eqUv3Bcd56EC&pg=PA259 \"Absolute Values\"],  Academic Press (1997) {{ISBN|0-12-622760-8}}.\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Absolute value|id=p/a010370}}\n* {{PlanetMath | urlname=AbsoluteValue | title=absolute value | id=448}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=AbsoluteValue | title=Absolute Value}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Absolute Value}}\n[[Category:Special functions]]\n[[Category:Real numbers]]\n[[Category:Norms (mathematics)]]"

Sudan published the lesser-known [[Sudan function]], then shortly afterwards and independently, in 1928, Ackermann published his function <math>\\varphi</math> (the Greek letter ''[[phi]]''). Ackermann's three-argument function, <math>\\varphi(m, n, p)</math>, is defined such that for ''p'' = 0, 1, 2, it reproduces the basic operations of [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[exponentiation]] as\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 0) = m+n,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 1) = m\\cdot n,</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 2) = m^n,</math>\nand for ''p'' > 2 it extends these basic operations in a way that can be compared to the [[hyperoperation]]s:\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, 3) = m\\uparrow^2 (n+1),\\,\\!</math>\n:<math>\\varphi(m, n, p) \\gtrapprox m\\uparrow^{p - 1}(n+1)\\ \\ (p \\ge 4).\\,\\!</math>\n(Aside from its historic role as a total-computable-but-not-primitive-recursive function, Ackermann's original function is seen to extend the basic arithmetic operations beyond exponentiation, although not as seamlessly as do variants of Ackermann's function that are specifically designed for that purpose—such as [[Reuben Goodstein|Goodstein's]] [[hyperoperation]] sequence.)\n\nIn ''On the Infinite'', David Hilbert hypothesized that the Ackermann function was not primitive recursive, but it was Ackermann, Hilbert's personal secretary and former student, who actually proved the hypothesis in his paper ''On Hilbert's Construction of the Real Numbers''.<ref name=\"Ack\"/><ref>von Heijenoort.

However, the recursion is bounded because in each recursive application either ''m'' decreases, or ''m'' remains the same and ''n'' decreases. Each time that ''n'' reaches zero, ''m'' decreases, so ''m'' eventually reaches zero as well. (Expressed more technically, in each case the pair (''m'', ''n'') decreases in the [[lexicographic order]] on pairs, which is a [[well-order]]ing, just like the ordering of single non-negative integers; this means one cannot go down in the ordering infinitely many times in succession.) However, when ''m'' decreases there is no upper bound on how much ''n'' can increase—and it will often increase greatly.\n\nThe Péter-Ackermann function can also be expressed in terms of various other versions of the Ackermann function:\n* the indexed version of [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]] (extended to integer indices ≥ −2):\n::<math>A(m,n)=2\\uparrow^{m-2} (n+3) - 3.</math>\n:The part of the definition {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', 0) = ''A''(''m'' − 1, 1)}} corresponds to <math>2\\uparrow^{m+1} 3=2\\uparrow^m 4.</math>\n\n* [[Conway chained arrow notation]]:\n::<math>A(m,n)=(2\\rightarrow(n+3)\\rightarrow(m-2))-3</math> for <math>m\\geq3</math>\n:hence\n::<math>2\\rightarrow n\\rightarrow m=A(m+2,n-3)+3</math> for <math>n>2</math>.\n:({{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} and {{Nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}} would correspond with {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', −2) = −1}} and {{nowrap|1=''A''(''m'', −1) = 1}}, which could logically be added.)\n* Using the [[hyperoperation]]s notation, {{nowrap|''A''(''m'', ''n'')}} can be expressed as {{nowrap|2[''m''](''n'' − 3) − 3}}, for {{nowrap|''m'' > 1}}.\n\nFor small values of ''m'' like 1, 2, or 3, the Ackermann function grows relatively slowly with respect to ''n'' (at most [[exponential growth|exponentially]]). For {{nowrap|''m'' ≥ 4}}, however, it grows much more quickly; even {{nowrap|''A''(4, 2)}} is about 2{{e|19728}}, and the decimal expansion of {{nowrap|''A''(4, 3)}} is very large by any typical measure.\n\nOne interesting aspect of the Ackermann function is that the only arithmetic operations it ever uses are addition and subtraction of 1. Its properties come solely from the power of unlimited recursion. This also implies that its running time is at least proportional to its output, and so is also extremely huge. In actuality, for most cases the running time is far larger than the output; see below.\n\nA single-argument version {{nowrap|1=''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} that increases both ''m'' and ''n'' at the same time dwarfs every primitive recursive function, including very fast-growing functions such as the [[exponential function]], the factorial function, multi- and [[superfactorial]] functions, and even functions defined using Knuth's up-arrow notation (except when the indexed up-arrow is used). It can be seen that ''f''(''n'') is roughly comparable to ''f''<sub>''ω''</sub>(''n'') in the [[fast-growing hierarchy]]. This extreme growth can be exploited to show that ''f'', which is obviously computable on a machine with infinite memory such as a [[Turing machine]] and so is a [[computable function]], grows faster than any primitive recursive function and is therefore not primitive recursive.\n\nIn a category with [[Exponential object|exponentials]], using the isomorphism <math>((X \\times Y) \\rightarrow Z) \\cong (X \\rightarrow (Y \\rightarrow Z))</math> (in computer science, this is called [[currying]]), the Ackermann function may be defined via primitive recursion over higher-order functionals as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\operatorname{Ack}(0) & = & \\operatorname{S} \\\\\n\\operatorname{Ack}(m+1) & = & \\operatorname{Iter}(\\operatorname{Ack}(m))\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nwhere {{math|S(''n'') {{=}} ''n'' + 1}} is the usual [[successor function]] and Iter denotes the [[functional power]] operator, defined by primitive recursion as well:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(0) & = & f(1) \\\\\n\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n+1) & = & f(\\operatorname{Iter}(f)(n)).\n\\end{array}\n</math>\nThe function <math>\\mathrm{Ack}</math> defined in this way agrees with the Ackermann function <math>A</math> defined above: <math>\\mathrm{Ack}(m)(n)=A(m,n)</math>.\n\n==Example expansions==\nTo see how the Ackermann function grows so quickly, it helps to expand out some simple expressions using the rules in the original definition. For example, one can fully evaluate <math>A(1, 2)</math> in the following way:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA(1,2) & = A(0, A(1, 1)) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, A(1, 0))) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, A(0, 1))) \\\\\n& = A(0, A(0, 2)) \\\\\n& = A(0, 3) \\\\\n& = 4.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTo demonstrate how <math>A(4, 3)</math>'s computation results in many steps and in a large number:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA(4, 3) & = A(3, A(4, 2)) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(4, 1))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(4, 0)))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(3, 1)))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(3, 0))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(2, 1))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(2, 0)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(1, 1)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(1, 0))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, A(0, 1))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, A(0, 2)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(1, 3))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(1, 2)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(1, 1))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(1, 0)))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, A(0, 1)))))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, A(0, 2)) )) )) ) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, A(0, 3)))))) \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, A(0, 4)))))  \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, A(2, 5)))) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, A(3, 13))) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, A(3, 65533)) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = A(3, 2^{65536} - 3) \\\\\n& = \\ldots \\\\\n& = 2^{2^{ \\overset{65536}{} }} - 3. \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n== Table of values ==\nComputing the Ackermann function can be restated in terms of an infinite table. First, place the natural numbers along the top row. To determine a number in the table, take the number immediately to the left. Then use that number to look up the required number in the column given by that number and one row up. If there is no number to its left, simply look at the column headed \"1\" in the previous row. Here is a small upper-left portion of the table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&nbsp;''n'')\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''m''|''n''}}\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n!

This number is constructed with a technique similar to applying the Ackermann function to itself recursively.\n\nThis is a repeat of the above table, but with the values replaced by the relevant expression from the function definition to show the pattern clearly:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Values of ''A''(''m'',&nbsp;''n'')\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''m''|''n''}}\n! 0\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! n\n|-\n! 0\n| 0 + 1 || 1 + 1 || 2 + 1 || 3 + 1 || 4 + 1 || ''n'' + 1\n|-\n! 1\n| ''A''(0, 1) || ''A''(0, ''A''(1, 0))<br />= ''A''(0, 2) || ''A''(0, ''A''(1, 1))<br />= ''A''(0, 3) || ''A''(0, ''A''(1, 2))<br />= ''A''(0, 4) || ''A''(0, ''A''(1, 3))<br />= ''A''(0, 5) || ''A''(0, ''A''(1, ''n''−1))\n|-\n! 2\n| ''A''(1, 1) || ''A''(1, ''A''(2, 0))<br />= ''A''(1, 3) || ''A''(1, ''A''(2, 1))<br />= ''A''(1, 5) || ''A''(1, ''A''(2, 2))<br />= ''A''(1, 7) || ''A''(1, ''A''(2, 3))<br />= ''A''(1, 9) || ''A''(1, ''A''(2, ''n''−1))\n|-\n! 3\n| ''A''(2, 1) || ''A''(2, ''A''(3, 0))<br />= ''A''(2, 5) || ''A''(2, ''A''(3, 1))<br />= ''A''(2, 13) || ''A''(2, ''A''(3, 2))<br />= ''A''(2, 29) || ''A''(2, ''A''(3, 3))<br />= ''A''(2, 61) || ''A''(2, ''A''(3, ''n''−1))\n|-\n! 4\n| ''A''(3, 1) || ''A''(3, ''A''(4, 0))<br />= ''A''(3, 13) || ''A''(3, ''A''(4, 1))<br />= ''A''(3, 65533) || ''A''(3, ''A''(4, 2)) || ''A''(3, ''A''(4, 3)) || ''A''(3, ''A''(4, ''n''−1))\n|-\n! 5\n| ''A''(4, 1) || ''A''(4, ''A''(5, 0)) || ''A''(4, ''A''(5, 1)) || ''A''(4, ''A''(5, 2)) || ''A''(4, ''A''(5, 3)) || ''A''(4, ''A''(5, ''n''−1))\n|-\n! 6\n| ''A''(5, 1) || ''A''(5, ''A''(6, 0)) || ''A''(5, ''A''(6, 1)) || ''A''(5, ''A''(6, 2)) || ''A''(5, ''A''(6, 3)) || ''A''(5, ''A''(6, ''n''−1))\n|}\n\n== Proof that the Ackermann function is not primitive recursive ==\nIn  a sense, the Ackermann function grows faster than any [[primitive recursive function]] and therefore is not itself primitive recursive. \n\nSpecifically, one shows that to every primitive recursive function <math>f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)</math> there exists a non-negative integer <math>t</math> such that for all non-negative integers <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math>,\n:<math>f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)<A(t,\\max_i x_i).</math>\nOnce this is established, it follows that <math>A</math> itself is not primitive recursive, since otherwise putting <math>x_1=x_2=t</math> would lead to the contradiction <math>A(t,t)<A(t,t)</math>.\n\nThe proof<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://planetmath.org/ackermannfunctionisnotprimitiverecursive|title=Ackermann function is not primitive recursive {{!}} planetmath.org|last=Woo|first=Chi|date=2009-12-17|website=planetmath.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509202634/http://planetmath.org/ackermannfunctionisnotprimitiverecursive|archive-date=2013-05-09|dead-url=yes}}</ref> proceeds as follows: define the class <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> of all functions that grow slower than the Ackermann function\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}=\\left\\{ f \\mid \\exists t\\ \\forall x_1\\cdots \\forall x_n:\\ f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)<A(t, \\max_i x_i) \\right\\}   </math>\nand show that <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> contains all primitive recursive functions. The latter is achieved by showing that <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> contains the constant functions, the successor function, the projection functions and that it is closed under the operations of function composition and primitive recursion.\n\n== Inverse ==\nSince the function {{nowrap|1=&nbsp;''f''(''n'') = ''A''(''n'', ''n'')}} considered above grows very rapidly, its [[inverse function]], ''f''{{i sup|−1}}, grows very slowly. This '''inverse Ackermann function''' ''f''<sup>−1</sup> is usually denoted by '''''α'''''. In fact, ''α''(''n'') is less than 5 for any practical input size ''n'', since {{nowrap|''A''(4, 4)}} is on the order of <math>2^{2^{2^{2^{16}}}}</math>.\n\nThis inverse appears in the time [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of some [[algorithm]]s, such as the [[disjoint-set data structure]] and [[Bernard Chazelle|Chazelle]]'s algorithm for [[minimum spanning tree]]s. Sometimes Ackermann's original function or other variations are used in these settings, but they all grow at similarly high rates. In particular, some modified functions simplify the expression by eliminating the −3 and similar terms.\n\nA two-parameter variation of the inverse Ackermann function can be defined as follows, where <math>\\lfloor x \\rfloor</math> is the [[floor function]]:\n:<math>\\alpha(m,n) = \\min\\{i \\geq 1 : A(i,\\lfloor m/n \\rfloor) \\geq \\log_2 n\\}.</math>\nThis function arises in more precise analyses of the algorithms mentioned above, and gives a more refined time bound. In the disjoint-set data structure, ''m'' represents the number of operations while ''n'' represents the number of elements; in the minimum spanning tree algorithm, ''m'' represents the number of edges while ''n'' represents the number of vertices.\nSeveral slightly different definitions of {{nowrap|''α''(''m'', ''n'')}} exist; for example, {{nowrap|log<sub>2</sub> ''n''}} is sometimes replaced by ''n'', and the floor function is sometimes replaced by a [[ceiling function|ceiling]].\n\nOther studies might define an inverse function of one where m is set to a constant, such that the inverse applies to a particular row.<ref>[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=15618233 An inverse-Ackermann style lower bound for the online minimum spanning tree verification problem] November 2002</ref>\n\n==Use as benchmark==\nThe Ackermann function, due to its definition in terms of extremely deep recursion, can be used as a benchmark of a [[compiler]]'s ability to optimize recursion.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] that can be defined \nas the [[Polynomial#History|root of a polynomial equation]]. Quite often algebraic functions are [[algebraic expression]]s using a finite number of terms, involving only the [[algebraic operations]] addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and raising to a fractional power. Examples of such functions are:\n* <math>f(x)=1/x</math>\n* <math>f(x)=\\sqrt{x}</math>\n* <math>f(x)=\\frac{ \\sqrt{1+x^3}}{x^{3/7}-\\sqrt{7} x^{1/3}}</math> \n\nSome algebraic functions, however, cannot be expressed by such finite expressions (this is the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). This is the case, for example, for the [[Bring radical]], which is the function [[implicit function|implicitly]] defined by \n\n: <math>f(x)^5+f(x)+x=0</math>.\n\nIn more precise  terms, an algebraic function of degree {{math|''n''}} in one variable {{math|''x''}} is a function <math>y = f(x),</math> that is continuous in its [[domain of a function|domain]] and satisfies a [[polynomial equation]]\n\n: <math>a_n(x)y^n+a_{n-1}(x)y^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_0(x)=0</math>\n\nwhere the coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x'')}} are [[polynomial function]]s of {{math|''x''}}, with integer coefficients. The value of an algebraic function at a [[rational number]], and more generally, at an [[algebraic number]] is always an algebraic number .\nSometimes, coefficients <math>a_i(x)</math> that are polynomial over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] {{mvar|R}} are considered, and one then talks about \"functions algebraic over {{mvar|R}}\".\n\nA function which is not algebraic is called a [[transcendental function]], as it is for example the case of <math>\\exp(x), \\tan(x), \\ln(x), \\Gamma(x)</math>. A composition of transcendental functions can give an algebraic function:  <math>f(x)=\\cos (\\arcsin(x)) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}</math>.\n\nAs an equation of degree ''n'' has ''n'' roots, a polynomial equation does not implicitly define a single function, but ''n''\nfunctions, sometimes also called [[branch cut|branches]]. Consider for example the equation of the [[unit circle]]:\n<math>y^2+x^2=1.\\,</math>\nThis determines ''y'', except only [[up to]] an overall sign; accordingly, it has two branches:\n<math>y=\\pm \\sqrt{1-x^2}.\\,</math>\n\nAn '''algebraic function in ''m'' variables''' is similarly defined as a function <math>y=f(x_1,\\dots ,x_m)</math> which solves a polynomial equation in ''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 variables:\n\n:<math>p(y,x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_m)=0.\\,</math>\n\nIt is normally assumed that ''p'' should be an [[irreducible polynomial]].  The existence of an algebraic function is then guaranteed by the [[implicit function theorem]].\n\nFormally, an algebraic function in ''m'' variables over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' is an element of the [[algebraic closure]] of the field of [[rational function]]s ''K''(''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''m''</sub>).\n\n== Algebraic functions in one variable ==\n=== Introduction and overview ===\nThe informal definition of an algebraic function provides a number of clues about their properties.  To gain an intuitive understanding, it may be helpful to regard algebraic functions as functions which can be formed by the usual [[algebraic operations]]: [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], and taking an [[nth root|''n''th root]].  This is something of an oversimplification; because of the [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]], algebraic functions need not be expressible by radicals.\n\nFirst, note that any [[polynomial function]] <math>y = p(x)</math> is an algebraic function, since it is simply the solution ''y'' to the equation\n\n:<math> y-p(x) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nMore generally, any [[rational function]] <math>y=\\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}</math> is algebraic, being the solution to\n\n:<math>q(x)y-p(x)=0.</math>\n\nMoreover, the ''n''th root of any polynomial <math>y=\\sqrt[n]{p(x)}</math> is an algebraic function, solving the equation\n\n:<math>y^n-p(x)=0.</math>\n\nSurprisingly, the [[inverse function]] of an algebraic function is an algebraic function.  For supposing that ''y'' is a solution to\n\n:<math>a_n(x)y^n+\\cdots+a_0(x)=0,</math>\n\nfor each value of ''x'', then ''x'' is also a solution of this equation for each value of ''y''.  Indeed, interchanging the roles of ''x'' and ''y'' and gathering terms,\n\n:<math>b_m(y)x^m+b_{m-1}(y)x^{m-1}+\\cdots+b_0(y)=0.</math>\n\nWriting ''x'' as a function of ''y'' gives the inverse function, also an algebraic function.\n\nHowever, not every function has an inverse.  For example, ''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> fails the [[horizontal line test]]: it fails to be [[one-to-one function|one-to-one]].  The inverse is the algebraic \"function\" <math>x=\\pm\\sqrt{y}</math>. \nAnother way to understand this, is that the set of branches of the polynomial equation defining our algebraic function is the graph of an [[algebraic curve]].\n\n=== The role of complex numbers ===\nFrom an algebraic perspective, complex numbers enter quite naturally into the study of algebraic functions.  First of all, by the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], the complex numbers are an [[algebraically closed field]].  Hence any polynomial relation ''p''(''y'', ''x'') = 0  is guaranteed to have at least one solution (and in general a number of solutions not exceeding the degree of ''p'' in ''y'') for ''y'' at each point ''x'', provided we allow ''y'' to assume complex as well as real values.  Thus, problems to do with the [[domain (mathematics)|domain]] of an algebraic function can safely be minimized.\n\n[[Image:y^3-xy+1=0.png|thumb|A graph of three branches of the algebraic function ''y'', where ''y''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''xy''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, over the domain 3/2<sup>2/3</sup> < ''x'' < 50.]]\nFurthermore, even if one is ultimately interested in real algebraic functions, there may be no means to express the function in terms of addition, multiplication, division and taking ''nth'' roots without resorting to complex numbers (see [[casus irreducibilis]]).  For example, consider the algebraic function determined by the equation\n\n:<math>y^3-xy+1=0.\\,</math>\n\nUsing the [[cubic formula]], we get\n\n:<math>\ny=-\\frac{2x}{\\sqrt[3]{-108+12\\sqrt{81-12x^3}}}+\\frac{\\sqrt[3]{-108+12\\sqrt{81-12x^3}}}{6}.\n</math>\n\nFor <math>x\\le \\frac{3}{\\sqrt[3]{4}},</math> the square root is real and the cubic root is thus well defined, providing the unique real root. On the other hand, for <math>x>\\frac{3}{\\sqrt[3]{4}},</math> the square root is not real, and one has to choose, for the square root, either non-real square root. Thus the cubic root has to be chosen among three non-real numbers. If the same choices are done in the two terms of the formula, the three choices for the cubic root provide the three branches shown, in the accompanying image.\n\nIt may be proven that there is no way to express this function in terms of ''nth'' roots using real numbers only, even though the resulting function is real-valued on the domain of the graph shown.\n\nOn a more significant theoretical level, using complex numbers allows one to use the powerful techniques of [[complex analysis]] to discuss algebraic functions.  In particular, the [[argument principle]] can be used to show that any algebraic function is in fact an [[analytic function]], at least in the multiple-valued sense.\n\nFormally, let ''p''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'') be a complex polynomial in the complex variables ''x'' and ''y''.  Suppose that\n''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;∈&nbsp;'''C''' is such that the polynomial ''p''(''x''<sub>0</sub>,''y'') of ''y'' has ''n'' distinct zeros.  We shall show that the algebraic function is analytic in a neighborhood of ''x''<sub>0</sub>.  Choose a system of ''n'' non-overlapping discs Δ<sub>''i''</sub> containing each of these zeros.  Then by the argument principle\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_{\\partial\\Delta_i} \\frac{p_y(x_0,y)}{p(x_0,y)}\\,dy = 1.</math>\n\nBy continuity, this also holds for all ''x'' in a neighborhood of ''x''<sub>0</sub>.  In particular, ''p''(''x'',''y'') has only one root in Δ<sub>''i''</sub>, given by the [[residue theorem]]:\n\n:<math>f_i(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\oint_{\\partial\\Delta_i} y\\frac{p_y(x,y)}{p(x,y)}\\,dy</math>\n\nwhich is an analytic function.\n\n=== Monodromy ===\nNote that the foregoing proof of analyticity derived an expression for a system of ''n'' different '''function elements''' ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>(''x''), provided that ''x'' is not a '''critical point''' of ''p''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'').  A ''critical point'' is a point where the number of distinct zeros is smaller than the degree of ''p'', and this occurs only where the highest degree term of ''p'' vanishes, and where the [[discriminant]] vanishes.  Hence there are only finitely many such points ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c''<sub>''m''</sub>.\n\nA close analysis of the properties of the function elements ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> near the critical points can be used to show that the  [[monodromy theorem|monodromy cover]] is [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramified]] over the critical points (and possibly the [[Riemann sphere|point at infinity]]).  Thus the holomorphic extension of the ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> has at worst algebraic poles and ordinary algebraic branchings over the critical points.\n\nNote that, away from the critical points, we have\n\n:<math>p(x,y) = a_n(x)(y-f_1(x))(y-f_2(x))\\cdots(y-f_n(x))</math>\n\nsince the ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> are by definition the distinct zeros of ''p''.  The [[monodromy group]] acts by permuting the factors, and thus forms the '''monodromy representation''' of the [[Galois group]] of ''p''.  (The [[monodromy action]] on the [[universal covering space]] is related but different notion in the theory of Riemann surfaces.)\n\n== History ==\n\nThe ideas surrounding algebraic functions go back at least as far as [[René Descartes]].  The first discussion of algebraic functions appears to have been in [[Edward Waring]]'s 1794 ''An Essay on the Principles of Human Knowledge'' in which he writes:\n:let a quantity denoting the ordinate, be an algebraic function of the abscissa x, by the common methods of division and extraction of roots, reduce it into an infinite series ascending or descending according to the dimensions of x, and then find the integral of each of the resulting terms.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Algebraic expression]]\n* [[Analytic function]]\n* [[Complex function]]\n* [[Elementary function]]\n* [[Function (mathematics)]]\n* [[Generalized function]]\n* [[List of special functions and eponyms]]\n* [[List of types of functions]]\n* [[Polynomial]]\n* [[Rational function]]\n* [[Special functions]]\n* [[Transcendental function]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|authorlink=Lars Ahlfors|first = Lars|last = Ahlfors|title = Complex Analysis|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 1979}}\n* {{cite book|author = van der Waerden, B.L.|authorlink=Bartel Leendert van der Waerden| title = Modern Algebra, Volume II|publisher = Springer|year=1931}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Algebraic functions}}\n*[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Algebraic_function Definition of \"Algebraic function\" in the Encyclopedia of Math]\n*{{MathWorld |title=Algebraic Function |id=AlgebraicFunction}}\n*{{PlanetMath|urlname=AlgebraicFunction|title=Algebraic Function}}\n*[http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/algebraic_function.html Definition of \"Algebraic function\"] in [[David J.

Thus, by the [[monotone convergence theorem]], the sequence is convergent, so there exists a {{math|''g''}} such that:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}g_n = g</math>\n\nHowever, we can also see that:\n\n:<math>a_n = \\frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_n}</math>\n\nand so:\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to \\infty}a_n = \\lim_{n\\to \\infty}\\frac{g_{n + 1}^2}{g_{n}} = \\frac{g^2}{g} = g</math>\n\n[[Q.E.D.]]\n\n==Proof of the integral-form expression==\nThis proof is given by Gauss.<ref name=\"BerggrenBorwein2004\" />\nLet\n\n:<math>I(x,y) = \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{x^2\\cos^2\\theta+y^2\\sin^2\\theta}},</math>\n\nChanging the variable of integration to <math>\\theta'</math>, where\n\n:<math> \\sin\\theta = \\frac{2x\\sin\\theta'}{(x+y)+(x-y)\\sin^2\\theta'}, </math>\n\ngives\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI(x,y) &= \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{d\\theta'}{\\sqrt{\\bigl(\\frac12(x+y)\\bigr)^2\\cos^2\\theta'+\\bigl(\\sqrt{xy}\\bigr)^2\\sin^2\\theta'}}\\\\\n       &= I\\bigl(\\tfrac12(x+y),\\sqrt{xy}\\bigr).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThus, we have\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nI(x,y) &= I(a_1, g_1) = I(a_2, g_2) = \\cdots\\\\\n  &= I\\bigl(M(x,y),M(x,y)\\bigr) = \\pi/\\bigr(2M(x,y)\\bigl).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe last equality comes from observing that <math>I(z,z) = \\pi/(2z)</math>.\n\nFinally, we obtain the desired result\n\n:<math>M(x,y) = \\pi/\\bigl(2 I(x,y) \\bigr). </math>\n\n==The AGM method==\n[[Gauss]] noticed<ref>{{cite journal |author=B.

      "text": "The '''Bateman Manuscript Project''' was a major effort at collation and encyclopedic compilation of the mathematical theory of [[special functions]]. It resulted in the eventual publication of five important reference volumes, under the editorship of [[Arthur Erdélyi]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe theory of special functions was a core activity of the field of [[applied mathematics]], from the middle of the nineteenth century to the advent of high-speed [[electronic computing]]. The intricate properties of [[spherical harmonics]], [[elliptic function]]s and other staples of problem-solving in [[mathematical physics]], [[astronomy]] and right across the [[physical sciences]], are not easy to document completely, absent a theory explaining the inter-relationships. [[Mathematical table]]s to perform actual calculations needed to mesh with an adequate theory of how functions could be transformed into those already tabulated.\n\n[[Harry Bateman]], a distinguished applied mathematician, undertook the somewhat [[Quixotism|quixotic]] task of trying to collate the content of the very large literature. On his death in 1946, his papers on this project were still in a uniformly rough state. The publication of the edited version provided special functions texts more up-to-date than, for example, the classic [[Whittaker & Watson]].\n\nThe volumes were out of print for many years, and copyright in the works reverted to the [[California Institute of Technology]], who renewed them in the early 1980s.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_polynomials",
      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Polynomial sequence}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Bernoulli polynomials''', named after [[Jacob Bernoulli]], occur in the study of many [[special functions]] and, in particular the [[Riemann zeta function]] and the [[Hurwitz zeta function]].  This is in large part because they are an [[Appell sequence]] (i.e. a [[Sheffer sequence]] for the ordinary [[derivative]] operator). Unlike [[orthogonal polynomials]], the Bernoulli polynomials are remarkable in that the number of crossings of the ''x''-axis in the [[unit interval]] does not go up as the degree of the polynomials goes up. In the limit of large degree, the Bernoulli polynomials, appropriately scaled, approach the [[trigonometric function|sine and cosine functions]].\n[[Image:Bernoulli polynomials.svg|thumb|right|Bernoulli polynomials]]\n\nA similar set of polynomials, based on a similar generating function, is the family of '''Euler polynomials'''.\n\n==Representations==\n\nThe Bernoulli polynomials ''B''<sub>''n''</sub> admit a variety of different [[representation (mathematics)|representations]].  Which among them should be taken to be the definition may depend on one's purposes.\n\n===Explicit formula===\n\n:<math>B_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} B_{n-k} x^k,</math>\n\n:<math>E_m(x)=\n\\sum_{k=0}^m {m \\choose k} \\frac{E_k}{2^k}\n\\left(x-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{m-k} \\,.</math>\n\nfor ''n'' ≥ 0, where ''B''<sub>''k''</sub> are the [[Bernoulli number]]s, and ''E''<sub>''k''</sub> are the [[Euler numbers]]. These formulas can be obtained from the [[#Translations|translation formulas]] below.\n\n===Generating functions===\nThe [[generating function]] for the Bernoulli polynomials is\n\n:<math>\\frac{t e^{xt}}{e^t-1}= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty B_n(x) \\frac{t^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThe generating function for the Euler polynomials is\n:<math>\\frac{2 e^{xt}}{e^t+1}= \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty E_n(x) \\frac{t^n}{n!}.</math>\n\n===Representation by a differential operator===\n\nThe Bernoulli polynomials are also given by\n\n:<math>B_n(x)={D \\over e^D -1} x^n</math>\n\nwhere ''D'' = ''d''/''dx'' is differentiation with respect to ''x'' and the fraction is expanded as a [[formal power series]]. It follows that \n:<math>\\int _a^x  B_n (u) ~du = \\frac{B_{n+1}(x) - B_{n+1}(a)}{n+1}   ~.</math>\ncf. [[#Integrals|integrals below]]. By the same token, the Euler polynomials are given by\n\n:<math> E_n(x) = \\frac{2}{e^D + 1} x^n. </math>\n\n===Representation by an integral operator===\n\nThe Bernoulli polynomials are the unique polynomials determined by\n\n:<math>\\int_x^{x+1} B_n(u)\\,du = x^n.</math>\n\nThe [[integral transform]]\n\n:<math>(Tf)(x) = \\int_x^{x+1} f(u)\\,du</math>\n\non polynomials ''f'', simply amounts to \n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n(Tf)(x) = {e^D - 1 \\over D}f(x) & {} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {D^n \\over (n+1)!}f(x) \\\\\n& {} = f(x) + {f'(x) \\over 2} + {f''(x) \\over 6} + {f'''(x) \\over 24} + \\cdots  ~.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThis can be used to produce the [[#Inversion|inversion formulae below]].\n\n==Another explicit formula==\n\nAn explicit formula for the Bernoulli polynomials is given by\n\n:<math>B_m(x)=\n\\sum_{n=0}^m \\frac{1}{n+1}\n\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \\choose k} (x+k)^m.</math>\n\nNote the remarkable similarity to the globally convergent series expression for the [[Hurwitz zeta function]]. Indeed, one has\n\n:<math>B_n(x) = -n \\zeta(1-n,x)</math>\n\nwhere ''ζ''(''s'',&nbsp;''q'') is the Hurwitz zeta; thus, in a certain sense, the Hurwitz zeta generalizes the Bernoulli polynomials to non-integer values of&nbsp;''n''.\n\nThe inner sum may be understood to be the ''n''th [[forward difference]] of ''x''<sup>''m''</sup>; that is,\n\n:<math>\\Delta^n x^m = \\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^{n-k} {n \\choose k} (x+k)^m</math>\n\nwhere Δ is the [[forward difference operator]]. Thus, one may write\n\n:<math>B_m(x)= \\sum_{n=0}^m \\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1} \\,\\Delta^n x^m. </math>\n\nThis formula may be derived from an identity appearing above as follows. Since the forward difference operator Δ equals\n:<math>\\Delta = e^D - 1</math>\nwhere ''D'' is differentiation with respect to ''x'', we have, from the [[Mercator series]]\n\n:<math>{D \\over e^D - 1} = {\\log(\\Delta + 1) \\over \\Delta} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty {(-\\Delta)^n \\over n+1}.</math>\n\nAs long as this operates on an ''m''th-degree polynomial such as ''x''<sup>''m''</sup>, one may let ''n'' go from 0 only up to&nbsp;''m''.\n\nAn integral representation for the Bernoulli polynomials is given by the [[Nörlund&ndash;Rice integral]], which follows from the expression as a finite difference.\n\nAn explicit formula for the Euler polynomials is given by\n\n:<math>E_m(x)=\n\\sum_{n=0}^m \\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k {n \\choose k} (x+k)^m\\,.</math>\n\nThe above follows analogously, using the fact that\n\n:<math> \\frac{2}{e^D + 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\Delta/2} = \\sum_{n = 0}^\\infty \\Bigl(-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\Bigr)^n. </math>\n\n==Sums of ''p''th powers==\n\nUsing either the above [[#Representation by an integral operator|integral representation]] of <math>x^n</math> or the [[#Differences and derivatives|identity]] <math> B_n(x + 1) - B_n(x) = nx^{n-1}</math>, we have\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^x k^p = \\int_0^{x+1} B_p(t) \\, dt = \\frac{B_{p+1}(x+1)-B_{p+1}}{p+1} </math>\n\n(assuming 0<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1). See [[Faulhaber's formula]] for more on this.\n\n==The Bernoulli and Euler numbers==\nThe [[Bernoulli number]]s are given by <math>\\textstyle B_n=B_n(0).</math>\n\nThis definition gives <math>\\textstyle \\zeta(-n) = \\frac{(-1)^n}{n+1}B_{n+1} </math> for <math>\\textstyle n=0, 1, 2, \\ldots</math>.\n\nAn alternate convention defines the Bernoulli numbers as <math>\\textstyle B_n=B_n(1).</math>\n\nThe two conventions differ only for <math>n=1</math> since <math>B_1(1)= \\tfrac{1}{2} = -B_1(0)</math>.\n\nThe [[Euler number]]s are given by <math>E_n=2^nE_n(\\tfrac{1}{2}).</math>\n\n==Explicit expressions for low degrees==\nThe first few Bernoulli polynomials are:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nB_0(x) & =1 \\\\[8pt]\nB_1(x) & =x-\\frac{1}{2} \\\\[8pt]\nB_2(x) & =x^2-x+\\frac{1}{6} \\\\[8pt]\nB_3(x) & =x^3-\\frac{3}{2}x^2+\\frac{1}{2}x \\\\[8pt]\nB_4(x) & =x^4-2x^3+x^2-\\frac{1}{30} \\\\[8pt]\nB_5(x) & =x^5-\\frac{5}{2}x^4+\\frac{5}{3}x^3-\\frac{1}{6}x \\\\[8pt]\nB_6(x) & =x^6-3x^5+\\frac{5}{2}x^4-\\frac{1}{2}x^2+\\frac{1}{42}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe first few Euler polynomials are:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\nE_0(x) & =1 \\\\[8pt]\nE_1(x) & =x-\\frac{1}{2} \\\\[8pt]\nE_2(x) & =x^2-x \\\\[8pt]\nE_3(x) & =x^3-\\frac{3}{2}x^2+\\frac{1}{4} \\\\[8pt]\nE_4(x) & =x^4-2x^3+x \\\\[8pt]\nE_5(x) & =x^5-\\frac{5}{2}x^4+\\frac{5}{2}x^2-\\frac{1}{2} \\\\[8pt]\nE_6(x) & =x^6-3x^5+5x^3-3x.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==Maximum and minimum==\n\nAt higher ''n'', the amount of variation in ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') between ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 gets large. For instance,\n\n:<math>B_{16}(x)=x^{16}-8x^{15}+20x^{14}-\\frac{182}{3}x^{12}+\\frac{572}{3}x^{10}-429x^8+\\frac{1820}{3}x^6\n-\\frac{1382}{3}x^4+140x^2-\\frac{3617}{510}</math>\n\nwhich shows that the value at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (and at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) is −3617/510 ≈&nbsp;−7.09, while at ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/2, the value is 118518239/3342336 ≈&nbsp;+7.09. [[D.H. Lehmer]]<ref>D.H. Lehmer, \"On the Maxima and Minima of Bernoulli Polynomials\", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', volume 47, pages 533–538 (1940)</ref> showed that the maximum value of ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') between 0 and 1 obeys\n\n:<math>M_n < \\frac{2n!}{(2\\pi)^n}</math>\n\nunless ''n'' is 2 modulo 4, in which case\n\n:<math>M_n = \\frac{2\\zeta(n)n!}{(2\\pi)^n}</math>\n\n(where <math>\\zeta(x)</math> is the [[Riemann zeta function]]), while the minimum obeys\n\n:<math>m_n > \\frac{-2n!}{(2\\pi)^n}</math>\n\nunless ''n'' is 0 modulo 4, in which case\n\n:<math>m_n = \\frac{-2\\zeta(n)n!}{(2\\pi)^n}.</math>\n\nThese limits are quite close to the actual maximum and minimum, and Lehmer gives more accurate limits as well.\n\n==Differences and derivatives==\n\nThe Bernoulli and Euler polynomials obey many relations from [[umbral calculus]]:\n\n:<math>\\Delta B_n(x) = B_n(x+1)-B_n(x)=nx^{n-1},</math>\n\n:<math>\\Delta E_n(x) = E_n(x+1)-E_n(x)=2(x^n-E_n(x)).</math>\n\n(Δ is the [[forward difference operator]]). Also,\n\n:<math> E_n(x+1) + E_n(x) = 2x^n.</math>\n\nThese [[polynomial sequence]]s are [[Appell sequence]]s:\n\n:<math>B_n'(x)=nB_{n-1}(x),</math>\n\n:<math>E_n'(x)=nE_{n-1}(x).</math>\n\n===Translations===\n\n:<math>B_n(x+y)=\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} B_k(x) y^{n-k}</math>\n\n:<math>E_n(x+y)=\\sum_{k=0}^n {n \\choose k} E_k(x) y^{n-k}</math>\n\nThese identities are also equivalent to saying that these polynomial sequences are [[Appell sequence]]s.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] defined on a [[Region (analysis)|region]] of the [[complex plane]] is said to be of '''bounded type''' if it is equal to the ratio of two analytic functions [[bounded function|bounded]] in that region. But more generally, a function is of bounded type in a region <math>\\Omega</math> if and only if <math>f</math> is [[Analytic function|analytic]] on <math>\\Omega</math> and <math>\\log^+|f(z)|</math> has a harmonic majorant on <math>\\Omega,</math>  where <math>\\log^+(x)=\\max[0,\\log(x)]</math>. Being the ratio of two bounded analytic functions is a sufficient condition for a function to be of bounded type (defined in terms of a harmonic majorant), and if <math>\\Omega</math> is [[simply connected]] the condition is also necessary.\n\nThe class of all such <math>f</math> on <math>\\Omega</math> is commonly denoted <math>N(\\Omega)</math> and is sometimes called the ''[[Rolf Nevanlinna|Nevanlinna]] class'' for <math>\\Omega</math>.  The Nevanlinna class includes all the [[Hardy class]]es.\n\nFunctions of bounded type are not necessarily bounded, nor do they have a property called \"type\" which is bounded. The reason for the name is probably that when defined on a disc, the [[Nevanlinna characteristic]] (a function of distance from the centre of the disc) is bounded.\n\nClearly, if a function is the ratio of two bounded functions, then it can be expressed as the ratio of two functions which are bounded by 1:\n:<math>f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)</math>\nThe logarithms of <math>|1/P(z)|</math> and of <math>|1/Q(z)|</math> are non-negative in the region, so\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log|f(z)|\n&=\\log|1/Q(z)|-\\log|1/P(z)|\\\\\n&\\le\\log|1/Q(z)|\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\log^+|f(z)|\n&=\\max[0,\\log|f(z)|]\\\\\n&\\le\\max(0,\\log|1/Q(z)|)\\\\\n&\\le\\log|1/Q(z)|\\\\\n&\\le-\\Re\\left(\\log Q(z)\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe latter is the real part of an analytic function and is therefore harmonic, showing that <math>\\log^+|f(z)|</math> has a harmonic majorant on Ω.\n\nFor a given region, sums, differences, and products of functions of bounded type are of bounded type, as is the quotient of two such functions as long as the denominator is not identically zero.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Polynomial]]s are of bounded type in any bounded region. They are also of bounded type in the [[upper half-plane]] (UHP), because a polynomial <math>f(z)</math> of degree ''n'' can be expressed as a ratio of two analytic functions bounded in the UHP:\n\n:<math>f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)</math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>P(z)=f(z)/(z+i)^n</math>\n\n:<math>Q(z)=1/(z+i)^n.</math>\n\nThe inverse of a polynomial is also of bounded type in a region, as is any [[rational function]].\n\nThe function <math>\\exp(aiz)</math> is of bounded type in the UHP if and only if ''a'' is real. If ''a'' is positive the function itself is bounded in the UHP (so we can use <math>Q(z)=1</math>), and if ''a'' is negative then the function equals 1/Q(z) with <math>Q(z)=\\exp(|a|iz)</math>.\n\nSine and cosine are of bounded type in the UHP. Indeed,\n\n:<math>\\sin(z)=P(z)/Q(z)</math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>P(z)=\\sin(z)\\exp(iz)</math>\n\n:<math>Q(z)=\\exp(iz)</math>\n\nboth of which are bounded in the UHP.\n\nAll of the above examples are of bounded type in the lower half-plane as well, using different ''P'' and ''Q'' functions. But the region mentioned in the definition of the term \"bounded type\" cannot be the whole complex plane unless the function is constant because one must use the same ''P'' and ''Q'' over the whole region, and the only [[entire function]]s (that is, analytic in the whole complex plane) which are bounded are constants, by [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]].\n\nAnother example in the upper half-plane is a \"[[Nevanlinna function]]\", that is, an analytic function that maps the UHP to the closed UHP. If ''f''(''z'') is of this type, then\n\n:<math>f(z)=P(z)/Q(z)</math>\n\nwhere ''P'' and ''Q'' are the bounded functions:\n\n:<math>P(z)=\\frac{f(z)}{f(z)+i}</math>\n\n:<math>Q(z)=\\frac 1{f(z)+i}</math>\n\n(This obviously applies as well to <math>f(z)/i</math>, that is, a function whose real part is non-negative in the UHP.)\n\n==Properties==\nFor a given region, the sum, product, or quotient of two (non-null) functions of bounded type is also of bounded type. The set of functions of bounded type is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the complex numbers and is in fact a [[field (algebra)|field]].\n\nAny function of bounded type in the upper half-plane (with a finite number of roots in some neighborhood of 0) can be expressed as a [[Blaschke product]] (an analytic function, bounded in the region, which factors out the zeros) multiplying the quotient <math>P(z)/Q(z)</math> where <math>P(z)</math> and <math>Q(z)</math> are bounded by 1 '''''and''''' have no zeros in the UHP. One can then express this quotient as\n\n:<math>P(z)/Q(z)=\\exp(-U(z))/\\exp(-V(z))</math>\n\nwhere <math>U(z)</math> and <math>V(z)</math> are analytic functions having non-negative real part in the UHP. Each of these in turn can be expressed by a [[Poisson representation]] (see [[Nevanlinna function]]s):\n\n:<math>U(z)= c -ipz -i \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda - z} - \\frac{\\lambda}{1+\\lambda^2} \\right) d\\mu(\\lambda)</math>\n\n:<math>V(z)= d -iqz -i \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda - z} - \\frac{\\lambda}{1+\\lambda^2} \\right) d\\nu(\\lambda)</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' and ''d'' are imaginary constants, ''p'' and ''q'' are non-negative real constants, and μ and ν are non-decreasing functions of a real variable (well behaved so the integrals converge). The difference ''q−p'' has been given the name \"mean type\" by [[Louis de Branges]] and describes the growth or decay of the function along the imaginary axis:\n\n:<math>q-p=\\limsup_{y\\to\\infty}y^{-1}\\ln|f(iy)|</math>\n\nThe mean type in the upper half-plane is the limit of a weighted average of the logarithm of the function's absolute value divided by distance from zero, normalized in such a way that the value for <math>\\exp(-iz)</math> is 1:<ref name=DeBranges>{{cite book|title=Hilbert spaces of entire functions|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Louis de Branges|authorlink=Louis de Branges|page=26}}</ref>\n\n:<math>q-p=\\lim_{r\\to\\infty}(2/\\pi)r^{-1}\\int_0^\\pi\\ln|f(re^{i\\theta})|\\sin\\theta d\\theta</math>\n\nIf an [[entire function]] is of bounded type in both the upper and the lower half-plane then it is of [[exponential type]] equal to the higher of the two respective \"mean types\"<ref>According to a theorem of [[Mark Krein]]. See p. 26 of the book by de Branges.</ref> (and the higher one will be non-negative). An entire function of order greater than 1 (which means that in some direction it grows faster than a function of exponential type) cannot be of bounded type in any half-plane.\n\nWe may thus produce a function of bounded type by using an appropriate exponential of ''z'' and exponentials of arbitrary Nevanlinna functions multiplied by ''i'', for example:\n\n:<math>f(z)=\\exp(iz)\\frac{\\exp(i\\sqrt{z})}{\\exp(-i/\\sqrt{z})}</math>\n\nConcerning the examples given above, the mean type of polynomials or their inverses is zero. The mean type of <math>\\exp(aiz)</math> in the upper half-plane is −''a'', while in the lower half-plane it is ''a''. The mean type of <math>\\sin(z)</math> in both half-planes is 1.\n\nFunctions of bounded type in the upper half-plane with non-positive mean type and having a continuous, [[square-integrable]] [[analytic extension|extension]] to the real axis have the interesting property (useful in applications) that the integral (along the real axis)\n\n:<math>\\frac 1{2\\pi i}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty\\frac{f(t)dt}{t-z}</math>\n\nequals <math>f(z)</math> if ''z'' is in the upper half-plane and zero if ''z'' is in the lower half-plane.<ref>Theorem 12 in the book by de Branges.</ref> This may be termed the [[Cauchy formula]] for the upper half-plane.\n\n==See also==\n*[[De Branges space]]\n*[[Rolf Nevanlinna]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book | title=Functions of a Complex Variable II | volume=159 | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn=0-387-94460-5 | first=John B. | last=Conway | authorlink=John B.

It is also referred to as the '''Cantor ternary function''', the '''Lebesgue function''',<ref>{{harvnb|Vestrup|2003|loc=Section 4.6.}}</ref> '''Lebesgue's singular function''', the '''Cantor–Vitali function''', the '''Devil's staircase''',<ref>{{harvnb|Thomson|Bruckner|Bruckner|2008|p=252}}.</ref> the '''Cantor staircase function''',<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CantorStaircaseFunction.html</ref> and the '''Cantor–Lebesgue function'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Bass|2013|p=28}}.</ref> {{harvs|txt|first=Georg |last=Cantor|authorlink=Georg Cantor|year=1884}} introduced the Cantor function and mentioned that Scheeffer pointed out that it was a [[counterexample]] to an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus claimed by [[Carl Gustav Axel Harnack|Harnack]]. The Cantor function was discussed and popularized by {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}}, {{harvtxt|Lebesgue|1904}} and {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}}.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Cantor function.gif|300px|right]]\n\nSee figure. To formally define the Cantor function ''c'' : [0,1] → [0,1], let ''x'' be in [0,1] and obtain ''c''(''x'') by the following steps:\n\n#Express ''x'' in base 3.  \n#If ''x'' contains a 1, replace every digit strictly after the first 1 by 0.\n#Replace any remaining 2s with 1s.\n#Interpret the result as a binary number. The result is ''c''(''x'').\n\nFor example:\n* 1/4 is 0.02020202... in base 3. There are no 1s so the next stage is still 0.02020202... This is rewritten as 0.01010101... When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/3, so ''c''(1/4) = 1/3.\n* 1/5 is 0.01210121... in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.01000000... This is not rewritten since there are no 2s. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 1/4, so ''c''(1/5) = 1/4.\n* 200/243 is 0.21102 (or 0.211012222...) in base 3. The digits after the first 1 are replaced by 0s to produce 0.21. This is rewritten as 0.11. When read in base 2, this corresponds to 3/4, so ''c''(200/243) = 3/4.\n\n==Properties==\nThe Cantor function challenges naive intuitions about [[continuous function|continuity]] and [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]; though it is continuous everywhere and has zero derivative [[almost everywhere]], <math display=\"inline\">c(x)</math> goes from 0 to 1 as <math display=\"inline>x</math> goes from 0 to 1, and takes on every value in between.  The Cantor function is the most frequently cited example of a real function that is [[uniformly continuous]] (precisely, it is [[Hölder continuous]] of  exponent  ''α''&nbsp;=&nbsp;log&nbsp;2/log&nbsp;3) but not [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]]. It is constant on intervals of the form (0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>022222..., 0.''x''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sub>2</sub>''x''<sub>3</sub>...''x''<sub>n</sub>200000...), and every point not in the Cantor set is in one of these intervals, so its derivative is 0 outside of the Cantor set. On the other hand, it has no [[derivative]] at any point in an [[uncountable]] subset of the [[Cantor set]] containing the interval endpoints described above.\n\nThe Cantor function can also be seen as the [[cumulative distribution function|cumulative probability distribution function]] of the 1/2-1/2 [[Bernoulli scheme|Bernoulli measure]] ''μ'' supported on the Cantor set: <math display=\"inline\">c(x)=\\mu([0,x])</math>. This probability distribution, called the [[Cantor distribution]], has no discrete part. That is, the corresponding measure is [[Atom (measure theory)|atomless]]. This is why there are no jump discontinuities in the function; any such jump would correspond to an atom in the measure.\n\nHowever, no non-constant part of the Cantor function can be represented as an integral of a [[probability density function]]; integrating any putative [[probability density function]] that is not [[almost everywhere]] zero over any interval will give positive probability to some interval to which this distribution assigns probability zero. In particular, as {{harvtxt|Vitali|1905}} pointed out, the function is not the integral of its derivative even though the derivative exists almost everywhere.\n\nThe Cantor function is the standard example of a [[singular function]].\n\nThe Cantor function is non-decreasing, and so in particular its graph defines a [[rectifiable curve]].  {{harvtxt|Scheeffer|1884}} showed that the arc length of its graph is 2.\n\n===Lack of absolute continuity===\nBecause the [[Lebesgue measure]] of the [[Uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] [[Cantor set]] is 0, for any positive ''ε''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1 and ''δ'', there exists a finite sequence of [[pairwise disjoint]] sub-intervals with total length <&nbsp;''δ'' over which the Cantor function cumulatively rises more than&nbsp;''ε''.\n\nIn fact, to every ''δ''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 there are finitely many pairwise disjoint intervals (''x<SUB>k</SUB>'',''y<SUB>k</SUB>'') (1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''M'') with <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (y_k-x_k)<\\delta</math> and <math>\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^M (c(y_k)-c(x_k))=1</math>.\n\n== Alternative definitions ==\n\n=== Iterative construction ===\n[[File:Cantor function sequence.png|250px|right]]\n\nBelow we define a sequence {''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>} of functions on the unit interval that converges to the Cantor function.\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(''x'') = ''x''.\n\nThen, for every integer {{nowrap|''n'' &ge; 0}}, the next function ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'') will be defined in terms of ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'') as follows:\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|0.5 &times; ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(3''x'')}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|0 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= 0.5,&nbsp; when {{nowrap|1/3 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 2/3&thinsp;}};\n\nLet ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|0.5 + 0.5  &times; ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(3&thinsp;''x'' &minus; 2)}},&nbsp; when {{nowrap|2/3 ≤ ''x'' ≤ 1}}.\n\nThe three definitions are compatible at the end-points 1/3 and 2/3, because ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0 and ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 for every&nbsp;''n'', by induction.  One may check that ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''</sub> converges pointwise to the Cantor function defined above.  Furthermore, the convergence is uniform.  Indeed, separating into three cases, according to the definition of ''&fnof;''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, one sees that\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n+1}(x) - f_n(x)| \\le \\frac 1 2 \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_{n}(x) - f_{n-1}(x)|, \\quad n \\ge 1.</math>\n\nIf ''&fnof;'' denotes the limit function, it follows that, for every ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;0,\n\n:<math>\\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f(x) - f_n(x)| \\le 2^{-n+1} \\, \\max_{x \\in [0, 1]} |f_1(x) - f_0(x)|.</math>\n\nAlso the choice of starting function does not really matter, provided ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(0)&nbsp;= 0, ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub>(1)&nbsp;= 1 and ''&fnof;''<sub>0</sub> is [[Bounded function|bounded]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.\n\n=== Fractal volume ===\nThe Cantor function is closely related to the [[Cantor set]]. The Cantor set ''C'' can be defined as the set of those numbers in the interval [0,&nbsp;1] that do not contain the digit 1 in their [[base (exponentiation)|base-3 (triadic) expansion]], except if the 1 is followed by zeros only (in which case the tail 1000<math>\\ldots</math> can be replaced by 0222<math>\\ldots</math> to get rid of any 1). It turns out that the Cantor set is a [[fractal]] with (uncountably) infinitely many points (zero-dimensional volume), but zero length (one-dimensional volume).  Only the ''D''-dimensional volume <math> H_D </math> (in the sense of a [[Hausdorff dimension|Hausdorff-measure]]) takes a finite value, where <math> D = \\log(2)/\\log(3) </math> is the fractal dimension of ''C''.  We may define the Cantor function alternatively as the ''D''-dimensional volume of sections of the Cantor set\n\n: <math>\nf(x)=H_D(C \\cap (0,x)). \n</math>\n\n== Generalizations ==\nLet\n\n: <math>y=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k 2^{-k}</math>\n\nbe the [[dyadic rational|dyadic]] (binary) expansion of the real number 0 ≤ ''y'' ≤ 1 in terms of binary digits ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> &isin; {0,1}. Then consider the function\n\n: <math>C_z(y)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty b_k z^{k}.</math>\n\nFor ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/3, the inverse of the function ''x'' = 2&nbsp;''C''<sub>1/3</sub>(''y'') is the Cantor function.  That is, ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''y''(''x'') is the Cantor function. In general, for any ''z''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;1/2, ''C''<sub>''z''</sub>(''y'') looks like the Cantor function turned on its side, with the width of the steps getting wider as ''z'' approaches zero.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Cantor function is also the cumulative distribution function of a measure on the Cantor set. Different Cantor functions, or Devil's Staircases, can be obtained by considering different atom-less probability measures supported on the Cantor set or other fractals. While the Cantor function has derivative 0 almost everywhere, current research focusses on the question of the size of the set of points where the upper right derivative is distinct from the lower right derivative, causing the derivative to not exist. This analysis of differentiability is usually given in terms of [[fractal dimension]], with the Hausdorff dimension the most popular choice. This line of research was started in the 90s by Darst,<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Hausdorff Dimension of the Nondifferentiability Set of the Cantor Function is [ ln(2)/ln(3) ]2|jstor = 2159830|journal = Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society|date = 1993-09-01|pages = 105–108|volume = 119|issue = 1|doi = 10.2307/2159830|first = Richard|last = Darst}}</ref> who showed that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of non-differentiability of the Cantor function is the square of the dimension of the Cantor set, <math>(\\log2/\\log3)^2</math>.

The question mark function has the interesting property of having vanishing derivatives at all rational numbers.\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|first1=Richard Franklin|last1=Bass|author1-link=Richard F.
