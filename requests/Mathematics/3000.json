The size of the hyperbolic angle is equal to the [[area]] of the corresponding [[hyperbolic sector]] of the hyperbola {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 1}}, or twice the area of the corresponding sector of the [[unit hyperbola]] {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> − ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}, just as a [[angle|circular angle]] is twice the area of the [[circular sector]] of the [[unit circle]].

For such a function, it is common to define a [[principal value]], which is a single valued analytic function which coincides with one specific branch of the multivalued function over a domain consisting of the [[complex plane]] in which a finite number of [[arc (geometry)|arcs]] (usually [[half line]]s or [[line segment]]s) have been removed. These arcs are called [[branch cut]]s. For specifying the branch, that is defining which value of the multivalued function is considered at each point, one generally define it at a particular point, and deduce the value everywhere in the domain of definition of the principal value by [[analytic continuation]]. When possible, it is better to define the principal value directly, without referring to analytic continuation.\n\nFor example, for the square root, the principal value is defined as the square root that has a positive [[real part]]. This defines a single valued analytic function, which is defined everywhere except for non-positive real values of the variables (where the two square roots have a zero real part). This principal value of the square root function is denoted <math>\\sqrt x</math> in what follows. Similarly, the principal value of the logarithm, denoted <math>\\operatorname{Log}</math> in what follows, is defined as the value for which the [[imaginary part]] as the smallest absolute value. It is defined everywhere except for non positive real values of the variable, for which two different values of the logarithm reach the minimum.\n\nFor all inverse hyperbolic functions, the principal value may be defined in terms of principal values of the square root and the logarithm function. However, in some cases, the formulas of {{slink||Definitions in terms of logarithms}} do not give a correct principal value, as giving a domain of definition which is too small and, in one case [[connected space|non-connected]].\n\n===Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic sine===\n\nThe principal value of the inverse hyperbolic sine is given by \n:<math>\\operatorname{arsinh} z = \\operatorname{Log}(z + \\sqrt{z^2 + 1} \\,)\\,.</math>\n\nThe argument of the square root is a non-positive real number if and only if {{math|''z''}} belongs to one of the intervals {{math|[''i'', +''i''∞)}} and {{math|(−''i''∞, −''i'']}} of the imaginary axis. If the argument of the logarithm is real, then it is positive. Thus this formula defines a principal value for arsinh with branch cuts  {{math|[''i'', +''i''∞)}} and  {{math|(−''i''∞, −''i'']}}. This is optimal, as the branch cuts must connect the singular points {{math|''i''}} and {{math|−''i''}} to the infinity.\n\n===Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosine=== \nThe formula for the inverse hyperbolic cosine given in {{slink||Inverse hyperbolic cosine}} is not convenient, as, with principal values of the logarithm and the square root, the principal value of arcosh would not be defined for imaginary {{math|''z''}}. Thus the square root has to be factorized, leading to\n:<math>\\operatorname{arcosh}  z = \\operatorname{Log}(z + \\sqrt{z+1} \\sqrt{z-1} \\,)\\,.</math>\n\nThe principal values of the square roots are both defined except if {{math|''z''}} belongs to the real interval {{math|(−∞, 1]}}. If the argument of the logarithm is real, then {{math|''z''}} is real and has the same sign. Thus, the above formula defines a principal value of arcosh outside the real interval {{math|(−∞, 1]}}, which is thus the unique branch cut.\n\n===Principal values of the inverse hyperbolic tangent and cotangent===\n\nThe formulas given in {{slink||Definitions in terms of logarithms}} suggests  \n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{artanh} z  &=\\frac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left(\\frac{1+z}{1-z}\\right) \n    \\\\\n \\operatorname{arcoth} z &=  \\frac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left(\\frac{z+1}{z-1}\\right)\n  \\end{align}\n</math>\nfor the definition of the principal values of the inverse hyperbolic tangent and cotangent. In these formulas, the argument of the logarithm is real if and only if {{math|''z''}} is real. For artanh, this argument is in the real interval {{math|(−∞, 0]}} if {{math|''z''}} belongs either to  {{math|(−∞, −1]}} or to {{math|[1, ∞)}}. For arcoth, the argument of the logarithm is in {{math|(−∞, 0]}} if and only if {{math|''z''}} belongs to the real interval {{math|[−1, 1]}}.\n\nTherefore, these formulas define convenient principal values, for which the branch cuts are  {{math|(−∞, −1]}} and {{math|[1, ∞)}} for the inverse hyperbolic tangent, and {{math|[−1, 1]}} for the inverse hyperbolic cotangent.\n\nIn view of a better numerical evaluation near the branch cuts, some authors{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} use the following equivalent definition of the principal values, although the second one introduces a [[removable singularity]] at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n:<math>\n  \\begin{align}\n    \\operatorname{artanh} z &= \\tfrac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left({1+z}\\right) -  \\tfrac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left({1-z}\\right)\n    \\\\\n    \\operatorname{arcoth} z &= \\tfrac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left({1+\\frac{1}{z} }\\right) -   \\tfrac12\\operatorname{Log}\\left({1-\\frac{1}{z}}\\right)\n \\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic cosecant===\n\nFor the inverse hyperbolic cosecant, the principal value is defined as\n:<math>\\operatorname{arcsch} z = \\operatorname{Log}\\left( \\frac{1}{z} + \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{z^2} +1 } \\,\\right)</math>.\n\nIt is defined when the arguments of the logarithm and the square root are not non-positive real numbers. The principal value of the square root is thus defined outside the interval {{math|[−''i'', ''i'']}} of the imaginary line. If the argument of the logarithm is real, then {{math|''z''}} is a non-zero real number, and this implies that the argument of the logarithm is positive.\n\nThus the principal value is defined by the above formula outside the [[branch cut]] consisting of the interval {{math|[−''i'', ''i'']}} of the imaginary line.\n\nFor   {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}, there is a singular point that is included in the branch cut.\n\n===Principal value of the inverse hyperbolic secant===\n\nHere, as in the case of the inverse hyperbolic cosine, we have to factorize the square root. This gives the principal value\n:<math>\n    \\operatorname{arsech} z = \\operatorname{Log}\\left( \\frac{1}{z} + \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{z} + 1 } \\, \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{z} -1 } \\right).\n</math>\n\nIf the argument of a square root is real, then {{math|''z''}} is real, and it follows that both principal values of square roots are defined except if {{math|''z''}} is real and belongs to one of the intervals {{math|(−∞, 0]}} and {{math|[1, +∞)}}. If the argument of the logarithm is real and negative, then {{math|''z''}} is also real and negative. It follows that the principal value of arsech is well defined by the above formula outside two [[branch cut]]s, the real intervals {{math|(−∞, 0]}} and {{math|[1, +∞)}}.\n\nFor   {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}, there is a singular point that is included in one of the branch cuts.\n\n===Graphical representation===\n\nIn the following graphical representation of the principal values of the inverse hyperbolic functions, the branch cuts appear as discontinuities of the color. The fact that the whole branch cuts appear as discontinuities, shows that these principal values may not be extended into analytic functions defined over larger domains. In other words, the above defined [[branch cut]]s are minimal.\n\n{{multiple image\n | perrow = 3\n | align = center\n | width = 200\n | footer = Inverse hyperbolic functions in the complex z-plane: the colour at each point in the plane [[domain coloring|represents the complex value]] of the respective function at that point\n | image1 = Complex ArcSinh.jpg\n | image2 = Complex ArcCosh.jpg\n | image3 = Complex ArcTanh.jpg\n | image4 = Complex ArcCoth.jpg\n | image5 = Complex ArcSech.jpg\n | image6 = Complex ArcCsch.jpg\n | alt1 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | alt2 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | alt3 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | alt4 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | alt5 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | alt6 = Square representing central portion of the complex z-plane painted in psychedelic colours\n | caption1 = <math>\\operatorname{arsinh}(z)</math>\n | caption2 = <math>\\operatorname{arcosh}(z)</math>\n | caption3 = <math>\\operatorname{artanh}(z)</math>\n | caption4 = <math>\\operatorname{arcoth}(z)</math>\n | caption5 = <math>\\operatorname{arsech}(z)</math>\n | caption6 = <math>\\operatorname{arcsch}(z)</math>\n }}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Complex logarithm]]\n*[[ISO 80000-2]]\n*[[List of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Bronshtein_2005\">{{cite book |author-first1=Ilja N. |author-last1=Bronshtein |author-first2=Konstantin A. |author-last2=Semendyayev |author-first3=Gerhard |author-last3=Musiol |author-first4=Heiner |author-last4=Mühlig |title=Handbook of Mathematics |title-link=Handbook of Mathematics |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |edition=5 |date=2007 |isbn=3-540-72121-5 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-72122-2 |page=91 |chapter=Chapter 2.10: Area Functions}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Ebner_2005\">{{cite book |title=Preparatory Course in Mathematics |author-first=Dieter |author-last=Ebner |publisher=Department of Physics, [[University of Konstanz]] |date=2005-07-25 |edition=6 |url=https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/numerik/personen/gubisch/de/teaching/ws0708/vorkurs-skript.pdf |access-date=2017-07-26 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726195140/https://www.math.uni-konstanz.de/numerik/personen/gubisch/de/teaching/ws0708/vorkurs-skript.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-26}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Mejlbro_2006\">{{cite book |title=Real Functions in One Variable – Calculus |volume=1a |author-first1=Leif |author-last1=Mejlbro |publisher=[[Ventus Publishing ApS]] / [[Bookboon]] |date=2006 |edition=1 |isbn=87-7681-117-4 |url=http://lib.bvu.edu.vn/bitstream/TVDHBRVT/15641/1/Real-Functions-in-One-Variable.pdf |access-date=2017-07-26 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170726213654/http://lib.bvu.edu.vn/bitstream/TVDHBRVT/15641/1/Real-Functions-in-One-Variable.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-26}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Mejlbro_2008\">{{cite book |title=The Argument Principle and Many-valued Functions -

When {{math|''x'' < 0}}, the angle apparent from the expression above is pointing in the opposite direction of the correct angle and a value of {{pi}} (or 180°) must be either added or subtracted from {{mvar|θ}} to put the cartesian point {{math|(''x'',''y'')}} into the correct quadrant of the [[Euclidean plane]].<ref>http://scipp.ucsc.edu/~haber/ph116A/arg_11.pdf</ref>  This requires knowledge of the signs of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} separately, which is information lost when {{mvar|y}} is divided by {{mvar|x}}.\n\nSince any integer multiple of {{math|2''&pi;''}} can be added to the angle {{mvar|θ}} without changing either {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}}, implying an ambiguous value for the returned value, the [[principal value]] of the angle, in the interval {{math|(-{{pi}}, {{pi}}]}} is returned.  {{mvar|θ}} is [[Sign (mathematics)#Sign of an angle|signed]], with counterclockwise angles being positive, and clockwise being negative. Specifically, <math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x)</math> is in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{closed-closed|0, {{pi}}}} when {{math|''y'' ≥ 0}}, and in {{open-open|&minus;''&pi;'', 0}} when {{math|''y'' < 0}}.\n\n==History and motivation==\n\n[[File:Atan2_argument_sign_graph.svg|thumb|Graph of the tangent function from &minus;{{pi}} to +{{pi}} with the corresponding signs of y over x. The green arrows point to the results of atan2(-1,-1) and atan2(1,1).]]\nThe {{math|atan2}} function was first introduced in computer [[programming language]]s, but now it is also common in other fields of science and engineering. It dates back at least as far as the [[FORTRAN]] programming language<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Organick\n | first = Elliott I.\n | authorlink = \n | coauthors = \n | year =1966 \n | title =A FORTRAN IV Primer\n | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n | location = \n | quote =\"Some processors also offer the library function called ATAN2, a function of two arguments (opposite and adjacent).\" \n | pages = 42\n}}</ref>\nand is currently found in many modern [[programming language]]s. Among these languages are: [[C (programming language)|C]]'s [[math.h]] [[C standard library|standard library]], the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] Math library, .NET's System.Math (usable from [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[VB.NET]], etc.), the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] math module, the [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] Math module, the [[Go (programming language)|Golang]] math package<ref>{{cite web|url=https://golang.org/src/math/atan2.go|title=src/math/atan2.go - The Go Programming Language|author=|date=|website=golang.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>, and elsewhere. In addition, many scripting languages, such as [[Perl]], include the C-style <tt>atan2(y,x)</tt> function.\n\nThe single-argument [[arctangent]] function cannot distinguish between diametrically opposite directions. For example, the anticlockwise angle from the {{mvar|x}}-axis to the vector {{math|(1, 1)}}, calculated in the usual way as {{math|arctan(1/1)}}, is {{math|π/4}} (radians), or {{math|45°}}. However, the angle between the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vector {{math|(−1, −1)}} appears, by the same method, to be {{math|arctan(−1/−1)}}, again {{math|π/4}}, even though one might expect the answers {{math|−3π/4}}, or {{math|5π/4}}, {{math|−135°}} or {{math|225°}}. In addition, an attempt to find the angle between the {{mvar|x}}-axis and the vectors {{math|(0, y), y ≠ 0}} requires evaluation of {{math|arctan(y/0)}}, which fails on division by zero.\n\nThe {{math|atan2}} function calculates one unique [[arc tangent]] value from two variables {{math|y}} and {{math|x}}, where the [[positive and negative numbers|signs]] of both arguments are used to determine the [[Cartesian coordinate system|quadrant]] of the result, thereby selecting the desired branch of the [[arc tangent]] of {{math|y/x}}, e.g., {{math|1=atan2 (1, 1) = π/4}} and {{math|1=atan2 (−1, −1) = −3π/4}}. Similarly, e.g., {{math|1=atan2 (1, 0 )= π/2}}. \n\nWhen calculations are performed manually, the necessary quadrant corrections and exception handling can be done by inspection, but it is more useful to have a single function that always gives an unambiguous correct result.\nThe {{math|atan2}} function is useful in many applications involving [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] in [[Euclidean space]], such as finding the direction from one point to another. A principal use is in computer graphics rotations, for converting [[rotation matrix]] representations into [[Euler angle]]s.\n\n==Definition and computation==\n{{anchor|Definition}}\nThe function {{math|atan2}} computes the [[principal value]] of the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] function applied to the [[complex number]] {{math|''x''+i''y''}}. That is, {{math|atan2(''y'', ''x'') {{=}} Pr arg(''x''+i''y'') {{=}} Arg(''x''+i''y'')}}. The argument could be changed by an arbitrary multiple of {{math|2π}} (corresponding to a complete turn around the origin) without making any difference to the angle, but to define {{math|atan2}} uniquely one uses the principal value in the [[interval (mathematics)|range]] <math>(-\\pi, \\pi]</math>, that is, {{math|−''π'' < atan2(''y'', ''x'') ≤ ''π''}}. \n\nIn terms of the standard {{math|arctan}} function, whose range is {{open-open|−{{sfrac|π|2}}, {{sfrac|π|2}}}}, it can be expressed as follows:\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\arctan(\\frac y x) &\\text{if } x > 0, \\\\\n\\arctan(\\frac y x) + \\pi &\\text{if } x < 0 \\text{ and } y \\ge 0, \\\\\n\\arctan(\\frac y x) - \\pi &\\text{if } x < 0 \\text{ and } y < 0, \\\\\n+\\frac{\\pi}{2} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y > 0, \\\\\n-\\frac{\\pi}{2} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y < 0, \\\\\n\\text{undefined} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y = 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nA compact expression with four overlapping half-planes is\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) &\\text{if } x > 0, \\\\\n\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) &\\text{if } y > 0, \\\\\n-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x}{y}\\right) &\\text{if } y < 0, \\\\\n\\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right) \\pm \\pi &\\text{if } x < 0, \\\\\n\\text{undefined} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y = 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe following expression derived from the [[tangent half-angle formula]] can also be used to define {{math|atan2}}:\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2} (y,\\, x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2 \\arctan\\biggl(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\\biggr) \n  &\\text{if } x > 0 \\text{ or } y \\neq 0, \\\\\n\\pi &\\text{if } x < 0 \\text{ and } y = 0, \\\\\n\\text{undefined} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y = 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\nThis expression may be more suited for symbolic use than the definition above. However it is unsuitable for general [[floating point]] computational use, as the effect of rounding errors \nin <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}</math> expand near the region {{math|1=''x'' < 0, ''y'' = 0}} (this may even lead to a division of ''y'' by zero). \n\nA variant of the last formula that avoids these inflated rounding errors:\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2} (y,\\, x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2 \\arctan\\biggl(\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} + x}\\biggr) &\\text{if } x > 0, \\\\\n2 \\arctan\\biggl(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - x}{y}\\biggr) \n  &\\text{if } x \\leq 0 \\text{ and } y \\neq 0, \\\\\n\\pi &\\text{if } x < 0 \\text{ and } y = 0, \\\\\n\\text{undefined} &\\text{if } x = 0 \\text{ and } y = 0.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nNotes:\n* This produces results in the range {{open-closed|−π, π}}, which can be mapped to {{closed-open|0, 2π}} by adding {{math|2π}} to negative results.\n\n[[File:The principal value of the argument (-atan2- in some circles).svg|thumb|The derivation of the principal value of the argument refers to this figure]]\n* As mentioned above, the principal value of the argument {{math|atan2(''y'', ''x'')}} can be related to {{math|arctan(''y/x'')}} by trigonometry. The derivation goes as follows: \nIf {{math|(''x'',''y'') {{=}} (''r'' cos ''θ'', ''r'' sin ''θ'')}} then {{math|tan {{sfrac|''θ''|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|''y''|''r'' + ''x''}}}}. It follows that\n:<math>\\text{atan2}(y,x)=\\theta=2{\\theta\\over2}=2\\arctan{y\\over\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+x}\\ .</math>\nNote that {{math|{{sqrt|''x''{{sup|2}} + ''y''{{sup|2}}}} + ''x'' ≠ 0}} in the domain in question.\n\n==Derivative==\n{{details|Winding number}}\nAs the function {{math|atan2}} is a function of two variables, it has two [[partial derivative]]s. At points where these derivatives exist, {{math|atan2}} is, except for a constant, equal to {{math|arctan(''y''/''x'')}}. Hence for {{math|''x'' > 0}} or {{math|''y'' ≠ 0}},\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\operatorname{atan2}(y,\\, x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\arctan\\left(\\frac y x \\right) = -\\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2}, \\\\[5pt]\n& \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\operatorname{atan2}(y,\\, x) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\arctan\\left(\\frac y x \\right) = \\frac x {x^2 + y^2}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThus the [[gradient]] of atan2 is given by\n:<math>\\nabla \\text{atan2}(y,x)=\\left({x\\over x^2+y^2}, \\ {-y\\over x^2+y^2}\\right).</math>\n\nInformally representing the function {{math|atan2}} as the angle function {{math|1=''θ''(''x'', ''y'') = atan2(''y'', ''x'')}} (which is only defined up to a constant) yields the following formula for the [[total differential]]:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{d}\\theta\n&= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\operatorname{atan2}(y,\\, x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\operatorname{atan2}(y,\\, x)\\,\\mathrm{d}y \\\\[5pt]\n&= -\\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}x + \\frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}y.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhile the function {{math|atan2}} is discontinuous along the negative {{mvar|x}}-axis, reflecting the fact that angle cannot be continuously defined, this derivative is continuously defined except at the origin, reflecting the fact that infinitesimal (and indeed local) ''changes'' in angle can be defined everywhere except the origin. Integrating this derivative along a path gives the total change in angle over the path, and integrating over a closed loop gives the [[winding number]].\n\nIn the language of [[differential geometry]], this derivative is a [[one-form]], and it is [[closed differential form|closed]] (its derivative is zero) but not [[exact differential form|exact]] (it is not the derivative of a 0-form, i.e., a function), and in fact it generates the first [[de Rham cohomology]] of the [[punctured plane]]. This is the most basic example of such a form, and it is fundamental in differential geometry.\n\nThe partial derivatives of {{math|atan2}} do not contain trigonometric functions, making it particularly useful in many applications (e.g. embedded systems) where trigonometric functions can be expensive to evaluate.\n\n==Illustrations==\n[[File:Atan2 60.svg|thumb|right|300px|atan2 for selected rays]]\n\nThis figure shows values of atan2 along selected rays from the origin, labelled at the unit circle. The values, in radians, are shown inside the circle. The diagram uses the standard mathematical convention that angles increase [[Clockwise|counterclockwise]] from zero along the ray to the right. Note that the order of arguments is reversed; the function {{math|atan2(''y'', ''x'')}} computes the angle corresponding to the point {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}.\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Atan2atan.png|thumb|right|300px|Comparison of [[Inverse trigonometric functions|arctan]] and atan2 functions]]\nThis figure shows the values of <math>\\arctan(\\tan(\\theta))</math> alongside with <math>\\operatorname {atan2}(\\sin(\\theta),\\cos(\\theta))</math> for <math>0\\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi</math>.

Note that for {{math|atan2(''y'', ''x'')}}, ''rays'' in the ''X''/''Y''-plane emanating from the origin have constant values, but for {{math|arctan({{sfrac|''y''|''x''}})}} ''lines'' in the ''X''/''Y''-plane passing through the origin have constant values. For {{math|''x'' > 0}}, the two diagrams give identical values.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\n| [[File:Atan2_diagram.svg|300px]]\n| [[File:Atan_diagram.svg|300px]]\n|}\n\n==Angle sum and difference identity==\n{{Main article|List of trigonometric identities#Angle sum and difference identities}}\n\nSums of <math>\\operatorname{atan2}</math> may be collapsed into a single operation according to the following identity\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{atan2} (y_1, x_1) \\pm \\operatorname{atan2} (y_2, x_2) = \\operatorname{atan2} (y_1 x_2 \\pm y_2 x_1, x_1 x_2 \\mp y_1 y_2)</math>\n\n...provided that <math>\\operatorname{atan2} (y_1, x_1) \\pm \\operatorname{atan2} (y_2, x_2) \\in (-\\pi, \\pi]</math>.\n\nThe proof involves considering two cases, one where <math>y_2 \\neq 0</math> or <math>x_2 > 0</math> and one where <math>y_2 = 0</math> and <math>x_2 < 0</math>.\n\nWe only consider the case where <math>y_2 \\neq 0</math> or <math>x_2 > 0</math>.

Thus implementations of {{math|atan(''y'')}} will probably choose to compute {{math|atan2(''y'', 1)}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[hypot]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://www.medcalc.org/manual/atan2_function.php ATAN2 Online calculator]\n*[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#atan2%28double,%20double%29 Java 1.6 SE JavaDoc]\n*[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1008481 atan2] at Everything2\n*[http://www.picbasic.co.uk/forum/showthread.php?p=70269#post70269 PicBasic Pro solution] atan2 for a PIC18F\n\n;Other implementations/code for atan2\n*[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/55417.html Bearing Between Two Points]\n*[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/54114.html Arctan and Polar Coordinates]\n*[http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/54172.html What's 'Arccos'?]\n\n[[Category:Inverse trigonometric functions]]"

That is, for any real number {{mvar|x}},\n:<math>x=\\log_2 n \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad 2^x=n.</math>\nFor example, the binary logarithm of {{math|1}} is {{math|0}}, the binary logarithm of {{math|2}} is {{math|1}}, the binary logarithm of {{math|4}} is&nbsp;{{math|2}}, and the binary logarithm of {{math|32}} is&nbsp;{{math|5}}.\n\nThe binary logarithm is the [[logarithm]] to the base {{math|2}}. The binary logarithm function is the [[inverse function]] of the [[power of two]] function. As well as {{math|log<sub>2</sub>}}, alternative notations for the binary logarithm include {{math|lg}}, {{math|ld}}, {{math|lb}} (the notation preferred by [[ISO 31-11]] and [[ISO 80000-2]]), and (with a prior statement that the default base is&nbsp;2) {{math|log}}.\n\nHistorically, the first application of binary logarithms was in [[music theory]], by [[Leonhard Euler]]: the binary logarithm of a frequency ratio of two musical tones gives the number of [[octave]]s by which the tones differ. Binary logarithms can be used to calculate the length of the representation of a number in the [[binary numeral system]], or the number of [[bit]]s needed to encode a message in [[information theory]]. In [[computer science]], they count the number of steps needed for [[binary search]] and related algorithms. Other areas\nin which the binary logarithm is frequently used include [[combinatorics]], [[bioinformatics]], the design of sports [[tournament]]s, and [[photography]].\n\nBinary logarithms are included in the standard [[C mathematical functions]] and other mathematical software packages.\nThe integer part of a binary logarithm can be found using the [[find first set]] operation on an integer value, or by looking up the exponent of a [[floating point]] value.\nThe fractional part of the logarithm can be calculated efficiently.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of logarithms}}\n[[File:Leonhard Euler.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Leonhard Euler]] was the first to apply binary logarithms to [[music theory]], in 1739.]]\nThe [[power of two|powers of two]] have been known since antiquity; for instance they appear in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], Props. IX.32 (on the [[factorization]] of powers of two) and IX.36 (half of the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]], on the structure of even [[perfect number]]s).\nAnd the binary logarithm of a power of two is just its position in the ordered sequence of powers of two.\nOn this basis, [[Michael Stifel]] has been credited with publishing the first known table of binary logarithms in 1544. His book ''Arithmetica Integra'' contains several tables that show the [[integer]]s with their corresponding powers of two. Reversing the rows of these tables allow them to be interpreted as tables of binary logarithms.<ref>\n{{Citation|title = Precalculus mathematics|first1 = Vivian Shaw|last1= Groza |first2= Susanne M. |last2=Shelley|publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=978-0-03-077670-0|page = 182|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yM_lSq1eJv8C&pg=PA182}}.</ref><ref>{{citation\n | last = Stifel | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Stifel\n | language = Latin\n | page = 31\n | title = Arithmetica integra\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=fndPsRv08R0C&pg=PA22\n | year = 1544}}. A copy of the same table with two more entries appears on p.&nbsp;237, and another copy extended to negative powers appears on p.&nbsp;249b.</ref>\n\nEarlier than Stifel, the 8th century [[Jain]] mathematician [[Virasena]] is credited with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ''ardhacheda'' has been defined as the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives rise to a function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two,<ref>{{citation|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ymud91nTc9YC&pg=PA352 352]|title=[[The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics]]|first=G. G.|last=Joseph|edition=3rd|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011}}.</ref> but it is different for other integers, giving the [[p-adic order|2-adic order]] rather than the logarithm.<ref>See, e.g., {{citation|title=Cryptographic Applications of Analytic Number Theory: Complexity Lower Bounds and Pseudorandomness|volume=22|series=Progress in Computer Science and Applied Logic|first=Igor|last=Shparlinski|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2013|isbn=978-3-0348-8037-4|page=35|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z635BwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35}}.</ref>\n\nThe modern form of a binary logarithm, applying to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their applications in information theory and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Euler | first = Leonhard | author-link = Leonhard Euler\n | contribution = Chapter VII.

Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates is defined as the binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of {{math|1}}, a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of {{math|−1}}, and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.<ref>{{citation|title=Microarray Gene Expression Data Analysis: A Beginner's Guide|first1=Helen|last1=Causton|first2=John|last2=Quackenbush|first3=Alvis|last3=Brazma|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4443-1156-3|pages=49–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bg6D_7mdG70C&pg=PA49}}.</ref>\n\nData points obtained in this way are often visualized as a [[scatterplot]] in which one or both of the coordinate axes are binary logarithms of intensity ratios, or in visualizations such as the [[MA plot]] and [[RA plot]] that rotate and scale these log ratio scatterplots.<ref>{{citation|title=Computational and Statistical Methods for Protein Quantification by Mass Spectrometry|first1=Ingvar|last1=Eidhammer|first2=Harald|last2=Barsnes|first3=Geir Egil|last3=Eide|first4=Lennart|last4=Martens|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2012|isbn=978-1-118-49378-6|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z3VbhLz6pMC&pg=PA105}}.</ref>\n\n===Music theory===\nIn [[music theory]], the [[Interval (music)|interval]] or perceptual difference between two tones is determined by the ratio of their frequencies.

Such a measure is given by the [[Cent (music)|cent]], which divides the octave into {{math|1200}} equal intervals ({{math|12}} [[semitone]]s of {{math|100}} cents each).

For example, {{math|log<sub>2</sub>{{hsp}}6}} is approximately {{math|2.585}}, which rounds up to {{math|3}}, indicating that a tournament of {{math|6}} teams requires {{math|3}} rounds (either two teams sit out the first round, or one team sits out the second round).

IIA serial No. 355]]\n\nThe '''Bygrave slide rule''' is a [[slide rule]] named for its inventor, Captain Leonard Charles Bygrave of the [[RAF]].  It was used in [[celestial navigation]], primarily in aviation. Officially, it was called the A. M. L. Position Line Slide Rule (A.M.L. for Air Ministry Laboratories).<ref name = vanRiet>{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}</ref>\n\nIt was developed in 1920 at the Air Ministry Laboratories at Kensington in London and was produced by Henry Hughes & Son Ltd of London until the mid-1930s. It solved the so-called celestial triangle accurately to about one minute of arc and quickly enough for aerial navigation.  The solution of the celestial triangle used the [[John Napier]] rules for solution of square-angled spherical triangles.  The slide rule was constructed as two coaxial tubes with spiral scales, like the Fuller slide rules, with yet another tube on the outside carrying the cursors.<ref name = vanRiet>{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, a closely related version was produced in Germany by Dennert & Pape as the HR1, MHR1 and HR2.<ref name = vanRiet>{{cite web|url=http://www.rechenschieber.org/PositionLineSlideRules.pdf|title=Position Line Slide Rules}}</ref>\n\n== Famous users ==\n[[Sir Francis Chichester]] was a renowned aviator and yachtsman. He used a Bygrave Slide Rule as an aid to navigation during flights in the 1930s, one of which was the first solo flight from New Zealand to Australia in a [[Gipsy Moth]] biplane. He later completed a round the world cruise in his yacht [[Gipsy Moth IV]]. This was the first solo circumnavigation using the [[clipper route]].

Historically, it was known as ''logarithmus decimalis''<ref name=\"Euler_1748\"/> or ''logarithmus decadis''.<ref name=\"Scherffer_1772\"/> It is indicated by log<sub>10</sub>(''x''), or sometimes Log(''x'') with a capital ''L'' (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic [[multi-valued function]]). On calculators, it is usually \"log\", but mathematicians usually mean [[natural logarithm]] (logarithm with base e ≈ 2.71828) rather than common logarithm when they write \"log\". To mitigate this ambiguity, the [[ISO 80000-2|ISO 80000 specification]] recommends that log<sub>10</sub>(''x'') should be written lg(''x'') and log<sub>''e''</sub>(''x'') should be ln(''x'').\n\n[[File:APN2002 Table 1, 1000-1500.agr.tiff|thumb|300px|Page from a table of common logarithms. This page shows the logarithms for numbers from 1000 to 1500 to five decimal places. The complete table covers values up to 9999.]]\nBefore the early 1970s, handheld electronic calculators were not available and [[mechanical calculator]]s capable of multiplication were bulky, expensive and not widely available. Instead, [[mathematical table|tables]] of base-10 logarithms were used in science, engineering and navigation when calculations required greater accuracy than could be achieved with a [[slide rule]]. Use of logarithms avoided laborious and error-prone paper-and-pencil multiplications and divisions.<ref name=\"Hall_1909\"/> Because logarithms were so useful, [[mathematical table|table]]s of base-10 logarithms were given in appendices of many textbooks. Mathematical and navigation handbooks included tables of the logarithms of [[trigonometric function]]s as well.<ref name=\"Hedrick_1913\"/> See [[log table]] for the history of such tables.\n\n==Mantissa and characteristic==\nAn important property of base-10 logarithms, which makes them so useful in calculations, is that the logarithm of numbers greater than 1 that differ by a factor of a power of 10 all have the same fractional part. The fractional part is known as the '''mantissa'''.<ref group=\"note\">This use of the word ''mantissa'' stems from an older, non-numerical, meaning: a minor addition or supplement, e.g., to a text. Nowadays, the word ''mantissa'' is generally used to describe the fractional part of a [[floating-point]] number on computers, though the recommended term is [[significand]].</ref> Thus log tables need only show the fractional part. Tables of common logarithms typically listed the mantissa, to four or five decimal places or more, of each number in a range, e.g., 1000 to 9999. Such a range would cover all possible values of the mantissa.\n\nThe integer part, called the '''characteristic''', can be computed by simply counting how many places the decimal point must be moved so that it is just to the right of the first significant digit. For example, the logarithm of 120 is given by the following calculation:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}(120) = \\log_{10}\\left(10^2 \\times 1.2\\right) = 2 + \\log_{10}(1.2) \\approx 2 + 0.07918.</math>\n\nThe last number (0.07918)—the fractional part or the mantissa of the common logarithm of 120—can be found in the table shown. The location of the decimal point in 120 tells us that the integer part of the common logarithm of 120, the characteristic, is&nbsp;2.\n\n===Negative logarithms===\nNumbers greater than 0 and less than 1 have negative logarithms. For example,\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}(0.012) = \\log_{10}\\left(10^{-2} \\times 1.2\\right) = -2 + \\log_{10}(1.2) \\approx -2 + 0.07918 = -1.92082.</math>\n\nTo avoid the need for separate tables to convert positive and negative logarithms back to their original numbers, one can express a negative logarithm as a negative integer characteristic plus a positive mantissa. To facilitate this, a special notation, called ''bar notation,'' is used:\n\n:<math>\\log_{10}(0.012) \\approx -2 + 0.07918 = \\bar{2}.07918.</math>\n\nThe bar over the characteristic indicates that it is negative whilst the mantissa remains positive. When reading a number in bar notation out loud, the symbol <math>\\bar{n}</math> is read as \"bar n\", so that <math>\\bar{2}.07918</math> is read as \"bar 2 point 07918…\".\n\nThe following example uses the bar notation to calculate 0.012 &times; 0.85 = 0.0102:\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rll}\n \\text{As found above,}          &  \\log_{10}(0.012) \\approx\\bar{2}.07918\\\\\n \\text{Since}\\;\\;\\log_{10}(0.85) &= \\log_{10}\\left(10^{-1}\\times 8.5\\right) = -1 + \\log_{10}(8.5) &\\approx -1 + 0.92942 = \\bar{1}.92942\\\\\n \\log_{10}(0.012 \\times 0.85)    &= \\log_{10}(0.012) + \\log_{10}(0.85)                            &\\approx \\bar{2}.07918 + \\bar{1}.92942\\\\\n                                 &= (-2 + 0.07918) + (-1 + 0.92942)                               &= -(2 + 1) + (0.07918 + 0.92942)\\\\\n                                 &= -3 + 1.00860                                                  &= -2 + 0.00860\\;^*\\\\\n                                 &\\approx \\log_{10}\\left(10^{-2}\\right) + \\log_{10}(1.02)         &= \\log_{10}(0.01 \\times 1.02)\\\\\n                                 &= \\log_{10}(0.0102).\n\\end{array}</math>\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> This step makes the mantissa between 0 and 1, so that its [[antilog]] (10{{sup|mantissa}}) can be looked up.\n\nThe following table shows how the same mantissa can be used for a range of numbers differing by powers of ten:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=5px\n|+ Common logarithm, characteristic, and mantissa of powers of 10 times a number\n!

This holds for any positive [[real number]] <math>x</math> because\n:<math>\\log_{10}\\left(x \\times10^i\\right) = \\log_{10}(x) + \\log_{10}\\left(10^i\\right) = \\log_{10}(x) + i.</math>\n\nSince <math>i</math> is always an integer, the mantissa comes from <math>\\log_{10}(x)</math>, which is constant for given <math>x</math>. This allows a [[Log table|table of logarithms]] to include only one entry for each mantissa. In the example of 5&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>''i''</sup>, 0.698&nbsp;970 (004&nbsp;336&nbsp;018&nbsp;…) will be listed once indexed by 5 (or 0.5, or 500, etc.).\n\n[[Image:Slide rule example2.svg|thumb|500px|Numbers are placed on [[slide rule]] scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms.

In 1616 and 1617, Briggs visited [[John Napier]], the inventor of what are now called natural (base-e) logarithms at [[Edinburgh]] in order to suggest a change to Napier's logarithms. During these conferences, the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon; and after his return from his second visit, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nBecause base 10 logarithms were most useful for computations, engineers generally simply wrote \"log(''x'')\" when they meant log<sub>10</sub>(''x''). Mathematicians, on the other hand, wrote \"log(''x'')\" when they meant log<sub>''e''</sub>(''x'') for the natural logarithm. Today, both notations are found. Since hand-held electronic calculators are designed by engineers rather than mathematicians, it became customary that they follow engineers' notation. So the notation, according to which one writes \"ln(''x'')\" when the natural logarithm is intended, may have been further popularized by the very invention that made the use of \"common logarithms\" far less common, electronic calculators.\n\n== Numeric value ==\n[[File:Logarithm keys.jpg|thumb|The logarithm keys (''log'' for base-10 and ''ln'' for base-''e'') on a typical scientific calculator. The advent of hand-held calculators largely eliminated the use of common logarithms as an aid to computation.]]\nThe numerical value for logarithm to the base 10 can be calculated with the following identity.\n\n: <math> \\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)} \\qquad \\text{ or } \\qquad \\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\log_2(x)}{\\log_2(10)}</math>\n\nas procedures exist for determining the numerical value for [[natural logarithm|logarithm base ''e'']] and [[binary logarithm|logarithm base 2]].\n\n* [[Natural logarithm#Numerical value]]\n* [[Binary logarithm#Algorithm|Algorithms for computing binary logarithms]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cologarithm]]\n*[[Decibel]]\n*[[Logarithm#History|History of logarithms]]\n*[[Log table]]\n*[[Mantissa (floating point number)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Euler_1748\">{{cite book |title=Introductio in Analysin Infinitorum (Part 2) |title-link=Introductio in analysin infinitorum |language=Latin |author-first1=Leonhard |author-last1=Euler |author-link1=Leonhard Euler |author-first2=Andreas |author-last2=Speiser |author-link2=Andreas Speiser |author-first3=Louis Gustave |author-last3=du Pasquier |author-first4=Heinrich |author-last4=Brandt |author-link4=Heinrich Brandt |author-first5=Ernst |author-last5=Trost |editor-first=Andreas |editor-last=Speiser |editor-link=Andreas Speiser |work=Opera Omnia, Opera Mathematica |date=1945 |orig-year=1748 |series=1 |volume=9 |publisher=[[B.G.

[[:File:Complex log.jpg|The image file's page]] shows the encoding of colors as a function of their complex values.]]\n\nIn [[complex analysis]], a '''complex logarithm''' of the non-zero complex number {{mvar|z}}, denoted by '''{{math|''w'' {{=}} log ''z''}}''', is defined to be any complex number {{mvar|w}} for which {{math|''e''<sup>&#8239;''w''</sup> {{=}} ''z''}}.<ref name=Sarason>Sarason, Section IV.9.</ref> This construction is analogous to the real [[natural logarithm|logarithm function]] {{math|ln}}, which is the [[inverse function|inverse ]] of the real [[exponential function]] {{math|''e''<sup>&#8239;''y''</sup>}}, satisfying {{math|''e''<sup>&#8239;ln''x''</sup> {{=}} ''x''}} for positive real numbers {{mvar|x}}.\n\nSince any complex number has infinitely many complex logarithms (see next paragraph), the complex logarithm cannot be defined to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] on the complex numbers, but only as a [[multivalued function]]. Settings for a formal treatment of this are, among others, the associated [[Riemann surface]], [[branch point|branches]], or [[partial inverse]]s of the [[Exponential function#Complex plane|complex exponential function]].\n\nIf {{mvar|z}} is given in [[polar form]] as {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''r''⋅''e''<sup>&#8239;''i''⋅''θ''</sup>}} ({{mvar|r}} and {{mvar|θ}} real numbers with {{math|''r'' > 0}}), then {{math|''w''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ln(''r'') + ''i''⋅''θ''}} is one logarithm of {{mvar|''z''}}. Since {{math|''z'' {{=}} ''r''⋅''e''<sup>&#8239;''i''⋅(''θ'' + 2''k''{{pi}})</sup>}} exactly for all integer {{mvar|k}}, adding integer multiples {{nowrap|of {{math|2{{pi}}}}}} to the argument&nbsp;{{mvar|θ}} gives all the numbers that are logarithms of&nbsp;{{mvar|''z''}}:<ref name=Sarason/>\n:{{math|''w''<sub>''k''</sub> {{=}} ln(''r'') + ''i''⋅(''θ'' + 2''k''{{pi}})}}.\n\nAll these complex logarithms of {{mvar|z}} are on a vertical line in the complex plane at the distance {{math|ln(''r'')}} to the origin.\n\nSince every nonzero complex number {{mvar|''z''}} has infinitely many logarithms, care is required to give such a notion an unambiguous meaning. Sometimes the {{nowrap|notation {{math|ln}}}} &ndash;instead of {{math|log}}&ndash; is used when addressing the complex logarithm.\n\n==Problems with inverting the complex exponential function==\n[[File:Riemann surface log.svg|thumb|right|A plot of the multi-valued imaginary part of the complex logarithm function, which shows the branches. As a complex number ''z'' goes around the origin, the imaginary part of the logarithm goes up or down. This makes the origin a [[branch point]] of the function.]]\n\nFor a function to have an [[inverse function|inverse]], it must [[Injective function|map distinct values to distinct values]], that is, it must be [[injective]]. But the complex exponential function is not injective, because {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>''w''+2''πi''</sup> = ''e''<sup>''w''</sup>}} for any ''w'', since adding ''iθ'' to ''w'' has the effect of rotating ''e''<sup>''w''</sup> counterclockwise ''θ'' [[radian]]s. So the points\n:<math>\\ldots,\\;w-4\\pi i, \\;w-2\\pi i, \\;w, \\;w + 2\\pi i, \\;w+4\\pi i, \\;\\ldots,</math>\nequally spaced along a vertical line, are all mapped to the same number by the exponential function.  This means that the exponential function does not have an inverse function in the standard sense.<ref>Conway, p. 39.</ref><ref>Another interpretation of this is that the \"inverse\" of the complex exponential function is a [[multivalued function]] taking each nonzero complex number ''z'' to the ''set'' of all logarithms of ''z''.</ref>  There are two solutions to this problem.\n\nOne is to restrict the domain of the exponential function to a region that ''does not contain any two numbers differing by an integer multiple of 2πi'': this leads naturally to the definition of [[branch cut|branches]] of {{nowrap|log ''z''}}, which are certain functions that single out one logarithm of each number in their domains. This is analogous to the definition of [[arcsin|{{nowrap|arcsin ''x''}}]] on {{nowrap|[−1, 1]}} as the inverse of the restriction of [[sine|{{nowrap|sin ''θ''}}]] to the interval {{nowrap|[−''π''/2, ''π''/2]}}: there are infinitely many real numbers ''θ'' with {{nowrap|1=sin ''θ'' = ''x''}}, but one arbitrarily chooses the one in {{nowrap|[−''π''/2, ''π''/2]}}.\n\nAnother way to resolve the indeterminacy is to view the logarithm as a function whose domain is not a region in the [[complex plane]], but a [[Riemann surface]] that ''[[covering space|covers]]'' the punctured complex plane in an infinite-to-1 way.\n\nBranches have the advantage that they can be evaluated at complex numbers. On the other hand, the function on the Riemann surface is elegant in that it packages together ''all'' branches of the logarithm and does not require an arbitrary choice as part of its definition.\n\n==Definition of principal value==\nFor each nonzero complex number ''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi'', the '''principal value''' Log&nbsp;''z'' is the logarithm whose [[imaginary part]] lies in the interval (−''π'', ''π'']. The expression Log&nbsp;0 is left undefined since there is no complex number ''w'' satisfying ''e''<sup>''w''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nThe principal value can be described also in a few other ways.\n\nTo give a formula for Log&nbsp;''z'', begin by expressing ''z'' in [[polar form]], ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''re''<sup>''iθ''</sup>. Given ''z'', the polar form is not quite unique, because of the possibility of adding an integer multiple of 2''π'' to ''θ'', but it can be ''made'' unique by requiring ''θ'' to lie in the interval (−''π'', ''π'']; this ''θ'' is called the principal value of the argument, and is sometimes written [[Arg (mathematics)|Arg&nbsp;''z'']] or (especially in computer languages) [[atan2|atan2(''y'',''x'')]], which agrees with arctan(''y''/''x'') when ''x'' > 0 but gives a correct value for any (''x'', ''y'') ≠ (0, 0). Then the principal value of the logarithm<ref name=Sarason/> can be defined by\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Log} z = \\ln r + i \\theta = \\ln |z| + i \\operatorname{Arg} z = \\ln\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + i \\operatorname{atan2}(y, x).</math>\n\nFor example, Log(-3''i'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;ln&nbsp;3&nbsp;−&nbsp;''πi''/2.\n\nAnother way to describe Log&nbsp;''z'' is as the inverse of a restriction of the complex exponential function, as in the previous section. The horizontal strip ''S'' consisting of complex numbers ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''+''yi'' such that −''π''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''π'' is an example of a region not containing any two numbers differing by an integer multiple of 2''πi'', so the restriction of the exponential function to ''S'' has an inverse. In fact, the exponential function maps ''S'' [[bijection|bijectively]] to the punctured complex plane <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times = \\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}</math>, and the inverse of this restriction is <math>\\operatorname{Log}\\colon \\mathbb{C}^\\times \\to S</math>. The conformal mapping section below explains the geometric properties of this map in more detail.\n\nWhen the notation log&nbsp;''z'' appears without any particular logarithm having been specified, it is generally best to assume that the principal value is intended. In particular, this gives a value consistent with the real value of ln&nbsp;''z'' when ''z'' is a positive real number. The capitalization in the notation Log is used by some authors<ref name=Sarason/> to distinguish the principal value from other logarithms of ''z''.\n\nNot all identities satisfied by ln extend to complex numbers. It is true that ''e''<sup>Log&nbsp;''z''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''z'' for all ''z''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0 (this is what it means for Log&nbsp;''z'' to be a logarithm of ''z''), but the identity Log&nbsp;''e''<sup>''z''</sup> = ''z'' fails for ''z'' outside the strip ''S''. For this reason, one cannot always apply Log to both sides of an identity ''e''<sup>''z''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e''<sup>''w''</sup> to deduce ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''w''. Also, the identity Log(''z''<sub>1</sub>''z''<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log&nbsp;''z''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;Log&nbsp;''z''<sub>2</sub> can fail: the two sides can differ by an integer multiple of 2''πi'' : for instance,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Log}((-1)i) = \\operatorname{Log}(-i) = \\ln(1) -\\frac{\\pi i}{2} = -\\frac{\\pi i}{2}, </math>\nbut\n:<math>\\operatorname{Log}(-1) + \\operatorname{Log}(i) = \\left( \\ln(1) + \\pi i \\right) + \\left( \\ln(1) + \\frac{\\pi i}{2} \\right) = \\frac{3\\pi i}{2} \\ne -\\frac{\\pi i}{2}.</math>\n\nThe function Log&nbsp;''z'' is [[discontinuous]] at each negative real number, but [[continuous function|continuous]] everywhere else in <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>. To explain the discontinuity, consider what happens to Arg&nbsp;''z'' as ''z'' approaches a negative real number ''a''. If ''z'' approaches ''a'' from above, then Arg&nbsp;''z'' approaches ''π'', which is also the value of Arg&nbsp;''a'' itself. But if ''z'' approaches ''a'' from below, then Arg&nbsp;''z'' approaches −''π''. So Arg&nbsp;''z'' \"jumps\" by 2''π'' as ''z'' crosses the negative real axis, and similarly Log&nbsp;''z'' jumps by 2''πi''.\n\n==Branches of the complex logarithm==\nIs there a different way to choose a logarithm of each nonzero complex number so as to make a function ''L''(''z'') that is continuous on ''all'' of <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>? The answer is no. To see why, imagine tracking such a logarithm function along the [[unit circle]], by evaluating ''L'' at ''e''<sup>''iθ''</sup> as ''θ'' increases from 0 to 2''π''. For simplicity, suppose that the starting value ''L''(1) is 0. Then for ''L''(''z'') to be continuous, ''L''(''e''<sup>''iθ''</sup>) must agree with ''iθ'' as ''θ'' increases (the difference is a continuous function of ''θ'' taking values in the discrete set <math>2\\pi i \\mathbb{Z}</math>). In particular, ''L''(''e''<sup>2''πi''</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''πi'', but ''e''<sup>2''πi''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, so this contradicts ''L''(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nTo obtain a continuous logarithm defined on complex numbers, it is hence necessary to restrict the domain to a smaller subset ''U'' of the complex plane. Because one of the goals is to be able to [[derivative|differentiate]] the function, it is reasonable to assume that the function is defined on a neighborhood of each point of its domain; in other words, ''U'' should be an [[open set]]. Also, it is reasonable to assume that ''U'' is [[Connectedness|connected]], since otherwise the function values on different components of ''U'' could be unrelated to each other. All this motivates the following definition:\n\n::A '''branch''' of log&nbsp;''z'' is a [[continuous function]] ''L''(''z'') defined on a connected [[open set|open subset]] ''U'' of the complex plane such that ''L''(''z'') is a logarithm of ''z'' for each ''z'' in ''U''.<ref name=Sarason />\n\nFor example, the principal value defines a branch on the open set where it is continuous, which is the set <math>\\mathbb{C}-\\mathbb{R}_{\\le 0}</math> obtained by removing 0 and all negative real numbers from the complex plane.\n\nAnother example: The [[Mercator series]]\n:::<math>\n\\ln(1+u)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} u^n\n= u - \\frac{u^2}{2} + \\frac{u^3}{3} - \\cdots \\,\n</math>\n[[Convergent series|converges]] [[uniform convergence|locally uniformly]] for |''u''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;1, so setting ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1+''u'' defines a branch of log&nbsp;''z'' on the open disk of radius 1 centered at 1. (Actually, this is just a restriction of Log&nbsp;''z'', as can be shown by differentiating the difference and comparing values at 1.)\n\nOnce a branch is fixed, it may be denoted \"log&nbsp;''z''\" if no confusion can result. Different branches can give different values for the logarithm of a particular complex number, however, so a branch must be fixed ''in advance'' (or else the principal branch must be understood) in order for \"log&nbsp;''z''\" to have a precise unambiguous meaning.\n\n===Branch cuts===\nThe argument above involving the unit circle generalizes to show that no branch of log&nbsp;''z'' exists on an open set ''U'' containing a [[closed curve]] that [[winding number|winds]] around 0. To foil this argument, ''U'' is typically chosen as the complement of a ray or curve in the complex plane going from 0 (inclusive) to infinity in some direction. In this case, the curve is known as a [[branch cut]]. For example, the principal branch has a branch cut along the negative real axis.\n\nIf the function ''L''(''z'') is extended to be defined at a point of the branch cut, it will necessarily be discontinuous there; at best it will be continuous \"on one side\", like Log&nbsp;''z'' at a negative real number.\n\n===The derivative of the complex logarithm===\nEach branch ''L''(''z'') of log&nbsp;''z'' on an open set ''U'' is an inverse of a restriction of the exponential function, namely the restriction to the image of ''U'' under ''L''. Since the exponential function is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] (that is, complex differentiable) with nonvanishing derivative, the complex analogue of the [[inverse function theorem]] applies. It shows that ''L''(''z'') is holomorphic at each ''z'' in ''U'', and ''L''′(''z'') = 1/''z''.<ref name=Sarason /> Another way to prove this is to check the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations#Other representations|Cauchy–Riemann equations in polar coordinates]].<ref name=Sarason />\n\n===Constructing branches via integration===\nThe function <math>\\ln(x)</math> for <math>x>0</math> can be constructed by the formula\n:<math>\\ln(x)=\\int_1^x \\frac{du}{u}</math>\nIf the range of integration started at a positive number ''a'' other than 1, the formula would have to be\n:<math>\\ln(x)=\\ln(a)+\\int_a^x \\frac{du}{u}</math>\ninstead.\n\nIn developing the analogue for the ''complex'' logarithm, there is an additional complication: the definition of the [[complex integral]] requires a choice of path. Fortunately, if the integrand is holomorphic, then the value of the integral is unchanged by [[homotopy|deforming the path]] (while holding the endpoints fixed), and in a [[simply connected]] region ''U'' (a region with \"no holes\") ''any'' path from ''a'' to ''z'' inside ''U'' can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] inside ''U'' into any other. All this leads to the following:\n\n::If ''U'' is a [[simply connected]] open subset of <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> not containing 0, then a branch of log&nbsp;''z'' defined on ''U'' can be constructed by choosing a starting point ''a'' in ''U'', choosing a logarithm ''b'' of ''a'', and defining\n\n:::<math>L(z) = b+\\int_a^z \\frac{dw}{w}</math>\n\n::for each ''z'' in ''U''.<ref>Lang, p. 121.</ref>\n\n==The complex logarithm as a conformal map==\n[[Image:Logez02.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The circles Re(Log ''z'') = constant and the rays Im(Log&nbsp;''z'') = constant in the complex ''z''-plane.]]\n\nAny holomorphic map <math>f\\colon U \\to \\mathbb{C}</math> satisfying <math>f'(z) \\ne 0</math> for all <math>z \\in U</math> is a [[conformal map]], which means that if two curves passing through a point ''a'' of ''U'' form an angle ''α'' (in the sense that the [[tangent line]]s to the curves at ''a'' form an angle ''α''), then the images of the two curves form the ''same'' angle ''α'' at ''f''(''a'').\nSince a branch of log&nbsp;''z'' is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]], and since its derivative 1/''z'' is never 0, it defines a conformal map.\n\nFor example, the principal branch ''w'' = Log&nbsp;''z'', viewed as a mapping from <math>\\mathbb{C}-\\mathbb{R}_{\\le 0}</math> to the horizontal strip defined by |Im&nbsp;''z''|&nbsp;<&nbsp;''π'', has the following properties, which are direct consequences of the formula in terms of polar form:\n* Circles<ref>Strictly speaking, the point on each circle on the negative real axis should be discarded, or the principal value should be used there.</ref> in the ''z''-plane centered at 0 are mapped to vertical segments in the ''w''-plane connecting ''a''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''πi'' to ''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''πi'', where ''a'' is the real log of the radius of the circle.\n* Rays emanating from 0 in the ''z''-plane are mapped to horizontal lines in the ''w''-plane.\n\nEach circle and ray in the ''z''-plane as above meet at a right angle. Their images under Log are a vertical segment and a horizontal line (respectively) in the ''w''-plane, and these too meet at a right angle. This is an illustration of the conformal property of Log.\n\n==The associated Riemann surface==\n[[Image:Riemann surface log.svg|thumb|right|A visualization of the Riemann surface of log&nbsp;''z''. The surface appears to spiral around a vertical line corresponding to the origin of the complex plane. The actual surface extends arbitrarily far both horizontally and vertically, but is cut off in this image.]]\n\n===Construction===\nThe various branches of log&nbsp;''z'' cannot be glued to give a single function <math>\\log \\colon \\mathbb{C}^\\times \\to \\mathbb{C}</math> because two branches may give different values at a point where both are defined. Compare, for example, the principal branch Log(''z'') on <math>\\mathbb{C}-\\mathbb{R}_{\\le 0}</math> with imaginary part ''θ'' in (−''π'',''π'') and the branch ''L''(''z'') on <math>\\mathbb{C}-\\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}</math> whose imaginary part ''θ'' lies in (0,2''π''). These agree on the [[upper half plane]], but not on the lower half plane. So it makes sense to glue the domains of these branches ''only along the copies of the upper half plane''. The resulting glued domain is connected, but it has two copies of the lower half plane. Those two copies can be visualized as two levels of a parking garage, and one can get from the Log level of the lower half plane up to the ''L'' level of the lower half plane by going 360° counterclockwise around 0, first crossing the positive real axis (of the Log level) into the shared copy of the upper half plane and then crossing the negative real axis (of the ''L'' level) into the ''L'' level of the lower half plane.\n\nOne can continue by gluing branches with imaginary part ''θ'' in (''π'',3''π''), in (2''π'',4''π''), and so on, and in the other direction, branches with imaginary part ''θ'' in (−2''π'',0), in (−3''π'',−''π''), and so on. The final result is a connected surface that can be viewed as a spiralling parking garage with infinitely many levels extending both upward and downward. This is the [[Riemann surface]] ''R'' associated to log&nbsp;''z''.\n\nA point on ''R'' can be thought of as a pair (''z'',''θ'') where ''θ'' is a possible value of the argument of ''z''. In this way, ''R'' can be embedded in <math>\\mathbb{C} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\approx \\mathbb{R}^3</math>.\n\n===The logarithm function on the Riemann surface===\nBecause the domains of the branches were glued only along open sets where their values agreed, the branches glue to give a single well-defined function <math>\\log_R \\colon R \\to \\mathbb{C}</math>.<ref>The notations ''R'' and log<sub>''R''</sub> are not universally used.</ref> It maps each point (''z'',''θ'') on ''R'' to ln&nbsp;|''z''|&nbsp;+&nbsp;''iθ''. This process of extending the original branch Log by gluing compatible [[holomorphic function]]s is known as [[analytic continuation]].\n\nThere is a \"projection map\" from ''R'' down to <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math> that \"flattens\" the spiral, sending (''z'',''θ'') to ''z''. For any <math>z \\in \\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>, if one takes all the points (''z'',''θ'') of ''R'' lying \"directly above\" ''z'' and evaluates log<sub>''R''</sub> at all these points, one gets all the logarithms of ''z''.\n\n===Gluing all branches of log&nbsp;''z''===\nInstead of gluing only the branches chosen above, one can start with ''all'' branches of log&nbsp;''z'', and simultaneously glue ''every'' pair of branches <math>L_1\\colon U_1 \\to \\mathbb{C}</math> and <math>L_2\\colon U_2 \\to \\mathbb{C}</math> along the largest open subset of <math>U_1 \\cap U_2</math> on which ''L''<sub>1</sub> and ''L''<sub>2</sub> agree. This yields the same Riemann surface ''R'' and function log<sub>''R''</sub> as before. This approach, although slightly harder to visualize, is more natural in that it does not require selecting any particular branches.\n\nIf ''U''′ is an open subset of ''R'' projecting bijectively to its image ''U'' in <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>, then the restriction of log<sub>''R''</sub> to ''U''′ corresponds to a branch of log&nbsp;''z'' defined on ''U''. Every branch of log&nbsp;''z'' arises in this way.\n\n===The Riemann surface as a universal cover===\nThe projection map <math>R \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times</math> realizes ''R'' as a [[covering space]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>. In fact, it is a [[Galois covering]] with [[deck transformation]] group isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>, generated by the [[homeomorphism]] sending (''z'',''θ'') to (''z'',''θ''+2''π'').\n\nAs a [[complex manifold]], ''R'' is [[biholomorphic]] with <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> via log<sub>''R''</sub>. (The inverse map sends ''z'' to (''e''<sup>''z''</sup>,Im&nbsp;''z'').) This shows that ''R'' is [[simply connected]], so ''R'' is the [[universal cover]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^\\times</math>.\n\n==Applications==\n* The complex logarithm is needed to define [[exponentiation#Powers of complex numbers|exponentiation]] in which the base is a complex number. Namely, if ''a'' and ''b'' are complex numbers with ''a'' ≠ 0, one can use the principal value to define ''a''<sup>''b''</sup> = ''e''<sup>''b''&nbsp;Log&nbsp;''a''</sup>. One can also replace Log&nbsp;''a'' by other logarithms of ''a'' to obtain other values of ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Kreyszig\n | first = Erwin\n | author-link = Erwin Kreyszig\n | title = Advanced Engineering Mathematics\n | publisher = [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]\n | edition = 10th (posthumous)\n | location = Berlin\n | date = August 16, 2011\n | page = 640\n | isbn = 9780470458365 }}</ref>\n* Since the mapping ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;Log&nbsp;''z'' transforms circles centered at 0 into vertical straight line segments, it is useful in engineering applications involving an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Logarithms to other bases===\nJust as for real numbers, one can define for complex numbers ''b'' and ''x''\n:<math>\\log_b(x)=\\frac{\\log x}{\\log b}\\ ,</math>\nthe only caveat being that its value depends on the choice of a branch of log defined at ''b'' and ''x'' (with log&nbsp;''b'' ≠ 0).

      "text": "{{more footnotes|date=October 2017}}\nIn the [[mathematics]] of the [[real number]]s, the [[logarithm]] log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' is a number ''x'' such that {{nowrap|1=''b''<sup>''x''</sup> = ''a''}}, for given numbers ''a'' and ''b''. Analogously, in any [[Group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'', powers ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> can be defined for all [[integer]]s ''k'', and the '''discrete logarithm''' log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' is an integer ''k'' such that {{nowrap|1=''b''<sup>''k''</sup> = ''a''}}. In [[number theory]], the more commonly used term is '''index''': we can write ''x'' = ind<sub>''r''</sub> ''a'' (mod&nbsp;''m'') (read the index of ''a'' to the base ''r'' modulo&nbsp;''m'') for ''r''<sup>''x''</sup> ≡ ''a'' (mod&nbsp;''m'') if ''r'' is a [[Primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] of ''m'' and [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]](''a'',''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nDiscrete logarithms are quickly computable in a few special cases. However, no efficient method is known for computing them in general. Several important algorithms in [[public-key cryptography]] base their security on the assumption that the discrete logarithm problem over carefully chosen groups has no efficient solution.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nLet ''G'' be any group. Denote its [[group operation]] by multiplication and its identity element by 1. Let ''b'' be any element of ''G''. For any positive integer ''k'', the expression ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the product of ''b'' with itself ''k'' times:\n:<math>b^k = \\underbrace{b \\cdot b \\cdots b}_{k \\; \\text{factors}}.</math>\nSimilarly, let ''b''<sup>''-k''</sup> denote the product of ''b''<sup>−1</sup> with itself ''k'' times. For ''k'' = 0, the ''k''th power is the identity: {{nowrap|1=''b''<sup>0</sup> = 1}}.\n\nLet ''a'' also be an element of ''G''. An integer ''k'' that solves the equation {{nowrap|1=''b''<sup>''k''</sup> = ''a''}} is termed a '''discrete logarithm''' (or simply '''logarithm''', in this context) of ''a'' to the base ''b''. One writes ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;log<sub>''b''</sub>&nbsp;''a''.\n\n==Examples==\n=== Powers of 10 ===\n\nThe powers of 10 form an infinite subset ''G'' = {…, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000, …} of the [[rational number]]s. This set ''G'' is a [[cyclic group]] under multiplication, and 10 is a generator. For any element ''a'' of the group, one can compute log<sub>10</sub> ''a''. For example, log<sub>10</sub> 10000 = 4, and log<sub>10</sub> 0.001 = −3. These are instances of the discrete logarithm problem.\n\nOther base-10 logarithms in the real numbers are not instances of the discrete logarithm problem, because they involve non-integer exponents. For example, the equation log<sub>10</sub> 53 = 1.724276… means that 10<sup>1.724276…</sup> = 53. While integer exponents can be defined in any group using products and inverses, arbitrary real exponents in the real numbers require other concepts such as the [[exponential function]].\n\n=== Powers of a fixed real number ===\n\nA similar example holds for any non-zero real number ''b''. The powers form a multiplicative subgroup ''G'' = {…, ''b''<sup>−3</sup>, ''b''<sup>−2</sup>, ''b''<sup>−1</sup>, 1, ''b''<sup>1</sup>, ''b''<sup>2</sup>, ''b''<sup>3</sup>, …} of the non-zero real numbers. For any element ''a'' of ''G'', one can compute log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a''.\n\n=== Modular arithmetic ===\n\nOne of the simplest settings for discrete logarithms is the group [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>)<sup>×</sup>]]. This is the group of multiplication [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] the [[prime number|prime]] ''p''. Its elements are  [[congruence class]]es modulo ''p'', and the group product of two elements may be obtained by ordinary integer multiplication of the elements followed by reduction modulo&nbsp;''p''.\n\nThe ''k''th [[exponentiation|power]] of one of the numbers in this group may be computed by finding its ''k''th power as an integer and then finding the remainder after division by ''p''. When the numbers involved are large, it is more efficient to reduce modulo ''p'' multiple times during the computation. Regardless of the specific algorithm used, this operation is called [[modular exponentiation]]. For example, consider ('''Z'''<sub>17</sub>)<sup>×</sup>. To compute 3<sup>4</sup> in this group, compute 3<sup>4</sup> = 81, and then divide 81 by 17, obtaining a remainder of 13. Thus 3<sup>4</sup> = 13 in the group ('''Z'''<sub>17</sub>)<sup>×</sup>.\n\nThe discrete logarithm is just the inverse operation. For example, consider the equation 3<sup>''k''</sup> ≡ 13 (mod 17) for ''k''. From the example above, one solution is ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, but it is not the only solution. Since 3<sup>16</sup> ≡ 1 (mod 17)—as follows from [[Fermat's little theorem]]—it also follows that if ''n'' is an integer then 3<sup>4+16''n''</sup> ≡ 3<sup>4</sup> × (3<sup>16</sup>)<sup>''n''</sup> ≡ 13 × 1<sup>''n''</sup> ≡ 13 (mod 17). Hence the equation has infinitely many solutions of the form 4 + 16''n''. Moreover, because 16 is the smallest positive integer ''m'' satisfying 3<sup>''m''</sup> ≡ 1 (mod 17), these are the only solutions. Equivalently, the set of all possible solutions can be expressed by the constraint that ''k'' ≡ 4 (mod 16).\n\n=== Powers of the identity ===\n\nIn the special case where ''b'' is the identity element 1 of the group ''G'', the discrete logarithm log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' is undefined for ''a'' other than 1, and every integer ''k'' is a discrete logarithm for ''a'' = 1.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nPowers obey the usual algebraic identity ''b''<sup>''k'' + ''l''</sup> = ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> ''b''<sup>''l''</sup>. In other words, the function\n:<math>f : \\mathbf{Z} \\rightarrow G</math>\ndefined by ''f''(''k'') = ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> is a [[group homomorphism]] from the integers '''Z''' under addition [[Surjection|onto]] the [[subgroup]] ''H'' of ''G'' [[generating set of a group|generated]] by ''b''. For all ''a'' in ''H'', log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' exists. Conversely, log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' does not exist for ''a'' that are not in ''H''.\n\nIf ''H'' is infinite, then log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' is also unique, and the discrete logarithm amounts to a [[group isomorphism]]\n\n:<math>\\log_b \\colon H \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Z}.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, if ''H'' is finite of size ''n'', then log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' is unique only up to congruence modulo ''n'', and the discrete logarithm amounts to a group isomorphism\n:<math>\\log_b\\colon H \\rightarrow \\mathbf{Z}_n,</math>\nwhere '''Z'''<sub>''n''</sub> denotes the additive group of integers modulo ''n''.\n\nThe familiar base change formula for ordinary logarithms remains valid: If ''c'' is another generator of ''H'', then\n\n:<math>\\log_c a = \\log_c b \\cdot \\log_b a.</math>\n\n== Algorithms ==\n{{See also|Discrete logarithm records}}\n{{unsolved|computer science|Can the discrete logarithm be computed in polynomial time on a classical computer?}}\nThe discrete logarithm problem is considered to be computationally intractable. That is, no efficient classical algorithm is known for computing discrete logarithms in general.\n\nA general algorithm for computing log<sub>''b''</sub> ''a'' in finite groups ''G'' is to raise ''b'' to larger and larger powers ''k'' until the desired ''a'' is found. This algorithm is sometimes called ''trial multiplication''. It requires [[running time]] linear in the size of the group ''G'' and thus exponential in the number of digits in the size of the group. Therefore, it is an [[exponential time|exponential-time]] algorithm, practical only for small groups ''G''.\n\nMore sophisticated algorithms exist, usually inspired by similar algorithms for integer factorization. These algorithms run faster than the naïve algorithm, some of them linear in the square root of the size of the group, and thus exponential in half the number of digits in the size of the group. However none of them run in [[polynomial time]] (in the number of digits in the size of the group).\n\n* [[Baby-step giant-step]]\n* [[Function field sieve]]\n* [[Index calculus algorithm]]\n* [[Number field sieve]]\n* [[Pohlig–Hellman algorithm]]\n* [[Pollard's rho algorithm for logarithms]]\n* [[Pollard's kangaroo algorithm]] (aka Pollard's lambda algorithm)\n\nThere is an efficient [[Shor's algorithm|quantum algorithm]] due to [[Peter Shor]].<ref>{{cite journal |arxiv=quant-ph/9508027 |title=Polynomial-Time Algorithms for Prime Factorization and Discrete Logarithms on a Quantum Computer |first=Peter |last=Shor |journal=SIAM Journal on Computing |volume=26 |issue=5 |year=1997 |pages=1484–1509 |doi=10.1137/s0097539795293172 | mr=1471990}}</ref>\n\nEfficient classical algorithms also exist in certain special cases. For example, in the group of the integers modulo ''p'' under addition, the power ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> becomes a product ''bk'', and equality means congruence modulo ''p'' in the integers. The [[extended Euclidean algorithm]] finds ''k'' quickly.\n\n== Comparison with integer factorization ==\n\nWhile computing discrete logarithms and [[integer factorization|factoring integers]] are distinct problems, they share some properties:\n*both are special cases of the [[hidden subgroup problem]] for finite [[Abelian group]]s,\n*both problems seem to be difficult (no efficient [[algorithm]]s are known for non-[[quantum computer]]s),\n*for both problems efficient algorithms on quantum computers are known,\n*algorithms from one problem are often adapted to the other, and\n*the difficulty of both problems has been used to construct various [[cryptography|cryptographic]] systems.\n\n== Cryptography ==\nThere exist groups for which computing discrete logarithms is apparently difficult.  In some cases (e.g. large prime order subgroups of  groups ('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>)<sup>×</sup>) there is not only no efficient algorithm known for the worst case, but the [[average-case complexity]] can be shown to be about as hard as the worst case using [[random self-reducibility]].\n\nAt the same time, the inverse problem of discrete exponentiation is not difficult (it can be computed efficiently using [[exponentiation by squaring]], for example).  This asymmetry is analogous to the one between integer factorization and integer [[multiplication]]. Both asymmetries (and other possibly [[one-way functions]]) have been exploited in the construction of cryptographic systems.\n\nPopular choices for the group ''G'' in discrete logarithm [[cryptography]] (DLC) are the cyclic groups ('''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>)<sup>×</sup> (e.g. [[ElGamal encryption]], [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange]], and the [[Digital Signature Algorithm]]) and cyclic subgroups of [[elliptic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s (''see'' [[Elliptic curve cryptography]]).\n\nWhile there is no publicly known algorithm for solving the discrete logarithm problem in general, the first three steps of the [[number field sieve]] algorithm only depend on the group ''G'', not on the specific elements of ''G'' whose finite log is desired. By [[precomputing]] these three steps for a specific group, one need only carry out the last step, which is much less computationally expensive than the first three, to obtain a specific logarithm in that group.<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nIt turns out that much Internet traffic uses one of a handful of groups that are of order 1024 bits or less, e.g. cyclic groups with order of the Oakley primes specified in RFC 2409. The [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack used this vulnerability to compromise a variety of Internet services that allowed the use of groups whose order was a 512-bit prime number, so called [[export of cryptography|export grade]].<ref name=imperfectfs/>\n\nThe authors of the [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] attack estimate that the much more difficult precomputation needed to solve the discrete log problem for a 1024-bit prime would be within the budget of a large national [[intelligence agency]] such as the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). The Logjam authors speculate that precomputation against widely reused 1024 DH primes is behind claims in [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|leaked NSA documents]] that NSA is able to break much of current cryptography.<ref name=imperfectfs>{{cite web |last1=Adrian |first1=David |last2=Bhargavan |first2=Karthikeyan |last3=Durumeric |first3=Zakir |last4=Gaudry |first4=Pierrick |last5=Green |first5=Matthew |last6=Halderman |first6=J.

The [[Napierian logarithm]]s were published first in 1614. [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] introduced [[common logarithm|common (base 10) logarithms]], which were easier to use. [[mathematical table|Tables]] of logarithms were published in many forms over four centuries. The idea of logarithms was also used to construct the [[slide rule]], which became ubiquitous in science and engineering until the 1970s. A breakthrough generating the [[natural logarithm]] was the result of a search for an expression of [[area]] against a [[hyperbola|rectangular hyperbola]], and required the assimilation of a new [[function (mathematics)|function]] into standard mathematics.\n\n==Common logarithm==\n{{main|Common logarithm}}\n[[Image:Briggs - Canon logarithmorum pro numeris serie naturali crescentibus ab 1. ad 20000., s.d. - 72507.jpg|thumb|''Canon logarithmorum'']]\nAs the common log of ten is one, of a hundred is two, and a thousand is three, the concept of common logarithms is very close to the decimal-positional number system. The common log is said to have [[base (exponentiation)|base]] 10, but base 10,000 is ancient and still common in [[myriad#East Asia|East Asia]]. In his book [[The Sand Reckoner]], [[Archimedes]] used the [[myriad]] as the base of a number system designed to count the grains of sand in the universe. As was noted in 2000:<ref>Ian Bruce (2000) \"Napier’s Logarithms\", [[American Journal of Physics]] 68(2):148</ref>\n:In antiquity Archimedes gave a recipe for reducing multiplication to addition by making use of [[geometric progression]] of numbers and relating them to an [[arithmetic progression]].\nIn 1616 [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier at [[Edinburgh]] in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier's logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon, and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first [[chiliad]] of his logarithms.\n\nIn 1624 Briggs published his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).\nThis table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3621843 | last1 = Bruce | first1 = I. | year = 2002 | title = The Agony and the Ecstasy: The Development of Logarithms by Henry Briggs | journal = The Mathematical Gazette | volume = 86 | issue = 506 | pages = 216–227 | publisher =  | jstor = 3621843 | format =  }}</ref><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jacques-laporte.org/The%20method%20of%20Henry%20briggs.htm|title=The Difference Method of Henry Briggs|accessdate=2012-04-24}}</ref>\nHe also completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent|tangents]] for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\n==Natural logarithm==\n{{main|Natural logarithm}}\n[[Image:Saint-Vincent - Opus geometricum posthumum ad mesolabium per rationum proportionalium novas proprietates, 1668 - 877986.jpg|thumb|''Opus geometricum posthumum'', 1668]]\nIn 1649, [[Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa]], a former student of [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]],<ref>In 1647, Gregoire de Saint-Vincent published his book, ''Opus geometricum quadraturae circuli et sectionum coni'' (Geometric work of squaring the circle and conic sections), vol. 2 (Antwerp, (Belgium):  Johannes and Jakob Meursius, 1647).

However, the quarter-square method could not be used for division without an additional table of reciprocals (or the knowledge of a sufficiently simple [[Multiplicative inverse#Algorithms|algorithm to generate reciprocals]]).

We know that Bürgi had some way of simplifying calculations around 1588, but most likely this way was the use of prosthaphaeresis, and not the use of his table of progressions which probably goes back to about 1600. Indeed Wittich, who was in Kassel from 1584 to 1586, brought with him knowledge of [[prosthaphaeresis]], a method by which [[multiplication]]s and [[division (mathematics)|division]]s can be replaced by [[addition]]s and [[subtraction]]s of trigonometrical values...

Columns of differences are included to aid [[interpolation]].]]\n[[Mathematical table]]s containing [[common logarithm]]s (base-10) were extensively used in computations prior to the advent of [[computer]]s and [[calculator]]s, not only because logarithms convert problems of multiplication and division into much easier addition and subtraction problems, but for an additional property that is unique to base-10 and proves useful: Any positive number can be expressed as the product of a number from the interval {{closed-open|1,10}} and an integer power of {{math|10.}} This can be envisioned as shifting the decimal separator of the given number to the left yielding a positive, and to the right yielding a negative exponent of {{math|10.}} Only the logarithms of these ''normalized'' numbers (approximated by a certain number of digits), which are called  [[significand|mantissas]], need to be tabulated in lists to a similar precision (a similar number of digits). These mantissas are all positive and enclosed in the interval {{closed-open|0,1}}. The common logarithm of any given positive number is then obtained by adding its mantissa to the common logarithm of the second factor. This logarithm is called the ''characteristic'' of the given number. Since the common logarithm of a power of {{math|10}} is exactly the exponent, the characteristic is an integer number, which makes the common logarithm exceptionally useful in dealing with decimal numbers. For numbers less than {{math|1,}} the characteristic makes the resulting logarithm negative, as required.<ref>E. R.

The  English mathematician [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] visited Napier in 1615, and proposed a re-scaling of [[Napier's logarithm]]s to form what is now known as the [[common logarithm|common]] or base-10 logarithms. Napier delegated to Briggs the computation of a revised table, and they later published, in 1617, ''Logarithmorum Chilias Prima'' (\"The First Thousand Logarithms\"), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a table for the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.\n\nIn 1624 his ''Arithmetica Logarithmica'', appeared in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty-thousand [[natural number]]s to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000). This table was later extended by [[Adriaan Vlacq]], but to 10 places, and by [[Alexander John Thompson]] to 20 places in 1952.\n\nBriggs was one of the first to use [[finite-difference method]]s to compute tables of functions.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"jacques-laporte.org\"/>\n\nVlacq's table was later found to contain 603 errors, but \"this cannot be regarded as a great number, when it is considered that the table was the result of an original calculation, and that more than 2,100,000 printed figures are liable to error.\"<ref>''Athenaeum,'' 15 June 1872.  See also the ''[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]'' for May 1872.</ref>  An edition of Vlacq's work, containing many corrections, was issued at [[Leipzig]] in 1794 under the title ''Thesaurus Logarithmorum Completus'' by [[Jurij Vega]].\n\n[[François Callet]]'s seven-place table ([[Paris]], 1795), instead of stopping at 100,000, gave the eight-place logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and 108,000, in order to diminish the errors of [[interpolation]], which were greatest in the early part of the table, and this addition was generally included in seven-place tables. The only important published extension of Vlacq's table was made by Mr. Sang in 1871, whose table contained the seven-place logarithms of all numbers below 200,000.\n\nBriggs and Vlacq also published original tables of the logarithms of the [[trigonometric function]]s. Briggs completed a table of [[logarithmic sine]]s and [[logarithmic tangent]]s for the hundredth part of every [[degree (angle)|degree]] to fourteen decimal places, with a table of [[sine|natural sines]] to fifteen places and the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangents]] and [[secant (trigonometric function)|secants]] for the same to ten places, all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of ''Trigonometria Britannica''. Tables logarithms of trigonometric functions simplify hand calculations where a function of an angle must be multiplied by another number, as is often the case.\n\nBesides the tables mentioned above, a great collection, called ''Tables du Cadastre,'' was constructed under the direction of [[Gaspard de Prony]], by an original computation, under the auspices of the [[France|French]] republican government of the 1790s.  This work, which contained the logarithms of all numbers up to 100,000 to nineteen places, and of the numbers between 100,000 and 200,000 to twenty-four places, exists only in manuscript, \"in seventeen enormous folios,\" at the Observatory of Paris.  It was begun in 1792, and \"the whole of the calculations, which to secure greater accuracy were performed in duplicate, and the two manuscripts subsequently collated with care, were completed in the short space of two years.\"  <ref name=\"Pronybio\">''English Cyclopaedia, Biography,'' Vol. IV., article \"Prony.\"</ref> [[Cubic function|Cubic]] [[interpolation]] could be used to find the logarithm of any number to a similar accuracy.\n\nFor different needs, logarithm tables ranging from small handbooks to multi-volume editions have been compiled:<ref>{{citation|title=Orbital Motion|first=A.

[[Edmund Gunter]] of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale; with additional measuring tools it could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by [[Edmund Wingate]] (c.1593–1656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled ''L'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique & geometrie''. The book contains a double scale, logarithmic on one side, tabular on the other. In 1630, [[William Oughtred]] of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 combined two handheld [[Gunter's scale|Gunter rule]]s to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, [[Isaac Newton]], Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students.  Also like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student [[Richard Delamain]] and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\n\nIn 1677, [[Henry Coggeshall]] created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the [[Coggeshall slide rule]], expanding the slide rule's use beyond mathematical inquiry.\n\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\n\nIn 1815, [[Peter Mark Roget]] invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\n\nIn 1821, [[Nathaniel Bowditch]], described in the ''[[American Practical Navigator]]'' a \"sliding rule\" that contained scales trigonometric functions on the fixed part and a line of log-sines and log-tans on the slider used to solve navigation problems.\n\nIn 1845, Paul Cameron of Glasgow introduced a Nautical Slide-Rule capable of answering navigation questions, including [[right ascension]] and [[declination]] of the sun and principal stars.<ref>\"Cameron's Nautical Slide Rule\", The Practical Mechanic and Engineer's Magazine, April 1845, p187 and Plate XX-B</ref>\n\n===Modern form===\n[[File:Slideruleinuse.wpafb.chap2-2.jpg|thumb|Engineer using a slide rule, with [[mechanical calculator]] in background, mid 20th century]]\nA more modern form of slide rule was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant [[Amédée Mannheim]], \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around this time that [[engineering]] became a recognized profession, resulting in widespread slide rule use in Europe–but not in the United States.  There Edwin Thacher's cylindrical rule took hold after 1881. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by [[Keuffel and Esser Co.]] of New York.<ref name=\"fn_3\">{{cite book|url=http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K&EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |title=The Log-Log Duplex Decitrig Slide Rule No. 4081: A Manual |publisher=Keuffel & Esser |first1=Lyman M. |last1=Kells |first2=Willis F. |last2=Kern |first3=James R. |last3=Bland |year=1943 |page=92 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214020502/http://www.mccoys-kecatalogs.com/K%26EManuals/4081-3_1943/4081-3_1943.htm |archivedate=14 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"fn_4\">''The Polyphase Duplex Slide Rule, A Self-Teaching Manual'', Breckenridge, 1922, p. 20.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Original sources===\n* [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] (1624) ''Arithmetica Logarithmica''\n* [[Grégoire de Saint-Vincent]] (1647) ''Opus Geometricum Quadraturae Circuli et Sectionum Coni''\n* [[Christiaan Huygens]] (1651) [https://archive.org/stream/uvrescompltespu00haargoog#page/n319/mode/2up Theoremata de quadratura hyperboles, ellipsis et circuli], in ''Oeuvres Complètes'', Tome XI, link from [[Internet Archive]].\n* Patavii (1667) ''Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura''\n* [[William Brouncker (mathematician)|William Brouncker]] (1667) [http://www.biodiversityheritagelibrary.org/item/75194#page/267/mode/1up The Squaring of the Hyperbola], [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]], abridged edition 1809, v. i, pp 233–6, link form [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]].\n* [[James Gregory (mathematician)|James Gregory]] (1668) ''Exercitationes Geometricae'', [http://math.knox.edu/aleahy/gregory/WORKING/gpu.html Geometria pars vniversalis'' (Universal part of geometry)], link from Andrew Leahy translation at [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox College]]. \n* [[Nicholas Mercator]] (1668) ''Logarithmitechnia'', London\n\n===Secondary sources===\n* Frances Maseres (1791) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=FZciAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover Scriptores Logarithmici, or a collection of several curious tracts on the nature and construction of logarithms], link from [[Google Books]].\n* Karl Bopp (1907) \"Die Kegelschnitte der Gregorius a St. Vincentio\", ''Abhandlungen zum Geschichte der mathematische Wissenschaft'', XX Heft. \n* [[Florian Cajori]] (1913) \"History of the exponential and logarithm concepts\", [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 20: 5, 35, 75, 107, 148, 173, 205.\n* George A.

The other cases are given by [[Cavalieri's quadrature formula]]. Whereas quadrature of the parabola had been accomplished by [[Archimedes]] in the third century BC (in ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''), the hyperbolic quadrature required the invention in 1647 of a new function: [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent]] addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a hyperbola. His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the '''hyperbolic logarithm''' since it is obtained by integrating, or finding the area, under the hyperbola.\n\nBefore 1748 and the publication of [[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]], the natural logarithm was known in terms of the area of a hyperbolic sector. [[Leonhard Euler]] changed that when he introduced [[transcendental function]]s such as 10<sup>''x''</sup>. Euler identified [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] as the value of ''b'' producing a unit of area (under the hyperbola or in a hyperbolic sector in standard position).

The simplest formal definition is the result of this [[recurrence relation]]:\n\n:<math>\n  \\log^* n :=\n  \\begin{cases}\n    0                  & \\mbox{if } n \\le 1; \\\\\n    1 + \\log^*(\\log n) & \\mbox{if } n > 1\n   \\end{cases}\n </math>\n\nOn the [[positive real numbers]], the continuous [[super-logarithm]] (inverse [[tetration]]) is essentially equivalent:\n:<math>\\log^* n = \\lceil \\mathrm {slog}_e(n) \\rceil</math>\nbut on the negative real numbers, log-star is <math>0</math>, whereas <math>\\lceil \\text{slog}_e(-x)\\rceil = -1</math> for positive <math>x</math>, so the two functions differ for negative arguments.\n\n[[Image:Iterated logarithm.png|right|300px|thumb|'''Figure 1.'''

Graphically, it can be understood as the number of \"zig-zags\" needed in '''Figure 1''' to reach the interval <math>[0, 1]</math> on the ''x''-axis.\n\nIn computer science, '''{{lg-star}}''' is often used to indicate the '''binary iterated logarithm''', which iterates the [[binary logarithm]] (with base <math>2</math>) instead of the natural logarithm (with base ''e''). \n\nMathematically, the iterated logarithm is well-defined for any base greater than <math>1</math>, not only for base <math>2</math> and base ''e''.\n\n==Analysis of algorithms==\nThe iterated logarithm is useful in [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], appearing in the time and space complexity bounds of some algorithms such as:\n\n* Finding the [[Delaunay triangulation]] of a set of points knowing the [[Euclidean minimum spanning tree]]: randomized [[Big-O notation|O]](''n''&nbsp;{{log-star}}&nbsp;''n'') time<ref>Olivier Devillers, \"Randomization yields simple O(n log* n) algorithms for difficult ω(n) problems.\".

The product was named Otis King's Patent Calculator, and was manufactured and sold by Carbic Ltd. in London from about 1922 to about 1972.\n\nWith a [[logarithmic scale|log-scale]] decade length of 66&nbsp;inches, the Otis King calculator should be about a full digit more accurate than a 6-inch pocket slide rule.  But due to inaccuracies in tic-mark placement, some portions of its scales will read off by more than they should.  For example, a reading of 4.630 might represent an answer of 4.632, or almost one part in 2000 error, when it should be accurate to one part in 6000 (66\"/6000 = 0.011\" estimated interpolation accuracy).[http://www.svpal.org/~dickel/OK/OKflat423.html]\n\nThe [[Geniac]] brand cylindrical slide rule sold by Oliver Garfield Company in New York was initially a relabelled Otis King; Garfield later made his own, probably unauthorized version of the Otis King (around 1959). The UK patents covering the mechanical device(s) would have expired in about 1941&ndash;1942 (i.e. 20 years after filing of the patent) but copyright in the drawings would typically only expire 70 years after the author's death.\n\n== Patents ==\n* UK patent GB 207,762 (1922) [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&NR=207762A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19231204&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* UK patent GB 183,723 (1921) [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&NR=183723A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19220803&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* UK patent GB 207,856 (1922) [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=GB&NR=207856A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19231204&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* US patent US 1,645,009 (1923) [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=US&NR=1645009A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19271011&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* Canadian patent CA 241986 [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CA&NR=241986A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19240805&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* Canadian patent CA 241076 [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=CA&NR=241076A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19240624&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* French patent FR569985 [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=FR&NR=569985A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19240422&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* French patent FR576616 [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=FR&NR=576616A&KC=A&FT=D&date=19240823&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n* German patent DE 418814 [http://v3.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC=DE&NR=418814C&KC=C&FT=D&date=19250915&DB=EPODOC&locale=en_EP]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bygrave slide rule]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.svpal.org/~dickel/OK/OtisKing.html Dick Lyon's Otis King pages]\n*[http://www.hpmuseum.org/srcyl.htm Cylindrical rules at Museum of HP Calculators]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:King, Otis}}\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1944 deaths]]\n[[Category:English inventors]]\n[[Category:Mechanical calculators]]\n[[Category:Logarithms]]\n[[Category:English inventions]]\n[[Category:Analog computers]]"

For example, two numbers can be multiplied just by using a logarithm table and adding. The first three operations below assume {{math|1=''x'' = ''b''<sup>''c''</sup>}}, and/or {{math|1=''y'' = ''b''<sup>''d''</sup>}} so that {{math|1=log<sub>''b''</sub>(''x'') = ''c''}} and {{math|1=log<sub>''b''</sub>(''y'') = ''d''}}.

Note that {{math|1=log<sub>''b''</sub>(''a'') + log<sub>''b''</sub>(''c'') = log<sub>''b''</sub>(''ac'')}}, where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are arbitrary constants. Suppose that one wants to approximate the 44th [[Mersenne prime]], {{math|2<sup>32,582,657</sup> &minus;1}}. To get the base-10 logarithm, we would multiply 32,582,657 by {{math|log<sub>10</sub>(2)}}, getting {{math|1=9,808,357.09543 = 9,808,357 + 0.09543}}. We can then get {{math|1=10<sup>9,808,357</sup> &times; 10<sup>0.09543</sup> ≈ 1.25 &times; 10<sup>9,808,357</sup>}}.\n\nSimilarly, factorials can be approximated by summing the logarithms of the terms.\n\n== Complex logarithm identities ==\n\nThe [[complex logarithm]] is the [[complex number]] analogue of the logarithm function. No single valued function on the complex plane can satisfy the normal rules for logarithms. However a [[multivalued function]] can be defined which satisfies most of the identities. It is usual to consider this as a function defined on a [[Riemann surface]].

      "text": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{Short description|Mathematical operation on invertible matrices}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''logarithm of a matrix''' is another [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] such that the [[matrix exponential]] of the latter matrix equals the original matrix. It is thus a generalization of the scalar [[logarithm]] and in some sense an [[inverse function]] of the [[matrix exponential]]. Not all matrices have a logarithm and those matrices that do have a logarithm may have more than one logarithm. The study of logarithms of matrices leads to [[Lie theory]] since when a matrix has a logarithm then it is in a [[Lie group]] and the logarithm is the corresponding element of the vector space of the [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe exponential of a matrix ''A''  is defined by\n:<math>e^{A} \\equiv \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A^{n}}{n!}</math>.\nGiven a matrix ''B'', another matrix ''A'' is said to be a '''matrix logarithm''' of {{math|''B'' if ''e''<sup>''A''</sup> {{=}} ''B''}}. Because the exponential function is not one-to-one for complex numbers (e.g. <math>e^{\\pi i} = e^{3 \\pi i} = -1</math>), numbers can have multiple complex logarithms, and as a consequence of this, some matrices may have more than one logarithm, as explained below.\n\n==Power series expression==\nIf ''B'' is sufficiently close to the identity matrix, then a logarithm of ''B'' may be computed by means of the following power series:\n:<math>\\mathrm{log}(B)= \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty{(-1)^{k+1}\\frac{(B-I)^k}{k}} =(B-I)-\\frac{(B-I)^2}{2}+\\frac{(B-I)^3}{3}\\cdots</math>.\nSpecifically, if <math>\\left\\|{B-I}\\right\\|<1</math>, then the preceding series converges and <math>e^{\\mathrm{log}(B)}=B</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 2.8</ref>\n\n==Example: Logarithm of rotations in the plane==\n\nThe rotations in the plane give a simple example. A rotation of angle ''α'' around the origin is represented by the 2×2-matrix\n\n:<math> A =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\alpha) & -\\sin(\\alpha) \\\\\n\\sin(\\alpha) & \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nFor any integer ''n'', the matrix\n\n:<math>\nB_n=(\\alpha+2\\pi n)\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -1 \\\\\n1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nis a logarithm of ''A''. Thus, the matrix ''A'' has infinitely many logarithms. This corresponds to the fact that the rotation angle is only determined up to multiples of 2''π''.\n\nIn the language of Lie theory, the rotation matrices ''A'' are elements of the Lie group [[circle group|SO(2)]]. The corresponding logarithms ''B'' are elements of the Lie algebra so(2), which consists of all [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric matrices]]. The matrix\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 \\\\\n-1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nis a generator of the [[Lie algebra]] so(2).\n\n==Existence==\n\nThe question of whether a matrix has a logarithm has the easiest answer when considered in the complex setting. A matrix has a logarithm [[if and only if]] it is [[invertible matrix|invertible]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Higham|2008}}, Theorem 1.27</ref> The logarithm is not unique, but if a matrix has no negative real [[eigenvalue]]s, then there is a unique logarithm that has eigenvalues all lying in the strip {''z'' ∈ '''C''' | −π < Im ''z'' < π}. This logarithm is known as the ''principal logarithm''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Higham|2008}}, Theorem 1.31</ref>\n\nThe answer is more involved in the real setting. A real matrix has a real logarithm if and only if it is invertible and each [[Jordan block]] belonging to a negative eigenvalue occurs an even number of times.<ref>{{harvtxt|Culver|1966}}</ref> If an invertible real matrix does not satisfy the condition with the Jordan blocks, then it has only non-real logarithms. This can already be seen in the scalar case: no branch of the logarithm can be real at -1. The existence of real matrix logarithms of real 2&times;2 matrices is considered in a later section.\n\n==Properties==\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are both [[positive-definite matrices]], then\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}{\\log{(AB)}} = \\operatorname{tr}{\\log{(A)}} + \\operatorname{tr}{\\log{(B)}}, </math>\n\nand if ''A'' and ''B'' commute, i.e., ''AB'' = ''BA'', then\n\n:<math>\\log{(AB)} = \\log{(A)}+\\log{(B)}. \\, </math>\n\nSubstituting in this equation ''B'' = ''A<sup>−1</sup>'', one gets\n\n:<math> \\log{(A^{-1})} = -\\log{(A)}.</math>\n\n==Further example: Logarithm of rotations in 3D space==\nA rotation  {{mvar|R}} ∈ SO(3) in ℝ³ is given by a 3&times;3 [[orthogonal matrix]].\n\nThe logarithm of such a rotation matrix {{mvar|R}} can be readily computed from the antisymmetric part of [[Rodrigues' rotation formula]]<ref>Engø (2001)</ref> (see also [[Axis–angle representation#Log map from SO.283.29 to so.283.29|Axis angle]]). It yields the logarithm of minimal [[Frobenius norm]], but fails when {{mvar|R}} has eigenvalues equal to &minus;1 where this is not unique.\n\nFurther note that, given rotation matrices ''A'' and ''B'',\n:<math> d_g(A,B) := \\| \\log(A^\\top B)\\|_F </math>\nis the geodesic distance on the 3D manifold of rotation matrices.\n\n==Calculating the logarithm of a diagonalizable matrix==\n\nA method for finding ln ''A'' for a [[diagonalizable matrix]] ''A'' is the following:\n:Find the matrix ''V'' of [[eigenvector]]s of ''A'' (each column of ''V'' is an eigenvector of ''A'').\n:Find the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] ''V''<sup>&minus;1</sup> of ''V''.\n:Let\n::<math> A' = V^{-1}  A  V.\\, </math>\n:Then ''A&prime;'' will be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are eigenvalues of ''A''.\n:Replace each diagonal element of ''A&prime;'' by its (natural) logarithm in order to obtain <math> \\log  A' </math>.\n:Then\n::<math> \\log A = V ( \\log A' ) V^{-1}. \\, </math>\n\nThat the logarithm of ''A'' might be a complex matrix even if ''A'' is real then follows from the fact that a matrix with real and positive entries might nevertheless have negative or even complex eigenvalues (this is true for example for [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]]). The non-uniqueness of the logarithm of a matrix follows from the non-uniqueness of the logarithm of a complex number.\n\n==The logarithm of a non-diagonalizable matrix==\n\nThe algorithm illustrated above does not work for non-diagonalizable matrices, such as\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nFor such matrices one needs to find its [[Jordan normal form|Jordan decomposition]] and, rather than computing the logarithm of diagonal entries as above, one would calculate the logarithm of the [[Jordan matrix|Jordan block]]s.\n\nThe latter is accomplished by noticing that one can write a Jordan block as\n:<math>B=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & 1       & 0       & 0      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n0       & \\lambda & 1       & 0      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n0       & 0       & \\lambda & 1      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\ddots  & \\vdots \\\\\n0       & 0       & 0       & 0      & \\lambda & 1       \\\\\n0       & 0       & 0       & 0      & 0       & \\lambda \\\\\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\lambda \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\lambda^{-1}       & 0       & 0      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n0       & 1 & \\lambda^{-1}       & 0      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n0       & 0       & 1 & \\lambda^{-1}      & \\cdots  & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\vdots  & \\ddots & \\ddots  & \\vdots \\\\\n0       & 0       & 0       & 0      & 1 & \\lambda^{-1}       \\\\\n0       & 0       & 0       & 0      & 0       & 1 \\\\\\end{pmatrix}=\\lambda(I+K)</math>\nwhere ''K'' is a matrix with zeros on and under the main diagonal. (The number λ is nonzero by the assumption that the matrix whose logarithm one attempts to take is invertible.)\n\nThen, by the [[Mercator series]]\n\n:<math> \\log (1+x)=x-\\frac{x^2}{2}+\\frac{x^3}{3}-\\frac{x^4}{4}+\\cdots</math>\n\none gets\n\n:<math>\\log B=\\log \\big(\\lambda(I+K)\\big)=\\log (\\lambda I) +\\log (I+K)= (\\log \\lambda) I + K-\\frac{K^2}{2}+\\frac{K^3}{3}-\\frac{K^4}{4}+\\cdots </math>\n\nThis [[series (mathematics)|series]] has a finite number of terms (''K''<sup>''m''</sup> is zero if ''m'' is the dimension of ''K''), and so its sum is well-defined.\n\nUsing this approach one finds\n\n:<math>\\log \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\n== A functional analysis perspective ==\n\nA square matrix represents a [[linear operator]] on the [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> where ''n'' is the dimension of the matrix. Since such a space is finite-dimensional, this operator is actually [[bounded operator|bounded]].\n\nUsing the tools of [[holomorphic functional calculus]], given a [[holomorphic function]] ''f''(''z'') defined on an [[open set]] in the [[complex plane]] and a bounded linear operator ''T'', one can calculate ''f''(''T'') as long as ''f''(''z'') is defined on the [[spectrum of an operator|spectrum]] of ''T''.\n\nThe function ''f''(''z'')=log ''z'' can be defined on any [[simply connected]] open set in the complex plane not containing the origin, and it is holomorphic on such a domain. This implies that one can define ln ''T'' as long as the spectrum of ''T'' does not contain the origin and there is a path going from the origin to infinity not crossing the spectrum of ''T'' (e.g., if the spectrum of ''T'' is a circle with the origin inside of it, it is impossible to define ln ''T'').\n\nThe spectrum of a linear operator on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is the set of eigenvalues of its matrix, and so is a finite set. As long as the origin is not in the spectrum (the matrix is invertible),  the path condition from the previous paragraph is satisfied, and   ln ''T'' is well-defined. The non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm follows from the fact that one can choose more than one branch of the logarithm which is defined on the set of eigenvalues of a matrix.\n\n== A Lie group theory perspective ==\n\nIn the theory of [[Lie group]]s, there is an [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] from a [[Lie algebra]] ''g'' to the corresponding Lie group ''G''\n\n: <math> \\exp : g \\rightarrow G. </math>\n\nFor matrix Lie groups, the elements of ''g'' and ''G'' are square matrices and the exponential map is given by the [[matrix exponential]]. The inverse map <math> \\log=\\exp^{-1} </math> is multivalued and coincides with the matrix logarithm discussed here. The logarithm maps from the Lie group ''G'' into the Lie algebra ''g''. \nNote that the exponential map is a local diffeomorphism between a neighborhood ''U'' of the zero matrix <math> \\underline{0} \\in g</math> and a neighborhood ''V'' of the identity matrix <math>\\underline{1}\\in G</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42</ref>\nThus the (matrix) logarithm is well-defined as a map,\n:<math> \\log: V\\subset G\\rightarrow U\\subset g. \\, </math>\n\nAn important corollary of [[Jacobi's formula]] then is  \n:<math>\\log (\\det(A)) = \\mathrm{tr}(\\log A)~. </math>\n\n==Constraints in the 2 &times; 2 case==\nIf a 2 × 2 real matrix has a negative [[determinant]], it has no real logarithm. Note first that any [[2 × 2 real matrices|2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2 real matrix]] can be considered one of the three types of the complex number ''z'' = ''x'' + ''y'' ε,  where ε² ∈ { −1, 0, +1 }. This ''z'' is a point on a complex subplane of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of matrices.\n\nThe case where the determinant is negative only arises in a plane with ε² =+1, that is a [[split-complex number]] plane. Only one quarter of this plane is the image of the exponential map, so the logarithm is only defined on that quarter (quadrant). The other three quadrants are images of this one under the [[Klein four-group]] generated by ε and −1.\n\nFor example, let ''a'' = log 2 ; then cosh ''a'' = 5/4 and sinh ''a'' = 3/4.\nFor matrices, this means that\n:<math>A=\\exp \\begin{pmatrix}0 & a \\\\ a & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \n\\begin{pmatrix}\\cosh a & \\sinh a \\\\ \\sinh a & \\cosh a  \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}1.25 & .75\\\\ .75 & 1.25 \\end{pmatrix}</math>.\nSo this last matrix has logarithm\n:<math>\\log A = \\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\log 2 \\\\ \\log 2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>.\n\nThese matrices, however,  do not have a logarithm:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}3/4 & 5/4 \\\\ 5/4 & 3/4 \\end{pmatrix},\\ \n\\begin{pmatrix}-3/4 & -5/4 \\\\ -5/4 & -3/4\\end{pmatrix}, \\ \n\\begin{pmatrix}-5/4 & -3/4\\\\ -3/4 & -5/4 \\end{pmatrix}</math>.\nThey represent the three other conjugates by the four-group of the matrix above that does have a logarithm.\n\nA non-singular 2 x 2 matrix does not necessarily have a logarithm, but it is conjugate by the four-group to a matrix that does have a logarithm.\n\nIt also follows, that, e.g., a [[Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix|square root of this matrix]] ''A'' is obtainable directly from  exponentiating (log''A'')/2,\n:<math>\\sqrt{A}= \\begin{pmatrix}\\cosh ((\\log 2)/2)  & \\sinh ((\\log 2)/2)  \\\\ \\sinh  ((\\log 2)/2)  & \\cosh ((\\log 2)/2)  \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}1.06 & .35\\\\ .35 & 1.06 \\end{pmatrix}   ~.      </math>\n\nFor a richer example, start with a [[pythagorean triple]] (''p,q,r'')\nand let {{math|''a'' {{=}} log(''p'' + ''r'') &minus; log ''q''}}.  Then\n:<math>e^a = \\frac {p + r} {q} = \\cosh a + \\sinh a</math>.\n\nNow  \n:<math>\\exp \\begin{pmatrix}0 & a \\\\ a & 0 \\end{pmatrix} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}r/q & p/q \\\\ p/q & r/q \\end{pmatrix}</math>.\nThus\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{q}\\begin{pmatrix}r & p \\\\ p & r \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nhas the logarithm matrix\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}0 & a \\\\ a & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>  ,\nwhere {{math| ''a'' {{=}} log(''p'' + ''r'') &minus; log ''q''}}.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Matrix function]]\n*[[Square root of a matrix]]\n*[[Matrix exponential]]\n*[[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Gantmacher | first1=Felix R. | title=The Theory of Matrices | publisher=Chelsea | location=New York | year=1959 | volume=1 | pages=239–241}}.\n*{{citation|year=2015|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|isbn= 978-3319134666}}\n* {{Citation | doi=10.1090/S0002-9939-1966-0202740-6 | last1=Culver | first1=Walter J. | title=On the existence and uniqueness of the real logarithm of a matrix | year=1966 | journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9939 | volume=17 | issue=5 | pages=1146–1151}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Higham | first1=Nicholas | author1-link=Nicholas Higham | title=Functions of Matrices.

Because of the identity above, the distribution is properly normalized.\n\nThe [[cumulative distribution function]] is\n\n:<math> F(k) = 1 + \\frac{\\Beta(p; k+1,0)}{\\ln(1-p)}</math>\n\nwhere ''B'' is the [[incomplete beta function]].\n\nA Poisson compounded with Log(''p'')-distributed random variables has a [[negative binomial distribution]].  In other words, if ''N'' is a random variable with a [[Poisson distribution]], and ''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''i'' = 1, 2, 3, ... is an infinite sequence of independent identically distributed random variables each having a Log(''p'') distribution, then\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^N X_i</math>\nhas a negative binomial distribution.  In this way, the negative binomial distribution is seen to be a [[compound Poisson distribution]].\n\n[[Ronald Fisher|R. A.
