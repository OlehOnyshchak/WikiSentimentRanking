Given a triangular orthobicupola, a 60-degree rotation of one cupola before the joining yields a cuboctahedron.

(For instance, the six points of a regular octahedron can be paired up in this way by an axial symmetry around a line through two opposite edge midpoints, although the Bricard octahedron resulting from this pairing would not be regular.) The octahedra have 12 edges, each of which connects two points that do not belong to the same symmetric pair as each other. These edges form the [[octahedral graph]] {{math|''K''<sub>2,2,2</sub>}}.\nEach of the eight triangular faces of these octahedra connects three points, one from each symmetric pair, in all of the eight possible ways of doing this.<ref name=\"rc\">{{citation\n | last = Connelly | first = Robert | authorlink = Robert Connelly\n | editor-last = [[David A.

Omitting the faces eliminates the self-crossings for many (but not all) positions of these octahedra. The resulting [[kinematic chain]] has one [[degree of freedom]] of motion, the same as the polyhedron from which it is derived.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Cromwell | first = Peter R.\n | isbn = 0-521-55432-2\n | location = Cambridge\n | mr = 1458063\n | page = 239\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | title = Polyhedra\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OJowej1QWpoC&pg=PA239\n | year = 1997}}.</ref>\n\n==Explanation==\nThe [[quadrilateral]]s formed by the edges between the points in any two symmetric pairs of points can be thought of as [[equator]]s of the octahedron. These equators have the property (by their symmetry) that opposite pairs of quadrilateral sides have equal length. Every quadrilateral with opposite pairs of equal sides, embedded in [[Euclidean space]], has axial symmetry, and some (such as the rectangle) have other symmetries besides. If one cuts the Bricard octahedron into two open-bottomed [[pyramid]]s by slicing it along one of its equators, both of these open pyramids can flex, and the flexing motion can be made to preserve the axis of symmetry of the whole shape. But, by the symmetries of its construction, the flexing motions of these two open pyramids both move the equator along which they were cut in the same way. Therefore, they can be glued back together into a single flexing motion of the whole octahedron.<ref name=\"rc\"/><ref name=\"ft\"/>\n\nThe property of having opposite sides of equal length is true of the [[rectangle]], [[parallelogram]], and [[antiparallelogram]], and it is possible to construct Bricard octahedra having any of those flat shapes as their equators.\nHowever, the equator of a Bricard octahedron is not required to lie in a plane; instead, it can be a [[Skew polygon|skew quadrilateral]]. Even for Bricard octahedra constructed to have a flat equator, the equator generally does not remain flat as the octahedron flexes.<ref name=\"rc\"/> However, for some Bricard octahedra, such as the octahedron with an antiparallelogram equator shown in the illustration, the symmetries of the polyhedron cause its equator to remain planar at all times.\n\n==Additional properties==\nThe [[Dehn invariant]] of any Bricard octahedron remains constant as it undergoes its flexing motion. This is [[conjecture]]d to be true, more generally, for any flexible polyhedron.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Alexandrov | first = Victor\n | arxiv = 0901.2989\n | doi = 10.1007/s00022-011-0061-7\n | issue = 1–2\n | journal = Journal of Geometry\n | mr = 2823098\n | pages = 1–13\n | title = The Dehn invariants of the Bricard octahedra\n | volume = 99\n | year = 2010}}.</ref>\n\n==Extensions==\nIt is possible to modify the Bricard polyhedra by adding more faces, in order to move the self-crossing parts of the polyhedron away from each other while still allowing it to flex. The simplest of these modifications is a polyhedron discovered by Klaus Steffen with nine vertices and 14 triangular faces.<ref name=\"rc\"/> [[Steffen's polyhedron]] is the simplest possible flexible polyhedron without self-crossings.<ref name=\"do07\"/>\n\nBy connecting together multiple shapes derived from the Bricard octahedron, it is possible to construct [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]-shaped [[rigid origami]] forms whose shape traces out complicated [[space curve]]s.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Tachi | first = Tomohiro\n | doi = 10.1115/1.4031717\n | issue = 3\n | journal = Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics\n | page = 031008\n | title = Designing rigidly foldable horns using Bricard's octahedron\n | volume = 8\n | year = 2016}}.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Nonconvex polyhedra]]\n[[Category:Mathematics of rigidity]]\n[[Category:Linkages (mechanical)]]"

The seven vertices and 21 edges of the Császár polyhedron form an embedding of the [[complete graph]] <math>K_7</math> onto a topological [[torus]]. Of the 35 possible triangles from vertices of the polyhedron, only 14 are faces.\n\n==Complete graph==\n[[File:Csaszar polyhedron.stl|thumb|left|[[STL (file format)|STL model]] of a Császár polyhedron]]\n[[File:Csaszar_polyhedron_3D_model.svg|thumb|link={{filepath:Csaszar_polyhedron_3D_model.svg}}|Interactive orthographic projection of a Csaszar polyhedron. In [{{filepath:Csaszar_polyhedron_3D_model.svg}} the SVG image], move the mouse left and right to rotate the model.]]\nThe [[tetrahedron]] and the Császár polyhedron are the only two known polyhedra (having a [[manifold]] boundary) without any diagonals: every two vertices of the polygon are connected by an edge, so there is no line segment between two vertices that does not lie on the polyhedron boundary. That is, the vertices and edges of the Császár polyhedron form a [[complete graph]].\n\nIf the boundary of a polyhedron with ''v'' vertices forms a surface with ''h'' holes, in such a way that every pair of vertices is connected by an edge, it follows by some manipulation of the [[Euler characteristic]] that\n:<math>h = \\frac{(v-3)(v-4)}{12}.</math>\nThis equation is satisfied for the tetrahedron with ''h'' = 0 and ''v'' = 4, and for the Császár polyhedron with ''h'' = 1 and ''v'' = 7. The next possible solution, ''h'' = 6 and ''v'' = 12, would correspond to a polyhedron with 44 faces and 66 edges, but it is not realizable as a polyhedron. It is not known whether such a polyhedron exists with a higher genus {{harv|Ziegler|2008}}.\n\nMore generally, this equation can be satisfied only when ''v'' is congruent to 0, 3, 4, or 7 [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 12 {{harv|Lutz|2001}}.<br clear=\"left\" />\n\n==History and related polyhedra==\nThere are other known polyhedra such as the [[Schönhardt polyhedron]] for which there are no interior diagonals (that is, all diagonals are outside the polyhedron) as well as non-manifold surfaces with no diagonals {{harvs|last=Szabó|year=1984|year2=2009}}.\n\nThe Császár polyhedron is named after Hungarian topologist [[Ákos Császár]], who discovered it in 1949. The [[dual polyhedron|dual]] to the Császár polyhedron, the [[Szilassi polyhedron]], was discovered later, in 1977, by Lajos Szilassi; it has 14 vertices, 21 edges, and seven [[hexagon]]al faces, each sharing an edge with every other face. Like the Császár polyhedron, the Szilassi polyhedron has the topology of a torus.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation \n  | author=Császár, A. \n  | title = A polyhedron without diagonals \n  | journal = Acta Sci.

The [[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy rigidity theorem]] shows that in dimension&nbsp;3 such a polyhedron cannot be [[convex set|convex]] (this is also true in higher dimensions).\n\nThe first examples of flexible polyhedra, now called '''Bricard's octahedra''',  were discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Raoul Bricard|first=Raoul |last=Bricard |year= 1897}}.  They are self-intersecting surfaces [[isometry|isometric]] to an [[octahedron]].  The first example of a flexible non-self-intersecting surface in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, the '''Connelly sphere''', was discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Connelly|first=Robert |last=Connelly |year= 1977}}.\n\n== Bellows conjecture ==\n\nIn the late 1970s Connelly and [[D. Sullivan]] formulated the '''bellows conjecture''' stating that the [[volume]] of a flexible polyhedron is invariant under flexing.  This conjecture was proved for polyhedra [[homeomorphic]] to a [[sphere]] by {{harvs|txt | last1=[[:ru:Сабитов, Иджад Хакович|Sabitov]] | first1=I.

The proof extends [[Piero della Francesca]]'s formula for the [[Tetrahedron#Volume|volume of a tetrahedron]] to a formula for the volume of any polyhedron. The extended formula shows that the volume must be a root of a polynomial whose coefficients depend only on the lengths of the polyhedron's edges. Since the edge lengths cannot change as the polyhedron flexes, the volume must remain at one of the finitely many roots of the polynomial, rather than changing continuously {{harv|Demaine|O'Rourke|2007}}.\n\n== Scissor congruence ==\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Must the Dehn invariant of a flexible polyhedron stay invariant as it flexes?}}\nConnelly conjectured that the [[Dehn invariant]] of a flexible polyhedron is invariant under flexing.  This is known as the '''strong bellows conjecture'''.  Preservation of the Dehn invariant is known to be equivalent to [[scissors congruence]] of the enclosed region under flexing. It is known that the Bricard octahedra obey the strong bellows conjecture, as does [[Steffen's polyhedron]], a non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedron derived from them {{harv|Alexandrov|2010}}.\nThe total  [[mean curvature]] of a flexible polyhedron, defined as the sum of the products of edge lengths with exterior dihedral angles, is a function of the Dehn invariant that is also known to stay constant while a polyhedron flexes {{harv|Alexander|1985}}. However, the full strong bellows conjecture remains unproven.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\nFlexible [[4-polytope]]s in 4-dimensional Euclidean space and 3-dimensional [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic space]] were studied by {{harvs|first=Hellmuth|last=Stachel|authorlink=Hellmuth Stachel|year=2000|txt}}.

Coxeter discovered the continuous series of chiral icosahedra with 8 regular faces and 12 isosceles faces, ranging from cuboctahedron to regular octahedron (as limit cases), which can be inscribed in a regular octahedron. The Jessen's icosahedron is thus an example of [[Stigler's law of eponymy]].\n\nThe Jessen's icosahedron has several interesting [[geometric]] properties: \n\n* It is [[Isogonal figure|vertex-transitive]] (or ''isogonal''), meaning that it has symmetries taking any vertex to any other vertex.\n* It has only [[Right angle|right]] [[dihedral angle]]s.\n* It is (continuously) rigid but not infinitesimally [[Structural rigidity|rigid]]. That is, in less formal language, it is a shaky polyhedron.\n* As with the simpler [[Schönhardt polyhedron]], its interior cannot be [[Triangulation (geometry)|triangulated]] into [[Tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] without adding new [[Vertex (geometry)|vertices]]. \n* It is [[Hilbert's third problem|scissors-congruent]] to a cube, meaning that it can be sliced into smaller polyhedral pieces that can be rearranged to form a solid cube.\n\nAlthough a shape resembling Jessen's icosahedron can be formed by keeping the vertices of a regular icosahedron in their original positions and replacing certain pairs of equilateral-triangle faces by pairs of isosceles triangles, the resulting polyhedron does not have right-angled dihedrals. The vertices of Jessen's icosahedron are perturbed from these positions in order to give all the dihedrals right angles.\n\n== Tension integrity transformations ==\n[[File:Jitterbug pausing at jessen form.gif|alt=|thumb|The Jitterbug transformation of the Jessen's icosahedron, pausing at the cuboctahedron, icosahedron and octahedron.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://antiprism.com/album/875_jitterbugs/index.html|title=Jitterbug Animations|last=Rossiter|first=Adrian|date=|website=www.antiprism.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>]]\nThe Jessen's icosahedron is one of a family of chiral dipolygonids described by H.F. Verheyen{{Sfn|Verheyen|1989}} capable of twisting, expansive-contractive transformations termed [[Synergetics (Fuller)#Tetrahedral accounting|Jitterbug transformations]] by [[Buckminster Fuller]].\n\n[[File:Tensegrity Icosahedron.png|thumb|A rod-and-cable tensegrity icosahedron (unskinned).]]\n\nIn particular, the Jessen's icosahedron is the geometry of the [[Tensegrity#Tensegrity icosahedra|tensegrity icosahedon]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Geodesic math and how to use it|last=Hugh.|first=Kenner|date=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0520239319|location=Berkeley|pages=|oclc=2561084}}</ref>, a physical structure composed of six rigid compression rods (forming the concave edges) and 24 tension cables (forming the other edges). Realized in this form, the Jessen's icosahedron's property of continuous but not infinitesimal rigidity (its equilibrium shakiness) is dramatically manifest. Only the rods must be rigid, to resist compression and keep the cables taught and the whole structure drum-tight, despite the fact that the rods do not touch each other: they float in a net of tension cables. \n\nThe 6 rods float in parallel pairs, one pair lying in each of the three orthogonal planes. The pairs rest {{sqrt|3/2}} edge lengths apart from each other. The rod length must be twice this distance (about 2.45 edge lengths).{{Efn|The 3/2 power also occurs, famously, in [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Third law of Kepler|Kepler's third law]], as the ratio of the radius of a planetary orbit to its period. This is not a coincidence, but a consequence of the similar spherical geometry of these two equilibrium systems, in which the 3/2 power ratio describes the balance point of the compressive (radial) and tensive (circumferential) forces at which the stable system rests.|name=|group=}}  \n\nProvided the 6 compression rods are spring-like and can be compressed slightly (down to √2 edge lengths), the 6 concave pairs of isosceles triangles can be folded open (simultaneously) into square faces, transforming the Jessen's icosahedron into a [[cuboctahedron]]. Or they can be folded closed (which also compresses the 6 rods to length √2), transforming the Jessen's icosahedron into an [[octahedron]]. Released, the compressed rods spring back to their resting length, returning the Jessen's icosahedron to its resting shape. \n\nThese two ways of compressing the concave edges amount to twisting the whole structure away from its resting shape in one of two opposing directions. The vertices move slightly all together in either outward or inward spirals, and the long radius (center to vertex) of the entire structure grows from its resting length to a maximum (the cuboctahedral radius of 1 edge length) when fully open, or shrinks to a minimum (the octahedral radius of √2/2 edge lengths) when fully closed. The compression rods move slightly as well. When compressed, they move either apart (outward) or toward each other (inward), but always remain parallel and in their original plane. The simplest way to force the structure to expand or contract (which it always does radially and symmetrically) is to grab any pair of rods, and push them apart or pull them together. The other two pairs will move the same distance, in concert. \n\nWhen the parallel rods are exactly one edge length apart, the vertices describe a regular icosahedron. This is not quite the resting shape; it is reached when the structure has been twisted slightly inward (the rods have been forced slightly together from their resting distance of about 1.225 edge lengths).  \n\nAs the isosceles faces fold outward or inward, they distort (because their long edge shortens). The equilateral faces displace also, but do not change shape during the twisting; they merely rotate around their centers  and travel outward or inward slightly.{{Efn|The triangular faces rotate up to 45 degrees left or right of their resting positions, so their vertices travel a spiral path outward or inward on the surface of a cylinder whose axis passes through the centers of opposite triangular faces.}}. Therefore the physical structure can even be skinned with rigid equilateral panels, and with foldable or stretchable isosceles panels, without impeding its ability to traverse the entire range of motion.{{Efn|The concavities which fold open or closed are irregular tetrahedra, with four unit-length edges (tension cables) and two opposing unequal-length edges whose lengths vary with the motion. At equilibrium, the shorter unequal edge (the \"invisible edge\") is 1.225 and the opposing unequal edge (the compression rod) is exactly twice that. The shorter edge varies between 0 and 1.41 (the regular icosahedron appearing when it is 1). The longer edge varies between 2.45 (at equilibrium) and 1.41 (at fully open or fully closed).}} \n\nFinally, if the compression rods are not springs but nearly rigid, the structure still exhibits its equilibrium springiness, even though the isosceles faces are not able to fold fully open or fully closed. To whatever extent the rods can be compressed, even minutely, a very evident small range of inward and outward motion (springy radial expansion and contraction) remains.\n[[File:NASA SUPERball Tensegrity Lander Prototype.jpg|thumb|The NASA SUPERball Tensegrity Robot. This is an early prototype of a system which will eventually be able to land on another planet without an airbag, and then be able to move around and explore. All motion comes from changing the cable lengths, and the tensegrity structure gives it the structural compliance to absorb landing impact forces.]]\nA tensegrity icosahedron capable of the full range of motion can also be constructed using fixed-length rigid rods which cannot be compressed, provided the cables can be stretched instead. The NASA SUPERball tensegrity robot is an example of such a structure that is capable of even more complex motions, since its cables can be elongated individually (by unwinding them from spools).\n\n== See also == \n* [[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Cite journal|ref=harv|first=Børge|last=Jessen|title=Orthogonal Icosahedra|journal=Nordisk Matematisk Tidskrift|volume=15|issue=2|pages=90–96|year=1967|jstor=24524998}}\n* {{Cite book | ref=harv | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | author-link=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | year=1973 | orig-year=1948 | title=Regular Polytopes | publisher=Dover | place=New York | edition=3rd | isbn= | title-link=Regular Polytopes (book)|pp=50–52|chapter=§3.7.

It is named after German mathematician [[Erich Schönhardt]], who first described it in 1928.\n\n==Construction==\nThe Schönhardt polyhedron can be formed by two [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[equilateral triangle]]s in two parallel planes, such that the line through the centers of the triangles is perpendicular to the planes. The two triangles should be twisted with respect to each other, so that they are neither [[translation (geometry)|translates]] of each other nor 180-degree reflections of each other.\n\nThe [[convex hull]] of these two triangles forms a [[convex polyhedron]] that is combinatorially equivalent to a [[regular octahedron]]; along with the triangle edges, it has six edges connecting the two triangles to each other, with two different lengths, and three interior [[diagonal]]s. The Schönhardt polyhedron is formed by removing the three longest connecting edges, and replacing them by the three diagonals of the convex hull.  An equivalent procedure is to start with a regular octahedron and twist one face within its plane, without breaking any edges.  With a 60° twist a triangular prism is formed; with a 120° twist there are two tetrahedra sharing the central vertex; any amount of twist between these two cases gives a Schönhardt polyhedron.\n\nAlternatively, the Schönhardt polyhedron can be formed by removing three disjoint tetrahedra from this convex hull: each of the removed tetrahedra is the convex hull of four vertices from the two triangles, two from each triangle. This removal causes the longer of the three connecting edges to be replaced by three new edges with concave [[dihedral angle]]s, forming a nonconvex polyhedron.\n\n==Properties==\nThe Schönhardt polyhedron is combinatorially equivalent to the [[regular octahedron]]: its vertices, edges, and faces can be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the features of a regular octahedron. However, unlike the regular octahedron, three of its edges have concave [[dihedral angle]]s, and these three edges form a [[perfect matching]] of the graph of the octahedron; this fact is sufficient to show that it cannot be triangulated.\n\nThe six vertices of the Schönhardt polyhedron can be used to form fifteen unordered pairs of vertices. Twelve of these fifteen pairs form edges of the polyhedron: there are six edges in the two equilateral triangle faces, and six edges connecting the two triangles. The remaining three edges form [[diagonal]]s of the polyhedron, but lie entirely outside the polyhedron.\n\n==Impossibility of triangulation==\nIt is impossible to partition the Schönhardt polyhedron into [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]] whose vertices are vertices of the polyhedron. More strongly, there is no tetrahedron that lies entirely inside the Schönhardt polyhedron and has vertices of the polyhedron as its four vertices. For, among any four vertices of the Schönhardt polyhedron, at least one pair of vertices from these four vertices must be a diagonal of the polyhedron, which lies entirely outside the polyhedron.\n\n==Related constructions==\nIt was shown by {{harvtxt|Rambau|2005}} that the Schönhardt polyhedron can be generalized to other polyhedra, combinatorially equivalent to [[antiprism]]s, that cannot be triangulated. These polyhedra are formed by connecting regular ''k''-gons in two parallel planes, twisted with respect to each other, in such a way that ''k'' of the 2''k'' edges that connect the two ''k''-gons have concave dihedrals. Another polyhedron that cannot be triangulated is [[Jessen's icosahedron]], combinatorially equivalent to a [[regular icosahedron]].\n\nIn a different direction, {{harvtxt|Bagemihl|1948}} constructed a polyhedron that shares with the Schönhardt polyhedron the property that it has no internal [[diagonal]]s. The [[tetrahedron]] and the [[Császár polyhedron]] have no diagonals at all: every pair of vertices in these polyhedra forms an edge. It remains an open question whether there are any other polyhedra (with [[manifold]] boundary) without diagonals {{harv|Ziegler|2008}}, although there exist non-manifold surfaces with no diagonals and any number of vertices greater than five {{harvs|last=Szabó|year=1984|year2=2009}}.\n\n==Applications==\n{{harvtxt|Ruppert|Seidel|1992}} used Schönhardt's polyhedron as the basis for a proof that it is [[NP-complete]] to determine whether a non-convex polyhedron can be triangulated.\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation\n | last = Bagemihl | first = F.\n | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]]\n | pages = 411–413\n | title = On indecomposable polyhedra\n | volume = 55\n | year = 1948\n | doi = 10.2307/2306130\n | issue = 7\n | publisher = Mathematical Association of America\n | jstor = 2306130}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Rambau | first = J.\n | contribution = On a generalization of Schönhardt's polyhedron\n | location = Cambridge\n | pages = 501–516\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | title = Combinatorial and computational geometry\n | contribution-url = http://www.msri.org/communications/books/Book52/files/27rambau.pdf\n | year = 2005}}. \n*{{citation\n | last1 = Ruppert | first1 = J.\n | last2 = Seidel | first2 = R. | author2-link = Raimund Seidel\n | pages = 227–253\n | journal = [[Discrete and Computational Geometry]]\n | volume = 7  \n | year = 1992\n | doi = 10.1007/BF02187840\n | title = On the difficulty of triangulating three-dimensional nonconvex polyhedra}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Schönhardt | first = E. | authorlink = Erich Schönhardt\n | journal = [[Mathematische Annalen]]\n | pages = 309–312\n | title = Über die Zerlegung von Dreieckspolyedern in Tetraeder\n | url = http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/no_cache/dms/load/img/?IDDOC=27796\n | volume = 98\n | year = 1928\n | doi = 10.1007/BF01451597}}.\n*{{citation|last=Szabó|first=Sándor|journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica|year=1984|title=Polyhedra without diagonals|volume=15|issue=1|pages=41–49|doi=10.1007/BF02109370}}.\n*{{citation|last=Szabó|first=Sándor|journal=Periodica Mathematica Hungarica|year=2009|title=Polyhedra without diagonals II|volume=58|issue=2|pages=181–187|doi=10.1007/s10998-009-10181-x}}.\n*{{citation|last=Ziegler|first=Günter M.|authorlink=Günter M.

      "text": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:Stellation diagram of icosahedron.svg|300px|thumb|The [[stellation diagram]] for the icosahedron with the central triangle marked for the original icosahedron]]\n'''''The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra''''' is a book written and illustrated by [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], [[Patrick du Val|P. Du Val]], H. T. Flather and J. F. Petrie. It enumerates certain [[stellation]]s of the regular convex or Platonic [[regular icosahedron|icosahedron]], according to a set of rules put forward by [[J. C. P. Miller]].\n\nFirst published by the University of Toronto in 1938, a Second Edition reprint by Springer-Verlag followed in 1982. Tarquin's 1999 Third Edition included new reference material and photographs by K. and D. Crennell.\n\n==Authors' contributions==\n\n===Miller's rules===\n\nAlthough [[J. C. P. Miller|Miller]] did not contribute to the book directly, he was a close colleague of Coxeter and Petrie. His contribution is immortalised in his set of rules for defining which stellation forms should be considered \"properly significant and distinct\":<ref>Coxeter, du Val, et al (Third Edition 1999) Pages 15-16.</ref>\n\n:''(i) The faces must lie in twenty planes, viz., the bounding planes of the regular icosahedron.''\n\n:''(ii) All parts composing the faces must be the same in each plane, although they may be quite disconnected.''\n\n:''(iii) The parts included in any one plane must have trigonal symmetry, without or with reflection. This secures icosahedral symmetry for the whole solid.''\n\n:''(iv) The parts included in any plane must all be \"accessible\" in the completed solid (i.e. they must be on the \"outside\". In certain cases we should require models of enormous size in order to see all the outside. With a model of ordinary size, some parts of the \"outside\" could only be explored by a crawling insect).''\n\n:''(v) We exclude from consideration cases where the parts can be divided into two sets, each giving a solid with as much symmetry as the whole figure. But we allow the combination of an enantiomorphous pair having no common part (which actually occurs in just one case).''\n\nRules (i) to (iii) are symmetry requirements for the face planes. Rule (iv) excludes buried holes, to ensure that no two stellations look outwardly identical. Rule (v) prevents any disconnected compound of simpler stellations.\n\n===Coxeter===\nCoxeter was the main driving force behind the work. He carried out the original analysis based on Miller's rules, adopting a number of techniques such as [[combinatorics]] and abstract [[graph theory]] whose use in a geometrical context was then novel.\n\nHe observed that the stellation diagram comprised many line segments. He then developed procedures for manipulating combinations of the adjacent plane regions, to formally enumerate the combinations allowed under Miller's rules.\n\n[[File:icosagraph.svg|right]]\nHis graph, reproduced here, shows the connectivity of the various faces identified in the stellation diagram (see below). The Greek symbols represent sets of possible alternatives:\n: λ may be 3 or 4\n: μ may be 7 or 8\n: ν may be 11 or 12\n\n===Du Val===\nDu Val devised a symbolic notation for identifying sets of congruent cells, based on the observation that they lie in \"shells\" around the original icosahedron. Based on this he tested all possible combinations against Miller's rules, confirming the result of Coxeter's more analytical approach.\n\n===Flather===\nFlather's contribution was indirect: he made card models of all 59. When he first met Coxeter he had already made many stellations, including some \"non-Miller\" examples. He went on to complete the series of fifty-nine, which are preserved in the mathematics library of Cambridge University, England. The library also holds some non-Miller models, but it is not known whether these were made by Flather or by Miller's later students.<ref>Inchbald, G.; ''Some lost stellations of the icosahedron'', steelpillow.com, 11 July 2006. [http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/icosa/lost/lost.html] (retrieved 14 September 2017)]</ref>\n\n===Petrie===\nJohn Flinders Petrie was a lifelong friend of Coxeter and had a remarkable ability to visualise four-dimensional geometry. He and Coxeter had worked together on many mathematical problems. His direct contribution to the fifty nine icosahedra was the exquisite set of three-dimensional drawings which provide much of the fascination of the published work.\n\n===The Crennells===\nFor the Third Edition, Kate and David Crennell reset the text and redrew the diagrams. They also added a reference section containing tables, diagrams, and photographs of some of the Cambridge models (which at that time were all thought to be Flather's). Corrections to this edition have been published online.<ref>K. and D. Crennell; ''The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra'', Fortran Friends, [http://fortran.orpheusweb.co.uk/Poly/59icos.htm] (retrieved 14 September 2017).</ref>\n\n==List of the fifty nine icosahedra==\n\n[[File:Icosahedron stellation diagram center.svg|thumb|right|300px|Stellation diagram with numbered cells]]\n[[File:Icosahedron cell diagram.svg|thumb|right|150px|Cell diagram with Du Val notation for cells]]\n\nBefore Coxeter, only [[Max Brückner|Brückner]] and [[A. Harry Wheeler|Wheeler]] had recorded any significant sets of stellations, although a few such as the great icosahedron had been known for longer. Since publication of ''The 59'', Wenninger published instructions on making models of some; the numbering scheme used in his book has become widely referenced, although he only recorded a few stellations.\n\n===Notes on the list===\nIndex numbers are the Crennells' unless otherwise stated:\n\n'''Crennell'''\n*In the index numbering added to the Third Edition by the Crennells, the first 32 forms (indices 1-32) are [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflective]] models, and the last 27 (indices 33-59) are [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] with only the right-handed forms listed. This follows the order in which the stellations are depicted in the book.\n\n'''Cells'''\n*In Du Val's notation, each shell is identified in bold type, working outwards, as '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', ..., '''h''' with '''a''' being the original icosahedron. Some shells subdivide into two types of cell, for example '''e''' comprises '''e<sub>1</sub>''' and  '''e<sub>2</sub>'''. The set '''f<sub>1</sub>''' further subdivides into right- and left-handed forms, respectively f<sub>1</sub> (plain type) and ''f<sub>1</sub>'' (italic). Where a stellation has all cells present within an outer shell, the outer shell is capitalised and the inner omitted, for example '''a''' + '''b''' + '''c''' + '''e<sub>1</sub>''' is written as '''Ce<sub>1</sub>'''.\n\n'''Faces'''\n*All of the stellations can be specified by a [[stellation diagram]]. In the diagram shown here, the numbered colors indicate the regions of the stellation diagram which must occur together as a set, if full icosahedral symmetry is to be maintained. The diagram has 13 such sets. Some of these subdivide into chiral pairs (not shown), allowing stellations with rotational but not reflexive symmetry. In the table, faces which are seen from underneath are indicated by an apostrophe, for example '''3{{'}}'''.\n\n'''Wenninger'''\n*The index numbers and the numbered names were allocated arbitrarily by Wenninger's publisher according to their occurrence in his book ''Polyhedron models'' and bear no relation to any mathematical sequence. Only a few of his models were of icosahedra. His names are given in shortened form, with \"... of the icosahedron\" left off.\n\n'''Wheeler'''\n*Wheeler found his figures, or \"forms\" of the icosahedron, by selecting line segments from the stellation diagram. He carefully distinguished this from [[Kepler]]'s classical [[stellation]] process. Coxeter et al. ignored this distinction and referred to all of them as stellations.\n\n'''Brückner'''\n*[[Max Brückner]] made and photographed models of many polyhedra, only a few of which were icosahedra. ''Taf.'' is an abbreviation of ''Tafel'', German for ''[[Collotype|plate]]''.\n\n'''Remarks'''\n*No. 8 is sometimes called the '''echidnahedron''' after an imagined similarity to the spiny anteater or [[echidna]]. This usage is independent of [[Kepler]]'s description of his [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|regular star polyhedra]] as his ''echidnae''.\n\n===Table of the fifty-nine icosahedra===\nSome images illustrate the mirror-image icosahedron with the ''f''<sub>1</sub> rather than the f<sub>1</sub> cell.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Crennell !!Cells !![[The fifty nine icosahedra#Stellation diagram|Faces]] !![[List of Wenninger polyhedron models#Stellations of icosahedron|Wenninger]] !!Wheeler !!Brückner\n!Remarks\n!Face diagram\n!3D\n|-\n|1 \n|'''A''' ||'''0''' ||<span style=\"display:none\">0</span>4<BR>Icosahedron ||1 ||{{sort|9999|}}\n|The [[Platonic solid|Platonic]] [[icosahedron]] \n|[[File:Stellation diagram of icosahedron.svg|100px]]\n|[[File:Stellation icosahedron A.png|100px]]\n|-\n|2 \n|'''B''' ||'''1''' ||26<br> Triakis icosahedron\n||2 ||{{sort|0802|Taf.

      "text": "…[[Image:Zeroth stellation of dodecahedron facets.svg|thumb|The stellation diagram for the regular [[dodecahedron]] with the central pentagon highlighted. This diagram represents the dodecahedron face itself.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''stellation diagram''' or '''stellation pattern''' is a two-dimensional diagram in the plane of some face of a [[polyhedron]], showing lines where other face planes [[intersection|intersect]] with this one. The lines cause 2D space to be divided up into regions. Regions not intersected by any further lines are called elementary regions. Usually [[unbounded set|unbounded]] regions are excluded from the diagram, along with any portions of the lines extending to [[point at infinity|infinity]]. Each elementary region represents a top face of one [[Cell (geometry)|cell]], and a bottom face of another.\n\nA collection of these diagrams, one for each face type, can be used to represent any [[stellation]] of the polyhedron, by shading the regions which should appear in that stellation.\n\nA stellation diagram exists for every face of a given polyhedron. In [[face transitive]] polyhedra, symmetry can be used to require all faces have the same diagram shading.

This polyhedron is sometimes called ''Escher's solid''; it appears in [[M. C. Escher]]'s works ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' and in a study for ''[[Stars (M. C.

It has 26 vertices in total: 6 with degree 8, 8 with degree 6, and 12 with degree 4. It has 72 edges in total, giving an [[Euler characteristic]] of 26 + 48 &minus; 72 = +2. Its vertices are identical to those of the [[cuboctahedron]]. It can be constructed by taking a [[square pyramid]] of base length 2 and height 1, with the base centered at the origin and the apex on the Z-axis, and then rotating it so that the apex lies on each of the 6 half-axes in turn. The union of the six square pyramids gives the stellated rhombic dodecahedron.\n\n== Space-filling==\nIt can [[Tessellation|tessellate]] space in the [[stellated rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]].

Antiprisms are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s and are a (degenerate) type of [[snub polyhedron]]. \n\nAntiprisms are similar to [[prism (geometry)|prism]]s except the bases are twisted relative to each other, and that the side faces are triangles, rather than quadrilaterals.\n\nIn the case of a regular ''n''-sided base, one usually considers the case where its copy is twisted by an angle {{sfrac|180°|''n''}}. Extra regularity is obtained when the line connecting the base centers is perpendicular to the base planes, making it a '''right antiprism'''. As faces, it has the two [[n-gon|''n''-gonal]] bases and, connecting those bases, 2''n'' isosceles triangles.\n\n==Uniform antiprism==\nA '''[[Prismatic uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism''' has, apart from the base faces, 2''n'' equilateral triangles as faces. As a class, the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra, as do the uniform prisms. For {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}} we have as degenerate case the regular [[tetrahedron]] as a ''digonal antiprism'', and for {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 3}} the non-degenerate regular [[octahedron]] as a ''triangular antiprism''.\n\nThe [[dual polyhedra]] of the antiprisms are the [[trapezohedra]]. Their existence was discussed and their name was coined by [[Johannes Kepler]], though it is possible that they were previously known to Archimedes as they satisfy the same conditions on vertices as the [[Archimedean solid]]s.\n\n{{UniformAntiprisms}}\n\n=== Schlegel diagrams===\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n|[[File:3-cube t2.svg|100px]]<BR>A3\n|[[File:Square antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A4\n|[[File:Pentagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A5\n|[[File:Hexagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A6\n|[[File:Heptagonal antiprism graph.png|100px]]<BR>A7\n|[[File:Octagonal antiprismatic graph.png|100px]]<BR>A8\n|}\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\n[[Cartesian coordinates]] for the vertices of a right antiprism with ''n''-gonal bases and isosceles triangles are\n:<math>\\left( \\cos\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, \\sin\\frac{k\\pi}{n}, (-1)^k h \\right)</math>\n\nwith ''k'' ranging from 0 to 2''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1; if the triangles are equilateral,\n:<math>2h^2=\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{n}-\\cos\\frac{2\\pi}{n}.</math>\n\n==Volume and surface area==\nLet ''a'' be the edge-length of a [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]] antiprism.

Star antiprism compounds also can be constructed where ''p'' and ''q'' have common factors; thus a 10/4 antiprism is the compound of two 5/2 star antiprisms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=6|Star antiprisms by symmetry, up to 12\n|-\n![[List of spherical symmetry groups|Symmetry group]]\n!colspan=4|Uniform stars\n!Other stars\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>4d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,8]<BR>(2*5)\n|colspan=4|&nbsp;\n| [[Image:Crossed square antiprism.png|64px]]<BR>[[crossed square antiprism|3.3/2.3.4]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>5h</sub><BR>[2,5]<BR>(*225)\n| [[Image:Pentagrammic antiprism.png|64px]]<BR>[[Pentagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.5/2]]\n|colspan=3|&nbsp;\n| [[Image:Crossed pentagonal antiprism.png|64px]]<BR>[[crossed pentagonal antiprism|3.3/2.3.5]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>5d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,10]<BR>(2*5)\n| [[Image:Pentagrammic crossed antiprism.png|64px]]<BR>[[Pentagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.5/3]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>6d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,12]<BR>(2*6)\n|colspan=4|&nbsp;\n| [[Image:Crossed hexagonal antiprism.png|64px]]<BR>[[crossed hexagonal antiprism|3.3/2.3.6]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>7h</sub><BR>[2,7]<BR>(*227)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 7-2.png|64px]]<BR>[[Heptagrammic antiprism (7/2)|3.3.3.7/2]]\n| [[Image:Antiprism 7-4.png|64px]]<BR>[[Heptagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.7/4]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>7d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,14]<BR>(2*7)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 7-3.png|64px]]<BR>[[Heptagrammic antiprism (7/3)|3.3.3.7/3]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>8d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,16]<BR>(2*8)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 8-3.png|64px]]<BR>[[Octagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.8/3]]\n| [[Image:Antiprism 8-5.png|64px]]<BR>[[Octagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.8/5]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>9h</sub><BR>[2,9]<BR>(*229)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 9-2.png|64px]]<BR>[[Enneagrammic antiprism (9/2)|3.3.3.9/2]]\n| [[Image:Antiprism 9-4.png|64px]]<BR>[[Enneagrammic antiprism (9/4)|3.3.3.9/4]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>9d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,18]<BR>(2*9)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 9-5.png|64px]]<BR>[[Enneagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.9/5]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>10d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,12]<BR>(2*10)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 10-3.png|64px]]<BR>[[Decagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.10/3]]\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>11h</sub><BR>[2,11]<BR>(*2.2.11)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-2.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/2\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-4.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/4\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-6.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/6\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>11d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,22]<BR>(2*11)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-3.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/3\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-5.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/5\n| [[Image:Antiprism 11-7.png|64px]]<BR>3.3.3.11/7\n|-\n!align=center| d<sub>12d</sub><BR>[2<sup>+</sup>,24]<BR>(2*12)\n| [[Image:Antiprism 12-5.png|64px]]<BR>[[Dodecagrammic antiprism|3.3.3.12/5]]\n| [[Image:Antiprism 12-7.png|64px]]<BR>[[Dodecagrammic crossed-antiprism|3.3.3.12/7]]\n|-\n| ...\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Apeirogonal antiprism]]\n*[[Rectified antiprism]]\n*[[Grand antiprism]] – a four-dimensional polytope\n*[[One World Trade Center]], a building consisting primarily of an elongated square antiprism\n*[[Skew polygon]]\n\n== References==\n* {{cite book | author= Anthony Pugh | year= 1976 | title= Polyhedra: A visual approach | publisher= University of California Press Berkeley | location= California | isbn= 0-520-03056-7  }} Chapter 2: Archimedean polyhedra, prisma and antiprisms\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Antiprisms}}\n*{{MathWorld |urlname=Antiprism |title=Antiprism}}\n*[http://home.comcast.net/~tpgettys/nonconvexprisms.html Nonconvex Prisms and Antiprisms]\n*[http://www.software3d.com/Prisms.php Paper models of prisms and antiprisms]\n\n{{Polyhedron navigator}}\n\n[[Category:Uniform polyhedra]]\n[[Category:Prismatoid polyhedra]]"

As this crossed pentagonal cuploid thus shares all its edges with this polyhedron, it may be termed an ''edge-[[faceting]]'' of it.

Rotating one of the cupolae in this construction results in the [[pseudo-great rhombicuboctahedron]].

By analogy, it relates to a [[parallelogram]] just as a [[cube]] relates to a [[square]] or as a [[cuboid]] to a [[rectangle]]. In [[Euclidean geometry]], its definition encompasses all four concepts (i.e., ''parallelepiped'', ''parallelogram'', ''cube'', and  ''square''). In this context of [[affine geometry]], in which angles are not differentiated, its definition admits only ''parallelograms'' and ''parallelepipeds''.  Three equivalent definitions of ''parallelepiped'' are\n*a [[polyhedron]] with six faces ([[hexahedron]]), each of which is a parallelogram,\n*a hexahedron with three pairs of parallel faces, and\n*a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] of which the base is a [[parallelogram]].\nThe rectangular [[cuboid]] (six [[rectangular]] faces), [[cube]] (six [[square]] faces), and the [[rhombohedron]] (six [[rhombus]] faces) are all specific cases of parallelepiped.\n\n\"Parallelepiped\" is now usually pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|l|ɛ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|p|ɪ|p|ɛ|d}}, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|l|ɛ|l|ᵻ|ˈ|p|aɪ|p|ɛ|d}}, or {{IPAc-en|-|p|ᵻ|d}}; traditionally it was {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ær|ə|l|ɛ|l|ˈ|ɛ|p|ᵻ|p|ɛ|d}} {{respell|PARR|ə-lel|EP|i-ped}}<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'' 1904; ''Webster's Second International'' 1947</ref> in accordance with its etymology in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παραλληλ-επίπεδον, a body \"having parallel planes\".\n\nParallelepipeds are a subclass of the [[prismatoid]]s.\n\n==Properties==\nAny of the three pairs of parallel faces can be viewed as the base planes of the prism. A parallelepiped has three sets of four parallel edges; the edges within each set are of equal length.\n\nParallelepipeds result from [[linear transformation]]s of a [[cube]] (for the non-degenerate cases: the bijective linear transformations).\n\nSince each face has [[point symmetry]], a parallelepiped is a [[zonohedron]]. Also the whole parallelepiped has point symmetry ''C<sub>i</sub>'' (see also [[triclinic]]). Each face is, seen from the outside, the mirror image of the opposite face. The faces are in general [[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]], but the parallelepiped is not.\n\nA [[Honeycomb (geometry)|space-filling tessellation]] is possible with [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] copies of any parallelepiped.\n\n==Volume==\n[[File:Parallelepiped-v.svg|thumb|300px|Parallelepiped, generated by three vectors]]\nA parallelepiped can be considered as an [[Oblique Prism|oblique prism]] with a [[parallelogram]] as base.\nHence the volume <math>V</math> of a parallelepiped is  the product of the base area <math>B</math> and the height <math>h</math> (see diagram).

In 2009, dozens of perfect parallelepipeds were shown to exist,<ref>{{Cite journal|first1=Jorge F.|last1=Sawyer|first2=Clifford A.|last2=Reiter|year=2011|title=Perfect Parallelepipeds Exist|journal=[[Mathematics of Computation]]|volume=80|pages=1037–1040|arxiv=0907.0220|doi=10.1090/s0025-5718-2010-02400-7}}.</ref>  answering an open question of [[Richard K. Guy|Richard Guy]]. One example has edges 271, 106, and 103, minor face diagonals 101, 266, and 255, major face diagonals 183, 312, and 323, and space diagonals 374, 300, 278, and 272. \n\nSome perfect parallelopipeds having two rectangular faces are known. But it is not known whether there exist any with all faces rectangular; such a case would be called a perfect [[cuboid]].\n\n== Parallelotope<!--'Parallelotope' redirects here--> ==\n\n[[Coxeter]] called the generalization of a parallelepiped in higher dimensions a '''parallelotope'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.\n\nSpecifically in ''n''-dimensional space it is called ''n''-dimensional parallelotope, or simply ''n''-parallelotope. Thus a [[parallelogram]] is a 2-parallelotope and a parallelepiped is a 3-parallelotope.\n\nMore generally a parallelotope,<ref>[https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0307170.pdf Properties of parallelotopes equivalent to Voronoi's conjecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180209164354/https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0307170.pdf |date=2018-02-09 }}</ref> or ''voronoi parallelotope'', has parallel and congruent opposite facets. So a 2-parallelotope is a [[parallelogon]] which can also include certain hexagons, and a 3-parallelotope is a [[parallelohedron]], including 5 types of polyhedra.\n\nThe [[diagonals]] of an ''n''-parallelotope intersect at one point and are bisected by this point. [[Inversion in a point|Inversion]] in this point leaves the ''n''-parallelotope unchanged. See also [[fixed points of isometry groups in Euclidean space]].\n\nThe edges radiating from one vertex of a ''k''-parallelotope form a [[k-frame|''k''-frame]] <math>(v_1,\\ldots, v_n)</math> of the vector space, and the parallelotope can be recovered from these vectors, by taking linear combinations of the vectors, with weights between 0 and 1.\n\nThe ''n''-volume of an ''n''-parallelotope embedded in <math>\\mathbb{R}^m</math> where <math>m \\ge n</math> can be computed by means of the [[Gram determinant]]. Alternatively, the volume is the norm of the [[exterior product]] of the vectors:\n:<math> V = \\left\\| v_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge v_n \\right\\| .</math>\n\nIf ''m'' = ''n'', this amounts to the absolute value of the determinant of the ''n'' vectors.\n\nAnother formula to compute the volume of an ''n''-parallelotope ''P'' in <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, whose {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} vertices are <math>V_0,V_1, \\ldots, V_n</math>, is \n:<math> {\\rm Vol}(P) = |{\\rm det}\\ ([V_0\\ 1]^{\\rm T}, [V_1\\ 1]^{\\rm T}, \\ldots, [V_n\\ 1]^{\\rm T})|,</math> \n\nwhere <math>[V_i\\ 1]</math> is the row vector formed by the concatenation of <math>V_i</math> and 1. Indeed, the determinant is unchanged if <math>[V_0\\ 1]</math> is subtracted from <math>[V_i\\ 1]</math> ({{nowrap|''i'' > 0}}), and placing <math>[V_0\\ 1]</math> in the last position only changes its sign.       \n\nSimilarly, the volume of any ''n''-[[simplex]] that shares ''n'' converging edges of a parallelotope has a volume equal to one 1/[[factorial|''n''!]] of the volume of that parallelotope.\n\n== Lexicography ==\nThe word appears as ''parallelipipedon'' in [[Henry Billingsley|Sir Henry Billingsley's]] translation of [[Euclid's Elements]], dated 1570.  In the 1644 edition of his ''Cursus mathematicus'', [[Pierre Hérigone]] used the spelling ''parallelepipedum''.  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites the present-day ''parallelepiped'' as first appearing in [[Walter Charleton|Walter Charleton's]] ''Chorea gigantum'' (1663).\n\n[[Charles Hutton|Charles Hutton's]] Dictionary (1795) shows ''parallelopiped'' and ''parallelopipedon'', showing the influence of the combining form ''parallelo-'', as if the second element were ''pipedon'' rather than ''epipedon''. [[Noah Webster]] (1806) includes the spelling ''parallelopiped''.  The 1989 edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' describes ''parallelopiped'' (and ''parallelipiped'') explicitly as incorrect forms, but these are listed without comment in the 2004 edition, and only pronunciations with the emphasis on the fifth syllable ''pi'' ({{IPA|/paɪ/}}) are given.\n\nA change away from the traditional pronunciation has hidden the different partition suggested by the Greek roots, with ''epi-'' (\"on\") and ''pedon'' (\"ground\") combining to give ''epiped'', a flat \"plane\". Thus the faces of a parallelepiped are planar, with opposite faces being parallel.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Coxeter, H. S. M. ''[[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]'', 3rd ed. New York: Dover, p.&nbsp;122, 1973.

It consists of two [[pentagon]]s joined to each other by a ring of 10 [[triangle]]s for a total of 12 faces. Hence, it is a non-regular [[dodecahedron]].\n\n== Geometry ==\n\nIf the faces of the pentagonal antiprism are all regular, it is a [[semiregular polyhedron]]. It can also be considered as a '''parabidiminished [[icosahedron]]''', a shape formed by removing two [[pentagonal pyramid]]s from a [[regular icosahedron]] leaving two nonadjacent pentagonal faces; a related shape, the [[metabidiminished icosahedron]] (one of the [[Johnson solid]]s), is likewise form from the icosahedron by removing two pyramids, but its pentagonal faces are adjacent to each other. The two pentagonal faces of either shape can be augmented with pyramids to form the icosahedron.\n\n=== Relation to polytopes ===\n\nThe pentagonal antiprism occurs as a constituent element in some higher-dimensional [[polytope]]s.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}\n{{Prism polyhedra db|Prism star polyhedron stat table|AP5d3}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''pentagrammic crossed-antiprism''' is one in an infinite set of nonconvex [[antiprisms]] formed by triangle sides and two regular [[star polygon]] caps, in this case two [[pentagram]]s.\n\nIt differs from the [[pentagrammic antiprism]] by having opposite orientations on the two pentagrams.\n\nThis polyhedron is identified with the indexed name U<sub>80</sub> as a [[uniform polyhedron]].\n{|\n|[[Image:Pentagrammic crossed-antiprism.png|200px]]<BR>An alternative representation with hollow pentagrams.\n|}\n\nThe pentagrammic crossed-antiprism may be inscribed within an [[icosahedron]], and has ten triangular faces in common with the [[great icosahedron]]. It has the same [[vertex arrangement]] as the [[pentagonal antiprism]]. In fact, it may be considered as a '''parabidiminished great icosahedron'''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- align=center\n| [[File:Pentagrammic crossed antiprism.png|200px]]<BR>Pentagrammic crossed-antiprism\n| [[File:Dihedral gike.png|200px]]<BR>[[Great icosahedron]] coloured with ''D''<sub>5d</sub> symmetry\n|}\n\n\n== See also==\n* [[Prismatic uniform polyhedron]]\n\n== External links ==\n*{{MathWorld |urlname=PentagrammicCrossedAntiprism |title=Pentagrammic crossed antiprism}}\n*http://www.mathconsult.ch/showroom/unipoly/80.html\n* http://bulatov.org/polyhedra/uniform/u05.html\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20050313234519/http://www.math.technion.ac.il/~rl/kaleido/data/05.html\n\n[[Category:Prismatoid polyhedra]]\n\n{{Polyhedron-stub}}"

      "text": "{{Infobox polyhedron\n|image=pentagrammic_cuploid.png\n|type=[[cupola|Cuploid]]\n|faces=5 [[triangle]]s<br>5 [[Square (geometry)|squares]]<br>1 [[pentagram]]\n|edges=20\n|vertices=10\n|symmetry=''C''<sub>5v</sub>, [5], (*55)\n|rotation_group=''C''<sub>5</sub>, [5]<sup>+</sup>, (55)\n|vertex_config=5(5/2.4.3.4)<br>5(3.4.3/2.4/3)\n|dual=pentagrammic keratinoid\n|properties=non-orientable<br>has a membrane\n}}\nIn [[geometry]], the '''pentagrammic cupoloid''' or '''pentagrammmic semicupola''' is the simplest of the infinite family of [[cuploid]]s. It can be obtained as a slice of the [[small complex rhombicosidodecahedron]]. As in all [[cupola (geometry)|cupolae]], the base [[polygon]] has twice as many [[edge (geometry)|edges]] and [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] as the top; but in this case the base polygon is a degenerate {10/2} [[decagram (geometry)|decagram]], as the top is a {5/2} [[pentagram]]. Hence, the degenerate base is withdrawn and the triangles are connected to the squares instead.\n\n== Related polyhedra ==\n{{Star-cupoloids}}\nThe pentagrammic cuploid may be seen as a section of the degenerate uniform polyhedron known as the [[small complex rhombicosidodecahedron]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| [[File:Pentagrammic cuploid.png|100px]]<BR>Pentagrammic cuploid\n| [[File:Cantellated great icosahedron.png|100px]]<BR>[[Small complex rhombicosidodecahedron]]\n|- align=center\n| [[File:Small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron.png|100px]]<BR>[[Small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron]]\n| [[File:Ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron.png|100px]]<br>[[Ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron]]\n| [[File:Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron.png|100px]]<BR>[[Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron]]\n| [[File:Compound of five cubes.png|100px]]<BR>[[Compound of five cubes]]\n|}\n\n(In the picture of the pentagrammic cuploid, the pentagram is red, the squares yellow, and the triangles blue. In the picture of the small complex rhombicosidodecahedron, the pentagrams are pink, the squares red, and the triangles yellow. The centres of the pentagrams have been removed as otherwise the red squares of the small complex rhombicosidodecahedron would be invisible.)\n\nTaking one pentagram from the small complex rhombicosidodecahedron, then taking the five squares that neighbour it, then taking the five triangles that border these squares results in a pentagrammic cuploid. As this pentagrammic cuploid thus shares all its edges with this polyhedron, it may be termed an ''edge-[[faceting]]'' of it. The nondegenerate uniform polyhedra sharing the same edges as the small complex rhombicosidodecahedron are the three [[ditrigonal polyhedra]], as well as the regular [[compound of five cubes]]: hence the pentagrammic cuploid is also an edge-faceting of these polyhedra.\n\nAs 5/2 > 2, the triangles and squares do not fully cover the bottom of the pentagrammic cuploid, and hence the centre of the pentagrammic base is accessible from both sides and covers no space. Hence it is a membrane and has not been filled in<!--not a mistake--> in the above illustration of the polyhedron, as filling it in would imply that the [[density (polytope)|densities]] on either of the pentagram are different, when they are both 0. It has been conjectured that a polyhedron with 10 faces or less cannot have a membrane: the pentagrammic cuploid has 11 faces.\n\n== Dual polyhedron ==\nThe dual of the pentagrammic cuploid has 5 kite and 5 [[antiparallelogram]] faces, and has been called the ''pentagrammic keratinoid'' by Inchbald, due to it being shaped like a hollow horn:\n\n[[File:Pentagrammic keratinoid.png|240px]]\n\n== References ==\n* Guy Inchbald, [http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/filling/filling.htm Filling polytopes]\n* Richard Klitzing, [http://bendwavy.org/klitzing/pdf/edge-facetings_color.pdf Axial-Symmetrical Edge Facetings of Uniform Polyhedra]\n* Richard Klitzing, [http://www.polyedergarten.de/polyhedrix/e_klintro.htm Facetings of uniform polyhedra] (hosted and presented by Ulrich Mikloweit)\n* Jim McNeill, [http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/cupolas/52cuploid.html The 5/2 semicupola and 5/4 semicupola]\n* Jim McNeill, [http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/cupolas/cupola2.html Semicupolas]\n\n[[Category:Prismatoid polyhedra]]"
