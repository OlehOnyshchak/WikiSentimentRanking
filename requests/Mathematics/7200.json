It was suggested by [[Rob Stegmann]],<ref name=TwistyPuzzles /> invented by [[Oskar van Deventer]],<ref name=TwistyPuzzles /><ref name=video>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bu0QzmmvCY Rob's Pyraminx - YouTube]</ref> and has now been mass-produced by [[Uwe Mèffert|Meffert's]].<ref name=TwistyPuzzles /><ref>[http://www.mefferts.com/products../details.php?lang=en&category=13&id=1035 Pyraminx Duo Black] - Meffert's</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Pyraminx Duo 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Pyraminx Duo in the middle of a twist, showing how the puzzle can be scrambled.]]\nThe Pyraminx Duo is a puzzle in the shape of a tetrahedron, divided into 4 corner pieces and 4 face centre pieces. Each corner piece has three colours, while the centre pieces each have a single colour. Each face of the puzzle contains one face centre piece and three corner pieces.\n\nThe puzzle can be thought of as twisting around its corner pieces - each twist rotates one corner piece and permutates the three face centre pieces around it. An interesting feature is that the face centre pieces go \"underneath\" corner pieces during a twist.\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colours, and then restore them to their original configuration of one colour per face.\n\nMechanically, the puzzle is similar to the [[Skewb]], with all corner pieces of the Skewb visible (although shaped differently) and all centre pieces hidden.\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThere are 4 corner pieces. Each corner can be twisted in 3 different orientations, independently of the other corners. Therefore, the corners can be orientated in 3<sup>4</sup> different ways. They cannot be permutated, therefore there is only one possible corner permutation.\n\nThere are 4 face centre pieces. These can be permutated in at most 4[[factorial|!]] different ways. However, the exact number of these permutations is not yet reached due to two constraints. The first constraint is that only even permutations of the face centers are possible (e.g. it is impossible to have only two face centre pieces swapped); this divides the limit by 2. The second constraint is that all centre permutations are dependent on the orientation of the corner pieces. Some permutations of centres are only possible when the total number of ''clockwise'' rotations of corner pieces is divisible by 3; other permutations are only possible when the total number of ''clockwise'' rotations is equivalent to 1 modulo 3; others are only possible when the number is equivalent to 2 modulo 3. This divides the limit by 3.\n\nThe face centre pieces have no obvious orientation, therefore this does not affect the total number of combinations.\n\nThe full number is therefore:<ref name=jaap>[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyraduo.htm Pyraminx Duo] - Jaap's Puzzle Page</ref>\n\n:<math>\\frac{3^{4} \\times 4!}{2 \\times 3} = 324</math>\n\nThis number, in relative terms, is extremely low compared to other puzzles like the [[Rubik's Cube]] (which has over 43 quintillion combinations), the [[Pocket Cube]] (with over 3.6 million combinations), or even the [[Pyraminx]] (with just over 930 thousand combinations, excluding rotations of the [[Pyraminx#Description|trivial tips]]).\n\n==Optimal solutions==\n[[File:Pyraminx Duo 3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Pyraminx Duo, scrambled.]]\nAs explained above, the total number of possible configurations of the Pyraminx Duo is 324, which is sufficiently small to allow a computer search for optimal solutions. The table below summarises the result of such a search, stating the number ''p'' of positions that require ''n'' twists to solve the Pyraminx Duo:<ref name=jaap />\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! ''n''\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || '''Total'''\n|- align=\"center\"\n! ''p''\n| 1 || 8 || 48 || 188 || 79 || '''324'''\n|}\n</center>\n\nThe above table shows that the [[God's algorithm|God's Number]] of the Pyraminx Duo is 4 (i.e. the puzzle is always at most 4 twists away from its solved state). Similarly to the total number of combinations, this number is very low compared to the Rubik's Cube (20), the Pocket Cube (11) or the Pyraminx (11, excluding the trivial tips).\n\n==Solving==\nDue to its substantially low number of combinations and its low God's Number, the Pyraminx Duo is a relatively easy puzzle to solve; it has been described as \"arguably the easiest non-trivial twisty puzzle\".<ref name=video /> Because of this, cubers usually come up with their own methods of solving the puzzle. For an extra challenge, it is also not uncommon for cubers to invent their own \"optimal\" methods - i.e. methods that guarantee to solve the puzzle in no more than 4 moves.\n\n==Variations==\nThere are several variations of the Pyraminx Duo that have been invented. These variations all look the same as the original puzzle but use different colour schemes; usually these colour schemes make the orientations of the face centre pieces visible, which makes the puzzle slightly more challenging.<ref name=jaap />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Pyraminx]]\n* [[Skewb]]\n* [[Skewb Diamond]]\n* [[Skewb Ultimate]]\n* [[Dino Cube]]\n* [[Pyramorphix]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Puzzles]]"

      "text": "[[Image:Pyramorphix.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Pyramorphix in its solved state.]]\n[[Image:Pyramorphix-scrambled.jpg|thumb|right|The Pyramorphix, scrambled.]]\n\nThe '''Pyramorphix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɪ|r|ə|ˈ|m|ɔr|f|ɪ|k|s}}, often misspelled ''Pyramorphinx'') is a [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] puzzle similar to the [[Rubik's Cube]]. It has a total of 8 movable pieces to rearrange, compared to the 20 of the Rubik's Cube. Though it looks like a simpler version of the [[Pyraminx]], it is an edge-turning puzzle with the mechanism identical to that of the [[Pocket Cube]].\n\n==Description==\n\nAt first glance, the Pyramorphix appears to be a trivial puzzle. It resembles the Pyraminx, and its appearance would suggest that only the four corners could be rotated. In fact, the puzzle is a specially shaped [[Pocket Cube|2×2×2 cube]]. Four of the cube's corners are reshaped into pyramids and the other four are reshaped into triangles. The result of this is a puzzle that changes shape as it is turned.\n\nThe original name for the Pyramorphix was \"The Junior Pyraminx.\" This was altered to reflect the \"Shape Changing\" aspect of the puzzle which makes it appear less like the 2×2×2 Cube. \"Junior\" also made it sound less desirable to an adult customer. The only remaining reference to the name \"Junior Pyraminx\" is on [[Uwe Mèffert]]'s website-based solution which still has the title \"jpmsol.html\".<ref>http://www.mefferts.com/puzzles/jpmsol.html</ref><ref>http://www.angelfire.com/trek/andysuth/d.html</ref>\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors and the shape, and then restore it to its original state of being a tetrahedron with one color per face.\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThe puzzle is available either with stickers or plastic tiles on the faces. Both have a ribbed appearance, giving a visible orientation to the flat pieces. This results in 3,674,160 combinations, the same as the 2×2×2 cube.\n\nHowever, if there were no means of identifying the orientation of those pieces, the number of combinations would be reduced. There would be 8! ways to arrange the pieces, divided by 24 to account for the lack of center pieces, and there would be 3<sup>4</sup> ways to rotate the four pyramidal pieces.\n\n:<math>\\frac{8! \\times 3^4}{24}=136080</math>\n\nThe Pyramorphix can be rotated around three axes by multiples of 90°. The corners cannot rotate individually as on the Pyraminx. The Pyramorphix rotates in a way that changes the position of center pieces not only with other center pieces but also with corner pieces, leading to a variety of shapes.\n\n== Master Pyramorphix ==\n\n[[Image:Master Pyramorphix solved.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Master Pyramorphix]]\n[[Image:Master Pyramorphix color scrambled.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Master Pyramorphix, color-scrambled]]\n[[Image:Master Pyramorphix scrambled.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Master Pyramorphix, color- and shape- scrambled]]\n[[Image:Master Pyramorphix partially solved.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Master Pyramorphix, partially solved]]\n[[Image:Master Pyramorphix maxflip.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The Master Pyramorphix, with maximal face-piece flip, equivalent to the \"superflip\" configuration of the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube]]\n\nThe '''Master Pyramorphix''', informally referred to the Mastermorphix, is a more complex variant of the Pyramorphix. Like the Pyramorphix, it is an edge-turning tetrahedral puzzle capable of changing shape as it is twisted, leading to a large variety of irregular shapes. Several different variants have been made, including flat-faced custom-built puzzles by puzzle fans and [[Uwe Mèffert]]'s commercially produced pillowed variant (pictured), sold through his puzzle shop, Meffert's.\n\nThe puzzle consists of 4 corner pieces, 4 face centers, 6 edge pieces, and 12 non-center face pieces. Being an edge-turning puzzle, the edge pieces only rotate in place, while the rest of the pieces can be permuted. The face centers and corner pieces are interchangeable because they are both corners although they are shaped differently, and the non-center face pieces may be flipped, leading to a wide variety of exotic shapes as the puzzle is twisted. If only 180° turns are made, it is possible to scramble only the colors while retaining the puzzle's tetrahedral shape. When 90° and 180° turns are made this puzzle can \"shape shift″.\n\nIn spite of superficial similarities, the only way that this puzzle is related to the [[Pyraminx]] is that they are both \"twisty puzzles\"; the Pyraminx is a face-turning puzzle. On the Mastermorphix the corner pieces are non-trivial; they cannot be simply rotated in place to the right orientation.\n\n===Solutions===\n\nDespite its appearance, the puzzle is in fact equivalent to a shape modification of the original 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube. Its 4 corner pieces on the corners and 4 corner pieces on the face centers together are equivalent to the 8 corner pieces of the Rubik's Cube, its 6 edge pieces are equivalent to the face centers of the Rubik's Cube, and its non-center face pieces are equivalent to the edge pieces of the Rubik's Cube. Thus, the same methods used to solve the Rubik's Cube may be used to solve the Master Pyramorphix, with a few minor differences: the center pieces are sensitive to orientation because they have two colors, unlike the usual coloring scheme used for the Rubik's Cube, and the face centers are ''not'' sensitive to orientation (however when in the \"wrong\" orientation parity errors may occur). In effect, it behaves as a Rubik's Cube with a non-standard coloring scheme where center piece orientation matters, and the orientation of 4 of the 8 corner pieces do not, technically, matter.\n\nUnlike the [[Square One (puzzle)|Square One]], another shape-changing puzzle, the most straightforward solutions of the Master Pyramorphix do not involve first restoring the tetrahedral shape of the puzzle and then restoring the colors; most of the [[Rubik's Cube#Algorithms|algorithms]] carried over from the 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube translate to shape-changing permutations of the Master Pyramorphix. Some methods, such as the equivalent of Philip Marshall's \"Ultimate Solution\", show a gradual progression in shape as the solution progresses; first the non-center face pieces are put into place, resulting in a partial restoration of the tetrahedral shape except at the face centers and corners, and then the complete restoration of tetrahedral shape as the face centers and corners are solved.\n\n===Number of combinations===\nThere are four corners and four face centers. These may be interchanged with each other in 8! different ways. There are 3<sup>7</sup> ways for these pieces to be oriented, since the orientation of the last piece depends on the preceding seven, and the texture of the stickers makes the face center orientation visible. There are twelve non-central face pieces. These can be flipped in 2<sup>11</sup> ways and there are 12!/2 ways to arrange them. The three pieces of a given color are distinguishable due to the texture of the stickers. There are six edge pieces which are fixed in position relative to one another, each of which has four possible orientations. If the puzzle is solved apart from these pieces, the number of edge twists will always be even, making 4<sup>6</sup>/2 possibilities for these pieces.\n:<math>  {8! \\times 3^7 \\times 12! \\times 2^9 \\times 4^6} \\approx 8.86 \\times 10^{22}</math>\n\nThe full number is {{val|88580102706155225088000}}.\n\nHowever, if the stickers were smooth the number of combinations would be reduced. There would be 3<sup>4</sup> ways for the corners to be oriented, but the face centers would not have visible orientations. The three non-central face pieces of a given color would be indistinguishable. Since there are six ways to arrange the three pieces of the same color and there are four colors, there would be 2<sup>11</sup>×12!/6<sup>4</sup> possibilities for these pieces.\n:<math> \\frac {8! \\times 3^4 \\times 12! \\times 2^{10} \\times 4^6}{6^4} \\approx 5.06 \\times 10^{18}</math>\n\nThe full number is {{val|5062877383753728000}}.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Skewb Ultimate]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/pyramorf.htm Jaap's Pyramorphix page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100723111931/http://www.mud.ca/puzzler/JPuzzler/JPuzzler.html A Java applet which includes the Pyramorphix]\n*[http://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Master_Pyramorphix Speedsolving.com Wiki - Solution (Master Pyramorphix)]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

Other cuboids of 2×2×n (if n is an even number) will solve like multiple [[dominoes]] at once. When only using pairs of turns, the puzzle may be solved similarly to a 3x3.

It has 14 movable pieces which can be rearranged in a total of 138,240 possible combinations. This puzzle is the [[dual polyhedron]] of the [[Skewb]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe Skewb Diamond has 6 octahedral corner pieces and 8 triangular face centers. All pieces can move relative to each other. It is a ''deep-cut'' puzzle; its [[Plane of rotation|planes of rotation]] bisect it.\n\nIt is very closely related to the [[Skewb]], and shares the same piece count and mechanism. However, the triangular \"corners\" present on the Skewb have no visible orientation on the Skewb Diamond, and the square \"centers\" gain a visible orientation on the Skewb Diamond. In other words, the corners on the Skewb are equivalent to the centers on the Skewb diamond. Combining pieces from the two can either give you an unscrambleable [[cuboctahedron]] or a [[compound of cube and octahedron]] with visible orientation on all pieces.\n\n== Number of combinations ==\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble its colors, and then restore it to its original solved state.\n\nThe puzzle has 6 corner pieces and 8 face centers. The positions of four of the face centers is completely determined by the positions of the other 4 face centers, and only even permutations of such positions are possible, so the number of arrangements of face centers is only 4!/2. Each face center has only a single orientation.\n\nOnly even permutations of the corner pieces are possible, so the number of possible arrangements of corner pieces is 6!/2. Each corner has two possible orientations (it is not possible to change their orientation by 90° without disassembling the puzzle), but the orientation of the last corner is determined by the other 5. Hence, the number of possible corner orientations is 2<sup>5</sup>.\n\nHence, the number of possible combinations is:\n\n:<math> \\frac{4!\\times 6!\\times 2^5}{4} = 138,240.</math>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Pyraminx]]\n*[[Megaminx]]\n*[[Skewb]]\n*[[Skewb Ultimate]]\n*[[Dino Cube]]\n*[[Dogic]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/diamond.htm Jaap's Skewb Diamond page]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n{{toy-stub}}\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]"

      "text": "{{unreferenced|date=April 2019}}\n[[Image:Skewb ultimate.jpg|thumb|Meffert's version of the 6-color Skewb Ultimate.]]\n\nThe '''Skewb Ultimate''', originally marketed as ''Pyraminx Ball'' is a twelve-sided puzzle derivation of the [[Skewb]], produced by famous toy-maker [[Uwe Meffert]]. Most versions of this puzzle are sold with six different colors of stickers attached, with opposite sides of the puzzle having the same color; however, some early versions of the puzzle have a full set of 12 colors.\n\n==Description==\nThe Skewb Ultimate is made in the shape of a dodecahedron, like the [[Megaminx]], but cut differently. Each face is cut into 4 parts, two equal and two unequal. Each cut is a deep cut: it bisects the puzzle. This results in 8 smaller corner pieces and 6 larger \"edge\" pieces.\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to the original configuration.\n\n==Solutions==\nAt first glance, the Skewb Ultimate appears to be much more difficult to solve than the other Skewb puzzles, because of its uneven cuts which cause the pieces to move in a way that may seem irregular or strange.\n\nMathematically speaking, however, the Skewb Ultimate has exactly the same structure as the [[Skewb Diamond]]. The solution for the [[Skewb Diamond]] can be used to solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's face pieces with the Ultimate's corner pieces, and the Diamond's corner pieces with the Ultimate's edge pieces. The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's corner pieces (equivalent to the Diamond's face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed.\n\nSimilarly, the Skewb Ultimate is mathematically identical to the [[Skewb]], by identifying corners with corners, and the Skewb's face centers with the Ultimate's edges. The solution of the Skewb can be used directly to solve the Skewb Ultimate. The only addition is that the edge pieces of the Skewb Ultimate are sensitive to orientation, and may require an additional algorithm to orient them after being placed correctly.\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThe Skewb Ultimate has 6 large \"edge\" pieces and 8 smaller corner pieces. Only even permutations of the larger pieces are possible, giving 6!/2 possible arrangements. Each of them has two possible orientations, although the orientation of the last piece is determined by the orientations of the other pieces, hence giving us a total of 2<sup>5</sup> possible orientations.\n\nThe positions of four of the smaller corner pieces depend on the positions of the other 4 corner pieces, and only even permutations of these positions are possible. Hence the number of arrangements of corner pieces is 4!/2. Each corner piece has 3 possible orientations, although the orientation of the last corner is determined by the orientations of the other corners, so the number of possible corner orientations is 3<sup>7</sup>. However, the orientations of 4 of the corners plus the position of one of the other corners determines the positions of the remaining 3, so the total number of possible combinations of corners is only <math>\\frac{4!\\times 3^6}{2}</math>.\n\nTherefore, the number of possible combinations is:\n\n:<math>\\frac{6!\\times 2^5\\times 4!\\times 3^6}{4} = 100,776,960.</math>\n\n\n[[Image:Rhombus_Skewb.jpg|thumb|[[Rhombic dodecahedron]] version of the puzzle with equivalent mechanism.]]\n==See also==\n*[[Skewb]]\n*[[Skewb Diamond]]\n*[[Combination puzzles]]\n*[[Mechanical puzzles]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/ultimate.htm Jaap's Skewb Ultimate page]\n*[http://www.twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=656 Twisty Puzzles Skewb Ultimate]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Mechanical puzzles]]\n[[Category:Combination puzzles]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube permutations]]"

It was invented by [[Lee Tutt]] in 2005.<ref>[http://twistypuzzles.com/cgi-bin/puzzle.cgi?pkey=1557 Twisty Puzzles: Tuttminx, 2005]</ref> It has a total of 150 movable pieces to rearrange, compared to 20 movable pieces of the Rubik’s Cube.\n\n==Description==\nThe Tuttminx has a total of 32 face centre pieces (12 pentagon and 20 hexagon), 60 corner pieces and 90 edge pieces. The face centres each have a single colour, which identifies the colour of that face in the solved state. The edge pieces have two colours and the corner pieces have three colours. Each hexagonal face contains a centre piece, 6 corner pieces and 6 edge pieces, while each pentagonal face contains a centre piece, 5 corner pieces and 5 edge pieces.\n\nThe puzzle twists around the faces: each twist rotates one face centre piece and moves all edge and corner pieces surrounding it. The pentagonal faces can be twisted 72° in either direction, while the hexagonal faces can be rotated 120°.\n\nThe purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colours, and then restore it to its original state of having one colour per face.\n\n==Number of combinations==\nThe puzzle has 150 movable pieces: 60 corner pieces, 60 edge pieces that are adjacent to a pentagonal face (so-called pentagonal edges) and 30 edge pieces that are not (non-pentagonal edges). Only even permutations of all three types of pieces are possible (i.e. it is impossible to have only one pair of identical pieces swapped). Thus, there are 60!/2 possible ways to arrange the corner pieces, 60!/2 ways to arrange the pentagonal edges and 30!/2 ways to arrange the non-pentagonal edges.\n\nAll corner pieces have only one possible orientation, as do all pentagonal edge pieces. The non-pentagonal edge pieces all have 2 possible orientations each. Only even orientations of those are possible (meaning that it is impossible to have only one edge piece flipped over). This means there are 2<sup>29</sup> ways to orientate the edge pieces.\n\nThe number of possible combinations on the Tuttminx is therefore equal to\n\n:<math>\\frac{60! \\times 60! \\times 30! \\times 2^{29}}{8} \\approx 1.2325 \\times 10^{204}</math>\nThe full number is 1 232 507 756 161 568 013 733 174 639 895 750 813 761 087 074 840 896 182 396 140 424 396 146 760 158 229 902 239 889 099 665 575 990 049 299 860 175 851 176 152 712 039 950 335 697 389 221 704 074 672 278 055 758 253 470 515 200 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (about 1.2325 septensexagintillion on the [[Names of large numbers|short scale]] and 1.2325 quattuortrigintillion on the long scale).\n\n==Variations==\nThere are a few variations of the Tuttminx that have been made.

He graduated from [[Kearny High School (New Jersey)|Kearny High School]] in 2003. He studied mathematics at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] and graduated in May 2007. He rowed for the Rutgers Lightweight [[Sport rowing|Crew]] team and was the president and founder of the Rutgers University Rubik's Cube Club.<ref>https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Rutgers_Cube_Club</ref> On March 14, 2015 at 9:26:53 a.m., Bob married Jaclyn Sawler in the Beyond Rubik’s Cube exhibit at Liberty Science Center.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/fashion/weddings/starting-a-life-together-with-pi.html</ref> He currently teaches high school mathematics in New York City.\n\n==Rubik's Cube==\n===3×3×3 Cube Speedsolving===\nBurton began speedsolving with the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube in May 2001.  He was first challenged by some of his friends in an informal competition to see who could solve one side the fastest and was consistently the last to finish, so he bought a Rubik's Cube and began to practice with it.  He was able to solve the cube in under a minute within a few months using a simple layer by layer method.  He competed in the 2003 Rubik's World Games Championships.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://media.www.dailytargum.com/media/storage/paper168/news/2005/01/21/PageOne/Rutgers.Rubiks.Cube.Whiz.Competes-837443.shtml# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-08-23 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070823013309/http://media.www.dailytargum.com/media/storage/paper168/news/2005/01/21/PageOne/Rutgers.Rubiks.Cube.Whiz.Competes-837443.shtml# |archive-date=2007-08-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Rubik's Magic===\nBurton was one of the pioneers of solving the Rubik's Magic in the United States.  After learning how to solve the puzzle, he insisted on it being an official event in competitions. Ian Winokur allowed a Rubik's Magic competition at the Horace Mann Spring 2005 tournament, in which Burton broke the American record for single solve (1.56 seconds) and average of five (1.85 seconds).<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/HoraceMann2005</ref> In his next competition, Burton also insisted on allowing the Rubik's Master Magic to be an event.  [[Tyson Mao]] agreed, so in the Caltech Summer 2005 tournament, Burton set the single solve world record for the Rubik's Magic (1.28 seconds) and the single solve (3.05 seconds) and average of five (3.54 seconds) world records for the Rubik's Master Magic.<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/CaltechDallas2005</ref>  At the Trumbull Spring 2006 tournament, Burton also broke the world record for Rubik's Magic average (1.40 seconds).<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/Trumbull2006</ref> He was the national champion in 2006 for the Rubik's Magic and the Rubik's Master Magic.<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2003BURT01?tab=records</ref>\n\n===Rubik's Clock===\nAt the 2005 Dutch Open Championship, Burton set the American record for the [[Rubik's Clock]] for single solve (24.12 seconds) and mean (32.68 seconds).<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/DutchOpen2005</ref>\n\n===Other puzzles===\nBurton was the national champion at the 2006 US National Championships in San Francisco for the Square-1.<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2003BURT01?tab=championship-podiums</ref> He is also credited with creating a method for the Pyraminx, known as the “Bob Burton Method.”<ref>http://www.cubewhiz.com/pyraminx.php</ref>\n\n===One-handed cubing===\nBurton also practices the art of one-handed cubing, in which the competitor can use only one hand to solve the cube.  He was among the best in the world, placing 5th overall (of 61) in the first round of the 2005 Rubik's Cube World Championship.  Since then, he has dropped in the rankings, but competes in the one-handed contest nonetheless.<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2003BURT01?tab=results-by-event&event=333oh</ref>\n\n===Blindfolded cubing===\nIn May 2006, Burton successfully solved the Rubik's Cube blindfolded in an official competition at the Trumbull Spring 2006 tournament in a time of 6 minutes 21.87 seconds.  He had failed his first ten attempts before that, dating back to May of the previous year.  Burton uses the Pochmann system to solve a cube blindfolded, which solves one piece at a time.<ref>https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2003BURT01?tab=results-by-event&event=333bf</ref>\n\n===Official competition times===\nBurton's best official solves:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2003BURT01 |title=Bob Burton |publisher=World Cube Association |accessdate=30 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

Tyson is credited for popularizing the \"Caltech move\" for solving the three diagonal corner permutation in blindfold solving.\n\n===Competition Organizer===\nTyson has been the main organizer of major U.S competitions, including all US Nationals up to 2013, as well as many Caltech competitions.\n\n===Tyson Mao's beginner method===\nTyson Mao's unofficial beginner method is a set of 8 videos which can be viewed at [http://www.rubiks.com Rubiks.com]. This method is most famous for being used by [[Will Smith]] in a past film [[The Pursuit of Happyness]], that was released in 2006. The method is basically a simplified layer-by-layer approach which works much the same way as the Fridrich method. The difference is that the cross is first built around the opposite side to simplify the permutation foresight required, the first two layers are permuted individually, the last layer requires an algorithm to construct a cross, and then repetition of Lars Petrus' Sune algorithm to orient, and finally permutation requires the use of two algorithms, one for the corners and one for the edges. These algorithms may have to be executed multiple times.\n\n==Media appearances==\n*[[Beauty and the Geek]] Season 2\n*CNN's [[Anderson Cooper 360°]] (Air date: December 15, 2006)\n*[[Identity (game show)]]\n*[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]] (Air date: January 27, 2006)\n*[[Twins (TV series)]]\n*[[USA Network]]: Show Us Your Character\n*[[Good Morning America]] (Air date: February 4, 2008)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tbo.com/entertainment/tv/includes/MGB2UORTKIE.html Brain Trust Behind 'Beauty And The Geek' Says More Stereotype Breaking In Works, TBO.com]\n*[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/01/13/BAG3DGMRAV1.DTL  Brothers square off in cubing contest, San Francisco Chronicle]\n*[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2106065/ Tyson Mao], entry on The [[Internet Movie Database]]\n*[http://www.xanga.com/fiddletfm/ Tyson's Blog]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mao, Tyson}}\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:American people of Chinese descent]]\n[[Category:American people of Taiwanese descent]]\n[[Category:American speedcubers]]\n[[Category:California Institute of Technology alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Participants in American reality television series]]\n[[Category:People from San Francisco]]"

She is also known for documenting and popularizing the [[CFOP]] method (sometimes referred to as the \"Fridrich method\"), one of the most commonly used methods for speedsolving the [[Rubik's Cube]], also known as [[speedcubing]].<ref name=\"nytimes 2008\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/16/science/16prof.html?_r=1&em Specializing in Problems That Only Seem Impossible to Solve], By BINA VENKATARAMAN, Published: December 15, 2008, The New York Times</ref> She is considered as one of the pioneers of speedcubing, along with [[Lars Petrus]]. Nearly all of the fastest speedcubers have based their methods on Fridrich's, usually referred to as CFOP (Cross, First 2 Layers, Orient Last Layer, Permute Last Layer).\n\nThe method describes solving the cube in a layer-by-layer fashion. First a so-called \"cross\" is made on the first layer, consisting of the center piece and four edges. The first layer corners and edges of the second layer are put into their correct positions simultaneously (four pairs). The last layer is solved by first orienting and then permuting the last layer of the cube using a few sets of algorithms.\n\n==Professional life==\nJessica Fridrich works as a professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [[Binghamton University]] and specializes in digital watermarking and forensics.<ref name=\"hindawi 2002\">{{cite web | url=http://www.hindawi.com/65016052/ | title=Jessica Fridrich | publisher=[[Hindawi Publishing Corporation]] | date=February 14, 2002 | accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41RizWxlobQ Jessica Fridrich], Talk on Youtube</ref><ref>[http://www.hindawi.com/65016052.html Bio:Jessica Fridrich], Binghamton University</ref> She received her MS degree in applied mathematics from the [[Czech Technical University in Prague]] in 1987, and her PhD in systems science from Binghamton University in 1995.<ref name=\"hindawi 2002\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[CFOP Method]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/  Jessica Fridrich's webpage]\n* [http://www.ws.binghamton.edu/fridrich/cubewrld.html Rubik's Cube World Championship in Budapest in 1982]\n* [http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=1982FRID01 Rubik's Cube competition rankings]\n* [http://www.rubiks-cube.fr/jessica-fridrich/ Jessica Fridich : page en français]\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fridrich, Jessica}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Czech speedcubers]]\n[[Category:Czech emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Binghamton University faculty]]\n[[Category:State University of New York faculty]]\n[[Category:Electrical engineers]]\n[[Category:Women computer scientists]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]"

He helped create the current resurge of [[Rubik's Cube]] enthusiasm by co-founding the international speedcubing community and organizing international competitions. He is also a founder, delegate and former chairman of the [[World Cube Association]], an organization aiming at the spread of speedcubing as a regulated sport. He is also the host of the website speedcubing.com.\n\nIn 1999 the first modern age speedcubers found each other on internet via Rubik's Games, a computer game with an electronic version of Rubik's Cube. [[Chris Hardwick (speed cuber)|Chris Hardwick]] from Raleigh, NC founded a Yahoo Group Speedsolvingrubikscube and the Unofficial World Records, a place where cubers could post their personal records. Ron van Bruchem started speedcubing.com together with his friend Ton Dennenbroek, an avid puzzle collector. Because the first cubers were living all over the world they wanted to organize a competition where they could all meet. After failing in 2001, under guidance of Dan Gosbee they finally succeeded to organize World Championship 2003 in Toronto. This first modern age Rubik's Cube competition was a huge success, but there were lots of issues because of the lack of good regulations. After WC 2003 Ron van Bruchem and [[Tyson Mao]] started organizing competitions in The Netherlands/Germany and at Caltech University in USA. In 2004 they started the [[World Cube Association]] which nowadays organizes competitions in over 90 countries.\n\n==World records==\nRon van Bruchem has held official world records for solving the Rubik's Cube (9.55 seconds) set at the Dutch Nationals 2007 (lost 2008), the 5x5x5 cube in 2006 (1:47.22 min) set at Belgian Open 2006 (lost 2006), and 2x2x2 cube (2.65 seconds) set at UK Open 2007 (lost 2008).\nHe is currently the fastest Rubik's Cube solver over 30 years old, which title he won at the World Championship Rubik's Cube 2013 in [[Las Vegas]], NV, USA.\n\n==Personal life==\nRon van Bruchem was born in [[Hilversum]], The Netherlands.

In December 2016, Valk looked on as [[Feliks Zemdegs]] overtook his world record by just 0.01 seconds.\n\nValk has also set three 4x4x4 world records, two for single solve and one for an average of 5.  His second single world record, 26.77 seconds on 15 April 2012, was the first official 4x4x4 solve under 30 seconds. Altogether, Valk has broken 5 [[World Cube Association|WCA]] world records, 17 European records, and 127 Dutch national records. Valk also currently holds the world record for solving the most Rubik's cubes in 1 hour, 374 cubes, set in Paris on 21 October 2015.\n\nValk is also known as a creator of the VLS (Valk Last Slot) 3x3x3 algorithm set, which correctly orients the last layer while inserting the last corner-edge pair of the first two layers. Valk used one of these algorithms to complete the cube in his 2016 3x3x3 world record.\n\n== The Valk ==\nValk is also a businessman: he collaborated with the Chinese brand QiYi MoFangGe to set up his own brand, The Valk, creating cubes according to his own specifications.

The size of the cube (5.55&nbsp;cm each side) is a reference to his first Rubik's cube world record. He set his 2016 3x3x3 world record using a special magnetized version of this cube put together by TheCubicle.us, known as the Cubicle Valk3 M.

During his time as a board member, Gilles helped organize many competitions as a WCA delegate. He also contributed to WCA by creating much needed regulations which would in turn help out cubers all over the world. Presently, Gilles is a [[technical advisor]] for the WCA and assists when needed.<ref>http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=468</ref>\n\n== Roux method ==\nOver a span of years, Gilles developed his own method to solving the 3x3x3 cube. Using a smaller quantity of memorized [[algorithm]]s than most methods of solving, Roux still found his method to be fast and efficient. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3×2×1 block. The 3×2×1 block is usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3×2×1 on the opposite side. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regards to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step.\n\n== Official results ==\nFor official results, solves must be completed in a [[competition]] held by the WCA. In competition, Gilles has recorded a single solve of 10.06 seconds, ranking him just out the top one thousand solvers in the world (as of 01/01/15). His best average of 5 was set on 16 September 2011 at 13.03.<ref>http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2004ROUX01</ref> Also his greatest achieved fewest moves competition for the standard 3x3x3 is 31, being part of the \"31 club\", coming to a draw with another known cuber and creator of popular method of solving, [[Lars Petrus]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Rubik's Cube]]\n* [[Speedcubing]]\n* [[Jessica Fridrich]]\n* [[Lars Petrus]]\n* [[World Cube Association]]\n\n== References ==\n {{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roux, Gilles}}\n[[Category:1971 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:French speedcubers]]"

      "text": "{{refimproveBLP|date=January 2011}}\n'''Lars Erik Petrus''' (born 4 November 1960 in [[Luleå]] in Sweden) is an accomplished [[Speedcubing|speedcuber]].\n\nIn 1982, he became the national champion of [[Sweden]], and went on to finish fourth overall at the first official [[Rubik's Cube]] World Championships held in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]]. He later published his method, known as the Petrus system, on the Internet. It became a fairly popular method among intermediate and upper-level speedcubers, although its more recent use has diminished considerably due to the increased predominance of methods such as ZZ, Roux, and CFOP. Petrus won the 3x3x3 Fewest Moves category at the 2005 World Championships held in November 2005 at [[Lake Buena Vista]], [[Florida]], USA claiming the US$500 prize. He currently (since 1995) resides in [[SF Bay Area]], [[California]], USA.\n\n==The Lars Petrus System==\nThe Petrus System was designed as an alternative to the popular layer-based solutions of the early 1980s. Petrus reasoned that as a solver constructs layers, further organization of the cube's remaining pieces is restricted by what one has already done. In order for a layer-based solution to continue after the first layer had been constructed, the solved portion of the cube would have to be temporarily disassembled while the desired moves were made, then reassembled afterwards. Petrus sought to get around this quagmire by solving the cube outwards from one corner, leaving him with unrestricted movement on several sides of the cube as he progressed. This method is often used to solve the cube in a fewest-moves solution.\n\n===The Method===\nThe system uses seven basic steps to solve a Rubik's Cube.\n\n# Build a 2x2x2 block\n# Expand to a 2x2x3 without destroying the 2x2x2 block\n# Correct edge orientation\n# Solve two complete layers\n# Permute the remaining corners\n# Orient the remaining corners\n# Permute the final edges\n\nPetrus invented three simple and flexible algorithms to complete the last three steps, which he named Niklas, Sune and Allan. \n\nWhile the method stands alone as an efficient system for solving the Rubik's Cube, many modifications have been made over the years to stay on the cutting edge of competitive [[speedcubing]]. Many more algorithms have been added to shave seconds off the solution time, and steps 5+6 or 6+7 are often combined depending on the problems each case presents. Petrus' personal best speedsolve is 13.6 seconds, achieved in 2006.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rubiks.com/lvl4/commun/cbeclb/wc2005/results.html Rubik's World Championship 2005] - Official Results\n*[http://lar5.com/cube/ Solving Rubik's Cube for Speed] by Lars Petrus\n*[http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=1982PETR01 Lars's Official Records] - From the [[World Cube Association]] website\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petrus, Lars}}\n[[Category:Swedish speedcubers]]\n[[Category:1960 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Google employees]]\n[[Category:People from Luleå]]\n\n[[sv:Rubiks kub#Petrus-metoden]]"

The Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra</ref>\n\nThey may be obtained by [[stellation|stellating]] the regular [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] [[dodecahedron]] and [[icosahedron]], and differ from these in having regular [[pentagram]]mic [[face (geometry)|face]]s or [[vertex figure]]s. They can all be seen as three-dimensional analogues of the pentagram in  one way or another.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Non-convexity ===\nThese figures have [[pentagram]]s (star pentagons) as faces or vertex figures. The small and [[great stellated dodecahedron]] have [[star polygon|nonconvex regular]] [[pentagram]] faces. The [[great dodecahedron]] and [[great icosahedron]] have [[convex polygon|convex]] polygonal faces, but pentagrammic [[vertex figure]]s.\n\nIn all cases, two faces can intersect along a line that is not an edge of either face, so that part of each face passes through the interior of the figure. Such lines of intersection are not part of the polyhedral structure and are sometimes called false edges. Likewise where three such lines intersect at a point that is not a corner of any face, these points are false vertices. The images below show spheres at the true vertices, and blue rods along the true edges.\n\nFor example, the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] has 12 [[pentagram]] faces with the central [[pentagon]]al part hidden inside the solid. The visible parts of each face comprise five [[isosceles triangle]]s which touch at five points around the pentagon. We could treat these triangles as 60 separate faces to obtain a new, irregular polyhedron which looks outwardly identical. Each edge would now be divided into three shorter edges (of two different kinds), and the 20 false vertices would become true ones, so that we have a total of 32 vertices (again of two kinds). The hidden inner pentagons are no longer part of the polyhedral surface, and can disappear. Now [[Planar graph#Euler's formula|Euler's formula]] holds: 60&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;90&nbsp;+&nbsp;32&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. However this polyhedron is no longer the one described by the [[Schläfli symbol]] {5/2,&nbsp;5}, and so can not be a Kepler–Poinsot solid even though it still looks like one from outside.\n\n=== Euler characteristic χ ===\nA Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron covers its circumscribed sphere more than once, with the centers of faces acting as winding points in the figures which have pentagrammic faces, and the vertices in the others.  Because of this, they are not necessarily topologically equivalent to the sphere as Platonic solids are, and in particular the [[Euler characteristic|Euler relation]]\n\n:<math>\\chi=V-E+F=2\\ </math>\n\ndoes not always hold. Schläfli held that all polyhedra must have χ = 2, and he rejected the small stellated dodecahedron and great dodecahedron as proper polyhedra. This view was never widely held.\n\nA modified form of Euler's formula, using [[Density (polytope)|density]] (''D'') of the [[vertex figure]]s (<math>d_v</math>) and faces (<math>d_f</math>) was given by [[Arthur Cayley]], and holds both for convex polyhedra (where the correction factors are all 1), and the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra:\n:<math>d_v V - E + d_f F = 2D.</math>\n\n=== Duality and Petrie polygons ===\n\nThe Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra exist in [[dual polyhedron|dual]] pairs. Duals have the same [[Petrie polygon]], or more precisely, Petrie polygons with the same two dimensional projection.\n\nThe following images show the two [[dual compound]]s with the same [[midsphere|edge radius]]. They also show that the Petrie polygons are [[skew polygon|skew]].\nTwo relationships described in the article below are also easily seen in the images: That the violet edges are the same, and that the green faces lie in the same planes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! <span style=\"color: #a13870;\">horizontal edge in front</span>\n! <span style=\"color: #007400;\">vertical edge in front</span>\n!

A small stellated dodecahedron appears in a marble tarsia (inlay panel) on the floor of [[St. Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]], Italy. It dates from the 15th century and is sometimes attributed to [[Paolo Uccello]]. \n\nIn his ''Perspectiva corporum regularium'' (''Perspectives of the regular solids''), a book of woodcuts published in 1568, [[Wenzel Jamnitzer]] depicts the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] and a [[great dodecahedron]] (both shown below). There is also a [[truncation (geometry)|truncated]] version of the [[small stellated dodecahedron]]<ref>[[:File:Perspectiva Corporum Regularium 27e.jpg]]</ref>. It is clear from the general arrangement of the book that he regarded only the five Platonic solids as regular.\n\nThe small and great stellated dodecahedra, sometimes called the '''Kepler polyhedra''', were first recognized as regular by [[Johannes Kepler]] in 1619. He obtained them by [[stellation|stellating]] the regular convex dodecahedron, for the first time treating it as a surface rather than a solid. He noticed that by extending the edges or faces of the convex dodecahedron until they met again, he could obtain star pentagons. Further, he recognized that these star pentagons are also regular. In this way he constructed the two stellated dodecahedra. Each has the central convex region of each face \"hidden\" within the interior, with only the triangular arms visible. Kepler's final step was to recognize that these polyhedra fit the definition of regularity, even though they were not [[Convex polyhedron|convex]], as the traditional [[Platonic solid]]s were.\n\nIn 1809, [[Louis Poinsot]] rediscovered Kepler's figures, by assembling star pentagons around each vertex. He also assembled convex polygons around star vertices to discover two more regular stars, the great icosahedron and great dodecahedron. Some people call these two the '''Poinsot polyhedra'''. Poinsot did not know if he had discovered all the regular star polyhedra.\n\nThree years later, [[Augustin Cauchy]] proved the list complete by [[stellation|stellating]] the [[Platonic solid]]s, and almost half a century after that, in 1858, [[Joseph Bertrand|Bertrand]] provided a more elegant proof by [[faceting]] them.\n\nThe following year, [[Arthur Cayley]] gave the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra the names by which they are generally known today.\n\nA hundred years later, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] developed a [[Stellation#Naming stellations|systematic terminology]] for stellations in up to four dimensions. Within this scheme the [[small stellated dodecahedron]] is just the ''stellated dodecahedron''.\n\n{| style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top;\"\n| [[File:Marble floor mosaic Basilica of St Mark Vencice.jpg|thumb|center|Floor [[mosaic]] in [[St Mark's Basilica]], [[Venice]] sometimes attributed to [[Paolo Uccello]]]]\n| [[File:De divina proportione - Icosaedron Elevatum Solidum.jpg|thumb|center|''Icosaedron Elevatum'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], ''[[De divina proportione]]'' (1509)]]\n|\n{{multiple image\n | align = center | total_width = 440\n | image1 = Perspectiva Corporum Regularium 22c.jpg\n | image2 = Perspectiva Corporum Regularium MET DP239933, great stellated dodecahedron.jpg\n | footer = [[Great dodecahedron]] and [[great stellated dodecahedron]] in '' Perspectiva Corporum Regularium'' by [[Wenzel Jamnitzer]] (1568)\n}}\n| [[File:Stellated dodecahedra Harmonices Mundi.jpg|thumb|center|Stellated dodecahedra, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' by [[Johannes Kepler]] (1619)]]\n| [[Image:Alexander's Star.jpg|thumb|center|[[Alexander's Star]]]]\n|}\n\n== Regular star polyhedra in art and culture ==\n\nA [[Dissection (geometry)|dissection]] of the great dodecahedron was used for the 1980s puzzle [[Alexander's Star]].\nRegular star polyhedra first appear in Renaissance art. A small stellated dodecahedron is depicted in a marble tarsia on the floor of St. Mark's Basilica, Venice, Italy, dating from ca. 1430 and sometimes attributed to Paulo Ucello.\n\nIn the 20th Century, Artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s interest in geometric forms often led to works based on or including regular solids; ''[[Gravitation (M. C. Escher)|Gravitation]]'' is based on a small stellated dodecahedron.\n\nNorwegian artist [[Vebjørn Sand]]s sculpture ''The Kepler Star'' is displayed near [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen]]. The star spans 14 meters, and consists of an [[icosahedron]] and a [[dodecahedron]] inside a great stellated dodecahedron.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Regular polytope]]\n* [[Regular polyhedron]]\n* [[List of regular polytopes#Finite Non-Convex Polytopes - star-polytopes|List of regular polytopes]]\n* [[Uniform polyhedron]]\n* [[Uniform star polyhedron]]\n* [[Polyhedral compound]]\n* [[Regular star 4-polytope]] – the ten regular star [[4-polytope]]s, 4-dimensional analogues of the Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[Joseph Bertrand|J.

Some sources (such as [[Proclus]]) credit [[Pythagoras]] with their discovery. Other evidence suggests that he may have only been familiar with the tetrahedron, cube, and dodecahedron and that the discovery of the octahedron and icosahedron belong to [[Theaetetus (mathematician)|Theaetetus]], a contemporary of Plato. In any case, Theaetetus gave a mathematical description of all five and may have been responsible for the first known proof that no other convex regular polyhedra exist.\n\nThe Platonic solids are prominent in the philosophy of [[Plato]], their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] {{circa}}360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four [[classical element]]s ([[earth (classical element)|earth]], [[air (classical element)|air]], [[water (classical element)|water]], and [[fire (classical element)|fire]]) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron. There was intuitive justification for these associations: the heat of fire feels sharp and stabbing (like little tetrahedra). Air is made of the octahedron; its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel it. Water, the icosahedron, flows out of one's hand when picked up, as if it is made of tiny little balls. By contrast, a highly nonspherical solid, the hexahedron (cube) represents \"earth\". These clumsy little solids cause dirt to crumble and break when picked up in stark difference to the smooth flow of water.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Moreover, the cube's being the only regular solid that [[tessellation|tessellates]] [[Euclidean space]] was believed to cause the solidity of the Earth.\n\nOf the fifth Platonic solid, the dodecahedron, Plato obscurely remarks, \"...the god used [it] for arranging the constellations on the whole heaven\". [[Aristotle]] added a fifth element, [[aether (classical element)|aithēr]] (aether in Latin, \"ether\" in English) and postulated that the heavens were made of this element, but he had no interest in matching it with Plato's fifth solid.<ref>Wildberg (1988): Wildberg discusses the correspondence of the Platonic solids with elements in ''Timaeus'' but notes that this correspondence appears to have been forgotten in ''[[Epinomis]]'', which he calls \"a long step towards Aristotle's theory\", and he points out that Aristotle's ether is above the other four elements rather than on an equal footing with them, making the correspondence less apposite.</ref>\n\n[[Euclid]] completely mathematically described the Platonic solids in the [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']], the last book (Book XIII) of which is devoted to their properties. Propositions 13–17 in Book XIII describe the construction of the tetrahedron, octahedron, cube, icosahedron, and dodecahedron in that order. For each solid Euclid finds the ratio of the diameter of the circumscribed sphere to the edge length. In Proposition 18 he argues that there are no further convex regular polyhedra.\n[[Andreas Speiser]] has advocated the view that the construction of the 5 regular solids is the chief goal of the deductive system canonized in the ''Elements''.{{sfn|Weyl|1952|p=74}} Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.\n\nIn the 16th century, the German [[astronomer]] [[Johannes Kepler]] attempted to relate the five extraterrestrial [[planet]]s known at that time to the five Platonic solids. In ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'', published in 1596, Kepler proposed a model of the [[Solar System]] in which the five solids were set inside one another and separated by a series of inscribed and circumscribed spheres. Kepler proposed that the distance relationships between the six planets known at that time could be understood in terms of the five Platonic solids enclosed within a sphere that represented the orbit of [[Saturn]]. The six spheres each corresponded to one of the planets ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and Saturn). The solids were ordered with the innermost being the octahedron, followed by the icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and finally the cube, thereby dictating the structure of the solar system and the distance relationships between the planets by the Platonic solids. In the end, Kepler's original idea had to be abandoned, but out of his research came his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|three laws of orbital dynamics]], the first of which was that [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#First Law|the orbits of planets are ellipses]] rather than circles, changing the course of physics and astronomy.  He also discovered the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler solids]].\n\nIn the 20th century, attempts to link Platonic solids to the physical world were expanded to the [[electron shell model]] in chemistry by [[Robert James Moon|Robert Moon]] in a theory known as the \"[[Robert James Moon#Moon model|Moon model]]\".{{sfn|Hecht|Stevens|2004}}\n\n==Cartesian coordinates==\nFor Platonic solids centered at the origin, simple [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of the vertices are given below.

Both tetrahedral positions make the compound [[stellated octahedron]].\n\nThe coordinates of the icosahedron are related to two alternated sets of coordinates of a nonuniform [[truncated octahedron]], t{3,4} or {{CDD|node_1|3|node_1|4|node}}, also called a ''[[Icosahedron#Pyritohedral symmetry|snub octahedron]]'', as s{3,4} or {{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}}, and seen in the [[compound of two icosahedra]].\n\nEight of the vertices of the dodecahedron are shared with the cube. Completing all orientations leads to the [[compound of five cubes]].\n\n== Combinatorial properties ==\n\nA convex polyhedron is a Platonic solid if and only if\n\n# all its faces are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]] convex [[regular polygon]]s,\n# none of its faces intersect except at their edges, and\n# the same number of faces meet at each of its [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]].\n\nEach Platonic solid can therefore be denoted by a symbol {''p'',&nbsp;''q''} where\n\n: ''p'' is the number of edges (or, equivalently, vertices) of each face, and\n: ''q'' is the number of faces (or, equivalently, edges) that meet at each vertex.\n\nThe symbol {''p'',&nbsp;''q''}, called the [[Schläfli symbol]], gives a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] description of the polyhedron. The Schläfli symbols of the five Platonic solids are given in the table below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 | Polyhedron\n![[Vertex (geometry)|Vertices]]\n![[Edge (geometry)|Edges]]\n![[Face (geometry)|Faces]]\n![[Schläfli symbol]]\n![[Vertex configuration]]\n|- align=center\n| [[tetrahedron]]\n| [[Image:tetrahedron.svg|50px|Tetrahedron]]\n| 4 || 6 || 4 || {3, 3} || 3.3.3\n|- align=center\n| [[cube]]\n| [[Image:hexahedron.svg|50px|Hexahedron (cube)]]\n| 8 || 12 || 6 || {4, 3} || 4.4.4\n|- align=center\n| [[octahedron]]\n| [[Image:octahedron.svg|50px|Octahedron]]\n| 6 || 12 || 8 || {3, 4} || 3.3.3.3\n|- align=center\n| [[Regular dodecahedron|dodecahedron]]<!--PLEASE DO NOT SWAP THE DODECAHEDRON AND ICOSAHEDRON, IT IS CORRECT-->\n| [[Image:Dodecahedron.svg|50px|Dodecahedron]]\n| 20 || 30 || 12 || {5, 3} || 5.5.5\n|- align=center\n| [[Regular icosahedron|icosahedron]]\n| [[Image:icosahedron.svg|50px|Icosahedron]]\n| 12 || 30 || 20 || {3, 5} || 3.3.3.3.3\n|}\n\n{{Hamiltonian path dodecahedron}}\n\nAll other combinatorial information about these solids, such as total number of vertices (''V''), edges (''E''), and faces (''F''), can be determined from ''p'' and ''q''. Since any edge joins two vertices and has two adjacent faces we must have:\n\n: <math>pF = 2E = qV.\\,</math>\n\nThe other relationship between these values is given by [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]]:\n\n: <math>V - E + F = 2.\\,</math>\n\nThis can be proved in many ways. Together these three relationships completely determine ''V'', ''E'', and ''F'':\n\n: <math>V = \\frac{4p}{4 - (p-2)(q-2)},\\quad E = \\frac{2pq}{4 - (p-2)(q-2)},\\quad F = \\frac{4q}{4 - (p-2)(q-2)}.</math>\n\nSwapping ''p'' and ''q'' interchanges ''F'' and ''V'' while leaving ''E'' unchanged. For a geometric interpretation of this property, see § [[#Dual polyhedra|Dual polyhedra]] below.\n\n=== As a configuration===\nThe elements of a polyhedron can be expressed in a [[Configuration_(polytope)#Higher_dimensions|configuration matrix]]. The rows and columns correspond to vertices, edges, and faces. The diagonal numbers say how many of each element occur in the whole polyhedron. The nondiagonal numbers say how many of the column's element occur in or at the row's element. Dual pairs of polyhedra have their configuration matrices rotated 180 degrees from each other.<ref>Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, sec 1.8 Configurations</ref>\n{| class=wikitable\n!{p,q}\n!colspan=5|Platonic configurations\n|- valign=top\n![[group order]]:<BR>''g'' = 8''pq''/(4-(''p''-2)(''q''-2))\n!''g''=24\n!colspan=2|''g''=48\n!colspan=2|''g''=120\n|-\n|\n{| class=wikitable\n!|| v ||e||f\n|- align=center\n!v\n| ''g''/2''q'' ||''q'' ||''q''\n|- align=center\n!e \n| 2 ||''g''/4 ||2\n|- align=center\n!f\n| ''p'' || ''p'' || ''g''/2''p''\n|}\n\n| BGCOLOR=\"#e0f0e0\" |\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ {3,3}\n|- align=center\n|4||3||3\n|- align=center\n|2||6||2\n|- align=center\n|3||3||4\n|}\n| BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0e0\" |\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ {3,4}\n|- align=center\n|6|| 4||4\n|- align=center\n|2||12||2\n|- align=center\n|3|| 3||8\n|}\n| BGCOLOR=\"#e0e0f0\" |\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ {4,3}\n|- align=center\n|8|| 3||3\n|- align=center\n|2||12||2\n|- align=center\n|4|| 4||6\n|}\n| BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0e0\" |\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ {3,5}\n|- align=center\n|12|| 5|| 5\n|- align=center\n| 2||30|| 2\n|- align=center\n| 3|| 3||20\n|}\n| BGCOLOR=\"#e0e0f0\" |\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ {5,3}\n|- align=center\n|20|| 3|| 3\n|- align=center\n| 2||30|| 2\n|- align=center\n| 5|| 5||12\n|}\n|}\n\n== Classification ==\nThe classical result is that only five convex regular polyhedra exist. Two common arguments below demonstrate no more than five Platonic solids can exist, but positively demonstrating the existence of any given solid is a separate question—one that requires an explicit construction.\n\n=== Geometric proof ===\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ Polygon nets around a vertex\n|- align=center valign=bottom\n|[[File:Polyiamond-3-1.svg|80px]]<BR>{3,3}<BR>Defect 180°\n|[[File:Polyiamond-4-1.svg|80px]]<BR>{3,4}<BR>Defect 120°\n|[[File:Polyiamond-5-4.svg|80px]]<BR>{3,5}<BR>Defect 60°\n|BGCOLOR=\"#e0e0ff\"|[[File:Polyiamond-6-11.svg|80px]]<BR>{3,6}<BR>Defect 0°\n|- align=center valign=bottom\n|[[File:TrominoV.jpg|80px]]<BR>{4,3}<BR>Defect 90°\n|BGCOLOR=\"#e0e0ff\"|[[File:Square tiling vertfig.png|80px]]<BR>{4,4}<BR>Defect 0°\n|[[File:Pentagon_net.png|80px]]<BR>{5,3}<BR>Defect 36°\n|BGCOLOR=\"#e0e0ff\"|[[File:Hexagonal tiling vertfig.png|80px]]<BR>{6,3}<BR>Defect 0°\n|- align=center\n|colspan=4|A vertex needs at least 3 faces, and an [[angle defect]].<BR>A 0° angle defect will fill the Euclidean plane with a regular tiling.<BR>By [[Angular defect#Descartes.27 theorem|Descartes' theorem]], the number of vertices is 720°/''defect''.\n|}\nThe following geometric argument is very similar to the one given by [[Euclid]] in the [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']]:\n\n# Each vertex of the solid must be a vertex for at least three faces.\n# At each vertex of the solid, the total, among the adjacent faces, of the angles between their respective adjacent sides must be less than 360°. The amount less than 360° is called an [[angle defect]].\n# The angles at all vertices of all faces of a Platonic solid are identical: each vertex of each face must contribute less than {{sfrac|360°|3}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;120°. \n# Regular polygons of [[Hexagon|six]] or more sides have only angles of 120° or more, so the common face must be the triangle, square, or pentagon. For these different shapes of faces the following holds:\n#* [[Triangle|Triangular]] faces: Each vertex of a regular triangle is 60°, so a shape may have 3, 4, or 5 triangles meeting at a vertex; these are the tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\n#* [[Square (geometry)|Square]] faces: Each vertex of a square is 90°, so there is only one arrangement possible with three faces at a vertex, the cube.\n#* [[Pentagon]]al faces: Each vertex is 108°; again, only one arrangement of three faces at a vertex is possible, the dodecahedron.\n::Altogether this makes 5 possible Platonic solids.\n\n=== Topological proof ===\n\nA purely [[topology|topological]] proof can be made using only combinatorial information about the solids. The key is [[Euler characteristic|Euler's observation]] that ''V''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''E''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, and the fact that ''pF''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''qV'', where ''p'' stands for the number of edges of each face and ''q'' for the number of edges meeting at each vertex. Combining these equations one obtains the equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{2E}{q} - E + \\frac{2E}{p} = 2.</math>\n\nSimple algebraic manipulation then gives\n\n: <math>{1 \\over q} + {1 \\over p}= {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over E}.</math>\n\nSince ''E'' is strictly positive we must have\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{q} + \\frac{1}{p} > \\frac{1}{2}.</math>\n\nUsing the fact that ''p'' and ''q'' must both be at least 3, one can easily see that there are only five possibilities for {''p'',&nbsp;''q''}:\n: {3,&nbsp;3}, {4,&nbsp;3}, {3,&nbsp;4}, {5,&nbsp;3}, {3,&nbsp;5}.\n\n== Geometric properties ==\n\n=== Angles ===\n\nThere are a number of [[angle]]s associated with each Platonic solid. The [[dihedral angle]] is the interior angle between any two face planes. The dihedral angle, ''θ'', of the solid {''p'',''q''} is given by the formula\n\n: <math>\\sin{\\theta\\over 2} = \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{p}\\right)}.</math>\n\nThis is sometimes more conveniently expressed in terms of the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] by\n\n: <math>\\tan{\\theta\\over 2} = \\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{h}\\right)}.</math>\n\nThe quantity ''h'' (called the [[Coxeter number]]) is 4, 6, 6, 10, and 10 for the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron respectively.\n\nThe [[angular deficiency]] at the vertex of a polyhedron is the difference between the sum of the face-angles at that vertex and 2{{pi}}. The defect, ''δ'', at any vertex of the Platonic solids {''p'',''q''} is\n\n: <math>\\delta = 2\\pi - q\\pi\\left(1-{2\\over p}\\right).</math>\n\nBy a theorem of Descartes, this is equal to 4{{pi}} divided by the number of vertices (i.e. the total defect at all vertices is 4{{pi}}).\n\nThe 3-dimensional analog of a plane angle is a [[solid angle]]. The solid angle, ''Ω'', at the vertex of a Platonic solid is given in terms of the dihedral angle by\n\n: <math>\\Omega = q\\theta - (q-2)\\pi.\\,</math>\n\nThis follows from the [[spherical excess]] formula for a [[spherical polygon]] and the fact that the [[vertex figure]] of the polyhedron {''p'',''q''} is a regular ''q''-gon.\n\nThe solid angle of a face subtended from the center of a platonic solid is equal to the solid angle of a full sphere (4{{pi}} steradians) divided by the number of faces.  Note that this is equal to the angular deficiency of its dual.\n\nThe various angles associated with the Platonic solids are tabulated below. The numerical values of the solid angles are given in [[steradian]]s. The constant ''φ'' = {{sfrac|1 + {{sqrt|5}}|2}} is the [[golden ratio]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Polyhedron||[[Dihedral angle]]<br>(''θ'')||tan&nbsp;{{sfrac|''θ''|2}}||[[Defect (geometry)|Defect]] (''δ'')||Vertex [[solid angle]] (''Ω'')||Face<br>solid angle\n|- align=center\n| [[tetrahedron]] || 70.53° || <math>1\\over{\\sqrt 2}</math> || <math>\\pi</math>\n| <math>\\cos^{-1}\\left(\\frac{23}{27}\\right) \\quad \\approx 0.551286</math>\n| <math>\\pi</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[cube]] || 90° || <math>1</math> || <math>\\pi\\over 2</math>\n| <math>\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\quad \\approx 1.57080</math>\n| <math>2\\pi\\over 3</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[octahedron]] || 109.47° || <math>\\sqrt 2</math> || <math>{2\\pi}\\over 3</math>\n| <math>4\\sin^{-1}\\left({1\\over 3}\\right) \\quad \\approx 1.35935</math>\n| <math>\\pi\\over 2</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[Regular_dodecahedron|dodecahedron]] || 116.57° || <math>\\varphi</math> || <math>\\pi\\over 5</math>\n| <math>\\pi - \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{2}{11}\\right) \\quad \\approx 2.96174</math>\n| <math>\\pi\\over 3</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[Regular_icosahedron|icosahedron]] || 138.19° || <math>\\varphi^2</math> || <math>\\pi\\over 3</math>\n| <math>2\\pi - 5\\sin^{-1}\\left({2\\over 3}\\right) \\quad \\approx 2.63455</math>\n| <math>\\pi\\over 5</math>\n|}\n\n=== Radii, area, and volume ===\n\nAnother virtue of regularity is that the Platonic solids all possess three concentric spheres:\n\n* the [[circumscribed sphere]] that passes through all the vertices,\n* the [[midsphere]] that is tangent to each edge at the midpoint of the edge, and\n* the [[inscribed sphere]] that is tangent to each face at the center of the face.\n\nThe [[radius|radii]] of these spheres are called the ''circumradius'', the ''midradius'', and the ''inradius''. These are the distances from the center of the polyhedron to the vertices, edge midpoints, and face centers respectively. The circumradius ''R'' and the inradius ''r'' of the solid {''p'',&nbsp;''q''} with edge length ''a'' are given by\n\n: <math>R = \\left({a\\over 2}\\right)\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{q}\\tan\\frac{\\theta}{2}</math>\n: <math>r = \\left({a\\over 2}\\right)\\cot\\frac{\\pi}{p}\\tan\\frac{\\theta}{2}</math>\n\nwhere ''θ'' is the dihedral angle. The midradius ''ρ'' is given by\n\n: <math>\\rho = \\left({a\\over 2}\\right)\\frac{\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{p}\\right)}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{h}\\right)}</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is the quantity used above in the definition of the dihedral angle (''h'' = 4, 6, 6, 10, or 10). Note that the ratio of the circumradius to the inradius is symmetric in ''p'' and ''q'':\n\n: <math>{R\\over r} = \\tan\\frac{\\pi}{p}\\tan\\frac{\\pi}{q}=\\frac{{\\sqrt{{\\sin^{-2}{\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)}}-{\\cos^{2}{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}}}}}{\\sin{\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)}}. </math>\n\nThe [[surface area]], ''A'', of a Platonic solid {''p'',&nbsp;''q''} is easily computed as area of a regular ''p''-gon times the number of faces ''F''. This is:\n\n: <math>A = \\left({a\\over 2}\\right)^2 Fp\\cot\\frac{\\pi}{p}.</math>\n\nThe [[volume]] is computed as ''F'' times the volume of the [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] whose base is a regular ''p''-gon and whose height is the inradius ''r''. That is,\n\n: <math>V = \\tfrac13 rA.</math>\n\nThe following table lists the various radii of the Platonic solids together with their surface area and volume. The overall size is fixed by taking the edge length, ''a'', to be equal to 2.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Polyhedron<br><small>(''a''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2)</small> || Inradius (''r'') || Midradius (''ρ'') || Circumradius (''R'') || Surface area (''A'') || Volume (''V'') || Volume<br><small>(unit edges)</small>\n|- align=center\n| [[tetrahedron]] || <math>1\\over {\\sqrt 6}</math> || <math>1\\over {\\sqrt 2}</math> || <math>\\sqrt{3\\over 2}</math> || <math>4\\sqrt 3</math> || <math>\\frac{\\sqrt 8}{3}\\approx 0.942809</math> || <math>\\approx0.117851</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[cube]] || <math>1\\,</math> || <math>\\sqrt 2</math> || <math>\\sqrt 3</math> || <math>24\\,</math> || <math>8\\,</math> || <math>1\\,</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[octahedron]] || <math>\\sqrt{2\\over 3}</math> || <math>1\\,</math> || <math>\\sqrt 2</math> || <math>8\\sqrt 3</math> || <math>\\frac{\\sqrt {128}}{3}\\approx 3.771236</math> || <math>\\approx 0.471404</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[dodecahedron]] || <math>\\frac{\\varphi^2}{\\xi}</math> || <math>\\varphi^2</math> || <math>\\sqrt 3\\,\\varphi</math> || <math>12 {\\sqrt {25+10\\sqrt5}}</math> || <math>\\frac{20\\varphi^3}{\\xi^2}\\approx 61.304952</math> || <math>\\approx 7.663119</math>\n|- align=center\n| [[icosahedron]] || <math>\\frac{\\varphi^2}{\\sqrt 3}</math> || <math>\\varphi</math> || <math>\\xi\\varphi</math> || <math>20\\sqrt 3</math> || <math>\\frac{20\\varphi^2}{3}\\approx 17.453560</math> || <math>\\approx 2.181695</math>\n|}\n\nThe constants ''φ'' and ''ξ'' in the above are given by\n\n: <math>\\varphi = 2\\cos{\\pi\\over 5} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt 5}{2}\\qquad\\xi = 2\\sin{\\pi\\over 5} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt 5}{2}} = 5^{\\frac14}\\varphi^{-\\frac12}.</math>\n\nAmong the Platonic solids, either the dodecahedron or the icosahedron may be seen as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume.) The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and it fills out its circumscribed sphere the most.\n\n== Symmetry ==\n\n=== Dual polyhedra ===\n{{multiple image\n | align = right  | direction=vertical | width=150\n | image1 = Dual compound 4 max.png\n | image2 = Dual compound 8 max.png\n | image3 = Dual compound 20 max.png\n | footer = [[Dual compound]]s\n}}\nEvery polyhedron has a [[dual polyhedron|dual (or \"polar\") polyhedron]] '''with faces and vertices interchanged'''. The dual of every Platonic solid is another Platonic solid, so that we can arrange the five solids into dual pairs.\n\n* The tetrahedron is [[self-dual polyhedron|self-dual]] (i.e. its dual is another tetrahedron).\n* The cube and the octahedron form a dual pair.\n* The dodecahedron and the icosahedron form a dual pair.\n\nIf a polyhedron has Schläfli symbol {''p'',&nbsp;''q''}, then its dual has the symbol {''q'',&nbsp;''p''}. Indeed, every combinatorial property of one Platonic solid can be interpreted as another combinatorial property of the dual.\n\nOne can construct the dual polyhedron by taking the vertices of the dual to be the centers of the faces of the original figure. Connecting the centers of adjacent faces in the original forms the edges of the dual and thereby interchanges the number of faces and vertices while maintaining the number of edges.\n\nMore generally, one can dualize a Platonic solid with respect to a sphere of radius ''d'' concentric with the solid. The radii (''R'',&nbsp;''ρ'',&nbsp;''r'') of a solid and those of its dual (''R''*,&nbsp;''ρ''*,&nbsp;''r''*) are related by\n\n: <math>d^2 = R^\\ast r = r^\\ast R = \\rho^\\ast\\rho.</math>\n\nDualizing with respect to the midsphere (''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ρ'') is often convenient because the midsphere has the same relationship to both polyhedra. Taking ''d''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''Rr'' yields a dual solid with the same circumradius and inradius (i.e. ''R''*&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R'' and ''r''*&nbsp;=&nbsp;''r'').\n\n=== Symmetry groups ===\n\nIn mathematics, the concept of [[symmetry]] is studied with the notion of a [[group (mathematics)|mathematical group]]. Every polyhedron has an associated [[symmetry group]], which is the set of all transformations ([[Euclidean isometry|Euclidean isometries]]) which leave the polyhedron invariant. The [[order (group theory)|order]] of the symmetry group is the number of symmetries of the polyhedron. One often distinguishes between the ''full symmetry group'', which includes [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]], and the ''proper symmetry group'', which includes only [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]].\n\nThe symmetry groups of the Platonic solids are a special class of [[point groups in three dimensions|three-dimensional point groups]] known as [[polyhedral group]]s. The high degree of symmetry of the Platonic solids can be interpreted in a number of ways. Most importantly, the vertices of each solid are all equivalent under the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the symmetry group, as are the edges and faces. One says the action of the symmetry group is [[transitive action|transitive]] on the vertices, edges, and faces. In fact, this is another way of defining regularity of a polyhedron: a polyhedron is ''regular'' if and only if it is [[vertex-uniform]], [[edge-uniform]], and [[face-uniform]].\n\nThere are only three symmetry groups associated with the Platonic solids rather than five, since the symmetry group of any polyhedron coincides with that of its dual. This is easily seen by examining the construction of the dual polyhedron. Any symmetry of the original must be a symmetry of the dual and vice versa. The three polyhedral groups are:\n\n* the [[tetrahedral group]] ''T'',\n* the [[octahedral group]] ''O'' (which is also the symmetry group of the cube), and\n* the [[icosahedral group]] ''I'' (which is also the symmetry group of the dodecahedron).\n\nThe orders of the proper (rotation) groups are 12, 24, and 60 respectively – precisely twice the number of edges in the respective polyhedra. The orders of the full symmetry groups are twice as much again (24, 48, and 120). See (Coxeter 1973) for a derivation of these facts. All Platonic solids except the tetrahedron are ''centrally symmetric,'' meaning they are preserved under [[reflection through the origin]].\n\nThe following table lists the various symmetry properties of the Platonic solids. The symmetry groups listed are the full groups with the rotation subgroups given in parenthesis (likewise for the number of symmetries). [[Wythoff's construction|Wythoff's kaleidoscope construction]] is a method for constructing polyhedra directly from their symmetry groups. They are listed for reference Wythoff's symbol for each of the Platonic solids.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Polyhedron\n!rowspan=2|[[Schläfli symbol|Schläfli<br>symbol]]\n!rowspan=2|[[Wythoff symbol|Wythoff<br>symbol]]\n!rowspan=2|[[Dual polyhedron|Dual<br>polyhedron]]\n!colspan=5|[[Symmetry group]] (Reflection, rotation)\n|-\n![[Polyhedral group|Polyhedral]]\n![[Schönflies notation|Schön.]]\n![[Coxeter notation|Cox.]]\n![[Orbifold notation|Orb.]]\n![[group order|Order]]\n|- align=center\n| [[tetrahedron]]\n| {3, 3} || 3 {{pipe}} 2 3 || tetrahedron\n| [[tetrahedral symmetry|Tetrahedral]] [[File:Tetrahedral reflection domains.png|40px]]\n| ''T''<sub>d</sub><BR>''T''\n| [3,3]<BR>[3,3]<sup>+</sup>\n| *332<BR>332\n| 24<BR>12\n|- align=center\n| [[cube]]\n| {4, 3} || 3 {{pipe}} 2 4 || octahedron\n| rowspan=2 | [[octahedral symmetry|Octahedral]] [[File:Octahedral reflection domains.png|40px]]\n| rowspan=2 | ''O''<sub>h</sub><BR>''O''\n| rowspan=2 | [4,3]<BR>[4,3]<sup>+</sup>\n| rowspan=2 | *432<BR>432\n| rowspan=2 | 48<BR>24\n|- align=center\n| [[octahedron]]\n| {3, 4} || 4 {{pipe}} 2 3 || cube\n|- align=center\n| [[dodecahedron]]\n| {5, 3} || 3 {{pipe}} 2 5 || icosahedron\n| rowspan=2 | [[icosahedral symmetry|Icosahedral]] [[File:Icosahedral reflection domains.png|40px]]\n| rowspan=2 | ''I''<sub>h</sub><BR>''I''\n| rowspan=2 | [5,3]<BR>[5,3]<sup>+</sup>\n| rowspan=2 | *532<BR>532\n| rowspan=2 | 120<BR>60\n|- align=center\n| [[icosahedron]]\n| {3, 5} || 5 {{pipe}} 2 3 || dodecahedron\n|}\n\n== In nature and technology ==\n{{uncited section|date=October 2018}}\nThe tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron all occur naturally in [[crystal structure]]s. These by no means exhaust the numbers of possible forms of crystals. However, neither the regular icosahedron nor the regular dodecahedron are amongst them. One of the forms, called the [[pyritohedron]] (named for the group of [[pyrite|minerals]] of which it is typical) has twelve pentagonal faces, arranged in the same pattern as the faces of the regular dodecahedron. The faces of the pyritohedron are, however, not regular, so the pyritohedron is also not regular. [[Allotropes of boron]] and many [[crystal structure of boron-rich metal borides|boron compounds]], such as [[boron carbide]], include discrete B<sub>12</sub> icosahedra within their crystal structures. [[carborane acid|Carborane acids]] also have molecular structures approximating regular icosahedra.\n\n[[Image:Circogoniaicosahedra ekw.jpg|frame|Circogonia icosahedra, a species of [[radiolaria]], shaped like a [[regular icosahedron]].]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, [[Ernst Haeckel]] described (Haeckel, 1904) a number of species of [[Radiolaria]], some of whose skeletons are shaped like various regular polyhedra. Examples include ''Circoporus octahedrus'', ''Circogonia icosahedra'', ''Lithocubus geometricus'' and ''Circorrhegma dodecahedra''. The shapes of these creatures should be obvious from their names.\n\nMany [[virus]]es, such as the [[herpes]] virus, have the shape of a regular icosahedron. Viral structures are built of repeated identical [[protein]] subunits and the icosahedron is the easiest shape to assemble using these subunits. A regular polyhedron is used because it can be built from a single basic unit protein used over and over again; this saves space in the viral [[genome]].\n\nIn [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]], global numerical models of atmospheric flow are of increasing interest which employ [[geodesic grid]]s that are based on an icosahedron (refined by [[triangulation]]) instead of the more commonly used [[longitude]]/[[latitude]] grid. This has the advantage of evenly distributed spatial resolution without [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] (i.e. the poles) at the expense of somewhat greater numerical difficulty.\n\nGeometry of [[space frame]]s is often based on platonic solids. In the MERO system, Platonic solids are used for naming convention of various space frame configurations. For example, {{sfrac|1|2}}O+T refers to a configuration made of one half of octahedron and a tetrahedron.\n\nSeveral [[Platonic hydrocarbons]] have been synthesised, including [[cubane]] and [[dodecahedrane]].\n<gallery>\nImage:Tetrahedrane-3D-balls.png |[[Tetrahedrane]]\nImage:Cubane-3D-balls.png |[[Cubane]]\nImage:Dodecahedrane-3D-balls.png|[[Dodecahedrane]]\n</gallery>\n\nPlatonic solids are often used to make [[dice]], because dice of these shapes can be made [[fair dice|fair]]. 6-sided dice are very common, but the other numbers are commonly used in [[role-playing game]]s. Such dice are commonly referred to as d''n'' where ''n'' is the number of faces (d8, d20, etc.); see [[dice notation]] for more details.\n\n[[Image:BluePlatonicDice2.jpg|thumb|A set of polyhedral dice.]]\n\nThese shapes frequently show up in other games or puzzles. Puzzles similar to a [[Rubik's Cube]] come in all five shapes – see [[magic polyhedra]].\n\n=== Liquid crystals with symmetries of Platonic solids ===\n\nFor the intermediate material phase called [[liquid crystal]]s, the existence of such symmetries was first proposed in 1981 by [[Hagen Kleinert|H. Kleinert]] and K. Maki.<ref>Kleinert and Maki (1981)</ref><ref>[http://chemgroups.northwestern.edu/seideman/Publications/The%20liquid-crystalline%20blue%20phases.pdf ''The liquid-crystalline blue phases'' (1989). by Tamar Seideman, Reports on Progress in Physics, Volume 53, Number 6]</ref>\nIn aluminum the icosahedral structure was discovered three years after this by [[Dan Shechtman]], which earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2011.\n\n== Related polyhedra and polytopes ==\n\n=== Uniform polyhedra ===\n\nThere exist four regular polyhedra which are not convex, called [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]]. These all have [[icosahedral symmetry]] and may be obtained as [[stellation]]s of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron.\n\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|- align=center\n| [[Image:Cuboctahedron.jpg|120px]]<br />[[cuboctahedron]]\n| [[Image:Icosidodecahedron.jpg|120px]]<br />[[icosidodecahedron]]\n|}\n\nThe next most regular convex polyhedra after the Platonic solids are the [[cuboctahedron]], which is a [[rectification (geometry)|rectification]] of the cube and the octahedron, and the [[icosidodecahedron]], which is a rectification of the dodecahedron and the icosahedron (the rectification of the self-dual tetrahedron is a regular octahedron). These are both ''quasi-regular'', meaning that they are vertex- and edge-uniform and have regular faces, but the faces are not all congruent (coming in two different classes). They form two of the thirteen [[Archimedean solid]]s, which are the convex [[uniform polyhedron|uniform polyhedra]] with polyhedral symmetry. Their duals, the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] and [[rhombic triacontahedron]], are edge- and face-transitive, but their faces are not regular and their vertices come in two types each; they are two of the thirteen [[Catalan solid]]s.\n\nThe uniform polyhedra form a much broader class of polyhedra. These figures are vertex-uniform and have one or more types of [[regular polygon|regular]] or [[star polygon]]s for faces. These include all the polyhedra mentioned above together with an infinite set of [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], an infinite set of [[antiprism]]s, and 53 other non-convex forms.\n\nThe [[Johnson solid]]s are convex polyhedra which have regular faces but are not uniform. Among them are five of the eight convex [[deltahedron|deltahedra]], which have identical, regular faces (all equilateral triangles) but are not uniform. (The other three convex deltahedra are the Platonic tetrahedron, octahedron, and icosahedron.)\n\n=== Regular tessellations ===\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ Regular spherical tilings\n!colspan=5|Platonic tilings\n|-\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 332-t0-1-.png|60px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 432-t0.png|60px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 432-t2.png|60px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 532-t0.png|60px]]\n|[[File:Uniform tiling 532-t2.png|60px]]\n|-\n!{3,3}\n!{4,3}\n!{3,4}\n!{5,3}\n!{3,5}\n|-\n!colspan=5|Regular dihedral tilings\n|-\n|[[Image:Digonal dihedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Trigonal dihedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Tetragonal dihedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Pentagonal dihedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Hexagonal dihedron.png|60px]]\n|-\n!{2,2}\n!{3,2}\n!{4,2}\n!{5,2}\n!{6,2}...\n|-\n!colspan=5|Regular hosohedral tilings\n|-\n|[[Image:Spherical digonal hosohedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical trigonal hosohedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical square hosohedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical pentagonal hosohedron.png|60px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical hexagonal hosohedron.png|60px]]\n|-\n!{2,2}\n!{2,3}\n!{2,4}\n!{2,5}\n!{2,6}...\n|}\nThe three [[Euclidean_tilings_by_convex_regular_polygons#Regular_tilings | regular tessellation]]s of the plane are closely related to the Platonic solids. Indeed, one can view the Platonic solids as regular tessellations of the [[sphere]]. This is done by projecting each solid onto a concentric sphere. The faces project onto regular [[spherical polygon]]s which exactly cover the sphere. Spherical tilings provide two infinite additional sets of regular tilings, the [[hosohedra]], {2,''n''} with 2 vertices at the poles, and [[Lune (mathematics)|lune]] faces, and the dual [[dihedra]], {''n'',2} with 2 hemispherical faces and regularly spaced vertices on the equator. Such tesselations would be degenerate in true 3D space as polyhedra.\n\nOne can show that every regular tessellation of the sphere is characterized by a pair of integers {''p'',&nbsp;''q''} with {{sfrac|1|''p''}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|''q''}}&nbsp;>&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}. Likewise, a regular tessellation of the plane is characterized by the condition {{sfrac|1|''p''}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|''q''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}.

There are exactly six of these figures; five are analogous to the Platonic solids [[5-cell]] as {3,3,3}, [[16-cell]] as {3,3,4}, [[600-cell]] as {3,3,5}, [[tesseract]] as {4,3,3}, and [[120-cell]] as {5,3,3}, and a sixth one, the self-dual [[24-cell]], {3,4,3}.\n\nIn all dimensions higher than four, there are only three convex regular polytopes: the [[simplex]] as {3,3,...,3}, the [[hypercube]] as {4,3,...,3}, and the [[cross-polytope]] as {3,3,...,4}.{{sfn|Coxeter|1973|p=136}} In three dimensions, these coincide with the tetrahedron as {3,3}, the cube as {4,3}, and the octahedron as {3,4}.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n\n* [[Archimedean solid]]\n* [[Catalan solid]]\n* [[Deltahedron]]\n* [[Johnson solid]]\n* [[Goldberg polyhedron|Goldberg solid]]\n* [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler solids]]\n* [[List of regular polytopes]]\n* [[Regular polytope]]s\n* [[Regular skew polyhedron]]\n* [[Toroidal polyhedron]]\n\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n\n* {{cite journal\n| last1 = Atiyah\n| first1 = Michael\n| authorlink = Michael Atiyah\n| last2=[[Paul Sutcliffe|Sutcliffe]]\n| first2=Paul\n| year = 2003\n| title = Polyhedra in Physics, Chemistry and Geometry\n| journal = Milan J.

Its 30 edges are divided into two sets – containing 24 and 6 edges of the same length. The only axes of [[rotational symmetry]] are three mutually perpendicular twofold axes and four threefold axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the pyritohedron form occurs in the crystals of the mineral [[pyrite]], and it may be an inspiration for the discovery of the regular [[Platonic solid]] form.

Like the [[regular dodecahedron]], it has twelve identical [[pentagon]]al faces, with three meeting in each of the 20 vertices. However, the pentagons are not regular and the figure has no fivefold symmetry axes.\n\nAlthough regular dodecahedra do not exist in crystals, the tetartoid form does. The name tetartoid comes from the Greek root for one-fourth because it has one fourth of full octahedral symmetry, and half of pyritohedral symmetry.<ref>Dutch, Steve.

It has D<sub>3d</sub> symmetry, order 12. It has 2 sets of 3 identical pentagons on the top and bottom, connected 6 pentagons around the sides which alternate upwards and downwards. This form has a hexagonal cross-section and identical copies can be connected as a partial hexagonal honeycomb, but all vertices will not match.\n:[[File:Dual_triangular_gyrobianticupola.png|160px]]\n\n==Rhombic dodecahedron==\n[[File:Rhombicdodecahedron.jpg|160px|thumb|Rhombic dodecahedron]]\nThe ''[[rhombic dodecahedron]]'' is a [[zonohedron]] with twelve rhombic faces and octahedral symmetry. It is dual to the [[quasiregular polyhedron|quasiregular]] [[cuboctahedron]] (an [[Archimedean solid]]) and occurs in nature as a crystal form. The rhombic dodecahedron packs together to fill space.\n\nThe ''rhombic dodecahedron'' can be seen as a degenerate [[pyritohedron]] where the 6 special edges have been reduced to zero length, reducing the pentagons into rhombic faces.\n\nThe rhombic dodecahedron has several [[stellation]]s, the [[First stellation of rhombic dodecahedron|first of which]] is also a [[rhombic dodecahedron#Parallelohedron|parallelohedral spacefiller]].\n\nAnother important rhombic dodecahedron, the [[Bilinski dodecahedron]], has twelve faces congruent to those of the [[rhombic triacontahedron]], i.e. the diagonals are in the ratio of the [[golden ratio]]. It is also a [[zonohedron]] and was described by [[Stanko Bilinski|Bilinski]] in 1960.<ref>Hafner, I. and Zitko, T.

In the work, written entirely in Latin, Kepler discusses [[harmony]] and [[wikt:congruence|congruence]] in geometrical forms and physical phenomena.  The final section of the work relates his discovery of the so-called \"[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Third law|third law of planetary motion]]\".<ref>Johannes Kepler, ''Harmonices Mundi'' [The Harmony of the World] (Linz, (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1619), [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZLlCAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 189.]  From the bottom of p. 189:  ''\"Sed res est certissima extactissimaque quod ''proportio qua est inter binorum quorumcunque Planetarum tempora periodica, sit præcise sesquialtera proportionis'' mediarum distantiarum, id est ''Orbium'' ipsorum;&nbsp;...\"''  (But it is absolutely certain and exact that the ''proportion between the periodic times of any two planets is precisely the sesquialternate proportion'' [i.e., the ratio of 3:2] of their mean distances, that is, of the actual ''spheres'',&nbsp;...\"<br/>\nAn English translation of Kepler's ''Harmonices Mundi'' is available as:  Johannes Kepler with E.J.

Kepler was aware that the content of ''Harmonices Mundi'' closely resembled that of the subject matter for [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy’s]] ''Harmonica'', but was not concerned, because the new [[astronomy]] Kepler would use, most notably the adoption of [[elliptic orbit]]s in the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]], allowed him to explore new theorems.  Another important development that allowed Kepler to establish his celestial-harmonic relationships, was the abandonment of the [[Pythagorean tuning]] as the basis for [[Consonance and dissonance|musical consonance]] and the adoption of geometrically supported musical ratios; this would eventually be what allowed Kepler to relate musical consonance and the angular velocities of the planets. Thus Kepler, could reason that his relationships gave evidence for God acting as a grand geometer, rather than a [[Numerology|Pythagorean numerologist]].<ref name=field>Field, J. V. (1984). A Lutheran astrologer: Johannes Kepler. Archive for History of Exact Sciences, Vol. 31, No. 3, pp. 207-219.</ref>\n\nThe concept of musical harmonies intrinsically existing within the spacing of the planets existed in medieval philosophy prior to Kepler. [[Musica universalis]] was a traditional philosophical metaphor that was taught in the [[quadrivium]], and was often called the \"music of the spheres\". Kepler was intrigued by this idea while he sought explanation for a rational arrangement of the heavenly bodies.<ref name=voelkel>Voelkel, J. R. (1995). The music of the heavens: Kepler's harmonic astronomy. 1994. Physics Today, 48(6), 59-60.</ref>  When Kepler uses the term “harmony” it is not strictly referring to the musical definition, but rather, a broader definition encompassing congruence in [[Nature]] and the workings of both the [[Astronomical object|celestial]] and [[Earth|terrestrial]] bodies.  He notes musical harmony as being a product of man, derived from angles, in contrast to a harmony that he refers to as being a phenomenon that interacts with the human [[soul]].  In turn, this allowed Kepler to claim the [[Earth]] has a soul because it is subjected to [[Astrology|astrological]] harmony.<ref name=\"field\"/>\n\n==Content==\nKepler divides ''The Harmony of the World'' into five long chapters: the first is on regular polygons; the second is on the congruence of figures; the third is on the origin of harmonic proportions in music; the fourth is on [[Astrological aspect|harmonic configurations in astrology]]; the fifth is on the harmony of the motions of the planets.<ref name=\"Brackenridge\">Brackenridge, J. (1982). Kepler, elliptical orbits, and celestial circularity: A study in the persistence of metaphysical commitment part II.

He is primarily interested with how polygons, which he defines as either regular or semiregular, can come to be fixed together around a central point on a plane to form congruence. His primary objective was to be able to rank polygons based on a measure of sociability, or rather, their ability to form partial congruence when combined with other polyhedra. He returns to this concept later in ''Harmonices Mundi'' with relation to astronomical explanations. In the second chapter is the earliest mathematical understanding of two types of [[regular polyhedron|regular]] [[star polyhedron|star polyhedra]], the [[small stellated dodecahedron|small]] and [[great stellated dodecahedron]]; they would later be called Kepler's solids or Kepler Polyhedra and, together with two regular polyhedra discovered by [[Louis Poinsot]], as the [[Kepler–Poinsot polyhedron|Kepler–Poinsot polyhedra]].<ref>Cromwell, P. R. (1995). Kepler's work on polyhedra. Mathematical Intelligencer, 17(3), 23.</ref> He describes polyhedra in terms of their faces, which is similar to the model used in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' to describe the formation of [[Platonic solid]]s in terms of basic triangles.<ref name=\"field\"/> The book features illustrations of solids and [[Tessellation|tiling]] patterns, some of which are related to the [[golden ratio]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Livio|first=Mario|date=2002|title=The Golden Ratio: The Story of Phi, The World's Most Astonishing Number|publisher=[[Broadway Books]]|location=New York|isbn=0-7679-0815-5|pages=154–156}}</ref>\n\nWhile medieval philosophers spoke metaphorically of the \"music of the spheres\", Kepler discovered physical harmonies in planetary motion. He found that the difference between the maximum and minimum angular speeds of a [[planet]] in its orbit approximates a harmonic proportion. For instance, the maximum angular speed of the Earth as measured from the Sun varies by a [[semitone]] (a ratio of 16:15), from ''mi'' to ''fa'', between [[Apsis|aphelion]] and [[Apsis|perihelion]]. Venus only varies by a tiny 25:24 interval (called a [[diesis]] in musical terms).<ref name=\"Brackenridge\"/> Kepler explains the reason for the Earth's small harmonic range:\n\n:The Earth sings Mi, Fa, Mi:  you may infer even from the syllables that in this our home '''mi'''sery and '''fa'''mine hold sway.<ref name=\"Schoot, A. 2001\">Schoot, A. (2001). Kepler's search for form and proportion. Renaissance Studies: Journal of the Society for Renaissance Studies, 15(1), 65–66.</ref>\n\nThe celestial choir Kepler formed was made up of a tenor ([[Mars]]), two bass ([[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]]), a soprano ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), and two altos ([[Venus]] and Earth).  Mercury, with its large elliptical orbit, was determined to be able to produce the greatest number of notes, while Venus was found to be capable of only a single note because its orbit is nearly a circle.<ref name=\"Brackenridge\"/><ref>The opening of the film ''[[Mars and April|Mars et Avril]]'', by [[Martin Villeneuve]], is based on Kepler's cosmological model in ''Harmonices Mundi'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies.

They usually have [[icosahedral symmetry]], such that they have 6 triangles at a vertex, except 12 vertices which have 5 triangles. They are the [[dual polyhedron|dual]] of corresponding [[Goldberg polyhedra]] with mostly hexagonal faces.\n\nGeodesic polyhedra are a good approximation to a sphere for many purposes, and appear in many different contexts. The most well-known may be the [[geodesic dome]]s designed by [[Buckminster Fuller]], which geodesic polyhedra are named after. [[Geodesic grid]]s used in [[geodesy]] also have the geometry of geodesic polyhedra.

The '''+''' symbol indicates the valence of the vertices being increased. '''''b'',''c''''' represent a subdivision description, with 1,0 representing the base form. There are 3 symmetry classes of forms: {3,3+}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[tetrahedron]], {3,4+}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[octahedron]], and {3,5+}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[icosahedron]].\n\nThe dual notation for [[Goldberg polyhedra]] is '''{''q''+,3}<sub>''b'',''c''</sub>''', with valence-3 vertices, with ''q''-gonal and hexagonal faces. There are 3 symmetry classes of forms: {3+,3}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[tetrahedron]], {4+,3}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[cube]], and {5+,3}<sub>1,0</sub> for a [[dodecahedron]].\n\nValues for ''b'',''c'' are divided into three classes:\n: '''Class I''' (b=0 or c=0): '''{3,''q''+}<sub>''b'',0</sub>''' or '''{3,''q''+}<sub>0,''b''</sub>''' represent a simple division with original edges being divided into ''b'' sub-edges.\n: '''Class II''' (b=c): '''{3,''q''+}<sub>''b'',''b''</sub>''' are easier to see from the [[dual polyhedron]] {''q'',3} with ''q''-gonal faces first divided into triangles with a central point, and then all edges are divided into ''b'' sub-edges. \n: '''Class III''': '''{3,''q''+}<sub>''b'',''c''</sub>''' have nonzero unequal values for ''b'',''c'', and exist in chiral pairs. For ''b''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''c'' we can define it as a right-handed form, and ''c''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''b'' is a left-handed form.\n\nSubdivisions in class III here do not line up simply with the original edges. The subgrids can be extracted by looking at a [[triangular tiling]], positioning a large triangle on top of grid vertices and walking paths from one vertex ''b'' steps in one direction, and a turn, either clockwise or counterclockwise, and then another ''c'' steps to the next primary vertex.\n\nFor example, the [[icosahedron]] is {3,5+}<sub>1,0</sub>, and [[pentakis dodecahedron]], {3,5+}<sub>1,1</sub> is seen as a [[regular dodecahedron]] with pentagonal faces divided into 5 triangles.\n\nThe primary face of the subdivision is called a '''principal polyhedral triangle''' (PPT) or the '''breakdown structure'''. Calculating a single PPT allows the entire figure to be created.\n\nThe '''frequency''' of a geodesic polyhedron is defined by the sum of &nu; = ''b'' + ''c''. A '''harmonic''' is a subfrequency and can be any whole divisor of ''&nu;''. Class II always have a harmonic of 2, since &nu; = 2''b''.\n\nThe '''triangulation number''' is ''T'' = ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''bc'' + ''c''<sup>2</sup>. This number times the number of original faces expresses how many triangles the new polyhedron will have.\n\n{|\n|+ '''PPTs with frequency 8'''\n|[[File:Geodesic_principal_polyhedral_triangles_frequency8.png|480px]]\n|}\n\n==Elements==\nThe number of elements are specified by the triangulation number <math>T=b^2+bc+c^2</math>. Two different geodesic polyhedra may have the same number of elements, for instance, {3,5+}<sub>5,3</sub> and {3,5+}<sub>7,0</sub> both have T=49.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n!

Goldberg polyhedra are also related in that applying a [[Conway kis operator|kis operator]] (dividing faces triangles with a center point) creates new geodesic polyhedra, and [[truncation (geometry)|truncating]] vertices of a geodesic polyhedron creates a new Goldberg polyhedron. For example, Goldberg G(2,1) kised, becomes {3,5+}<sub>4,1</sub>, and truncating that becomes G(6,3). And similarly {3,5+}<sub>2,1</sub> truncated becomes G(4,1), and that kised becomes {3,5+}<sub>6,3</sub>.\n\n== Examples==\n=== Class I===\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Class I geodesic polyhedra\n|-  valign=top\n!

The best known is the ([[convex polyhedron|convex]], non-[[stellation|stellated]]) [[regular icosahedron]] — one of the [[Platonic solid]]s — whose faces are 20 [[equilateral triangle]]s.\n\n==Regular icosahedra==\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ Two kinds of regular icosahedra\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Icosahedron.png|150px]]<br />Convex [[regular icosahedron]]\n|[[File:Great icosahedron.png|150px]]<br />[[Great icosahedron]\n|}\nThere are two objects, one convex and one nonconvex, that can both be called regular icosahedra. Each has 30 edges and 20 [[equilateral triangle]] faces with five meeting at each of its twelve vertices. Both have [[icosahedral symmetry]]. The term \"regular icosahedron\" generally refers to the convex variety, while the nonconvex form is called a ''great icosahedron''.\n\n===Convex regular icosahedron===\n{{Main|Regular icosahedron}}\nThe convex regular icosahedron is usually referred to simply as the ''regular icosahedron'', one of the five regular [[Platonic solid]]s, and is represented by its [[Schläfli symbol]] {3, 5}, containing 20 triangular faces, with 5 faces meeting around each vertex.\n\nIts [[dual polyhedron]] is the regular [[dodecahedron]] {5, 3} having three regular pentagonal faces around each vertex.\n\n===Great icosahedron===\n{{main|Great icosahedron}}\nThe [[great icosahedron]] is one of the four regular star [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]]. Its [[Schläfli symbol]] is {3, {{sfrac|5|2}}}. Like the convex form, it also has 20 equilateral triangle faces, but its vertex figure is a [[pentagram]] rather than a pentagon, leading to geometrically intersecting faces. The intersections of the triangles do not represent new edges.\n\nIts [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[great stellated dodecahedron]] {{{sfrac|5|2}}, 3}, having three regular star pentagonal faces around each vertex.\n\n==Stellated icosahedra==\n[[Stellation]] is the process of extending the faces or edges of a polyhedron until they meet to form a new polyhedron. It is done symmetrically so that the resulting figure retains the overall symmetry of the parent figure.\n\nIn their book ''[[The Fifty-Nine Icosahedra]]'', Coxeter et al. enumerated 58 such stellations of the regular icosahedron.\n\nOf these, many have a single face in each of the 20 face planes and so are also icosahedra. The great icosahedron is among them.\n\nOther stellations have more than one face in each plane or form compounds of simpler polyhedra. These are not strictly icosahedra, although they are often referred to as such.\n{{Icosahedron stellations}}\n\n==Pyritohedral symmetry==\n{| class=wikitable align=right width=\"320\"\n!bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2|Pyritohedral and tetrahedral symmetries\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Coxeter diagram]]s||{{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|4|node}} (pyritohedral) [[File:Uniform polyhedron-43-h01.svg|24px]]<br />{{CDD|node_h|3|node_h|3|node_h}} (tetrahedral) [[File:Uniform polyhedron-33-s012.svg|24px]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Schläfli symbol]]||s{3,4}<br />sr{3,3} or <math>s\\begin{Bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 3 \\end{Bmatrix}</math>\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Face (geometry)|Faces]]||20 triangles:<br />8 equilateral<br />12 isosceles\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Edge (geometry)|Edges]]||30 (6 short + 24 long)\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Vertex (geometry)|Vertices]]||12\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[List of spherical symmetry groups#Polyhedral symmetry|Symmetry group]]||[[Pyritohedral symmetry|T<sub>h</sub>]], [4,3<sup>+</sup>], (3*2), order 24\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Point groups in three dimensions#Rotation groups|Rotation group]]||[[Tetrahedral symmetry|T<sub>d</sub>]], [3,3]<sup>+</sup>, (332), order 12\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|[[Dual polyhedron]]||[[Pyritohedron]]\n|-\n|bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Properties||[[convex set|convex]]\n|-\n!colspan=2|[[File:Pseudoicosahedron flat.png|200px]]<br />[[Net (polyhedron)|Net]]\n|-\n| colspan=2|\n{| width=320px align=right\n|[[File:Icosahedron in cuboctahedron.png|220px]]\n|[[File:Icosahedron in cuboctahedron net.png|100px]]\n|-\n|colspan=2|A regular icosahedron is topologically identical to a [[cuboctahedron]] with its 6 square faces bisected on diagonals with pyritohedral symmetry.\n|}\n\n|}\nA ''regular icosahedron'' can be distorted or marked up as a lower [[pyritohedral]] symmetry,<ref name=Baez/> and is called a '''snub octahedron''', '''snub tetratetrahedron''', '''snub tetrahedron''', and '''pseudo-icosahedron'''.

They were first described by [[Michael Goldberg (mathematician)|Michael Goldberg]] (1902–1990) in 1937. They are defined by three properties: each face is either a pentagon or hexagon, exactly three faces meet at each vertex, and they have [[rotational icosahedral symmetry]]. They are not necessarily mirror-symmetric; e.g. ''GP''(5,3) and ''GP''(3,5) are [[enantiomorph]]s of each other.  A consequence of [[Euler's polyhedron formula]] is that there will be exactly twelve pentagons.\n\nIcosahedral symmetry ensures that the pentagons are always [[regular polygon|regular]], although many of the hexagons may not be. Typically all of the vertices lie on a [[sphere]], but they can also be computed as equilateral.\n\nIt is a [[dual polyhedron]] of a [[geodesic sphere]], with all triangle faces and 6 triangles per vertex, except for 12 vertices with 5 triangles.\n\nSimple examples of Goldberg polyhedra include the [[dodecahedron]] and [[truncated icosahedron]]. Other forms can be described by taking a [[chess]] [[Knight (chess)|knight]] move from one pentagon to the next: first take ''m'' steps in one direction, then turn 60° to the left and take ''n'' steps. Such a polyhedron is denoted ''GP''(''m'',''n''). A dodecahedron is ''GP''(1,0) and a truncated icosahedron is ''GP''(1,1).\n\nA similar technique can be applied to construct polyhedra with [[tetrahedral symmetry]] and [[octahedral symmetry]]. These polyhedra will have triangles or squares rather than pentagons. These variations are given Roman numeral subscripts denoting the number of sides on the non-hexagon faces: GP<sub>III</sub>(n,m), GP<sub>IV</sub>(n,m), and GP<sub>V</sub>(n,m).\n\n== Elements ==\nThe number of vertices, edges, and faces of ''GP''(''m'',''n'') can be computed from ''m'' and ''n'', with ''T''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''mn''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''n'')<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''mn'', depending on one of three symmetry systems:<ref>Clinton’s Equal Central Angle Conjecture, JOSEPH D.

The [[Chamfer (geometry)|chamfer]] operator, ''c'', replaces all edges by hexagons, transforming ''GP''(''m'',''n'') to ''GP''(2''m'',2''n''), with a ''T'' multiplier of&nbsp;4. The ''truncated kis'' operator, ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''tk'', generates ''GP''(3,0), transforming ''GP''(''m'',''n'') to ''GP''(3''m'',3''n''), with a ''T'' multiplier of&nbsp;9.\n\nFor class 2 forms, the ''dual kis'' operator, ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''dk'', transforms ''GP''(''a'',0) into ''GP''(''a'',''a''), with a ''T'' multiplier of 3. For class 3 forms, the ''whirl'' operator, ''w'', generates ''GP''(2,1), with a ''T'' multiplier of 7. A clockwise and counterclockwise whirl generator, ''w''{{overline|''w''}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;''wrw'' generates ''GP''(7,0) in class 1. In general, a whirl can transform a GP(''a'',''b'') into GP(''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3''b'',2''ab'') for ''a''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''b'' and the same chiral direction. If chiral directions are reversed, GP(''a'',''b'') becomes GP(2''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3''b'',''a''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2''b'') if ''a''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2''b'', and GP(3''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b'',2''b''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''a'') if ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;2''b''.\n\n== Examples ==\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Class I polyhedra\n|-  valign=top\n!

[[Geodesic dome]]s such as those whose architecture [[Buckminster Fuller]] pioneered are often based on this structure.  It also corresponds to the geometry of the fullerene [[Buckminsterfullerene|C<sub>60</sub>]] (\"buckyball\") molecule.\n\nIt is used in the [[cell-transitive]] hyperbolic space-filling tessellation, the [[bitruncated order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb]].\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Polyhedron 20 max.png|thumb|left]]\nThis polyhedron can be constructed from an [[icosahedron]] with the 12 vertices [[Truncation (geometry)|truncated]] (cut off) such that one third of each edge is cut off at each of both ends.

      "text": "[[Image:Elongated square gyrobicupola.png|thumb|right|The [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (''J''<sub>37</sub>), a Johnson solid]]\n[[Image:Stella octangula.png|160px|thumb|This [[Stella octangula|24 equilateral triangle]] example is not a Johnson solid because it is not convex.]]\n[[Image:Partial cubic honeycomb.png|160px|thumb|This 24-square example is not a Johnson solid because it is not strictly convex (has 180° [[dihedral angle]]s.)]]\n\nIn [[geometry]], a '''Johnson solid''' is a strictly [[convex polyhedron]], which is not [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]] (i.e., not a [[Platonic solid]], [[Archimedean solid]], [[prism (geometry)|prism]], or [[antiprism]]), and each face of which is a [[regular polygon]]. There is no requirement that [[isohedral|each face must be the same polygon]], or that the same polygons join around each vertex. An example of a Johnson solid is the square-based [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] with [[equilateral]] sides ([[square pyramid|''J''<sub>1</sub>]]); it has 1 square face and 4 triangular faces.\n\nAs in any strictly convex solid, at least three faces meet at every vertex, and the total of their angles is less than 360 degrees. Since a regular polygon has angles at least 60 degrees, it follows that at most five faces meet at any vertex. The [[pentagonal pyramid]] (''J''<sub>2</sub>) is an example that actually has a degree-5 vertex.\n\nAlthough there is no obvious restriction that any given regular polygon cannot be a face of a Johnson solid, it turns out that the faces of Johnson solids always have 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 10 sides.\n\nIn 1966, [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. [[Victor Zalgaller]] in 1969 proved that Johnson's list was complete.\n\nOf the Johnson solids, the [[elongated square gyrobicupola]] (''J''<sub>37</sub>), also called the pseudorhombicuboctahedron,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pseudo-rhombicuboctahedra.html|title=Pseudo Rhombicuboctahedra|first=|last=GWH|date=|website=www.georgehart.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are 4 faces at each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: 3 squares and 1 triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an [[Archimedean solid]].\n\n== Names ==\nThe naming of Johnson solids follows a flexible and precise descriptive formula, such that many solids can be named in different ways without compromising their accuracy as a description. Most Johnson solids can be constructed from the first few ([[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], [[cupola (geometry)|cupolae]], and [[rotunda (geometry)|rotunda]]), together with the [[Platonic solid|Platonic]] and [[Archimedean solid|Archimedean]] solids, [[prism (geometry)|prisms]], and [[antiprism]]s; the centre of a particular solid's name will reflect these ingredients. From there, a series of prefixes are attached to the word to indicate additions, rotations and transformations:\n\n*'''Bi-''' indicates that two copies of the solid in question are joined base-to-base. For cupolae and rotundae, the solids can be joined so that either like faces ('''ortho-''') or unlike faces ('''gyro-''') meet. Using this nomenclature, an [[octahedron]] can be described as a  ''square bipyramid'', a [[cuboctahedron]] as a ''triangular gyrobicupola'', and an [[icosidodecahedron]] as a ''pentagonal gyrobirotunda''.\n*'''Elongated''' indicates a [[prism (geometry)|prism]] is joined to the base of the solid in question, or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. A [[rhombicuboctahedron]] can thus be described as an ''elongated square orthobicupola''.\n*'''Gyroelongated''' indicates an [[antiprism]] is joined to the base of the solid in question or between the bases in the case of Bi- solids. An [[icosahedron]] can thus be described as a ''gyroelongated pentagonal bipyramid''.\n*'''Augmented''' indicates another polyhedron, namely a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] or [[Cupola (geometry)|cupola]], is joined to one or more faces of the solid in question.\n*'''Diminished''' indicates a pyramid or cupola is removed from one or more faces of the solid in question.\n*'''[[gyration|Gyrate]]''' indicates a cupola mounted on or featured in the solid in question is rotated such that different edges match up, as in the difference between ortho- and gyrobicupolae.\n\nThe last three operations – ''augmentation'', ''diminution'', and ''gyration'' – can be performed multiple times for certain large solids.  ''Bi-'' & ''Tri-'' indicate a double and triple operation respectively. For example, a ''bigyrate'' solid has two rotated cupolae, and a ''tridiminished'' solid has three removed pyramids or cupolae.\n\nIn certain large solids, a distinction is made between solids where altered faces are parallel and solids where altered faces are oblique. ''Para-'' indicates the former, that the solid in question has altered parallel faces, and ''Meta-'' the latter, altered oblique faces. For example, a ''parabiaugmented'' solid has had two parallel faces augmented, and a ''metabigyrate'' solid has had 2 oblique faces gyrated.\n\nThe last few Johnson solids have names based on certain polygon complexes from which they are assembled. These names are defined by Johnson<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/johnson-info.html | title = Johnson Solids | accessdate = 5 February 2014 | author = George Hart (quoting Johnson) | website = Virtual Polyhedra | year = 1996}}</ref>\nwith the following nomenclature:\n\n*A ''lune'' is a complex of two triangles attached to opposite sides of a square.\n*''Spheno''- indicates a wedgelike complex formed by two adjacent lunes. ''Dispheno-'' indicates two such complexes.\n*''Hebespheno''- indicates a blunt complex of two lunes separated by a third lune.\n*''Corona'' is a crownlike complex of eight triangles.\n*''Megacorona'' is a larger crownlike complex of 12 triangles.\n*The suffix -''cingulum'' indicates a belt of 12 triangles.\n\n==Enumeration ==\n{{Further|List of Johnson solids}}\n=== Pyramids, cupolae and rotundae ===\nThe first 6 Johnson solids are pyramids, cupolae, or rotundae with at most 5 sides. 6 sided pyramids and cupolae are coplanar and are hence not Johnson solids.\n\n==== Pyramids ====\nThe first two Johnson solids, J1 and J2, are [[Pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]].

      "text": "In [[geometry]], a [[Johnson solid]] is a strictly [[Convex polyhedron|convex]] [[polyhedron]], each face of which is a [[regular polygon]], but which is not [[uniform polyhedron|uniform]], i.e., not a [[Platonic solid]], [[Archimedean solid]], [[prism (geometry)|prism]] or [[antiprism]].  In 1966, [[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]] published a list which included all 92 solids, and gave them their names and numbers. He did not prove that there were only 92, but he did conjecture that there were no others. [[Victor Zalgaller]] in 1969 proved that Johnson's list was complete.\n\nThe complete list is here with sorting by column. Other polyhedra can be constructed that are only approximately regular planar polygon faces, and are informally called [[near-miss Johnson solid]]; there can be no definitive count of them.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

This article describes diminishing one 4-valence vertex. This diminishment creates one new square face while 4 rhombic faces are reduced to triangles. It has 13 vertices, 24 edges, and 13 faces. It has ''C''<sub>4v</sub> symmetry, order 8.\n\nLike the rhombic dodecahedron, the long diagonal of each rhombic face is [[Square root of two|{{sqrt|2}}]] times the length of the short diagonal, so that the [[Angle#Types of angles|acute]] angles on each face measure arccos({{sfrac|1|3}}), or approximately 70.53°.\n\n== Self-dual==\nLike the dihedral symmetry [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramids]], and [[elongated pyramid]]s, it is [[dual polyhedron|self-dual]], with the dual geometry inverted across the [[axis of symmetry]]. It is one of three self-dual [[tridecahedron|tridecahedra]] with ''C''<sub>4v</sub> symmetry.<ref>[http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/SymmetricSelfDuals.html Symmetries of Canonical Self-Dual Polyhedra]</ref>\n\n==Space-filling==\nThis polyhedron along with the [[cube]] is [[Honeycomb (geometry)|space-filling]], like the [[rhombic dodecahedral honeycomb]]. Six diminished points come together to form cubic holes.\n\n== Cartesian coordinate==\nIt has 13 of 14 [[Cartesian coordinate]]s of the [[rhombic dodecahedron]] are:\n:8: (±1, ±1, ±1)\n:1: (2, 0, 0)\n:2: (0, ±2, 0)\n:2: (0, 0, ±2)\n\n==Augmented cuboctahedron==\nThe same topological polyhedron with different proportions can be constructed as an '''augmented [[cuboctahedron]]''', with a square face [[Augmentation (geometry)|augmented]] by a [[square pyramid]]. This construction requires merging of neighboring coparallel triangular faces into new 60° rhombic faces. This can also be seen as an [[Asymmetry|asymmetric]] [[stellation]] of a cuboctahedron. It retains 5 [[square]] faces, and 4 [[equilateral triangle]] faces of the cuboctahedron.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|[[File:Augmented_cuboctahedron.png|160px]]<BR>Augmented cuboctahedron\n|[[File:Augmented_cuboctahedron_net.png|160px]]<BR>Net\n|}\n\nThe 13 Cartesian coordinate can be positioned as:\n:1: ( 2,  0,  0)\n:4: (±1, ±1,  0)\n:4: (±1,  0, ±1)\n:4: ( 0, ±1, ±1)\n\nAugmenting two opposite squares will create a [[rhombic dodecahedron#Dihedral rhombic dodecahedron|dihedral rhombic dodecahedron]], doubling the symmetry to ''D''<sub>4h</sub> symmetry, order 16. Augmenting pyramids on all six square faces, with merged faces will produce a regular [[octahedron]], restoring full octahedral symmetry, order 48.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/SelfDualTridecahedron7.html Symmetric Canonical Self-Dual Tridecahedra #7]\n\n[[Category:Self-dual polyhedra]]\n[[Category:Space-filling polyhedra]]\n[[Category:Johnson solids]]\n\n\n{{polyhedron-stub}}"

It strongly resembles, but should not be mistaken for, the [[small rhombicuboctahedron]], which '''is''' an Archimedean solid.\n\nThis shape may have been discovered by [[Johannes Kepler]] in his enumeration of the Archimedean solids, but its first clear appearance in print appears to be the work of [[Duncan Sommerville]] in 1905.<ref>{{citation|first=D.

It is therefore a '''gyrate rhombicuboctahedron'''. Its similarity to the rhombicuboctahedron gives it the alternative name '''pseudorhombicuboctahedron'''. It has occasionally been referred to as \"the fourteenth Archimedean solid\".\n\nThis property does not carry over to its pentagonal-faced counterpart, the [[gyrate rhombicosidodecahedron]].\n\n== Symmetry and classification ==\nThe pseudorhombicuboctahedron possesses D<sub>4d</sub> symmetry.  It is locally vertex-regular – the arrangement of the four faces incident on any vertex is the same for all vertices; this is unique among the Johnson solids. However, the manner in which it is \"twisted\" gives it a distinct \"equator\" and two distinct \"poles\", which in turn divide its vertices into 8 \"polar\" vertices (4 per pole) and 16 \"equatorial\" vertices. It is therefore not [[vertex-transitive]], and consequently not usually considered to be one of the [[Archimedean solid]]s.\nWith faces colored by its ''D''<sub>4d</sub> symmetry, it can look like this:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!colspan=2|pseudorhombicuboctahedron\n![[Pseudo-deltoidal icositetrahedron]]<br>([[Dual polyhedron|Dual]])\n|-\n|[[File:Johnson solid 37 net.png|120px]]<br>[[Polyhedral net|net]]\n|[[File:Johnson solid 37.png|120px]]\n|[[File:Pseudo-strombic icositetrahedron.png|120px]]\n|}\n\nThere are 8 (green) squares around its [[equator]], 4 (red) triangles and 4 (yellow) squares above and below, and one (blue) square on each pole.\n\n==Related polyhedra and honeycombs==\nThe elongated square gyrobicupola can form a space-filling [[Honeycomb (geometry)|honeycomb]] with the regular [[tetrahedron]], cube, and [[cuboctahedron]].

Just as the other regular cupolas have an alternating sequence of squares and triangles surrounding a single polygon at the top ([[triangular cupola|triangle]], [[square cupola|square]] or [[pentagonal cupola|pentagon]]), each half of the gyrobifastigium consists of just alternating squares and triangles, connected at the top only by a ridge.\n\n==Honeycomb==\nThe [[gyrated triangular prismatic honeycomb]] can be constructed by packing together large numbers of identical gyrobifastigiums.\nThe gyrobifastigium is one of five convex polyhedra with regular faces capable of [[Space-filling polyhedron|space-filling]] (the others being the [[cube]], [[truncated octahedron]], [[triangular prism]], and [[hexagonal prism]]) and it is the only Johnson solid capable of doing so.<ref name=\"ah06\">{{citation\n | last1 = Alam | first1 = S.
