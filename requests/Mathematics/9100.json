It has had a major impact on science and engineering, particularly in the development of methodologies used in Computational Fluid Dynamics ([[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]]) and other computational fields.\n \nOn 1–2 May 1997 a symposium  entitled: ''Godunov-type numerical methods'', was held at the [[University of Michigan]] to honour Godunov. These methods are widely used to compute continuum processes dominated by wave propagation. On the following day, 3 May, Godunov received an honorary degree from the University of Michigan.\n\n'''[[Godunov's theorem]]''' (Godunov, 1959) (also known as Godunov's order barrier theorem) : ''Linear numerical schemes for solving [[partial differential equations]], having the property of not generating new extrema (a [[monotone scheme]]), can be at most first-order accurate''.\n\n'''[[Godunov's scheme]]''' is a conservative numerical scheme for solving partial differential equations. In this method, the conservative variables are considered as piecewise constant over the mesh cells at each time step and the time evolution is determined by the exact solution of the [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]] ([[shock tube]]) problem at the inter-cell boundaries (Hirsch, 1990).\n\n==Education==\n\n*1946-1951 - Department of Mechanics and Mathematics, [[Moscow State University]].\n*1951 - Diploma (M.

His contributions include the [[Hamming code]] (which makes use of a [[Hamming matrix]]), the [[Hamming window#Hamming window|Hamming window]], [[Hamming numbers]], [[sphere-packing]] (or [[Hamming bound]]), and the [[Hamming distance]].\n\nBorn in Chicago, Hamming attended [[University of Chicago]], [[University of Nebraska]] and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he wrote his doctoral thesis in mathematics under the supervision of [[Waldemar Trjitzinsky]] (1901–1973). In April 1945 he joined the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], where he programmed the [[IBM]] [[calculating machines]] that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. He left to join the [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] in 1946. Over the next fifteen years he was involved in nearly all of the Laboratories' most prominent achievements.\n\nAfter retiring from the Bell Labs in 1976, Hamming took a position at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]], where he worked as an [[adjunct professor]] and [[senior lecturer]] in [[computer science]], and devoted himself to teaching and writing books. He delivered his last lecture in December 1997, just a few weeks before he died  from a heart attack on January 7, 1998.\n\n== Early life ==\nRichard Wesley Hamming was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915,<ref name=\"IEEE\">{{cite web |url=http://computer.org/computer-pioneers/hamming.html |title=Computer Pioneers – Richard Wesley Hamming |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> the son of Richard J. Hamming, a credit manager, and Mabel G. Redfield.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} He grew up in Chicago, where he attended [[Crane High School (Chicago)|Crane Technical High School]] and [[Malcolm X College|Crane Junior College]].{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}}\n\nHamming initially wanted to study engineering, but money was scarce during the [[Great Depression]], and the only scholarship offer he received came from the [[University of Chicago]], which had no engineering school. Instead, he became a science student, majoring in mathematics,<ref name=\"ACM\">{{cite web |url=http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hamming_1000652.cfm |title=Richard W. Hamming – A.M. Turing Award Winner |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> and received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1937.<ref name=\"IEEE\" /> He later considered this a fortunate turn of events. \"As an engineer,\" he said, \"I would have been the guy going down manholes instead of having the excitement of frontier research work.\"<ref name=\"IEEE\" />\n\nHe went on to earn a [[Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1939, and then entered the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he wrote his doctoral thesis on ''Some Problems in the Boundary Value Theory of Linear Differential Equations'' under the supervision of [[Waldemar Trjitzinsky]].<ref name=\"ACM\" /> His thesis was an extension of Trjitzinsky's work in that area. He looked at [[Green's function]] and further developed [[Jacob Tamarkin]]'s methods for obtaining [[Characteristic equation (calculus)|characteristic]] solutions.<ref name=\"St Andrews\">{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Hamming.html |title=Hamming biography |publisher=[[University of St Andrews]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref> While he was a graduate student, he discovered and read [[George Boole]]'s  ''[[The Laws of Thought]]''.{{sfn|Hamming|1998|p=643}}\n\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign awarded Hamming his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1942, and he became an Instructor in Mathematics there. He married Wanda Little, a fellow student, on September 5, 1942,<ref name=\"ACM\" /> immediately after she was awarded her own Master of Arts in English literature. They would remain married until his death, but had no children.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} In 1944, he became an [[Assistant Professor]] at the [[J.B. Speed School of Engineering|J.B. Speed Scientific School]] at the [[University of Louisville]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"ACM\" />\n\n== Manhattan Project ==\nWith [[World War II]] still ongoing, Hamming left Louisville in April 1945 to work on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], in [[Hans Bethe]]'s division, programming the [[IBM]] [[calculating machines]] that computed the solution to equations provided by the project's physicists. His wife Wanda soon followed, taking a job at Los Alamos as a [[human computer]], working for Bethe and [[Edward Teller]].<ref name=\"ACM\" /> Hamming later recalled that:{{quote|Shortly before the first field test (you realize that no small scale experiment can be done—either you have a critical mass or you do not), a man asked me to check some arithmetic he had done, and I agreed, thinking to fob it off on some subordinate. When I asked what it was, he said, \"It is the probability that the test bomb will ignite the whole atmosphere.\" I decided I would check it myself! The next day when he came for the answers I remarked to him, \"The arithmetic was apparently correct but I do not know about the formulas for the capture cross sections for oxygen and nitrogen—after all, there could be no experiments at the needed energy levels.\" He replied, like a physicist talking to a mathematician, that he wanted me to check the arithmetic not the physics, and left. I said to myself, \"What have you done, Hamming, you are involved in risking all of life that is known in the Universe, and you do not know much of an essential part?\" I was pacing up and down the corridor when a friend asked me what was bothering me. I told him. His reply was, \"Never mind, Hamming, no one will ever blame you.\"{{sfn|Hamming|1998|p=643}} }}\n\nHamming remained at Los Alamos until 1946, when he accepted a post at the  [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] (BTL). For the trip to New Jersey, he bought [[Klaus Fuchs]]'s old car. When he later sold it just weeks before Fuchs was unmasked as a spy, the [[FBI]] regarded the timing as suspicious enough to interrogate Hamming.{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} Although Hamming described his role at Los Alamos as being that of a \"computer janitor\",{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} he saw [[computer simulation]]s of experiments that would have been impossible to perform in a laboratory. \"And when I had time to think about it,\" he later recalled, \"I realized that it meant that science was going to be changed\".<ref name=\"IEEE\" />\n\n== Bell Laboratories ==\n[[File:Hamming.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A two-dimensional visualisation of the [[Hamming distance]]. The color of each [[pixel]] indicates the [[Hamming distance]] between the [[binary representation]]s of its x and y coordinates, [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 16, in the 16-color system.]]\nAt the Bell Labs Hamming shared an office for a time with [[Claude Shannon]]. The Mathematical Research Department also included [[John Tukey]] and Los Alamos veterans Donald Ling and [[Brockway McMillan]]. Shannon, Ling, McMillan and Hamming came to call themselves the [[Young Turks (Bell Labs)|Young Turks]].<ref name=\"ACM\" /> \"We were first-class troublemakers,\" Hamming later recalled. \"We did unconventional things in unconventional ways and still got valuable results. Thus management had to tolerate us and let us alone a lot of the time.\"<ref name=\"IEEE\" />\n\nAlthough Hamming had been hired to work on [[elasticity theory]], he still spent much of his time with the calculating machines.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} Before he went home on one Friday in 1947, he set the machines to perform a long and complex series of calculations over the weekend, only to find when he arrived on Monday morning that an error had occurred early in the process and the calculation had errored off.<ref name=\"Additional Materials\" /> Digital machines manipulated information as sequences of zeroes and ones, units of information that Tukey would christen \"[[bit]]s\".{{sfn|Shannon|1948|p=379}} If a single bit in a sequence was wrong, then the whole sequence would be. To detect this, a [[parity bit]] was used to verify the correctness of each sequence. \"If the computer can tell when an error has occurred,\" Hamming reasoned, \"surely there is a way of telling where the error is so that the computer can correct the error itself.\"<ref name=\"Additional Materials\">{{cite web |title=Richard W. Hamming Additional Materials |url=http://amturing.acm.org/info/hamming_1000652.cfm |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery]] |accessdate=August 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nHamming set himself the task of solving this problem,{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} which he realised would have an enormous range of applications. Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept of the number of positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one [[code word]] into another, which is today known as the [[Hamming distance]].{{sfn|Morgan|1998|pp=973–975}} Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical [[error-correcting code]], which are called [[Hamming code]]s. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened up a whole new field of study.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|pp=973–975}}{{sfn|Hamming|1950|pp=147–160}}\n\nThe [[Hamming bound]], also known as the sphere-packing or volume bound is a limit on the parameters of an arbitrary [[block code]]. It is from an interpretation in terms of [[sphere packing]] in the Hamming distance into the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] of all possible words.  It gives an important limitation on the [[efficiency]] with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded.  A code which attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Hamming codes are perfect codes.{{sfn|Ling|Xing|2004|pp=82–88}}{{sfn|Pless|1982|pp=21–24}}\n\nReturning to [[differential equation]]s, Hamming studied means of numerically integrating them. A popular approach at the time was Milne's Method, attributed to [[Edward Arthur Milne|Arthur Milne]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Weisstein |first=Eric W. |title=Milne's Method |publisher=MathWorld |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MilnesMethod.html |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref> This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the result could be swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the [[Linear multistep method|Adams method]].{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=975}} He did extensive research into digital [[Filter (signal processing)|filters]], devising a new filter, the [[Hamming window]], and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, ''Digital Filters'' (1977).{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=976–977}}\n\nDuring the 1950s, he programmed one of the earliest computers, the [[IBM 650]], and with Ruth A. Weiss developed the L2 programming language, one of the earliest computer languages, in 1956. It was widely used within the Bell Labs, and also by external users, who knew it as Bell 2. It was superseded by [[Fortran]] when the Bell Labs' IBM 650 were replaced by the [[IBM 704]] in 1957.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/99.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140902215751/http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cstr/99.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 2, 2014 |title=Computing Science Technical Report No. 99 – A History of Computing Research at Bell Laboratories (1937–1975) |first=Bernard D. |last=Holbrook |first2=W. Stanley |last2=Brown |publisher=[[Bell Labs]] |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn ''A Discipline of Programming'' (1967), [[Edsger Dijkstra]] attributed to Hamming the problem of efficiently finding [[regular numbers]].{{sfn|Dijkstra|1976|pp=129–134}} The problem became known as \"Hamming's problem\", and the regular numbers are often referred to as Hamming numbers in Computer Science, although he did not discover them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HammingProblem |title=Hamming Problem |publisher=Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc. |accessdate=September 2, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his time at Bell Labs, Hamming avoided management responsibilities. He was promoted to management positions several times, but always managed to make these only temporary. \"I knew in a sense that by avoiding management,\" he later recalled, \"I was not doing my duty by the organization. That is one of my biggest failures.\"<ref name=\"IEEE\" />\n\n== Later life ==\nHamming served as president of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] from 1958 to 1960.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=972}} In 1960, he predicted that one day half of the Bell Lab's budget would be spent on computing. None of his colleagues thought that it would ever be so high, but his forecast  actually proved to be too low.{{sfn|Morgan|1998|p=977}} His philosophy on scientific computing appeared as the motto of his ''Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers'' (1962): {{quote|The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.{{sfn|Hamming|1962|pp=vii, 276, 395}} }}\n\nIn later life, Hamming became interested in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, when he left the Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at [[Stanford University]], [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], the [[City College of New York]], the [[University of California at Irvine]] and [[Princeton University]].{{Sfnm|Carnes|2005|1p=220–221|Tveito, Bruaset, and Lysne|2009|2p=59}} As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed in the first half of his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.<ref name=\"IEEE\" />\n\nIn 1976 he moved to the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]], where he worked as an [[Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] and [[senior lecturer]] in [[computer science]].{{sfn|Carnes|2005|pp=220–221}} He gave up research, and concentrated on teaching and writing books.<ref name=\"ACM\" /> He noted that:\n{{quote|The way mathematics is currently taught it is exceedingly dull. In the calculus book we are currently using on my campus, I found no single problem whose answer I felt the student would care about! The problems in the text have the dignity of solving a crossword puzzle – hard to be sure, but the result is of no significance in life.<ref name=\"ACM\" /> }}\nHamming attempted to rectify the situation with a new text, ''Methods of Mathematics Applied to Calculus, Probability, and Statistics'' (1985).<ref name=\"ACM\" /> In 1993, he remarked that \"when I left BTL, I knew that that was the end of my scientific career. When I retire from here, in another sense, it's really the end.\"<ref name=\"IEEE\" /> And so it proved.

He attended [[St John's College, Cambridge]] but the [[World War I|first World War]] interrupted his studies. He joined a group working on anti-aircraft [[ballistics]] under [[Archibald Vivian Hill|A. V. Hill]], where he gained considerable skill and an abiding interest in practical calculation and numerical methods for differential equations, executing most of his own work with pencil and paper.<ref>Van der Kloot(2011). \"Mirrors and smoke: A. V. Hill, his brigands, and the science of anti-aircraft gunnery in world war I. .\" Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. '''65''': 393–410.</ref>\n\nAfter the end of World War I, Hartree returned to Cambridge graduating in 1922 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#Second-class honours|Second Class]] degree in natural sciences.\n\n==Atomic structure calculations==\nIn 1921, a visit by [[Niels Bohr]] to Cambridge inspired Hartree to apply his numerical skills to [[Bohr model|Bohr's theory]] of the atom, for which he obtained his PhD in 1926 – his advisor was [[Ernest Rutherford]]. With the publication of [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger's equation]] in the same year, Hartree was able to apply his knowledge\nof [[differential equations]] and [[numerical analysis]] to the new [[introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].\nHe derived the [[Hartree equation]]s for the distribution of electrons in an atom and proposed the self-consistent field method for their solution. The wavefunctions from this theory did not satisfy the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for which [[John C. Slater|Slater]] showed that determinantal functions are required. [[Vladimir Fock|V. Fock]] published the \"equations with exchange\" now known as [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock equations]]. These are considerably more demanding computationally even with the efficient methods Hartree proposed for the calculation of exchange contributions.\n\n==Manchester years==\n[[File:Analyseur différentiel de Douglas Hartree.JPG|thumb|Differential analyser designed by Douglas Hartree, at [[Museum of Science and Industry (Manchester)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Manchester.]]\nIn 1929, Hartree was appointed to the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] at the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]. In 1933, he visited [[Vannevar Bush]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and learned first hand about his [[differential analyser]]. Immediately on his return to [[Manchester]], he set about building his own analyser from [[Meccano]]. Seeing the potential for further exploiting his numerical methods using the machine, he persuaded Sir Robert McDougall to fund a more robust machine, which was built in collaboration with [[Metropolitan-Vickers]].\n\nThe first application of the machine, reflecting Hartree's enthusiasm for railways, was calculating timetables for the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]].\n<ref>{{cite journal |\nlast = Hartree |first = D. R. |author2=Ingham J. |\ntitle = Note on the application of the differential analyser to the calculation of train running times |\nyear = 1938–1939 |\njournal = [[Memoirs and Proceedings of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]] |\nvolume = 83 | pages = 1–15}}\n</ref>\nHe spent the rest of the decade applying the differential analyser to find solutions of differential equations arising in physics. These included control theory and laminar boundary layer theory in fluid dynamics making significant contributions to each of the fields.\n\nThe differential analyser was not suitable for the solution of equations with exchange. When [[Vladimir Fock|Fock's]] publication pre-empted Hartree's work on equations with exchange, Hartree turned his research to radio-wave propagation that led to the [[Appleton–Hartree equation]]. In 1935, his father, William Hartree, offered to do calculations for him. Results with exchange soon followed. Douglas recognised the importance of [[configuration interaction]] that he referred to as \"superposition of configurations\".\nThe first multiconfiguration Hartree–Fock results were published by father, son, and [[Bertha Swirles]] (later Lady Jeffreys) in 1939.\n\nAt Hartree's suggestion, Bertha Swirles proceeded to derive equations with exchange for atoms using the [[Dirac equation]] in 1935. With Hartree's advice, the first relativistic calculations (without exchange) were reported in 1940 by A. O. Williams, a student of [[Robert Bruce Lindsay|R. B. Lindsay]].\n\n==Second World War==\nDuring the Second World War Hartree supervised two computing groups. The first group, for the Ministry of Supply, has been described by [[Jack Howlett]]<ref>{{cite web |\nurl=http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/literature/earlyhistory/p018.htm |\ntitle = Excerpt from letter to Jim Hailstone from Jack Howlett, 11 November 1995 |\naccessdate=1 January 2010}}</ref> as a \"job shop\" for the solution of differential equations. At the outbreak of World War II, the differential analyser at the University\nof Manchester was the only full-size (eight integrator)\ndifferential analyser in the country. Arrangements were made to have the machine available\nfor work in support of the national war effort. In time, the group consisted of four members<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/JackHowlett;SECTION=2031;\n |title       = Jack Howlett\n |accessdate  = 1 January 2010\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060924024850/http://www.dci.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/JackHowlett%3BSECTION%3D2031%3B\n |archivedate = 24 September 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n(front to back: Jack Howlett, Nicholas R. Eyres, J. G. L. Michel; center, Douglas Hartree; right Phyllis Lockett Nicolson). Problems were submitted to the group without information about the source but included the automatic tracking of targets, radio propagation, underwater explosions, heat flow in steel, and the diffusion equation later found to be for isotope separation. The second group was the magnetron research group of\n[[Phyllis Nicolson|Phyllis Lockett Nicolson]], David Copely, and [[Oscar Buneman]].\nThe work was done for the Committee for the Co-ordination of the Valve Development assisting the development of radar. A differential analyser could have been used if more integrators had been available, so Hartree set up his group as three \"CPUs\" to work on mechanical desk calculators in parallel. For a method of solution he selected what is now a classical particle simulation.<ref>{{cite book |\nlast = Buneman | first = Oscar |\ntitle = A History of Scientific Computing |\n year = 1990 | editor = Nash S. G. | publisher= ACM Press | location = New York\n| page = 57 }}</ref>\nHartree never published any of his magnetron research findings in journals though he wrote numerous highly technical secret reports during the war.\n\nIn April 1944 a committee which included Hartree recommended that a mathematical section be set up within the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL). In October this recommendation was put into effect with its first two objectives being the investigation of the possible adaptation of automatic telephone equipment to scientific equipment and the development of electronic computing devices suitable for rapid computing. One suspects that some members already knew of the [[Colossus computer]]. [[John R. Womersley]] ([[Alan Turing|Turing's]] bête noire) was the first Director. In February 1945 he went on a two-month tour of computing installations in the USA, including visiting [[ENIAC]] (still not complete). He became acquainted with drafts of [[John von Neumann|von Neumann's]] famous June 1945 [[EDVAC]] report. About two months later Hartree also went over to see ENIAC, not then publicly known.\n\n==Later life and work==\nIn February 1946, [[Max Newman]] (who had been involved in the [[Colossus computer]]) submitted an application to the [[Royal Society]] for funds to start the task of building a general purpose computer at the [[University of Manchester]]. The Royal Society referred the request to Hartree and [[Charles Galton Darwin|C.G. Darwin]], Director of the NPL, to advise them. Hartree recommended the grant but Darwin opposed it on the grounds that Turing's [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]] at NPL would be sufficient to serve the needs of the country. But Hartree's view won the day and the [[Manchester computers|Manchester developments in computing]] were started.\n\nHartree did further work in [[control system]]s and was involved in the early application of [[digital computer]]s, advising the US military on the use of [[ENIAC]] for calculating ballistics tables. In the summer of 1946 Hartree made his second trip to [[ENIAC]] as an evaluation of its applicability to a broad range of science, when he became the first civilian to program it. For this he selected a problem involving the flow of a compressible fluid over a surface, such as air over the surface of a wing travelling faster than the speed of sound.<ref>{{cite web |\nlast= Ceruzzi |\nurl=http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/Reckoners-ch-5.html |\ntitle = Faster, Faster: The ENIAC | accessdate=1 January 2010 |\nfirst= Paul E. }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1945 or very early in 1946 Hartree briefed [[Maurice Wilkes]] of the [[University of Cambridge]] on the developments in computing in the USA which he had seen. Wilkes, then received an invitation from the [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]] (the builders of ENIAC) to attend a course on electronic computers. Before leaving for this, Hartree was able to brief him more fully on ENIAC. It was on the boat home that Wilkes planned the original design of [[Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator|EDSAC]], which was to become operational in May 1949. Hartree worked closely with Wilkes in developing use of the machine for a wide range of problems and, most importantly, showed users from a number of areas in the university how they could use it in their research work.\n\nHartree returned to Cambridge to take up the post of Plummer professor of mathematical physics in 1946. In October he gave an inaugural lecture entitled \"Calculating Machines: Recent and Prospective Developments and their impact on Mathematical Physics”. This described ENIAC and the work that Hartree had done on it. Even in 1946, two years before stored programming electronic computing became a reality, Hartree saw the need for the use of sub-routines. His inaugural lecture ended with a look at what computers might do. He said: \"..there are, I understand many problems of economic, medical and sociological interest and importance awaiting study which at present cannot be undertaken because of the formidable load of computing involved.\"\n\nOn 7 November 1946 the [[Daily Telegraph]], having interviewed Hartree, quoted him as saying: \"The implications of the machine are so vast that we cannot conceive how they will affect our civilisation. Here you have something which is making one field of human activity 1,000 times faster. In the field of transportation, the equivalent to ACE would be the ability to travel from London to Cambridge ... in five seconds as a regular thing. It is almost unimaginable.\"<ref>{{cite web |\nlast= Rope |\nurl=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/CCS/res/res49.htm#d |\ntitle = Pioneer Profile: Douglas Hartree | accessdate=7 July 2012 |\nfirst= Crispin }}</ref>\n\nHartree's fourth and final major contribution to British computing started in early 1947 when the catering firm of [[J. Lyons & Co.]] in London heard of the ENIAC and sent a small team in the summer of that year to study what was happening in the USA, because they felt that these new computers might be of assistance in the huge amount of administrative and accounting work which the firm had to do. The team met with Col. [[Herman Goldstine]] at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton who wrote to Hartree telling him of their search. As soon as he received this letter, Hartree wrote and invited representatives of Lyons to come to Cambridge for a meeting with him and Wilkes. This led to the development of a commercial version of EDSAC developed by Lyons, called [[LEO (computer)|LEO]], the first computer used for commercial business applications. After Hartree's death, the headquarters of LEO Computers was renamed Hartree House. This illustrates the extent to which Lyons felt that Hartree had contributed to their new venture.\n\nHartree's last famous contribution to computing was an estimate in 1950 of the potential demand for computers, which was much lower than turned out to be the case: \"We have a computer here in Cambridge, one in Manchester and one at the [NPL].

He received a BA in [[philosophy]] from the [[Northwestern University]] of [[Evanston, Illinois]] in 1925, and an MA, also in philosophy, from [[Cornell University]] in 1927. He taught mathematics while preparing for his PhD, which was awarded at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1937.  His thesis dealt with the topic of the [[calculus of variations]].\n\nAfter receiving his doctorate, Householder concentrated on the field of [[mathematical biology]], working with several other researchers with [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] at the [[University of Chicago]].\n\nIn 1946, Householder joined the Mathematics Division of the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], where he was appointed chair in 1948; it is during this period that his interests shift toward [[numerical analysis]]. In 1969 he left ORNL to become Professor of Mathematics at the [[University of Tennessee]], where he eventually became chairman. In 1974 he retired and went to live in  Malibu, California.\n\nHouseholder has contributed in different ways to the organisation of research. He was president of the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] (SIAM) and of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM). He was a member of the redactional committees for ''Psychometrika'', ''Numerische Mathematik'', ''Linear Algebra and Its Applications'', and has been editor in chief of the ''SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis''.

Jack did his best to get a commitment from us, but all we could offer was 'best endeavours'. So Jack worked on the contracts people and we got a contract ... which depended totally on trust between Jack and the authority on the one hand, and Jack and Ferranti &ndash; essentially me &ndash; on the other. It all worked out. It enabled the Atlas Laboratory to get off the ground, and Ferranti to establish the Atlas computer in the market place.\"\n\n== Retirement ==\n\nOn retirement from the Atlas Laboratory, Howlett took up a post with [[International Computers Limited|ICL]] as founding editor of the ICL Technical Journal, a publication designed to give technical information about research and product innovation both inside the company and among its users and research partners.

His early work was on the [[Radon transform]] and he is remembered for [[John's equation]].\n\n==Life and career==\nJohn was born in [[Berlin]], [[Imperial Germany]], the son of Hedwig (née Bürgel) and Hermann Jacobson-John.<ref>According to its biography by {{MacTutor Biography|id=John|title=Fritz John}}.</ref> He studied mathematics from 1929 to 1933 in [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] where he was influenced by [[Richard Courant]], among others. Following [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s rise to power in 1933 \"non-[[Aryan race|aryans]]\" were being expelled from teaching posts, and John, being half Jewish, emigrated from Germany to England.\n\nJohn published his first paper in 1934 on [[Morse theory]]. He was awarded his doctorate in 1934 with a thesis entitled ''Determining a function from its integrals over certain manifolds'' from Göttingen. With Richard Courant's assistance he spent a year at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. During this time he published papers on the Radon transform, a theme to which he would return throughout his career.\n\nJohn was appointed an assistant professor at the [[University of Kentucky]]  in 1935 and he emigrated to the United States, becoming naturalised in 1941. He stayed at Kentucky until 1946, apart from between 1943 and 1945, during which he did war service for the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland]].  In 1946 he moved to [[New York University]], where he remained for the rest of his career.\n\nThroughout the 1940s and 1950s he continued to work on the Radon transform, in particular its application to  linear [[partial differential equation]]s, [[convex geometry]], and the mathematical theory of [[water waves]]. He also worked in [[numerical analysis]] and on ill-posed problems. His textbook on partial differential equations was highly influential and was re-edited many times. He made several contributions to [[convex geometry]], including his famous result that every convex body contains a maximum volume ellipsoid, now called the [[John ellipsoid|John Ellipsoid]].\n\nFrom the mid-1950s on, he started working on the theory of equilibrium nonlinear [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. He coauthored with [[Richard Courant]] the two-volume work ''Introduction to Calculus and Analysis,'' first published in 1965. He retired in 1981, but continued to work on nonlinear waves.\n\n===Honors===\n\nHe received many awards during his career including the [[Birkhoff Prize]] in Applied Mathematics in 1973 and the [[Steele Prize]] in 1982. On 5 May 1985, jointly with [[Olga Arsenievna Oleinik]],<ref>See the relevant entry for further details and information.</ref> he was awarded the [[laurea]] [[honoris causa]] in mathematics by the [[Sapienza University of Rome]].<ref>The complete documentation is collected and commented in reference {{harv|Vernacchia-Galli|1986}}.</ref>\n\n==Publications==\nAll John's published works, excluding monographs and textbooks, are collected in references {{harv|John|1985}} and {{harv|John|1985a}} with remarks and corrections by himself and commentaries by [[Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurdur Helgason]], [[Lars Hörmander]], [[Sergiu Klainerman]], [[Warner T.

Karp]].<ref>{{mathgenealogy|id=106239}}</ref>\nKarmarkar was a post-doctoral research fellow at IBM research(1983), Member of Technical Staff and fellow at Mathematical Sciences Research Center, AT&T Bell Laboratories(1983-1998), professor of mathematics at M.I.T.(1991), at Institute for Advanced study, Princeton(1996), and Homi Bhabha Chair Professor at the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] in [[Mumbai]] from 1998 to 2005. He was briefly the scientific advisor to the chairman of the TATA group. He is currently working on a new architecture for supercomputing.\n\n== Work ==\n\n===Karmarkar's algorithm===\n{{main|Karmarkar's algorithm}}\n\nKarmarkar's algorithm solves [[linear programming]] problems in [[polynomial time]]. These problems are represented by \"n\" variables and \"m\" constraints. The previous method of solving these problems consisted of problem representation by an \"x\" sided solid with \"y\" vertices, where the solution was approached by traversing from vertex to vertex. Karmarkar's novel method approaches the solution by cutting through the above solid in its traversal. Consequently, complex optimization problems are solved much faster using the Karmarkar algorithm. A practical example of this efficiency is the solution to a complex problem in communications network optimization where the solution time was reduced from weeks to days.  His algorithm thus enables faster business and policy decisions. Karmarkar's algorithm has stimulated the development of several [[interior point method]]s, some of which are used in current implementations of linear program solvers.\n\n====Galois geometry====\nAfter working on the [[interior point method|Interior Point Method]], Karmarkar worked on a new [[computer architecture|architecture]] for [[supercomputing]], based on concepts from [[finite geometry|finite]] [[Galois geometry|geometry]], especially [[projective geometry]] over [[finite fields]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&dl=GUIDE&id=126029 |title=A new parallel architecture for sparse matrix computation based on finite projective geometries |work=Proceedings of the 1991 ACM/IEEE conference on Supercomputing |last=Karmarkar |first=Narendra}}</ref><ref>Karmarkar, N.

Earlier, he worked on computational solutions of problems emerging in theoretical [[physics]]. He is also known for his contributions to [[economics]], specifically for proposing corrections and calculating price formation for the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Later, Kronrod gave his fortune and life to [[medicine]] to care for terminal [[cancer]] patients.  Kronrod is remembered for his captivating personality and was admired as a student, teacher and leader.\n\nHe is the author of several well known books, including ''\"Nodes and weights of quadrature formulas. Sixteen-place tables\"'' and ''\"Conversations on Programming\"''. A biographer wrote Kronrod gave ideas \"away left and right, quite honestly being convinced that the authorship belongs to the one who implements them.\"\n\n==Education==\nKronrod was born in [[Moscow]]. Growing up, he studied math with D. O. Shklyarsky in school and in 1938 entered the [[MSU Department of Mechanics and Mathematics|Department of Mechanics and Mathematics]] at [[Moscow State University]]. He did his first independent mathematical work as a freshman with Professor [[Alexander Gelfond|A. O. Gel'fond]]. Kronrod was honored as a student with the first prize of the [[List of Mathematical Societies|Moscow Mathematical Society]] and was the only person to win the prize twice.\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he was rejected for military service because at the time graduate level students were exempt. They did help to build trenches around Moscow, and when he returned, Kronrod reapplied and was accepted. He served twice, and was injured twice. He was awarded several medals, including [[Order of the Red Star]] and [[Order of the Patriotic War]]. The second injury in 1943 hospitalised him for a year and he was discharged from the army in 1944.<ref name=\"halfcentury\">{{cite book\n|first=Anatoli G. \n|last=Vitushkin\n|authorlink=Anatoli Georgievich Vitushkin\n|editor1-first=A.

During next four years he continued his studies at the University, simultaneously working at the [[Kurchatov Institute|Atomic Energy Kurchatov Institute]].<ref name=\"halfcentury\" /> There he chose to leave pure mathematics and pursue computational mathematics.\n\nIn his last undergraduate year, Kronrod studied with [[Nikolai Luzin]] the teacher of many of the Soviet Union's finest scientists. Kronrod and [[Georgy Adelson-Velsky]] were colleagues and Luzin's last students. Like his teacher, Kronrod led a series of supplementary seminars for younger mathematics students. Unusually for the time, instead of students merely reporting on the content of courses, Kronrod made his students undertake training exercises, even proving basic theorems themselves. The preparation required for this reduced the numbers of participants, but those who remained, including [[Robert Adol'fovich Minlos|R. A. Minlos]] and [[Anatoli Georgievich Vitushkin|A. G. Vitushkin]], derived great benefit. Vitushkin described him as \"witty and friendly\". At his own request, Kronrod was called simply \"Sasha\" by his students.<ref name=\"halfcentury\" /> He was considered to be a prophet in his field. The Kronod circle met between 1946-1953.  Kronrod's position was formally at the Institute of Physics, which meant that his students had to register with other advisers, accounting for the decline of the circle into a series of friendly meetings.<ref name=\"halfcentury\" /> When he defended thesis in 1949, his committee including [[Mstislav Keldysh|M. V. Keldish]], [[Andrey Kolmogorov|A. N. Kolmogorov]] and [[Dmitrii Evgenevich Menshov|D. E. Men'shov]] bypassed the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree and awarded him a [[Doctor of Sciences]] degree in the physical-mathematical sciences.\n\nKronrod taught at the [[List of institutions of higher learning in Russia|Moscow Pedagogical Institute]]. [[Yevgeniy Landis]] was a student, early collaborator and one of his biographers.\n\nDuring the 1960s he worked on mathematics education in high schools by organizing courses and teaching methods.\n\n==Computer science==\n<!--[[File:Kronrod-book.jpg|thumb|180px|left|alt=book cover with a small portrait of the author above a lot of Cryllic writing|Cover of ''Conversations on Programming'' by Aleksandr S. Kronrod]]-->\nKronod played an important role in building the first major Russian computer, ''Relay Computer RVM-1'', though he liked to say his colleague N.I. Bessonov was the sole inventor.\n\nAt the Moscow [[Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics]] (ITEF or ITEP) during 1950-1955 Kronod collaborated with physicists, among them [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]] and [[Lev Landau]]. For providing theoretical physics with numerical solutions he received the [[USSR State Prize|Stalin Prize]] and an [[Order of the Red Banner]].\n\nIn 1955 he first used an electronic computer at the [[Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky|Krzhizhanovskii]] laboratory of the Institute of Energy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], later called the Institute for Electronic Control Machines.\n\nHe directed the mathematics division of ITEP. They could surpass the results achieved outside the USSR by far faster machines, in the case of [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], five hundred times faster. Requests for computation were analyzed and sometimes solved by other means. The equipment was maintained and there were almost no hardware malfunctions. A policy said finished programs had to be re-examined if they ran for more than ten minutes.\n\n<div style=\"margin:1% 0 2% 2%; padding:1%; width:30%; border:1px solid #bbb; float:right; font-family:monospace; font-size:90%\">{{cquote|\"program written by (a male name)\", \"coded by (a female name)\", \"coding checked by (a female name)\", \"punched by (a female name)\", \"punching checked by (a female name)\" }} <span style=\"font:90% sans-serif;\">Excerpt from the form for ITEP mathematics programs, in ''\"Remembering A. S. Kronrod\"'' by [[E.M. Landis]] and [[Isaak Yaglom|I.M. Yaglom]].</span></div>\n\nKronrod rewarded accuracy. He held what today are controversial views on the role of gender in computing. He employed women in ITEP's coding and card punching groups, believing that female computing staff members are more accurate than males. He also believed that in order to think, the male scientists qualified to use the computers needed to be free from operating them. The women did the input and quality assurance side by side with the men and for each month without an error received a 20% raise in salary.\n\nHe applied computing resources to the USSR [[planned economy]] and to [[cancer research]]. He served with [[Leonid Kantorovich]] and others on a cabinet ministry commission and oversaw the computation of the country's material expenditures to correct price formation. Kronrod's student V. D. Belkin further developed this work. At the Gertsen cancer research institute during the 1960s, with his student P. E. Kunin he studied the differential diagnostics of [[lung cancer]] and [[pneumonia]] to help doctors determine when surgery is needed.\n\n==Artificial intelligence==\nKronrod had a profound interest in [[artificial intelligence]] known in the USSR at the time as heuristic programming. He is well known for saying, \"chess is the ''[[Drosophila]]'' of artificial intelligence.\" This quote graces the top of the [[American Association for Artificial Intelligence]] \"Games & Puzzles\" chess home page.<ref>{{cite web|author= |year= |title=Chess |work=American Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) |url=http://www.aaai.org/AITopics/html/chess.html |accessdate=19 December 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004152042/http://www.aaai.org/aitopics/html/chess.html |archivedate=4 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1965 ITEP challenged and in 1966-1967 defeated the American chess program [[Kotok-McCarthy]]. The developers included Adelson-Velsky who used [[Aleksandr Brudno|A.L. Brudno]]'s adversarial [[search algorithm]] and a \"general recursive search scheme\" by Kronrod.

The physics users at ITEP complained, thinking that the lab was being used for game playing, when the division was writing the [[Crazy Eights]] card game and [[chess]] trying to teach a machine to think.\n\n==End of a career==\nWhen the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] reprimanded him in 1968 for cosigning a letter with many mathematicians in defense of the mathematician and logician [[Alexander Esenin-Volpin]], a son of the poet [[Sergei Esenin]], the physicists were able to oust him from ITEP. He was also fired from his professorship.<ref name=Brudno>{{cite journal | author=[http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/ Brudno, Michael] | title=Competitions, Controversies, and Computer Chess | date=May 2000 | url=http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/essays/cchess.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2006-12-19}}</ref>\n\nHe then directed the mathematics laboratory at the Central Scientific Research Institute of Patent Information (CNIIPI) where he proposed [[patent]] reform to stimulate inventions. After gaining support he lost this position to an unsympathetic director. His last position was heading a Central Geophysical Expedition laboratory that processed drilling data where he made calculations for gas and [[oil exploration]], but he was not challenged by this work. He re-examined his goals and soon changed course.\n\n==Medicine==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\nKronrod decided that his best work was to help others and most importantly the terminally ill. He spent his fortune developing ''milil'' from a sour milk extract for cancer patients, to fill a shortage of ''anabol'', an expensive drug developed in small quantities by his acquaintance Bogdanov in Bulgaria. He was promised but never acquired an [[animal testing]] laboratory so he tested the medicine on himself. Kronrod had no medical degree but he was well-informed in medicine. ''Milil'' was a last resort for seriously ill patients and was administered by physicians in one case in a hospital ward A.A. Vishnevskiy reserved for treatments by Kronrod's method. Kronrod himself never gave the drug to patients and through physicians gave it away free. The drug was unapproved and a criminal case was brought against him. He regained his research records when a relative of the plaintiff required ''milil'' for treatment and the case was dismissed.\n\nHe slowly recovered when a stroke took his speech and ability to read and write but was forced to resign at the Central Geophysical Expedition and stop all work on math. He saved his own life by asking to be soaked in a tub of very hot water for several hours after a second stroke. He died on 6 October 1986 of a third stroke.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal |author=[[Yevgeniy Landis|E. M. Landis]], I. M.

Károly Lőwy and Adél Hahn. Lanczos' [[Ph.D.]] thesis (1921) was on [[relativity theory]]. He sent his thesis copy to [[Einstein]], and Einstein wrote back, saying: \n\"I studied your paper as far as my present overload allowed. I believe I may say this much: this does involve competent and original brainwork, on the basis of which a doctorate should be obtainable ... I gladly accept the honorable dedication.\"<ref name=BG>Barbara Gellai (2010) ''The Intrinsic Nature of Things: the life and science of Cornelius Lanczos'', [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|978-0-8218-5166-1}}</ref>{{rp|20}}\n\nIn 1924 he discovered an [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equation]] representing a cylindrically symmetric rigidly rotating configuration of [[fluid solution|dust]] particles. This was later rediscovered by [[Willem Jacob van Stockum]] and is known today as the [[van Stockum dust]]. It is one of the simplest known exact solutions in general relativity and is regarded as an important example, in part because it exhibits [[closed timelike curve]]s.\nLanczos served as assistant to [[Albert Einstein]] during the period of 1928–29.<ref name=BG/>{{rp|27}}\n\nIn 1927 Lanczos married Maria Rupp. He was offered a one-year visiting professorship from [[Purdue University]]. For a dozen years (1927–39) Lanzos split his life between two continents. His wife Maria Rupp stayed with Lanczos' parents in Székesfehérvár year-around while Lanczos went to Purdue for half the year, teaching graduate students matrix mechanics and tensor analysis. In 1933 his son Elmar was born; Elmar came to [[Lafayette, Indiana]] with his father in August 1939, just before WW II broke out.<ref name =BG/>{{rp|41 & 53}} Maria was too ill to travel and died several weeks later from tuberculosis. When the Nazis purged Hungary of Jews in 1944, of Lanczos' family, only his sister and a nephew survived. Elmar married, moved to Seattle and raised two sons.  When Elmar looked at his own firstborn son, he said: \"For me, it proves that Hitler did not win.\"\n\nDuring the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] era, Lanczos came under suspicion for possible [[communism|communist]] links.<ref name=BG/>{{rp|89}} In 1952, he left the U.S. and moved to the School of Theoretical Physics at the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] in Ireland, where he succeeded [[Erwin Schrödinger]]<ref>{{cite book|title=The Lanczos Method: Evolution and Application|author=Louis Komzsik|page=79|publisher=[[SIAM]]|year=2003}}</ref> and stayed until 1968.<ref>[https://www.dias.ie/?s=Lanczos&submit= Cornelius Lanczos] at [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]]</ref>\n\nIn 1956 Lanczos published ''Applied Analysis''. The topics covered include \"algebraic equations, matrices and eigenvalue problems, large scale linear systems, harmonic analysis, data analysis, quadrature and power expansions...illustrated by numerical examples worked out in detail.\" The contents of the book are stylized \"parexic analysis lies between [[mathematical analysis|classical analysis]] and [[numerical analysis]]: it is roughly the theory of approximation by finite (or truncated infinite) [[algorithm]]s.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=Todd, John|authorlink=John Todd (computer scientist)|title=Review: ''Applied Analysis'', by C.

C. Danielson]] on what is now called the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT, 1940), but the significance of his discovery was not appreciated at the time, and today the FFT is credited to [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm|Cooley and Tukey]] (1965). (As a matter of fact, similar claims can be made for several other mathematicians, including [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gauss and the History of the Fast Fourier Transform|author1=Michael T. Heideman |author2=Don H. Johnson |author3=C. Sidney Burrus |page=14|journal=IEEE ASSP Magazine|date=October 1984}}</ref>). Lanczos was the one who introduced [[Chebyshev polynomials]] to numerical computing. He discovered the [[diagonalizable matrix]].\n\nWorking in Washington DC at the U.S. [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Bureau of Standards]] after 1949, Lanczos developed a number of techniques for mathematical calculations using digital computers, including:\n* the [[Lanczos algorithm]] for finding [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector, and eigenspace|eigenvalues]] of large symmetric matrices,\n* the [[Lanczos approximation]] for the gamma function,\n* the [[conjugate gradient method]] for solving [[systems of linear equations]].\n\nIn 1962, Lanczos showed that the [[Weyl tensor]], which plays a fundamental role in general relativity, can be obtained from a [[tensor potential]] that is now called the [[Lanczos tensor|Lanczos potential]].\n\n[[Lanczos resampling]] is based on a windowed [[sinc function]] as a practical upsampling filter approximating the ideal sinc function. Lanczos resampling is widely used in video up-sampling for digital zoom applications and [[image scaling]].\n\nBooks such as ''The Variational Principles of Mechanics'' (1949)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lewis, D.

His most influential work lies in CFD, a field he helped modernized from 1970 onward. An appraisal of his early work has been given by C. Hirsch (1979)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/jcph.1997.5757|title=Introduction to \"Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme. V. A Second-Order Sequel to Godunov's Method\"|journal=Journal of Computational Physics|volume=135|issue=2|pages=227–228|year=1997|last1=Hirsch|first1=Ch.}}</ref>\n\nAn astrophysicist by education, van Leer made lasting contributions to CFD in his five-part article series “Towards the Ultimate Conservative Difference Scheme (1972-1979),” where he extended Godunov’s finite-volume scheme to the second order (MUSCL). Also in the series, he developed non-oscillatory interpolation using limiters, an approximate Riemann solver, and discontinuous-Galerkin schemes for unsteady advection. Since joining the University of Michigan’s Aerospace Engineering Department (1986), he has worked on convergence acceleration by local preconditioning and multigrid relaxation for Euler and Navier-Stokes problems, unsteady adaptive grids, space-environment modeling, atmospheric flow modeling, extended hydrodynamics for rarefied flows, and discontinuous-Galerkin methods. He retired in 2012, forced to give up research because of progressive blindness.\n\nThroughout his career, van Leer's work has had interdisciplinary characteristic. Starting from astrophysics, he first made an impact on weapons research, followed by aeronautics, then space-weather modeling, atmospheric modeling, surface-water modeling and automotive engine modeling, to name the most important fields.\n\n== Personal interests ==\n\n[[File:Van Leer with piano.jpg|thumb|van Leer playing piano at Pierpont Commons, University of Michigan]]\n\nVan Leer is also an accomplished musician, playing the piano at the age of 5 and composing at 7. His musical education includes two years at the Royal Conservatory for Music of The Hague, Netherlands. As a pianist he was featured in the Winter '96 issue of Michigan Engineering (Engineering and the Arts). As a carillonist, he has played the carillon of the Central Campus Burton Tower on many football Saturdays. He was the world's first and only CJ (carillon-jockey) based on the North Campus carillon, live streaming from the Lurie Tower.\n\nIn 1993 he gave a full-hour recital on the carillon of the City Hall in Leiden, the town of his alma mater. Van Leer enjoys improvising in the Dutch carillon-playing style; one of his improvisations is included on a 1998 CD featuring both University of Michigan's carillons. His carillon composition \"Lament\" was published in the UM School of Music's carillon music series on the occasion of the Annual Congress of the Guild of Carilloneurs in North America, Ann Arbor, June 2002. A flute composition by van Leer was performed twice in 1997 by University of Michigan Professor Leone Buyse.\n\n==Research work==\n\nBram van Leer was a doctoral student in astrophysics at Leiden Observatory (1966–1970) when he got interested in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for the sake of solving cosmic flow problems. His first major result in CFD<ref name=\"thesis\">{{cite thesis|last=van Leer|first=B.|type=Ph.D.|date=1970|title=A Choice of Difference Schemes for Ideal Compressible Flow|publisher=Sterrewacht, Leiden, The Netherlands.}}</ref> was the formulation of the upwind numerical flux function for a hyperbolic system of conservation laws:\n<math> F^\\hbox{up} = \\frac{1}{2} (F_j + F_{j+1} ) - \\frac{1}{2}|A|_{j+\\frac{1}{2}} (u_{j+1} - u_j).</math>\n\nHere the matrix <math>|A|</math> appears for the first time in CFD, defined as the matrix that has the same eigenvectors as the flux Jacobian <math>A</math>, but the corresponding eigenvalues are the moduli of those of <math>A</math>. The subscript <math>j+\\frac{1}{2}</math> indicates a representative or average value on the interval <math>(x_j,x_{j+1})</math>; it was no less than 10 years later before [[Philip L. Roe]] first presented his much used averaging formulas.\n\nNext, van Leer succeeded in circumventing Godunov's barrier theorem (i.e., a monotonicity preserving advection scheme cannot be better than first-order accurate) by limiting the second-order term in the Lax-Wendroff scheme as a function of the non-smoothness of the numerical solution itself. This is a non-linear technique even for a linear equation. Having discovered this basic principle, he planned a series of three articles titled \"Towards the ultimate conservative difference scheme\", which advanced from scalar non-conservative but non-oscillatory (part I<ref>B. van Leer. Towards the ultimate conservative difference scheme I. The quest of monotonicity. In Lecture Notes in Physics. Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Numerical Methods in Fluid Mechanics, pages 163–168.

The finite-difference schemes for the Euler equations turned out to be unattractive because of their many terms; a switch to the finite-volume formulation completely cleared this up and led to Part IV<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0021-9991(77)90095-X|title=Towards the ultimate conservative difference scheme.

In Part II two limiters are presented, later called by van Leer \"double minmod\" (after Osher's \"minmod\" limiter) and its smoothed version \"harmonic\"; the latter limiter is sometimes referred to in the literature as \"van Leer's limiter.\" Part IV, \"A new approach to numerical convection,\" describes a group of 6 second- and third-order schemes that includes two discontinuous-Galerkin schemes with exact time integration. Van Leer was not the only one to break Godunov's barrier using nonlinear limiting; similar techniques were developed independently around the same time by Boris<ref name=\"BorisBookFCT1\">{{Citation\n|last1=Boris\n|first1=Jay P.\n|last2=Book\n|first2=David L.\n|title=Flux-corrected transport.

In 1988, he embarked on a very large project, to achieve steady Euler solutions in O(N) operations by a purely explicit methodology. There were three crucial components to this strategy:\n1. Optimally smoothing multistage single-grid schemes for advections\n2. Local preconditioning of the Euler equations\n3. Semi-coarsened multigrid relaxation\n\nThe first subject was developed in collaboration with his doctoral student, C.H. Tai.<ref name=\"1989_Buffalo\">{{Citation\n|last1=van Leer\n|first1=B.\n|last2=Tai\n|first2=C.-H.\n|last3=Powell\n|first3=K. G.\n|title=Design of Optimally Smoothing Multi-Stage Schemes for the Euler Equations\n|journal=AIAA Paper 89-1933-CP\n|date=1989\n}}</ref> The second subject was needed to make the Euler equations look as much scalar as possible.

It turned out that applying the preconditioning to an Euler discretization required a reformulation of the numerical flux function for the sake of preserving accuracy at low Mach numbers. Combining the optimal single grid schemes with the preconditioned Euler discretization was achieved by doctoral student J. F. Lynn.<ref name=\"1995_SanDiego\">{{Citation\n|last1=van Leer\n|first1=B.\n|last2=Lynn\n|first2=J.\n|title=A semi-coarsened multi-grid-solver for the Euler equations with local preconditioning\n|journal=12th AIAA Computational Fluid Dynamics Conference, AIAA Paper 95-1667-CP\n|pages=242–252\n|date=1995\n}}</ref> The same strategy for the Navier-Stokes discretization was pursued by D.

A. Mulder (Mulder 1989). This technique is needed to damp certain combinations of high- and low-frequency modes when the grid is aligned with the flow.\n\nIn 1994, van Leer teamed up with Darmofal, a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Michigan at the time, to finish the project. The goal of the project was first reached by Darmofal and Siu (Darmofal, and Siu 1999), and later was done more efficiently by van Leer and Nishikawa.<ref name=\"2003_JCP\">{{Citation\n|last1=Nishikawa\n|first1=H.\n|last2=van Leer\n|first2=B.\n|title=Optimal Multigrid Convergence by Hyperbolic/Elliptic Splitting\n|journal= Journal of Computational Physics\n|volume=190\n|issue=1\n|pages=52–63\n|date=2003\n|doi=10.1016/s0021-9991(03)00253-5\n|bibcode = 2003JCoPh.190...52N }}</ref>\n\nWhile the multi-grid project was going on, van Leer worked on two more subjects: multi-dimensional Riemann solvers,<ref name=\"1993_Levy\">{{Citation\n|last1=Levy\n|first1=D.

There is, however, a narrow domain in the (M, Re)-plane where the preconditioned equations admit a growing mode. In practice, such a mode, if it were to arise, should be damped by the time-marching scheme, e.g., an implicit scheme.\n\nIn the last decade of his career, van Leer occupied himself with extended hydrodynamics and discontinuous-Galerkin method. The goal of the first project was to describe rarefied flow up to and including intermediate Knudsen numbers (Kn~1) by a hyperbolic-relaxation system. This works well for subsonic flows and weak shock waves, but stronger shock waves acquire the wrong internal structure.<ref name=\"2005_Suzuki\">{{Citation\n|last1=Suzuki\n|first1=Y.\n|last2=van Leer\n|first2=B.\n|title=Application of the 10-Moment Model to MEMS Flows\n|journal=AIAA Paper 2005-1398\n|date=2005\n}}</ref><ref name=\"2009_Suzuki\">{{Citation\n|last1=Suzuki\n|first1=Y.\n|last2=Khieu\n|first2=H.

On this occasion, van Leer presented a plenary lecture titled, “History of CFD Part II,” which covers the period from 1970 to 1995. Below is the poster van Leer and his doctoral student Lo designed for this occasion.\n\n[[File:van Leer and Lo's Poster on CFD History.jpg|thumb|upright=3|center|The tableau is an allegory on the genesis of modern CFD in the period 1970-1985, specifically: the development of high-resolution methods (non-oscillatory methods of greater-than-first-order accuracy), and their ultimate adoption by the aerospace community.\nWe see an exotic landscape dominated by a great pyramid. Three men are trying to reach its top by different means: Jay Boris (hammer en chisel), Bram van Leer (rope) and Vladimir Kolgan (ladder); the latter's untimely death in 1978 made him an unknown even in Russia. Note that the pyramid is also a giant capital Greek delta, symbol of the finite difference that pervades the equations of CFD. Keeper of the gate is John von Neumann, the father of CFD.\nFrom the prehistory of CFD are the busts, on the far left, of Richard Courant, Kurt Friedrichs and Hans Lewy, whose initials we know so well. On the far right we find, on beach chairs, Peter Lax and Sergei Godunov, giants of numerical analysis from the generation following Von Neumann. They relax while a younger generation struggles to raise the state of the art in CFD.\nIn the foreground, going from left to right, we first encounter Bob MacCormack who, in the late 1960s, adapted the second-order Lax-Wendroff method to aeronautical uses, but was not able to tame its numerical oscillations. Next, Phil Roe, perhaps contemplating his approximate Riemann solver or Superbee limiter. Past the gate, Stan Osher and Ami Harten (died 1994), likely discussing TVD or ENO techniques. The latter three, together with van Leer, were most influential in getting high-resolution methods accepted in aerospace engineering; much of the technology transition took place at ICASE, NASA LaRC.\nLast but not least, in the airplane, Antony Jameson, who went his own way, developing a suite of highly efficient CFD codes for steady aeronautics.]]\n\n== Education and training==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n* 1963 – Candidate Astronomy, Leiden State University\n* 1966 – Doctorandus Astrophysics, Leiden State University\n* 1970 – Ph.D. Astrophysics, Leiden State University, 1970\n* 1970–72 – Miller Fellow Astrophysics, University of California Berkeley\n\n== Professional experience ==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n* 2012–Present – Arthur B.

His other affiliations include the [[University of Waterloo]] and [[University of Guelph]].\n\n== Education and career ==\n\nHe earned his Ph.D. at [[Kiev University|Kiev State University]] in the late 1980s. According to the Mathematics Genealogy Project, his scientific ancestors include [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|A. Tikhonov]] and other outstanding mathematicians and scientists.\n\nBefore moving to Canada as a [[Canada Research Chair|Tier I Canada Research Chair]], Melnik gained a worldwide reputation in mathematical modelling and applied mathematics,<ref name=\"TechTalk\">Rindy Metcalf, New professor brings ideas, [http://www.thetechtalk.org/ The Tech Talk], January 23, 2004.</ref> while working in Europe, Australia, and the United States.\n\n== Awards and honors ==\n\nMelnik is a recipient of many fellowships and awards,<ref>Af Bente Dalgaard, At bringe verden til SDU, [http://www.sdu.dk/Nyheder/Tidsskrifter/Ny_viden Ny Viden], No. 1, January 2007.</ref> including the Andersen fellowship at [[University of Southern Denmark|Syddansk Universitet]] in Denmark, the Isaac Newton Institute visiting fellowship at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England, the [[Ikerbasque]] Fellowship in Spain, the fellowship of the Institute of Advanced Studies at the [[University of Bologna]] in Italy, and others. He is a life member of the Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society. Melnik is the director of the Laboratory of Mathematical Modeling for New Technologies ([http://www.m2netlab.wlu.ca M<sup>2</sup>NeT Lab]) in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.\n\n== Research ==\n\nIn his early works Melnik studied fully coupled hyperbolic-elliptic models applied in dynamic [[piezoelectricity]] theory. Such models, originally proposed by [[Woldemar Voigt|W. Voigt]] in 1910, have found many applications, and Melnik was the first to rigorously prove well-posedness of a large class of such models in the dynamic case.<ref>Masayuki Akamatsu & Gen Nakamura,  [http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/00036811.asp Applicable Analysis], 81, 2002.</ref> The piezoelectric effect itself, captured by such models, was discovered in 1880 by [[Pierre Curie|Pierre]] and [[Jacques Curie]]. Mathematical models describing this effect in time-dependent situations are based on initial-boundary value problems for coupled systems of [[partial differential equation]]s. The mathematical and computational analysis of such coupled systems has been in the focus of many Melnik's works. In the 1990s he extended his scientific interests to applications of mathematics in semiconductor and other advanced technologies, including smart and bio-inspired materials technologies, where in collaboration with A. Roberts and their students he pioneered computationally efficient low-dimensional reductions of complex time-dependent nonlinear mathematical models. His other important contributions at that time included fundamental problems in control theory and dynamic system evolution, as well as a range of problems in industrial & applied mathematics and numerical analysis.\n\nMelnik is an expert in computational and applied mathematics with a number of important results in the coupled field theory as applied in physics, biology, and engineering. He is a leading computational analyst,<ref name=\"TechTalk\"/> well known for his contributions to the analysis of coupled multiscale phenomena, processes, and systems. His recent significant contributions are in the analysis of mutual influence between quantum and classical effects in complex systems, in particular in the study of coupled effects in low-dimensional nanostructures,<ref>[http://nanotechweb.org/cws/article/lab/38345 Unraveling coupled multiscale phenomena in quantum dot nanostructures ], Nanotechnology, 20, 125402, 2009</ref> as well as in bio-inspired engineering and biological systems.<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1478-3975/labtalk-article/43453 Coarse-graining RNA nanostructures for MD simulations ], Physical Biology, 7, 036001, 2010.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathGenealogy|58217}}\n* Laurier Science Research Centre, [http://www.m2netlab.wlu.ca/ M<sup>2</sup>NeT Laboratory]\n* Wilfrid Laurier University, [http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=144&f_id=1 Faculty of Science]\n* Research at the [http://gwp.on.ca/research/index.html Guelph-Waterloo Institute of Physics]\n* Roderick Melnik at the [http://directory.trra.ca/DirectorySearch.mvc/ContactProfile/NAN4153 TRRA Accelerate Innovation]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Melnik, Roderick}}\n[[Category:Australian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Soviet mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Wilfrid Laurier University faculty]]\n[[Category:Canadian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Numerical analysts]]\n[[Category:Mathematical physicists]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]"

In Munich he studied mathematics under, among others, [[Oskar Perron]] and [[Constantin Carathéodory]].  In 1933, as a so-called \"[[Who is a Jew?#Nazism|half-Jew]]\" in the terminology of the new [[National Socialist]] government of Germany, he sought to emigrate to the [[Soviet Union]].  From 1934 to 1937 he worked as a theoretical physicist in the University of [[Dnipro]] (then Dnipropetrovsk).  In 1938 he went, via the Institute for Astrophysics in [[Prague]], to [[Norway]], where he became an assistant to [[Egil Hylleraas]] at the [[University of Oslo]].  He also briefly worked at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|Technical University of Trondheim]] with [[Johan Peter Holtsmark|Johan Holtsmark]], who was building a [[Van de Graaff generator]] there.  With the [[German occupation of Norway]] he fled to [[Uppsala]] in [[Sweden]].  In 1941 the Nazi German state stripped him of his [[German citizenship]], and in 1943 recognition of his doctorate was revoked. He became a Norwegian citizen in 1947.<ref>B.

In Norway he built up his research group in numerical analysis, and part of the introduction of digital computers, such as GIER, the first computer at Trondheim.  From 1968 he held the Chair for Mathematical Methods in Natural Sciences and Numerics at [[Heidelberg University]].

Fahroo]], W. Kang and Q. Gong, Ross proved a series of results on the convergence of pseudospectral discretizations of optimal control problems.<ref name=\"converge:summ\">W. Kang, I. M. Ross, Q. Gong, Pseudospectral optimal control and its convergence theorems, Analysis and Design of Nonlinear Control Systems, Springer, pp. 109–124, 2008.</ref>  Ross and his coworkers showed that the [[Legendre pseudospectral method|Legendre]] and [[Chebyshev pseudospectral method|Chebyshev]] pseudospectral discretizations converge to an optimal solution of a problem under the mild condition of boundedness of variations.<ref name=\"converge:summ\"/>\n\n==Software contributions==\nIn 2001, Ross created [[DIDO (optimal control)|DIDO]], a software package for solving [[optimal control]] problems. Powered by [[Ross–Fahroo pseudospectral method|pseudospectral methods]], Ross created a user-friendly set of objects that required no knowledge of his theory to run DIDO.

The family later moved to [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]], where his father died early (in 1864).\n\nIn 1880, he received his Ph.D. in mathematics at [[Berlin]], where he studied under [[Karl Weierstrass]].  In 1886, he became a professor at the [[University of Hanover|Technische Hochschule Hannover]] in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]].\n\nHis interests included mathematics, [[spectroscopy]], [[geodesy]], and [[astrophysics]].  In addition to pure mathematics, he did  experimental work studying [[spectral line]]s of various elements (together with [[Heinrich Kayser]]), and was very interested in the application of this work to [[astronomical spectroscopy]].\n\nIn 1904, on the initiative of [[Felix Klein]] he received a call to the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen]], which he accepted. There he remained until his retirement in 1925.\n===Family===\nHis daughter [[Iris Runge|Iris]] also became a mathematician and his son [[Wilhelm Runge|Wilhelm]] was an early developer of radar.

He earned his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in physics from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1937 and a [[Ph.D.]] in Mathematics from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] in 1954. In between these two, Shanks worked at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] and the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]], first as a physicist and then as a mathematician.

However, his [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] and junior years were marred with mediocre grades, mostly Bs, Cs and even an F in [[nuclear physics]].  However, with some luck, Smale was accepted as a graduate student at the University of Michigan's mathematics department.  Yet again, Smale performed poorly in his first years, earning a C average as a graduate student.  It was only when the department chair, [[Theophil Henry Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]], threatened to kick Smale out that he began to work hard.<ref>{{YouTube|LmpPUjOeMGI}}</ref>  Smale finally earned his [[Ph.D.]] in 1957, under [[Raoul Bott]].\n\nSmale began his career as an instructor at the college at the [[University of Chicago]]. In 1958, he astounded the mathematical world with a proof of a [[sphere eversion]]. He then cemented his reputation with a proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]] for all dimensions greater than or equal to 5, published in 1961; in 1962 he generalized the ideas in a 107-page paper that established the [[h-cobordism theorem]].\n\nAfter having made great strides in [[topology]], he then turned to the study of [[dynamical systems]], where he made significant advances as well.  His first contribution is the [[Horseshoe map|Smale horseshoe]] that started significant research in dynamical systems.  He also outlined a research program carried out by many others. Smale is also known for injecting [[Morse theory]] into mathematical [[economics]], as well as recent explorations of various theories of [[computation]].\n\nIn 1998 he compiled a list of 18 problems in [[mathematics]] to be solved in the 21st century, known as [[Smale's problems]]. This list was compiled in the spirit of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s famous list of problems produced in 1900. In fact, Smale's list contains some of the original Hilbert problems, including the [[Riemann hypothesis]] and the second half of [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]], both of which are still unsolved.  Other famous problems on his list include the [[Poincaré conjecture]] (now a theorem, proved by [[Grigori Perelman]]), the [[P = NP problem]], and the [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness|Navier–Stokes equations]], all of which have been designated [[Millennium Prize Problems]] by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].\n\nEarlier in his career, Smale was involved in controversy over remarks he made regarding his work habits while proving the higher-dimensional Poincaré conjecture. He said that his best work had been done \"on the beaches of Rio.\"<ref>He discovered the famous [[Smale horseshoe map]] on a beach in [[Leme (Rio de Janeiro)|Leme]], [[Rio de Janeiro]].  See: S.&nbsp;Smale (1996), [http://math.berkeley.edu/~smale/biblio/chaos.ps Chaos: Finding a Horseshoe on the Beaches of Rio].</ref>  This led to the withholding of his grant money from the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]].  He has been politically active in various movements in the past, such as the [[Free Speech movement]] and the movement against the Vietnam War.  At one time he was [[subpoena]]ed by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].\n\nIn 1960 Smale was appointed an associate professor of mathematics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], moving to a professorship at [[Columbia University]] the following year. In 1964 he returned to a professorship at UC Berkeley where he has spent the main part of his career. He retired from UC Berkeley in 1995 and took up a post as professor at the [[City University of Hong Kong]]. He also amassed over the years one of the finest private mineral collections in existence. Many of Smale's mineral specimens can be seen in the book—''The Smale Collection: Beauty in Natural Crystals''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lithographie.org/bookshop/the_smale_collection.htm|title=Lithographie LTD|author=|date=|website=www.lithographie.org}}</ref>\n\nSince 2002 Smale is a Professor at the [[Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago]]; starting August 1, 2009, he is also a Distinguished University Professor at the [[City University of Hong Kong]].<ref>[http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~smale/vita.html Stephen Smale Vita.]  Accessed November 18, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Smale was awarded the [[Wolf Prize]] in mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huji.ac.il/cgi-bin/dovrut/dovrut_search_eng_dev.pl?mesge116895485932688760|title=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem - Division of Marketing & Communication|author=|date=|website=www.huji.ac.il}}</ref>\n\n== Important publications ==\n* {{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Smale | title=Generalized Poincaré's conjecture in dimensions greater than four | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | volume=74 | year=1961 | pages=391–406 | mr=0137124 | doi=10.2307/1970239 | issue=2}}\n* {{cite news | first=Stephen | last=Smale | title=Differentiable dynamical systems | mr=0228014 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | volume=73 | year=1967 | pages=747–817 | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1967-11798-1}}\n* F.

He and his family moved to the UK due to [[World War II]].\nZienkiewicz studied in the early 1940s at [[Imperial College London]] for an undergraduate BSc (Hons) degree in [[civil engineering]] which he obtained in 1943 with first class honours. Then, after being offered a scholarship, he stayed for two more years at Imperial College to carry out research on dams under the supervision of Professors [[Alfred Pippard]] and Sir [[Richard V. Southwell]]. He was awarded the PhD degree in 1945 with his thesis title \"Classical theories of gravity dam design in the light of modern analytical methods\".\n\n==Contributions to science==\nZienkiewicz was notable for having recognized the general potential for using the finite element method to resolve problems in areas outside the area of [[solid mechanics]]. The idea behind finite elements design is to develop tools based in [[computational mechanics]] schemes that can be useful to designers, not solely for research purposes. His books on the Finite Element Method were the first to present the subject and to this day remain the standard reference texts. He also founded the first journal dealing with computational mechanics in 1968 (''[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1097-0207 International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering]''), which is still the major journal for the field of Numerical Computations.<ref name=\"swansea1\"/>\n\n==International recognition==\nThe international range of Zienkiewicz' academic experiences has been geographically diverse. He became a lecturer at the Department of Engineering, [[University of Edinburgh]], UK (1949–1957) before becoming Professor of Structural and Civil Engineering at [[Northwestern University]], Illinois, USA (1957–1961). From 1961 to 1988 he was Head of the Department of Civil Engineering at [[Swansea University]]. He was latterly Professor Emeritus of this institution.

He is the brother of the theoretical physicist [[Aleksander Akhiezer]].\n\n==Biography==\nNaum Akhiezer was born in [[Cherykaw]] (now in [[Belarus]]). He studied in the Kiev Institute of Public Education (now [[Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv]]). In 1928, he defended his PhD thesis \"Aerodynamical Investigations\" under the supervision of [[Dmitry Grave]]. From 1928 to 1933, he worked at the [[Kiev University]] and at the [[National Aviation University|Kiev Aviation Institute]].\n\nIn 1933, Naum Akhiezer moved to [[Kharkiv]]. From 1933 to his death, except for the years of war and evacuation, he was a professor at [[Kharkov University]] and at other institutes in Kharkiv. From 1935 to 1940 and from 1947 to 1950 he was director of the Kharkov Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics. For many years he headed the [[Kharkov Mathematical Society]].\n\n==Work==\nAkhiezer obtained important results in [[approximation theory]] (in particular, on extremal problems, [[constructive function theory]], and the [[Moment problem|problem of moments]]), where he masterly applied the methods of the geometric theory of [[functions of a complex variable]] (especially, [[conformal mapping]]s and the theory of [[Riemann surface]]s) and of [[functional analysis]].<ref name=a100/><ref name=lyubich/> He found the fundamental connection between the inverse problem for important classes of differential and finite difference operators of the second order with a finite number of gaps in the spectrum, and the Jacobi inversion problem for [[Abelian integral]]s.<ref name=lyubich/> This connection led to explicit solutions of the inverse problem for the so-called ''finite-gap operators''.\n\n==Some publications==\n\n===Books in analysis===\n#{{Cite book |last=Ахиезер|first=Н.И. |title=Избранные труды по теории функций и математической физике (vol. 1&ndash;2)|trans-title=Selected works in function theory and mathematical physics|publisher=Acta |location=Kharkiv |year=2001 }}\n#{{cite book|last=Ахиезер|first=Н.И.|title=Лекции об интегральных преобразованиях|year=1984|publisher=Vishcha Shkola|location=Kharkov}} English translation: {{Cite book |first=N.

[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Fejer.html Biography]</ref> around 1900.\n\n==Biography==\nFejér studied mathematics and physics at the [[University of Budapest]] and at the [[University of Berlin]], where he was taught by [[Hermann Schwarz]]. <!---He occupied a chair in mathematics at the [[University of Peter Pazmany|University of Pázmány Péter]] (University of Budapest) from 1911 until his death. His research concentrated on [[harmonic analysis]] and, in particular, [[Fourier series]]. ---> In 1902 he earned his doctorate from University of Budapest (today [[Eötvös Loránd University]]). From 1902 to 1905 Fejér taught there and from 1905 until 1911 he taught at [[Franz Joseph University]] in [[Kolozsvár]] in [[Austria-Hungary]] (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in [[Romania]]). In 1911 Fejér was appointed to the chair of mathematics at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] and he held that post until his death. He was elected corresponding member (1908), member (1930) of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].\n\nDuring his period in the chair at Budapest Fejér led a highly successful Hungarian school of analysis. He was the thesis advisor of mathematicians such as [[John von Neumann]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[George Pólya]] and [[Pál Turán]].\n\nLipót Fejér is buried in [[Kerepesi Cemetery]] in Budapest.\n\nFejér's research concentrated on [[harmonic analysis]] and, in particular, [[Fourier series]].\n\nFejér collaborated to produce important papers, one with [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] on [[entire function]]s in 1907 and another major work with [[Frigyes Riesz]] in 1922 on [[conformal map]]pings (specifically, a short proof of the [[Riemann mapping theorem]]).\n\n== Pólya on Fejér ==\n{{Over-quotation|section|date=November 2008}}\n{{quote|If you could see him in his rather Bohemian attire (which was, I suspect, carefully chosen) you would find him very eccentric. Yet he would not appear so in his natural habitat, in a certain section of Budapest middle-class society, many members of which had the same manners, if not quite the same mannerisms, as Fejér — there he would appear about half eccentric.|[[George Pólya]]|George Pólya, \"Some mathematicians I have known\", ''[[American Mathematical Monthly|Amer. Math. Monthly]]'' 76 (1969), 746–753}}\n\nPólya writes the following about Fejér, telling us much about his personality:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pólya | first1 = G | year = 1961 | title = Leopold Fejér | url = | journal = J. London Math. Soc. | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 501–506 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nHe had artistic tastes. He deeply loved music and was a good pianist. He liked a well-turned phrase. 'As to earning a living', he said, 'a professor's salary is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition.' Once he was very angry with a colleague who happened to be a [[topology|topologist]], and explaining the case at length he wound up by declaring '... and what he is saying is a topological mapping of the truth'.\n<br /><br />\nHe had a quick eye for foibles and miseries; in seemingly dull situations he noticed points that were unexpectedly funny or unexpectedly pathetic. He carefully cultivated his talent of raconteur; when he told, with his characteristic gestures, of the little shortcomings of a certain great mathematician, he was irresistible. The hours spent in continental coffee houses with Fejér discussing mathematics and telling stories are a cherished recollection for many of us. Fejér presented his mathematical remarks with the same verve as his stories, and this may have helped him in winning the lasting interest of so many younger men in his problems.\n</blockquote>\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fejér.JPG|thumb|Lipót Fejér, (standing to the right) with Greek mathematician [[Constantin Carathéodory]] (1873-1950) (left) ]]\nIn the same article Pólya writes about Fejér's style of mathematics:\n\n<blockquote>\nFejér talked about a paper he was about to write up. 'When I write a paper,' he said, 'I have to rederive for myself the rules of differentiation and sometimes even the commutative law of multiplication.' These words stuck in my memory and years later I came to think that they expressed an essential aspect of Fejér's mathematical talent; his love for the intuitively clear detail.\n<br /><br />\nIt was not given to him to solve very difficult problems or to build vast conceptual structures. Yet he could perceive the significance, the beauty, and the promise of a rather concrete not too large problem, foresee the possibility of a solution and work at it with intensity. And, when he had found the solution, he kept on working at it with loving care, till each detail became fully transparent.\n<br /><br />\nIt is due to such care spent on the elaboration of the solution that Fejér's papers are very clearly written, and easy to read and most of his proofs appear very clear and simple. Yet only the very naive may think that it is easy to write a paper that is easy to read, or that it is a simple thing to point out a significant problem that is capable of a simple solution.\n</blockquote>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fejér kernel]]\n*[[Fejér's theorem]]\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Lipót Fejér}}\n* {{cite journal|author=Szegő, Gabor|authorlink=Gábor Szegő|title=Leopold Fejér: In memoriam, 1880-1959|journal=Bull.

      "text": "[[Image:Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev.jpg|200px|thumb|right|'''''Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev'''''.]]\n'''Yegor (Egor) Ivanovich Zolotarev''' ({{lang-ru|Его́р  Ива́нович Золотарёв}}) (March 31, 1847, [[Saint Petersburg]] – July 19, 1878, Saint Petersburg) was a [[Russia]]n [[mathematician]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\nYegor  was born  as a son of Agafya Izotovna Zolotareva and the merchant Ivan Vasilevich Zolotarev in Saint Petersburg, [[Imperial Russia]]. \nIn 1857 he began to study at the fifth St Petersburg [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], a school which centred on [[mathematics]] and [[natural science]]. He finished it with the silver medal in 1863. In the same year he was allowed to be an auditor at the physico-mathematical faculty of [[Saint Petersburg State University|St Petersburg university]].\n\nHe had not been able to become a student before 1864 because he was too young. Among his academic teachers were [[Osip Somov|Somov]], [[Pafnuty Chebyshev|Chebyshev]] and [[Korkin]], with whom he would have a tight scientific friendship.\nIn November 1867 he defended his [[Kandidat]] thesis ''“About the Integration of Gyroscope Equations”'', after 10 months there followed his thesis [[pro venia legendi]] ''About one question on Minima''. With this work he was given the right to teach as a private lecturer at St Petersburg university.\n\nHe first lectured on [[differential calculus]] to science students (until summer 1871), later [[integral calculus]] and analysis to beginners of mathematics. Except for a short pause he lectured on [[elliptic function]]s to students of higher semesters during his whole job as lecturer and professor.\n\nIn December 1869, Zolotarev defended his master's thesis ''“About the Solution of the Indefinite Equation of Third Degree x³ + Ay³ + A²z³ - 3Axyz = 1”''.\n\nHe took his first trip abroad in 1872 and visited [[Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg]]. In\nBerlin he attended [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]]' \"theory of analytic functions\", in Heidelberg Koenigsberger's.\n\nIn 1874, Zolotarev become a member of the university staff as a lecturer and in\nthe same year he defended his doctoral thesis ''“Theory of Complex Numbers with an Application to Integral Calculus”''. The problem Zolotarev solved there\nwas based on a problem Chebyshev had posed earlier, the representation of\nexpressions of the form\n:<math>\\int \\frac{x+A}{\\sqrt{x^4+ax^3+bx^2+cx+d}}\\, dx</math>\nby logarithms. This was a question Chebyshev had been interested in since the beginning of his research, but he was unable to solve it without the help of elliptic functions.\n\nStarting at the beginning of the winter semester 1876 Zolotarev was appointed extraordinary professor, and after the death of academician Somov he became his successor as an adjunct of the [[Russian Academy of Science|Academy of Sciences]].\n\nEgor Ivanovich Zolotarev's steep career ended abruptly with his early death. He was on his way to his [[dacha]] when he was run over by a train in the [[Tsarskoe Selo]] station. On July 19, 1878 he died from [[blood poisoning]].\n\nYegor Ivanovich is not to be confused with the probabilist Vladimir Mikhaelovich Zolotarev, Kolmogorov's disciple, who worked on [[stable distributions]] with well known results on their parametrization.<ref>http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=10480</ref><ref>Zolotarev, V.

In 1943, he joined the research department of the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] in England. Starting from 1949 he was lecturer in aeronautical engineering at the [[Imperial College London]] of the [[University of London]], where he assumed a chair in 1955.\n\nIn 1959, Argyris was appointed a professor at the Technical University of Stuttgart (today University of Stuttgart) and director of the Institute for Statics and Dynamics of Aerospace Structures. He created the Aeronautical and Astronautical Campus of the University of Stuttgart as focal point for applications of digital computers and electronics.\n\nArgyris was involved in and developed to a large extent the Finite Element Method along with [[Ray William Clough]] and [[Olgierd Zienkiewicz]] after an early mathematical pre-working of [[Richard Courant]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nArgyris was awarded the [[Royal Aeronautical Society]] Silver Medal in 1971.<ref>Medallist list published [http://www.aerosociety.com/Assets/Docs/Medals%20and%20Awards/HMA%20-%20List%20of%20RAeS%20Award%20Winners.pdf here].</ref>\n\nHe was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in March 1986.<ref name=\"frs\"/> His nomination reads: {{centred pull quote|Professor Argyris commenced his scientific career at Imperial College in 1949 and subsequently accepted in 1959 a joint appointment as Professor at Imperial College and Professor and Director of the Institute of Astronautical Structures at Stuttgart. Professor Argyris pioneered in the United Kingdom and Europe computer mechanics and established in the early 50's the matrix structural theory introducing the first finite elements concepts including effects of material and [[geometry|geometrical]] [[Nonlinear system|nonlinearities]].\nThis work initiated an explosive development of [[computational mechanics]] which is still an expanding area. In this field he continued without interruption as one of the leading figures and published a prodigious number of papers (over 300) ranging in applications from structural problems through [[fluid mechanics]], lubrication, [[celestial mechanics]]. The computer system ASKA developed under his direction was the model for many subsequent industrial developments. Professor Argyris has been honoured abroad by a great number of distinctions including the [[Theodore von Karman Medal]], Timoshenko Mecal [sic] (ASME), I. B.

He is best known by the general public for the book ''[[What is Mathematics?]]'', co-written with [[Herbert Robbins]].\n\n==Life and career==\n\nCourant was born in [[Lubliniec|Lublinitz]], in the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Silesia]]. His parents were Siegmund Courant and Martha Courant née Freund of [[Oels]]. [[Edith Stein]] was Richard's cousin on the paternal side. During his youth his parents moved often, including to [[Kłodzko|Glatz]], then to [[Wrocław|Breslau]] and in 1905 to [[Berlin]]. He stayed in Breslau and entered the [[University of Wrocław|university]] there, then continued his studies at the [[University of Zürich]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. He became [[David Hilbert]]'s assistant in Göttingen and obtained his doctorate there in 1910. He was obliged to serve in [[World War I]], but was wounded shortly after enlisting and therefore dismissed from the military. Courant left the [[University of Münster]] in 1921 to take over [[Erich Hecke]]{{'}}s position at the [[University of Göttingen]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Springer Science & Business Media| isbn = 978-3-642-22464-5| last = Bergmann| first = Birgit| title = Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture| date = 2012-10-22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7z8DTwXGO-oC&pg=PA82}}</ref> There he founded the Mathematical Institute, which he headed as director from 1928 until 1933.\n\nCourant left [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1933, earlier than many Jewish escapees. He did not lose his position due to being [[Jewish]], as his previous service as a front-line soldier exempted him; however, his public membership in the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|social-democratic left]] was reason enough (for the Nazis) for dismissal.<ref>{{cite journal|\n title=Edmund Landau's Göttingen: From the Life and Death of a Great Mathematical Center|\n first=Norbert|\n last=Schappacher|\n journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|\n year=1991|\n volume=13|\n issue=4|\n pages=12–18|\n url=http://www-irma.u-strasbg.fr/~schappa/NSch/Publications_files/1991b_Landau.pdf|\n doi=10.1007/bf03028334\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, after one year at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]], Courant accepted a professorship at [[New York University]] in New York City. There he founded an institute for graduate studies in [[applied mathematics]]. The [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] (as it was renamed in 1964) is now one of the most respected research centers in applied mathematics.{{See https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/applied-mathematics-rankings}}\n\nCourant and [[David Hilbert]] authored the influential [[textbook]] ''[[Methoden der mathematischen Physik]]'' which, with its revised editions, is still current and widely used since its publication in 1924. With [[Herbert Robbins]] he coauthored a popular overview of higher mathematics, intended for the general public, titled ''[[What is Mathematics?]]''. With [[Fritz John]] he also coauthored the two-volume work ''Introduction to Calculus and Analysis,'' first published in 1965.\n\nCourant's name is also attached to the [[finite element method]],<ref name=G.Pelosi>{{cite journal|title=The finite-element method, Part I: R.

Here is a quote from Courant on his mathematical perspective:\n\n{{quote|Empirical evidence can never establish mathematical existence--nor can the mathematician's demand for existence be dismissed by the physicist as useless rigor.
