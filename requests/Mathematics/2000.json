The definition used here comes from {{harv|Glauberman|1968|p=1104}}.\n\n'''1'''. Let '''''p''''' be an odd prime and '''''G''''' be a finite group with a nontrivial '''''p'''''-core <math>O_p(G)</math>.  Then '''''G''''' is '''''p'''''-stable if it satisfies the following condition:  Let '''''P''''' be an arbitrary '''''p'''''-subgroup of '''''G''''' such that <math>O_{p^\\prime}(G)</math> is a normal subgroup of '''''G'''''.  Suppose that <math>x\\in N_G(P)</math> and <math>\\bar x </math> is the coset of <math>C_G(P)</math> containing '''''x'''''. If <math>[P,x,x]=1</math>, then <math>\\overline{x}\\in O_n(N_G(P)/C_G(P))</math>.\n\nNow, define <math>\\mathcal{M}_p(G)</math> as the set of all '''''p'''''-subgroups of '''''G''''' maximal with respect to the property that <math>O_p(M)\\not= 1</math>.\n\n'''2'''. Let '''''G''''' be a finite group and '''''p''''' an odd prime.  Then '''''G''''' is called '''''p'''''-stable if every element of <math>\\mathcal{M}_p(G)</math> is '''''p'''''-stable by definition '''1'''.\n\n;Second definition.\n\nLet '''''p''''' be an odd prime and '''''H''''' a finite group.

The group of ''all'' permutations of a set ''M'' is the [[symmetric group]] of ''M'', often written as Sym(''M'').<ref>The notations '''S'''<sub>''M''</sub> and '''S'''<sup>''M''</sup> are also used.</ref> The term ''permutation group'' thus means a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group.

Group actions have applications in the study of [[Symmetry|symmetries]], [[combinatorics]] and many other branches of [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and chemistry.\n\n[[Image:Rubik's cube.svg|thumb|The popular puzzle [[Rubik's cube]] invented in 1974 by [[Ernő Rubik]] has been used as an illustration of permutation groups.  Each rotation of a layer of the cube results in a [[permutation]] of the surface colors and is a member of the group.  The permutation group of the cube is called the [[Rubik's cube group]].]]\n\n== Basic properties and terminology ==\n\nBeing a [[subgroup]] of a symmetric group, all that is necessary for a set of permutations to satisfy the [[group (mathematics)|group]] axioms and be a permutation group is that it contain the identity permutation, the inverse permutation of each permutation it contains, and be closed under [[function composition|composition]] of its permutations.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2006|loc=p. 148, Definition of subgroup}}</ref> A general property of finite groups implies that a finite nonempty subset of a symmetric group is again a group if and only if it is closed under the group operation.<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2006|loc=p. 149, Proposition 2.69}}</ref>\n\nThe '''degree''' of a group of permutations of a [[finite set]] is the [[cardinality|number of elements]] in the set. The '''order''' of a group (of any type) is the number of elements (cardinality) in the group. By [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]], the order of any finite permutation group of degree ''n'' must divide ''n''! (''n''-[[factorial]], the order of the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\n==Notation==\n{{main|Permutation#Definition and usage}}\nSince permutations are [[bijection]]s of a set, they can be represented by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]'s ''two-line notation''.<ref>{{citation|title=The Genesis of the Abstract Group Concept: A Contribution to the History of the Origin of Abstract Group Theory|first=Hans|last=Wussing|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2007|isbn=9780486458687|page=94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xp3JymnfAq4C&pg=PA94|quote=Cauchy used his permutation notation—in which the arrangements are written one below the other and both are enclosed in parentheses—for the first time in 1815.}}</ref> This notation lists each of the elements of ''M'' in the first row, and for each element, its image under the permutation below it in the second row. If <math>\\sigma</math> is a permutation of the set <math>M = \\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}</math> then,\n: <math> \\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\nx_1 & x_2 & x_3 & \\cdots & x_n \\\\\n\\sigma(x_1) &\\sigma(x_2) & \\sigma(x_3) & \\cdots& \\sigma(x_n)\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nFor instance, a particular permutation of the set {1,2,3,4,5} can be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix};</math>\nthis means that ''σ'' satisfies ''σ''(1)=2, ''σ''(2)=5, ''σ''(3)=4, ''σ''(4)=3, and ''σ''(5)=1. The elements of ''M'' need not appear in any special order in the first row. This permutation could also be written as:\n: <math>\\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nPermutations are also often written in [[cyclic notation]] (''cyclic form'')<ref>especially when the algebraic properties of the permutation are of interest.</ref> so that given the set ''M'' = {1,2,3,4}, a permutation ''g'' of ''M'' with ''g''(1) = 2, ''g''(2) = 4, ''g''(4) = 1 and ''g''(3) = 3 will be written as (1,2,4)(3), or more commonly, (1,2,4) since 3 is left unchanged; if the objects are denoted by single letters or digits, commas and spaces can also be dispensed with, and we have a notation such as (124). The permutation written above in 2-line notation would be written in cyclic notation as <math> \\sigma = (125)(34).</math>\n\n==Composition of permutations&ndash;the group product==\n{{main|Permutation#Permutations in group theory}}\nThe product of two permutations is defined as their [[function composition|composition]] as functions, so <math>\\sigma \\cdot \\pi</math> is the function that maps any element ''x'' of the set to <math>\\sigma (\\pi (x))</math>. Note that the rightmost permutation is applied to the argument first,<ref>\n{{cite book | last1=Biggs | first1=Norman L. | last2=White | first2=A.

Algorithms\n|volume=7\n|number=1\n|title=A compact representation of permutation groups\n|pages=60–78\n|year=1986\n |doi=10.1016/0196-6774(86)90038-6\n}}\n</ref>\nbut to that end permutations must be written to the ''right'' of their argument, often as a [[superscript]], so the permutation <math>\\sigma</math> acting on the element <math>x</math> results in the image <math>x ^{\\sigma}</math>. With this convention, the product is given by <math>x ^{\\sigma \\cdot \\pi} = (x ^{\\sigma})^{\\pi}</math>. However, this gives a ''different'' rule for multiplying permutations. This convention is commonly used in the permutation group literature, but this article uses the convention where the rightmost permutation is applied first.\n\nSince the composition of two bijections always gives another bijection, the product of two permutations is again a permutation. In two-line notation, the product of two permutations is obtained by rearranging the columns of the second (leftmost) permutation so that its first row is identical with the second row of the first (rightmost) permutation. The product can then be written as the first row of the first permutation over the second row of the modified second permutation. For example, given the permutations,\n:<math>P = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\\quad \\text{  and  } \\quad Q = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix},</math>\nthe product ''QP'' is:\n:<math>QP =\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\\\ 4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\2 & 4 & 1 & 3 & 5 \\end{pmatrix} =  \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\4 & 2 & 5 & 3 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe composition of permutations, when they are written in cyclic form, is obtained by juxtaposing the two permutations (with the second one written on the left) and then simplifying to a disjoint cycle form if desired. Thus, in cyclic notation the above product would be given by:\n:<math>Q \\cdot P = (1 5)(2 4) \\cdot (1 2 4 3) = (1 4 3 5).</math>\n\nSince [[function composition]] is [[associative]], so is the product operation on permutations: <math>(\\sigma \\cdot \\pi) \\cdot \\rho = \\sigma \\cdot(\\pi \\cdot \\rho)</math>. Therefore, products of two or more permutations are usually written without adding parentheses to express grouping; they are also usually written without a dot or other sign to indicate multiplication (the dots of the previous example were added for emphasis, so would simply be written as <math>\\sigma \\pi \\rho</math>).\n\n==Neutral element and inverses==\n\nThe identity permutation, which maps every element of the set to itself, is the neutral element for this product. In two-line notation, the identity is\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n \\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nIn cyclic notation, ''e'' = (1)(2)(3)...(''n'') which by convention is also denoted by just (1) or even ().<ref>{{harvnb|Rotman|2006|loc=p. 108}}</ref>\n\nSince [[bijections]] have [[Inverse function|inverses]], so do permutations, and the inverse ''σ''<sup>−1</sup> of ''σ'' is again a permutation. Explicitly, whenever ''σ''(''x'')=''y'' one also has ''σ''<sup>−1</sup>(''y'')=''x''. In two-line notation the inverse can be obtained by interchanging the two lines (and sorting the columns if one wishes the first line to be in a given order). For instance\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}^{-1}\n      =\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\\\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\end{pmatrix}\n      =\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 1 & 4 & 3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nTo obtain the inverse of a single cycle, we reverse the order of its elements. Thus,\n:<math> (1 2 5)^{-1} = (5 2 1) = (152).</math>\n\nTo obtain the inverse of a product of cycles, we first reverse the order of the cycles, and then we take the inverse of each as above. Thus,\n:<math> [(1 2 5)(3 4)]^{-1} = (34)^{-1}(125)^{-1} = (43)(521) = (34)(152).</math>\n\nHaving an associative product, an identity element, and inverses for all its elements, makes the set of all permutations of ''M'' into a [[group (mathematics)|group]], Sym(''M''); a permutation group.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nConsider the following set ''G''<sub>1</sub> of permutations of the set ''M'' = {1,2,3,4}:\n\n* ''e'' = (1)(2)(3)(4)= (1)\n**This is the identity, the trivial permutation which fixes each element.\n* ''a'' = (1 2)(3)(4) = (1 2)\n**This permutation interchanges 1 and 2, and fixes 3 and 4.\n* ''b'' = (1)(2)(3 4) = (3 4)\n**Like the previous one, but exchanging 3 and 4, and fixing the others.\n* ''ab'' = (1 2)(3 4)\n**This permutation, which is the composition of the previous two, exchanges simultaneously 1 with 2, and 3 with 4.\n\n''G''<sub>1</sub> forms a group, since ''aa'' = ''bb'' = ''e'', ''ba'' = ''ab'', and ''abab'' = ''e''. This permutation group is [[Isomorphic group|isomorphic]], as an abstract group, to the [[Klein group]] ''V''<sub>4</sub>.\n\nAs another example consider the [[Examples of groups#The symmetry group of a square - dihedral group of order 8|group of symmetries of a square]]. Let the vertices of a square be labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 (counterclockwise around the square starting with 1 in the top left corner). The symmetries are determined by the images of the vertices, that can, in turn, be described by permutations. The rotation by 90° (counterclockwise) about the center of the square is described by the permutation (1234). The 180° and 270° rotations are given by (13)(24) and (1432), respectively. The reflection about the horizontal line through the center is given by (12)(34) and the corresponding vertical line reflection is (14)(23). The reflection about the 1,3−diagonal line is (24) and reflection about the 2,4−diagonal is (13). The only remaining symmetry is the identity (1)(2)(3)(4). This permutation group is abstractly known as the [[dihedral group]] of order 8.\n\n==Group actions==\n{{main|Group action (mathematics)}} \nIn the above example of the symmetry group of a square, the permutations \"describe\" the movement of the vertices of the square induced by the group of symmetries. It is common to say that these group elements are \"acting\" on the set of vertices of the square. This idea can be made precise by formally defining a '''group action'''.<ref name=Dixon96>{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=p. 5}}</ref>\n\nLet ''G'' be a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] and ''M'' a nonempty [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. An '''action''' of ''G'' on ''M'' is a function ''f'': ''G'' × ''M'' → ''M'' such that\n* ''f''(1, ''x'') = ''x'', for all ''x'' in ''M'' (1 is the [[Identity element|identity]] (neutral) element of the group ''G''), and\n* ''f''(''g'', ''f''(''h'', ''x'')) = ''f''(''gh'', ''x''), for all ''g'',''h'' in ''G'' and all ''x'' in ''M''.\nThis last condition can also be expressed as saying that the action induces a group homomorphism from ''G'' into ''Sym''(''M'').<ref name=Dixon96 /> Any such homomorphism is called a ''(permutation) representation'' of ''G'' on ''M''.\n\nFor any permutation group, the action that sends (''g'', ''x'') → ''g''(''x'') is called the '''natural action''' of ''G'' on ''M''. This is the action that is assumed unless otherwise indicated.<ref name=Dixon96 /> In the example of the symmetry group of the square, the group's action on the set of vertices is the natural action. However, this group also induces an action on the set of four triangles in the square, which are: ''t''<sub>1</sub> = 234, ''t''<sub>2</sub> = 134, ''t''<sub>3</sub> = 124 and ''t''<sub>4</sub> = 123.

In particular, there is a  [[regular group action|regular action]] given by (left) multiplication in the group. That is, ''f''(''g'', ''x'') = ''gx'' for all ''g'' and ''x'' in ''G''. For each fixed ''g'', the function ''f''<sub>''g''</sub>(''x'') = ''gx'' is a bijection on ''G'' and therefore a permutation of the \"set\" ''G''. Each element of ''G'' can be thought of as a permutation in this way and so, ''G'' is isomorphic to a permutation group; this is the content of [[Cayley's theorem]].\n\nConsider the group ''G''<sub>1</sub> acting on the set {1,2,3,4} given above. Let the elements of this group be denoted by ''e'', ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' = ''ab'' = ''ba''. The action of ''G''<sub>1</sub> on itself described in Cayley's theorem gives the following permutation representation:\n:''f''<sub>''e''</sub> ↦ (''e'')(''a'')(''b'')(''c'')\n:''f''<sub>''a''</sub> ↦ (''ea'')(''bc'')\n:''f''<sub>''b''</sub> ↦ (''eb'')(''ac'')\n:''f''<sub>''c''</sub> ↦ (''ec'')(''ab'').\n\n== Permutation isomorphic groups ==\n\nIf ''G'' and ''H'' are two permutation groups on sets ''X'' and ''Y'' with actions ''f''<sub>1</sub> and ''f''<sub>2</sub> respectively, then we say that ''G'' and ''H'' are ''permutation isomorphic'' (''[[isomorphism|isomorphic]] as permutation groups'') if there exists a [[Bijection|bijective map]] {{nowrap|''λ'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} and a [[group isomorphism]] {{nowrap|''ψ'' : ''G'' → ''H''}} such that:<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=p. 17}}</ref>\n: ''λ''(''f''<sub>1</sub>(''g'', ''x'')) = ''f''<sub>2</sub>(''ψ''(''g''), ''λ''(''x'')) for all ''g'' in ''G'' and ''x'' in ''X''.\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''Y''}} this is equivalent to ''G'' and ''H'' being conjugate as subgroups of Sym(''X'').<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=p. 18}}</ref> The special case where {{nowrap|1=''G'' = ''H''}} and ''ψ'' is the [[identity map]] gives rise to the concept of ''equivalent actions'' of a group.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 228}}</ref>\n\nIn the example of the symmetries of a square given above, the natural action on the set {1,2,3,4} is equivalent to the action on the triangles. The bijection ''λ'' between the sets is given by {{nowrap|''i'' ↦ ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The natural action of group ''G''<sub>1</sub> above and its action on itself (via left multiplication) are not equivalent as the natural action has fixed points and the second action does not.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of group theory}}\n\nThe study of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] originally grew out of an understanding of permutation groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=p. 28}}</ref> [[Permutation]]s had themselves been intensively studied by [[Lagrange]] in 1770 in his work on the algebraic solutions of polynomial equations. This subject flourished and by the mid 19th century a well-developed theory of permutation groups existed, codified by [[Camille Jordan]] in his book ''Traité des Substitutions et des Équations Algébriques'' of 1870. Jordan's book was, in turn, based on the papers that were left by [[Évariste Galois]] in 1832.\n\nWhen [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] introduced the concept of an abstract group, it was not immediately clear whether or not this was a larger collection of objects than the known permutation groups (which had a definition different from the modern one). Cayley went on to prove that the two concepts were equivalent in Cayley's theorem.<ref>{{harvnb|Cameron|1994|loc=p. 226}}</ref>\n\nAnother classical text containing several chapters on permutation groups is [[William Burnside|Burnside]]'s ''Theory of Groups of Finite Order'' of 1911.<ref>{{citation|first=William|last=Burnside|title=Theory of Groups of Finite Order|year=1955|origyear=1911|edition=2nd|publisher=Dover}}</ref> The first half of the twentieth century was a fallow period in the study of group theory in general, but interest in permutation groups was revived in the 1950s by [[H.

      "text": "{{Short description|Automorphism group of the Klein quartic}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[projective special linear group]] '''PSL(2, 7)''', isomorphic to '''GL(3, 2)''', is a [[finite group|finite]] [[simple group]] that has important applications in [[algebra]], [[geometry]], and [[number theory]]. It is the [[automorphism group]] of the [[Klein quartic]] as well as the [[symmetry group]] of the [[Fano plane]]. With 168 elements, PSL(2, 7) is the smallest [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[simple group]] after the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>5</sub> with 60 elements, isomorphic to PSL(2, 5).\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe [[general linear group]] GL(2, 7) consists of all invertible 2×2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''F'''<sub>7</sub>, the [[finite field]] with 7 elements.  These have nonzero determinant.  The [[subgroup]] SL(2, 7) consists of all such matrices with unit [[determinant]]. Then PSL(2, 7) is defined to be the [[quotient group]]\n\n:SL(2, 7)/{I, −I}\n\nobtained by identifying I and −I, where ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]]. In this article, we let ''G'' denote any group isomorphic to PSL(2, 7).\n\n==Properties==\n\n''G'' = PSL(2, 7) has 168 elements. This can be seen by counting the possible columns; there are 7<sup>2</sup>−1 = 48 possibilities for the first column, then 7<sup>2</sup>−7 = 42 possibilities for the second column. We must divide by 7−1 = 6 to force the determinant equal to one, and then we must divide by 2 when we identify I and −I. The result is (48×42)/(6×2) = 168.\n\nIt is a general result that PSL(''n'', ''q'') is [[simple group|simple]] for ''n'', ''q'' ≥ 2 (''q'' being some power of a prime number), unless (''n'', ''q'') = (2, 2) or (2, 3). PSL(2, 2) is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>3</sub>, and PSL(2, 3) is isomorphic to [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>4</sub>. In fact, PSL(2, 7) is the second smallest [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] simple group, after the [[alternating group]] A<sub>5</sub> = PSL(2, 5) = PSL(2, 4).\n\nThe number of [[conjugacy class]]es and [[irreducible representation]]s is 6. The sizes of conjugacy classes are 1, 21, 42, 56, 24, 24. The dimensions of irreducible representations 1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8.\n\nCharacter table\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{r|cccccc}\n         & 1A_{1} & 2A_{21} & 4A_{42} &  3A_{56} & 7A_{24} & 7B_{24}  \\\\  \\hline\n\\chi_1  &   1  & 1  & 1 &  1 & 1  & 1  \\\\ \n\\chi_2  &   3  & -1 & 1 &  0 & \\sigma & \\bar \\sigma  \\\\ \n\\chi_3  &   3  & -1 & 1 &  0 & \\bar \\sigma  & \\sigma  \\\\ \n\\chi_4  &   6  & 2  & 0 &  0 & -1  & -1  \\\\ \n\\chi_5  &   7  & -1 &-1 &  1 & 0  & 0  \\\\ \n\\chi_6  &   8  & 0  & 0 & -1 & 1  & 1  \\\\ \n\\end{array},</math>\n\nwhere:\n\n:<math>\\sigma = \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{7}}{2}.</math>\n\nThe following table describes the conjugacy classes in terms of the order of an element in the class, the size of the class, the minimum polynomial of every representative in GL(3, 2), and the function notation for a representative in PSL(2, 7).

It is easy to describe the first two, they are cyclic, since [[Cyclic group#Properties|any group of prime order is cyclic]]. Any element of conjugacy class 3''A''<sub>56</sub> generates Sylow 3-subgroup. Any element from the conjugacy classes 7''A''<sub>24</sub>, 7''B''<sub>24</sub> generates the Sylow 7-subgroup. The Sylow 2-subgroup is a [[dihedral group of order 8]]. It can be described as [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] of any element from the conjugacy class 2''A''<sub>21</sub>. In the GL(3, 2) representation, a Sylow 2-subgroup consists of the upper triangular matrices.\n\nThis group and its Sylow 2-subgroup  provide a counter-example for various [[normal p-complement]] theorems for ''p'' = 2.\n\n==Actions on projective spaces==\n\n''G'' = PSL(2, 7) acts via [[Möbius transformation|linear fractional transformation]] on the [[projective line]] '''P'''<sup>1</sup>(7) over the field with 7 elements:\n\n<math>\\mbox{For  } \\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mbox{PSL}(2, 7) \\mbox{  and  } x \\in \\mathbb{P}^1\\!(7),\\ \\gamma \\cdot x = \\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}</math>\n\nEvery orientation-preserving automorphism of '''P'''<sup>1</sup>(7) arises in this way, and so ''G'' = PSL(2, 7) can be thought of geometrically as a group of symmetries of the projective line '''P'''<sup>1</sup>(7); the full group of possibly orientation-reversing projective linear automorphisms is instead the order 2 extension PGL(2, 7), and the group of [[collineation]]s of the projective line is the complete [[symmetric group]] of the points.\n\nHowever, PSL(2, 7) is also [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to PSL(3, 2) (= SL(3, 2) = GL(3, 2)), the special (general) linear group of 3×3 matrices over the field with 2 elements. In a similar fashion, ''G'' = PSL(3, 2) acts on the [[projective plane]] '''P'''<sup>2</sup>(2) over the field with 2 elements &mdash; also known as the [[Fano plane]]:\n\n:  For <math> \\gamma = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\\\ d & e & f \\\\ g & h & i \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mbox{PSL}(3, 2)\\ \\ </math> and <math>\\ \n \\ \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{P}^2\\!(2),\\ \\ \\gamma \\ \\cdot \\ \\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax+by+cz \\\\ dx+ey+fz \\\\ gx+hy+iz \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nAgain, every automorphism of '''P'''<sup>2</sup>(2) arises in this way, and so ''G'' = PSL(3, 2) can be thought of geometrically as the [[symmetry group]] of\nthis projective plane.  The [[Fano plane]] can be used to describe multiplication of [[octonions]], so ''G'' acts on the set of octonion multiplication tables.\n\n==Symmetries of the Klein quartic==\n{{further|Klein quartic}}\n[[File:Heptagonal tiling.svg|thumb|The [[Klein quartic]] can be realized as a quotient of the [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]].]]\n[[File:Order-7 triangular tiling.svg|thumb|Dually, the [[Klein quartic]] can be realized as a quotient of the [[order-7 triangular tiling]].]]\nThe [[Klein quartic]] is the projective variety over the [[complex number]]s '''C''' defined by the quartic polynomial\n\n:''x''<sup>3</sup>''y'' + ''y''<sup>3</sup>''z'' + ''z''<sup>3</sup>''x'' = 0.\n\nIt is a compact [[Riemann surface]] of genus g = 3, and is the only such surface for which the size of the conformal automorphism group attains the maximum of 84(''g''−1). This bound is due to the [[Hurwitz automorphisms theorem]], which holds for all ''g''>1. Such \"[[Hurwitz surface]]s\" are rare; the next genus for which any exist is ''g'' = 7, and the next after that is ''g'' = 14.\n\nAs with all [[Hurwitz surface]]s, the Klein quartic can be given a metric of [[constant negative curvature]] and then tiled with [[Regular polygon|regular]] (hyperbolic) [[heptagon]]s, as a quotient of the [[order-3 heptagonal tiling]], with the symmetries of the surface as a Riemannian surface or algebraic curve exactly the same as the symmetries of the tiling. For the Klein quartic this yields a tiling by 24 heptagons, and the order of ''G'' is thus related to the fact that 24 × 7 = 168. Dually, it can be tiled with 56 equilateral triangles, with 24 vertices, each of degree 7, as a quotient of the [[order-7 triangular tiling]]. \n \nKlein's quartic arises in many fields of mathematics, including representation theory, homology theory, octonion multiplication, [[Fermat's last theorem]], and [[Stark-Heegner theorem|Stark's theorem]] on imaginary quadratic number fields of class number 1.\n\n==Mathieu group==\nPSL(2, 7) is a maximal subgroup of the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>21</sub>; the groups M<sub>21</sub> and  M<sub>24</sub> can be constructed as extensions of PSL(2, 7). These extensions can be interpreted in terms of the tiling of the Klein quartic, but are not realized by geometric symmetries of the tiling.<ref name=\"richter\">{{Harv|Richter}}</ref>\n\n==Permutation actions==\nThe group PSL(2, 7) acts on various finite sets:\n* In its original interpretation as PSL(2, 7), orientation-preserving linear automorphisms of the projective line P<sup>1</sup>('''F'''<sub>7</sub>), it acts transitively on the 8 points with a stabilizer of order 21 fixing a given point. It also acts 2-transitively with stabilizer of order 3 on each pair of points; and it has two orbits on triples of points, with trivial stabilizer on each triple. (The larger group PGL(2,7) acts sharply 3-transitively.)\n* Interpreted as PGL(3,2), linear automorphisms of the Fano plane P<sup>2</sup>('''F'''<sub>2</sub>), it acts 2-transitively on the 7 points, with stabilizer of order 24 fixing each point, and stabilizer of order 4 fixing each pair of points.\n* Interpreted as automorphisms of a tiling of the Klein quartic, it acts transitively on the 24 vertices (or dually, 24 heptagons), with stabilizer of order 7 (corresponding to a rotation about the vertex/heptagon).\n* Interpreted as a subgroup of the Mathieu group M<sub>21</sub>, the subgroup acts non-transitively on 21 points.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{citation | ref = {{harvid|Richter}} | first = David A. | last = Richter | url = http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/mathieu.htm | title = How to Make the Mathieu Group M<sub>24</sub> | accessdate = 2010-04-15 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | last1=Brown | first1=Ezra | last2=Loehr | first2=Nicholas | title=Why is PSL (2,7)≅ GL (3,2)? | zbl=1229.20046 | journal=Am.

      "text": "[[File:Cayley graph of quasidihedral group of order 16.svg|thumb|A [[Cayley graph]] of the quasidihedral group of order 16]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''quasi-dihedral groups''', also called  '''semi-dihedral groups''', are certain non-abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of order a power of 2.  For every positive integer n greater than or equal to 4, there are exactly four isomorphism classes of nonabelian groups of order 2<sup>n</sup> which have a cyclic subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2.  Two are well known, the [[generalized quaternion group]] and the [[dihedral group]]. One of the remaining two groups is often considered particularly important, since it is an example of a 2-group of [[maximal class|maximal nilpotency class]].  In [[Bertram Huppert]]'s text ''Endliche Gruppen'', this group is called a Quasidiedergruppe.  In [[Daniel Gorenstein]]'s text, ''Finite Groups'', this group is called the semidihedral group. Dummit and Foote refer to it as the quasidihedral group; we adopt that name in this article. All give the same presentation for this group:\n\n:<math>\\langle r,s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}-1}\\rangle\\,\\!</math>.\n\nThe other non-abelian 2-group with cyclic subgroup of index 2 is not given a special name in either text, but referred to as just G or M{{sub|m}}(2). When this group has order 16, Dummit and Foote refer to this group as the modular group of order 16, as its [[Iwasawa group|lattice of subgroups is modular]], so in this article this group will be called the modular maximal-cyclic group. Its presentation is:\n\n:<math>\\langle r,s \\mid r^{2^{n-1}} = s^2 = 1, srs = r^{2^{n-2}+1}\\rangle\\,\\!</math>.\n\nBoth these two groups and the dihedral group are [[semidirect product]]s of a cyclic group <''r''> of order 2<sup>n−1</sup> with a cyclic group <''s''> of order 2.  Such a non-abelian semi-direct product is uniquely determined by an element of order 2 in the group of units of the ring <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2^{n-1}\\mathbb{Z}</math> and there are precisely three such elements, <math>2^{n-1}-1</math>, <math>2^{n-2}-1</math>, and <math>2^{n-2}+1</math>, corresponding to the dihedral group, the quasidihedral, and the modular maximal-cyclic group.\n\nThe generalized quaternion group, the dihedral group, and the quasidihedral group of order 2<sup>''n''</sup> all have nilpotency class ''n'' − 1, and are the only isomorphism classes of groups of order 2<sup>''n''</sup> with nilpotency class ''n'' − 1.  The groups of order ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> and nilpotency class ''n'' − 1 were the beginning of the classification of all [[p-group]]s via [[p-group#Classification|coclass]].  The modular maximal-cyclic group of order 2<sup>n</sup> always has nilpotency class 2.  This makes the modular maximal-cyclic group less interesting, since most groups of order ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> for large ''n'' have nilpotency class 2 and have proven difficult to understand directly. <!-- I need to go get a copy of this folklore statement. the result should be in {{MR|113948}} or {{MR|169921}} -->\n\nThe generalized quaternion, the dihedral, and the quasidihedral group are the only 2-groups whose [[derived subgroup]] has index 4.

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''quasithin group''' is a [[finite simple group]] that resembles a [[group of Lie type]] of rank at most 2 over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic 2]]. More precisely it is a finite simple group of [[characteristic 2 type]] and width 2. Here characteristic 2 type means that its [[centralizer]]s of [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s resemble those of [[groups of Lie type]] over fields of characteristic 2, and the width is roughly the maximal rank of an abelian group of odd order normalizing a non-trivial 2-subgroup of ''G''. When ''G'' is a group of Lie type of characteristic 2 type, the width is usually the rank (the dimension of a [[maximal torus]] of the algebraic group).\n\n== Classification ==\nThe classification of quasithin groups is a crucial part of the [[classification of finite simple groups]].

The study of these groups was started by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Donald Higman|last=Higman|year1=1964|year2=1971}}. Several of the [[sporadic simple group]]s were discovered as rank 3 permutation groups.\n\n==Classification==\nThe primitive rank 3 permutation groups are all in one of the following classes:\n\n*{{harvtxt|Cameron|1981}} classified the ones such that <math>T\\times T\\le G\\le T_0 \\operatorname{wr} Z/2Z</math> where the [[Socle (mathematics)|socle]] ''T'' of ''T''<sub>0</sub> is simple, and ''T''<sub>0</sub> is a 2-transitive group of degree {{radic|''n''}}.\n*{{harvtxt|Liebeck|1987}} classified the ones with a regular elementary abelian normal subgroup\n*{{harvtxt|Bannai|1971–72}} classified the ones whose socle is a simple alternating group\n*{{harvtxt|Kantor|Liebler|1982}} classified the ones whose socle is a simple classical group\n*{{harvtxt|Liebeck|Saxl|1986}} classified the ones whose socle is a simple exceptional or sporadic group.\n\n==Examples==\nIf ''G'' is any 4-transitive group acting on a set ''S'', then its action on pairs of elements of ''S'' is a rank 3 permutation group.<ref>The three orbits are: the fixed pair itself; those pairs having one element in common with the fixed pair; and those pairs having no element in common with the fixed pair.</ref> In particular most of the alternating groups, symmetric groups, and [[Mathieu group]]s have 4-transitive actions, and so can be made into rank 3 permutation groups.\n\nThe projective general linear group acting on lines in a projective space of dimension at least 3 is a rank-3 permutation group.\n\nSeveral [[3-transposition group]]s are rank-3 permutation groups (in the action on transpositions).\n\nIt is common for the point-stabilizer of a rank-3 permutation group acting on one of the orbits to be a rank-3 permutation group. This gives several \"chains\" of rank-3 permutation groups, such as the [[Suzuki chain]] and the chain ending with the [[Fischer groups]].\n\nSome unusual rank-3 permutation groups (many from {{harv|Liebeck|Saxl|1986}}) are listed below.\n\nFor each row in the table below, in the grid in the column marked \"size\", the number to the left of the equal sign is the degree of the permutation group for the permutation group mentioned in the row. In the grid, the sum to the right of the equal sign shows the lengths of the three orbits of the stabilizer of a point of the permutation group. For example, the expression 15 = 1+6+8 in the first row of the table under the heading means that the permutation group for the first row has degree 15, and the lengths of three orbits of the strabilizer of a point of the permutation group are 1, 6 and 8 respectively.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''Ree group''' is a [[group of Lie type]] over a [[finite field]] constructed by {{harvs|txt|last=Ree|year1=1960|year2=1961|authorlink=Rimhak Ree}} from an exceptional [[automorphism]] of a [[Dynkin diagram]] that reverses the direction of the multiple bonds, generalizing the [[Suzuki groups]] found by Suzuki using a different method. They were the last of the infinite families of [[finite simple group]]s to be discovered.\n\nUnlike the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg group]]s, the Ree groups are not given by the points of a connected [[reductive algebraic group]] defined over a finite field; in other words, there is no \"Ree algebraic group\" related to the Ree groups in the same way that (say) unitary groups are related to Steinberg groups. However, there are some exotic [[pseudo-reductive algebraic group]]s over non-perfect fields whose construction is related to the construction of Ree groups, as they use the same exotic automorphisms of Dynkin diagrams that change root lengths.\n\n{{harvtxt|Tits|1960}} defined  Ree groups over infinite fields of characteristics 2 and 3. {{harvtxt|Tits|1989}} and {{harvtxt|Hée|1990}} introduced Ree groups of infinite-dimensional [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s.\n\n==Construction==\n\nIf {{mvar|X}} is a Dynkin diagram, Chevalley constructed split algebraic groups corresponding to {{mvar|X}}, in particular giving groups {{math|''X''(''F'')}} with values in a field {{mvar|F}}. These groups have the following automorphisms:\n*Any endomorphism {{mvar|σ}} of the field {{mvar|F}} induces an endomorphism {{mvar|α<sub>σ</sub>}} of the group {{math|''X''(''F'')}}\n*Any automorphism {{mvar|π}} of the Dynkin diagram induces an automorphism {{mvar|α<sub>π</sub>}} of the group {{math|''X''(''F'')}}.\n\nThe Steinberg and Chevalley groups can be constructed as fixed points of an endomorphism of ''X''(''F'') for {{mvar|F}} the algebraic closure of a field. For the Chevalley groups, the automorphism is the Frobenius endomorphism of {{mvar|F}}, while for the Steinberg groups the automorphism is the Frobenius endomorphism times an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram.\n\nOver fields of characteristic 2 the groups {{math|B<sub>2</sub>(''F'')}} and {{math|F<sub>4</sub>(''F'')}} and over fields of characteristic 3 the groups {{math|G<sub>2</sub>(''F'')}} have an endomorphism whose square is the endomorphism {{mvar|α<sub>φ</sub>}} associated to the Frobenius endomorphism {{mvar|φ}} of the field {{mvar|F}}. Roughly speaking, this endomorphism {{mvar|α<sub>π</sub>}} comes from the order 2 automorphism of the Dynkin diagram where one ignores the lengths of the roots.\n\nSuppose that the field {{mvar|F}} has an endomorphism {{mvar|σ}} whose square is the Frobenius endomorphism: {{math|''σ''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''φ''}}. Then the Ree group is defined to be the group of elements {{mvar|g}} of {{math|''X''(''F'')}} such that {{math|''α<sub>π</sub>''(''g'') {{=}} ''α<sub>σ</sub>''(''g'')}}. If the field {{mvar|F}} is perfect then {{mvar|α<sub>π</sub>}} and {{mvar|α<sub>φ</sub>}} are automorphisms, and the Ree group is the group of fixed points of the involution {{mvar|α<sub>φ</sub>/α<sub>π</sub>}} of {{math|''X''(''F'')}}.\n\nIn the case when {{mvar|F}} is a finite field of order {{mvar|p<sup>k</sup>}} (with ''p'' = 2 or 3) there is an endomorphism with square the Frobenius exactly when ''k'' = 2''n'' + 1 is odd, in which case it is unique. So this gives the finite Ree groups as subgroups of B<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>), F<sub>4</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>), and G<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>) fixed by an involution.\n\n==Chevalley groups, Steinberg group, and Ree groups==\n\nThe relation between Chevalley groups, Steinberg group, and Ree groups is roughly as follows. Given a Dynkin diagram ''X'', Chevalley constructed a group scheme over the integers {{math|'''Z'''}} whose values over finite fields are the Chevalley groups. In general one can take the fixed points of an endomorphism {{mvar|α}} of {{math|''X''({{overline|''F''}})}} where {{math|{{overline|''F''}}}} is the algebraic closure of a finite field, such that some power of {{mvar|α}} is some power of the Frobenius endomorphism φ. The three cases are as follows:\n*For Chevalley groups, {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''φ<sup>n</sup>''}} for some positive integer ''n''. In this case the group of fixed points is also the group of points of ''X'' defined over a finite field. \n*For Steinberg groups, {{math|''α<sup>m</sup>'' {{=}} ''φ<sup>n</sup>''}} for some positive integers ''m'', ''n'' with ''m'' dividing ''n'' and ''m'' > 1. In this case the group of fixed points is also the group of points of a twisted (quasisplit) form of ''X'' defined over a finite field. \n*For Ree groups, {{math|''α<sup>m</sup>'' {{=}} ''φ<sup>n</sup>''}} for some positive integers ''m'', ''n'' with ''m'' not dividing ''n''. In practice ''m''=2 and ''n'' is odd. Ree groups are not given as the points of some connected algebraic group with values in a field. they are the fixed points of an order ''m''=2 automorphism of a group defined over a field of order {{mvar|p<sup>n</sup>}} with ''n'' odd, and there is no corresponding field of order ''p''<sup>''n''/2</sup> (although some authors like to pretend there is in their notation for the groups).\n\n==Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>B<sub>2</sub>==\n\n{{main|Suzuki groups}}\n\nThe Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>B<sub>2</sub> were first found by {{harvtxt|Suzuki|1960}} using a different method, and are usually called [[Suzuki groups]]. Ree noticed that they could be constructed from the groups of type B<sub>2</sub> using a variation of the construction of {{harvtxt|Steinberg|1959}}. Ree realized that a similar construction could be applied to the Dynkin diagrams F<sub>4</sub> and G<sub>2</sub>, leading to two new families of finite simple groups.\n\n==Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>==\n\nThe Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>) were introduced by {{harvtxt|Ree|1960}}, who showed that they are all simple except for the first one <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3), which is isomorphic to the automorphism group of {{math|SL<sub>2</sub>(8)}}. {{harvtxt|Wilson|2010}} gave a simplified construction of the Ree groups, as the automorphisms of a 7-dimensional vector space over the field with 3<sup>2''n''+1</sup> elements preserving a bilinear form, a trilinear form, and a bilinear product.\n\nThe Ree group has order {{math|''q''<sup>3</sup>(''q''<sup>3</sup> + 1)(''q'' − 1)}} where ''q'' = 3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>\n\nThe Schur multiplier is trivial for ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1 and for <sup>2</sup>''G''<sub>2</sub>(3)′.\n\nThe outer automorphism group is cyclic of order&nbsp;2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nThe Ree group is also occasionally denoted by Ree(''q''), R(''q''), or E<sub>2</sub><sup>*</sup>(''q'')\n\nThe Ree group <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(''q'') has a [[doubly transitive permutation representation]] on {{math|''q''<sup>3</sup> + 1}} points, and more precisely acts as automorphisms of an S(2, ''q''+1, ''q''<sup>3</sup>+1) [[Steiner system]]. It also acts on a 7-dimensional vector space over the field with ''q'' elements as it is a subgroup of G<sub>2</sub>(''q'').\n\nThe 2-sylow subgroups of the Ree groups are elementary abelian of order 8. [[Walter's theorem]] shows that the only other non-abelian finite simple groups with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups are the projective special linear groups in dimension 2 and the [[Janko group J1]]. These groups also played a role in the discovery of the first modern sporadic group. They have involution centralizers of the form {{math|'''Z'''/2'''Z''' × PSL<sub>2</sub>(''q'')}}, and by investigating groups with an involution centralizer of the similar form {{math|'''Z'''/2'''Z''' × PSL<sub>2</sub>(5)}} Janko found the sporadic group&nbsp;[[Janko group|''J''<sub>1</sub>]]. {{harvtxt|Kleidman|1988}} determined their maximal subgroups.\n\nThe Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub> are exceptionally hard to characterize. {{harvs|txt|last=Thompson|year1=1967|year2=1972|year3=1977}} studied this problem, and was able to show that the structure of such a group is determined by a certain automorphism {{mvar|σ}} of a finite field of characteristic 3, and that if the square of this automorphism is the Frobenius automorphism then the group is the Ree group. He also gave some complicated conditions satisfied by the automorphism {{mvar|σ}}. Finally {{harvs|txt|last=Bombieri|year=1980}} used [[elimination theory]] to show  that Thompson's conditions implied that {{math|''σ''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 3}} in all but 178 small cases, that were eliminated using a computer by [[Andrew Odlyzko|Odlyzko]] and Hunt. Bombieri found out about this problem after reading an article about the classification by {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1979}}, who suggested that someone from outside group theory might be able to help solving it. {{harvtxt|Enguehard|1986}} gave a unified account of the solution of this problem by  Thompson and Bombieri.\n\n==Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>==\n\nThe Ree groups of type <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>) were introduced by {{harvtxt|Ree|1961}}. They are simple except for the first one <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2), which {{harvtxt|Tits|1964}} showed has a simple subgroup of index 2, now known as the [[Tits group]]. {{harvtxt|Wilson|2010b}} gave a simplified construction of the Ree groups as the symmetries of a 26-dimensional space over the field of order 2<sup>2''n''+1</sup> preserving a quadratic form, a cubic form, and a partial multiplication.\n\nThe Ree group <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>) has order\n''q''<sup>12</sup>\n(''q''<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)\n(''q''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)\n(''q''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)\n(''q''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1)\nwhere\n''q'' = 2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>.\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] is trivial.\nThe [[outer automorphism group]] is cyclic of order&nbsp;2''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nThese Ree groups have the unusual property that the [[Coxeter group]] of their [[BN pair]] is not crystallographic: it is the dihedral group of order 16. {{harvtxt|Tits|1983}} showed that all [[Moufang octagon]]s come from Ree groups of type {{math|<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[List of finite simple groups]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Roger W. | author1-link=Roger Carter (mathematician) | title=Simple groups of Lie type | origyear=1972 | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=978-0-471-50683-6 | mr=0407163 | year=1989}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Bombieri | first1=Enrico | author1-link=Enrico Bombieri | others=appendices by Andrew Odlyzko and D.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[abstract algebra|algebra]] known as [[representation theory]], the '''representation ring''' (or '''Green ring''' after [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]]) of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] formed from all the (isomorphism classes of the) finite-dimensional linear [[group representation|representations]] of the group.  For a given group, the ring will depend on the base field of the representations.  The case of complex coefficients is the most developed, but the case of [[algebraically closed field]]s of [[characteristic of a ring|characteristic]] ''p'' where the [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow ''p''-subgroups]] are [[cyclic group|cyclic]] is also theoretically approachable.\n\n==Formal definition==\nGiven a group ''G'' and a field ''F'', the elements of its '''representation ring''' ''R''<sub>''F''</sub>(''G'') are the formal differences of isomorphism classes of finite dimensional linear ''F''-representations of ''G''.  For the ring structure, addition is given by the direct sum of representations, and multiplication by their [[tensor product of representations|tensor product]] over ''F''.  When ''F'' is omitted from the notation, as in ''R''(''G''), then ''F'' is implicitly taken to be the field of complex numbers.\n\nSuccinctly, the representation ring of ''G'' is the [[Grothendieck ring]] of the category of finite-dimensional representations of ''G''.\n\n==Examples==\n*For the complex representations of the [[cyclic group]] of order ''n'', the representation ring ''R''<sub>'''''C'''''</sub>(''C''<sub>''n''</sub>) is isomorphic to  '''Z'''[''X'']/(''X''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1), where ''X'' corresponds to the complex representation sending a generator of the group to a primitive ''n''th root of unity.\n*More generally, the complex representation ring of a finite [[abelian group]] may be identified with the [[group ring]] of the [[character group]].\n*For the rational representations of the cyclic group of order 3, the representation ring ''R''<sub>'''''Q'''''</sub>(C<sub>3</sub>) is isomorphic to '''''Z'''''[''X'']/(''X''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''X''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2), where ''X'' corresponds to the irreducible rational representation of dimension 2.\n*For the modular representations of the cyclic group of order 3 over a field ''F'' of characteristic 3,  the representation ring ''R''<sub>''F''</sub>(''C''<sub>3</sub>) is isomorphic to '''''Z'''''[''X'',''Y'']/(''X''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''Y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, ''XY''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2''Y'',''Y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3''Y'').\n*The continuous representation ring ''R''(S<sup>1</sup>) for the circle group is isomorphic to '''''Z'''''[''X'', ''X''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup>].   The ring of real representations is the subring of ''R''(''G'') of elements fixed by the involution on ''R''(''G'') given by ''X'' &rarr; ''X''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup>.\n*The ring ''R''<sub>'''''C'''''</sub>(''S''<sub>3</sub>) for the [[symmetric group]] on three points is isomorphic to '''Z'''[''X'',''Y'']/(''XY''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''Y'',''X''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,''Y''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''X''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''Y''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1), where ''X'' is the 1-dimensional alternating representation and ''Y'' the 2-dimensional irreducible representation of ''S''<sub>3</sub>.\n\n==Characters==\nAny representation defines a [[Character theory|character]] χ:''G'' → '''C'''. Such a function is constant on conjugacy classes of ''G'', a so-called [[class function]]; denote the ring of class functions by ''C''(''G''). If ''G'' is finite, the homomorphism ''R''(''G'') → ''C''(''G'') is injective, so that ''R''(''G'') can be identified with a subring of ''C''(''G'').  For fields ''F'' whose characteristic divides the order of the group ''G'', the homomorphism from ''R''<sub>''F''</sub>(''G'') → ''C''(''G'') defined by [[modular representation theory|Brauer characters]] is no longer injective.\n\nFor a compact connected group ''R''(''G'') is isomorphic to the subring of ''R''(''T'') (where ''T'' is a maximal torus) consisting of those class functions that are invariant under the action of the Weyl group (Atiyah and Hirzebruch, 1961). For the general compact Lie group, see Segal (1968).\n\n==λ-ring and Adams operations==\nGiven a representation of ''G'' and a natural number ''n'', we can form the ''n''-th [[exterior power]] of the representation, which is again a representation of ''G''. This induces an operation λ<sup>''n''</sup> : ''R''(''G'') &rarr; ''R''(''G''). With these operations, ''R''(''G'') becomes a [[λ-ring]].\n\nThe ''[[Adams operations]]'' on the representation ring ''R''(''G'') are maps Ψ<sup>''k''</sup> characterised by their effect on characters χ:\n:<math>\\Psi^k \\chi (g) = \\chi(g^k) \\ . </math>\n\nThe operations Ψ<sup>''k''</sup> are ring homomorphisms of ''R''(''G'') to itself, and on representations ρ of dimension ''d''\n\n:<math>\\Psi^k (\\rho) = N_k(\\Lambda^1\\rho,\\Lambda^2\\rho,\\ldots,\\Lambda^d\\rho) \\ </math>\n\nwhere the Λ<sup>''i''</sup>ρ are the [[exterior power]]s of ρ and ''N''<sub>''k''</sub> is the ''k''-th power sum expressed as a function of the ''d'' elementary symmetric functions of ''d'' variables.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation |authorlink1=Michael Atiyah | last1=Atiyah |first1= Michael F. |last2=Hirzebruch| first2=Friedrich | title=Vector bundles and homogeneous spaces |year=1961|journal= Proc.

Indeed with the solved position as a starting point, there is a [[Bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] between each of the legal positions of the Rubik's Cube and the elements of <math>G</math>.<ref name=\"advgroup\">{{cite book|title=Adventures in group theory: Rubik's Cube, Merlin's machine, and Other Mathematical Toys|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-8018-6947-1|author=Joyner, David}}</ref><ref name=\"geometer\">{{cite web|url=http://geometer.org/rubik/group.pdf|title=Group Theory via Rubik’s Cube|year=2006|author=Davis, Tom}}</ref> The group [[Binary operation|operation]] <math>\\cdot</math> is the [[Function composition|composition]] of cube moves, corresponding to the result of performing one cube move after another.   \n\nThe Rubik's Cube group is constructed by labeling each of the 48 non-center facets with the integers 1 to 48. Each configuration of the cube can be represented as a [[permutation]] of the labels 1 to 48, depending on the position of each facet. Using this representation, the solved cube is the identity permutation which leaves the cube unchanged, while the twelve cube moves that rotate a layer of the cube 90 degrees are represented by their respective permutations. The Rubik's Cube group is the [[subgroup]] of the [[symmetric group]] <math>S_{48}</math> [[group generator|generated]] by the six permutations corresponding to the six clockwise cube moves. With this construction, any configuration of the cube reachable through a sequence of cube moves is within the group. Its operation <math>\\cdot</math> refers to the [[function composition|composition]] of two permutations; within the cube, this refers to combining two sequences of cube moves together, doing one after the other.

The orientation of the six centre facets is fixed.\n\nWe can identify each of the six face rotations as elements in the [[symmetric group]] on the set of non-center facets.  More concretely, we can label the non-center facets by the numbers 1 through 48, and then identify the six face rotations as elements of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>48</sub> according to how each move permutes the various facets.  The Rubik's Cube group, ''G'', is then defined to be the [[subgroup]] of ''S''<sub>48</sub> [[group generator|generated]] by the 6 face rotations, <math>\n\\{F,B,U,D,L,R\\}</math>.\n\nThe [[cardinality]] of ''G'' is given by \n:<math>|G| = 43{,}252{,}003{,}274{,}489{,}856{,}000\\,\\! = 12! 2^{10} 8! 3^7 = 2^{27} 3^{14} 5^3 7^2 11</math>.<ref name=\"GAP\">{{cite web|last=Schönert|first=Martin| url=http://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html|title=Analyzing Rubik's Cube with GAP}}</ref><ref>Tom Davis, \"Rubik's Cube.

For example, one such element of order 1260 is \n:<math>(RU^2D^{-1}BD^{-1})</math>.<ref name=\"advgroup\"/>\n\n''G'' is [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]] since, for example, <math>FR</math> is not the same as <math>RF</math>.  That is, not all cube moves [[Commutativity|commute]] with each other.<ref name=\"geometer\" />\n\n===Subgroups===\nWe consider two subgroups of ''G'': First the subgroup ''C''<sub>''o''</sub> of ''cube orientations'', the moves that leave the position of every block fixed, but can change the orientations of blocks. This group is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''G''. It can be represented as the normal closure of some moves that flip a few edges or twist a few corners. For example, it is the [[Conjugate closure|normal closure]] of the following two moves:\n\n:<math>B R^\\prime D^2 R B^\\prime U^2 B R^\\prime D^2 R B^\\prime U^2,\\,\\!</math> (twist two corners)\n:<math>R U D B^2 U^2 B^\\prime U B U B^2 D^\\prime R^\\prime U^\\prime,\\,\\!</math> (flip two edges).\n\nSecond, we take the subgroup <math>C_P</math> of ''cube permutations'', the moves which can change the positions of the blocks, but leave the orientation fixed. For this subgroup there are several choices, depending on the precise way you define orientation.{{refn|group=note|One way of defining orientation is as follows, adapted from pages 314–315 of ''[[Metamagical Themas]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]]. Define two notions: the ''chief color of a block'' and the ''chief facet of a position'', where a position means the location of a block. The ''chief facet of a position'' will be the one on the front or back face of the cube, if that position has such a facet; otherwise it will be the one on the left or right face. There are nine chief facets on F, nine on B, two on L, and two on R. The ''chief color of a block'' is defined as the color that should be on the block's chief facet when the block \"comes home\" to its proper position in a solved cube. A cube move <math>X</math> preserves orientation if, when <math>X</math> has been applied to a solved cube, the chief color of every block is on the chief facet of its position.}} One choice is the following group, given by generators (the last generator is a 3 cycle on the edges):\n\n:<math>C_p = [U^2, D^2, F, B, L^2, R^2, R^2 U^\\prime F B^\\prime R^2 F^\\prime B U^\\prime R^2].\\,\\!</math>\n\nSince ''C''<sub>''o''</sub> is a normal subgroup and the intersection of ''C''<sub>''o''</sub> and ''C''<sub>''p''</sub> is the identity and their product is the whole cube group, it follows that the cube group ''G'' is the [[semi-direct product]] of these two groups. That is\n\n:<math> G = C_o \\rtimes C_p. \\, </math>\n\nNext we can take a closer look at these two groups. The structure of ''C''<sub>''o''</sub> is\n\n:<math>\\mathbb Z_3^7 \\times \\mathbb Z_2^{11},\\ </math>\n\nsince the group of rotations of each corner (resp. edge) cube is <math>\\mathbb Z_3</math> (resp. <math>\\mathbb Z_2</math>), and in each case all but one may be rotated freely, but these rotations determine the orientation of the last one. Noticing that there are 8 corners and 12 edges, and that all the rotation groups are abelian, gives the above structure.\n\nCube permutations, ''C<sub>p</sub>'', is a little more complicated. It has the following two disjoint normal subgroups: the group of even permutations on the corners ''A''<sub>8</sub> and the group of even permutations on the edges ''A''<sub>12</sub>. Complementary to these two subgroups is a permutation that swaps two corners and swaps two edges. It turns out that these generate all possible permutations, which means\n\n:<math>C_p = (A_8 \\times A_{12})\\, \\rtimes \\mathbb Z_2.</math>\n\nPutting all the pieces together we get that the cube group is isomorphic to\n\n:<math>(\\mathbb Z_3^7 \\times \\mathbb Z_2^{11}) \\rtimes \\,((A_8 \\times A_{12}) \\rtimes \\mathbb Z_2).</math>\n\nThis group can also be described as the [[subdirect product]] \n:<math>[(\\mathbb Z_3^7 \\rtimes \\mathrm S_8) \\times (\\mathbb Z_2^{11} \\rtimes \\mathrm{S}_{12})]^\\frac{1}{2}</math>, \nin the notation of [[Robert Griess|Griess]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}.\n\n===Generalizations===\nWhen the centre facet symmetries are taken into account, the symmetry group is a [[subgroup]] of\n\n: <math>[\\mathbb Z_4^6 \\times (\\mathbb Z_3^7 \\rtimes \\mathrm S_8) \\times (\\mathbb Z_2^{11} \\rtimes \\mathrm S_{12})]^\\frac{1}{2}.</math>\n\n''(This unimportance of centre facet rotations is an implicit example of a [[quotient group]] at work, shielding the reader from the full [[automorphism group]] of the object in question.)''\n\nThe symmetry group of the Rubik's Cube obtained by dismembering it and reassembling is slightly larger: namely it is the [[direct product of groups|direct product]]\n\n: <math>\\mathbb Z_4^6 \\times (\\mathbb Z_3 \\wr \\mathrm S_8) \\times (\\mathbb Z_2\\wr \\mathrm S_{12}).</math>\n\nThe first factor is accounted for solely by rotations of the centre pieces, the second solely by symmetries of the corners, and the third solely by symmetries of the edges. The latter two factors are examples of [[wreath product]]s.\n\nThe [[simple group]]s that occur as quotients in the [[composition series]] of the standard cube group (i.e. ignoring centre piece rotations) are <math>A_8</math>, <math>A_{12}</math>, <math>\\mathbb Z_3</math> (7 times), and <math>\\mathbb Z_2</math> (12 times).\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Commutator]]\n*[[Conjugacy class]] -Conjugates\n*[[Coset]]\n*[[Optimal solutions for Rubik's Cube]]\n*[[Solvable group]]\n*[[Morwen Thistlethwaite#Thistlethwaite's algorithm|Thistlethwaite's algorithm]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Rubik's Cube}}\n\n[[Category:Finite groups]]\n[[Category:Permutation groups]]\n[[Category:Rubik's Cube]]"

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''signalizer functor''' gives the intersections of a potential subgroup of a finite group  with the [[centralizer]]s of nontrivial elements of an abelian group. The '''signalizer functor theorem''' gives conditions under which a signalizer functor comes from a subgroup.  The idea is to try to construct a <math>p'</math>-subgroup of a finite group <math>G</math>, which has a good chance of being normal in <math>G</math>, by taking as generators certain <math>p'</math>-subgroups of the centralizers of nonidentity elements in one or several given noncyclic elementary abelian <math>p</math>-subgroups of <math>G.</math> The technique has origins in the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]], and was subsequently developed by many people including {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1969|}} who defined signalizer functors, {{harvtxt|Glauberman|1976}} who proved the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem for solvable groups, and {{harvs|txt|last=McBride|year1=1982a|year2=1982b}} who proved it for all groups.  This theorem is needed to prove the so-called \"dichotomy\" stating that a given nonabelian finite [[simple group]] either has local characteristic two, or is of component type. It thus plays a major role in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''A'' be a noncyclic elementary abelian [[P-group|''p''-subgroup]] of the finite group ''G.'' An '''A-signalizer functor on ''G''''' or simply a '''signalizer functor''' when ''A'' and ''G'' are clear is a mapping ''θ'' from the set of nonidentity elements of ''A'' to the set of ''A''-invariant ''p′''-subgroups of ''G'' satisfying the following properties:\n*For every nonidentity <math>a\\in A</math>, the group <math>\\theta(a) </math> is contained in <math>C_G(a).</math>\n*For every nonidentity <math>a, b\\in A</math>, we have <math>\\theta(a) \\cap C_G(b) \\subseteq \\theta(b).</math>\n\nThe second condition above is called the '''balance condition.''' If the subgroups <math>\\theta(a)</math> are all [[solvable group|solvable]], then the signalizer functor <math>\\theta</math> itself is said to be solvable.\n\n==Solvable signalizer functor theorem==\nGiven <math>\\theta,</math> certain additional, relatively mild, assumptions allow one to prove that the subgroup <math>W= \\langle \\theta(a) \\mid a \\in  A, a \\neq 1\\rangle</math> of <math>G</math> generated by the subgroups <math>\\theta(a)</math> is in fact a <math>p'</math>-subgroup. The Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem proved by Glauberman and mentioned above says that this will be the case if <math>\\theta</math> is solvable and <math>A</math> has at least three generators. The theorem also states that under these assumptions, <math>W</math> itself will be solvable.\n\nSeveral earlier versions of the theorem were proven: {{harvtxt|Gorenstein|1969|}} proved this under the stronger assumption that <math>A</math> had rank at least 5. {{harvs|txt|last=Goldschmidt|year1=1972a|year2=1972b}} proved this under the assumption that <math>A</math> had rank at least 4 or was a 2-group of rank at least 3. {{harvtxt|Bender|1975}} gave a simple proof for 2-groups using the [[ZJ theorem]], and a proof in a similar spirit has been given for all primes by {{harvtxt|Flavell|2007}}. {{harvtxt|Glauberman|1976}} gave the definitive result for solvable signalizer functors.  Using the classification of finite simple groups, {{harvs|txt|last=McBride|year1=1982a|year2=1982b}} showed that <math>W</math> is a <math>p'</math>-group without the assumption that <math>\\theta</math> is solvable.\n\n===Completeness===\nThe terminology of completeness is often used in discussions of signalizer functors. Let <math>\\theta</math> be a signalizer functor as above, and consider the set И of all <math>A</math>-invariant <math>p'</math>-subgroups <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> satisfying the following condition:\n*<math>H\\cap C_G(a) \\subseteq \\theta(a)</math> for all nonidentity <math>a \\in A.</math>\nFor example, the subgroups <math>\\theta(a)</math> belong to И by the balance condition. The signalizer functor <math>\\theta</math> is said to be '''complete''' if И has a unique maximal element when ordered by containment. In this case, the unique maximal element can be shown to coincide with <math>W</math> above, and <math>W</math> is called the '''completion''' of <math>\\theta</math>. If <math>\\theta</math> is complete, and <math>W</math> turns out to be solvable, then <math>\\theta</math> is said to be '''solvably complete.'''\n\nThus, the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem can be rephrased by saying that if <math>A</math> has at least three generators, then every solvable <math>A</math>-signalizer functor on <math>G</math> is solvably complete.\n\n==Examples of signalizer functors==\nThe easiest way to obtain a signalizer functor is to start with an <math>A</math>-invariant <math>p'</math>-subgroup <math>M</math> of <math>G,</math> and define <math>\\theta(a) = M\\cap C_G(a)</math> for all nonidentity <math>a \\in A.</math> In practice, however, one begins with <math>\\theta</math> and uses it to construct the <math>A</math>-invariant <math>p'</math>-group.\n\nThe simplest signalizer functor used in practice is this:\n<math>\\theta(a) = O_{p'}(C_G(a)).</math>\n\nA few words of caution are needed here. First, note that <math>\\theta(a)</math> as defined above is indeed an <math>A</math>-invariant <math>p'</math>-subgroup of <math>G</math> because <math>A</math> is abelian. However, some additional assumptions are needed to show that this <math>\\theta</math> satisfies the balance condition. One sufficient criterion is that for each nonidentity <math>a \\in A,</math> the group <math>C_G(a)</math> is solvable (or <math>p</math>-solvable or even <math>p</math>-constrained). Verifying the balance condition for this <math>\\theta</math> under this assumption requires a famous lemma, known as [[John G. Thompson|Thompson's]] <math>P\\times Q</math>-lemma. (Note, this lemma is also called Thompson's <math>A \\times B</math>-lemma, but the <math>A</math> in this use must not be confused with the <math>A</math> appearing in the definition of a signalizer functor!)\n\n==Coprime action==\nTo obtain a better understanding of signalizer functors, it is essential to know the following general fact about finite groups:\n*Let <math>E</math> be an abelian noncyclic group acting on the finite group <math>X.</math> Assume that the orders of <math>E</math> and <math>X</math> are relatively prime. Then\n<math>X = \\langle C_X(E_0) \\mid E_0 \\subseteq E, \\text{ and } E/E_0 \\text{ cyclic }\\rangle</math>\n\nTo prove this fact, one uses the [[Schur–Zassenhaus theorem]] to show that for each prime <math>q</math> dividing the order of <math>X,</math> the group <math>X</math> has an <math>E</math>-invariant Sylow <math>q</math>-subgroup. This reduces to the case where <math>X</math> is a <math>q</math>-group. Then an argument by induction on the order of <math>X</math> reduces the statement further to the case where <math>X</math> is elementary abelian with <math>E</math> acting  irreducibly. This forces the group <math>E/C_E(X)</math> to be cyclic, and the result follows. See either of the books {{harvtxt|Aschbacher|2000}} or {{harvtxt|Kurzweil|Stellmacher|2004}} for details.\n\nThis is used in both the proof and applications of the Solvable Signalizer Functor Theorem. To begin, notice that it quickly implies the claim that if <math>\\theta</math> is complete, then its completion is the group <math>W</math> defined above.\n\n==Normal completion==\nThe completion of a signalizer functor has a \"good chance\" of being normal in <math>G,</math> according to the top of the article. Here, the coprime action fact will be used to motivate this claim.

Space groups are also studied in dimensions other than 3 where they are sometimes called '''[[Ludwig Bieberbach|Bieberbach]] groups''', and are discrete [[Cocompact group action|cocompact]]  [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of isometries of an oriented Euclidean space.\n\nIn [[crystallography]], space groups are also called the '''crystallographic''' or '''[[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] groups''', and represent a description of the [[symmetry]] of the crystal. A definitive source regarding 3-dimensional space groups is the ''International Tables for Crystallography'' ({{harvtxt|Hahn|2002}}).\n\n==History==\nSpace groups in 2 dimensions are the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s which have been known for several centuries, though the proof that the list was complete was only given in 1891, after the much more difficult classification of space groups had been completed.\n\nIn 1879 [[Leonhard Sohncke]] listed the 65 space groups (called Sohncke groups) whose elements preserve the orientation. More accurately, he listed 66 groups, but Fedorov and Schönflies both noticed that two of them were really the same. The space groups in three dimensions were first enumerated by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Evgraf Fedorov|last=Fedorov|year=1891}} (whose list had two omissions (I{{overline|4}}3d and Fdd2) and one duplication (Fmm2)), and shortly afterwards were independently enumerated by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Arthur Moritz Schönflies|last=Schönflies|year=1891}} (whose list had four omissions (I{{overline|4}}3d, Pc, Cc, ?) and one duplication (P{{overline|4}}2<sub>1</sub>m)). The correct list of 230 space groups was found by 1892 during correspondence between Fedorov and Schönflies. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=William Barlow (geologist)|last=Barlow|year=1894}} later enumerated the groups with a different method, but omitted four groups (Fdd2, I{{overline|4}}2d, P{{overline|4}}2<sub>1</sub>d, and P{{overline|4}}2<sub>1</sub>c) even though he already had the correct list of 230 groups from Fedorov and Schönflies; the common claim that Barlow was unaware of their work is a myth.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n{{harvtxt|Burckhardt|1967}} describes the history of the discovery of the space groups in detail.\n\n==Elements==\nThe space groups in three dimensions are made from combinations of the 32 [[crystallographic point group]]s with the 14 [[Bravais lattice]]s, each of the latter belonging to one of 7 [[lattice system]]s.  This results in a space group being some combination of the translational symmetry of a [[unit cell]] including lattice centering, the point group symmetry operations of [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]], [[rotation]] and [[improper rotation]] (also called rotoinversion), and the [[screw axis]] and [[glide plane]] symmetry operations.  The combination of all these symmetry operations results in a total of 230 different space groups describing all possible crystal symmetries.\n\n===Elements fixing a point===\nThe elements of the space group fixing a point of space are the identity element, reflections, rotations and [[improper rotation]]s.\n\n===Translations===\nThe translations form a normal abelian subgroup of rank 3, called the Bravais lattice. There are 14 possible types of Bravais lattice. The [[Quotient (group theory)|quotient]] of the space group by the Bravais lattice is a finite group which is one of the 32 possible [[point group]]s. Translation is defined as the face moves from one point to another point.\n\n===Glide planes===\nA [[glide plane]] is a reflection in a plane, followed by a translation parallel with that plane. This is noted by ''a'', ''b'' or ''c'', depending on which axis the glide is along.  There is also the ''n'' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of a face, and the ''d'' glide, which is a fourth of the way along either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The latter is called the diamond glide plane as it features in the [[diamond]] structure. In 17 space groups, due to the centering of the cell, the glides occur in two perpendicular directions simultaneously, ''i.e.'' the same glide plane can be called ''b'' or ''c'', ''a'' or ''b'', ''a'' or ''c''. For example, group Abm2 could be also called Acm2, group Ccca could be called Cccb. In 1992, it was suggested to use symbol ''e'' for such planes. The symbols for five space groups have been modified:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Space group No. !! 39 !! 41 !! 64 !! 67 !! 68\n|-\n! New symbol\n| Aem2 || Aea2|| Cmce|| Cmme|| Ccce\n|-\n! Old Symbol\n| Abm2|| Aba2|| Cmca|| Cmma|| Ccca\n|}\n\n===Screw axes===\nA [[screw axis]] is a rotation about an axis, followed by a translation along the direction of the axis.  These are noted by a number, ''n'', to describe the degree of rotation, where the number is how many operations must be applied to complete a full rotation (e.g., 3 would mean a rotation one third of the way around the axis each time).  The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector.  So, 2<sub>1</sub> is a twofold rotation followed by a translation of 1/2 of the lattice vector.\n\n=== General formula ===\nThe general formula for the action of an element of a space group is\n\n''y'' = ''M''.''x'' + ''D''\n\nwhere ''M'' is its matrix, ''D'' is its vector, and where the element transforms point ''x'' into point ''y''. In general, ''D'' = ''D''([[lattice (group)|lattice]]) + ''D''(''M''), where ''D''(''M'') is a unique function of ''M'' that is zero for ''M'' being the identity. The matrices ''M'' form a [[point group]] that is a basis of the space group; the lattice must be symmetric under that point group.\n\nThe lattice dimension can be less than the overall dimension, resulting in a \"subperiodic\" space group. For (overall dimension, lattice dimension):\n* (1,1): One-dimensional [[line group]]s\n* (2,1): Two-dimensional [[line group]]s: [[frieze group]]s\n* (2,2): [[Wallpaper group]]s\n* (3,1): Three-dimensional [[line group]]s; with the 3D crystallographic point groups, the [[rod group]]s\n* (3,2): [[Layer group]]s\n* (3,3): The space groups discussed in this article\n\n==Notation==\n{{further|List of space groups}}\nThere are at least ten methods of naming space groups.  Some of these methods can assign several different names to the same space group, so altogether there are many thousands of different names.\n\n*'''Number'''. The International Union of Crystallography publishes tables of all space group types, and assigns each a unique number from 1 to 230.  The numbering is arbitrary, except that groups with the same crystal system or point group are given consecutive numbers.\n*'''International symbol''' or '''[[Hermann–Mauguin notation]]'''. The Hermann–Mauguin (or international) notation describes the lattice and some generators for the group. It has a shortened form called the '''international short symbol''', which is the one most commonly used in crystallography, and usually consists of a set of four symbols.  The first describes the centering of the Bravais lattice (''P'', ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''I'', ''R'' or ''F'').  The next three describe the most prominent symmetry operation visible when projected along one of the high symmetry directions of the crystal. These symbols are the same as used in [[point group]]s, with the addition of glide planes and screw axis, described above.  By way of example, the space group of [[quartz]] is P3<sub>1</sub>21, showing that it exhibits primitive centering of the motif (i.e., once per unit cell), with a threefold screw axis and a twofold rotation axis.  Note that it does not explicitly contain the [[crystal system]], although this is unique to each space group (in the case of ''P''3<sub>1</sub>21, it is trigonal).\n\n:In the international short symbol the first symbol (3<sub>1</sub> in this example) denotes the symmetry along the major axis (c-axis in trigonal cases), the second (2 in this case) along axes of secondary importance (a and b) and the third symbol the symmetry in another direction. In the trigonal case there also exists a space group P3<sub>1</sub>12. In this space group the twofold axes are not along the a and b-axes but in a direction rotated by 30°.\n\n:The international symbols and international short symbols for some of the space groups were changed slightly between 1935 and 2002, so several space groups have 4 different international symbols in use.\n\nThe viewing directions of the 7 crystal systems are shown as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n! Position in the symbol\n! Triclinic \n! Monoclinic\n! Orthorhombic\n! Tetragonal\n! Trigonal\n! Hexagonal\n!

Space group notation with an explicit origin. Rotation, translation and axis-direction symbols are clearly separated and inversion centers are explicitly defined. The construction and format of the notation make it particularly suited to computer generation of symmetry information. For example, group number 3 has three Hall symbols: P 2y (P 1 2 1), P 2 (P 1 1 2), P 2x (P 2 1 1).\n*'''[[Schönflies notation#Space groups|Schönflies notation]]'''. The space groups with given point group are numbered  by 1, 2, 3, ...  (in the same order as their international number) and this number is added as a superscript to the Schönflies symbol for the point group. For example, groups numbers 3 to 5 whose point group is ''C''<sub>2</sub> have Schönflies symbols ''C''{{sup sub|1|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|2|2}}, ''C''{{sup sub|3|2}}.\n*'''[[Evgraf Fedorov|Fedorov]] notation'''\n*'''Shubnikov symbol'''\n*'''[[Strukturbericht designation]]''' is related notation for crystal structures given a letter and index: '''A''' Elements (monatomic), '''B''' for AB compounds, '''C''' for AB<sub>2</sub> compounds, '''D''' for A<sub>m </sub>B<sub>n</sub> compounds, ('''E''', '''F''', …, '''K''' More complex compounds), '''L''' Alloys, '''O''' Organic compounds, '''S''' Silicates. Some structure designation share the same space groups. For example, space group 225 is A<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, and C<sub>1</sub>. Space group 221 is A<sub>h</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strukturbericht|title=Strukturbericht - Wikimedia Commons|website=commons.wikimedia.org}}</ref>  However, crystallographers would not use Strukturbericht notation to describe the space group, rather it would be used to describe a specific crystal structure (e.g. space group + atomic arrangement (motif)).\n* 2D:'''[[Orbifold notation]]''' and 3D:[[Fibrifold notation]]. As the name suggests, the orbifold notation describes the orbifold, given by the quotient of Euclidean space by the space group, rather than generators of the space group. It was introduced by [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] and [[William Thurston|Thurston]], and is not used much outside mathematics. Some of the space groups have several different fibrifolds associated to them, so have several different fibrifold symbols.\n*'''[[Coxeter notation]]''' – Spatial and point symmetry groups, represented as modications of the pure reflectional [[Coxeter group]]s.\n* [[Geometric notation]]<ref>[[PDF]] [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/CrystalGA.pdf The Crystallographic Space Groups in Geometric Algebra], David Hestenes and Jeremy Holt</ref> is a [[Geometric algebra]] notation.\n\n==Classification systems==\nThere are (at least) 10 different ways to classify space groups into classes. The relations between  some of  these are described in the following table. Each classification system is a refinement of the ones below it.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|colspan=2|'''(Crystallographic) space group types''' (230 in three dimensions). Two space groups, considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of space, have the same space group type if they are conjugate by an  orientation-preserving affine transformation. In three dimensions, for 11 of the [[affine space]] groups, there is no orientation-preserving map from the group to its mirror image, so if one distinguishes groups from their mirror images these each split into two cases. So there are 54&nbsp;+&nbsp;11&nbsp;=&nbsp;65 space group types that preserve orientation.\n|-\n|colspan=2|'''Affine space group types''' (219 in three dimensions). Two space groups, considered as subgroups of the group of affine transformations of space, have the same affine space group type if they are conjugate under an affine transformation. The affine space group type is determined by the underlying abstract group of the space group. In three dimensions there are 54 affine space group types that preserve orientation.\n|-\n|colspan=2|'''Arithmetic crystal classes''' (73 in three dimensions). Sometimes called Z-classes. These are determined by the point group together with the action of the point group on the subgroup of translations.  In other words, the arithmetic crystal classes correspond to conjugacy classes of finite subgroup of the general linear group GL<sub>n</sub>('''Z''') over the integers.  A space group is called '''symmorphic''' (or '''split''')  if there is a point such that all symmetries are the product of a symmetry fixing this point and a translation. Equivalently, a space group is symmorphic if it is a [[semidirect product]] of its point group with its translation subgroup. There are 73 symmorphic space groups, with exactly one in each arithmetic crystal class. There are also 157 nonsymmorphic space group types with varying numbers in the arithmetic crystal classes.\n\nArithmetic crystal classes may be interpreted as different orientations of the point groups in the lattice, with the group elements' matrix components being constrained to have integer coefficients in lattice space. This is rather easy to picture in the two-dimensional, [[wallpaper group]] case. Some of the point groups have reflections, and the reflection lines can be along the lattice directions, halfway in between them, or both.\n* None: C<sub>1</sub>: p1; C<sub>2</sub>: p2; C<sub>3</sub>: p3; C<sub>4</sub>: p4; C<sub>6</sub>: p6\n* Along: D<sub>1</sub>: pm, pg; D<sub>2</sub>: pmm, pmg, pgg; D<sub>3</sub>: p31m\n* Between: D<sub>1</sub>: cm; D<sub>2</sub>: cmm; D<sub>3</sub>: p3m1\n* Both: D<sub>4</sub>: p4m, p4g; D<sub>6</sub>: p6m\n|-\n|'''(geometric) [[Crystal classes]]''' (32 in three dimensions). Sometimes called Q-classes. The crystal class of a space group is determined by its point group: the quotient by the subgroup of translations, acting on the lattice. Two space groups are in the same crystal class if and only if their point groups, which are subgroups of GL<sub>n</sub>('''Z'''), are conjugate in the larger group GL<sub>n</sub>('''Q''').\n|'''Bravais flocks''' (14 in three dimensions). These are determined by the underlying Bravais lattice type. \nThese correspond to conjugacy classes of  lattice point groups in GL<sub>n</sub>('''Z'''), where the lattice point group is the group of symmetries of the underlying lattice that fix a point of the lattice, and contains the point group.\n|-\n|'''[[Crystal systems]]'''. (7 in three dimensions) Crystal systems are an ad hoc modification of the lattice systems to make them compatible with the classification according to point groups. They differ from crystal families in that the hexagonal crystal family is split into two subsets, called the trigonal and hexagonal crystal systems. The trigonal crystal system is larger than the rhombohedral lattice system, the hexagonal crystal system is smaller than the hexagonal lattice system, and the remaining crystal systems and lattice systems are the same. \n|'''[[Lattice system]]s''' (7 in three dimensions). The lattice system of a space group is determined by the conjugacy class of the lattice point group (a subgroup of GL<sub>n</sub>('''Z''')) in the larger group GL<sub>n</sub>('''Q'''). In three dimensions the lattice point group can have one of the 7 different orders 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, or 48. The hexagonal crystal family is split into two subsets, called the rhombohedral and hexagonal lattice systems. \n|-\n|colspan=2|'''[[Crystal families]]''' (6 in three dimensions). The point group of a space group does not quite determine its lattice system, because occasionally two space groups with the same point group may be in different lattice systems. Crystal families are formed from lattice systems by merging the two lattice systems whenever this happens, so that the crystal family of a space group is determined by either its lattice system or its point group. In 3 dimensions the only two lattice families that get merged in this way are the hexagonal and rhombohedral lattice systems, which are combined into the hexagonal crystal family.  The 6 crystal families in 3 dimensions are called triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, hexagonal, and cubic. Crystal families  are commonly used in popular books on crystals, where they are sometimes called crystal systems.\n|}\n\n{{harvs|txt | last1=Conway  | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Delgado Friedrichs | last3=Huson |  last4=Thurston |  author4-link=William Thurston | title=On three-dimensional space groups | url=http://www.emis.de/journals/BAG/vol.42/no.2/17.html |mr=1865535 | year=2001 | journal=Beiträge zur Algebra und Geometrie.

They divided the 219 affine space groups into reducible and irreducible groups. The reducible groups fall into 17 classes corresponding to the 17 [[wallpaper group]]s, and the remaining 35 irreducible groups are the same as the [[cubic crystal system#Cubic space groups|cubic groups]] and are classified separately.\n\n==In other  dimensions==\n\n===Bieberbach's theorems===\nIn ''n'' dimensions, an affine space group, or Bieberbach group, is a discrete subgroup of isometries of ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space with a compact fundamental domain. {{harvs|txt|last=Bieberbach|year1=1911|year2=1912}} proved that the subgroup of translations of any such group contains ''n'' linearly independent translations, and is a free [[Abelian group|abelian]] subgroup of finite index, and is also the unique maximal normal abelian subgroup. He also showed that in any dimension ''n'' there are  only a finite number of possibilities for the isomorphism class of the underlying group of a space group, and moreover the action of the group on Euclidean space is unique up to conjugation by affine transformations. This answers part of [[Hilbert's eighteenth problem]]. {{harvtxt|Zassenhaus|1948}} showed that conversely any group that is the extension{{definition|date=January 2019}} of '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> by a finite group acting faithfully is an [[Affine space|affine]] space group. Combining these results shows that classifying space groups in ''n'' dimensions up to conjugation by affine transformations is essentially the same as classifying isomorphism classes for groups that are extensions of '''Z'''<sup>''n''</sup> by a finite group acting faithfully.\n\nIt is essential in Bieberbach's theorems to assume that the group acts as isometries; the theorems do not generalize to discrete cocompact groups of affine transformations of Euclidean space.

These symmetries contain an element known as time reversal. They treat time as an additional dimension, and the group elements can include time reversal as reflection in it. They are of importance in [[magnetic structure]]s that contain ordered unpaired spins, i.e. [[ferromagnetism|ferro-]], [[ferrimagnetism|ferri-]] or [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] structures as studied by [[neutron diffraction]]. The time reversal element flips a magnetic spin while leaving all other structure the same and it can be combined with a number of other symmetry elements. Including time reversal there are 1651 magnetic space groups in 3D {{harv|Kim|1999|loc=p.428}}. It has also been possible to construct magnetic versions for other overall and lattice dimensions ([https://web.archive.org/web/20111119065722/http://www.bk.psu.edu/faculty/litvin/Download.html Daniel Litvin's papers], {{harv|Litvin|2008}}, {{harv|Litvin|2005}}). Frieze groups are magnetic 1D line groups and layer groups are magnetic wallpaper groups, and the axial 3D point groups are magnetic 2D point groups.

An ''e'' plane is a double glide plane, one having glides in two different directions. They are found in seven orthorhombic, five tetragonal and five cubic space groups, all with centered lattice. The use of the symbol ''e'' became official with {{harvtxt|Hahn|2002}}.\n\nThe lattice system can be found as follows. If the crystal system is not trigonal then the lattice system is of the same type. If the crystal system is trigonal, then the lattice system is hexagonal unless the space group is one of the seven in the [[rhombohedral lattice system]] consisting of the 7 trigonal space groups in the table above whose name begins with R. (The term rhombohedral system is also sometimes used as an alternative name for the whole trigonal system.) The [[hexagonal lattice system]] is larger than the hexagonal crystal system, and consists of the hexagonal crystal system together with the 18 groups of the trigonal crystal system other than the seven whose names begin with R.\n\nThe [[Bravais lattice]] of the space group is determined by the lattice system together with the initial letter of its name, which for the non-rhombohedral groups is P, I, F, or C, standing for the principal, body centered, face centered, or C-face centered lattices.\n\n== Derivation of the crystal class from the space group ==\n\n# Leave out the Bravais type\n# Convert all symmetry elements with translational components into their respective symmetry elements without translation symmetry (Glide planes are converted into simple mirror planes; Screw axes are converted into simple axes of rotation)\n# Axes of rotation, rotoinversion  axes and mirror planes remain unchanged.\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Barlow | first1=W | title=Über die geometrischen Eigenschaften starrer Strukturen und ihre Anwendung auf Kristalle | year=1894 | journal=Z.

The '''Tate cohomology groups''' <math>\\hat H^n(G,A)</math> are defined by\n*<math>\\hat H^n(G,A) = H^n(G,A)</math> for ''n''≥ 1,\n*<math>\\hat H^0(G,A)=\\operatorname {coker} N=</math> quotient of ''H''<sup>0</sup>(''G'',''A'') by norms of elements of ''A'',\n*<math>\\hat H^{-1}(G,A)=\\ker N=</math> quotient of norm 0 elements of ''A'' by principal elements of ''A'',\n*<math>\\hat H^n(G,A) = H_{-(n+1)}(G,A)</math> for ''n''≤ &minus;2.\n\n==Properties==\nIf \n:<math> 0 \\longrightarrow A \\longrightarrow B \\longrightarrow C \\longrightarrow 0</math>\nis a short exact sequence of ''G''-modules, then we get the usual long exact sequence of Tate cohomology groups:\n:<math>\\cdots \\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n}(G,A)\\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n}(G,B)\\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n}(G,C)\\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n+1}(G,A)\\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n+1}(G,B)\\cdots</math>\n\nIf ''A'' is an induced ''G'' module then all Tate cohomology groups of ''A'' vanish.\n\nThe zeroth Tate cohomology group of ''A'' is \n:(Fixed points of ''G'' on ''A'')/(Obvious fixed points of ''G'' acting on ''A'')\nwhere by the \"obvious\" fixed point we mean those of the form Σ ''g''(''a''). In other words, \nthe zeroth cohomology group in some sense describes the non-obvious fixed points of ''G'' acting on ''A''.\n\nThe Tate cohomology groups are characterized by the three properties above.\n\n==Tate's theorem==\n\nTate's theorem {{harv|Tate|1952}} gives conditions for multiplication by a cohomology class to be an isomorphism between cohomology groups. There are several slightly different versions of it; a version that is particularly convenient for [[class field theory]] is as follows:\n\nSuppose that ''A'' is a module over a finite group ''G'' and ''a'' is an element of ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''G'',''A''), such that for every subgroup ''E'' of ''G''\n*''H''<sup>1</sup>(''E'',''A'') is trivial, and \n*''H''<sup>2</sup>(''E'',''A'') is generated by Res(a) which has order ''E''.\nThen  cup product with ''a'' is an isomorphism\n*<math>\\hat H^n(G,\\mathbb{Z})\\longrightarrow\\hat H^{n+2}(G,A)</math>\nfor all ''n''; in other words the graded Tate cohomology of ''A'' is isomorphic to \nthe Tate cohomology with integral coefficients, with the degree shifted by 2.\n\n==Tate-Farrell cohomology==\nFarrell extended Tate cohomology groups to the case of all groups ''G'' of finite [[virtual cohomological dimension]]. In Farrell's theory, the groups \n<math>\\hat H^n(G,A)</math> are isomorphic to the usual cohomology groups whenever ''n'' is greater than the virtual cohomological dimension of the group ''G''. Finite groups have virtual cohomological dimension 0, and in this case Farrell's cohomology groups are the same as those of Tate.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Herbrand quotient]]\n*[[Class formation]]\n\n==References==\n* [[M.

There are three orthogonal 2-fold rotation axes, like chiral [[Dihedral symmetry in three dimensions|dihedral symmetry]] ''D''<sub>2</sub> or 222, with in addition four 3-fold axes, centered ''between'' the three orthogonal directions. This group is [[isomorphic]] to ''A''<sub>4</sub>, the [[alternating group]] on 4 elements; in fact it is the group of [[even permutation]]s of the four 3-fold axes: e, (123), (132), (124), (142), (134), (143), (234), (243), (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23).\n\nThe [[conjugacy class]]es of T are:\n*identity\n*4 × rotation by 120° clockwise (seen from a vertex): (234), (143), (412), (321)\n*4 × rotation by 120° counterclockwise (ditto)\n*3 × rotation by 180°\n\nThe rotations by 180°, together with the identity, form a [[normal subgroup]] of type Dih<sub>2</sub>, with [[quotient group]] of type Z<sub>3</sub>.

Although it is a property for the abstract group in general, it is clear from the isometry group of chiral tetrahedral symmetry: because of the chirality the subgroup would have to be C<sub>6</sub> or D<sub>3</sub>, but neither applies.\n\n===Subgroups of chiral tetrahedral symmetry===\n[[File:Chiral tetrahedral subgroup tree.png|thumb|Chiral tetrahedral symmetry subgroups]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n![[Schoenflies notation|Schoe.]]\n!colspan=2|[[Coxeter notation|Coxeter]]\n![[Orbifold notation|Orb.]]\n![[Hermann–Mauguin notation|H-M]]\n!Generators\n![[List of small groups|Structure]]\n![[Cycle graph (algebra)|Cyc]]\n![[Symmetry number|Order]]\n![[Index of a subgroup|Index]]\n|-align=center BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0f0\"\n| T||[3,3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h2|split1|branch_h2h2|label2}}||332||23||2||[[Alternating group|A<sub>4</sub>]] || [[File:GroupDiagramMiniA4.svg|25px]]||12||1\n|-align=center BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0f0\"\n| D<sub>2</sub>||[2,2]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2|2x|node_h2}} = {{CDD|node_h2|split1-22|branch_h2h2|label2}}||222||222||3||[[Dihedral group|Dih<sub>2</sub>]]|| [[File:GroupDiagramMiniD4.svg|25px]]||4||3\n|-align=center BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0f0\"\n| C<sub>3</sub> ||[3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||33||3||1||[[Cyclic group|Z<sub>3</sub>]]||[[File:GroupDiagramMiniC3.svg|25px]]||3||4\n|-align=center BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0f0\"\n|C<sub>2</sub>||[2]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|2x|node_h2}}||22||2||1||Z<sub>2</sub>||[[File:GroupDiagramMiniC2.svg|25px]]||2||6\n|-align=center BGCOLOR=\"#f0e0f0\"\n|C<sub>1</sub>||[&nbsp;]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2}}||11||1||1||Z<sub>1</sub>||[[File:GroupDiagramMiniC1.svg|25px]]||1||12\n|}\n\n==Achiral tetrahedral symmetry==\n[[Image:Sphere symmetry group td.png|150px|thumb|right|The full tetrahedral group T<sub>d</sub> with fundamental domain]]\n'''T<sub>d</sub>''', '''*332''', [3,3] or {{overline|4}}3m, of order 24 – '''achiral''' or '''full tetrahedral symmetry''', also known as the (2,3,3) [[triangle group]].

It is the direct product of the normal subgroup of T (see above) with [[point reflection|C<sub>''i''</sub>]].  The [[quotient group]] is the same as above: of type Z<sub>3</sub>.

The symmetries correspond to the even permutations of the body diagonals and the same combined with inversion. It is also the symmetry of a [[pyritohedron]], which is extremely similar to the cube described, with each rectangle replaced by a pentagon with one symmetry axis and 4 equal sides and 1 different side (the one corresponding to the line segment dividing the cube's face); i.e., the cube's faces bulge out at the dividing line and become narrower there.

      "text": "{{about|a geometric concept|Weihai, China-based tire manufacturing company|Triangle Group}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''triangle group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that can be realized geometrically by sequences of [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] across the sides of a [[triangle]].  The triangle can be an ordinary [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] triangle, a [[Schwarz triangle|triangle on the sphere]], or a [[hyperbolic triangle]]. Each triangle group is the [[symmetry group]] of a [[tessellation|tiling]] of the [[Euclidean plane]], the [[sphere]], or the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] by [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles called [[Möbius triangle]]s, each one a [[fundamental domain]] for the action.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''l'', ''m'', ''n'' be [[integer]]s greater than or equal to 2. A '''triangle group''' Δ(''l'',''m'',''n'') is a group of motions of the Euclidean plane, the two-dimensional sphere, the real projective plane, or the hyperbolic plane generated by the [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s in the sides of a [[triangle]] with angles π/''l'', π/''m'' and π/''n'' (measured in [[radian]]s). The product of the reflections in two adjacent sides is a [[rotation]] by the angle which is twice the angle between those sides, 2π/''l'', 2π/''m'' and 2π/''n''. Therefore, if the generating reflections are labeled ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and the angles between them in the cyclic order are as given above, then the following relations hold:\n\n# <math> a^{2}=b^{2}=c^{2}=1 </math>\n# <math> (ab)^{l}=(bc)^{n}=(ca)^{m}=1. </math>\n\nIt is a theorem that all other relations between ''a, b, c'' are consequences of these relations and that Δ(''l,m,n'') is a [[discrete group]] of motions of the corresponding space. Thus a triangle group is a [[reflection group]] that admits a [[group presentation]]\n\n:<math> \\Delta(l,m,n) = \\langle a,b,c \\mid a^{2} =  b^{2} = c^{2} = (ab)^{l} = (bc)^{n} = (ca)^{m} =  1 \\rangle. </math>\n\nAn abstract group with this presentation is a [[Coxeter group]] with three generators.\n\n==Classification==\nGiven any natural numbers ''l'',&nbsp;''m'',&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 exactly one of the classical two-dimensional geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic) admits a triangle with the angles (π/l, π/m, π/n), and the space is tiled by reflections of the triangle. The sum of the angles of the triangle determines the type of the geometry by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]: it is Euclidean if the angle sum is exactly π, spherical if it exceeds π and hyperbolic if it is strictly smaller than π. Moreover, any two triangles with the given angles are congruent. Each triangle group determines a tiling, which is conventionally colored in two colors, so that any two adjacent tiles have opposite colors.\n\nIn terms of the numbers ''l'',&nbsp;''m'',&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 there are the following possibilities.\n\n===The Euclidean case===\n<math>\\frac{1}{l}+\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}=1.</math>\n\nThe triangle group is the infinite [[symmetry group]] of a certain [[tessellation]] (or tiling) of the Euclidean plane by triangles whose angles add up to π (or 180°). Up to permutations, the triple (''l'',&nbsp;''m'',&nbsp;''n'') is one of the triples (2,3,6), (2,4,4), (3,3,3). The corresponding triangle groups are instances of [[wallpaper group]]s.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!(2,3,6)\n!(2,4,4)\n!(3,3,3)\n|-\n|[[File:Tiling Dual Semiregular V4-6-12 Bisected Hexagonal.svg|240px]]\n|[[File:1-uniform 2 dual.svg|240px]]\n|[[File:Tiling Regular 3-6 Triangular.svg|240px]]\n|-\n![[bisected hexagonal tiling]]\n![[tetrakis square tiling]]\n![[triangular tiling]]\n|-\n|colspan=3|More detailed diagrams, labeling the vertices and showing how reflection operates:\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p6m.svg|240px]]\n|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p4m square.svg|150px]]\n|[[File:Wallpaper group diagram p3m1.svg|240px]]\n|}\n\n===The spherical case===\n:<math>\\frac{1}{l}+\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}>1.</math>\n\nThe triangle group is the finite symmetry group of a tiling of a unit sphere by spherical triangles, or [[Möbius triangle]]s, whose angles add up to a number greater than π. Up to permutations, the triple (''l'',''m'',''n'') has the form (2,3,3), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), or (2,2,''n''), ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1. Spherical triangle groups can be identified with the symmetry groups of [[platonic solid|regular polyhedra]] in the three-dimensional Euclidean space: Δ(2,3,3)  corresponds to the [[tetrahedron]], Δ(2,3,4)  to both the [[cube]] and the [[octahedron]] (which have the same symmetry group), Δ(2,3,5) to both the [[dodecahedron]] and the [[icosahedron]]. The groups Δ(2,2,''n''),  ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 of [[dihedral symmetry]] can be interpreted as the symmetry groups of the family of [[dihedra]], which are degenerate solids formed by two identical [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] joined together, or dually [[hosohedra]], which are formed by joining ''n'' [[digon]]s together at two vertices.\n\nThe [[spherical tiling]] corresponding to a regular polyhedron is obtained by forming the [[barycentric subdivision]] of the polyhedron and projecting the resulting points and lines onto the circumscribed sphere. In the case of the tetrahedron, there are four faces and each face is an equilateral triangle that is subdivided into 6 smaller pieces by the medians intersecting in the center. The resulting tesselation has 4 × 6=24 spherical triangles (it is the spherical [[disdyakis cube]]).\n\nThese groups are finite, which corresponds to the compactness of the sphere – areas of discs in the sphere initially grow in terms of radius, but eventually cover the entire sphere.\n\nThe triangular tilings are depicted below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!(2,2,2)\n!(2,2,3)\n!(2,2,4)\n!(2,2,5)\n!(2,2,6)\n!(2,2,n)\n|- align=center\n|[[Image:Spherical square bipyramid2.svg|80px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical hexagonal bipyramid2.png|80px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical octagonal bipyramid2.png|80px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical decagonal bipyramid2.png|80px]]\n|[[Image:Spherical dodecagonal bipyramid2.png|80px]]\n|\n|-\n!colspan=2|(2,3,3)\n!colspan=2|(2,3,4)\n!colspan=2|(2,3,5)\n|- align=center\n|colspan=2|[[Image:Tetrahedral reflection domains.png|150px]]\n|colspan=2|[[Image:Octahedral reflection domains.png|150px]]\n|colspan=2|[[Image:Icosahedral reflection domains.png|150px]]\n|}\n\nSpherical tilings corresponding to the octahedron and the icosahedron and dihedral spherical tilings with even ''n'' are [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]]. Hence each of them determines a tiling of the real projective plane, an '''[[elliptic tiling]]'''. Its symmetry group is the quotient of the spherical triangle group by the [[reflection through the origin]] (-''I''), which is a central element of order 2. Since the projective plane is a model of [[elliptic geometry]], such groups are called ''elliptic'' triangle groups.<ref>{{Harv|Magnus|1974}}</ref>\n\n===The hyperbolic case===\n:<math>\\frac{1}{l}+\\frac{1}{m}+\\frac{1}{n}<1.</math>\n\nThe triangle group is the infinite symmetry group of a [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|tiling of the hyperbolic plane]] by hyperbolic triangles whose angles add up to a number less than π. All triples not already listed represent tilings of the hyperbolic plane. For example, the triple (2,3,7) produces the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]].

Such subgroups are sometimes referred to as \"ordinary\" triangle groups<ref>{{Harv |Gross |Tucker |2001}}</ref> or '''von Dyck groups''', after [[Walther von Dyck]]. For spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic triangles, these correspond to the elements of the group that preserve the [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]] of the triangle – the group of rotations. For projective (elliptic) triangles, they cannot be so interpreted, as the projective plane is non-orientable, so there is no notion of \"orientation-preserving\". The reflections are however ''locally'' orientation-reversing (and every manifold is locally orientable, because locally Euclidean): they fix a line and at each point in the line are a reflection across the line.<ref>{{Harv|Magnus|1974|loc=p. 65}}</ref>\n\nThe group ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') is defined by the following presentation:\n:<math>D(l,m,n)=\\langle x,y \\mid x^l,y^m,(xy)^n\\rangle.</math>\nIn terms of the generators above, these are ''x = ab, y = ca, yx = cb''. Geometrically, the three elements ''x'', ''y'', ''xy'' correspond to rotations by 2π/''l'', 2π/''m'' and 2π/''n'' about the three vertices of the triangle.\n\nNote that ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') ≅ ''D''(''m'',''l'',''n'') ≅ ''D''(''n'',''m'',''l''), so ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') is independent of the order of the ''l'',''m'',''n''.\n\nA hyperbolic von Dyck group is a [[Fuchsian group]], a discrete group consisting of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane.\n\n== Overlapping tilings ==\n{{further|Schwarz triangle}}\nTriangle groups preserve a tiling by triangles, namely a [[fundamental domain]] for the action (the triangle defined by the lines of reflection), called a [[Möbius triangle]], and are given by a triple of ''integers,'' (''l'',''m'',''n''), – integers correspond to (2''l'',2''m'',2''n'') triangles coming together at a vertex. There are also tilings by overlapping triangles, which correspond to [[Schwarz triangle]]s with ''rational'' numbers (''l''/''a'',''m''/''b'',''n''/''c''), where the denominators are [[coprime]] to the numerators. This corresponds to edges meeting at angles of ''a''π/''l'' (resp.), which corresponds to a rotation of 2''a''π/''l'' (resp.), which has order ''l'' and is thus identical as an abstract group element, but distinct when represented by a reflection.\n\nFor example, the Schwarz triangle (2 3 3) yields a [[density (polytope)|density]] 1 tiling of the sphere, while the triangle (2 3/2 3) yields a density 3 tiling of the sphere, but with the same abstract group. These symmetries of overlapping tilings are not considered triangle groups.\n\n==History==\nTriangle groups date at least to the presentation of the [[icosahedral group]] as the (rotational) (2,3,5) triangle group by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his paper on [[icosian calculus]].<ref>{{citation\n|title=Memorandum respecting a new System of Roots of Unity\n|author=Sir William Rowan Hamilton\n|author-link=William Rowan Hamilton\n|url=http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Icosian/NewSys.pdf\n|journal=[[Philosophical Magazine]]\n|volume=12\n|year=1856\n|pages=446\n}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{external media\n| video1 = [http://www.xs4all.nl/~westy31/Geometry/vlib.gif Warped modular tiling]<ref name=\"westendorp\">[http://www.xs4all.nl/~westy31/Geometry/Geometry.html#Modular Platonic tilings of Riemann surfaces: The Modular Group], [http://www.xs4all.nl/~westy31/ Gerard Westendorp]</ref> – visualization of the map (2,3,∞) → (2,3,7) by morphing the associated tilings.\n}}\nTriangle groups arise in [[arithmetic geometry]].

      "text": "{{confused|Groupe Valentine}}\nIn mathematics, the '''Valentiner group''' is the perfect triple cover of the [[alternating group]] on 6 points, and is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of order 1080. It was found by {{harvs|txt|first=Herman|last=Valentiner|authorlink=Herman Valentiner|year=1889}} in the form of an action of ''A''<sub>6</sub> on the complex projective plane, and was studied further by {{harvtxt|Wiman|1896}}.\n\nAll perfect alternating groups have perfect double covers. In most cases this is the [[universal central extension]].  The two exceptions are ''A''<sub>6</sub> (whose perfect triple cover is the Valentiner group) and ''A''<sub>7</sub>, whose universal central extensions have centers of order 6.\n\n==Representations==\n\n*The alternating group ''A''<sub>6</sub> acts on the complex projective plane, and {{harvtxt|Gerbaldi|1898}} showed that the group acts on the 6 conics of [[Gerbaldi's theorem]]. This gives a homomorphism to PGL<sub>3</sub>('''C'''), and the lift of this to the triple cover GL<sub>3</sub>('''C''') is the Valentiner group. This embedding can be defined over the field generated by the 15th roots of unity.\n*The product of the Valentiner group with a group of order 2  is a 3-dimensional [[complex reflection group]] of order 2160 generated by 45 complex reflections of order 2. The invariants form a [[polynomial algebra]] with generators of degrees 6, 12, and 30.\n*The Valentiner group has  complex  irreducible faithful [[group representation]]s of dimension 3, 3, 3, 3, 6, 6, 9, 9, 15, 15.\n*The Valentiner group can be represented as the monomial symmetries of the [[hexacode]], the 3-dimensional subspace of '''F'''{{su|b=4|p=6}} spanned by (001111), (111100), and (0101ω{{overline|ω}}), where the elements of the finite field '''F'''<sub>4</sub> are 0, 1, ω, {{overline|ω}}.\n*The  group PGL<sub>3</sub>('''F'''<sub>4</sub>) acts on  the 2-dimensional projective plane over '''F'''<sub>4</sub> and acts transitively on its [[hyperoval]]s (sets of 6 points such that no three are on a line). The subgroup fixing a hyperoval is a copy of the alternating group '''A'''<sub>6</sub>.

Such groups are [[elementary equivalence|elementarily equivalent]] to the integers <math>(\\mathbb Z,+,<)</math>. Z-groups are an alternative presentation of [[Presburger arithmetic]].\n* occasionally, '''(Z)-group''' is used to mean a [[Zassenhaus group]], a special type of [[permutation group]].\n\n==Groups whose Sylow subgroups are cyclic==\n:''Usage: {{harv|Suzuki|1955}}, {{harv|Bender|Glauberman|1994|p=2}}, {{MR|0409648}}, {{harv|Wonenburger|1976}}, {{harv|Çelik|1976}}''\n\nIn the study of [[finite group]]s, a '''Z-group''' is a finite group whose [[Sylow subgroup]]s are all [[cyclic group|cyclic]].  The Z originates both from the German [[:de:Zyklische Gruppe|''Zyklische'']] and from their classification in {{harv|Zassenhaus|1935}}.  In many standard textbooks<!-- burnside, huppert, gorenstein, robinson --> these groups have no special name, other than '''metacyclic groups''', but that term is often<!-- huppert, gorenstein, robinson --> used more generally today.  See [[metacyclic group]] for more on the general, modern definition which includes non-cyclic [[p-group|''p''-groups]]; see {{harv|Hall, Jr.|1959|loc=Th. 9.4.3}} for the stricter, classical definition more closely related to Z-groups.\n\nEvery group whose Sylow subgroups are cyclic is itself [[metacyclic group|metacyclic]], so [[supersolvable group|supersolvable]].  In fact, such a group has a cyclic [[derived subgroup]] with cyclic maximal abelian quotient.  Such a group has the presentation {{harv|Hall, Jr.|1959|loc=Th. 9.4.3}}:\n:<math>G(m,n,r) = \\langle a,b | a^m = b^n = 1, bab^{-1} = a^r \\rangle </math>, where ''mn'' is the order of ''G''(''m'',''n'',''r''), the [[greatest common divisor]], gcd((''r''-1)''n'', ''m'') = 1, and ''r''<sup>''n''</sup> ≡ 1 (mod ''m'').\n\nThe [[character theory]] of Z-groups is well understood {{harv|Çelik|1976}}, as they are [[monomial group]]s.\n\nThe derived length of a Z-group is at most 2, so Z-groups may be insufficient for some uses.  A generalization due to Hall are the [[A-group]]s, those groups with [[abelian group|abelian]] Sylow subgroups.  These groups behave similarly to Z-groups, but can have arbitrarily large derived length {{harv|Hall|1940}}.  Another generalization due to {{harv|Suzuki|1955}} allows the Sylow 2-subgroup more flexibility, including [[dihedral group|dihedral]] and [[generalized quaternion group]]s.\n\n==Group with a generalized central series==\n:''Usage: {{harv|Robinson|1996}}, {{harv|Kurosh|1960}}''\n\nThe definition of [[central series]] used for '''Z-group''' is somewhat technical.  A '''series''' of ''G'' is a collection ''S'' of subgroups of ''G'', linearly ordered by inclusion, such that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the subgroups ''A''<sub>''g''</sub> = ∩ { ''N'' in ''S'' : ''g'' in ''N'' } and ''B''<sub>''g''</sub> = ∪ { ''N'' in ''S'' : ''g'' not in ''N'' } are both in ''S''.  A (generalized) '''central series''' of ''G'' is a series such that every ''N'' in ''S'' is normal in ''G'' and such that for every ''g'' in ''G'', the quotient ''A''<sub>''g''</sub>/''B''<sub>''g''</sub> is contained in the center of ''G''/''B''<sub>''g''</sub>.  A '''Z'''-group is a group with such a (generalized) central series.  Examples include the [[hypercentral group]]s whose transfinite [[upper central series]] form such a central series, as well as the [[hypocentral group]]s whose transfinite lower central series form such a central series {{harv|Robinson|1996}}.\n\n==Special 2-transitive groups==\n{{main|Zassenhaus group}}\n:''Usage: {{harv|Suzuki|1961}}''\n\nA '''(Z)-group''' is a group faithfully represented as a [[doubly transitive permutation group]] in which no non-identity element fixes more than two points.

These groups form one of the two series of discrete [[point groups in two dimensions]]. {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} consists of {{math|''n''}} [[rotation]]s of multiples of {{math|360°/''n''}} about the origin, and [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s across {{math|''n''}} lines through the origin, making angles of multiples of {{math|180°/''n''}} with each other. This is the [[symmetry group]] of a [[regular polygon]] with {{math|''n''}} sides (for {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}}; this extends to the cases {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}} where we have a plane with respectively a point offset from the \"center\" of the \"1-gon\" and a \"2-gon\" or line segment).\n\n{{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} is [[generating set of a group|generated]] by a rotation {{math|r}} of [[order (group theory)|order]] {{math|''n''}} and a reflection {{math|s}} of order 2 such that\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{srs} = \\mathrm{r}^{-1} \\, </math>\n\nIn geometric terms: in the mirror a rotation looks like an inverse rotation.\n\nIn terms of [[complex numbers]]: multiplication by <math>e^{2\\pi i \\over n}</math> and [[complex conjugation]].\n\nIn matrix form, by setting\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{r}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\\cos{2\\pi \\over n} & -\\sin{2\\pi \\over n} \\\\[8pt] \\sin{2\\pi \\over n} & \\cos{2\\pi \\over n}\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\mathrm{s}_0 = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nand defining <math>\\mathrm{r}_j = \\mathrm{r}_1^j</math> and <math>\\mathrm{s}_j = \\mathrm{r}_j \\, \\mathrm{s}_0</math> for <math>j \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n-1\\}</math> we can write the product rules for &nbsp;D<sub>''n''</sub> as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathrm{r}_j \\, \\mathrm{r}_k &= \\mathrm{r}_{(j+k) \\text{ mod }n} \\\\\n  \\mathrm{r}_j \\, \\mathrm{s}_k &= \\mathrm{s}_{(j+k) \\text{ mod }n} \\\\\n  \\mathrm{s}_j \\, \\mathrm{r}_k &= \\mathrm{s}_{(j-k) \\text{ mod }n} \\\\\n  \\mathrm{s}_j \\, \\mathrm{s}_k &= \\mathrm{r}_{(j-k) \\text{ mod }n}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(Compare [[coordinate rotations and reflections]].)\n\nThe dihedral group D<sub>2</sub> is generated by the rotation r of 180 degrees, and the reflection s across the ''x''-axis. The elements of D<sub>2</sub> can then be represented as {e,&nbsp;r,&nbsp;s,&nbsp;rs}, where e is the identity or null transformation and rs is the reflection across the ''y''-axis.\n\n[[File:Dihedral4.png|thumb|500px|The four elements of D<sub>2</sub> (x-axis is vertical here)]]\n\nD<sub>2</sub> is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[Klein four-group]].\n\nFor ''n'' > 2 the operations of rotation and reflection in general do not [[commutative|commute]] and D<sub>''n''</sub> is not [[abelian group|abelian]]; for example, in [[Dihedral group of order 8|D<sub>4</sub>]], a rotation of 90 degrees followed by a reflection yields a different result from a reflection followed by a rotation of 90 degrees.\n\n[[File:d8isNonAbelian.png|thumb|500px|D<sub>4</sub> is nonabelian (x-axis is vertical here).]]\n\nThus, beyond their obvious application to problems of [[symmetry]] in the plane, these groups are among the simplest examples of non-abelian groups, and as such arise frequently as easy counterexamples to theorems which are restricted to abelian groups.\n\nThe {{math|2''n''}} elements of {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} can be written as {{math|e}}, {{math|r}}, {{math|r{{sup|2}}}}, … , {{math|r{{sup|''n''−1}}}}, {{math|s}}, {{math|r s}}, {{math|r{{sup|2}}s}}, … ,  {{math|r{{sup|''n''−1}}s}}. The first {{math|''n''}} listed elements are rotations and the remaining {{math|''n''}} elements are axis-reflections (all of which have order&nbsp;2). The product of two rotations or two reflections is a rotation; the product of a rotation and a reflection is a reflection.\n\nSo far, we have considered {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} to be a [[subgroup]] of [[orthogonal group|{{math|O(2)}}]], i.e. the group of rotations (about the origin) and reflections (across axes through the origin) of the plane. However, notation {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} is also used for a subgroup of [[SO(3)]] which is also of abstract group type {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}}: the [[symmetry group|proper symmetry group]] of a ''regular polygon embedded in three-dimensional space'' (if ''n'' ≥ 3). Such a figure may be considered as a degenerate regular solid with its face counted twice. Therefore, it is also called a ''dihedron'' (Greek: solid with two faces), which explains the name ''dihedral group'' (in analogy to ''tetrahedral'', ''octahedral'' and ''icosahedral group'', referring to the proper symmetry groups of a regular [[tetrahedron]], [[octahedron]], and [[icosahedron]] respectively).\n\n===Examples of 2D dihedral symmetry===\n<gallery widths=\"180px\">\nFile:Red Star of David.svg|2D D<sub>6</sub> symmetry &ndash; [[Red Cross (symbol)#The Red Star of David (Magen David Adom)|The Red Star of David]]\nFile:Ashoka Chakra.svg|2D D<sub>24</sub> symmetry &ndash; [[Ashoka Chakra]], as depicted on the [[Flag of India|National flag of the Republic of India]].\n</gallery>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe properties of the dihedral groups {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} with {{math|''n'' ≥ 3}} depend on whether {{math|''n''}} is even or odd. For example, the [[center of a group|center]] of {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} consists only of the identity if ''n'' is odd, but if ''n'' is even the center has two elements, namely the identity and the element r<sup>''n''/2</sup> (with D<sub>''n''</sub> as a subgroup of O(2), this is [[Inversion (discrete mathematics)|inversion]]; since it is [[scalar multiplication]] by &minus;1, it is clear that it commutes with any linear transformation).\n\nIn the case of 2D isometries, this corresponds to adding inversion, giving rotations and mirrors in between the existing ones.\n\nFor ''n'' twice an odd number, the abstract group {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} is isomorphic with the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of {{math|D{{sub|''n'' / 2}}}} and {{math|Z{{sub|2}}}}.\nGenerally, if ''m'' [[divisor|divides]] ''n'', then {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} has ''n''/''m'' [[subgroup]]s of type {{math|D{{sub|''m''}}}}, and one subgroup ℤ<sub>''m''</sub>. Therefore, the total number of subgroups of {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} (''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1), is equal to ''d''(''n'')&nbsp;+&nbsp;σ(''n''), where ''d''(''n'') is the number of positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' and ''σ''(''n'') is the sum of the positive divisors of&nbsp;''n''.  See [[list of small groups]] for the cases&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;8.\n\nThe dihedral group of order 8 (D<sub>4</sub>) is the smallest example of a group that is not a [[T-group (mathematics)|T-group]]. Any of its two [[Klein four-group]] subgroups (which are normal in D<sub>4</sub>) has as normal subgroup order-2 subgroups generated by a reflection (flip) in D<sub>4</sub>, but these subgroups are not normal in D<sub>4</sub>.\n\n===Conjugacy classes of reflections===\nAll the reflections are [[conjugacy class|conjugate]] to each other in case ''n'' is odd, but they fall into two conjugacy classes if ''n'' is even. If we think of the isometries of a regular ''n''-gon: for odd ''n'' there are rotations in the group between every pair of mirrors, while for even ''n'' only half of the mirrors can be reached from one by these rotations. Geometrically, in an odd polygon every axis of symmetry passes through a vertex and a side, while in an even polygon there are two sets of axes, each corresponding to a conjugacy class: those that pass through two vertices and those that pass through two sides.\n\nAlgebraically, this is an instance of the conjugate [[Sylow theorem]] (for ''n'' odd): for ''n'' odd, each reflection, together with the identity, form a subgroup of order 2, which is a [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow 2-subgroup]] ({{nowrap|2 {{=}} 2{{sup|1}}}} is the maximum power of 2 dividing {{nowrap|2''n'' {{=}} 2[2''k'' + 1]}}), while for ''n'' even, these order 2 subgroups are not Sylow subgroups because 4 (a higher power of 2) divides the order of the group.\n\nFor ''n'' even there is instead an [[outer automorphism]] interchanging the two types of reflections (properly, a class of outer automorphisms, which are all conjugate by an inner automorphism).\n\n==Automorphism group==\nThe [[automorphism group]] of {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}} is isomorphic to the [[Holomorph (mathematics)|holomorph]] of ℤ/''n''ℤ, i.e., to {{nowrap|Hol(ℤ/''n''ℤ) {{=}} {''ax'' + ''b'' {{!}} (''a'', ''n'') {{=}} 1} }} and has order ''nϕ''(''n''), where ''ϕ'' is Euler's [[totient]] function, the number of ''k'' in {{nowrap|1, …, ''n'' &minus; 1}} coprime to ''n''.\n\nIt can be understood in terms of the generators of a reflection and an elementary rotation (rotation by ''k''(2''π''/''n''), for ''k'' [[coprime]] to ''n''); which automorphisms are inner and outer depends on the parity of ''n''.\n* For ''n'' odd, the dihedral group is centerless, so any element defines a non-trivial inner automorphism; for ''n'' even, the rotation by 180° (reflection through the origin) is the non-trivial element of the center.\n* Thus for ''n'' odd, the inner automorphism group has order 2''n'', and for ''n'' even (other than {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}) the inner automorphism group has order ''n''.\n* For ''n'' odd, all reflections are conjugate; for ''n'' even, they fall into two classes (those through two vertices and those through two faces), related by an outer automorphism, which can be represented by rotation by ''π''/''n'' (half the minimal rotation).\n* The rotations are a normal subgroup; conjugation by a reflection changes the sign (direction) of the rotation, but otherwise leaves them unchanged. Thus automorphisms that multiply angles by ''k'' (coprime to ''n'') are outer unless {{nowrap|''k'' {{=}} ±1}}.\n\n===Examples of automorphism groups===\n{{math|D{{sub|9}}}} has 18 [[inner automorphism]]s. As 2D isometry group D<sub>9</sub>, the group has mirrors at 20° intervals. The 18 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 20°, and reflections. As isometry group these are all automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these, 36 [[outer automorphism]]s; e.g., multiplying angles of rotation by 2.\n\n{{math|D{{sub|10}}}} has 10 inner automorphisms. As 2D isometry group D<sub>10</sub>, the group has mirrors at 18° intervals. The 10 inner automorphisms provide rotation of the mirrors by multiples of 36°, and reflections. As isometry group there are 10 more automorphisms; they are conjugates by isometries outside the group, rotating the mirrors 18° with respect to the inner automorphisms. As abstract group there are in addition to these 10 inner and 10 outer automorphisms, 20 more outer automorphisms; e.g., multiplying rotations by 3.\n\nCompare the values 6 and 4 for [[Euler's totient function]], the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n | multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']] for ''n'' = 9 and 10, respectively. This triples and doubles the number of automorphisms compared with the two automorphisms as isometries (keeping the order of the rotations the same or reversing the order).\n\nThe only values of ''n'' for which ''φ''(''n'') = 2 are 3, 4, and 6, and consequently, there are only three dihedral groups that are isomorphic to their own automorphism groups, namely {{math|D{{sub|3}}}} (order 6), {{math|D{{sub|4}}}} (order 8), and {{math|D{{sub|6}}}} (order 12).<ref>{{cite book|title=A Course in Group Theory|first1=John F.|last1=Humphreys|year=1996|isbn=9780198534594|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2jBqvVb0Q-AC&pg=PA195}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~atparris/small_groups.html|title=Groups of small order|first1=John|last1=Pedersen|publisher=Dept of Mathematics, University of South Florida}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2013/REUPapers/Sommer-Simpson.pdf|title=Automorphism groups for semidirect products of cyclic groups|first1=Jasha|last1=Sommer-Simpson|format=pdf|page=13|quote='''Corollary 7.3.'''

It was named by [[Alfred Young]] in 1930. Groups of this type are identified by a parameter ''n'', the dimension of the hypercube.\n\nAs a [[Coxeter group]] it is of type B<sub>''n''</sub> = C<sub>''n''</sub>, and as a [[Weyl group]] it is associated to the [[orthogonal group]]s in odd dimensions.  As a [[wreath product]] it is <math>S_2 \\wr S_n</math> where <math>S_n</math> is the [[symmetric group]] of degree ''n''.  As a [[permutation group]], the group is the '''signed symmetric group''' of permutations&nbsp;''π'' either of the set { −''n'', −''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, ..., −1, 1, 2, ..., ''n'' } or of the set { −''n'', −''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, ..., ''n'' } such that ''π''(''i'') = −''π''(−''i'') for all&nbsp;''i''.  As a [[matrix group]], it can be described as the group of ''n''×''n'' [[orthogonal matrices]] whose entries are all [[integer]]s. The representation theory of the hyperoctahedral group was described by {{harv|Young|1930}} according to {{harv|Kerber|1971|p=2}}.\n\nIn three dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group is known as ''O''×''S''<sub>2</sub> where ''O''≅''S''<sub>4</sub> is the [[octahedral group]], and ''S''<sub>2</sub> is a symmetric group (equivalently, [[cyclic group]]) of order 2.  Geometric figures in three dimensions with this symmetry group are said to have [[octahedral symmetry]], named after the regular [[octahedron]], or 3-[[orthoplex]]. In 4-dimensions it is called a [[Point groups in four dimensions#Hexadecachoric symmetry|hexadecachoric symmetry]], after the regular [[16-cell]], or 4-[[orthoplex]]. In two dimensions, the hyperoctahedral group structure is the abstract [[dihedral group of order eight]], describing the symmetry of a [[square]], or 2-orthoplex.\n\n== By dimension ==\n\n[[File:Hyperoctahedral group 2; passive prefix.svg|thumb|The 8 permutations of the square, forming D<sub>4</sub>]]\n[[File:3-ary Boolean functions; cube permutations; 5.svg|thumb|8 of the 48 permutations of a cube, forming O<sub>h</sub>]]\nHyperoctahedral groups can be named as [[Coxeter group#Properties|B<sub>n</sub>]], a bracket notation, or as a Coxeter group graph:<!-- In the table of symmetry groups, all the entries in the column labeled \"Coxeter Notation\" have the error \"Script Error: No such module 'CDD' \".

Viewed as a wreath product, there are two natural maps from the hyperoctahedral group to the cyclic group of order 2: one map coming from \"multiply the signs of all the elements\" (in the ''n'' copies of <math>\\{\\pm 1\\}</math>), and one map coming from the parity of the permutation. Multiplying these together yields a third map <math>C_n \\to \\{\\pm 1\\}</math>. The kernel of the first map is the Coxeter group <math>D_n.</math> In terms of [[signed permutations]], thought of as matrices, this third map is simply the determinant, while the first two correspond to \"multiplying the non-zero entries\" and \"parity of the underlying (unsigned) permutation\", which are not generally meaningful for matrices, but are in the case due to the coincidence with a wreath product.\n\nThe kernels of these three maps are all three index two subgroups of the hyperoctahedral group, as discussed in [[#H1:_abelianization|''H''<sub>1</sub>: Abelianization]] below, and their intersection is the [[derived subgroup]], of index 4 (quotient the Klein 4-group), which corresponds to the rotational symmetries of the demihypercube.\n\nIn the other direction, the center is the subgroup of scalar matrices, {±1}; geometrically, quotienting out by this corresponds to passing to the [[projective orthogonal group]].\n\nIn dimension 2 these groups completely describe the hyperoctahedral group, which is the [[Dihedral group of order 8|dihedral group Dih<sub>4</sub> of order 8]], and is an extension 2.V (of the 4-group by a cyclic group of order 2). In general, passing to the subquotient (derived subgroup, mod center) is the symmetry group of the projective demihypercube.\n[[File:Sphere symmetry group td.png|thumb|[[Tetrahedral symmetry]] in three dimensions, order 24]]\nThe '''hyperoctahedral''' subgroup, D<sub>n</sub> by dimension:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!n\n!Symmetry<BR>group\n!D<sub>n</sub>\n!colspan=2|[[Coxeter notation]]\n![[Symmetry order|Order]]\n!Mirrors\n!Related polytopes\n|- align=center\n!2\n|[[Dihedral symmetry|D<sub>2</sub>]] (*2&bull;)\n|D<sub>2</sub>||[2] = [ ]×[ ]||{{CDD|nodes}}||4||2\n|[[Rectangle]]\n|- align=center\n!3\n|[[Tetrahedral symmetry|T<sub>d</sub>]] ([[Orbifold notation|*332]])\n|D<sub>3</sub>||[3,3]||{{CDD|node|split1|nodes}}||24||6\n|[[tetrahedron]]\n|- align=center\n!4\n|±<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>[Tx{{Overline|T}}].2 <ref>Conway, 2003</ref><BR>(T/V;T/V)<sub>−</sub><sup>*</sup> <ref>Du Val, 1964, #42</ref>\n|D<sub>4</sub>||[3<sup>1,1,1</sup>]||{{CDD|node|3|node|split1|nodes}}||192||12\n|[[16-cell]]\n|- align=center\n!5\n|&nbsp;\n|D<sub>5</sub>||[3<sup>2,1,1</sup>]||{{CDD|node|3|node|3|node|split1|nodes}}||1920||20\n|[[5-demicube]]\n|- align=center\n!6\n|&nbsp;\n|D<sub>6</sub>||[3<sup>3,1,1</sup>]||{{CDD|node|3|node|3|node|3|node|split1|nodes}}||23040||30\n|[[6-demicube]]\n|- align=center\n!...n\n|&nbsp;\n|D<sub>n</sub>||[3<sup>n-3,1,1</sup>]||{{CDD|node|3|node}}...{{CDD|3|node|split1|nodes}}||2<sup>n-1</sup>n!||n(n-1)\n|[[demihypercube]]\n|}\n[[File:Sphere symmetry group th.png|thumb|[[Pyritohedral symmetry]] in three dimensions, order 24]]\n\n[[File:Sphere symmetry group o.png|thumb|[[Octahedral symmetry]] in three dimensions, order 24]]\n\nThe '''chiral hyper-octahedral symmetry''', is the direct subgroup, index 2 of hyper-octahedral symmetry.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!n\n!Symmetry<BR>group\n!colspan=2|[[Coxeter notation]]\n![[Symmetry order|Order]]\n|- align=center\n!2\n|[[Cyclic symmetry|C<sub>4</sub>]] (4&bull;)\n||[4]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2}}||4\n|- align=center\n!3\n|[[Octahedral symmetry|O]] ([[Orbifold notation|432]])\n||[4,3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} ||24\n|- align=center\n!4\n|<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub>[O×O].2 <ref>Conway, 2003</ref><BR>(O/V;O/V) <ref>Du Val, 1964, #27</ref>\n||[4,3,3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}} ||192\n|- align=center\n!5\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,3,3,3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||1920\n|- align=center\n!6\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,3,3,3,3]<sup>+</sup>||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||23040\n|- align=center\n!...n\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,(3<sup>n-2</sup>)<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node_h2|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}...{{CDD|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||2<sup>n-1</sup>n!\n|}\n\nAnother notable index 2 subgroup can be called '''hyper-pyritohedral symmetry''', by dimension:<ref>Coxeter (1999), p.121, Essay 5 ''Regular skew polyhedra''</ref> These groups have ''n'' orthogonal mirrors in ''n''-dimensions.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!n\n!Symmetry<BR>group\n!colspan=2|[[Coxeter notation]]\n![[Symmetry order|Order]]\n!Mirrors\n!Related polytopes\n|- align=center\n!2\n|[[Dihedral symmetry|D<sub>2</sub>]] (*2&bull;)\n||[4,1<sup>+</sup>]=[2]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2}}||4||2\n|[[Rectangle]]\n|- align=center\n!3\n|[[Pyritohedral symmetry|T<sub>h</sub>]] ([[Orbifold notation|3*2]])\n||[4,3<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}} ||24||3\n|[[Icosahedron#Uniform colorings and subsymmetries|snub octahedron]]\n|- align=center\n!4\n|±<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>[T×T].2 <ref>Conway, 2003</ref><BR>(T/V;T/V)<sup>*</sup> <ref>Du Val, 1964, #41</ref>\n||[4,(3,3)<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}} ||192||4\n|[[snub 24-cell]]\n|- align=center\n!5\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,(3,3,3)<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||1920||5\n|\n|- align=center\n!6\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,(3,3,3,3)<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||23040||6\n|\n|- align=center\n!...n\n|&nbsp;\n||[4,(3<sup>n-2</sup>)<sup>+</sup>]||{{CDD|node|4|node_h2|3|node_h2}}...{{CDD|3|node_h2|3|node_h2}}||2<sup>n-1</sup>n!||n\n|\n|}\n\n==Homology==\nThe [[group homology]] of the hyperoctahedral group is similar to that of the symmetric group, and exhibits stabilization, in the sense of [[stable homotopy theory]].\n\n===H<sub>1</sub>: abelianization===\nThe first homology group, which agrees with the [[abelianization]], stabilizes at the [[Klein four-group]], and is given by:\n:<math>H_1(C_n, \\mathbf{Z}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & n = 0\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}/2 & n = 1\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}/2 \\times \\mathbf{Z}/2 & n \\geq 2 \\end{cases}.</math>\nThis is easily seen directly: the <math>-1</math> elements are order 2 (which is non-empty for <math>n\\geq 1</math>), and all conjugate, as are the transpositions in <math>S_n</math> (which is non-empty for <math>n\\geq 2</math>), and these are two separate classes.

In particular, the finite symmetric group '''S<sub>''n''</sub>''' defined over a [[finite set]] of ''n'' symbols consists of the [[permutation]] operations that can be performed on the ''n'' symbols.<ref name=Jacobson-def>Jacobson (2009), p. 31.</ref> Since there are ''n''! (''n'' [[factorial]]) possible permutation operations that can be performed on a [[tuple]] composed of ''n'' symbols, it follows that the number of elements (the [[Order (group theory)|order]]) of the symmetric group S<sub>''n''</sub> is ''n''!.\n\nAlthough symmetric groups can be defined on infinite sets, this article focuses on the finite symmetric groups: their applications, their elements, their [[conjugacy class]]es, a [[finitely presented group|finite presentation]], their [[subgroup]]s, their automorphism groups, and their [[group representation |representation]] theory. For the remainder of this article, \"symmetric group\" will mean a symmetric group on a finite set.\n\nThe symmetric group is important to diverse areas of mathematics such as [[Galois theory]], [[invariant theory]], the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], and [[combinatorics]]. [[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to a [[subgroup]] of the symmetric group on ''G''.\n\n== Definition and first properties ==\nThe symmetric group on a finite set ''X'' is the group whose elements are all bijective functions from ''X'' to ''X'' and whose group operation is that of [[function composition]].<ref name=Jacobson-def /> For finite sets, \"permutations\" and \"bijective functions\" refer to the same operation, namely rearrangement. The symmetric group of '''degree''' ''n'' is the symmetric group on the set {{nowrap|1=''X'' = { 1, 2, ..., ''n'' }.}}\n\nThe symmetric group on a set ''X'' is denoted in various ways including S<sub>''X''</sub>, 𝔖<sub>''X''</sub>, Σ<sub>''X''</sub>, ''X''! and Sym(''X'').<ref name=Jacobson-def />  If ''X'' is the set {{nowrap|{ 1, 2, ..., ''n'' },}} then the symmetric group on ''X'' is also denoted S<sub>''n''</sub>,<ref name=Jacobson-def /> 𝔖<sub>''n''</sub>, Σ<sub>''n''</sub>, and Sym(''n'').\n\nSymmetric groups on infinite sets behave quite differently from symmetric groups on finite sets, and are discussed in {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11}}, {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8}}, and {{harv|Cameron|1999}}.\n\nThe symmetric group on a set of ''n'' elements has [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n''! (the [[factorial]] of ''n'').<ref>Jacobson (2009), p. 32. Theorem 1.1.</ref> It is [[abelian group|abelian]] if and only if ''n'' is less than or equal to 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=Symmetric Group is not Abelian/Proof 1|url=https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Symmetric_Group_is_not_Abelian/Proof_1}}</ref> For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}} (the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]]), the symmetric group is [[trivial group|trivial]] (it has order {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}). The group S<sub>''n''</sub> is [[solvable group|solvable]] if and only if {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 4}}. This is an essential part of the proof of the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] that shows that for every {{nowrap|''n'' > 4}} there are [[polynomial]]s of degree ''n'' which are not solvable by radicals, that is, the solutions cannot be expressed by performing a finite number of operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and root extraction on the polynomial's coefficients.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe symmetric group on a set of size ''n'' is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[polynomial]] of degree ''n'' and plays an important role in [[Galois theory]].  In [[invariant theory]], the symmetric group acts on the variables of a multi-variate function, and the functions left invariant are the so-called [[symmetric function]]s.  In the [[representation theory of Lie groups]], the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] plays a fundamental role through the ideas of [[Schur functor]]s.  In the theory of [[Coxeter group]]s, the symmetric group is the Coxeter group of type A<sub>''n''</sub> and occurs as the [[Weyl group]] of the [[general linear group]].  In [[combinatorics]], the symmetric groups, their elements ([[permutation]]s), and their [[group representation|representations]] provide a rich source of problems involving [[Young tableaux]], [[plactic monoid]]s, and the [[Bruhat order]].  [[Subgroup]]s of symmetric groups are called [[permutation group]]s and are widely studied because of their importance in understanding [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s, [[homogeneous space]]s, and [[automorphism group]]s of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, such as the [[Higman–Sims group]] and the [[Higman–Sims graph]].\n\n== Elements ==\nThe elements of the symmetric group on a set ''X'' are the [[permutation]]s of ''X''.\n\n=== Multiplication ===\nThe group operation in a symmetric group is [[function composition]], denoted by the symbol ∘ or simply by juxtaposition of the permutations. The composition {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g''}} of permutations ''f'' and ''g'', pronounced \"''f'' of ''g''\", maps any element ''x'' of ''X'' to ''f''(''g''(''x'')). Concretely, let (see [[permutation]] for an explanation of notation):\n\n: <math> f = (1\\ 3)(4\\ 5)=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 3 & 2 & 1 & 5 & 4\\end{pmatrix} </math>\n: <math> g = (1\\ 2\\ 5)(3\\ 4)=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 4 & 3 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nApplying ''f'' after ''g'' maps 1 first to 2 and then 2 to itself; 2 to 5 and then to 4; 3 to 4 and then to 5, and so on. So composing ''f'' and ''g'' gives\n: <math> fg = f\\circ g = (1\\ 2\\ 4)(3\\ 5)=\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 &3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 2 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 3\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nA [[Cyclic permutation|cycle]] of length {{nowrap|1=''L'' = ''k'' · ''m''}}, taken to the ''k''-th power, will decompose into ''k'' cycles of length ''m'': For example, ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 2}}, {{nowrap|1=''m'' = 3}}),\n: <math> (1~2~3~4~5~6)^2 = (1~3~5) (2~4~6).</math>\n\n=== Verification of group axioms ===\nTo check that the symmetric group on a set ''X'' is indeed a [[group (mathematics)|group]], it is necessary to verify the group axioms of closure, associativity, identity, and inverses.<ref>{{Citation | title=Modern Algebra | first1=A. R. | last1=Vasishtha | first2=A. K. | last2=Vasishtha | publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media}}</ref>\n# The operation of [[function composition]] is closed in the set of permutations of the given set ''X''.\n# [[Function composition]] is always associative.\n# The trivial bijection that assigns each element of ''X'' to itself serves as an identity for the group.\n# Every bijection has an [[inverse function]] that undoes its action, and thus each element of a symmetric group does have an inverse which is a permutation too.\n\n=== Transpositions ===\n{{main article|Transposition (mathematics)}}\nA '''transposition''' is a permutation which exchanges two elements and keeps all others fixed; for example (1 3) is a transposition. Every permutation can be written as a product of transpositions; for instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can be written as ''g'' = (1 2)(2 5)(3 4). Since ''g'' can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions, it is then called an [[Even and odd permutations|odd permutation]], whereas ''f'' is an even permutation.\n\nThe representation of a permutation as a product of transpositions is not unique; however, the number of transpositions needed to represent a given permutation is either always even or always odd. There are several short proofs of the invariance of this parity of a permutation.\n\nThe product of two even permutations is even, the product of two odd permutations is even, and all other products are odd.  Thus we can define the '''sign''' of a permutation:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{sgn}f = \\begin{cases} +1, & \\text{if }f\\mbox { is even} \\\\ -1, & \\text{if }f \\text{ is odd}. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nWith this definition,\n:<math>\\operatorname{sgn}\\colon \\mathrm{S}_n \\rightarrow \\{+1, -1\\}\\ </math>\nis a [[group homomorphism]] ({+1, –1} is a group under multiplication, where +1 is e, the [[neutral element]]). The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this homomorphism, that is, the set of all even permutations, is called the '''[[alternating group]]''' A<sub>''n''</sub>. It is a [[normal subgroup]] of S<sub>''n''</sub>, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} it has {{nowrap|''n''!/2}} elements. The group S<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[semidirect product]] of A<sub>''n''</sub> and any subgroup generated by a single transposition.\n\nFurthermore, every permutation can be written as a product of ''[[adjacent transposition]]s'', that is, transpositions of the form {{nowrap|(''a'' ''a''+1)}}.  For instance, the permutation ''g'' from above can also be written as {{nowrap|1=''g'' = (4 5)(3 4)(4 5)(1 2)(2 3)(3 4)(4 5)}}. The sorting algorithm [[bubble sort]] is an application of this fact.  The representation of a permutation as a product of adjacent transpositions is also not unique.\n\n=== Cycles ===\nA [[cyclic permutation|cycle]] of ''length'' ''k'' is a permutation ''f'' for which there exists an element ''x'' in {1,...,''n''} such that ''x'', ''f''(''x''), ''f''<sup>2</sup>(''x''), ..., ''f''<sup>''k''</sup>(''x'') = ''x'' are the only elements moved by ''f''; it is required that {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ 2}} since with {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 1}} the element ''x'' itself would not be moved either. The permutation ''h'' defined by\n\n:<math>h = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 4 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 5\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nis a cycle of length three, since {{nowrap|1=''h''(1) = 4}}, {{nowrap|1=''h''(4) = 3}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''(3) = 1}}, leaving 2 and 5 untouched. We denote such a cycle by {{nowrap|(1 4 3)}}, but it could equally well be written {{nowrap|(4 3 1)}} or {{nowrap|(3 1 4)}} by starting at a different point. The order of a cycle is equal to its length. Cycles of length two are transpositions. Two cycles are ''disjoint'' if they move disjoint subsets of elements. Disjoint cycles [[Commutative property|commute]]: for example, in S<sub>6</sub> there is the equality {{nowrap|1=(4 1 3)(2 5 6) = (2 5 6)(4 1 3)}}. Every element of S<sub>''n''</sub> can be written as a product of disjoint cycles; this representation is unique [[up to]] the order of the factors, and the freedom present in representing each individual cycle by choosing its starting point.\n\nCycles admit the following conjugation property with any permutation <math>\\sigma</math>, this property is often used to obtain its [[Symmetric group#Generators and relations|generators and relations]].\n\n:<math>\\sigma\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c & \\ldots \\end{pmatrix}\\sigma^{-1}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\sigma(a) & \\sigma(b) & \\sigma(c) & \\ldots\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n=== Special elements ===\nCertain elements of the symmetric group of {1, 2, ..., ''n''} are of particular interest (these can be generalized to the symmetric group of any finite totally ordered set, but not to that of an unordered set).\n\nThe '''{{visible anchor|order reversing permutation}}''' is the one given by:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & \\cdots & n\\\\\nn & n-1 & \\cdots & 1\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThis is the unique maximal element with respect to the [[Bruhat order]] and the\n[[longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element]] in the symmetric group with respect to generating set consisting of the adjacent transpositions {{nowrap|(''i'' ''i''+1)}}, {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n'' − 1}}.\n\nThis is an involution, and consists of <math>\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor</math> (non-adjacent) transpositions\n:<math>(1\\,n)(2\\,n-1)\\cdots,\\text{ or }\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\\text{ adjacent transpositions: }</math>\n:: <math>(n\\,n-1)(n-1\\,n-2)\\cdots(2\\,1)(n-1\\,n-2)(n-2\\,n-3)\\cdots,</math>\n\nso it thus has sign:\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{sgn}(\\rho_n) = (-1)^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor} =(-1)^{n(n-1)/2} = \\begin{cases}\n+1 & n \\equiv 0,1 \\pmod{4}\\\\\n-1 & n \\equiv 2,3 \\pmod{4}\n\\end{cases}</math>\nwhich is 4-periodic in ''n''.\n\nIn S<sub>2''n''</sub>, the ''[[Faro shuffle|perfect shuffle]]'' is the permutation that splits the set into 2 piles and interleaves them. Its sign is also <math>(-1)^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}.</math>\n\nNote that the reverse on ''n'' elements and perfect shuffle on 2''n'' elements have the same sign; these are important to the classification of [[Clifford algebra]]s, which are 8-periodic.\n\n== Conjugacy classes ==\nThe [[conjugacy class]]es of S<sub>''n''</sub> correspond to the cycle structures of permutations; that is, two elements of S<sub>''n''</sub> are conjugate in S<sub>''n''</sub> if and only if they consist of the same number of disjoint cycles of the same lengths. For instance, in S<sub>5</sub>, (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) are conjugate; (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 2)(4 5) are not. A conjugating element of S<sub>''n''</sub> can be constructed in \"two line notation\" by placing the \"cycle notations\" of the two conjugate permutations on top of one another.  Continuing the previous example:\n\n:<math>k = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\ 1 & 4 & 3 & 2 & 5\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhich can be written as the product of cycles, namely: (2 4).\n\nThis permutation then relates (1 2 3)(4 5) and (1 4 3)(2 5) via conjugation, that is,\n\n:<math>(2~4)\\circ(1~2~3)(4~5)\\circ(2~4)=(1~4~3)(2~5).</math>\n\nIt is clear that such a permutation is not unique.\n\n== Low degree groups ==\n{{See also|Representation theory of the symmetric group#Special cases}}\nThe low-degree symmetric groups have simpler and exceptional structure, and often must be treated separately.\n\n;S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub>: The symmetric groups on the [[empty set]] and the [[singleton set]] are trivial, which corresponds to {{nowrap|1=0! = 1! = 1}}.  In this case the alternating group agrees with the symmetric group, rather than being an index 2 subgroup, and the sign map is trivial. In the case of S<sub>0</sub>, its only member is the [[empty function]].\n\n;S<sub>2</sub>: This group consists of exactly two elements: the identity and the permutation swapping the two points.  It is a [[cyclic group]] and is thus [[abelian group|abelian]].  In [[Galois theory]], this corresponds to the fact that the [[quadratic formula]] gives a direct solution to the general [[quadratic polynomial]] after extracting only a single root.  In [[invariant theory]], the representation theory of the symmetric group on two points is quite simple and is seen as writing a function of two variables as a sum of its symmetric and anti-symmetric parts: Setting {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>s</sub>(''x'', ''y'') = f(''x'', ''y'') + f(''y'', ''x'')}}, and {{nowrap|1=''f''<sub>a</sub>(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''(''x'', ''y'') − ''f''(''y'', ''x'')}}, one gets that {{nowrap|1=2⋅''f'' = ''f''<sub>s</sub> + ''f''<sub>a</sub>}}.  This process is known as [[symmetrization]].\n\n;S<sub>3</sub>: S<sub>3</sub> is the first nonabelian symmetric group.  This group is isomorphic to the [[dihedral group of order 6]], the group of reflection and rotation symmetries of an [[equilateral triangle]], since these symmetries permute the three vertices of the triangle. Cycles of length two correspond to reflections, and cycles of length three are rotations.  In Galois theory, the sign map from S<sub>3</sub> to S<sub>2</sub> corresponds to the resolving quadratic for a [[cubic polynomial]], as discovered by [[Gerolamo Cardano]], while the A<sub>3</sub> kernel corresponds to the use of the [[discrete Fourier transform]] of order 3 in the solution, in the form of [[Lagrange resolvent]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\n;S<sub>4</sub>: The group [[Wikiversity:Symmetric group S4|S<sub>4</sub>]] is isomorphic to the group of proper rotations about opposite faces, opposite diagonals and opposite edges, [[Rencontres numbers|9, 8 and 6]] permutations, of the [[cube]].<ref>Die Untergruppenverbände der Gruppen der ordnung weniger als 100, Habilitationsschrift, J. Neubuser, Universität Kiel, Germany, 1967.</ref> Beyond the group [[Alternating group|A<sub>4</sub>]], S<sub>4</sub> has a [[Klein four-group]] V as a proper [[normal subgroup]], namely the even transpositions {{nowrap|{(1), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)},}} with quotient S<sub>3</sub>. In [[Galois theory]], this map corresponds to the resolving cubic to a [[quartic polynomial]], which allows the quartic to be solved by radicals, as established by [[Lodovico Ferrari]]. The Klein group can be understood in terms of the [[Lagrange resolvent]]s of the quartic.  The map from S<sub>4</sub> to S<sub>3</sub> also yields a 2-dimensional irreducible representation, which is an irreducible representation of a symmetric group of degree ''n'' of dimension below {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, which only occurs for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}.\n\n;S<sub>5</sub>: S<sub>5</sub> is the first non-solvable symmetric group.  Along with the [[special linear group]] {{nowrap|SL(2, 5)}} and the [[icosahedral group]] {{nowrap|A<sub>5</sub> × S<sub>2</sub>}}, S<sub>5</sub> is one of the three non-solvable groups of order 120, up to isomorphism.  S<sub>5</sub> is the [[Galois group]] of the general [[quintic equation]], and the fact that S<sub>5</sub> is not a [[solvable group]] translates into the non-existence of a general formula to solve [[quintic polynomial]]s by radicals.  There is an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S<sub>5</sub> → S<sub>6</sub>}} as a [[#Transitive subgroup anchor|transitive subgroup]]; the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>''n''+1</sub>}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive. This yields the outer automorphism of S<sub>6</sub>, discussed below, and corresponds to the resolvent sextic of a quintic.\n\n;S<sub>6</sub>: Unlike all other symmetric groups, S<sub>6</sub>, has an [[outer automorphism]].  Using the language of [[Galois theory]], this can also be understood in terms of [[Lagrange resolvents]]. The resolvent of a quintic is of degree 6—this corresponds to an exotic inclusion map {{nowrap|S<sub>5</sub> → S<sub>6</sub>}} as a transitive subgroup (the obvious inclusion map {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>''n''+1</sub>}} fixes a point and thus is not transitive) and, while this map does not make the general quintic solvable, it yields the exotic outer automorphism of S<sub>6</sub>—see [[automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups]] for details.\n\n:Note that while A<sub>6</sub> and A<sub>7</sub> have an exceptional [[Schur multiplier]] (a [[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|triple cover]]) and that these extend to triple covers of S<sub>6</sub> and S<sub>7</sub>, these do not correspond to exceptional Schur multipliers of the symmetric group.\n\n=== Maps between symmetric groups ===\n\nOther than the trivial map {{nowrap|1=S<sub>''n''</sub> → C<sub>1</sub> ≅ S<sub>0</sub> ≅ S<sub>1</sub>}} and the sign map {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>2</sub>}}, the most notable homomorphisms between symmetric groups, in order of [[relative dimension]], are:\n* {{nowrap|S<sub>4</sub> → S<sub>3</sub>}} corresponding to the exceptional normal subgroup {{nowrap|V < A<sub>4</sub> < S<sub>4</sub>}};\n* {{nowrap|S<sub>6</sub> → S<sub>6</sub>}} (or rather, a class of such maps up to inner automorphism) corresponding to the outer automorphism of S<sub>6</sub>.\n* {{nowrap|S<sub>5</sub> → S<sub>6</sub>}} as a transitive subgroup, yielding the outer automorphism of S<sub>6</sub> as discussed above.\nThere are also a host of other homomorphisms {{nowrap|S<sub>''m''</sub> → S<sub>''n''</sub>}} where {{nowrap|''n'' > ''m''}}.\n\n== Properties ==\nSymmetric groups are [[Coxeter group]]s and [[reflection group]]s.  They can be realized as a group of reflections with respect to hyperplanes {{nowrap|1=''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''x''<sub>''j''</sub>, 1 ≤ ''i'' < ''j'' ≤ ''n''}}.  [[Braid group]]s B<sub>''n''</sub> admit symmetric groups S<sub>''n''</sub> as [[quotient group]]s.\n\n[[Cayley's theorem]] states that every group ''G'' is isomorphic to a subgroup of the symmetric group on the elements of ''G'', as a group acts on itself faithfully by (left or right) multiplication.\n\n== Relation with alternating group ==\nFor {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, the [[alternating group]] A<sub>''n''</sub> is [[Simple group|simple]], and the induced quotient is the sign map: {{nowrap|A<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>2</sub>}} which is split by taking a transposition of two elements. Thus S<sub>''n''</sub> is the semidirect product {{nowrap|A<sub>''n''</sub> ⋊ S<sub>2</sub>}}, and has no other proper normal subgroups, as they would intersect A<sub>''n''</sub> in either the identity (and thus themselves be the identity or a 2-element group, which is not normal), or in A<sub>''n''</sub> (and thus themselves be A<sub>''n''</sub> or S<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nS<sub>''n''</sub> acts on its subgroup A<sub>''n''</sub> by conjugation, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S<sub>''n''</sub> is the full automorphism group of A<sub>''n''</sub>: Aut(A<sub>''n''</sub>) ≅ S<sub>''n''</sub>. Conjugation by even elements are [[inner automorphism]]s of A<sub>''n''</sub> while the [[outer automorphism]] of A<sub>''n''</sub> of order 2 corresponds to conjugation by an odd element. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, there is an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of A<sub>''n''</sub> so S<sub>''n''</sub> is not the full automorphism group of A<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nConversely, for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 6}}, S<sub>''n''</sub> has no outer automorphisms, and for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2}} it has no center, so for {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}} it is a [[complete group]], as discussed in [[#Automorphism group|automorphism group]], below.\n\nFor {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}}, S<sub>''n''</sub> is an [[almost simple group]], as it lies between the simple group A<sub>''n''</sub> and its group of automorphisms.\n\nS<sub>''n''</sub> can be embedded into A<sub>''n''+2</sub> by appending the transposition {{nowrap|(''n'' + 1, ''n'' + 2)}} to all odd permutations, while embedding into A<sub>''n''+1</sub> is impossible for {{nowrap|''n'' > 1}}.\n\n== Generators and relations ==\nThe symmetric group on ''n''-letters, S<sub>''n''</sub>, may be described as follows. It has generators: <math>\\sigma_1, \\ldots, \\sigma_{n-1}</math> and relations:\n*<math>{\\sigma_i}^2 = 1,</math>\n*<math>\\sigma_i\\sigma_j = \\sigma_j\\sigma_i \\text{ if } j \\neq i\\pm 1,</math>\n*<math>(\\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+1})^3 =1.\\ </math>\n\nOne thinks of <math>\\sigma_i</math> as swapping the ''i''th and {{nowrap|(''i'' + 1)th}} position.\n\nOther popular generating sets include the set of transpositions that swap 1 and ''i'' for {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''n''}} and a set containing any ''n''-cycle and a 2-cycle of adjacent elements in the ''n''-cycle.\n\n== Subgroup structure ==\nA [[subgroup]] of a symmetric group is called a [[permutation group]].\n\n=== Normal subgroups ===\nThe [[normal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups are well understood. If {{nowrap|''n'' ≤ 2}}, S<sub>''n''</sub> has at most 2 elements, and so has no nontrivial proper subgroups. The [[alternating group]] of degree ''n'' is always a normal subgroup, a proper one for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}} and nontrivial for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}}; for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 3}} it is in fact the only non-identity proper normal subgroup of S<sub>''n''</sub>, except when {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}} where there is one additional such normal subgroup, which is isomorphic to the [[Klein four group]].\n\nThe symmetric group on an infinite set does not have an associated alternating group: not all elements can be written as a (finite) product of transpositions. However it does contain a normal subgroup ''S'' of permutations that fix all but finitely many elements, and such permutations can be classified as either even or odd. The even elements of ''S'' form the alternating subgroup ''A'' of ''S'', and since ''A'' is even a [[characteristic subgroup]] of ''S'', it is also a normal subgroup of the full symmetric group of the infinite set. The groups ''A'' and ''S'' are the only non-identity proper normal subgroups of the symmetric group on a countably infinite set. For more details see {{harv|Scott|1987|loc=Ch. 11.3}} or {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=Ch. 8.1}}.\n\n=== Maximal subgroups ===\n{{expand section|date=September 2009}}\n\nThe [[maximal subgroup]]s of the finite symmetric groups fall into three classes: the intransitive, the imprimitive, and the primitive.  The intransitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form {{nowrap|Sym(''k'') × Sym(''n'' − ''k'')}} for {{nowrap|1 ≤ ''k'' < ''n''/2}}.  The imprimitive maximal subgroups are exactly those of the form Sym(''k'') wr Sym(''n''/''k'') where {{nowrap|2 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''n''/2}} is a proper divisor of ''n'' and \"wr\" denotes the [[wreath product]] acting imprimitively.  The primitive maximal subgroups are more difficult to identify, but with the assistance of the [[O'Nan–Scott theorem]] and the [[classification of finite simple groups]], {{harv|Liebeck|Praeger|Saxl|1988}} gave a fairly satisfactory description of the maximal subgroups of this type<!-- though beware of typos in the low degrees--> according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=268}}.\n\n=== Sylow subgroups ===\nThe [[Sylow subgroup]]s of the symmetric groups are important examples of [[p-group|''p''-groups]].  They are more easily described in special cases first:\n\nThe Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p'' are just the cyclic subgroups generated by ''p''-cycles.  There are {{nowrap|1=(''p'' − 1)!/(''p'' − 1) = (''p'' − 2)!}} such subgroups simply by counting generators.  The [[normalizer]] therefore has order {{nowrap|''p''·(''p'' − 1)}} and is known as a [[Frobenius group]] {{nowrap|''F''<sub>''p''(''p''−1)</sub>}} (especially for {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 5}}), and is the [[affine general linear group]], {{nowrap|AGL(1, ''p'')}}.\n\nThe Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''<sup>2</sup> are the [[wreath product]] of two cyclic groups of order ''p''.  For instance, when {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 3}}, a Sylow 3-subgroup of Sym(9) is generated by {{nowrap|1=''a'' = (1 4 7)(2 5 8)(3 6 9)}} and the elements ''x'' = (1 2 3), ''y'' = (4 5 6), ''z'' = (7 8 9)<!-- or just use (1,2,3) -->, and every element of the Sylow 3-subgroup has the form ''a''<sup>''i''</sup>''x''<sup>''j''</sup>''y''<sup>''k''</sup>''z''<sup>''l''</sup> for 0 ≤ ''i'',''j'',''k'',''l'' ≤ 2.\n\nThe Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> are sometimes denoted W<sub>''p''</sub>(''n''), and using this notation one has that {{nowrap|W<sub>''p''</sub>(''n'' + 1)}} is the wreath product of W<sub>''p''</sub>(''n'') and W<sub>''p''</sub>(1).\n\nIn general, the Sylow ''p''-subgroups of the symmetric group of degree ''n'' are a direct product of ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> copies of W<sub>''p''</sub>(''i''), where 0 ≤ ''a<sub>i</sub>'' ≤ ''p'' − 1 and ''n'' = ''a''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''·''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''p''<sup>k</sup>·''a''<sub>''k''</sub> (the base ''p'' expansion of ''n'').\n\nFor instance, W<sub>2</sub>(1) =&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub> and W<sub>2</sub>(2) =&nbsp;D<sub>8</sub>, the [[dihedral group of order 8]], and so a Sylow 2-subgroup of the symmetric group of degree 7 is generated by {{nowrap|{ (1,3)(2,4), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6) } }} and is isomorphic to {{nowrap|D<sub>8</sub> × C<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nThese calculations are attributed to {{harv|Kaloujnine|1948}} and described in more detail in {{harv|Rotman|1995|p=176}}.  Note however that {{harv|Kerber|1971|p=26}} attributes the result to an 1844 work of [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]], and mentions that it is even covered in textbook form in {{harv|Netto|1882|loc=§39–40}}.\n\n===<span id=\"Transitive subgroup anchor\"></span> Transitive subgroups ===<!-- Transitive subgroup redirects to this anchor-->\nA '''transitive subgroup''' of S<sub>''n''</sub> is a subgroup whose action on {1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;,...,&nbsp;''n''} is [[transitive action|transitive]]. For example, the Galois group of a ([[finite extension|finite]]) [[Galois extension]] is a transitive subgroup of S<sub>''n''</sub>, for some ''n''.\n\n== Automorphism group ==\n{{details|Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"  cellspacing=\"2\"\n|- style=\"background:#a0e0a0;\"\n| ''n''\n| Aut(S<sub>''n''</sub>)\n| Out(S<sub>''n''</sub>)\n| Z(S<sub>''n''</sub>)\n|-\n| ''n'' ≠ 2, 6\n| S<sub>''n''</sub>\n| C<sub>1</sub>\n| C<sub>1</sub>\n|-\n| ''n'' = 2\n| C<sub>1</sub>\n| C<sub>1</sub>\n| S<sub>2</sub>\n|-\n| ''n'' = 6\n| S<sub>6</sub> ⋊ C<sub>2</sub>\n| C<sub>2</sub>\n| C<sub>1</sub>\n|}\nFor {{nowrap|''n'' ≠ 2, 6}}, S<sub>''n''</sub> is a [[complete group]]: its [[center (group theory)|center]] and [[outer automorphism group]] are both trivial.\n\nFor {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the automorphism group is trivial, but S<sub>2</sub> is not trivial: it is isomorphic to C<sub>2</sub>, which is abelian, and hence the center is the whole group.\n\nFor {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, it has an outer automorphism of order 2: {{nowrap|1=Out(S<sub>6</sub>) = C<sub>2</sub>}}, and the automorphism group is a semidirect product {{nowrap|1=Aut(S<sub>6</sub>) = S<sub>6</sub> ⋊ C<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nIn fact, for any set ''X'' of cardinality other than 6, every automorphism of the symmetric group on ''X'' is inner, a result first due to {{harv|Schreier|Ulam|1937}} according to {{harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|p=259}}.\n\n== Homology ==\n{{see also|Alternating group#Group homology}}\nThe [[group homology]] of S<sub>''n''</sub> is quite regular and stabilizes: the first homology (concretely, the [[abelianization]]) is:\n\n:<math>H_1(\\mathrm{S}_n,\\mathbf{Z}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & n < 2\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}/2 & n \\geq 2.\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe first homology group is the abelianization, and corresponds to the sign map S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>2</sub> which is the abelianization for ''n'' ≥ 2; for ''n'' < 2 the symmetric group is trivial. This homology is easily computed as follows: S<sub>''n''</sub> is generated by involutions (2-cycles, which have order 2), so the only non-trivial maps {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → C<sub>''p''</sub>}} are to S<sub>2</sub> and all involutions are conjugate, hence map to the same element in the abelianization (since conjugation is trivial in abelian groups). Thus the only possible maps {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>2</sub> ≅ {±1} }} send an involution to 1 (the trivial map) or to −1 (the sign map). One must also show that the sign map is well-defined, but assuming that, this gives the first homology of S<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThe second homology (concretely, the [[Schur multiplier]]) is:\n:<math>H_2(\\mathrm{S}_n,\\mathbf{Z}) = \\begin{cases} 0 & n < 4\\\\\n\\mathbf{Z}/2 & n \\geq 4.\\end{cases}</math>\nThis was computed in {{Harv|Schur|1911}}, and corresponds to the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the symmetric group]], 2 · S<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nNote that the [[exceptional object|exceptional]] low-dimensional homology of the alternating group (<math>H_1(\\mathrm{A}_3)\\cong H_1(\\mathrm{A}_4) \\cong \\mathrm{C}_3,</math> corresponding to non-trivial abelianization, and <math>H_2(\\mathrm{A}_6)\\cong H_2(\\mathrm{A}_7) \\cong \\mathrm{C}_6,</math> due to the exceptional 3-fold cover) does not change the homology of the symmetric group; the alternating group phenomena do yield symmetric group phenomena – the map <math>\\mathrm{A}_4 \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{C}_3</math> extends to <math>\\mathrm{S}_4 \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{S}_3,</math> and the triple covers of A<sub>6</sub> and A<sub>7</sub> extend to triple covers of S<sub>6</sub> and S<sub>7</sub> – but these are not ''homological'' – the map <math>\\mathrm{S}_4 \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathrm{S}_3</math> does not change the abelianization of S<sub>4</sub>, and the triple covers do not correspond to homology either.\n\nThe homology \"stabilizes\" in the sense of [[stable homotopy]] theory: there is an inclusion map {{nowrap|S<sub>''n''</sub> → S<sub>''n''+1</sub>}}, and for fixed ''k'', the induced map on homology {{nowrap|''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(S<sub>''n''</sub>) → ''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(S<sub>''n''+1</sub>)}} is an isomorphism for sufficiently high ''n''. This is analogous to the homology of families [[Lie groups]] stabilizing.\n\nThe homology of the infinite symmetric group is computed in {{Harv|Nakaoka|1961}}, with the cohomology algebra forming a [[Hopf algebra]].\n\n== Representation theory ==\n{{main article|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}\n\nThe [[representation theory of the symmetric group]] is a particular case of the [[representation theory of finite groups]], for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from [[symmetric function]] theory to problems of [[quantum mechanics]] for a number of [[identical particles]].\n\nThe symmetric group S<sub>''n''</sub> has order ''n''<nowiki>!</nowiki>. Its [[conjugacy class]]es are labeled by [[integer partition|partition]]s of&nbsp;''n''. Therefore, according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent [[irreducible representation]]s, over the [[complex number]]s, is equal to the number of partitions of&nbsp;''n''. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representation by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of ''n'' or equivalently [[Young diagram]]s of size&nbsp;''n''.\n\nEach such irreducible representation can be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the [[Young symmetrizer]]s acting on a space generated by the [[Young tableau]]x of shape given by the Young diagram.\n\nOver other [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field ''K'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] equal to zero or greater than ''n'' then by [[Maschke's theorem]] the [[group algebra]] ''K''S<sub>''n''</sub> is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\n\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called ''[[Specht modules]]'', and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s are not known in general.\n\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of group theory]]\n* [[Symmetric inverse semigroup]]\n* [[Signed symmetric group]]\n* [[Generalized symmetric group]]\n* [[Symmetric power]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Cameron | first1=Peter J. | title=Permutation Groups | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts | isbn=978-0-521-65378-7 | year=1999 | volume=45}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Dixon | first1=John D. | last2=Mortimer | first2=Brian | title=Permutation groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94599-6 | mr=1409812 | year=1996 | volume=163}}\n* {{Citation| last=Jacobson| first=Nathan| author-link=Nathan Jacobson| year=2009| title=Basic algebra| edition=2nd| volume = 1 | publisher=Dover| isbn = 978-0-486-47189-1}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Kaloujnine | first1=Léo | title=La structure des p-groupes de Sylow des groupes symétriques finis | url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=ASENS_1948_3_65__239_0 | mr=0028834 | year=1948 | journal=Annales Scientifiques de l'École Normale Supérieure |series=Série 3 | issn=0012-9593 | volume=65 | pages=239–276}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Kerber | first1=Adalbert | title=Representations of permutation groups.

      "text": "The representation theory of [[group (mathematics)|groups]] is a part of mathematics which examines how groups act on given structures.\n\nHere the focus is in particular on [[Group action (mathematics)|operations of groups]] on [[vector space]]s. Nevertheless, groups acting on other groups or on [[set (mathematics)|sets]] are also considered. For more details, please refer to the section on [[#Permutation representation|permutation representations]].\n\nPlease note, that except for a few marked exceptions only finite groups will be considered in this article. We will also restrain to vector spaces over [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero. Because the theory of [[algebraically closed field]]s of characteristic zero is complete, a theory valid for a special algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is also valid for every other algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Thus, without loss of generality, we can study vector spaces over <math>\\Complex.</math>\n\nRepresentation theory is used in many parts of mathematics, as well as in quantum chemistry and physics. Among other things it is used in [[algebra]] to examine the structure of groups. There are also applications in [[harmonic analysis]] and [[number theory]]. For example, representation theory is used in the modern approach to gain new results about automorphic forms.\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Linear representations===\nLet <math>V</math> be a <math>K</math>–vector space and <math>G</math> a finite group. A '''linear representation''' of a finite group <math>G</math> is a [[group homomorphism]] <math>\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)=\\text{Aut}(V).</math> That means, a linear representation is a map <math>\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)</math> which satisfies <math>\\rho(st)=\\rho(s)\\rho(t)</math> for all <math>s,t \\in G.</math> The vector space <math>V</math> is called representation space of <math>G.</math> Often the term representation of <math>G</math> is also used for the representation space <math>V.</math>\n\nThe representation of a group in a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] instead of a vector space is also called a linear representation.\n\nWe write <math>(\\rho, V_\\rho)</math> for the representation <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}(V_\\rho)</math> of <math>G.</math> Sometimes we only use <math>(\\rho, V),</math> if it is clear to which representation the space <math>V</math> belongs.\n\nIn this article we will restrain ourselves to the study of finite-dimensional representation spaces, except for the last chapter. As in most cases only a finite number of vectors in <math>V</math> is of interest, it is sufficient to study the [[#Properties|subrepresentation]] generated by these vectors. The representation space of this subrepresentation is then finite-dimensional.\n\nThe '''degree''' of a representation is the [[Dimension (vector space)|dimension]]  of its representation space <math>V.</math> The notation <math>\\dim (\\rho)</math> is sometimes used to denote the degree of a representation <math>\\rho.</math>\n\n===Examples===\nThe '''trivial representation''' is given by <math>\\rho(s)=\\text{Id}</math> for all <math> s\\in G.</math>\n\nA representation of degree <math>1</math> of a group <math>G</math> is a homomorphism into the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] <math>\\rho:G\\to \\text{GL}_1 (\\Complex)=\\Complex^\\times = \\Complex \\setminus\\{0\\}.</math> As every element of <math>G</math> is of finite order, the values of <math>\\rho(s)</math> are [[root of unity|roots of unity]]. For example let <math>\\rho: G=\\Z/4\\Z  \\to \\Complex ^\\times</math> be a nontrivial linear representation. Since <math>\\rho</math> is a group homomorphism, it has to satisfy <math>\\rho({0})=1.</math> Because <math>1</math> generates <math>G, \\rho</math> is determined by its value on <math>\\rho(1).</math> And as <math>\\rho</math> is nontrivial, <math>\\rho({1})\\in\\{i,-1,-i\\}.</math> By this we achieve the result, that the image of <math>G</math> under <math>\\rho</math> has to be a nontrivial subgroup of the group which consists of the fourth roots of unity. This means, that <math>\\rho</math> has to be one of the following three maps:\n:<math> \\begin{cases} \\rho_1({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_1({1})=i \\\\ \\rho_1({2})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_1({3})=-i \\end{cases} \\qquad  \\begin{cases} \\rho_2({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_2({1})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_2({2})=1 \\\\ \\rho_2({3})=-1 \\end{cases} \\qquad  \\begin{cases} \\rho_3({0})=1 \\\\ \\rho_3({1})=-i \\\\ \\rho_3({2})=-1 \\\\ \\rho_3({3})=i \\end{cases}</math>\n\nLet <math>G=\\Z /2\\Z \\times\\Z /2\\Z </math> and let <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}_2(\\Complex )</math> be the group homomorphism defined by: \n:<math> \\rho({0},{0})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & 1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({1},{0})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     -1 & 0 \\\\\n     0 & -1\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({0},{1})=\n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 & 1 \\\\\n     1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\rho({1},{1})= \n   \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 & -1 \\\\\n     -1 & 0\n   \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nIn this case <math>\\rho</math> is a linear representation of <math>G</math> of degree <math>2.</math>\n\n====Permutation representation====\n{{further information|Permutation group}}\n\nLet <math>X</math> be a finite set. Let <math>G</math> be a group operating on <math>X.</math> The group <math>\\text{Aut}(X)</math> is the group of all permutations on <math>X</math> with the composition as operation.\n\nA group acting on a finite set is sometimes considered sufficient for the definition of the permutation representation. However, since we want to construct examples for linear representations, where groups act on vector spaces instead of on arbitrary finite sets, we have to proceed in a different way. In order to construct the permutation representation, we need a vector space <math>V</math> with <math>\\dim (V)=|X|.</math> A basis of <math>V</math> can be indexed by the elements of <math>X.</math> The permutation representation is the group homomorphism <math>\\rho : G \\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> given by <math>\\rho(s)e_x=e_{s.x}</math> for all <math>s\\in G, x\\in X.</math> All linear maps <math>\\rho(s)</math> are uniquely defined by this property.\n\n'''Example.'''

Let <math>G = \\Z /5\\Z </math> and <math>V=\\R^5</math> with the basis <math>\\{e_0,\\ldots, e_4\\}.</math> Then the left-regular representation <math>L_\\rho: G\\to \\text{GL}(V)</math> is defined by <math>L_\\rho(k)e_l=e_{l+k}</math> for <math>k, l \\in \\Z /5\\Z.</math> The right-regular representation is defined analogously by <math>R_\\rho(k)e_l=e_{l-k}</math> for <math>k, l \\in \\Z /5\\Z .</math>\n\n===Representations, modules and the convolution algebra===\nLet <math>G</math> be a finite group, let <math>K</math> be a commutative [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] and let <math>K[G]</math> be the [[group algebra]] of <math>G</math> over <math>K.</math> This algebra is free and a basis can be indexed by the elements of <math>G.</math> Most often the basis is identified with <math>G</math>. Every element <math>f \\in K[G]</math> can then be uniquely expressed as\n\n:<math>f=\\sum_{s\\in G} a_s s</math> with <math>a_s \\in K</math>.\n\nThe multiplication in <math>K[G]</math> extends that in <math>G</math> distributively.\n\nNow let <math>V</math> be a <math>K</math>–[[Module (mathematics)|module]] and let <math>\\rho: G\\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> be a linear representation of <math>G</math> in <math>V.</math> We define <math>sv=\\rho(s) v</math> for all <math>s\\in G</math> and <math>v\\in V</math>. By linear extension <math>V</math> is endowed with the structure of a left-<math>K[G]</math>–module.  Vice versa we obtain a linear representation of <math>G</math> starting from a <math>K[G]</math>–module <math>V</math>. Additionally, homomorphisms of representations are in bijective correspondence with group algebra homomorphisms. Therefore, these terms may be used interchangeably.<ref>{{harv|Serre|1971|47}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Sengupta|2012|62}}</ref> This is an example of an [[isomorphism of categories]].\n\nSuppose <math>K=\\Complex.</math> In this case the left <math>\\Complex [G]</math>–module given by <math>\\Complex [G]</math> itself corresponds to the left-regular representation. In the same way <math>\\Complex [G]</math> as a right <math>\\Complex [G]</math>–module corresponds to the right-regular representation.\n\nIn the following we will define the [[convolution algebra]]: Let <math>G</math> be a group, the set <math>L^1(G):=\\{f:G\\to\\Complex \\}</math> is a <math>\\Complex </math>–vector space with the operations addition and scalar multiplication then this vector space is isomorphic to <math>\\Complex^{|G|}.</math> The convolution of two elements <math>f, h \\in L^1(G)</math> defined by\n\n:<math>f*h(s):=\\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)h(t^{-1}s)</math>\n\nmakes <math>L^1(G)</math> an [[algebra over a field|algebra]]. The algebra <math>L^1(G)</math> is called the '''convolution algebra'''.\n\nThe convolution algebra is free and has a basis indexed by the group elements: <math>(\\delta_s)_{s\\in G},</math> where\n:<math>\\delta_s(t)=\\begin{cases} 1& t=s\\\\ 0 &  \\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}.</math>\nUsing the properties of the convolution we obtain: <math>\\delta_s*\\delta_t=\\delta_{st}.</math>\n\nWe define a map between <math>L^1(G)</math> and <math>\\Complex [G],</math> by defining <math>\\delta_s\\mapsto e_s</math> on the basis <math>(\\delta_s)_{s\\in G}</math> and extending it linearly. Obviously the prior map is [[Bijection|bijective]]. A closer inspection of the convolution of two basis elements as shown in the equation above reveals that the multiplication in <math>L^1(G)</math> corresponds to that in <math>\\Complex [G].</math> Thus, the convolution algebra and the group algebra are isomorphic as algebras.\n\nThe [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]\n\n:<math>f^*(s)=\\overline{f(s^{-1})}</math>\n\nturns <math>L^1(G)</math> into a [[*-algebra|<math>^*</math>–algebra]]. We have <math>\\delta_s^*=\\delta_{s^{-1}}.</math>\n\nA representation <math>(\\pi, V_\\pi)</math> of a group <math>G</math> extends to a <math>^*</math>–algebra homomorphism <math>\\pi: L^1(G)\\to\\text{End}(V_\\pi)</math> by <math>\\pi(\\delta_s)=\\pi(s).</math> Since multiplicity is a characteristic property of algebra homomorphisms, <math>\\pi</math> satisfies <math>\\pi(f*h)=\\pi(f)\\pi(h).</math> If <math>\\pi</math> is unitary, we also obtain <math>\\pi(f)^* =\\pi(f^*).</math> For the definition of a unitary representation, please refer to the chapter on [[#Properties|properties]]. In that chapter we will see, that, without loss of generality, every linear representation can be assumed to be unitary.\n\nUsing the convolution algebra we can implement a [[Fourier transform]]ation on a group <math>G.</math> In the area of [[harmonic analysis]] it is shown that the following definition is consistent with the definition of the Fourier transformation on <math>\\R.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\rho:G\\to\\text{GL}(V_\\rho)</math> be a representation and let <math>f\\in L^1(G)</math> be a <math>\\Complex</math>-valued function on <math>G</math>. The Fourier transform <math>\\hat{f}(\\rho)\\in \\text{End}(V_\\rho)</math> of <math>f</math> is defined as \n:<math>\\hat{f}(\\rho)=\\sum_{s\\in G} f(s)\\rho(s).</math>\nIt holds that <math>\\widehat{f*g}(\\rho)=\\hat{f}(\\rho)\\cdot\\hat{g}(\\rho).</math>\n\n===Maps between representations===\n{{See also|Equivariant map|Representation theory#Equivariant maps and isomorphisms}}\nA map between two representations <math>(\\rho, V_\\rho),\\, (\\tau, V_\\tau)</math> of the same group <math>G</math> is a linear map <math>T: V_\\rho\\to V_\\tau,</math> with the property that <math>\\tau(s)\\circ T=T\\circ\\rho(s)</math> holds for all <math>s\\in G.</math> In other words, the following diagram commutes for all <math>s\\in G</math>:\n\n:[[Image:Equivariant map.svg|200px]]\n\nSuch a map is also called '''<math>G</math>–linear''', or an '''[[equivariant map]]'''. The [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]], the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] and the [[cokernel]] of <math>T</math> are defined by default. The composition of equivariant maps is again an equivariant map. There is a [[category of representations]] with equivariant maps as its [[Morphism|morphisms]]. They are again <math>G</math>–modules. Thus, they provide representations of <math>G</math> due to the correlation described in the previous section.\n==Irreducible representations and Schur's lemma==\n\n{{Main|Schur's lemma}}\nLet <math>\\rho:G\\to\\text{GL}(V)</math> be a linear representation of <math>G.</math> Let <math>W</math> be a <math>G</math>–invariant subspace of <math>V,</math> i.e. <math> \\rho(s)w\\in W</math> for all <math> s\\in G, w\\in W.</math> The restriction <math>\\rho(s)|_W</math> is an isomorphism of <math>W</math> onto itself.

Some authors also call these representations simple, given that they are precisely the [[simple module]]s over the group algebra <math>\\Complex [G]</math>.\n\n''Schur's lemma'' puts a strong constraint on maps between irreducible representations.

More generally, if <math>\\rho_1</math> and <math>\\rho_2</math> are isomorphic, the space of ''G''-linear maps is one-dimensional.\n\n*Otherwise, if the two representations are not isomorphic, ''F'' must be 0.\n\n<ref>\n'''Proof.''' Suppose <math>F</math> is nonzero.

If the degree of the representation is ''n'', then the sum is ''n'' long. If ''s'' has order ''m'', these eigenvalues are all ''m''-th [[root of unity|roots of unity]].

If  <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math> are the distinct irreducible characters of <math>G</math>, they form an orthonormal basis for the vector space of all class functions with respect to the inner product defined above, i.e. \n* <math>(\\chi_i|\\chi_j)=\\begin{cases} 1 \\text{ if } i= j \\\\0 \\text{ otherwise }\\end{cases}.</math>\n* Every class function <math>f</math> may be expressed as a unique linear combination of the irreducible characters <math>\\chi_1, \\ldots ,\\chi_k</math>.\nOne might verify that the irreducible characters generate <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> by showing, that there exists no class function unequal to zero which is orthogonal to all the irreducible characters. To see this, for <math> \\rho </math> a representation and <math>f</math> a class function, denote <math> \\rho_f = \\sum_g f(g)\\rho (g).</math> Then for <math> \\rho </math> irreducible, we have <math> \\rho_f = \\frac {|G|}{n} \\langle f,\\chi _V^{*} \\rangle \\in End(V)</math> from [[Dot product|Schur's lemma]]. Suppose <math> f </math> is a class function which is orthogonal to all the characters. Then by the above we have <math> \\rho _f = 0 </math> whenever <math> \\rho </math> is irreducible. But then it follows that <math> \\rho _f = 0 </math> for all <math> \\rho </math>, by decomposability. Take <math> \\rho </math> to be the regular representation. Applying <math> \\rho _f </math> to some particular basis element <math>g</math>, we get <math> f(g)=0 </math>.  Since this is true for all <math>g</math>, we have <math>f=0.</math>\n\nIt follows from the orthonormal property that the number of non-isomorphic irreducible representations of a group <math>G</math> is equal to the number of [[conjugacy class]]es of <math>G.</math>\n\nFurthermore, a class function on <math>G</math> is a character of <math>G</math> if and only if it can be written as a linear combination of the distinct irreducible characters <math>\\chi_j</math> with non-negative integer coefficients: if <math>\\varphi</math> is a class function on <math>G</math> such that <math>\\varphi=c_1 \\chi_1 + \\cdots + c_k \\chi_k </math> where <math>c_j</math> non-negative integers, then <math>\\varphi</math> is the character of the direct sum <math>c_1 \\tau_1 \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus c_k \\tau_k</math> of the representations <math>\\tau_j</math> corresponding to <math>\\chi_j.</math> Conversely, it is always possible to write any character as a sum of irreducible characters.\n\nThe [[Dot product|inner product]] defined above can be extended on the set of all <math>\\Complex</math>-valued functions <math>L^1(G)</math> on a finite group:\n:<math> (f|h)_G=\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)\\overline{h(t)} </math>\nAlso a [[symmetric bilinear form]] can be defined on <math>L^1(G):</math>\n:<math> \\langle f,h\\rangle_G=\\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_{t\\in G}f(t)h(t^{-1}) </math>\nThese two forms match on the set of characters. If there is no danger of confusion the index of both forms <math>(\\cdot|\\cdot)_G</math> and <math> \\langle\\cdot|\\cdot\\rangle_G</math> will be omitted.\n\nLet <math>V_1, V_2</math> be two <math>\\Complex [G]</math>–modules. Note that <math>\\Complex [G]</math>–modules are simply representations of <math>G</math>. Since the orthonormal property yields the number of irreducible representations of <math>G</math> is exactly the number of its conjugacy classes, then there are exactly as many simple <math>\\Complex [G]</math>–modules (up to isomorphism) as there are conjugacy classes of <math>G.</math>\n\nWe define <math>\\langle V_1, V_2 \\rangle_G:=\\dim (\\text{Hom}^G(V_1,V_2)),</math> in which <math>\\text{Hom}^G(V_1,V_2)</math> is the vector space of all <math>G</math>–linear maps. This form is bilinear with respect to the direct sum.\n\nIn the following, these bilinear forms will allow us to obtain some important results with respect to the decomposition and irreducibility of representations.\n\nFor instance, let <math>\\chi_1</math> and <math>\\chi_2</math> be the characters of <math>V_1</math> and <math>V_2,</math> respectively.

Two representations with the same character are isomorphic.

It should also be mentioned, that <math>e</math> denotes the neutral element of the group.\n\nThis formula is a necessary and sufficient condition for all irreducible representations of a group up to isomorphism.

Consider <math>V</math> as an <math>\\mathbb{C}A</math>-module, and decompose it into isotypes as <math>V=\\bigoplus_j{V_j}</math>.  If this decomposition is trivial, we are in the second case.  Otherwise, the larger <math>G</math>-action permutes these isotypic modules; because <math>V</math> is irreducible as a <math>\\mathbb{C}G</math>-module, the permutation action is [[transitive action|transitive]] (in fact [[primitive action|primitive]]).  Fix any <math>j</math>; the [[Stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] in <math>G</math> of <math>V_j</math> is elementarily seen to exhibit the claimed properties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\Box</math>\n\nNote that if <math>A</math> is abelian, then the isotypic modules of <math>A</math> are irreducible, of degree one, and all homotheties.  \n\nWe obtain also the following\n\n:'''Corollary.''' Let <math>A</math> be an abelian normal subgroup of <math>G</math> and let <math>\\tau</math> be any irreducible representation of <math>G.</math> We denote with <math>(G : A)</math> the [[Index of a subgroup|index]] of <math>A</math> in <math>G.</math> Then <math>\\deg(\\tau)|(G : A).</math>[[#Literature|'''[1]''']]\n\nIf <math>A</math> is an abelian subgroup of <math>G</math> (not necessarily normal), generally <math>\\deg(\\tau)|(G : A)</math> is not satisfied, but nevertheless <math>\\deg(\\tau) \\leq (G : A) </math> is still valid.\n\n====Classification of representations of a semidirect product====\nIn the following, let <math>G=A\\rtimes H</math> be a semidirect product such that the normal semidirect factor, <math>A</math>, is abelian.  <!--There is inconsistent notation in the literature as to whether the ''left'' or the ''right'' semidirect factor is normal, so it's better to spell it out.-->  The irreducible representations of such a group <math>G,</math> can be classified by showing that all irreducible representations of <math>G</math> can be constructed from certain subgroups of <math>H</math>. This is the so-called method of “little groups” of Wigner and Mackey.\n\nSince <math>A</math> is [[abelian group|abelian]], the irreducible characters of <math>A</math> have degree one and form the group <math>\\Chi = \\text{Hom}(A,\\Complex^\\times).</math> The group <math>G</math> [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on <math>\\Chi</math> by <math>(s\\chi)(a) = \\chi(s^{-1}as)</math> for <math>s \\in G, \\chi \\in \\Chi, a \\in A.</math>\n\nLet <math>(\\chi_j)_{j\\in \\Chi/H}</math> be a [[Equivalence class#Notation and formal definition|representative system]] of the [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]] of <math>H</math> in <math>\\Chi.</math> For every <math>j \\in \\Chi/H</math> let <math>H_j = \\{t \\in H : t\\chi_j = \\chi_j\\}.</math> This is a subgroup of <math>H.</math> Let <math>G_j = A \\cdot H_j</math> be the corresponding subgroup of <math>G.</math> We now extend the function <math>\\chi_j</math> onto <math>G_j</math> by <math>\\chi_j(at) = \\chi_j(a)</math> for <math>a \\in A, t \\in H_j.</math> Thus, <math>\\chi_j</math> is a class function on <math>G_j.</math> Moreover, since <math>t\\chi_j = \\chi_j</math> for all <math>t \\in H_j,</math> it can be shown that <math>\\chi_j</math> is a group homomorphism from <math>G_j</math> to <math>\\Complex^\\times.</math> Therefore, we have a representation of <math>G_j</math> of degree one which is equal to its own character.\n\nLet now <math>\\rho</math> be an irreducible representation of <math>H_j. </math> Then we obtain an irreducible representation <math>\\tilde{\\rho}</math> of <math>G_j,</math> by combining <math>\\rho</math> with the [[Projection (linear algebra)|canonical projection]] <math>G_j \\to H_j.</math> Finally, we construct the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]] of <math>\\chi_j</math> and <math>\\tilde{\\rho}.</math> Thus, we obtain an irreducible representation <math>\\chi_j\\otimes \\tilde{\\rho}</math> of <math>G_j.</math>\n\nTo finally obtain the classification of the irreducible representations of <math>G</math> we use the representation <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> of <math>G,</math> which is induced by the tensor product <math>\\chi_j\\otimes \\tilde{\\rho}.</math> Thus, we achieve the following result:\n\n:'''Proposition.'''\n:* <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> is irreducible.\n:* If <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}</math> and <math>\\theta_{j',\\rho'}</math> are isomorphic, then <math>j = j'</math> and additionally <math>\\rho</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\rho'.</math>\n:* Every irreducible representation of <math>G</math> is isomorphic to one of the <math>\\theta_{j,\\rho}.</math>\n\nAmongst others, the criterion of Mackey and a conclusion based on the Frobenius reciprocity are needed for the proof of the proposition. Further details may be found in [[#Literature|'''[1]''']].\n\nIn other words we classified all irreducible representations of <math>G=A \\rtimes H.</math>\n\n==Representation ring==\nThe representation ring of <math>G</math> is defined as the abelian group\n:<math>R(G)= \\left \\{ \\left. \\sum_{j=1}^m a_j \\tau_j \\right |\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_m \\text{ all irreducible representations of } G \\text{ up to isomorphism},  a_j\\in\\Z \\right \\}.</math>\nWith the multiplication provided by the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]], <math>R(G)</math> becomes a ring. The elements of <math>R(G)</math> are called '''virtual representations'''.\n\nThe character defines a [[ring homomorphism]] in the set of all class functions on <math>G</math> with complex values\n\n:<math> \\begin{cases} \\chi: R(G)\\to\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)\\\\ \\sum a_j \\tau_j \\mapsto \\sum a_j \\chi_j \\end{cases} </math>\n\nin which the <math>\\chi_j</math> are the irreducible characters corresponding to the <math>\\tau_j.</math>\n\nBecause a representation is determined by its character, <math>\\chi</math> is [[Injective function|injective]]. The images of <math>\\chi</math> are called '''virtual characters'''.\n\nAs the irreducible characters form an [[orthonormal basis]] of <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}, \\chi</math> induces an isomorphism\n:<math>\\chi_\\Complex : R(G)\\otimes\\Complex  \\to \\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G). </math>\nThis isomorphism is defined on a basis out of [[Tensor product#Relation to dual space|elementary tensors]] <math>(\\tau_j\\otimes1)_{j=1,\\ldots, m}</math> by <math>\\chi_{\\Complex }(\\tau_j\\otimes1)=\\chi_j</math> respectively <math>\\chi_{\\Complex }(\\tau_j\\otimes z)=z\\chi_j,</math> and extended [[bilinear map|bilinearly]].\n\nWe write <math>\\mathcal{R}^+(G)</math> for the set of all characters of <math>G</math> and <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> to denote the group generated by <math>\\mathcal{R}^+(G),</math> i.e. the set of all differences of two characters. It holds  <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)=\\Z \\chi_1\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus\\Z \\chi_m</math> and <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)=\\text{Im}(\\chi)=\\chi(R(G)).</math> Thus, we have <math>R(G)\\cong\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> and the virtual characters correspond to the virtual representations in an optimal manner.\n\nSince <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)=\\text{Im}(\\chi)</math> holds, <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is the set of all virtual characters. As the product of two characters provides another character, <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is a subring of the ring <math>\\Complex_{\\text{class}}(G)</math> of all class functions on <math>G.</math> Because the <math>\\chi_i</math> form a basis of <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> we obtain, just as in the case of <math>R(G),</math> an isomorphism <math>\\Complex \\otimes \\mathcal{R}(G)\\cong\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G).</math>\n\nLet <math>H</math> be a subgroup of <math>G.</math> The restriction thus defines a ring homomorphism <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)\\to \\mathcal{R}(H), \\phi\\mapsto \\phi|_H,</math> which will be denoted by <math>\\text{Res}^G_H</math> or <math>\\text{Res}.</math> Likewise, the induction on class functions defines a homomorphism of abelian groups <math>\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G),</math> which will be written as <math>\\text{Ind}^G_H</math> or in short <math>\\text{Ind}.</math>\n\nAccording to the [[#Frobenius reciprocity|Frobenius reciprocity]], these two homomorphisms are adjoint with respect to the bilinear forms <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_H</math> and <math>\\langle \\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle_G.</math> Furthermore, the formula <math>\\text{Ind}(\\varphi\\cdot \\text{Res}(\\psi))=\\text{Ind}(\\varphi)\\cdot \\psi</math> shows that the image of <math>\\text{Ind}:\\mathcal{R}(H)\\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>\\mathcal{R}(G).</math>\n\nBy the restriction of representations, the map <math>\\text{Res}</math> can be defined analogously for <math>R(G),</math> and by the induction we obtain the map <math>\\text{Ind}</math> for <math>R(G).</math> Due to the Frobenius reciprocity, we get the result, that these maps are adjoint to each other and that the image <math>\\text{Im}(\\text{Ind})=\\text{Ind}(R(H))</math> is an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the ring <math>R(G).</math>\n\nIf <math>A</math> is a commutative ring, the homomorphisms <math>\\text{Res}</math> and <math>\\text{Ind}</math> may be extended to <math>A</math>–linear maps:\n:<math> \\begin{cases}\nA\\otimes \\text{Res}: A\\otimes R(G) \\to A\\otimes R(H)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\tau_j \\right ) \\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Res}(\\tau_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}, \\qquad  \\begin{cases}\n A\\otimes \\text{Ind}: A\\otimes R(H) \\to A\\otimes R(G)\\\\\n\\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\eta_j \\right )\\mapsto \\left (a \\otimes \\sum a_j \\text{Ind}(\\eta_j) \\right )\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nin which <math>\\eta_j</math> are all the irreducible representations of <math>H</math> up to isomorphism.\n\nWith <math>A=\\Complex </math> we obtain in particular, that <math>\\text{Ind}</math> and <math>\\text{Res}</math> supply homomorphisms between <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(G)</math> and <math>\\Complex _{\\text{class}}(H).</math>\n\nLet <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2</math> be two groups with respective representations <math>(\\rho_1, V_1)</math> and <math>(\\rho_2, V_2).</math> Then, <math>\\rho_1\\otimes\\rho_2</math> is the representation of the [[direct product]] <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> as was shown in a [[#Tensor product of representations|previous section]]. Another result of that section was, that all irreducible representations of <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> are exactly the representations <math>\\eta_1\\otimes\\eta_2,</math> where <math>\\eta_1</math> and <math>\\eta_2</math> are irreducible representations of <math>G_1</math> and <math>G_2,</math> respectively. This passes over to the representation ring as the identity <math>R(G_1\\times G_2)=R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2),</math> in which <math>R(G_1)\\otimes_{\\Z} R(G_2)</math> is the [[tensor product of modules|tensor product]] of the representation rings as <math>\\Z</math>–modules.\n==Induction theorems==\n\nInduction theorems relate the representation ring of a given finite group ''G'' to representation rings of a family ''X'' consisting of some subsets ''H'' of ''G''. More precisely, for such a collection of subgroups, the induction functor yields a map \n:<math>\\varphi: \\text{Ind}:\\bigoplus_{H\\in X}\\mathcal{R}(H) \\to \\mathcal{R}(G)</math>; induction theorems give criteria for the surjectivity of this map or closely related ones.\n''Artin's induction theorem'' is the most elementary theorem in this group of results. It asserts that the following are equivalent:\n\n* The [[cokernel]] of <math>\\varphi</math> is finite.\n\n* <math>G</math> is the union of the conjugates of the subgroups belonging to <math>X,</math> i.e. <math>G=\\bigcup_{H\\in X \\atop s\\in G}sHs^{-1}.</math>\n\nSince <math>\\mathcal{R}(G)</math> is finitely generated as a group, the first point can be rephrased as follows:\n*For each character <math>\\chi</math> of <math>G,</math> there exist virtual characters <math>\\chi_H \\in \\mathcal{R}(H), \\,H\\in X</math> and an integer <math> d\\geq 1,</math> such that <math> d\\cdot\\chi = \\sum_{H\\in X}\\text{Ind}^G_H(\\chi_H).</math>\n{{harvtxt|Serre|1977}} gives two proofs of this theorem. For example, since ''G'' is the union of its cyclic subgroups, every character of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with rational coefficients of characters induced by characters of [[cyclic group|cyclic subgroups]] of <math>G.</math> Since the representations of cyclic groups are well-understood, in particular the irreducible representations are one-dimensional, this gives a certain control over representations of ''G''.\n\nUnder the above circumstances, it is not in general true that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective. ''[[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|Brauer's induction theorem]]'' asserts that <math>\\varphi</math> is surjective, provided that ''X'' is the family of all ''elementary subgroups''.\nHere a group ''H'' is [[elementary group|elementary]] if there is some prime ''p'' such that ''H'' is the [[direct product]] of a [[cyclic group]] of order prime to <math>p</math> and a [[P-group|<math>p</math>–group]].\nIn other words, every [[#Character theory|character]] of <math>G</math> is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced by characters of elementary subgroups.\nThe elementary subgroups ''H'' arising in Brauer's theorem have a richer representation theory than cyclic groups, they at least have the property that any irreducible representation for such ''H'' is induced by a one-dimensional representation of a (necessarily also elementary) subgroup <math>K \\subset H</math>. (This latter property can be shown to hold for any [[supersolvable group]], which includes [[nilpotent group]]s and, in particular, elementary groups.) This ability to induce representations from degree 1 representations has some further consequences in the representation theory of finite groups.\n\n==Real representations==\nFor proofs and more information about representations over general subfields of <math>\\Complex </math> please refer to [[#Literature| '''[2]''']].\n\nIf a group <math>G</math> acts on a real vector space <math>V_0,</math> the corresponding representation on the complex vector space <math>V=V_0\\otimes_\\R \\Complex </math> is called '''real''' (<math>V</math> is called the [[complexification]] of <math>V_0</math>). The corresponding representation mentioned above is given by <math>s \\cdot(v_0\\otimes z) = (s\\cdot v_0)\\otimes z</math> for all <math>s\\in G, v_0\\in V_0, z\\in \\Complex.</math>\n\nLet <math>\\rho</math> be a real representation. The linear map <math>\\rho(s)</math> is <math>\\R</math>-valued for all <math>s\\in G.</math> Thus, we can conclude, that the character of a real representation is always real-valued. But not every representation with a real-valued character is real. To make this clear, let <math>G</math> be a finite, non-abelian subgroup of the group\n\n:<math>\\text{SU}(2)= \\left \\{\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ -\\overline{b} & \\overline{a} \\end{pmatrix} \\ : \\ |a|^2+|b|^2=1 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThen <math>G \\subset \\text{SU}(2)</math> acts on <math>V=\\Complex^2.</math> Since the trace of any matrix in <math>\\text{SU}(2)</math> is real, the character of the representation is real-valued. Suppose <math>\\rho</math> is a real representation, then <math>\\rho(G)</math> would consist only of real-valued matrices. Thus, <math>G \\subset \\text{SU}(2)\\cap\\text{GL}_2(\\R )=\\text{SO}(2)=S^1.</math> However the circle group is abelian but <math>G</math> was chosen to be a non-abelian group. Now we only need to prove the existence of a non-abelian, finite subgroup of <math>\\text{SU}(2).</math> To find such a group, observe that <math>\\text{SU}(2)</math> can be identified with the units of the [[quaternion]]s. Now let <math>G=\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,\\pm j, \\pm ij \\}.</math> The following two-dimensional representation of <math>G</math> is not real-valued, but has a real-valued character:\n:<math> \\begin{cases} \\rho : G \\to \\text{GL}_2(\\Complex ) \\\\[4pt] \\rho(\\pm 1)=\\begin{pmatrix} \\pm1&0\\\\0& \\pm1\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\rho(\\pm i)=\\begin{pmatrix} \\pm i&0\\\\0&\\mp i\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\rho(\\pm j)=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&\\pm i\\\\ \\pm i&0\\end{pmatrix} \\end{cases}</math>\nThen the image of <math>\\rho</math> is not real-valued, but nevertheless it is a subset of <math>\\text{SU}(2).</math> Thus, the character of the representation is real.\n\n:'''Lemma.''' An irreducible representation <math>V</math> of <math>G</math> is real if and only if there exists a [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] [[symmetric bilinear form]] <math>B</math> on <math>V</math> preserved by <math>G.</math>\n\nAn irreducible representation of <math>G</math> on a real vector space can become reducible when extending the field to <math>\\Complex.</math> For example the following real representation of the cyclic group is reducible when considered over <math>\\Complex</math>\n:<math>  \\begin{cases} \\rho : \\Z /m\\Z  \\to \\text{GL}_2(\\R ) \\\\[4pt]  \\rho(k)= \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos  \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m}\\right ) & \\sin \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) \\\\ -\\sin \\left(\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right ) & \\cos \\left (\\frac{2\\pi ik}{m} \\right )\\end{pmatrix} \\end{cases}</math>\n \nTherefore by classifying all the irreducible representations that are real over <math>\\Complex,</math> we still haven't classified all the irreducible real representations. But we achieve the following:\n\nLet <math>V_0</math> be a real vector space. Let <math>G</math> act irreducibly on <math>V_0</math> and let <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex.</math> If <math>V</math> is not irreducible, there are exactly two irreducible factors which are complex conjugate representations of <math>G.</math>\n\n'''Definition.''' A '''quaternionic''' representation is a (complex) representation <math>V,</math> which possesses a <math>G</math>–invariant anti-linear homomorphism <math>J:V\\to V</math> satisfying <math>J^2=-\\text{Id}.</math> Thus, a [[bilinear form#Symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms|skew-symmetric]], nondegenerate <math>G</math>–invariant bilinear form defines a quaternionic structure on <math>V.</math>\n\n:'''Theorem.''' An irreducible representation <math>V</math> is one and only one of the following:\n:: (i) complex: <math>\\chi_V</math> is not real-valued and there exists no <math>G</math>–invariant [[Degenerate bilinear form#Non-degenerate forms|nondegenerate]] bilinear form on <math>V.</math>\n:: (ii) real: <math>V=V_0\\otimes \\Complex ,</math> a real representation; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>–invariant nondegenerate [[symmetric bilinear form]].\n:: (iii) quaternionic: <math>\\chi_V</math> is real, but <math>V</math> is not real; <math>V</math> has a <math>G</math>–invariant skew-symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form.\n\n==Representations of particular groups==\n===Symmetric groups===\n\n{{main|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}\nRepresentation of the [[symmetric group]]s <math>S_n</math> have been intensely studied. Conjugacy classes in <math>S_n</math> (and therefore, by the above, irreducible representations) correspond to [[partition (number theory)|partition]]s of ''n''. For example, <math>S_3</math> has three irreducible representations, corresponding to the partitions\n\n:3; 2+1; 1+1+1\n\nof 3. For such a partition, a [[Young tableau]] is a graphical device depicting a partition. The irreducible representation corresponding to such a partition (or Young tableau) is called a [[Specht module]].\n\nRepresentations of different symmetric groups are related: any representation of <math>S_n \\times S_m</math> yields a representation of <math>S_{n+m}</math> by induction, and vice versa by restriction. The direct sum of all these representation rings\n\n:<math>\\bigoplus_{n \\ge 0} R(S_n)</math>\n\ninherits from these constructions the structure of a [[Hopf algebra]] which, it turns out, is closely related to [[symmetric function]]s.\n\n===Finite groups of Lie type===\n\nTo a certain extent, the representations of the <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> , as ''n'' varies, have a similar flavor as for the <math>S_n</math>; the above-mentioned induction process gets replaced by so-called [[parabolic induction]]. However, unlike for <math>S_n</math>, where all representations can be obtained by induction of trivial representations, this is not true for <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. Instead, new building blocks, known as [[cuspidal representation]]s, are needed.\n\nRepresentations of <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> and more generally, representations of [[finite groups of Lie type]] have been thoroughly studied. {{harvtxt|Bonnafé|2011}} describes the representations of <math>SL_2(\\mathbf F_q)</math>. A geometric description of irreducible representations of such groups, including the above-mentioned cuspidal representations, is obtained by [[Deligne-Lusztig theory]], which constructs such representation in the [[l-adic cohomology]] of [[Deligne-Lusztig variety|Deligne-Lusztig varieties]].\n\nThe similarity of the representation theory of <math>S_n</math> and <math>GL_n(\\mathbf F_q)</math> goes beyond finite groups. The [[philosophy of cusp forms]] highlights the kinship of representation theoretic aspects of these types of groups with general linear groups of [[local field]]s such as [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] and of the ring of [[adelic algebraic group|adele]]s, see {{harvtxt|Bump|2004}}.\n\n==Outlook—Representations of compact groups==\nThe theory of representations of compact groups may be, to some degree, extended to [[locally compact group]]s. The representation theory unfolds in this context great importance for harmonic analysis and the study of automorphic forms. For proofs, further information and for a more detailed insight which is beyond the scope of this chapter please consult [[#Literature| '''[4]''']] and [[#Literature| '''[5]''']].\n\n===Definition and properties===\nA '''topological group''' is a group together with a [[topology]] with respect to which the group composition and the inversion are [[continuous function|continuous]].\nSuch a group is called '''compact''', if any cover of <math>G,</math> which is open in the topology, has a finite subcover. Closed subgroups of a compact group are compact again.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>V</math> be a finite-dimensional <math>\\Complex</math>–vector space. A linear representation of <math>G</math> to <math>V</math> is a '''continuous group homomorphism''' <math>\\rho: G \\to \\text{GL}(V),</math> i.e. <math>\\rho(s)v</math> is a continuous function in the two variables <math>s\\in G</math> and <math>v\\in V.</math>\n\nA linear representation of <math>G</math> into a [[Banach space]] <math>V</math> is defined to be a continuous group homomorphism of <math>G</math> into the set of all bijective [[bounded operator|bounded linear operators]] on <math>V</math> with a continuous inverse. Since <math>\\pi(g)^{-1}=\\pi(g^{-1}),</math> we can do without the last requirement. In the following, we will consider in particular representations of compact groups in [[Hilbert space]]s.\n\nJust as with finite groups, we can define the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|group algebra]] and the [[#Representations, modules and the convolution algebra|convolution algebra]]. However, the group algebra provides no helpful information in the case of infinite groups, because the continuity condition gets lost during the construction. Instead the convolution algebra <math>L^1(G)</math> takes its place.\n\nMost properties of representations of finite groups can be transferred with appropriate changes to compact groups. For this we need a counterpart to the summation over a finite group:\n\n===Existence and uniqueness of the Haar measure=== \nOn a compact group <math>G</math> there exists exactly one [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] <math>dt,</math> such that:\n* It is a left-translation-invariant measure\n::<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(st)dt.</math>\n* The whole group has unit measure:\n::<math>\\int_{G} dt=1,</math>\nSuch a left-translation-invariant, normed measure is called '''[[Haar measure]]''' of the group <math>G.</math>\n\nSince <math>G</math> is compact, it is possible to show that this measure is also right-translation-invariant, i.e. it also applies\n\n:<math>\\forall s \\in G: \\quad  \\int_{G} f(t) dt = \\int_{G} f(ts)dt.</math>\n\nBy the scaling above the Haar measure on a finite group is given by <math>dt(s)=\\tfrac{1}{|G|}</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nAll the definitions to representations of finite groups, that are mentioned in the section [[#Properties|”Properties”]], also apply to representations of compact groups. But there are some modifications needed:\n\nTo define a subrepresentation we now need a closed subspace. This was not necessary for finite-dimensional representation spaces, because in this case every subspace is already closed. Furthermore, two representations <math>\\rho, \\pi</math> of a compact group <math>G</math> are called equivalent, if there exists a bijective, continuous, linear operator <math>T</math> between the representation spaces whose inverse is also continuous and which satisfies <math>T\\circ\\rho(s)=\\pi(s)\\circ T</math> for all <math>s\\in G.</math>\n\nIf <math>T</math> is unitary, the two representations are called '''unitary equivalent'''.\n\nTo obtain a <math>G</math>–invariant [[inner product]] from a not <math>G</math>–invariant, we now have to use the integral over <math>G</math> instead of the sum. If <math>(\\cdot|\\cdot)</math> is an inner product on a [[Hilbert space]] <math>V,</math> which is not invariant with respect to the representation <math>\\rho</math> of <math>G,</math> then\n\n:<math> (v|u)_\\rho=\\int_G(\\rho(t)v|\\rho(t)u)dt</math>\n\nis a <math>G</math>–invariant inner product on <math>V</math> due to the properties of the Haar measure <math>dt.</math> Thus, we can assume every representation on a Hilbert space to be unitary.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a compact group and let <math>s\\in G.</math> Let <math>L^2(G)</math> be the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions on <math>G.</math> We define the operator <math>L_s</math> on this space by <math>L_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(s^{-1}t),</math> where <math>\\Phi\\in L^2(G), t\\in G.</math>\n\nThe map <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> is a unitary representation of <math>G.</math> It is called '''left-regular representation'''. The '''right-regular representation''' is defined similarly. As the Haar measure of <math>G</math> is also right-translation-invariant, the operator <math>R_s</math> on <math>L^2(G)</math> is given by <math>R_s\\Phi(t)=\\Phi(ts).</math> The right-regular representation is then the unitary representation given by  <math> s\\mapsto R_s.</math> The two representations <math>s\\mapsto L_s</math> and <math>s\\mapsto R_s</math> are dual to each other.\n\nIf <math>G</math> is infinite, these representations have no finite degree. The [[#Left- and right-regular representation|left- and right-regular representation]] as defined at the beginning are isomorphic to the left- and right-regular representation as defined above, if the group <math>G</math> is finite. This is due to the fact, that in this case <math>L^2(G)\\cong L^1(G)\\cong\\Complex [G].</math>\n\n===Constructions and decompositions===\nThe different ways of constructing new representations from given ones can be used for compact groups as well, except for the dual representation with which we will deal later. The [[#Direct sum of representations|direct sum]] and the [[#Tensor product of representations|tensor product]] with a finite number of summands/factors are defined in exactly the same way as for finite groups. This is also the case for the symmetric and alternating square. Additionally, we need a Haar measure on the [[direct product]] of groups in order to obtain also for compact groups the result, that the irreducible representations of the product of two groups are, up to isomorphism, exactly the tensor product of the irreducible representations of the single groups. The direct product of two compact groups <math>G_1\\times G_2</math> is again a compact group, if provided with the product topology. The Haar measure on this group is given by the product of the Haar measures of the single groups.\n\nFor the dual representation on compact groups we require the [[Dual space#Continuous dual space|topological dual]] <math>V'</math> of the vector space <math>V.</math> This is the vector space of all continuous linear functionals from the vector space <math>V</math> into the base field. Let <math>\\pi</math> be a representation of a compact group <math>G</math> in <math>V.</math>\n\nThe dual representation <math>\\pi':G\\to\\text{GL}(V')</math> is defined by the property \n\n:<math>\\forall v\\in V, \\forall v'\\in V', \\forall s\\in G: \\qquad  \\left \\langle\\pi'(s)v',\\pi(s)v \\right \\rangle=\\langle v',v\\rangle := v'(v).</math> \n\nThus, we can conclude, that the dual representation is given by <math>\\pi'(s)v'=v'\\circ\\pi(s^{-1})</math> for all <math>v'\\in V', s\\in G.</math> The map <math>\\pi'</math> is again a continuous group homomorphism and thus a representation.\n\nOn Hilbert spaces: <math>\\pi</math> is irreducible if and only if <math>\\pi'</math> is irreducible.\n\nBy transferring the results of the section [[#Decompositions|decompositions]] to compact groups, we obtain the following theorems:\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Every irreducible representation <math>(\\tau,V_\\tau)</math> of a compact group into a [[Hilbert space]] is finite-dimensional and there exists an [[inner product]] on <math>V_\\tau</math> such that <math>\\tau</math> is unitary. Since the Haar measure is normalized, this inner product is unique.\n\nEvery representation of a compact group is isomorphic to a [[Direct sum of modules#Direct sum of Hilbert spaces|direct Hilbert sum]] of irreducible representations.\n\nLet <math>(\\rho,V_\\rho)</math> be a unitary representation of the compact group <math>G.</math> Just as for finite groups we define for an irreducible representation <math>(\\tau, V_\\tau)</math> the isotype or isotypic component in <math>\\rho</math> to be the subspace \n\n:<math>V_\\rho(\\tau)=\\sum_{V_{\\tau} \\cong U\\subset V_\\rho} U.</math>\n\nThis is the sum of all invariant closed subspaces <math>U,</math> which are <math>G</math>–isomorphic to <math>V_\\tau.</math>\n\nNote, that the isotypes of not equivalent irreducible representations are pairwise orthogonal.\n\n:'''Theorem.'''\n::(i) <math>V_\\rho(\\tau)</math> is a closed invariant subspace of <math>V_\\rho.</math>\n::(ii) <math>V_\\rho(\\tau)</math> is <math>G</math>–isomorphic to the direct sum of copies of <math>V_\\tau.</math>\n::(iii) Canonical decomposition: <math> V_\\rho</math> is the direct Hilbert sum of the isotypes <math>V_\\rho(\\tau),</math> in which <math>\\tau</math> passes through all the isomorphism classes of the irreducible representations.\n\nThe corresponding projection to the canonical decomposition <math>p_\\tau: V\\to V(\\tau),</math> in which <math>V(\\tau)</math> is an isotype of <math>V,</math> is for compact groups given by\n:<math>p_\\tau(v)=n_\\tau\\int_G\\overline{\\chi_\\tau(t)}\\rho(t)(v)dt,</math>\nwhere <math>n_\\tau=\\dim (V(\\tau))</math> and <math>\\chi_\\tau</math> is the character corresponding to the irreducible representation <math>\\tau.</math>\n\n====Projection formula==== \nFor every representation <math>(\\rho,V)</math> of a compact group <math>G</math> we define \n\n:<math>V^G=\\{v\\in V : \\rho(s)v=v \\,\\,\\,\\forall s \\in G\\}.</math>\n\nIn general <math>\\rho(s): V\\to V</math> is not <math>G</math>–linear.

In most cases they are not finite-dimensional. Therefore, it is not useful to refer to [[#Character theory|characters]] when speaking about representations of compact groups. Nevertheless in most cases it is possible to restrict the study to the case of finite dimensions:\n\nSince irreducible representations of compact groups are finite-dimensional and unitary (see results from the [[#Definition and properties|first subsection]]), we can define irreducible characters in the same way as it was done for finite groups.\n\nAs long as the constructed representations stay finite-dimensional, the characters of the newly constructed representations may be obtained in the same way as for finite groups.\n\n'''Schur's lemma''' is also valid for compact groups:\n\nLet <math>(\\pi,V)</math> be an irreducible unitary representation of a compact group <math>G.</math> Then every bounded [[Operator (mathematics)#linear operators|operator]] <math>T:V\\to V</math> satisfying the property <math>T\\circ\\pi(s)=\\pi(s)\\circ T</math> for all <math>s\\in G,</math> is a scalar multiple of the identity, i.e. there exists <math>\\lambda \\in \\Complex </math> such that <math>T=\\lambda \\text{Id}.</math>\n\n'''Definition.'''

Let <math>\\chi</math> and <math>\\chi'</math> be the characters of two non-isomorphic irreducible representations <math>V</math> and <math>V',</math> respectively.

      "text": "'''Modular representation theory''' is a branch of [[mathematics]], and that part of [[representation theory]] that studies [[linear representation]]s of [[finite group]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' of positive [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] ''p'', necessarily a prime number. As well as having applications to group theory, modular representations arise naturally in other branches of mathematics, such as [[algebraic geometry]], [[coding theory]]{{Citation needed|reason=unveriviable and unsufficient citation about the source|date=May 2017}}, [[combinatorics]] and [[number theory]].\n\nWithin finite [[group theory]], character-theoretic results proved by [[Richard Brauer]] using modular representation theory played an important role in early progress towards the [[classification of finite simple groups]], especially for simple groups whose characterization was not amenable to purely group-theoretic methods because their Sylow 2 subgroups were too small in an appropriate sense. Also, a general result on embedding of elements of order 2 in finite groups called the [[Z* theorem]], proved by [[George Glauberman]] using the theory developed by Brauer, was particularly useful in the classification program.\n\nIf the characteristic ''p'' of ''K'' does not divide the order |''G''|, then modular representations are completely reducible, as with ''ordinary'' (characteristic 0) representations, by virtue of  [[Maschke's theorem]]. In the other case, when |''G''| &equiv; 0 mod ''p'', the process of averaging over the group needed to prove Maschke's theorem breaks down, and representations need not be completely reducible. Much of the discussion below implicitly assumes that the field ''K'' is sufficiently large (for example, ''K'' algebraically closed suffices), otherwise some statements need refinement.\n\n==History==\n\nThe earliest work on representation theory over finite fields is by {{harvtxt|Dickson|1902}} who showed that when ''p'' does not divide the order of the group, the representation theory is similar to that in characteristic 0. He also investigated [[modular invariant of a group|modular invariants]] of some finite groups. The systematic study of modular representations, when the characteristic ''p'' divides the order of the group,  was started by {{harvtxt|Brauer|1935}} and was continued by him for the next few decades.\n\n== Example ==\n\nFinding a representation of the [[cyclic group]] of two elements over '''F'''<sub>2</sub> is equivalent to the problem of finding matrices whose square is the identity matrix.  Over every field of characteristic other than 2, there is always a basis such that the matrix can be written as a diagonal matrix with only 1 or &minus;1 occurring on the diagonal, such as\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nOver '''F'''<sub>2</sub>, there are many other possible matrices, such as\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 1\\\\\n0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nOver an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic,\nthe representation theory of a finite cyclic group is fully explained\nby the theory of the [[Jordan normal form]]. Non-diagonal Jordan\nforms occur when the characteristic divides the order of the group.\n\n== Ring theory interpretation ==\n\nGiven a field ''K'' and a finite group ''G'', the [[group algebra]] ''K''[''G''] (which is the ''K''-vector space\nwith ''K''-basis consisting of the elements of ''G'', endowed with\nalgebra multiplication by extending the multiplication\nof ''G'' by linearity) is an [[Artinian ring]].\n\nWhen the order of ''G'' is divisible by the characteristic of ''K'',  the group algebra is not [[Semisimple algebraic group|semisimple]], hence has non-zero [[Jacobson radical]]. In that case, there are finite-dimensional modules for the group algebra that are not [[projective module]]s. By contrast, in the characteristic 0 case every [[irreducible representation]] is a [[direct summand]] of the [[regular representation]], hence is projective.\n\n==Brauer characters==\nModular representation theory was developed by [[Richard Brauer]] from about 1940 onwards to study in greater depth the relationships between the\ncharacteristic ''p'' representation theory, ordinary character theory and structure of ''G'', especially  as the latter relates to the embedding of, and relationships between, its ''p''-subgroups. Such results can be applied in [[group theory]] to problems not directly phrased in terms of representations.\n\nBrauer introduced the notion now known as the '''Brauer character'''. When ''K'' is algebraically closed of positive characteristic ''p'', there is a bijection between roots of unity in ''K'' and complex roots of unity of order prime to ''p''. Once a choice of such a  bijection is fixed, the Brauer character of a representation assigns to each group element of order coprime to ''p'' the sum of complex roots of unity corresponding to the eigenvalues  (including multiplicities) of that element in the given representation.\n\nThe Brauer character of a representation determines its composition\nfactors but not, in general, its equivalence type. The irreducible\nBrauer characters are those afforded by the simple modules.\nThese are integral (though not necessarily non-negative) combinations\nof the restrictions to elements of order coprime to ''p'' of the ordinary irreducible\ncharacters. Conversely, the restriction to the elements of order prime to ''p'' of\neach ordinary irreducible character is uniquely expressible as a non-negative\ninteger combination of irreducible Brauer characters.\n\n==Reduction (mod ''p'')==\nIn the theory initially developed by Brauer, the link between ordinary representation theory and modular representation theory is best exemplified by considering the\n[[group algebra]] of the group ''G'' over a complete discrete\nvaluation ring ''R'' with residue field ''K'' of positive\ncharacteristic ''p'' and field of fractions ''F'' of characteristic\n0, such as the [[p-adic integers]]. The structure of ''R''[''G''] is closely related both to\nthe structure of the group algebra ''K''[''G''] and to the structure of the semisimple group algebra  ''F''[''G''], and there is much interplay\nbetween the module theory of the three algebras.\n\nEach ''R''[''G'']-module naturally gives rise to an ''F''[''G'']-module,\nand, by a process often known informally as '''reduction (mod p)''',\nto a ''K''[''G'']-module. On the other hand, since ''R'' is a\n[[principal ideal domain]], each finite-dimensional ''F''[''G'']-module\narises by extension of scalars from an ''R''[''G'']-module. In general,\nhowever, not all ''K''[''G'']-modules arise as reductions (mod p) of\n''R''[''G'']-modules. Those that do are '''liftable'''.\n\n== Number of simple modules ==\n\nIn ordinary representation theory, the number of simple modules ''k''(''G'') is equal to the number of [[conjugacy class]]es of ''G''. In the modular case, the number ''l''(''G'') of simple modules is equal to the number of conjugacy classes whose elements have order coprime to the relevant prime ''p'', the so-called ''p''-regular classes.\n\n== Blocks and the structure of the group algebra ==\n\nIn modular representation theory, while Maschke's theorem does not hold\nwhen the characteristic divides the group order, the group algebra may be decomposed as the direct sum of a maximal collection of two-sided ideals known as '''blocks'''. When the field ''F'' has characteristic 0, or characteristic coprime to the group order, there is still such a decomposition of the  group algebra ''F''[''G''] as a sum of blocks (one for each isomorphism type of simple module), but the situation is relatively transparent when ''F'' is sufficiently large: each block is a full matrix algebra over ''F'', the endomorphism ring of the vector space underlying the associated simple module.\n\nTo obtain the blocks, the identity element of the group ''G'' is decomposed as a sum of primitive [[idempotent]]s\nin ''Z''(''R''[G]),  the center of the group algebra over the maximal order ''R'' of ''F''. The block corresponding to the primitive idempotent\n''e'' is the two-sided ideal ''e'' ''R''[''G'']. For each indecomposable ''R''[''G'']-module, there is only one such primitive idempotent that does not annihilate it, and the module is said to belong to (or to be in)  the corresponding block (in which case, all its [[composition factor]]s also belong to that block). In particular, each simple module belongs to a unique block. Each ordinary irreducible character may also be assigned to a unique block according to its decomposition as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters. The block containing the [[trivial representation|trivial module]] is known as the '''principal block'''.\n\n== Projective modules ==\n\nIn ordinary representation theory, every indecomposable module is irreducible, and so every module is projective. However, the simple modules with characteristic dividing the group order are rarely projective. Indeed, if a simple module is projective, then it is the only simple module in its block, which is then isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of the underlying vector space, a full matrix algebra. In that case, the block is said to have 'defect 0'. Generally, the structure of projective modules is difficult to determine.\n\nFor the group algebra of a finite group, the (isomorphism types of) projective indecomposable modules are in a one-to-one correspondence with the (isomorphism types of) simple modules: the [[Socle (mathematics)|socle]] of each projective indecomposable is simple (and isomorphic to the top), and this affords the bijection, as non-isomorphic projective indecomposables have\nnon-isomorphic socles. The multiplicity of a projective indecomposable module as a summand of the group algebra (viewed as the regular module) is the dimension of its socle (for large enough fields of characteristic zero, this recovers the fact that each simple module occurs with multiplicity equal to its dimension as a direct summand of the regular module).\n\nEach projective indecomposable module (and hence each projective module) in positive characteristic ''p'' may be lifted to a module in characteristic 0. Using the ring ''R'' as above, with residue field ''K'', the identity element of ''G'' may be decomposed as a sum of mutually orthogonal primitive [[idempotent]]s (not necessarily\ncentral) of ''K''[''G'']. Each projective indecomposable ''K''[''G'']-module is isomorphic to  ''e''.''K''[''G''] for a primitive idempotent ''e'' that occurs in this decomposition. The idempotent ''e'' lifts to a primitive idempotent, say ''E'', of ''R''[''G''], and the left module ''E''.''R''[''G''] has reduction (mod p) isomorphic to ''e''.''K''[''G''].\n\n==Some orthogonality relations for Brauer characters==\nWhen  a projective module is lifted, the associated character vanishes on all elements of order divisible by ''p'', and (with consistent choice of roots of unity), agrees with the Brauer character of the original characteristic ''p'' module on ''p''-regular elements. The (usual character-ring) inner product of the Brauer character of a projective indecomposable with any other Brauer character can thus be defined: this is 0 if the\nsecond Brauer character is that of the socle of a non-isomorphic projective indecomposable, and 1\nif the second Brauer character is that of its own socle. The multiplicity of an ordinary irreducible\ncharacter in the character of the lift of a projective indecomposable is equal to the number\nof occurrences of the Brauer character of the socle of the projective indecomposable when the restriction of the ordinary character to ''p''-regular elements is expressed as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters.\n\n==Decomposition matrix and Cartan matrix==\n\nThe [[composition series|composition factors]] of the projective indecomposable modules may be calculated as follows:\nGiven the ordinary irreducible and irreducible Brauer characters of a particular finite group, the irreducible [[ordinary character]]s may be decomposed as non-negative integer combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters. The integers involved can be placed in a matrix, with the ordinary irreducible characters assigned rows and the irreducible Brauer characters assigned columns. This is referred to as the ''[[decomposition matrix]]'', and is frequently labelled ''D''. It is customary to place the trivial ordinary and Brauer characters in the first row and column respectively. The product of the transpose of ''D'' with ''D'' itself\nresults in the [[Cartan matrix]], usually denoted ''C''; this is a symmetric matrix such that the entries in its ''j''-th row are the multiplicities of the respective simple modules as composition\nfactors of the ''j''-th projective indecomposable module. The Cartan\nmatrix is non-singular; in fact, its determinant is a power of the\ncharacteristic of ''K''.\n\nSince a projective indecomposable module in a given block has\nall its composition factors in that same block, each block has\nits own Cartan matrix.\n\n== Defect groups ==\n\nTo each block ''B'' of the group algebra ''K''[''G''], Brauer associated a certain ''p''-subgroup, known as its '''defect group''' (where ''p'' is the characteristic of ''K''). Formally, it is the largest ''p''-subgroup\n''D'' of ''G'' for which there is a [[Brauer's three main theorems|Brauer correspondent]] of ''B'' for the\nsubgroup <math>DC_G(D)</math>, where <math>C_G(D)</math> is the [[centralizer]] of ''D'' in ''G''.\n\nThe defect group of a block is unique up to conjugacy and has a strong influence on the structure of the block. For example, if the defect group is trivial, then the block contains just one simple module, just one ordinary character, the ordinary and Brauer irreducible characters agree on elements of order prime to the relevant characteristic ''p'', and the simple module is projective. At the other extreme, when ''K'' has characteristic ''p'', the [[Sylow]] ''p''-subgroup of the finite group ''G'' is a defect group for the principal block of ''K''[''G''].\n\nThe order of the defect group of a block has many arithmetical characterizations related to representation theory. It is the largest invariant factor of the Cartan matrix of the block, and occurs with\nmultiplicity one. Also, the power of ''p'' dividing the index of the defect group of a block is the [[greatest common divisor]] of the powers of ''p'' dividing the dimensions of the simple modules in that block, and this coincides with the greatest common divisor of the powers of ''p'' dividing the degrees of the ordinary irreducible characters in that block.\n\nOther relationships between the defect group of a block and character theory include Brauer's result that if no conjugate of the ''p''-part of a group element ''g'' is in the defect group of a given block, then each irreducible character in that block vanishes at ''g''. This is one of many consequences of Brauer's second main theorem.\n\nThe defect group of a block also has several characterizations in the more module-theoretic approach to block theory, building on the work of [[Sandy Green (mathematician)|J. A. Green]], which associates a ''p''-subgroup\nknown as the '''vertex''' to an indecomposable module, defined in terms  of '''relative projectivity''' of the module. For example, the vertex of each indecomposable module in a block is contained (up to conjugacy)\nin the defect group of the block, and no proper subgroup of the defect group has that property.\n\nBrauer's first main theorem states that the number of blocks of a finite group that have a given ''p''-subgroup as defect group is the same as the corresponding number for the normalizer in the group of that ''p''-subgroup.\n\nThe easiest block structure to analyse with non-trivial defect group is when the latter is cyclic. Then there are only finitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block, and the structure of the block is by now well understood, by virtue of work of Brauer, [[E.C. Dade]], J.A.Green and [[John Griggs Thompson|J.G.Thompson]], among others. In all other cases, there are infinitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block.\n\nBlocks whose defect groups are not cyclic can be divided into two types: tame and wild. The tame blocks (which only occur for the prime 2) have as a defect group a [[dihedral group]], [[semidihedral group]] or (generalized) [[quaternion group]], and their structure has been broadly determined in a series of papers by [[Karin Erdmann]]. The indecomposable modules in wild blocks are extremely difficult to classify, even in principle.\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Brauer | first1=R. | author1-link=Richard Brauer | title=Über die Darstellung von Gruppen in Galoisschen Feldern | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkexAAAAIAAJ | publisher=Hermann et cie, Paris . | series=Actualités Scientifiques et Industrielles, | id=[http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183499883 review] | year=1935 | volume=195 | pages=1–15}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Dickson | first1=Leonard Eugene | author1-link=Leonard Eugene Dickson | title=On the Group Defined for any Given Field by the Multiplication Table of Any Given Finite Group | jstor=1986379 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1902 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=3 | issue=3 | pages=285–301 | doi=10.2307/1986379}}\n* {{cite book | author=[[Jean-Pierre Serre]] | title=Linear Representations of Finite Groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1977 | isbn=0-387-90190-6}}\n* {{cite book | author=Walter Feit | authorlink=Walter Feit | title=The representation theory of finite groups | series=North-Holland Mathematical Library | volume=25 | publisher=North-Holland Publishing | location=Amsterdam-New York | year=1982 | isbn=0-444-86155-6 }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Modular Representation Theory}}\n[[Category:Module theory|*]]\n[[Category:Representation theory of finite groups|*]]\n[[Category:Finite fields]]"

      "text": "{{Orphan|date=May 2014}}\n\nIn mathematics, the '''Garnir relations''' give a way of expressing a basis of the [[Specht module]]s ''V''<sub>λ</sub> in terms of standard polytabloids.\n\n==Specht modules in terms of polytabloids==\nGiven a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] ''λ'' of ''n'', one has the Specht module ''V''<sub>λ</sub>. In characteristic 0, this is an irreducible representation of the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>. One can construct ''V<sub>λ</sub>'' explicitly in terms of polytabloids as follows:\n* Start with the permutation representation of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> acting on all [[Young tableau]]x of shape ''λ'', which are fillings of the Young diagram of ''λ'' with numbers 1, 2, ... ''n', each used once (note that we do not require the tableaux to be standard, there are no conditions imposed along rows or columns). The group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> acts by permuting the positions in each tableau (for instance there is a cyclic permutation the cycles the entries of the first row one place forward).\n* A [[Young tabloid]] is an orbit of Young tableaux under the action of the row permutations, the subgroup of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> of permutations that permute the positions in each row separately (this \"Young subgroup\" is a product of symmetric groups, one for each row). The Young tabloid of ''T'' is denoted {''T''}.\n* Now consider the free Abelian group of polytabloids, the formal linear combinations with integer coefficients of Young tabloids. To any Young tableau ''T'' one associates a polytabloid ''e''<sub>T</sub> as follows. One first forms the orbit of ''T'' under the action of the group <math>{\\rm col}(\\lambda)</math> of column permutations (another Young subgroup, defined similarly to row permutations but permuting positions within individual columns only). Then, writing the result of action on a tableau ''T'' by a column permutation ''σ'' as ''Tσ'', defines:\n::<math>e_T = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in {\\rm col}(\\lambda)} \\sgn(\\sigma) \\{T \\sigma\\}. </math>\n:It should be noted that <math>\\{T\\}=\\{T'\\}</math> ''does not'' imply <math>e_T=e_{T'}</math>, since the actions of row and column permutations do not commute in general.\n* The Specht module ''V<sub>λ</sub>'' is then the subspace of the space of all polytabloids spanned by the polytabloids ''e''<sub>T</sub> for all Young tableaux ''T'' of shape ''λ''.\n\n==Straightening polytabloids and the Garnir elements==\nThe above construction gives an explicit description of the Specht module ''V''<sub>λ</sub>. However, the polytabloids associated to different Young tableaux are not necessarily linearly independent, indeed, the dimension of ''V''<sub>λ</sub> is exactly the number of '''standard''' Young tableaux of shape λ. In fact, the polytabloids associated to standard Young tableaux span ''V''<sub>λ</sub>; to express other polytabloids in terms of them, one uses a '''straightening algorithm'''.\n\nGiven a Young tableau ''S'', we construct the polytabloid ''e''<sub>''S''</sub> as above. Without loss of generality, all columns of ''S'' are increasing, otherwise we could instead start with the modified Young tableau with increasing columns, whose polytabloid will differ at most by a sign. ''S'' is then said to not have any ''column descents''. We want to express ''e''<sub>''S''</sub> as a linear combination of standard polytabloids, i.e. polytabloids associated to standard Young tableaux. To do this, we would like permutations π<sub>''i''</sub> such that in all tableaux ''S''π<sub>i</sub>, a row descent has been eliminated, with <math> S(1 + \\sum_i \\pi_i) = 0</math>. This then expresses ''S'' in terms of polytabloids that are closer to being standard. The permutations that achieve this are the '''Garnir elements'''.\n\nSuppose we want to eliminate a row descent in the Young tableau ''T''. We pick two subsets ''A'' and ''B'' of the boxes of ''T'' as in the following diagram:\n\n[[File:Row descent.svg]]\n\nThen the Garnir element <math>g_{A,B}</math> is defined to be <math>\\sum_i \\sgn(\\pi_i) \\pi_i</math>, where the π<sub>''i''</sub> are the permutations of the entries of the boxes of ''A'' and ''B'' that keep both subsets ''A'' and ''B'' without column descents.\n\n==Example==\nConsider the following Young tableau:\n\n[[File:Row descent and Garnir element.svg]]\n\nThere is a row descent in the second row, so we choose the subsets ''A'' and ''B'' as indicated, which gives us the following:\n\n[[File:Straightening of a polytabloid.svg]]\n\nThis gives us the Garnir element <math>g_{A,B} = 1 - (4 5) + (2 4 5) + (4 6 5) - (2 4 6 5) + (2 5) (4 6)</math>. This allows us to remove the row descent in the second row, but this has also introduced other descents in other places. But there is a way in which all tableaux obtained like this are closer to being standard, this is measured by a ''dominance order'' on polytabloids. Therefore, one can repeatedly apply this procedure to ''straighten'' a polytabloid, eventually writing it as a linear combination of standard polytabloids, showing that the Specht module is spanned by the standard polytabloids. As they are also linearly independent, they form a basis of this module.\n\n== Other interpretations ==\nThere is a similar description for the irreducible representations of ''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>. In that case, one can consider the [[Weyl module]]s associated to a partition &lambda;, which can be described in terms of [[bideterminant]]s. One has a similar straightening algorithm, but this time in terms of semistandard Young tableaux.\n\n==References==\n* William Fulton.

      "text": "In [[group theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Murnaghan–Nakayama rule''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] method to compute [[Representation theory of the symmetric group|irreducible character]] values of a [[symmetric group]].<ref>Richard Stanley, ''Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 2''</ref>\nThere are several generalizations of this rule beyond the representation theory of symmetric groups, but they are not covered here.\n\nThe irreducible characters of a group are of interest to mathematicians because they concisely summarize important information about the group, such as the dimensions of the vector spaces in which the elements of the group can be represented by linear transformations that “mix” all the dimensions. For many groups, calculating irreducible character values is very difficult; the existence of simple formulas is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nThe Murnaghan–Nakayama rule is a combinatorial rule for computing symmetric group character values &chi;{{su|p=&lambda;|b=&rho;}} using a particular kind of [[Young tableaux]].\nHere λ and ρ are both [[integer partition]]s of some integer ''n'', the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of the symmetric group under consideration. The partition λ specifies the irreducible character, while the partition ρ specifies the [[conjugacy class]] on whose group elements the character is evaluated to produce the character value. The partitions are represented as [[Monotonic function|weakly decreasing]] tuples; for example, two of the partitions of 8 are (5,2,1) and (3,3,1,1).\n\nThere are two versions of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule, one non-recursive and one recursive.\n\n==Non-recursive version==\n\n'''Theorem:''' \n:<math>\\chi^{\\lambda}_\\rho = \\sum_{T \\in BST(\\lambda,\\rho)} (-1)^{ht(T)}</math>\nwhere the sum is taken over the set BST(λ,ρ) of all ''border-strip'' tableaux of shape λ and type ρ.\nThat is, each tableau ''T'' is a tableau such that\n* the ''k''-th row of ''T'' has λ<sub>k</sub> boxes\n* the boxes of ''T'' are filled with integers, with the integer ''i'' appearing ρ<sub>i</sub> times\n* the integers in every row and column are [[Monotonic function|weakly increasing]]\n* the set of squares filled with the integer ''i'' form a ''border strip'', that is, a connected skew-shape with no 2×2-square.\n\nThe ''height'', ''ht''(T), is the sum of the heights of the border strips in ''T''. The height of a border strip is one less than the number of \nrows it touches.\n\nIt follows from this theorem that the character values of a symmetric group are integers.\n\nFor some combinations of λ and ρ, there are no border-strip tableaux. In this case, there are no terms in the sum and therefore the character value is zero.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider the calculation of one of the character values for the symmetric group of order 8, when λ is the partition (5,2,1) and ρ is the partition (3,3,1,1). The shape partition λ specifies that the tableau must have three rows, the first having 5 boxes, the second having 2 boxes, and the third having 1 box. The type partition ρ specifies that the tableau must be filled with three 1's, three 2's, one 3, and one 4. There are six such border-strip tableaux:\n\n[[File:MurnaghanNakayama2.svg|frameless|none|600px|Example of the border-strip tableaux involved in computing a particular symmetric group character value using the non-recursive Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.]]\n\nIf we call these <math>T_1</math>, <math>T_2</math>, <math>T_3</math>, <math>T_4</math>, <math>T_5</math>, and <math>T_6</math>, then their heights are\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nht(T_1)=0+1+0+0=1\\\\\nht(T_2)=1+0+0+0=1\\\\\nht(T_3)=1+0+0+0=1\\\\\nht(T_4)=2+0+0+0=2\\\\\nht(T_5)=2+0+0+0=2\\\\\nht(T_6)=2+1+0+0=3\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nand the character value is therefore\n\n<math>\n\\chi^{(5,2,1)}_{(3,3,1,1)}=(-1)^1+(-1)^1+(-1)^1+(-1)^2+(-1)^2+(-1)^3=-1-1-1+1+1-1=-2\n</math>\n\n==Recursive version==\n\n'''Theorem:''' \n:<math>\\chi^{\\lambda}_{\\rho} = \\sum_{\\xi \\in BS(\\lambda,\\rho_1)} (-1)^{ht(\\xi)} \\chi^{\\lambda\\backslash\\xi}_{\\rho\\backslash\\rho_1} </math>\nwhere the sum is taken over the set BS(λ,ρ<sub>1</sub>) of border strips within the Young diagram of shape λ that have ρ<sub>1</sub> boxes and whose removal leaves a valid Young diagram. The notation <math>\\lambda\\backslash\\xi</math> represents the partition that results from removing the border strip ξ from λ. The notation <math>\\rho\\backslash\\rho_1</math> represents the partition that results from removing the first element ρ<sub>1</sub> from ρ.\n\nNote that the right-hand side is a sum of characters for symmetric groups that have smaller order than that of the symmetric group we started with on the left-hand side. In other words, this version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule expresses a character of the symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> in terms of the characters of smaller symmetric groups S<sub>k</sub> with ''k''<''n''.\n\nApplying this rule recursively will result in a tree of character value evaluations for smaller and smaller partitions. Each branch stops for one of two reasons: Either there are no border strips of the required length within the reduced shape, so the sum on the right is zero, or a border strip occupying the entire reduced shape is removed, leaving a Young diagram with no boxes. At this point we are evaluating &chi;{{su|p=&lambda;|b=&rho;}} when both λ and ρ are the empty partition (), and the rule requires that this terminal case be defined as having character <math>\\chi^{()}_{()} = 1</math>.\n\nThis recursive version of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule is especially efficient for computer calculation when one computes character tables for S<sub>k</sub> for increasing values of ''k'' and stores all of the previously computed character tables.\n\n==Example==\n\nWe will again compute the character value with λ=(5,2,1) and ρ=(3,3,1,1).\n\nTo begin, consider the Young diagram with shape λ. Since the first part of ρ is 3, look for border strips that consist of 3 boxes. There are two possibilities:\n\n[[File:MurnaghanNakayama3.svg|frameless|none|200px|Example of the border-strip tableaux involved in computing a particular symmetric group character value using the recursive Murnaghan-Nakayama rule.]]\n\nIn the first diagram, the border strip has height 0, and removing it produces the reduced shape (2,2,1). In the second diagram, the border strip has height 1, and removing it produces the reduced shape (5). Therefore, one has\n\n<math>\\chi^{(5,2,1)}_{(3,3,1,1)}=\\chi^{(2,2,1)}_{(3,1,1)}-\\chi^{(5)}_{(3,1,1)}</math>,\n\nexpressing a character value of S<sub>8</sub> in terms of two character values of S<sub>5</sub>.\n\nApplying the rule again to both terms, one finds\n\n<math>\\chi^{(2,2,1)}_{(3,1,1)}=-\\chi^{(2)}_{(1,1)}</math>\n\nand\n\n<math>\\chi^{(5)}_{(3,1,1)}=\\chi^{(2)}_{(1,1)}</math>,\n\nreducing to a character value of S<sub>2</sub>.\n\nApplying again, one finds\n\n<math>\\chi^{(2)}_{(1,1)}=\\chi^{(1)}_{(1)}</math>,\n\nreducing to the only character value of S<sub>1</sub>.\n\nA final application produces the terminal character <math>\\chi^{()}_{()} = 1</math>:\n\n<math>\\chi^{(1)}_{(1)}=\\chi^{()}_{()}=1</math>\n\nWorking backwards from this known character, the result is <math>\\chi^{(5,2,1)}_{(3,3,1,1)}=-2</math>, as before.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Murnaghan-Nakayama rule}}\n[[Category:Combinatorics]]\n[[Category:Representation theory of finite groups]]\n[[Category:Symmetry]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], especially in the area of [[abstract algebra]] known as [[module theory]], a '''principal indecomposable module''' has many important relations to the study of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]'s [[module (mathematics)|modules]], especially its [[simple module]]s, [[projective module]]s, and [[indecomposable module]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA (left) '''principal indecomposable module''' of a ring ''R'' is a (left) [[submodule]] of ''R'' that is a [[direct summand]] of ''R'' and is an [[indecomposable module]].  Alternatively, it is an indecomposable, projective, [[cyclic module]].  Principal indecomposable modules are also called '''PIM'''s for short.\n\n== Relations ==\n\nThe projective indecomposable modules over some rings have very close connections with those rings' simple, projective, and indecomposable modules.\n\nIf the ring ''R'' is [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] or even [[semiperfect ring|semiperfect]], then ''R'' is a direct sum of principal indecomposable modules, and there is one isomorphism class of PIM per isomorphism class of simple module.  To each PIM ''P'' is associated its '''head''', ''P''/''JP'', which is a simple module, being an indecomposable semi-simple module.  To each simple module ''S'' is associated its [[projective cover]] ''P'', which is a PIM, being an indecomposable, projective, cyclic module.\n\nSimilarly over a [[semiperfect ring]], every indecomposable projective module is a PIM, and every finitely generated projective module is a direct sum of PIMs.\n\nIn the context of [[group algebra]]s of [[finite group]]s over [[field (mathematics)|fields]] (which are semiperfect rings), the [[representation ring]] describes the indecomposable modules, and the [[modular representation theory|modular characters]] of simple modules represent both a subring and a quotient ring.  The representation ring over the complex field is usually better understood and since PIMs correspond to modules over the complexes using ''p''-modular system, one can use PIMs to transfer information from the complex representation ring to the representation ring over a field of positive characteristic.  Roughly speaking this is called block theory.\n\nOver a [[Dedekind domain]] that is not a [[principal ideal domain|PID]], the [[ideal class group]] measures the difference between projective indecomposable modules and principal indecomposable modules: the projective indecomposable modules are exactly the (modules isomorphic to) nonzero ideals and the principal indecomposable modules are precisely the (modules isomorphic to) nonzero principal ideals.\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | last1=Alperin | first1=J.

      "title": "Representation theory of the symmetric group",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_symmetric_group",
      "text": "{{more footnotes|date=April 2014}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''representation theory of the symmetric group''' is a particular case of the [[representation theory of finite groups]], for which a concrete and detailed theory can be obtained. This has a large area of potential applications, from [[symmetric function]] theory to problems of [[quantum mechanics]] for a number of [[identical particles]].\n\nThe [[symmetric group]] S<sub>''n''</sub> has order ''n''!. Its [[conjugacy class]]es are labeled by [[integer partition|partition]]s of ''n''. Therefore according to the representation theory of a finite group, the number of inequivalent [[irreducible representation]]s, over the [[complex number]]s, is equal to the number of partitions of ''n''. Unlike the general situation for finite groups, there is in fact a natural way to parametrize irreducible representations by the same set that parametrizes conjugacy classes, namely by partitions of ''n'' or equivalently [[Young diagram]]s of size ''n''.\n\nEach such irreducible representation can in fact be realized over the integers (every permutation acting by a matrix with integer coefficients); it can be explicitly constructed by computing the [[Young symmetrizer]]s acting on a space generated by the [[Young tableau]]x of shape given by the Young diagram.\n\nTo each irreducible representation ρ we can associate an irreducible character, χ<sup>ρ</sup>.\nTo compute χ<sup>ρ</sup>(π) where π is a permutation, one can use the combinatorial [[Murnaghan–Nakayama rule]]\n.<ref>Richard Stanley, ''Enumerative Combinatorics, Vol. 2''</ref> Note that χ<sup>ρ</sup> is constant on conjugacy classes,\nthat is, χ<sup>ρ</sup>(π) = χ<sup>ρ</sup>(σ<sup>−1</sup>πσ) for all permutations σ.\n\nOver other [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s the situation can become much more complicated.  If the field ''K'' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] equal to zero or greater than ''n'' then by [[Maschke's theorem]] the [[group algebra]] ''K''S<sub>''n''</sub> is semisimple. In these cases the irreducible representations defined over the integers give the complete set of irreducible representations (after reduction modulo the characteristic if necessary).\n\nHowever, the irreducible representations of the symmetric group are not known in arbitrary characteristic. In this context it is more usual to use the language of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s rather than representations. The representation obtained from an irreducible representation defined over the integers by reducing modulo the characteristic will not in general be irreducible. The modules so constructed are called ''[[Specht modules]]'', and every irreducible does arise inside some such module. There are now fewer irreducibles, and although they can be classified they are very poorly understood. For example, even their [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]]s are not known in general.\n\nThe determination of the irreducible modules for the symmetric group over an arbitrary field is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems in representation theory.\n\n== Low-dimensional representations ==\nThe lowest-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups can be described explicitly, as done in {{harv|Burnside|1955|p=468}}.  This work was extended to the smallest ''k'' degrees (explicitly for {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 4}}, and {{nowrap|1=''k'' = 7}}) in {{harv|Rasala|1977}}, and over arbitrary fields in {{harv|James|1983}}.  The smallest two degrees in characteristic zero are described here:\n\nEvery symmetric group has a one-dimensional representation called the '''trivial representation''', where every element acts as the one by one identity matrix.  For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, there is another irreducible representation of degree 1, called the '''sign representation''' or '''alternating character''', which takes a permutation to the one by one matrix with entry ±1 based on the [[sign of a permutation|sign of the permutation]].  These are the only one-dimensional representations of the symmetric groups, as one-dimensional representations are abelian, and the [[abelianization]] of the symmetric group is C<sub>2</sub>, the [[cyclic group]] of order 2.\n\nFor all ''n'', there is an ''n''-dimensional representation of the symmetric group of order ''n!'', called the '''{{visible anchor|natural permutation representation}}''', which consists of permuting ''n'' coordinates.  This has the trivial subrepresentation consisting of vectors whose coordinates are all equal.  The orthogonal complement consists of those vectors whose coordinates sum to zero, and when {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, the representation on this subspace is an {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional irreducible representation, called the '''standard representation'''.  Another {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional irreducible representation is found by tensoring with the sign representation.\n\nFor {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 7}}, these are the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations of S<sub>''n''</sub> – all other irreducible representations have dimension at least ''n''.  However for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, the surjection from S<sub>4</sub> to S<sub>3</sub> allows S<sub>4</sub> to inherit a two-dimensional irreducible representation.  For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, the exceptional transitive embedding of S<sub>5</sub> into S<sub>6</sub> produces another pair of five-dimensional irreducible representations.\n\n=== Alternating group ===\n[[File:Compound of five tetrahedra.png|thumb|The [[compound of five tetrahedra]], on which A<sub>5</sub> acts, giving a 3-dimensional representation.]]\nThe representation theory of the [[alternating group]]s is similar, though the sign representation disappears. For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 7}}, the lowest-dimensional irreducible representations are the trivial representation in dimension one, and the {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional representation from the other summand of the permutation representation, with all other irreducible representations having higher dimension, but there are exceptions for smaller ''n''.\n\nThe alternating groups for {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 5}} have only one one-dimensional irreducible representation, the trivial representation.  For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3, 4}} there are two additional one-dimensional irreducible representations, corresponding to maps to the cyclic group of order&nbsp;3: {{nowrap|A<sub>3</sub> ≅ C<sub>3</sub>}} and {{nowrap|A<sub>4</sub> → A<sub>4</sub>/''V'' ≅ C<sub>3</sub>}}.\n\n* For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 7}}, there is just one irreducible representation of degree {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}}, and this is the smallest degree of a non-trivial irreducible representation.\n* For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 3}} the obvious analogue of the {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional representation is reducible – the permutation representation coincides with the regular representation, and thus breaks up into the three one-dimensional representations, as {{nowrap|A<sub>3</sub> ≅ C<sub>3</sub>}} is abelian; see the [[discrete Fourier transform]] for representation theory of cyclic groups.\n* For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 4}}, there is just one {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} irreducible representation, but there are the exceptional irreducible representations of dimension&nbsp;1.\n* For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 5}}, there are two dual irreducible representations of dimension 3, corresponding to its action as [[icosahedral symmetry]].\n* For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 6}}, there is an extra irreducible representation of dimension 5 corresponding to the exceptional transitive embedding of ''A''<sub>5</sub> in&nbsp;''A''<sub>6</sub>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Alternating polynomials]]\n*[[Symmetric polynomials]]\n*[[Schur functor]]\n*[[Robinson–Schensted correspondence]]\n*[[Schur–Weyl duality]]\n*[[Jucys–Murphy element]]\n*[[Young tableau#Applications in representation theory|Young tableau]]\n*[[Frobenius formula]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Burnside | first1=William | author1-link=William Burnside | title=Theory of groups of finite order | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York |mr=0069818 | year=1955}}\n* {{Fulton-Harris}}, Lecture 4\n* {{Citation | last1=James | first1=Gordon | last2=Kerber | first2=Adalbert | title=The representation theory of the symmetric group | url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521104128 | publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., Reading, Mass. | series=Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications | isbn=978-0-201-13515-2 |mr=644144 | year=1981 | volume=16 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=James | first1=G.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson%E2%80%93Schensted_correspondence",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Robinson–Schensted correspondence''' is a [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence between [[permutation]]s and pairs of standard [[Young tableaux]] of the same shape. It has various descriptions, all of which are of algorithmic nature, it has many remarkable properties, and it has applications in [[combinatorics]] and other areas such as [[representation theory]]. The correspondence has been generalized in numerous ways, notably by Knuth to what is known as the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]], and  a further generalization to [[picture (mathematics)|picture]]s by Zelevinsky.\n\nThe simplest description of the correspondence is using the '''Schensted algorithm''' {{harvs|author=Craige Schensted| last=Schensted |year=1961}}, a procedure that constructs one tableau by successively inserting the values of the permutation according to a specific rule, while the other tableau records the evolution of the shape during construction. The correspondence had been described, in a rather different form, much earlier by Robinson {{harvs|authorlink=Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson| last=Robinson|year=1938}}, in an attempt to prove the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]]. The correspondence is often referred to as the '''Robinson–Schensted algorithm''', although the procedure used by Robinson is radically different from the Schensted–algorithm, and almost entirely forgotten. Other methods of defining the correspondence include a [[nondeterministic algorithm]] in terms of [[jeu de taquin]].\n\nThe bijective nature of the correspondence relates it to the [[enumerative combinatorics|enumerative]] identity:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\lambda\\in\\mathcal{P}_n} (t_\\lambda)^2= n!</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{P}_n</math> denotes the set of [[Partition (number theory)|partition]]s of {{mvar|n}} (or of [[Young diagram]]s with {{mvar|n}} squares), and {{math|''t<sub>λ</sub>''}} denotes the number of standard Young tableaux of shape {{mvar|λ}}.\n\n== The Schensted algorithm ==\nThe Schensted algorithm starts from the permutation {{mvar|σ}} written in two-line notation\n\n:<math>\\sigma=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3 & \\cdots & n\\\\ \\sigma_1 & \\sigma_2 & \\sigma_3 & \\cdots & \\sigma_n \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''σ<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} ''σ''(''i'')}}, and proceeds by constructing sequentially a sequence of (intermediate) ordered pairs of Young tableaux of the same shape:\n\n:<math>(P_0, Q_0), (P_1, Q_1), \\ldots, (P_n, Q_n),</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''P''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>0</sub>}} are empty tableaux. The output tableaux are {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''P<sub>n</sub>''}} and {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''Q<sub>n</sub>''}}. Once {{math|''P''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}} is constructed, one forms {{math|''P<sub>i</sub>''}} by ''inserting'' {{math|''σ<sub>i</sub>''}} into {{math|''P''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}}, and then {{math|''Q<sub>i</sub>''}} by adding an entry {{mvar|i}} to {{math|''Q''<sub>''i''−1</sub>}} in the square added to the shape by the insertion (so that {{math|''P<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''Q<sub>i</sub>''}} have equal shapes for all {{mvar|i}}). Because of the more passive role of the tableaux {{math|''Q<sub>i</sub>''}}, the final one {{math|''Q<sub>n</sub>''}}, which is part of the output and from which the previous {{math|''Q<sub>i</sub>''}} are easily read off, is called the '''recording tableau'''; by contrast the tableaux {{math|''P<sub>i</sub>''}} are called '''insertion tableaux'''.\n\n=== Insertion ===\n[[Image:Young-Schensted.png|thumb|right|180px|Insertion of (4):\n<br/>• (4) replaces (5) in the first row\n<br/>• (5) replaces (8) in the second row\n<br/>• (8) creates the third row]]\nThe basic procedure used to insert each {{math|''σ<sub>i</sub>''}} is called '''Schensted insertion''' or '''row-insertion''' (to distinguish it from a variant procedure called column-insertion). Its simplest form is defined in terms of \"incomplete standard tableaux\": like standard tableaux they have distinct entries, forming increasing rows and columns, but some values (still to be inserted) may be absent as entries. The procedure takes as arguments such a tableau {{mvar|T}} and a value {{mvar|x}} not present as entry of {{mvar|T}}; it produces as output a new tableau denoted {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}} and a square {{mvar|s}} by which its shape has grown. The value {{mvar|x}} appears in the first row of {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}}, either having been added at the end (if no entries larger than {{mvar|x}} were present), or otherwise replacing the first entry {{math|''y'' > ''x''}} in the first row of {{mvar|T}}. In the former case {{mvar|s}} is the square where {{mvar|x}} is added, and the insertion is completed; in the latter case the replaced entry {{mvar|y}} is similarly inserted into the second row of {{mvar|T}}, and so on, until at some step the first case applies (which certainly happens if an empty row of {{mvar|T}} is reached).\n\nMore formally, the following [[pseudocode]] describes the row-insertion of a new value {{mvar|x}} into {{mvar|T}}.<ref>Adapted from {{citation|author=D. E. Knuth|authorlink=Donald Ervin Knuth|title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]]|year=1973|volume=3|pages=50–51}}</ref>\n# Set {{math|''i'' {{=}} 1}} and {{mvar|j}} to one more than the length of the first row of {{mvar|T}}.\n# While {{math|''j'' > 1}} and {{math|''x'' < ''T''<sub>''i'', ''j''−1</sub>}}, decrease {{mvar|j}} by 1. (Now {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is the first square in row {{mvar|i}} with either an entry larger than {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|T}}, or no entry at all.)\n# If the square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is empty in {{mvar|T}}, terminate after adding {{mvar|x}} to {{mvar|T}} in square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} and setting {{math|''s'' {{=}} (''i'', ''j'')}}.\n# Swap the values {{mvar|x}} and {{math|''T<sub>i, j</sub>''}}. (This inserts the old {{mvar|x}} into row {{mvar|i}}, and saves the value it replaces for insertion into the next row.)\n# Increase {{mvar|i}} by 1 and return to step 2.\n\nThe shape of {{mvar|T}} grows by exactly one square, namely {{mvar|s}}.\n\n==== Correctness ====\nThe fact that {{math|''T'' ← ''x''}} has increasing rows and columns, if the same holds for {{mvar|T}}, is not obvious from this procedure (entries in the same column are never even compared). It can however be seen as follows. At all times except immediately after step&nbsp;4, the square {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} is either empty in {{mvar|T}} or holds a value greater than {{mvar|x}}; step&nbsp;5 re-establishes this property because {{math|(''i'', ''j'')}} now is the square immediately below the one that originally contained {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|T}}. Thus the effect of the replacement in step&nbsp;4 on the value {{math|''T<sub>i, j</sub>''}} is to make it smaller; in particular it cannot become greater than its right or lower neighbours. On the other hand the new value is not less than its left neighbour (if present) either, as is ensured by the comparison that just made step&nbsp;2 terminate. Finally to see that the new value is larger than its upper neighbour {{math|''T''<sub>''i''−1, ''j''</sub>}} if present, observe that {{math|''T''<sub>''i''−1, ''j''</sub>}} holds after step&nbsp;5, and that decreasing {{mvar|j}} in step&nbsp;2 only decreases the corresponding value {{math|''T''<sub>''i''−1, ''j''</sub>}}.\n\n=== Constructing the tableaux ===\nThe full Schensted algorithm applied to a permutation {{mvar|σ}} proceeds as follows.\n# Set both {{mvar|P}} and {{mvar|Q}} to the empty tableau\n# For {{mvar|i}} increasing from {{mvar|1}} to {{mvar|n}} compute {{math|''P'' ← ''σ''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and the square {{mvar|s}} by the insertion procedure; then replace {{mvar|P}} by {{math|''P'' ← ''σ''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and add the entry {{mvar|i}} to the tableau {{mvar|Q}} in the square {{mvar|s}}.\n# Terminate, returning the pair {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}}.\n\nThe algorithm produces a pair of standard Young tableaux.\n\n==== Invertibility of the construction ====\nIt can be seen that given any pair {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} of standard Young tableaux of the same shape, there is an inverse procedure that produces a permutation that will give rise to {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} by the Schensted algorithm. It essentially consists of tracing steps of the algorithm backwards, each time using an entry of {{mvar|Q}} to find the square where the inverse insertion should start, moving the corresponding entry of {{mvar|P}} to the preceding row, and continuing upwards through the rows until an entry of the first row is replaced, which is the value inserted at the corresponding step of the construction algorithm. These two inverse algorithms define a bijective correspondence between permutations of {{mvar|n}} on one side, and pairs of standard Young tableaux of equal shape and containing {{mvar|n}} squares on the other side.\n\n== Properties ==\nOne of the most fundamental properties, but not evident from the algorithmic construction, is symmetry:\n\n* If the Robinson–Schensted correspondence associates tableaux {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} to a permutation {{mvar|σ}}, then it associates {{math|(''Q'', ''P'')}} to the inverse permutation {{math|''σ''<sup>−1</sup>}}.\n\nThis can be proven, for instance, by appealing to [[Viennot's geometric construction]].\n\nFurther properties, all assuming that the correspondence associates tableaux {{math|(''P'', ''Q'')}} to the permutation {{math|''σ'' {{=}} (''σ''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}.\n\n* In the pair of tableaux {{math|(''P''′, ''Q''′)}} associated to the reversed permutation {{math|(''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>, ..., ''σ''<sub>1</sub>)}}, the tableau {{math|''P''′}} is the transpose of the tableau {{mvar|P}}, and {{math|''Q''′}} is a tableau determined by {{mvar|Q}}, independently of {{mvar|P}} (namely the transpose of the tableau obtained from {{mvar|Q}} by the [[Schützenberger involution]]).\n* The length of the [[longest increasing subsequence]] of {{math|''σ''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is equal to the length of the first row of {{mvar|P}} (and of {{mvar|Q}}).\n* The length of the longest decreasing subsequence of {{math|''σ''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''σ''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is equal to the length of the first column of {{mvar|P}} (and of {{mvar|Q}}), as follows from the previous two properties.\n* The descent set {{math|{''i'' : ''σ<sub>i</sub>'' > ''σ''<sub>''i''+1</sub>}}} of {{mvar|σ}} equals the descent set {{math|{''i'' : ''i''+1 is in a row strictly below the row of ''i''}}} of {{mvar|Q}}.\n* Identify subsequences of {{mvar|π}} with their sets of indices. It is a theorem of Greene that for any {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}, the size of the largest set that can be written as the union of at most {{mvar|k}} increasing subsequences is {{math|''λ''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''λ<sub>k</sub>''}}. In particular, {{math|''λ''<sub>1</sub>}} equals the largest length of an increasing subsequence of {{mvar|π}}.\n* If {{mvar|σ}} is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]], then the number of fixed points of {{mvar|σ}} equals the number of columns of odd length in {{mvar|λ}}.\n<!-- list to be completed -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Viennot's geometric construction]], which provides a diagrammatic interpretation of the correspondence.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Fulton | first1=William | authorlink=William Fulton (mathematician) | title=Young Tableaux | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=London Mathematical Society Student Texts | isbn=978-0-521-56144-0 | mr = 1464693 | year=1997 | volume=35}}.\n*{{Citation | last1=Knuth | first1=Donald E. | authorlink=Donald Knuth | title=Permutations, matrices, and generalized Young tableaux | url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.pjm/1102971948 | mr = 0272654 | year=1970 | journal=[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]] | volume=34 | pages=709–727 | doi=10.2140/pjm.1970.34.709}}\n*{{Citation | doi=10.2307/2371609 | last1=Robinson | first1=G. de B. | authorlink=Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson | title=On the Representations of the Symmetric Group | year=1938 | journal=[[American Journal of Mathematics]]  | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=745–760 | jstor=2371609|zbl=0019.25102}}.\n*{{citation|first=B.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Schur polynomials''', named after [[Issai Schur]], are certain [[symmetric polynomial]]s in ''n'' variables, indexed by [[integer partition|partition]]s, that generalize the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s and the [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s.  In [[representation theory]]  they are the characters of polynomial [[irreducible representation]]s of the [[general linear group]]s. The Schur polynomials form a [[basis (linear algebra)|linear basis]] for the space of all symmetric polynomials.  Any product of Schur functions can be written as a linear combination of Schur polynomials with non-negative integral coefficients; the values of these coefficients is given combinatorially by the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]]. More generally, '''skew Schur polynomials'''  are associated with pairs of partitions and have similar properties to Schur polynomials.\n\n==Definition (Jacobi's bialternant formula) ==\n\nSchur polynomials are indexed by [[integer partition]]s.  Given a partition {{math|''λ'' {{=}} (''λ''<sub>1</sub>, ''λ''<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;,''λ''<sub>''n''</sub>)}},\nwhere {{math|''λ''<sub>1</sub> ≥ ''λ''<sub>2</sub>≥ &hellip; ≥ ''λ''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, and each {{math|''λ''<sub>''j''</sub>}} is a non-negative integer, the functions\n\n:<math> a_{(\\lambda_1+n-1, \\lambda_2+n-2, \\dots , \\lambda_n)} (x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) =\n\\det \\left[ \\begin{matrix} x_1^{\\lambda_1+n-1} & x_2^{\\lambda_1+n-1} & \\dots & x_n^{\\lambda_1+n-1} \\\\\nx_1^{\\lambda_2+n-2} & x_2^{\\lambda_2+n-2} & \\dots & x_n^{\\lambda_2+n-2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nx_1^{\\lambda_n} & x_2^{\\lambda_n} & \\dots & x_n^{\\lambda_n} \\end{matrix} \\right]\n</math>\n\nare [[alternating polynomials]] by properties of the [[determinant]]. A polynomial is alternating if it changes sign under any [[transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] of the variables.\n\nSince they are alternating, they are all divisible by the [[Vandermonde determinant]],\n\n:<math> a_{(n-1, n-2, \\dots , 0)} (x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) = \\det \\left[ \\begin{matrix} x_1^{n-1} & x_2^{n-1} & \\dots & x_n^{n-1} \\\\\nx_1^{n-2} & x_2^{n-2} & \\dots & x_n^{n-2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n1 & 1 & \\dots & 1 \\end{matrix} \\right] = \\prod_{1 \\leq j < k \\leq n} (x_j-x_k). </math>\nThe Schur polynomials are defined as the ratio\n:<math>\n s_{\\lambda} (x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) =\n\\frac{ a_{(\\lambda_1+n-1, \\lambda_2+n-2, \\dots , \\lambda_n+0)} (x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n)}\n{a_{(n-1, n-2, \\dots , 0)} (x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_n) }. </math>\nwhich is known as the '''bialternant formula''' of Jacobi. It is a special case of the [[Weyl character formula]].\n\nThis is a symmetric function because the numerator and denominator are both alternating, and a polynomial since all alternating polynomials are divisible by the Vandermonde determinant.\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe degree {{math|''d''}} Schur polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables are a linear basis for the space of homogeneous degree {{math|''d''}} symmetric polynomials in {{math|''n''}} variables. \nFor a partition {{math|''λ'' {{=}} (''λ''<sub>1</sub>, ''λ''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''λ''<sub>''n''</sub>)}}, the Schur polynomial is a sum of monomials,\n:<math> s_\\lambda(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)=\\sum_T x^T = \\sum_T x_1^{t_1}\\cdots x_n^{t_n} </math>\n\nwhere the summation is over all semistandard [[Young tableau]]x {{math|''T''}} of shape {{math|''λ''}}. The exponents {{math|''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>}} give the weight of {{math|''T''}}, in other words each {{math|''t''<sub>''i''</sub>}} counts the occurrences of the number {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''T''}}. This can be shown to be equivalent to the definition from the '''first Giambelli formula''' using the [[Lindström–Gessel–Viennot lemma]] (as outlined on that page).\n\nSchur polynomials can be expressed as linear combinations of [[Symmetric polynomial#Monomial symmetric polynomials|monomial symmetric functions]] {{math|''m''<sub>μ</sub>}} with non-negative integer coefficients {{math|''K''<sub>''λμ''</sub>}} called [[Kostka number]]s,\n\n: <math>s_\\lambda= \\sum_\\mu K_{\\lambda\\mu}m_\\mu.\\ </math>\n\nThe Kostka numbers {{math|''K''<sub>''λμ''</sub>}} are given by the number of semi-standard Young tableaux of shape ''λ'' and weight ''μ''.\n\n===Jacobi−Trudi identities===\n\nThe '''first Jacobi−Trudi formula''' expresses the Schur polynomial as a determinant\nin terms of the [[complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial]]s,\n\n:<math> s_{\\lambda} = \\det(h_{\\lambda_{i} + j - i})_{i,j = 1}^{l(\\lambda)} = \n\\det\\left[ \\begin{matrix} h_{\\lambda_1} & h_{\\lambda_1 + 1} & \\dots & h_{\\lambda_1 + n - 1} \\\\\nh_{\\lambda_2-1} & h_{\\lambda_2} & \\dots & h_{\\lambda_2+n-2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\nh_{\\lambda_n-n+1} & h_{\\lambda_n-n+2} & \\dots & h_{\\lambda_n} \\end{matrix} \\right],</math><ref>Formula A.5 in {{Fulton-Harris}}</ref>\nwhere {{math|''h''<sub>''i''</sub> :{{=}} ''s''<sub>(''i'')</sub>}}.\n \nThe '''second Jacobi-Trudi formula''' expresses the Schur polynomial as \na determinant in terms of the [[elementary symmetric polynomial]]s,\n\n:<math> s_{\\lambda} = \\det(e_{\\lambda'_{i} + j - i})_{i,j = 1}^{l(\\lambda')} = \n\\det\\left[ \\begin{matrix} e_{\\lambda'_1} & e_{\\lambda'_1 + 1} & \\dots & e_{\\lambda'_1 + l - 1} \\\\\ne_{\\lambda'_2-1} & e_{\\lambda'_2} & \\dots & e_{\\lambda'_2+ l-2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\ne_{\\lambda'_l-l+1} & e_{\\lambda'_l-l+2} & \\dots & e_{\\lambda'_l} \\end{matrix} \\right],</math><ref>Formula A.6 in {{Fulton-Harris}}</ref>\nwhere {{math|''e''<sub>''i''</sub> :{{=}} ''s''<sub>(''1''<sup>''i''</sup>)</sub>}}.\nand {{math|''λ<nowiki>'</nowiki>''}} is the conjugate partition to {{math|''λ''}}.\n\nThese two formulae are known as ''determinantal identities''.\n\n===The Giambelli identity===\n\nAnother determinantal identity is [[Giambelli's formula]], which expresses the Schur function for an arbitrary partition in terms of those for the ''hook partitions'' contained within the Young diagram. In Frobenius' notation, the partition is denoted \n:<math> (a_{1}, ... a_{r}| b_{1}, ... b_{r})</math>\n\nwhere, for each diagonal element in position {{math|''ii''}}, {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} denotes the number of boxes to the right in the same row and {{math|''b''<sub>''i''</sub>}} denotes the number of boxes beneath it in the same column (the ''arm'' and ''leg'' lengths, respectively).\n\nThe '''Giambelli identity''' expresses the Schur function corresponding to this partition as the determinant\n:<math> s_{ (a_{1}, ... a_{r}| b_{1}, ... b_{r})} = \\det ( s_{(a_{i} | b_{j})}) </math>\nof those for hook partitions.\n\n===The Cauchy identity===\n\nThe Cauchy identity for Schur functions (now in infinitely many variables), and its dual state that\n:<math>\\sum_\\lambda s_\\lambda(x) s_{\\lambda}(y) = \\sum_\\lambda m_\\lambda(x) h_{\\lambda}(y)= \\prod_{i,j} (1-x_i y_j)^{-1},</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sum_\\lambda s_\\lambda(x) s_{\\lambda'}(y) = \\sum_\\lambda m_\\lambda(x) e_{\\lambda}(y) = \\prod_{i,j} (1+x_i y_j),</math>\nwhere the sum is taken over all partitions ''λ'', and <math>h_{\\lambda}(x)</math>, <math>e_{\\lambda}(x)</math> denote the ''complete symmetric functions'' and ''elementary symmetric functions'', respectively. If the sum is taken over products of Schur polynomials in <math>n</math> variables <math>(x_1, \\dots, x_n)</math>, the sum becomes finite, since  only partitions of length <math> \\ell(\\lambda) \\le n </math> give Schur polynomials that are nonvanishing.\n\nThere are many generalizations of these identities to other families of symmetric functions. \nFor example, Macdonald polynomials, Schubert polynomials and Grothendieck polynomials admit Cauchy-like identities.\n\n===Further identities===\n\nThe Schur polynomial can also be computed via a specialization of a formula for [[Hall–Littlewood polynomials]],\n\n:<math> s_{\\lambda}(x_1,\\dotsc,x_n) = \\sum_{w \\in S_n / S^{\\lambda}_n} w\\left(  x^\\lambda  \\prod_{\\lambda_i > \\lambda_j}\n\\frac{x_i}{x_i-x_j} \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>S^{\\lambda}_n</math> is the subgroup of permutations such that <math>\\lambda_{w(i)}=\\lambda_i</math>\nfor all ''i'', and ''w'' acts on variables by permuting indices.\n\n===The Murnaghan−Nakayama rule===\n\nThe [[Murnaghan–Nakayama rule]] expresses a product of a power-sum symmetric function with a Schur polynomial, in terms of Schur polynomials:\n\n:<math>p_r \\cdot s_\\lambda  = \\sum_{\\mu} (-1)^{ht(\\mu/\\lambda)+1}s_\\mu</math>\n\nwhere the sum is over all partitions ''μ'' such that ''μ/λ'' is a rim-hook of size ''r'' and ''ht(μ/λ)'' is the number of rows in the diagram ''μ/λ''.\n\n===The Littlewood-Richardson rule and Pieri's formula===\n\nThe [[Littlewood–Richardson rule|Littlewood–Richardson coefficients]] depend on three [[integer partition|partition]]s, say <math>\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu</math>, of which <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> describe the Schur functions being multiplied, and <math>\\nu</math> gives the Schur function of which this is the coefficient in the linear combination; in other words they are the coefficients <math>c_{\\lambda,\\mu}^\\nu</math> such that\n:<math>s_\\lambda s_\\mu=\\sum_\\nu c_{\\lambda,\\mu}^\\nu s_\\nu.</math>\nThe Littlewood–Richardson rule states that <math>c_{\\lambda,\\mu}^\\nu</math> is equal to the number of Littlewood–Richardson tableaux of [[Skew tableau|skew shape]] <math>\\nu/\\lambda</math> and of weight <math>\\mu</math>.\n\n[[Pieri's formula]] is a special case of the Littlewood-Richardson rule, which expresses the product <math>h_r s_{\\lambda}</math> in terms of Schur polynomials. The dual version expresses  <math>e_r s_{\\lambda}</math> in terms of Schur polynomials.\n\n===Specializations===\n\nEvaluating the Schur polynomial {{math|''s''<sub>λ</sub>}} in {{math|(1,1,...,1)}} gives the number of semi-standard Young tableaux of shape {{math|''λ''}} with entries in {{math|1, 2, ..., ''n''}}. \nOne can show, by using the [[Weyl character formula]] for example, that\n\n: <math>s_\\lambda(1,1,\\dots,1) = \\prod_{1\\leq i < j \\leq n} \\frac{\\lambda_i - \\lambda_j + j-i}{j-i}.</math>\n\nIn this formula, {{math|''λ''}}, the tuple indicating the width of each row of the Young diagram, is implicitly extended with zeros until it has length {{math|''n''}}.  The sum of the elements {{math|''λ''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is {{math|''d''}}.\nSee also the [[Hook length formula]] which computes the same quantity for fixed λ.\n\n==Example==\nThe following extended example should help clarify these ideas.  Consider the case ''n'' = 3, ''d'' = 4.  Using Ferrers diagrams or some other method, we find that there are just four partitions of 4 into at most three parts.  We have\n\n:<math> s_{(2,1,1)} (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\;\n\\det \\left[ \\begin{matrix} x_1^4 & x_2^4 & x_3^4 \\\\ x_1^2 & x_2^2 & x_3^2 \\\\ x_1 & x_2 & x_3 \\end{matrix}\n\\right] = x_1 \\, x_2 \\, x_3 \\, (x_1 + x_2 + x_3) </math>\n\n:<math> s_{(2,2,0)} (x_1, x_2, x_3) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\;\n\\det \\left[ \\begin{matrix} x_1^4 & x_2^4 & x_3^4 \\\\ x_1^3 & x_2^3 & x_3^3 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\end{matrix}\n\\right]= x_1^2 \\, x_2^2 + x_1^2 \\, x_3^2 + x_2^2 \\, x_3^2 \n+ x_1^2 \\, x_2 \\, x_3 + x_1 \\, x_2^2 \\, x_3 + x_1 \\, x_2 \\, x_3^2 </math>\n\nand so on.  Summarizing:\n\n#<math> s_{(2,1,1)} = e_1 \\, e_3</math>\n#<math> s_{(2,2,0)} = e_2^2 - e_1 \\, e_3</math>\n#<math> s_{(3,1,0)} = e_1^2 \\, e_2 - e_2^2 - e_1 \\, e_3</math>\n#<math> s_{(4,0,0)} = e_1^4 - 3 \\, e_1^2 \\, e_2 + 2 \\, e_1 \\, e_3 + e_2^2.</math>\n\nEvery homogeneous degree-four symmetric polynomial in three variables can be expressed as a unique ''linear combination'' of these four Schur polynomials, and this combination can again be found using a [[Gröbner basis]] for an appropriate elimination order.  For example,\n\n:<math>\\phi(x_1, x_2, x_3) = x_1^4 + x_2^4 + x_3^4</math>\n\nis obviously a symmetric polynomial which is homogeneous of degree four, and we have\n\n:<math>\\phi = s_{(2,1,1)} - s_{(3,1,0)} + s_{(4,0,0)}.\\,\\!</math>\n\n==Relation to representation theory==\n\nThe Schur polynomials occur in the [[representation theory of the symmetric group]]s, [[general linear group]]s, and [[unitary group]]s.  The [[Weyl character formula]] implies that the Schur polynomials are the characters of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the general linear groups, and helps to generalize Schur's work to other compact and semisimple [[Lie group]]s.\n\nSeveral expressions arise for this relation, one of the most important being the expansion of the Schur functions ''s''<sub>&lambda;</sub> in terms of the symmetric power functions <math>p_k=\\sum_i x_i^k</math>. If we write &chi;{{su|p=&lambda;|b=&rho;}} for the character of the representation of the symmetric group indexed by the partition &lambda; evaluated at elements of cycle type indexed by the partition &rho;, then \n:<math>s_\\lambda = \\sum_{\\nu} \\frac{\\chi^\\lambda_\\nu}{z_\\nu} p_\\nu = \\sum_{\\rho=(1^{r_1},2^{r_2},3^{r_3},\\dots)}\\chi^\\lambda_\\rho \\prod_k \\frac{p^{r_k}_k}{r_k! k^{r_k} },</math>\nwhere &rho; = (1<sup>''r''<sub>1</sub></sup>, 2<sup>''r''<sub>2</sub></sup>, 3<sup>''r''<sub>3</sub></sup>, ...) means that the partition &rho; has ''r''<sub>''k''</sub> parts of length ''k''.\n\nA proof of this can be found in R. Stanley's Enumerative Combinatorics Volume 2, Corollary 7.17.5.\n\nThe integers &chi;{{su|p=&lambda;|b=&rho;}} can be computed using the [[Murnaghan–Nakayama rule]].\n\n==Schur positivity==\n\nDue to the connection with representation theory, a symmetric function which expands positively in Schur functions are of \nparticular interest. For example, the skew Schur functions expand positively in the ordinary Schur functions,\nand the coefficients are Littlewood–Richardson coefficients.\n\nA special case of this is the expansion of the complete homogeneous symmetric functions ''h''<sub>λ</sub> in Schur functions.\nThis decomposition reflects how a permutation module is decomposed into irreducible representations.\n\n===Methods for proving Schur positivity===\n\nThere are several approaches to prove Schur positivity of a given symmetric function ''F''.\nIf ''F'' is described in a combinatorial manner, a direct approach is to produce a bijection with semi-standard Young tableaux.\nThe Edelman–Green correspondence and the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]] are examples of such bijections.\n\nA bijection with more structure is a proof using so called [[Crystal_base|crystals]]. This method can be described as defining a certain graph structure described with local rules on the underlying combinatorial objects.\n\nA similar idea is the notion of dual equivalence. This approach also uses a graph structure, but on the objects representing the expansion in the fundamental quasisymmetric basis. It is closely related to the RSK-correspondence.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Skew Schur functions===\n\nSkew Schur functions ''s''<sub>&lambda;/&mu;</sub> depend on two partitions &lambda; and &mu;, and can be defined by the property\n:<math>\\langle s_{\\lambda/\\mu},s_\\nu\\rangle = \\langle s_{\\lambda},s_\\mu  s_\\nu\\rangle. </math>\nHere, the inner product is the Hall inner product, for which the Schur polynomials form an orthonormal basis.\n\nSimilar to the ordinary Schur polynomials, there are numerous ways to compute these. The corresponding Jacobi-Trudi identities are\n:<math>s_{\\lambda/\\mu} = \\det(h_{\\lambda_i - \\mu_j -i + j})_{i,j = 1}^{l(\\lambda)}</math>\n:<math>s_{\\lambda'/\\mu'} = \\det(e_{\\lambda_i - \\mu_j -i + j})_{i,j = 1}^{l(\\lambda)}</math>\n\nThere is also a combinatorial interpretation of the skew Schur polynomials,\nnamely it is a sum over all semi-standard Young tableaux (or column-strict tableaux) of the skew shape <math>\\lambda/\\mu</math>.\n\nThe skew Schur polynomials expands positively in Schur polynomials. A rule for the coefficients is \ngiven by the [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]].\n\n=== Double Schur polynomials ===\n\nThe double Schur polynomials<ref name=\"Molev2008.02\">{{cite journal|last1=Molev|first1=A.I.|title=Littlewood–Richardson polynomials|journal=Journal of Algebra|date=June 2009|volume=321|issue=11|pages=3450–3468|doi=10.1016/j.jalgebra.2008.02.034|arxiv=0704.0065}}</ref> can be seen as a generalization of the shifted Schur polynomials. \nThese polynomials are also closely related to the factorial Schur polynomials.\nGiven a partition {{math|''λ''}}, and a sequence {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,&hellip;}}\none can define the double Schur polynomial {{math|''s''<sub>λ</sub>(''x'' {{!}}{{!}} ''a'')}} as\n\n:<math>s_\\lambda(x||a) = \\sum_T \\prod_{\\alpha \\in \\lambda}(x_{T(\\alpha)} - a_{T(\\alpha)-c(\\alpha)})</math>\nwhere the sum is taken over all ''reverse'' semi-standard Young tableaux {{math|''T''}} of shape {{math|''λ''}}, and integer entries\nin {{math|1,&hellip;,''n''}}.

If ''V'' is a linear representation of a group ''G'', then with the above linear action, the [[tensor algebra]] <math>T(V)</math> is an [[algebraic representation]] of ''G''; i.e., each element of ''G'' acts as an [[algebra automorphism]].\n\n===Lie algebra representations===\nIf <math>(V_1,\\pi_1)</math> and <math>(V_2,\\pi_2)</math> are representations of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, then the tensor product of these representations is given by the map <math>\\pi_1\\otimes\\pi_2:\\mathfrak g\\rightarrow\\operatorname{End}(V_1\\otimes V_2)</math> given by<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Definition 4.19</ref>\n:<math>\\pi_1\\otimes\\pi_2(X)=\\pi_1(X)\\otimes I+I\\otimes\\pi_2(X)</math>.\nThe motivation for this definition comes from the case in which <math>\\pi_1</math> and <math>\\pi_2</math> come from representations <math>\\Pi_1</math> and <math>\\Pi_2</math> of a Lie group <math>G</math>. In that case, a simple computation shows that the Lie algebra representation associated to <math>\\Pi_1\\otimes\\Pi_2</math> is given by the preceding formula.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 4.18</ref>\n\n== Action on linear maps ==\nIf <math>(V_1,\\Pi_1)</math> and <math>(V_2,\\Pi_2)</math> are representations of a group <math>G</math>, let <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V_1,V_2)</math> denote the space of all linear maps from <math>V_1</math> to <math>V_2</math>.

Now, there is a [[Tensor_product#Tensor_product_vs._Hom|natural isomorphism]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)\\cong V^* \\otimes W</math>\nas vector spaces;{{sfn|Fulton|Harris|1991|p=4}} this vector space isomorphism is in fact an isomorphism of representations.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} pp. 433–434</ref>\n\nThe [[trivial subrepresentation]] <math>\\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G</math> consists of [[equivariant map|''G''-linear maps]]; i.e.,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Hom}_G(V, W) = \\operatorname{Hom}(V, W)^G.</math>\n\nLet <math>E = \\operatorname{End}(V)</math> denote the endomorphism algebra of ''V'' and let ''A'' denote the subalgebra of <math>E^{\\otimes m}</math> consisting of symmetric tensors. The main theorem of invariant theory states that ''A'' is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] when the characteristic of the base field is zero.\n\n==Clebsch–Gordan theory==\n===The general problem===\nThe tensor product of two irreducible representations <math>V_1,V_2</math> of a group or Lie algebra is usually not irreducible. It is therefore of interest to attempt to decompose <math>V_1\\otimes V_2</math> into irreducible pieces. This decomposition problem is known as the Clebsch–Gordan problem.\n\n===The SU(2) case===\nThe [[Clebsch–Gordan_coefficients|prototype example]] of this problem is the case of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]—or its double cover, the [[Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(2)|special unitary group SU(2)]]. The irreducible representations of SU(2) are described by a parameter <math>\\ell</math>, whose possible values are\n:<math>\\ell=0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, \\ldots.</math>\n(The dimension of the representation is then <math>2\\ell+1</math>.) Let us take two parameters <math>\\ell</math> and <math>m</math> with <math>\\ell\\geq m</math>. Then the tensor product representation <math>V_\\ell\\otimes V_m</math> then decomposes as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem C.1</ref>\n:<math>V_\\ell\\otimes V_m\\cong V_{\\ell+m}\\oplus V_{\\ell+m-1}\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus V_{\\ell-m+1}\\oplus V_{\\ell-m}.</math>\nConsider, as an example, the tensor product of the four-dimensional representation <math>V_{3/2}</math> and the three-dimensional representation <math>V_1</math>. The tensor product representation <math>V_{3/2}\\otimes V_1</math> has dimension 12 and decomposes as\n:<math>V_{3/2}\\otimes V_1\\cong V_{5/2}\\oplus V_{3/2}\\oplus V_{1/2}</math>,\nwhere the representations on the right-hand side have dimension 6, 4, and 2, respectively. We may summarize this result arithmetically as <math>4\\times 3= 6+4+2</math>.\n\n===The SU(3) case===\n{{main|Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)}}\nIn the case of the group SU(3), all the [[Lie_algebra_representation#The_case_of_sl(3,C)|irreducible representations]] can be generated from the standard 3-dimensional representation and its dual, as follows. To generate the representation with label <math>(m_1,m_2)</math>, one takes the tensor product of <math>m_1</math> copies of the standard representation and <math>m_2</math> copies of the dual of the standard representation, and then takes the invariant subspace generated by the tensor product of the highest weight vectors.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proof of Proposition 6.17</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the situation for SU(2), in the Clebsch–Gordan decomposition for SU(3), a given irreducible representation <math>W</math> may occur more than once in the decomposition of <math>U\\otimes V</math>.\n\n== Tensor power ==\n\nAs with vector spaces, one can define the '''{{var|k}}<sup>th</sup> [[tensor power]] of a representation''' {{var|V}} to be the vector space <math>V^{\\otimes k}</math> with the action given above.\n\n=== The symmetric and alternating square ===\n\nOver a field of characteristic zero, the symmetric and alternating squares are [[subrepresentation]]s of the second tensor power. They can be used to define the [[Frobenius–Schur indicator]], which indicates whether a given [[irreducible character]] is [[Real representation|real]], [[Complex representation|complex]], or [[Quaternionic representation|quaternionic]]. They are examples of [[Schur functor]]s.\nThey are defined as follows.\n\nOne can define a linear transformation on any vector space with a basis by defining its action on basis elements and extending linearly. Let {{var|V}} be a [[vector space]] with [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] <math>\\{v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n\\}</math>. The tensor product <math>V\\otimes V</math> has a basis <math>\\{v_i\\otimes v_j\\mid i,j\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\}</math>. Define an [[endomorphism]] (self-map) {{var|T}} of <math>V\\otimes V</math> as follows:\n:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\n  T:V\\otimes V &\\longrightarrow V\\otimes V \\\\\n  v_i\\otimes v_j &\\longmapsto v_j\\otimes v_i\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis transformation is independent of the chosen basis. It is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (it is its own inverse), and so is an [[automorphism]] (self-[[isomorphism]]) of <math>V\\otimes V</math>.\n\nDefine two subsets of the second [[tensor power]] of {{var|V}}:\n\n:<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\n  \\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) &:= \\{v\\in V\\otimes V\\mid T(v)=v \\} \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) &:= \\{v\\in V\\otimes V\\mid T(v)=-v \\}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThese are the '''symmetric square of {{var|V}}''' and the '''alternating square of {{var|V}}''', respectively.{{sfn|Serre|1977|p=9}} The symmetric and alternating squares are also known as the '''symmetric part''' and '''antisymmetric part''' of the tensor product.{{sfn|James|2001|p=196}}\n\n==== Properties ====\n\nThe second [[tensor power]] of a linear representation {{var|V}} of a group {{var|G}} decomposes as the direct sum of the symmetric and alternating squares:\n\n: <math display=\"block\">V^{\\otimes 2}=V\\otimes V \\cong \\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) \\oplus \\operatorname{Alt}^2(V)</math>\n\nas representations. In particular, both are [[Subrepresentation|subrepresenations]] of the second tensor power. In the language of [[Module (mathematics)|modules]] over the [[group ring]], the symmetric and alternating squares are <math>\\mathbb{C}[G]</math>-[[submodules]] of <math>V\\otimes V</math>.{{sfn|James|2001|loc=Proposition 19.12}}\n\nIf {{var|V}} has a basis <math>\\{v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n\\}</math>, then the symmetric square has a basis <math>\\{v_i\\otimes v_j+v_j\\otimes v_i\\mid 1\\leq i\\leq j\\leq n\\}</math> and the alternating square has a basis <math>\\{v_i\\otimes v_j-v_j\\otimes v_i\\mid 1\\leq i<j\\leq n\\}</math>. Accordingly,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\dim\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V) &= \\frac{\\dim V(\\dim V + 1)}{2}, \\\\\n  \\dim\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V) &= \\frac{\\dim V(\\dim V - 1)}{2}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>{{sfn|James|2001|loc=Proposition 19.13}}{{sfn|Serre|1977|p=9}}\n\nLet <math>\\chi:G\\to\\mathbb{C}</math> be the [[Character (representation theory)|character]] of <math>V\\otimes V</math>. Then we can calculate the characters of the symmetric and alternating squares as follows: for all {{var|g}} in {{var|G}},\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n  \\chi_{\\operatorname{Sym}^2(V)}(g) &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi(g)^2+\\chi(g^2)), \\\\\n  \\chi_{\\operatorname{Alt}^2(V)}(g) &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\chi(g)^2-\\chi(g^2)).\n\\end{align}\n</math>{{sfn|James|2001|loc=Proposition 19.14}}\n\n=== The symmetric and exterior powers ===\n\nAs in [[multilinear algebra]], over a field of characteristic zero, one can more generally define the {{var|k}}<sup>th</sup> [[symmetric power]] <math>\\operatorname{Sym}^n(V)</math> and {{var|k}}<sup>th</sup> [[exterior power]] <math>\\Lambda^n(V)</math>, which are subspaces of the {{var|k}}<sup>th</sup> tensor power (see those pages for more detail on this construction). They are also subrepresentations, but higher tensor powers no longer decompose as their direct sum.\n\nThe [[Schur–Weyl duality]] computes the irreducible representations occurring in tensor powers of representations of the [[general linear group]] <math>G = \\operatorname{GL}(V)</math>. Precisely, as an <math>S_n \\times G</math>-module\n:<math>V^{\\otimes n} \\simeq \\bigoplus_\\lambda M_{\\lambda} \\otimes S^{\\lambda}(V)</math>\nwhere\n*<math>M_{\\lambda}</math> is an irreducible representation of the symmetric group <math>S_n</math> corresponding to a partition <math>\\lambda</math> of ''n'' (in decreasing order),\n*<math>S^{\\lambda}(V)</math> is the image of the [[Young symmetrizer]] <math>c_{\\lambda}: V^{\\otimes n} \\to V^{\\otimes n}</math>.\n\nThe mapping <math>V \\mapsto S^{\\lambda}(V)</math> is a functor called the [[Schur functor]]. It generalizes the constructions of symmetric and exterior powers:\n:<math>S^{(n)}(V) = \\operatorname{Sym}^n V, \\,\\, S^{(1, 1, \\dots, 1)}(V) = \\wedge^n V.</math>\n\nIn particular, as an ''G''-module, the above simplifies to\n:<math>V^{\\otimes n} \\simeq \\bigoplus_{\\lambda} S^{\\lambda}(V)^{\\oplus m_{\\lambda}}</math>\nwhere <math>m_\\lambda = \\dim M_\\lambda</math>. Moreover, the multiplicity <math>m_{\\lambda}</math> may be computed by the [[Frobenius formula]] (or the [[hook length formula]]). For example, take <math>n = 3</math>. Then there are exactly three partitions: <math>3 = 3 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1</math> and, as it turns out, <math>m_{(3)} = m_{(1, 1, 1)} = 1, \\, m_{(2, 1)} = 2</math>. Hence,\n:<math>V^{\\otimes 3} \\simeq \\operatorname{Sym}^3 V \\bigoplus \\wedge^3 V \\bigoplus S^{(2, 1)}(V)^{\\oplus 2}.</math>\n\n== Tensor products involving Schur functors ==\nLet <math>S^{\\lambda}</math> denote the [[Schur functor]] defined according to a partition <math>\\lambda</math>. Then there is the following decomposition:<ref>{{harvnb|Fulton–Harris|loc=§ 6.1. just after Corollay 6.6.}}</ref>\n:<math>S^{\\lambda} V \\otimes S^{\\mu} V \\simeq \\bigoplus_{\\nu} (S^{\\nu} V)^{\\oplus N_{\\lambda \\mu \\nu}}</math>\nwhere the multiplicities <math>N_{\\lambda \\mu \\nu}</math> are given by the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]].\n\nGiven finite-dimensional vector spaces ''V'', ''W'', the [[Schur functor]]s ''S''<sup>λ</sup> give the decomposition\n:<math>\\operatorname{Sym}(W^* \\otimes V) \\simeq \\bigoplus_{\\lambda} S^{\\lambda}(W^*) \\otimes S^{\\lambda}(V)</math>\nThe left-hand side can be identified with the [[ring of polynomial functions|ring ''k''[Hom(''V'', ''W'')] = ''k''[''V'' <sup>*</sup> ⊗ ''W''] of polynomial functions]] on Hom(''V'', ''W'') and so the above also gives the decomposition of ''k''[Hom(''V'', ''W'')].\n\n== Tensor products representations as representations of product groups ==\nLet ''G'', ''H'' be two groups and let <math>(\\pi,V)</math> and <math>(\\rho,W)</math> be representations of ''G'' and ''H'', respectively. Then we can let the direct product group <math>G\\times H</math> act on the tensor product space <math>V\\otimes W</math> by the formula\n:<math>(g, h) \\cdot (v \\otimes w) = \\pi(g) v \\otimes \\rho(h) w.</math>\nEven if <math>G=H</math>, we can still perform this construction, so that the tensor product of two representations of <math>G</math> could, alternatively, be viewed as a representation of <math>G\\times G</math> rather than a representation of <math>G</math>. It is therefore important to clarify whether the tensor product of two representations of <math>G</math> is being viewed as a representation of <math>G</math> or as a representation of <math>G\\times G</math>.\n\nIn contrast to the Clebsch–Gordan problem discussed above, the tensor product of two irreducible representations of <math>G</math> is irreducible when viewed as a representation of the product group <math>G\\times G</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Algebra}}\n*[[Dual representation]]\n*[[Hermite reciprocity]]\n*[[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]]\n*[[Lie group representation]]\n*[[Lie algebra representation]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{Fulton-Harris}}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n* {{Cite book|title=Representations and characters of groups|last=James|first=Gordon Douglas|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Liebeck, Martin W.|isbn=978-0521003926|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=52220683|ref=harv}}\n*[[Claudio Procesi]] (2007) ''Lie Groups: an approach through invariants and representation'', Springer, {{isbn|9780387260402}} .\n* {{cite book|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Serre|title=Linear Representations of Finite Groups|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1977|isbn=978-0-387-90190-9|oclc=2202385|ref=harv}}\n[[Category:Representation theory of finite groups]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Young symmetrizer''' is an element of the  [[group ring|group algebra]] of the [[symmetric group]], constructed in such a way that, for the homomorphism from the group algebra to the endomorphisms of a vector space <math>V^{\\otimes n}</math> obtained from the action of <math>S_n</math> on <math>V^{\\otimes n}</math> by permutation of indices, the image of the endomorphism determined by that element corresponds to an [[irreducible representation]] of the symmetric group over the [[complex number]]s. A similar construction works over any field, and the resulting representations are called '''[[Specht module]]s'''. The Young symmetrizer is named after British mathematician [[Alfred Young]].\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a finite symmetric group ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> and specific [[Young tableau]] λ corresponding to a numbered partition of ''n'', define two [[permutation group|permutation subgroups]] <math>P_\\lambda</math> and <math>Q_\\lambda</math> of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> as follows:\n{{what|reason=you forgot to specify the action|date=November 2016}}\n\n:<math>P_\\lambda=\\{ g\\in S_n : g \\text{ preserves each row of } \\lambda \\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>Q_\\lambda=\\{ g\\in S_n : g \\text{ preserves each column of } \\lambda \\}.</math>\n\nCorresponding to these two subgroups, define two vectors in the [[group algebra]] <math>\\mathbb{C}S_n</math> as\n\n:<math>a_\\lambda=\\sum_{g\\in P_\\lambda} e_g</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>b_\\lambda=\\sum_{g\\in Q_\\lambda} \\sgn(g) e_g</math>\n\nwhere <math>e_g</math> is the unit vector corresponding to ''g'', and <math>\\sgn(g)</math> is the sign of the permutation.

It provides a convenient way to describe the [[group representation]]s of the [[symmetric group|symmetric]] and [[general linear group|general linear]] groups and to study their properties. Young tableaux were introduced by [[Alfred Young]], a [[mathematician]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], in 1900.<ref>{{citation|title=The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. III: Sorting and Searching|first=Donald E.|last=Knuth|authorlink=Donald Knuth|edition=2nd|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1973|page=48|quote=Such arrangements were introduced by Alfred Young in 1900|title-link=The Art of Computer Programming}}.</ref><ref>{{citation|title=On quantitative substitutional analysis|first=A.|last=Young|journal=Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society|year=1900|volume=33|series=Ser. 1|issue=1|pages=97–145|doi=10.1112/plms/s1-33.1.97}}. See in particular p.&nbsp;133.</ref> They were then applied to the study of the symmetric group by [[Georg Frobenius]] in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians, including [[Percy MacMahon]], [[W. V. D. Hodge]], [[Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson|G. de B. Robinson]], [[Gian-Carlo Rota]], [[Alain Lascoux]], [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]] and [[Richard P. Stanley]].\n\n==Definitions==\n\n''Note: this article uses the English convention for displaying Young diagrams and tableaux''.\n\n=== Diagrams <!-- [[Young diagram]] currently redirects to this section]]--> ===\n[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|Young diagram of shape (5, 4, 1), English notation]]\n[[Image:Young diagram for 541 partition-French.svg|thumb|right|150px|Young diagram of shape (5, 4, 1), French notation]]\n\nA '''Young diagram''' (also called a [[Ferrers diagram]], particularly when represented using dots) is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row lengths in non-increasing order. Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] {{mvar|''λ''}} of a non-negative integer {{mvar|''n''}}, the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape {{mvar|''λ''}}, and it carries the same information as that partition. Containment of one Young diagram in another defines a [[partial ordering]] on the set of all partitions, which is in fact a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] structure, known as [[Young's lattice]]. Listing the number of boxes of a Young diagram in each column gives another partition, the '''conjugate''' or ''transpose'' partition of {{mvar|''λ''}}; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.\n\nThere is almost universal agreement that in labeling boxes of Young diagrams by pairs of integers, the first index selects the row of the diagram, and the second index selects the box within the row. Nevertheless, two distinct conventions exist to display these diagrams, and consequently tableaux: the first places each row below the previous one, the second stacks each row on top of the previous one. Since the former convention is mainly used by [[English-speaking world|Anglophones]] while the latter is often preferred by [[Francophone]]s, it is customary to refer to these conventions respectively as the ''English notation'' and the ''French notation''; for instance, in his book on [[symmetric function]]s, [[Ian G. Macdonald|Macdonald]] advises readers preferring the French convention to \"read this book upside down in a mirror\" (Macdonald 1979, p.&nbsp;2). This nomenclature probably started out as jocular. The English notation corresponds to the one universally used for matrices, while the French notation is closer to the convention of [[Cartesian coordinates]]; however, French notation differs from that convention by placing the vertical coordinate first. The figure on the right shows, using the English notation, the Young diagram corresponding to the partition (5, 4, 1) of the number 10. The conjugate partition, measuring the column lengths, is (3, 2, 2, 2, 1).\n\n==== Arm and leg length ====\nIn many applications, for example when defining [[Jack function]]s, it is convenient to define the '''arm length''' ''a''<sub>λ</sub>(''s'') of a box ''s'' as the number of boxes to the right of ''s'' in the diagram λ. Similarly, the '''leg length''' ''l''<sub>λ</sub>(''s'') is the number of boxes below ''s''. This notation assumes that the English notation is used.\nFor example, the ''hook'' value of a box ''s'' in λ is then simply ''a''<sub>λ</sub>(''s'')+''l''<sub>λ</sub>(''s'')+1.\n\n=== Tableaux ===\n[[Image:Young tableaux for 541 partition.svg|thumb|right|150px|A standard Young tableau of shape (5, 4, 1)]]\n\nA '''Young tableau''' is obtained by filling in the boxes of the Young diagram with symbols taken from some ''alphabet'', which is usually required to be a [[totally ordered set]]. Originally that alphabet was a set of indexed variables {{mvar|''x''<sub>1</sub>}}, {{mvar|''x''<sub>2</sub>}}, {{mvar|''x''<sub>3</sub>}}..., but now one usually uses a set of numbers for brevity. In their original application to [[representations of the symmetric group]], Young tableaux have {{mvar|''n''}} distinct entries, arbitrarily assigned to boxes of the diagram.  A tableau is called '''standard''' if the entries in each row and each column are increasing. The number of distinct standard Young tableaux on {{mvar|''n''}} entries is given by the [[involution number]]s\n:1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, ... {{OEIS|A000085}}.\n\nIn other applications, it is natural to allow the same number to appear more than once (or not at all) in a tableau.  A tableau is called '''semistandard''', or ''column strict'', if the entries weakly increase along each row and strictly increase down each column.  Recording the number of times each number appears in a tableau gives a sequence known as the '''weight''' of the tableau.   Thus the standard Young tableaux are precisely the semistandard tableaux of weight (1,1,...,1), which requires every integer up to {{mvar|''n''}} to occur exactly once.\n\n=== Variations ===\n\nThere are several variations of this definition: for example, in a row-strict tableau the entries strictly increase along the rows and weakly increase down the columns. Also, tableaux with ''decreasing'' entries have been considered, notably, in the theory of [[plane partition]]s. There are also generalizations such as domino tableaux or ribbon tableaux, in which several boxes may be grouped together before assigning entries to them.\n\n=== Skew tableaux ===\n[[Image:Skew tableau 5422-21.svg|thumb|right|150px|Skew tableau of shape (5, 4, 2, 2) / (2, 1), English notation]]\n\nA '''skew shape''' is a pair of partitions ({{math|''λ''}}, {{math|''μ''}}) such that the Young diagram of {{math|''λ''}} contains the Young diagram of {{math|''μ''}}; it is denoted by {{math|''λ''/''μ''}}.  If {{math|''λ'' {{=}} (''λ''<sub>1</sub>, ''λ''<sub>2</sub>, ...)}} and {{math|''μ'' {{=}} (''μ''<sub>1</sub>, ''μ''<sub>2</sub>, ...)}}, then the containment of diagrams means that {{math|''μ''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''λ''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for all {{mvar|i}}. The '''skew diagram''' of a skew shape {{math|''λ''/''μ''}} is the set-theoretic difference of the Young diagrams of {{mvar|''λ''}} and {{mvar|''μ''}}: the set of squares that belong to the diagram of {{mvar|''λ''}} but not to that of {{mvar|''μ''}}. A '''skew tableau''' of shape {{math|''λ''/''μ''}} is obtained by filling the squares of the corresponding skew diagram; such a tableau is semistandard if entries increase weakly along each row, and increase strictly down each column, and it is standard if moreover all numbers from 1 to the number of squares of the skew diagram occur exactly once. While the map from partitions to their Young diagrams is injective, this is not the case from the map from skew shapes to skew diagrams;<ref>For instance the skew diagram consisting of a single square at position (2,4) can be obtained by removing the diagram of {{math|''μ''&nbsp;{{=}}&nbsp;(5,3,2,1)}} from the one of {{math|''λ'' {{=}} (5,4,2,1)}}, but also in (infinitely) many other ways. In general any skew diagram whose set of non-empty rows (or of non-empty columns) is not contiguous or does not contain the first row (respectively column) will be associated to more than one skew shape.</ref> therefore the shape of a skew diagram cannot always be determined from the set of filled squares only. Although many properties of skew tableaux only depend on the filled squares, some operations defined on them do require explicit knowledge of {{mvar|''λ''}} and {{mvar|''μ''}}, so it is important that skew tableaux do record this information: two distinct skew tableaux may differ only in their shape, while they occupy the same set of squares, each filled with the same entries.<ref>A somewhat similar situation arises for matrices: the 3-by-0 matrix {{mvar|''A''}} must be distinguished from the 0-by-3 matrix {{mvar|''B''}}, since {{math|''AB''}} is a 3-by-3 (zero) matrix while {{math|''BA''}} is the 0-by-0 matrix, but both {{mvar|''A''}} and {{mvar|''B''}} have the same (empty) set of entries; for skew tableaux however such distinction is necessary even in cases where the set of entries is not empty.</ref> Young tableaux can be identified with skew tableaux in which {{mvar|''μ''}} is the empty partition (0) (the unique partition of 0).\n\nAny skew semistandard tableau {{mvar|''T''}} of shape {{math|''λ''/''μ''}} with positive integer entries gives rise to a sequence of partitions (or Young diagrams), by starting with {{mvar|''μ''}}, and taking for the partition {{mvar|''i''}} places further in the sequence the one whose diagram is obtained from that of {{mvar|''μ''}} by adding all the boxes that contain a value&nbsp; ≤&nbsp;{{mvar|''i''}} in {{mvar|''T''}}; this partition eventually becomes equal to&nbsp;{{mvar|''λ''}}. Any pair of successive shapes in such a sequence is a skew shape whose diagram contains at most one box in each column; such shapes are called '''horizontal strips'''. This sequence of partitions completely determines {{mvar|''T''}}, and it is in fact possible to define (skew) semistandard tableaux as such sequences, as is done by Macdonald (Macdonald 1979, p.&nbsp;4). This definition incorporates the partitions {{mvar|''λ''}} and {{mvar|''μ''}} in the data comprising the skew tableau.\n\n== Overview of applications ==\n\nYoung tableaux have numerous applications in [[combinatorics]], [[representation theory]], and [[algebraic geometry]]. Various ways of counting Young tableaux have been explored and lead to the definition of and identities for [[Schur polynomial|Schur functions]]. Many combinatorial algorithms on tableaux are known, including Schützenberger's [[jeu de taquin]] and the [[Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence]]. Lascoux and Schützenberger studied an [[associative]] product on the set of all semistandard Young tableaux, giving it the structure called the ''[[plactic monoid]]'' (French: ''le monoïde plaxique'').\n\nIn representation theory, standard Young tableaux of size {{mvar|''k''}} describe bases in irreducible representations of the [[symmetric group]] on {{mvar|''k''}} letters. The [[standard monomial basis]] in a finite-dimensional [[irreducible representation]] of the [[general linear group]] {{math|''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are parametrized by the set of semistandard Young tableaux of a fixed shape over the alphabet {1, 2, ..., {{mvar|''n''}}}. This has important consequences for [[invariant theory]], starting from the work of [[W. V. D. Hodge|Hodge]] on the [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] of the [[Grassmannian]] and further explored by [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] with collaborators, [[Corrado de Concini|de Concini]] and [[Claudio Procesi|Procesi]], and [[David Eisenbud|Eisenbud]]. The [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]] describing (among other things) the decomposition of [[tensor product]]s of irreducible representations of {{math|''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>}} into irreducible components is formulated in terms of certain skew semistandard tableaux.\n\nApplications to algebraic geometry center around [[Schubert calculus]] on Grassmannians and [[flag varieties]]. Certain important [[cohomology class]]es can be represented by [[Schubert polynomial]]s and described in terms of Young tableaux.\n\n==Applications in representation theory==\n{{see also|Representation theory of the symmetric group}}\nYoung diagrams are in one-to-one correspondence with [[irreducible representation]]s of the [[symmetric group]] over the [[complex number]]s. They provide a convenient way of specifying the [[Young symmetrizer]]s from which the [[representation theory of the symmetric group|irreducible representations]] are built. Many facts about a representation can be deduced from the corresponding diagram. Below, we describe two examples: determining the dimension of a representation and restricted representations. In both cases, we will see that some properties of a representation can be determined by using just its diagram.\n\nYoung diagrams also parametrize the irreducible polynomial representations of the [[general linear group]] {{math|''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>}} (when they have at most {{mvar|''n''}} nonempty rows), or the irreducible representations of the [[special linear group]] {{math|''SL''<sub>''n''</sub>}} (when they have at most {{math|''n'' − 1}} nonempty rows), or the irreducible complex representations of the [[special unitary group]] {{math|''SU''<sub>''n''</sub>}} (again when they have at most {{math|''n'' − 1}} nonempty rows). In these cases semistandard tableaux with entries up to {{mvar|''n''}} play a central role, rather than standard tableaux; in particular it is the number of those tableaux that determines the dimension of the representation.\n\n===Dimension of a representation===\n{{Main|Hook length formula}}\n{{Plain image with caption|\nImage:Hook length for 541 partition.svg|caption=''Hook-lengths'' of the boxes for the partition 10&nbsp;=&nbsp;5&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1}}\n\nThe dimension of the irreducible representation {{math|{{pi}}<sub>''λ''</sub>}} of the symmetric group {{math|''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}} corresponding to a partition {{mvar|''λ''}} of {{mvar|''n''}} is equal to the number of different standard Young tableaux that can be obtained from the diagram of the representation. This number can be calculated by the [[hook length formula]].\n\nA '''hook length''' {{math|hook(''x'')}} of a box {{mvar|''x''}} in Young diagram {{math|''Y''(''λ'')}} of shape {{mvar|''λ''}} is the number of boxes that are in the same row to the right of it plus those boxes in the same column below it, plus one (for the box itself). By the hook-length formula, the dimension of an irreducible representation is {{math|''n''!}} divided by the product of the hook lengths of all boxes in the diagram of the representation:\n\n:<math>\\dim\\pi_\\lambda = \\frac{n!}{\\prod_{x \\in Y(\\lambda)} \\operatorname{hook}(x)}.</math>\n\nThe figure on the right shows hook-lengths for all boxes in the diagram of the partition 10 = 5 + 4 + 1. Thus\n\n:<math>\\dim\\pi_\\lambda = \\frac{10!}{7\\cdot5\\cdot 4 \\cdot 3\\cdot 1\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot1} = 288.</math>\n\nSimilarly, the dimension of the irreducible representation {{math|''W''(''λ'')}} of {{math|GL<sub>''r''</sub>}} corresponding to the partition ''λ'' of ''n'' (with at most ''r'' parts) is the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape ''λ'' (containing only the entries from 1 to ''r''), which is given by the hook-length formula:\n\n: <math>\\dim W(\\lambda) = \\prod_{(i,j) \\in Y(\\lambda)} \\frac{r+j-i}{\\operatorname{hook}(i,j)},</math>\n\nwhere the index ''i'' gives the row and ''j'' the column of a box.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Predrag Cvitanović]] |year=2008 |title=Group Theory: Birdtracks, Lie's, and Exceptional Groups | publisher=Princeton University Press | url=http://birdtracks.eu/}}, eq. 9.28 and appendix B.4</ref> For instance, for the partition (5,4,1) we get as dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation of {{math|GL<sub>7</sub>}} (traversing the boxes by rows):\n\n:<math>\\dim W(\\lambda) = \\frac{7\\cdot 8\\cdot 9\\cdot 10\\cdot 11\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 9\\cdot 5}{7\\cdot5\\cdot 4 \\cdot 3\\cdot 1\\cdot 5\\cdot 3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1\\cdot1} = 66 528.</math>\n\n===Restricted representations===\n\nA representation of the symmetric group on {{mvar|''n''}} elements, {{math|''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is also a representation of the symmetric group on {{math|''n'' − 1}} elements, {{math|''S''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}}. However, an irreducible representation of {{math|''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}} may not be irreducible for {{math|''S''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}}. Instead, it may be a [[direct sum of representations|direct sum]] of several representations that are irreducible for {{math|''S''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}}. These representations are then called the factors of the [[restricted representation]] (see also [[induced representation]]).\n\nThe question of determining this decomposition of the restricted representation of a given irreducible representation of ''S''<sub>''n''</sub>, corresponding to a partition {{mvar|''λ''}} of {{mvar|''n''}}, is answered as follows. One forms the set of all Young diagrams that can be obtained from the diagram of shape {{mvar|''λ''}} by removing just one box (which must be at the end both of its row and of its column); the restricted representation then decomposes as a direct sum of the irreducible representations of {{math|''S''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}} corresponding to those diagrams, each occurring exactly once in the sum.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Robinson–Schensted correspondence]]\n* [[Schur–Weyl duality]]\n* [[Young's lattice]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[William Fulton (mathematician)|William Fulton]].

The classification theorem states that the [[list of finite simple groups]] consists of 18 [[countably]] infinite families, plus 26 exceptions that do not follow such a systematic pattern. These 26 exceptions are the sporadic groups. They are also known as the sporadic simple groups, or the sporadic finite groups.

It does not show the numerous non-sporadic simple subquotients of the sporadic groups.\n\n==Organization==\n\nOf the 26 sporadic groups, 20 can be seen inside the [[Monster group]] as [[subgroup]]s or [[quotient group|quotients]] of subgroups ([[Section (group theory)|section]]s).\n\n===I. Pariah===\n\n{{main article|Pariah group}}\n\nThe six exceptions are ''J''<sub>1</sub>, ''J''<sub>3</sub>, ''J''<sub>4</sub>, ''O'N'', ''Ru'' and ''Ly''. These six are sometimes known as the [[pariah group|pariahs]].\n\n===II. Happy Family===\n\nThe remaining twenty have been called the ''Happy Family'' by [[Robert Griess]], and can be organized into three generations.\n\n====First generation (5 groups): the Mathieu groups====\n\n{{main article|Mathieu groups}}\n\nM<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' = 11, 12, 22, 23 and 24 are multiply transitive [[permutation group]]s on ''n'' points. They are all subgroups of M<sub>24</sub>, which is a permutation group on [[24 (number)|24]] points.\n\n====Second generation (7 groups): the Leech lattice====\n\n{{see also|Leech lattice|Conway groups}}\n\nAll the [[subquotient]]s of the [[automorphism group]] of a lattice in [[24 (number)|24]] dimensions called the [[Leech lattice]]:\n* ''Co''<sub>1</sub> is the quotient of the automorphism group by its center {±1}\n* ''Co''<sub>2</sub> is the stabilizer of a type 2 (i.e., length 2) vector\n* ''Co''<sub>3</sub> is the stabilizer of a type 3 (i.e., length {{radic|6}}) vector\n* ''Suz'' is the group of automorphisms preserving a complex structure (modulo its center)\n* ''McL'' is the stabilizer of a type 2-2-3 triangle\n* ''HS'' is the stabilizer of a type 2-3-3 triangle\n* ''J''<sub>2</sub> is the group of automorphisms preserving a quaternionic structure (modulo its center).\n\n====Third generation (8 groups): other subgroups of the Monster====\n\nConsists of subgroups which are closely related to the Monster group ''M'':\n* ''B'' or ''F''<sub>2</sub> has a double cover which is the [[centralizer]] of an element of order 2 in ''M''\n* ''Fi''<sub>24</sub>&prime; has a triple cover which is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in ''M'' (in [[conjugacy class]] \"3A\")\n* ''Fi''<sub>23</sub> is a subgroup of ''Fi''<sub>24</sub>&prime;\n* ''Fi''<sub>22</sub>  has a double cover which is a subgroup of ''Fi''<sub>23</sub>\n* The product of ''Th'' = ''F''<sub>3</sub> and a group of order 3 is the centralizer of an element of order 3 in ''M'' (in conjugacy class \"3C\")\n* The product of ''HN'' = ''F''<sub>5</sub>  and a group of order 5 is the centralizer of an element of order 5 in ''M''\n* The product of ''He'' = ''F''<sub>7</sub> and a group of order 7 is the centralizer of an element of order 7 in ''M''.\n* Finally, the Monster group itself is considered to be in this generation.\n\n(This series continues further: the product of ''M''<sub>12</sub> and a group of order 11 is the centralizer of an element of order 11 in ''M''.)\n\nThe [[Tits group]] also belongs in this generation: there is a subgroup S<sub>4</sub> &times;<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2)&prime; normalising a 2C<sup>2</sup> subgroup of ''B'', giving rise to a subgroup\n2·S<sub>4</sub> &times;<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2)&prime; normalising a certain Q<sub>8</sub> subgroup of the Monster.\n<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2)&prime; is also a subgroup of the Fischer groups ''Fi''<sub>22</sub>, ''Fi''<sub>23</sub> and ''Fi''<sub>24</sub>&prime;, and of the Baby Monster ''B''.\n<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2)&prime; is also a subgroup of the (pariah) Rudvalis group ''Ru'', and has\nno involvements in sporadic simple groups except the containments we have already mentioned.\n\n==Table of the sporadic group orders==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The double cover of the baby monster is the [[centralizer]] of an element of order 2 in the monster group. The [[outer automorphism group]] is trivial and the [[Schur multiplier]] has order 2.\n\n==History==\nThe existence of this group was suggested by [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]] in unpublished work from the early 1970s during his investigation of {3,4}-transposition groups: groups generated by a class of transpositions such that the product of any two elements has order at most 4. He investigated its properties and computed its [[character table]]. The first construction of the baby monster was later realized as a permutation group on 13 571 955 000 points using a computer by Jeffrey Leon and [[Charles Sims (mathematician)|Charles Sims]],<ref>{{harv|Gorenstein|1993}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1=Leon | first1=Jeffrey S. | last2=Sims | first2=Charles C. | authorlink2=Charles Sims (mathematician) | title=The existence and uniqueness of a simple group generated by {3,4}-transpositions | journal=Bull.

      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}\n\nIn the area of modern algebra known as [[group theory]], the '''Conway groups''' are the three [[sporadic simple group]]s [[Conway group Co1|Co<sub>1</sub>]], [[Conway group Co2|Co<sub>2</sub>]] and [[Conway group Co3|Co<sub>3</sub>]] along with the related finite group [[Leech lattice#Symmetries|Co<sub>0</sub>]] introduced by {{harvs |authorlink=John Horton Conway |last=Conway |year1=1968 |year2=1969}}.\n\nThe largest of the Conway groups, '''Co<sub>0</sub>''', is the [[Automorphism group|group of automorphisms]] of the [[Leech lattice]] Λ with respect to addition and [[inner product]].  It has [[Order (group theory)|order]]\n\n: {{val|fmt=commas|8,315,553,613,086,720,000}}\n\nbut it is not a simple group.  The simple group '''Co<sub>1</sub>''' of order\n\n: {{val|fmt=commas|4,157,776,806,543,360,000}}\n\nis defined as the quotient of '''Co<sub>0</sub>''' by its [[center of a group|center]], which consists of the scalar matrices ±1.\n\nThe '''inner product''' on the Leech lattice is defined as 1/8 the [[dot product|sum of the products]] of respective co-ordinates of the two multiplicand vectors; it is an integer. The '''square norm''' of a vector is its inner product with itself, always an even integer. It is common to speak of the '''type''' of a Leech lattice vector: half the square norm. Subgroups are often named in reference to the ''types'' of relevant fixed points.  This lattice has no vectors of type 1.\n\nThe groups '''[[Conway group Co2|Co<sub>2</sub>]]''' (of order {{val|fmt=commas|42,305,421,312,000}}) and '''[[Conway group Co3|Co<sub>3</sub>]]''' (of order {{val|fmt=commas|495,766,656,000}}) consist of the automorphisms of Λ fixing a lattice vector of type 2 and a vector of type 3 respectively.  As the scalar &minus;1 fixes no non-zero vector, these two groups are isomorphic to subgroups of Co<sub>1</sub>.\n\n==History==\n\n{{harvs|txt|first=Thomas |last=Thompson|year=1983}} relates how [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] about 1964 investigated close packings of spheres in Euclidean spaces of large dimension. One of Leech's discoveries was a lattice packing in 24-space, based on what came to be called the Leech lattice Λ. He wondered whether his lattice's symmetry group contained an interesting simple group, but felt he needed the help of someone better acquainted with group theory. He had to do much asking around because the mathematicians were pre-occupied with agendas of their own. [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] agreed to look at the problem. [[John G. Thompson]] said he would be interested if he were given the order of the group. Conway expected to spend months or years on the problem, but found results in just a few sessions.\n\n{{harvtxt|Witt|1998|loc= page 329}} stated that he found the Leech lattice in 1940 and hinted that he calculated the order of its automorphism group Co<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Monomial subgroup N of Co<sub>0</sub>==\nConway started his investigation of Co<sub>0</sub> with a subgroup he called '''N''', a [[holomorph (mathematics)|holomorph]] of the (extended) [[binary Golay code#Mathematical definition|binary Golay code]] (as [[diagonal matrices]] with 1 or −1 as diagonal elements) by the [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>]] (as [[permutation matrices]]). {{nowrap|'''N''' ≈ 2<sup>12</sup>:M<sub>24</sub>}}.\n\nA standard [[binary Golay code#A convenient representation|representation]], used throughout this article, of the binary Golay code arranges the 24 co-ordinates so that 6 consecutive blocks (tetrads) of 4 constitute a [[Mathieu group M24#Sextet subgroup|sextet]].\n\nThe matrices of Co<sub>0</sub> are [[orthogonal#Definitions|orthogonal]]; i. e., they leave the inner product invariant. The [[matrix (mathematics)#Invertible matrix and its inverse|inverse]] is the [[transpose]]. Co<sub>0</sub> has no matrices of [[matrix (mathematics)#Determinant|determinant]] −1.\n\nThe Leech lattice can easily be defined as the '''Z'''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] generated by the set Λ<sub>2</sub> of all vectors of type 2, consisting of\n: (4, 4, 0<sup>22</sup>)\n: (2<sup>8</sup>, 0<sup>16</sup>)\n: (−3, 1<sup>23</sup>)\n\nand their images under '''N'''. Λ<sub>2</sub> under '''N''' falls into 3 [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]]s of sizes {{val|fmt=commas|1104}}, {{val|fmt=commas|97152}}, and {{val|fmt=commas|98304}}.Then {{nowrap|1={{abs|Λ<sub>2</sub>}} = {{val|fmt=commas|196560}} = 2<sup>4</sup>&sdot;3<sup>3</sup>&sdot;5&sdot;7&sdot;13}}. Conway strongly suspected that Co<sub>0</sub> was [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|transitive]] on Λ<sub>2</sub>, and indeed he found a new matrix, not [[generalized permutation matrix|monomial]] and not an integer matrix.\n\nLet ''η'' be the 4-by-4 matrix\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 &  -1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n  -1 &   1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n  -1 &  -1 &  1 & -1 \\\\\n  -1 &  -1 & -1 &  1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nNow let ζ be a block sum of 6 matrices: odd numbers each of ''η'' and −''η''.<ref>Griess, p.&nbsp;97.</ref><ref>Thomas Thompson, pp.&nbsp;148–152.</ref> ''ζ'' is a [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] and orthogonal matrix, thus an [[involution (mathematics)#group theory|involution]]. Some experimenting shows that it interchanges vectors between different orbits of '''N'''.\n\nTo compute |Co<sub>0</sub>| it is best to consider Λ<sub>4</sub>, the set of vectors of type 4. Any type 4 vector is one of exactly 48 type 4 vectors congruent to each other modulo 2Λ, falling into 24 orthogonal pairs {{nowrap|{''v'', –''v''}.}} A set of 48 such vectors is called a '''frame''' or '''cross'''. '''N''' has as an [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit]] a standard frame of 48 vectors of form (±8, 0<sup>23</sup>). The subgroup fixing a given frame is a [[conjugacy class#Conjugacy of subgroups and general subsets|conjugate]] of '''N'''. The group 2<sup>12</sup>, isomorphic to the Golay code, acts as sign changes on vectors of the frame, while M<sub>24</sub> permutes the 24 pairs of the frame. Co<sub>0</sub> can be shown to be [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|transitive]] on Λ<sub>4</sub>. Conway multiplied the order 2<sup>12</sup>|M<sub>24</sub>| of '''N''' by the number of frames, the latter being equal to the quotient {{nowrap|1={{abs|Λ<sub>4</sub>}}/48 = {{val|fmt=commas|8,252,375}} = 3<sup>6</sup>&sdot;5<sup>3</sup>&sdot;7&sdot;13}}. That product is the order of ''any'' subgroup of Co<sub>0</sub> that properly contains '''N'''; hence '''N''' is a maximal subgroup of Co<sub>0</sub> and contains 2-Sylow subgroups of Co<sub>0</sub>. '''N''' also is the subgroup in Co<sub>0</sub> of all matrices with integer components.\n\nSince Λ includes vectors of the shape {{nowrap|(±8, 0<sup>23</sup>)}}, Co<sub>0</sub> consists of rational matrices whose denominators are all divisors of 8.\n\nThe smallest non-trivial representation of Co<sub>0</sub> over any field is the 24-dimensional one coming from the Leech lattice, and this is faithful over fields of characteristic other than 2.\n\n==Involutions in Co<sub>0</sub>==\nAny [[involution (mathematics)#group theory|involution]] in Co<sub>0</sub> can be shown to be [[Conjugacy class|conjugate]] to an element of the Golay code. Co<sub>0</sub> has 4 conjugacy classes of involutions.\n\nA permutation matrix of shape 2<sup>12</sup> can be shown to be conjugate to a [[Binary Golay code#Mathematical definition|dodecad]]. Its centralizer has the form 2<sup>12</sup>:M<sub>12</sub> and has conjugates inside the monomial subgroup. Any matrix in this conjugacy class has trace 0.\n\nA permutation matrix of shape 2<sup>8</sup>1<sup>8</sup> can be shown to be conjugate to an [[Binary Golay code#Mathematical definition|octad]]; it has trace 8. This and its negative (trace −8) have a common centralizer of the form {{nowrap|(2<sup>1+8</sup>×2).O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2)}}, a subgroup maximal in Co<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Sublattice groups==\nConway and Thompson found that four recently discovered sporadic simple groups, described in conference proceedings {{harv|Brauer|Sah|1969}}, were isomorphic to subgroups or quotients of subgroups of Co<sub>0</sub>.\n\nConway himself employed a notation for stabilizers of points and subspaces where he prefixed a dot. Exceptional were '''.0''' and '''.1''', being Co<sub>0</sub> and Co<sub>1</sub>. For integer {{nowrap|'''n''' ≥ 2}} let '''.n''' denote the stabilizer of a point of type '''n''' (see above) in the Leech lattice.\n\nConway then named stabilizers of planes defined by triangles having the origin as a vertex. Let '''.hkl''' be the pointwise stabilizer of a triangle with edges (differences of vertices) of types '''h''', '''k''' and '''l'''. The triangle is commonly called an '''h-k-l triangle'''.  In the simplest cases Co<sub>0</sub> is transitive on the points or triangles in question and stabilizer groups are defined up to conjugacy.\n\nConway identified '''.322''' with the '''[[McLaughlin group (mathematics)|McLaughlin group]]''' McL (order {{val|fmt=commas|898,128,000}}) and '''.332''' with the '''[[Higman–Sims group]]''' HS (order {{val|fmt=commas|44,352,000}}); both of these had recently been discovered.\n\nHere is a table<ref>Conway & Sloane (1999), p. 291</ref><ref>Griess (1998), p. 126</ref> of some sublattice groups:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

Identifying '''R'''<sup>24</sup> with '''C'''<sup>12</sup> and Λ with\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{Z}\\left[e^{\\frac{2}{3}\\pi i}\\right]^{12},</math>\n\nthe resulting automorphism group (i.e., the group of Leech lattice automorphisms preserving the [[complex structure on a real vector space|complex structure]]) when divided by the six-element group of complex scalar matrices, gives the '''[[Suzuki sporadic group|Suzuki group]]''' Suz (order {{val|fmt=commas|448,345,497,600}}). This group was discovered by [[Michio Suzuki]] in 1968.\n\nA similar construction gives the '''[[Hall–Janko group]]''' J<sub>2</sub> (order {{val|fmt=commas|604,800}}) as the quotient of the group of [[quaternion]]ic automorphisms of Λ by the group ±1 of scalars.\n\nThe seven simple groups described above comprise what [[Robert Griess]] calls the ''second generation of the Happy Family'', which consists of the 20 sporadic simple groups found within the [[Monster group]]. Several of the seven groups contain at least some of the five [[Mathieu groups]], which comprise the ''first generation''.\n\n==Suzuki chain of product groups==\nCo<sub>0</sub> has 4 conjugacy classes of elements of order 3. In M<sub>24</sub> an element of shape 3<sup>8</sup> generates a group normal in a copy of S<sub>3</sub>, which commutes with a simple subgroup of order 168. A [[Binary Golay code#A convenient representation|direct product]] {{nowrap|PSL(2,7) × S<sub>3</sub>}} in M<sub>24</sub> permutes the octads of a [[Mathieu group M24#Trio subgroup|trio]] and permutes 14 dodecad diagonal matrices in the monomial subgroup. In Co<sub>0</sub> this monomial normalizer {{nowrap|2<sup>4</sup>:PSL(2,7) × S<sub>3</sub>}} is expanded to a maximal subgroup of the form {{nowrap|2.A<sub>9</sub> × S<sub>3</sub>}}, where 2.A<sub>9</sub> is the double cover of the alternating group A<sub>9</sub>.\n\nJohn Thompson pointed out it would be fruitful to investigate the normalizers of smaller subgroups of the form 2.A<sub>n</sub> {{harv|Conway|1971|loc=p.&nbsp;242}}. Several other maximal subgroups of Co<sub>0</sub> are found in this way. Moreover, two sporadic groups appear in the resulting chain.\n\nThere is a subgroup {{nowrap|2.A<sub>8</sub> × S<sub>4</sub>}}, the only one of this chain not maximal in Co<sub>0</sub>. Next there is the subgroup {{nowrap|(2.A<sub>7</sub> × PSL<sub>2</sub>(7)):2}}. Next comes {{nowrap|(2.A<sub>6</sub> × SU<sub>3</sub>(3)):2}}. The unitary group SU<sub>3</sub>(3) (order {{val|fmt=commas|6048}}) possesses a graph of 36 vertices, in anticipation of the next subgroup. That subgroup is {{nowrap|(2.A<sub>5</sub> o 2.HJ):2}}, in which the [[Hall–Janko group]] HJ makes its appearance. The aforementioned graph expands to the [[Hall–Janko graph]], with 100 vertices.  Next comes {{nowrap|(2.A<sub>4</sub> o 2.G<sub>2</sub>(4)):2}}, G<sub>2</sub>(4) being an exceptional [[G2 (mathematics)|group of Lie type]].\n\nThe chain ends with 6.Suz:2 (Suz=[[Suzuki sporadic group]]), which, as mentioned above, respects a complex representation of the Leech Lattice.\n\n==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==\n\nConway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that [[monstrous moonshine]] is not limited to the monster. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups.  For the Conway groups, the relevant McKay–Thompson series is <math>T_{2A}(\\tau)</math> = {1, 0, 276, {{val|fmt=commas|−2048}}, {{val|fmt=commas|11202}}, {{val|fmt=commas|−49152}}, …} ({{OEIS2C|id=A007246}}) and <math>T_{4A}(\\tau)</math> = {1, 0, 276, {{val|fmt=commas|2048}}, {{val|fmt=commas|11202}}, {{val|fmt=commas|49152}}, …} ({{OEIS2C|id=A097340}}) where one can set the constant term {{nowrap|1=a(0) = 24}},\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  j_{4A}(\\tau)\n    &= T_{4A}(\\tau) + 24 \\\\\n    &= \\left(\\frac{\\eta^2(2\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)\\,\\eta(4\\tau)}\\right)^{24} \\\\\n    &= \\left(\\left(\\frac{\\eta(\\tau)}{\\eta(4\\tau)}\\right)^4 + 4^2 \\left(\\frac{\\eta(4\\tau)}{\\eta(\\tau)}\\right)^4\\right)^2 \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{q} + 24 + 276q + 2048q^2 + 11202q^3 + 49152q^4 + \\dots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand ''η''(''τ'') is the [[Dedekind eta function]].\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n* {{Citation | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | title=A perfect group of order 8,315,553,613,086,720,000 and the sporadic simple groups | mr=0237634 | year=1968 | journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | volume=61 | pages=398–400 | doi=10.1073/pnas.61.2.398 | issue=2| pmc=225171 }}\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=Brauer | editor1-first=R. | editor1-link=Richard Brauer | editor2-last=Sah | editor2-first=Chih-han | title=Theory of finite groups: A symposium | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRdCAAAAIAAJ | publisher=W.

It is the largest of the three sporadic Conway groups and can be obtained as the quotient of ''Co<sub>0</sub>'' ([[Automorphism group|group of automorphisms]] of the [[Leech lattice]] Λ that fix the origin) by its [[center of a group|center]], which consists of the scalar matrices ±1.  It also appears at the top of the automorphism group of the even 26-dimensional unimodular lattice [[II25,1|II<sub>25,1</sub>]]. Some rather cryptic comments in Witt's collected works suggest that he found the Leech lattice and possibly the order of its automorphism group in unpublished work in 1940.\n\nThe [[outer automorphism group]] is trivial and the [[Schur multiplier]] has order 2.\n\n==Involutions==\nCo<sub>0</sub> has 4 conjugacy classes of involutions; these collapse to 2 in Co<sub>1</sub>, but there are 4-elements in Co<sub>0</sub> that correspond to a third class of involutions in Co<sub>1</sub>.\n\nAn image of a dodecad has a centralizer of type 2<sup>11</sup>:M<sub>12</sub>:2, which is contained in a maximal subgroup of type 2<sup>11</sup>:M<sub>24</sub>.\n\nAn image of an octad or 16-set has a centralizer of the form 2<sup>1+8</sup>.O<sub>8</sub><sup>+</sup>(2), a maximal subgroup.\n\n== Representations ==\n\nThe smallest faithful permutation representation  of Co<sub>1</sub> is on the 98280 pairs {''v'',–''v''} of norm 4 vectors.\n\nThere is a matrix representation of dimension 24 over the field <math>\\mathbb{F}_{2}</math>.\n\nThe centralizer of an involution of type 2B in the [[monster group]] is of the form 2<sup>1+24</sup>Co<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe Dynkin diagram of the even Lorentzian [[unimodular lattice]] [[II1,25|II<sub>1,25</sub>]] is isometric to the (affine) Leech lattice Λ, so the group of diagram automorphisms is split extension Λ,Co<sub>0</sub> of affine isometries of the Leech lattice.\n\n== Maximal subgroups ==\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|1983}} found the 22 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of  ''Co<sub>1</sub>'', though there were some errors in this list, corrected by {{harvtxt|Wilson|1988}}.\n\n*[[Conway group Co2|Co<sub>2</sub>]] \n*3.[[Suzuki sporadic group|Suz]]:2    The lift to Aut(Λ) = Co<sub>0</sub> fixes a complex structure or changes it to the complex conjugate structure.

      "text": "{{for|general background and history of the Conway sporadic groups|Conway group}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Conway group Co<sub>2</sub>}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}\n\nIn the area of modern algebra known as [[group theory]], the '''Conway group''' ''Co<sub>2</sub>'' is a [[sporadic simple group]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]]\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>18</sup>{{·}}3<sup>6</sup>{{·}}5<sup>3</sup>{{·}}7{{·}}11{{·}}23\n: = 42305421312000\n: ≈ 4{{e|13}}.\n\n==History and properties==\n''Co<sub>2</sub>'' is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by  {{harvs |authorlink=John Horton Conway |last=Conway |year1=1968 |year2=1969}} as the [[Automorphism group|group of automorphisms]] of the [[Leech lattice]] Λ fixing a lattice vector of [[Conway_group|type 2]]. It is thus a subgroup of [[Conway group|Co<sub>0</sub>]]. It is isomorphic to a subgroup of Co<sub>1</sub>. The direct product 2×Co<sub>2</sub> is maximal in Co<sub>0</sub>.\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\n== Representations ==\n\nCo<sub>2</sub> acts as a [[rank 3 permutation group]] on 2300 points. These points can be identified with planar hexagons in the Leech lattice having 6 type 2 vertices.\n\nCo<sub>2</sub> acts on the 23-dimensional even integral lattice with no roots of determinant 4, given as a sublattice of the Leech lattice orthogonal to a norm 4 vector. Over the field with 2 elements it has a 22-dimensional faithful representation; this is the smallest faithful representation over any field.\n\n{{harvtxt|Feit|1974}} showed that if a finite group has an absolutely irreducible faithful rational representation of dimension 23 and has no subgroups of index 23 or 24 then it is contained in either '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × Co<sub>2</sub> or '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × Co<sub>3</sub>.\n\nThe [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>23</sub> is isomorphic to a maximal subgroup of Co<sub>2</sub> and one representation, in permutation matrices, fixes the type 2 vector '''u''' = (-3,1<sup>23</sup>). A block sum ζ of the involution η =\n:<math>\n{\\mathbf 1/2}  \\left ( \\begin{matrix}\n1 &  -1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 &  1 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 &  1 & -1 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{matrix} \\right )\n</math>\nand 5 copies of -η also fixes the same vector. Hence Co<sub>2</sub> has a convenient matrix representation inside the standard representation of Co<sub>0</sub>. The trace of ζ is -8, while the involutions in M<sub>23</sub> have trace 8.\n\nA 24-dimensional block sum of η and -η is in [[Conway group|Co<sub>0</sub>]] if and only if the number of copies of η is odd.\n\nAnother representation fixes the vector '''v''' = (4,-4,0<sup>22</sup>). A monomial and maximal subgroup includes a representation of M<sub>22</sub>:2, where any α interchanging the first 2 co-ordinates restores '''v''' by then negating the vector. Also included are diagonal involutions corresponding to octads (trace 8), 16-sets (trace -8), and dodecads (trace 0). It can be shown that Co<sub>2</sub> has just 3 conjugacy classes of involutions. It should be noted that η leaves (4,-4,0,0) unchanged; the block sum ζ provides a non-monomial generator completing this representation of Co<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThere is an alternate way to construct the stabilizer of '''v'''. Now '''u''' and '''u'''+'''v''' = (1,-3,1<sup>22</sup>) are vertices of a 2-2-2 triangle (vide infra). Then '''u''', '''u'''+'''v''', '''v''', and their negatives form a coplanar hexagon fixed by ζ and M<sub>22</sub>; these generate a group [[Fischer_group#3-transposition_groups|Fi<sub>21</sub>]] ≈ U<sub>6</sub>(2). α (vide supra) extends this to Fi<sub>21</sub>:2, which is maximal in Co<sub>2</sub>. Lastly, Co<sub>0</sub> is transitive on type 2 points, so that a 23-cycle fixing '''u''' has a conjugate fixing '''v''', and the generation is completed.\n\n== Maximal subgroups ==\nSome maximal subgroups fix or reflect 2-dimensional sublattices of the Leech lattice. It is usual to define these planes by [[Conway_group#Sublattice_groups|'''h-k-l triangles''']]: triangles including the origin as a vertex, with edges (differences of vertices) being vectors of types h, k, and l.\n\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|2009}} found the 11 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''Co<sub>2</sub>'' as follows:\n\n* [[Fischer_group#3-transposition_groups|Fi<sub>21</sub>]]:2 ≈ U<sub>6</sub>(2):2 - symmetry/reflection group of coplanar hexagon of 6 type 2 points. Fixes one hexagon in a rank 3 permutation representation of Co<sub>2</sub> on 2300 such hexagons. Under this subgroup the hexagons are split into orbits of 1, 891, and 1408. Fi<sub>21</sub> fixes a 2-2-2 triangle defining the plane.\n* 2<sup>10</sup>:[[Mathieu group M22|M<sub>22</sub>]]:2 has monomial representation described above; 2<sup>10</sup>:[[Mathieu group M22|M<sub>22</sub>]] fixes a 2-2-4 triangle.\n* [[McLaughlin sporadic group|McL]] fixes a 2-2-3 triangle.\n* 2<sup>1+8</sup>:Sp<sub>6</sub>(2) - centralizer of involution class 2A (trace -8)\n* [[Higman–Sims group|HS]]:2 fixes a 2-3-3 triangle or exchanges its type 3 vertices with sign change.\n* (2<sup>4</sup> × 2<sup>1+6</sup>).A<sub>8</sub>\n* U<sub>4</sub>(3):D<sub>8</sub>\n* 2<sup>4+10</sup>.(S<sub>5</sub> × S<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Mathieu group M23|M<sub>23</sub>]] fixes a 2-3-4 triangle.\n* 3<sup>1+4</sup>.2<sup>1+4</sup>.S<sub>5</sub>\n* 5<sup>1+2</sup>:4S<sub>4</sub>\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\nTraces of matrices in a standard 24-dimensional representation of Co<sub>2</sub> are shown.<ref>{{harvtxt|Wilson|1983}}</ref> The names of conjugacy classes are taken from the Atlas of Finite Group Representations. <ref>http://brauer.maths.qmul.ac.uk/Atlas/v3/spor/Co2/#ccls</ref>\n\nCentralizers of unknown structure are indicated with brackets.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

      "text": "{{for|the nilpotent subgroup of a finite group|Fischer subgroup}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}\n\nIn the area of modern algebra known as [[group theory]], the '''Fischer groups''' are the three [[sporadic simple group]]s [[Fischer group Fi22|Fi<sub>22</sub>]], [[Fischer group Fi23|Fi<sub>23</sub>]] and [[Fischer group Fi24|Fi<sub>24</sub>]] introduced by {{harvs|txt |first=Bernd |last=Fischer |authorlink=Bernd Fischer (mathematician) |year1=1971 |year2=1976}}.\n\n== 3-transposition groups ==\n{{main|3-transposition group}}\n\nThe Fischer groups are named after [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]] who discovered them while investigating 3-transposition groups. \nThese are groups ''G'' with the following properties:\n* ''G'' is generated by a [[conjugacy class]] of elements of order 2, called 'Fischer transpositions' or 3-transpositions.\n* The product of any two distinct transpositions has order 2 or 3.\n\nThe typical example of a 3-transposition group is a [[symmetric group]],\nwhere the Fischer transpositions are genuinely transpositions. The symmetric group S<sub>n</sub> can be generated by {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} transpositions: (12), (23), ..., {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1, ''n'')}}.\n\nFischer was able to classify 3-transposition groups that satisfy certain extra technical conditions. The groups he found fell mostly into several infinite classes (besides symmetric groups: certain classes of symplectic, unitary, and orthogonal groups), but he also found 3 very large new groups. These groups are usually referred to as Fi<sub>22</sub>, Fi<sub>23</sub> and Fi<sub>24</sub>. The first two of these are simple groups, and the third contains the simple group Fi<sub>24</sub>′ of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2.\n\nA starting point for the Fischer groups is the unitary group PSU<sub>6</sub>(2), which could be thought of as a group Fi<sub>21</sub> in the series of Fischer groups, of order {{nowrap|1=9,196,830,720 = 2<sup>15</sup>&sdot;3<sup>6</sup>&sdot;5&sdot;7&sdot;11}}. Actually it is the double cover 2.PSU<sub>6</sub>(2) that becomes a subgroup of the new group. This is the stabilizer of one vertex in a graph of 3510 (= 2⋅3<sup>3</sup>⋅5⋅13). These vertices are identified as conjugate 3-transpositions in the symmetry group Fi<sub>22</sub> of the graph.\n\nThe Fischer groups are named by analogy with the large [[Mathieu groups]].  In Fi<sub>22</sub> a maximal set of 3-transpositions all commuting with one another has size 22 and is called a ''basic'' set. There are 1024 3-transpositions, called ''anabasic'' that do not commute with any in the particular basic set. Any one of other 2364, called ''hexadic'', commutes with 6 basic ones. The sets of 6 form an S(3,6,22) [[Steiner system]], whose symmetry group is M<sub>22</sub>. A basic set generates an abelian group of order 2<sup>10</sup>, which extends in Fi<sub>22</sub> to a subgroup 2<sup>10</sup>:M<sub>22</sub>.\n\nThe next Fischer group comes by regarding 2.Fi<sub>22</sub> as a one-point stabilizer for a graph of 31671 (= 3<sup>4</sup>⋅17⋅23) vertices, and treating these vertices as the 3-transpositions in a group Fi<sub>23</sub>. The 3-transpositions come in basic sets of 23, 7 of which commute with a given outside 3-transposition.\n\nNext one takes Fi<sub>23</sub> and treats it as a one-point stabilizer for a graph of 306936 (= 2<sup>3</sup>⋅3<sup>3</sup>⋅7<sup>2</sup>⋅29) vertices to make a group Fi<sub>24</sub>. The 3-transpositions come in basic sets of 24, eight of which commute with a given outside 3-transposition. The group Fi<sub>24</sub> is not simple, but its derived subgroup has index 2 and is a sporadic simple group.\n\n== Notation ==\nThere is no uniformly accepted notation for these groups. Some authors use F in place of Fi (F<sub>22</sub>, for example).\nFischer's notation for them was M(22), M(23) and M(24)′, which emphasised their close relationship with the three largest\n[[Mathieu group]]s, M<sub>22</sub>, M<sub>23</sub> and M<sub>24</sub>.\n\nOne particular source of confusion is that Fi<sub>24</sub> is sometimes used to refer to the simple group Fi<sub>24</sub>′, and is sometimes used to refer to the full 3-transposition group (which is twice the size).\n\n==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==\nConway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that [[monstrous moonshine]] is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln (main or principal moduli) from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{Citation | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | title=3-transposition groups | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-521-57196-8 | year=1997 | volume=124 |url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511759413 | mr=1423599 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511759413}} contains a complete proof of Fischer's theorem.\n*{{Citation | last1=Fischer | first1=Bernd | title=Finite groups generated by 3-transpositions.

It also has two rank 3 actions on 14080 points, exchanged by an outer automorphism.\n\nFi<sub>22</sub> has an irreducible  real representation of dimension 78. Reducing an integral form of this mod 3 gives a representation of Fi<sub>22</sub> over the field with 3 elements, whose quotient by the 1-dimensional space of fixed vectors is a 77-dimensional irreducible representation.\n\nThe perfect triple cover of Fi<sub>22</sub> has an irreducible representation of dimension 27 over the field with 4 elements. This arises from the fact that Fi<sub>22</sub> is a subgroup of ²E₆(2²).\nAll the ordinary and modular character tables of Fi<sub>22</sub> have been computed. {{harvtxt|Hiss|White|1994}} found the 5-modular character table, and {{harvtxt|Noeske|2007}} found the 2- and 3-modular character tables.\n\nThe automorphism group of Fi<sub>22</sub> centralizes an element of order 3 in the [[baby monster]].\n\n==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==\n\nConway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that [[monstrous moonshine]] is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups.

Higman |last2=Sims |first2=Charles C. |author2-link=Charles C. Sims |year=1968}}.  They were attending a presentation by [[Marshall Hall (mathematician)|Marshall Hall]] on the [[Hall–Janko group]] J<sub>2</sub>. It happens that J<sub>2</sub> acts as a permutation group on the [[Hall–Janko graph]] of 100 points, the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of one point being a [[subgroup]] with two other [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of lengths 36 and 63. Inspired by this they decided to check for other rank 3 permutation groups on 100 points. They soon focused on a possible one containing the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>22</sub>, which has [[permutation representation]]s on 22 and 77 points. (The latter representation arises because the M<sub>22</sub> [[Steiner system]] has 77 blocks.) By putting together these two representations, they found HS, with a one-point stabilizer isomorphic to M<sub>22</sub>.\n\nHS is the simple subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] two in the group of automorphisms of the [[Higman–Sims graph]]. The Higman–Sims graph has 100 nodes, so the Higman–Sims group HS is a transitive [[permutation group|group of permutations]] of a 100 element set.\n\n{{harvs|txt|first=Graham |last=Higman|authorlink=Graham Higman|year=1969}} independently discovered the group as a [[doubly transitive permutation group]] acting on a certain 'geometry' on 176 points.\n\n==Relationship to Conway groups==\n{{harvtxt|Conway|1968}} identified the Higman–Sims group as a subgroup of the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>0</sub>. In Co<sub>0</sub> HS arises as a pointwise stabilizer of a [[Conway_group#Sublattice_groups|2-3-3 triangle]], one whose edges (differences of vertices) are type 2 and 3 vectors. HS thus is a subgroup of each of the Conway groups Co<sub>0</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>.\n\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|2009}} (p.&nbsp;208) shows that the group HS is well-defined. In the [[Leech lattice]], suppose a [[Conway group|type 3]] point '''v''' is fixed by an instance of Co<sub>3</sub>. Count the type 2 points '''w''' such that the inner product '''v'''·'''w''' = 2 (and thus '''v'''-'''w''' is type 3). He shows that their number is {{nowrap|1=11,178 = 2&sdot;3<sup>5</sup>&sdot;23}} and that this Co<sub>3</sub> is transitive on these '''w'''.\n\n|HS| = |Co<sub>3</sub>|/11,178 = 44,352,000.\n\nIn fact, {{nowrap|1={{abs|HS}} = 100{{abs|[[Mathieu group M22|M<sub>22</sub>]]}}}} and there are instances of HS including a permutation matrix representation of the Mathieu group M<sub>22</sub>.\n\nIf an instance of HS in Co<sub>0</sub> fixes a particular point of type 3, this point is found in 276 triangles of type 2-2-3, which this copy of HS permutes in orbits of 176 and 100. This fact leads to Graham Higman's construction as well as to the Higman–Sims graph.\n \nA 2-3-3 triangle defines a 2-dimensional subspace fixed pointwise by HS. The standard representation of HS can thus be reduced to a 22-dimensional one.\n\n===A Higman-Sims graph===\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|2009}} (p.&nbsp;210) gives an example of a Higman-Sims graph within the [[Leech lattice]], permuted by the representation of M<sub>22</sub> on the last 22 coordinates:\n* 22 points of shape (1, 1, −3, 1<sup>21</sup>)\n* 77 points of shape (2, 2, 2<sup>6</sup>, 0<sup>16</sup>)\n* A 100th point (4, 4, 0<sup>22</sup>)\n\nDifferences of adjacent points are of type 3; those of non-adjacent ones are of type 2.\n\nHere, HS fixes a 2-3-3 triangle with vertices {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (5, 1<sup>23</sup>)}}, {{nowrap|1='''y''' = (1, 5, 1<sup>22</sup>)}}, and '''z''' the origin. '''x''' and '''y''' are of type 3 while {{nowrap|1='''x'''-'''y''' = (4, −4, 0<sup>22</sup>)}} is of type 2. Any vertex of the graph differs from '''x''', '''y''', and '''z''' by vectors of type 2.\n\n===Two classes of involutions===\nAn involution in the subgroup M<sub>22</sub> transposes 8 pairs of co-ordinates. As a permutation matrix in Co<sub>0</sub> it has trace 8. It can shown that it moves 80 of the 100 vertices of the Higman-Sims graph. No transposed pair of vertices is an [[Graph theory|edge]] in the graph.\n\nThere is another class of involutions, of trace 0, that move all 100 vertices.<ref>Wilson (2009), p. 213</ref> As permutations in the alternating group A<sub>100</sub>, being products of an odd number (25) of double transpositions, these involutions lift to elements of order 4 in the [[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover]] 2.A<sub>100</sub>.

      "text": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:II<sub>25,1</sub>}}\nIn mathematics, '''II<sub>25,1</sub>''' is the even 26-dimensional Lorentzian [[unimodular lattice]]. It has several unusual properties, arising from Conway's discovery  that it has a norm zero [[Weyl vector]]. In particular it is closely related to the [[Leech lattice]] Λ, and has the [[Conway group Co1]] at the top of its automorphism group.\n\n==Construction==\n\nWrite ''R''<sup>m,n</sup> for the ''m+n'' dimensional vector space\n''R''<sup>m+n</sup> with the inner product of \n(''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>m+n</sub>) and (''b''<sub>1</sub>,...,''b''<sub>m+n</sub>) given by\n:''a''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>1</sub>+...+''a''<sub>m</sub>''b''<sub>m</sub> &minus; ''a''<sub>m+1</sub>''b''<sub>m+1</sub> &minus; ... &minus; ''a''<sub>m+n</sub>''b''<sub>m+n</sub>.\nThe lattice ''II<sub>25,1</sub>'' is given by all vectors (''a''<sub>1</sub>,...,''a''<sub>26</sub>)\nin ''R''<sup>25,1</sup> such that either all the ''a<sub>i</sub>''  are integers or they are all integers\nplus 1/2, and  their sum is even.\n\n==Reflection group==\n\nThe lattice II<sub>25,1</sub> is isomorphic to Λ⊕H where:\n*Λ is the [[Leech lattice]],\n*H is the 2-dimensional even Lorentzian lattice, generated by 2 norm 0 vectors ''z'' and ''w'' with inner product –1,\nand the two summands are orthogonal.  So we can write vectors of II<sub>25,1</sub> as (λ,''m'', ''n'') = λ+''mz''+''nw'' with λ in Λ and ''m'',''n'' integers, where (λ,''m'', ''n'') has norm λ<sup>2</sup> –2''mn''.  To give explicitly the isomorphism, let <math>w = (0,1,2,3,\\dots,22,23,24; 70)</math>, and <math>z = (1,0,2,3,\\dots,22,23,24; 70)</math>, so that the subspace <math>H</math> generated by <math>w</math> and <math>z</math> is the 2-dimensional even Lorentzian lattice.  Then <math>H^\\perp</math> is isomorphic to <math>w^\\perp/w</math> and we recover one of the definitions of Λ.\n\nConway showed that the roots (norm 2 vectors) having inner product –1 with ''w''=(0,0,1) are the simple roots of the reflection group. These are the vectors (λ,1,λ<sup>2</sup>/2–1) for λ in the Leech lattice. In other words, the simple roots can be identified with the points of the Leech lattice, and moreover this is an isometry from the set of simple roots to the Leech lattice.\n\nThe reflection group is a hyperbolic reflection group acting on 25-dimensional hyperbolic space.\nThe fundamental domain of the reflection group has 1+23+284 orbits of vertices as follows:\n*One vertex at infinity corresponding to the norm 0 Weyl vector.\n*23 orbits of vertices at infinity meeting a finite number of faces of the fundamental domain. These vertices correspond to the deep holes of the Leech lattice, and there are 23 orbits of these corresponding to the 23 Niemeier lattices other than the Leech lattice. The simple roots meeting one of these vertices form an affine Dynkin diagram of rank 24.\n*284 orbits of vertices in hyperbolic space. These correspond to the 284 orbits of shallow holes of the Leech lattice. The simple roots meeting any of these vertices form a spherical Dynkin diagram of rank 25.\n\n==Automorphism group==\n\n{{harvtxt|Conway|1983}} described the automorphism group Aut(II<sub>25,1</sub>) of II<sub>25,1</sub> as follows. \n* First of all, Aut(II<sub>25,1</sub>) is the product of a group of order 2 generated by –1 by the index 2 subgroup Aut<sup>+</sup>(II<sub>25,1</sub>) of automorphisms preserving the direction of time.\n* The group Aut<sup>+</sup>(II<sub>25,1</sub>) has a normal subgroup Ref generated by its reflections, whose simple roots correspond to the Leech lattice vectors.\n*The group Aut<sup>+</sup>(II<sub>25,1</sub>)/Ref is isomorphic to the group of affine automorphisms of the Leech lattice Λ, and so has a normal subgroup of translations isomorphic to Λ='''Z'''<sup>24</sup>, and the quotient is isomorphic to the group of all automorphisms of the Leech lattice, which is a double cover of the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>1</sub>, a sporadic simple group.\n\n==Vectors==\n\nEvery non-zero vector of II<sub>25,1</sub> can be written uniquely as a positive integer multiple of a primitive vector, so to classify all vectors it is sufficient to classify the primitive vectors.\n\n===Positive norm vectors===\n\nAny two positive norm primitive vectors with the same norm are conjugate under the automorphism group.\n\n===Norm zero vectors===\n\nThere are 24 orbits of primitive norm 0 vectors, corresponding to the 24 [[Niemeier lattices]]. The correspondence is given as follows: if ''z'' is a norm 0 vector, then the lattice ''z''<sup>⊥</sup>/''z'' is a 24-dimensional even unimodular lattice and is therefore one of the Niemeier lattices.\n\nThe Niemeier lattice corresponding to the norm 0 Weyl vector of the reflection group of II<sub>25,1</sub> is the Leech lattice.\n\n===Norm –2 vectors===\n\nThere are 121 orbits of vectors ''v'' of norm –2, corresponding to the 121 isomorphism classes of 25-dimensional even lattices ''L'' of determinant 2. In this correspondence, the lattice ''L'' is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of the vector ''v''.\n\n===Norm –4 vectors===\n\nThere are 665 orbits of vectors ''v'' of norm –4, corresponding to the 665 isomorphism classes of 25-dimensional [[unimodular lattice]]s ''L''. In this correspondence, the index 2 sublattice of the even vectors of the lattice ''L'' is isomorphic to the orthogonal complement of the vector ''v''.\n\n===Other vectors===\n\nThere are similar but increasingly complicated descriptions of the vectors of norm –2''n'' for ''n''=3, 4, 5, ..., and the number of orbits of such vectors increases quite rapidly.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | title=The automorphism group of the 26-dimensional even unimodular Lorentzian lattice | doi=10.1016/0021-8693(83)90025-X | mr=690711 | year=1983 | journal=[[Journal of Algebra]] | issn=0021-8693 | volume=80 | issue=1 | pages=159–163}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Parker | first2=R.

Griess]] showed that ''J<sub>1</sub>'' cannot be a [[subquotient]] of the [[monster group]].<ref>Griess (1982): p. 93: proof that  J<sub>1</sub> is a pariah.</ref>  Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the [[pariah group|pariahs]].\n\n''J<sub>1</sub>'' has no [[outer automorphism group|outer automorphisms]] and its [[Schur multiplier]] is trivial.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nJ<sub>1</sub> can be characterized abstractly as the unique [[simple group]] with abelian [[Sylow theorems|2-Sylow]] subgroups and with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] whose [[centralizer]] is isomorphic to the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of the group of order two and the [[alternating group]] A<sub>5</sub> of order 60, which is to say, the [[Icosahedral symmetry|rotational icosahedral group]]. That was Janko's original conception of the group.\nIn fact Janko and [[John G. Thompson|Thompson]] were investigating groups similar to the [[Ree group]]s <sup>2</sup>''G''<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>), and showed that if a simple group ''G'' has abelian Sylow 2-subgroups and a centralizer of an involution of the form '''Z'''/2'''Z'''&times;''PSL''<sub>2</sub>(''q'') for ''q'' a prime power at least 3, then either\n''q'' is a power of 3 and ''G'' has the same order as a Ree group (it was later shown that ''G'' must be a Ree group in this case) or ''q'' is 4 or 5. Note that ''PSL''<sub>2</sub>(''4'')=''PSL''<sub>2</sub>(''5'')=''A''<sub>5</sub>. This last exceptional case led to the Janko group J<sub>1</sub>.\n\nJ<sub>1</sub> is contained in the [[O'Nan group]] as the subgroup of elements fixed by an outer automorphism of order 2.\n\n==Construction==\nJanko found a [[modular representation]] in terms of 7 &times; 7 [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] in the [[finite field|field of eleven elements]], with generators given by\n:<math>{\\mathbf Y} = \\left ( \\begin{matrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{matrix} \\right )</math>\nand\n:<math>{\\mathbf Z} = \\left ( \\begin{matrix}\n-3 & +2 & -1 & -1 & -3 & -1 & -3 \\\\\n-2 & +1 & +1 & +3 & +1 & +3 & +3 \\\\\n-1 & -1 & -3 & -1 & -3 & -3 & +2 \\\\\n-1 & -3 & -1 & -3 & -3 & +2 & -1 \\\\\n-3 & -1 & -3 & -3 & +2 & -1 & -1 \\\\\n+1 & +3 & +3 & -2 & +1 & +1 & +3 \\\\\n+3 & +3 & -2 & +1 & +1 & +3 & +1 \\end{matrix} \\right ).</math>\n'''Y''' has order 7 and '''Z''' has order 5. Janko (1966) credited W. A. Coppel for recognizing this representation as an embedding into [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|Dickson's]] simple group [[Group of Lie type|''G''<sub>2</sub>(11)]] (which has a 7-dimensional representation over the field with 11 elements).\n\nThere is also a pair of generators a, b such that\n\n:a<sup>2</sup>=b<sup>3</sup>=(ab)<sup>7</sup>=(abab<sup>−1</sup>)<sup>10</sup>=1\n\nJ<sub>1</sub> is thus a [[Hurwitz group]], a finite homomorphic image of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]].\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nJanko (1966) found the 7 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''J<sub>1</sub>'' shown in the table. Maximal simple subgroups of order 660 afford ''J<sub>1</sub>'' a [[permutation representation]] of degree 266. He found that there are 2 conjugacy classes of subgroups isomorphic to the [[alternating group]] A<sub>5</sub>, both found in the simple subgroups of order 660.  ''J<sub>1</sub>'' has non-abelian simple proper subgroups of only 2 isomorphism types.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Structure\n! Order\n! Index\n!

In 1969 [[Zvonimir Janko]] predicted J<sub>2</sub> as one of two new simple groups having 2<sup>1+4</sup>:A<sub>5</sub> as a centralizer of an involution (the other is the [[Janko group J3]]). It was constructed by {{harvs|txt |authorlink=Marshall Hall (mathematician) |last1=Hall |last2=Wales |year=1968}} as a [[rank 3 permutation group]] on 100 points.\n\nBoth the [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] have order 2. As a permutation group on 100 points J<sub>2</sub> has [[involution (mathematics)#group theory|involutions]] moving all 100 points and involutions moving just 80 points. The former involutions are \nproducts of 25 double transportions, an odd number number, and hence lift to 4-elements in the [[Covering_groups_of_the_alternating_and_symmetric_groups|double cover]] 2.A<sub>100</sub>. The double cover 2.J<sub>2</sub> occurs as a [[Conway_group#Suzuki_chain_of_product_groups|subgroup]] of the Conway group Co<sub>0</sub>.\n\nJ<sub>2</sub> is the only one of the 4 Janko groups that is a [[subquotient]] of the [[monster group]]; it is thus part of what [[Robert Griess]] calls the Happy Family. Since it is also found in the [[Conway group Co1]], it is therefore part of the second generation of the Happy Family.\n\n== Representations ==\n\nIt is a subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] two of the group of automorphisms of the [[Hall–Janko graph]], leading to a permutation representation of degree 100. It is also a subgroup of index two of the group of automorphisms of the Hall–Janko [[Near Polygon|Near Octagon]],<ref>http://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/graphs/HJ315.html</ref> leading to a permutation representation of degree 315.\n\nIt has a [[modular representation]] of dimension six over the field of four elements; if in [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] two we have\n''w''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''w''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, then J<sub>2</sub> is generated by the two matrices\n\n:<math>\n{\\mathbf A} = \\left ( \\begin{matrix}\nw^2 & w^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n1 & w^2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n1 & 1 & w^2 & w^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \nw & 1 & 1 & w^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & w^2 & w^2 & w^2 & 0 & w \\\\ \nw^2 & 1 & w^2 & 0 & w^2 & 0 \\end{matrix} \\right )\n</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\n{\\mathbf B} = \\left ( \\begin{matrix}\nw & 1 & w^2 & 1 & w^2 & w^2 \\\\ \nw & 1 & w & 1 & 1 & w \\\\ \nw & w & w^2 & w^2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ \n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ \nw^2 & 1 & w^2 & w^2 & w & w^2 \\\\ \nw^2 & 1 & w^2 & w & w^2 & w \\end{matrix} \\right ).\n</math>\n\nThese matrices satisfy the equations\n\n:<math>\n{\\mathbf A}^2 = {\\mathbf B}^3 = ({\\mathbf A}{\\mathbf B})^7 = \n({\\mathbf A}{\\mathbf B}{\\mathbf A}{\\mathbf B}{\\mathbf B})^{12} = 1.\n</math>\n\nJ<sub>2</sub> is thus a [[Hurwitz group]], a finite homomorphic image of the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]].\n\nThe matrix representation given above constitutes an embedding into [[Leonard Eugene Dickson|Dickson's]] group [[Group of Lie type|''G''<sub>2</sub>(4)]]. There are two conjugacy classes of HJ in G<sub>2</sub>(4), and they are equivalent under the automorphism on the field F<sub>4</sub>. Their intersection (the \"real\" subgroup) is simple of order 6048. G<sub>2</sub>(4) is in turn isomorphic to a subgroup of the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>1</sub>.\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nThere are 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''J<sub>2</sub>''. Some are here described in terms of action on the Hall–Janko graph.\n\n* U<sub>3</sub>(3) order 6048 – one-point stabilizer, with orbits of 36 and 63\n:Simple, containing 36 simple subgroups of order 168 and 63 involutions, all conjugate, each moving 80 points.

      "text": "{{for|general background and history of the Janko sporadic groups|Janko group}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Janko group J<sub>4</sub>}}\n{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}\n\nIn the area of modern algebra known as [[group theory]], the '''Janko group''' ''J<sub>4</sub>'' is a [[sporadic simple group]] of [[Order (group theory)|order]]\n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>21</sup>{{·}}3<sup>3</sup>{{·}}5{{·}}7{{·}}11<sup>3</sup>{{·}}23{{·}}29{{·}}31{{·}}37{{·}}43\n: = 86775571046077562880\n: ≈ 9{{e|19}}.\n\n==History==\n''J<sub>4</sub>'' is one of the 26 [[Sporadic group]]s.  [[Zvonimir Janko]] found  J<sub>4</sub> in 1975 by studying groups with an involution centralizer of the form 2<sup>1 + 12</sup>.3.(M<sub>22</sub>:2).  Its existence and uniqueness was shown using computer calculations by [[Simon P. Norton]] and others in 1980.   It has a [[modular representation]] of dimension 112 over the [[finite field]] with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square, a fact which Norton used to construct it, and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally. {{harvtxt|Aschbacher|Segev|1991}} and  {{harvtxt|Ivanov|1992}} gave computer-free proofs of uniqueness. {{harvtxt|Ivanov|Meierfrankenfeld|1999}} and {{harvtxt|Ivanov|2004}} gave a computer-free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups  2<sup>10</sup>:SL<sub>5</sub>(2) and (2<sup>10</sup>:2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>8</sub>):2 over a group 2<sup>10</sup>:2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>8</sub>.\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\nSince  37 and 43 are not [[supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular]] primes, ''J<sub>4</sub>'' cannot be a [[subquotient]] of the [[monster group]]. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the [[pariah group|pariahs]].\n\n==Representations==\n\nThe smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333; there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension. The smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements.\n\nThe smallest permutation representation is on 173067389 points, with point stabilizer of the form 2<sup>11</sup>M<sub>24</sub>. These points can be identified with certain \"special vectors\" in the 112 dimensional representation.\n\n==Presentation==\n\nIt has a presentation in terms of three generators a, b, and c as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\na^2 &=b^3=c^2=(ab)^{23}=[a,b]^{12}=[a,bab]^5=[c,a]= \\left ((ab)^2ab^{-1} \\right)^3 \\left (ab(ab^{-1})^2 \\right)^3=\\left (ab \\left (abab^{-1} \\right )^3 \\right )^4 \\\\\n&=\\left [c,(ba)^2 b^{-1}ab^{-1} (ab)^3 \\right]= \\left (bc^{(bab^{-1}a)^2} \\right )^3= \\left ((bababab)^3 c c^{(ab)^3b(ab)^6b} \\right )^2=1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\n{{harvtxt|Kleidman|Wilson|1988}} found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''J<sub>4</sub>'' as follows:\n\n* 2<sup>11</sup>:M<sub>24</sub> - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups; also containing 2<sup>11</sup>:(M<sub>22</sub>:2), centralizer of involution of class 2B\n* 2<sup>1+12</sup>.3.(M<sub>22</sub>:2) - centralizer of involution of class 2A - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups\n* 2<sup>10</sup>:PSL(5,2)\n* 2<sup>3+12</sup>.(S<sub>5</sub> × PSL(3,2)) - containing Sylow 2-subgroups\n* U<sub>3</sub>(11):2\n* M<sub>22</sub>:2\n* 11<sup>1+2</sup>:(5 × GL(2,3)) - normalizer of Sylow 11-subgroup\n* PSL(2,32):5\n* PGL(2,23)\n* U<sub>3</sub>(3) - containing Sylow 3-subgroups\n* 29:28 Frobenius group\n* 43:14 Frobenius group\n* 37:12 Frobenius group\nA Sylow 3-subgroup is a [[Heisenberg group]]: order 27, non-abelian, all non-trivial elements of order 3.\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Segev | first2=Yoav | title=The uniqueness of groups of type J₄ | doi=10.1007/BF01232280 |mr=1117152 | year=1991 | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | issn=0020-9910 | volume=105 | issue=3 | pages=589–607}}\n*D.J.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Leech lattice''' is an even [[unimodular lattice]] Λ<sub>24</sub> in 24-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], which is one of the best models for the [[kissing number problem]]. It was discovered by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Leech (mathematician)|first=John|last= Leech|year=1967}}. It may also have been discovered (but not published) by [[Ernst Witt]] in 1940.\n\n==Characterization==\n\nThe Leech lattice Λ<sub>24</sub> is the unique lattice in [[Euclidean space|{{math|'''E'''<sup>24</sup>}}]] with the following list of properties:\n\n*It is [[unimodular lattice|unimodular]]; i.e., it can be generated by the columns of a certain 24&times;24 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] with [[determinant]]&nbsp;1.\n*It is even; i.e., the square of the length of each vector in Λ<sub>24</sub> is an even integer.\n*The length of every non-zero vector in Λ<sub>24</sub> is at least 2.\n\nThe last condition is equivalent to the condition that unit balls centered at the points of Λ<sub>24</sub> do not overlap.  Each is tangent to 196,560 neighbors, and this is known to be the largest number of non-overlapping 24-dimensional unit balls that can simultaneously touch a single unit ball (compare with 6 in dimension 2, as the maximum number of pennies which can touch a central penny; see [[kissing number]]). This arrangement of 196,560 unit balls centred about another unit ball is so efficient that there is no room to move any of the balls; this configuration, together with its mirror-image, is the ''only'' 24-dimensional arrangement where 196,560 unit balls simultaneously touch another. This property is also true in 1, 2 and 8 dimensions, with 2, 6 and 240 unit balls, respectively, based on the [[integer lattice]], [[hexagonal tiling]] and [[E8 lattice]], respectively.\n\nIt has no [[root system]] and in fact is the first [[unimodular lattice]] with no ''roots'' (vectors of norm less than 4), and therefore has a centre density of 1. By multiplying this value by the volume of a unit ball in 24 dimensions, <math>\\tfrac{\\pi^{12}}{12!}</math>, one can derive its absolute density.\n\n{{harvtxt|Conway|1983}} showed that the Leech lattice is isometric  to the set of simple roots (or the [[Dynkin diagram]]) of the [[reflection group]] of the 26-dimensional even Lorentzian unimodular lattice [[II25,1|II<sub>25,1</sub>]]. By comparison, the Dynkin diagrams of II<sub>9,1</sub> and II<sub>17,1</sub> are finite.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe [[binary Golay code]], independently developed in 1949, is an application in [[coding theory]]. More specifically, it is an error-correcting code capable of correcting up to three errors in each 24-bit word, and detecting a fourth. It was used to communicate with the [[Voyager probes]], as it is much more compact than the previously-used [[Hadamard code]].\n\n[[Quantizer]]s, or [[analog-to-digital converter]]s, can use lattices to minimise the average [[root-mean-square]] error. Most quantizers are based on the one-dimensional [[integer lattice]], but using multi-dimensional lattices reduces the RMS error. The Leech lattice is a good solution to this problem, as the [[Voronoi cell]]s have a low [[second moment]].\n\nThe [[vertex algebra]] of the [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] describing [[bosonic string theory]], compactified on the 24-dimensional [[quotient group|quotient]] [[torus]] '''R'''<sup>24</sup>/Λ<sub>24</sub> and [[orbifold]]ed by a two-element reflection group, provides an explicit construction of the [[Griess algebra]] that has the [[monster group]] as its automorphism group. This '''[[monster vertex algebra]]''' was also used to prove the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjectures.\n\n==Constructions==\n\nThe Leech lattice can be constructed in a variety of ways. As with all lattices, it can be constructed by taking the [[integer|integral]] span of the columns of its [[generator matrix]], a 24&times;24 matrix with [[determinant]] 1.\n\n{{hidden | Leech generator matrix |\nA 24x24 generator (in row convention) for the Leech Lattice is given by the following matrix divided by <math>\\sqrt{8}</math>:\n <nowiki>\n 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n 2 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0\n 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0\n−3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n</nowiki>\n}}<ref>{{citation | zbl=0915.52003 | last1=Conway | first1=J.H. | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Sloane | first2=N.J.A. | author2-link=Neil Sloane | others=With contributions by Bannai, E.; Borcherds, R.

The Golay code, together with the related Witt design, features in a construction for the 196560 minimal vectors in the Leech lattice.\n\n===Using the Lorentzian lattice II<sub>25,1</sub>===\n\nThe Leech lattice can also be constructed as <math>w^\\perp/w</math> where ''w'' is the Weyl vector:\n\n:<math>(0,1,2,3,\\dots,22,23,24; 70)</math>\n\nin the 26-dimensional even Lorentzian [[unimodular lattice]] [[II25,1|II<sub>25,1</sub>]]. The existence of such an integral vector of norm zero relies on the fact that 1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 24<sup>2</sup> is a [[square number|perfect square]] (in fact 70<sup>2</sup>); the [[number 24]] is the only integer bigger than 1 with this property. This was conjectured by [[Édouard Lucas]], but the proof came much later, based on [[elliptic functions]].\n\nThe vector\n<math>(0,1,2,3,\\dots,22,23,24)</math>\nin this construction is really the [[Weyl vector]] of the even sublattice ''D''<sub>24</sub> of the odd unimodular lattice ''I''<sup>25</sup>. More generally, if ''L'' is any positive definite unimodular lattice of dimension 25 with at least 4 vectors of norm 1, then the Weyl vector of its norm 2 roots has integral length, and there is a similar construction of the Leech lattice using ''L'' and this Weyl vector.\n\n===Based on other lattices===\n\n{{harvtxt|Conway|Sloane|1982}} described another 23 constructions for the Leech lattice, each based on a [[Niemeier lattice]]. It can also be constructed by using three copies of the [[E8 lattice]], in the same way that the binary Golay code can be constructed using three copies of the extended [[Hamming code]], H<sub>8</sub>. This construction is known as the '''Turyn''' construction of the Leech lattice.\n\n===As a laminated lattice===\n\nStarting with a single point, Λ<sub>0</sub>, one can stack copies of the lattice Λ<sub>n</sub> to form an (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional lattice, Λ<sub>''n''+1</sub>, without reducing the minimal distance between points. Λ<sub>1</sub> corresponds to the [[integer lattice]], Λ<sub>2</sub> is to the [[hexagonal lattice]], and Λ<sub>3</sub> is the [[face-centered cubic]] packing. {{harvtxt|Conway|Sloane|1982b}} showed that the Leech lattice is the unique laminated lattice in 24 dimensions.\n\n===As a complex lattice===\n\nThe Leech lattice is also a 12-dimensional lattice over the [[Eisenstein integers]]. This is known as the '''complex Leech lattice''', and is isomorphic to the 24-dimensional real Leech lattice. In the complex construction of the Leech lattice, the [[binary Golay code]] is replaced with the [[ternary Golay code]], and the [[Mathieu group M24|Mathieu group ''M''<sub>24</sub>]] is replaced with the [[Mathieu group M12|Mathieu group ''M''<sub>12</sub>]]. The ''E''<sub>6</sub> lattice, ''E''<sub>8</sub> lattice and [[Coxeter&ndash;Todd lattice]] also have constructions as complex lattices, over either the Eisenstein or [[Gaussian integers]].\n\n===Using the icosian ring===\n\nThe Leech lattice can also be constructed using the ring of [[icosian]]s. The icosian ring is abstractly isomorphic to the [[E8 lattice]], three copies of which can be used to construct the Leech lattice using the Turyn construction.\n\n===Witt's construction===\n\nIn 1972 Witt gave the following construction, which he said he found in 1940 January 28. Suppose that ''H'' is an ''n'' by ''n'' [[Hadamard matrix]], where ''n''=4''ab''. Then the matrix <math>\\begin{pmatrix} Ia&H/2\\\\H/2&Ib\\end{pmatrix}</math> defines a bilinear form in 2''n'' dimensions, whose kernel has ''n'' dimensions. The quotient by this kernel is a nonsinguar bilinear form taking values in (1/2)'''Z'''. It has 3 sublattices of index 2 that are integral bilinear forms. Witt obtained the Leech lattice as one of these three sublattices by taking ''a''=2, ''b''=3, and taking ''H'' to be the 24 by 24 matrix (indexed by '''Z'''/23'''Z''' ∪ ∞) with entries Χ(''m''+''n'') where Χ(∞)=1, Χ(0)=−1, Χ(''n'')=is the quadratic residue symbol mod 23 for nonzero ''n''. This matrix ''H'' is a [[Paley matrix]] with some insignificant sign changes.\n\n===Using a Paley matrix===\n\n{{harvtxt|Chapman|2001}} described a construction using a\n[[Hadamard matrix#Skew Hadamard matrices|skew Hadamard matrix]] of [[Paley matrix|Paley]] type.\nThe [[Niemeier lattice]] with root system <math>D_{24}</math> can be made into a module\nfor the ring of integers of the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-23})</math>. Multiplying this\nNiemeier lattice by a non-principal ideal of the ring of integers gives the Leech lattice.\n\n===Using octonions===\nIf ''L'' is the set of [[Octonion|octonions]] with coordinates on the <math>E_8</math> lattice, then the Leech lattice is the set of triplets <math>(x,y,z)</math> such that\n\n:<math>x,y,z \\in L</math>\n\n:<math>x+y, y+z, x+z \\in L\\bar{s}</math>\n\n:<math>x+y+z \\in Ls</math>\n\nwhere <math>s\\bar{s}=\\frac 1 2 (s_x\\bar{s}_x+s_y\\bar{s}_y+s_z\\bar{s}_z)=2</math>.\n\n==Symmetries==\n\nThe Leech lattice is highly symmetrical.  Its [[automorphism group]] is the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>0</sub>, which is of order  8&nbsp;315&nbsp;553&nbsp;613&nbsp;086&nbsp;720&nbsp;000.  The center of Co<sub>0</sub> has two elements, and the quotient of Co<sub>0</sub> by this center is the Conway group Co<sub>1</sub>, a finite simple group.  Many other [[sporadic group]]s, such as the remaining Conway groups and [[Mathieu groups]], can be constructed as the stabilizers of various configurations of vectors in the Leech lattice.\n\nDespite having such a high ''rotational'' symmetry group, the Leech lattice does not possess any hyperplanes of reflection symmetry. In other words, the Leech lattice is [[chiral]]. It also has far fewer symmetries than the 24-dimensional hypercube and simplex.\n\nThe automorphism group was first described by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. The 398034000 vectors of norm 8 fall into 8292375 'crosses' of 48 vectors. Each cross contains 24 mutually orthogonal vectors and their negatives, and thus describe the vertices of a 24-dimensional [[orthoplex]]. Each of these crosses can be taken to be the coordinate system of the lattice, and has the same symmetry of the [[Binary Golay code|Golay code]], namely 2<sup>12</sup> &times; |M<sub>24</sub>|. Hence the full automorphism group of the Leech lattice has order 8292375 &times; 4096 &times; 244823040, or 8&nbsp;315&nbsp;553&nbsp;613&nbsp;086&nbsp;720&nbsp;000.\n\n==Geometry==\n\n{{harvtxt|Conway|Parker|Sloane|1982}} showed that the covering radius of the Leech lattice is <math>\\sqrt 2</math>; in other words, if we put a closed ball of this radius around each lattice point, then these just cover Euclidean space. The points at distance at least <math>\\sqrt 2</math> from all lattice points are called the '''''deep holes''''' of the Leech lattice. There are 23 orbits of them under the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and these orbits correspond to the 23 [[Niemeier lattices]] other than the Leech lattice: the set of vertices of  deep hole is isometric to the affine Dynkin diagram of the corresponding Niemeier lattice.\n\nThe Leech lattice has a density of <math>\\tfrac{\\pi^{12}}{12!}\\approx 0.001930\\ldots</math>. {{harvtxt|Cohn|Kumar|2009}} showed that it gives the densest lattice [[sphere packing|packing of balls]] in 24-dimensional space. {{harvs|txt|title=The sphere packing problem in dimension 24|\nfirst1=Henry|last1= Cohn|first2= Abhinav|last2= Kumar|first3= Stephen D. |last3=Miller|first4= Danylo |last4=Radchenko|first5= Maryna |last5=Viazovska|year=2016|arxiv=1603.06518}} improved this by showing that it is the densest sphere packing, even among non-lattice packings.\n\nThe 196560 minimal vectors are of three different varieties, known as ''shapes'':\n\n* 1104 vectors of shape (4<sup>2</sup>,0<sup>22</sup>), for all permutations and sign choices;\n* 97152 vectors of shape (2<sup>8</sup>,0<sup>16</sup>), where the '2's correspond to octads in the Golay code, and there is an even number of minus signs;\n* 98304 vectors of shape (-3,1<sup>23</sup>), where the changes of signs come from the Golay code, and the '3' can appear in any position.\n\nThe [[ternary Golay code]], [[binary Golay code]] and Leech lattice give very efficient 24-dimensional [[spherical code]]s of 729, 4096 and 196560 points, respectively. Spherical codes are higher-dimensional analogues of [[Tammes problem]], which arose as an attempt to explain the distribution of pores on pollen grains. These are distributed as to maximise the minimal angle between them. In two dimensions, the problem is trivial, but in three dimensions and higher it is not. An example of a spherical code in three dimensions is the set of the 12 vertices of the regular icosahedron.\n\n==Theta series==\n\nOne can associate to any (positive-definite) lattice Λ a [[theta function]] given by\n\n:<math>\\Theta_\\Lambda(\\tau) = \\sum_{x\\in\\Lambda} e^{i\\pi\\tau\\|x\\|^2} \\qquad \\operatorname{Im} \\tau > 0.</math>\n\nThe theta function of a lattice is then a [[holomorphic function]] on the [[upper half-plane]]. Furthermore, the theta function of an even unimodular lattice of rank ''n'' is actually a [[modular form]] of weight ''n''/2 for the full [[modular group]] ''PSL''(2,'''Z'''). The theta function of an integral lattice is often written as a power series in <math>q = e^{2i\\pi\\tau}</math> so that the coefficient of ''q''<sup>''n''</sup> gives the number of lattice vectors of squared norm 2''n''. In the Leech lattice, there are 196560 vectors of squared norm 4, 16773120 vectors of squared norm 6, 398034000 vectors of squared norm 8 and so on. The theta series of the Leech lattice is\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Theta_{\\Lambda_{24}}(\\tau) & = E_{12}(\\tau)-\\frac{65520}{691} \\Delta(\\tau) \\\\[5pt]\n& = 1 + \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{65520}{691} \\left(\\sigma_{11} (m) - \\tau (m) \\right) q^m \\\\[5pt]\n& = 1 + 196560q^2 + 16773120q^3 + 398034000q^4 + \\cdots,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_{12}(\\tau)</math> is the normalized [[Eisenstein series]] of weight 12, <math>\\Delta(\\tau)</math> is the [[modular discriminant]], <math>\\sigma_{11}(n)</math> is the [[divisor function]] for exponent 11, and <math>\\tau(n)</math> is the [[Ramanujan tau function]]. It follows that for ''m''≥1 the number of vectors of squared norm 2''m'' is\n\n: <math> \\frac{65520}{691} \\left(\\sigma_{11} (m) - \\tau (m) \\right).</math>\n\n==History==\nMany of the cross-sections of the Leech lattice, including the [[Coxeter&ndash;Todd lattice]] and [[Barnes&ndash;Wall lattice]], in 12 and 16 dimensions, were found much earlier than the Leech lattice. {{harvtxt|O'Connor|Pall|1944}} discovered a related odd unimodular lattice in 24 dimensions, now called the odd Leech lattice, one of whose two even neighbors is the Leech lattice. The  Leech lattice was discovered in 1965 by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Leech (mathematician)|first=John|last= Leech|year=1967|loc=2.31, p. 262}}, by improving some earlier sphere packings he found {{harv|Leech|1964}}.\n\n{{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Horton Conway|last=Conway|year=1968}} calculated the order of the automorphism group of the Leech lattice, and, working with [[John G. Thompson]], discovered three new [[sporadic group]]s as a by-product: the [[Conway groups]], Co<sub>1</sub>, Co<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>. They also showed that four other (then) recently announced sporadic groups, namely, [[Higman-Sims group|Higman-Sims]], [[Suzuki sporadic group|Suzuki]], [[McLaughlin group (mathematics)|McLaughlin]], and the [[Janko group]] J<sub>2</sub> could be found inside the Conway groups using the geometry of the Leech lattice.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the [[classification of finite simple groups]] states that every [[Finite group|finite]] [[simple group]] is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], or [[alternating group|alternating]], or in one of 16 families of [[groups of Lie type]], or one of 26 [[sporadic group]]s.\n\nThe list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their [[order (group theory)|order]], the size of the [[Schur multiplier]], the size of the [[outer automorphism group]], usually some small [[group representation|representations]], and lists of all duplicates.\n\n== Summary ==\n\nThe following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A<sub>8</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''<sub>3</sub>(2) and ''A''<sub>2</sub>(4) both have order 20160, and that the group ''B<sub>n</sub>''(''q'') has the same order as  ''C<sub>n</sub>''(''q'') for ''q'' odd, ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are ''B''<sub>3</sub>(3) and ''C''<sub>3</sub>(3) which both have order 4585351680.)\n\nThere is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups A<sub>''n''</sub> and the groups of Lie type ''A<sub>n</sub>''(''q'').  Some authors use various different fonts for A<sub>''n''</sub> to distinguish them.  In particular,\nin this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups A<sub>''n''</sub> in Roman font and the Lie-type groups ''A<sub>n</sub>''(''q'') in italic.\n\nIn what follows, ''n'' is a positive integer, and ''q'' is a positive power of a prime number ''p'', with the restrictions noted. The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class !! Family !! Order !! Exclusions !!

Lyons characterized 51765179004000000 as the unique possible order of any finite simple group where the [[centralizer]] of some [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] is [[isomorphic]] to the nontrivial central extension of the [[alternating group]] A<sub>11</sub> of degree 11 by the [[cyclic group]] C<sub>2</sub>. {{harvtxt|Sims|1973}} proved the existence of such a group and its uniqueness up to isomorphism with a combination of permutation group theory and machine calculations. \n\nWhen the [[McLaughlin group (mathematics)|McLaughlin sporadic group]] was discovered, it was noticed that a centralizer of one of its involutions was the perfect [[Double covering group|double cover]] of the [[alternating group]] ''A''<sub>8</sub>. This suggested considering  the double covers of the other alternating groups ''A''<sub>''n''</sub> as possible centralizers of involutions in simple groups. The cases ''n'' ≤ 7 are ruled out by the [[Brauer-Suzuki theorem]], the case ''n'' = 8 leads to the McLaughlin group, the case ''n'' = 9 was ruled out by [[Zvonimir Janko]], Lyons himself ruled out the case ''n'' = 10 and found the Lyons group for ''n'' = 11, while the cases ''n'' ≥ 12 were ruled out by [[John Griggs Thompson|J.G. Thompson]] and [[Ronald Solomon]].\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]]. \n\nSince 37 and 67 are not [[supersingular prime (moonshine theory)|supersingular]] primes, the Lyons group cannot be a [[subquotient]] of the [[monster group]]. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the [[pariah group|pariahs]].\n\n==Representations==\n\n{{harvtxt|Meyer|Neutsch|Parker|1985}} showed that the Lyons group has a [[modular representation]] of dimension 111 over the field of five elements, which is the smallest dimension of any faithful linear representation and is one of the easiest ways of calculating with it. It has also been given by several complicated presentations in terms of generators and relations, for instance those given by {{harvtxt|Sims|1973}} or {{harvtxt|Gebhardt|2000}}.\n\nThe smallest faithful [[permutation representation]] is a rank 5 permutation representation on 8835156 points with stabilizer G<sub>2</sub>(5). There is also a slightly larger rank 5 permutation representation on 9606125 points with stabilizer 3.McL:2.\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|1985}} found the 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''Ly'' as follows:\n\n* G<SUB>2</SUB>(5)\n* 3.McL:2\n* 5<SUP>3</SUP>.PSL<SUB>3</SUB>(5)\n* 2.A<SUB>11</SUB>\n* 5<SUP>1+4</SUP>:4.S<SUB>6</SUB>\n* 3<SUP>5</SUP>:(2 × M<SUB>11</SUB>)\n* 3<SUP>2+4</SUP>:2.A<SUB>5</SUB>.D<SUB>8</SUB>\n* 67:22\n* 37:18\n\n== References ==\n\n* [[Richard Lyons (mathematician)|Richard Lyons]] (1972,5) \"Evidence for a new finite simple group\", [[Journal of Algebra]] 20:540&ndash;569 and 34:188&ndash;189.\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Gebhardt | first1 = Volker | year = 2000 | title = Two short presentations for Lyons' sporadic simple group | url = | journal = Experimental Mathematics | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 333–8 | doi=10.1080/10586458.2000.10504410}}\n* {{Citation | last3=Parker | first3=Richard | last2=Neutsch | first2=Wolfram | last1=Meyer | first1=Werner | title=The minimal 5-representation of Lyons' sporadic group | doi=10.1007/BF01455926 |mr=794089 | year=1985 | journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]] | issn=0025-5831 | volume=272 | issue=1 | pages=29–39}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Sims | first1=Charles C. | authorlink=Charles Sims (mathematician) |title=Finite groups '72 (Proc.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_group",
      "text": "{{Group theory sidebar |Finite}}\n\nIn [[group theory]], a topic in [[abstract algebra]], the '''Mathieu groups''' are the five [[sporadic simple group]]s [[Mathieu group M11|''M''<sub>11</sub>]], [[Mathieu group M12|''M''<sub>12</sub>]], [[Mathieu group M22|''M''<sub>22</sub>]], [[Mathieu group M23|''M''<sub>23</sub>]] and [[Mathieu group M24|''M''<sub>24</sub>]] introduced by {{harvs|txt |authorlink=Émile Léonard Mathieu |last=Mathieu |year1=1861 |year2=1873}}. They are multiply transitive [[permutation group]]s on 11, 12, 22, 23 or 24 objects.  They were the first sporadic groups to be discovered.\n\nSometimes the notation ''M''<sub>9</sub>, ''M''<sub>10</sub>, ''M''<sub>20</sub> and ''M''<sub>21</sub> is used for related groups (which act on sets of 9,  10,  20, and 21 points, respectively), namely the stabilizers of points in the larger groups. While these are not sporadic simple groups, they are subgroups of the larger groups and can be used to construct the larger ones.  [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] has shown that one can also extend this sequence up, obtaining the [[Mathieu groupoid |Mathieu groupoid ''M''<sub>13</sub>]] acting on 13 points. ''M''<sub>21</sub> is simple, but is not a sporadic group, being isomorphic to PSL(3,4).\n\n== History ==\n\n{{harvtxt|Mathieu|1861|loc=p.271}} introduced the group ''M''<sub>12</sub> as part of an investigation of multiply transitive permutation groups, and briefly mentioned (on page 274) the group ''M''<sub>24</sub>, giving its order. In {{harvtxt|Mathieu|1873}} he gave further details, including explicit [[Generating set of a group|generating sets]] for his groups, but it was not easy to see from his arguments that the groups generated are not just [[alternating group]]s, and for several years the existence of his groups was controversial.  {{harvtxt|Miller|1898}} even published a paper mistakenly claiming to prove that ''M''<sub>24</sub> does not exist, though shortly afterwards in {{harv|Miller|1900}} he pointed out that his proof was wrong, and gave a proof that the Mathieu groups are simple.  {{harvs|txt|last=Witt|year1=1938a|year2=1938b}} finally removed the doubts about the existence of these groups, by constructing them as successive transitive extensions of permutation groups, as well as automorphism groups of [[Steiner system]]s.\n\nAfter the Mathieu groups no new sporadic groups were found until 1965, when the group [[Janko group J1|J<sub>1</sub>]] was discovered.\n\n== Multiply transitive groups ==\n\nMathieu was interested in finding '''multiply transitive''' permutation groups, which will now be defined. For a natural number ''k'', a permutation group ''G'' acting on ''n'' points is ''' ''k''-transitive''' if, given two sets of points ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ... ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> and ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ... ''b''<sub>''k''</sub> with the property that all the ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> are distinct and all the ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> are distinct, there is a group element ''g'' in ''G'' which maps ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> to ''b''<sub>''i''</sub> for each ''i'' between 1 and ''k''.  Such a group is called '''sharply ''k''-transitive''' if the element ''g'' is unique (i.e. the action on ''k''-tuples is [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|regular]], rather than just transitive).\n\n''M''<sub>24</sub> is 5-transitive, and ''M''<sub>12</sub> is sharply 5-transitive, with the other Mathieu groups (simple or not) being the subgroups corresponding to stabilizers of ''m'' points, and accordingly of lower transitivity (''M''<sub>23</sub> is 4-transitive, etc.).\n\nThe only 4-transitive groups are the [[symmetric group]]s ''S''<sub>''k''</sub> for ''k'' at least 4, the [[alternating group]]s ''A''<sub>''k''</sub> for ''k'' at least 6, and the Mathieu groups [[Mathieu group M24|''M''<sub>24</sub>]], [[Mathieu group M23|''M''<sub>23</sub>]], [[Mathieu group M12|''M''<sub>12</sub>]] and [[Mathieu group M11|''M''<sub>11</sub>]]. {{harv|Cameron|1999|loc= p. 110}} The full proof requires the [[classification of finite simple groups]], but some special cases have been known for much longer.\n\nIt is a classical result of [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]] that the [[symmetric group|symmetric]] and [[alternating group]]s (of degree ''k'' and ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 respectively), and ''M''<sub>12</sub> and ''M''<sub>11</sub> are the only ''sharply'' ''k''-transitive permutation groups for ''k'' at least&nbsp;4.\n\nImportant examples of multiply transitive groups are the [[2-transitive group]]s and the [[Zassenhaus group]]s. The Zassenhaus groups notably include the [[projective general linear group]] of a projective line over a finite field, PGL(2,'''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>), which is sharply 3-transitive (see [[cross ratio]]) on <math>q+1</math> elements.\n\n=== Order and transitivity table ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

That subgroup is isomorphic to the [[projective special linear group]] PSL<sub>2</sub>('''F'''<sub>11</sub>) over the [[finite field|field of 11 elements]]. With &minus;1 written as '''a''' and infinity as '''b''', two standard generators are (0123456789a) and (0b)(1a)(25)(37)(48)(69). A third generator giving ''M''<sub>12</sub> sends an element ''x'' of '''F'''<sub>11</sub> to 4''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3''x''<sup>7</sup>; as a permutation that is (26a7)(3945).\n\nThis group turns out not to be isomorphic to any member of the infinite families of finite simple groups and is called sporadic. ''M''<sub>11</sub> is the stabilizer of a point in ''M''<sub>12</sub>, and turns out also to be a sporadic simple group. ''M''<sub>10</sub>, the stabilizer of two points, is not sporadic, but is an [[almost simple group]] whose [[commutator subgroup]] is the [[alternating group]] A<sub>6</sub>. It is thus related to the [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups#exceptional outer automorphism|exceptional outer automorphism]] of A<sub>6</sub>. The stabilizer of 3 points is the [[projective special unitary group]] PSU(3,2<sup>2</sup>), which is solvable. The stabilizer of 4 points is the [[quaternion group]].\n\nLikewise, ''M''<sub>24</sub> has a maximal simple subgroup of order 6072 isomorphic to PSL<sub>2</sub>('''F'''<sub>23</sub>). One generator adds 1 to each element of the field (leaving the point ''N'' at infinity fixed), i. e. (0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLM)(''N''), and the other is the [[order reversing permutation]], (0N)(1M)(2B)(3F)(4H)(59)(6J)(7D)(8K)(AG)(CL)(EI). A third generator giving ''M''<sub>24</sub> sends an element ''x'' of '''F'''<sub>23</sub> to 4''x''<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3''x''<sup>15</sup> (which sends perfect squares via <math> x^4 </math> and non-perfect squares via <math> 7 x^4</math>);  computation shows that as a permutation this is (2G968)(3CDI4)(7HABM)(EJLKF).\n\nThe stabilizers of 1 and 2 points, ''M''<sub>23</sub> and ''M''<sub>22</sub> also turn out to  be sporadic simple groups. The stabilizer of 3 points is simple and isomorphic to the [[projective special linear group]] PSL<sub>3</sub>(4).\n\nThese constructions were cited by {{harvtxt|Carmichael|1956|loc= pp. 151, 164, 263}}. {{harvtxt|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=p.209}} ascribe the permutations to Mathieu.\n\n=== Automorphism groups of Steiner systems ===\n\nThere exists [[up to]] [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] a unique ''S''(5,8,24) [[Steiner system]] '''W<sub>24</sub>''' (the [[Witt design]]). The group ''M''<sub>24</sub> is the automorphism group of this Steiner system; that is, the set of permutations which map every block to some other block. The subgroups ''M''<sub>23</sub> and ''M''<sub>22</sub> are defined to be the stabilizers of a single point and two points respectively.\n\nSimilarly, there exists up to equivalence a unique S(5,6,12) Steiner system '''W<sub>12</sub>''', and the group ''M''<sub>12</sub> is its automorphism group. The subgroup ''M''<sub>11</sub> is the stabilizer of a point.\n\n''W''<sub>12</sub> can be constructed from the [[affine geometry]] on the [[vector space]] ''F''<sub>3</sub>×''F''<sub>3</sub>, an ''S''(2,3,9) system.\n\nAn alternative construction of ''W''<sub>12</sub> is the 'Kitten' of {{Harvtxt|Curtis|1984}}.\n\nAn introduction to a construction of ''W''<sub>24</sub> via the [[Miracle Octad Generator]] of R. T. Curtis and Conway's analog for ''W''<sub>12</sub>, the miniMOG, can be found in the book by Conway and [[Neil Sloane|Sloane]].\n\n=== Automorphism groups on the Golay code ===\nThe group ''M''<sub>24</sub> is the [[Mathieu group M24#Automorphism group of the Golay code|permutation automorphism group]] of the [[binary Golay code|extended binary Golay code]] ''W'', i.e., the group of permutations on the 24 coordinates that map ''W'' to itself. All the Mathieu groups can be constructed as groups of permutations on the binary Golay code.\n\n''M''<sub>12</sub> has index 2 in its automorphism group, and ''M''<sub>12</sub>:2 happens to be isomorphic to a subgroup of ''M''<sub>24</sub>. ''M''<sub>12</sub> is the stabilizer of a '''dodecad''', a codeword of 12 1's; ''M''<sub>12</sub>:2 stabilizes a partition into 2 complementary dodecads.\n\nThere is a natural connection between the Mathieu groups and the larger [[Conway groups]], because the [[Leech lattice]] was constructed on the binary Golay code and in fact both lie in spaces of dimension 24.

It is the smallest sporadic group and, along with the other four Mathieu groups, the first to be discovered.  The [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\n''M<sub>11</sub>'' is a [[Group action (mathematics)#Types_of_actions|sharply 4-transitive]] [[permutation group]] on 11 objects and can be defined by some set of permutations, such as the pair (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11), (3,7,11,8)(4,10,5,6) of permutations used by the [[GAP computer algebra system]].\n\n==Representations==\n\n[[File:CayleyGraphMathieuGroupM11.png|thumb|A Cayley Graph of Mathieu Group M11]]M<sub>11</sub> has a sharply 4-transitive permutation representation on 11 points, whose point stabilizer is sometimes denoted by M<sub>10</sub>, and is a non-split extension of the form A<sub>6</sub>.2 (an extension of the group of order 2 by the alternating group A<sub>6</sub>). This action is the automorphism group of  a [[Steiner system]] S(4,5,11). The induced action on unordered pairs of points gives a [[rank 3 action]] on 55 points.  \n\nM<sub>11</sub> has a 3-transitive permutation representation on 12 points with point stabilizer PSL<sub>2</sub>(11). The permutation representations on 11 and 12 points can both be seen inside the [[Mathieu group M12]] as two different embeddings of M<sub>11</sub> in M<sub>12</sub>, exchanged by an outer automorphism.\n\nThe permutation representation on 11 points gives a complex irreducible representation in 10 dimensions. This is the smallest possible dimension of a faithful complex representation, though there are also two other such representations in 10 dimensions forming a complex conjugate pair. \n\nM<sub>11</sub> has two 5-dimensional irreducible representations over the field with 3 elements, related to the restrictions of 6-dimensional representations of the double cover of M<sub>12</sub>. These have the smallest dimension of any faithful linear representations of M<sub>11</sub> over any field.\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nThere are 5 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''M<sub>11</sub>'' as follows:\n\n* M<sub>10</sub>, order 720, one-point stabilizer in representation of degree 11\n* PSL(2,11), order 660, one-point stabilizer in representation of degree 12\n* M<sub>9</sub>:2, order 144, stabilizer of a 9 and 2 partition.\n* S<sub>5</sub>, order 120, orbits of 5 and 6\n: Stabilizer of block in the S(4,5,11) Steiner system\n* [[Quaternion group|Q]]:S<sub>3</sub>, order 48, orbits of 8 and 3\n: Centralizer of a quadruple transposition\n: Isomorphic to GL(2,3).\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\nThe maximum order of any element in M<sub>11</sub> is 11.

It is a [[Group action (mathematics)#Types of actions|sharply 5-transitive]] [[permutation group]] on 12 objects.  {{harvtxt|Burgoyne|Fong|1968}} showed that the [[Schur multiplier]] of  M<sub>12</sub> has order 2 (correcting a mistake in  {{harv|Burgoyne|Fong|1966}} where they incorrectly claimed it has order 1).\n\nThe double cover had been implicitly found earlier by {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1958}}, who showed that  M<sub>12</sub> is a subgroup of the [[projective linear group]] of dimension 6 over the [[finite field]] with 3 elements.\n\nThe [[outer automorphism group]] has order 2, and the full automorphism group M<sub>12</sub>.2 is contained in M<sub>24</sub> as the stabilizer of a pair of complementary dodecads of 24 points, with outer automorphisms of M<sub>12</sub> swapping the two dodecads.\n\n==Representations==\n\n{{harvtxt|Frobenius|1904}} calculated the complex character table of M<sub>12</sub>.\n\nM<sub>12</sub> has a strictly 5-transitive permutation representation on 12 points, whose point stabilizer is the [[Mathieu group M11|Mathieu group M<sub>11</sub>]]. Identifying the 12 points with the projective line over the field of 11 elements, M<sub>12</sub> is generated by the permutations of PSL<sub>2</sub>(11) together with the permutation (2,10)(3,4)(5,9)(6,7). This permutation representation preserves a [[Steiner system]] S(5,6,12) of 132 special hexads, such that each pentad is contained in exactly 1 special hexad, and the hexads are the supports of the weight 6 codewords of the extended [[ternary Golay code]]. In fact M<sub>12</sub> has two inequivalent actions on 12 points, exchanged by an outer automorphism; these are analogous to the two inequivalent actions of the symmetric group ''S''<sub>6</sub> on 6 points.\n\nThe double cover 2.M<sub>12</sub> is the automorphism group of the extended [[ternary Golay code]], a dimension 6 length 12 code over the field of order 3 of minimum weight 6. In particular the double cover has an irreducible 6-dimensional representation over the field of 3 elements.\n\nThe double cover 2.M<sub>12</sub> is the automorphism group of any 12×12 [[Hadamard matrix]].\n\nM<sub>12</sub> centralizes an element of order 11 in the [[monster group]], as a result of which it acts naturally on a [[vertex algebra]] over the field with 11 elements, given as the [[Tate cohomology]] of the [[monster vertex algebra]].\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nThere are 11 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of M<sub>12</sub>, 6 occurring in automorphic pairs, as follows:\n\n* [[Mathieu group M11|M<sub>11</sub>]], order 7920, index 12. There are two classes of maximal subgroups, exchanged by an outer automorphism. One is the subgroup fixing a point with orbits of size 1 and 11, while the other acts transitively on 12 points. \n* S<sub>6</sub>:2 = M<sub>10</sub>.2, the outer automorphism group of the symmetric group S<sub>6</sub> of order 1440, index 66. There are two classes of maximal subgroups, exchanged by an outer automorphism. One is [[Primitive_permutation_group|imprimitive]] and transitive, acting with  2 blocks of 6, while the other is the subgroup fixing a pair of points and has orbits of size 2 and 10. \n* PSL(2,11), order 660, index 144, doubly transitive on the 12 points\n* 3<sup>2</sup>:(2.S<sub>4</sub>), order 432. There are two classes of maximal subgroups, exchanged by an outer automorphism. One acts with orbits of 3 and 9, and the other is  imprimitive on 4 sets of 3.\n: Isomorphic to the affine group on the space C<sub>3</sub> x C<sub>3</sub>.\n* S<sub>5</sub> x 2, order 240, doubly imprimitive on  6 sets of 2 points\n: Centralizer of a sextuple transposition\n* [[Quaternion group|Q]]:S<sub>4</sub>, order 192, orbits of 4 and 8.\n: Centralizer of a quadruple transposition\n* 4<sup>2</sup>:(2 x S<sub>3</sub>), order 192, imprimitive on 3 sets of 4\n* A<sub>4</sub> x S<sub>3</sub>, order 72, doubly imprimitive, 4 sets of 3 points.\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\n\nThe cycle shape of an element and its conjugate under an outer automorphism are related in the following way: the union of the two cycle shapes is balanced, in other words invariant under changing each ''n''-cycle to an ''N''/''n'' cycle for some integer ''N''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

It is a 3-fold transitive [[permutation group]] on 22 objects.  The [[Schur multiplier]] of M<sub>22</sub> is cyclic of order 12, and the [[outer automorphism group]] has order 2.\n\nThere are several incorrect statements about the 2-part of the Schur multiplier in the mathematical literature. \n{{harvtxt|Burgoyne|Fong|1966}} incorrectly claimed that the Schur multiplier of M<sub>22</sub> has order 3, and in a correction {{harvtxt|Burgoyne|Fong|1968}} incorrectly claimed that it has order 6. This caused an error in the title of the paper {{harvtxt|Janko|1976}} announcing the discovery of the [[Janko group J4]]. {{harvtxt|Mazet|1979}} showed that the Schur multiplier is in fact cyclic of order 12.\n\n{{harvtxt|Adem|Milgram|1995}} calculated the 2-part of all the cohomology of M<sub>22</sub>.\n\n==Representations==\n\nM<sub>22</sub> has a 3-transitive permutation representation on 22 points, with point stabilizer the group PSL<sub>3</sub>(4), sometimes called M<sub>21</sub>. This action fixes a [[Steiner system]] S(3,6,22) with 77 hexads, whose full automorphism group is the automorphism group M<sub>22</sub>.2 of M<sub>22</sub>.\n\nM<sub>22</sub> has three [[rank 3 permutation representation]]s: one on the 77 hexads with point stabilizer 2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>6</sub>, and two rank 3 actions on 176 heptads that are conjugate under an outer automorphism and have point stabilizer A<sub>7</sub>.\n\nM<sub>22</sub> is the point stabilizer of the action of [[Mathieu group M23|M<sub>23</sub>]] on 23 points, and also the point stabilizer of the [[rank 3 action]] of the [[Higman–Sims group]] on 100 = 1+22+77 points.\n\nThe triple cover 3.M<sub>22</sub> has a 6-dimensional faithful representation over the field with 4 elements.\n\nThe 6-fold cover of M<sub>22</sub> appears in the centralizer 2<sup>1+12</sup>.3.(M<sub>22</sub>:2) of an involution of the [[Janko group J4]].\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nThere are no proper subgroups transitive on all 22 points.  There are 8 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''M<sub>22</sub>'' as follows:\n\n* PSL(3,4) or M<sub>21</sub>, order 20160: one-point stabilizer\n* 2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>6</sub>, order 5760, orbits of 6 and 16\n: Stabilizer of W<sub>22</sub> block\n* A<sub>7</sub>, order 2520, orbits of 7 and 15\n: There are 2 sets, of 15 each, of simple subgroups of order 168. Those of one type have orbits of 1, 7 and 14; the others have orbits of 7, 8, and 7.\n* A<sub>7</sub>, orbits of 7 and 15\n: Conjugate to preceding type in M<sub>22</sub>:2.\n* 2<sup>4</sup>:S<sub>5</sub>, order 1920, orbits of 2 and 20 (5 blocks of 4)\n: A 2-point stabilizer in the sextet group\n* 2<sup>3</sup>:PSL(3,2), order 1344, orbits of 8 and 14\n* M<sub>10</sub>, order 720, orbits of 10 and 12 (2 blocks of 6)\n: A one-point stabilizer of M<sub>11</sub> (point in orbit of 11)\n: A non-split [[group extension]] of form A<sub>6</sub>.2\n* PSL(2,11), order 660, orbits of 11 and 11\n: Another one-point stabilizer of M<sub>11</sub> (point in orbit of 12)\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\nThere are 12 conjugacy classes, though the two classes of elements of order 11 are fused under an outer automorphism.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

It is a 4-fold transitive [[permutation group]] on 23 objects.  The [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\n{{harvtxt|Milgram|2000}} calculated the integral cohomology, and showed in particular that M<sub>23</sub> has the unusual property that the first 4 integral homology groups all vanish.\n\nThe [[inverse Galois problem]] seems to be unsolved for M<sub>23</sub>. In other words, no polynomial in Z[x] seems to be known to have M<sub>23</sub> as its Galois group. The inverse Galois problem is solved for all other sporadic simple groups.\n\n==Representations==\n\nM<sub>23</sub> is the point stabilizer of the action of the [[Mathieu group M24]] on 24 points, giving it a 4-transitive permutation representation on 23 points with point stabilizer the [[Mathieu group M22]]. \n\nM<sub>23</sub> has 2 different [[rank 3 action]]s on 253 points.

The 22-dimensional representation is irreducible over any field of characteristic not 2 or 23. \n\nOver the field of order 2, it has 2 11-dimensional representations, the restrictions of the corresponding representations of the [[Mathieu group M24]].\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\nThere are 7 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''M<sub>23</sub>'' as follows:\n\n* [[Mathieu_group_M22|M<sub>22</sub>]], order 443520\n* PSL(3,4):2, order 40320, orbits of 21 and 2\n* 2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>7</sub>, order 40320, orbits of 7 and 16\n: Stabilizer of W<sub>23</sub> block\n* A<sub>8</sub>, order 20160, orbits of 8 and 15\n* [[Mathieu_group_M11|M<sub>11</sub>]], order 7920, orbits of 11 and 12\n* (2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>5</sub>):S<sub>3</sub> or M<sub>20</sub>:S<sub>3</sub>, order 5760, orbits of 3 and 20 (5 blocks of 4)\n: One-point stabilizer of the sextet group\n* 23:11, order 253, simply transitive\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

It is a 5-transitive [[permutation group]] on 24 objects.  The [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\nThe Mathieu groups can be constructed in various ways. Initially, Mathieu and others constructed them as [[Mathieu group#Permutation groups|permutation groups]]. It was difficult to see that M<sub>24</sub> actually existed, that its generators did not just generate the alternating group A<sub>24</sub>. The matter was clarified when Ernst Witt constructed M<sub>24</sub> as the automorphism (symmetry) group of an S(5,8,24) [[Mathieu group#Automorphism groups of Steiner systems|Steiner system]] '''W<sub>24</sub>''' (the [[Witt design]]). M<sub>24</sub> is the group of permutations that map every block in this design to some other block. The subgroups M<sub>23</sub> and M<sub>22</sub> then are easily defined to be the stabilizers of a single point and a pair of points respectively.\n\n=== M<sub>24</sub> from PSL(3,4) ===\n\nM<sub>24</sub> can be built starting from PSL(3,4), the [[projective special linear group]] of 3-dimensional space over the finite field with 4 elements {{Harv|Dixon|Mortimer|1996|loc=pp. 192–205}}.  This group, sometimes called '''M<sub>21</sub>''', acts on the [[projective plane]] over the field F<sub>4</sub>, an S(2,5,21) system called '''W<sub>21</sub>'''. Its 21 blocks are called '''lines'''. Any 2 lines intersect at one point.\n \nM<sub>21</sub> has 168 simple subgroups of order 360 and 360 simple subgroups of order 168. In the larger [[projective general linear group]] PGL(3,4) both sets of subgroups form single conjugacy classes, but in M<sub>21</sub> both sets split into 3 conjugacy classes. The subgroups respectively have orbits of 6, called '''hyperovals''', and orbits of 7, called [[Fano plane|Fano subplanes]]. These sets allow creation of new blocks for larger Steiner systems. M<sub>21</sub> is normal in PGL(3,4), of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 3. PGL(3,4) has an outer automorphism induced by transposing conjugate elements in F<sub>4</sub> (the field automorphism). PGL(3,4) can therefore be extended to the group PΓL(3,4) of [[projective semilinear transformations]], which is a split extension of M<sub>21</sub> by the [[symmetric group]] S<sub>3</sub>. PΓL(3,4) has an embedding as a maximal subgroup of M<sub>24</sub>.{{Harv|Griess|1998|loc=p. 55]}}\n\nA hyperoval has no 3 points that are colinear. A Fano subplane likewise satisfies suitable uniqueness conditions.\n\nTo W<sub>21</sub> append 3 new points and let the automorphisms in PΓL(3,4) but not in M<sub>21</sub> permute these new points. An S(3,6,22) system W<sub>22</sub> is formed by appending just one new point to each of the 21 lines and new blocks are 56 hyperovals conjugate under M<sub>21</sub>.\n\nAn S(5,8,24) system would have 759 blocks, or '''octads'''. Append all 3 new points to each line of W<sub>21</sub>, a different new point to the Fano subplanes in each of the sets of 120, and append appropriate pairs of new points to all the hyperovals. That accounts for all but 210 of the octads. Those remaining octads are subsets of W<sub>21</sub> and are [[symmetric difference]]s of pairs of lines. There are many possible ways to expand the group PΓL(3,4) to M<sub>24</sub>.\n\n=== Automorphism group of the Golay code ===\n\nThe group M<sub>24</sub> also is the permutation [[automorphism group]] of the [[binary Golay code]] ''W'', i.e., the group of permutations of coordinates mapping ''W'' to itself. Codewords correspond in a natural way to subsets of a set of 24 objects. (In coding theory the term \"binary Golay code\" often refers to a shorter related length 23 code, and the length 24 code used here is called the \"extended binary Golay code\".) Those subsets corresponding to codewords with 8 or 12 coordinates  equal to 1 are called '''octads''' or '''dodecads''' respectively. The octads are the blocks of an S(5,8,24) Steiner system and the binary Golay code is the vector space over field F<sub>2</sub> spanned by the octads of the Steiner system.\n\nThe simple subgroups M<sub>23</sub>, M<sub>22</sub>, M<sub>12</sub>, and M<sub>11</sub> can be defined as subgroups of M<sub>24</sub>, stabilizers respectively of a single coordinate, an ordered pair of coordinates, a dodecad, and a dodecad together with a single coordinate.\n\nThere is a natural connection between the Mathieu groups and the larger [[Conway groups]], because the binary Golay code and the [[Leech lattice]] both lie in spaces of dimension 24. The Conway groups in turn are found in the [[Monster group]].  [[Robert Griess]] refers to the 20 sporadic groups found in the Monster as the '''Happy Family''', and to the Mathieu groups as the '''first generation'''.\n\n===Polyhedral symmetries===\n[[File:Small cubicuboctahedron.png|thumb|M<sub>24</sub> can be constructed from symmetries of the [[Klein quartic]], augmented by a (non-geometric) symmetry of its immersion as the [[small cubicuboctahedron]].]]\nM<sub>24</sub> can be constructed starting from the symmetries of the [[Klein quartic]] (the symmetries of a [[tessellation]] of the genus three surface), which is PSL(2,7), which can be augmented by an additional permutation. This permutation can be described by starting with the tiling of the Klein quartic by 56 triangles (with 24 vertices – the 24 points on which the group acts), then forming squares of out some of the 2 triangles, and octagons out of 6 triangles, with the added permutation being \"interchange the two endpoints of those edges of the original triangular tiling which bisect the squares and octagons\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Richter |first1=David |title=How to Make the Mathieu Group M<sub>24</sub> |url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/mathieu.htm |website=David A. Richter, Associate Professor, Polytopologist}}</ref> This can be visualized by [http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/images/mathieu/hypercolors.jpg coloring the triangles] – the corresponding tiling is topologically but not geometrically the [[:File:Uniform tiling 443-t01.png|t<sub>0,1</sub>{4, 3, 3} tiling]], and can be (polyhedrally) [[Immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] in Euclidean 3-space as the [[small cubicuboctahedron]] (which also has 24 vertices).{{Harv|Richter}}\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe theory of [[umbral moonshine]] is a partly conjectural relationship between [[K3 surface]]s and M<sub>24</sub>.\n\nThe [[Conway group Co1]], the [[Fischer group Fi24]], and the [[Janko group J4]] each have maximal subgroups that are an extension of the Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub> by a group 2<sup>11</sup>. (These extensions are not all the same.)\n\n==Representations==\n\n{{harvtxt|Frobenius|1904}} calculated the complex character table of M<sub>24</sub>.\n\nThe Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub> has a 5-fold transitive permutation representation on 24 points. The corresponding linear representation over the complex numbers is the sum of the trivial representation and a 23-dimensional irreducible representation.\n\nM<sub>24</sub> has two [[rank 3 permutation representation]]s: one on the 276 = 1+44+231 pairs of points (or duads)  with stabilizer M<sub>22</sub>.2, and one on the 1288 = 1+495+792 duads, with stabilizer M<sub>12</sub>.2.\n\nThe quotient of the 24-dimensional linear representation of the permutation representation by its 1-dimensional fixed subspace gives a 23-dimensional representation, which is irreducible over any field of characteristic not 2 or 3, and gives the smallest faithful representation over such fields.\n\nReducing the 24-dimensional representation mod 2 gives an action on '''F'''{{su|b=2|p=24}}. This has invariant subspaces of dimension 1, 12 (the Golay code), and 23. The subquotients give  two irreducible representations of dimension 11 over the field with 2 elements.\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\n{{Harvtxt|Choi|1972b}} found the 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of ''M<sub>24</sub>''. {{Harvtxt|Curtis|1977}} gave a short proof of the result, describing the 9 classes in terms of combinatorial data on the 24 points: the subgroups fix a point, duad, octad, duum, sextet, triad, trio, projective line, or octern, as described below. {{harvtxt|Todd|1966}} gave the character tables of M<sub>24</sub> (originally calculated by {{harvtxt|Frobenius|1904}}) and the 8 maximal subgroups that were known at the time.\n\nM<sub>24</sub> contains non-abelian simple subgroups of 13 isomorphism types: five classes of A<sub>5</sub>, four classes of PSL(3,2), two classes of A<sub>6</sub>, two classes of PSL(2,11), one class each of A<sub>7</sub>, PSL(2,23), M<sub>11</sub>, PSL(3,4), A<sub>8</sub>, M<sub>12</sub>, M<sub>22</sub>, M<sub>23</sub>, and M<sub>24</sub>. A<sub>6</sub> is also noted below as a subquotient in the sextet subgroup.\n\nThe Mathieu group acts on the 2048 = 1+759+1288 points of the Golay code modulo the fixed space with 3 orbits, and on the 4096 = 1+24+276+2024+1771 points of the cocode with 5 orbits, and the subgroups fixing a non-trivial point of the code or cocode give 6 of the 9 classes of maximal subgroups.\n\nThe 9 classes of maximal subgroups are as follows:\n\n===Point subgroup===\n\n[[Mathieu group M23|M<sub>23</sub>]], order 10200960\n\n===Duad subgroup===\n\nA duad is a pair of points. The subgroup fixing a duad is\n[[Mathieu group M22|M<sub>22</sub>]]:2, order 887040, with orbits of 2 and 22.\n\n===Octad subgroup===\n\nThe subgroup fixing one of the 759 (= 3·11·23) octads of the Golay code or Steiner system is the octad group \n2<sup>4</sup>:A<sub>8</sub>, order 322560, with orbits of size 8 and 16. The linear group GL(4,2) has an [[exceptional isomorphism]] to the alternating group A<sub>8</sub>. The pointwise stabilizer '''O''' of an octad is an abelian group of order 16, exponent 2, each of whose involutions moves all 16 points outside the octad. The stabilizer of the octad is a split extension of O by A<sub>8</sub>. {{harv|Thompson|1983|loc= pp. 197–208}}\n\n===Duum subgroup===\n\nA duum is a pair of complementary dodecads (12 point sets) in the Golay code. The subgroup fixing a duad is\n[[Mathieu group M12|M<sub>12</sub>]]:2, order 190080, transitive and imprimitive. This subgroup was discovered by Frobenius. \nThe subgroup M<sub>12</sub> acts differently on 2 sets of 12, reflecting the outer automorphism of M<sub>12</sub>.\n\n===Sextet subgroup===\n\n2<sup>6</sup>:(3.S<sub>6</sub>), order 138240: ''sextet group''\n\nConsider a '''tetrad''', any set of 4 points in the Steiner system W<sub>24</sub>. An octad is determined by choice of a fifth point from the remaining 20. There are 5 octads possible. Hence any tetrad determines a partition into 6 tetrads, called a '''sextet''', whose stabilizer in M<sub>24</sub> is called a '''sextet group'''.\n\nThe total number of tetrads is 24*23*22*21/4! = 23*22*21. Dividing that by 6 gives the number of sextets, 23*11*7 = 1771. Furthermore, a sextet group is a subgroup of a [[wreath product]] of order 6!*(4!)<sup>6</sup>, whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5. Now we know the prime divisors of |M<sub>24</sub>|. Further analysis would determine the order of the sextet group and hence |M<sub>24</sub>|.\n\nIt is convenient to arrange the 24 points into a 6-by-4 array:\n\n<tt>\nA  E  I  M  Q  U\n\nB  F  J  N  R  V\n\nC  G  K  O  S  W\n\nD  H  L  P  T  X\n</tt>\n\nMoreover, it is convenient to use the elements of the field F<sub>4</sub> to number the rows: 0, 1, u, u<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe sextet group has a normal abelian subgroup '''H''' of order 64, isomorphic to the [[hexacode]], a vector space of length 6 and dimension 3 over F<sub>4</sub>. A non-zero element in H does double transpositions within 4 or 6 of the columns. Its action can be thought of as addition of vector co-ordinates to row numbers.\n\nThe sextet group is a split extension of H by a group 3.S<sub>6</sub> (a [[stem extension]]). Here is an instance within the Mathieu groups where a simple group (A<sub>6</sub>) is a [[subquotient]], not a subgroup. 3.S<sub>6</sub> is the [[normalizer]] in M<sub>24</sub> of the subgroup generated by '''r'''=(BCD)(FGH)(JKL)(NOP)(RST)(VWX), which can be thought of as a multiplication of row numbers by u<sup>2</sup>. The subgroup 3.A<sub>6</sub> is the [[centralizer]] of <r>. Generators of 3.A<sub>6</sub> are:\n: (AEI)(BFJ)(CGK)(DHL)(RTS)(VWX) (rotating first 3 columns)\n: (AQ)(BS)(CT)(DR)(EU)(FX)(GV)(HW)\n: (AUEIQ)(BXGKT)(CVHLR)(DWFJS) (product of preceding two)\n: (FGH)(JLK)(MQU)(NRV)(OSW)(PTX) (rotating last 3 columns).\nAn odd permutation of columns, say (CD)(GH)(KL)(OP)(QU)(RV)(SX)(TW), then generates 3.S<sub>6</sub>.\n\nThe group 3.A<sub>6</sub> is isomorphic to a subgroup of SL(3,4) whose image in PSL(3,4) has been noted above as the hyperoval group.\n\nThe applet [http://nickerson.org.uk/groups/moggie/ Moggie] has a function that displays sextets in color.\n\n===Triad subgroup===\n\nA triad is a set of 3 points. The subgroup fixing a triad is \nPSL(3,4):S<sub>3</sub>, order 120960, with orbits of size 3 and 21.\n\n===Trio subgroup===\n\nA trio is a set of 3 disjoint octads of the Golay code. The subgroup fixing a trio is the trio group\n2<sup>6</sup>:(PSL(2,7) x S<sub>3</sub>), order 64512, transitive and imprimitive.\n\n===Projective line subgroup===\n\nThe subgroup fixing a projective line structure on the 24 points is\nPSL(2,23), order 6072, whose action is doubly transitive. This subgroup was observed by Mathieu.\n\n===Octern subgroup===\n\nAn octern is a certain partition of the 24 points into 8 blocks of 3. The subgroup fixing an octern is the \noctern group isomorphic to PSL<sub>2</sub>(7), of order 168, simple, transitive and imprimitive.\nIt was the last maximal subgroup of M<sub>24</sub> to be found.\n\n==Conjugacy classes==\n\nThere are 26 conjugacy classes. The cycle shapes are all balanced in the sense that they remain invariant under changing length ''k'' cycles to length ''N''/''k'' cycles for some integer ''N'' depending on the conjugacy class.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!

It fixes a [[Conway group#Other sporadic groups|2-2-3 triangle]] in the [[Leech lattice]] and thus is a subgroup of the [[Conway group]]s <math>\\mathrm{Co}_0</math>, <math>\\mathrm{Co}_2</math>, and <math>\\mathrm{Co}_3</math>. Its [[Schur multiplier]] has order&nbsp;3, and its [[outer automorphism group]] has order&nbsp;2. The group 3.McL:2 is a maximal subgroup of the [[Lyons group]].\n\nMcL has one conjugacy class of involution (element of order 2), whose centralizer is a maximal subgroup of type 2.A<sub>8</sub>. This has a center of order 2; the quotient modulo the center is isomorphic to the alternating group A<sub>8</sub>.\n\n==Representations==\nIn the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>3</sub>, McL has the normalizer McL:2, which is maximal in Co<sub>3</sub>.\n\nMcL has 2 classes of maximal subgroups isomorphic to the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>22</sub>. An outer automorphism interchanges the two classes of M<sub>22</sub> groups. This outer automorphism is realized on McL embedded as a subgroup of Co<sub>3</sub>.\n\nA convenient representation of M<sub>22</sub> is in permutation matrices on the last 22 coordinates; it fixes a 2-2-3 triangle with vertices the origin and the [[Conway group|type 2]] points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (−3, 1<sup>23</sup>)}} and {{nowrap|1='''y''' = (−4,-4,0<sup>22</sup>)}}'. The triangle's edge {{nowrap|1='''x'''-'''y''' = (1, 5, 1<sup>22</sup>)}} is [[Conway group|type 3]]; it is fixed by a Co<sub>3</sub>. This M<sub>22</sub> is the [[Conway group#Monomial subgroup N of Co0|monomial]], ''and a maximal'', subgroup of a representation of McL.\n\n{{harvtxt|Wilson|2009}} (p.&nbsp;207) shows that the subgroup McL is well-defined. In the [[Leech lattice]], suppose a type 3 point '''v''' is fixed by an instance of <math>\\mathrm{Co}_3</math>.

      "text": "In mathematics, the '''Miracle Octad Generator''', or '''MOG''', is a mathematical tool introduced by {{harvtxt|Curtis|1976}} for manipulating the [[Mathieu group]]s, [[binary Golay code]] and [[Leech lattice]].\n\n==Description==\nThe Miracle Octad Generator is a 4x6 array of [[combination]]s describing any point in 24-dimensional space. It reflects all of the symmetries of the [[Mathieu group]] M<sub>24</sub>. It preserves the [[maximal subgroup]]s of M<sub>24</sub>, namely the monad group, duad group, triad group, octad group, octern group, sextet group, trio group and duum group. It can therefore be used to study all of these symmetries without having to visualise 24-dimensional space. Of course, visualizing 24-dimensional space is easy: simply visualize n-dimensional space and set n = 24.\n\n==Golay code==\nAnother use for the Miracle Octad Generator is to quickly verify codewords of the [[binary Golay code]]. Each element of the Miracle Octad Generator can store either a '1' or a '0', usually displayed as an [[asterisk]] and blank space, respectively. Each column and the top row have a property known as the ''count'', which is the number of asterisks in that particular line. One of the criteria for a set of 24 coordinates to be a codeword in the binary Golay code is for all seven counts to be of the same [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]]. The other restriction is that the ''scores'' of each column form a word in the [[hexacode]]. The score of a column can be either 0, 1, ω, or ω-bar, depending on its contents. The score of a column is evaluated by the following rules:\n\n* If a column contains exactly one asterisk, it has a score of 0 if it resides in the top row, 1 if it is in the second row, ω for the third row, and ω-bar for the bottom row.\n* Simultaneously complementing every bit in a column does not affect its score.\n* Complementing the bit in the top row does not affect its score, either.\n\nA codeword can be derived from just its top row and score, which proves that there are exactly 4096 codewords in the binary Golay code.\n\n==MiniMOG==\n[[John Horton Conway]] developed a 4 &times; 3 array known as the '''MiniMOG'''. The MiniMOG provides the same function for the Mathieu group M<sub>12</sub> and [[ternary Golay code]] as the Miracle Octad Generator does for M<sub>24</sub> and binary Golay code, respectively. Instead of using a quaternary hexacode, the MiniMOG uses a ternary tetracode.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | author1-link=John Horton Conway | last2=Sloane | first2=Neil J.

Every such group belongs to one of 18 [[countably infinite]] families, or is one of 26 sporadic groups that do not follow such a systematic pattern. The Monster group contains 20 sporadic groups (including itself) as [[subquotient]]s.  [[Robert Griess]] has called those 20 groups the ''happy family'', and the remaining 6 exceptions ''[[pariah group|pariahs]]''.\n\nIt is difficult to make a good constructive definition of the Monster because of its complexity.  [[Martin Gardner]] wrote a popular account of the monster group in his June 1980 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.\n\n==History==\nThe Monster was predicted by [[Bernd Fischer (mathematician)|Bernd Fischer]] (unpublished, about 1973) and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Robert Griess|first=Robert|last= Griess|year=1976}} as a simple group containing a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of  Fischer's [[Baby Monster group]] as a [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]].  Within a few months, the order of M was found by Griess using the [[Thompson order formula]], and Fischer, Conway, Norton and Thompson discovered other groups as subquotients, including many of the known sporadic groups, and two new ones: the [[Thompson group (finite)|Thompson group]] and the [[Harada–Norton group]]. The [[Character theory|character table]] of the Monster, a 194-by-194 array, was calculated in 1979 by Fischer and Donald Livingstone using computer programs written by Michael Thorne. It was not clear in the 1970s whether the Monster actually exists. {{harvtxt|Griess|1982}} constructed M as the [[automorphism group]] of the [[Griess algebra]], a 196,884-dimensional commutative [[nonassociative algebra]]; he first announced his construction in [[Ann Arbor]] on January 14, 1980. In his 1982 paper, he referred to the Monster as the Friendly Giant, but this name has not been generally adopted. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John Horton Conway|first=John |last=Conway|year=1985}} and {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jacques Tits|first=Jacques|last=Tits|year1=1984|year2=1985}} subsequently simplified this construction.\n\nGriess's construction showed that the Monster exists. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=John G. Thompson|last=Thompson|year=1979}} showed that its uniqueness (as a simple group satisfying certain conditions coming from the classification of finite simple groups) would follow from the existence of a 196,883-dimensional [[faithful representation]]. A proof of the existence of such a representation was announced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Simon P. Norton|last=Norton|year=1985}}, though he has never published the details. {{harvtxt|Griess|Meierfrankenfeld|Segev|1989}} gave the first complete published proof of the uniqueness of the Monster (more precisely, they showed that a group with the same centralizers of involutions as the Monster is isomorphic to the Monster).\n\nThe Monster was a culmination of the development of sporadic simple groups and can be built from any 2 of 3 subquotients: the [[Fischer group]] Fi<sub>24</sub>, the [[Baby Monster]], and the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] of the Monster are both [[Trivial group|trivial]].\n\n==Representations==\n\nThe minimal degree of a faithful complex representation is 196,883, which is the product of the 3 largest [[prime divisor]]s of  the order of M.\nThe smallest faithful linear representation over any field has dimension 196,882 over the field with 2 elements, only 1 less than the dimension of the smallest faithful complex representation.\n\nThe smallest faithful permutation representation of the Monster is on \n2<sup>4</sup> · 3<sup>7</sup> · 5<sup>3</sup> · 7<sup>4</sup> · 11 · 13<sup>2</sup> · 29 · 41 · 59 · 71 (about 10<sup>20</sup>)\npoints.\n\nThe Monster can be realized as a [[Galois group]] over the [[rational number]]s {{Harv|Thompson|1984|loc=p. 443}}, and as a [[Hurwitz group]] {{Harv|Wilson|2004}}.\n\nThe Monster is unusual among simple groups in that there is no known easy way to represent its elements. This is not due so much to its size as to the absence of \"small\" representations. For example, the simple groups A<sub>100</sub> and SL<sub>20</sub>(2) are far larger, but easy to calculate with as they have \"small\" permutation or linear representations. The alternating groups have permutation representations that are \"small\" compared to the size of the group, and all finite simple groups of Lie type have linear representations that are \"small\" compared to the size of the group. All sporadic groups other than the Monster also have linear representations small enough that they are easy to work with on a computer (the next hardest case after the monster is the baby Monster, with a representation of dimension 4370).\n\n=== A computer construction ===\n\n[[Robert Arnott Wilson|Robert A. Wilson]] has found explicitly (with the aid of a computer) two 196,882 by 196,882 matrices (with elements in the [[Finite field|field of order 2]]) which together generate the Monster group; this is one dimension lower than the 196,883-dimensional representation in characteristic 0. Performing calculations with these matrices is possible but is too expensive in terms of time and storage space to be useful, as each such matrix occupies over four and a half gigabytes.\n\nWilson asserts that the best description of the Monster is to say, \"It is the [[automorphism group]] of the [[monster vertex algebra]]\".  This is not much help however, because nobody has found a \"really simple and natural construction of the monster vertex algebra\".<ref>[http://www.ams.org/notices/200209/what-is.pdf ''What is… The Monster?''] by [[Richard Borcherds|Richard E. Borcherds]], Notices of the [[American Mathematical Society]], October 2002 1077</ref>\n\nWilson with collaborators has found a method of performing calculations with the Monster that is considerably faster. Let ''V'' be a 196,882 dimensional vector space over the field with 2 elements. A large subgroup ''H'' (preferably a maximal subgroup) of the Monster is selected in which it is easy to perform calculations. The subgroup ''H'' chosen is 3<SUP>1+12</SUP>.2.Suz.2, where Suz is the [[Suzuki group (mathematics)|Suzuki group]]. Elements of the Monster are stored as words in the elements of ''H'' and an extra generator ''T''. It is reasonably quick to calculate the action of one of these words on a vector in ''V''. Using this action, it is possible to perform calculations (such as the order of an element of the Monster). Wilson has exhibited vectors ''u'' and ''v'' whose joint stabilizer is the trivial group. Thus (for example) one can calculate the order of an element ''g'' of the monster by finding the smallest ''i'' &gt; 0 such that ''g''<sup>''i''</sup>''u'' = ''u'' and ''g''<sup>''i''</sup>''v'' = ''v''.\n\nThis and similar constructions (in different [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristics]]) have been used  to find some of its non-local maximal subgroups.\n\n== Moonshine ==\n\nThe Monster group is one of two principal constituents in the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjecture by Conway and Norton, which relates discrete and non-discrete mathematics and was finally proved by [[Richard Ewen Borcherds|Richard Borcherds]] in 1992.\n\nIn this setting, the Monster group is visible as the automorphism group of the [[Monster module]], a [[vertex operator algebra]], an infinite dimensional algebra containing the Griess algebra, and acts on the [[Monster Lie algebra]], a [[generalized Kac–Moody algebra]].\n\nMany mathematicians including Conway regard the Monster as a beautiful and still mysterious object.<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2013/roberts-monster Curiosities: Pursuing the Monster] By [[Siobhan Roberts]] [[Institute for Advanced Study]], Published 2013</ref> [[Simon P.

See [[ADE classification#Trinities|ADE classification: trinities]] for further connections (of [[McKay correspondence]] type), including (for the Monster) with the rather small simple group [[projective special linear group|PSL]](2,11) and with the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4 known as [[Bring's curve]].\n\n==Maximal subgroups==\n[[Image:SporadicGroups.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram of the 26 sporadic simple groups, showing subquotient relationships.  The sporadic groups not involved in any larger one are circled.]]\n\nThe Monster has at least 44 conjugacy classes of maximal [[subgroups]]. Non-abelian simple groups of some 60 [[isomorphism]] types are found as subgroups or as quotients of subgroups. The largest [[alternating group]] represented is A<sub>12</sub>.\nThe Monster contains 20 of the 26 [[sporadic groups]] as subquotients. This diagram, based on one in the book ''Symmetry and the Monster'' by [[Mark Ronan]], shows how they fit together. The lines signify inclusion, as a subquotient, of the lower group by the upper one.

      "text": "{{more footnotes|date=May 2018}}\n{{string theory}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''monstrous moonshine''', or '''moonshine theory''', is the unexpected connection between the [[monster group]] ''M'' and [[modular function]]s, in particular, the [[j-invariant|''j'' function]].  The term was coined by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] and [[Simon P. Norton]] in 1979.\n\nIt is now known that lying behind monstrous moonshine is a [[vertex operator algebra]] called the [[monster vertex algebra|moonshine module]] (or monster vertex algebra) constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]] in 1988, having the monster group as [[symmetries]].  This vertex operator algebra is commonly interpreted as a structure underlying a [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]], allowing physics to form a bridge between two mathematical areas.  The conjectures made by Conway and Norton were proven by [[Richard Borcherds]] for the moonshine module in 1992 using the [[Goddard–Thorn theorem|no-ghost theorem]] from [[string theory]] and the theory of [[vertex operator algebra]]s and [[generalized Kac–Moody algebra]]s.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1978, [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]] found that the first few terms in the [[Fourier expansion]] of the normalized [[J-invariant]] {{OEIS|A014708}},\n\n:<math>J(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{{q}} + 196884{q} + 21493760{q}^2 + 864299970{q}^3 + 20245856256{q}^4 + \\cdots</math>\n\nwith <math>{q} = e^{2\\pi i\\tau}</math> and ''τ'' as the [[half-period ratio]] could be expressed in terms of [[linear combination]]s of the [[dimension]]s of the [[irreducible representation]]s <math>r_n</math> of the monster group ''M'' {{OEIS|A001379}} with small non-negative coefficients. Let <math>r_n</math> = 1, 196883, 21296876, 842609326, 18538750076, 19360062527, 293553734298, ... then,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n1 & = r_1 \\\\\n196884 & = r_1 + r_2  \\\\\n21493760 & = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \\\\\n864299970 & = 2r_1 + 2r_2 + r_3 + r_4 \\\\\n20245856256& = 3r_1 + 3r_2 + r_3 + 2r_4+ r_5 \\\\\n& = 2r_1+3r_2+2r_3+r_4+r_6\\\\\n333202640600 & = 5r_1 +5r_2+2r_3+3r_4+2r_5+r_7 \\\\\n& = 4r_1+5r_2+3r_3+2r_4+r_5+r_6+r_7\\\\ \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(Since there can be several linear relations between the <math>r_n</math> such as <math>r_1 - r_3 + r_4 + r_5 - r_6 = 0</math>, the representation may be in more than one way.) McKay viewed this as evidence that there is a naturally occurring infinite-dimensional [[Graded vector space|graded representation]] of ''M'', whose [[Hilbert–Poincaré series|graded dimension]] is given by the coefficients of ''J'', and whose lower-weight pieces decompose into irreducible representations as above.  After he informed [[John G. Thompson]] of this observation, Thompson suggested that because the graded dimension is just the graded [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the [[identity element]], the graded traces of nontrivial elements ''g'' of ''M'' on such a representation may be interesting as well.\n\nConway and Norton computed the lower-order terms of such graded traces, now known as [[McKay–Thompson series]] ''T''<sub>''g''</sub>, and found that all of them appeared to be the expansions of [[Hauptmodul]]n.   In other words, if ''G''<sub>''g''</sub> is the subgroup of [[SL2(R)|SL<sub>2</sub>('''R''')]] which fixes ''T''<sub>''g''</sub>, then the [[quotient group|quotient]] of the [[upper half-plane|upper half]] of the [[complex plane]] by ''G''<sub>''g''</sub> is a [[sphere]] with a finite number of points removed, and furthermore, ''T''<sub>''g''</sub> generates the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[meromorphic function]]s on this sphere.\n\nBased on their computations, Conway and Norton produced a list of Hauptmoduln, and conjectured the existence of an infinite dimensional graded representation of ''M'', whose graded traces ''T''<sub>''g''</sub> are the [[Fourier expansion|expansion]]s of precisely the functions on their list.\n\nIn 1980, [[A. Oliver L. Atkin]], Paul Fong and Stephen D. Smith produced strong computational evidence that such a graded representation exists, by decomposing a large number of coefficients of ''J'' into representations of ''M''.  A graded representation whose graded dimension is ''J'', called the moonshine module, was explicitly constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]], giving an effective solution to the McKay–Thompson conjecture, and they also determined the graded traces for all elements in the centralizer of an involution of ''M'', partially settling the Conway–Norton conjecture.  Furthermore, they showed that the [[vector space]] they constructed, called the Moonshine Module <math>V^\\natural</math>, has the additional structure of a [[vertex operator algebra]], whose [[automorphism group]] is precisely ''M''.\n\nBorcherds proved the Conway–Norton conjecture for the Moonshine Module in 1992.  He won the [[Fields Medal]] in 1998 in part for his solution of the conjecture.\n\n==The monster module==\nThe Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman construction starts with two main tools:\n\n# The construction of a lattice vertex operator algebra ''V''<sub>''L''</sub> for an even [[lattice (group)|lattice]] ''L'' of rank ''n''.  In physical terms, this is the [[chiral algebra]] for a [[bosonic string]] [[Compactification (physics)|compactified]] on a [[torus]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>/''L''.  It can be described roughly as the [[tensor product]] of the [[group ring]] of ''L'' with the oscillator representation in ''n'' dimensions (which is itself isomorphic to a [[polynomial ring]] in [[countably infinite]]ly many [[generator matrix|generators]]).  For the case in question, one sets ''L'' to be the [[Leech lattice]], which has rank 24.\n# The [[orbifold]] construction.  In physical terms, this describes a bosonic string propagating on a [[orbifold|quotient orbifold]].  The construction of Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman was the first time orbifolds appeared in [[conformal field theory]].  Attached to the [[Involution (mathematics)|–1 involution]] of the [[Leech lattice]], there is an involution ''h'' of ''V''<sub>''L''</sub>, and an irreducible ''h''-twisted ''V''<sub>''L''</sub>module, which inherits an involution lifting ''h''.  To get the Moonshine Module, one takes the [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point subspace]] of ''h'' in the direct sum of ''V''<sub>''L''</sub> and its [[vertex operator algebra|twisted module]].\n\nFrenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman then showed that the automorphism group of the moonshine module, as a vertex operator algebra, is ''M''.  Furthermore, they determined that the graded traces of elements in the subgroup 2<sup>1+24</sup>.''Co''<sub>1</sub> match the functions predicted by Conway and Norton ({{harvtxt|Frenkel|Lepowsky|Meurman|1988}}).\n\n==Borcherds' proof==\n[[Richard Borcherds]]' proof of the conjecture of Conway and Norton can be broken into the following major steps:\n\n# One begins with a vertex operator algebra ''V'' with an invariant bilinear form, an action of ''M'' by automorphisms, and with known decomposition of the homogeneous spaces of seven lowest degrees into irreducible ''M''-representations.  This was provided by Frenkel–Lepowsky–Meurman's construction and analysis of the Moonshine Module.\n# A [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, called the [[monster Lie algebra]], is constructed from ''V'' using a quantization functor.  It is a [[Generalized Kac–Moody algebra|generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra]] with a monster action by automorphisms.  Using the [[Goddard–Thorn theorem|Goddard–Thorn \"no-ghost\" theorem]] from [[string theory]], the root multiplicities are found to be coefficients of ''J''.\n# One uses the Koike–Norton–Zagier infinite product identity to construct a generalized Kac–Moody Lie algebra by generators and relations.  The identity is proved using the fact that [[Hecke operator]]s applied to ''J'' yield polynomials in ''J''.\n# By comparing root multiplicities, one finds that the two Lie algebras are isomorphic, and in particular, the [[Weyl denominator formula]] for <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is precisely the Koike–Norton–Zagier identity.\n# Using [[Lie algebra homology]] and [[Adams operation]]s, a twisted denominator identity is given for each element.  These identities are related to the McKay–Thompson series ''T''<sub>g</sub> in much the same way that the Koike–Norton–Zagier identity is related to ''J''.\n# The twisted denominator identities imply recursion relations on the coefficients of ''T''<sub>g</sub>, and unpublished work of Koike showed that Conway and Norton's candidate functions satisfied these recursion relations.  These relations are strong enough that one only needs to check that the first seven terms agree with the functions given by Conway and Norton.  The lowest terms are given by the decomposition of the seven lowest degree homogeneous spaces given in the first step.\n\nThus, the proof is completed ({{harvtxt|Borcherds|1992}}). Borcherds was later quoted as saying \"''I was over the moon when I proved the moonshine conjecture''\", and \"''I sometimes wonder if this is the feeling you get when you take certain drugs.

Jurisich ({{harvtxt|Jurisich|1998}}, {{harvtxt|Jurisich|Lepowsky|Wilson|1995}}) found that the homology computation could be substantially shortened by replacing the usual triangular decomposition of the Monster Lie algebra with a decomposition into a sum of ''gl''<sub>2</sub> and two free Lie algebras.  Cummins and Gannon showed that the recursion relations automatically imply the McKay Thompson series are either Hauptmoduln or terminate after at most 3 terms, thus eliminating the need for computation at the last step.\n\n=={{vanchor|Generalized moonshine}}==\nConway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that perhaps moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups.<ref>Conway, J. and Norton, S. \"Monstrous Moonshine\", Table 2a, p.330, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.103.3704&rep=rep1&type=pdf</ref> While Conway and Norton's claims were not very specific, computations by Larissa Queen in 1980 strongly suggested that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of irreducible representations of [[sporadic group]]s.  In particular, she decomposed the coefficients of McKay-Thompson series into representations of subquotients of the Monster in the following cases:\n\n* T<sub>2B</sub> and T<sub>4A</sub> into representations of the [[Conway group]] Co<sub>0</sub> \n* T<sub>3B</sub> and T<sub>6B</sub> into representations of the [[Suzuki group (mathematics)|Suzuki group]] 3.2.''Suz''\n* T<sub>3C</sub> into representations of the [[Thompson group (mathematics)|Thompson group]] ''Th = F''<sub>3</sub>\n* T<sub>5A</sub> into representations of the [[Harada–Norton group]] ''HN = F''<sub>5</sub>\n* T<sub>5B</sub> and T<sub>10D</sub> into representations of the [[Hall–Janko group]] 2.''HJ''\n* T<sub>7A</sub> into representations of the [[Held group]] ''He = F''<sub>7</sub>\n* T<sub>7B</sub> and T<sub>14C</sub> into representations of 2.''A''<sub>7</sub>\n* T<sub>11A</sub> into representations of the [[Mathieu group]] 2.''M''<sub>12</sub>\n\nQueen found that the traces of non-identity elements also yielded ''q''-expansions of Hauptmoduln, some of which were not McKay–Thompson series from the Monster.  In 1987, Norton combined Queen's results with his own computations to formulate the Generalized Moonshine conjecture.  This conjecture asserts that there is a rule that assigns to each element ''g'' of the monster, a graded vector space ''V''(''g''), and to each commuting pair of elements (''g'',''h'') a [[holomorphic function]] ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) on the [[upper half-plane]], such that:\n\n# Each ''V''(''g'') is a graded projective representation of the [[centralizer]] of ''g'' in ''M''.\n# Each ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) is either a constant function, or a Hauptmodul.\n# Each ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) is invariant under simultaneous [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]] of ''g'' and ''h'' in ''M'', up to a scalar ambiguity.\n# For each (''g'',''h''), there is a lift of ''h'' to a [[linear transformation]] on ''V''(''g''), such that the expansion of ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) is given by the graded trace.\n# For any <math>\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix} \\in SL_2(\\mathbf{Z})</math>, <math>f(g,h,\\frac{a\\tau+b}{c\\tau+d})</math> is proportional to <math>f(g^a h^c, g^b h^d, \\tau)</math>.\n# ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) is proportional to ''J'' if and only if ''g'' = ''h'' = 1.\n\nThis is a generalization of the Conway–Norton conjecture, because Borcherds's theorem concerns the case where ''g'' is set to the identity.  \n\nLike the Conway–Norton conjecture, Generalized Moonshine also has an interpretation in physics, proposed by Dixon–Ginsparg–Harvey in 1988 ({{harvtxt|Dixon|Ginsparg|Harvey|1989}}).  They interpreted the vector spaces ''V''(''g'') as twisted sectors of a conformal field theory with monster symmetry, and interpreted the functions ''f''(''g'',''h'',τ) as [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]] one [[partition function (mathematics)|partition function]]s, where one forms a torus by gluing along twisted boundary conditions.  In mathematical language, the twisted sectors are irreducible twisted modules, and the partition functions are assigned to elliptic curves with principal monster bundles, whose isomorphism type is described by [[monodromy]] along a [[Generating set of a group|basis]] of [[1-cycle]]s, i.e., a pair of commuting elements.\n\n==Conjectured relationship with quantum gravity==\nIn 2007, [[Edward Witten|E. Witten]] suggested that [[AdS/CFT correspondence]] yields a duality between pure quantum gravity in (2+1)-dimensional [[Anti-de Sitter space|anti de Sitter space]] and extremal holomorphic CFTs.  Pure gravity in 2+1 dimensions has no local degrees of freedom, but when the cosmological constant is negative, there is nontrivial content in the theory, due to the existence of [[BTZ black hole]] solutions.  Extremal CFTs, introduced by G. Höhn, are distinguished by a lack of Virasoro primary fields in low energy, and the moonshine module is one example.\n\nUnder Witten's proposal ({{harvtxt|Witten|2007}}), gravity in AdS space with maximally negative cosmological constant is AdS/CFT dual to a holomorphic CFT with central charge ''c=24'', and the partition function of the CFT is precisely ''j-744'', i.e., the graded character of the moonshine module.  By assuming Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman's conjecture that moonshine module is the unique holomorphic VOA with central charge 24 and character ''j-744'', Witten concluded that pure gravity with maximally negative cosmological constant is dual to the monster CFT.  Part of Witten's proposal is that Virasoro primary fields are dual to black-hole-creating operators, and as a consistency check, he found that in the large-mass limit, the [[Black hole thermodynamics|Bekenstein-Hawking]] semiclassical entropy estimate for a given black hole mass agrees with the logarithm of the corresponding Virasoro primary multiplicity in the moonshine module.  In the low-mass regime, there is a small quantum correction to the entropy, e.g., the lowest energy primary fields yield log(196883) ~ 12.19, while the Bekenstein–Hawking estimate gives 4π ~ 12.57.\n\nLater work has refined Witten's proposal.  Witten had speculated that the extremal CFTs with larger cosmological constant may have monster symmetry much like the minimal case, but this was quickly ruled out by independent work of Gaiotto and Höhn.  Work by Witten and Maloney ({{harvtxt|Maloney|Witten|2007}}) suggested that pure quantum gravity may not satisfy some consistency checks related to its partition function, unless some subtle properties of complex saddles work out favorably. However, Li–Song–Strominger ({{harvtxt|Li|Song|Strominger|2008}}) have suggested that a chiral quantum gravity theory proposed by Manschot in 2007 may have better stability properties, while being dual to the chiral part of the monster CFT, i.e., the monster vertex algebra. Duncan–Frenkel ({{harvtxt|Duncan|Frenkel|2009}}) produced additional evidence for this duality by using [[Rademacher sum]]s to produce the McKay–Thompson series as 2+1 dimensional gravity partition functions by a regularized sum over global torus-isogeny geometries.  Furthermore, they conjectured the existence of a family of twisted chiral gravity theories parametrized by elements of the monster, suggesting a connection with generalized moonshine and gravitational instanton sums.  At present, all of these ideas are still rather speculative, in part because 3d quantum gravity does not have a rigorous mathematical foundation.\n\n==Mathieu moonshine==\nIn 2010, Tohru Eguchi, Hirosi Ooguri, and Yuji Tachikawa observed that the elliptic genus of a [[K3 surface]] can be decomposed into characters of the ''N''=(4,4) [[superconformal algebra]], such that the multiplicities of [[Super Virasoro algebra|massive state]]s appear to be simple combinations of irreducible representations of the [[Mathieu group M24]].  This suggests that there is a sigma-model [[conformal field theory]] with K3 target that carries M24 symmetry.  However, by the Mukai–Kondo classification, there is no [[faithful action]] of this group on any K3 surface by [[Symplectomorphism|symplectic automorphism]]s, and by work of Gaberdiel–Hohenegger–Volpato, there is no faithful action on any K3 sigma-model conformal field theory, so the appearance of an action on the underlying [[Hilbert space]] is still a mystery.\n\nBy analogy with McKay–Thompson series, [[Miranda Cheng|Cheng]] suggested that both the [[multiplicity function]]s and the graded traces of nontrivial elements of M24 form [[mock modular form]]s.  In 2012, Gannon proved that all but the first of the multiplicities are non-negative [[Linear combination|integral combination]]s of representations of M24, and Gaberdiel–Persson–Ronellenfitsch–Volpato computed all analogues of generalized moonshine functions, strongly suggesting that some analogue of a holomorphic conformal field theory lies behind Mathieu moonshine.  Also in 2012, Cheng, Duncan, and [[Jeffrey A. Harvey|Harvey]] amassed numerical evidence of an [[umbral moonshine]] phenomenon where families of mock modular forms appear to be attached to [[Niemeier lattices]].  The special case of the ''A''<sub>1</sub><sup>24</sup> lattice yields Mathieu Moonshine, but in general the phenomenon does not yet have an interpretation in terms of geometry.\n\n==Origin of the term==\nThe term \"monstrous moonshine\" was coined by Conway, who, when told by [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]] in the late 1970s that the coefficient of <math>{q}</math> (namely 196884) was precisely one more than the degree of the smallest faithful complex representation of the monster group (namely 196883), replied that this was \"[[wikt:moonshine|moonshine]]\" (in the sense of being a crazy or foolish idea).<ref>[http://www.worldwidewords.org/topicalwords/tw-moo1.htm World Wide Words: Moonshine]</ref> Thus, the term not only refers to the monster group ''M''; it also refers to the perceived craziness of the intricate relationship between ''M'' and the theory of modular functions.\n\nThe monster group was investigated in the 1970s by [[mathematician]]s [[Jean-Pierre Serre]], [[Andrew Ogg]] and [[John G. Thompson]]; they studied the [[quotient group|quotient]] of the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] by [[subgroup]]s of SL<sub>2</sub>('''R'''), particularly, the [[normalizer]] Γ<sub>0</sub>(''p'')<sup>+</sup> of [[modular group Gamma0|&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>]](''p'') in SL(2,'''R'''). They found that the [[Riemann surface]] resulting from taking the quotient of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by Γ<sub>0</sub>(''p'')<sup>+</sup> has [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] zero [[if and only if]] ''p'' is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71. When Ogg heard about the monster group later on, and noticed that these were precisely the [[prime factor]]s of the size of ''M'', he published a paper offering a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact ({{harvtxt|Ogg|1974}}).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal|first1=John Horton|last1=Conway|first2=Simon P.|last2=Norton|title=Monstrous Moonshine|journal=Bull.

      "text": "In the mathematical branch of [[moonshine theory]], a '''supersingular prime''' is a [[prime number]] that [[divisor|divides]] the [[Order (group theory)|order]] of the [[Monster group]] ''M'', which is the largest [[sporadic simple group]].  There are precisely fifteen supersingular prime numbers: the first eleven primes ([[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[13 (number)|13]], [[17 (number)|17]], [[19 (number)|19]], [[23 (number)|23]], [[29 (number)|29]], and [[31 (number)|31]]), as well as [[41 (number)|41]], [[47 (number)|47]], [[59 (number)|59]], and [[71 (number)|71]]. {{OEIS|id=A002267}}\n\nThe non-supersingular primes are [[37 (number)|37]], [[43 (number)|43]], [[53 (number)|53]], [[61 (number)|61]], [[67 (number)|67]], and any prime number greater than or equal to [[73 (number)|73]]. All supersingular primes are [[Chen prime]]s, but 37, 53, and 67 are also Chen primes, and there are infinitely many Chen primes greater than 73. \n\nSupersingular primes are related to the notion of [[supersingular elliptic curve]]s as follows. For a prime number ''p'', the following are equivalent:\n\n# The [[modular curve]] ''X''<sub>0</sub><sup>+</sup>(''p'') = ''X''<sub>0</sub>(''p'') / ''w''<sub>p</sub>, where ''w''<sub>p</sub> is the [[Fricke involution]] of ''X''<sub>0</sub>(''p''), has [[Geometric genus|genus]] zero.  \n# Every supersingular elliptic curve in characteristic ''p'' can be defined over the [[prime subfield]] '''F'''<sub>p</sub>.\n# The order of the Monster group is divisible by ''p''.\n\nThe equivalence is due to [[Andrew Ogg]]. More precisely, in 1975 Ogg showed that the primes satisfying the first condition are exactly the 15 supersingular primes listed above and shortly thereafter learned of the (then conjectural) existence of a sporadic simple group having exactly these primes as prime divisors.  This strange coincidence was the beginning of the theory of [[Moonshine theory|monstrous moonshine]].\n\nThree non-supersingular primes occur in the orders of two other sporadic simple groups: 37 and 67 divide the order of the [[Lyons group]], and 37 and 43 divide the order of the [[Janko_group_J4|fourth Janko group]]. It immediately follows that these two are not [[subquotient]]s of the Monster group (they are two of the six [[pariah group]]s). The rest of the sporadic groups (including the other four pariahs, and also the [[Tits group]], if that is counted among the sporadics) have orders with only supersingular prime divisors. In fact,  other than the [[Baby Monster group]], they all have orders divisible only by primes less than or equal to 31, although no single sporadic group, other than the Monster itself, has all of them as prime divisors. The supersingular prime 47 also divides the order of the Baby Monster group, and the other three supersingular primes (41, 59, and 71) do not divide the order of any sporadic group other than the Monster itself.\n\n== References ==\n*{{MathWorld|title=Supersingular Prime|urlname=SupersingularPrime}}\n*{{MathWorld|title=Sporadic group|urlname=SporadicGroup}}\n*{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Ogg |last=Ogg |first=A.

They constructed it as the [[automorphism group]] of a certain lattice in the 248-dimensional Lie algebra of E<sub>8</sub>. It does not preserve the Lie bracket of this lattice, but does preserve the Lie bracket mod 3, so is a subgroup of the [[Chevalley group]] E<sub>8</sub>(3). The subgroup preserving the Lie bracket (over the integers) is a maximal subgroup of the Thompson group called the  [[Dempwolff group]] (which unlike the Thompson group is a subgroup of the compact Lie group E<sub>8</sub>).\n\n==Representations==\n\nThe centralizer of an element of order 3 of type 3C in the [[Monster group]] is a product of the Thompson group and a group of order 3, as a result of which the Thompson group acts on a [[vertex operator algebra]] over the field with 3 elements. This vertex operator algebra contains the E<sub>8</sub> Lie algebra over '''F'''<sub>3</sub>, giving the embedding of ''Th'' into E<sub>8</sub>(3).\n\nThe [[Schur multiplier]] and the [[outer automorphism group]] of the Thompson group are both trivial.\n\n==Generalized Monstrous Moonshine==\n\nConway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that [[monstrous moonshine]] is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups.

      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=May 2018}}\nIn [[mathematics]], '''umbral moonshine''' is a mysterious connection between [[Niemeier lattice]]s and  [[Ramanujan]]'s [[mock theta function]]s.  It is a generalization of the Mathieu moonshine phenomenon connecting representations of the [[Mathieu group M24]] with [[K3 surface]]s.\n\n== Mathieu moonshine ==\n\nThe prehistory of Mathieu moonshine starts with a theorem of Mukai, asserting that any group of symplectic automorphisms of a K3 surface embeds in the Mathieu group M23.  The moonshine observation arose from physical considerations: any K3 sigma-model conformal field theory has an action of the N=(4,4) [[superconformal algebra]], arising from a hyperkähler structure.  When {{harvs|txt | last3=Tachikawa | first3=Yuji | last2=Ooguri | first2=Hirosi | last1=Eguchi | first1=Tohru | year=2011 }} computed the first few terms of the decomposition of the elliptic genus of a K3 CFT into characters of the N=(4,4) superconformal algebra, they found that the multiplicities matched well with simple combinations of representations of M24.  However, by the Mukai–Kondo classification, there is no [[faithful action]] of this group on any K3 surface by [[Symplectomorphism|symplectic automorphism]]s, and by work of Gaberdiel–Hohenegger–Volpato, there is no faithful action on any K3 CFT, so the appearance of an action on the underlying [[Hilbert space]] is still a mystery.\n\nEguchi and Hikami showed that the N=(4,4) multiplicities are mock modular forms, and [[Miranda Cheng]] suggested that characters of elements of M24 should also be mock modular forms.  This suggestion became the Mathieu Moonshine conjecture, asserting that the virtual representation of N=(4,4) given by the K3 elliptic genus is an infinite dimensional graded representation of M24 with non-negative multiplicities in the massive sector, and that the characters are mock modular forms. In 2012, Terry Gannon proved that the representation of M24 exists.\n\n== Umbral moonshine ==\n\nIn 2012, {{harvtxt|Cheng|Duncan|Harvey|2012}} amassed numerical evidence of an extension of Mathieu moonshine, where families of mock modular forms were attached to divisors of 24.  After some group-theoretic discussion with Glauberman, {{harvtxt|Cheng|Duncan|Harvey|2013}} found that this earlier extension was a special case (the A-series) of a more natural encoding by Niemeier lattices.  For each Niemeier root system ''X'', with corresponding lattice ''L''<sup>''X''</sup>, they defined an '''umbral group''' ''G''<sup>''X''</sup>, given by the quotient of the automorphism group of ''L''<sup>X</sup> by the subgroup of reflections- these are also known as the stabilizers of deep holes in the [[Leech lattice]].  They conjectured that for each ''X'', there is an infinite dimensional graded representation ''K''<sup>''X''</sup> of ''G''<sup>''X''</sup>, such that the characters of elements are given by a list of vector-valued mock modular forms that they computed.  The candidate forms satisfy minimality properties quite similar to the genus-zero condition for [[Monstrous moonshine]].  These minimality properties imply the mock modular forms are uniquely determined by their shadows, which are vector-valued theta series constructed from the root system.  The special case where ''X'' is the ''A''<sub>1</sub><sup>24</sup> root system yields precisely Mathieu Moonshine.  The umbral moonshine conjecture has been proved in {{harvtxt|Duncan|Griffin|Ono|2015}}.\n\nThe name of umbral moonshine derives from the use of shadows in the theory of mock modular forms.  Other moonlight-related words like 'lambency' were given technical meanings (in this case, the genus zero group attached to a shadow ''S''<sup>''X''</sup>, whose level is the dual Coxeter number of the root system ''X'') by Cheng, Duncan, and Harvey to continue the theme.\n\nAlthough the umbral moonshine conjecture has been settled, there are still many questions that remain.  For example, connections to geometry and physics are still not very solid, although there is work relating umbral functions to duVal singularities on K3 surfaces by Cheng and Harrison.   As another example, the current proof of the umbral moonshine conjecture is ineffective, in the sense that it does not give natural constructions of the representations.  This is similar to the situation with monstrous moonshine during the 1980s: Atkin, Fong, and Smith showed by computation that a moonshine module exists in 1980, but did not give a construction.  The effective proof of the Conway-Norton conjecture was given by Borcherds in 1992, using the monster representation constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman.  There is a vertex algebra construction for the ''E''<sub>8</sub><sup>3</sup> case by Duncan and Harvey, where ''G''<sup>''X''</sup> is the symmetric group ''S''<sub>3</sub>.  However, the algebraic structure is given by an asymmetric cone gluing construction, suggesting that it is not the last word.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Monstrous moonshine]]\n\n==References==\n\n*{{Citation | last3=Harvey | first3=Jeffrey A. | last2=Duncan | first2=John F.

However, these theories – transformation groups, integration of differential equations, the geometry of contact – did not arise in a vacuum. They were preceded by particular results of a more limited scope, which pointed the way to more general theories that followed. The line-sphere correspondence is surely an example of this phenomenon: It so clearly sets the stage for Lie’s subsequent work on contact transformations and symmetry groups.\" R. Milson (2000) \"An Overview of Lie’s line-sphere correspondence\", pp 1–10 of ''The Geometric Study of Differential Equations'', J.A. Leslie & T.P. Robart editors, [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|0-8218-2964-5}} , quotation pp 8,9</ref>  For instance, the latter subject is [[Lie sphere geometry]]. This article addresses his approach to transformation groups, which is one of the [[areas of mathematics]], and was worked out by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Élie Cartan]].\n\nThe foundation of Lie theory is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] relating [[Lie algebra]]s to [[Lie group]]s which is called the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]]. The subject is part of [[differential geometry]] since Lie groups are [[differentiable manifold]]s. Lie groups evolve out of the identity (1) and the [[tangent vector]]s to [[one-parameter group|one-parameter subgroups]] generate the Lie algebra. The structure of a Lie group is implicit in its algebra, and the structure of the Lie algebra is expressed by [[root system]]s and [[Root datum|root data]].\n\nLie theory has been particularly useful in [[mathematical physics]] since it describes the standard transformation groups: the [[Galilean group]], the [[Lorentz group]], the [[Poincaré group]] and the [[conformal group of spacetime]].\n\n==Elementary Lie theory==\nThe [[one-parameter group]]s are the first instance of Lie theory. The [[compact space|compact]] case arises through [[Euler's formula]] in the [[complex plane]]. Other one-parameter groups occur in the [[split-complex number]] plane as the [[unit hyperbola]]\n:<math>\\lbrace \\exp(i t) = \\cosh(t) + i \\sinh(t) : t \\in R \\rbrace,</math>\nand in the [[dual number]] plane as the line <math>\\lbrace \\exp(\\varepsilon t) = 1 + \\varepsilon t :  t \\in R \\rbrace.</math>\nIn these cases the Lie algebra parameters have names: [[angle]], [[hyperbolic angle]], and [[slope]]. Using the appropriate \"angle\",  and a radial vector, any one of these planes can be given a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]]. Any one of these decompositions, or Lie algebra renderings, may be necessary for rendering the Lie subalgebra of a [[2 × 2 real matrix]].\n\nThere is a classical 3-parameter Lie group and algebra pair: the [[versor|quaternions of unit length]] which can be identified with the [[3-sphere]]. Its Lie algebra is the subspace of [[quaternion]] vectors. Since the [[commutator]] ij &minus; ji = 2k, the Lie bracket in this algebra is twice the [[cross product]] of ordinary [[vector analysis]].\n\nAnother elementary 3-parameter example is given by the [[Heisenberg group]] and its Lie algebra.\nStandard treatments of Lie theory often begin with the [[classical group]]s.\n\n==History and scope==\nEarly expressions of Lie theory are found in books composed by [[Sophus Lie]] with [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]] and [[Georg Scheffers]] from 1888 to 1896.\n\nIn Lie's early work, the idea was to construct a theory of ''continuous groups'', to complement the theory of [[discrete group]]s that had developed in the theory of [[modular form]]s, in the hands of [[Felix Klein]] and [[Henri Poincaré]]. The initial application that Lie had in mind was to the theory of [[differential equation]]s. On the model of [[Galois theory]] and [[polynomial equation]]s, the driving conception was of a theory capable of unifying, by the study of [[symmetry]], the whole area of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.\n\nAccording to historian Thomas W. Hawkins, it was [[Élie Cartan]] that made Lie theory what it is:\n:While Lie had many fertile ideas, Cartan was primarily responsible for the extensions and applications of his theory that have made it a basic component of modern mathematics. It was he who, with some help from [[Hermann Weyl|Weyl]], developed the seminal, essentially algebraic ideas of [[Wilhelm Killing|Killing]] into the theory of the structure and representation of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s that plays such a fundamental role in present-day Lie theory. And although Lie envisioned applications of his theory to geometry, it was Cartan who actually created them, for example through his theories of symmetric and generalized spaces, including all the attendant apparatus ([[moving frame]]s, exterior [[differential form]]s, etc.)<ref>Thomas Hawkins (1996) ''[[Historia Mathematica]]'' 23(1):92–5</ref>\n\n==Lie's three theorems==\nIn his work on transformation groups, Sophus Lie proved three theorems relating the groups and algebras that bear his name. The first theorem exhibited the basis of an algebra through [[infinitesimal transformation]]s.<ref name=RG/>{{rp|96}} The second theorem exhibited [[structure constants]] of the algebra as the result of [[commutator#Ring theory|commutator products]] in the algebra.<ref name=RG/>{{rp|100}} The [[Lie's third theorem|third theorem]] showed these constants are anti-symmetric and satisfy the [[Jacobi identity]].<ref name=RG/>{{rp|106}} As Robert Gilmore wrote:\n:Lie's three theorems provide a mechanism for constructing the Lie algebra associated with any Lie group. They also characterize the properties of a Lie algebra. ¶ The converses of Lie’s three theorems do the opposite: they supply a mechanism for associating a Lie group with any finite dimensional Lie algebra ... [[Taylor's theorem]] allows for the construction of a canonical analytic structure function &phi;(&beta;,&alpha;) from the Lie algebra. ¶ These seven theorems – the three theorems of Lie and their converses, and Taylor's theorem – provide an essential equivalence between Lie groups and algebras.<ref name=RG>Robert Gilmore (1974) ''Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and some of their Applications'', page 87, [[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] {{ISBN|0-471-30179-5}}</ref>\n\n==Aspects of Lie theory==\n\nLie theory is frequently built upon a study of the classical [[linear algebraic group]]s.

      "text": "[[File:Simply Laced Dynkin Diagrams.svg|thumb|The [[simply laced Dynkin diagram]]s classify diverse mathematical objects.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''ADE classification''' (originally '''''A-D-E'' classifications''') is a situation where certain kinds of objects are in correspondence with [[simply laced Dynkin diagram]]s. The question of giving a common origin to these classifications, rather than a posteriori verification of a parallelism, was posed in {{Harv|Arnold|1976}}. The complete list of [[simply laced Dynkin diagram]]s comprises\n:<math>A_n, \\, D_n, \\, E_6, \\, E_7, \\, E_8.</math>\n\nHere \"simply laced\" means that there are no multiple edges, which corresponds to all simple roots in the [[root system]] forming angles of <math>\\pi/2 = 90^\\circ</math> (no edge between the vertices) or <math>2\\pi/3 = 120^\\circ</math> (single edge between the vertices). These are two of the four families of Dynkin diagrams (omitting <math>B_n</math> and <math>C_n</math>), and three of the five exceptional Dynkin diagrams (omitting <math>F_4</math> and <math>G_2</math>).\n\nThis list is non-redundant if one takes <math>n \\geq 4</math> for <math>D_n.</math> If one extends the families to include redundant terms, one obtains the [[exceptional isomorphism]]s\n:<math>D_3 \\cong A_3, E_4 \\cong A_4, E_5 \\cong D_5,</math>\nand corresponding isomorphisms of classified objects.\n\nThe ''A'', ''D'', ''E'' nomenclature also yields the simply laced [[finite Coxeter group]]s, by the same diagrams: in this case the Dynkin diagrams exactly coincide with the Coxeter diagrams, as there are no multiple edges.\n\n== Lie algebras ==\nIn terms of complex semisimple Lie algebras:\n* <math>A_n</math> corresponds to <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}(\\mathbf{C}),</math> the [[special linear Lie algebra]] of [[traceless]] operators, \n* <math>D_n</math> corresponds to <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf{C}),</math> the even [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] of even-dimensional [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]] operators, and\n* <math>E_6, E_7, E_8</math> are three of the five exceptional Lie algebras.\n\nIn terms of [[compact Lie algebra]]s and corresponding [[simple Lie group#Simply laced groups|simply laced Lie group]]s:\n* <math>A_n</math> corresponds to <math>\\mathfrak{su}_{n+1},</math> the algebra of the [[special unitary group]] <math>SU(n+1);</math>\n* <math>D_n</math> corresponds to <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}(\\mathbf{R}),</math> the algebra of the even [[projective special orthogonal group]] <math>PSO(2n)</math>, while\n* <math>E_6, E_7, E_8</math> are three of five exceptional [[compact Lie algebra]]s.\n\n== Binary polyhedral groups ==\nThe same classification applies to discrete subgroups of <math>SU(2)</math>, the [[binary polyhedral group]]s; properly, binary polyhedral groups correspond to the simply laced ''affine'' [[Dynkin diagram]]s <math>\\tilde A_n, \\tilde D_n, \\tilde E_k,</math> and the representations of these groups can be understood in terms of these diagrams. This connection is known as the '''{{visible anchor|McKay correspondence}}''' after [[John McKay (mathematician)|John McKay]]. The connection to [[Platonic solid]]s is described in {{Harv|Dickson|1959}}. The correspondence uses the construction of [[McKay graph]].\n\nNote that the ADE correspondence is ''not'' the correspondence of Platonic solids to their [[reflection group]] of symmetries: for instance, in the ADE correspondence the [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]/[[octahedron]], and [[dodecahedron]]/[[icosahedron]] correspond to <math>E_6, E_7, E_8,</math> while the reflection groups of the tetrahedron, cube/octahedron, and dodecahedron/icosahedron are instead representations of the [[Coxeter group]]s <math>A_3, BC_3,</math> and <math>H_3.</math>\n\nThe [[orbifold]] of <math>\\mathbf{C}^2</math> constructed using each discrete subgroup leads to an ADE-type singularity at the origin, termed a [[du Val singularity]].\n\nThe McKay correspondence can be extended to multiply laced Dynkin diagrams, by using a ''pair'' of binary polyhedral groups. This is known as the '''Slodowy correspondence''', named after [[Peter Slodowy]] – see {{Harv|Stekolshchik|2008}}.\n\n== Labeled graphs ==\nThe ADE graphs and the extended (affine) ADE graphs can also be characterized in terms of labellings with certain properties,<ref>{{Harv|Proctor|1993}}</ref> which can be stated in terms of the [[discrete Laplace operator]]s<ref>{{Harv|Proctor|1993|loc = p. 940}}</ref> or [[Cartan matrices]]. Proofs in terms of Cartan matrices may be found in {{Harv|Kac|1990|loc = pp. 47–54}}.\n\nThe affine ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling (labeling of the nodes by positive real numbers) with the following property:\n:Twice any label is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices.\nThat is, they are the only positive functions with eigenvalue 1 for the discrete Laplacian (sum of adjacent vertices minus value of vertex) – the positive solutions to the homogeneous equation:\n:<math>\\Delta \\phi = \\phi.\\ </math>\nEquivalently, the positive functions in the kernel of <math>\\Delta - I.</math> The resulting numbering is unique up to scale, and if normalized such that the smallest number is 1, consists of small integers – 1 through 6, depending on the graph.\n\nThe ordinary ADE graphs are the only graphs that admit a positive labeling with the following property:\n:Twice any label minus two is the sum of the labels on adjacent vertices.\nIn terms of the Laplacian, the positive solutions to the inhomogeneous equation:\n:<math>\\Delta \\phi = \\phi - 2.\\ </math>\nThe resulting numbering is unique (scale is specified by the \"2\") and consists of integers; for E<sub>8</sub> they range from 58 to 270, and have been observed as early as {{Harv|Bourbaki|1968}}.\n\n== Other classifications ==\nThe [[Catastrophe theory#Elementary catastrophes|elementary catastrophes]] are also classified by the ADE classification.\n\nThe ADE diagrams are exactly the [[quiver (mathematics)|quiver]]s of finite type, via [[Gabriel's theorem]].\n\nThere is also a link with [[generalized quadrangle]]s, as the three non-degenerate GQs with three points on each line correspond to the three exceptional root systems ''E''<sub>6</sub>, ''E''<sub>7</sub> and ''E''<sub>8</sub>.<ref>Cameron P.J.; Goethals, J.M.; Seidel, J.J; Shult, E. E. ''Line graphs, root systems and elliptic geometry''</ref>\nThe classes ''A'' and ''D'' correspond degenerate cases where the line set is empty or we have all lines passing through a fixed point, respectively.<ref>Godsil Chris; Gordon Royle. ''Algebraic Graph Theory'', Chapter 12</ref>\n\nThere are deep connections between these objects, hinted at by the classification;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} some of these connections can be understood via [[string theory]] and [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nThe [[minimal models]] of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] have an ADE classification.\n\n== Trinities ==\nArnold has subsequently proposed many further connections in this{{which|date=July 2012}} vein, under the rubric of \"mathematical trinities\",<ref>Arnold, Vladimir, 1997, Toronto Lectures, ''[http://www.pdmi.ras.ru/~arnsem/Arnold/arn-papers.html Lecture 2: Symplectization, Complexification and Mathematical Trinities],'' June 1997 (last updated August, 1998).

Arnold terms these \"[[Trinity|trinities]]\" to evoke religion, and suggest that (currently) these parallels rely more on faith than on rigorous proof, though some parallels are elaborated. Further trinities have been suggested by other authors.<ref>''[http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~chapoton/trinites.html Les trinités remarquables],'' [http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/~chapoton/ Frédéric Chapoton] {{fr icon}}</ref><ref name=\"arntrin\">{{citation | last = le Bruyn | first = Lieven | title = Arnold's trinities | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/arnolds-trinities | date = 17 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = le Bruyn | first = Lieven | title = Arnold's trinities version 2.0 | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/arnolds-trinities-version-20 | date = 20 June 2008 }}</ref> Arnold's trinities begin with '''R'''/'''C'''/'''H''' (the real numbers, complex numbers, and quaternions), which he remarks \"everyone knows\", and proceeds to imagine the other trinities as \"complexifications\" and \"quaternionifications\" of classical (real) mathematics, by analogy with finding symplectic analogs of classic Riemannian geometry, which he had previously proposed in the 1970s. In addition to examples from differential topology (such as [[characteristic class]]es), Arnold considers the three Platonic symmetries (tetrahedral, octahedral, icosahedral) as corresponding to the reals, complexes, and quaternions, which then connects with McKay's more algebraic correspondences, below.\n\n[[McKay correspondence|McKay's correspondences]] are easier to describe. Firstly, the extended Dynkin diagrams <math>\\tilde E_6, \\tilde E_7, \\tilde E_8</math> (corresponding to tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral symmetry) have symmetry groups <math>S_3, S_2, S_1,</math> respectively, and the associated [[folding (Dynkin diagram)|foldings]] are the diagrams <math>\\tilde G_2, \\tilde F_4, \\tilde E_8</math> (note that in less careful writing, the extended (tilde) qualifier is often omitted). More significantly, McKay suggests a correspondence between the nodes of the <math>\\tilde E_8</math> diagram and certain conjugacy classes of the [[monster group]], which is known as ''McKay's E<sub>8</sub> observation;''<ref>[http://arxiv4.library.cornell.edu/abs/0810.1465 Arithmetic groups and the affine E<sub>8</sub> Dynkin diagram], by John F.

McKay further relates the nodes of <math>\\tilde E_7</math> to conjugacy classes in 2.''B'' (an order 2 extension of the [[baby monster group]]), and the nodes of <math>\\tilde E_6</math> to conjugacy classes in 3.''Fi''<sub>24</sub>' (an order 3 extension of the [[Fischer group]])<ref name=\"monster\" /> – note that these are the three largest [[sporadic group]]s, and that the order of the extension corresponds to the symmetries of the diagram.\n\nTurning from large simple groups to small ones, the corresponding Platonic groups <math>A_4, S_4, A_5</math> have connections with the [[projective special linear group]]s PSL(2,5), PSL(2,7), and PSL(2,11) (orders 60, 168, and 660),<ref>{{Citation | id = see: The Embedding of PSl(2, 5) into PSl(2, 11) and Galois’ Letter to Chevalier. | title = The Graph of the Truncated Icosahedron and the Last Letter of Galois | first = Bertram | last = Kostant | journal = Notices Amer.

Associated geometries (tilings on [[Riemann surface]]s) in which the action on ''p'' points can be seen are as follows: PSL(2,5) is the symmetries of the icosahedron (genus 0) with the [[compound of five tetrahedra]] as a 5-element set, PSL(2,7) of the [[Klein quartic]] (genus 3) with an embedded (complementary) [[Fano plane]] as a 7-element set (order 2 biplane), and PSL(2,11) the '''{{visible anchor|buckminsterfullerene surface}}''' (genus 70) with embedded [[Paley biplane]] as an 11-element set (order 3 [[biplane geometry|biplane]]).<ref name=\"martin\">{{ citation | last1 = Martin | first1 = Pablo | last2 = Singerman | first2 = David | title = From Biplanes to the Klein quartic and the Buckyball | url = http://www.neverendingbooks.org/DATA/biplanesingerman.pdf | date = April 17, 2008 }}</ref> Of these, the icosahedron dates to antiquity, the Klein quartic to Klein in the 1870s, and the buckyball surface to Pablo Martin and David Singerman in 2008.\n\nAlgebro-geometrically, McKay also associates E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub> respectively with: the [[27 lines on a cubic surface]], the 28 [[Bitangents of a quartic|bitangents of a plane quartic curve]], and the 120 tritangent planes of a canonic sextic curve of genus 4.<ref>Arnold 1997, p. 13</ref><ref>{{Harv|McKay, John|Sebbar, Abdellah|2007|loc=p. 11}}</ref> The first of these is well-known, while the second is connected as follows: projecting the cubic from any point not on a line yields a double cover of the plane, branched along a quartic curve, with the 27 lines mapping to 27 of the 28 bitangents, and the 28th line is the image of the [[exceptional curve]] of the blowup.

For example, if ''G'' is GL(''n'') (the Lie group of [[invertible matrix|''n''-by-''n'' invertible matrices]]), its Lie algebra is the [[vector space]] of all (not necessarily invertible) ''n''-by-''n'' matrices. So in this example, the adjoint representation is the vector space of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices <math> x </math>, and any element ''g'' in GL(''n'') [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] as a linear transformation of this vector space given by conjugation: <math> x \\mapsto g x g^{-1} </math>.\n\nFor any Lie group, this natural [[group representation|representation]] is obtained by linearizing (i.e. taking the [[Differential of a function|differential]] of) the [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]]. The adjoint representation can be defined for [[linear algebraic group]]s over arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|fields]].\n\n==Definition==\n{{see also|Representation theory|Lie group#The Lie algebra associated with a Lie group}}\nLet ''G'' be a [[Lie group]], and let\n:<math>\\Psi: G \\to \\operatorname{Aut}(G)</math>\nbe the mapping {{math|''g'' ↦ Ψ<sub>''g''</sub>}},  \nwith Aut(''G'') the [[automorphism group]] of ''G'' and {{math|Ψ<sub>''g''</sub>: ''G'' → ''G''}} given by the [[inner automorphism]] (conjugation)\n:<math>\\Psi_g(h)= ghg^{-1}~.</math>\nThis Ψ is a [[Lie_group#Homomorphisms_and_isomorphisms|Lie group homomorphism]].\n\nFor each ''g'' in ''G'', define {{math|Ad<sub>''g''</sub>}} to be the [[tangent space|derivative]] of {{math|Ψ<sub>''g''</sub>}} at the origin:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g = (d\\Psi_g)_e : T_eG \\rightarrow T_eG</math>\nwhere  {{mvar|d}} is the differential and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = T_e G</math> is the [[tangent space]] at the origin  {{mvar|e}} ({{mvar|e}} being the identity element of the group  {{mvar|G}}). Since <math>\\Psi_g</math> is a Lie group automorphism, Ad<sub>''g''</sub> is a Lie algebra automorphism; i.e., an invertible [[linear transformation]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> to itself that preserves the [[Lie algebra#Definitions|Lie bracket]]. Moreover, since <math>g \\mapsto \\Psi_g</math> is a group homomorphism, <math>g \\mapsto \\operatorname{Ad}_g</math> too is a group homomorphism.<ref>Indeed, by [[chain rule]], <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{gh} = d (\\Psi_{gh})_e = d (\\Psi_g \\circ \\Psi_h)_e = d (\\Psi_g)_e \\circ d (\\Psi_h)_e = \\operatorname{Ad}_g \\circ \\operatorname{Ad}_h.</math></ref> Hence, the map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}\\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g), \\, g \\mapsto \\mathrm{Ad}_g</math>\nis a [[group representation]] called the '''adjoint representation''' of ''G''.\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersed Lie subgroup of the general linear group <math>\\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> (called immersely linear Lie group), then the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> consists of matrices and the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is the matrix exponential <math>\\operatorname{exp}(X) = e^X</math> for matrices ''X'' with small operator norms. Thus, for ''g'' in ''G'' and small ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, taking the derivative of <math>\\Psi_g(\\operatorname{exp}(tX)) = ge^{t X}g^{-1}</math> at ''t'' = 0, one gets:\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(X) = gX g^{-1}</math>\nwhere on the right we have the products of matrices. If <math>G \\subset \\mathrm{GL}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> is a closed subgroup (that is, ''G'' is a matrix Lie group), then this formula is valid for all ''g'' in ''G'' and all ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\nSuccinctly, an adjoint representation is an [[isotropy representation]] associated to the conjugation action of ''G'' around the identity element of ''G''.\n\n===Derivative of Ad===\nOne may always pass from a representation of a Lie group ''G'' to a [[representation of a Lie algebra|representation of its Lie algebra]] by taking the derivative at the identity.\n\nTaking the derivative of the adjoint map\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad} : G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math>\nat the identity element gives the '''adjoint representation''' of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> of ''G'':\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{ad} : & \\, \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) \\\\\n& \\,x \\mapsto \\operatorname{ad}_x = d(\\operatorname{Ad})_e(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g) = \\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Aut}(\\mathfrak{g}))</math> is the Lie algebra of <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math> which may be identified with the [[differential algebra#Derivation on a Lie algebra|derivation algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. One can show that\n:<math>\\mathrm{ad}_x(y) = [x,y]\\,</math>\nfor all <math>x,y \\in \\mathfrak g</math>, where the right hand side is given (induced) by the [[Lie bracket of vector fields]]. Indeed,<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi–Nomizu|loc=page 41}}</ref> recall that, viewing <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the Lie algebra of left-invariant vector fields on ''G'', the bracket on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is given as:<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi–Nomizu|loc=Proposition 1.9.}}</ref> for left-invariant vector fields ''X'', ''Y'',\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(d \\varphi_{-t}(Y) - Y)</math>\nwhere <math>\\varphi_t: G \\to G</math> denotes the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] generated by ''X''. As it turns out, <math>\\varphi_t(g) = g\\varphi_t(e)</math>, roughly because both sides satisfy the same ODE defining the flow. That is, <math>\\varphi_t = R_{\\varphi_t(e)}</math> where <math>R_h</math> denotes the right multiplication by <math>h \\in G</math>. On the other hand, since <math>\\Psi_g = R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g</math>, by [[chain rule]],\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = d (R_{g^{-1}} \\circ L_g)(Y) = d R_{g^{-1}} (d L_g(Y)) = d R_{g^{-1}}(Y)</math>\nas ''Y'' is left-invariant. Hence,\n:<math>[X, Y] = \\lim_{t \\to 0} {1 \\over t}(\\operatorname{Ad}_{\\varphi_t(e)}(Y) - Y)</math>,\nwhich is what was needed to show.\n\nThus, <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x</math> coincides with the same one defined in [[#Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra]] below. Ad and ad are related through the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]: Specifically, Ad<sub>exp(''x'')</sub> = exp(ad<sub>''x''</sub>) for all ''x'' in the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref> It is a consequence of the general result relating Lie group and Lie algebra homomorphisms via the exponential map.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n\nIf ''G'' is an immersely linear Lie group, then the above computation simplifies: indeed, as noted early, <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_g(Y) = gYg^{-1}</math> and thus with <math>g = e^{tX}</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{Ad}_{e^{tX}}(Y) = e^{tX} Y e^{-tX}</math>.\nTaking the derivative of this at <math>t = 0</math>, we have:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_X Y = XY - YX</math>.\nThe general case can also be deduced from the linear case: indeed, let <math>G'</math> be an immersely linear Lie group having the same Lie algebra as that of ''G''. Then the derivative of Ad at the identity element for ''G'' and that for ''G{{'}}'' coincide; hence, without loss of generality, ''G'' can be assumed to be ''G{{'}}''.\n\nThe upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature.  Thus, for example, a vector {{mvar|x}}    in the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> generates a [[vector field]] {{mvar|X}}    in the group  {{mvar|G}}.  Similarly, the adjoint map {{math|ad<sub>x</sub>y {{=}} [''x'',''y'']}} of vectors in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is homomorphic{{clarify|map is homomorphic??|date=December 2018}} to the [[Lie derivative]] {{math|L<sub>''X''</sub>''Y'' {{=}} [''X'',''Y'']}} of vector fields on the group  {{mvar|G}} considered as a [[manifold]].\n\nFurther see the [[derivative of the exponential map]].\n\n== Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over some field. Given an element {{mvar|x}} of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines the adjoint action of {{mvar|x}} on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> as the map \n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x :\\mathfrak{g}\\to \\mathfrak{g} \\qquad  \\text{with}   \\qquad \\operatorname{ad}_x (y) = [x,y]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|y}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. It is called the '''adjoint endomorphism''' or '''adjoint action'''. Since a bracket is bilinear, this determines the [[linear map|linear mapping]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}:\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\operatorname{End}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by {{math|''x'' ↦ ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}. Within End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:\n:<math>[T, S]= T \\circ S - S \\circ T</math>\nwhere <math>\\circ</math> denotes composition of linear maps. Using the above definition of the bracket, the [[Jacobi identity]]\n:<math>[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0</math> \ntakes the form \n:<math>\\left([\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y]\\right)(z) = \\left(\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\\right)(z)</math>\nwhere {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}}, and {{mvar|z}} are arbitrary elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThis last identity says that <big>ad</big> is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets. Hence, <big>ad</big> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] and is called the '''adjoint representation''' of the algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is finite-dimensional, then End<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the Lie algebra of the [[general linear group]] of the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIn a more module-theoretic language, the construction says that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a module over itself.\n\nThe kernel of <big>ad</big> is the [[center (algebra)|center]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (rephrasing of the definition). On the other hand, for each element {{mvar|z}} in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ad<sub>''z''</sub> obeys the [[General Leibniz rule|Leibniz' law]]:\n:<math>\\delta ([x,y]) = [\\delta(x),y] + [x, \\delta(y)]</math>\nfor all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in the algebra (the restatement of the Jacobi identity). That is to say, ad<sub>''z''</sub> is a [[Lie algebra extension#Derivations|derivation]] and the image of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> under ad is \na subalgebra of Der<math>(\\mathfrak{g})</math>, the space of all derivations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nWhen <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G'', <big>ad</big> is the differential of <big>Ad</big> at the identity element of ''G'' (see [[#Derivative of Ad]] above).\n\n== Structure constants ==\n\nThe explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the [[structure constants]] of the algebra. That is, let {e<sup>i</sup>} be a set of [[basis vectors]] for the algebra, with \n:<math>[e^i,e^j]=\\sum_k{c^{ij}}_k e^k.</math>\nThen the matrix elements for \nad<sub>e<sup>i</sup></sub>\nare given by\n:<math>{\\left[ \\operatorname{ad}_{e^i}\\right]_k}^j = {c^{ij}}_k ~. </math>\n\nThus, for example, the adjoint representation of '''su(2)''' is the defining rep of '''so(3)'''.\n\n== Examples ==\n*If ''G'' is [[abelian group|abelian]] of dimension ''n'', the adjoint representation of ''G'' is the trivial ''n''-dimensional representation.\n*If ''G'' is a [[matrix Lie group]] (i.e. a closed subgroup of GL(''n'',ℂ)), then its Lie algebra is an algebra of ''n''×''n'' matrices with the commutator for a Lie bracket (i.e. a subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb C)</math>). In this case, the adjoint map is given by Ad<sub>''g''</sub>(''x'') = ''gxg''<sup>−1</sup>.\n*If ''G'' is [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] (real 2×2 matrices with [[determinant]] 1), the Lie algebra of ''G'' consists of real 2×2 matrices with [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] 0.  The representation is equivalent to that given by the action of ''G'' by linear substitution on the space of binary (i.e., 2 variable) [[quadratic form]]s.\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe following table summarizes the properties of the various maps mentioned in the definition\n\n{| align=center border=1 cellpadding=2 style=\"border: solid 1pt black; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n| align=center | <math>\\Psi\\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(G)\\,</math>\n| align=center | <math>\\Psi_g\\colon G \\to G\\,</math>\n|-\n| valign=top | Lie group homomorphism:\n* <math>\\Psi_{gh} = \\Psi_g\\Psi_h</math>\n| valign=top | Lie group automorphism:\n* <math>\\Psi_g(ab) = \\Psi_g(a)\\Psi_g(b)</math>\n* <math>(\\Psi_g)^{-1} = \\Psi_{g^{-1}}</math>\n|-\n| align=center | <math>\\mathrm{Ad}\\colon G \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathfrak g)</math>\n| align=center | <math>\\mathrm{Ad}_g\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak g</math>\n|-\n| valign=top | Lie group homomorphism:\n* <math>\\mathrm{Ad}_{gh} = \\mathrm{Ad}_g\\mathrm{Ad}_h</math>\n| valign=top | Lie algebra automorphism:\n* <math>\\mathrm{Ad}_g</math> is linear\n* <math>(\\mathrm{Ad}_g)^{-1} = \\mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}}</math>\n* <math>\\mathrm{Ad}_g[x,y] = [\\mathrm{Ad}_g x,\\mathrm{Ad}_g y]</math>\n|-\n| align=center | <math>\\mathrm{ad}\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak g)</math>\n| align=center | <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak g</math>\n|-\n| valign=top | Lie algebra homomorphism:\n* <math>\\mathrm{ad}</math> is linear\n* <math>\\mathrm{ad}_{[x,y]} = [\\mathrm{ad}_x,\\mathrm{ad}_y]</math>\n| valign=top | Lie algebra derivation:\n* <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x</math> is linear\n* <math>\\mathrm{ad}_x[y,z] = [\\mathrm{ad}_x y ,z] + [y,\\mathrm{ad}_x z]</math>\n|}\n\nThe [[image (mathematics)|image]] of ''G'' under the adjoint representation is denoted by Ad(''G''). If ''G'' is [[connected space|connected]], the [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] of the adjoint representation coincides with the kernel of Ψ which is just the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''. Therefore the adjoint representation of a connected Lie group ''G'' is [[faithful representation|faithful]] if and only if ''G'' is centerless. More generally, if ''G'' is not connected, then the kernel of the adjoint map is the [[centralizer]] of the [[identity component]] ''G''<sub>0</sub> of ''G''. By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we have\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}(G) \\cong G/Z_G(G_0).</math>\n\nGiven a finite-dimensional real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, by [[Lie's third theorem]], there is a connected Lie group <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> whose Lie algebra is the image of the adjoint representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> (i.e., <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})) = \\operatorname{ad}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.) It is called the '''adjoint group''' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nNow, if <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the Lie algebra of a connected Lie group ''G'', then <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is the image of the adjoint representation of ''G'': <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g}) = \\operatorname{Ad}(G)</math>.\n\n== Roots of a semisimple Lie group ==\nIf ''G'' is [[semisimple group|semisimple]], the non-zero [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] of the adjoint representation form a [[root system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.3</ref> (In general, one needs to pass to the complexification of the Lie algebra before proceeding.)  To see how this works, consider the case ''G'' = SL(''n'', '''R'''). We can take the group of diagonal matrices diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) as our [[maximal torus]] ''T''.  Conjugation by an element of ''T'' sends\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&a_{12}&\\cdots&a_{1n}\\\\\na_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\na_{n1}&a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\mapsto\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}&t_1t_2^{-1}a_{12}&\\cdots&t_1t_n^{-1}a_{1n}\\\\\nt_2t_1^{-1}a_{21}&a_{22}&\\cdots&t_2t_n^{-1}a_{2n}\\\\\n\\vdots&\\vdots&\\ddots&\\vdots\\\\\nt_nt_1^{-1}a_{n1}&t_nt_2^{-1}a_{n2}&\\cdots&a_{nn}\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThus, ''T'' acts trivially on the diagonal part of the Lie algebra of ''G'' and with eigenvectors ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup> on the various off-diagonal entries.  The roots of ''G'' are the weights diag(''t''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''t''<sub>''n''</sub>) → ''t''<sub>''i''</sub>''t''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>&minus;1</sup>.  This accounts for the standard description of the root system of ''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;SL<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') as the set of vectors of the form ''e<sub>i</sub>''−''e<sub>j</sub>''.\n\n=== Example SL(2, R) ===\nWhen computing the root system for one of the simplest cases of Lie Groups, the group SL(2, '''R''') of two dimensional matrices with determinant 1 consists of the set of matrices of the form:\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'' real and ''ad''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''bc''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA maximal compact connected abelian Lie subgroup, or maximal torus ''T'', is given by the subset of all matrices of the form\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_2\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\exp(\\theta) & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\exp(-\\theta) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nwith <math> t_1 t_2 = 1 </math>. The Lie algebra of the maximal torus is the Cartan subalgebra consisting of the matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\theta & 0\\\\\n0 & -\\theta \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} = \n\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}-\\theta\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\theta(e_1-e_2).\n</math>\n\nIf we conjugate an element of SL(2, ''R'') by an element of the maximal torus we obtain\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nt_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1/t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & b\\\\\nc & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1/t_1 & 0\\\\\n0 & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na t_1 & b t_1 \\\\\nc / t_1 & d / t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 / t_1 & 0\\\\\n0       & t_1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na       & b t_1^2\\\\\nc t_1^{-2} & d\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe matrices\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0\\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nare then 'eigenvectors' of the conjugation operation with eigenvalues <math>1,1,t_1^2, t_1^{-2}</math>. The function Λ which gives <math>t_1^2</math> is a multiplicative character, or homomorphism from the group's torus to the underlying field R. The function λ giving θ is a weight of the Lie Algebra with weight space given by the span of the matrices.\n\nIt is satisfying to show the multiplicativity of the character and the linearity of the weight. It can further be proved that the differential of Λ can be used to create a weight. It is also educational to consider the case of SL(3, '''R''').\n\n== Variants and analogues ==\nThe adjoint representation can also be defined for [[algebraic group]]s over any field.<!-- even for an elliptic curve? -->{{clarify|give a definition|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe '''co-adjoint representation''' is the [[contragredient representation]] of the adjoint representation.  [[Alexandre Kirillov]] observed that the [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] of any vector in a co-adjoint representation is a [[symplectic manifold]].  According to the philosophy in [[representation theory]] known as the '''orbit method''' (see also the [[Kirillov character formula]]), the irreducible representations of a Lie group ''G'' should be indexed in some way by its co-adjoint orbits.

It is a two-parameter nonabelian Lie group, so with merely two generators (Lie algebra elements), {{math|''A'', ''B''}}, s.t. <math>[A,B]=B</math>, where \n:<math> A= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right), \\qquad B=   \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right),   </math>\nso that \n:<math> e^{aA+bB}= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} e^a & \\tfrac{b}{a}(e^a-1)\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right) . </math>\n\n== Character table of Aff('''F'''{{sub|''p''}}) ==\n<math>\\operatorname{Aff}(\\mathbf{F}_p)</math> has order <math>p(p-1)</math>.

Then we know that <math>\\operatorname{Aff}(\\mathbf{F}_p)</math> has <math>p</math> irreducible representations. By above paragraph ({{section link|#Matrix representation}}),  there exists <math>p-1</math> one-dimensional representations, decided by the homomorphism <math>\\rho_k:\\operatorname{Aff}(\\mathbf{F}_p)\\to\\Complex^*</math> for <math>k=1,2,\\dots p-1</math>, where <math>\\rho_k\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}=\\exp\\left(\\frac{2i kj\\pi}{p-1}\\right)</math> and <math>i^2=-1, a=g^j</math>, {{mvar|g}} is a generator of the group <math>\\mathbf{F}_p^*</math> . Then compare with the order of <math>\\mathbf{F}_p</math>, we have <math>p(p-1)=p-1+\\chi_p^2</math>, hence <math>\\chi_p=p-1</math> is the dimension of the last irreducible representation.

[[Euclidean geometry]] corresponds to the subgroup of congruencies. It is characterized by [[Euclidean distance]] or [[angle]], which are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the subgroup of rotations.\n\nCase (2) corresponds to [[shear mapping]]s. An important application is [[absolute time and space]] where [[Galilean transformation]]s relate frames of reference. They generate the Galilean group.\n\nCase (3) corresponds to [[squeeze mapping]]. These transformations generate a subgroup, of the planar affine group, called the [[Lorentz group]] of the plane. The geometry associated with this group is characterized by [[hyperbolic angle]], which is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] that is invariant under the subgroup of squeeze mappings.\n\nUsing the above matrix representation of the affine group on the plane, the matrix ''M'' is a [[2 × 2 real matrix]]. Accordingly, a non-singular ''M'' must have one of three forms that correspond to the trichotomy of Artzy.\n\n==Other affine groups==\n\n===General case===\nGiven any subgroup <math>G < \\operatorname{GL}(V)</math> of the [[general linear group]],\none can produce an affine group, sometimes denoted <math>\\operatorname{Aff}(G)</math> analogously as <math>\\operatorname{Aff}(G) := V \\rtimes G</math>.\n\nMore generally and abstractly, given any group ''G'' and a [[group representation|representation]] of ''G'' on a vector space ''V'',\n<math>\\rho\\colon G \\to \\operatorname{GL}(V)</math>\none gets<ref>Since <math>\\operatorname{GL}(V) < \\operatorname{Aut}(V)</math>. Note that this containment is in general proper, since by \"automorphisms\" one means ''group'' automorphisms, i.e., they preserve the group structure on ''V'' (the addition and origin), but not necessarily scalar multiplication, and these groups differ if working over '''R'''.</ref> an associated affine group <math>V \\rtimes_\\rho G</math>: one can say that the affine group obtained is \"a [[group extension]] by a vector representation\", and as above, one has the short exact sequence:\n:<math>1 \\to V \\to V \\rtimes_\\rho G \\to G \\to 1.</math>\n\n===Special affine group===\n{{main|Special affine group}}\nThe subset of all invertible affine transformations preserving a fixed volume form, or in terms of the semi-direct product, the set of all elements {{nowrap|(''M'', ''v'')}} with ''M'' of determinant 1, is a subgroup known as the [[special affine group]].\n\n===Projective subgroup===\nPresuming knowledge of [[projectivity]] and the projective group of [[projective geometry]], the affine group can be easily specified. For example, Günter Ewald wrote:.<ref>Günter Ewald (1971) ''Geometry: An Introduction'', p. 241, Belmont: Wadsworth {{ISBN|9780534000349}}</ref>\n:The set <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math> of all projective collineations of ''P''<sup>''n''</sup> is a group which we may call the '''projective group''' of ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>. If we proceed from ''P''<sup>''n''</sup> to the affine space ''A''<sup>''n''</sup> by declaring a [[hyperplane]] ''&omega;'' to be a [[hyperplane at infinity]], we obtain the '''affine group''' <math>\\mathfrak{A}</math> of ''A''<sup>''n''</sup> as the [[subgroup]] of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math> consisting of all elements of <math>\\mathfrak{P}</math> that leave ''&omega;'' fixed.\n::<math>\\mathfrak{A} \\subset \\mathfrak{P}</math>\n\n===Poincaré group===\n{{main|Poincaré group}}\nThe [[Poincaré group]] is the affine group of the [[Lorentz group]] <math>\\operatorname{O}(1,3)</math>: <math>\\mathbf{R}^{1,3}\\rtimes \\operatorname{O}(1,3)</math>\n\nThis example is very important in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Holomorph (mathematics)|Holomorph]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* [[Roger Lyndon]] (1985) ''Groups and Geometry'', Section VI.1, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-31694-4}}.\n\n[[Category:Affine geometry]]\n[[Category:Group theory]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]"
