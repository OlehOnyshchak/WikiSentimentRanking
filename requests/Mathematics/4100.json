R.]], [[Simon & Schuster|Simon and Schuster]], pp. 1074-1093.</ref> This conjecture was not widely adopted, and by the 1940s, the experimental values for the constant were clearly inconsistent with it (i.e. closer to 137.036).<ref>Helge Kragh, \"Magic Number: A Partial History of the Fine-Structure Constant\", ''Archive for History of Exact Sciences'' '''57''':5:395 (July, 2003) {{doi|10.1007/s00407-002-0065-7}}</ref>\n* Physicist [[Leon M. Lederman]] numbered his home near [[Fermilab]] 137 based on the significance of the number to those in his profession. Lederman expounded on the significance of the number in his book ''The God Particle: If the Universe Is the Answer, What Is the Question?'', noting that not only was it the inverse of the fine-structure constant, but was also related to the probability that an electron will emit or absorb a photon—i.e., Feynman's conjecture.{{refn|''There is a most profound and beautiful question associated with the observed coupling constant, e, the amplitude for a real electron to emit or absorb a real photon. It is a simple number that has been experimentally determined to be close to −0.08542455. (My physicist friends won’t recognize this number, because they like to remember it as the inverse of its square: about 137.03597 with about an uncertainty of about 2 in the last decimal place. It has been a mystery ever since it was discovered more than fifty years ago, and all good theoretical physicists put this number up on their wall and worry about it.) Immediately you would like to know where this number for a coupling comes from: is it related to p or perhaps to the base of natural logarithms?  Nobody knows. It’s one of the greatest damn mysteries of physics: a magic number that comes to us with no understanding by man. You might say the “hand of God” wrote that number, and “we don’t know how He pushed his pencil”. We know what kind of a dance to do experimentally to measure this number very accurately, but we don’t know what kind of dance to do on the computer to make this number come out, without putting it in secretly!'' — R. P. Feynman, ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''|group=n}} He added that it also \"contains the crux of electromagnetism (the electron), relativity (the velocity of light), and quantum theory (Planck's constant). It would be less unsettling if the relationship between all these important concepts turned out to be one or three or maybe a multiple of pi. But 137?” The number 137, according to Lederman, \"shows up naked all over the place”, meaning that scientists on any planet in the universe using whatever units they have for charge or speed, and whatever their version of Planck’s constant may be, will all come up with 137, because it is a pure number. Lederman recalled that [[Richard Feynman]] had even suggested that all physicists put a sign in their offices with the number 137 to remind them of just how much they do not know.<ref>[[Leon M. Lederman|Lederman, L. M.]], ''The God Particle: If the Universe is the Answer, What is the Question?'' (1993), [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]], pp. 28–29.</ref>\n* In the [[Bohr model]], the innermost electron of an atom with ''Z'' = 137 would be orbiting (just below) the speed of light, and the next element (''Z'' = 138) would be \"impossible\".  Since the Bohr model does not include either quantum mechanics or special relativity, the fact that it breaks down in this regime is not unexpected.  However, such large atoms (if their nuclei were stable) could be expected to behave rather differently from a naive extrapolation of trends in the periodic table.\n* [[Wolfgang Pauli]], a pioneer of [[quantum physics]], died in a hospital room numbered 137, a coincidence that disturbed him.<ref>[[Walter Gratzer|Gratzer, W.]], ''The Pauli Principle'' in \"Eurekas and Euphorias\", (2002) [[OUP|Oxford University Press]], pp. 49–52.</ref>\n\n==In esoterism==\n\n* The fine structure constant of physics continues to convince esotericists that the universe has numerological fine tuning:<ref>[http://www.integralworld.net/piacenza4.html The mystery of 137], www.integralworld.net.</ref> for example the [[age of the universe]] could be considered as roughly 13.7 times 1 billion years, though newer estimates put this value at 13.8.<ref name=\"Planck 2015\">{{Cite journal\n |author=Planck Collaboration\n |year=2016\n |title=Planck 2015 results.

In Modern Hebrew, the root of Kabbalah {{lang|he|ק-ב-ל}} can mean either \"receiving\" or \"parallel\".

It is used to describe the “corresponding loops”, which, when clasped together, enjoined the two sections of the Tabernacle’s ceiling.

The colours show that 153 is also the sum of the first five positive [[factorial]]s.]]\n\nThe number 153 has several mathematical properties. It is the sum of the first 17 integers and is also the sum of the first five positive factorials, 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5!. The number 153 is associated with the geometric shape known as the [[Vesica Piscis]] or Mandorla. [[Archimedes]], in his ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'', referred to this ratio (153/265), as constituting the \"measure of the fish\", this ratio being an imperfect representation of 1/{{radic|3}}.\n\nAs a [[triangular number]], 153 is the sum of the first [[17 (number)|17]] integers, and is also the sum of the first five positive [[factorial]]s:<math>1!+2!+3!+4!+5!</math>.<ref name=\"Wells\">Wells, D. ''[[The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers]]'' London: Penguin Group. (1987): 140–141.</ref>\n\nThe number 153 is also a [[hexagonal number]], and a truncated triangle number, meaning that 1, 15, and 153 are all triangle numbers.\n\nThe distinct prime factors of 153 add up to 20, and so do the ones of 154, hence the two form a [[Ruth-Aaron pair]].\n\nSince <math>153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3</math>, it is a 3-[[narcissistic number]], and it is also the smallest three-digit number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits.<ref>{{Cite web|last= Gupta |first= Shayam Sunder |title= Curious Properties of 153 |url=http://www.shyamsundergupta.com/c153.htm |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}</ref> Only five other numbers can be expressed as the sum of the cubes of their digits: [[zero (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], 370, 371 and 407.<ref>[[OEIS:A046197]]</ref> It is also a [[Friedman number]], since 153 = 3 × 51, and a [[Harshad number]] in base 10, being divisible by the sum of its own digits.\n\nThe [[Biggs–Smith graph]] is a [[symmetric graph]] with 153 edges, all equivalent.\n\nAnother feature of the number 153 is that it is the limit of the following algorithm:<ref name=\"MathPages\">[https://archive.today/20130128083125/http://www.mathpages.com/HOME/kmath463.htm Catch of the Day (153 Fishes) at mathpages.com].</ref><ref>[[OEIS:A165330]]</ref>\n\n# Take a random positive [[integer]], divisible by [[3|three]]\n# Split that number into its base 10 digits\n# Take the sum of their cubes\n# Go back to the second step\n\nAn example, starting with the number [[84 (number)|84]]:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n8^3 + 4^3 &=& 512 + 64 &=& 576\\\\\n5^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 &=& 125 + 343 + 216 &=& 684\\\\\n6^3 + 8^3 + 4^3 &=& 216 + 512 + 64  &=& 792\\\\\n7^3 + 9^3 + 2^3 &=& 343 + 729 + 8  &=& 1080\\\\\n1^3 + 0^3 + 8^3 + 0^3  &=& 1 + 0 + 512 + 0  &=& 513\\\\\n5^3 + 1^3 + 3^3 &=& 125 + 1 + 27  &=& 153\\\\\n1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 &=& 1 + 125 + 27  &=& 153\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==In the Bible==\n[[File:153fishes.jpg|thumb|240px|The ''Miraculous catch of 153 fish'' by [[Duccio]], 14th century, showing [[Jesus]] and the 7 fishing disciples (with [[Saint Peter]] leaving the boat).]]\nIt has been noted that the [[Tetragrammaton]] occurs 153 times in the [[Book of Genesis]].<ref>Toy, C.

[[Jerome]], for example, wrote that [[Oppian]]'s ''Halieutica'' listed 153 species of fish, although this could not have been the intended meaning of the Gospel writer because Oppian composed ''Halieutica'' after the Gospel text was written, and at any rate never gave a list of fish species that clearly adds up to 153.<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Christians and Animals |last= Grant |first= Robert McQueen |page= 23 |publisher= Routledge |year= 1999 |ISBN= 0-415-20204-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal= Harvard Theological Review |volume= 42 |issue= 4 |date=October 1949 |title= One Hundred Fifty-Three Large Fish (John 21:11) |jstor= 1508507 |pages= 273–275 |last= Grant |first= Robert M. |doi=10.1017/s0017816000024329}}</ref>\n\n[[Augustine of Hippo]] argued that the significance lay in the fact that 153 is the sum of the first 17 [[integer]]s (i.e. 153 is the 17th [[triangular number]]), with 17 representing the combination of [[divine grace]] (the 7 [[gifts of the Spirit]]) and law (the [[Ten Commandments]]).<ref>Jason Byassee, ''Praise Seeking Understanding: Reading the Psalms with Augustine'', Wm.
