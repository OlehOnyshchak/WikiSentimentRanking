It begins\n:0, 1, 4, 5, 16, 17, 20, 21, 64, 65, 68, 69, 80, 81, 84, 85, 256, ... {{OEIS|A000695}}\nFor instance, 69 belongs to this sequence because it equals 64 + 4 + 1, a sum of three distinct powers of 4.\n\n==Binary and related representations==\nAnother definition of the Moser–de Bruijn sequence is that it is the ordered sequence of numbers whose [[binary representation]] has nonzero digits only in the even positions. For instance, 69 belongs to the sequence, because its binary representation 1000101<sub>2</sub> has nonzero digits in the positions for 2<sup>6</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, and 2<sup>0</sup>, all of which have even exponents. The numbers in the sequence can also be described as the numbers whose [[Quaternary numeral system|base-4 representation]] uses only the digits 0 or 1.<ref name=\"oeis\">{{Cite OEIS|A000695|name=Moser-de Bruijn sequence}}</ref> For a number in this sequence, the base-4 representation can be found from the binary representation by skipping the binary digits in odd positions, which should all be zero. Another way of looking at it is that these are numbers whose [[hexadecimal]] representation contains only the digits 0, 1, 4, 5. For instance, 69 = 1011<sub>4</sub> = 45<sub>16</sub>.\n\nEquivalently, they are the numbers whose binary and [[negabinary]] representations are equal.<ref name=\"oeis\"/><ref name=\"arndt\">{{citation|last=Arndt|first=Jörg|title=Matters Computational: Ideas, Algorithms, Source Code|publisher=Springer|year=2011|url=http://jjj.de/fxt/fxtbook.pdf|pages=59, 750}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Moser–de Bruijn counts.svg|thumb|upright=1.65|Plot of the number of sequence elements up to <math>n</math> divided by <math>\\sqrt n</math>, on a logarithmic horizontal scale]]\nIt follows from either the binary or base-4 definitions of these numbers that they grow roughly in proportion to the [[square number]]s. The number of elements in the Moser–de Bruijn sequence that are below any given threshold <math>n</math> is proportional to <math>\\sqrt n</math>,<ref name=\"golomb\"/>\na fact which is also true of the square numbers. In fact the numbers in the Moser–de Bruijn sequence are the squares for a version of arithmetic without [[Carry (arithmetic)|carrying]] on binary numbers, in which the addition and multiplication of single bits are respectively the [[exclusive or]] and [[logical conjunction]] operations.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Applegate | first1 = David | author1-link = David Applegate\n | last2 = LeBrun | first2 = Marc\n | last3 = Sloane | first3 = N.

However,\nthis set is too sparse to provide nontrivial lower bounds for the Furstenberg–Sárközy theorem.\n\n==Unique representation as sums==\nThe Moser–de Bruijn sequence obeys a property similar to that of a [[Sidon sequence]]: the sums <math>x+2y</math>, where <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> both belong to the Moser–de Bruijn sequence, are all unique. No two of these sums have the same value. Moreover, every integer <math>n</math> can be represented as a sum <math>x+2y</math>, where <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> both belong to the Moser–de Bruijn sequence.

The same bit pattern should be extended or reduced in the obvious way to handle other word sizes.</ref>\n\nThe Moser–de Bruijn sequence is the only sequence with this property, that all integers have a unique expression as <math>x+2y</math>.

The inverse of this bijection gives a linear ordering on the points in the plane with non-negative integer coordinates, which may be used to define the [[Z-order curve]].<ref name=\"oeis\"/><ref name=\"morton\">{{citation\n | last1 = Thiyagalingam | first1 = Jeyarajan\n | last2 = Beckmann | first2 = Olav\n | last3 = Kelly | first3 = Paul H.

If <math>x</math> is an element of the sequence, then the next member after <math>x</math> can be obtained by filling in the bits in odd positions of the binary representation of <math>x</math> by ones, adding one to the result,\nand then masking off the filled-in bits. Filling the bits and adding one can be combined into a single addition operation. That is, the next member is the number given by the formula\n:<math>(x + \\textrm{0xaaaaaaab})\\ \\&\\ \\textrm{0x55555555}</math>.<ref name=\"oeis\"/><ref name=\"32bit\"/><ref name=\"morton\"/>\nThe two hexadecimal constants appearing in this formula can be interpreted as the [[p-adic number|2-adic numbers]] <math>1/3</math> and <math>-1/3</math>, respectively.<ref name=\"oeis\"/>\n\n==Subtraction game==\n{{harvtxt|Golomb|1966}} investigated a game, analogous to [[subtract a square]], based on this sequence. In Golomb's game, two players take turns removing coins from a pile of <math>n</math> coins. In each move, a player may remove any number of coins that belongs to the Moser–de Bruijn sequence. Removing any other number of coins is not allowed. The winner is the player who removes the last coin.\nAs Golomb observes, the \"cold\" positions of this game (the ones in which the player who is about to move is losing) are exactly the positions of the form <math>2y</math> where <math>y</math> belongs to the Moser–de Bruijn sequence. A winning strategy for playing this game is to decompose the current number of coins, <math>n</math>, into <math>x+2y</math> where <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> both belong to the Moser–de Bruijn sequence, and then (if <math>x</math> is nonzero) to remove <math>x</math> coins, leaving a cold position to the other player. If <math>x</math> is zero, this strategy is not possible, and there is no winning move.<ref name=\"golomb\">{{citation\n | last = Golomb | first = Solomon W. | authorlink = Solomon W.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_partition",
      "text": "In [[number theory]], a '''multiplicative partition''' or '''unordered factorization''' of an integer ''n'' that is greater than 1 is a way of writing ''n'' as a product of integers greater than 1, treating two products as equivalent if they differ only in the ordering of the factors. The number ''n'' is itself considered one of these products. Multiplicative partitions closely parallel the study of '''multipartite partitions''', discussed in {{harvtxt|Andrews|1976}}, which are additive [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] of finite sequences of positive integers, with the addition made [[pointwise]]. Although the study of multiplicative partitions has been ongoing since at least 1923, the name \"multiplicative partition\" appears to have been introduced by {{harvtxt|Hughes|Shallit|1983}}. The Latin name \"factorisatio numerorum\" had been used previously.  [[MathWorld]] uses the term '''unordered factorization'''.\n\n==Examples==\n*The number 20 has four multiplicative partitions: 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5, 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10, 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5, and 20. \n*3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9, 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;27, 9&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;9, and 81 are the five multiplicative partitions of 81 = 3<sup>4</sup>. Because it is the fourth power of a [[prime number|prime]], 81 has the same number (five) of multiplicative partitions as 4 does of [[partition (number theory)|additive partitions]].\n*The number 30 has five multiplicative partitions: 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5 = 2&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;15 = 6&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;5 = 3&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10 = 30.\n*In general, the number of multiplicative partitions of a [[Square-free integer|squarefree]] number with '''i''' prime factors is the ith [[Bell number]], B<sub>i</sub>.\n\n==Application==\n{{harvtxt|Hughes|Shallit|1983}} describe an application of multiplicative partitions in classifying integers with a given number of divisors. For example, the integers with exactly 12 divisors take the forms ''p''<sup>11</sup>, ''p''&times;''q''<sup>5</sup>, ''p''<sup>2</sup>&times;''q''<sup>3</sup>, and ''p''&times;''q''&times;''r''<sup>2</sup>, where ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are distinct [[prime number]]s; these forms correspond to the multiplicative partitions 12, 2&times;6, 3&times;4, and 2&times;2&times;3 respectively. More generally, for each multiplicative partition\n:<math>k = \\prod t_i</math>\nof the integer ''k'', there corresponds a class of integers having exactly ''k'' divisors, of the form\n:<math>\\prod p_i^{t_i-1},</math>\nwhere each ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> is a distinct prime. This correspondence follows from the [[Multiplicative function|multiplicative]] property of the [[divisor function]].\n\n==Bounds on the number of partitions==\n{{harvtxt|Oppenheim|1926}} credits {{harvtxt|McMahon|1923}} with the problem of counting the number of multiplicative partitions of ''n''; this problem has since been studied by other others under the Latin name of ''factorisatio numerorum''. If the number of multiplicative partitions of ''n'' is ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, McMahon and Oppenheim observed that its [[Dirichlet series]] generating function ''f''(''s'') has the product representation\n\n:<math>f(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_n}{n^s}=\\prod_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{1-k^{-s}}.</math>\n\nThe sequence of numbers ''a<sub>n</sub>'' begins\n\n:1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 5, ... {{OEIS|id=A001055}}.\n\nOppenheim also claimed an upper bound on ''a<sub>n</sub>'', of the form\n:<math>a_n\\le n\\left(\\exp\\frac{\\log n\\log\\log\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right)^{-2+o(1)},</math>\nbut as {{harvtxt|Canfield|Erdős|Pomerance|1983}} showed, this bound is erroneous and the true bound is\n\n:<math>a_n\\le n\\left(\\exp\\frac{\\log n\\log\\log\\log n}{\\log\\log n}\\right)^{-1+o(1)}.</math>\n\nBoth of these bounds are not far from linear in ''n'': they are of the form ''n''<sup>1&minus;o(1)</sup>.\nHowever, the typical value of ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is much smaller: the average value of ''a<sub>n</sub>'', averaged over an interval ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x''+''N'', is\n:<math>\\bar a = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{\\log N}}{\\sqrt{2e}\\log\\log N}\\bigl(1+o(1)\\bigr)\\right),</math>\na bound that is of the form ''n''<sup>o(1)</sup> {{harv|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}}.\n\n==Additional results==\n{{harvtxt|Canfield|Erdős|Pomerance|1983}} observe, and {{harvtxt|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}} prove, that most numbers cannot arise as the number ''a<sub>n</sub>'' of multiplicative partitions of some ''n'': the number of values less than ''N'' which arise in this way is ''N''<sup>O(log&nbsp;log&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;/&nbsp;log&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')</sup>. Additionally, {{harvtxt|Luca|Mukhopadhyay|Srinivas|2008}} show that most values of ''n'' are not multiples of ''a<sub>n</sub>'': the number of values ''n'' ≤ ''N'' such that ''a<sub>n</sub>'' divides ''n'' is O(''N''&nbsp;/&nbsp;log<sup>1&nbsp;+&nbsp;o(1)</sup>&nbsp;''N'').\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[partition (number theory)]]\n*[[divisor]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first=G.|last=Andrews|authorlink=George E.

A number that is ''k''-perfect for a certain ''k'' is called a multiply perfect number. As of 2014, ''k''-perfect numbers are known for each value of ''k'' up to 11.<ref name=fl/>\n\nIt can be proven that:\n\n* For a given [[prime number]] ''p'', if ''n'' is ''p''-perfect and ''p'' does not divide ''n'', then ''pn'' is (''p''+1)-perfect.  This implies that an integer ''n'' is a 3-perfect number divisible by 2 but not by 4, if and only if ''n''/2 is an odd [[perfect number]], of which none are known.\n* If 3''n'' is 4''k''-perfect and 3 does not divide ''n'', then ''n'' is 3''k''-perfect.\n\nAn open question is whether all ''k''-perfect numbers are divisible by ''k''!, where \"!\" is the [[factorial]].\n\n== Smallest ''k''-perfect numbers ==\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the smallest ''k''-perfect numbers for ''k'' ≤ 11 {{OEIS|A007539}}:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

      "title": "Narayana number",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narayana_number",
      "text": "In [[combinatorics]], the '''Narayana numbers''' ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;''k''), ''n'' = 1, 2, 3 ..., 1&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''n'', form a [[triangular array]] of [[natural number]]s, called '''Narayana triangle,''' that occur in various [[Combinatorial enumeration|counting problems]]. They are named after [[Canadian ]][[mathematician]] [[Tadepalli Venkata Narayana|T. V. Narayana]] (1930–1987).\n\n== Formula ==\nThe Narayana numbers can be expressed in terms of [[binomial coefficient]]s:\n\n: <math>N(n,k) = \\frac{1}{n}{n\\choose k}{n\\choose k-1}.</math>\n\n== Numerical values ==\nThe first eight rows of the Narayana triangle read:\n\n <u>''k'' =       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8</u>\n ''n'' = 1  |  1\n     2  |  1   1\n     3  |  1   3   1\n     4  |  1   6   6   1\n     5  |  1  10  20  10   1\n     6  |  1  15  50  50  15   1\n     7  |  1  21 105 175 105  21   1\n     8  |  1  28 196 490 490 196  28   1\n\n{{OEIS|id=A001263}}\n\n== Combinatorial interpretations ==\nAn example of a counting problem whose solution can be given in terms of the Narayana numbers ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;''k''), is the number of expressions containing ''n'' pairs of parentheses, which are correctly matched and which contain ''k'' distinct nestings. For instance, ''N''(4,&nbsp;2) = 6 as with four pairs of parentheses six sequences can be created which each contain two times the sub-pattern '()':\n\n ()((()))  (())(())  (()(()))  ((()()))  ((())())  ((()))()\n\nFrom this example it should be obvious that ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;1) = 1, since the only way to get a single sub-pattern '()' is to have all the opening parentheses in the first n positions, followed by all the closing parentheses. Also ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;''n'') = 1, as distinct nestings can be achieved only by the repetitive pattern ()()() ... (). More generally, it can be shown that the Narayana triangle is symmetric: ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;''k'') = ''N''(''n'',&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''1'').\n\nThe sum of the rows in this triangle equal the [[Catalan numbers]]:\n\n:<math>N(n,1) + N(n,2) + N(n,3) + \\cdots + N(n,n) = C_n.</math>\n\nTo illustrate this relationship, the Narayana numbers also count the number of paths from (0,&nbsp;0) to (2''n'',&nbsp;0), with steps only northeast and southeast, not straying below the ''x''-axis, with ''k'' peaks.\n\nThe following figures represent the Narayana numbers ''N''(4,&nbsp;''k''):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ''N''(4,&nbsp;''k'')\n! Paths\n|-\n| ''N''(4,&nbsp;1) = '''1''' path with 1 peak:\n| [[File:Narayana N(4, 1).svg]]\n|-\n| ''N''(4,&nbsp;2) = '''6''' paths with 2 peaks:\n| [[File:Narayana N(4, 2).svg]]\n|-\n| ''N''(4,&nbsp;3) = '''6''' paths with 3 peaks:\n| [[File:Narayana N(4, 3).svg]]\n|-\n| ''N''(4,&nbsp;4) = '''1''' path with 4 peaks:\n| [[File:Narayana N(4, 4).svg]]\n|}\n\nThe sum of ''N''(4,&nbsp;''k'') is 1 + 6 + 6 + 1, or 14, which is the same as Catalan number ''C''<sub>4</sub>. This sum coincides with the interpretation of Catalan numbers as the number of monotonic paths along the edges of an ''n'' × ''n'' grid that do not pass above the diagonal.\n\n== Partitions ==\n[[File:Noncrossing partitions 4; Hasse.svg|thumb|The 1,6,6,1 [[noncrossing partition]]s with 1,2,3,4,5 blocks of a 4-element set]]\nIn the study of partitions, we see that in a set containing '''n''' elements, we may partition that set in <math>B_n</math> different ways, where <math>B_n</math> is the '''n<sup>th</sup>''' [[Bell number]].  Furthermore, the number of ways to partition a set into exactly '''k''' blocks we use the [[Stirling numbers of the second kind|Stirling number]]s <math>S(n,k)</math>.  Both of these concepts are a bit off-topic, but a necessary foundation for understanding the use of the Narayana numbers.  In both of the above two notions crossing partitions are accounted for.\n\nTo reject the crossing partitions and count only the [[noncrossing partition]]s, we may use the [[Catalan number]]s to count the non-crossing partitions of all '''n''' elements of the set, <math>C_n</math>.  To count the non-crossing partitions in which the set is partitioned in exactly '''k''' blocks, we use the Narayana number <math>N(n,k)</math>.\n\n== Generating function ==\nThe generating function of the Narayana numbers is{{sfn|Petersen|2015|p=25}}\n:<math>\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^n N(n,k) z^n t^{k-1} = \\frac{1+z(t-1) - \\sqrt{1-2z(t+1)+z^2(t-1)^2}}{2z} \\;.\n</math>\n<!-- Petersen is indexing the k from 0 to n-1 -->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catalan number]]\n* [[Delannoy number]]\n* [[Motzkin number]]\n* [[Schröder number]]\n* [[Pascal's triangle]]\n* [[File:Wikiversity-logo-en.svg|20px]] [[v:Partition related number triangles|Partition related number triangles]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |author=P.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncototient",
      "text": "In mathematics, a '''noncototient''' is a positive integer ''n'' that cannot be expressed as the difference between a positive integer ''m'' and the number of [[coprime]] integers below it. That is, ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;φ(''m'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'', where φ stands for [[Euler's totient function]], has no solution for&nbsp;''m''.  The ''[[cototient]]'' of ''n'' is defined as ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;φ(''n''), so a '''noncototient''' is a number that is never a cototient.\n\nIt is conjectured that all noncototients are even. This follows from a modified form of the slightly stronger version of the [[Goldbach conjecture]]: if the even number ''n'' can be represented as a sum of two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q,'' then\n\n:<math>pq - \\varphi(pq) = pq - (p-1)(q-1) = p+q-1 = n-1. \\,</math>\n\nIt is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 5 is a noncototient.

Weak orderings in turn have many other applications. For instance, in [[horse racing]], [[photo finish]]es have eliminated most but not all ties, called in this context [[List of dead heat horse races|dead heats]], and the outcome of a race that may contain ties (including all the horses, not just the first three finishers) may be described using a weak ordering. For this reason, the ordered Bell numbers count the possible number of outcomes of a horse race,<ref name=\"horse\"/> or the possible outcomes of a multi-candidate [[election]].<ref>{{citation|title=Famous Puzzles of Great Mathematicians|first=Miodrag|last=Petković|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2009|isbn=9780821886304|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmSftwkAocAC&pg=PA194}}.</ref> In contrast, when items are ordered or ranked in a way that does not allow ties (such as occurs with the ordering of cards in a deck of cards, or batting orders among [[baseball]] players), the number of orderings for ''n'' items is a [[factorial|factorial number]] ''n''!,<ref>{{citation|title=Combinatorics and Graph Theory|series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]]|first1=John|last1=Harris|first2=Jeffry L.|last2=Hirst|first3=Michael J.|last3=Mossinghoff|edition=2nd|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9780387797106|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxSoZcNymacC&pg=PA132}}.</ref> which is significantly smaller than the corresponding ordered Bell number.<ref name=\"ek\"/>\n\n{{harvtxt|Kemeny|1956}} uses the ordered Bell numbers to describe the \"complexity\" of an [[Finitary relation|''n''-ary relation]], by  which he means the number of other relations one can form from it by permuting and repeating its arguments (lowering the arity with every repetition).<ref>{{citation|title=Two measures of complexity|first=John G.|last=Kemeny|authorlink=John Kemeny (computer scientist)|journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]]|volume=52|issue=24|pages=722–733|jstor=2022697|year=1956}}.</ref> In this application, for each derived relation, the arguments of the original relation are weakly ordered by the positions of the corresponding arguments of the derived relation.\n\n{{harvtxt|Velleman|Call|1995}} consider [[combination lock]]s with a numeric keypad, in which several keys may be pressed simultaneously and a combination consists of a sequence of keypresses that includes each key exactly once.

In this theory, grammars for [[natural language]]s are constructed by ranking certain constraints, and (in a phenomenon called factorial typology) the number of different grammars that can be formed in this way is limited to the number of permutations of the constraints. A paper reviewed by Ellison and Klein suggested an extension of this linguistic model in which ties between constraints are allowed, so that the ranking of constraints becomes a weak order rather than a total order. As they point out, the much larger magnitude of the ordered Bell numbers, relative to the corresponding [[factorial]]s, allows this theory to generate a much richer set of grammars.<ref name=\"ek\">{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana & Langendoen, D.

For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 8 as an ordered sum of 2s and 3s:\n\n::2 + 2 + 2 + 2  ;  2 + 3 + 3  ;  3 + 2 + 3  ;  3 + 3 + 2\n\n* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which no term is 2 is ''P''(2''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 4 as an ordered sum in which no term is 2:\n\n::4  ;  1 + 3  ;  3 + 1  ;  1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as a palindromic ordered sum in which no term is 2 is ''P''(''n''). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 6 as a palindromic ordered sum in which no term is 2:\n\n::6  ;  3 + 3  ;  1 + 4 + 1  ;  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n\n* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which each term is odd and greater than 1 is equal to ''P''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 11 as an ordered sum in which each term is odd and greater than 1:\n\n::11 ; 5 + 3 + 3 ; 3 + 5 + 3 ; 3 + 3 + 5\n\n* The number of ways of writing ''n'' as an ordered sum in which each term is congruent to 2 mod 3 is equal to ''P''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4). For example, ''P''(6) = 4, and there are 4 ways to write 10 as an ordered sum in which each term is congruent to 2 mod 3:\n\n::8 + 2  ;  2 + 8  ;  5 + 5  ;  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\n\n==Generating function==\nThe [[generating function]] of the Padovan sequence is\n\n:<math>G(P(n);x)=\\frac{1+x}{1-x^2-x^3}.</math>\n\nThis can be used to prove identities involving products of the Padovan sequence with geometric terms, such as:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{P(n)}{2^n} = \\frac{12}{5}.</math>\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{P(n)}{\\alpha^n} = \\frac{\\alpha^2(\\alpha+1)}{\\alpha^3-\\alpha-1}.</math>\n\n== Generalizations ==\n\nIn a similar way to the [[Fibonacci numbers]] that can be generalized to a set of polynomials\ncalled the [[Fibonacci polynomials]], the Padovan sequence numbers can be generalized to\nyield the [[Padovan polynomials]].\n\n== Padovan L-system ==\n\nIf we define the following simple grammar:\n\n:     '''variables''' :   A  B  C\n:     '''constants''' :   none\n:     '''start'''     :   A\n:     '''rules'''     :   (A &rarr; B), (B &rarr; C), (C &rarr; AB)\n\nthen this Lindenmayer system or [[L-system]] produces the following sequence of strings:\n\n:     ''n'' = 0 : A\n:     ''n'' = 1 : B\n:     ''n'' = 2 : C\n:     ''n'' = 3 : AB\n:     ''n'' = 4 : BC\n:     ''n'' = 5 : CAB\n:     ''n'' = 6 : ABBC\n:     ''n'' = 7 : BCCAB \n:     ''n'' = 8 : CABABBC\n\nand if we count the length of each string, we obtain the Padovan sequence of numbers:\n\n:    1  1  1 2 2 3 4 5  ...\n\nAlso, if you count the number of ''A''s, ''B''s and ''C''s in each string, then for the ''n''th\nstring, you have ''P''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5) ''A''s, ''P''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3) ''B''s and ''P''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;4) ''C''s.

      "text": "[[File:Ferrer partitioning diagrams.svg|thumb|The values <math>p(1), \\dots p(8)</math> of the partition function (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, and 22) can be determined by counting the [[Young diagram]]s for the partitions of the numbers from 1 to 8.]]\nIn [[number theory]], the '''partition function''' <math>p(n)</math> represents the [[number]] of possible [[Partition (number theory)|partitions]] of a non-negative integer <math>n</math>. For instance, <math>p(4)=5</math> because the integer <math>4</math> has the five partitions <math>1+1+1+1</math>, <math>1+1+2</math>, <math>1+3</math>, <math>2+2</math>, and <math>4</math>.\n\nNo [[closed-form expression]] for the partition function is known, but it has both [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic expansions]] that accurately approximate it and [[recurrence relation]]s by which it can be calculated exactly. It grows as an [[exponential function]] of the [[square root]] of its argument. The [[multiplicative inverse]] of its [[generating function]] is the [[Euler function]]; by Euler's [[pentagonal number theorem]] this function is an alternating sum of [[pentagonal number]] powers of its argument.\n\n[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] first discovered that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in [[modular arithmetic]], now known as [[Ramanujan's congruences]]. For instance, whenever the decimal representation of <math>n</math> ends in the digit 4 or 9, the number of partitions of <math>n</math> will be divisible by 5. \n\n==Definition and examples==\nFor a positive integer <math>n</math>, <math>p(n)</math> is the number of distinct  ways of representing <math>n</math> as a [[summation|sum]] of positive integers. For the purposes of this definition, the order of the terms in the sum is irrelevant: two sums with the same terms in a different order are not considered to be distinct.\n\nBy convention <math>p(0)=1</math>, as there is one way (the [[empty sum]]) of representing zero as a sum of positive integers. For the same reason, by definition, <math>p(n)=0</math> when <math>n</math> is negative.\n\nThe first few values of the partition function, starting with <math>p(0)=1</math>, are:\n:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, 30, 42, 56, 77, 101, 135, 176, 231, 297, 385, 490, 627, 792, 1002, 1255, 1575, 1958, 2436, 3010, 3718, 4565, 5604, … {{OEIS|id=A000041}}.\n\nSome exact value of <math>p(n)</math> for larger values of <math>n</math> include:{{r|oeis}}\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\np(100) &= 190,569,292\\\\\np(1000) &= 24,061,467,864,032,622,473,692,149,727,991 \\approx 2.40615\\times 10^{31}\\\\\np(10000) &= 36,167,251,325,\\dots,906,916,435,144 \\approx 3.61673\\times 10^{106}\\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n{{As of|2017|September}}, the largest known [[prime number]] among the values of <math>p(n)</math> is <math>p(221444161)</math>, with <math>16,569</math> decimal digits.{{r|caldwell}}\n\n== Generating function==\n{{main|Pentagonal number theorem}}\nThe [[generating function]] for ''p''(''n'') is given by{{r|as}}\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p(n)x^n &= \\prod_{k=1}^\\infty \\left(\\frac {1}{1-x^k} \\right)\\\\\n&=(1+x+x^2+x^3+\\cdots)(1+x^2+x^4+x^6+\\cdots)(1+x^3+x^6+x^9+\\cdots)\\cdots\\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{1 - x - x^2 + x^5 + x^7 - x^{12} - x^{15} + x^{22} + x^{26} - \\cdots}\\\\\n&=1\\Big/ \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} (-1)^k x^{k(3k-1)/2}.\\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThe equality between the products on the first and second lines of this formula\nis obtained by expanding each factor <math>1/(1-x^k)</math> into the [[geometric series]] <math>(1+x^k+x^{2k}+x^{3k}+\\cdots).</math>\nTo see that the expanded product equals the sum on the first line,\napply the [[distributive law]] to the product. This expands the product into a sum of [[monomial]]s of the form <math>x^{a_1}x^{2a_2}x^{3a_3}</math> for some sequence of coefficients\n<math>a_i</math>, only finitely many of which can be non-zero.\nThe exponent of the term is <math>n=\\sum i a_i</math>, and this sum can be interpreted\nas a representation of <math>n</math> as a partition into <math>a_i</math> copies of each number <math>i</math>. Therefore, the number of terms of the product that\nthat have exponent <math>n</math> is exactly <math>p(n)</math>, the same\nas the coefficient of <math>x^n</math> in the sum on the left.\nTherefore, the sum equals the product.\n\nThe function that appears in the denominator in the third and fourth lines of the formula is the [[Euler function]]. The equality between the product on the first line and the formulas in the third and fourth lines is Euler's [[pentagonal number theorem]].\nThe exponents of <math>x</math> in these lines are the [[pentagonal number]]s <math>P_k=k(3k-1)/2</math> for <math>k\\in\\{ 0, 1,-1,2,-2,\\dots\\}</math> (generalized somewhat from the usual pentagonal numbers, which come from the same formula for the positive values of <math>k</math>). The pattern of positive and negative signs in the third line comes from the term <math>(-1)^k</math> in the fourth line: even choices of <math>k</math> produce positive terms, and odd choices produce negative terms.\n\nMore generally, the generating function for the partitions of <math>n</math> into numbers selected from a set <math>A</math> of positive integers can be found by taking only those terms in the first product for which <math>k\\in A</math>. This result is due to [[Leonhard Euler]].{{r|e}} The formulation of Euler's generating function is a special case of a [[q-Pochhammer symbol|<math>q</math>-Pochhammer symbol]] and is similar to the product formulation of many [[modular form]]s, and specifically the [[Dedekind eta function]].\n\n==Recurrence relations==\nThe same sequence of pentagonal numbers appears in a [[recurrence relation]] for the partition function:{{r|ew}}\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\np(n) &= \\sum_{k\\ne 0} (-1)^{k+1} p(n-k(3k-1)/2) \\\\\n&= p(n-1) + p(n-2)-p(n-5)-p(n-7)+p(n-12)+p(n-15)-p(n-22)-\\cdots \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nAs base cases, <math>p(0)</math> is taken to equal <math>1</math>, and <math>p(k)</math> is taken to be zero for negative&nbsp;<math>k</math>. Although the sum on the right side appears infinite, it has only finitely many nonzero terms,\ncoming from the nonzero values of <math>k</math> in the range\n:<math>-\\frac{\\sqrt{24n+1}-1}{6} \\leq k \\leq \\frac{\\sqrt{24n+1}+1}{6}</math>.\n\nAnother recurrence relation for <math>p(n)</math> can be given in terms of the [[divisor function|sum of divisors function]] {{math|''σ''}}:{{r|wilf}}\n:<math>\np(n)  = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\sigma(n-k) p(k).\n</math>\nIf <math>q(n)</math> denotes the number of partitions of <math>n</math> with no repeated parts then it follows by splitting each partition into its even parts and odd parts, and dividing the even parts by two, that{{r|aa}}\n:<math>p(n) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\left\\lfloor n/2 \\right\\rfloor} q(n-2k) p(k). \n</math>\n\n== Congruences ==\n{{Main|Ramanujan's congruences}}\n[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] is credited with discovering that the partition function has nontrivial patterns in [[modular arithmetic]].\nFor instance the number of partitions is divisible by five for whenever the decimal representation of <math>n</math> ends in the digit 4 or 9, as expressed by the congruence{{r|hw}}\n:<math>p(5k+4)\\equiv 0 \\pmod 5</math>\nFor instance, the number of partitions for the integer 4 is 5. \nFor the integer 9, the number of partitions is 30; for 14 there are 135 partitions. This congruence is implied by the more general identity\n:<math>  \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty p(5k+4)x^k = 5~ \\frac{ (x^5)^5_\\infty } {(x)^6_\\infty},</math>\nalso by Ramanujan,{{r|bo|ono}} where the notation <math>(x)_\\infty</math> denotes the product defined by\n:<math>(x)_\\infty = \\prod_{m=1}^\\infty(1-x^m).</math>\n[[generating function#Congruences for the partition function|A short proof of this result]] can be obtained from the partition function generating function.\n\nRamanujan also discovered congruences modulo 7 and 11:{{r|hw}}\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n p(7k + 5) &\\equiv 0 \\pmod 7,\\\\\n p(11k + 6) &\\equiv 0 \\pmod {11}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nThey come from Ramanujan's identity{{r|ono}}\n:<math>\n  \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty p(7k+5)x^k =\n   7~ \\frac{ (x^7)^3_\\infty} {(x)^4_\\infty}\n   +49x ~ \\frac{ (x^7)^7_\\infty } {(x)^8_\\infty}.\n</math>\n\nSince 5, 7, and 11 are consecutive [[prime number|primes]], one might think that there would be an analogous congruence for the next prime 13, <math>p(13k + a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{13}</math> for some ''a''. However, there is no congruence of the form <math>p(bk + a) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{b}</math> for any prime ''b'' other than 5, 7, or 11.{{r|ab}} Instead, to obtain a congruence, the argument of <math>p</math> should take the form <math>cbk+a</math> for some <math>c>1</math>. In the 1960s, [[A. O. L. Atkin]] of the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] discovered additional congruences of this form for small prime moduli. For example:\n:<math>p(11^3 \\cdot 13 \\cdot k + 237)\\equiv 0 \\pmod {13}.</math>\n\n{{harvs|first=Ken|last=Ono|authorlink=Ken Ono|year=2000|txt}} proved that there are such congruences for every prime modulus greater than 3. Later, {{harvtxt|Ahlgren|Ono|2001}} showed there are partition congruences modulo every integer [[coprime integers|coprime]] to&nbsp;6.{{r|o2k|ao}}\n\n==Approximation formulas==\n\nApproximation formulas exist that are faster to calculate than the exact formula given above.\n\nAn [[asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] expression for ''p''(''n'') is given by\n:<math>p(n) \\sim \\frac {1} {4n\\sqrt3} \\exp\\left({\\pi \\sqrt {\\frac{2n}{3}}}\\right)</math> as <math>n\\rightarrow \\infty</math>.\nThis [[asymptotic formula]] was first obtained by [[G. H. Hardy]] and [[Ramanujan]] in 1918 and independently by [[J. V. Uspensky]] in 1920. Considering <math>p(1000)</math>, the asymptotic formula gives about <math>2.4402\\times 10^{31}</math>, reasonably close to the exact answer given above (1.415% larger than the true value).\n\nHardy and Ramanujan obtained an [[asymptotic expansion]] with this approximation as the first term:{{r|hr}}\n:<math>p(n) \\sim \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{k=1}^v  A_k(n)\\sqrt{k} \\cdot\n\\frac{d}{dn} \\left({\\frac {1} {\\sqrt{n-\\frac{1}{24}}} \\exp \\left[ {\\frac{\\pi}{k}\n    \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\left(n-\\frac{1}{24}\\right)}}\\,\\,\\,\\right]}\\right) ,\n</math>\nwhere\n:<math>A_k(n) = \\sum_{0 \\le m < k, \\; (m, k) = 1}\ne^{ \\pi i \\left( s(m, k) - 2 nm/k \\right) }.</math>\nHere, the notation <math>(m,k)=1</math> implies that the sum should occur only over the values of <math>m</math> that are [[relatively prime]] to <math>k</math>. The function <math>s(m,k)</math> is a [[Dedekind sum]].\n\nThe error after <math>v</math> terms is of the order of the next term, and <math>v</math> may be taken to be of the order of <math>\\sqrt n</math>.  As an example, Hardy and Ramanujan showed that <math>p(200)</math> is the nearest integer to the sum of the first <math>v=5</math> terms of the series.{{r|hr}}\n\nIn 1937, [[Hans Rademacher]] was able to improve on Hardy and Ramanujan's results by providing a [[convergent series]] expression for <math>p(n)</math>. It is{{r|andrews|rad}}\n:<math>p(n)=\\frac{1}{\\pi \\sqrt{2}} \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty A_k(n)\\sqrt{k} \\cdot\n\\frac{d}{dn} \\left({\n    \\frac {1} {\\sqrt{n-\\frac{1}{24}}}\n    \\sinh \\left[ {\\frac{\\pi}{k}\n    \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}\\left(n-\\frac{1}{24}\\right)}}\\,\\,\\,\\right]\n}\\right) .\n</math>\n\nThe proof of Rademacher's formula involves [[Ford circle]]s, [[Farey sequence]]s, [[modular group|modular symmetry]] and the [[Dedekind eta function]].\n\nIt may be shown that the <math>k</math>th term of Rademacher's series is of the order\n:<math>\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{k}\\sqrt\\frac{2n}{3} \\right) , </math>\nso that the first term gives the Hardy–Ramanujan asymptotic approximation.\n{{harvs|first=Paul|last=Erdős|authorlink=Paul Erdős|year=1942|txt}} published an elementary proof of the asymptotic formula for <math>p(n)</math>.{{r|erdos42|nathanson}}\n\nTechniques for implementing the Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher formula efficiently on a computer are discussed by {{harvtxt|Johansson|2012}}, who shows that <math>p(n)</math> can be computed in time <math>O(n^{1/2+\\varepsilon})</math> for any <math>\\varepsilon>0</math>. This is near-optimal in that it matches the number of digits of the result.{{r|johansson}} The largest value of the partition function computed exactly is <math>p(10^{20})</math>, which has slightly more than 11 billion digits.{{r|fredrikj}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=aa>{{citation\n | last1 = Al | first1 = Busra\n | last2 = Alkan | first2 = Mustafa\n | contribution = A note on relations among partitions\n | pages = 35–39\n | title = Proc.

      "text": "[[File:Silver spiral approximation.png|thumb|The sides of the squares used to construct a silver spiral are the Pell numbers]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Pell numbers''' are an infinite [[sequence]] of [[integers]], known since ancient times, that comprise the [[denominator]]s of the [[closest rational approximation]]s to the [[square root of 2]]. This sequence of approximations begins {{sfrac|1|1}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|7|5}}, {{sfrac|17|12}}, and {{sfrac|41|29}}, so the sequence of Pell numbers begins with 1, 2, 5, 12, and 29. The numerators of the same sequence of approximations are half the '''companion Pell numbers''' or '''Pell–Lucas numbers'''; these numbers form a second infinite sequence that begins with 2, 6, 14, 34, and 82.\n\nBoth the Pell numbers and the companion Pell numbers may be calculated by means of a [[recurrence relation]] similar to that for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, and both sequences of numbers [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]], proportionally to powers of the [[silver ratio]] 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sqrt|2}}. As well as being used to approximate the square root of two, Pell numbers can be used to find [[square triangular number]]s, to construct integer approximations to the [[right isosceles triangle]], and to solve certain [[combinatorial enumeration]] problems.<ref>For instance, Sellers (2002) proves that the number of [[perfect matching]]s in the [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of a [[path graph]] and the graph ''K''<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;−&nbsp;''e'' can be calculated as the product of a Pell number with the corresponding Fibonacci number.</ref>\n\nAs with [[Pell's equation]], the name of the Pell numbers stems from [[Leonhard Euler|Leonhard Euler's]] mistaken attribution of the equation and the numbers derived from it to [[John Pell]]. The Pell–Lucas numbers are also named after [[Édouard Lucas]], who studied sequences defined by recurrences of this type; the Pell and companion Pell numbers are [[Lucas sequence]]s.\n\n== Pell numbers ==\n\nThe Pell numbers are defined by the [[recurrence relation]]\n:<math>P_n=\\begin{cases}0&\\mbox{if }n=0;\\\\1&\\mbox{if }n=1;\\\\2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}&\\mbox{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIn words, the sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that. The first few terms of the sequence are\n:0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860,… {{OEIS|id=A000129}}.\n\nThe Pell numbers can also be expressed by the closed form formula\n:<math>P_n=\\frac{\\left(1+\\sqrt2\\right)^n-\\left(1-\\sqrt2\\right)^n}{2\\sqrt2}.</math>\nFor large values of ''n'', the {{nowrap|(1 + {{sqrt|2}})<sup>''n''</sup>}} term dominates this expression, so the Pell numbers are approximately proportional to powers of the [[silver ratio]] {{nowrap|1 + {{sqrt|2}}}}, analogous to the growth rate of Fibonacci numbers as powers of the [[golden ratio]].\n\nA third definition is possible, from the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] formula\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} P_{n+1} & P_n \\\\ P_n & P_{n-1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^n.</math>\n\nMany identities can be derived or proven from these definitions; for instance an identity analogous to [[Cassini's identity]] for Fibonacci numbers,\n:<math>P_{n+1}P_{n-1}-P_n^2 = (-1)^n,</math>\nis an immediate consequence of the matrix formula (found by considering the [[determinant]]s of the matrices on the left and right sides of the matrix formula).<ref>For the matrix formula and its consequences see Ercolano (1979) and Kilic and Tasci (2005). Additional identities for the Pell numbers are listed by Horadam (1971) and Bicknell (1975).</ref>\n\n== Approximation to the square root of two ==\n\n[[Image:Pell octagons.svg|thumb|300px|Rational approximations to regular [[octagon]]s, with coordinates derived from the Pell numbers.]]\nPell numbers arise historically and most notably in the [[diophantine approximation|rational approximation]] to [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]]. If two large integers ''x'' and ''y'' form a solution to the [[Pell equation]]\n:<math>x^2-2y^2=\\pm 1,</math>\nthen their ratio ''{{sfrac|x|y}}'' provides a close approximation to {{sqrt|2}}. The sequence of approximations of this form is\n:<math>\\frac11, \\frac32, \\frac75, \\frac{17}{12}, \\frac{41}{29}, \\frac{99}{70}, \\dots</math>\nwhere the denominator of each fraction is a Pell number and the numerator is the sum of a Pell number and its predecessor in the sequence. That is, the solutions have the form\n:<math>\\frac{P_{n-1}+P_n}{P_n}.</math>\nThe approximation\n:<math>\\sqrt 2\\approx\\frac{577}{408}</math>\nof this type was known to Indian mathematicians in the third or fourth century B.C.<ref>As recorded in the [[Shulba Sutras]]; see e.g. Dutka (1986), who cites Thibaut (1875) for this information.</ref> The Greek mathematicians of the fifth century B.C. also knew of this sequence of approximations:<ref>See Knorr (1976) for the fifth century date, which matches [[Proclus]]' claim that the side and diameter numbers were discovered by the [[Pythagoreans]]. For more detailed exploration of later Greek knowledge of these numbers see Thompson (1929), Vedova (1951), Ridenhour (1986), Knorr (1998), and Filep (1999).</ref> Plato refers to the numerators as '''rational diameters'''.<ref>For instance, as several of the references from the previous note observe, in [[Plato's Republic]] there is a reference to the \"rational diameter of 5\", by which [[Plato]] means 7, the numerator of the approximation {{sfrac|7|5}} of which 5 is the denominator.</ref> In the 2nd century CE [[Theon of Smyrna]] used the term the  '''side and diameter numbers''' to describe the denominators and numerators of this sequence.<ref>{{citation|title=History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid|first=Sir Thomas Little|last=Heath|authorlink=Thomas Little Heath|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1921|isbn=9780486240732|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&pg=PA112}}.</ref>\n\nThese approximations can be derived from the [[continued fraction]] expansion of <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt 2</math>:\n:<math>\\sqrt 2 = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\ddots\\,}}}}}.</math>\nTruncating this expansion to any number of terms produces one of the Pell-number-based approximations in this sequence; for instance,\n:<math>\\frac{577}{408} = 1 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{2}}}}}}}.</math>\n\nAs Knuth (1994) describes, the fact that Pell numbers approximate {{sqrt|2}} allows them to be used for accurate rational approximations to a regular [[octagon]] with vertex coordinates {{nowrap|(±''P<sub>i</sub>'', ±''P''<sub>''i''+1</sub>)}} and {{nowrap|(±''P''<sub>''i''+1</sub>, ±''P<sub>i</sub>'')}}. All vertices are equally distant from the origin, and form nearly uniform angles around the origin. Alternatively, the points  <math>(\\pm(P_i+P_{i-1}),0)</math>, <math>(0,\\pm(P_i+P_{i-1}))</math>, and <math>(\\pm P_i,\\pm P_i)</math> form approximate octagons in which the vertices are nearly equally distant from the origin and form uniform angles.\n\n== Primes and squares ==\n\nA '''Pell prime''' is a Pell number that is [[prime number|prime]]. The first few Pell primes are\n:2, 5, 29, 5741, 33461, 44560482149, 1746860020068409, 68480406462161287469, ... {{OEIS|id=A086383}}.\nThe indices of these primes within the sequence of all Pell numbers are\n:2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 29, 41, 53, 59, 89, 97, 101, 167, 181, 191, 523, 929, 1217, 1301, 1361, 2087, 2273, 2393, 8093, ... {{OEIS|id=A096650}}\nThese indices are all themselves prime. As with the Fibonacci numbers, a Pell number ''P''<sub>''n''</sub> can only be prime if ''n'' itself is prime, because if ''d'' is a divisor of ''n'' then ''P''<sub>''d''</sub> is a divisor of ''P''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThe only Pell numbers that are squares, cubes, or any higher power of an integer are 0, 1, and 169 = 13<sup>2</sup>.<ref>Pethő (1992); Cohn (1996). Although the [[Fibonacci number]]s are defined by a very similar recurrence to the Pell numbers, Cohn writes that an analogous result for the Fibonacci numbers seems much more difficult to prove. (However, this was proven in 2006 by Bugeaud et al.)</ref>\n\nHowever, despite having so few squares or other powers, Pell numbers have a close connection to [[square triangular number]]s.<ref>Sesskin (1962). See the [[square triangular number]] article for a more detailed derivation.</ref> Specifically, these numbers arise from the following identity of Pell numbers:\n:<math>\\bigl(\\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\\right)\\cdot P_k\\bigr)^2 = \\frac{\\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\\right)^2\\cdot\\left(\\left(P_{k-1}+P_k\\right)^2-(-1)^k\\right)}{2}.</math>\nThe left side of this identity describes a [[square number]], while the right side describes a [[triangular number]], so the result is a square triangular number.\n\nSantana and Diaz-Barrero (2006) proved another identity relating Pell numbers to squares and showing that the sum of the Pell numbers up to ''P''<sub>4''n''+1</sub> is always a square:\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{4n+1} P_i = \\left(\\sum_{r=0}^n 2^r{2n+1\\choose 2r}\\right)^2 = \\left(P_{2n}+P_{2n+1}\\right)^2.</math>\nFor instance, the sum of the Pell numbers up to ''P''<sub>5</sub>, {{nowrap|1=0 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 12 + 29 = 49}}, is the square of {{nowrap|1=''P''<sub>2</sub> + ''P''<sub>3</sub> = 2 + 5 = 7}}. The numbers {{nowrap|''P''<sub>2''n''</sub> + ''P''<sub>2''n''+1</sub>}} forming the square roots of these sums,\n:1, 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, 47321,… {{OEIS|id=A002315}},\nare known as the [[Newman–Shanks–Williams number|Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers]].\n\n== Pythagorean triples ==\n[[Image:Pell right triangles.svg|thumb|300px|Integer right triangles with nearly equal legs, derived from the Pell numbers.]]\nIf a [[right triangle]] has integer side lengths ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' (necessarily satisfying the [[Pythagorean theorem]] {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''c''<sup>2</sup>}}), then (''a'',''b'',''c'') is known as a [[Pythagorean triple]]. As Martin (1875) describes, the Pell numbers can be used to form Pythagorean triples in which ''a'' and ''b'' are one unit apart, corresponding to right triangles that are nearly isosceles. Each such triple has the form\n:<math>\\left(2P_{n}P_{n+1}, P_{n+1}^2 - P_{n}^2, P_{n+1}^2 + P_{n}^2=P_{2n+1}\\right).</math>\nThe sequence of Pythagorean triples formed in this way is\n:(4,3,5), (20,21,29), (120,119,169), (696,697,985),…\n\n== Pell–Lucas numbers ==\n\nThe '''companion Pell numbers''' or '''Pell–Lucas numbers''' are defined by the [[recurrence relation]]\n:<math>Q_n=\\begin{cases}2&\\mbox{if }n=0;\\\\2&\\mbox{if }n=1;\\\\2Q_{n-1}+Q_{n-2}&\\mbox{otherwise.}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIn words: the first two numbers in the sequence are both 2, and each successive number is formed by adding twice the previous Pell–Lucas number to the Pell–Lucas number before that, or equivalently, by adding the next Pell number to the previous Pell number: thus, 82 is the companion to 29, and {{nowrap|1=82 = 2 × 34 + 14 = 70 + 12.}} The first few terms of the sequence are {{OEIS|id=A002203}}: [[2 (number)|2]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[14 (number)|14]], [[34 (number)|34]], [[82 (number)|82]], [[198 (number)|198]], [[478 (number)|478]],…\n\nLike the relationship between [[Fibonacci number]]s and [[Lucas number]]s,\n:<math>Q_n=\\frac{P_{2n}}{P_n}</math>\nfor all natural numbers ''n''.\n\nThe companion Pell numbers can be expressed by the closed form formula\n:<math>Q_n=\\left(1+\\sqrt 2\\right)^n+\\left(1-\\sqrt 2\\right)^n.</math>\n\nThese numbers are all even; each such number is twice the numerator in one of the rational approximations to <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt 2</math> discussed above.\n\nLike the Lucas sequence, if a Pell–Lucas number {{sfrac|1|2}}''Q<sub>n</sub>'' is prime, it is necessary that n be either prime or a power of 2.

For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3 (excluding itself), and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.\n\nThe sum of divisors of a number, excluding the number itself, is called its [[aliquot sum]], so a perfect number is one that is equal to its aliquot sum. Equivalently, a perfect number is a number that is half the sum of all of its positive divisors including itself i.e. [[divisor function|''σ''<sub>1</sub>]](''n'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;2''n''. For instance, 28 is perfect as 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 56 = 2 × 28.\n\nThis definition is ancient, appearing as early as [[Euclid's Elements]] (VII.22) where it is called {{lang|grc|τέλειος ἀριθμός}} (''perfect'', ''ideal'', or ''complete number''). [[Euclid]] also proved a formation rule (IX.36) whereby <math>q(q+1)/2</math> is an even perfect number whenever <math>q</math> is a prime of the form <math>2^p -1</math> for prime <math>p</math>—what is now called a [[Mersenne prime]]. Two millennia later, [[Euler]] proved that all even perfect numbers are of this form.<ref name=\"The Euclid–Euler theorem\">Caldwell, Chris, [https://primes.utm.edu/notes/proofs/EvenPerfect.html \"A proof that all even perfect numbers are a power of two times a Mersenne prime\"].</ref> This is known as the [[Euclid–Euler theorem]].\n\nIt is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers, nor whether infinitely many perfect numbers exist. The first few perfect numbers are [[6 (number)|6]], [[28 (number)|28]], [[496 (number)|496]] and [[8128 (number)|8128]] {{OEIS|id=A000396}}.\n\n==History==\n\nIn about 300&nbsp;BC Euclid showed that if 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is prime then 2<sup>''p''−1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1) is perfect.\nThe first four perfect numbers were the only ones known to early [[Greek mathematics]], and the mathematician [[Nicomachus]] had noted 8128 as early as 100&nbsp;AD.<ref name=\"Dickinson LE (1919)\">{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=L.

For 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 to be prime, it is necessary that ''p'' itself be prime. However, not all numbers of the form 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 with a prime ''p'' are prime; for example, 2<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 = 2047 = 23 × 89 is not a prime number.<ref>All factors of 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 are congruent to 1 mod 2''p''. For example, 2<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 = 2047 = 23 × 89, and both 23 and 89 yield a remainder of 1 when divided by 11. Furthermore, whenever ''p'' is a [[Sophie Germain prime]]—that is, 2''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is also prime—and 2''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is congruent to 1 or 7 mod 8, then 2''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 will be a factor of 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, which is the case for ''p'' = 11, 23, 83, 131, 179, 191, 239, 251,&nbsp;... {{oeis|id=A002515}}.</ref> In fact, Mersenne primes are very rare—of the 2,610,944 prime numbers ''p'' up to 43,112,609,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Number+of+primes+%3C%3D+43112609 |title=Number of primes <= 43112609 |publisher=[[Wolfram Alpha]] |accessdate=2018-10-28}}</ref> \n2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is prime for only 47 of them.\n\n[[Nicomachus]] (60–120 AD) conjectured that every perfect number is of the form 2<sup>''p''−1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1) where 2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is prime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Perfect_numbers.html|title=Perfect numbers|author=|date=|website=www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk|accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) circa 1000 AD conjectured that every ''even'' perfect number is of that form.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Al-Haytham|title=Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham}}</ref> It was not until the 18th century that [[Leonhard Euler]] proved that the formula 2<sup>''p''−1</sup>(2<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;1) will yield all the even perfect numbers.

A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a [[practical number]].\n\nBy definition, a perfect number is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the [[restricted divisor function]] {{nowrap|1=''s''(''n'') = ''σ''(''n'') − ''n''}}, and the [[aliquot sequence]] associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence.  All perfect numbers are also <math>\\mathcal{S}</math>-perfect numbers, or [[Granville number]]s.\n\nA [[semiperfect number]] is a natural number that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors.  A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number.  Most abundant numbers are also semiperfect; abundant numbers which are not semiperfect are called [[weird number]]s.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Leinster group]]\n* [[List of perfect numbers]]\n* [[Multiply perfect number]]\n* [[Superperfect number]]s\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Euclid, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', Book IX, Proposition 36.

      "text": "[[File:Perfect power number Cuisenaire rods 9.png|thumb|Demonstration, with [[Cuisenaire rod]]s, of the perfect power nature of 4, 8, and 9]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''perfect power''' is a positive [[integer]] that can be resolved into equal factors, and whose root can be exactly extracted. i.e., a positive [[integer]] that can be expressed as an integer [[Exponentiation|power]] of another positive integer. More formally, ''n'' is a perfect power if there exist [[natural number]]s ''m'' > 1, and ''k'' > 1 such that ''m<sup>k</sup>'' = ''n''. In this case, ''n'' may be called a '''perfect ''k''th power'''. If ''k'' = 2 or ''k'' = 3, then ''n'' is called a [[Square number|perfect square]] or [[perfect cube]], respectively. Sometimes 0 and 1 are also considered perfect powers (0<sup>''k''</sup> = 0 for any ''k'' > 0, 1<sup>''k''</sup> = 1 for any ''k'').\n\n== Examples and sums ==\nA [[sequence]] of perfect powers can be generated by iterating through the possible values for ''m'' and ''k''. The first few ascending perfect powers in numerical order (showing duplicate powers) are {{OEIS|id=A072103}}: \n:<math> 2^2 = 4,\\ 2^3 = 8,\\ 3^2 = 9,\\ 2^4 = 16,\\ 4^2 = 16,\\ 5^2 = 25,\\ 3^3 = 27,</math> <math> 2^5 = 32,\\ 6^2 = 36,\\ 7^2 = 49,\\ 2^6 = 64,\\ 4^3 = 64,\\ 8^2 = 64, \\dots </math>\n\nThe [[Series (mathematics)|sum]] of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocals]] of the perfect powers (including duplicates such as 3<sup>4</sup> and 9<sup>2</sup>, both of which equal 81) is 1:\n:<math>\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{m^k}=1.</math>\n\nwhich can be proved as follows:\n:<math>\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{m^k}\n=\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\frac {1}{m^2} \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{m^k}\n=\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\frac {1}{m^2} \\left( \\frac{m}{m-1} \\right)\n=\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\frac {1}{m(m-1)}\n=\\sum_{m=2}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac {1}{m-1} - \\frac {1}{m} \\right) = 1 \\, .</math>\n\nThe first perfect powers without duplicates are:\n:(sometimes 0 and 1), 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 256, 289, 324, 343, 361, 400, 441, 484, 512, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961, 1000, 1024, ... {{OEIS|id=A001597}}\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the perfect powers ''p'' without duplicates is:<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=PerfectPower|title=Perfect Power}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\sum_{p}\\frac{1}{p}=\\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty}\\mu(k)(1-\\zeta(k)) \\approx 0.874464368 \\dots</math>\n\nwhere &mu;(''k'') is the [[Möbius function]] and &zeta;(''k'') is the [[Riemann zeta function]].\n\nAccording to [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], [[Christian Goldbach|Goldbach]] showed (in a now-lost letter) that the sum of {{sfrac|''p'' − 1}} over the set of perfect powers ''p'', excluding 1 and excluding duplicates, is 1:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{p}\\frac{1}{p-1}= {\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{24} + \\frac{1}{26}+ \\frac{1}{31}}+ \\cdots = 1.</math>\n\nThis is sometimes known as the [[Goldbach–Euler theorem]].\n\n==Detecting perfect powers==\nDetecting whether or not a given natural number ''n'' is a perfect power may be accomplished in many different ways, with varying levels of [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]]. One of the simplest such methods is to consider all possible values for ''k'' across each of the [[divisor]]s of ''n'', up to <math>k \\leq \\log_2 n</math>. So if the divisors of <math>n</math> are <math>n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_j</math> then one of the values <math>n_1^2, n_2^2, \\dots, n_j^2, n_1^3, n_2^3, \\dots</math> must be equal to ''n'' if ''n'' is indeed a perfect power.\n\nThis method can immediately be simplified by instead considering only [[Prime number|prime]] values of ''k''. This is because if <math>n = m^k</math> for a [[composite number|composite]] <math>k = ap</math> where ''p'' is prime, then this can simply be rewritten as <math>n = m^k = m^{ap} = (m^a)^p</math>. Because of this result, the [[Minimal element|minimal]] value of ''k'' must necessarily be prime.\n\nIf the full factorization of ''n'' is known, say <math>n = p_1^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2} \\cdots p_r^{\\alpha_r}</math> where the <math>p_i</math> are distinct primes, then ''n'' is a perfect power [[if and only if]] <math>\\gcd(\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\ldots, \\alpha_r) > 1</math> where gcd denotes the [[greatest common divisor]]. As an example, consider ''n'' = 2<sup>96</sup>·3<sup>60</sup>·7<sup>24</sup>. Since gcd(96, 60, 24) = 12, ''n'' is a perfect 12th power (and a perfect 6th power, 4th power, cube and square, since 6, 4, 3 and 2 divide 12).\n\n==Gaps between perfect powers==\nIn 2002 Romanian mathematician [[Preda Mihăilescu]] proved that the only pair of consecutive perfect powers is 2<sup>3</sup> = 8 and 3<sup>2</sup> = 9, thus proving [[Catalan's conjecture]].\n\nPillai's conjecture states that for any given positive integer ''k'' there are only a finite number of pairs of perfect powers whose difference is ''k''. This is an unsolved problem.<ref>{{MathWorld|urlname=PillaisConjecture|title=Pillai's Conjecture}}</ref>\n\n==Calculation by recursion for positive integers==\n{{Unsourced section|date=April 2015}}\nAs an alternate way to calculate perfect powers, the recursive approach has yet to be found useful. It is based on the observation that the difference between {{mvar|a<sup>b</sup>}} and (''a''+1)<sup>''b''</sup> where {{tmath|a > b}} may not be constant, but if you take the difference of successive differences, ''b'' times, there is a constant ''b!'' factor. For example, 9<sup>4</sup> = 6561, and 10<sup>4</sup> is 10000. the difference is 3439. The difference between 8<sup>4</sup> and 9<sup>4</sup> is 2465, meaning the difference of differences is 974. A step further and you have 204. One step further, and you have 24, which is equal to 4!. One step further and collating this 'key' row from progressively larger exponents yields a triangle similar to Pascal's, but with a differing formula for generation. A part of this table is shown below:\n\nDefine the following function on the range of positive integers:\n:<math>K(a,b) = 1</math> where ''a'' = 1 or ''a'' = ''b''\n:<math>K(a,b) = 0</math> where ''b'' > ''a''\n:<math>K(a,b) = bK(a-b,b) + (a-b+1)K(a-b+1,b-1)</math> elsewhere\n\nThis function generates the following output:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''a''|''b''}} || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6\n|-\n! 1 \n| 1 || 0|| 0|| 0|| 0|| 0\n|-\n! 2 \n| 1|| 1|| 0|| 0|| 0|| 0\n|-\n! 3 \n| 1|| 4|| 1|| 0|| 0|| 0\n|-\n! 4 \n| 1|| 11|| 11|| 1|| 0|| 0\n|-\n! 5 \n| 1|| 26|| 66|| 26|| 1|| 0\n|-\n! 6 \n| 1|| 57|| 302|| 302|| 57|| 1\n|}\n\nAlso define the following function on the range of positive integers:\n(This is very closely related to the Binomial Theorem and Pascal's Triangle)\n:<math>P(a,b) = 1</math> where ''a'' = 1 or ''b'' = 1\n:<math>P(a,b) = P(a-1, b) + P(a, b-1)</math> elsewhere\n\nThe table this generates can be seen as pascal's triangle fallen over to the left, so that what were rows on Pascal's triangle have become diagonal series in the table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''a''|''b''}} || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! 1\n| 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 1\n|-\n! 2\n| 1 || 2|| 3|| 4|| 5|| 6|| 7|| 8\n|-\n! 3\n| 1 || 3|| 6|| 10 || 15 || 21|| 28|| 36\n|-\n! 4\n| 1 || 4|| 10 || 20|| 35|| 56|| 84|| 120\n|-\n! 5\n| 1 || 5|| 15|| 35|| 70|| 126 || 210|| 330\n|-\n! 6\n| 1 || 6|| 21|| 56|| 126|| 252|| 462|| 792\n|-\n! 7\n| 1 || 7|| 28|| 84|| 210|| 462|| 924|| 1716\n|-\n! 8\n| 1 || 8|| 36|| 120|| 330|| 792|| 1716|| 3432\n|}\n\nIt can then be stated that:\n:<math>a^b = \\sum_{x=1}^b \\,\\! P ( a - x + 1 , b + 1 ) K ( b , x )</math>\n\nExample: \n:<math>7^3 = \\sum_{x=1}^b P(8 - x, 4)K(3,x) = P(7, 4)K(3,1) + P(6,4)K(3,2) + P(5,4)K(3,3)</math>\nExpanding P(7,4)\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP(7,4) &= P(7,3) + P(6,4) = P(7,2) + 2P(6,3) + P(5,4) \\\\\n&= P(7,1) + 3P(6,2) + 3P(5,3) + P(4,4) \\\\\n&= 1 + 3P(6,1) + 6P(5,2) + 4P(4,3) + P(3,4) \\\\\n&= 4 + 6P(5,1) + 10P(4,2) + 5P(3,3) + P(2,4) \\\\\n&= 10 + 10P(4,1) + 15P(3,2) + 6P(2,3) + P(1,4) \\\\\n&= 21 + 15P(3,1) + 21P(2,2) + 6P(1,3) \\\\\n&= 42 + 21P(2,1) + 21P(1,2) = 84\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOr you can look up the values on the table and get P(6,4) = 56, and P(5,4) = 35.\n\nBy definition, K(3,1) = 1.

The values of ''k'' leading to perfect totient numbers in this way are\n:0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, 15, 39, 201, 249, 1005, 1254, 1635, ... {{OEIS|id=A005537}}.\n\nMore generally if ''p'' is a [[prime number]] greater than 3, and 3''p'' is a perfect totient number, then ''p'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) (Mohan and Suryanarayana 1982). Not all ''p'' of this form lead to perfect totient numbers; for instance, 51 is not a perfect totient number. Iannucci et al.

For large ''n'' the formula reduces to\n\n:<math>P\\left(n\\right) \\approx {p^n} </math>\n\nThis formula can be used to quickly calculate values of the Perrin sequence for large n. The ratio of successive terms in the Perrin sequence approaches ''p'', a.k.a. the [[plastic number]], which has a value of approximately 1.324718. This constant bears the same relationship to the Perrin sequence as the [[golden ratio]] does to the [[Lucas number|Lucas sequence]]. Similar connections exist also between ''p'' and the [[Padovan sequence]], between the [[golden ratio]] and Fibonacci numbers, and between the [[silver ratio]] and [[Pell number]]s.\n\n===Multiplication formula===\n\nFrom the Binet formula, we can obtain a formula for ''G''(''kn'') in terms of ''G''(''n''−1), ''G''(''n'') and ''G''(''n''+1); we know\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\nG(n-1) & = &p^{-1}p^n + &q^{-1}q^n +& r^{-1} r^n\\\\\nG(n) & =& p^n+&q^n+&r^n\\\\\nG(n+1) &=& pp^n +& qq^n +& rr^n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nwhich gives us three linear equations with coefficients over the [[splitting field]] of <math> x^3 -x -1 </math>; by inverting a matrix we can solve for <math>p^n, q^n, r^n</math> and then we can raise them to the ''k''th power and compute the sum.\n\nExample [[Magma computer algebra system|magma]] code:\n\n P&lt;x&gt; := PolynomialRing(Rationals());\n S&lt;t&gt; := SplittingField(x^3-x-1);\n P2&lt;y&gt; := PolynomialRing(S);\n p,q,r := Explode(&#91;r&#91;1&#93; : r in Roots(y^3-y-1)&#93;);\n Mi:=Matrix(&#91;&#91;1/p,1/q,1/r&#93;,&#91;1,1,1&#93;,&#91;p,q,r&#93;&#93;)^(-1);\n T&lt;u,v,w&gt; := PolynomialRing(S,3);\n v1 := ChangeRing(Mi,T) *Matrix(&#91;&#91;u&#93;,&#91;v&#93;,&#91;w&#93;&#93;);\n &#91;p^i*v1&#91;1,1&#93;^3 + q^i*v1&#91;2,1&#93;^3 + r^i*v1&#91;3,1&#93;^3 : i in &#91;-1..1&#93;&#93;;\n\nwith the result that, if we have <math>u = G(n-1), v = G(n), w = G(n+1)</math>, then\n:<math>\n\n\\begin{matrix}\n23G(2n-1) &=& 4u^2 + 3v^2 + 9w^2 + 18uv - 12uw - 4vw \\\\\n23G(2n) &=& - 6u^2 + 7v^2 - 2w^2 - 4uv + 18uw + 6vw\\\\\n23G(2n+1) &=& 9u^2 + v^2 + 3w^2 + 6uv - 4uw + 14vw \\\\\n23G(3n-1)& = &\\left(-4u^3 + 2v^3 -w^3 + 9(uv^2+vw^2+wu^2) + 3v^2w+6uvw\\right)\\\\\n23G(3n)& = &\\left(3u^3 + 2v^3 + 3w^3 - 3(uv^2 + uw^2 + vw^2 + vu^2) + 6v^2w + 18uvw\\right) \\\\\n23G(3n+1)& = &\\left(v^3-w^3+6uv^2+9uw^2+6vw^2+9vu^2-3wu^2+6wv^2-6uvw\\right) \\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nThe number 23 here arises from the discriminant of the defining polynomial of the sequence.\n\nThis allows computation of the nth Perrin number using integer arithmetic in <math>O(\\log n)</math> multiplies.\n\n==Primes and divisibility==\n\n===Perrin pseudoprimes===\n\nIt has been proven that for all primes ''p'', ''p'' divides ''P''(''p''). However, the converse is not true: for some [[composite number]]s ''n'', ''n'' may still divide ''P''(''n''). If ''n'' has this property, it is called a \"Perrin [[pseudoprime]]\".\n\nThe first few Perrin pseudoprimes are\n:271441, 904631, 16532714, 24658561, 27422714, 27664033, 46672291, 102690901, 130944133, 196075949, 214038533, 517697641, 545670533, 801123451, 855073301, 903136901, 970355431, ... {{OEIS|id=A013998}}\n\nThe question of the existence of Perrin pseudoprimes was considered by Perrin himself, but it was not known whether they existed until Adams and Shanks (1982) discovered the smallest one, 271441 = 521<sup>2</sup>; the next-smallest is 904631 = 7 x 13 x 9941. There are seventeen of them less than a billion;<ref>{{OEIS|id=A013998}}</ref> Jon Grantham has proved<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Jon Grantham]] |title=There are infinitely many Perrin pseudoprimes |journal=[[Journal of Number Theory]] |year=2010 |volume=130 |issue=5 |pages=1117–1128 |doi=10.1016/j.jnt.2009.11.008 |url=http://www.pseudoprime.com/pseudo3.pdf}}</ref> that there are infinitely many Perrin pseudoprimes.\n\nAdams and Shanks (1982) noted that primes also meet the condition that ''P''(''-p'') = ''-1'' mod ''p''. Composites where both properties hold are called \"restricted Perrin pseudoprimes\" {{OEIS|id=A018187}}. Further conditions can be applied using the six element signature of ''n'' which must be one of three forms (e.g. {{OEIS2C|A275612}} and {{OEIS2C|A275613}}).\n\nWhile Perrin pseudoprimes are rare, they have significant overlap with [[Fermat pseudoprime]]s. This contrasts with the [[Lucas pseudoprime]]s which are anti-correlated. The latter condition is exploited to yield the popular, efficient, and more effective [[Baillie–PSW_primality_test|BPSW test]] which has no known pseudoprimes, and the smallest is known to be greater than 2<sup>64</sup>.\n\n===Perrin primes===\n\nA '''Perrin prime''' is a Perrin number that is [[prime number|prime]]. The first few Perrin primes are:\n\n:2, 3, 5, 7, 17, 29, 277, 367, 853, 14197, 43721, 1442968193, 792606555396977, 187278659180417234321, 66241160488780141071579864797, ... {{OEIS|id=A074788}}\n\nFor these Perrin primes, the index {{math|''n''}} of {{math|''P''(''n'')}} is\n:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 20, 21, 24, 34, 38, 75, 122, 166, 236, 355, 356, 930, 1042, 1214, 1461, 1622, 4430, 5802, 9092, ... {{OEIS|id=A112881}}\n\nGenerating P(n) where n is a negative integer yields a similar property regarding primality: if n is a negative, then P(n) is prime when P(n) mod -n = -n - 1. The following sequence represents P(n) for all n that are negative integers:\n:-1, 1, 2, -3, 4, -2, -1, 5, -7, 6, -1, -6, 12, -13, 7, 5, -18, 25, -20, 2, 23, -43, 45, -22, -21, 66, -88, 67, -1, ... {{OEIS|id=A078712}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite journal\n | author = Füredi, Z. | authorlink = Zoltán Füredi\n | title = The number of maximal independent sets in connected graphs\n | journal = Journal of Graph Theory\n | volume = 11\n | issue = 4\n | year = 1987\n | pages = 463–470\n | doi = 10.1002/jgt.3190110403}}\n\n* {{Cite book | isbn = 0201038048 | title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]], Volume 4A: Combinatorial Algorithms, Part 1 | last1 = Knuth | first1 = Donald E. | year = 2011 | publisher = Addison-Wesley  | pages =  }}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal\n |author1=Adams, William |author2=Shanks, Daniel | title = Strong primality tests that are not sufficient\n | journal = Mathematics of Computation\n | volume = 39\n | year = 1982\n | issue = 159\n | pages = 255–300\n |mr=0658231\n | doi = 10.2307/2007637\n | jstor = 2007637\n | publisher = American Mathematical Society}}\n\n*{{cite journal\n | author = Perrin, R.\n | title = Query 1484\n | journal = [[L'Intermédiaire des Mathématiciens]]\n | volume = 6\n | pages = 76\n | year = 1899}}\n\n*{{cite journal\n | author = Lucas, E.\n | authorlink = Édouard Lucas\n | title = Théorie des fonctions numériques simplement périodiques\n | journal = American Journal of Mathematics\n | volume = 1\n | pages = 197–240\n | year = 1878\n | doi = 10.2307/2369311\n | jstor = 2369311\n | issue = 3\n | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051108035017/http://www.ai.univie.ac.at/perrin.html Zentrum für Hirnforschung Institut für Medizinische Kybernetik und Artificial Intelligence]\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath127/kmath127|title=Lucas Pseudoprimes}}\n*{{MathPages|id=home/kmath345/kmath345|title=Perrin's Sequence}}\n*{{OEIS el|1=A225876|2=Composite n which divide s(n)+1, where s is ...|formalname=Composite n which divide s(n)+1, where s is the linear recurrence sequence s(n) = -s(n-1) + s(n-2) - s(n-3) + s(n-5) with initial terms (5, -1, 3, -7, 11)}} -- Perrin-like sequence\n*[http://ntheory.org/primality/perrin.html Perrin Primality Tests]\n\n{{Prime number classes}}\n{{Classes of natural numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Recurrence relations]]"

However, finding such a representation could involve solving instances of the [[subset sum problem]], which is computationally difficult. Instead, Pillai considered the following simpler [[greedy algorithm]] for finding a representation of <math>n</math> as a sum of primes: choose the first prime in the sum to be the largest prime <math>p</math> that is at most <math>n</math>, and then recursively construct the remaining sum recursively for <math>n-p</math>.\nIf this process reaches zero, it halts. And if it reaches one instead of zero,\nit must include one in the sum (even though it is not prime), and then halt.\nFor instance, this algorithm represents 122 as 113 + 7 + 2, even though the shorter representations 61 + 61 or 109 + 13 are also possible.\n\nThe <math>n</math>th number in the Pillai sequence is the smallest number whose greedy representation as a sum of primes (and one) requires <math>n</math> terms.

For every ''x'', the politeness of ''x'' equals the number of [[odd number|odd]] [[divisor]]s of ''x'' that are greater than one.<ref name=\"Sylvester\"/> \nThe politeness of the numbers 1, 2, 3, ... is\n:0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, ... {{OEIS|id=A069283}}.\nFor instance, the politeness of 9 is 2 because it has two odd divisors, 3 and itself, and two polite representations\n:9 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 4 + 5;\nthe politeness of 15 is 3 because it has three odd divisors, 3, 5, and 15, and (as is familiar to [[cribbage]] players)<ref>{{citation|first1=Ronald|last1=Graham|author1-link=Ronald Graham|first3=Oren|last3=Patashnik|author3-link=Oren Patashnik|first2=Donald|last2=Knuth|author2-link=Donald Knuth|title=Concrete Mathematics|publisher=Addison-Wesley|page=65|contribution=Problem 2.30|isbn=978-0-201-14236-5|year=1988|title-link=Concrete Mathematics}}.</ref> three polite representations\n:15 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 7 + 8.\nAn easy way of calculating the ''politeness'' of a positive number is that of decomposing the number into its [[prime factors]], taking the powers of all prime factors greater than 2, adding 1 to all of them, multiplying the numbers thus obtained with each other and subtracting 1. For instance 90 has politeness 5 because <math>90 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1</math>; the powers of 3 and 5 are respectively 2 and 1, and applying this method <math>(2+1) \\times (1+1)-1 = 5</math>.\n\n==Construction of polite representations from odd divisors==\nTo see the connection between odd divisors and polite representations, suppose a number ''x'' has the odd divisor ''y''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1. Then ''y'' consecutive integers centered on ''x''/''y'' (so that their average value is ''x''/''y'') have ''x'' as their sum:\n:<math>x=\\sum_{i=\\frac{x}{y} - \\frac{y-1}{2}}^{\\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y-1}{2}}i.</math>\nSome of the terms in this sum may be zero or negative. However, if a term is zero it can be omitted and any negative terms may be used to cancel positive ones, leading to a polite representation for ''x''. (The requirement that ''y''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;1 corresponds to the requirement that a polite representation have more than one term; applying the same construction for ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 would just lead to the trivial one-term representation ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''.)\nFor instance, the polite number ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;14 has a single nontrivial odd divisor, 7. It is therefore the sum of 7 consecutive numbers centered at 14/7&nbsp;=&nbsp;2:\n:14 = (2 &minus; 3) + (2 &minus; 2) + (2 &minus; 1) + 2 + (2 + 1) + (2 + 2) + (2 + 3).\nThe first term, &minus;1, cancels a later +1, and the second term, zero, can be omitted, leading to the polite representation\n:14 = 2 + (2 + 1) + (2 + 2) + (2 + 3) = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.\n\nConversely, every polite representation of ''x'' can be formed from this construction. If a representation has an odd number of terms, ''x''/''y'' is the middle term, while if it has an even number of terms and its minimum value is ''m'' it may be extended in a unique way to a longer sequence with the same sum and an odd number of terms, by including the 2''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 numbers &minus;(''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1), &minus;(''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2), ..., &minus;1, 0, 1, ..., ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2, ''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1.\nAfter this extension, again, ''x''/''y'' is the middle term. By this construction, the polite representations of a number and its odd divisors greater than one may be placed into a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]], giving a [[bijective proof]] of the characterization of polite numbers and politeness.<ref name=\"Sylvester\"/><ref>{{citation|title=The inquisitive problem solver|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2002|authorlink=Paul Vaderlind|first1=Paul|last1=Vaderlind|first2=Richard K.|last2=Guy|author2-link=Richard K.

That is, the polite numbers are simply trapezoidal numbers.  One can also consider polite numbers whose only polite representations start with 1.  The only such numbers are the triangular numbers with only one nontrivial odd divisor, because for those numbers, according to the bijection described earlier, the odd divisor corresponds to the triangular representation and there can be no other polite representations. Thus, polite numbers whose only polite representation starts with 1 must have the form of a power of two multiplied by an odd prime. As Jones and Lord observe,<ref name=\"JonesLord99\"/> there are exactly two types of triangular numbers with this form:\n#the even [[perfect number]]s 2<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) formed by the product of a [[Mersenne prime]] 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 with half the nearest [[power of two]], and\n#the products 2<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) of a [[Fermat prime]] 2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 with half the nearest power of two.\n{{OEIS|id=A068195}}. For instance, the perfect number 28&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>3&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>(2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) and the number 136&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>4&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>(2<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) are both this type of polite number. It is conjectured that there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, in which case there are also infinitely many polite numbers of this type.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Planetmath reference|id=10725|title=Polite number}}\n*{{citation\n | date = December 2002\n | publisher = NRICH, University of Cambridge\n | title = Polite Numbers\n | url = http://nrich.maths.org/public/viewer.php?obj_id=2074}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030227224508/http://www.mcs.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/R.Knott/runsums/index.html An Introduction to Runsums], R.

      "text": "[[File:Powerful number Cuisenaire rods 9.png|thumb|Demonstration, with [[Cuisenaire rod]]s, of the powerful nature of 1, 4, 8, and 9]]\n\nA '''powerful number''' is a [[positive integer]] ''m'' such that for every [[prime number]] ''p'' dividing ''m'', ''p''<sup>2</sup> also divides ''m''. Equivalently, a powerful number is the product of a [[Square number|square]] and a [[Cube (arithmetic)|cube]], that is, a number ''m'' of the form ''m'' = ''a''<sup>2</sup>''b''<sup>3</sup>, where ''a'' and ''b'' are positive integers. Powerful numbers are also known as '''squareful''', '''square-full''', or '''2-full'''. [[Paul Erdős]] and [[George Szekeres]] studied such numbers and [[Solomon W. Golomb]] named such numbers ''powerful''.\n\nThe following is a list of all powerful numbers between 1 and 1000:\n:1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100, 108, 121, 125, 128, 144, 169, 196, 200, 216, 225, 243, 256, 288, 289, 324, 343, 361, 392, 400, 432, 441, 484, 500, 512, 529, 576, 625, 648, 675, 676, 729, 784, 800, 841, 864, 900, 961, 968, 972, 1000, ... {{OEIS|id=A001694}}.\n\n== Equivalence of the two definitions ==\n\nIf ''m'' = ''a''<sup>2</sup>''b''<sup>3</sup>, then every prime in the [[prime factorization]] of ''a'' appears in the prime factorization of ''m'' with an exponent of at least two, and every prime in the prime factorization of ''b'' appears in the prime factorization of ''m'' with an exponent of at least three; therefore, ''m'' is powerful.\n\nIn the other direction, suppose that ''m'' is powerful, with prime factorization\n:<math>m = \\prod p_i^{\\alpha_i},</math>\nwhere each α<sub>i</sub> ≥ 2.  Define ''γ''<sub>''i''</sub> to be three if ''α''<sub>''i''</sub> is odd, and zero otherwise, and define ''β''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''α''<sub>''i''</sub> − ''γ''<sub>''i''</sub>.  Then, all values ''β''<sub>''i''</sub> are nonnegative even integers, and all values γ<sub>i</sub> are either zero or three, so\n\n:<math>m = \\left(\\prod p_i^{\\beta_i}\\right)\\left(\\prod p_i^{\\gamma_i}\\right) = \\left(\\prod p_i^{\\beta_i/2}\\right)^2\\left(\\prod p_i^{\\gamma_i/3}\\right)^3</math>\n\nsupplies the desired representation of ''m'' as a product of a square and a cube.\n\nInformally, given the prime factorization of ''m'', take ''b'' to be the product of the prime factors of ''m'' that have an odd exponent (if there are none, then take ''b'' to be 1). Because ''m'' is powerful, each prime factor with an odd exponent has an exponent that is at least 3, so ''m''/''b''<sup>3</sup> is an integer. In addition, each prime factor of ''m''/''b''<sup>3</sup> has an even exponent, so ''m''/''b''<sup>3</sup>  is a perfect square, so call this ''a''<sup>2</sup>; then ''m'' = ''a''<sup>2</sup>''b''<sup>3</sup>. For example:\n\n:<math>m = 21600 = 2^5 \\times 3^3 \\times 5^2 \\, ,</math>\n:<math>b = 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\, ,</math>\n:<math>a = \\sqrt{\\frac{m}{b^3}} = \\sqrt{2^2 \\times 5^2} = 10 \\, ,</math>\n:<math>m = a^2b^3 = 10^2 \\times 6^3 \\, .</math>\n\nThe representation ''m'' = ''a''<sup>2</sup>''b''<sup>3</sup> calculated in this way has the property that ''b'' is [[Square-free integer|squarefree]], and is uniquely defined by this property.\n\n== Mathematical properties ==\n\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the powerful numbers converges.  The value of this sum may be written in several other ways, including as the infinite product \n\n: <math>\\prod_p\\left(1+\\frac{1}{p(p-1)}\\right)=\\frac{\\zeta(2)\\zeta(3)}{\\zeta(6)} = \\frac{315}{2\\pi^4}\\zeta(3),</math>\n\nwhere ''p'' runs over all primes, ζ(''s'') denotes the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''ζ''(3) is [[Apéry's constant]].<ref>(Golomb, 1970)</ref>\nMore generally, the sum of the reciprocals of the  ''s''th powers of the powerful numbers (a [[Dirichlet series]] generating function) is equal to\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\zeta(2s)\\zeta(3s)}{\\zeta(6s)} </math>\n\nwhenever it converges.\n\nLet ''k''(''x'') denote the number of powerful numbers in the interval [1,''x'']. Then ''k''(''x'') is proportional to the [[square root]] of ''x''. More precisely,\n\n: <math>cx^{1/2}-3x^{1/3}\\le k(x) \\le cx^{1/2}, c = \\zeta(3/2)/\\zeta(3) = 2.173 \\ldots</math>\n\n(Golomb, 1970).\n\nThe two smallest consecutive powerful numbers are 8 and 9. Since [[Pell's equation]] {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; 8''y''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has infinitely many integral solutions, there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers (Golomb, 1970); more generally, one can find consecutive powerful numbers by solving a similar Pell equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; ''ny''<sup>2</sup> = ±1}} for any [[perfect cube]] {{mvar|n}}. However, one of the two powerful numbers in a pair formed in this way must be a square. According to Guy, Erdős has asked whether there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive powerful numbers such as {{math|(23<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>3<sup>2</sup>13<sup>2</sup>)}} in which neither number in the pair is a square. {{harvtxt|Walker|1976}} showed that there are indeed infinitely many such pairs by showing that {{math|1=3<sup>3</sup>''c''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 7<sup>3</sup>''d''<sup>2</sup>}} has infinitely many solutions.\nWalker's solutions to this equation are generated, for any odd integer {{math|''k''}}, by considering the number\n\n:<math>(2\\sqrt{7}+3\\sqrt{3})^{7k}=a\\sqrt{7}+b\\sqrt{3},</math>\n\nfor integers {{math|''a''}} divisible by 7 and {{math|''b''}} divisible by 3,\nand constructing from {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} the consecutive powerful numbers {{math|7''a''<sup>2</sup>}} and {{math|3''b''<sup>2</sup>}} with {{math|1=7''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1 + 3''b''<sup>2</sup>}}.\nThe smallest consecutive pair in this family is generated for {{math|1=''k'' = 1}}, {{math|1=''a'' = 2637362}}, and {{math|1=''b'' = 4028637}} as\n\n:<math>7\\cdot 2637362^2 = 2^2\\cdot 7^3\\cdot 13^2\\cdot 43^2\\cdot 337^2=48689748233308</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>3\\cdot 4028637^2 = 3^3\\cdot 139^2\\cdot 9661^2 = 48689748233307.</math>\n\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Can three consecutive numbers be powerful?}}\nIt is a [[Erdős conjecture|conjecture]] of Erdős, Mollin, and Walsh that there are no three consecutive powerful numbers.\n\n== Sums and differences of powerful numbers ==\n[[File:difference_of_consecutive_squares.svg|thumb|Visual proof that the differences of consecutive squares are consecutive odd numbers]]\nAny odd number is a difference of two consecutive squares: (''k'' + 1)<sup>2</sup> = ''k''<sup>2</sup> + 2''k'' + 1, so (''k'' + 1)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''<sup>2</sup> = 2''k'' + 1. Similarly, any multiple of four is a difference of the squares of two numbers that differ by two: (''k'' + 2)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''<sup>2</sup> = 4''k'' + 4. However, a [[singly even number]], that is, a number divisible by two but not by four, cannot be expressed as a difference of squares. This motivates the question of determining which singly even numbers can be expressed as differences of powerful numbers. Golomb exhibited some representations of this type:\n\n:2 = 3<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;5<sup>2</sup>\n:10 = 13<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3<sup>7</sup>\n:18 = 19<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;7<sup>3</sup> = 3<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;15<sup>2</sup>.\n\nIt had been conjectured that 6 cannot be so represented, and Golomb conjectured that there are infinitely many integers which cannot be represented as a difference between two powerful numbers. However, Narkiewicz showed that 6 can be so represented in infinitely many ways such as\n\n:6 = 5<sup>4</sup>7<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;463<sup>2</sup>,\n\nand McDaniel showed that every integer has infinitely many such representations (McDaniel, 1982).\n\n[[Paul Erdős|Erdős]] conjectured that every sufficiently large integer is a sum of at most three powerful numbers; this was proved by [[Roger Heath-Brown]] (1987).\n\n== Generalization ==\n\nMore generally, we can consider the integers all of whose prime factors have exponents at least ''k''.

      "text": "[[File:Practical number Cuisenaire rods 12.png|thumb|Demonstration of the practicality of the number 12]]\n\nIn [[number theory]], a '''practical number''' or '''panarithmic number'''<ref>{{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}} cites {{harvtxt|Robinson|1979}} and {{harvtxt|Heyworth|1980}} for the name \"panarithmic numbers\".</ref> is a positive integer ''n'' such that all smaller positive integers can be represented as sums of distinct [[divisor]]s of ''n''. For example, 12 is a practical number because all the numbers from 1 to 11 can be expressed as sums of its divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6: as well as these divisors themselves, we have 5 = 3 + 2, 7 = 6 + 1, 8 = 6 + 2, 9 = 6 + 3, 10 = 6 + 3 + 1, and 11 = 6 + 3 + 2.\n\nThe sequence of practical numbers {{OEIS|A005153}} begins\n:1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 30, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, 54, 56, 60, 64, 66, 72, 78, 80, 84, 88, 90, 96, 100, 104, 108, 112, 120, 126, 128, 132, 140, 144, 150....\n\nPractical numbers were used by [[Fibonacci]] in his [[Liber Abaci]] (1202) in connection with the problem of representing rational numbers as [[Egyptian fraction]]s. Fibonacci does not formally define practical numbers, but he gives a table of Egyptian fraction expansions for fractions with practical denominators.<ref name=\"sigler\">{{harvtxt|Sigler|2002}}.</ref>\n\nThe name \"practical number\" is due to  {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}}. He noted that \"the subdivisions of money, weights, and measures involve numbers like 4, 12, 16, 20 and 28 which are usually supposed to be so inconvenient as to deserve replacement by powers of 10.\" He rediscovered the number theoretical property of such numbers and was the first to attempt a classification of these numbers that was completed by {{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}}. This characterization makes it possible to determine whether a number is practical by examining its prime factorization. Every even [[perfect number]] and every [[power of two]] is also a practical number.\n\nPractical numbers have also been shown to be analogous with [[prime number]]s in many of their properties.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hausman|Shapiro|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}}; {{harvtxt|Melfi|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Saias|1997}}.</ref>\n\n==Characterization of practical numbers==\nThe original characterisation by {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}} stated that a practical number cannot be a [[deficient number]], that is one of which the sum of all divisors (including 1 and itself) is less than twice the number unless the deficiency is one. If the ordered set of all divisors of the practical number <math>n</math> is <math>{d_1, d_2,..., d_j}</math> with <math>d_1=1</math> and <math>d_j=n</math>, then Srinivasan's statement can be expressed by the inequality\n:<math>2n\\leq1+\\sum_{i=1}^j d_i</math>.\n\nIn other words, the ordered sequence of all divisors <math>{d_1<d_2<...<d_j}</math> of a practical number has to be a [[Complete sequence|complete sub-sequence]].\n\nThis partial characterization was extended and completed by {{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}} who showed that it is straightforward to determine whether a number is practical from its [[prime factorization]].\nA positive integer greater than one with prime factorization <math>n=p_1^{\\alpha_1}...p_k^{\\alpha_k}</math> (with the primes in sorted order <math>p_1<p_2<\\dots<p_k</math>) is practical if and only if each of its prime factors <math>p_i</math> is small enough for <math>p_i-1</math> to have a representation as a sum of smaller divisors. For this to be true, the first prime <math>p_1</math> must equal 2 and, for every {{mvar|i}} from 2 to&nbsp;{{mvar|k}}, each successive prime <math>p_i</math> must obey the inequality\n:<math>p_i\\leq1+\\sigma(p_1^{\\alpha_1}p_2^{\\alpha_2}\\dots p_{i-1}^{\\alpha_{i-1}})=1+\\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\\frac{p_j^{\\alpha_j+1}-1}{p_j-1},</math>\nwhere <math>\\sigma(x)</math> denotes the [[Divisor function|sum of the divisors]] of ''x''. For example, 2 × 3<sup>2</sup> × 29 × 823 = 429606 is practical, because the inequality above holds for each of its prime factors: 3 ≤ σ(2) + 1 = 4, 29 ≤ σ(2 × 3<sup>2</sup>) + 1 = 40, and 823 ≤ σ(2 × 3<sup>2</sup> × 29) + 1 = 1171.\n\nThe condition stated above is necessary and sufficient for a number to be practical. In one direction, this condition is necessary in order to be able to represent <math>p_i-1</math> as a sum of divisors of ''n'', because if the inequality failed to be true then even adding together all the smaller divisors would give a sum too small to reach <math>p_i-1</math>. In the other direction, the condition is sufficient, as can be shown by induction. \nMore strongly, if the factorization of ''n'' satisfies the condition above, then any <math>m \\le \\sigma(n)</math> can be represented as a sum of divisors of ''n'', by the following sequence of steps:<ref>{{harvtxt|Stewart|1954}}; {{harvtxt|Sierpiński|1955}}.</ref>\n* Let <math>q = \\min\\{\\lfloor m/p_k^{\\alpha_k}\\rfloor, \\sigma(n/p_k^{\\alpha_k})\\}</math>, and let <math>r = m - qp_k^{\\sigma_k}</math>.\n* Since <math>q\\le\\sigma(n/p_k^{\\alpha_k})</math> and <math>n/p_k^{\\alpha_k}</math> can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of ''q'' as a sum of divisors of <math>n/p_k^{\\alpha_k}</math>.\n* Since <math>r\\le \\sigma(n) - p_k^{\\alpha_k}\\sigma(n/p_k^{\\alpha_k}) = \\sigma(n/p_k)</math>, and since <math>n/p_k</math> can be shown by induction to be practical, we can find a representation of ''r'' as a sum of divisors of <math>n/p_k</math>.\n* The divisors representing ''r'', together with <math>p_k^{\\alpha_k}</math> times each of the divisors representing ''q'', together form a representation of ''m'' as a sum of divisors of ''n''.\n\n==Properties==\n*The only odd practical number is 1, because if ''n'' > 2 is an odd number, then 2 cannot be expressed as the sum of distinct divisors of&nbsp;''n''. More strongly, {{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}} observes that other than 1 and 2, every practical number is divisible by 4 or 6 (or both).\n*The product of two practical numbers is also a practical number.{{sfnp|Margenstern|1991}} More strongly the [[least common multiple]] of any two practical numbers is also a practical number. Equivalently, the set of all practical numbers is closed under multiplication.\n*From the above characterization by Stewart and Sierpiński it can be seen that if ''n'' is a practical number and ''d'' is one of its divisors then ''n*d'' must also be a practical number. \n*In the set of all practical numbers there is a primitive set of practical numbers. A primitive practical number is either practical and [[squarefree]] or practical and when divided by any of its prime factors whose [[Prime factorization|factorization]] exponent is greater than 1 is no longer practical. The sequence of primitive practical numbers {{OEIS|A267124|}} begins\n::1, 2, 6, 20, 28, 30, 42, 66, 78, 88, 104, 140, 204, 210, 220, 228, 260, 272, 276, 304, 306, 308, 330, 340, 342, 348, 364, 368, 380, 390, 414, 460 ...\n\n==Relation to other classes of numbers==\nSeveral other notable sets of integers consist only of practical numbers:\n*From the above properties with ''n'' a practical number and ''d'' one of its divisors (that is, ''d'' | ''n'') then ''n*d'' must also be a practical number therefore six times every power of 3 must be a practical number as well as six times every power of 2.\n*Every [[power of two]] is a practical number.<ref name=\"s48\"/> Powers of two trivially satisfy the characterization of practical numbers in terms of their prime factorizations: the only prime in their factorizations, ''p''<sub>1</sub>, equals two as required. \n*Every even [[perfect number]] is also a practical number.<ref name=\"s48\"/> This follows from [[Leonhard Euler]]'s result that an even perfect number must have the form 2<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>(2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1). The odd part of this factorization equals the sum of the divisors of the even part, so every odd prime factor of such a number must be at most the sum of the divisors of the even part of the number. Therefore, this number must satisfy the characterization of practical numbers.\n*Every [[primorial]] (the product of the first ''i'' primes, for some ''i'') is practical.<ref name=\"s48\"/> For the first two primorials, two and six, this is clear. Each successive primorial is formed by multiplying a prime number ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> by a smaller primorial that is divisible by both two and the next smaller prime, ''p''<sub>''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>. By [[Bertrand's postulate]], ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;2''p''<sub>''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>, so each successive prime factor in the primorial is less than one of the divisors of the previous primorial. By induction, it follows that every primorial satisfies the characterization of practical numbers. Because a primorial is, by definition, squarefree it is also a primitive practical number.\n*Generalizing the primorials, any number that is the product of nonzero powers of the first ''k'' primes must also be practical. This includes [[Ramanujan]]'s [[highly composite number]]s (numbers with more divisors than any smaller positive integer) as well as the [[factorial]] numbers.<ref name=\"s48\">{{harvtxt|Srinivasan|1948}}.</ref>\n\n==Practical numbers and Egyptian fractions==\nIf ''n'' is practical, then any [[rational number]] of the form ''m''/''n'' with ''m'' < ''n'' may be represented as a sum ∑''d<sub>i</sub>''/''n'' where each ''d<sub>i</sub>'' is a distinct divisor of ''n''. Each term in this sum simplifies to a [[unit fraction]], so such a sum provides a representation of ''m''/''n'' as an [[Egyptian fraction]]. For instance,\n:<math>\\frac{13}{20}=\\frac{10}{20}+\\frac{2}{20}+\\frac{1}{20}=\\frac12+\\frac1{10}+\\frac1{20}.</math>\n\nFibonacci, in his 1202 book ''[[Liber Abaci]]''<ref name=\"sigler\"/> lists several methods for finding Egyptian fraction representations of a rational number. Of these, the first is to test whether the number is itself already a unit fraction, but the second is to search for a representation of the numerator as a sum of divisors of the denominator, as described above. This method is only guaranteed to succeed for denominators that are practical. Fibonacci provides tables of these representations for fractions having as denominators the practical numbers 6, 8, 12, 20, 24, 60, and 100.\n\n{{harvtxt|Vose|1985}} showed that every number ''x''/''y'' has an Egyptian fraction representation with <math>\\scriptstyle O(\\sqrt{\\log y})</math> terms. The proof involves finding a sequence of practical numbers ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> with the property that every number less than ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> may be written as a sum of <math>\\scriptstyle O(\\sqrt{\\log n_{i-1}})</math> distinct divisors of ''n''<sub>''i''</sub>. Then, ''i'' is chosen so that ''n''<sub>''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''<sub>''i''</sub>, and ''xn<sub>i</sub>'' is divided by ''y'' giving quotient ''q'' and remainder ''r''. It follows from these choices that <math>\\scriptstyle\\frac{x}{y}=\\frac{q}{n_i}+\\frac{r}{yn_i}</math>. Expanding both numerators on the right hand side of this formula into sums of divisors of ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> results in the desired Egyptian fraction representation. {{harvtxt|Tenenbaum|Yokota|1990}} use a similar technique involving a different sequence of practical numbers to show that every number ''x''/''y'' has an Egyptian fraction representation in which the largest denominator is <math>\\scriptstyle O(\\frac{y\\log^2 y}{\\log\\log y})</math>.\n\nAccording to a September 2015 conjecture by [[Zhi-Wei Sun]],<ref>[http://maths.nju.edu.cn/~zwsun/UnitFraction.pdf A Conjecture on Unit Fractions Involving Primes]</ref> every positive rational number has an Egyptian fraction representation in which every denominator is a practical number. There is a proof for the conjecture on [[David Eppstein]]'s blog.<ref>[https://11011110.github.io/blog/2016/11/20/egyptian-fractions-with.html 0xDE: Egyptian fractions with practical denominators]</ref>\n\n== Analogies with prime numbers ==\n\nOne reason for interest in practical numbers is that many of their properties are similar to properties of the [[prime numbers]]. \nIndeed, theorems analogous to [[Goldbach's conjecture]] and the [[twin prime conjecture]] are known for practical numbers: every positive even integer is the sum of two practical numbers, and there exist infinitely many triples of practical numbers ''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2,&nbsp;''x'',&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2.<ref>{{harvtxt|Melfi|1996}}.</ref> [[Giuseppe Melfi|Melfi]] also showed that there are infinitely many practical [[Fibonacci number]]s {{OEIS|id=A124105}}; the analogous question of the existence of infinitely many [[Fibonacci prime]]s is open. {{harvtxt|Hausman|Shapiro|1984}} showed that there always exists a practical number in the interval [''x''<sup>2</sup>,(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)<sup>2</sup>] for any positive real ''x'', a result analogous to [[Legendre's conjecture]] for primes.\n\nLet ''p''(''x'') count how many practical numbers are at most&nbsp;''x''.\n{{harvtxt|Margenstern|1991}} conjectured that ''p''(''x'') is asymptotic to ''cx''/log&nbsp;''x'' for some constant ''c'', a formula which resembles the [[prime number theorem]], strengthening the earlier claim of {{harvtxt|Erdős|Loxton|1979}} that the practical numbers have density zero in the integers.\n{{harvtxt|Saias|1997}} showed that, for suitable positive constants ''c''<sub>1</sub> and ''c''<sub>2</sub>,\n\n:<math>c_1\\frac x{\\log x}<p(x)<c_2\\frac x{\\log x}.</math>\n\n{{harvtxt|Weingartner|2015}} proved Margenstern's conjecture by showing that\n\n:<math>p(x) = \\frac{c x}{\\log x}\\left(1 + O\\!\\left(\\frac{\\log \\log x}{\\log x}\\right)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere <math>c=1.3360...</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Weingartner|2019b}}.</ref> Thus the practical numbers are about 33.6% more numerous than the prime numbers.

Therefore the product, 47058, is primary pseudoperfect.]]\nIn [[mathematics]], and particularly in [[number theory]], ''N'' is a '''primary pseudoperfect number''' if it satisfies the [[Egyptian fraction]] equation\n:<math>\\sum_{p|N}\\frac1p + \\frac1N = 1,</math>\nwhere the sum is over only the [[prime divisor]]s of ''N''.\n\n== Properties ==\nEquivalently, ''N'' is a primary pseudoperfect number if it satisfies\n:<math>\\sum_{p|N}\\frac{N}p + 1 = N.</math>\nExcept for the primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' = 2, this expression gives a representation for ''N'' as the sum of distinct divisors of ''N''. Therefore, each primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' (except ''N'' = 2) is also [[Semiperfect number|pseudoperfect]].\n\nThe eight known primary pseudoperfect numbers are\n:[[2 (number)|2]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[42 (number)|42]], 1806, 47058, 2214502422, 52495396602, 8490421583559688410706771261086 {{OEIS|id=A054377}}.\nThe first four of these numbers are one less than the corresponding numbers in [[Sylvester's sequence]], but then the two sequences diverge.\n\nIt is unknown whether there are infinitely many primary pseudoperfect numbers, or whether there are any odd primary pseudoperfect numbers.\n\nThe prime factors of primary pseudoperfect numbers sometimes may provide solutions to [[Znám's problem]], in which all elements of the solution set are prime. For instance, the prime factors of the primary pseudoperfect number 47058 form the solution set {2,3,11,23,31} to Znám's problem. However, the smaller primary pseudoperfect numbers 2, 6, 42, and 1806 do not correspond to solutions to Znám's problem in this way, as their sets of prime factors violate the requirement that no number in the set can equal one plus the product of the other numbers. Anne (1998) observes that there is exactly one solution set of this type that has ''k'' primes in it, for each ''k'' ≤ 8, and conjectures that the same is true for larger ''k''.\n\nIf a primary pseudoperfect number ''N'' is one less than a prime number, then ''N''&times;(''N''+1) is also primary pseudoperfect. For instance, 47058 is primary pseudoperfect, and 47059 is prime, so 47058 &times; 47059 = 2214502422 is also primary pseudoperfect.\n\n== History ==\nPrimary pseudoperfect numbers were first investigated and named by Butske, Jaje, and Mayernik (2000). Using computational search techniques, they proved the remarkable result that for each positive integer ''r'' up to 8, there exists exactly one primary pseudoperfect number with precisely ''r'' (distinct) prime factors, namely, the ''r''th known primary pseudoperfect number. Those with 2 ≤ ''r'' ≤ 8, when reduced [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 288, form the [[arithmetic progression]] 6, 42, 78, 114, 150, 186, 222, as was observed by Sondow and MacMillan (2017).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Giuga number]]\n\n==References==\n* {{citation\n  | last = Anne | first = Premchand\n  | title = Egyptian fractions and the inheritance problem\n  | journal = [[The College Mathematics Journal]]\n  | volume = 29\n  | issue = 4\n  | year = 1998\n  | pages = 296–300\n  | doi = 10.2307/2687685\n  | jstor = 2687685\n  | publisher = [[Mathematical Association of America]]}}.\n\n* {{citation\n  | last1 = Butske | first1 = William | last2 = Jaje | first2 = Lynda M. | last3 = Mayernik | first3 = Daniel R.\n  | title = On the equation <math>\\scriptstyle\\sum_{p|N}\\frac{1}{p}+\\frac{1}{N}=1</math>, pseudoperfect numbers, and perfectly weighted graphs\n  | journal = [[Mathematics of Computation]]\n  | volume = 69\n  | year = 2000\n  | pages = 407–420\n  | doi = 10.1090/S0025-5718-99-01088-1}}.\n\n* {{citation\n  | last1 = Sondow | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = MacMillan | first2 = Kieren\n  | title = Primary pseudoperfect numbers, arithmetic progressions, and the Erdős-Moser equation\n  | journal = [[The American Mathematical Monthly]]\n  | volume = 124\n  | issue = 3\n  | year = 2017\n  | pages = 232–240\n  | doi = 10.4169/amer.math.monthly.124.3.232| arxiv = 1812.06566 }}.\n\n==External links==\n* {{PlanetMath | urlname = PrimaryPseudoperfectNumber | title = Primary Pseudoperfect Number}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname = PrimaryPseudoperfectNumber | title = Primary Pseudoperfect Number}}\n\n{{Classes of natural numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Egyptian fractions]]"

A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a [[composite number]]. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a [[Product (mathematics)|product]], {{nowrap|1 × 5}} or {{nowrap|5 × 1}}, involve 5 itself.\nHowever, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers ({{nowrap|2 × 3}}) that are both smaller than 6. Primes are central in [[number theory]] because of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]: every natural number greater than 1 is either a prime itself or can be [[factorization|factorized]] as a product of primes that is unique [[up to]] their order.\n\nThe property of being prime is called primality. A simple but slow method of checking the primality of a given number <math>n</math>, called [[trial division]], tests whether <math>n</math> is a multiple of any integer between 2 and <math>\\sqrt{n}</math>. Faster algorithms include the [[Miller–Rabin primality test]], which is fast but has a small chance of error, and the [[AKS primality test]], which always produces the correct answer in [[polynomial time]] but is too slow to be practical. Particularly fast methods are available for numbers of special forms, such as [[Mersenne number]]s. {{As of|2018|12}} the [[largest known prime number]] has 24,862,048 [[numerical digit|decimal digits]].\n\nThere are [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] primes, as [[Euclid's theorem|demonstrated by Euclid]] around 300 BC. No known simple formula separates prime numbers from composite numbers. However, the distribution of primes within the natural numbers in the large can be statistically modelled. The first result in that direction is the [[prime number theorem]], proven at the end of the 19th century, which says that the [[probability]] of a randomly chosen number being prime is inversely [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its number of digits, that is, to its [[logarithm]].\n\nSeveral historical questions regarding prime numbers are still unsolved. These include [[Goldbach's conjecture]], that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes, and the [[twin prime]] conjecture, that there are infinitely many pairs of primes having just one even number between them. Such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory, focusing on [[analytic number theory|analytic]] or [[algebraic number theory|algebraic]] aspects of numbers. Primes are used in several routines in [[information technology]], such as [[public-key cryptography]], which relies on the difficulty of [[Integer factorization|factoring]] large numbers into their prime factors. In [[abstract algebra]], objects that behave in a generalized way like prime numbers include [[prime element]]s and [[prime ideal]]s.\n\n==Definition and examples==\n{{main|List of prime numbers}}\nA [[natural number]] (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, etc.) is called a ''prime number'' (or a ''prime'') if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as a product of two natural numbers that are both smaller than it.

In the ring of integers, the prime and irreducible elements form the same set,\n:<math>\\{ \\dots, -11, -7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, \\dots \\}\\, .</math>\nIn an arbitrary ring, all prime elements are irreducible.

An example of such a domain is the [[Gaussian integer]]s <math>\\mathbb{Z}[i]</math>, the ring of [[complex number]]s of the form <math>a+bi</math> where <math>i</math> denotes the [[imaginary unit]] and <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are arbitrary integers. Its prime elements are known as [[Gaussian prime]]s. Not every number that is prime among the integers remains prime in the Gaussian integers; for instance, the number 2 can be written as a product of the two Gaussian primes <math>1+i</math> and <math>1-i</math>. Rational primes (the prime elements in the integers) congruent to 3 mod 4 are Gaussian primes, but rational primes congruent to 1 mod 4 are not.<ref>{{harvnb|Lauritzen|2003}}, Corollary 3.5.14, p. 133; Lemma 3.5.18, p. 136.</ref> This is a consequence of [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares]],\nwhich states that an odd prime <math>p</math> is expressible as the sum of two squares, <math>p=x^2+y^2</math>, and therefore factorizable as <math>p=(x+iy)(x-iy)</math>, exactly when <math>p</math> is 1 mod 4.<ref>{{harvnb|Kraft|Washington|2014}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4NAqBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA297 Section 12.1, Sums of two squares, pp. 297–301].</ref>\n\n===Prime ideals===\n{{Main|Prime ideals}}\nNot every ring is a unique factorization domain.

In order to extend unique factorization to a larger class of rings, the notion of a number can be replaced with that of an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], a subset of the elements of a ring that contains all sums of pairs of its elements, and all products of its elements with ring elements.\n''Prime ideals'', which generalize prime elements in the sense that the [[principal ideal]] generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, are an important tool and object of study in [[commutative algebra]], [[number theory|algebraic number theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]]. The prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals (0), (2), (3), (5), (7), (11), … The fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]], which expresses every ideal in a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] [[commutative ring]] as an intersection of [[primary ideal]]s, which are the appropriate generalizations of [[prime power]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Eisenbud | first1=David | author1-link= David Eisenbud | title=Commutative Algebra | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=Berlin; New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94268-1| mr=1322960 | year=1995 | volume=150 | at=Section 3.3}}</ref>\n\nThe [[spectrum of a ring]] is a geometric space whose points are the prime ideals of the ring.<ref>{{cite book | last = Shafarevich | first = Igor R. | authorlink = Igor Shafarevich | doi = 10.1007/978-3-642-38010-5 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 978-3-642-38009-9 | mr = 3100288 | publisher = Springer, Heidelberg | title = Basic Algebraic Geometry 2: Schemes and Complex Manifolds | year = 2013 | contribution = Definition of <math>\\operatorname{Spec} A</math> | page = 5 | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zDW8BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA5}}</ref> [[Arithmetic geometry]] also benefits from this notion, and many concepts exist in both geometry and number theory. For example, factorization or [[Splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|ramification]] of prime ideals when lifted to an [[field extension|extension field]], a basic problem of algebraic number theory, bears some resemblance with [[ramified cover|ramification in geometry]]. These concepts can even assist with in number-theoretic questions solely concerned with integers.

One group of modern primality tests is applicable to arbitrary numbers, while more efficient tests are available for numbers of special types. Most primality tests only tell whether their argument is prime or not. Routines that also provide a prime factor of composite arguments (or all of its prime factors) are called [[integer factorization|factorization]] algorithms.\nPrime numbers are also used in computing for [[checksum]]s, [[hash table]]s, and [[pseudorandom number generator]]s.\n\n===Trial division===\n{{main|Trial division}}\nThe most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer <math>n</math> is called ''[[trial division]]''.

      "title": "Primefree sequence",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primefree_sequence",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''primefree sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s that does not contain any [[prime number]]s. More specifically, it usually means a sequence defined by the same [[recurrence relation]] as the [[Fibonacci number]]s, but with different [[initial conditions]] causing all members of the sequence to be [[composite number]]s that do not all have a common [[divisor]]. To put it algebraically, a sequence of this type is defined by an appropriate choice of two composite numbers ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub>, such that the [[greatest common divisor]] GCD(''a''<sub>1</sub>,''a''<sub>2</sub>) is equal to 1, and such that for ''n''&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;2 there are no primes in the sequence of numbers calculated from the formula\n:''a''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2</sub>.\n\n==Wilf's sequence==\nPerhaps the best known primefree sequence is the one found by [[Herbert Wilf]], with initial terms \n\n:''a''<sub>1</sub> = 20615674205555510, ''a''<sub>2</sub> = 3794765361567513 {{OEIS|id=A083216}}.\n\nThe proof that every term of this sequence is composite relies on the periodicity of Fibonacci-like number sequences modulo the members of a finite set of primes. For each prime ''p'', the positions in the sequence where the numbers are divisible by ''p'' repeat in a periodic pattern, and different primes in the set have overlapping patterns that result in a [[covering set]] for the whole sequence.\n\n==Nontriviality==\nThe requirement that the initial terms of a primefree sequence be coprime is necessary for the question to be non-trivial. If we allow the initial terms to share a prime factor ''p'' (e.g., set ''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''xp'' and ''a''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''yp'' for some ''x'' and ''y'' both greater than 1), due to the [[distributivity|distributive property]] of [[multiplication]] ''a''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'')''p'' and more generally all subsequent value in the sequence will be multiples of ''p''. In this case, all the numbers in the sequence will be composite, but for a trivial reason.\n\nThe order of the initial terms is also important.

Otherwise, if ''G'' is transitive and ''G'' does preserve a nontrivial partition, ''G'' is called '''imprimitive'''. \n\nWhile primitive permutation groups are transitive by definition, not all transitive permutation groups are primitive. The requirement that a primitive group be transitive is necessary only when ''X'' is a 2-element set and the action is trivial; otherwise, the condition that ''G'' preserves no nontrivial partition implies that ''G'' is transitive. This is because for non-transitive actions either the [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of ''G'' form a nontrivial partition preserved by ''G'', or the group action is trivial, in which case any nontrivial partition of ''X'' (which exists for |''X''|≥''3'') is preserved by ''G''.\n\nThis terminology was introduced by [[Évariste Galois]] in his last letter, in which he used the French term ''équation primitive'' for an equation whose [[Galois group]] is primitive.<ref> Galois' last letter: http://www.galois.ihp.fr/ressources/vie-et-oeuvre-de-galois/lettres/lettre-testament</ref>\n\nIn the same letter he stated also the following theorem.\n\nIf ''G'' is a primitive [[solvable group]] acting on a finite set ''X'', then the order of ''X'' is a power of a [[prime number]] ''p'', ''X'' may be identified with an [[affine space]] over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements and ''G'' acts on ''X'' as a subgroup of the [[affine group]].\n\nAn imprimitive permutation group is an example of an [[induced representation]]; examples include [[coset]] representations ''G''/''H'' in cases where ''H'' is not a [[maximal subgroup]]. When ''H'' is maximal, the coset representation is primitive. \n\nIf the set ''X'' is finite, its cardinality is called the \"degree\" of ''G''. \nThe numbers of primitive groups of small degree were stated by [[Robert Carmichael]] in 1937:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Degree || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || [[OEIS]]\n|-\n| Number || 1 || 2 || 2 || 5 || 4 || 7 || 7 || 11 || 9 || 8 || 6 || 9 || 4 || 6 || 22 || 10 || 4 || 8 || 4 || 9 || 4 || 7 || 5 || {{OEIS link|id=A000019}}\n|}\n\nNote the large number of primitive groups of degree 16.

Both plots are logarithmic.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], and more particularly in [[number theory]], '''primorial''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from [[natural number]]s to natural numbers similar to the [[factorial]] function, but rather than successively multiplying positive integers, only [[prime number]]s are multiplied. The symbol for primorial is “#”.\n\nThere are two conflicting definitions that differ in the interpretation of the argument: the first interprets the argument as an index into the sequence of prime numbers (so that the function is [[strictly increasing]]), while the second interprets the argument as a bound on the prime numbers to be multiplied (so that the function value at any [[composite number]] is the same as at its predecessor). The rest of this article uses the former interpretation.\n\nThe name \"primorial\", coined by [[Harvey Dubner]], draws an analogy to ''primes'' similar to the way the name \"factorial\" relates to ''factors''.\n\n== Definition for primorial numbers ==\n\nFor the {{mvar|n}}th prime number {{mvar|p<sub>n</sub>}}, the primorial {{math|''p<sub>n</sub>''#}} is defined as the product of the first {{mvar|n}} primes:<ref name=\"mathworld\">{{Mathworld | urlname=Primorial | title=Primorial}}</ref><ref name=\"OEIS A002110\">{{OEIS|id=A002110}}</ref>\n\n:<math>p_n\\# \\equiv \\prod_{k=1}^n p_k</math>,\n\nwhere {{mvar|p<sub>k</sub>}} is the {{mvar|k}}th prime number. For instance, {{math|''p''<sub>5</sub>#}} signifies the product of the first 5 primes:\n\n:<math>p_5\\# = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11 = 2310.</math>\n\nThe first five primorials {{math|''p<sub>n</sub>''#}} are:\n\n:[[2 (number)|2]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[30 (number)|30]], [[210 (number)|210]], 2310 {{OEIS|id=A002110}}.\n\nThe sequence also includes {{math|''p''<sub>0</sub># {{=}} 1}} as [[empty product]]. Asymptotically, primorials {{math|''p<sub>n</sub>''#}} grow according to:\n\n:<math>p_n\\# = e^{(1 + o(1)) n \\log n},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''o''( )}} is [[Little O notation]].<ref name=\"OEIS A002110\" />\n\n== Definition for natural numbers ==\nIn general for a positive integer {{mvar|n}}, a primorial {{math|''n''#}} can also be defined, namely as the product of those primes ≤ {{mvar|n}}:<ref name=\"mathworld\" /><ref name=\"OEIS A034386\">{{OEIS|id=A034386}}</ref>\n\n:<math>n\\# \\equiv \\prod_{i=1}^{\\pi(n)} p_i = p_{\\pi(n)}\\# </math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''π''(''n'')}} is the [[prime-counting function]] {{OEIS|id=A000720}}, giving the number of primes ≤ {{mvar|n}}. This is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>n\\# = \n\\begin{cases}\n    1 & \\text{if }n = 0,\\ 1 \\\\\n    (n-1)\\# \\times n & \\text{if } n \\text{ is prime} \\\\\n    (n-1)\\# & \\text{if } n \\text{ is composite}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nFor example, 12# represents the product of those primes ≤ 12:\n\n:<math>12\\# = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\times 11= 2310.</math>\n\nSince {{math|''π''(12) {{=}} 5}}, this can be calculated as:\n\n:<math>12\\# = p_{\\pi(12)}\\# = p_5\\# = 2310.</math>\n\nConsider the first 12 values of {{math|''n''#}}:\n\n:1, 2, 6, 6, 30, 30, 210, 210, 210, 210, 2310, 2310.\n\nWe see that for composite {{mvar|n}} every term {{math|''n''#}} simply duplicates the preceding term {{math|(''n'' − 1)#}}, as given in the definition. In the above example we have {{math|12# {{=}} ''p''<sub>5</sub># {{=}} 11#}} since 12 is a composite number.\n\nPrimorials are related to the first [[Chebyshev function]], written {{math|''ϑ''(''n'')}} or {{math|''θ''(''n'')}} according to:\n\n:<math>\\ln (n\\#) = \\vartheta(n).</math><ref>{{Mathworld | urlname=ChebyshevFunctions | title=Chebyshev Functions}}</ref>\n\nSince {{math|''ϑ''(''n'')}} asymptotically approaches {{math|''n''}} for large values of {{math|''n''}}, primorials therefore grow according to:\n:<math>n\\# = e^{(1+o(1))n}.</math>\n\nThe idea of multiplying all known primes occurs in some proofs of the [[infinitude of the prime numbers]], where it is used to derive the existence of another prime.\n\n== Applications and properties ==\nPrimorials play a role in the search for [[Primes in arithmetic progression|prime numbers in additive arithmetic progressions]]. For instance, \n{{val|2236133941}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;23# results in a prime, beginning a sequence of thirteen primes found by repeatedly adding 23#, and ending with {{val|5136341251}}. 23# is also the common difference in arithmetic progressions of fifteen and sixteen primes.\n\nEvery [[highly composite number]] is a product of primorials (e.g. [[360 (number)|360]] = {{nowrap|2 × 6 × 30}}).<ref>{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A002182|name=Highly composite numbers}}</ref>\n\nPrimorials are all [[square-free integer]]s, and each one has more distinct [[prime factor]]s than any number smaller than it. For each primorial {{mvar|n}}, the fraction {{math|{{sfrac|''φ''(''n'')|''n''}}}} is smaller than it for any lesser integer, where {{mvar|φ}} is the [[Euler totient function]].\n\nAny [[completely multiplicative function]] is defined by its values at primorials, since it is defined by its values at primes, which can be recovered by division of adjacent values.\n\nBase systems corresponding to primorials (such as base 30, not to be confused with the [[Mixed Radix#Primorial number system|primorial number system]]) have a lower proportion of [[repeating fraction]]s than any smaller base.\n\nEvery primorial is a [[sparsely totient number]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Masser | first1=D.W. | author1-link=David Masser | last2=Shiu | first2=P. | title=On sparsely totient numbers | journal=Pac.

Each distinct prime factor of a pronic number is present in only one of the factors ''n'' or ''n''+1.

The vertical scale is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]].<ref>Inspired by similar diagrams by Erkki Kurenniemi in [http://www.beige.org/projects/dimi/CSDL2.pdf \"Chords, scales, and divisor lattices\"].</ref>]]\n\n'''Regular numbers''' are numbers that evenly divide powers of [[60 (number)|60]] (or, equivalently powers of [[30 (number)|30]]). As an example, 60<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3600&nbsp;=&nbsp;48&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;75, so both 48 and 75 are divisors of a power of 60.  Thus, they are ''regular numbers''.  Equivalently, they are the numbers whose only prime divisors are 2, 3, and 5.\n\nThe numbers that evenly divide the powers of 60 arise in several areas of mathematics and its applications, and have different names coming from these different areas of study.\n\n* In [[number theory]], these numbers are called '''5-smooth''', because they can be characterized as having only 2, 3, or 5 as [[prime factor]]s. This is a specific case of the more general ''k''-[[smooth number]]s, i.e., a set of numbers that have no prime factor greater than ''k''.\n* In the study of [[Babylonian mathematics]], the divisors of powers of 60 are called '''regular numbers''' or '''regular sexagesimal numbers''', and are of great importance due to the [[sexagesimal]] number system used by the Babylonians.\n* In [[music theory]], regular numbers occur in the ratios of tones in [[five-limit tuning|five-limit]] [[just intonation]].\n* In [[computer science]], regular numbers are often called '''Hamming numbers''', after [[Richard Hamming]], who proposed the problem of finding computer [[algorithm]]s for generating these numbers in ascending order.\n\n== Number theory ==\n\nFormally, a regular number is an [[integer]] of the form 2<sup>''i''</sup>·3<sup>''j''</sup>·5<sup>''k''</sup>, for nonnegative integers ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''. Such a number is a divisor of <math>\\scriptstyle 60^{\\max(\\lceil i\\,/2\\rceil,j,k)}{}</math>. The regular numbers are also called 5-[[smooth number|smooth]], indicating that their greatest [[prime factor]] is at most 5.\n\nThe first few regular numbers are\n:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48, 50, 54, 60, ... {{OEIS | id = A051037}}.\n\nSeveral other sequences at OEIS have definitions involving 5-smooth numbers.<ref>[http://www.oeis.org/search?q=5-smooth OEIS search for sequences involving 5-smoothness].</ref>\n\nAlthough the regular numbers appear dense within the range from 1 to 60, they are quite sparse among the larger integers. A regular number ''n'' = 2<sup>''i''</sup>·3<sup>''j''</sup>·5<sup>''k''</sup> is less than or equal to ''N'' if and only if the point (''i'',''j'',''k'') belongs to the [[tetrahedron]] bounded by the coordinate planes and the plane\n:<math>(\\ln 2)i+(\\ln 3)j+(\\ln 5)k\\le\\ln N,</math>\nas can be seen by taking logarithms of both sides of the inequality 2<sup>''i''</sup>·3<sup>''j''</sup>·5<sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''N''.\nTherefore,  the number of regular numbers that are at most ''N'' can be estimated as the [[volume]] of this tetrahedron, which is\n:<math>\\frac{\\log_2 N\\,\\log_3 N\\,\\log_5 N}{6}.</math>\nEven more precisely, using [[big O notation]], the number of regular numbers up to ''N'' is\n:<math>\\frac{\\left(\\ln(N\\sqrt{30})\\right)^3}{6\\ln 2 \\ln 3 \\ln 5}+O(\\log N),</math>\nand it has been conjectured that the error term of this approximation is actually <math>O(\\log\\log N)</math>.<ref>{{Cite OEIS|A051037}}</ref>\nA similar formula for the number of 3-smooth numbers up to ''N'' is given by [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] in his first letter to [[G. H. Hardy]].<ref>{{citation|title=Ramanujan: letters and commentary|volume=9|series=History of mathematics|publisher=American Mathematical Society|editor1-first=Bruce C.|editor1-last=Berndt|editor2-first=Robert Alexander|editor2-last=Rankin|year=1995|isbn=978-0-8218-0470-4|page=23}}.</ref>\n\n== Babylonian mathematics ==\n\nIn the Babylonian [[sexagesimal]] notation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a regular number has a finite representation, thus being easy to divide by. Specifically, if ''n'' divides 60<sup>k</sup>, then the sexagesimal representation of 1/''n'' is just that for 60<sup>k</sup>/''n'', shifted by some number of places.\n\nFor instance, suppose we wish to divide by the regular number 54 = 2<sup>1</sup>3<sup>3</sup>. 54 is a divisor of 60<sup>3</sup>, and 60<sup>3</sup>/54 = 4000, so dividing by 54 in sexagesimal can be accomplished by multiplying by 4000 and shifting three places. In sexagesimal 4000 = 1&times;3600 + 6&times;60 + 40&times;1, or (as listed by Joyce) 1:6:40. Thus, 1/54, in sexagesimal, is 1/60 + 6/60<sup>2</sup> + 40/60<sup>3</sup>, also denoted 1:6:40 as Babylonian notational conventions did not specify the power of the starting digit. Conversely 1/4000 = 54/60<sup>3</sup>, so division by 1:6:40 = 4000 can be accomplished by instead multiplying by 54 and shifting three sexagesimal places.\n\nThe Babylonians used tables of reciprocals of regular numbers, some of which still survive (Sachs, 1947). These tables existed relatively unchanged throughout Babylonian times.<ref name=\"aa\">{{harvtxt|Aaboe|1965}}.</ref>\n\nAlthough the primary reason for preferring regular numbers to other numbers involves the finiteness of their reciprocals, some Babylonian calculations other than reciprocals also involved regular numbers. For instance, tables of regular squares have been found<ref name=\"aa\"/> and the broken [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]] [[Plimpton 322]] has been  interpreted by [[Otto E. Neugebauer|Neugebauer]] as listing [[Pythagorean triple]]s <math>( p^2 - q^2,\\, 2pq,\\, p^2 + q^2 )</math> generated by ''p'', ''q'' both regular and less than 60.<ref>See {{harvtxt|Conway|Guy|1996}} for a popular treatment of this interpretation. [[Plimpton 322]] has other interpretations, for which see its article, but all involve regular numbers.</ref>\n\n== Music theory ==\n\nIn [[music theory]], the [[just intonation]] of the [[diatonic scale]] involves regular numbers: the [[pitch (music)|pitches]] in a single [[octave]] of this scale have frequencies proportional to the numbers in the sequence 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45, 48 of nearly consecutive regular numbers. Thus, for an instrument with this tuning, all pitches are regular-number [[harmonic]]s of a single [[fundamental frequency]]. This scale is called a 5-[[limit (music)|limit]] tuning, meaning that the [[interval (music)|interval]] between any two pitches can be described as a product 2<sup>i</sup>3<sup>j</sup>5<sup>k</sup> of powers of the prime numbers up to 5, or equivalently as a ratio of regular numbers.\n\n5-limit musical scales other than the familiar diatonic scale of Western music have also been used, both in traditional musics of other cultures and in modern experimental music: {{harvtxt|Honingh|Bod|2005}} list 31 different 5-limit scales, drawn from a larger database of musical scales. Each of these 31 scales shares with diatonic just intonation the property that all intervals are ratios of regular numbers. [[Euler]]'s [[tonnetz]] provides a convenient graphical representation of the pitches in any 5-limit tuning, by factoring out the octave relationships (powers of two) so that the remaining values form a planar [[Regular grid|grid]]. Some music theorists have stated more generally that regular numbers are fundamental to tonal music itself, and that pitch ratios based on primes larger than 5 cannot be [[Consonance and dissonance|consonant]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Asmussen|2001}}, for instance, states that \"within any piece of tonal music\" all intervals must be ratios of regular numbers, echoing similar statements by much earlier writers such as {{harvtxt|Habens|1889}}. In the modern music theory literature this assertion is often attributed to {{harvtxt|Longuet-Higgins|1962}}, who used a graphical arrangement closely related to the [[tonnetz]] to organize 5-limit pitches.</ref> However the [[equal temperament]] of modern pianos is not a 5-limit tuning, and some modern composers have experimented with tunings based on primes larger than five.\n\nIn connection with the application of regular numbers to music theory, it is of interest to find pairs of regular numbers that differ by one. There are exactly ten such pairs (''x'', ''x''+1)<ref>{{harvtxt|Halsey|Hewitt|1972}} note that this follows from [[Størmer's theorem]] {{harv|Størmer|1897}}, and provide a proof for this case; see also {{harvtxt|Silver|1971}}.</ref> and each such pair defines a [[Superparticular number|superparticular ratio]] (''x'' + 1)/''x'' that is meaningful as a musical interval. These intervals are 2/1 (the [[octave]]), 3/2 (the [[perfect fifth]]), 4/3 (the [[perfect fourth]]), 5/4 (the [[just major third]]), 6/5 (the [[just minor third]]), 9/8 (the [[just major tone]]), 10/9 (the [[just minor tone]]), 16/15 (the [[just diatonic semitone]]), 25/24 (the [[just chromatic semitone]]), and 81/80 (the [[syntonic comma]]).\n\n==Algorithms==\n\nAlgorithms for calculating the regular numbers in ascending order were popularized by [[Edsger Dijkstra]]. {{harvs|last=Dijkstra||year=1976|year2=1981|txt}} attributes to Hamming the problem of building the infinite ascending sequence of all 5-smooth numbers; this problem is now known as '''Hamming's problem''', and the numbers so generated are also called the '''Hamming numbers'''. Dijkstra's ideas to compute these numbers are the following:\n\n* The sequence of Hamming numbers begins with the number 1.\n* The remaining values in the sequence are of the form 2''h'', 3''h'', and 5''h'', where ''h'' is any Hamming number.\n* Therefore, the sequence ''H'' may be generated by outputting the value 1, and then [[Merge algorithm|merging]] the sequences 2''H'', 3''H'', and 5''H''.\n\nThis algorithm is often used to demonstrate the power of a [[Lazy evaluation|lazy]] [[functional programming language]], because (implicitly) concurrent efficient implementations, using a constant number of arithmetic operations per generated value, are easily constructed as described above. Similarly efficient strict functional or [[imperative programming language|imperative]] sequential implementations are also possible whereas explicitly concurrent [[generator (computer programming)|generative]] solutions might be non-trivial.<ref>See, e.g., {{harvtxt|Hemmendinger|1988}} or {{harvtxt|Yuen|1992}}.</ref>\n\nIn the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]], lazy functional code for generating regular numbers is used as one of the built-in tests for correctness of the language's implementation.<ref>Function m235 in [http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Lib/test/test_generators.py test_generators.py].</ref>\n\nA related problem, discussed by {{harvtxt|Knuth|1972}}, is to list all ''k''-digit sexagesimal numbers in ascending order, as was done (for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6) by Inakibit-Anu, the [[Seleucid]]-era scribe of tablet AO6456. In algorithmic terms, this is equivalent to generating (in order) the subsequence of the infinite sequence of regular numbers, ranging from 60<sup>''k''</sup> to 60<sup>''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>.\nSee {{harvtxt|Gingerich|1965}} for an early description of computer code that generates these numbers out of order and then sorts them; Knuth describes an ad-hoc algorithm, which he attributes to {{harvtxt|Bruins|1970}}, for generating the six-digit numbers more quickly but that does not generalize in a straightforward way to larger values of ''k''.  {{Harvtxt |Eppstein|2007}} describes an algorithm for computing tables of this type in linear time for arbitrary values of ''k''.\n\n== Other applications ==\n\n{{harvtxt|Heninger|Rains|Sloane|2006}} show that, when ''n'' is a regular number and is divisible by 8, the generating function of an ''n''-dimensional extremal even [[unimodular lattice]] is an ''n''th power of a polynomial.\n\nAs with other classes of [[smooth number]]s, regular numbers are important as problem sizes in computer programs for performing the [[fast Fourier transform]], a technique for analyzing the dominant frequencies of signals in [[Signal (electrical engineering)|time-varying data]]. For instance, the method of {{harvtxt|Temperton|1992}} requires that the transform length be a regular number.\n\nBook VIII of [[Plato]]'s [[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]] involves an allegory of marriage centered on the highly regular number 60<sup>4</sup> = 12,960,000 and its divisors. Later scholars have invoked both Babylonian mathematics and music theory in an attempt to explain this passage.<ref>{{harvtxt|Barton|1908}}; {{harvtxt|McClain|1974}}.</ref> (See [[Plato's number]].)\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{citation\n | authorlink = Aaboe\n | last = Aaboe | first = Asger\n | title = Some Seleucid mathematical tables (extended reciprocals and squares of regular numbers)\n | journal = [[Journal of Cuneiform Studies]]\n | volume = 19\n | issue = 3\n | pages = 79–86\n | year = 1965\n | mr = 0191779 \n | doi = 10.2307/1359089\n | publisher = The American Schools of Oriental Research\n | jstor = 1359089}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Asmussen\n | first = Robert\n | title = Periodicity of sinusoidal frequencies as a basis for the analysis of Baroque and Classical harmony: a computer based study\n | year = 2001\n | url = http://www.terraworld.net/c-jasmussen/thesis_asmussen.pdf\n | series = Ph.D. thesis | publisher = [[University of Leeds]]}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Barton | first = George A.\n | title = On the Babylonian origin of Plato's nuptial number\n | year = 1908\n | journal = [[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]\n | volume = 29\n | pages = 210–219\n | doi = 10.2307/592627\n | publisher = American Oriental Society\n | jstor = 592627}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Bruins | first = E.

They were named after the German mathematician [[Ernst Schröder]].\n\n==Examples==\nThe following figure shows the 6 such paths through a <math>2 \\times 2</math> grid:\n\n[[File:Schroeder number 2x2.svg]]\n\n==Related constructions==\nA Schröder path of length <math>n</math> is a [[lattice path]] from <math>(0,0)</math> to <math>(2n,0)</math> with steps northeast, <math>(1,1)</math>; east, <math>(2,0)</math>; and southeast, <math>(1,-1)</math>, that do not go below the <math>x</math>-axis. The <math>n</math>th Schröder number is the number of Schröder paths of length <math>n</math>.<ref name=\"Ardila methods\" /> The following figure shows the 6 Schröder paths of length 2.\n\n[[File:Schroeder paths.svg]]\n\nSimilarly, the Schröder numbers count the number of ways to divide a [[rectangle]] into <math>n+1</math> smaller rectangles using <math>n</math> cuts through <math>n</math> points given inside the rectangle in general position, each cut intersecting one of the points and dividing only a single rectangle in two. This is similar to the process of [[triangulation]], in which a shape is divided into nonoverlapping triangles instead of rectangles. The following figure shows the 6 such dissections of a rectangle into 3 rectangles using two cuts:\n\n[[File:Schroeder rectangulation 3.svg]]\n\nPictured below are the 22 dissections of a rectangle into 4 rectangles using three cuts:\n\n[[File:Schroeder rectangulation 4.svg]]\n\nSchröder numbers also count [[separable permutation]]s of length ''n''-1.\n\n==Related sequences==\nSchröder numbers are sometimes called ''large'' or ''big'' Schröder numbers because there is another Schröder sequence: the ''little Schröder numbers'', also known as the [[Schröder-Hipparchus number]]s or the ''super-Catalan numbers''. The connections between these paths can be seen in a few ways:\n\n* Consider the paths from <math>(0,0)</math> to <math>(n,n)</math> with steps <math>(1,1)</math>, <math>(2,0)</math>, and <math>(1,-1)</math> that do not rise above the main diagonal; there are two types of paths: those that have movements along the main diagonal and those that do not. The (large) Schröder numbers count both types of paths, and the little Schröder numbers count only the paths that only touch the diagonal but have no movements along it.<ref name=\"A001003\" />\n\n* Just as there are (large) Schröder paths, a little Schröder path is a Schröder path that has no horizontal steps on the <math>x</math>-axis.<ref name=\"Bijections with Dyck paths\" /> \n\n* If <math>S_n</math> is the <math>n</math>th Schröder number and <math>s_n</math> is the <math>n</math>th little Schröder number, then <math>S_n = 2s_n</math> for <math>n>0 (S_0 = s_0 = 1)</math>.<ref name=\"Bijections with Dyck paths\" /> \n\nSchröder paths are similar to [[Dyck path]]s but allow the horizontal step instead of just diagonal steps. Another similar path is the type of path that the [[Motzkin number]]s count; the Motzkin paths allow the same diagonal paths but allow only a single horizontal step, (1,0), and count such paths from <math>(0,0)</math> to <math>(n,0)</math>.<ref name=\"Catalan, Motzkin, and Schröder numbers\" /> \n\nThere is also a [[triangular array]] associated with the Schröder numbers that provides a [[recurrence relation]]<ref name=\"A033877\" /> (though not just with the Schröder numbers). The first few terms are \n\n:1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6, 1, 6, 16, 22, .... {{OEIS|id=A033877}}.\n\nIt is easier to see the connection with the Schröder numbers when the sequence is in its triangular form:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" {{ts|ar}}\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|{{mvar|n}}|{{mvar|k}}}}\n! width=\"50\" | 0\n! width=\"50\" | 1\n! width=\"50\" | 2\n! width=\"50\" | 3\n! width=\"50\" | 4\n! width=\"50\" | 5\n! width=\"50\" | 6\n|-\n! 0\n|  1  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || \n|-\n! 1\n|  1  ||  2  ||   ||   ||   ||   ||  \n|-\n! 2\n|  1  || 4 || 6 ||   ||   ||   ||  \n|-\n! 3\n|  1  || 6 || 16 || 22 ||   ||   ||  \n|-\n! 4\n|  1  || 8 || 30 || 68 || 90 ||   ||  \n|-\n! 5\n| 1 || 10 || 48 || 146 || 304 || 394 ||  \n|-\n! 6\n| 1 || 12 || 70 || 264 || 714 || 1412 || 1806\n|}\n\nThen the Schröder numbers are the diagonal entries; that is, <math> S_n = T(n,n) </math>, where <math> T(n,k) </math> is the entry of row <math>n</math> and column <math>k</math>. The recurrence relation given by this arrangement is\n: <math>T(n,k) = T(n,k-1) + T(n-1,k-1) + T(n-1,k) </math> \nwith <math>T(1,k)=1</math> and <math>T(n,k)=0</math> for <math>k>n</math>.<ref name=\"A033877\" /> Another interesting observation to make is that the sum of the <math>n</math>th row is the <math>(n+1)</math>st [[Schröder-Hipparchus number| little Schröder number]]; that is,\n:<math>\\sum_{k=0}^n T(n,k) = s_{n+1}</math>.\n\n==Recurrence relation==\n:<math>S_{n} = 3S_{n-1} + \\sum_{k=1}^{n-2}S_{k} S_{n-k-1} </math> for <math>n \\geq 2</math> with <math>S_0 = 1</math>, <math>S_1 = 2</math>.<ref name=\"Schröder number formulas\" />\n\n==Generating function==\nThe [[generating function]] <math>G(x)</math> of <math>(S_n)</math> is\n:<math>G(x) = \\frac{1 - x - \\sqrt{x^2 - 6x + 1}}{2x} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty S_n x^n</math>.<ref name=\"Schröder number formulas\" />\n\n==Uses==\nOne topic of [[combinatorics]] is [[Tessellation|tiling]] shapes, and one particular instance of this is [[domino tiling]]s; the question in this instance is, \"How many dominoes (that is, <math>1 \\times 2 </math> or <math>2 \\times 1 </math> rectangles) can we arrange on some shape such that none of the dominoes overlap, the entire shape is covered, and none of the dominoes stick out of the shape?\" The shape that the Schröder numbers have a connection with is the [[Aztec diamond]].

This is equivalent to the [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]] of 2 in the [[prime factorization]].\nA singly even number can be divided by 2 only once; it is even but its quotient by 2 is odd.\nA doubly even number is an integer that is divisible more than once by 2; it is even and its quotient by 2 is also even.\n\nThe separate consideration of oddly and evenly even numbers is useful in many parts of mathematics, especially in number theory, [[combinatorics]], [[coding theory]] (see [[even code]]s), among others.\n\n==Definitions==\nThe ancient Greek terms \"even-times-even\" and \"even-times-odd\" were given various inequivalent definitions by [[Euclid]] and later writers such as [[Nicomachus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Thirteen Books of Euclid's Elements |author=Euclid; Johan Ludvig Heiberg |year=1908 |publisher=The University Press |pages=281–284 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lxkPAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> Today, there is a standard development of the concepts. The 2-order or 2-adic order is simply a special case of the [[p-adic order|''p''-adic order]] at a general [[prime number]] ''p''; see [[p-adic number|''p''-adic number]] for more on this broad area of mathematics. Many of the following definitions generalize directly to other primes.\n\nFor an integer ''n'', the 2-order of ''n'' (also called ''valuation'') is the largest natural number ν such that 2<sup>ν</sup> [[divides]] ''n''. This definition applies to positive and negative numbers ''n'', although some authors restrict it to positive ''n''; and one may define the 2-order of 0 to be infinity (see also [[parity of zero]]).<ref>{{cite journal |first=Tamas |last=Lengyel |title=Characterizing the 2-adic order of the logarithm |journal=The Fibonacci Quarterly |volume=32 |year=1994 |pages=397–401 |url=http://employees.oxy.edu/lengyel/papers/FQ/pdf/log2.pdf}}</ref> The 2-order of ''n'' is written ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') or ord<sub>2</sub>(''n''). It is not to be confused with the multiplicative [[order (group theory)|order]] [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|modulo 2]].\n\nThe 2-order provides a unified description of various classes of integers defined by evenness:\n*Odd numbers are those with ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') = 0, i.e., integers of the form {{nowrap|2''m'' + 1}}.\n*Even numbers are those with ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') > 0, i.e., integers of the form {{nowrap|2''m''}}. In particular:\n**Singly even numbers are those with ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') = 1, i.e., integers of the form {{nowrap|4''m'' + 2}}.\n**Doubly even numbers are those with ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') > 1, i.e., integers of the form {{nowrap|4''m''}}.\n***In this terminology, a doubly even number may or may not be divisible by 8, so there is no particular terminology for \"triply even\" numbers.\n\nOne can also extend the 2-order to the [[rational numbers]] by defining ν<sub>2</sub>(''q'') to be the unique integer ν where\n:<math>q = 2^\\nu\\frac{a}{b}</math>\nand ''a'' and ''b'' are both odd. For example, [[half-integer]]s have a negative 2-order, namely &minus;1. Finally, by defining the 2-adic norm,\n:<math>|n|_2 = 2^{-\\nu_2(n)},</math>\none is well on the way to constructing the [[p-adic number|2-adic numbers]].\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Safer outs in darts===\nThe object of the game of [[darts]] is to reach a score of 0, so the player with the smaller score is in a better position to win. At the beginning of a leg, \"smaller\" has the usual meaning of [[absolute value]], and the basic strategy is to aim at high-value areas on the dartboard and score as many points as possible. At the end of a leg, since one needs to double out to win, the 2-adic norm becomes the relevant measure. With any odd score no matter how small in absolute value, it takes at least two darts to win. Any even score between 2 and 40 can be satisfied with a single dart, and 40 is a much more desirable score than 2, due to the effects of missing.\n\nA common miss when aiming at the double ring is to hit a single instead and accidentally halve one's score. Given a score of 22 — a singly even number — one has a game shot for double 11. If one hits single 11, the new score is 11, which is odd, and it will take at least two further darts to recover. By contrast, when shooting for double 12, one may make the same mistake but still have 3 game shots in a row: D12, D6, and D3. Generally, with a score of {{nowrap|''n'' < 42}}, one has {{nowrap|ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'')}} such game shots. This is why {{nowrap|1=32 = 2<sup>5</sup>}} is such a desirable score: it splits 5 times.<ref>{{cite book |title=Children Doing Mathematics |author=[[Terezinha Nunes|Nunes, Terezinha]] and Peter Bryant |year=1996 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=0-631-18472-4 |pages=98–99}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Bar Player's Guide to Winning Darts |first=Fred |last=Everson |year=2006 |publisher=Trafford |isbn=1-55369-321-3 |page=39}}</ref>\n\n===Irrationality of {{radic|2}}===\nThe classic proof that the [[square root of 2]] is [[irrational number|irrational]] operates by [[infinite descent]]. Usually, the descent part of the proof is abstracted away by assuming (or proving) the existence of [[irreducible fraction|irreducible]] representations of [[rational number]]s. An alternate approach is to exploit the existence of the ν<sub>2</sub> operator.\n\n[[Assume by contradiction]] that\n\n:<math>\\sqrt2 = a / b,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are non-zero natural numbers. Square both sides of the equality and apply\nthe 2-order valuation operator ν<sub>2</sub> to {{nowrap|1=2''b''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''<sup>2</sup>}}:\n\n:<math>\\nu_2(2b^2) = \\nu_2(a^2)</math>\n:<math>\\nu_2(b^2) + 1 = \\nu_2(a^2)</math>\n:<math>2\\nu_2(b) + 1 = 2\\nu_2(a)</math>\n:<math>\\nu_2(a) - \\nu_2(b) = \\frac12</math>\n\nSince 2-order valuations are integers, the difference cannot be equal to the rational <math>\\frac12</math>. By contradiction, therefore, {{radic|2}} is not a rational. \n\nMore concretely, since the valuation of 2''b''<sup>2</sup> is odd, while valuation of ''a''<sup>2</sup> is even, they must be distinct integers, so that <math>|2 b^2 - a^2| \\geq 1</math>.  An easy calculation then yields a lower bound of <math>\\frac{1}{3b^2}</math> for the difference <math>|\\sqrt2 - a / b|</math>, yielding a direct proof of irrationality not relying on the law of excluded middle.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Moment of Proof: Mathematical Epiphanies |first=Donald C. |last=Benson |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford UP |isbn=0-19-513919-4 |pages=46–47}}</ref>\n\n===Geometric topology===\nIn [[geometric topology]], many properties of manifolds depend only on their dimension mod 4 or mod 8; thus one often studies manifolds of singly even and doubly even dimension (4''k''+2 and 4''k'') as classes. For example, doubly even-dimensional manifolds have a ''symmetric'' [[nondegenerate bilinear form]] on their middle-dimension [[cohomology group]], which thus has an integer-valued [[signature (topology)|signature]]. Conversely, singly even-dimensional manifolds have a [[Skew-symmetric graph|''skew''-symmetric]] nondegenerate bilinear form on their middle dimension; if one defines a [[quadratic refinement]] of this to a [[quadratic form]] (as on a [[framed manifold]]), one obtains the [[Arf invariant]] as a mod 2 invariant. Odd-dimensional manifolds, by contrast, do not have these invariants, though in [[algebraic surgery theory]] one may define more complicated invariants. This 4-fold and 8-fold periodicity in the structure of manifolds is related to the 4-fold periodicity of [[L-theory]] and the 8-fold periodicity of real [[topological K-theory]], which is known as [[Bott periodicity]] – note further that real K-theory is 4-fold periodic [[away from 2]].\n\nIf a [[compact space|compact]] [[oriented manifold|oriented]] [[smooth manifold|smooth]] [[spin manifold]] has dimension {{nowrap|''n'' ≡ 4 mod 8}}, or {{nowrap|1=ν<sub>2</sub>(''n'') = 2}} exactly, then its [[signature (topology)|signature]] is an integer multiple of 16.<ref>Ochanine, Serge, \"Signature modulo 16, invariants de Kervaire généralisés et nombres caractéristiques dans la K-théorie réelle\", Mém. Soc. Math. France 1980/81, no. 5, 142 pp.  {{MathSciNet|id=1809832}}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\n\nA singly even number cannot be a [[powerful number]]. It cannot be represented as a [[difference of two squares]]. However, a singly even number can be represented as the difference of two [[pronic number]]s or of two powerful numbers.<ref group=>* {{cite journal  | author = McDaniel, Wayne L.  | title = Representations of every integer as the difference of powerful numbers  | journal = [[Fibonacci Quarterly]]  | volume = 20  | year = 1982  | pages = 85–87}}</ref>\n\nIn [[group theory]], it is relatively simple<ref>See, for example: {{cite book |title=Elements of mathematics: Algebra I: Chapters 1-3 |author=Bourbaki |publisher=Springer |year=1989 |edition=Softcover reprint of 1974 English translation |isbn=3-540-64243-9 |pages=154–155}}</ref> to show that the order of a [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[finite simple group]] cannot be a singly even number. In fact, by the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]], it cannot be odd either, so every such group has doubly even order.\n\n[[Lambert's continued fraction]] for the [[tangent function]] gives the following [[continued fraction]] involving the positive singly even numbers:<ref>{{cite book |author=Hairer, Ernst and Gerhard Wanner |title=Analysis by Its History |year=1996 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-94551-2 |pages=69–78}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\tanh \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{e - 1}{e + 1} = 0 + \\cfrac{1}{2 + \\cfrac{1}{6 + \\cfrac{1}{10 + \\cfrac{1}{14 + \\cfrac{1}{\\ddots}}}}}</math>\n\nThis expression leads to similar [[List of representations of e|representations of {{math|''e''}}]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to Diophantine Approximations |first=Serge |last=Lang |year=1995 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-94456-7 |pages=69–73}}</ref>\n\nIn [[organic chemistry]], [[Hückel's rule]], also known as the 4n + 2 rule, predicts that a [[cyclic compound|cyclic]] [[pi bond|π-bond]] system containing a singly even number of [[electron configuration|p electron]]s will be [[aromatic]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Organic Chemistry |author=Ouellette, Robert J. and J.

The 2-smooth numbers are just the [[Power of two|powers of 2]], while 5-smooth numbers are known as [[regular number]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nA [[negative and positive numbers|positive]] [[integer]] is called <var>B</var>-'''smooth''' if none of its [[prime factor]]s is greater than <var>B</var>. For example, 1,620 has prime factorization 2<sup>2</sup> × 3<sup>4</sup> × 5; therefore 1,620 is 5-smooth because none of its prime factors are greater than 5. This definition includes numbers that lack some of the smaller prime factors; for example, both 10 and 12 are 5-smooth, even though they miss out the prime factors 3 and 5 respectively. All 5-smooth numbers are of the form 2<sup>a</sup> × 3<sup>b</sup> × 5<sup>c</sup>, where a, b and c are non-negative integers.\n\n5-smooth numbers are also called ''[[regular number]]s'' or ''Hamming numbers''; 7-smooth numbers are also called '''''humble numbers''''', and sometimes called ''highly composite'',<ref>{{Cite OEIS|A002473|name=7-smooth numbers}}</ref> although this conflicts with another meaning of [[highly composite numbers]].\n\nNote that <var>B</var> itself is not required to appear among the factors of a B-smooth number. If the largest prime factor of a number is <var>p</var> then the number is <var>B</var>-smooth for any <var>B</var> ≥ <var>p</var>. Usually <var>B</var> is prime, but [[composite number]]s are permitted as well. A number is <var>B</var>-smooth [[if and only if]] it is <var>p</var>-smooth, where <var>p</var> is the largest prime less than or equal to <var>B</var>.\n\n==Applications==\nAn important practical application of smooth numbers is for [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms (such as the [[Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm]]) that operate by recursively breaking down a problem of a given size ''n'' into problems the size of its factors.  By using ''B''-smooth numbers, one ensures that the base cases of this recursion are small primes, for which efficient algorithms exist.

Such applications are often said to work with \"smooth numbers,\" with no ''B'' specified; this means the numbers involved must be ''B''-powersmooth for some unspecified small number ''B''; as ''B'' increases, the performance of the algorithm or method in question degrades rapidly. For example, the [[Pohlig–Hellman algorithm]] for computing [[discrete logarithm]]s has a running time of [[asymptotic notation|O]](''B''<sup>1/2</sup>) for [[group (mathematics)|group]]s of ''B''-smooth order.\n\n==Smooth over a set A==\nMoreover, ''m'' is said to be smooth over a set '''A''' if there exists a factorization of ''m'' where the factors are powers of elements in '''A'''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Somos sequence''' is a sequence of numbers defined by a certain [[recurrence relation]], described below.  They were discovered by mathematician [[Michael Somos]]. From the form of their defining recurrence (which involves division), one would expect the terms of the sequence to be fractions, but nevertheless many Somos sequences have the property that all of their members are integers.\n\n==Recurrence equations==\nFor an integer number ''k'' larger than 1, the Somos-''k'' sequence <math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots )</math> is defined by the equation\n:<math>a_n a_{n-k} = a_{n-1} a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k+2} + \\cdots + a_{n-(k-1)/2} a_{n-(k+1)/2}</math>\nwhen ''k'' is odd, or by the analogous equation\n:<math>a_n a_{n-k} = a_{n-1} a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k+2} + \\cdots + (a_{n-k/2})^2</math>\nwhen ''k'' is even, together with the initial values\n: ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1 for ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''k''.\n\nFor ''k'' = 2 or 3, these recursions are very simple (there is no addition on the right-hand side) and they define the all-ones sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...).  In the first nontrivial case, ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the defining equation is\n:<math>a_n a_{n-4} = a_{n-1} a_{n-3} + a_{n-2}^2</math>\nwhile for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 the equation is\n:<math>a_n a_{n-5} = a_{n-1} a_{n-4} + a_{n-2} a_{n-3}\\,.</math>\n\nThese equations can be rearranged into the form of a [[recurrence relation]], in which the value ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> on the left hand side of the recurrence is defined by a formula on the right hand side, by dividing the formula by ''a''<sub>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''</sub>. For ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, this yields the recurrence\n:<math>a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-3} + a_{n-2}^2}{a_{n-4}}</math>\nwhile for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;5 it gives the recurrence\n:<math>a_n = \\frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-4} + a_{n-2} a_{n-3}}{a_{n-5}}.</math>\n\nWhile in the usual definition of the Somos sequences, the values of ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i''&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''k'' are all set equal to 1, it is also possible to define other sequences by using the same recurrences with different initial values.\n\n==Sequence values==\nThe values in the Somos-4 sequence are\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 23, 59, 314, 1529, 8209, 83313, 620297, 7869898, ... {{OEIS|A006720}}.\nThe values in the Somos-5 sequence are\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 37, 83, 274, 1217, 6161, 22833, 165713, ... {{OEIS|A006721}}.\nThe values in the Somos-6 sequence are\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 23, 75, 421, 1103, 5047, 41783, 281527, ... {{OEIS|A006722}}.\nThe values in the Somos-7 sequence are\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 41, 137, 769, 1925, 7203, 34081, ... {{OEIS|A006723}}.\n\n==Integrality==\nThe form of the recurrences describing the Somos sequences involves divisions, making it appear likely that the sequences defined by these recurrence will contain fractional values. Nevertheless, for ''k''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;7 the Somos sequences contain only integer values.

      "text": "{{for|squares of triangular numbers|squared triangular number}}\n[[File:TriSquare36.svg|200px|thumb|Square triangular number 36 depicted as a triangular number and as a square number.]]\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''square triangular number''' (or '''triangular square number''') is a number which is both a [[triangular number]] and a [[square number|perfect square]]. There are [[Infinity|infinitely many]] square triangular numbers; the first few are:\n:0, 1, 36, {{val|1225|fmt=gaps}}, {{val|41616}}, {{val|1413721}}, {{val|48024900}}, {{val|1631432881}}, {{val|55420693056}}, {{val|1882672131025}} {{OEIS|id=A001110}}\n\n==Explicit formulas==\n\nWrite {{math|''N''<sub>''k''</sub>}} for the {{mvar|k}}th square triangular number, and write {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>''k''</sub>}} for the sides of the corresponding square and triangle, so that \n:<math>N_k = s_k^2 = \\frac{t_k(t_k+1)}{2}.</math>\nDefine the ''triangular root'' of a triangular number {{math|''N'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''n''(''n'' + 1)|2}}}} to be {{mvar|n}}. From this definition and the quadratic formula,\n:<math>n = \\frac{\\sqrt{8N + 1} - 1}{2}.</math>\nTherefore, {{mvar|N}} is triangular ({{mvar|n}} is an integer) [[if and only if]] {{math|8''N'' + 1}} is square. Consequently, a square number {{math|''M''<sup>2</sup>}} is also triangular if and only if {{math|8''M''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is square, that is, there are numbers {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} such that {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − 8''y''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}. This is an instance of the [[Pell equation]] with {{math|''n'' {{=}} 8}}. All Pell equations have the trivial solution {{math|''x'' {{=}} 1, ''y'' {{=}} 0}} for any {{mvar|n}}; this is called the zeroth solution, and indexed as {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''y''<sub>0</sub>) {{=}} (1,0)}}. If {{math|(''x<sub>k</sub>'', ''y<sub>k</sub>'')}} denotes the {{mvar|k}}th nontrivial solution to any Pell equation for a particular {{mvar|n}}, it can be shown by the method of descent that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_{k+1} &= 2x_k x_1 - x_{k-1}, \\\\\ny_{k+1} &= 2y_k x_1 - y_{k-1}.\n\\end{align}</math>\nHence there are an infinity of solutions to any Pell equation for which there is one non-trivial one, which holds whenever {{mvar|n}} is not a square. The first non-trivial solution when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 8}} is easy to find: it is (3,1). A solution {{math|(''x<sub>k</sub>'', ''y<sub>k</sub>'')}} to the Pell equation for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 8}} yields a square triangular number and its square and triangular roots as follows:\n:<math>s_k = y_k , \\quad t_k = \\frac{x_k - 1}{2}, \\quad N_k = y_k^2.</math>\nHence, the first square triangular number, derived from (3,1), is 1, and the next, derived from {{nowrap|6 × (3,1) − (1,0) {{=}} (17,6)}}, is 36.\n\nThe sequences {{math|''N''<sub>''k''</sub>}}, {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are the [[OEIS]] sequences {{OEIS2C|id=A001110}}, {{OEIS2C|id=A001109}}, and {{OEIS2C|id=A001108}} respectively.\n\nIn 1778 [[Leonhard Euler]] determined the explicit formula<ref name=Dickson>\n{{cite book | last1 = Dickson | first1 = Leonard Eugene | authorlink1 = Leonard Eugene Dickson |title = [[History of the Theory of Numbers]] | volume = 2 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | location = Providence | year = 1999 |origyear = 1920 | page = 16 | isbn = 978-0-8218-1935-7 }}\n</ref><ref name=Euler>\n{{cite journal |last=Euler |first=Leonhard |authorlink=Leonhard Euler |year=1813 |title=Regula facilis problemata Diophantea per numeros integros expedite resolvendi (An easy rule for Diophantine problems which are to be resolved quickly by integral numbers)  |journal=Mémoires de l'Académie des Sciences de St.-Pétersbourg |volume= 4 |pages=3–17 |url=http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/pages/E739.html |language=Latin |accessdate=2009-05-11 |quote=According to the records, it was presented to the St. Petersburg Academy on May 4, 1778.}}\n</ref>{{Rp|12–13}}\n:<math>N_k = \\left( \\frac{\\left(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k - \\left(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k}{4\\sqrt{2}} \\right)^2.\n</math>\nOther equivalent formulas (obtained by expanding this formula) that may be convenient include\n: <math>\\begin{align} \nN_k &= \\tfrac{1}{32} \\left( \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{2k} - \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{2k} \\right)^2 \\\\\n&= \\tfrac{1}{32} \\left( \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{4k}-2 + \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{2} \\right)^{4k} \\right) \\\\\n&= \\tfrac{1}{32} \\left( \\left( 17 + 12\\sqrt{2} \\right)^k -2 + \\left( 17 - 12\\sqrt{2} \\right)^k \\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\nThe corresponding explicit formulas for {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''t''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are:<ref name=Euler />{{Rp|13}}\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ns_k &= \\frac{\\left(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k - \\left(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k}{4\\sqrt{2}}, \\\\\nt_k &= \\frac{\\left(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k + \\left(3 - 2\\sqrt{2}\\right)^k - 2}{4}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Pell's equation==\nThe problem of finding square triangular numbers reduces to [[Pell's equation]] in the following way.<ref>\n{{cite book | last1 = Barbeau | first1 = Edward | title = Pell's Equation | pages = 16–17 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtoFImV5BKMC&pg=PA16 | accessdate = 2009-05-10 |series = Problem Books in Mathematics | publisher = Springer | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-387-95529-2 }}\n</ref>\n\nEvery triangular number is of the form {{math|{{sfrac|''t''(''t'' + 1)|2}}}}.

That is, its [[prime factorization]] has exactly one factor for each prime that appears in it. For example, {{nowrap|1=10 = 2 ⋅ 5}} is square-free, but {{nowrap|1=18 = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 3}} is not, because 18 is divisible by {{nowrap|1=9 = 3<sup>2</sup>}}. The smallest positive square-free numbers are\n\n:1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 39, ... {{OEIS|id=A005117}}\n\n==Square-free factors of integers==\nThe [[radical of an integer]] is its largest square-free factor. An integer is square-free [[if and only if]] it is equal to its radical.\n\nAny arbitrary positive integer {{math|''n''}} can be represented in a unique way as the product of a [[powerful number]] (that is a integer such that is divisible by the square of every prime factor) and a square-free integer, which are [[coprime]]. The square-free factor, called the ''square-free part'' of the number, is the largest square-free divisor {{math|''k''}} of {{math|''n''}} that is coprime with {{math|''n''/''k''}}. The square-free part of an integer may be smaller than the largest square-free divisor.\n\nAny arbitrary positive integer {{math|''n''}} can be represented in a unique way as the product of a [[square]] and a square-free integer :\n:<math> n=m^2 k</math>\nIn this factorization, {{math|''m''}} is the largest divisor of ''{{math|n''}} such that {{math|''m''<sup>2</sup>}} is a divisor of {{math|''n''}}. \n\nIn summary, there are three square-free factors that are naturally associated to every integer: the square-free part, the above factor {{mvar|k}}, and the largest square-free factor. Each is a factor of the next one. All are easily deduced from a [[prime factorization]]: if\n:<math>n=\\prod_{i=1}^h p_i^{e_i}</math>\nis the prime factorization of {{mvar|n}}, where <math>p_1, \\ldots, p_h</math> are distinct prime numbers, then the square-free part is\n:<math>\\prod_{e_i=1} p_i,</math>\nThe square-free factor such the quotient is a square is \n:<math>\\prod_{e_i \\text{ odd}} p_i,</math>\nand the largest square-free factor is \n:<math>\\prod_{i=1}^h p_i.</math>\n\nFor example, if <math>n=75600=2^4\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5^2\\cdot 7,</math> the square-free part is {{math|7}}, the square-free factor such that the quotient is a square is {{math|1=3 ⋅ 7 = 21}}, and the largest square-free factor is {{math|1=2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 5 ⋅ 7 = 210}}.\n\nNo algorithm is known for computing any of these square-free factors, which is faster than computing the complete prime factorization.

Master thesis, Simon Fraser University, Canada (2009)</ref>\n\n==Equivalent characterizations==\nA positive integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if in the [[canonical representation of a positive integer|prime factorization]] of ''n'', no prime factor occurs with an exponent larger than one. Another way of stating the same is that for every prime [[divisor|factor]] ''p'' of ''n'', the prime ''p'' does not evenly divide&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''p''. Also ''n'' is square-free if and only if in every factorization ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''ab'', the factors ''a'' and ''b'' are [[coprime]].  An immediate result of this definition is that all prime numbers are square-free.\n\nA positive integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if all [[abelian group]]s of [[order (group theory)|order]] ''n'' are [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]], which is the case if and only if any such group is [[cyclic group|cyclic]]. This follows from the classification of [[finitely generated abelian group]]s.\n\nA integer ''n'' is square-free if and only if the [[factor ring]] '''Z'''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''n'''''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) is a [[product of rings|product]] of [[field (mathematics)|field]]s. This follows from the [[Chinese remainder theorem]] and the fact that a ring of the form '''Z'''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''k'''''Z''' is a field if and only if ''k'' is a prime.\n\nFor every positive integer ''n'', the set of all positive divisors of ''n'' becomes a [[partially ordered set]] if we use [[divisor|divisibility]] as the order relation. This partially ordered set is always a [[distributive lattice]]. It is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] if and only if ''n'' is square-free.\n\nA positive integer ''n'' is square-free [[if and only if]] ''&mu;''(''n'')&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0, where ''μ'' denotes the [[Möbius function]].\n\n==Dirichlet series==\nThe absolute value of the Möbius function is the [[indicator function]] for the square-free integers &ndash; that is, {{math|{{mabs|''&mu;''(''n'')}}}} is equal to 1 if {{mvar|n}} is square-free, and 0 if it is not.  The [[Dirichlet series]] of this indicator function is\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{|\\mu(n)|}{n^{s}} = \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(2s)},</math>\nwhere {{math|''&zeta;''(''s'')}} is the [[Riemann zeta function]].  This follows from the [[Euler product]]\n:<math>  \\frac{\\zeta(s)}{\\zeta(2s) } =\\prod_p \\frac{(1-p^{-2s})}{(1-p^{-s})}=\\prod_p (1+p^{-s}), </math>\nwhere the products are taken over the prime numbers.\n\n==Distribution==\nLet ''Q''(''x'') denote the number of square-free integers between 1 and ''x'' ({{OEIS2C|A013928}} shifting index by 1). For large ''n'', 3/4 of the positive integers less than ''n'' are not divisible by 4, 8/9 of these numbers are not divisible by 9, and so on. Because these ratios satisfy the [[multiplicative function|multiplicative property]] (this follows from [[Chinese remainder theorem]]), we obtain the approximation:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}Q(x) &\\approx x\\prod_{p\\ \\text{prime}} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{p^2}\\right) = x\\prod_{p\\ \\text{prime}} \\frac{1}{(1-\\frac{1}{p^2})^{-1}}\\\\\n&\\approx x\\prod_{p\\ \\text{prime}} \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{p^2}+\\frac{1}{p^4}+\\cdots} = \\frac{x}{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{k^2}} = \\frac{x}{\\zeta(2)} = \\frac{6x}{\\pi^2}.\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis argument can be made rigorous for getting the estimate  (using [[big O notation]])\n\n:<math>Q(x) =  \\frac{6x}{\\pi^2} + O\\left(\\sqrt{x}\\right).</math>\n\n''Sketch of a proof:'' the above characterization gives\n:<math>Q(x)=\\sum_{n\\leq x} \\sum_{d^2\\mid n} \\mu(d)=\\sum_{d\\leq x} \\mu(d)\\sum_{n\\leq x, d^2\\mid n}1=\\sum_{d\\leq x} \\mu(d)\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{d^2}\\right\\rfloor;</math>\nobserving that the last summand is zero for <math>d>\\sqrt{x}</math>, it results that\n:<math>\\begin{align}Q(x)&=\\sum_{d\\leq\\sqrt{x}} \\mu(d)\\left\\lfloor\\frac{x}{d^2}\\right\\rfloor\n=\\sum_{d\\leq\\sqrt{x}} \\frac{x\\mu(d)}{d^2}+O(\\sum_{d\\leq\\sqrt{x}} 1)\n=x\\sum_{d\\leq\\sqrt{x}} \\frac{\\mu(d)}{d^2}+O(\\sqrt{x})\\\\\n&=x\\sum_{d} \\frac{\\mu(d)}{d^2}+O\\left(x\\sum_{d>\\sqrt{x}}\\frac{1}{d^2}+\\sqrt{x}\\right)\n=\\frac{x}{\\zeta(2)}+O(\\sqrt{x}).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy exploiting the largest known zero-free region of the Riemann zeta function [[Arnold Walfisz]] improved the approximation to<ref>A.

From {{harvtxt|Gulley|2010}}.]]\n\nIn [[number theory]], the sum of the first {{mvar|n}} [[Cube (algebra)|cube]]s is the [[Square number|square]] of the {{mvar|n}}th [[triangular number]]. That is,\n:<math>1^3+2^3+3^3+\\cdots+n^3 = \\left(1+2+3+\\cdots+n\\right)^2.</math>\nThe same equation may be written more compactly using the mathematical notation for [[summation]]:\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \\bigg(\\sum_{k=1}^n k\\bigg)^2.</math>\n\nThis [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] is sometimes called '''Nicomachus's theorem''', after [[Nicomachus|Nicomachus of Gerasa]] (c. 60 – c. 120 CE).\n\n==History==\nMany early mathematicians have studied and provided proofs of Nicomachus's theorem. {{harvtxt|Stroeker|1995}} claims that \"every student of number theory surely must have marveled at this miraculous fact\". {{harvtxt|Pengelley|2002}} finds references to the identity not only in the works of [[Nicomachus]] in what is now [[Jordan]] in the first century CE, but also in those of [[Aryabhata]] in [[India]] in the fifth century, and in those of [[Al-Karaji]] circa 1000 in [[Persia]]. {{harvtxt|Bressoud|2004}} mentions several additional early mathematical works on this formula, by [[Alchabitius]] (tenth century Arabia), [[Gersonides]] (circa 1300 France), and [[Nilakantha Somayaji]] (circa 1500 India); he reproduces Nilakantha's visual proof.\n\n==Numeric values;  geometric and probabilistic interpretation==\nThe sequence of squared triangular numbers is\n:{{math|[[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[100 (number)|100]], 225,}} {{math|441, 784, 1296, 2025, 3025, 4356, 6084, 8281,}} ... {{OEIS|id=A000537}}.\n\nThese numbers can be viewed as [[figurate number]]s, a four-dimensional hyperpyramidal generalization of the [[triangular number]]s and [[square pyramidal number]]s.\n\nAs {{harvtxt|Stein|1971}} observes, these numbers also count the number of rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides formed in an {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} [[Square lattice|grid]]. For instance, the points of a {{math|4 &times; 4}} grid (or a square made up of three smaller squares on a side) can form 36 different rectangles. The number of squares in a square grid is similarly counted by the square pyramidal numbers.\n\nThe identity also admits a natural probabilistic interpretation as follows. Let {{math|''X'', ''Y'', ''Z'', ''W''}} be four integer numbers independently and uniformly chosen at random between {{math|1}} and {{mvar|n}}. Then, the probability that {{mvar|W}} be the largest of the four numbers is equal to the probability that both {{mvar|Y}} is at least as large as {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|W}} is at least as large as {{mvar|Z}}, that is, {{math|1='''P'''({max(''X'',''Y'',''Z'') ≤ ''W''}) = '''P'''({''X'' ≤ ''Y''} ∩ {''Z'' ≤ ''W''})}}.

      "title": "Stanley sequence",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_sequence",
      "text": "In mathematics, a '''Stanley sequence''' is an [[integer sequence]] generated by a [[greedy algorithm]] that chooses the sequence members to avoid [[arithmetic progression]]s. If <math>S</math> is a finite set of non-negative integers on which no three elements form an arithmetic progression (that is, a [[Salem–Spencer set]]), then the Stanley sequence generated from <math>S</math> starts from the elements of <math>S</math>, in sorted order, and then repeatedly chooses each successive element of the sequence to be a number that is larger than the already-chosen numbers and does not form any three-term arithmetic progression with them.\nThese sequences are named after [[Richard P. Stanley]].\n\n==Binary–ternary sequence==\nThe Stanley sequence starting from the empty set consists of those numbers whose [[ternary number|ternary representations]] have only the digits 0 and 1.{{r|os}} That is, when written in ternary, they look like [[binary number]]s. These numbers are\n:0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 27, 28, 30, 31, 36, 37, 39, 40, ... {{OEIS|A005836}}\n\nBy their construction as a Stanley sequence, this sequence is the [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] first [[Salem–Spencer set|arithmetic-progression-free sequence]]. Its elements are the sums of distinct powers of three, the numbers <math>n</math> such that the <math>n</math>th central binomial coefficient is 1 mod 3, and the numbers whose [[balanced ternary]] representation is the same as their ternary representation.<ref>{{cite OEIS|A005836}}</ref>\n\nThe construction of this sequence from the ternary numbers is analogous to the construction of the [[Moser–de Bruijn sequence]], the sequence of numbers whose base-4 representations have only the digits 0 and 1, and the construction of the [[Cantor set]] as the subset of real numbers in the interval <math>[0,1]</math> whose ternary representations use only the digits 0 and 2. More generally, they are a [[k-regular sequence|2-regular sequence]], one of a class of integer sequences defined by a linear [[recurrence relation]] with multiplier 2.{{r|as}}\n\n==Growth rate==\n[[Andrew Odlyzko]] and [[Richard P. Stanley]] observed that the number of elements up to some threshold <math>n</math> in the binary–ternary sequence, and in other Stanley sequences starting from <math>\\{0,3^k\\}</math> or <math>\\{0,2\\cdot 3^k\\}</math>, grows proportionally to <math>n^{\\log_2 3}\\approx n^{0.631}</math>. For other starting sets <math>\\{0,s\\}</math> the Stanley sequences that they considered appeared to grow more erratically but even more sparsely.{{r|os}} For instance, the first irregular case is <math>s=4</math>, which generates the sequence\n:0, 4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 16, 23, 26, 31, 33, 37, 38, 44, 49, 56, 73, 78, 80, 85, 95, 99,  ... {{OEIS|A005487}}\nOdlyzko and Stanley conjectured that in such cases the number of elements up to any threshold <math>n</math> is <math>O\\bigl(\\sqrt{n\\log n}\\bigr)</math>. That is, there is a dichotomy in the growth rate of Stanley sequences between the ones with similar growth to the binary–ternary sequence and others with a much smaller growth rate; according to this conjecture, there should be no Stanley sequences with intermediate growth.{{r|os|elrss}}\n\nMoy proved that Stanley sequences cannot grow significantly more slowly than the conjectured bound for the sequences of slow growth. Every Stanley sequence has <math>\\Omega\\bigl(\\sqrt{n}\\bigr)</math> elements up to <math>n</math>. More precisely Moy showed that, for every such sequence, every <math>\\varepsilon>0</math>, and all sufficiently large <math>n</math>, the number of elements is at least <math>(\\sqrt 2 - \\varepsilon)\\sqrt n</math>.{{r|m}} \nLater authors improved the constant factor in this bound,{{r|dc}}\nand proved that for Stanley sequences that grow as <math>n^{\\log_2 3}</math> the constant factor in their growth rates can be any rational number whose denominator is a power of three.{{r|rv}}\n\n==History==\nA variation of the binary–ternary sequence (with one added to each element)\nwas considered in 1936 by [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Pál Turán]], who observed that it has no three-term arithmetic progression and conjectured (incorrectly) that it was the densest possible sequence with no arithmetic progression.{{r|et}}\n\nIn unpublished work with [[Andrew Odlyzko]] in 1978, [[Richard P. Stanley]] experimented with the greedy algorithm to generate progression-free sequences.\nThe sequences they studied were exactly the Stanley sequences for the initial sets <math>\\{0,s\\}</math>.{{r|os}}\n\nStanley sequences were named, and generalized to other starting sets than <math>\\{0,s\\}</math>, in a paper published in 1999 by Erdős (posthumously) with four other authors.{{r|elrss}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=as>{{citation\n | last1 = Allouche | first1 = Jean-Paul\n | last2 = Shallit | first2 = Jeffrey | author2-link = Jeffrey Shallit\n | citeseerx = 10.1.1.8.6912\n | doi = 10.1016/0304-3975(92)90001-V\n | issue = 2\n | journal = [[Theoretical Computer Science (journal)|Theoretical Computer Science]]\n | mr = 1166363\n | pages = 163–197\n | title = The ring of <math>k</math>-regular sequences\n | volume = 98\n | year = 1992}}.

For example, the number [[6 (number)|6]] is written as \"110\" in [[Binary numeral system|base 2]], \"20\" in [[ternary numeral system|base 3]] and \"12\" in [[quaternary numeral system|base 4]], none of which is a palindrome—so 6 is strictly non-palindromic.\n\nFor another example, the number [[19 (number)|19]] written in base ''b'' (2 ≤ ''b'' ≤ 17) is:\n: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n|''b''\n|2||3||4||5||6||7||8||9||10||11||12||13||14||15||16||17\n|-\n|19 in base ''b''\n||10011||201||103||34||31||25||23||21||19||18||17||16||15||14||13||12\n|}\nNone of these are a palindrome, so 19 is a strictly non-palindromic number.\n\nThe sequence of strictly non-palindromic numbers {{OEIS|id=A016038}} starts:\n\n: [[0 (number)|0]], [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[19 (number)|19]], [[47 (number)|47]], [[53 (number)|53]], [[79 (number)|79]], [[103 (number)|103]], [[137 (number)|137]], [[139 (number)|139]], [[149 (number)|149]], [[163 (number)|163]], [[167 (number)|167]], [[179 (number)|179]], [[223 (number)|223]], [[263 (number)|263]], [[269 (number)|269]], [[283 (number)|283]], [[293 (number)|293]], 311, 317, 347, 359, 367, 389, 439, 491, 563, 569, 593, 607, 659, 739, 827, 853, 877, 977, 983, 997, ...\n\nTo test whether a number ''n'' is strictly non-palindromic, it must be verified that ''n'' is non-palindromic in all bases up to ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2. The reasons for this upper limit are:\n* any ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3 is written \"11\" in base ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1, so ''n'' is palindromic in base ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1;\n* any ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2 is written \"10\" in base ''n'', so any ''n'' is non-palindromic in base ''n'';\n* any ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1 is a single-digit number in any base ''b''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''n'', so any ''n'' is palindromic in all such bases.\n\nFor example, 19 will be written (if ''b'' > 17) as:\n\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''b''\n|18\n|19\n|above 19\n|-\n|19 in base ''b''\n|11\n|10\n|a single-digit number\n|}\n\nThus it can be seen that the upper limit of ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;2 is necessary to obtain a mathematically \"interesting\" definition.\n\nFor ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;4 the range of bases is empty, so these numbers are strictly non-palindromic in a trivial way.\n\n==Properties==\n{{unsourced|section|date=April 2019}}\n{{tone|section|date=April 2019}}\nAll strictly non-palindromic numbers beyond 6 are [[prime number|prime]]. To see why [[composite number|composite]] ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;6 cannot be strictly non-palindromic, for each such ''n'' a base ''b'' can be shown to exist where ''n'' is palindromic.\n* If ''n'' is [[even and odd numbers|even]], then ''n'' is written \"22\" (a palindrome) in base ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''/2&nbsp;&−&nbsp;1 (''n''/2&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 > 2, since ''n'' > 6).\nOtherwise ''n'' is [[even and odd numbers|odd]]. Write ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&thinsp;·&thinsp;''m'', where ''p'' is the smallest prime factor of ''n''. Then clearly ''p''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''m'' (since ''n'' is composite).\n* If ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, then ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;9 is written \"1001\" (a palindrome) in base ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.\n* If ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3, then ''n'' is written \"121\" (a palindrome) in base ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 (''p''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 > 2, since ''p'' > 3).\nOtherwise ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1. The case ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 cannot occur because both ''p'' and ''m'' are odd.\n* Then ''n'' is written \"''pp''\" (the two-digit number with each digit equal to ''p'', a palindrome) in base ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 (since ''p''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1).\nThe reader can easily verify that in each case (1) the base ''b'' is in the range 2&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;2, and (2) the digits ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> of each palindrome are in the range 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'', given that ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;6. These conditions may fail if ''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;6, which explains why the non-prime numbers 1, 4 and 6 are strictly non-palindromic nevertheless.\n\nTherefore, all strictly non-palindromic ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;6 are prime.\n\n==References==\n* Sequence [[OEIS:A016038|A016038]] from the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]]\n\n{{Classes of natural numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Palindromes]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''superabundant number''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''SA''') is a certain kind of [[natural number]]. A natural number ''n'' is called superabundant precisely when, for all ''m'' &lt; ''n''\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\sigma(m)}{m} < \\frac{\\sigma(n)}{n}</math>\n\nwhere ''σ'' denotes the [[divisor function|sum-of-divisors function]] (i.e., the sum of all positive divisors of ''n'', including ''n'' itself). The first few superabundant numbers are [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[48 (number)|48]], [[60 (number)|60]], [[120 (number)|120]], ... {{OEIS|id=A004394}}. For example, the number 5 is not a superabundant number because for 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the sigma is 1, 3, 4, 7, 6, and 7/4 > 6/5.\n\nSuperabundant numbers were defined by {{harvs|first1=Leonidas|last1=Alaoglu|author1-link=Leonidas Alaoglu|first2=Paul|last2=Erdős|author2-link=Paul Erdős|year=1944|txt=yes}}. Unknown to Alaoglu and Erdős, about 30 pages of Ramanujan's 1915 paper \"Highly Composite Numbers\" were suppressed.  Those pages were finally published in The Ramanujan Journal 1 (1997), 119–153.  In section 59 of that paper, Ramanujan defines generalized [[highly composite number]]s, which include the superabundant numbers.\n\n== Properties ==\n{{Euler_diagram_numbers_with_many_divisors.svg}}\n{{harvs|first1=Leonidas|last1=Alaoglu|author1-link=Leonidas Alaoglu|first2=Paul|last2=Erdős|author2-link=Paul Erdős|year=1944|txt=yes}} proved that if ''n'' is superabundant, then there exist a ''k'' and ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> such that\n\n:<math>n=\\prod_{i=1}^k (p_i)^{a_i}</math>\n\nwhere ''p''<sub>i</sub> is the ''i''-th prime number, and\n\n:<math>a_1\\geq a_2\\geq\\dotsb\\geq a_k\\geq 1.</math>\n\nThat is, they proved that if ''n'' is superabundant, the prime decomposition of ''n'' has non-increasing exponents (the exponent of a larger prime is never more than that a smaller prime) and that all primes up to <math>p_k</math> are factors of ''n''.  Then in particular any superabundant number is an even integer, and it is a multiple of the ''k''-th [[primorial]] <math>p_k\\#.</math>\n\nIn fact, the last exponent ''a''<sub>''k''</sub> is equal to 1 except when n is 4 or 36.\n\nSuperabundant numbers are closely related to [[highly composite number]]s. Not all superabundant numbers are highly composite numbers. In fact, only 449 superabundant and highly composite numbers are the same {{OEIS|id=A166981}}. For instance, 7560 is highly composite but not superabundant. Conversely, 1163962800 is superabundant but not highly composite.\n\nAlaoglu and Erdős observed that all superabundant numbers are [[highly abundant number|highly abundant]]. \n\nNot all superabundant numbers are [[Harshad number]]s. The first exception is the 105th SA number, 149602080797769600.  The digit sum is 81, but 81 does not divide evenly into this SA number.\n\nSuperabundant numbers are also of interest in connection with the [[Riemann hypothesis]], and with [[Robin's theorem]] that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that\n:<math>\\frac{\\sigma(n)}{e^\\gamma n\\log\\log n} < 1</math>\nfor all ''n'' greater than the largest known exception, the superabundant number 5040.

Squares with side lengths 1/1807 or smaller are too small to see in the figure and are not shown.]]\nIn [[number theory]], '''Sylvester's sequence''' is an [[integer sequence]] in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members, plus one. The first few terms of the sequence are:\n:2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, 10650056950807, 113423713055421844361000443 {{OEIS|id=A000058}}.\n\nSylvester's sequence is named after [[James Joseph Sylvester]], who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow [[Double exponential function|doubly exponentially]], and the sum of its [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]]s forms a [[Series (mathematics)|series]] of [[unit fraction]]s that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms. The [[recurrence relation|recurrence]] by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be [[integer factorization|factored]] more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete [[prime factor]]izations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite [[Egyptian fraction]] representations of 1, [[Sasakian manifold|Sasakian]] [[Einstein manifold]]s, and hard instances for [[online algorithm]]s.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nFormally, Sylvester's sequence can be defined by the formula\n:<math>s_n = 1 + \\prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} s_i.</math>\nThe [[empty product|product of an empty set]] is 1, so ''s''<sub>0</sub> = 2.\n\nAlternatively, one may define the sequence by the [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]\n:<math>\\displaystyle s_i = s_{i-1}(s_{i-1}-1)+1,</math> with ''s''<sub>0</sub> = 2.\nIt is straightforward to show by induction that this is equivalent to the other definition.\n\n== Closed form formula and asymptotics ==\nThe Sylvester numbers grow [[double exponential function|doubly exponentially]] as a function of ''n''. Specifically, it can be shown that\n\n:<math>s_n = \\left\\lfloor E^{2^{n+1}}+\\frac12 \\right\\rfloor,</math>\n\nfor a number ''E'' that is approximately 1.26408473530530...<ref>{{harvtxt|Graham|Knuth|Patashnik|1989}} set this as an exercise; see also {{harvtxt|Golomb|1963}}.</ref> This formula has the effect of the following [[algorithm]]:\n:s<sub>0</sub> is the nearest integer to E<sup>2</sup>; s<sub>1</sub> is the nearest integer to E<sup>4</sup>; s<sub>2</sub> is the nearest integer to E<sup>8</sup>; for  s<sub>''n''</sub>, take E<sup>2</sup>, square it ''n'' more times, and take the nearest integer.\nThis would only be a practical algorithm if we had a better way of calculating E to the requisite number of places than calculating s<sub>''n''</sub> and taking its repeated square root.\n\nThe double-exponential growth of the Sylvester sequence is unsurprising if one compares it to the sequence of [[Fermat number]]s ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>; the Fermat numbers are usually defined by a doubly exponential formula, <math>2^{2^n}+1</math>, but they can also be defined by a product formula very similar to that defining Sylvester's sequence:\n\n:<math>F_n = 2 + \\prod_{i = 0}^{n - 1} F_i.</math>\n\n== Connection with Egyptian fractions ==\nThe [[unit fraction]]s formed by the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of the values in Sylvester's sequence generate an [[Series (mathematics)|infinite series]]:\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac1{s_i} = \\frac12 + \\frac13 + \\frac17 + \\frac1{43} + \\frac1{1807} + \\cdots.</math>\nThe partial sums of this series have a simple form,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} \\frac1{s_i} = 1 - \\frac{1}{s_j-1} = \\frac{s_j-2}{s_j-1}.</math>\nThis may be proved by induction, or more directly by noting that the recursion implies that\n:<math>\\frac{1}{s_i-1}-\\frac{1}{s_{i+1}-1}=\\frac{1}{s_i},</math>\nso the sum [[Telescoping series|telescopes]]\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} \\frac{1}{s_i} = \\sum_{i=0}^{j-1} \\left( \\frac{1}{s_i-1}-\\frac{1}{s_{i+1}-1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{s_0-1} - \\frac{1}{s_j-1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{s_j-1}.</math>\nSince this sequence of partial sums (''s''<sub>''j''</sub>-2)/(''s''<sub>''j''</sub>-1) converges to one, the overall series forms an infinite [[Egyptian fraction]] representation of the number one:\n:<math>1 = \\frac12 + \\frac13 + \\frac17 + \\frac1{43} + \\frac1{1807} + \\cdots.</math>\nOne can find finite Egyptian fraction representations of one, of any length, by truncating this series and subtracting one from the last denominator:\n:<math>1 = \\tfrac12 + \\tfrac13 + \\tfrac16, \\quad 1 = \\tfrac12 + \\tfrac13 + \\tfrac17 + \\tfrac1{42}, \\quad 1 = \\tfrac12 + \\tfrac13 + \\tfrac17 + \\tfrac1{43} + \\tfrac1{1806},\\quad \\dots.</math>\nThe sum of the first ''k'' terms of the infinite series provides the closest possible underestimate of 1 by any ''k''-term Egyptian fraction.<ref>This claim is commonly attributed to {{harvtxt|Curtiss|1922}}, but {{harvtxt|Miller|1919}} appears to be making the same statement in an earlier paper. See also {{harvtxt|Rosenman|Underwood|1933}}, {{harvtxt|Salzer|1947}}, and {{harvtxt|Soundararajan|2005}}.</ref> For example, the first four terms add to 1805/1806, and therefore any Egyptian fraction for a number in the open interval (1805/1806,1) requires at least five terms.\n\nIt is possible to interpret the Sylvester sequence as the result of a [[greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions]], that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first can be viewed as the denominators of the [[odd greedy expansion]] of 1/2.\n\n== Uniqueness of quickly growing series with rational sums ==\nAs Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's sequence seems to be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth is not enough to cause an integer sequence to be an [[irrationality sequence]].{{sfnp|Guy|2004}}\n\nTo make this more precise, it follows from results of {{harvtxt|Badea|1993}} that, if a sequence of integers <math>a_n</math> grows quickly enough that\n:<math>a_n\\ge a_{n-1}^2-a_{n-1}+1,</math>\nand if the series\n:<math>A=\\sum\\frac1{a_i}</math>\nconverges to a rational number ''A'', then, for all  ''n'' after some point, this sequence must be defined by the same recurrence\n:<math>a_n= a_{n-1}^2-a_{n-1}+1</math>\nthat can be used to define Sylvester's sequence.\n\n{{harvtxt|Erdős|Graham|1980}} [[Erdős conjecture|conjectured]] that, in results of this type, the inequality bounding the growth of the sequence could be replaced by a weaker condition,\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty} \\frac{a_n}{a_{n-1}^2}=1.</math>\n{{harvtxt|Badea|1995}} surveys progress related to this conjecture; see also {{harvtxt|Brown|1979}}.\n\n== Divisibility and factorizations ==\nIf ''i'' < ''j'', it follows from the definition that ''s''<sub>''j''</sub> ≡ 1 (mod ''s''<sub>''i''</sub>). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's sequence are [[relatively prime]]. The sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).{{sfnp|Guy|Nowakowski|1975}}\n\n{{unsolved|mathematics|Are all the terms in Sylvester's sequence squarefree?}}\nMuch remains unknown about the factorization of the numbers in the Sylvester's sequence. For instance, it is not known if all numbers in the sequence are [[Square-free integer|squarefree]], although all the known terms are.\n\nAs {{harvtxt|Vardi|1991}} describes, it is easy to determine which Sylvester number (if any) a given prime ''p'' divides: simply compute the recurrence defining the numbers modulo ''p'' until finding either a number that is congruent to zero (mod ''p'') or finding a repeated modulus.  Via this technique he found that 1166 out of the first three million primes are divisors of Sylvester numbers,<ref>This appears to be a typo, as Andersen finds 1167 prime divisors in this range.</ref> and that none of these primes has a square that divides a Sylvester number. \nThe set of primes which can occur as factors of Sylvester numbers is of density zero in the set of all primes:{{sfnp|Jones|2006}} indeed, the number of such primes less than ''x'' is <math>O(\\pi(x) / \\log\\log\\log x)</math>.{{sfnp|Odoni|1985}}\n\nThe following table shows known factorizations of these numbers, (except the first four, which are all prime):<ref>All prime factors ''p'' of Sylvester numbers ''s''<sub>''n''</sub> with ''p'' &lt; 5{{e|7}} and ''n'' ≤ 200 are listed by Vardi.

They show that the number of distinct Sasakian Einstein [[Riemannian metric|metrics]] on a [[topological sphere]] of dimension 2''n'' &minus; 1 is at least proportional to ''s''<sub>''n''</sub> and hence has double exponential growth with ''n''.\n\nAs {{harvtxt|Galambos|Woeginger|1995}} describe, {{harvtxt|Brown|1979}} and {{harvtxt|Liang|1980}} used values derived from Sylvester's sequence to construct lower bound examples for [[online algorithm|online]] [[bin packing]] [[algorithm]]s. {{harvtxt|Seiden|Woeginger|2005}} similarly use the sequence to lower bound the performance of a two-dimensional cutting stock algorithm.<ref>In their work, Seiden and Woeginger refer to Sylvester's sequence as \"Salzer's sequence\" after the work of {{harvtxt|Salzer|1947}} on closest approximation.</ref>\n\n[[Znám's problem]] concerns sets of numbers such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product of all the other numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence.

(If the base ''b'' is congruent to 1 modulo 3, then all Thabit numbers of the second kind base ''b'' are divisible by 3 (and greater than 3, since ''b'' ≥ 2), so there are no Thabit primes of the second kind base ''b''.)\n\nThe exponent of Thabit primes of the second kind cannot congruent to 1 mod 3 (except 1 itself), the exponent of Williams primes of the first kind cannot congruent to 4 mod 6, and the exponent of Williams primes of the second kind cannot congruent to 1 mod 6 (except 1 itself), since the corresponding polynomial to ''b'' is a [[reducible polynomial]].

The {{math|''n''}}th triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with {{math|''n''}} dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the {{math|''n''}} [[natural number]]s from 1 to {{math|''n''}}. The sequence of triangular numbers {{OEIS|id=A000217}}, starting at the [[empty sum|0th triangular number]], is\n:0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666...\n\n==Formula==\n{{Pascal_triangle_simplex_numbers.svg||triangular numbers}}\nThe triangle numbers are given by the following explicit formulas:\n:<!-- THE END OF THE NEXT LINE HAS BINOMIAL NOTATION. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR. --><math> T_n= \\sum_{k=1}^n k = 1+2+3+ \\dotsb +n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = {n+1 \\choose 2} ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\textstyle {n+1 \\choose 2}</math> is a [[binomial coefficient]]. It represents the number of distinct pairs that can be selected from {{math|''n'' + 1}} objects, and it is read aloud as \"{{math|''n''}} plus one choose two\".\n\nThe first equation can be illustrated using a [[proof without words|visual proof]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/triangular-numbers.html|title=Triangular Number Sequence|website=Math Is Fun}}</ref> For every triangular number <math>T_n</math>, imagine a \"half-square\" arrangement of objects corresponding to the triangular number, as in the figure below.  Copying this arrangement and rotating it to create a rectangular figure doubles the number of objects, producing a rectangle with dimensions <math>n \\times (n+1)</math>, which is also the number of objects in the rectangle.  Clearly, the triangular number itself is always exactly half of the number of objects in such a figure, or: <math>T_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} </math>.  The example <math>T_4</math> follows:\n\n{|cellpadding=\"7\"\n|<math> 2T_4 = 4(4+1) = 20 </math> (green plus yellow) implies that <math>T_4 = \\frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10 </math> (green).\n|[[File:Illustration of Triangular Number T 4 Leading to a Rectangle.png]]\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|}\n\nThe first equation can also be established using [[mathematical induction]].<ref>Andrews, George E.  ''Number Theory'', Dover, New York, 1971. pp. 3-4.</ref>  Since the sum of the first (one) natural number(s) is clearly equal to one, a basis case is established.  Assuming the inductive hypothesis for some <math>n</math> and adding <math>n+1</math> to both sides immediately gives\n\n:<math> \\sum_{k=1}^{n} k + (n+1) = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) \\rightarrow \\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k = \\frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2} </math>\n\nIn other words, since the [[proposition]] <math>P(n)</math> (that is, the first equation, or inductive hypothesis itself) is true when <math>n=1</math>, and since <math>P(n)</math> being true implies that <math>P(n+1)</math> is also true, then the first equation is true for all natural numbers.  The above argument can be easily modified to start with, and include, zero.\n\n[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is said to have found this relationship in his early youth, by multiplying {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}} pairs of numbers in the sum by the values of each pair {{math|''n'' + 1}}.<ref name=Gauss>{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Brian|title=Gauss's Day of Reckoning|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning/1|work=American Scientist|publisher=Computing Science|accessdate=2014-04-16}}</ref> However, regardless of the truth of this story, Gauss was not the first to discover this formula, and some find it likely that its origin goes back to the [[Pythagoreans]] 5th century BC.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eves|first1=Howard|title=Webpage cites AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.98/matt1.html|publisher=Mathcentral|accessdate=28 March 2015}}</ref> The two formulae were described by the Irish monk [[Dicuil]] in about 816 in his [[Computus]].<ref>Esposito,M.

In other words, the solution to the handshake problem of {{math|''n''}} people is {{math|''T''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}}.<ref>http://www.mathcircles.org/node/835</ref> The function {{math|''T''}} is the additive analog of the [[factorial]] function, which is the ''products'' of integers from 1 to&nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.\n\nThe number of line segments between closest pairs of dots in the triangle can be represented in terms of the number of dots or with a [[recurrence relation]]:\n:<math>L_n = 3 T_{n-1}= 3{n \\choose 2};~~~L_n = L_{n-1} + 3(n-1), ~L_1 = 0.</math>\n\nIn the limit, the ratio between the two numbers, dots and line segments is\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{T_n}{L_n} = \\frac{1}{3}.</math>\n\n==Relations to other figurate numbers==\nTriangular numbers have a wide variety of relations to other [[figurate number]]s.\n\nMost simply, the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is a [[square number]], with the sum being the square of the difference between the two (and thus the difference of the two being the square root of the sum). Algebraically,\n:<math>T_n + T_{n-1} = \\left (\\frac{n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\left(n-1\\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right ) = \\left (\\frac{n^2}{2} + \\frac{n}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{n^2}{2} - \\frac{n}{2} \\right ) = n^2 = (T_n - T_{n-1})^2.</math>\n\nThis fact can be demonstrated graphically by positioning the triangles in opposite directions to create a square:\n{| cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"display: inline-block; height: 150px; margin-top: -10px;\"\n|style=\"height: 150px;\"|6 + 10 = 16\n|style=\"height: 150px;\"|[[File:Square number 16 as sum of two triangular numbers.svg]]\n|style=\"height: 150px;\"|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"6\" style=\"display: inline-block; height: 150px; margin-top: -10px;\"\n|style=\"height: 150px;\"|10 + 15 = 25\n|style=\"height: 150px;\"|[[File:Square number 25 as sum of two triangular numbers.svg]]\n|}\n\nThere are infinitely many triangular numbers that are also square numbers; e.g., 1, 36, 1225. Some of them can be generated by a simple recursive formula:\n:<math>S_{n+1} = 4S_n \\left( 8S_n + 1\\right)</math> with <math>S_1 = 1.</math>\n\n''All'' [[square triangular number]]s are found from the recursion\n:<math>S_n = 34S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} + 2</math> with <math>S_0 = 0</math> and <math>S_1 = 1.</math>\n\n[[File:Nicomachus_theorem_3D.svg|thumb|A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. This shows that the square of the {{math|''n''}}th triangular number is equal to the sum of the first {{math|''n''}} [[Cube (algebra)|cube numbers]].]]\n\nAlso, the [[squared triangular number|square of the {{math|''n''}}th triangular number]] is the same as the sum of the cubes of the integers 1 to {{math|''n''}}. This can also be expressed as\n:<math> \\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n k \\right)^2.</math>\n\nThe sum of the first {{mvar|n}} triangular numbers is the {{math|''n''}}th [[tetrahedral number]]:\n:<math> \\sum_{k=1}^n T_k = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} = \\frac {n(n+1)(n+2)} {6}.</math>\n\nMore generally, the difference between the {{math|''n''}}th [[polygonal number|{{math|''m''}}-gonal number]] and the {{math|''n''}}th {{math|(''m'' + 1)}}-gonal number is the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}th triangular number. For example, the sixth [[heptagonal number]] (81) minus the sixth [[hexagonal number]] (66) equals the fifth triangular number, 15. Every other triangular number is a hexagonal number. Knowing the triangular numbers, one can reckon any [[centered polygonal number]]; the {{math|''n''}}th centered {{math|''k''}}-gonal number is obtained by the formula\n:<math>Ck_n = kT_{n-1}+1</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''T''}} is a triangular number.\n\nThe positive difference of two triangular numbers is a [[trapezoidal number]].\n\n==Other properties==\nTriangular numbers correspond to the first-degree case of [[Faulhaber's formula]].\n\nAlternating triangular numbers (1, 6, 15, 28, ...) are also [[hexagonal number]]s.\n\nEvery even [[perfect number]] is triangular (as well as hexagonal), given by the formula\n:<math>M_p 2^{p-1} = \\frac{M_p (M_p + 1)}2 = T_{M_p}</math>\nwhere {{math|''M<sub>p</sub>''}} is a [[Mersenne prime]]. No odd perfect numbers are known, hence all known perfect numbers are triangular.\n\nFor example, the third triangular number is (3 × 2 =) 6, the seventh is (7 × 4 =) 28, the 31st is (31 × 16 =) 496, and the 127th is (127 × 64 =) 8128.\n\nIn [[base 10]], the [[digital root]] of a nonzero triangular number is always 1, 3, 6, or 9. Hence every triangular number is either divisible by three or has a remainder of 1 when divided by 9:\n:0 = 9 × 0\n:1 = 9 × 0 + 1\n:3 = 9 × 0 + 3\n:6 = 9 × 0 + 6\n:10 = 9 × 1 + 1\n:15 = 9 × 1 + 6\n:21 = 9 × 2 + 3\n:28 = 9 × 3 + 1\n:36 = 9 × 4\n:45 = 9 × 5\n:55 = 9 × 6 + 1\n:66 = 9 × 7 + 3\n:78 = 9 × 8 + 6\n:91 = 9 × 10 + 1\n:…\n:There is a more specific property to the triangular numbers that aren't divisible by 3, that is, they either have a remainder 1 or 10 when divided by 27.  Those that are equal to 10 mod 27, are also equal to 10 mod 81.\nThe digital root pattern for triangular numbers, repeating every nine terms, as shown above, is \"1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 9\".\n\nThe converse of the statement above is, however, not always true. For example, the digital root of 12, which is not a triangular number, is 3 and divisible by three.\n\nIf {{math|''x''}} is a triangular number, then {{math|''ax'' + ''b''}} is also a triangular number, given {{math|''a''}} is an odd square and {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a'' − 1|8}}}}\n\n{{math|''b''}} will always be a triangular number, because {{math|1=8''T''<sub>''n''</sub> + 1 = (2''n'' + 1)<sup>2</sup>}}, which yields all the odd squares are revealed by multiplying a triangular number by 8 and adding 1, and the process for {{math|''b''}} given {{math|''a''}} is an odd square is the inverse of this operation.\n\nThe first several pairs of this form (not counting {{math|1''x'' + 0}}) are: {{math|9''x'' + 1}}, {{math|25''x'' + 3}}, {{math|49''x'' + 6}}, {{math|81''x'' + 10}}, {{math|121''x'' + 15}}, {{math|169''x'' + 21}}, … etc. Given {{math|''x''}} is equal to {{math|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, these formulas yield {{math|''T''<sub>3''n'' + 1</sub>}}, {{math|''T''<sub>5''n'' + 2</sub>}}, {{math|''T''<sub>7''n'' + 3</sub>}}, {{math|''T''<sub>9''n'' + 4</sub>}}, and so on.\n\nThe sum of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of all the nonzero triangular numbers is\n:<math> \\!\\ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{1 \\over {{n^2 + n} \\over 2}} = 2\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{1 \\over {n^2 + n}} = 2 .</math>\n\nThis can be shown by using the basic sum of a [[telescoping series]]:\n:<math> \\!\\ \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}{1 \\over {n(n+1)}} = 1 .</math>\n\nTwo other interesting formulas regarding triangular numbers are\n:<math>T_{a+b} = T_a + T_b + ab</math>\n\nand\n:<math>T_{ab} = T_aT_b + T_{a-1}T_{b-1},</math>\nboth of which can easily be established either by looking at dot patterns (see above) or with some simple algebra.\n\nIn 1796, German mathematician and scientist [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of three triangular numbers (possibly including {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}} = 0), writing in his diary his famous words, \"[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ!]] {{nowrap|1=num = Δ + Δ + Δ}}\". Note that this theorem does not imply that the triangular numbers are different (as in the case of 20 = 10 + 10 + 0), nor that a solution with exactly three nonzero triangular numbers must exist. This is a special case of the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].\n\nThe largest triangular number of the form {{math|2<sup>''k''</sup> − 1}} is [[4000 (number)#4001 to 4099|4095]] (see [[Ramanujan–Nagell equation]]).\n\n[[Wacław Sierpiński|Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński]] posed the question as to the existence of four distinct triangular numbers in [[geometric progression]]. It was conjectured by Polish mathematician [[Kazimierz Szymiczek]] to be impossible and was later proven by Fang and Chen in 2007.<ref>[http://www.emis.de/journals/INTEGERS/papers/h19/h19.pdf Chen, Fang: Triangular numbers in geometric progression]</ref><ref>[http://www.emis.de/journals/INTEGERS/papers/h57/h57.pdf Fang: Nonexistence of a geometric progression that contains four triangular numbers]</ref>\n\nFormulas involving expressing an integer as the sum of triangular numbers are connected to [[theta function]]s, in particular the [[Ramanujan theta function]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhi-Guo|date=2003-12-01|title=An Identity of Ramanujan and the Representation of Integers as Sums of Triangular Numbers|journal=The Ramanujan Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=407–434|doi=10.1023/B:RAMA.0000012425.42327.ae|issn=1382-4090}}</ref><ref>{{cite arxiv|last=Sun|first=Zhi-Hong|date=2016-01-24|title=Ramanujan's theta functions and sums of triangular numbers|eprint=1601.06378|class=math.NT}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nA [[fully connected network]] of {{math|''n''}} computing devices requires the presence of {{math|''T''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub>}} cables or other connections; this is equivalent to the handshake problem mentioned above.\n\nIn a tournament format that uses a round-robin [[group stage]], the number of matches that need to be played between {{math|''n''}} teams is equal to the triangular number {{math|''T''<sub>''n'' − 1</sub>}}. For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches. This is also equivalent to the handshake problem and fully connected network problems.\n\nOne way of calculating the [[depreciation]] of an asset is the [[depreciation#Sum-of-years-digits method|sum-of-years' digits method]], which involves finding {{math|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the length in years of the asset's useful life. Each year, the item loses {{math|(''b'' − ''s'') × {{sfrac|''n'' − ''y''|''T''<sub>''n''</sub>}}}}, where {{math|''b''}} is the item's beginning value (in units of currency), {{math|''s''}} is its final salvage value, {{math|''n''}} is the total number of years the item is usable, and {{math|''y''}} the current year in the depreciation schedule. Under this method, an item with a usable life of {{math|''n''}} = 4 years would lose {{sfrac|4|10}} of its \"losable\" value in the first year, {{sfrac|3|10}} in the second, {{sfrac|2|10}} in the third, and {{sfrac|1|10}} in the fourth, accumulating a total depreciation of {{sfrac|10|10}} (the whole) of the losable value.\n\n==Triangular roots and tests for triangular numbers{{Anchor|Triangular root}}==\nBy analogy with the [[square root]] of {{mvar|x}}, one can define the (positive) triangular root of {{mvar|x}} as the number {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|1=''T''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''x''}}:<ref name=\"EulerRoots\">{{Citation |last=Euler |first=Leonhard |authorlink=Leonhard Euler |last2=Lagrange |first2=Joseph Louis |author2-link=Joseph Louis Lagrange |year=1810 |title=Elements of Algebra |edition=2nd |volume=1 |publisher=J.

      "text": "An '''Ulam number''' is a member of an [[integer sequence]] devised by and named after [[Stanislaw Ulam]], who introduced it in 1964.<ref>{{harvs|last=Ulam|year=1964a|year2=1964b|txt|authorlink=Stanislaw Ulam}}.</ref>  The standard Ulam sequence (the (1,&nbsp;2)-Ulam  sequence) starts with ''U''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''U''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.  Then for ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2, ''U''<sub>''n''</sub> is defined to be the smallest [[integer]] that is the sum of two distinct earlier terms in exactly one way and larger than all earlier terms.\n\n==Examples==\nAs a consequence of the definition, 3 is an Ulam number (1+2); and 4 is an Ulam number (1+3). (Here 2+2 is not a second representation of 4, because the previous terms must be distinct.)  The integer 5 is not an Ulam number, because 5&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.  The first few terms are\n:1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 16, 18, 26, 28, 36, 38, 47, 48, 53, 57, 62, 69, 72, 77, 82, 87, 97, 99, 102, 106, 114, 126, 131, 138, 145, 148, 155, 175, 177, 180, 182, 189, 197, 206, 209, 219, 221, 236, 238, 241, 243, 253, 258, 260, 273, 282, ... {{OEIS|id=A002858}}.\n\nThere are infinitely many Ulam numbers. For, after the first ''n'' numbers in the sequence have already been determined, it is always possible to extend the sequence by one more element: {{nowrap|''U''<sub>''n'' &minus; 1</sub> + ''U''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is uniquely represented as a sum of two of the first ''n'' numbers, and there may be other smaller numbers that are also uniquely represented in this way, so the next element can be chosen as the smallest of these uniquely representable numbers.<ref>{{harvtxt|Recaman|1973}} gives a similar argument, phrased as a [[proof by contradiction]]. He states that, if there were finitely many Ulam numbers, then the sum of the last two would also be an Ulam number &ndash; a contradiction. However, although the sum of the last two numbers would in this case have a unique representation as a sum of two Ulam numbers, it would not necessarily be the smallest number with a unique representation.</ref>\n\nUlam is said to have conjectured that the numbers have zero [[Natural density|density]],<ref>The statement that Ulam made this conjecture is in OEIS {{OEIS2C|id=A002858}}, but Ulam does not address the density of this sequence in {{harvtxt|Ulam|1964a}}, and in {{harvtxt|Ulam|1964b}} he poses the question of determining its density without conjecturing a value for it. {{harvtxt|Recaman|1973}} repeats the question from {{harvtxt|Ulam|1964b}} of the density of this sequence, again without conjecturing a value for it.</ref> but they seem to have a density of approximately 0.07398.<ref>OEIS {{OEIS2C|id=A002858}}</ref>\n\n==Hidden structure==\nIt has been observed<ref>{{harvtxt|Steinerberger|2015}}</ref> that the first 10 million Ulam numbers satisfy <math> \\cos{(2.5714474995 a_n)} < 0 </math> except for the four elements <math> \\left\\{2,3,47,69\\right\\} </math> (this has now been verified up to <math>n = 10^9</math>). Inequalities of this type are usually true for sequences exhibiting some form of periodicity but the Ulam sequence does not seem to be periodic and the phenomenon is not understood. It can be exploited to do a fast computation of the Ulam sequence (see external links).\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe idea can be generalized as (''u'',&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers by selecting different starting values (''u'',&nbsp;''v''). A sequence of (''u'',&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers is ''regular'' if the sequence of differences between consecutive numbers in the sequence is eventually periodic. When ''v'' is an odd number greater than three, the (2,&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers are regular. When ''v'' is congruent to 1 (mod 4) and at least five, the (4,&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers are again regular. However, the Ulam numbers themselves do not appear to be regular.<ref>{{harvtxt|Queneau|1972}} first observed the regularity of the sequences for ''u''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;7 and ''v''&nbsp;=&nbsp;9. {{harvtxt|Finch|1992}} conjectured the extension of this result to all odd ''v'' greater than three, and this conjecture was proven by {{harvtxt|Schmerl|Spiegel|1994}}. The regularity of the (4,&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers was proven by {{harvtxt|Cassaigne|Finch|1995}}.</ref>\n\nA sequence of numbers is said to be ''s''-additive if each number in the sequence, after the initial 2''s'' terms of the sequence, has exactly ''s'' representations as a sum of two previous numbers. Thus, the Ulam numbers and the (''u'',&nbsp;''v'')-Ulam numbers are 1-additive sequences.<ref>{{harvtxt|Queneau|1972}}.</ref>\n\nIf a sequence is formed by appending the largest number with a unique representation as a sum of two earlier numbers, instead of appending the smallest uniquely representable number, then the resulting sequence is the sequence of [[Fibonacci number]]s.<ref>{{harvtxt|Finch|1992}}.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Cassaigne | first = Julien\n | last2 = Finch | first2 = Steven R.\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Experimental Mathematics\n | pages = 49–60\n | title = A class of 1-additive sequences and quadratic recurrences\n | url = http://www.emis.ams.org/journals/EM/restricted/4/4.1/finch.ps\n | volume = 4\n | year = 1995\n | doi = 10.1080/10586458.1995.10504307\n | mr = 1359417}}\n*{{citation\n | last = Finch | first = Steven R.\n | doi = 10.1016/0097-3165(92)90042-S\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A\n | pages = 123–130\n | title = On the regularity of certain 1-additive sequences\n | volume = 60\n | year = 1992\n | mr = 1156652}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Guy|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard K.

Some [[perfect number]]s are not unitary perfect numbers, and some unitary perfect numbers are not regular perfect numbers.\n\n==Examples==\n[[60 (number)|60]] is a unitary perfect number, because 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, and 20 are its proper unitary divisors, and 1 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 60.

Thus, if a number ''n'' can be written as a sum of two distinct primes, then ''n''+1 is not an untouchable number. It is expected that every even number larger than 6 is a sum of two distinct primes, so probably no odd number larger than 7 is an untouchable number, and <math>1=\\sigma(2)-2</math>, <math>3=\\sigma(4)-4</math>, <math>7=\\sigma(8)-8</math>, so only 5 can be an odd untouchable number.<ref>The stronger version is obtained by adding to the Goldbach conjecture the further requirement that the two primes be distinct - see {{MathWorld|urlname=UntouchableNumber|title=Untouchable Number|author=Adams-Watters, Frank and Weisstein, Eric W.}}</ref> Thus it appears that besides 2 and 5, all untouchable numbers are [[composite number]]s (since except 2, all even numbers are composite). No [[perfect number]] is untouchable, since, at the very least, it can be expressed as the sum of its own proper [[divisor]]s (this situation happens at the case for [[28 (number)|28]]). Similarly, none of the [[amicable number]]s or [[sociable number]]s are untouchable.\n\nNo untouchable number is one more than a [[prime number]], since if ''p'' is prime, then the sum of the proper divisors of ''p''<sup>2</sup> is&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Also, no untouchable number is three more than a prime number, except 5, since if ''p'' is an odd prime then the sum of the proper divisors of ''2p'' is&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;+&nbsp;3.\n\n==Infinitude==\nThere are infinitely many untouchable numbers, a fact that was proven by [[Paul Erdős]].<ref>P.

In many cases another representation called a '''preferential arrangement''' based on a [[utility function]] is also possible.\n\nWeak orderings are counted by the [[ordered Bell number]]s.

Although this ordering has a smallest element (the origin itself), it does not have any second-smallest elements, nor any largest element.\n\n[[Opinion poll]]ing in political elections provides an example of a type of ordering that resembles weak orderings, but is better modeled mathematically in other ways. In the results of a poll, one candidate may be clearly ahead of another, or the two candidates may be statistically tied, meaning not that their poll results are equal but rather that they are within the [[margin of error]] of each other. However, if candidate ''x'' is statistically tied with ''y'', and ''y'' is statistically tied with ''z'', it might still be possible for ''x'' to be clearly better than ''z'', so being tied is not in this case a [[transitive relation]].

Note that this source refers to asymmetric relations as \"strictly antisymmetric\".</ref> that is [[asymmetric relation|asymmetric]]) in which the relation \"neither ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'' nor ''b''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''a''\" is transitive.<ref name=\"fr11\"/> Therefore, a strict weak ordering has the following properties:\n* For all ''x'' in ''S'', it is not the case that ''x'' < ''x'' ([[Irreflexive relation|irreflexivity]]).\n* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''S'', if ''x'' < ''y'' then it is not the case that ''y'' < ''x'' ([[Asymmetric relation|asymmetry]]).\n* For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S'', if ''x'' < ''y'' and ''y'' < ''z'' then ''x'' < ''z'' ([[Transitive relation|transitivity]]).\n* For all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''S'', if ''x'' is incomparable with ''y'' (neither ''x'' < ''y'' nor ''y'' < ''x'' hold), and ''y'' is incomparable with ''z'', then ''x'' is incomparable with ''z'' (transitivity of incomparability).\nThis list of properties is somewhat redundant, in that asymmetry implies irreflexivity, and in that irreflexivity and transitivity together imply asymmetry.\n\nThe \"incomparability relation\" is an [[equivalence relation]], and its [[equivalence class]]es partition the elements of ''S'', and are [[Total order|totally ordered]] by&nbsp;<. Conversely, any total order on a [[Partition (set theory)|partition]] of ''S'' gives rise to a strict weak ordering in which ''x'' < ''y'' if and only if there exists sets ''A'' and ''B'' in the partition with ''x'' in ''A'', ''y'' in ''B'', and ''A''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''B'' in the total order.\n\nNot every partial order obeys the transitive law for incomparability. For instance, consider the partial order in the set {''a'',&nbsp;''b'',&nbsp;''c''} defined by the relationship ''b''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''c''. The pairs ''a'',&nbsp;''b'' and ''a'',&nbsp;''c'' are incomparable but ''b'' and ''c'' are related, so incomparability does not form an equivalence relation and this example is not a strict weak ordering.\n\nTransitivity of incomparability (together with transitivity) can also be stated in the following forms:\n* If ''x'' < ''y'', then for all ''z'', either ''x'' < ''z'' or ''z'' < ''y'' or both.\nOr:\n* If ''x'' is incomparable with ''y'', then for all ''z''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''x'', ''z''&nbsp;≠&nbsp;''y'', either (''x'' < ''z'' and ''y'' < ''z'') or (''z'' < ''x'' and ''z'' < ''y'') or (''z'' is incomparable with ''x'' and ''z'' is incomparable with ''y'').\n\n===Total preorders<!--This section is linked from [[Preference (economics)]]-->===\nStrict weak orders are very closely related to '''total preorders''' or '''(non-strict) weak orders''', and the same mathematical concepts that can be modeled with strict weak orderings can be modeled equally well with total preorders. A total preorder or weak order is a [[preorder]] that also is a [[connex relation]];<ref>In older sources, connexity is called ''totality'' property. However, this terminology is disadvantageous as it may lead to confusion with e.g. the unrelated notion of [[right-total]]ity, a.k.a. surjectivity.</ref> that is, no pair of items is incomparable. A total preorder <math>\\lesssim</math> satisfies the following properties:\n\n* For all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', if ''x'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''y'' and ''y'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''z'' then ''x'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''z'' (transitivity).\n* For all ''x'' and ''y'', ''x'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''y'' or ''y'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''x'' (connexity).\n** Hence, for all ''x'', ''x'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''x'' (reflexivity).\n\nA [[total order]] is a total preorder which is antisymmetric, in other words, which is also a [[Partially ordered set|partial order]]. Total preorders are sometimes also called '''preference relations'''.\n\nThe [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of a strict weak order is a total preorder, and vice versa, but it seems more natural to relate strict weak orders and total preorders in a way that preserves rather than reverses the order of the elements.  Thus we take the [[inverse relation|inverse]] of the complement: for a strict weak ordering <, define a total preorder <math>\\lesssim</math> by setting ''x'' <math>\\lesssim</math> ''y'' whenever it is not the case that ''y'' < ''x''.

In the case of a ''total'' preorder the corresponding partial order on the set of equivalence classes is a total order. Two elements are equivalent in a total preorder if and only if they are incomparable in the corresponding strict weak ordering.\n\n===Ordered partitions===\nA [[partition of a set]] ''S'' is a family of non-empty disjoint subsets of ''S'' that have ''S'' as their union. A partition, together with a [[total order]] on the sets of the partition, gives a structure called by [[Richard P. Stanley]] an '''ordered partition'''<ref>{{citation|first=Richard P.|last=Stanley|authorlink=Richard P.

California, Los Angeles, Calif., 1968)\n | year = 1971}}.</ref> An ordered partition of a finite set may be written as a [[finite sequence]] of the sets in the partition: for instance, the three ordered partitions of the set {''a'', ''b''} are\n:{''a''}, {''b''},\n:{''b''}, {''a''}, and\n:{''a'', ''b''}.\n\nIn a strict weak ordering, the equivalence classes of incomparability give a set partition, in which the sets inherit a total ordering from their elements, giving rise to an ordered partition. In the other direction, any ordered partition gives rise to a strict weak ordering in which two elements are incomparable when they belong to the same set in the partition, and otherwise inherit the order of the sets that contain them.\n\n===Representation by functions===\nFor sets of sufficiently small [[cardinality]], a third axiomatization is possible, based on real-valued functions. If ''X'' is any set and ''f'' a real-valued function on ''X'' then ''f'' induces a strict weak order on ''X'' by setting ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;''f''(''b''). The associated total preorder is given by setting ''a''<math>{}\\lesssim{}</math>''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''f''(''b''),\nand the associated equivalence by setting ''a''<math>{}\\sim{}</math>''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''f''(''b'').\n\nThe relations do not change when ''f'' is replaced by ''g''&nbsp;<small>o</small>&nbsp;''f'' ([[Function composition|composite function]]), where ''g'' is a [[Monotonic function|strictly increasing]] real-valued function defined on at least the range of&nbsp;''f''. Thus e.g. a [[Utility#Utility functions|utility function]] defines a [[preference]] relation. In this context, weak orderings are also known as '''preferential arrangements'''.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Gross | first = O.

For example, there is no such function for the [[lexicographic order]] on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. Thus, while in most preference relation models the relation defines a utility function [[up to]] order-preserving transformations, there is no such function for [[lexicographic preferences]].\n\nMore generally, if ''X'' is a set, and ''Y'' is a set with a strict weak ordering \"<\", and ''f'' a function from ''X'' to ''Y'', then ''f'' induces a strict weak ordering on ''X'' by setting ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')&nbsp;<&nbsp;''f''(''b''). As before, the associated total preorder is given by setting ''a''<math>{}\\lesssim{}</math>''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')<math>{}\\lesssim{}</math>''f''(''b''), and the associated equivalence by setting ''a''<math>{}\\sim{}</math>''b'' if and only if ''f''(''a'')<math>{}\\sim{}</math>''f''(''b''). It is not assumed here that ''f'' is an [[injective function]], so a class of two equivalent elements on ''Y'' may induce a larger class of equivalent elements on ''X''. Also, ''f'' is not assumed to be a [[surjective function]], so a class of equivalent elements on ''Y'' may induce a smaller or empty class on ''X''. However, the function ''f'' induces an injective function that maps the partition on ''X'' to that on ''Y''. Thus, in the case of finite partitions, the number of classes in ''X'' is less than or equal to the number of classes on ''Y''.\n\n==Related types of ordering==\n\n[[Semiorder]]s generalize strict weak orderings, but do not assume transitivity of incomparability.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Luce | first = R.

There are three ways of partitioning the items into one [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] set and one group of two tied items, and each of these partitions gives two weak orders (one in which the singleton is smaller than the group of two, and one in which this ordering is reversed), giving six weak orders of this type. And there is a single way of partitioning the set into three singletons, which can be totally ordered in six different ways. Thus, altogether, there are 13 different weak orders on three items.\n\n===Adjacency structure===\n[[File:Permutohedron.svg|thumb|300px|The permutohedron on four elements, a three-dimensional [[convex polyhedron]]. It has 24 vertices, 36 edges, and 14 two-dimensional faces, which all together with the whole three-dimensional polyhedron correspond to the 75 weak orderings on four elements.]]\nUnlike for partial orders, the family of weak orderings on a given finite set is not in general connected by moves that add or remove a single order relation to a given ordering. For instance, for three elements, the ordering in which all three elements are tied differs by at least two pairs from any other weak ordering on the same set, in either the strict weak ordering or total preorder axiomatizations. However, a different kind of move is possible, in which the weak orderings on a set are more highly connected. Define a ''dichotomy'' to be a weak ordering with two equivalence classes, and define a dichotomy to be ''compatible'' with a given weak ordering if every two elements that are related in the ordering are either related in the same way or tied in the dichotomy. Alternatively, a dichotomy may be defined as a [[Dedekind cut]] for a weak ordering. Then a weak ordering may be characterized by its set of compatible dichotomies. For a finite set of labeled items, every pair of weak orderings may be connected to each other by a sequence of moves that add or remove one dichotomy at a time to or from this set of dichotomies. Moreover, the [[undirected graph]] that has the weak orderings as its vertices, and these moves as its edges, forms a [[partial cube]].<ref>{{citation|title=Media Theory: Interdisciplinary Applied Mathematics|first1=David|last1=Eppstein|author1-link=David Eppstein|first2=Jean-Claude|last2=Falmagne|author2-link=Jean-Claude Falmagne|first3=Sergei|last3=Ovchinnikov|publisher=Springer|year=2008|at=Section 9.4, Weak Orders and Cubical Complexes, pp. 188–196}}.</ref>\n\nGeometrically, the total orderings of a given finite set may be represented as the vertices of a [[permutohedron]], and the dichotomies on this same set as the facets of the permutohedron.

However, the author claims that the first few members of the sequence are 11, 67, 2, 4769, 67. Later, inspired by this wild and erratic behaviour of the fictional wild numbers, American mathematician J. C. Lagarias used the terminology to describe a precisely defined sequence of integers which shows somewhat similar wild and erratic behaviour.

But if the same steps were repeated often enough, the eventual outcome was once again a whole number. Or, as Beauregard cheerfully observed: “In all numbers lurks a wild number, guaranteed to emerge when you provoke them long enough” . 0 yielded the wild number 11, 1 brought forth 67, 2 itself, 3 suddenly manifested itself as 4769, 4, surprisingly, brought forth 67 again. Beauregard himself had found fifty different wild numbers. The money prize was now awarded to whoever found a new one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Philibert Schogt|title=The Wild Numbers: A Novel|date=March 23, 2000|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows|isbn=978-1568581668|edition=First|page=34}}</ref>\n\nBut it has not been specified what those \"deceptively simple operations\" are.

According to OEIS, \"apparently these are completely fictional and there is no mathematical explanation\". However, the OEIS has some entries relating to pseudo-wild numbers carrying well-defined mathematical explanations.<ref name=OEIS/>\n\n==Sequences of pseudo-wild numbers==\n\nEven though the sequence of wild numbers is entirely fictional, several mathematicians have tried to find rules that would generate the sequence of the fictional wild numbers. All these attempts have resulted in failures. However, in the process, certain new sequences of integers were created having similar wild and erratic behavior. These well-defined sequences are referred to as sequences of pseudo-wild numbers. A good example of this is the one discovered by the Dutch mathematician Floor van Lamoen. This sequence is defined as follows:<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=1211.6583|last1=Schogt|first1=Philibert|title=The Wild Number Problem: Math or fiction?|class=math.HO|year=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A059175 |url=https://oeis.org/A059175|website=OEIS|publisher=The  OEIS Foundation.|accessdate=30 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n:For a rational number ''p''/''q'' let \n::<math>f(p/q) = \\frac{pq}{ \\text{  sum of digits of } p \\text{ and }q }</math>.\n:For a positive integer ''n'', the ''n''-th pseudo-wild number is the number obtained by iterating ''f'', starting at ''n''/1, until an integer is reached, and if no integer is reached the pseudo-wild number is 0.\n\n:For example, taking ''n''=2, we have\n\n::<math>\\frac{2}{1} , \\frac{2}{3} , \\frac{6}{5} , \\frac{30}{11} , \\frac{330}{5} , 66</math>\n\n:and so the 2-nd pseudo-wild number is 66.

Znám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician [[Štefan Znám]], who suggested it in 1972, although other mathematicians had considered similar problems around the same time. One closely related problem drops the assumption of properness of the divisor, and will be called the improper Znám problem hereafter.\n\nOne solution to the improper Znám problem is easily provided for any ''k'': the first ''k'' terms of [[Sylvester's sequence]] have the required property. {{harvtxt|Sun|1983}} showed that there is at least one solution to the (proper) Znám problem for each ''k'' ≥ 5. Sun's solution is based on a recurrence similar to that for Sylvester's sequence, but with a different set of initial values.\n\nThe Znám problem is closely related to [[Egyptian fractions]]. It is known that there are only finitely many solutions for any fixed ''k''. It is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znám's problem using only odd numbers, and there remain several other open questions.\n\n==The problem==\n\nZnám's problem asks which sets of integers have the property that each integer in the set is a [[proper divisor]] of the product of the other integers in the set, plus 1. That is, given ''k'', what sets of integers \n:<math>\\{n_1, \\ldots, n_k\\}</math>\nare there, such that, for each ''i'', ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> divides but is not equal to\n:<math>\\Bigl(\\prod_{j \\ne i}^n n_j\\Bigr) + 1\\quad ?</math>\n\nA closely related problem concerns sets of integers in which each integer in the set is a divisor, but not necessarily a proper divisor, of one plus the product of the other integers in the set. This problem does not seem to have been named in the literature, and will be referred to as the improper Znám problem. Any solution to Znám's problem is also a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not necessarily vice versa.\n\n== History ==\n\nZnám's problem is named after the Slovak mathematician [[Štefan Znám]], who suggested it in 1972. {{harvtxt|Barbeau|1971}} had posed the improper Znám problem for ''k'' = 3, and {{harvtxt|Mordell|1973}}, independently of Znám, found all solutions to the improper problem for ''k'' ≤ 5. {{harvtxt|Skula|1975}} showed that Znám's problem is unsolvable for ''k'' < 5, and credited J. Janák with finding the solution {2, 3, 11, 23, 31} for ''k'' = 5.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nOne solution to ''k'' = 5 is {2, 3, 7, 47, 395}. A few calculations will show that\n\n:{|\n|align=\"right\" | 3 &times; 7 &times; 47 &times; 395 || + 1 = || 389866, || &nbsp; || which is divisible by but unequal to 2,\n|-\n|align=\"right\" | 2 &times; 7 &times; 47 &times; 395 || + 1 = || 259911, || &nbsp; || which is divisible by but unequal to 3,\n|-\n|align=\"right\" | 2 &times; 3 &times; 47 &times; 395 || + 1 = || 111391, || &nbsp; || which is divisible by but unequal to 7,\n|-\n|align=\"right\" | 2 &times; 3 &times; 7 &times; 395 || + 1 = || 16591, || &nbsp; || which is divisible by but unequal to 47, and\n|-\n|align=\"right\" | 2 &times; 3 &times; 7 &times; 47 || + 1 = || 1975, || &nbsp; || which is divisible by but unequal to 395.\n|}\n\nAn interesting \"near miss\" for ''k'' = 4 is the set {2, 3, 7, 43}, formed by taking the first four terms of Sylvester's sequence. It has the property that each integer in the set divides the product of the other integers in the set, plus 1, but the last member of this set is equal to the product of the first three members plus one, rather than being a proper divisor. Thus, it is a solution to the improper Znám problem, but not a solution to Znám's problem as it is usually defined.\n\n== Connection to Egyptian fractions ==\n\nAny solution to the improper Znám problem is equivalent (via division by the product of the ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>'s) to a solution to the equation\n:<math>\\sum\\frac1{x_i} + \\prod\\frac1{x_i}=y,</math>\nwhere ''y'' as well as each ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> must be an integer, and conversely any such solution corresponds to a solution to the improper Znám problem. However, all known solutions have ''y'' = 1, so they satisfy the equation\n:<math>\\sum\\frac1{x_i} + \\prod\\frac1{x_i}=1.</math>\nThat is, they lead to an [[Egyptian fraction]] representation of the number one as a sum of [[unit fractions]]. Several of the cited papers on Znám's problem study also the solutions to this equation. {{harvtxt|Brenton|Hill|1988}} describe an application of the equation in [[topology]], to the classification of [[Mathematical singularity|singularities]] on surfaces, and {{harvtxt|Domaratzki|Ellul|Shallit|Wang|2005}} describe an application to the theory of [[nondeterministic finite automata]].\n\n== Number of solutions ==\n\nAs {{harvtxt|Janák|Skula|1978}} showed, the number of solutions for any ''k'' is finite, so it makes sense to count the total number of solutions for each ''k''.\n\nBrenton and Vasiliu calculated that the number of solutions for small values of ''k'', starting with ''k'' = 5, forms the sequence\n:[[2 (number)|2]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[18 (number)|18]], [[96 (number)|96]] {{OEIS|id=A075441}}.\nPresently, a few solutions are known for ''k'' = 9 and ''k'' = 10, but it is unclear how many solutions remain undiscovered for those values of ''k''.\nHowever, there are infinitely many solutions if ''k'' is not fixed:\n{{harvtxt|Cao|Jing|1998}} showed that there are at least 39 solutions for each ''k'' ≥ 12, improving earlier results proving the existence of fewer solutions ({{harvnb|Cao|Liu|Zhang|1987}}, {{harvnb|Sun|Cao|1988}}). {{harvtxt|Sun|Cao|1988}} conjecture that the number of solutions for each value of ''k'' grows monotonically with ''k''.\n\nIt is unknown whether there are any solutions to Znám's problem using only odd numbers. With one exception, all known solutions start with [[2 (number)|2]]. If all numbers in a solution to Znám's problem or the improper Znám problem are [[prime number|prime]], their product is a [[primary pseudoperfect number]] {{harv|Butske|Jaje|Mayernik|2000}}; it is unknown whether infinitely many solutions of this type exist.\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* {{citation\n  | last = Barbeau | first = G.

The terms ''circular'' and ''spherical'' were formerly used for the slightly different case of a number whose powers all have the same last digit as the number itself.<ref>{{cite OED|spherical number}}</ref>\n\nAll automorphic numbers are spherical, i.e. if the square of a number ends in the same digits as the number, then so do all its higher powers.\n\nThe only automorphic [[Kaprekar number]] is 1, because the square of a Kaprekar number cannot start with zero.\n\nThe sequence of automorphic numbers begins [[1 (number)|1]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[25 (number)|25]], [[76 (number)|76]], [[376 (number)|376]], [[625 (number)|625]], 9376, ... {{OEIS|id=A003226}}.\n\nGiven a ''k''-digit automorphic number ''n'' > 1, an automorphic number ''n''′ with at most 2''k''-digits can be found with the formula:\n\n:<math>n'=(3\\cdot n^2 - 2\\cdot n^3) \\ \\bmod{10^{2k}}\\, .</math>\n\nFor ''k'' greater than 1, there are at most two automorphic numbers with ''k'' [[numerical digit|digit]]s, one ending in 5 and one ending in 6.

Using other radixes there are different automorphic numbers. 0 and 1 are automorphic numbers in every radix; automorphic numbers other than 0 and 1 only exist when the radix has at least two distinct prime factors.\n\nA single digit number ''x'' is automorphic in radix ''b'' > ''x'' when ''b'' divides ''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; ''x''. So 6 is automorphic in a radix which is a divisor of 6<sup>2</sup> &minus; 6 = 30 that is greater than 6; these divisors are 10, 15 and 30.\n\nIn any given radix there are 2<sup>''p''</sup> sequences of automorphic numbers where ''p'' is the number of distinct prime factors in the radix.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} For base 10 this gives 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 sequences, which are 0, 1, 5 and 6 for 1 digit or 00, 01, 25, 76 for two digits and so on. A [[prime power]] radix (such as 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, etc) can only have 0 and 1 (prepended by one or more zeroes) as automorphic numbers. Base 6 is the first radix with non-trivial automorphic numbers and base 15 the first such odd radix. Base 30 is the first radix with three distinct prime factors and has 8 sequences of automorphic numbers. Here some examples of non-trivial 1, 2 and 4 digit automorphic numbers in some non-primepower radixes (using A−Z to represent digits 10 to 35):\n\nThese numbers are the \"infinite\" solution of ''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; ''x'' = 0 in base ''b''. In fact, they are the solution of this equation in the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of [[p-adic number|''b''-adic numbers]]. If ''b'' is a prime power, then the ring is also a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. If it is a field, then the equation can be written as ''x''(''x'' &minus; 1) = 0, so the only solutions are 0 and 1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! ''number of digits (n)''\n! ''radix''\n!

For example:\n\n:253<sub>9</sub> = 2 + 3 + 5 + 23 + 32 + 25 + 52 + 35 + 53 (base = 9)\n::210 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 21 + 29 + 23 + 47 + 32 + 48 (base = 10)\n\n:276<sub>13</sub> = 2 + 6 + 7 + 26 + 62 + 27 + 72 + 67 + 76 (b=13)\n::435 = 2 + 6 + 7 + 32 + 80 + 33 + 93 + 85 + 97 (b=10)\n\n:DF53<sub>17</sub> = 3 + 5 + D + F + 35 + 53 + 3D + D3 + 3F + F3 + 5D + D5 + 5F + F5 + DF + FD + 35D + 3D5 + 53D + 5D3 + D35 + D53 + 35F + 3F5 + 53F + 5F3 + F35 + F53 + 3DF + 3FD + D3F + DF3 + F3D + FD3 + 5DF + 5FD + D5F + DF5 + F5D + FD5 (b=17)\n\n::68292 = 3 + 5 + 13 + 15 + 56 + 88 + 64 + 224 + 66 + 258 + 98 + 226 + 100 + 260 + 236 + 268 + 965 + 1093 + 1509 + 1669 + 3813 + 3845 + 967 + 1127 + 1511 + 1703 + 4391 + 4423 + 1103 + 1135 + 3823 + 4015 + 4399 + 4559 + 1681 + 1713 + 3857 + 4017 + 4433 + 4561 (b=10)\n\n==Multi-minimal Osiris numbers==\n\nUsing the same terminology, 132, 264 and 396 are '''minimal Osiris numbers''', being equal to the sums of all numbers formed from permutated samples of only two of their digits. 35964 is also minimal, being the sum of samples of three digits, but 34658 is a '''multi-minimal Osiris number''', being equal to the sums of all numbers formed from permutated samples of one or three of its digits:\n\n:34658 = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 345 + 354 + 435 + 453 + 534 + 543 + 346 + 364 + 436 + 463 + 634 + 643 + 348 + 384 + 438 + 483 + 834 + 843 + 356 + 365 + 536 + 563 + 635 + 653 + 358 + 385 + 538 + 583 + 835 + 853 + 368 + 386 + 638 + 683 + 836 + 863 + 456 + 465 + 546 + 564 + 645 + 654 + 458 + 485 + 548 + 584 + 845 + 854 + 468 + 486 + 648 + 684 + 846 + 864 + 568 + 586 + 658 + 685 + 856 + 865\n\n30659 and 38657 are similarly multi-minimal, using permutated samples of one and three of their digits.\n\n==Tests for Osiris numbers==\n\nTesting for Osiris numbers is simplified when one notes that, for example, each digit of 132 occurs twice in the ones and tens position of the sums:\n\n:132 = 12 + 21 + 13 + 31 + 23 + 32 = 2x11 + 2x22 + 2x33 = 22 + 44 + 66\n\nThe test can be further simplified:\n\n:132 = 2 x (11 + 22 + 33) = 2 x (1 + 2 + 3) x 11 = '''2 x 6 x 11'''\n\nIf only numbers with unique non-zero digits are considered, a three-digit number in base ten can have a digit-sum ranging from 6 = 1+2+3 to 24 = 7+8+9. If these potential digit-sums are used in the [[formula]] 2 x digit-sum x 11, the digit-sum of the result will determine whether or not the result is an Osiris number.\n\n:1. 2 x <u>6</u> x 11 = 132.\n:2. Digit-sum(132) = 1 + 2 + 3 = <u>6</u>.\n:3. Therefore 132 is an Osiris number.\n\n:1. 2 x <u>7</u> x 11 = 154.\n:2. Digit-sum(154) = 1 + 5 + 4 = <u>10</u>.\n:3. Therefore 154 is not an Osiris number.\n\nIn 35964, each digit occurs 12 times in the ones, tens and hundreds position of the sums:\n\n:35964 = 12x333 + 12x444 + 12x555 + 12x666 + 12x999 = 3996 + 5328 + 6660 + 7992 + 11988\n\n:35964 = 12 x (333 + 444 + 555 + 666 + 999) = 12 x (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 9) x 111 = '''12 x 27 x 111'''\n\nThe test for further five-digit Osiris numbers of the same form (sampling three digits) will use potential digit-sums between 15 = 1+2+3+4+5 and 35 = 5+6+7+8+9. When this range of digit-sums is tested, only 35964 returns the same digit-sum as that used in the formula. These simplified tests considerably reduce the task of finding large Osiris numbers in a particular base. For example, to test by [[brute-force search|brute force]] whether permutated six-digit samples of ''n'' = 332,639,667,360 are equal to ''n'' would involve summing 665,280 numbers, where 665,280 = 12 x 11 x 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 = 12! / 6!. However, because each digit of ''n'' occurs 55440 times in each of the six possible positions in the samples, the test is reduced to this:\n\n:1. digit-sum(<u>332,639,667,360</u>) = 3+3+2+6+3+9+6+6+7+3+6+0 = 54\n:2. 55440 x 54 x 111,111 = <u>332,639,667,360</u>\n:3. Therefore 332,639,667,360 is an Osiris number.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Digit sum]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Classes of natural numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Base-dependent integer sequences]]"

In the display of a calculator that can handle [[hexadecimal]], d and b are reflections of each other (in [[seven-segment display]] representations of hexadecimal digits, b and d are usually represented as lowercase while A, C, E and F are presented in uppercase). Likewise, 3 would become E reflected, and A remains the same, but A and E being even digits, the three or A cannot be used as the first digit because the reflected number will be even. <!-- TO DO: find or disprove hex# dihedral primes with 3 and E --> Though 6 and 9 become each other upside down, they are not valid digits when reflected, at least not in any of the numeral systems pocket calculators usually operate in. (Much as the case is with [[strobogrammatic number]]s, whether a number, whether prime, composite or otherwise, is dihedral partially depends on the typeface being used. In handwriting, a 2 drawn with a loop at its base can be strobogrammatic to a 6, numbers that are of little use for the purpose of prime numbers; in the character design used on [[Currency of the United States|U.S. dollar bills]], 5 reflects to a 7 when reflected in a mirror, while 2 resembles a 7 upside down.)\n\n[[Strobogrammatic prime]]s that don't use 6 or 9 are dihedral primes. This includes [[repunit prime]]s and all other [[palindromic prime]]s which only contain digits 0, 1 and 8 (in [[binary numeral system|binary]], all palindromic primes are dihedral). It appears to be unknown whether there exist infinitely many dihedral primes, but this would follow from the conjecture that there are infinitely many repunit primes.\n\nThe palindromic prime 10<sup>180054</sup> + 8×(10<sup>58567</sup>−1)/9×10<sup>60744</sup> + 1, discovered in 2009 by Darren Bedwell, is 180,055 digits long and may be the largest known dihedral prime {{As of|2009|lc=on}}.<ref>Chris Caldwell, [http://primes.utm.edu/top20/page.php?id=53 ''The Top Twenty: Palindrome''].

For example, 347 is a Friedman number, since 347 = 7<sup>3</sup> + 4. The base 10 Friedman numbers are:\n\n:25, 121, 125, 126, 127, 128, 153, 216, 289, 343, 347, 625, 688, 736, 1022, 1024, 1206, 1255, 1260, 1285, 1296, 1395, 1435, 1503, 1530, 1792, 1827, 2048, 2187, 2349, 2500, 2501, 2502, 2503, 2504, 2505, 2506, 2507, 2508, 2509, 2592, 2737, 2916, ... {{OEIS|id=A036057}}.\n\nFriedman numbers are named after [[Erich Friedman]], {{as of|2013|lc=yes}} an Associate Professor of Mathematics and ex-chairman of the Mathematics and Computer Science Department at [[Stetson University]], located in [[DeLand, Florida]].\n\n==Results==\nParentheses can be used in the expressions, but only to override the default operator precedence, for example, in 1024 = (4 − 2)<sup>10</sup>. Allowing parentheses without operators would result in trivial Friedman numbers such as 24 = (24). Leading zeros cannot be used, since that would also result in trivial Friedman numbers, such as 001729 = 1700 + 29.\n\nThe expressions of the first few Friedman number are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|number\n|expression\n|number\n|expression\n|number\n|expression\n|number\n|expression\n|-\n|25\n|5<sup>2</sup>\n|127\n|2<sup>7</sup>−1\n|289\n|(8+9)<sup>2</sup>\n|688\n|8×86\n|-\n|121\n|11<sup>2</sup>\n|128\n|2<sup>8−1</sup>\n|343\n|(3+4)<sup>3</sup>\n|736\n|3<sup>6</sup>+7\n|-\n|125\n|5<sup>1+2</sup>\n|153\n|3×51\n|347\n|7<sup>3</sup>+4\n|1022\n|2<sup>10</sup>−2\n|-\n|126\n|6×21\n|216\n|6<sup>2+1</sup>\n|625\n|5<sup>6−2</sup>\n|1024\n|(4−2)<sup>10</sup>\n|}\n\nA ''nice'' or ''orderly'' Friedman number is a Friedman number where the digits in the expression can be arranged to be in the same order as in the number itself. For example, we can arrange 127 = 2<sup>7</sup> − 1 as 127 = −1 + 2<sup>7</sup>. The first nice Friedman numbers are:\n\n:127, 343, 736, 1285, 2187, 2502, 2592, 2737, 3125, 3685, 3864, 3972, 4096, 6455, 11264, 11664, 12850, 13825, 14641, 15552, 15585, 15612, 15613, 15617, 15618, 15621, 15622, 15623, 15624, 15626, 15632, 15633, 15642, 15645, 15655, 15656, 15662, 15667, 15688, 16377, 16384, 16447, 16875, 17536, 18432, 19453, 19683, 19739 {{OEIS|id=A080035}}.\n\nFriedman's website shows around 100 zeroless [[pandigital number|pandigital]] Friedman numbers {{as of|2013|8|lc=on}}.

Only one of them is nice: 268435179 = −268 + 4<sup>(3×5 − 1<sup>7</sup>)</sup> − 9.\n\nMichael Brand proved that the density of Friedman numbers among the naturals is 1,<ref>Michael Brand, \"Friedman numbers have density 1\", ''Discrete Applied Mathematics'', '''161'''(16–17), Nov. 2013, pp. 2389-2395.</ref> which is to say that the probability of a number chosen randomly and uniformly between 1 and ''n'' to be a Friedman number tends to 1 as ''n'' tends to infinity. This result extends to Friedman numbers under any base of representation. He also proved that the same is true also for binary, ternary and quaternary orderly Friedman numbers.<ref>Michael Brand, \"On the Density of Nice Friedmans\", Oct 2013, https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2390.</ref> The case of base-10 orderly Friedman numbers is still open.\n\nFrom the observation that all numbers of the form 25×10<sup>2''n''</sup> can be written as 5000...000<sup>2</sup> with ''n'' 0's, we can find sequences of consecutive Friedman numbers which are arbitrarily long. Friedman gives the example of 250068 = 500<sup>2</sup> + 68, from which we can easily deduce the range of consecutive Friedman numbers from 250000 to 250099.\n\nThere are an infinite number of prime Friedman numbers in base 10, because the numbers ''n''×10<sup>14</sup>+19683 = ''n''×10<sup>6+8</sup>+3<sup>9</sup>+0+0+ . . . are Friedman numbers for all ''n''. The numbers of this form are an arithmetic sequence ''a'' ''n''+''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are relatively prime, and therefore, by [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions]], the sequence contains an infinite number of primes. It is simple to find similar arguments to show that this holds for bases other than base 10.\n\nThe smallest [[repdigit]] (and therefore nice) Friedman number in base 10 is thought to be 99999999 = (9 + 9/9)<sup>9−9/9</sup> − 9/9. It has been proven that repdigits of more than 24 digits are nice Friedman numbers in any base.\n\n[[Vampire number]]s are a subset of Friedman numbers where the only operation is a multiplication of two numbers with the same number of digits, for example 1260 = 21 × 60.\n\n== Finding 2-digit Friedman numbers ==\nThere usually are fewer 2-digit Friedman numbers than 3-digit and more in any given base, but the 2-digit ones are easier to find. If we represent a 2-digit number as ''mb'' + ''n'', where ''b'' is the base and ''m'', ''n'' are integers from 0 to ''b''−1, we need only check each possible combination of ''m'' and ''n'' against the equalities ''mb'' + ''n'' = ''m''<sup>''n''</sup>, and ''mb'' + ''n'' = ''n''<sup>''m''</sup> to see which ones are true. We need not concern ourselves with ''m'' + ''n'' or ''m'' × ''n'', since these will always be smaller than ''mb'' + ''n'' when ''n'' < ''b''. The same clearly holds for ''m'' − ''n'' and ''m''/''n''.\n\n== Other bases ==\nIn [[duodecimal|base 12]], the Friedman numbers less than 1000 are:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|number\n|expression\n|-\n|121\n|11<sup>2</sup>\n|-\n|127\n|7×21\n|-\n|135\n|5×31\n|-\n|144\n|4×41\n|-\n|163\n|3×61\n|-\n|368\n|8<sup>6−3</sup>\n|-\n|376\n|6×73\n|-\n|441\n|(4+1)<sup>4</sup>\n|-\n|445\n|5<sup>4</sup>+4\n|}\n\n== Using Roman numerals ==\nIn a trivial sense, all [[Roman numeral]]s with more than one symbol are Friedman numbers. The expression is created by simply inserting + signs into the numeral, and occasionally the − sign with slight rearrangement of the order of the symbols.\n\nSome research into Roman numeral Friedman numbers for which the expression uses some of the other operators has been done. The first such nice Roman numeral Friedman number discovered was 8, since VIII = (V - I) × II. Other such nontrivial examples have been found.\n\nThe difficulty of finding nontrivial Friedman numbers in Roman numerals increases not with the size of the number (as is the case with [[positional notation]] numbering systems) but with the numbers of symbols it has. For example, it is much tougher to figure out whether 147 (CXLVII) is a Friedman number in Roman numerals than it is to make the same determination for 1001 (MI). With Roman numerals, one can at least derive quite a few Friedman expressions from any new expression one discovers. Since 8 is a nice nontrivial nice Roman numeral Friedman number, it follows that any number ending in VIII is also such a Friedman number.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/mathmagic/0800.html Home page for Friedman numbers]\n*[http://www.numq.com/pwn/ Pretty wild narcissistic numbers - numbers that pwn]\n\n{{Classes of natural numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Base-dependent integer sequences]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Gijswijt's sequence''' (named after [[D.C. Gijswijt]] by [[Neil Sloane]]<ref name=\"OEIS\">{{cite OEIS|1=A090822|2=Gijswijt's sequence: a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) = largest integer k such that the word a(1)a(2)...a(n-1) is of the form xy^k for words x and y (where y has positive length), i.e., the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far}}</ref>) is a [[autogram|self-describing]] [[sequence]] where each term counts the maximum number of repeated blocks of numbers in the sequence immediately preceding that term.\n\nThe sequence begins with:\n\n: 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 1, ... {{OEIS|A090822}}\n\nThe sequence is similar in definition to the [[Kolakoski sequence]], but instead of counting the longest run of single terms, the sequence counts the longest run of blocks of terms of any length.  Gijswijt's sequence is known for its remarkably slow rate of growth.  For example, the first 4 appears at the 220th term, and the first 5 appears near the <math>10^{10^{23}}</math>rd term.<ref name=\"OEIS\" />\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe process to generate terms in the sequence can be defined by looking at the sequence as a series of letters in the [[Formal language#Words over an alphabet|alphabet]] of [[natural numbers]]:\n\n# <math>a(1) = 1</math>, and\n# <math>a(n+1) = k</math>, where <math>k</math> is the largest natural number such that the word <math>a(1)a(2)a(3)...a(n)</math> can be written in the form <math>xy^k</math> for some words <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>, with <math>y</math> having non-zero length.\n\nThe sequence is [[radix|base]]-agnostic. That is, if a run of 10 repeated blocks is found, the next term in the sequence would be a single number 10, not a 1 followed by a 0.\n\n== Explanation ==\n\nThe sequence begins with 1 by definition.  The 1 in the second term then represents the length 1 of the block of 1s that is found immediately before it in the first term.  The 2 in the third term represents the length 2 of the block of 1s that are in the first and second term.  At this point, the sequence decreases for the first time: The 1 in the fourth term represents the length 1 of the block of 2s in the 3rd term, as well as the length 1 of the block \"1, 2\" spanning the second and third term.  There is no block of any repeated sequence immediately preceding the fourth term that is longer than length 1.  The block of two 1s in the first and second term cannot be considered for the 4th term because they are separated by a different number in the 3rd term.\n\nThe 1 in the fifth term represents the length 1 of the \"repeating\" blocks \"1\" and \"2, 1\" and \"1, 2, 1\" and \"1, 1, 2, 1\" that immediately precede the fifth term.  None of these blocks are repeated more than once, so the fifth term is 1.  The 2 in the sixth term represents the length of the repeated block of 1s immediately leading up to the sixth term, namely the ones in the 4th and 5th terms.  The 2 in the seventh term represents the 2 repetitions of the block \"1, 1, 2\" spanning terms 1-3 and then 4-6.  This \"3-number word\" occurs twice immediately leading up to the seventh term - so the value of the seventh term is 2.\n\nThe 2 in the eighth term represents the length of the repeated block of 2s immediately leading up to the eighth term, namely the twos in the sixth and seventh terms.  The 3 in the 9th term represents the thrice-repeated block of single 2s immediately leading up to the 9th term, namely the twos in the sixth, seventh, and eighth terms.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nOnly limited research has focused on Gijswijt's sequence.  As such, very little has been proven about the sequence and many open questions remain unsolved.\n\n=== Rate of growth ===\n\nGiven that 5 does not appear until around <math>10^{10^{23}}</math>, brute force search techniques would never find the first occurrence of a term greater than 4. It has, however, been proven that the sequence contains every natural number.<ref name=\"arx\">{{cite arXiv |last=Gijswijt |first=D.C. |arxiv=math/0602498 |title=A Slow-Growing Sequence Defined by an Unusual Recurrence |date=2006 }}</ref>  The exact rate of growth is not known, but is conjectured to grow [[super-logarithm]]ically, with the first occurrence of any natural <math>n</math> positioned near <math>2^{2^{3^{4^{5^{.^{.^{.{n-1}}}}}}}}</math>.<ref name=\"sloane\">{{cite web|last1=Sloane|first1=Neil|authorlink1=Neil Sloane|title=Seven Staggering Sequences|url=http://neilsloane.com/doc/g4g7.pdf|publisher=AT&T Shannon Lab|page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Average value ===\n\nThough it is known that each natural number occurs at a finite position within the sequence, it has been conjectured that the sequence may have a finite [[mean]].  To define this formally on an infinite sequence, where re-ordering of the terms may matter, the conjecture is that:\n\n: <math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n a(i) < \\infty </math>\n\nLikewise, the [[natural density|density]] of any given natural number within the sequence is not known.<ref name=\"OEIS\" />\n\n=== Recursive structure ===\n\nThe sequence can be broken into discrete \"block\" and \"glue\" sequences, which can be used to recursively build up the sequence.  For example, at the base level, we can define <math>B_1=1</math> and <math>S_1=2</math> as the first block and glue sequences, respectively. Together, we can see how they form the beginning of the sequence:\n\n:<math>B_1B_1S_1 = 1, 1, 2</math>\n\nThe next step is to recursively build up the sequence.  Define <math>B_2 = B_1B_1S_1</math>.  Noting that the sequence starts with <math>B_1B_1</math>, we can define a glue string <math>S_2 = 2,2,3</math> which gives:\n\n:<math>B_2B_2S_2 = 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3</math>\n\nNotice we assigned <math>S_2</math> to a particular sequence which gives the property that <math>B_2B_2S_2B_2B_2S_2</math> also occurs at the top of the sequence.\n\nThis process can be continued indefinitely with <math>B_{n+1} = B_nB_nS_n</math>.  It turns out that we can discover a glue string <math>S_n</math> by noting that <math>S_n</math> will never have a 1, and that it stops once it reaches the first 1 to follow <math>B_nB_n</math>.<ref name=\"sloane\" />  It has also been proven that Gijswijt's sequence can be built up in this fashion indefinitely &#8210; that is, <math>B_n</math> and <math>S_n</math> are always finite in length for any <math>n</math>.<ref name=\"arx\" />\n\nClever manipulation of the glue sequences in this recursive structure can be used to demonstrate that Gijswijt's sequence contains all the natural numbers, among other properties of the sequence.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Look-and-say sequence]]\n* [[Kolakoski sequence]]\n* [[Autogram]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/w7walxrxz3ycdr1/50_000_000.txt?raw=1 First 50 million terms]\n* {{OEIS el|1=A091579|2=Lengths of suffix blocks associated with A090822}} -- (the lengths of the glue sequences)\n: {{OEIS el|1=A090822|2=Gijswijt's sequence|formalname=Gijswijt's sequence: a(1) = 1; for n>1, a(n) = largest integer k such that the word a(1)a(2)...a(n-1) is of the form xy^k for words x and y (where y has positive length), i.e., the maximal number of repeating blocks at the end of the sequence so far}}\n\n[[Category:Base-dependent integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Algebraic numbers]]\n[[Category:Mathematical constants]]\n[[Category:Parity (mathematics)]]"

      "text": "{{short description|Numbers with a certain property involving recursive summation}}\n{{distinguish|text=[[Harshad number]] (derived from Sanskrit ''harśa'' meaning \"great joy\")}}\nA '''happy number''' is defined by the following process: Starting with any [[positive number|positive]] [[integer]], replace the number by the [[summation|sum]] of the squares of its [[numerical digit|digits]] in [[decimal|base-ten]], and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include&nbsp;1.  Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are '''unhappy numbers''' (or '''sad numbers''').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SadNumber.html|title=Sad Number|publisher=Wolfram Research, Inc.|accessdate=2009-09-16}}</ref>\n\n== Origin ==\nThe origin of happy numbers is not clear.  Happy numbers were brought to the attention of [[Reg Allenby]] (a British author and senior lecturer in [[pure mathematics]] at [[Leeds University]]) by his daughter, who had learned of them at school.  However, they \"may have originated in Russia\" {{harvcol|Guy|2004|p=§E34}}.\n\n==Overview==\nMore formally, given a number ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n''<sub>0</sub>, define a sequence ''n''<sub>1</sub>, ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ..., where ''n''<sub>''i''+1</sub> is the sum of the squares of the digits of ''n<sub>i</sub>''.  Then ''n'' is happy if and only if there exists ''i'' such that ''n<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nIf a number is happy, then all members of its sequence are happy; if a number is unhappy, all members of the sequence are unhappy.\n\nFor example, 19 is happy, as the associated sequence is\n: 1<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> = 82,\n: 8<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> = 68,\n: 6<sup>2</sup> + 8<sup>2</sup> = 100,\n: 1<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> + 0<sup>2</sup> = 1.\n\nThe 143 happy numbers up to 1000 are:\n: 1, 7, 10, 13, 19, 23, 28, 31, 32, 44, 49, 68, 70, 79, 82, 86, 91, 94, 97, 100, 103, 109, 129, 130, 133, 139, 167, 176, 188, 190, 192, 193, 203, 208, 219, 226, 230, 236, 239, 262, 263, 280, 291, 293, 301, 302, 310, 313, 319, 320, 326, 329, 331, 338, 356, 362, 365, 367, 368, 376, 379, 383, 386, 391, 392, 397, 404, 409, 440, 446, 464, 469, 478, 487, 490, 496, 536, 556, 563, 565, 566, 608, 617, 622, 623, 632, 635, 637, 638, 644, 649, 653, 655, 656, 665, 671, 673, 680, 683, 694, 700, 709, 716, 736, 739, 748, 761, 763, 784, 790, 793, 802, 806, 818, 820, 833, 836, 847, 860, 863, 874, 881, 888, 899, 901, 904, 907, 910, 912, 913, 921, 923, 931, 932, 937, 940, 946, 964, 970, 973, 989, 998, 1000 {{OEIS|id=A007770}}.\n\nThe happiness of a number is unaffected by rearranging the digits and by inserting or removing any number of zeros anywhere in the number.\n\nThe distinct combinations of digits that form happy numbers below 1000 are (the rest are just rearrangements and/or insertions of zero digits):\n: 1, 7, 13, 19, 23, 28, 44, 49, 68, 79, 129, 133, 139, 167, 188, 226, 236, 239, 338, 356, 367, 368, 379, 446, 469, 478, 556, 566, 888, 899. {{OEIS|id=A124095}}.\n\n==Sequence behavior==\nNumbers that are happy follow a sequence that ends in 1. All unhappy numbers follow sequences that eventually reach the eight-number cycle\n: 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → ...\n\nTo see this fact, first note that if ''n'' has ''m'' digits, then the sum of the squares of its digits is at most 9<sup>2</sup>''m'', or 81''m''.\n\nFor ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and above,\n: <math>n \\geq 10^{m-1} > 81m,</math>\nso any number over 1000 gets smaller under this process and in particular becomes a number with strictly fewer digits.  Once we are under 1000, the number for which the sum of squares of digits is largest is 999, and the result is 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;81&nbsp;=&nbsp;243.\n* In the range 100 to 243, the number 199 produces the largest next value, of 163.\n* In the range 100 to 163, the number 159 produces the largest next value, of 107.\n* In the range 100 to 107, the number 107 produces the largest next value, of 50.\nConsidering more precisely the [[Interval (mathematics)|intervals]] [244,&nbsp;999], [164,&nbsp;243], [108,&nbsp;163] and [100,&nbsp;107], we see that every number above 99 gets strictly smaller under this process.  Thus, no matter what number we start with, we eventually drop below 100. An exhaustive search then shows that every number in the interval [1,&nbsp;99] either is happy or goes to the above unhappy cycle.\n\nThe above work produces the interesting result that no positive integer other than 1 is the sum of the squares of its own digits, since any such number would be a fixed point of the described process.\n\nThere are infinitely many happy numbers and infinitely many unhappy numbers. Consider the following proof:\n* 1 is a happy number, and for every ''n'', 10<sup>''n''</sup> is happy, since its sum is 1.\n* For every ''n'', 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;10<sup>''n''</sup> is unhappy, since its sum is 4, and 4 is an unhappy number.\nIndeed, the ''happiness'' of a number is preserved by removing or inserting zeroes at will, since they do not contribute to the cross sum. See the above proof, especially by appending 0s on the end of the number (multiplying by 10<sup>''n''</sup>).\n\nThe first pair of consecutive happy numbers is 31 and 32.<ref>{{cite OEIS |1=A035502 |2=Lower of pair of consecutive happy numbers |accessdate=8 April 2011}}</ref> The first set of three consecutive is 1880, 1881, and 1882.<ref>{{cite OEIS |1=A072494 |2=First of triples of consecutive happy numbers |accessdate=8 April 2011}}</ref> It has been proved that there exist sequences of consecutive happy numbers of any natural-number length.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |title=Consecutive Happy Numbers |arxiv=math/0607213 |author1=Pan |first1=Hao |year=2006}}</ref> The beginning of the first run of at least ''n'' consecutive happy numbers for ''n''&nbsp;= 1, 2, 3, ... is<ref>{{Cite OEIS |1=A055629 |2=Beginning of first run of at least ''n'' consecutive happy numbers}}</ref>\n: 1, 31, 1880, 7839, 44488, 7899999999999959999999996, 7899999999999959999999996, ...\n\nBy inspection of the first million or so happy numbers, it appears that they have a [[natural density]] of around 0.15.

Paul Jobling discovered the prime in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://primes.utm.edu/primes/page.php?id=76550 |title=The Prime Database: 10<sup>150006</sup> + 7426247 · 10<sup>75000</sup> + 1 |author=Chris K.

Caldwell |work=utm.edu}}</ref>\n\nUnlike happy numbers, rearranging the digits of a happy prime will not necessarily create another happy prime. For instance, while 19 is a happy prime, 91&nbsp;=&nbsp;13&nbsp;×&nbsp;7 is not prime (but is still happy).\n\n==Happy numbers in other bases==\nThe definition of happy numbers depends on the decimal ([[base 10]]) representation of the numbers.  The definition can be extended to other [[Radix|bases]].\n\nTo represent numbers in other bases, we may use a subscript to the right to indicate the base.  For instance, 100<sub>2</sub> represents the number four in [[base 2]], and\n:<math>123_5 = 1 \\cdot 5^2 + 2 \\cdot 5 + 3 =38.</math>\nThen, it is easy to see that there are infinitely many happy numbers in every base.  For instance, the numbers\n:<math>1_b,10_b,100_b,1000_b,... \\quad(= b^n \\text{ for all positive integers } n)</math>\nare all happy, for any base ''b''.\n\nBy a similar argument to the one above for decimal happy numbers, unhappy numbers in base ''b'' lead to cycles of numbers less than 1000<sub>''b''</sub>.  If ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;1000<sub>''b''</sub>, then the sum of the squares of the base-''b'' digits of ''n'' is less than or equal to\n:<math>3(b-1)^2</math>,\nwhich can be shown to be less than ''b''<sup>3</sup>, for ''b''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;5. This shows that once the sequence reaches a number less than 1000<sub>''b''</sub>, it stays below 1000<sub>b</sub>, and hence must cycle or reach 1.\n\nIn base 2, all numbers are happy.  All [[Binary numeral system|binary]] numbers larger than 1000<sub>2</sub> (8<sub>10</sub>) decay into a value equal to or less than 1000<sub>2</sub>, and all such values are happy:\n:<math> 111_2 \\rightarrow 11_2 \\rightarrow 10_2 \\rightarrow 1 </math>\n:<math> 110_2 \\rightarrow 10_2 \\rightarrow 1 </math>\n:<math> 101_2 \\rightarrow 10_2 \\rightarrow 1 </math>\n:<math> 100_2 \\rightarrow 1. </math>\nSince all sequences lead to 1, we conclude that all numbers are happy in base 2.  This makes base 2 a ''happy base''.\n\nThe only known happy bases are 2 and 4.  There are no others less than {{val|5e8}}.<ref>{{Cite OEIS|sequencenumber=A161872|name=Smallest unhappy number in base n}}</ref>\n\nBase 3 is also a special case in that the happiness (or sadness) of a number is an indication also of being odd (or even).  Specifically, because 3&nbsp;−&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, the sum of every digit of a base-3 number will indicate divisibility by 2 [[if and only if]] the sum of digits ends in 0 or 2.  This is the general application of the test for divisibility by 9 in base 10.  In [[balanced ternary]], the digits are 1, −1 and 0.  The square of both 1 and −1 are 1, and 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is 2, which is the only balanced ternary cycle.  For every pair of digits 1 or −1, their sum is 0 and the sum of their squares is 2 and if there are an even number of {1,&nbsp;−1} sets, the number divisible by 2 and sad and if odd, it is happy.  In this case, the result always end in a one-digit cycle of 0, 1 or 2, repeated infinitely.  In [[Ternary numeral system|unbalanced ternary]], the digits square to 1 and 4<sub>10</sub> (11<sub>3</sub>,) and in this case there are five loops: 0, 1, {{nowrap|2 → 11<sub>3</sub> → 2}}, 12<sub>3</sub> (5<sub>10</sub>), and 22<sub>3</sub> (8<sub>10</sub>).  While all even numbers are sad because they end in the 0, 2 or 22<sub>3</sub> cycle, some odd numbers are also sad because they end in 12<sub>3</sub> or 1, and are thus occasionally sad.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\nIn [[duodecimal|base 12]], there is no other happy number between 10 (decimal [[12 (number)|12]]) and 100 (decimal [[144 (number)|144]]), there are three fixed points: 1, 25<sub>12</sub>, ↊5<sub>12</sub>, and four cycles:\n\n:5 → 21 → 5\n:8 → 54 → 35 → 2↊ → 88 → ↊8 → 118 → 56 → 51 → 22 → 8\n:18 → 55 → 42 → 18\n:68 → 84 → 68\n\nThe numbers 25<sub>12</sub> (29<sub>10</sub>) and ↊5<sub>12</sub> (125<sub>10</sub>) are [[Armstrong number]]s in base 12 {{oeis|id=A161949}}; there are no two-digit Armstrong numbers in base 10.\n\nIn [[hexadecimal|base 16]], there is only one fixed point: 1, and one cycle:\n:D → A9 → B5 → 92 → 55 → 32 → D\n\nThe status in base 16 is similar to base 10.\n\n==Cubing the digits rather than squaring==\nA variation to the happy numbers problem is to find the sum of the cubes of the digits rather than the sum of the squares of the digits. For example, working in base 10, 1579 is happy, since:\n\n: 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 7<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 125 + 343 + 729 = 1198\n: 1<sup>3</sup> + 1<sup>3</sup> + 9<sup>3</sup> + 8<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 1 + 729 + 512 = 1243\n: 1<sup>3</sup> + 2<sup>3</sup> + 4<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 1 + 8 + 64 + 27 = 100\n: 1<sup>3</sup> + 0<sup>3</sup> + 0<sup>3</sup> = 1\n\nIn the same way that when summing the squares of the digits (and working in base 10) each number above 243 (=&nbsp;3&nbsp;×&nbsp;9<sup>2</sup>) produces a number that is strictly smaller, when summing the cubes of the digits each number above 2916 (=&nbsp;4&nbsp;×&nbsp;9<sup>3</sup>) produces a number that is strictly smaller.\n\nBy conducting an exhaustive search of [1,&nbsp;2916] one finds that for summing the cubes of digits base 10 there are happy numbers and eight different types of unhappy number:\n\n*those that eventually reach 153, 370, 371, or 407, which perpetually produce themselves; and\n*those that eventually reach one of the loops:\n:: 133 → 55 → 250 → 133\n:: 217 → 352 → 160 → 217\n:: 1459 → 919 → 1459\n:: 136 → 244 →136\n\nAll multiples of three terminate at 153. This fact can be proved by the exhaustive search up and noting that a number is a multiple of three if and only if the sum of digits is a multiple of three if and only if the sum of its cubed digits are a multiple of three. By similar reasoning, all happy numbers when summing up odd powers (e.g. cubes, fifth powers, seventh powers, etc.) of their digits must have a remainder of 1 when dividing by 3.\n\nAll numbers that are congruent to 2 [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 3 terminate at either 371 or 407.\n\nThe only positive whole numbers that are the sum of the cubes of their digits are 1, 153, 370, 371 and 407 {{OEIS|id=A046197}}.\n\n== Higher powers ==\nFor higher powers, the density of happy numbers declines. \n\nTaking the sum of the fourth powers of the digits, one can find that most numbers between 1 and 100 end in the loop:\n\n: 13139 → 6725 → 4338 → 4514 → 1138 → 4179 → 9219 → 13139,\n\nor alternate between 2178 and 6514, or terminate at 1634, 8208 or 9474 which perpetually produce themselves.\n\n==Programming example==\nThe examples below apply the 'happy' process described in the definition of happy given at the top of this article, repeatedly; after each time, they check for both halt conditions: reaching 1, and repeating a number. Everything else is bookkeeping (for example, the Python example precomputes the squares of all 10 digits).\n\nA simple test in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] to check if a number is happy:<ref>[http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Happy_Number Happy Number] Rosetta Code</ref>\n<source lang=python>\ndef square(x):\n    return int(x) * int(x)\n\ndef happy(number):\n    return sum(map(square, list(str(number))))\n\ndef is_happy(number):\n    seen_numbers = set()\n    while number > 1 and (number not in seen_numbers):\n        seen_numbers.add(number)\n        number = happy(number)\n    return number == 1\n</source>\n\nWhen the algorithm ends in a cycle of repeating numbers, this cycle always includes the number 4, so it is not even necessary to store previous numbers in the sequence:\n<source lang=python>\ndef is_happy(n):\n    return (n == 1 or n > 4 and is_happy(happy(n)))\n</source>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fortunate number]]\n*[[Harshad number]]\n*[[Lucky number]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Literature==\n* {{Cite book\n | last = Guy\n | first = Richard\n | authorlink = Richard K.

      "text": "In [[recreational mathematics]], a '''harshad number''' (or '''Niven number''') in a given [[number base]], is an [[integer]] that is divisible by the [[digit sum|sum of its digits]] when written in that base.\nHarshad numbers in base {{mvar|n}} are also known as '''{{mvar|n}}-harshad''' (or '''{{mvar|n}}-Niven''') numbers.\nHarshad numbers were defined by [[D. R. Kaprekar]], a [[mathematician]] from [[India]]. The word \"harshad\" comes from the [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|harṣa}}'' (joy) + ''{{IAST|da}}'' (give), meaning joy-giver. The term “Niven number” arose from a paper delivered by [[Ivan M. Niven]] at a conference on [[number theory]] in 1977. All integers between [[0 (number)|zero]] and {{mvar|n}} are {{mvar|n}}-harshad numbers.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nStated mathematically, let {{mvar|X}} be a positive integer with {{mvar|m}} digits when written in base {{mvar|n}}, and let the digits be <math>a_i</math> (<math>i = 0, 1, \\cdots, m-1</math>). (It follows that <math>a_i</math> must be either zero or a positive integer up to {{tmath|n-1}}.) {{mvar|X}} can be expressed as\n\n:<math>X=\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i n^i.</math>\n\nIf there exists an integer {{mvar|A}} such that the following holds, then {{mvar|X}} is a harshad number in base {{mvar|n}}:\n\n:<math>X=A\\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i.</math>\n\n{{anchor|all-harshad number}}\nA number which is a harshad number in every number base is called an '''all-harshad number''', or an '''all-Niven number'''. There are only four all-harshad numbers: [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[4 (number)|4]], and [[6 (number)|6]] (The number [[12 (number)|12]] is a harshad number in all bases except [[octal]]).\n\n== Examples ==\n* The number 18 is a harshad number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 8 is 9 (1 + 8 = 9), and 18 is [[divisible]] by 9.\n* The [[1729 (number)|Hardy–Ramanujan number (1729)]] is a harshad number in base 10, since it is divisible by 19, the sum of its digits (1729 = 19 × 91).\n* The number 19 is not a harshad number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 9 is 10 (1 + 9 = 10), and 19 is not divisible by 10.\n* Harshad numbers in [[base 10]] form the sequence:\n*: [[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[5 (number)|5]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[7 (number)|7]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[9 (number)|9]], [[10 (number)|10]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[18 (number)|18]], [[20 (number)|20]], [[21 (number)|21]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[27 (number)|27]], [[30 (number)|30]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[40 (number)|40]], [[42 (number)|42]], [[45 (number)|45]], [[48 (number)|48]], [[50 (number)|50]], [[54 (number)|54]], [[60 (number)|60]], [[63 (number)|63]], [[70 (number)|70]], [[72 (number)|72]], [[80 (number)|80]], [[81 (number)|81]], [[84 (number)|84]], [[90 (number)|90]], [[100 (number)|100]], [[102 (number)|102]], [[108 (number)|108]], [[110 (number)|110]], [[111 (number)|111]], [[112 (number)|112]], [[114 (number)|114]], [[117 (number)|117]], [[120 (number)|120]], [[126 (number)|126]], [[132 (number)|132]], [[133 (number)|133]], [[135 (number)|135]], [[140 (number)|140]], [[144 (number)|144]], [[150 (number)|150]], [[152 (number)|152]], [[153 (number)|153]], [[156 (number)|156]], [[162 (number)|162]], [[171 (number)|171]], [[180 (number)|180]], [[190 (number)|190]], [[192 (number)|192]], [[195 (number)|195]], [[198 (number)|198]], [[200 (number)|200]], ...  {{OEIS|id=A005349}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nGiven the [[divisibility test]] for [[9 (number)|9]], one might be tempted to generalize that all numbers divisible by 9 are also harshad numbers. But for the purpose of determining the harshadness of {{mvar|n}}, the digits of {{mvar|n}} can only be added up once and {{mvar|n}} must be divisible by that sum; otherwise, it is not a harshad number. For example, [[99 (number)|99]] is not a harshad number, since 9 + 9 = 18, and 99 is not divisible by 18.\n\nThe base number (and furthermore, its powers) will always be a harshad number in its own base, since it will be represented as \"10\" and 1 + 0 = 1.\n\nAll numbers whose base ''b'' digit sum divides ''b''−1 are harshad numbers in base ''b''.\n\nFor a [[prime number]] to also be a harshad number, it must be less than or equal to the base number. Otherwise, the digits of the prime will add up to a number that is more than 1 but less than the prime and, obviously, it will not be divisible. For example: 11 is not harshad in base 10 because the sum of its digits \"11\" is 1 + 1 = 2, and 11 is not divisible by 2, while in [[base 12]] the number 11 may be represented as \"Ɛ\", the sum of whose digits is also Ɛ and clearly Ɛ is divisible by Ɛ, thus it is harshad in base 12.\n\nAlthough the sequence of [[factorial]]s starts with harshad numbers in base 10, not all factorials are harshad numbers. 432! is the first that is not. (432! has digit sum = 3897 = 3<sup>2</sup>×433 in base 10, thus not divide 432!)\n\nSmallest {{mvar|k}} such that <math>k \\cdot n</math> is a harshad number are\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 10, 1, 9, 3, 2, 3, 6, 1, 6, 1, 1, 5, 9, 1, 2, 6, 1, 3, 9, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 10, 1, 12, 3, 1, 5, 9, 1, 8, 1, 2, 3, 18, 1, 2, 2, 2, 9, 9, 1, 12, 6, 1, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 18, 1, 7, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 9, 1, ... {{OEIS|id=A144261}}.\n\nSmallest {{mvar|k}} such that <math>k \\cdot n</math> is not a harshad number are\n:11, 7, 5, 4, 3, 11, 2, 2, 11, 13, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 161, 1, 8, 5, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 83, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 1, 1, 11, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 537, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 83, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 68, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, ... {{OEIS|id=A144262}}.\n\n== Other bases ==\nThe harshad numbers in [[duodecimal|base 12]] are:\n:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ᘔ, Ɛ, 10, 1ᘔ, 20, 29, 30, 38, 40, 47, 50, 56, 60, 65, 70, 74, 80, 83, 90, 92, ᘔ0, ᘔ1, Ɛ0, 100, 10ᘔ, 110, 115, 119, 120, 122, 128, 130, 134, 137, 146, 150, 153, 155, 164, 172, 173, 182, 191, 1ᘔ0, 1Ɛ0, 1Ɛᘔ, 200, ...\n\nSmallest {{mvar|k}} such that <math>k \\cdot n</math> is a base-12 harshad number are (written in base 10):\n:1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 10, 2, 11, 3, 4, 1, 7, 1, 12, 6, 4, 3, 11, 2, 11, 3, 1, 5, 9, 1, 12, 11, 4, 3, 11, 2, 11, 1, 4, 4, 11, 1, 16, 6, 4, 3, 11, 2, 1, 3, 11, 11, 11, 1, 12, 11, 5, 7, 9, 1, 7, 3, 3, 9, 11, 1, ...\n\nSmallest {{mvar|k}} such that <math>k \\cdot n</math> is not a base-12 harshad number are (written in base 10):\n:13, 7, 5, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 13, 16, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 157, 1, 8, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 13, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 157, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1885, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, ...\n\nSimilar to base 10, not all factorials are harshad numbers in base 12.

a relatively large power, and ''N'' is a constant.\nGiven one such suitably chosen sequence, we can convert it to a larger one as follows:\n* Inserting zeroes into ''N'' will not change the sequence of digital sums (just as 21, 201 and 2001 are all 10-harshad numbers).\n* If we insert ''n'' zeroes after the first digit, ''α'' (worth ''αb<sup>i</sup>''), we increase the value of ''N'' by ''αb<sup>i</sup>''(''b<sup>n</sup>'' − 1).\n* If we can ensure that ''b<sup>n</sup>'' − 1 is divisible by all digit sums in the sequence, then the divisibility by those sums is maintained.\n* If our initial sequence is chosen so that the digit sums are [[coprime]] to ''b'', we can solve ''b<sup>n</sup>'' = 1 modulo all those sums.\n* If that is not so, but the part of each digit sum not coprime to ''b'' divides ''αb<sup>i</sup>'', then divisibility is still maintained.\n* ''(Unproven)'' The initial sequence is so chosen.\nThus <!-- any solution implies --> our initial sequence yields an

      "text": "{{distinguish|Kaprekar's constant}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[non-negative]] [[integer]] is called a \"'''Kaprekar number'''\" for a given [[base (exponentiation)|base]] if  the representation of its square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number, with the proviso that the part formed from the low-order digits of the square must be non-zero—although it is allowed to include ''leading'' zeroes. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2025 and 20&nbsp;+&nbsp;25&nbsp;=&nbsp;45. The number 1 is Kaprekar in every base, because 1<sup>2</sup> = 01&nbsp;&nbsp; in any base, and&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 + 1 = 1.  Kaprekar numbers are named after [[D. R. Kaprekar]].\n\n== Definition ==\nLet  &nbsp;''X''&nbsp;  be a non-negative integer and &nbsp;''n''&nbsp; a positive integer. &nbsp;''X''&nbsp; is an ''n''-Kaprekar number for base &nbsp;''b''&nbsp; if there exist non-negative integer &nbsp;''A'', and positive integer &nbsp;''B''&nbsp; satisfying:\n\n: ''X''<sup>2</sup> = ''Ab<sup>n</sup>'' + ''B'', where 0 &lt; ''B'' &lt; ''b<sup>n</sup>''\n: ''X'' = ''A'' + ''B''\n\nIf &nbsp;''d''&nbsp; is any divisor  of &nbsp;''n'', then &nbsp;''X''&nbsp; is also a ''d''-Kaprekar number for base &nbsp;''b<sup>n</sup>''.  A Kaprekar number for base &nbsp;''b''&nbsp; is one which is an ''n''-Kaprekar number for that base and some positive integer &nbsp;''n''.\n\nMore generally, we can define the set &nbsp;''K''(''N'')&nbsp; for a given integer &nbsp;''N''&nbsp; as the set of integers &nbsp;''X''&nbsp; for which<ref name=iannucci>Iannucci ([[#CITEREFIannucci2000|2000]])</ref>\n: ''X''<sup>2</sup> = ''AN'' + ''B'', where 0 &lt; ''B'' < ''N''\n: ''X'' = ''A'' + ''B''\nAn ''n''-Kaprekar number for base &nbsp;''b''&nbsp; is then one which lies in the set &nbsp;''K''(''b''<sup>''n''</sup>), and a Kaprekar number for base &nbsp;''b''&nbsp; is one which lies in any one of the sets &nbsp;''K''(''b''), ''K''(''b''<sup>2</sup>), ''K''(''b''<sup>3</sup>),….\n\n== Examples ==\n\n297 is a Kaprekar number for base 10, because 297<sup>2</sup> = 88209, which can be split into 88 and 209, and 88 + 209 = 297. By convention, the second part may start with the digit 0, but must be nonzero. For example, 999 is a Kaprekar number for base 10, because 999<sup>2</sup> = 998001, which can be split into 998 and 001, and 998 + 001 = 999. But 100 is not; although 100<sup>2</sup> = 10000 and 100 + 00 = 100, the second part here is zero (i.e. not a positive integer).\n\nThe first few Kaprekar numbers in base 10 are:\n:1, 9, 45, 55, 99, 297, 703, 999, 2223, 2728, 4879, 4950, 5050, 5292, 7272, 7777, 9999, 17344, 22222, 38962, 77778, 82656, 95121, 99999, [[142857]], 148149, 181819, 187110, 208495, 318682, 329967, 351352, 356643, 390313, 461539, 466830, 499500, ...  {{OEIS|id=A006886}}\n\nIn particular, 9, 99, 999… are all Kaprekar numbers.

Then the function &nbsp;''ζ''&nbsp; is a bijection from the set of unitary divisors of &nbsp;''N'' − 1&nbsp; onto the set &nbsp;''K''(''N'').  In particular, a number &nbsp;''X''&nbsp; is in the set &nbsp;''K''(''N'')&nbsp; if and only if &nbsp;{{nowrap|1=''X'' = ''d'' Inv(''d'', (''N'' − 1)/''d'')}}&nbsp; for some unitary divisor &nbsp;''d''&nbsp; of &nbsp;''N''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1.\n* The numbers in &nbsp;''K''(''N'')&nbsp; occur in complementary pairs, &nbsp;''X''&nbsp; and &nbsp;''N'' − ''X''.

Then continue the sequence, where each subsequent term is the sum of the previous ''n'' terms. By definition, ''N'' is a Keith number if ''N'' appears in the sequence thus constructed.\n\nAs an example, consider the 3-digit number ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;197. The sequence goes like this:\n:'''1''', '''9''', '''7''', 17, 33, 57, 107, 197, 361, ...\nBecause 197 appears in the sequence, 197 is seen to be indeed a Keith number.\n\n==Definition==\nA Keith number is a positive integer ''N'' that appears as a term in a linear [[recurrence relation]] with initial terms based on its own decimal digits. Given an ''n''-digit number\n:<math>N=\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 10^i  {d_i},</math>\na sequence <math>S_N</math> is formed with initial terms <math>d_{n-1}, d_{n-2},\\ldots, d_1, d_0</math> and with a general term produced as the sum of the previous ''n'' terms. If the number ''N'' appears in the sequence <math>S_N</math>, then ''N'' is said to be a Keith number. One-digit numbers possess the Keith property trivially, and are usually excluded.\n\n==Finding Keith numbers==\nWhether or not there are infinitely many Keith numbers is currently a matter of speculation. Keith numbers are rare and hard to find. They can be found by exhaustive search, and no more efficient algorithm is known.<ref>{{cite web | last1 = Earls | first1 = Jason | last2 = Lichtblau | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Weisstein | first3 = Eric W. | authorlink = Eric W.

For example:\n\n* 1 is read off as \"one 1\" or 11.\n* 11 is read off as \"two 1s\" or 21.\n* 21 is read off as \"one 2, then one 1\" or 1211.\n* 1211 is read off as \"one 1, one 2, then two 1s\" or 111221.\n* 111221 is read off as \"three 1s, two 2s, then one 1\" or 312211.\n\nThe look-and-say sequence was introduced and analyzed by [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=John|title=The Weird and Wonderful Chemistry of Audioactive Decay|journal=Eureka|date=January 1986|volume=46|pages=5–16|url=http://www.archim.org.uk/archives/eureka/#46|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011160655/http://www.archim.org.uk/archives/eureka/#46|archivedate=2014-10-11|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the look-and-say sequence is similar to that of [[run-length encoding]].\n\nIf started with any digit ''d'' from 0 to 9 then ''d'' will remain indefinitely as the last digit of the sequence. For ''d'' different from 1, the sequence starts as follows:\n: ''d'', 1''d'', 111''d'', 311''d'', 13211''d'', 111312211''d'', 31131122211''d'', …\nIlan Vardi has called this sequence, starting with ''d'' = 3, the '''Conway sequence''' {{OEIS|id=A006715}}.

For example, to form the \"pea pattern\" one reads the previous term and counts all instances of each digit, listed in order of their first appearance, not just those occurring in a consecutive block.  Thus, beginning with the seed 1, the pea pattern proceeds 1, 11 (\"one 1\"), 21 (\"two 1s\"), 1211 (\"one 2 and one 1\"), 3112 (three 1s and one 2), 132112 (\"one 3, two 1s and one 2\"), 311322 (\"three 1s, one 3 and two 2s\"), etc.  This version of the pea pattern eventually forms a cycle with the two terms 23322114 and 32232114.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/4642/ascending-pea-pattern-generator|title=Ascending Pea Pattern generator|website=codegolf.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-05-07}}</ref>\n\nOther versions of the pea pattern are also possible; for example, instead of reading the digits as they first appear, one could read them in ascending order instead.  In this case, the term following 21 would be 1112 (\"one 1, one 2\") and the term following 3112 would be 211213 (\"two 1s, one 2 and one 3\").\n\nThese sequences differ in several notable ways from the look-and-say sequence.  Notably, unlike the Conway sequences, a given term of the pea pattern does not uniquely define the preceding term.  Moreover, for any seed the pea pattern produces terms of bounded length. This bound will not typically exceed 2 * [[radix]] + 2 digits and may only exceed 3 * [[radix]] digits in length for degenerate long initial seeds (\"100 ones, etc\"). For these maximum bounded cases, individual elements of the sequence take the form a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7i8j9 for [[decimal]] where the letters here are placeholders for the digit counts from the preceding element of the sequence. Given that this sequence is infinite and the length is bounded, it must eventually repeat due to the [[pigeonhole principle]]. As a consequence, these sequences are always eventually [[periodic sequence|periodic]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gijswijt's sequence]]\n* [[Kolakoski sequence]]\n* [[Autogram]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA Conway speaking about this sequence] and telling that it took him some explanations to understand the sequence.\n* [https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence Implementations in many programming languages] on [[Rosetta Code]]\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=LookandSaySequence|title=Look and Say Sequence}}\n* [http://www.se16.info/js/looknsay.htm Look and Say sequence generator] p\n* {{OEIS el|sequencenumber=A014715|name=Decimal expansion of Conway's constant}}\n* [http://www.nathanieljohnston.com/2010/10/a-derivation-of-conways-degree-71-look-and-say-polynomial/ A Derivation of Conway’s Degree-71 “Look-and-Say” Polynomial]\n\n{{Algebraic numbers}}\n\n[[Category:Base-dependent integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Algebraic numbers]]\n[[Category:Mathematical constants]]"

      "text": "'''Missing-digit sums''' are [[integer]] numbers that are equal to the [[summation|sum]] of numbers created by deleting one or more [[numerical digit|digits]] at a time from the original number. For example, the [[Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|OEIS]] lists these two integers as missing-digit sums in [[decimal|base ten]]:\n\n:1,729,404 = 729404 (missing 1) + 129404 (missing 7) + 179404 (missing 2) + 172404 + 172904 + 172944 + 172940\n:1,800,000 = 800000 (missing 1) + 100000 (missing 8) + 180000 (missing first 0) + 180000 + 180000 + 180000 + 180000<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oeis.org/A131639 |title=Sequence A131639 |author=Jon Ayres|accessdate=10 March 2014 |publisher=Neil Sloane}}</ref>\n\nMissing-digit sums are therefore a [[subset]] of [[narcissistic number]]s, when these are defined as numbers that are equal to some manipulation of their own digits (for example, 153 and 132 are narcissistic numbers in base ten because 153 = 1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> and 132 = 13 + 32 + 12 + 31 + 23 + 21).\n\n==Dropping two and more digits==\n\nWhen one digit is dropped from a ''d''-digit integer, there are ''d'' integers in the sum and each is ''d''-1 digits long. In general, when ''n'' digits are dropped from a ''d''-digit integer, the number of integers in the sum is equal to [[factorial|''d''! / (''n''!(''d'' - ''n'')!)]], or the [[combination]] of ''n'' digits taken 2, 3, 4... at a time. For example, when ''d'' = 20 and ''n'' = 3, there are 20! / (3!(20 - 3)!) = 1,140 integers in the sum. In base ten, the integers31171093 01159390698 and 47989422298181591480943 are equal to their missing-digit sums when dropping two, three and four digits, respectively. Here is the delete-2 sum, containing 12! / (2!(12 - 2)!) = 66 integers:\n\n:183477122641 = 3477122641 (missing 1 and 8) + 8477122641 (missing 1 and 3) + 8377122641 (missing 1 and 4) + 8347122641 (missing 1 and first 7) + 8347122641 (missing 1 and second 7) + 8347722641 (missing 1 and second 1) + 8347712641 + 8347712641 + 8347712241 + 8347712261 + 8347712264 + 1477122641 + 1377122641 + 1347122641 + 1347122641 + 1347722641 + 1347712641 + 1347712641 + 1347712241 + 1347712261 + 1347712264 + 1877122641 + 1847122641 + 1847122641 + 1847722641 + 1847712641 + 1847712641 + 1847712241 + 1847712261 + 1847712264 + 1837122641 + 1837122641 + 1837722641 + 1837712641 + 1837712641 + 1837712241 + 1837712261 + 1837712264 + 1834122641 + 1834722641 + 1834712641 + 1834712641 + 1834712241 + 1834712261 + 1834712264 + 1834722641 + 1834712641 + 1834712641 + 1834712241 + 1834712261 + 1834712264 + 1834772641 + 1834772641 + 1834772241 + 1834772261 + 1834772264 + 1834771641 + 1834771241 + 1834771261 + 1834771264 + 1834771241 + 1834771261 + 1834771264 + 1834771221 + 1834771224 + 1834771226\n\n==Trivial missing-digit sums==\n\nIn any base ''b'', there will be a set of delete-1 missing-digit sums with ''b''+1 digits and first digits in the range 1...''b''-1, followed by ''b'' [[zero]]es. Consider base-2 and base-3:\n\n:100<sub>b=2</sub> = 4<sub>b=10</sub> = 00<sub>b=2</sub> (deleting 1) + 10<sub>b=2</sub> (deleting first 0) + 10<sub>b=2</sub> (deleting second 0)\n:: = 0 + 10<sub>b=2</sub> + 10<sub>b=2</sub>\n:::= 0 + 10<sub>b=2</sub> x 10<sub>b=2</sub> = 100<sub>b=2</sub>\n::::= 0 + 2 x 2 = 4<sub>b=10</sub>\n\n:1000<sub>b=3</sub> = 27<sub>b=10</sub> = 000<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting 1) + 100<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting first 0) + 100<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting second 0) + 100<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting third 0)\n::= 0 + 100<sub>b=3</sub> + 100<sub>b=3</sub> + 100<sub>b=3</sub>\n:::= 0 + 10<sub>b=3</sub> x 100<sub>b=3</sub> = 1000<sub>b=3</sub>\n::::= 0 + 3 x 9 = 27<sub>b=10</sub>\n\n:2000<sub>b=3</sub> = 54<sub>b=10</sub> = 000<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting 2) + 200<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting first 0) + 200<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting second 0) + 200<sub>b=3</sub> (deleting third 0)\n:: = 0 + 200<sub>b=3</sub> + 200<sub>b=3</sub> + 200<sub>b=3</sub>\n::: = 0 + 10<sub>b=3</sub> x 200<sub>b=3</sub> = 2000<sub>b=3</sub>\n::::= 0 + 3 x 18 = 54<sub>b=10</sub>\n\nAccordingly, the eleven-digit numbers 10,000,000,000 through 90,000,000,000 are trivial missing-digit sums in base ten, because their sums take this form:\n\n:10,000,000,000 = 0,000,000,000 (deleting 1) + 1,000,000,000 (deleting first 0) + 1,000,000,000 (deleting second 0) + 1,000,000,000 (deleting third 0) + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000 + 1,000,000,000\n::= 0 + (10 x 1,000,000,000) = 10,000,000,000\n\nAnd in [[hexadecimal]] or base sixteen, the seventeen-digit numbers 10,000,000,000,000,000 through F0,000,000,000,000,000 are missing-digit sums of the same form.\n\n==Searching for missing-digit sums==\n\nSearching for delete-1 missing-digit sums is simplified when one notes that the final two digits of ''n'' determine the final digit of its missing-digit sum. One can therefore test simply the final two digits of a given ''n'' to determine whether or not it is a potential missing-digit sum. In this way, the [[Feasible region|search-space]] is considerably reduced.\nFor example, consider the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of seven-digit base-ten numbers ending in ...01. For these numbers, the final digit of the sum is equal to (digit-0 x 1 + digit-1 x 6) [[modulo operation|modulo]] 10 = (0 + 6) mod 10 = 6 mod 10 = 6. Therefore, no seven-digit number ending in ...01 is equal to its own missing-digit-sum in base ten.\n \nNow consider the set of seven-digit numbers ending in ...04. For these numbers, the final digit of the sum is equal to (0 x 1 + 4 x 6) [[modulo operation|modulo]] 10 = (0 + 24) mod 10 = 24 mod 10 = 4. This set may therefore contain one or more missing-digit sums. Next consider seven-digit numbers ending ...404. The penultimate (last-but-one) digit of the sum is equal to (2 + 4 x 2 + 0 x 4) modulo 10 = (2 + 8 + 0) mod 10 = 10 mod 10 = 0 (where the 2 is the tens digit of 24 from the sum for the final digit). This set of numbers ending ...404 may therefore contain one or more missing-digit sums.

This definition depends on the base ''b'' of the number system used, e.g., ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 for the [[decimal|decimal system]] or ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 for the [[binary numeral system|binary system]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe definition of a narcissistic number relies on the decimal representation ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub>''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>...''d''<sub>1</sub> of a [[natural number]]&nbsp;''n'', i.e.,\n:''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub>·10<sup>''k''-1</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>·10<sup>''k''-2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub>·10&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>1</sub>,\nwith ''k'' digits ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfying 1&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;9, and 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''d''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;9 for ''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''. Such a number ''n'' is called narcissistic if it satisfies the condition\n:''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub><sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub><sup>''k''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>1</sub><sup>''k''</sup>.\nFor example, the 3-digit decimal number 153 is a narcissistic number because 153&nbsp;=&nbsp;1<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;3<sup>3</sup>.\n\nNarcissistic numbers can also be defined with respect to [[numeral system]]s with a base ''b'' other than ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10. The base-''b'' representation of a natural number ''n'' is defined by\n:''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub>''b''<sup>''k''-1</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub>''b''<sup>''k''-2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub>''b''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>1</sub>,\nwhere the base-''b'' digits ''d''<sub>''i''</sub> satisfy the condition 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''d''<sub>i</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''b''-1.\nFor example, the (decimal) number 17 is a narcissistic number with respect to the numeral system with base ''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. Its three base-3 digits are 122, because 17&nbsp;=&nbsp;1·3<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2·3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;, and it satisfies the equation 17&nbsp;=&nbsp;1<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;2<sup>3</sup>.\n\nIf the constraint that the power must equal the number of digits is dropped, so that for some ''m'' possibly different from ''k'' it happens that\n:''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''</sub><sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>''k''-1</sub><sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>2</sub><sup>''m''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''<sub>1</sub><sup>''m''</sup>,\nthen ''n'' is called a '''perfect digital invariant''' or '''PDI'''.<ref name=\"moore\"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123639/http://www.geocities.com/~harveyh/narciss.htm  PDIs] by Harvey Heinz</ref> For example, the decimal number 4150 has four decimal digits and is the sum of the ''fifth'' powers of its decimal digits\n:4150&nbsp;=&nbsp;4<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;5<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;0<sup>5</sup>,\nso it is a perfect digital invariant but ''not'' a narcissistic number.\n\nIn \"[[A Mathematician's Apology]]\", [[G.

      "title": "Palindromic number",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number",
      "text": "A '''palindromic number''' (also known as a '''numeral palindrome''' or a '''numeric palindrome''') is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. Like 16461, for example, it is \"symmetrical\". The term ''palindromic'' is derived from [[palindrome]], which refers to a word (such as ''rotor'' or ''racecar'') whose spelling is unchanged when its letters are reversed. The first 30 palindromic numbers (in [[decimal]]) are:\n:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, &hellip; {{OEIS|id=A002113}}.\n\nPalindromic numbers receive most attention in the realm of [[recreational mathematics]]. A typical problem asks for numbers that possess a certain property ''and'' are palindromic. For instance:\n* The [[palindromic prime]]s are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, … {{OEIS|id=A002385}}.\n* The palindromic [[square number]]s are 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, … {{OEIS|id=A002779}}.\n[[Buckminster Fuller]] identified a set of numbers he called '''Scheherazade numbers''', some of which have a palindromic symmetry of digit groups.\n\nIt is fairly straightforward to appreciate (and prove) that in any [[base (exponentiation)|base]] there are [[Infinite set|infinitely many]] palindromic numbers, since in any base the infinite [[sequence]] of numbers written (in that base) as 101, 1001, 10001, etc. (in which the ''n''th number is a 1, followed by ''n'' zeros, followed by a 1) consists of palindromic numbers only.\n\n==Formal definition==\nAlthough palindromic numbers are most often considered in the [[decimal]] system, the concept of '''palindromicity''' can be applied to the [[natural numbers]] in any [[numeral system]]. Consider a number ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 in [[radix|base]] ''b''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2, where it is written in standard notation with ''k''+1 [[numerical digit|digit]]s ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> as:\n:<math>n=\\sum_{i=0}^ka_ib^i</math>\nwith, as usual, 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'' for all ''i'' and ''a''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;≠&nbsp;0. Then ''n'' is palindromic if and only if ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''<sub>''k''&minus;''i''</sub> for all ''i''. [[0 (number)|Zero]] is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.\n\n==Decimal palindromic numbers==\nDecimal palindromic numbers with an even number of digits are divisible by 11.\n\nAll numbers in [[Decimal|base 10]] (and indeed in any base) with one [[numerical digit|digit]] are palindromic. The number of palindromic numbers with two digits is 9:\n:{11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}.\nThere are 90 palindromic numbers with three digits (Using the [[Rule of product]]: 9 choices for the first digit - which determines the third digit as well - multiplied by 10 choices for the second digit):\n:{101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, …, 909, 919, 929, 939, 949, 959, 969, 979, 989, 999}\nand also 90 palindromic numbers with four digits: (Again, 9 choices for the first digit multiplied by ten choices for the second digit. The other two digits are determined by the choice of the first two)\n:{1001, 1111, 1221, 1331, 1441, 1551, 1661, 1771, 1881, 1991, …, 9009, 9119, 9229, 9339, 9449, 9559, 9669, 9779, 9889, 9999},\nso there are 199 palindromic numbers below 10<sup>4</sup>.

For example, the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] palindromic numbers are:\n:0, 1, 11, 101, 111, 1001, 1111, 10001, 10101, 11011, 11111, 100001, &hellip;\nor in decimal: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 15, 17, 21, 27, 31, 33, … {{OEIS|id=A006995}}. The [[Fermat prime]]s and the [[Mersenne prime]]s form a subset of the binary palindromic primes.\n\nAll numbers are palindromic in an infinite number of bases. But, it's more interesting to consider bases smaller than the number itself - in which case most numbers are palindromic in more than one base, for example, <math>1221_4=151_8=77_{14}=55_{20}=33_{34}=11_{104}</math>, <math>1991_{10}=7C7_{16}</math>\n\nIn [[base 7]], because 101<sub>7</sub> is twice a perfect square (5<sup>2</sup>=34<sub>7</sub>), several of its multiples are palindromic squares:\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n| 13<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|   202\n|-\n| 26<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|  1111\n|-\n| 55<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|  4444\n|-\n| 101<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"| 10201\n|-\n| 143<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"| 24442\n|}\nIn [[base 18]], some powers of seven are palindromic:\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n| 7<sup>0</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|       1\n|-\n| 7<sup>1</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|       7\n|-\n| 7<sup>3</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|     111\n|-\n| 7<sup>4</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|     777\n|-\n| 7<sup>6</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|   12321\n|-\n| 7<sup>9</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"| 1367631\n|}\nAnd in [[base 24]] the first eight powers of five are palindromic as well:\n{| class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n| 5<sup>0</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|          1\n|-\n| 5<sup>1</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|          5\n|-\n| 5<sup>2</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|         11\n|-\n| 5<sup>3</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|         55\n|-\n| 5<sup>4</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|        121\n|-\n| 5<sup>5</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|        5A5\n|-\n| 5<sup>6</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|       1331\n|-\n| 5<sup>7</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|       5FF5\n|-\n| 5<sup>8</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|      14641\n|-\n| 5<sup>A</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|     15AA51\n|-\n| 5<sup>C</sup> ||=||style=\"text-align:right\"|    16FLF61\n|}\nAny number ''n'' is palindromic in all bases ''b'' with ''b''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 (trivially so, because ''n'' is then a single-digit number), and also in base ''n''&minus;1 (because ''n'' is then 11<sub>''n''&minus;1</sub>). A number that is non-palindromic in all bases 2&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 is called a [[strictly non-palindromic number]].\n\nA palindromic number in base ''b'' that is made up of palindromic sequences of length ''l'' arranged in a palindromic order (such as 101 111 010 111 101<sub>2</sub>) is palindromic in base ''b<sup>l</sup>'' (for example the above binary number is palindromic in base 2<sup>3</sup>=8 (it is equal to 57275<sub>8</sub>))\n\nThe square of 133<sub>10</sub> in base 30 is 4D<sub>30</sub><sup>2</sup> =  KKK<sub>30</sub> = 3R<sub>36</sub><sup>2</sup> =  DPD<sub>36</sub>.\nIn base 24 there are more palindromic squares due to 5<sup>2</sup> = 11. And squares of all numbers in the form 16...7 (with any number of 6'es between the 1 and 7) are palindromic. 167<sup>2</sup> = 1E5E1, 1667<sup>2</sup> = 1E3K3E1, 16667<sup>2</sup> = 1E3H8H3E1.\n\n==Lychrel process==\nNon-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic ones via a series of operations.  First, the non-palindromic number is reversed and the result is added to the original number. If the result is not a palindromic number, this is repeated until it gives a palindromic number. Such number is called \"a delayed palindrome\".\n\nIt is not known whether all non-palindromic numbers can be paired with palindromic numbers in this way.  While no number has been proven to be unpaired, many do not appear to be.  For example, 196 does not yield a palindrome even after 700,000,000 iterations. Any number that never becomes palindromic in this way is known as a [[Lychrel number]].\n\nFor example, 1,186,060,307,891,929,990 takes '''[http://www.jasondoucette.com/pal/1186060307891929990 261 iterations]''' to reach the 119-digit palindrome ''44562665878976437622437848976653870388884783662598425855963436955852489526638748888307835667984873422673467987856626544'', which is the current world record for the [http://www.jasondoucette.com/worldrecords.html#Most Most Delayed Palindromic Number]. It was solved by Jason Doucette's algorithm and program (using Benjamin Despres' reversal-addition code) on November 30, 2005.\n\nOn January 24, 2017 the number 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 was published in OEIS as [[oeis:A281509|A281509]] and announced \"The Largest Known Most Delayed Palindrome\". The sequence of 125 261-step most delayed palindromes preceding 1,999,291,987,030,606,810 and not reported before was published separately as [[oeis:A281508|A281508]].\n\n==Sum of the reciprocals==\nThe sum of the reciprocals of the palindromic numbers is a convergent series, whose value is approximately 3.37028... {{OEIS|id=A118031}}.\n\n==Scheherazade numbers==\n'''Scheherazade numbers''' are a set of numbers identified by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his book ''Synergetics''.<ref>R. Buckminster Fuller, with E. J. Applewhite, [http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s12/p2200.html#1230.00 ''Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of thinking''], Macmillan, 1982 {{ISBN|0-02-065320-4}}.</ref>  Fuller does not give a formal definition for this term, but from the examples he gives, it can be understood to be those numbers that contain a factor of the [[primorial]] ''n''#, where ''n''≥13 and is the largest [[prime factor]] in the number.  Fuller called these numbers ''Scheherazade numbers'' because they must have a factor of 1001.  [[Scheherazade]] is the storyteller of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', telling a new story each night to delay her execution.  Since ''n'' must be at least 13, the primorial must be at least 1·2·3·5·7·11·13, and 7×11×13 = 1001.  Fuller also refers to powers of 1001 as Scheherazade numbers.  The smallest primorial containing Scheherazade number is 13# = 30,030.\n\nFuller pointed out that some of these numbers are palindromic by groups of digits.  For instance 17# = 510,510 shows a symmetry of groups of three digits.  Fuller called such numbers ''Scheherazade Sublimely Rememberable Comprehensive Dividends'', or SSRCD numbers.  Fuller notes that 1001 raised to a power not only produces ''sublimely rememberable'' numbers that are palindromic in three-digit groups, but also the values of the groups are the [[binomial coefficient]]s. For instance,\n:<math>(1001)^6 = 1,006,015,020,015,006,001 </math>\n\nThis sequence fails at (1001)<sup>13</sup> because there is a [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry digit]] taken into the group to the left in some groups.  Fuller suggests writing these ''spillovers'' on a separate line.  If this is done, using more spillover lines as necessary, the symmetry is preserved indefinitely to any power.<ref>Fuller, [http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s12/p3100.html pp. 773-774]</ref>  Many other Scheherazade numbers show similar symmetries when expressed in this way.<ref>Fuller, pp. 777-780</ref>\n\n== Sums of palindromes ==\nIn 2018, a paper was published demonstrating that every positive integer can be written as the sum of three palindromic numbers in every number system with base 5 or greater.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cilleruelo|first=Javier|last2=Luca|first2=Florian|last3=Baxter|first3=Lewis|date=2016-02-19|title=Every positive integer is a sum of three palindromes|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2018-87-314/S0025-5718-2017-03221-X/home.html|journal=Mathematics of Computation}} ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06208 arXiv preprint])</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Lychrel number]]\n*[[Palindromic prime]]\n*[[Palindrome]]\n*[[Strictly non-palindromic number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Malcolm E.

(CreateSpace, 2009) p. 251, quoted in {{cite news | last =Wilkinson | first =Alec | title =The Pursuit of Beauty | newspaper =The New Yorker | date =February 2, 2015 | url =http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/02/02/pursuit-beauty | accessdate = January 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nRibenboim defines a '''triply palindromic prime''' as a prime ''p'' for which: ''p'' is a palindromic prime with ''q'' digits, where ''q'' is a palindromic prime with ''r'' digits, where ''r'' is also a palindromic prime.<ref>[[Paulo Ribenboim]], ''The New Book of Prime Number Records''</ref> For example, ''p'' = 10<sup>11310</sup> + 4661664{{e|5652}} + 1, which has ''q'' = 11311 digits, and 11311 has ''r'' = 5 digits. The first (base-10) triply palindromic prime is the 11-digit 10000500001. It's possible that a triply palindromic prime in base 10 may also be palindromic in another base, such as base 2, but it would be highly remarkable if it were also a triply palindromic prime in that base as well.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Prime number classes}}\n\n[[Category:Base-dependent integer sequences]]\n[[Category:Classes of prime numbers]]\n[[Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics]]\n[[Category:Palindromes]]"
