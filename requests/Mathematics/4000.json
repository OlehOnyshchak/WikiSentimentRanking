All twelve months of the Gregorian calendar have at least 28 days, regardless of the year.\n* The [[Gregorian calendar]] follows a 28-year cycle for the most part, since there are seven days in a week and leap year generally occurs every four years; usually, a calendar from any year is the same as that from 28 years earlier (e.g., 2008 and 1980 or 2009 and 2037). However, that rule holds only when there have been exactly seven leap days in a 28-year interval; years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are common years. Indeed, 1900 (as well as 2100, 2200, etc.) does not use the same calendar as 1872 (2072, 2172, etc., respectively) for the simple reason that 1900 is a common year. In 28 years, any day-of-the-week and date combination occurs exactly four times. February 29 will fall on each day of the week once.\n* In Jewish tradition there is a 28-year [[Solar cycle (calendar)|solar cycle]] in which the sun returns to its place in [[Genesis creation narrative|Creation]] every 28 solar years. This is commemorated in April every 28 years with the recitation of ''[[Birkat Hachama]]'', the blessing of the sun. \n* The common name for the [[parrot]] ''[[Australian ringneck|Barnardius zonarius semitorquatus]]'', widely distributed in [[Western Australia]] and [[South Australia]]. Its call sounds like \"wenniate\".\n* The number of letters in the [[Danish alphabet|Danish]] and [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]] [[alphabet]]s (not counting W), and also in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Esperanto orthography|Esperanto]] [[alphabet]]s.\n* In neo-Nazi circles, twenty-eight indicates [[Blood and Honour]] (28 = BH - B - second letter of the alphabet and H - the eight letter).\n* The number of [[Chinese constellations]], \"Xiu\" or \"mansions\" (a literal translation), equivalent to the 12 western [[zodiac]] constellations.\n* The number of [[dominoes]] in standard domino sets.\n* Deriving from the 29.46 year period of [[Saturn]]'s revolution around the [[Sun]], the 28-year cycle as well as its subdivisions by 14 and 7 are supposed in [[Astrology]] to mark significant turning points or sections in the course of a persons development in life. Thus, the number 28 has special significance in the culture of religious sects such as the [[Kadiri]] and the [[Mevlevi]] dervishes. The 28-beat metric pattern often used in the music compositions accompanying the main part of the [[Mevlevi]] [[sema]] ritual is called the \"Devri kebir\", meaning the \"Big Circle\" and is a reference to above astronomical facts about the year and the Saturn year.\n* In [[Quebec]], [[François Pérusse]], in one of his best-selling [[Album du peuple]] made a parody of [[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]] in which all of the letters picked by the contestant were present 28 times. As a result, 28 became an almost [[Mythical number]] used by many Quebec youths, the phrase \"Y'en a 28\" (There are 28 [Letters]) became a [[running gag]] still used and recognized more than 15 years later.\n* The [[Preludes Op. 28 (Chopin)|Preludes, Opus 28]] consists of  [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s 24 preludes for piano, ordinarily but not necessarily played together in concert.\n* The [[postal code]] of the [[Community of Madrid|province of Madrid]], in [[Spain]].\n* [[Twenty-eight (card game)|Twenty Eight]] is a popular game played in Kerala, India.\n* The number of the French department [[Eure-et-Loir]].\n* Approximately the number of grams in an ounce, and used as such in the illegal drug trade.\n* The [[UIC Country Code]] for [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] identifying member countries of the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC).\n* The letter ''[[Q]]'' when encoding the serial number for [[intermodal containers|intermodal (shipping) containers]] as defined by [[ISO 6346]].\n* The name of a single on the [[Trilogy (The Weeknd album)|''Trilogy'' by The Weeknd]].\n* The number of [[Panfilov's_Twenty-Eight_Guardsmen|Panfilov's Guardsmen]], said to have heroically fallen in combat on 16 November 1941 during the [[Battle of Moscow]], and venerated as Soviet's national heroes.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of highways numbered 28]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php/28.html Prime Curios! 28] from the [[Prime Pages]]\n\n{{Integers|zero}}\n\n[[Category:Integers]]"

In [[Jewish]], [[Christianity|Christian]], [[Islam]]ic, and other [[Middle Eastern]] traditions it is taken to represent a [[Indefinite and fictitious numbers|large, approximate number]], similar to \"[[umpteen]]\".\n\n===Sumerian===\n* [[Enki]] ( /ˈɛŋki/) or Enkil (Sumerian: dEN.KI(G)𒂗𒆠) is a god in Sumerian mythology, later known as Ea in Akkadian and Babylonian mythology. He was originally patron god of the city of [[Eridu]], but later the influence of his cult spread throughout [[Mesopotamia]] and to the [[Canaanites]], [[Hittites]] and [[Hurrians]]. He was the deity of crafts (gašam); mischief; water, seawater, lake water (a, aba, ab), intelligence (gestú, literally \"ear\") and creation (Nudimmud: nu, likeness, dim mud, make bear). He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field ([[Square of Pegasus]]). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric ideogram for \"40,\" occasionally referred to as his \"sacred number.\"\n \nA large number of myths about Enki have been collected from many sites, stretching from Southern Iraq to the Levantine coast. He figures in the earliest extant cuneiform inscriptions throughout the region and was prominent from the third millennium down to Hellenistic times.\n \nThe exact meaning of his name is uncertain: the common translation is \"Lord of the Earth\": the Sumerian en is translated as a title equivalent to \"lord\"; it was originally a title given to the High Priest; ki means \"earth\"; but there are theories that ki in this name has another origin, possibly kig of unknown meaning, or kur meaning \"mound\". The name Ea is allegedly Hurrian in origin while others claim that it is possibly of Semitic origin and may be a derivation from the West-Semitic root *hyy meaning \"life\" in this case used for \"spring\", \"running water.\" In Sumerian E-A means \"the house of water\", and it has been suggested that this was originally the name for the shrine to the God at Eridu.\n\n===Judaism===\n* In the [[Hebrew Bible]], forty is often used for time periods, forty days or forty years, which separate \"two distinct epochs\".<ref name=\"coogan\">Michael David Coogan, ''A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament: The Hebrew Bible in Its Context'', Oxford, 2008, p. 116</ref>\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n* Noah waited for forty days after the tops of mountains were seen after the flood, before releasing a raven (Genesis 8:5-7).\n* Spies were sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan (promised to the children of Israel) for \"forty days\" (Numbers 13:2, 25).\n* The Hebrew people lived in the lands outside of the promised land for \"forty years\". This period of years represents the time it takes for a new generation to arise (Numbers 32:13).\n* Several Jewish leaders and kings are said to have ruled for \"forty years\", that is, a generation. Examples include Eli (1 Samuel 4:18), Saul (Acts 13:21), David (2 Samuel 5:4), and Solomon (1 Kings 11:42).\n* [[Goliath]] challenged the Israelites twice a day for forty days before [[David]] defeated him (1 Samuel 17:16).\n* [[Moses]] spent three consecutive periods of \"forty days and forty nights\" on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]:\n# He went up on the seventh day of [[Sivan]], after [[God]] gave the Torah to the Jewish people, in order to learn the Torah from God, and came down on the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz|seventeenth day of Tammuz]], when he saw the Jews worshiping the [[Golden Calf]] and broke the tablets (Deuteronomy 9:11).\n# He went up on the eighteenth day of [[Tammuz (Hebrew month)|Tammuz]] to beg forgiveness for the people's sin and came down without God's atonement on the twenty-ninth day of [[Av]] (Deuteronomy 9:25).\n# He went up on the first day of [[Elul]] and came down on the tenth day of [[Tishrei]], the first [[Yom Kippur]], with God's atonement (Deuteronomy 10:10).\n* A [[mikvah]] consists of 40 ''[[se'ah]]'' (approximately {{Convert|200|USgal|liter|lk=on|abbr=off|sp=us|disp=or}}) of water\n* The prophet [[Elijah]] had to walk 40 days and 40 nights before arriving at mount [[Mount Horeb|Horeb]] (1 Kings 19:8).\n* 40 lashes is one of the punishments meted out by the [[Sanhedrin]] (Deuteronomy 25:3), though in actual practice only 39 lashes were administered.<ref>https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_06574.html</ref>\n* (Numbers 14:33–34) alludes to the same{{clarify|date=September 2018}} with ties to the prophecy in The Book of Daniel. \"For forty years—one year for each of the forty days you explored the land—you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you.\"\n* One of the prerequisites for a man to study Kabbalah is that he is forty years old.\n* \"The registering of these men was carried on cruelly, zealously, assiduously, from the rising of the sun to its going down, and was not brought to an end in forty days\" (3 Maccabees 4:15).\n\n===Christianity===\nChristianity similarly uses forty to designate important time periods.<ref name=\"coogan\"/>\n\n* Before his [[temptation of Christ|temptation]], Jesus fasted \"forty days and forty nights\" in the [[Judean desert]] (Matthew 4:2, Mark 1:13, Luke 4:2).\n* Forty days was the period from the [[resurrection of Jesus]] to the [[ascension of Jesus]] (Acts 1:3).\n* According to Stephen, Moses' life is divided into three 40-year segments, separated by his growing to adulthood, fleeing from Egypt, and his return to lead his people out (Acts 7:23,30,36).\n* In modern Christian practice, [[Lent]] consists of the 40 days preceding [[Easter]]. In much of Western Christianity, Sundays are excluded from the count; in Eastern Christianity, Sundays are included.\n* The [[Forty Martyrs of Sebaste]]\n* [[Kirk Kilisse]], \"Forty Churches\" (Σαράντα Εκκλησιές) in Eastern Thrace\n* Rain fell for \"forty days and forty nights\" during the Flood (Genesis 7:4).\n\n===Islam===\n* [[Muhammad]] was forty years old when he first received the revelation delivered by the archangel Gabriel.\n* [[Masih ad-Dajjal]] roams around the Earth in forty days, the first day length is like one year, the second day is like one month, the third day is like one week and the next day (until 40th day) is like one day. \n* God forbade the Fasiqun (the non-believers) from entering the Holy Land for 40 years to separate them from Musa ([[Moses]]) and his brother.<ref>Qur'an 5:25–26</ref>\n* Musa ([[Moses]]) spent 40 days on Mount Sinai where he received the 10 commandments.<ref>Qur'an 7:142</ref>\n* On the 40th verse (ayat) of the 2nd chapter of the Quran (Al-Baqarah) God changes the topic.\n* Forty was the number of days that Prophet Ilyas ([[Elijah]]) spent in the wilderness before the angel appeared to him with God's message on [[Mount Horeb]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Forty was the number of days that Prophet Isa was tempted in the desert by Satan.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Muhammad praying and fasting in the cave for 40 days.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Muhammad then had 40 followers to spread the religion of Islam.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Prophets [[David in Islam|Dawuud]] and [[Suleiman]] each ruled for forty years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n* Regarding the flood that [[Noah]] encountered, it is said that for forty days water continued to pour from the heavens and to stream out over the earth.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n===Yazidism===\n* In the [[Yazidi]] faith, The Chermera Temple (meaning \"40 Men\" in the Yazidi dialect) is so old that no one remembers how it came to have that name but it is believed to derive from the burial of 40 men on the mountaintop site.\n\n===Funerary customs===\n* Some Russians and Serbs believe that [[ghost]]s of the dead linger at the site of their death for forty days. After the forty days, additional prayers are performed at the grave (parastos (парастос) or panihida (панихида)), to escort the soul on its way to God's court. \n* Many Christian Filipinos mark the end of the initial mourning period on the fortieth day after death, and have a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] said. They believe that the soul remains on the earthly plane for forty days before entering the afterlife, recalling how Christ [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] forty days after his [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]].\n\n===Hinduism===\n* In [[Hinduism]], some popular religious prayers consist of forty [[shloka]]s or [[Doha (poetry)|dohas]] (couplets, stanzas). The most common being the [[Hanuman Chalisa]] (''chaalis'' is the Hindi term for 40).\n\nIn the Hindu system some of the popular fasting periods consist 40 days and is called the period One 'Mandala Kalam' Kalam means a period and Mandala Kalam means a period of 40 days. For example, the devotees of Swami Ayyappa, the name of a Hindu god very popular in Kerala, India (Sabarimala Swami Ayyappan) strictly observed forty days fasting and visit (only male devotees were permitted to enter into the god's temple until September 2018) with their holy submittance or offerings on 41st or a convenient day after a minimum 40 days practice of fasting. The offering is called \"Kaanikka\".\n\n==In entertainment==\n[[File:Crush 40 Logo.jpg|thumb|The number on the logo for the American-Japanese hard rock band Crush 40.]]\n*\"#40\" is a song by [[Dave Matthews Band]]\n*\"40\" is a song by [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]\n*[[40 (song)|\"40\"]] is a 1983 song by U2 from their album ''War'', whose lyrics are a modification of Psalm 40\n*Crush 40 is an American-Japanese hard rock band featured in [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' franchise with guitarist [[Jun Senoue]] and vocalist [[Johnny Gioeli]]\n*the highest number counted to on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' {{asof|2009|lc=yes}}<ref>{{Cite episode  |series=Sesame Street |network=PBS |date=November 10, 2009 |season=40 |number=4187 |language=en}}</ref>\n*the number of positions on several radio countdown programs, notably ''[[American Top 40]]'', ''[[American Country Countdown]]'', and ''[[Rick Dees' Weekly Top 40]]''\n*Chefs are given a $40 budget in ''[[The Early Show]]'' segment \"Chef on a Shoestring\".\n*[[40 (record producer)|Noah Shebib]], the Canadian hip hop producer is also known as \"40\".\n*\"[[Forty Shades of Green]]\", a song about Ireland, was written and recorded by Johnny Cash in 1961.\n* [[Fortycoats & Co.]] was an Irish children's TV drama series of the 1980s; the name is based on the nickname of a Dublin tramp, Johnny Fortycoats, of the 1930s.\n\n==In sports==\n* In baseball, each team in [[Major League Baseball]] is allowed to have [[Major League Baseball rosters#40-man roster|40 players]] under major-league contracts at any given time (not including players on the 60-day disabled list).

It equals 3 × 37, therefore all triplets (numbers like [[222 (number)|222]] or 777) in [[decimal|base ten]] are of the form 3''n'' × 37. As a repunit, it also follows that 111 is a [[palindromic number]].\n\nAll triplets in all bases are multiples of 111 in that base, therefore the number represented by 111 in a particular base is the only triplet that can ever be prime. 111 is not prime in base ten, but is prime in [[binary numeral system|base two]], where 111<sub>2</sub> = 7<sub>10</sub>. It is also prime in these other bases up to 128: 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 24, 27, 33, 38, 41, 50, 54, 57, 59, 62, 66, 69, 71, 75, 77, 78, 80, 89, 90, 99, 101, 105, 110, 111, 117, 119 {{OEIS|id=A002384}}\n\nIn [[base 18]], the number 111 is 7<sup>3</sup> (= 343<sub>10</sub>) which is the only base where 111 is a [[perfect power]].\n\nThe smallest [[magic square]] using only 1 and [[prime number]]s has a magic constant of 111:\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|31||73||7\n|-\n|13||37||61\n|-\n|67||1||43\n|}\n\nA six-by-six [[magic square]] using the numbers 1 to 36 also has a [[magic constant]] of 111:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;height:12em;width:12em;;table-layout:fixed\"\n|1||11||31||29||19||20\n|-\n|2||22||24||25||8||30\n|-\n|3||33||26||23||17||9\n|-\n|34||27||10||12||21||7\n|-\n|35||14||15||16||18||13\n|-\n|36||4||5||6||28||32\n|}\n\n(The square has this magic constant because 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 34 + 35 + 36 = [[666 (number)|666]], and 666 / 6 = 111).\n\n111 is also the magic constant of the [[Eight queens puzzle|n-Queens Problem]] for n = 6.<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A006003|2=a(n) = n*(n^2 + 1)/2}}</ref> It is also a [[nonagonal number]].<ref>{{cite OEIS|1=A001106|2=9-gonal (or enneagonal or nonagonal) numbers|accessdate=2016-05-26}}</ref>\n\nIn base 10, it is a [[Harshad number]].<ref>{{Cite OEIS|1=A005349|2=Niven (or Harshad) numbers|accessdate=2016-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==Nelson==<!--This section is linked from [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]]-->\n{{Main|Nelson (cricket)}}\nIn cricket, the number 111 is sometimes called \"a Nelson\" after [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Nelson]], who allegedly only had \"One Eye, One Arm, One Leg\" near the end of his life. This is in fact inaccurate - Nelson never lost a leg. Alternate meanings include \"One Eye, One Arm, One Ambition\" and \"One Eye, One Arm, One Arsehole\".\n\nParticularly in [[cricket]], multiples of 111 are called a double Nelson (222), triple Nelson (333), and so on.\n\nA score of 111 is considered by some to be unlucky. To combat the supposed bad luck, some watching lift their feet off the ground. Since an umpire cannot sit down and raise his feet, the international umpire [[David Shepherd (umpire)|David Shepherd]] had a whole retinue of peculiar mannerisms if the score was ever a Nelson multiple. He would hop, shuffle, or jiggle, particularly if the number of wickets also matched - 111/1, 222/2 etc.\n\n==In other fields==\n'''111''' is also:\n*The [[atomic number]] of the element [[roentgenium]] (Rg).\n*The [[chemical compound]] [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane]] is a [[chlorine|chlorinated]] [[hydrocarbon]] that was used as an industrial [[solvent]] with a trade name \"Solvent 111\".\n*The [[emergency telephone number]] in [[New Zealand]]; see [[111 (emergency telephone number)]].\n*A non-emergency medical public helpline operating in England and Scotland; see [[NHS 111]].\n*It is the lowest positive integer requiring seven syllables to name in [[British English|English]] (British and Canadian), or six syllables (by dropping the \"and\") in [[Comparison of American and British English#Numbers|American English]].\n*Occasionally it is referred to as \"[[110 (number)|eleventy]]-one\", as read in [[The Fellowship of the Ring]] by [[J.R.R.
