Because the alphabet was wholly unique, no font existed, so in 1857 the board of regents appointed [[Erastus Snow]] to procure metal type from [[St. Louis]]-based [[font foundry]] Ladew & Peer. However, in May 1857 the [[Utah War]] began, and Snow left St. Louis to support the Mormon pioneers. During the war, Ladew & Peer kept working on the type, and the [[Punchcutting|punches]] and [[Matrix (printing)|matrices]] were delivered in the winter of 1858.

The Deseret spelling of the word, <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐨𐑌𐐲𐑁</span>, reflects that stressed pronunciation. If {{IPA|/ə/}} does not have an inherent stressed value in a word, as is often the case before {{IPA|/r/}}, then it is written as <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐲</span>.<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|32–33}}\n\n[[Marion J. Shelton]], an early [[Mormon missionary]], proposed the addition of a new glyph to represent the schwa, a simple vertical line of the same height as other Deseret characters with a similar appearance to the [[Turkish dotless i]] (ı).

This allows some short words to be written with a single letter, and is called a letter's \"syllabic value\". The most common word in English, ''the'', is written simply <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐑄</span>, as the letter's name is {{IPA|/ðiː/}} and that is the stressed pronunciation of the word. The consonants with syllabic values are <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐶</span> (woo), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐷</span> (yee), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐸</span> (ha),  <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐹</span> (pee), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐺</span> (be/bee), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐻</span> (tee/tea), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐽</span> (qi), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐾</span> (gee), <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐑀</span> (gay), and <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐑄</span> (the/thee).<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|25}}\n\nSyllabic values do not apply within words, although this was formerly the case. In early documents, Watt writes \"people\" as <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐹𐐹𐑊</span> with the expectation that readers will interpret the first <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐹</span> as {{IPA|/pi/}}, but the second <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐹</span> as {{IPA|/p/}}.<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|13}} This contextual value switching was soon done away with, so in later documents, while \"bee\" is written <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐺</span>, \"bees\" is written <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐺𐐨𐑆</span>.\n\nIn 40-letter versions of the alphabet which include the letter 𐐧 (ew) which represents {{IPA|/juː/}}, the letter <span lang=\"en-Dsrt>𐐧</span> when standing alone can be used to represent the word \"you\".<ref name=\":14\" />{{Rp|25,51}}\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:WikipediaTheFreeEncyclopedia-DeseretAlphabet.svg|thumb|320x320px|{{Big|𐐎𐐮𐐿𐐨𐐹𐐨𐐼𐐨𐐲, 𐑄 𐑁𐑉𐐨 𐐯𐑌𐑅𐐴𐐿𐑊𐐲𐐹𐐨𐐼𐐨𐐲}} (Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)]]\n*[[File:Deseret Second Book Juvenile Hymn page 23.jpg|thumb|300x300px|[[Hymn]] from the ''Deseret Second Book'', printed in 1868.

[[Vowels]] can be dropped if the writer is in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an [[abjad]], letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and 𐐮 is placed on letters after they are already written as in an [[abugida]].

It is alphabetic, with both consonant and vowel signs in equal prominence. Writing is in a left-to-right direction, proceeding down the page, as in common European writing. Most Duployan letters will attach to adjacent letters, allowing a word (or words) to be written in a single stroke, without lifting the pen.<ref name=n3895 />\n\n=== Consonants ===\n\nConsonant characters come in two basic styles: line consonants and arc consonants. All consonants have a shape, size, and stroke direction that do not change based on the surrounding characters. Both types of consonants are contrasted by orientation, length, and the presence of ancillary dots and dashes on or near the letter.\n\nThe '''line consonants''' come in five orientations: vertical, horizontal, left-to-right falling, left-to-right rising, and right-to-left falling; and in three lengths: short, long, and extended. Variations of some line consonants will have dots adjacent to the center of the line.\n\n'''Arc consonants''' come in two arc lengths: half circle, and quarter circle. The half circle arcs have four orientations: left, right, top, and bottom half; and two lengths: regular and extended. Variations of the half circle arc consonants have dots inside and outside of the bowl, and dashes across the middle. The quarter arc consonants also have four orientations corresponding to the four quadrants of a circle, with both upwards and downwards strokes, and come in regular and extended lengths. The only variant quarter arc consonant is the addition of a dot (Duployan letter H) to the Duployan letter W to make the Duployan letter Wh.<ref name=n3895 />\n\n[[Image:Emile duploye bust.png|left|thumbnail|Émile Duployé]]\n\n=== Vowels ===\n\nVowels characters also come in two basic styles: circle vowels, and orienting vowels. Vowels have only a general shape and size, but their orientation and exact appearance are usually dictated by the adjacent characters.\n\n'''Circle vowels''' are written by creating a loop that starts from the preceding character acting as a tangent, continuing around the circle until reaching the tangent point of the following character, at which point the following letterform is written, with the two adjacent characters crossing to complete the \"circle\". Variants of the circle vowels have dots in the middle of the circle, or a protuberance in from the circle. Circle vowels may also take standard diacritic marks when used to write some languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0px;\"\n! colspan=\"7\" | Some circle vowels\n|-\n| [[File:1bc42.png]] ||  [[File:1bc44.png]] ||  [[File:1bc5a.png]] ||  [[File:1bc5b.png]] ||  [[File:1bc5c.png|20px]] ||  [[File:1bc60.png]]\n|}\n\n'''Orienting vowels''' are written by rotating the vowel to match the incoming angle of the preceding character, then mirrored along the axis of that character to avoid the following character crossing. They come in two varieties, defined by whether they will tend toward the right or left if the adjacent characters will allow either. Nasal vowels are considered a special case of an orienting vowel, and will act as orienting vowels, except in the Chinook script, where nasals can appear as diacritics.<ref name=n3895 />\n\n=== Affixes and word signs ===\nMany Duployan shorthands use small unattached marks, as well as various crossing and touching strokes, as markers for common prefixes and suffixes. Individual letters and letterlike symbols are also used in many Duployan shorthands to stand for common words and phrases. Overlapping two or more letters and signs can be used in some shorthands as word signs and abbreviations.<ref name=n3895 />\n\n=== Ligatures ===\nMost Duployan scripts do not make use of true ligatures that are not just one of its constituent letters with a distinguishing mark. The Romanian stenography is fairly unusual in having a number of vowel ligatures, especially with the Romanian U.<ref name=n3895 />\n\n=== Connecting letters ===\n\nMost Duployan letters cursively connect to any adjacent letters. Circle vowels will sometimes reduce to as small as a semi-circle in order to accommodate the incoming and outgoing strokes of adjacent letters, and orienting vowels will rotate to meet the preceding letter at a straight angle, while mirroring to present themselves to the following letter.\n\n{| \n|-\n| [[File:1bc02.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc42.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc03.png|30px]] || =  || colspan=\"6\" | [[File:Duployan Word PAT.gif|30px]] || \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| P || + || align=\"center\"| A || + || align=\"center\"| T || = || pat\n|-\n| [[File:1bc02.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc47.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc03.png|30px]] || = || colspan=\"6\" | [[File:Duployan Word PET.gif|30px]] || rowspan=\"2\" | * Note that E would normally sit on the left side of P, except that it must sit on the right to join with the T.\n|-\n| align=\"center\"| P || + || align=\"center\"| E || + || align=\"center\"| T || = || pet\n|-\n| [[File:1bc1b.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc42.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc46.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc1a.png|30px]] || = || colspan=\"4\" | [[File:Duployan Word JAIN.gif|60px]] || \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| J || + || align=\"center\"| A || + || align=\"center\"| I || + || align=\"center\"| N || = || shine\n|-\n| [[File:1bc02.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc47.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc17.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc03.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc47.png|30px]] || + || [[File:1bc1a.png|30px]] || = || [[File:Duployan Word PELhTEN.gif|60px]] || \n|-\n| align=\"center\"| P || + || align=\"center\"| E || + || align=\"center\"| Lh || + || align=\"center\"| T || + || align=\"center\"| E || + || align=\"center\"| N || = || pelten (Chinook)\n|}\n\n== Alphabetical order ==\n\nDuployan does not have a widely agreed alphabetical order. A precursory order for the alphabet has been invented for the Unicode script proposal, however; and this order can basically be found in the order of the Unicode allocation ([[#Table of characters|see ''Table of characters'']]). This order places consonants before vowels, with similar type and size letters grouped roughly together.\n\n== Table of characters ==\n\nThis table lists the characters used in all of the Duployan shorthands along with their Unicode code points.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1BC00.pdf | title=Duployan, Range: 1BC00–1BC9F | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=Unicode Consortium | date=2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1BCA0.pdf | title=Shorthand Format Controls, Range: 1BCA0–1BCAF | work=The Unicode Standard | publisher=Unicode Consortium | date=2016 }}</ref> A basic alphabetization can be derived from the order of the letters.

Like most European shorthands, French Duployan omits vowels that can be guessed by a fluent speaker.<ref name=\"DuployéFondamentale\">{{cite book|last=Hautefeuille and Ramaude|title=Cours de Sténographie Duployé Fondamentale}}</ref><ref name=Integrale>{{cite web|title=Stenographie Integrale|url=http://www.stenographie.ch/stenographie_integrale.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419093037/http://www.stenographie.ch/stenographie_integrale.pdf|archivedate=2009-04-19}}</ref>\n\n== Chinook writing ==\n[[Image:Wawatest2.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Introduction to the Wawa shorthand]]\nThe '''Chinook writing''', or '''Wawa shorthand''', or '''Chinuk pipa''', was developed by Father [[Jean-Marie-Raphaël Le Jeune]] in the early 1890s for writing in [[Chinook Jargon]], [[Lillooet language|Lillooet]], [[Thompson language|Thompson]], [[Okanagan language|Okanagan]], and [[English language|English]], with the intended purpose of bringing literacy and church teaching to the [[first nations]] in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Kamloops]]. The result was three decades' publication of the [[Chinook Jargon|Chinook Jargon language]] [[Kamloops Wawa]].<ref>{{cite web|last=LeJeune|first=Jean Marie|title=How the Shorthand was Introduced among the Indians|url=https://www.sfu.ca/nwjl/Articles/V005_N03/LejeunePoserWawa.html}}\n</ref>\n\nThe Chinook writing is notable by the absence of affixes and word signs, the phonological rigor &ndash; vowels were not omitted, even when predictable &ndash; and its use of W-vowels. Chinook writing is also notable in splitting a word into nominally syllabic units as well as using  the only non-joining consonant characters in Duployan.<ref name=ChinRud>{{cite web|last=LeJeune|first=Jean Marie Raphael|title=Chinook Rudiments|url=http://chinookjargon.home.att.net/ljcr24.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509180941/http://chinookjargon.home.att.net/ljcr24.htm|archivedate=2008-05-09|df=}}</ref><ref name=Wawa>{{cite web|last=LeJeune|first=Jean Marie Raphael|title=Kamloops Wawa|url=http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/ItemRecord/8_04645?id=58e68ecda9cb15cd}}</ref>\n\n== Romanian stenography ==\nThe '''Romanian stenography''' was developed by Margaretta Sfințescu in the 1980s.

Matthew Sloan, Denis Perrault, Carl Brandt, and George Galloway. The Pernin, Perrault, and Sloan shorthands are distinguished from other Duployan shorthands by the presence of the quarter-arc compound consonants. They also make use of affix marks, and omit redundant vowels.<ref name=Sloan>{{cite book|last=Sloan|first=J.M.|title=Modern Shorthand. the Sloan-Duployan Phonographic Instructor|year=1882|location=Ramsgate, England; St. John's, NL; Brisbane, QLD}}</ref><ref name=Perrault>{{cite book|last=Perrault|first=Denis R.|title=Perrault-Duployan Complete Elementary Course of Stenography in Six Lessons|year=1918|location=Montreal}}</ref><ref name=Pernin>{{cite book|last=Pernin|first=Helen M.|title=Pernin's Universal Phonography|year=1902|location=Detroit, MI}}</ref> Galloway and Brandt shorthands are not included in the Duployan Unicode proposal.<ref name=n3895 />\n\nUnlike other Duployan shorthands, Sloan-Duployan uses a thick, or heavy, stroke to indicate the addition of an \"R\" sound to a letter. Although not found in the other Duployan shorthands, contrastive thick and thin strokes are common in other shorthands, such as [[Pitman shorthand]], where a heavy stroke would indicate a voiced consonant, and thin the unvoiced version of the same consonant.<ref name=Sloan />\n\n== Unicode ==\n{{See also|Duployan (Unicode block)|Shorthand Format Controls|l2=Shorthand Format Controls (Unicode block)}}\nDuployan shorthand was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\n{{Unicode chart Duployan}}\n{{Unicode chart Shorthand Format Controls}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n{{ISO 15924/footer}}\n\n[[Category:Shorthand systems]]\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:1868 introductions]]\n[[Category:Scripts encoded in Unicode 7.0]]"

The men claimed that the language was revealed to them by the [[Enochian angels]]. The language is integral to the practice of [[Enochian magic]]. The syntax and grammar of the Enochian language are highly similar to the [[English language]].<ref name=\"Laycock p43\">Laycock, p. 43.</ref> \n\nThe language found in Dee's and Kelley's journals encompasses a limited textual corpus, only some of it with English translations. Several linguists, notably [[Donald Laycock]], have studied Enochian, and argue against any extraordinary features in the language.\n\nDee's journals did not describe the language as \"Enochian\", instead preferring descriptors like \"Angelical\", the \"Celestial Speech\", the \"Language of Angels\", the \"First Language of God-Christ\", the \"Holy Language\" or \"[[Adamic language|Adamical]]\" because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by [[Adam]] in Paradise to name all things. The term \"Enochian\" comes from Dee's assertion that the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.\n\n==Dee's Angelic language==\n\nAccording to Tobias Churton in his text ''The Golden Builders'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Churton, Tobias |title=The Golden Builders |publisher=Signal Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=0-9543309-0-0 |pages=}}</ref> the concept of an Angelic or [[antediluvian]] language was common during Dee's time. If one could speak the language of Angels, it was believed one could directly interact with them.\n\nIn 1581, Dee mentioned in his personal journals that God had sent \"good angels\" to communicate directly with prophets. In 1582, Dee teamed up with the [[Clairvoyance|seer]] [[Edward Kelley]], although Dee had used several other seers previously.<ref>Deborah Harkness, ''John Dee's Conversations with Angels'', 16-17.</ref> With Kelley's help as a [[scryer]], Dee set out to establish lasting contact with the angels. Their work resulted, among other things, in the reception of the Enochian or Angelical language.\n\nAccording to Dee's journals,<ref>Now in various collections of the British Library. See especially Sloane MSS 3188, 3189 and 3191, and Cotton Appendix XLVI. All the above are available in digital scans at: {{cite web |url=http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/mss/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111230010212/http://www.themagickalreview.org/enochian/mss/ |archivedate=2011-12-30 |df= }}.</ref> Angelical was supposed to have been the language God used to create the world, and which was later used by Adam to speak with God and the angels, and to name all things in existence. After his [[Fall from Paradise]], Adam lost the language and constructed a form of proto-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] based upon his vague memory of Angelical. This proto-Hebrew, then, was the [[universal human language]] until the time of the Confusion of Tongues at the [[Tower of Babel]]. After this, all the various human languages were developed, including an even more modified Hebrew (which we know as \"[[Biblical Hebrew]]\"). From the time of Adam to the time of Dee and Kelley, Angelical was hidden from humans with the single exception of the patriarch Enoch who, according to the angels, recorded the \"Book of Loagaeth\" (Speech from God) for humanity. The book was then lost again in the [[Deluge of Noah]].\n\nThe reception of Enochian started on March 26, 1583, when Kelley reported visions in the crystal of the twenty-one lettered alphabet characteristic of the language. A few days later, Kelley started receiving what became the first corpus of texts in the purported Angelic language. This resulted in the book ''Liber Loagaeth'' (\"Book [of] Speech from God\"). The book consists of 49 great letter tables, or squares made of 49 by 49 letters (however, each table has a front and back side—making 98 49x49 tables in all).<ref>This book is now in the British Library, MS Sloane 3189.</ref> Dee and Kelley said the angels never translated the texts in this book.\n\nThe other set of Enochian texts was received through Kelley about a year later, in [[Kraków]], where both alchemists stayed for some time at the court of King [[Stefan Batory]]. These come with English translations, thus providing the basis for the Enochian vocabulary. The texts comprise 48 poetic verses, which in Dee's manuscripts are called \"Claves Angelicae\", or \"Angelic Keys\". The Keys are assigned certain functions within the magical system. Dee was apparently intending to use these Keys to \"open the 49 Gates of Wisdom/Understanding\" represented by the 49 magic squares in ''Liber Loagaeth'':\n\n<blockquote>I am therefore to instruct and inform you, according to your Doctrine delivered, which is contained in 49 Tables. In 49 voices, or callings: which are the Natural Keys to open those, not 49 but 48 (for one is not to be opened) Gates of Understanding, whereby you shall have knowledge to move every Gate…<ref>The angel Nalvage, cited in Casaubon ed., ''A True and Faithful Relation…'', p. 77</ref>\n:—The angel Nalvage</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>But you shall understand that these 19 Calls are the Calls, or entrances into the knowledge of the mystical Tables.  Every Table containing one whole leaf, whereunto you need no other circumstances.<ref>The angel Illemese, cited in Casaubon ed., ''A True and Faithful Relation…'', p. 199.</ref>\n:—The angel Illemese</blockquote>\n\nWhile these texts contain most of the vocabulary, dozens of further words are found hidden throughout Dee's journals, and thousands of undefined words are contained in the ''Liber Loagaeth''.\n\n== Alphabet ==\nThe Enochian script is written from right to left, and may include [[diacritic|diacritical marks]]. Different documents have slightly different forms of the script. Some of the letter names are pronounced as they would be in English, but many are pronounced differently.

Both languages have soft and hard [[consonants]] such as ''c'' and ''g'', and combine ''s'' and ''h'' to make the ''sh'' sound.\n\nAs for the [[semantics]] of Enochian, additional similarities to English have been found. For example, ''luciftias'', a term meaning brightness, may very possibly have a connection to [[Lucifer]], whose name means \"light bringer.\" ''Londoh'', a word meaning kingdom, may have come from Dee's admiration for [[Queen Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. These and other examples have led sceptics to believe that many of these terms are derived from notions that would have been contemporary in Dee's and Kelley's time.\n\nThe alphabet also shares many graphical similarities to a script- also attributed to the prophet Enoch- that appeared in the ''Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam'' of [[Johannes Pantheus]], a copy of which Dee is known to have owned.<ref>{{cite web|author=Johannes Pantheus|title=''Voarchadumia Contra Alchimiam''|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/9925345/Voarchadumia-Contra-Alchimiam-Johannes-Pantheus|year=1550|page=15v-16r|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308052242/https://www.scribd.com/doc/9925345/Voarchadumia-Contra-Alchimiam-Johannes-Pantheus|archivedate=2016-03-08|df=}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Occult}}\n\n* [[List of magical terms and traditions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | last = DeSalvo | first = John | title = Decoding the Enochian Secrets: God’s Most Holy Book to Mankind as Received by Dr. John Dee from Angelic Messengers | publisher = Destiny Books | location = Rochester, VT | year = 2011 | isbn = 1594773645 }}\n* {{cite book | last = DeSalvo | first = John | title = The Lost Art of Enochian Magic: Angels, Invocations, and the Secrets Revealed to Dr. John Dee | publisher = Destiny Books | location = Rochester, VT | year = 2010 | isbn = 1594773440 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Eco | first = Umberto | title = The Search for the Perfect Language | publisher = Fontana Press | location = London | year = 1997 | isbn = 0006863787 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leitch | first = Aaron | title = The Angelical Language, Volume I: The Complete History and Mythos of the Tongue of Angels | publisher = Llewellyn Publications | location = Woodbury, MN | year = 2010 | isbn = 0738714909 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Leitch | first = Aaron | title = The Angelical Language, Volume II: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the Tongue of Angels | publisher = Llewellyn Publications | location = Woodbury, MN | year = 2010 | isbn = 0738714917 }}\n* {{cite book | last = | first = |editor1-first= Donald |editor1-last=Laycock |editor2-first=Lon Milo |editor2-last=DuQuette | title = The Complete Enochian Dictionary: A Dictionary of the Angelic Language As Revealed to Dr. John Dee and Edward Kelley | publisher = Weiser | location = Boston | year = 2001 | isbn = 1578632544 }}\n* {{cite book | last = | first = |editor1-first= Joseph H. |editor1-last=Peterson | title = John Dee's Five Books of Mystery: Original Sourcebook of Enochian Magic: From the Collected Works Known as Mysteriorum Libri Quinque | publisher = Weiser Books | location = Boston | year = 2003 | isbn = 1578631785 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Tyson | first = Donald | title = Enochian Magic for Beginners: The Original System of Angel Magic | publisher = Llewellyn Publications | location = St. Paul, MN | year = 1997 | isbn = 1567187471 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Yates | first = Frances | title = The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age | publisher = Routledge |location = London | year = 1979 | authorlink=Frances Yates | isbn = 0415254094 }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/enoch1.txt Enochian-English dictionary from www.sacred-texts.com]\n*[http://www.softpedia.com/get/Others/Home-Education/Enochian.shtml Freeware Enochian Analysis Software, Windows] by [[Juriaan Massenza]]\n\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:Artistic languages]]\n[[Category:Enochian magic]]\n[[Category:Spurious languages]]\n[[Category:Language and mysticism]]\n[[Category:Obsolete scientific theories]]\n[[Category:Scripts not encoded in Unicode]]"

It is generally agreed to have been created in the 9th century by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Cyril]], a Byzantine monk from [[Thessaloniki]]. He and his brother, [[Saint Methodius of Thessaloniki|Saint Methodius]], were sent by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael III]] in 863 to [[Great Moravia]] to spread Christianity among the [[West Slavs]] in the area. The brothers decided to translate liturgical books into the Old Slavic language that was understandable to the general population, but as the words of that language could not be easily written by using either the Greek or Latin alphabets, Cyril decided to invent a new script, Glagolitic, which he based on the local dialect of the Slavic tribes from the Byzantine [[Thessalonica (theme)|theme of Thessalonica]].\n\nAfter the deaths of Cyril and Methodius, the Glagolitic alphabet ceased to be used in Moravia, but their students continued to propagate it in the  [[First Bulgarian Empire]], where it was subsequently also displaced by the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]]. The Glagolitic alphabet was preserved only by the clergy of [[Croatia]] to write [[Church Slavonic]] until the early 19th century.\n\n==Name==\nThe name was not created until many centuries after the script's creation, and comes from the [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[wikt:глаголъ|глаголъ]] ''glagol'' \"utterance\". The verb ''glagolati'' means \"to speak\". It has been conjectured that the name ''glagolitsa'' developed in [[Croatia]] around the 14th century and was derived from the word ''glagolity'', applied to adherents of the liturgy in Slavonic.<ref>Bernard Comrie and Greville G.

Twenty-four of the 41 original Glagolitic letters (see table below) probably derive from graphemes of the medieval cursive [[Greek minuscule|Greek small alphabet]] but have been given an [[ornament (art)|ornamental]] design.\n\nThe source of the other consonantal letters is unknown. If they were added by Cyril, it is likely that they were taken from an alphabet used for Christian scripture. It is frequently proposed that the letters ''sha'' {{Script|Glag|Ⱎ}}, ''tsi'' {{Script|Glag|Ⱌ}}, and ''cherv'' {{Script|Glag|Ⱍ}} were taken from the letters ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'' ש and ''[[tsadi]]'' צ of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], and that Ⰶ ''zhivete'' derives from [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] ''janja'' Ϫ.<ref>{{cite book | title=The World's Writing Systems | year=1996 | editor1-first=Peter T. | editor1-last=Daniels | editor1-link=Peter T.

Other proposals include the [[Samaritan alphabet]], which Cyril learned during his journey to the [[Khazars]] in [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].\n\nGlagolitic letters were also used as numbers, similarly to [[Cyrillic numerals]]. Unlike Cyrillic numerals, which inherited their numeric value from the corresponding Greek letter (see [[Greek numerals]]), Glagolitic letters were assigned values based on their native alphabetic order.\n\nThe two monks later canonized as Saints Cyril and Methodius, brothers from [[Thessaloniki]], were sent to [[Great Moravia]] in 862 by the [[Byzantine emperor]] at the request of Prince [[Rastislav of Moravia|Rastislav]], who wanted to weaken the dependence of his country on [[East Francia|East Frankish]] priests. The Glagolitic alphabet, however it originated, was used between 863 and 885 for government and religious documents and books and at the Great Moravian Academy (''Veľkomoravské učilište'') founded by the missionaries, where their followers were educated. The [[Kiev Missal]], found in the 19th century in Jerusalem, was dated to the 10th century.\n\nIn 886 an East Frankish bishop of [[Nitra]] named [[Wiching]] banned the script and jailed 200 followers of Methodius, mostly students of the original academy. They were then dispersed or, according to some sources, sold as slaves by the Franks. Many of them (including [[Naum of Preslav|Naum]],  [[Clement of Ohrid|Clement]], Angelarious, Sava and Gorazd), however, reached [[Bulgaria]] and were commissioned by [[Boris I of Bulgaria]] to teach and instruct the future clergy of the state in the [[Slavic language]]s. After the adoption of Christianity in Bulgaria in 865, religious ceremonies and [[Divine Liturgy]] were conducted in [[Greek language|Greek]] by clergy sent from the [[Byzantine Empire]], using the [[Byzantine rite]]. Fearing growing Byzantine influence and weakening of the state, Boris viewed the introduction of the Slavic alphabet and language into church use as a way to preserve the independence of the Bulgarian Empire from Byzantine [[Constantinople]]. As a result of Boris' measures, two academies, one in [[Ohrid Literary School|Ohrid]] and one in [[Preslav Literary School|Preslav]], were founded.\n\n===Spread===\n\nFrom there, the students travelled to other places and spread the use of their alphabet. Some went to [[Croatia]] ([[Dalmatia]]), where the squared variant arose and where Glagolitic remained in use for a long time. In 1248, [[Pope Innocent IV]] granted the Croatians of southern Dalmatia the unique privilege of using their own language and this script in the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy. Formally granted to bishop Philip of [[Senj]], permission to use the Glagolitic liturgy (the [[Roman Rite]] conducted in the [[Slavic language]] instead of [[Latin]], not the [[Byzantine rite]]), actually extended to all Croatian lands, mostly along the [[Adriatic]] coast. The [[Holy See]] had several Glagolitic [[missal]]s published in Rome. Authorization for the use of this language was extended to some other Slavic regions between 1886 and 1935.<ref>\"The right to use the Glagolitic language at Mass with the Roman Rite has prevailed for many centuries in all the south-western Balkan countries, and has been sanctioned by long practice and by many popes...\" [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04606b.htm ''Dalmatia''], ''Catholic Encyclopedia''; \"In 1886 it arrived to the Principality of Montenegro, followed by the Kingdom of Serbia in 1914, and the Republic of Czechoslovakia in 1920, but only for feast days of the main patron saints. The 1935 concordat with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia anticipated the introduction of the Slavic liturgy for all Croatian regions and throughout the entire state...\" [http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/japun.html ''The Croatian Glagolitic Heritage''], Marko Japundzić.</ref> In missals, the Glagolitic script was eventually replaced with the Latin alphabet, but the use of the [[Slavic language]] in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] continued, until replaced by modern vernacular languages.\n\nSome students of the Ohrid academy went to [[Bohemia]] where the alphabet was used in the 10th and 11th centuries, along with other scripts. It is not clear whether the Glagolitic alphabet was used in the [[Jaxa of Köpenick|Duchy of Kopnik]] before the [[Wendish Crusade]], but it was certainly used in [[Kievan Rus']].\n\nIn Croatia, from the 12th century, Glagolitic inscriptions appeared mostly in littoral areas: [[Istria]], Primorje, [[Kvarner]], and Kvarner islands, notably [[Krk]], [[Cres]], and [[Lošinj]]; in Dalmatia, on the islands of Zadar, but there were also findings in inner [[Lika]] and [[Krbava]], reaching to [[Kupa]] river, and even as far as [[Međimurje]] and [[Slovenia]].\nThe ''[[Hrvoje's Missal]]'' ({{lang-hr|Hrvojev misal}}) from 1404 was written in [[Split (city)|Split]], and it is considered one of the most beautiful Croatian Glagolitic books. The 1483 ''[[Missale Romanum Glagolitice]]'' was the first printed Croatian Glagolitic book.\n\nIt was believed that Glagolitsa in Croatia was present only in those areas. But, in 1992, the discovery of Glagolitic inscriptions in churches along the [[Orljava]] river in [[Slavonia]] totally changed the picture (churches in [[Brodski Drenovac]], [[Lovčić]], and some others), showing that use of the Glagolitic alphabet was spread from Slavonia also.<ref>{{hr icon}} [http://www.sbtv.hr/Vijesti/2007%20vijesti/04%202007%20travanj/SB_INFO_2007-01%2003.htm ''\"Glagoljaška baština u Slavonskom Kobašu\"''], ''Slavonskobrodska televizija'', News from February 25, 2007.</ref>\n\nAt the end of the 9th century, one of these students of Methodius &ndash; Naum, who had settled in [[Preslav, Bulgaria]] &ndash; created the [[Cyrillic script]]{{Dubious|date=August 2017}}, which almost entirely replaced Glagolitic during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Cyrillic alphabet is derived from the Greek alphabet, with some letters (like ⟨ш⟩, ⟨ц⟩, ⟨ч⟩, ⟨ъ⟩, ⟨ь⟩, ⟨ѣ⟩) peculiar to Slavic languages being derived from the Hebrew alphabet. The decision{{Which|date=August 2017}}{{By whom|date=August 2017}} in favor of Cyrillic created an alphabetical difference between the two literary centres of the Bulgarian state in Pliska and Ohrid. In the western part the Glagolitic alphabet remained dominant at first. However, subsequently in the next two centuries, mostly after the fall of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], Glagolitic gradually ceased to be used there at all.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3o5lrvuwOVwC&pg=PA146 |title=East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000–1500 |first=Jean W. |last=Sedlar |publisher=University of Washington Press |page=146 |accessdate=2013-05-01|isbn=9780295972916 |year=1994 }}</ref> Nevertheless, particular passages or words written with the Glagolitic alphabet appeared in Bulgarian Cyrillic manuscripts till the end of the 14th century.<ref>Велчева, Б. Късната българска глаголица. Кирило-Методиевски студии, кн. 12, София, 1999, 87–152.</ref>\n\nSporadic instances aside, Glagolitic survived beyond the 12th century as a primary script in Croatia alone, although from there a brief attempt at reintroduction was made in the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] area in the 14th century. The centre of influence appears to have been in the [[Kvarner Gulf]], though the nature and extent of this influence remain subjects of debate. The early development of the Glagolitic minuscule script alongside the increasingly square majuscule is poorly documented, but before the advent of printing, a mutual relationship evolved between the two varieties; the majuscule being used primarily for inscriptions and higher liturgical uses, and the minuscule being applied to both religious and secular documents. Ignoring the problematic early Slavonian inscriptions, the use of the Glagolitic script at its peak before the [[Croatian-Ottoman wars]] corresponded roughly to the area that spoke the [[Chakavian]] dialect at the time, in addition to, to varying extents, the adjacent [[Kajkavian]] regions within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb|Zagreb bishopric]]. As a result, vernacular impact on the liturgical language and script largely stems from Chakavian sub-dialects.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Decline===\n\nThe first major threat to Croatian Glagolitic since it attained stability was from the Ottoman excursions, though the extent of cultural damage varied locally depending on the course of war. In the 17th century, though, the first successful direct attack on the script since the 12th century was headed by the Bishop of Zagreb, and after the [[Magnate conspiracy]] left the script without secular protectors, its use was limited to the littoral region. In the meantime, printing gradually overtook handwriting for liturgical manuscripts, resulting in a decline of the majuscule script, which was absorbed for titular and sometimes initial use within for minuscule documents. It was not until the late 18th century and the onset of modernity that Glagolitic received significant further threats, and through western influence, especially secular, Glagolitic culture collapsed, so that by the mid 19th century, the script was purely liturgical, relying mostly on printed materials. By the time of the devastating [[Italianization]] movements under [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] in the early 20th century, numerous independent events had already greatly reduced the area of the liturgical use of Glagolitic.<ref>{{cite book |last=Strohal |first=Rudolf |date=1915 |title=Hrvatska glagolska knjiga |trans-title=Croatian Glagolitic Book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=AXg4AAAAYAAJ |language=hr |location=Zagreb |publisher=Merkur |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n==Versions of authorship and name==\nThe tradition that the alphabet was designed by Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius has not been universally accepted. A less common belief, contradicting [[allochthon]]ic [[Slavic peoples#Origins and Slavic homeland debate|Slovene]] origin, was that the Glagolitic was created or used in the 4th century by [[St. Jerome]] ([[Latin]]: ''Eusebius Sophronius Hieronymus''), hence the alphabet is sometimes named '''Hieronymian'''.\n\nIt is also [[Acrophony|acrophonically]] called '''azbuki''' from the names of its first two letters in Bulgaria, on the same model as \"alpha\" + \"beta\". The Slavs of [[Great Moravia]] (present-day [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]]), [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slavonia]] were called ''Slověne'' at that time, which gives rise to the name '''Slovenish''' for the alphabet. Some other, rarer, names for this alphabet are '''Bukvitsa''' (from common Slavic word \"bukva\" meaning \"letter\", and a suffix \"-itsa\") and '''Illyrian'''.\n\n===Hieronymian version===\nIn the Middle Ages, Glagolitsa was also known as \"St. Jerome's script\" due to popular mediaeval legend (created by Croatian scribes in the 13th century) ascribing its invention to [[St. Jerome]] (342–429). That claim, however, has been resolutely{{clarify|date=February 2015}} disproven.\n<!--\nNote to editors: the \"name\" \"Sanctvm Hieronymum Illiricaru(m) Litterarum\" does not exist: these Latin words are just an initial part of a sentence, not a terminological unit: ''To St. Jerome, the inventor of Illyrian letters...'' etc. The image http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Rocca.PNG is referred to above.  Thus, it is not necessary to make the second reference here.\n-->\n{{quotation|Until the end of the 18th century, a strange but widespread opinion dominated that the Glagolitic writing system, which was in use in Dalmatia and Istria along with neighboring islands, including the translation of the Holy Scripture, owe their existence to the famous church father St. Jerome. Knowing him as the author of the Latin [[Vulgate]], considering him – by his own words, born on the border between Dalmatia and Pannonia (remembering that the Dalmatian borders extended well into Istria at that time) – presumed to be an Illyrian, the self-styled Slavic intellectuals in Dalmatia very early began to ascribe to him the invention of ''glagolitsa'', possibly with the intention of more successfully defending both Slavic writing and the Slavic holy service against prosecutions and prohibitions from Rome's hierarchy, thus using the opinion of the famous Latin Father of the Church to protect their church rituals which were inherited from the Greeks Cyril and Methodius. We do not know who was the first to put in motion this unscientifically-based tradition about Jerome's authorship of the Glagolitic script and translation of the Holy Scripture, but in 1248 this version came to the knowledge of Pope Innocent IV. <...> The belief in Jerome as an inventor of the Glagolitic lasted many centuries, not only in his homeland, i.e. in Dalmatia and Croatia, not only in Rome, due to Slavs living there... but also in the West. In the 14th century, Croatian monks brought the legend to the Czechs, and even the Emperor Charles IV believed them.<ref>До конца XVIII века господствовало странное, но широко распространенное мнение, что глаголическое письмо, бывшее в употреблении в Далмации и Истрии с прилегающими островами и в приморской Хорватии, вместе с переводом священного писания, обязано своим существованием знаменитому отцу церкви св. Иерониму. Зная о нем как авторе латинской «Вульгаты», считая его же как уроженца Далмации славянином, в частности хорватом, домашняя славянская интеллигенция Далмации стала очень рано присваивать ему изобретение глаголицы, быть может, нарочно, с тем умыслом, чтобы успешнее отстаивать и письмо, и богослужение славянское от преследований и запретов со стороны римской иерархии, прикрывая авторитетным именем знаменитого латинского отца церкви свой от греков Кирилла и Мефодия унаследованный обряд. Кем впервые пущено в ход это ни на чем не основанное ученое предание об авторстве св. Иеронима по части глаголического письма и перевода св. писания, мы не знаем, но в 1248 году оно дошло уже до сведения папы Иннокентия IV. <...> Много столетий продолжалась эта вера в Иеронима как изобретателя глаголического письма, не только дома, т. е. в Далмации и Хорватии, не только в Риме, через проживавших там славян... но также и на западе. В Чехию предание занесено в XIV столетии хорватскими монахами-глаголитами, которым поверил даже император Карл IV. (Jagić 1911, pp. 51–52)</ref>|Jagić, Vatroslav|Glagolitica. Würdigung neuentdeckter Fragmente|Wien, 1890}}\n\nThe epoch of traditional attribution of the script to Jerome ended probably in 1812.<ref>P. Solarić's \"Букварь славенскiй трiазбучный\" (''Three-alphabet Slavic Primer''), Venice, 1812 mentions the version as a fact of science (see Jagić 1911, p. 52; Vajs 1932, p. 23).</ref> In modern times, only certain marginal authors share this view, usually \"re-discovering\" one of the already-known mediaeval sources.<ref>For example, K.

All artifacts presented as evidence of pre-Glagolitic Slavic inscriptions have later been identified as texts in known scripts and in known non-Slavic languages, or as fakes.<ref>L. Niederle, \"Slovanské starožitnosti\" (Slavic antiquities), III 2, 735; citation can be found in Vajs 1932, p. 4.</ref> The well-known [[Chernorizets Hrabar]]'s ''strokes and incisions'' are usually considered to be a reference to a kind of property mark or alternatively fortune-telling signs. Some \"Ruthenian letters\" found in one version of St. Cyril's life are explainable as misspelled \"Syrian letters\" (in Slavic, the roots are very similar: ''rus-'' vs. ''sur-'' or ''syr-''), etc.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe values of many of the letters are thought to have been displaced under Cyrillic influence or to have become confused through the early spread to different dialects so the original values are not always clear. For instance, the letter ''yu'' Ⱓ is thought to have perhaps originally had the sound /u/ but was displaced by the adoption of an ''oѵ'' ligature Ⱆ under the influence of later Cyrillic. Other letters were late creations after a Cyrillic model.\n\nThe following table lists each letter in its modern order, showing an image of the letter (round variant), the corresponding modern Cyrillic letter, the approximate sound transcribed with the [[help:IPA|IPA]], the name, and suggestions for its origin.

Cf. Streitberg (1910:20).</ref>\n\nThe alphabet is essentially an [[uncial script|uncial]] form of the [[Greek alphabet]], with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology: [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[F]] and [[G]], a questionably [[Runic alphabet|Runic]] letter to distinguish the {{IPAslink|w}} [[Semivowel|glide]] from [[Vowel|vocalic]] {{IPAslink|u}}, and the letter [[ƕair]] to express the Gothic [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]].\n\n==Origin==\n\nUlfilas is thought to have consciously chosen to avoid the use of the older [[Runic alphabet]] for this purpose, as it was heavily connected with [[Germanic paganism|heathen]] beliefs and customs.<ref>Cf. Jensen (1969:474).</ref> Also, the Greek-based script probably helped to integrate the Gothic nation into the dominant [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] culture around the [[Black Sea]].<ref>Cf. Haarmann (1991:434).</ref>\n\n==Letters==\nBelow is a table of the Gothic alphabet.<ref>For a discussion of the Gothic alphabet see also [[Fausto Cercignani]], ''The Elaboration of the Gothic Alphabet and Orthography'', in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\", 93, 1988, pp. 168-185.</ref> Two letters used in its [[transliteration]] are not used in current English: thorn ''[[Thorn (letter)|þ]]'' (representing {{IPAslink|θ}}), and hwair ''[[Hwair|ƕ]]'' (representing {{IPAslink|ʍ|hʷ}}).\n\nAs with the Greek alphabet, Gothic letters were also assigned numerical values. When used as numerals, letters were written either between two dots (•{{lang|got|𐌹𐌱}}• = 12) or with an overline (<span style=\"text-decoration: overline\">{{lang|got|𐌹𐌱}}</span> = 12). Two letters, {{lang|got|𐍁}} (90) and {{lang|got|𐍊}} (900), have no phonetic value.\n\nThe letter names are recorded in a 9th-century manuscript of [[Alcuin]] ([[Codex Vindobonensis 795]]). Most of them seem to be Gothic forms of names also appearing in the [[rune poem]]s. The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.<ref>The forms which are not attested in the Gothic corpus are marked with an asterisk. For a detailed discussion of the reconstructed forms, cf. Kirchhoff (1854). For a survey of the relevant literature, cf.

It is also used in the writing of other [[Jewish languages]], most notably [[Yiddish]], [[Judaeo-Spanish]], [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judeo-Arabic]], and [[Judeo-Persian]].\n\nHistorically, two separate abjad scripts have been used to write Hebrew. The original, old Hebrew script, known as the [[paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], has been largely preserved in a variant form as the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. The present \"Jewish script\" or \"square script\", on the contrary, is a stylized form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] and was known by Jewish sages as the [[Ashuri alphabet]] (lit. \"Assyrian\"), since its origins were alleged to be from [[Assyria]].<ref>Babylonian Talmud (''Sanhedrin'' 21b–22a); Jerusalem Talmud (''Megillah'' 10a). Cf. [[Mishnah]] (''Megillah'' 1:8): \"The Books [of Scripture] differ from phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' only in that the Books may be written in any language, while phylacteries and ''Mezuzahs'' may be written '''in the Assyrian writing only'''.\"  See: ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press: London 1977, p. 202.</ref>\n\nVarious \"styles\" (in current terms, \"[[font]]s\") of representation of the Jewish script letters described in this article also exist, including a variety of [[cursive Hebrew]] styles. In the remainder of this article, the term \"Hebrew alphabet\" refers to the square script unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. It does not have [[letter case|case]], but five letters have different forms when used at the end of a word. Hebrew is [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. Originally, the alphabet was an abjad consisting only of [[consonant]]s, but is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\". As with other abjads, such as the [[Arabic alphabet]], during its centuries-long use scribes devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel points, known in Hebrew as ''[[niqqud]].'' In both biblical and rabbinic Hebrew, the letters [[Yodh|{{hebrew|י}}]] [[Waw (letter)|{{hebrew|ו}}]] [[He (letter)|{{hebrew|ה}}]] [[Aleph|{{hebrew|א}}]] can also function as ''[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'', which is when certain consonants are used to indicate vowels. There is a trend in [[Modern Hebrew]] towards the use of ''matres lectionis'' to indicate vowels that have traditionally gone unwritten, a practice known as \"[[full spelling]]\".\n\nThe  [[Yiddish alphabet]], a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet used to write Yiddish, is a true alphabet, with all vowels rendered in the spelling, except in the case of inherited Hebrew words, which typically retain their Hebrew spellings.\n\nThe Arabic and Hebrew alphabets have similarities because they are both derived from the Aramaic alphabet.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Paleo-hebrew alphabet.jpg|300px|thumb|Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|300px|thumb|The ''[[Aleppo Codex]]'', a tenth century [[Masoretic Text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]].

Following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE during the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Jews]] began using a form of the Assyrian Aramaic alphabet, which was another offshoot of the same family of scripts. The [[Samaritans]], who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the paleo-Hebrew alphabet. During the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, \"square\" form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that was used by the [[Persian Empire]] (and which in turn had been adopted from the [[Assyria]]ns),<ref name=\"A History of the Hebrew Language\">{{cite book|year=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, England |isbn=978-0-521-55634-7}}</ref> while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the paleo-Hebrew script called the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. After the fall of the Persian Empire in 330 BCE, Jews used both scripts before settling on the square Assyrian form.\n\nThe square Hebrew alphabet was later adapted and used for writing languages of the [[Jewish diaspora]] – such as [[Karaim language|Karaim]], the [[Judeo-Arabic languages]], Judaeo-Spanish, and Yiddish. The Hebrew alphabet continued in use for scholarly writing in Hebrew and came again into everyday use with the rebirth of the Hebrew language as a spoken language in the 18th and 19th centuries, especially in [[Israel]].\n{{clear2|right}}\n\n==Description==\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 border=0 style=\"float:right;margin-left:5px;width:246px\"\n|\n{|style=\"border:1px solid #b0b0b0;float:right;margin:0px\"\n|align=center|<div style=\"text-align:center;background-color:#e0e0e0;margin:3px;padding:5px;direction:rtl;line-height:1.8em;font-size:130%;\"> [[Aleph|{{hebrew|א}}]] [[Beth (letter)|{{hebrew|ב}}]] [[Gimel|{{hebrew|ג}}]] [[Dalet|{{hebrew|ד}}]] [[He (letter)|{{hebrew|ה}}]] [[Waw (letter)|{{hebrew|ו}}]] [[Zayin|{{hebrew|ז}}]] [[Heth|{{hebrew|ח}}]] [[Teth|{{hebrew|ט}}]] [[Yodh|{{hebrew|י}}]]<br/>[[Kaph|{{hebrew|כ}}]] [[Kaph|{{hebrew|ך}}]] [[Lamedh|{{hebrew|ל}}]] [[Mem|{{hebrew|מ}}]] [[Mem|{{hebrew|ם}}]] [[Nun (letter)|{{hebrew|נ}}]] [[Nun (letter)|{{hebrew|ן}}]] [[Samekh|{{hebrew|ס}}]] [[Ayin|{{hebrew|ע}}]] [[Pe (letter)|{{hebrew|פ}}]]<br/>[[Pe (letter)|{{hebrew|ף}}]] [[Tsade|{{hebrew|צ}}]] [[Tsade|{{hebrew|ץ}}]] [[Qoph|{{hebrew|ק}}]] [[Resh|{{hebrew|ר}}]] [[Shin (letter)|{{hebrew|ש}}]] [[Taw|{{hebrew|ת}}]] {{•}} [[ﭏ|{{hebrew|ﭏ}}]]</div>\n|-\n|\n{|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 style=\"font-size:80%;margin-left:3px;margin-right:3px;margin-bottom:3px;padding:1px;line-height:130%;border-style:none\"\n|valign=top|Features: ||[[Abjad]]{{•}}[[Mater lectionis]]{{•}}[[Begadkefat]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Variants: ||[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive]]{{•}}[[Rashi script|Rashi]]{{•}}[[Solitreo]]{{•}}[[Hebrew braille|Braille]]\n|-\n|valign=top|Numerals: ||[[Gematria]]{{•}}[[Hebrew numerals|Numeration]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Ancillaries: ||[[Hebrew diacritics|Diacritics]]{{•}}[[Hebrew punctuation|Punctuation]]{{•}}[[Cantillation]]\n|-\n|valign=top|Translit.: ||[[Romanization of Hebrew]]{{•}}[[Hebraization of English]]{{•}}[[Help:IPA/Hebrew|IPA]]{{•}}[[ISO 259|ISO]]\n|- style=\"background-color:#e0e0e0\"\n|valign=top|Computers: ||[[Hebrew keyboard|Keyboard]]{{•}}[[Unicode and HTML for the Hebrew alphabet|Unicode and HTML]]\n|}\n|}\n|}\n\n===General===\nIn the traditional form, the Hebrew alphabet is an [[abjad]] consisting only of [[consonant]]s, [[Writing system#Directionality|written from right to left]]. It has 22 letters, five of which use different forms at the end of a word.\n\n===Vowels===\n\nIn the traditional form, vowels are indicated by the weak [[consonant]]s [[Aleph]] ({{hebrew|א}}), [[He (letter)|He]] ({{hebrew|ה}}), [[Waw (letter)|Vav]] ({{hebrew|ו}}), or  [[Yodh]] ({{hebrew|י}}) serving as vowel letters, or [[Mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']]: the letter is combined with a previous vowel and becomes silent, or by imitation of such cases in the spelling of other forms. Also, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed. In modern forms of the alphabet, as in the case of [[Yiddish]] and to some extent [[Modern Hebrew]], [[vowel]]s may be indicated. Today, the trend is toward [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|full spelling]] with the weak letters acting as true vowels.\n\nWhen used to [[Yiddish orthography|write Yiddish]], vowels are indicated, using certain letters, either with niqqud diacritics (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|אָ}} or {{Script/Hebrew|יִ}}) or without (e.g. {{Script/Hebrew|ע}} or {{Script/Hebrew|י}}), except for Hebrew words, which in Yiddish are written in their Hebrew spelling.\n\nTo preserve the proper vowel sounds, scholars developed several different sets of vocalization and diacritical symbols called ''nequdot'' ({{hebrew|ניקודות}}, literally \"points\"). One of these, the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian system]], eventually prevailed. [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]], and his family for several generations, are credited for refining and maintaining the system. These points are normally used only for special purposes, such as [[Bible|Biblical]] books intended for study, in [[poetry]] or when teaching the language to children.  The Tiberian system also includes a set of [[cantillation]] marks, called \"trope\", used to indicate how scriptural passages should be chanted in synagogue recitations of scripture (although these marks do not appear in the scrolls). In everyday writing of modern Hebrew, ''niqqud'' are absent; however, patterns of how words are derived from [[Semitic root|Hebrew roots]] (called ''shorashim'' or \"triliterals\") allow Hebrew speakers to determine the vowel-structure of a given word from its consonants based on the word's context and part of speech.\n\n===Alphabet===\n\nUnlike the Paleo-Hebrew writing script, the modern Ashuri script has five [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] that have special [[final form]]s,{{ref label|Pronunciation_in_Different_Word_Positions|c|}} called '''sofit''' ({{lang-he|סופית}}, meaning in this context \"final\" or \"ending\") form, used only at the end of a word, somewhat as in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] or in the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s.{{ref label|Variants_in_Arabic_Mandaic|b|}} These are shown below the normal form in the following table (letter names are [[List of Unicode characters#Hebrew|Unicode]] standard<ref name=\"unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_unicode.org\">[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0590.pdf Chart of Hebrew glyphs at unicode.org]</ref><ref name=\"unicode_names_of_hebrew_glyphs_at_fileformat.info\">[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/hebrew/list.htm Unicode names of Hebrew characters at fileformat.info].</ref>).

When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called ''dagesh'' ({{hebrew|דגש}}), while the soft sounds lack a ''dagesh''.

The six consonants {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} were pronounced differently depending on their position. These letters were also called ''[[Begadkefat|BeGeD KeFeT]]'' letters {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|eɪ|ɡ|ɛ|d|ˈ|k|ɛ|f|ɛ|t}}. The full details are very complex; this summary omits some points. They were pronounced as [[plosive]]s {{IPA|/b ɡ d k p t/}} at the beginning of a syllable, or when doubled. They were pronounced as [[fricative]]s {{IPA|/v ɣ ð x f θ/}} when preceded by a vowel (commonly indicated with a macron, ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ). The plosive and double pronunciations were indicated by the ''dagesh''. In Modern Hebrew the sounds ḏ and ḡ have reverted to {{IPA|[d]}} and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}, respectively, and ṯ has become {{IPA|[t]}}, so only the remaining three consonants {{IPA|/b k p/}} show variation. {{hebrew|ר}} ''resh'' may have also been a \"doubled\" letter, making the list ''BeGeD KePoReT''. ([[Sefer Yetzirah]], 4:1)\n\n*{{hebrew|ח}} ''chet'' and {{hebrew|ע}} ''ayin'' represented [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] [[fricative consonant|fricatives]], {{hebrew|צ}} ''tsadi'' represented the [[emphatic consonant]] {{IPA|/sˤ/}}, {{hebrew|ט}} ''tet'' represented the emphatic consonant {{IPA|/tˤ/}}, and {{hebrew|ק}} ''qof'' represented the [[uvular consonant|uvular plosive]] {{IPA|/q/}}. All these are common [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[consonant]]s.\n*{{hebrew|שׂ}} ''sin'' (the {{IPA|/s/}} variant of {{hebrew|ש}} ''shin'') was originally different from both {{hebrew|שׁ}} ''shin'' and {{hebrew|ס}} ''samekh'', but had become {{IPA|/s/}} the same as {{hebrew|ס}} ''samekh'' by the time the vowel pointing was devised. Because of [[cognate]]s with other [[Semitic language]]s, this phoneme is known to have originally been a [[lateral consonant]], most likely the [[voiceless alveolar lateral fricative]] {{IPA|/ɬ/}} (the sound of modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''ll'') or the [[voiceless alveolar lateral affricate]] {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (like [[Náhuatl]] ''tl'').\n\n====Regional and historical variation====\n\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] of the Hebrew letters in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]]. The apostrophe-looking symbol after some letters is not a [[Yodh|yud]] but a [[geresh]]. It is used for loanwords with non-native Hebrew sounds. The dot in the middle of some of the letters, called a \"[[dagesh]] kal\", also modifies the sounds of the letters <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override;\">[[ב]], [[כ]] and [[פ]]</span> in [[modern Hebrew]] (in some forms of Hebrew it modifies also the sounds of the letters <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override;\">[[ג]], [[ד]] and/or [[ת]];</span> the \"dagesh chazak\" – orthographically indistinguishable from the \"dagesh kal\" – designates [[gemination]], which today is realized only rarely – e.g. in biblical recitations or when using [[Arabic]] [[loanword]]s).\n:{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Symbol\n! colspan=\"9\" ! | [[help:IPA|Pronunciation]]\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" ! | [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]]\n! colspan=\"3\" ! | Reconstructed\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Arabic equivalent\n|-\n!

In [[Masoretic Text]]s and some other older texts, [[lenition|lenited]] consonants and sometimes ''matres lectionis'' are indicated by a small line on top of the letter. Its use has been largely discontinued in modern printed texts. It is still used to mark fricative consonants in the [[YIVO]] orthography of [[Yiddish]].\n|}\n\n==Numeric values of letters==\n{{main|Hebrew numerals}}\n\nFollowing the adoption of Greek Hellenistic alphabetic numeration practice, Hebrew letters started being used to denote numbers in the late 2nd century BC,<ref>Sirat, Colette (1976), ''Ecriture et civilisations'', Paris: Editions du CNRS.</ref> and performed this arithmetic function for about a thousand years. Nowadays alphanumeric notation is used only in specific contexts, e.g. denoting dates in the [[Hebrew calendar]], denoting grades of school in Israel, other listings (e.g. שלב א׳, שלב ב׳ – \"phase a, phase b\"), commonly in [[Kabbalah]] ([[Judaism|Jewish]] [[mysticism]]) in a practice known as [[gematria]], and often in religious contexts.\n\n[[File:Hohe Synagoge Prag 1.jpg|thumb|260px| The lower clock on the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall]] building in [[Prague]], with Hebrew numerals in counterclockwise order.]]\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n!<small>letter</small>!!<small>numeric value</small>\n|-\n|<big>'''א'''</big>||1||'''<big>י</big>'''||10||'''<big>ק</big>'''||100\n|-\n|<big>'''ב'''</big>||2||'''<big>כ</big>'''||20||'''<big>ר</big>'''||200\n|-\n|<big>'''ג'''</big>||3||'''<big>ל</big>'''||30||'''<big>ש</big>'''||300\n|-\n|<big>'''ד'''</big>||4||'''<big>מ</big>'''||40||'''<big>ת</big>'''||400\n|-\n|<big>'''ה'''</big>||5||'''<big>נ</big>'''||50\n|-\n|<big>'''ו'''</big>||6||'''<big>ס</big>'''||60\n|-\n|<big>'''ז'''</big>||7||'''<big>ע</big>'''||70\n|-\n|<big>'''ח'''</big>||8||'''<big>פ</big>'''||80\n|-\n|<big>'''ט'''</big>||9||'''<big>צ</big>'''||90\n|}\n\nThe numbers 500, 600, 700, 800 and 900 are commonly represented by the juxtapositions <span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override; text-direction:ltr;\">ק״ת, ר״ת, ש״ת, ת״ת, and ק״תת</span> respectively.\nAdding a [[geresh]] (\"׳\") to a letter multiplies its value by one thousand, for example, the year 5778 is portrayed as ה׳תשע״ח, where ה׳ represents 5000, and תשע״ח represents 778.\n\n==Transliterations and transcriptions==\n{{Main|Romanization of Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew|Biblical Hebrew orthography|Yiddish|Yiddish orthography}}\n\nThe following table lists transliterations and transcriptions of Hebrew letters used in [[Modern Hebrew]].\n\nClarifications:\n*For some letters, the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] offers a ''precise'' transliteration that differs from the ''regular'' standard it has set. When omitted, no such precise alternative exists and the regular standard applies.\n*The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [[phoneme|phonemic]] transcription is specified whenever it uses a different symbol from the one used for the '''regular''' standard Israeli transliteration.\n*The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] [[phonetics|phonetic]] transcription is specified whenever it differs from IPA '''phonemic''' transcription.\n\nNote: [[Society of Biblical Literature|SBL's]] transliteration system, recommended in its ''Handbook of Style'',<ref name=SBL>[http://www.viceregency.com/Translit.htm Resources for New Testament Exegesis – Transliteration Standards of The SBL Handbook of Style]</ref> differs slightly from the 2006 ''precise'' transliteration system of the Academy of the Hebrew Language; for \"[[צ]]\" SBL uses \"ṣ\" (≠ AHL \"ẓ\"), and for [[Begadkefat|בג״ד כפ״ת]] with no dagesh, SBL uses the same symbols as for with dagesh (i.e. \"b\", \"g\", \"d\", \"k\", \"f\", \"t\").<!-- THIS INFORMATION RELIES ON http://www.viceregency.com/Translit.htm, IF BETTER SOURCE AVAILABLE, PLEASE CORRECT! -->\n\n{|class=\" wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=15 style=\"text-transform: uppercase;

To the eye of readers orientating themselves on Latin (or similar) alphabets, these letters might seem to be transliterated as vowel letters; however, these are in fact transliterations of the vowel diacritics – niqqud (or are representations of the spoken vowels). E.g., in אִם (\"if\", {{IPA|[ʔim]}}), אֵם (\"mother\", {{IPA|[ʔe̞m]}}) and אֹם (\"[[nut (hardware)|nut]]\", {{IPA|[ʔo̞m]}}), the letter א always represents the same consonant: {{IPAblink|ʔ}} ([[glottal stop]]), whereas the vowels /i/, /e/ and /o/ respectively represent the spoken vowel, whether it is orthographically denoted by diacritics or not. Since the Academy of the Hebrew Language ascertains that א in initial position is not transliterated, the symbol for the glottal stop &nbsp;<big>ʾ</big>&nbsp; is omitted from the transliteration, and only the subsequent vowels are transliterated (whether or not their corresponding vowel diacritics appeared in the text being transliterated), resulting in \"im\", \"em\" and \"om\", respectively.\n\n{{note label|geresh_B1_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B2_eg|}}{{note label|geresh_B3_eg|}}<sup>'''B'''1{{note|geresh_B1}}2{{note|geresh_B2}}3{{note|geresh_B3}}</sup>The [[diacritic]] [[geresh]] – \"׳\" – is used with some other letters as well (ד׳, ח׳, ט׳, ע׳, ר׳, ת׳), but only to transliterate ''from'' other languages ''to'' Hebrew – never to spell Hebrew words; therefore they were not included in this table (correctly translating a Hebrew text with these letters would require using the spelling in the language from which the transliteration to Hebrew was originally made). The non-standard \"ו׳\" and \"וו\" {{ref label|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1|e1|}} are sometimes used to represent {{IPAslink|w}}, which like {{IPAslink|d͡ʒ}}, {{IPAslink|ʒ}} and {{IPAslink|t͡ʃ}} appears in Hebrew slang and loanwords.\n\n{{note label|ch_C1_eg|}}{{note label|ch_C2_eg|}}<sup>'''C'''1{{note|ch_C1}}2{{note|ch_C2}}</sup>The Sound {{IPAslink|χ}} (as \"ch\" in [[loch]]) is often transcribed \"ch\", inconsistently with the guidelines specified by the Academy of the Hebrew Language: חם {{IPA|/χam/}} → \"cham\"; סכך {{IPA|/sχaχ/}} → \"schach\".\n\n{{note label|final_pe_D_eg|}}<sup>'''D'''{{note|final_pe_D}}</sup>Although the Bible does include a single occurrence of a final pe with a dagesh ([[Book of Proverbs]] 30, 6: \"{{Hebrew|אַל-תּוֹסְףְּ עַל-דְּבָרָיו: פֶּן-יוֹכִיחַ בְּךָ וְנִכְזָבְתָּ.}}\"), in modern Hebrew {{IPAslink|p}} is always represented by [[Pe (letter)|pe]] in its regular, not final, form \"פ\", even when in final word position, which occurs with loanwords (e.g. שׁוֹפּ {{IPA|/ʃop/}} ''\"shop\"''), foreign names (e.g. פִילִיפּ {{IPA|/ˈfilip/}} ''\"Philip\"'') and some slang (e.g. חָרַפּ {{IPA|/χaˈrap/}} ''\"slept deeply\"'').\n\n==Religious use==\nThe letters of the Hebrew alphabet have played varied roles in Jewish religious literature over the centuries, primarily in mystical texts. Some sources in classical [[rabbinical literature]] seem to acknowledge the historical provenance of the currently used Hebrew alphabet and deal with them as a mundane subject (the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], for example, records that \"the Israelites took for themselves square calligraphy\", and that the letters \"came with the Israelites from Ashur [Assyria]\");<ref>Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 21b</ref> others attribute mystical significance to the letters, connecting them with the process of creation or [[Jewish messianism|the redemption]]. In mystical conceptions, the alphabet is considered eternal, pre-existent to the Earth, and the letters themselves are seen as having holiness and power, sometimes to such an extent that several stories from the [[Talmud]] illustrate the idea that they cannot be destroyed.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Pesach 87b, Avodah Zarah 18a.</ref>\n\nThe idea of the letters' creative power finds its greatest vehicle in the [[Sefer Yezirah]], or ''Book of Creation'', a mystical text of uncertain origin which describes a story of creation highly divergent from that in the [[Book of Genesis]], largely through exposition on the powers of the letters of the alphabet. The supposed creative powers of the letters are also referenced in the Talmud and [[Zohar]].<ref>Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55c</ref><ref>Zohar 1:3; 2:152</ref>\n\n[[File:Tefillin.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The four-pronged [[Shin (letter)|Shin]]]]\nAnother book, the 13th-century [[Kabbalistic]] text [[Sefer HaTemunah]], holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the [[teffilin]] box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will [[Tikkun Olam|repair the universe]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">''The Book of Letters''. Woodstock, Vermont: Jewish Lights Publishing, Woodstock. 1990</ref> Another example of messianic significance attached to the letters is the teaching of Rabbi Eliezer that the five letters of the alphabet with final forms hold the \"secret of redemption\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn addition, the letters occasionally feature in [[aggadic]] portions of non-mystical rabbinic literature. In such aggada the letters are often given [[anthropomorphic]] qualities and depicted as speaking to God. Commonly their shapes are used in parables to illustrate points of ethics or theology. An example from the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (a parable intended to discourage speculation about the universe before creation):\n\n{{quote box\n| align = center\n| width = 50%\n| quote = ''Why does the story of creation begin with bet?... In the same manner that the letter bet is closed on all sides and only open in front, similarly you are not permitted to inquire into what is before or what was behind, but only from the actual time of Creation.''\n| source = Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Hagigah, 77c\n}}\n\nExtensive instructions about the proper methods of forming the letters are found in Mishnat Soferim, within [[Mishna Berura]] of [[Yisrael Meir Kagan]].\n\n==Mathematical use==\nSee [[aleph number]] and [[beth number]] and [[gimel function]].\n\nIn [[set theory]], <math>\\aleph_0</math>, pronounced aleph-naught or aleph-zero, is used to mark the [[cardinal number]] of an infinite [[countable set]], such as <math>\\mathbb Z</math>, the set of all integers. More generally, the <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math> (aleph) notation marks the ordered sequence of all distinct infinite cardinal numbers.\n\nLess frequently used, the <math>\\beth_\\alpha</math> (beth) notation is used for the iterated [[power set]]s of <math>\\aleph_0</math>. The 2nd element <math>\\beth_1</math> is the [[cardinality of the continuum]].

The same goes with the [[Mandaic alphabet|Mandaic ones]], except for three of the 22 letters, which have only one form.\n\n<sup>c{{note|Pronunciation_in_Different_Word_Positions}}</sup>In forms of Hebrew older than Modern Hebrew, '''כ״ף''', '''בי״ת''' and '''פ״א''' can only be read ''b'', ''k'' and ''p'', respectively, at the beginning of a word, while they will have the sole value of ''v'', ''kh'' and ''f'' in a ''sofit'' (final) position, with few exceptions.<ref name=\"kaf_sofit\"/> In medial positions, both pronunciations are possible. In Modern Hebrew this restriction is not absolute, e.g. פִיזִיקַאי {{IPA|/fiziˈkaj/}} and never {{IPA|/piziˈkaj/}} (= \"physicist\"), סְנוֹבּ {{IPA|/snob/}} and never {{IPA|/snov/}} (= \"snob\"). A ''[[dagesh]]'' may be inserted to unambiguously denote the [[plosive]] variant: בּ = {{IPA|/b/}}, כּ = {{IPA|/k/}}, פּ ={{IPA|/p/}}; similarly (though today very rare in Hebrew and common only in [[Yiddish]]) a [[rafe|rafé]] placed above the letter unambiguously denotes the [[fricative]] variant: בֿ = {{IPA|/v/}}, כֿ = {{IPA|/χ/}} and פֿ = {{IPA|/f/}}. In [[Modern Hebrew]] [[orthography]], the sound {{IPAblink|p}} at the end of a word is denoted by the regular form \"פ\", as opposed to the final form \"ף\", which always denotes {{IPAblink|f}} (see [[#Transliterations and transcriptions|table of transliterations and transcriptions]], comment{{ref label|final_pe_D_eg|D|}}).\n\n<sup>d{{note|Double_Vav_as_Ligature_or_as_Separate_Letters}}</sup>However, וו (two separate vavs), used in [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|Ktiv male]], is to be distinguished from the ''Yiddish ligature'' װ (also two vavs but together as one character).\n\n<sup>e1{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_1}}e2{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_2}}e3{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_3}}e4{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_4}}e5{{note|Double_Vav_and_Vav_with_Geresh_5}}</sup>The Academy of the Hebrew Language states that both {{IPAblink|v}} and {{IPAblink|w}} be indistinguishably represented in Hebrew using the letter Vav.<ref name=\"trans-into-heb taatiq2007\">{{cite web|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |format=PDF |title=Transliteration Rules |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703210016/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf |archivedate=2014-07-03 |df= }} issued by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.</ref> Sometimes the Vav is indeed doubled, however not to denote {{IPA|[w]}} as opposed to {{IPA|[v]}} but rather, when [[Ktiv hasar niqqud|spelling without niqqud]], to denote the [[phoneme]] /v/ at a non-initial and non-final position in the word, whereas a single Vav at a non-initial and non-final position in the word in spelling without niqqud denotes one of the [[phoneme]]s /u/ or /o/.

      "text": "{{for|the fanzine of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]|Interlac (APA)}}\n{{confusing|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:Interlac Landscape.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Interlac font table]]\n\n'''Interlac''' is the designated communication language of the 30th century United Planets in the [[DC Universe|DC Comics fictional universe]]. It is also the name of a similarly-used language in the TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]''.\n \n==DC Universe==\nBasically, the Interlac alphabet is a simple one-to-one [[substitution cipher]].  The Interlac alphabet corresponds perfectly to the twenty-six letters of the [[Latin alphabet]] and the numbering system corresponds to Earth [[decimal|Base-Ten]] form. Although nominally protected by differences in font spacing, the numbering system itself suffers from a minor stylistic flaw due to the potential for confusion of 6 with 41 and 7 with 42. Anyone writing it by hand could certainly introduce an error when read by another, and this could create problems with handwriting recognition, as well.\n\n{{cquote|As the official U.P. language, Interlac is taught in schools throughout the system and is the common form of communication between most sentient United Planet races.\" (After ''Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes'' #1 - DC Comics 1988)}}\n\nThe first reference to Interlac as the \"intergalactic universal language of the 30th century\" was in ''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #379 published March, 1969. It was also frequently referred to in the ''Super Friends'' comic book series (in which all of the Super Friends, including Wendy and Marvin, speak it) as a token explanation of how the Super Friends could understand the language of visiting and/or invading extraterrestrials. The Interlac alphabet was codified years later by writer [[Paul Levitz]] and artist [[Keith Giffen]]  in ''[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'' (vol. 2) #312 (June 1984).\n\nAfter the DC Comics reboot, the new ''[[Blue Beetle]]'' title points out that a planet that is under attack by The Reach is speaking in Interlac. This planet is in Space Sector 2, and these events take place an undefined time ago, though described as \"Long, long ago.\" and images of Earth show a [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] tribe. Contradictory to the statement that the aliens seen are speaking Interlac is the text that can be seen on the signs in the background of the panels. These symbols do not match up to the Interlac alphabet. This may be due to the text being in their native language or a different written dialect as some symbols are similar.\n\n===Recent usage===\nTowards the start of \"The Martian Chronicles\" (Episode 11 of Season 2 of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''), Interlac makes a cameo appearance via graffiti seen on a for-aliens bar when employee M'gann exits to take the trash out.  Appropriately, the tag is simply \"bar\". In \"Wake Up\" (Episode 7 of Season 3), the control panel of an alien hibernation device is written in Interlac, displaying such words as \"Ready\", \"Normal\", and \"Danger\".\n\nIn the \"[[Lightning Saga]]\" crossover in ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' (vol. 2) and ''[[Justice Society of America]]'' (vol. 2) Interlac is spoken by the character [[Thom Kallor|Starman]] and others as a trigger. They say \"Lightning Lad\" in Interlac, freeing other Legion members from the mental blocks that have been put in place.\n\nThe individual chapter titles are also printed in Interlac:\n* Chapter 1 \"Lightning Lad\"\n* Chapter 2 \"Dreams and Fire\"\n* Chapter 3 \"Suicide\"\n* Chapter 4 \"Three Worlds\"\n* Chapter 5 \"The Villain Is the Hero in His Own Story\"\n\nInterlac is also shown to be the language in which the [[Guardians of the Universe]] write the [[Book of Oa]].\n\nShown to have been used thousands of years ago in Space Sector 2, according to ''Blue Beetle'' issue 1, of the New DC Universe.\n\n==Babylon 5==\nIn the universe of the TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', '''Interlac''' is a universal language most often used in first contact situations because it is easily translated. It is easily translated because it is a language based on pure mathematics.<ref>[http://jmsnews.com/msg.aspx?id=1-5898&query=Legion%20of%20Superheroes JMSNews]</ref> In this context, it is normally used only in first contact situations until such a time as a more common understanding between two new species becomes available. Unlike the DC Comics \"Interlac\", the common trade language in the Babylon 5 universe is English.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]\n*[[DC Comics]]\n*''[[Babylon 5]]''\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://endofweb.blogspot.com/2006/04/interlac-now-even-in-wikipedia.html End of Web 2.0 - the blog edition: Interlac - now even in Wikipedia - download of freeware Interlac Font (TrueType for Windows & Mac)]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928011343/http://www.infiniteearths.org/LSH/outpost2_files/interlac.htm INTERLAC - Interlac, the Intergalactic Language]\n\n{{Legion of Super-Heroes}}\n{{Babylon 5}}\n\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:Artistic languages]]\n[[Category:DC Comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional languages]]\n[[Category:Legion of Super-Heroes]]\n[[Category:Babylon 5]]"

The character set is almost identical to that of other [[Brahmic scripts]]. Consonantal letters imply an [[inherent vowel]].  Letters representing consonants are combined to form digraphs ''(''{{lang|kn|ಒತ್ತಕ್ಷರ}} ''ottakṣara)'' when there is no intervening vowel. Otherwise, each letter corresponds to a [[syllable]].\n\nThe letters are classified into three categories: {{lang|kn|ಸ್ವರ}} ''svara'' ([[vowel]]s), {{lang|kn|ವ್ಯಂಜನ}} ''vyañjana'' ([[consonant]]s), and {{lang|kn|ಯೋಗವಾಹಕ}} <!-- please fix spelling --> ''yōgavāhaka'' ([[semiconsonant]]s).\n\nThe Kannada words for a letter of the script are {{lang|kn|ಅಕ್ಷರ}} ''akshara'', {{lang|kn|ಅಕ್ಕರ}} ''akkara'', and {{lang|kn|ವರ್ಣ}} ''varṇa''. Each letter has its own form ({{lang|kn|ಆಕಾರ}} ''ākāra'') and sound ({{lang|kn|ಶಬ್ದ}} ''śabda''), providing the visible and audible representations, respectively. Kannada is written from left to right.<ref name=\"F. Kittel, A Grammar of the Kannada Language, p 5\">''A Grammar of the Kannada Language.'' F.

These changes consist of:\n\n# Modification of existing glyphs: In the early Kannada script, no orthographic distinction was made between the short mid {{IPA|[e, o]}} {{lang|kn|ಎ}}, {{lang|kn|ಒ}} and long mid {{IPA|[eː, oː]}} {{lang|kn|ಏ}}, {{lang|kn|ಓ}}. However, distinct signs were employed to denote the special consonants viz. the trill {{IPA|[r]}} {{lang|kn|ಱ}} the retroflex lateral {{IPA|[ɭ]}} {{lang|kn|ಳ}} and the retroflex rhotic {{IPA|[ɺ]}} {{lang|kn|ೞ}} found only in South Indian languages, by 5th century.{{dubious|date=August 2015}}{{fix|text=the transcriptions contradict themselves}}\n# Introduction of new characters: Kannada script includes characters like {{IPA|[ç]}} {{lang|kn|ಶ}}, {{IPA|[ʂ]}} {{lang|kn|ಷ}}, {{IPA|[rɨː]}} {{lang|kn|ೠ}}, {{IPA|[lɨ]}} {{lang|kn|ఌ}}, {{IPA|[lɨː]}} {{lang|kn|ౡ}}, {{IPA|[eʲ]}} {{lang|kn|ಐ}}, {{IPA|[oʷ]}} {{lang|kn|ಔ}}, {{IPA|[am]}} {{lang|kn|ಅಂ}}, {{IPA|[ah]}} {{lang|kn|ಅಃ}}, and mahāprāṇa characters like {{IPA|[kʰ]}} {{lang|kn|ಖ}}, {{IPA|[ɡʱ]}} {{lang|kn|ಘ}}, {{IPA|[tʃʰ]}} {{lang|kn|ಛ}}, {{IPA|[dʒʱ]}} {{lang|kn|ಝ}}, {{IPA|[t̪ʰ]}} {{lang|kn|ಥ}}, {{IPA|[d̪ʱ]}} {{lang|kn|ಧ}}, {{IPA|[ʈʰ]}} {{lang|kn|ಠ}}, {{IPA|[ɖʱ]}} {{lang|kn|ಢ}}, {{IPA|[pʰ]}} {{lang|kn|ಫ}}, {{IPA|[bʱ]}} {{lang|kn|ಭ}}. The introduction was done so that [[Sanskrit]] (and loanwords into the Kannada language from the donor language Sanskrit) could be written using the Kannada script.\n\nThese changes have facilitated the use of the Kannada script for writing many of the literary Indic languages, including Sanskrit.\n\n=== Obsolete Kannada letters ===\n[[File:Kannada-archaic-n.png|thumb|100px|alt=Archaic n in Kannada script .|Historical form of representing {{lang|kn|ನ್}} in Kannada script.]]\nKannada literary works employed the letters {{lang|kn|ಱ}} (transliterated '{{IAST|ṟ}}' or 'rh') and {{lang|kn|ೞ}} (transliterated '{{IAST|ḻ}}', 'lh' or 'zh'), whose manner of articulation most plausibly could be akin to those in present-day [[Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The letters dropped out of use in the 12th and 18th centuries, respectively. Later Kannada works replaced 'rh' and 'lh' with {{lang|kn|ರ}} (ra) and {{lang|kn|ಳ}} (la) respectively.<ref name=\"kannada literature\">Rice, Edward. P (1921), \"A History of Kannada Literature\", Oxford University Press, 1921: 14–15</ref>\n\nAnother letter (or unclassified ''vyanjana'' (consonant)) that has become extinct is 'nh' or 'inn'. [[File:Kannada-archaic-n.png|10px|baseline|link=Histocal form of 'N'|alt=ನ್]] Likewise, this has its equivalent in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], where it is called ''Nakaara pollu''. The usage of this consonant was observed until the 1980s in Kannada works from the mostly coastal areas of Karnataka (especially the [[Dakshina Kannada]] district). Now, hardly any mainstream works use this consonant. This letter has been replaced by {{lang|kn|ನ್}} (consonant n).{{citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\n=== Kannada script evolution ===\nThe image below shows the evolution of Kannada script<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.classicalkannada.org/DataBase/KannwordHTMLS/CLASSICAL%20KANNADA%20LANGUAGE%20HTML/KANNADA%20SCRIPT-EVOLUTION.htm\n |title        = Kannada script Evolution\n |work         = Official website of the [[Central Institute of Indian Languages]], India\n |publisher    = Classicalkannada.org\n |accessdate   = 12 May 2008\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175750/http://www.classicalkannada.org/DataBase/KannwordHTMLS/CLASSICAL%20KANNADA%20LANGUAGE%20HTML/KANNADA%20SCRIPT-EVOLUTION.htm\n |archive-date = 25 July 2011\n |dead-url     = yes\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> from prehistoric times to the modern period. The Kannada script evolved in stages:\n\nProto-Kannada → Pre–Old Kannada → Old Kannada → Modern Kannada.\n\nThe Proto-Kannada script has its root in ancient [[Brahmi]] and appeared around the 3rd century BC. The Pre-Old-Kannada script appeared around the 4th century AD. Old-Kannada script can be traced to around the 10th century AD, whereas Modern-Kannada script appeared around the 17th century AD.\n\n{{Anchor|Vowels}}\n\n==Vowel letters==\nThere are thirteen vowel letters ({{lang|kn|ಸ್ವರ}} ''svara'') (14, if we consider obsolete vowel ೠ).\n\n[[File:Kanheri-brahmi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Brahmi script, [[Kanheri Caves]]]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It often uses character replacements  in ways that play on the similarity of their [[glyph]]s via [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] or other resemblance. Additionally, it modifies certain words based on a system of suffixes and alternate meanings. There are many [[dialects]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|linguistic varieties]] in different [[online communities]].\n\nThe term \"leet\" is derived from the word ''[[elite]]'', used as an adjective to describe formidable prowess or accomplishment, especially in the fields of [[online game|online gaming]] or [[Hacker (hobbyist)|computer hacking]]. The leet lexicon includes spellings of the word as ''1337'' or ''l33t''.\n\n==History==\nLeet originated within [[bulletin board system]]s (BBS) in the 1980s,<ref name=mitchell>Mitchell.</ref><ref name=bbc>An Explanation of l33t Speak.</ref> where having \"elite\" status on a BBS allowed a user access to file folders, games, and special chat rooms.  The [[Cult of the Dead Cow]] hacker collective has been credited with the original coining of the term, in their text-files of that era.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mello|first=John P.|url=http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/Google-Expands-Bug-Bounty-Program-81668.html|title=Google Expands Bug Bounty Program|date=February 2, 2015|website=E-Commerce Times}}</ref>  One theory is that it was developed to defeat text filters created by BBS or [[Internet Relay Chat]] [[system operators]] for message boards to discourage the discussion of forbidden topics, like [[Software cracking|cracking]] and [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]].<ref name=mitchell/> Creative misspellings and ASCII-art-derived words were also a way to attempt to indicate one was knowledgeable about the culture of computer users. \n\nOnce the reserve of [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]], crackers, and [[script kiddie]]s, leet has since entered the mainstream.<ref name=mitchell/> It is now also used to mock [[newbie|newbies]], also known colloquially as noobs, or newcomers, on web sites, or in gaming communities.<ref name=rome>Rome.</ref> Some consider [[emoticon]]s and [[ASCII art]], like smiley faces, to be leet, while others maintain that leet consists of only symbolic word encryption. More obscure forms of leet, involving the use of symbol combinations and almost no letters or numbers, continue to be used for its original purpose of encrypted communication. It is also sometimes used as a script language. Variants of leet have been used for censorship purposes for many years; for instance \"@$$\" (ass) and \"$#!+\" (shit) are frequently seen to make a word appear censored to the untrained eye but obvious to a person familiar with leet.\n\nLeet symbols, especially the number 1337, are [[Internet meme]]s that have spilled over into popular culture. Signs that show the numbers \"1337\" are popular motifs for pictures and shared widely across the Internet.\n\n==Orthography==\n\nOne of the hallmarks of leet is its unique approach to [[orthography]], using substitutions of other characters, letters or otherwise, to represent a letter or letters in a word.<ref name=sterling>Sterling, 70.</ref><ref name=\"goss 80\">Blashki & Nichol, 80.</ref> For more-casual use of leet, the primary strategy is to use [[homoglyph]]s, symbols that closely resemble (to varying degrees) the letters for which they stand. The choice of symbol is not fixed—anything the reader can make sense of is valid. However, this practice is not extensively used in regular leet; more often it is seen in situations where the [[argot]] (i.e., secret language) characteristics of the system are required, either to exclude newbies or outsiders in general, i.e., anything that the ''average'' reader ''cannot'' make sense of is valid; a valid reader should himself try to make sense, if deserving of the underlying message. Another use for Leet orthographic substitutions is the creation of paraphrased passwords.<ref name=mitchell/> Limitations imposed by websites on password length (usually no more than 36) and the characters permitted (usually alphanumeric and underscore){{citation needed|date=October 2017}} require less extensive forms of Leet when used in this application.\n\nSome examples of leet include ''[[B1ff]]'' and ''[[Newbie|n00b]]'', a term for the stereotypical [[newbie]]; the l33t programming language; and the web-comic ''[[Megatokyo]]'', which contains characters who speak leet.\n\n==Morphology==\n\nText rendered in leet is often characterized by distinctive, recurring forms.\n\n;''-xor'' suffix\n:The meaning of this suffix is parallel with the English ''-er'' and ''-or'' suffixes (seen in ''hacker'' and ''lesser'')<ref name=bbc/> in that it derives [[agent noun]]s from a verb [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]. It is realized in two different forms: ''-xor'' and ''-zor'', {{IPAc-en|-|s|ɔːr}} and {{IPAc-en|-|z|ɔːr}}, respectively. For example, the first may be seen in the word ''hax(x)or'' (''H4x0r'' in leet) {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|k|s|ɔːr}} and the second in ''[[pwn]]zor'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|z|ɔːr}}. Additionally, this [[nominalization]] may also be [[inflection|inflected]] with all of the suffixes of regular [[English verbs]]. The letter 'o' is often replaced with the numeral 0.\n\n;''-age'' suffix\n:Derivation of a noun from a verb stem is possible by attaching ''-age'' to the base form of any verb. Attested derivations are ''pwnage'', ''skillage'',  and ''speakage''. However, leet provides exceptions; the word ''leetage'' is acceptable, referring to actively being ''leet''.<ref name=\"goss 79\">Blashki & Nichol, 79.</ref> These nouns are often used with a form of \"to be\" rather than \"to have,\" e.g., \"that was pwnage\" rather than \"he has pwnage\". Either is a more emphatic way of expressing the simpler \"he pwns,\" but the former implies that the person is ''embodying'' the trait rather than merely possessing it.\n\n;''-ness'' suffix\n:Derivation of a noun from an adjective stem is done by attaching ''-ness'' to any adjective. This is entirely the same as the English form, except it is used much more often in Leet. Nouns such as ''lulzness'' and ''leetness'' are derivations using this suffix.\n\n;Words ending in ''-ed''\n:When forming a past participle ending in ''-ed'', the Leet user may replace the ''-e'' with an apostrophe, as was common in [[poetry]] of previous centuries, (e.g. \"pwned\" becomes \"pwn'd\"). Sometimes, the apostrophe is removed as well (e.g. \"pwned\" becomes \"pwnd\"). The word ending may also be substituted by ''-t'' (e.g. ''pwned'' becomes ''pwnt'').<ref name=\"blanc33\">LeBlanc, 33.</ref>\n\n;Use of the ''-&'' suffix\n:Words ending in ''-and'', ''-anned'', ''-ant'', or a similar sound can sometimes be spelled with an [[ampersand]] (''&'') to express the ending sound (e.g. \"This is the [[Sandbox (software development)|s&box]],\" \"I'm sorry, you've been b&\", \"&hill/&farm\"). This is most commonly used with the word ''banned.'' An alternate form of \"B&\" is \"B7\", as the ampersand is typed with the \"7\" key in the standard US keyboard layout.  It is often seen in the phrase \"IBB7\" (in before banned), which indicates that the poster believes that a previous poster will soon be banned from the site, channel, or board on which they are both posting.\n\n==Grammar==\n\nLeet can be pronounced as a single syllable, {{IPA|/ˈliːt/}}, rhyming with ''eat,'' by way of [[aphesis]] of the initial vowel of \"elite\". It may also be pronounced as two syllables, {{IPA|/ɛˈliːt/}}. Like [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], leet enjoys a looser grammar than standard English.<ref name=rome/> The loose grammar, just like loose spelling, encodes some level of emphasis, ironic or otherwise. A reader must rely more on intuitive [[parsing]] of leet to determine the meaning of a sentence rather than the actual sentence structure. In particular, speakers of leet are fond of [[verbing]] nouns, turning verbs into nouns (and back again) as forms of emphasis, e.g. \"Austin rocks\" is weaker than \"Austin roxxorz\" (note spelling), which is weaker than \"Au5t1N is t3h r0xx0rz\" (note grammar), which is weaker than something like \"0MFG D00D /\\Ü571N 15 T3H l_l83Я 1337 Я0XX0ЯZ\" ([[SMS language#Common abbreviations|OMG]], dude, Austin is the [[über]]-elite rocks-er!). In essence, all of these mean \"Austin rocks,\" not necessarily the other options. Added words and misspellings add to the speaker's enjoyment. Leet, like hacker slang, employs analogy in construction of new words. For example, if ''haxored'' is the past tense of the verb \"to hack\" (hack → haxor → haxored), then ''winzored'' would be easily understood to be the past tense conjugation of \"to win,\" even if the reader had not seen that particular word before.\n\nLeet has its own colloquialisms, many of which originated as jokes based on common typing errors, habits of new computer users, or knowledge of [[cyberculture]] and history.<ref name=\"goss 81\">Blashki & Nichol, 81.</ref> Leet is not solely based upon one language or character set. Greek, Russian, and other languages have leet forms, and leet in one language may use characters from another where they are available. As such, while it may be referred to as a \"[[cipher]]\", a \"dialect\", or a \"language\", leet does not fit squarely into any of these categories. The term ''leet'' itself is often written ''31337'', or ''1337'', and many other variations. After the meaning of these became widely familiar, ''10100111001'' came to be used in its place, because it is the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] form of ''1337'' decimal, making it more of a puzzle to interpret.<ref group=\"Notes\">This appears as an in-joke for technical illustrations such as these: [[:Commons:File:Ami encoding.svg|''(a)'']][[:Commons:File:Manchester encoding.svg|''(b)'']]</ref> An increasingly common characteristic of leet is the changing of grammatical usage so as to be deliberately incorrect. The widespread popularity of deliberate misspelling is similar to the cult following of the \"[[All your base are belong to us]]\" phrase. Indeed, the online and computer communities have been international from their inception, so spellings and phrases typical of non-native speakers are quite common.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n\nMany words originally derived from leet slang have now become part of the modern [[Internet slang]], such as \"[[pwn]]ed\".<ref name=mitchell/> The original driving forces of new vocabulary in leet were common misspellings and typing errors such as \"[[teh]]\" (generally considered lolspeak), and intentional misspellings,<ref name=\"goss 83\">Blashki & Nichol, 83.</ref> especially the \"z\" at the end of words (\"skillz\").<ref name=mitchell/> Another prominent example of a surviving leet expression is ''[[w00t]]'', an exclamation of joy.<ref name=bbc/> w00t is sometimes used as a [[backronym]] for \"We owned the other team.\"\n\nNew words (or corruptions thereof) may arise from a need to make one's username unique. As any given Internet service reaches more people, the number of names available to a given user is drastically reduced. While many users may wish to have the username \"CatLover,\" for example, in many cases it is only possible for one user to have the moniker. As such, degradations of the name may evolve, such as \"C@7L0vr.\" As the leet cipher is highly dynamic, there is a wider possibility for multiple users to share the \"same\" name, through combinations of spelling and transliterations.\n\nAdditionally, ''leet''—the word itself—can be found in the [[User (computing)|screen-names]] and [[gamertags]] of many Internet and video games. Use of the term in such a manner announces a high level of skill, though such an announcement may be seen as baseless [[hubris]].<ref name=hope>Computer Hope Dictionary.</ref> <!-- NOTE: ANY FURTHER ADDITIONS MUST HAVE A PROPER REFERENCE OR WILL BE REMOVED PER WP:OR -->\n\n===Terminology and common misspellings===\n\n''[[Warez]]'' (nominally {{IPAc-en|w|ɛər|z}}) is a plural shortening of \"software\", typically referring to cracked and redistributed software.<ref name=hope/> ''[[Phreaking]]'' refers to the hacking of telephone systems and other non-Internet equipment.<ref name=mitchell/> ''[[Teh]]'' originated as a typographical error of \"the\", and is sometimes spelled ''t3h''.<ref name=mitchell/><ref name=\"blanc34 35\">LeBlanc, 34-35.</ref> ''j00'' takes the place of \"you\",<ref name=bbc/> originating from the [[affricate]] sound that occurs in place of the [[palatal approximant]], {{IPA|/j/}}, when ''you'' follows a word ending in an [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] [[plosive]] consonant, such as {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/d/}}. Also, from German, is ''[[wiktionary:Über|über]]'', which means \"over\" or \"above\"; it usually appears as a prefix attached to adjectives, and is frequently written without the [[Umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] over the ''u''.<ref name=dutch>Van de Velde & Meuleman.</ref>\n\n===Haxor and suxxor (suxorz)===\n\n''Haxor'', and derivations thereof, is leet for \"hacker\",<ref name=\"blanc30 32\">LeBlanc, 30; 32.</ref> and it is one of the most commonplace examples of the use of the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' (pronounced suck-zor) is a derogatory term which originated in warez culture and is currently used in multi-user environments such as multiplayer video games and [[instant messaging]]; it, like ''haxor'', is one of the early leet words to use the ''-xor'' suffix. ''Suxxor'' is a modified version of \"sucks\" (the phrase \"to suck\"), and the meaning is the same as the English slang. Its negative definition essentially makes it the opposite of ''roxxor'', and both can be used as a verb or a noun. The letters ''ck'' are often replaced with the Greek Χ (chi) in other words as well.\n\n===n00b===\n{{main|Newbie}}\n\nWithin leet, the term ''n00b'', and derivations thereof, is used extensively. The word means and derives from ''newbie'' (as in new and inexperienced or uninformed),<ref name=\"goss 83\"/><ref name=dutch/><ref name=acronym/> and is used as a means of segregating them as less than the \"elite,\" or even \"normal,\" members of a group.\n\n===Owned and pwned===\n{{Main|Owned|Pwn}}\n\n''Owned'' and ''pwn3d'' (generally pronounced \"owned\" and \"poned\", respectively) both refer to the domination of a player in a video game or argument (rather than just a win), or the successful hacking of a website or computer.<ref name=mitchell/><ref name=dutch/><ref name=\"blanc32 33\">LeBlanc, 32-33.</ref>\n\nAs is a common characteristic of leet, the terms have also been adapted into noun and adjective forms,<ref name=dutch/> ''ownage'' and ''pwnage'', which can refer to the situation of ''pwning'' or to the superiority of its subject (e.g., \"He is a very good player. He is pwnage.\").\n\n===Pr0n<!-- This section is linked from [[Pr0n]] -->===\n\n''Pr0n'' is [[slang]] for ''[[pornography]]''.<ref name=mitchell/> This is a deliberately inaccurate spelling/pronunciation for ''porn'',<ref name=acronym>The Acronym Finder.</ref> where a zero is often used to replace the letter O. It is sometimes used in legitimate communications (such as email discussion groups, [[Usenet]], chat rooms, and Internet web pages) to circumvent language and [[content filter]]s, which may reject messages as offensive or [[spam (electronic)|spam]]. The word also helps prevent [[search engines]] from associating commercial sites with pornography, which might result in unwelcome traffic.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} ''Pr0n'' is also sometimes spelled backwards (n0rp) to further obscure the meaning to potentially uninformed readers.<ref group=\"Notes\">This can be observed by searching for \"n0rp\" on a search engine.</ref> It can also refer to [[ASCII art]] depicting pornographic images, or to photos of the internals of consumer and industrial hardware. ''Prawn'', a spoof of the misspelling, has started to come into use, as well; in ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City]]'', a pornographer films his movies on \"Prawn Island\". Conversely, in the [[Role-playing game|RPG]] ''[[Kingdom of Loathing]]'', ''[[prawn]]'', referring to a kind of [[crustacean]], is spelled ''pr0n'', leading to the creation of food items such as \"pr0n chow mein\".\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Internet|Language}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Calculator spelling]]\n* [[Elitism]]\n* [[Faux Cyrillic]]\n* [[Geek Code]]\n* [[IDN homograph attack]]\n* [[Magic debug values]], specific values written to a PC's memory \n* [[Mojibake]], garbled text, resulting from text being decoded using an unintended character encoding\n* [[Numeronym]], e.g. \"K9\" for \"canine\"\n* [[Rebus]], an allusional device that uses pictures to represent words or parts of words\n* [[SMS language]], a term for the abbreviations and slang used in mobile phone text messaging and other social technology\n* [[Urban Dictionary]], a crowd-sourced slang dictionary\n* [[Verlan]], inversion of syllables in a word\n* [[Jargon File]], is a glossary and usage dictionary of computer programmer slang\n* [[Arabic chat alphabet]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Notes}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite web | url=http://acronymfinder.com/ | title=The Acronym Finder | publisher=Mountain Data Systems, LLC  | accessdate=2007-04-11 }}\n* {{cite web | title=An Explanation of l33t Speak | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A787917 | work=h2g2 | publisher=BBC | date=2002-08-16 | accessdate=2007-03-29 }}\n* {{Cite journal | journal = Australian Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society | volume = 3 | issue=2 |\n title = Game Geek's Goss: Linguistic Creativity In Young Males Within An Online University Forum | last1 = Blashki | first1 = Katherine | last2 = Nichol | first2 = Sophie | year=2005 | pages=77–86 | url = http://www.swinburne.edu.au/sbs/ajets/journal/V3N2/pdf/V3N2-2-Blashki.pdf |format=PDF | postscript = <!--None-->}}\n* {{cite web | title=Computer Hope Dictionary - Game definitions | url=http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/game.htm | publisher=Computer Hope | accessdate=2007-04-02}}\n* {{cite web | url=http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/ | title=The Free Dictionary -- Acronyms  | work=The Free Dictionary | publisher=Farlex, Inc | accessdate=2007-04-11 }}\n* {{cite web|title=Google Directory - Computers |url=http://www.google.org/alpha/Top/Computers/Programming/Languages/Obfuscated/ |accessdate=2007-04-29 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224351/http://www.google.org/alpha/Top/Computers/Programming/Languages/Obfuscated/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}\n* {{cite book|title=E-Mail Essentials: How to Make the Most of E-Communications|last=Haig|first=Matt|year=2001|publisher=Kogan Page|isbn=978-0-7494-3576-9|page=89}}\n* {{cite web | title=\"Is There A Translator in Teh House?\": Cultural and Discourse Analysis of a Virtual Speech Community on an Internet Message Board | last=LeBlanc | first=Tracy Rene | date=2005-04-01 | publisher=Louisiana State University | url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/LeBlanc_thesis.pdf | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703100446/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04072005-145922/unrestricted/LeBlanc_thesis.pdf | archivedate=2007-07-03 | df= }}\n* {{cite web | title=A Leet Primer | last=Mitchell | first=Anthony | date=2006-06-12 | accessdate=2007-04-10 | url=http://www.technewsworld.com/story/47607.html | work=Technology News | publisher=ECT News Network, Inc }}\n* {{Cite journal \n| last1 = Perea | first1 = M. \n| last2 = Duñabeitia | first2 = J.

The inventory of all letters forms the [[alphabet]]. Letters broadly correspond to [[phoneme]]s in the [[spoken language|spoken form of the language]], although there is rarely a consistent, exact correspondence between letters and phonemes.{{Sfn|Rogers|2005|p=13-14}}\n\nThe word ''letter'', borrowed from [[Old French]] ''letre'', entered [[Middle English]] around 1200 CE, eventually displacing the native English term ''bōcstaf'' ([[wikt:bookstaff|bookstaff]]). ''Letter'' is descended from the Latin ''[[wikt:littera|littera]]'', which may have descended from the Greek \"διφθέρα\" (writing tablet), via [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/letter|title=Origin and meaning of letter|last1=Harper|first1=Douglas|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103211458/https://www.etymonline.com/word/letter|archivedate=2017-11-03|deadurl=no|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Definition and usage ==\n{{further|Grapheme|Glyph|Character (symbol)}}\nA letter is a type of [[grapheme]], which is a contrastive unit in a writing system. The contemporary English-language alphabet consists of twenty-six letters, each of which corresponds to one or more sounds. Letters are combined to form words. A letter is classified as either a consonant or a vowel, depending on how its sound is produced (vowels are ''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''y'' and ''w—'' with ''y'' and ''w'' only sometimes classed as vowels{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2019}}). The basic [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]] is used by hundreds of languages around the world.{{Sfn|Rogers|2005|p=4}}\n\nThere are more phonemes in English–about 44–than there are letters of the alphabet.<ref>{{harvnb|Sacks|2003|p=5}}</ref> A letter may therefore be associated with more than one phoneme, with the phoneme determined by the surrounding letters or [[etymology]] of the word. Regional accents have a significant effect; the letter ''a'' can range from five to twelve sounds depending on the origin of the speaker.<ref>{{harvnb|Sacks|2003|p=49}}</ref> As an example of positional effects, the letter ''c'' is pronounced [k] before ''a, o, u,'' or consonants (e.g. ''critical''), but is pronounced [s] before ''e,'' ''i,'' or ''y'' (e.g. ''democracy''). Conversely, the same phoneme may be shared by more than one letter, as shown by the ''c'' and ''s'' in ''fence'' and ''tense''. \n\nA sequence of graphemes representing a phoneme is called a polygraph. A [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] is a case of polygraphy consisting of two graphemes.{{Sfn|Rogers|2005|p=35}} Examples of digraphs in English include ''ch'', ''sh'', and ''th''. A phoneme can also be represented by three letters, called a [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. An example is the combination ''sch'' in German.\n\nSpecific names are associated with letters, which may differ with language, dialect, and history. ''[[Z]]'', for example, is usually called ''zed'' in all English-speaking countries except the US, where it is named ''zee''. As elements of alphabets, letters have prescribed orders, although this too may vary by language. In Spanish, for instance, ''[[ñ]]'' is a separate letter, sorted after ''n''. In English, ''n'' and ''ñ'' are classified alike{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nLetters may also have a numerical or quantitative value. This applies to [[Roman numerals]] and the letters of other writing systems. In English, [[Arabic numerals]] are typically used instead of letters. Greek and Roman letters are used as mathematical symbols in equations and expressions{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nPeople and objects are sometimes named after letters, for one of these reasons:\n# The letter is an abbreviation, e.g. \"G-man\" as slang for a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent, arose as short for \"Government Man\"\n# Alphabetical order used as a counting system, e.g. Plan A, Plan B, etc.; [[alpha ray]], [[beta ray]], [[gamma ray]], [[delta ray|etc.]]\n# The shape of the letter, e.g. [[A-clamp]], [[D-ring]], [[F-clamp]], [[G-clamp]], [[Maze (HM Prison)|H-block]], [[H engine]], [[O-ring]], [[R-clip]], [[U engine]], [[V engine]], [[Z-drive]], a [[river delta|river ''delta'']], [[Block (meteorology)#Omega blocks|''omega'' block]]\n# Other reasons, e.g. [[X-ray]] after \"''x'' the unknown\" in [[algebra]], because the discoverer did not know what they were\n\n=== Classical definition ===\n[[File:Leys d'amors.jpg|thumb|Two pages from the manuscript of the ''[[Leys d'Amors]]'', 14th century]]\n\nThe [[Consistori del Gay Saber]] was the first literary academy in the world and held the [[Floral Games]] to award the best [[troubadour]] with the ''violeta d'aur'' top prize.

Some writing systems have two major types of allographs for each letter: an ''uppercase'' form (also called ''capital'' or ''[[majuscule]]'') and a ''[[lower case|lowercase]]'' form (also called ''minuscule''). Upper- and lowercase letters represent the same sound, but serve different functions in writing. Capital letters are most often used at the beginning of a sentence, as the first letter of a proper name or title, or in headers or inscriptions.{{Sfn|Rogers|2005|p=10-11}} They may also serve other functions, such as in the [[German language]] where all [[noun]]s begin with capital letters{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}. \n\nIn practical terms, tests have proven that lowercase words are easier to read. They also take up less space on the page, a considerable benefit when materials such as paper and ink were scarce and valuable{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\nThe terms ''uppercase'' and ''lowercase'' originated in the days of handset type for printing presses. Individual letter blocks were kept in specific compartments of drawers in a type case. Capital letters were stored in a higher drawer or upper case{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\n=== Typeface and font ===\n{{Main|Typeface|Calligraphy}}{{Citation needed section|date=May 2019}}\nA [[typeface]], or font, is a single, stylistically consistent set of designs for an alphabet. A particular font may alter standard forms of characters, may present them with different optical weight, or may angle or embellish their forms. In [[calligraphy]], letters are artistically handwritten and may or may not be consistent throughout a work.\n\nTypography has traditionally been considered an art form, encompassing both letter design and the relationship of the letters to one another. Type designers strive for clarity and beauty in individual letterforms, as well as character in a font. Old fonts such as Bodoni, Caslon, and Garamond have been in wide use for centuries, with only slight modifications. Advances in print capabilities, new ways of viewing the written word, and changing aesthetics have led to refinements of classic typefaces as well as the introduction of entirely new designs. In the early nineteenth century, sans serif typefaces were first created. [[Serif]]s are the finishing strokes of letters, small extensions considered to enhance readability. Sans serif fonts (such as the one you are reading here) give a modern and informal impression, but are slightly less legible as text than serif faces. Without serifs, an uppercase ''I'' ({{rn|I}}) is indistinguishable from a lowercase ''l'' ({{rn|l}}).\n\n== Letter frequencies ==\n{{Main|Letter frequencies}}\nThe average distribution of letters, or the relative frequency of each letter's occurrence in text in a given language, can be obtained by analyzing large amounts of representative text. This information can be useful in [[cryptography]] and for other purposes, such as song lyrics. Letter frequencies vary in different types of writing{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}.\n\n== History of alphabetic writing ==\n{{Main|History of the alphabet}}\n\nBefore there were alphabets there were pictographs: small pictures representing objects and concepts. Ancient Egyptian examples date to about 3000 BCE<ref name=\"Healey 1990 p. 7\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_KnI588AnkC&pg=PA7|title=The Early Alphabet|last=Healey|first=J.F.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-520-07309-8|series=Reading the past|page=7|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>. {{Citation needed span|text=Pictographs could communicate basic ideas, but were general and ambiguous if they were comprehensible at all. Tense, for example, could not be specified, and symbols do not necessarily carry meaning across cultures. Memorization of tens of thousands of symbols is a daunting task; children from cultures that use logograms–word symbols–to represent words take years longer to learn to read and write than children learning an alphabet. The relative ease of memorizing 26 letters contributed to the spread of literacy throughout the world.|date=May 2019|reason=}}\n\nThe first [[consonantal alphabet]] found emerged around 1800 BCE to represent the language of the Phoenicians, [[Semitic people|Semitic]] workers in Egypt (see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]), and was derived from the alphabetic principles of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Our present Roman system derives from this Phoenician alphabet, which had 22 letters. Nineteen of our present letters evolved from the early Phoenician forms; letter shapes and order of appearance correspond closely. The [[Greek alphabet]], adapted around 800 BCE, added four letters. This was the first alphabet assigning letters not only to [[consonant]] sounds, but also to [[vowel]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}</ref> The Roman Empire brought the development and refinement of our Roman alphabet, beginning around 500 BCE. The Romans added or dropped certain letters to accommodate Greek and Etruscan words; they also experimented with styles such as cursive when writing in ink. By about the fifth century CE, the beginnings of lowercase letterforms began to emerge in Roman writing, but they did not come into common use until the end of the Middle Ages, a thousand years later.\n\n{{Citation needed span|text=More recently, the development of SMS (Short Message Service) technology is eliminating use of unnecessary letters in informal communication. Time pressure and limited character counts have introduced common abbreviations and variations such as gr8fl (grateful) and lite, as well as acronyms like idk (I don't know) and the ubiquitous [[LOL]].|date=May 2019|reason=}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Abecedarium]]\n* [[Artificial script]]\n* [[Character (computing)]]\n* [[Collation]]\n* [[Diacritic]]\n* [[Digraph (orthography)]]\n* [[Glyph]]\n* [[Grapheme]]\n* [[Greek letters used in mathematics]]\n* [[History of the alphabet]]\n* [[Letterform]]\n* [[Ligature (typography)|Ligature]]\n* [[Orthography]]\n* [[Roman letters used in mathematics]]\n* [[Typeface]]\n* [[Typography]]\n* [[Unicode]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{Citation | last = Millard | first = AR | title = The Infancy of the Alphabet | year = 1986 | journal = World Archaeology | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 390–398 | doi=10.1080/00438243.1986.9979978}}\n* {{Cite book|title=Language Visible: unraveling the mystery of the alphabet from A to Z|last=Sacks|first=David|publisher=Broadway Books|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7679-1172-6|edition=First|location=New York|oclc=51210302|ref=CITEREFSacks2003}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Writing Systems|last=Rogers|first=Henry|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2005|isbn=978-0631234647|ref=harv}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Clodd, Edward (1904).

The [[writing system]]s that distinguish between the upper and lower case have two parallel sets of letters, with each letter in one set usually having an equivalent in the other set. The two case variants are alternative representations of the same letter: they have the same name and [[pronunciation]] and are treated identically when sorting in [[alphabetical order]].\n\nLetter case is generally applied in a mixed-case fashion, with both upper- and lower-case letters appearing in a given piece of text. The choice of case is often prescribed by the [[grammar]] of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline. In [[orthography]], the upper case is primarily reserved for special purposes, such as the first letter of a [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] or of a [[proper noun]], which makes the lower case the more common variant in regular text. In some contexts, it is conventional to use one case only. For example, [[Engineering drawing|engineering design drawings]] are typically labelled entirely in upper-case letters, which are easier to distinguish than the lower case, especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small. In [[mathematics]], on the other hand, letter case may indicate the relationship between objects, with upper-case letters often representing \"superior\" objects (e.g. ''X'' could be a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] containing the generic member ''x'').\n\n==Terminology==\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 250\n| image1 = Upper case and lower case types.jpg\n| caption1 = Divided upper and lower type cases with cast metal [[Sort (typesetting)|sort]]s.\n| image2 = UPPER CASE - lower case.jpg\n| caption2 = Layout for type cases.\n}}\nThe terms ''upper case'' and ''lower case'' can be written as two consecutive words, connected with a hyphen (''upper-case'' and ''lower-case'' – particularly if they [[Compound modifier|pre-modify]] another noun<ref name=\"Bloomberg\" />), or as a single word (''uppercase'' and ''lowercase''). These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow [[Drawer (furniture)|drawers]] called ''[[type case]]s'' used to hold the [[movable type]] for [[letterpress printing]]. Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate shallow tray or \"case\" that was located above the case that held the small letters.<ref name=\"Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing\">{{cite book|last1=Hansard|first1=Thomas Curson|title=Typographia, an Historical Sketch of the Origin and Progress of the Art of Printing|date=1825|pages=408, 4806|url=https://archive.org/details/typographiaanhi01hansgoog|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Medieval Calligraphy: Its History and Technique|author=Marc Drogin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oHNtDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA37|page=37|publisher=Courier Corporation|year=1980}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Majuscule}}\n''Majuscule'' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|dʒ|ʌ|s|k|juː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|æ|dʒ|ə|s|k|juː|l}}), for [[Paleography|palaeographers]], is technically any script in which the letters have very few or very short ascenders and descenders, or none at all (for example, the majuscule scripts used in the [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]], or the [[Book of Kells]]). By virtue of their visual impact, this made the term majuscule an apt descriptor for what much later came to be more commonly referred to as uppercase letters.\n\n{{anchor|Minuscule}}\n''Minuscule'' refers to lower-case letters. The word is often spelled ''miniscule'', by association with the unrelated word ''miniature'' and the prefix ''mini-''. This has traditionally been regarded as a spelling mistake (since ''minuscule'' is derived from the word ''minus''<ref name=\"Lewis 1890\" />), but is now so common that some [[dictionaries]] tend to accept it as a nonstandard or variant spelling.<ref name=\"AHD 2000\" /> ''Miniscule'' is still less likely, however, to be used in reference to lower-case letters.\n\n== Typographical considerations ==\nThe [[glyph]]s of lower-case letters can resemble smaller forms of the upper-case glyphs restricted to the base band (e.g. \"C/c\" and \"S/s\", cf. [[small caps]]) or can look hardly related (e.g. \"D/d\" and \"G/g\"). Here is a comparison of the upper and lower case variants of each letter included in the [[English alphabet]] (the exact representation will vary according to the [[typeface]] and [[font]] used):\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:1.5em;text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!style=\"padding:0 1.0em;\"| Upper case\n| A || B || C || D || E || F || G || H || I || J || K || L || M || N || O || P || Q || R || S || T || U || V || W || X || Y || Z\n|-\n!style=\"padding:0 1.0em;\"| Lower case\n| a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || k || l || m || n || o || p || q || r || s || t || u || v || w || x || y || z\n|}\n\n[[Typography|Typographically]], the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small, but that the majuscules generally have the same height (although, depending on the typeface, there may be some exceptions, particularly with ''Q'' and sometimes ''J'' having a descending element; also, various [[diacritic]]s can add to the normal height of a letter). \n\n[[File:Typography Line Terms.svg|thumb|300px|Ascenders (as in \"h\") and descenders (as in \"p\") make the height of lower-case letters vary.]]\nThere is more variation in the height of the minuscules, as some of them have parts higher ([[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]]) or lower ([[descender]]s) than the typical size. Normally, ''b, d, f, h, k, l, t&nbsp;''{{efn|In [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Roman Antiqua]] or other vertical fonts, the defunct [[Long s|Initial or Medial Long-s]], ſ, would have been an ascender; however, in italics, it would have been one of only two letters in the [[English alphabet|English or Expanded Latin Alphabet]] with both an ascender and a descender, the other being ''f''.<br>{{cite book | title = The History and Technique of Lettering | author = Alexander Nesbitt | edition = 1st | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1957 | location = New York City | isbn = 0-486-20427-8}}}} are the letters with ascenders, and ''g, j, p, q, y'' are the ones with  descenders. In addition, with [[Text figures|old-style numerals]] still used by some traditional or classical fonts, ''6'' and ''8'' make up the ascender set, and ''3, 4, 5, 7'' and ''9'' the descender set.\n\n== Bicameral script ==\n{{original research|section|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Fountain pen writing (literacy).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Handwritten]] Cyrillic script]]\n[[File:Adyge alphabet 1927 (1).JPG|thumb|250px|[[Adyghe language|Adyghe]] Latin alphabet, used between 1927 and 1938, was based on Latin script, but did not have capital letters, being unicameral]]\n \nWriting systems using two separate cases are ''bicameral scripts''. Languages that use the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Adlam alphabet|Adlam]], [[Warang Citi]], [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee]], and [[Osage alphabet|Osage]] scripts use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity. Other bicameral scripts, which are not used for any modern languages, are [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Wikipedia articles on Letter case and [[Unicase]] differ in their view of whether [[Old Hungarian alphabet]] actually has letter case distinction.}} [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]], and [[Deseret alphabet|Deseret]]. The [[Georgian alphabet]] has several variants, and there were attempts to use them as different cases, but the modern written [[Georgian language]] does not distinguish case.\n\nMany other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or [[unicase]]. This includes most [[Syllabary|syllabic]] and other non-alphabetic scripts.\n\nIn scripts with a case distinction, lower case is generally used for the majority of text; capitals are used for capitalisation and [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]]. [[Acronym]]s (and particularly initialisms) are often written in [[All caps|all-caps]], depending on [[Acronym#Case|various factors]].\n\n===Capitalisation===\n{{Main article|Capitalization}}\nCapitalisation is the [[writing]] of a [[word]] with its first [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] in uppercase and the remaining letters in lowercase. Capitalisation rules vary by [[language]] and are often quite complex, but in most modern languages that have capitalisation, the first word of every [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] is capitalised, as are all [[proper noun]]s. {{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nCapitalisation in English, in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context (e.g. title vs. heading vs. text), is universally standardised for [[formality|formal]] writing. Capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence, a proper noun, or a [[proper adjective]]. The [[names of the days of the week]] and the names of the months are also capitalised, as are the first-person [[pronoun]] \"I\"<ref name=\"Oliver #1\">{{cite web | url = http://www.eslcafe.com/grammar/using_capital_letters01.html | title = Using Capital Letters (#1) | author = Dennis Oliver | website = Dave's ESL Cafe | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}</ref> and the [[interjection]] \"O\" (although the latter is uncommon in modern usage, with \"oh\" being preferred). There are a few pairs of words of different meanings whose [[list of case sensitive English words|only difference is capitalisation]] of the first letter. [[Honorific]]s and personal [[title]]s showing rank or prestige are capitalised when used together with the name of the person (for example, \"Mr.&nbsp;Smith\", \"Bishop O'Brien\", \"Professor Moore\") or as a direct address, but normally not when used alone and in a more general sense.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://web.mnstate.edu/hanson/MC210/MC210_AP_titles.htm | title = AP Style: Courtesy and Professional Titles | author = Nancy Edmonds Hanson | website = Minnesota State University | date = 25 August 2008 | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://englishplus.com/grammar/00000049.htm | title = Capitalizing Titles of People | website = English Plus | date = 1997–2006 | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}</ref> It can also be seen as customary to capitalise any word – in some contexts even a pronoun<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Capitalization/faq0004.html | title = Capitalization | website = The Chicago Manual of Style Online | access-date = 19 February 2017 }}</ref> – referring to the [[deity]] of a [[Monotheism|monotheistic religion]].\n\nOther words normally start with a lower-case letter. There are, however, situations where further capitalisation may be used to give added emphasis, for example in headings and publication titles (see below). In some traditional forms of poetry, capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a [[Line (poetry)|line of verse]] independent of any grammatical feature.\n\nOther languages vary in their use of capitals. For example, in [[German language|German]] all nouns are capitalised (this was previously common in English as well, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries), while in [[Romance languages|Romance]] and most other European languages the names of the days of the week, the names of the months, and adjectives of nationality, religion and so on normally begin with a lower-case letter.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://libguides.dickinson.edu/c.php?g=56073&p=1112966 | title = Citing Sources: Capitalization and Personal Names in Foreign Languages | website = Waidner-Spahr Library | publisher = Dickinson | access-date = 30 March 2017 }}</ref> On the other hand, in some languages it is customary to capitalise [[T–V distinction|formal polite pronouns]], for example ''De'', ''Dem'' ([[Danish language|Danish]]), ''Sie'', ''Ihnen'' (German), and ''Vd'' or ''Ud'' (short for ''usted'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]).\n\nInformal communication, such as [[texting]], [[instant messaging]] or a handwritten [[sticky note]], may not bother to follow the conventions concerning capitalisation, but that is because its users usually do not expect it to be formal.<ref name=\"Oliver #1\" />\n\n===Exceptional letters and digraphs===\n* The German letter \"[[ß]]\" only used to exist in lower case. The orthographical capitalisation does not concern \"ß\", which never occurs at the beginning of a word, and in the all-caps style it has traditionally been replaced by the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] \"SS\". Since June 2017, however, [[capital ẞ]] is accepted as an alternative in the all-caps style.<ref>Cf. {{citation|first=Kerstin |last=Güthert |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_PM_2017-06-29_Aktualisierung_Regelwerk.pdf|title=PRESSEMITTEILUNG 29.6.2017 Amtliches Regelwerk der deutschen Rechtschreibung aktualisiert |publisher=[[Council for German Orthography]] |accessdate=2017-06-29 |year=2017 |page=1}}.</ref> \n* The Greek upper-case letter \"[[Sigma|Σ]]\" has two different lower-case forms: \"ς\" in word-final position and \"σ\" elsewhere. In a similar manner, the Latin upper-case letter \"[[S]]\" used to have two different lower-case forms: \"s\" in word-final position and \"<big> ſ </big>\" elsewhere. The latter form, called the [[long s]], fell out of general use before the middle of the 19th century, except for the countries that continued to use [[Blackletter]] typefaces such as [[Fraktur]]. When Blackletter type fell out of general use in the mid-20th century, even those countries dropped the long s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n* Unlike most Latin-script languages, which link the dotless upper-case \"[[I]]\" with the dotted lower-case \"i\", [[Turkish language|Turkish]] has both a [[dotted and dotless I]], each in both upper and lower case.

Similarly, in [[South Slavic languages]] whose orthography is coordinated between the Cyrillic and Latin scripts, the Latin digraphs \"[[Lj (letter)|ǈ/ǉ]]\", \"[[Nj (digraph)|ǋ/ǌ]]\" and \"[[Dž (digraph)|ǅ/ǆ]]\" are each regarded as a single letter (like their Cyrillic equivalents \"[[Lje|Љ/љ]]\", \"[[Nje|Њ/њ]]\" and \"[[Dzhe|Џ/џ]]\", respectively), but only in all-caps style should both components be in upper case (e.g. ǈiǉan–ǇIǇAN, ǋoǌa–ǊOǊA, ǅiǆa–ǄIǄA).{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} [[Unicode]] designates a [[Digraph (orthography)#In Unicode|single character]] for each case variant (i.e., upper case, title case and lower case) of the three digraphs.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0180.pdf | title = Latin Extended-B | at = U+01C4, U+01C5, U+01C6, U+01C7, U+01C8, U+01C9, U+01CA, U+01CB, U+01CC | publisher = Unicode | format = PDF | access-date = 5 February 2017 }}</ref>\n* In the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] orthography, the [[ʻOkina|{{okina}}okina]] is a [[phonemic]] symbol that visually resembles a left single [[quotation mark]].

The rules differ substantially between individual house styles.\n\nThe convention followed by many British [[publisher]]s (including scientific publishers, like [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], magazines, like ''[[The Economist]]'' and ''[[New Scientist]]'', and newspapers, like ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'') and also U.S. newspapers, is sentence-style capitalisation in headlines, i.e. capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences. This convention is usually called ''sentence case''. It may also be applied to publication titles, especially in bibliographic references and library catalogues. An example of a global publisher whose English-language house style prescribes sentence-case titles and headings is the [[International Organization for Standardization]].\n\nFor publication titles it is, however, a common typographic practice among both British<ref name=\"Guardian\" /> and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words (and in the United States, this is often applied to headings, too). This family of typographic conventions is usually called ''title case''. For example, R.&nbsp;M. Ritter's ''Oxford Manual of Style'' (2002) suggests capitalising \"the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs, but generally not articles, conjunctions and short prepositions\".<ref name=\"Ritter 2002\" /> This is an old form of [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]], similar to the more modern practice of using a larger or boldface font for titles. The rules which prescribe which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct/incorrect distinction and are not universally standardised; they differ between style guides, although most style guides tend to follow a few strong conventions, as follows:\n* Most styles capitalise all words except for short [[Closed class|closed-class]] words (certain [[Part of speech|parts of speech]], namely, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions); but the first word (always) and last word (in many styles) are also capitalised, regardless of their part of speech. Many styles capitalise longer prepositions such as \"between\" and \"throughout\", but not shorter ones such as \"for\" and \"with\".<ref name=\"Berdine\" /> Typically, a preposition is considered short if it has up to three or four letters.\n* A few styles capitalise all words in title case (the so-called ''start case''), which has the advantage of being easy to implement and hard to get \"wrong\" (that is, \"not edited to style\"). Because of this rule's simplicity, software [[#Case folding|case-folding]] routines can handle 95% or more of the editing, especially if they are programmed for desired exceptions (such as \"FBI\" rather than \"Fbi\").\n* As for whether hyphenated words are capitalised not only at the beginning but also after the hyphen, there is no universal standard; variation occurs [[Linguistic description|in the wild]] and among house styles (e.g., \"The Letter-''C''ase Rule in My Book\"; \"Short-''t''erm Follow-''u''p Care for Burns\"). Traditional copyediting makes a distinction between ''temporary compounds'' (such as many [[Nonce word|nonce]] [novel instance] [[compound modifier]]s), in which every part of the hyphenated word is capitalised (e.g. \"How This Particular Author Chose to Style His ''A''utumn-''A''pple-''P''icking Heading\"), and ''permanent compounds'', which are terms that, although compound and hyphenated, are so well established that dictionaries enter them as [[headword]]s (e.g., \"Short-''t''erm Follow-''u''p Care for Burns\").\n\nTitle case is widely used in many English-language publications, especially in the United States. However, its conventions are sometimes not followed strictly – especially in informal writing.\n\nIn creative typography, such as music record covers and other artistic material, all styles are commonly encountered, including all-lowercase letters and special case styles, such as [[studly caps]] (see below). For example, in the [[wordmark]]s of video games it is not uncommon to use stylised upper-case letters at the beginning and end of a title, with the intermediate letters in small caps or lower case (e.g., [[Arcania: Gothic 4|{{smallcaps|ArcaniA}}]], [[ARMA: Armed Assault|{{smallcaps|ArmA}}]], and  [[DmC: Devil May Cry|DmC]]).\n\n====Multi-word proper nouns====\nSingle-word [[proper nouns]] are capitalised in formal written English, unless the name is intentionally stylised to break this rule (such as the first or last name of [[danah boyd]]).\n\nMulti-word proper nouns include names of organisations, publications, and people. Often the rules for \"title case\" (described in the previous section) are applied to these names, so that non-initial articles, conjunctions, and short prepositions are lowercase, and all other words are uppercase. For example, the short preposition \"of\" and the article \"the\" are lowercase in \"Steering Committee of the Finance Department\". Usually only capitalised words are used to form an [[acronym]] variant of the name, though there is some variation in this.\n\nWith [[personal names]], this practice can vary (sometimes all words are capitalised, regardless of length or function), but is not limited to English names. Examples include the English names [[Tamar of Georgia]] and [[Catherine the Great]], \"[[van (Dutch)|van]]\" and \"der\" in [[Dutch name]]s, \"[[von]]\" and \"zu\" in [[German name|German]], \"de\", \"los\", and \"y\" in [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish names]], \"de\" or \"d'\" in [[French name]]s, and \"ibn\" in [[Arabic name]]s.\n\nSome surname prefixes also affect the capitalisation of the following internal letter or word, for example \"Mac\" in [[Surname#Celtic_compound_names|Celtic names]] and \"Al\" in Arabic names.\n\n===={{Anchor|Special case styles|Special Case Styles|Special-case-styles}}Special case styles====\n{{See also|Naming convention (programming)#Multiple-word identifiers}}\nSome case styles are not used in standard English, but are common in [[computer programming]], product [[brand]]ing, or other specialised fields:\n\n; [[Camel case]] :\"theQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog\" or \"TheQuickBrownFoxJumpsOverTheLazyDog\"<br /> Spaces and [[punctuation]] are removed and the first letter of each word is capitalised. If this includes the first letter of the first word (\"CamelCase\", \"PowerPoint\", \"TheQuick...\", etc.), the case is sometimes called ''upper camel case'' (or, illustratively, ''CamelCase''), ''[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] case'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/brada/archive/2004/02/03/67024.aspx|title=History around Pascal Casing and Camel Casing|publisher=}}</ref> or ''bumpy case''. When the first letter of the first word is lowercase (\"iPod\", \"eBay\", \"theQuickBrownFox...\"), the case is usually known as ''lower camel case'' (illustratively: ''camelCase''). This format has become popular in the branding of [[information technology]] products and services.\n; [[Snake case]] :\"the_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog\"<br /> Punctuation is removed and spaces are replaced by single [[underscore]]s.  Normally the letters share the same case (e.g. \"UPPER_CASE_EMBEDDED_UNDERSCORE\" or \"lower_case_embedded_underscore\") but the case can be mixed, as in [[OCaml]] modules.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/guidelines.en.html|title=Caml programming guidelines|website=caml.inria.fr|language=en|access-date=2017-03-31}}</ref>. The style may also be called ''pothole case'', especially in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming, in which this convention is often used for naming variables. Illustratively, it may be rendered ''snake_case'', ''pothole_case'', etc.  When all-upper-case, it may be referred to as ''screaming snake case'' (or ''SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE'').<ref name=\"Ruby\" />\n; [[Kebab case]]<ref>{{cite web |title=jQuery 3.0 and jQuery Compat 3.0 Alpha Versions Released |url=http://blog.jquery.com/2015/07/13/jquery-3-0-and-jquery-compat-3-0-alpha-versions-released/}}</ref> :\"the-quick-brown-fox-jumps-over-the-lazy-dog\"<br /> Similar to snake case, above, except [[hyphen]]s rather than underscores are used to replace spaces.

Sometimes only [[vowel]]s are upper case, at other times upper and lower case are alternated, but often it is simply random.  The name comes from the sarcastic or ironic implication that it was used in an attempt by the writer to convey their own coolness. It is also used to mock the violation of standard English case conventions by marketers in the naming of computer software packages, even when there is no technical requirement to do so{{snd}}e.g., [[Sun Microsystems]]' naming of a windowing system [[NeWS]].  Illustrative naming of the style is, naturally, random: ''stUdlY cAps'', ''StUdLy CaPs'', etc.\n\n===Unit symbols in the metric system===\n[[File:SI base unit.svg|thumb|Of the seven [[SI base unit|SI base-unit]] symbols, \"A\" ([[ampere]] for [[electric current]]) and \"K\" ([[kelvin]] for [[temperature]]) are always written in upper case, whereas \"s\" ([[second]] for [[time]]), \"m\" ([[metre]] for [[length]]), \"kg\" ([[kilogram]] for [[mass]]), \"cd\" ([[candela]] for [[luminous intensity]]), and \"mol\" ([[Mole (unit)|mole]] for [[amount of substance]]) are written in lower case. (The kelvin, second and kilogram are defined independently of any other units, but the rest depend on the definitions of other base units.)]]\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), a letter usually has different meanings in upper and lower case when used as a unit symbol. Generally, unit symbols are written in lower case, but if the name of the unit is derived from a proper noun, the first letter of the symbol is capitalised (nevertheless, the ''name'' of the unit, if spelled out, is always considered a common noun and written accordingly):<ref name=\"SI brochure\" />\n\n* 1 s (one [[second]]) when used for the [[SI base unit|base unit]] of [[time]].\n* 1 S (one [[siemens (unit)|siemens]]) when used for the unit of [[electric conductance]] and [[admittance]] (named after [[Werner von Siemens]]).\n* 1 Sv (one [[sievert]]), used for the unit of [[ionising radiation]] dose (named after [[Rolf Maximilian Sievert]]).\n\nFor the purpose of clarity, the symbol for [[litre]] can optionally be written in upper case even though the name is not derived from a proper noun:<ref name=\"SI brochure\" />\n\n* 1 l, the original form, for typefaces in which \"digit one\" {{angbr|1}}, \"lower-case ell\" {{angbr|l}}, and \"upper-case eye\" {{angbr|I}} look different.\n* 1 L, an alternative form, for typefaces in which these characters are difficult to distinguish, or the typeface the reader will be using is unknown. A \"[[ℓ|script l]]\" in various typefaces (e.g.: 1&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: cursive;\">l</span>) has traditionally been used in some countries to prevent confusion; however, the separate [[Unicode character]] which represents this, {{Unichar|2113|SCRIPT SMALL L}}, is deprecated by the [[International System of Units|SI]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/beta/nameslist/n_2100.html|title=Letterlike symbols|work=Charts (Beta)|publisher=[[Unicode Consortium]]|accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>  Another solution sometimes seen in [[Web typography]] is to use a serif font for \"lower-case ell\" in otherwise sans-serif material (1&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: serif;\">l</span>).\n\nThe letter case of a prefix symbol is determined independently of the unit symbol to which it is attached. Lower case is used for all submultiple prefix symbols and the small multiple prefix symbols up to \"k\" (for [[kilo-|kilo]], meaning 10<sup>3</sup> = 1000 multiplier), whereas upper case is used for larger multipliers:<ref name=\"SI brochure\" />\n\n* 1 ms, a small measure of time (\"m\" for [[milli-|milli]], meaning 10<sup>−3</sup> = 1/1000 multiplier).\n* 1 Ms, a large measure of time (\"M\" for [[mega-|mega]], meaning 10<sup>6</sup> = 1&nbsp;000&nbsp;000 multiplier).\n* 1 mS, a small measure of electric conductance.\n* 1 MS, a large measure of electric conductance.\n* 1&nbsp;mm, a small measure of [[length]] (the latter \"m\" for [[metre]]).\n* 1 Mm, a large measure of length.\n\n=={{Anchor | Case folding}}Case folding and case conversion==\nIn the [[character set]]s developed for [[computing]], each upper- and lower-case letter is encoded as a separate character. In order to enable case folding and case conversion, the [[software]] needs to link together the two characters representing the case variants of a letter. (Some old character-encoding systems, such as the [[Baudot code]], are restricted to one set of letters, usually represented by the upper-case variants.)\n\n[[Case sensitivity|Case-insensitive]] operations can be said to fold case, from the idea of folding the character code table so that upper- and lower-case letters coincide. The conversion of letter case in a [[String (computer science)|string]] is common practice in computer applications, for instance to make case-insensitive comparisons. Many high-level programming languages provide simple methods for case conversion, at least for the [[ASCII]] character set.\n\nWhether or not the case variants are treated as equivalent to each other varies depending on the computer system and context. For example, user [[password]]s are generally case sensitive in order to allow more diversity and make them more difficult to break. On the other hand, when performing a [[keyword search]], differentiating between the upper and lower case might narrow down the search result too much.\n\n===Unicode case folding and script identification===\n[[Unicode]] defines case folding through the three case-mapping properties of each [[Character (computing)|character]]: upper case, lower case, and title case (in this context, \"title case\" relates to [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s and [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s encoded as mixed-case [[Digraph (orthography)#In Unicode|single characters]], in which the first component is in upper case and the second component in lower case<ref>{{cite web | url = http://unicode.org/faq/casemap_charprop.html#4 | title = Character Properties, Case Mappings & Names FAQ | publisher = Unicode | access-date = 19 February 2017}}</ref>). These properties relate all characters in scripts with differing cases to the other case variants of the character.\n\nAs briefly discussed in [[Unicode]] Technical Note #26,<ref name=\"Unicode\" /> \"In terms of implementation issues, any attempt at a unification of Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [and] make casing operations an unholy mess, in effect making all casing operations context sensitive […]\". In other words, while the shapes of letters like '''A''', '''B''', '''E''', '''H''', '''K''', '''M''', '''O''', '''P''', '''T''', '''X''', '''Y''' and so on are shared between the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets (and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely [[Typography|typographical]] nature), it would still be problematic for a multilingual [[character set]] or a [[font]] to provide only a ''single'' [[code point]] for, say, uppercase letter '''B''', as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower-case letter, the Latin '''b''' (U+0062), Greek '''β''' (U+03B2) or Cyrillic '''в''' (U+0432). Therefore, the corresponding Latin, Greek and Cyrillic upper-case letters (U+0042, U+0392 and U+0412, respectively) are also encoded as separate characters, despite their appearance being basically identical. Without letter case, a \"unified European alphabet\"{{spaced ndash}}such as '''ABБCГDΔΕЄЗFΦGHIИJ'''…'''Z''', with an appropriate subset for each language{{spaced ndash}}is feasible; but considering letter case, it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols.\n\n===Methods in word processing===\nMost modern [[word processor]]s provide automated case conversion with a simple click or keystroke. For example, in Microsoft Office Word, there is a dialog box for toggling the selected text through UPPERCASE, then lowercase, then Title Case (actually start caps; exception words must be lowercased individually). The keystroke {{keypress|shift|F3}} does the same thing.\n\n===Methods in programming===\nIn some forms of [[BASIC]] there are two methods for case conversion:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"qbasic\">\n UpperA$ = UCASE$(\"a\")\n LowerA$ = LCASE$(\"A\")\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n[[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], as well as any C-like language that conforms to its [[C standard library|standard library]], provide these functions in the file [[ctype.h]]:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n char upperA = toupper('a');\n char lowerA = tolower('A');\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nCase conversion is different with different [[character sets]]. In [[ASCII]] or [[EBCDIC]], case can be converted in the following way, in C:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c\">\n #define toupper(c) (islower(c) ? (c) – 'a' + 'A' : (c))\n #define tolower(c) (isupper(c) ? (c) – 'A' + 'a' : (c))\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis only works because the letters of upper and lower cases are spaced out equally. In ASCII they are consecutive, whereas with EBCDIC they are not; nonetheless the upper-case letters are arranged in the same pattern and with the same gaps as are the lower-case letters, so the technique still works.\n\nSome computer programming languages offer facilities for converting text to a form in which all words are capitalised.  [[Visual Basic]] calls this \"proper case\"; [[Python (programming language)|Python]] calls it \"title case\".  This differs from usual [[Capitalization#Sentence case versus title case|title casing]] conventions, such as the English convention in which minor words are not capitalised.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 250\n| image1 = Arch.of.Titus-Inscription.jpg\n| caption1 = Latin majuscule inscription on the [[Arch of Titus]] (82 CE)\n| image2 = I littera in manuscripto.jpg\n| caption2 = Papyrus fragment with old Roman cursive script from the reign of [[Claudius]] (41–54 CE)\n| image3 = Codex Ebnerianus Prolog J 1, 5b-10.JPG\n| caption3 = Example of Greek minuscule text [[Codex Ebnerianus]] ({{circa}} 1100 CE)\n}}\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 250\n| image1 = A Typesetters Sorting Case.jpg\n| caption1 = Combined case with capital letters above small letters\n| image2 = 2 job cases.jpg\n| caption2 = Late 19th-century mixed cases\n| image3 = PrintMus 026.jpg\n| caption3 = Demonstrating the use of a [[composing stick]] in front of divided upper and lower type cases at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, California, United States, North America.\n}}\nOriginally [[alphabet]]s were written entirely in majuscule letters, spaced between well-defined upper and lower bounds. When written quickly with a [[pen]], these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms. It is from these that the first minuscule hands developed, the [[half-uncial]]s and cursive minuscule, which no longer stayed bound between a pair of lines.<ref name=\"Harris 2003\" /> These in turn formed the foundations for the [[Carolingian minuscule]] script, developed by [[Alcuin]] for use in the court of [[Charlemagne]], which quickly spread across Europe. The advantage of the minuscule over majuscule was improved, faster readability.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn [[Latin]], [[Papyrus|papyri]] from [[Herculaneum]] dating before 79 CE (when it was destroyed) have been found that have been written in old [[Roman cursive]], where the early forms of minuscule letters \"d\", \"h\" and \"r\", for example, can already be recognised. According to papyrologist [[Knut Kleve]], \"The theory, then, that the lower-case letters have been developed from the fifth century [[uncial]]s and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong.\"<ref name=\"Kleve 1994\" /> Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed, but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral: a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed. European languages, except for [[Ancient Greek]] and Latin, did not make the case distinction before about 1300.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe timeline of writing in Western Europe can be divided into four eras:{{fact|date=October 2017}}\n*Greek majuscule (9th–3rd century BCE) in contrast to the Greek [[uncial script]] (3rd century BCE&nbsp;– 12th century CE) and the later Greek minuscule\n*[[Roman square capitals|Roman majuscule]] (7th century BCE&nbsp;– 4th century CE) in contrast to the Roman uncial (4th–8th century CE), [[Roman Half Uncial]], and minuscule\n*[[Carolingian]] majuscule (4th–8th century CE) in contrast to the [[Carolingian minuscule]] (around 780&nbsp;– 12th century)\n*[[Blackletter|Gothic]] majuscule (13th and 14th century), in contrast to the early Gothic (end of 11th to 13th century), Gothic (14th century), and late Gothic (16th century) minuscules.\n\nTraditionally, certain letters were rendered differently according to a set of rules.  In particular, those letters that began sentences or nouns were made larger and often written in a distinct script. There was no fixed capitalisation system until the early [[18th century]]. The [[English language]] eventually dropped the rule for nouns, while the German language keeps it.\n\nSimilar developments have taken place in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the [[Greek alphabet]] has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form (that is, characterized by ascenders and descenders) in the 8th century. Over time, uncial letter forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the [[Uspenski Gospels]] (MS 461) in the year 835.<ref>The earliest known biblical manuscript is a palimpsest of Isajah in Syriac, written in 459/460. [[Bruce M. Metzger]] & [[Bart D. Ehrman]], ''The Text of the New Testament'' ([[Oxford University Press]]: 2005), p. 92.</ref> The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today).{{fact|date=October 2017}}\n\n[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|center|700px\n|Simplified relationship between various scripts leading to the development of modern lower case of standard Latin alphabet and that of the modern variants [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] (used in Germany [[Antiqua–Fraktur dispute|until 1940s]]) and [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] (used in Ireland). Several scripts coexisted such as [[half-uncial]] and [[uncial]], which derive from [[Roman cursive]] and [[Greek uncial]], and [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian (Luxeuil variant here)]] and [[Beneventan script|Beneventan]].  The [[Carolingian script]] was the basis for [[blackletter]] and [[humanist minuscule]]. What is commonly called \"Gothic writing\" is technically called blackletter (here [[Textualis|textualis quadrata]]) and is completely unrelated to Visigothic script.\n\nThe letter j is i with a [[Swash (typography)|flourish]], u and v are the same letter in early scripts and were used depending on their position in insular half-uncial and caroline minuscule and later scripts, w is a ligature of vv, in insular the [[rune]] [[wynn]] is used as a w (three other runes in use were the [[Thorn (letter)|thorn]] (þ), ʻféʼ (ᚠ) as an abbreviation for cattle/goods and maðr (ᛘ) for man).\n\nThe letters y and z were very rarely used, in particular þ was written identically to y so y was dotted to avoid confusion, the dot was adopted for i only after late-caroline (protogothic), in beneventan script the [[Scribal abbreviation|macron abbreviation]] featured a dot above.\n\nLost variants such as [[r rotunda]], ligatures and [[Scribal abbreviation|scribal abbreviation marks]] are omitted; [[long s]] is shown when no terminal s (the only variant used today) is preserved from a given script.\n\n[[Humanist sans-serif|Humanist script]] was the basis for Venetian [[Typeface|types]] which changed little until today, such as [[Times Roman|Times New Roman]] ([[Serif|a serifed typeface]]).\n]]\n\n===Type cases===\nThe individual type blocks used in hand [[typesetting]] are stored in shallow wooden or metal drawers known as \"[[type case]]s\". Each is subdivided into a number of compartments (\"boxes\") for the storage of different individual letters.{{fact|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe ''Oxford Universal Dictionary on Historical Advanced Proportional Principles'' (reprinted 1952) indicates that ''case'' in this sense (referring to the box or frame used by a compositor in the printing trade) was first used in English in 1588. Originally one large case was used for each typeface, then \"divided cases\", pairs of cases for majuscules and minuscules, were introduced in the region of today's Belgium by 1563, England by 1588, and France before 1723.\n\nThe terms ''upper'' and ''lower'' case originate from this division. By convention, when the two cases were taken out of the storage rack, and placed on a rack on the [[Compositor (typesetting)|compositor]]'s desk, the case containing the capitals and small capitals stood at a steeper angle at the back of the desk, with the case for the small letters, punctuation and spaces being more easily reached at a shallower angle below it to the front of the desk, hence upper and lower case.<ref name=\"Bolton 1997\" />\n\nThough pairs of cases were used in English-speaking countries and many European countries in the seventeenth century, in Germany and Scandinavia the single case continued in use.<ref name=\"Bolton 1997\" />\n\nVarious patterns of cases are available, often with the compartments for lower-case letters varying in size according to the frequency of use of letters, so that the commonest letters are grouped together in larger boxes at the centre of the case.<ref name=\"Bolton 1997\" /> The compositor takes the letter blocks from the compartments and places them in a [[composing stick]], working from left to right and placing the letters upside down with the nick to the top, then sets the assembled type in a [[Galley proof|galley]].<ref name=\"Bolton 1997\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[All caps]]\n* [[CamelCase]]\n* [[Capitalisation]]\n* [[Drop cap]]\n* [[Punctuation]]\n* [[Roman cursive]]\n* [[Roman square capitals]]\n* [[Shift key]]\n* [[Small caps]]\n* [[Studly caps]]\n* [[Text figures]]\n* [[Unicase]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist | refs =\n<ref name=\"AHD 2000\">{{cite book |title=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |edition=4th |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=2000 |location=Boston and New York |isbn=978-0-395-82517-4}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Berdine\">{{cite web |url=http://adminsecret.monster.com/training/articles/358-what-to-capitalize-in-a-title |title=What to Capitalize in a Title |author=Currin Berdine |website=AdminSecret |accessdate=23 February 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bloomberg\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jhsph.edu/news/style_manual/h.html |title=The School’s Manual of Style |publisher=Johns Hopkins, Bloomberg School of Public Health |accessdate=9 November 2018}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Bolton 1997\">{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/typecases/index.htm |title=Type Cases |author=David Bolton |publisher=The Alembic Press |year=1997 |accessdate=23 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716153655/http://members.aol.com/typecases/index.htm |archivedate=16 July 2007}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-t |title=The Guardian and Observer Style Guide |accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Harris 2003\">{{cite book |author=David Harris |title=The Calligrapher's Bible |publisher=Barron's |year=2003 |location=Hauppauge, NY |isbn=0-7641-5615-2}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Kleve 1994\">{{cite book |author=Knut Kleve |authorlink=Knut Kleve |chapter=The Latin Papyri in Herculaneum |title=Proceedings of the 20th International Congress of Papyrologists, Copenhagen, 23–29 August 1992 |publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |year=1994 |location=Copenhagen}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lewis 1890\">{{cite book |author=Charlton T.

The difference is in the diacritic added to the vowel stroke. These diacritics do not show vowel stress, tone or length as can be in other languages or writing systems. Luo is a tonal language i.e. the same written word said in a different tone can mean a different thing. These tones vary within vowels but are never written thereby making it important to get the right context of the word.

Some did not even have any punctuation at all. In the Luo system commas, full-stops, slash, colon, semi-colon, question marks, brackets, hyphens, etc. are borrowed from the Latin system and are used in the same way. Mathematical or scientific symbols are also borrowed from the Latin system in the western world. These symbols include $, %, @, &, +, =, etc.\n\n== History ==\nThe need to write Luo in a different script other than the Latin script has always been there since the introduction of the English alphabet by colonialists. However, there has not been a good reason why none was developed earlier. Other [[Writing systems of Africa|African writing systems]] have been developed before and some are still in use today. Work on the Luo alphabet started in 2009 by Kefa Ombewa. At the same time Paul Sidandi started his work on Luo numerals independently. The two men met on Twitter in 2013 and decided to combine the alphabet and the numerals to be a single project and the font produced was named KefaSidandi font. Digitization of the work started with a lot of challenges. Initially only a bitmap-font was available. Thereafter in order to produce the true-type font internet usage, Will Were joined to produce the font glyphs. The work was completed on June 12, 2012 when the first true-type font was produced. This led to the ability to embed the script on the Luo Alphabet website and made the font downloadable for other interested users. The Luo alphabet first came into the limelight in Kenya when Kefa Ombewa conducted an interview with Kenya Television Network (KTN) in 2014.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kefaombewa.com Luo Alphabet]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMTleXNYnrE Interview with Kefa Ombewa]\n* [https://www.omniglot.com/writing/luo.htm Omniglot]\n{{List of writing systems}}\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:Scripts not encoded in Unicode]]\n[[Category:Writing systems of Africa]]"

It is written vertically from top to bottom, with columns proceeding from left to right.\n\n== History ==\n=== ''Tongki fuka akū hergen'' ===\nAccording to the ''Veritable Records'' ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|lang=mnc|ᠮᠠᠨᠵᡠ ᡳ<br>ᠶᠠᡵᡤᡳᠶᠠᠨ<br>ᡴᠣᠣᠯᡳ}}|v=manju i yargiyan kooli}}; {{zh|c=滿洲實錄|p=Mǎnzhōu Shílù}}), in 1599 the [[Jianzhou Jurchen|Jurchen]] leader [[Nurhaci]] decided to convert the [[Mongolian script|Mongolian alphabet]] to make it suitable for the Manchu people. He decried the fact that while illiterate Han Chinese and Mongolians could understand their respective languages when read aloud, that was not the case for the Manchus, whose documents were recorded by Mongolian scribes. Overriding the objections of two advisors named Erdeni and G'ag'ai, he is credited with adapting the Mongolian script to Manchu. The resulting script was known as {{transl|mnc|tongki fuka akū hergen}} ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᡨᠣᠩᡴᡳ<br>ᡶᡠᡴᠠ<br>ᠠᡴᡡ<br>ᡥᡝᡵᡤᡝᠨ}}}}) (\"script without dots and circles\").\n\n=== ''Tongki fuka sindaha hergen'' ===\nIn 1632, [[Dahai]] added diacritical marks to clear up a lot of the ambiguity present in the original Mongolian script; for instance, a leading ''[[k]]'', ''[[g]]'', and ''[[h]]'' are distinguished by the placement of no diacritical mark, a dot, and a circle respectively. This revision created the Standard script, known as {{lang|mnc|tongki fuka sindaha hergen}} ({{Lang-mnc|m={{ManchuSibeUnicode|ᡨᠣᠩᡴᡳ<br>ᡶᡠᡴᠠ<br>ᠰᡳᠨᡩᠠᡥᠠ<br>ᡥᡝᡵᡤᡝᠨ}}}}) (\"script with dots and circles\"). As a result, the Manchu alphabet contains little ambiguity. Recently discovered manuscripts from the 1620s make clear, however, that the addition of dots and circles to Manchu script began before their supposed introduction by Dahai.\n\nDahai also added ten graphemes (''tulergi hergen'': \"foreign (outer) letters\"), to allow Manchu to be used to write Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan loanwords. Previously, these words contained sounds that did not have corresponding letters in Manchu.<ref>Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 50. Brill, 2002.</ref>\nSounds that were transliterated included the aspirated sounds k' (Chinese pinyin: k, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᠺ}}), k (g, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡬ}}), x (h, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡭ}}); ts' (c, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡮ}}); ts (ci, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡮ᠊ᡟ}}); sy (si, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᠰ᠊ᡟ}}); dz (z, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡯ}}); c'y (chi, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡱᡟ}}); j'y (zhi, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡷᡟ}}); and ž (r, {{MongolUnicode|lang=mnc|valign=middle|ᡰ}}).<ref>Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", pages 71-72. Brill, 2002.</ref>\n<!-- it would be nice if the symbols for these could be added -->\n\n=== 19th Century – present ===\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, there were three styles of writing Manchu in use: standard script (''ginggulere hergen''), semi-cursive script (''gidara hergen''), and cursive script (''lasihire hergen''). Semicursive script had less spacing between the letters, and cursive script had rounded tails.<ref>Gorelova, L: \"Manchu Grammar\", page 72. Brill, 2002.</ref>\n\nThe Manchu alphabet was also used to write Chinese.

(1963) ''A Grammar of the Mongol Language''. New York, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. p. 15.</ref> When learning the language, Manchus were taught at once to say la, lo, etc., instead of saying I, a---la; I, o---lo; etc. As a result, the syllables contained in their syllabary do not contain all possible combinations that can be formed with their letters. They made, for instance, no such use of the consonants I, m, n, and r, as westerners do when they called them liquid; hence if the Manchu letters s, m, a, r, t, were joined in that order, a Manchu would not pronounce them as English-speaking people pronounce the word smart.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zppFAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false Meadows 1849], p. 3.</ref>\n\nToday, the opinion on whether it is alphabet or syllabic in nature is still split between different experts. In China, it is considered syllabic and Manchu is still taught in this manner, while in the West it is treated like an alphabet.  The alphabetic approach is used mainly by foreigners who want to learn the language, as studying the Manchu script as a syllabary takes a longer time.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6fqJL619dlgC&q=Alphabet%3A+Some+scholars+consider+the+Manchu+script+to+be+a+syllabic+one.#v=snippet&q=Alphabet%3A%20Some%20scholars%20consider%20the%20Manchu%20script%20to%20be%20a%20syllabic%20one.&f=false\n|title=Manchu: a textbook for reading documents\n|volume=\n|series=\n|year=2000\n|author=Gertraude Roth Li\n|editor=\n|publisher=University of Hawaii Press\n|edition=\n|location=\n|isbn=978-0824822064\n|quote=Alphabet: Some scholars consider the Manchu script to be a syllabic one.\n|page=16\n|accessdate=25 March 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1bArr1-E5mQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=manchu+language#v=onepage&q=some%20scholars%20consider%20script%20syllabic%20one%20hundreds&f=false\n|title=Manchu: A Textbook for Reading Documents (Second Edition)\n|volume=\n|year=2010\n|author=Gertraude Roth Li\n|editor=\n|publisher=Natl Foreign Lg Resource Ctr\n|edition=2\n|location=\n|isbn=978-0980045956\n|quote=Alphabet: Some scholars consider the Manchu script to be a syllabic one.

Unlike Egyptian writing, there was a simple one-to-one correspondence between the two forms of Meroitic, except that in the cursive form, consonants are joined in [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s to a following vowel '''i'''.\n\nThe direction of cursive writing was from right to left, top to bottom, while the monumental form was written top to bottom in columns going right to left. Monumental letters were oriented to face the beginning of the text, a feature inherited from their hieroglyphic origin.\n\nBeing primarily alphasyllabaric, the Meroitic script worked differently than Egyptian hieroglyphs. Some scholars, such as [[Harald Haarmann]], believe that the vowel letters of Meroitic are evidence for an influence of the [[Greek alphabet]] in its development.\n\nThere were 23 letters in the Meroitic alphasyllabary, including four vowels. In the transcription established by Hintze (based off earlier versions by Griffith), they are: \n*'''a''' appears only at the beginning of a word\n*'''e''' was used principally in foreign names \n*'''i''' and '''o''' were used like vowels in the Latin or Greek alphabets.\nThe fifteen consonants are conventionally transcribed: \n*'''p''', '''b''', '''m''', '''d''', '''t''', '''s''', '''n''', '''r''', '''l''', '''k''', '''q''', '''ḫ''', '''ẖ''', '''w''', '''y'''\nThese consonants are understood to have an inherent vowel value /a/, such that '''p''' should generally be understood as /pa/.\nAn additional series of characters is understood to represent consonants with inherent vowels other than /a/:\n*'''ne''', '''se''', '''te''', '''to'''\n\nThese values were established from evidence such as Egyptian names borrowed into Meroitic. That is, the Meroitic letter which looks like an owl in monumental inscriptions, or like a numeral three in cursive Meroitic, we transcribe as '''m''', and it is believed to have been pronounced as [m]. However, this is a historical reconstruction, and while '''m''' is not in much doubt, the pronunciations of some of the other letters are much less certain.\n\nThe three vowels '''i a o''' were presumably pronounced /i a u/. '''Ḫ''' is thought to have been a [[voiceless velar fricative|velar fricative]], as the ''ch'' in Scottish ''loch'' or German ''Bach.'' '''H̱''' was a similar sound, perhaps [[uvular consonant|uvular]] as ''g'' in Dutch ''dag'' or [[palatal consonant|palatal]] as in German ''ich''. '''Q''' was perhaps a [[voiceless uvular stop|uvular stop]], as in Arabic ''Qatar''. '''S''' may have been like ''s'' in ''sun''. An /n/ was omitted in writing when it occurred before any of several other consonants within a word. '''D''' is uncertain. Griffith first transcribed it as ''r,'' and Rowan believes that was closer to its actual value. It corresponds to Egyptian and Greek /d/ when initial or after an /n/ (unwritten in Meroitic), but to /r/ between vowels, and does not seem to have affected the vowel '''a''' the way the other alveolar obstruents '''t n s''' did.\n\nComparing late documents with early ones, it is apparent that the sequences ''sel-'' and ''nel-,'' which Rowan takes to be /sl/ and /nl/ and which commonly occurred with the determiner ''-l-,'' [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilated]] over time to ''t'' and ''l'' (perhaps /t/ and /ll/).\n\nThe only [[punctuation mark]] was a [[word divider|word and phrase divider]] of two to three dots.\n\n==Principles==\nMeroitic was a type of alphabet called an [[abugida]]: The vowel /a/ was not normally written; rather it was assumed whenever a consonant was written alone. That is, the single letter '''m''' was read /ma/. All other vowels were overtly written: the letters '''mi''', for example, stood for the syllable /mi/, just as in the Latin alphabet. This system is broadly similar to the [[Brahmic family|Indian abugidas]] that arose around the same time as Meroitic.\n\n===Griffith and Hintze===\nGriffith identified the essential abugida nature of Meroitic when he deciphered the script in 1911. He noted in 1916 that certain consonant letters were never followed by a vowel letter, and varied with other consonant letters. He interpreted them as [[syllable|syllabic]], with the values ''ne, se, te,'' and ''to.'' ''Ne,'' for example, varied with ''na.'' ''Na'' could be followed by the vowels ''i'' and ''o'' to write the syllables ''ni'' and ''no,'' but was never followed by the vowel ''e.''\n\nHe also noted that the vowel ''e'' was often omitted. It often occurred at the ends of Egyptian loanwords that had no final vowel in [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. He believed that ''e'' functioned both as a [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}} and a [[virama|\"killer\" mark]] that marked the absence of a vowel. That is, the letter '''m''' by itself was read {{IPA|[ma]}}, while the sequence '''me''' was read {{IPA|[mə]}} or {{IPA|[m]}}. This is how [[Ethiopic script|Ethiopic]] works today. Later scholars such as Hitze and Rilly accepted this argument, or modified it so that ''e'' could represent either {{IPA|[e]}} or schwa–zero.\n\nIt has long been puzzling to epigraphers why the syllabic principles that underlie the script, where every consonant is assumed to be followed by a vowel ''a,'' should have special letters for consonants followed by ''e.'' Such a mixed abugida–syllabary is not found among the abugidas of India, nor in Ethiopic.  [[Old Persian cuneiform]] script is somewhat similar, with more than one inherent vowel, but is not an abugida because the non-inherent vowels are written with full letters, and are often redundantly written after an inherent vowel other than /a/.\n\n===Millet and Rowan===\nMillet (1970) proposed that Meroitic ''e'' was in fact an [[epenthetic vowel]] used to break up Egyptian [[consonant cluster]]s that could not be pronounced in the Meroitic language, or appeared after final Egyptian consonants such as ''m'' and ''k'' which could not occur finally in Meroitic. Rowan (2006) takes this further and proposes that the glyphs ''se, ne,'' and ''te'' were not syllabic at all, but stood for consonants {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}} at the end of a word or morpheme (as when followed by the [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] ''-l;'' she proposes Meroitic finals were restricted to [[alveolar consonant]]s such as these. An example is the Coptic word {{Coptic|ⲡⲣⲏⲧ}} ''prit'' \"the agent\", which in Meroitic was transliterated ''perite (pa-e-ra-i-te).'' If Rowan is right and this was pronounced {{IPA|/pᵊrit/}}, then Meroitic would have been a fairly typical abugida. She proposes that Meroitic had three vowels, {{IPA|/a i u/}}, and that {{IPA|/a/}} was raised to something like {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ə]}} after the alveolar consonants {{IPA|/t s n/}}, explaining the lack of orthographic ''t, s, n'' followed by the vowel letter ''e.''\n\nVery rarely does one find the sequence [[Consonant|C]][[Vowel|V]]C, where the C's are both labials or both velars. This is similar to consonant restrictions found throughout the Afro-Asiatic language family, suggesting to Rowan that there is a good chance Meroitic was an [[Afro-Asiatic language]] like Egyptian.\n\nRowan is not convinced that the system was completely alphabetic, and suggests that the glyph ''te'' also may have functioned as a [[determinative]] for place names, as it frequently occurs at the end of place names that are known not to have a /t/ in them. Similarly, ''ne'' may have marked royal or divine names.\n\n== Unicode ==\n\n{{Main|Meroitic Hieroglyphs (Unicode block)|Meroitic Cursive (Unicode block)}}\n\nMeroitic scripts, both Hieroglyphic and Cursive, were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in January, 2012 with the release of version 6.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Meroitic Hieroglyphs is U+10980&ndash;U+1099F. \nThe Unicode block for Meroitic Cursive is U+109A0&ndash;U+109FF.\n\n{{Unicode chart Meroitic Hieroglyphs}}\n{{Unicode chart Meroitic Cursive}}\n\nAs a Meroitic Unicode font you may use Aegyptus which can be downloaded from [http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/ Unicode Fonts for Ancient Scripts].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Afro-Asiatic]] Languages\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|url=http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/12837/|title=A phonological investigation into the Meroitic 'syllable' signs ''ne'' and ''se'' and their implications on the ''e'' sign|last=Rowan|first=Kirsty|year=2006|work=SOAS Working Papers in Linguistics, Volume 14|pages=131–167|accessdate=2013-10-24}}\n\nTörök, László (1998).

Writing in Mongolian script]]\nThe Mongolian vertical script developed as an adaptation of the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] for the Mongolian language.<ref name=\"Daniels1996\" />{{rp|545}} From the seventh and eighth to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the Mongolian language separated into southern, eastern and western dialects. The principal documents of the middle period are: in the eastern dialect, the famous text ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]'', monuments in the [['Phags-pa script|Square script]], materials of the {{ill|Chinese–Mongolian glossary of the fourteenth century|zh|华夷译语}}, and materials of the Mongolian language of the middle period in Chinese transcription, etc.; in the western dialect, materials of the Arab–Mongolian and Persian–Mongolian dictionaries, Mongolian texts in Arabic transcription, etc. The main features of the period are that the vowels ''ï'' and ''i'' had lost their phonemic significance, creating the ''i'' phoneme (in the [[Chakhar Mongolian|Chakhar dialect]], the Standard Mongolian in [[Inner Mongolia]], these vowels are still distinct); inter-vocal consonants ''γ''/''g'', ''b''/''w'' had disappeared and the preliminary process of the formation of Mongolian long vowels had begun; the initial ''h'' was preserved in many words; grammatical categories were partially absent, etc. The development over this period explains why the Mongolian script looks like a vertical Arabic script (in particular the presence of the dot system).<ref name=\"Poppe1974\" />{{rp|1–2}}\n\nEventually, minor concessions were made to the differences between the Uyghur and Mongol languages: In the 17th and 18th centuries, smoother and more angular versions of the letter ''[[Tsade|tsadi]]'' became associated with {{IPA|[dʒ]}} and {{IPA|[tʃ]}} respectively, and in the 19th century, the [[Manchu script|Manchu]] hooked ''[[yodh]]'' was adopted for initial {{IPA|[j]}}. ''[[Zayin|Zain]]'' was dropped as it was redundant for {{IPA|[s]}}. Various schools of orthography, some using [[diacritic]]s, were developed to avoid ambiguity.<ref name=\"Daniels1996\" />{{rp|545}}\n\nMongolian is [[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts|written vertically]]. The Uyghur script and its descendants — Mongolian, Oirat Clear, Manchu, and Buryat — are the only vertical scripts written from left to right. This developed because the Uyghurs rotated their [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]]-derived script, originally written right to left, 90 degrees counterclockwise to emulate Chinese writing, but without changing the relative orientation of the letters.<ref name=\"Kara2\">György Kara, \"Aramaic Scripts for Altaic Languages\", in Daniels & Bright ''[[The World's Writing Systems]],'' 1994.</ref>\n\n[[File:Богд хааны бичгийн хэрэглэл.jpg|thumb|alt=[[Writing implements]] of the [[Bogd Khan]]|[[Writing implements]] of the [[Bogd Khan]]]]\nThe [[reed pen]] was the writing instrument of choice until the 18th century, when the [[ink brush|brush]] took its place under Chinese influence.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZhGza8C77kC&lpg=PA1&pg=PT419#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Learn World Calligraphy: Discover African, Arabic, Chinese, Ethiopic, Greek, Hebrew, Indian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, Thai, Tibetan Calligraphy, and Beyond|last=Shepherd|first=Margaret|date=2013-07-03|publisher=Potter/Ten Speed/Harmony/Rodale|isbn=978-0-8230-8230-8|language=en}}</ref>{{rp|422}} Pens were also historically made of wood, reed, bamboo, bone, bronze, or iron.

First, after overcoming the Uyghur script ductus, it was [[Traditional Mongolian alphabet|used for Mongolian]] itself.\n\n=== Clear script (Oirat alphabet) ===\n{{Main|Clear script}}\nIn 1648, the Oirat Buddhist monk [[Zaya Pandit|Zaya-pandita Namkhaijamco]] created this variation with the goals of bringing the written language closer to the actual pronunciation of [[Oirat language|Oirat]] and making it easier to transcribe [[Classical Tibetan|Tibetan]] and [[Sanskrit]]. The script was used by the [[Kalmyks]] of [[Russia]] until 1924, when it was replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet. In [[Xinjiang]], China, the [[Oirats|Oirat people]] still use it.\n\n=== Manchu alphabet ===\n{{Main|Manchu alphabet}}\nThe Manchu alphabet was developed from the Mongolian script in the early 17th century to write the [[Manchu language]].  A variant is still used to write [[Xibe language|Xibe]]. It is also used for [[Daur language|Daur]]. Its folded variant may for example be found on Chinese [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Seal (East Asia)|seals]].\n\n=== Vagindra alphabet ===\n{{Main|Vagindra script}}\nAnother alphabet, sometimes called ''Vagindra'' or ''Vaghintara'', was created in 1905 by the [[Buryats|Buryat]] monk [[Agvan Dorjiev]] (1854–1938). It was also meant to reduce ambiguity, and to support the [[Russian language]] in addition to Mongolian. The most significant change, however, was the elimination of the positional shape variations. All letters were based on the medial variant of the original Mongol alphabet. Fewer than a dozen books were printed using it.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n=== Evenki alphabet ===\n{{Main|Evenki alphabet}}\nThe [[Qing dynasty]] [[Qianlong Emperor]] erroneously identified the Khitan people and their language with the [[Solons]], leading him to use the [[Solon language]] (Evenki) to \"correct\" Chinese character transcriptions of Khitan names in the History of Liao in his \"Imperial Liao Jin Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation\" (欽定遼金元三史國語解/钦定辽金元三史国语解 Qīndìng Liáo Jīn Yuán Sānshǐ Guóyǔjiě) project. The Evenki words were written in the Manchu script in this work.\n\nIn the 1980s, an experimental alphabet for [[Evenki language|Evenki]] was created.\n\n== Additional characters ==\n=== Galik characters ===\n{{Main|Galik alphabet}}\nIn 1587, the translator and scholar [[Ayuush Güüsh]] ({{lang|mn-Cyrl|Аюуш гүүш}}) created the Galik alphabet ({{lang|mn-Cyrl|Али-гали}}), inspired by the third [[Dalai Lama]], [[3rd Dalai Lama|Sonam Gyatso]].

It includes letters, digits and various punctuation marks for [[Hudum Mongolian]], [[Clear script|Todo Mongolian]], [[Xibe script|Xibe (Manchu)]], [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu proper]], and [[Galik alphabet|Ali Gali]], as well as extensions for transcribing [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tibetan script|Tibetan]].\n\n{{Unicode chart Mongolian}}\n\nThe Mongolian Supplement block (U+11660–U+1167F) was added to the Unicode Standard in June, 2016 with the release of version 9.0:\n\n{{Unicode chart Mongolian Supplement}}\n\n=== Font issues ===\nAlthough the Mongolian script has been defined in Unicode since 1999, there was no native support for Unicode Mongolian from the major vendors until the release of the [[Windows Vista]] operating system in 2007 and fonts need to be installed in [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows 2000]] to show properly, and so Unicode Mongolian is not yet widely used. In China, [[legacy encoding]]s such as the [[Private Use Areas]] (PUA) Unicode mappings and [[GB18030]] mappings of the [[Menksoft IMEs]] (espc. [[Menksoft Mongolian IME]]) are more commonly used than Unicode for writing web pages and electronic documents in Mongolian.\n\nThe inclusion of a Unicode Mongolian font and keyboard layout in Windows Vista has meant that Unicode Mongolian is now gradually becoming more popular,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} but the complexity of the Unicode Mongolian encoding model and the lack of a clear definition for the use variation selectors are still barriers to its widespread adoption, as is the lack of support for inline vertical display.  As of 2015 there are no fonts that successfully display all of Mongolian correctly when written in Unicode. A report published in 2011 revealed many shortcomings with automatic rendering in all three Unicode Mongolian fonts the authors surveyed, including Microsoft's [[Mongolian Baiti]].<ref name=\"err\">{{cite journal|author=Biligsaikhan Batjargal|title=A Study of Traditional Mongolian Script Encodings and Rendering: Use of Unicode in OpenType fonts|journal=International Journal of Asian Language Processing|year=2011|volume=21|issue=1|pages=23–43|url=http://www.colips.org/journals/volume21/21.1.3-Biligsaikhan.pdf|accessdate=2011-09-10|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Mongolian language support has suffered from buggy implementations: the initial version of Microsoft's [[Mongolian Baiti]] font (version 5.00) was, in the supplier's own words, \"almost unusable\",<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929763 Version 5.00 of the Mongolian Baiti font may be displayed incorrectly in Windows Vista]</ref> and as of 2011 there remain some minor bugs with the rendering of suffixes in [[Firefox]].<ref>[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=490534 Bug 490534 – ZWJ and NNBSP rendered incorrectly in scripts like Mongolian]</ref>  Other fonts, such as Monotype's ''Mongol Usug'' and Myatav Erdenechimeg's ''MongolianScript'', suffer even more serious bugs.<ref name=\"err\" />\n\nIn January 2013, [[Menksoft]] released several OpenType Mongolian fonts, delivered with its Menksoft Mongolian IME 2012. These fonts strictly follow Unicode standard, i.e. ''bichig'' is no longer realized as \"B+I+CH+I+G+FVS2\" (incorrect) but \"B+I+CH+I+G\" (correct), which is not done by Microsoft and Founder's ''Mongolian Baiti'', Monotype's ''Mongol Usug'', or Myatav Erdenechimeg's ''MongolianScript''.<ref>''Menk Qagan Tig'', ''Menk Hawang Tig'', ''Menk Garqag Tig'', ''Menk Har_a Tig'', and ''Menk Scnin Tig''.</ref> However, due to the impact of Mongolian Baiti, many still use the Microsoft defined incorrect realization \"B+I+CH+I+G+FVS2\", which results in an incorrect rendering in correctly-designed fonts like ''Menk Qagan Tig''.\n\nMongolian script can be represented in [[LaTeX]] with the MonTeX package.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ctan.org/pkg/montex |title=CTAN: Package montex |website=ctan.org |access-date=2018-01-21}}</ref>\n\nSometimes even if a font is installed the script may display as horizontal rather than vertical depending on the operating system or font.\n\n==== Sample ====\nIn text sample below, the appearance of the scripts should match.

Unlike Arabic, it obligatorily marks both [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] and [[vowel]]s. N'Ko tones are marked as [[diacritic]]s, in a similar manner to the marking of some vowels in Arabic.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Grave of Kanté Soulemane, inventeur de l'alphabet N'Ko.jpg|thumb|Grave of Kanté Souleymane. The word \"N'Ko\" is visible at the right of the second line.]]\nKante created N'Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a culture-less people, because before then, no indigenous African writing system for his language existed. N'Ko was invented in [[Bingerville]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and then brought to Kante's natal region of [[Kankan]], [[Guinea]] before being disseminated into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N'Ko Alphabet Day is April 14, relating to the date in 1949 when the script is believed to have been finalized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Oyler|first=Dianne White|title=The History of N'ko and its Role in Mande Transnational Identity: Words as Weapons|date=November 2005|publisher=Africana Homestead Legacy Publishers|isbn=978-0-9653308-7-9|page=1}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of the script led to a movement promoting literacy in the N'Ko script among Manding speakers in both Anglophone and Francophone West Africa. N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the Maninka cultural identity in Guinea, and it has also strengthened the Manding identity in other parts of West Africa.<ref>Oyler, Dianne White (1994) ''Mande identity through literacy, the N'ko writing system as an agent of cultural nationalism''. Toronto: African Studies Association.</ref>\n\n==Current use==\nAs of 2005, it is used mainly in [[Guinea]] and the [[Ivory Coast]] (respectively by [[Maninka language|Maninka]] and [[Dyula language|Dyula]] speakers), with an active user community in [[Mali]] (by [[Bambara language|Bambara]]-speakers). Publications include a translation of the [[Quran]], a variety of textbooks on subjects such as [[physics]] and [[geography]], poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers. It has been classed as the most successful of the West African scripts.<ref>Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization. In ''The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts'', ed. by Joshua A. Fishman and Ofelia García, pp. 23–32. New York: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nN'Ko literature generally uses a [[literary language]] register, termed ''kangbe'' (literally, 'clear language'), that is seen as a potential [[compromise dialect]] across [[Manding languages]].<ref>[http://www.fakoli.net/nko/tutorial/intro.html N'Ko Language Tutorial: Introduction]</ref> For example, the word for 'name' in Bamanan is ''tɔgɔ'' and in Maninka it is ''tɔɔ''. In written communication each person will write it one single way in N'Ko, and yet read and pronounce it as in their own language. This literary register is thus intended as a ''[[Koiné language|koiné]]'' blending elements of the principal [[Manding languages]] (which are mutually intelligible), but has a very strong Maninka flavour.\n\nThere has also been documented use of N'Ko, with additional diacritics, for traditional religious publications in the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Fon language|Fon]] languages of [[Benin]] and southwest [[Nigeria]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160205162413/http://www.restorationhealing.com/ganhumehan-vodun-book Axɔ́sú Àgèlògbàgàn Àgbɔ̀vì, Gànhúmehàn Vodún]</ref>\n\n==Letters==\nThe N'Ko script is written from right to left, with letters being connected to one another.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"\n! {{IPA|ɔ}} || {{IPA|o}} || {{IPA|u}} || {{IPA|ɛ}} || {{IPA|i}} || {{IPA|e}} || {{IPA|a}}\n|-\n| {{script|Nko|ߐ}} || {{script|Nko|ߏ}} || {{script|Nko|ߎ}} || {{script|Nko|ߍ}} || {{script|Nko|ߌ}} || {{script|Nko|ߋ}} || {{script|Nko|ߊ}}\n|-\n| [[File:NKo Aw.svg]] || [[File:NKo O.svg]] || [[File:NKo Uh.svg]] || [[File:NKo Eh.svg]] || [[File:NKo E.svg]] || [[File:NKo A.svg]] || [[File:NKo Ah.svg]]\n|}\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"\n! r || d || ch || j || t || p || b\n|-\n| {{script|Nko|ߙ}} || {{script|Nko|ߘ}} || {{script|Nko|ߗ}} || {{script|Nko|ߖ}} || {{script|Nko|ߕ}} || {{script|Nko|ߔ}} || {{script|Nko|ߓ}}\n|-\n| [[File:NKo R.svg]] || [[File:NKo D.svg]] || [[File:NKo Ch.svg]] || [[File:NKo J.svg]] || [[File:NKo T.svg]] || [[File:NKo P.svg]] || [[File:NKo B.svg]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"\n! m || l || k || f || gb || s || rr\n|-\n| {{script|Nko|ߡ}} || {{script|Nko|ߟ}} || {{script|Nko|ߞ}} || {{script|Nko|ߝ}} || {{script|Nko|ߜ}} || {{script|Nko|ߛ}} || {{script|Nko|ߚ}}\n|-\n| [[File:NKo M.svg]] || [[File:NKo L.svg]] || [[File:NKo K.svg]] || [[File:NKo F.svg]] || [[File:NKo Gb.svg]] || [[File:NKo S.svg]] || [[File:NKo Rr.svg]]\n|- bgcolor=\"#f0f0f0\"\n! n' || || y || w || h || n || ny\n|-\n| {{script|Nko|ߒ}} || || {{script|Nko|ߦ}} || {{script|Nko|ߥ}} || {{script|Nko|ߤ}} || {{script|Nko|ߣ}} || {{script|Nko|ߢ}}\n|-\n| [[File:NKo Ng.svg]] || || [[File:NKo Y.svg]] || [[File:NKo W.svg]] || [[File:NKo H.svg]] || [[File:NKo N.svg]] || [[File:NKo Ny.svg]]\n|}\n\n===Tones===\nN'Ko uses [[diacritic]]al marks to denote [[Tone (linguistics)|tonality]] and [[vowel length]].

From the 1990s onwards, there were efforts to develop fonts and even web content by adapting other software and fonts. A [[DOS]] word processor named Koma Kuda was developed by Prof. Baba Mamadi Diané from [[Cairo University]].<ref>Personal note from the LISA/Cairo conference, in Dec. 2005, Don Osborn</ref> However the lack of intercompatibility inherent in such solutions was a block to further development.\n\n[[Pango]] 1.18 and [[GNOME]] 2.20 have native support for the N'Ko languages. An [[iOS]] calculator in N'Ko, N'Ko:Calc, is available on the Apple [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]. An iOS app for sending email in N'Ko is also available, called Triage-N'Ko. There is a virtual keyboard named virtual-keyboard-nko to type N'Ko characters on the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] operating system.\n\nA N'Ko font, Conakry, is available for [[Windows 8]], [[macOS]], and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]]-[[LibreOffice]]'s [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]] engine, which was developed by [[SIL International]].<ref>{{Cite news\n| last = Rosenberg\n| first = Tina\n| title = Everyone Speaks Text Message\n| work = New York Times\n| accessdate = 2013-12-22\n| date = 2011-12-09\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/magazine/everyone-speaks-text-message.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\n}}</ref>\n\n===Unicode===\n\n{{Further|NKo (Unicode block)}}\n\nN'Ko script was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in July 2006 with the release of version 5.0.\n\n[[UNESCO]]'s Programme Initiative B@bel supported preparing a proposal to encode N'Ko in [[Unicode]].

      "title": "Name-letter effect",

      "text": "{{featured article}}\nThe '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.\n\nDiscovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.\n\nMost people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].\n\nThere is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.\n\n== Background ==\nSystematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}\n\n[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. \"on\" or \"off\"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}\n\nAround 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a \"mere belongingness\" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}\n\n== First study ==\nIn his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}\n\n=== Method ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:15px; margin-down:0; font-size:10pt; line-height:11pt;text-align:center;\"\n|+First 11 stimuli for a yoke\n|-\n!colspan=2|Irma Maes\n!colspan=2|Jef Jacobs\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| A || U || A || U\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| M || D || M || D\n|-\n| T ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| R || T || R\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| I || G || I  || G\n|-\n| V ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| S || V || S\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| E || N || E || N\n|-\n|style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| A || P || A || P\n|-\n| L ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| M || L || M\n|-\n| H || F || H ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| F\n|-\n| E || I ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| E || I\n|-\n| J || K ||style=\"background:silver; font-weight:bold;\"| J || K\n|}\n\nTo find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}\n\nFor example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}\n\nIn the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}\n\n=== Discussion ===\nNuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article \"Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect\", in which \"beyond Gestalt\" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and \"beyond awareness\" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}\n\n== Second study ==\nIn 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}\n\n=== Method ===\nCross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}\n\n=== Discussion ===\nAcross languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}\n\nNuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}\n\nThe data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}\n\nAs in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}\n\n== Reception ==\nIn the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect \"so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]\".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}\n\nThis all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called \"seminal\" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIn her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:\n\n* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}\n* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}\n* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}\n* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}\n* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}\n* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}\n\n== Explanations ==\nVarious explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.\n\n=== Disproved causes ===\n\n==== Mere exposure ====\nPeople may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of \"reaching an asymptote\".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}\n\n==== Subjective frequency ====\nSubjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}\n\n==== Evaluative conditioning ====\n[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}\n\n==== Subjective ownership ====\nSubjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}\n\n==== Mastery pleasure ====\nThe letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}\n\n=== Probable cause ===\nThe effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}\n\n==== Mere ownership ====\nNuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.\n\n* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}\n* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}\n* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}\n\n==== Implicit self-esteem ====\nAnother group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}\n\n* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}\n* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}\n* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}\n* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as \"honest\" and \"lonely\". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}\n* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}\n\n== Application ==\nIn [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}\n\nThe Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}\n\nThere is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called \"I-algorithm\"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}\n\nStieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}\n\n== Wider implications ==\nResearchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.\n\n=== In the lab ===\nIn controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&nbsp;Honda&nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}\n\nWiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&nbsp;\"I\" and \"my\" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}\n\nA study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}\n\n=== Outside the lab ===\n==== Controversial studies ====\nResearchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}\n\nSimonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters \"Den\" compared to with \"Wal\", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more \"Den\" dentists than \"Wal\" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[[Google+]]&nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}\n\nDyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 \"Saint cities\" in the US, such as&nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}\n\nSimonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}\n\nA few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}\n\nIn response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&nbsp;has coined&nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}\n\n==== Undisputed studies ====\n[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]\nResearch by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{cite journal |last1=Abel |first1=Ernest L. |last2=Kruger |first2=Michael L. |year=2007 |title=Symbolic significance of initials on longevity |journal=[[Perceptual and Motor Skills]] |volume=104 |issue=1 |pages=179–182 |doi=10.2466/pms.104.1.179-182 |pmid=17450979 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Albers |first1=L. |last2=Rotteveel |first2=M. |last3=Dijksterhuis |first3=A. |year=2009 |title=Towards optimizing the name letter test as a measure of implicit self-esteem |journal=Self and Identity |volume=8 |pages=63–77 |doi=10.1080/15298860802091062 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Alluisi |first1=E.

There are roughly 400 surviving orthodox inscriptions on stone monuments throughout Ireland and western Britain; the bulk of which are in southern [[Munster]].<ref>McManus (1991) is aware of a total of 382 orthodox inscriptions. The later scholastic inscriptions have no definite endpoint and continue into the Middle Irish and even Modern Irish periods, and record also names in other languages, such as Old Norse, (Old) Welsh, Latin and possibly Pictish.\nSee Forsyth, K.; \"Abstract: The Three Writing Systems of the Picts.\" in Black et al.

One possible origin is from the Irish ''og-úaim'' 'point-seam', referring to the seam made by the point of a sharp weapon.<ref>(MacManus, §8.6)</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n{{alphabet}}\nIt is generally thought that the earliest inscriptions in ogham date to about the 4th century AD,<ref>O'Kelly 1989, p. 250</ref> but [[James Carney (scholar)|James Carney]] believed its origin is rather within the 1st century BC.<ref>Carney, James. ''The Invention of the Ogam Cipher'' 'Ériu', 1975, p. 57, Dublin: Royal Irish Academy</ref> Although the use of \"classical\" ogham in stone inscriptions seems to have flowered in the 5th and 6th centuries around the [[Irish Sea]], from the phonological evidence it is clear that the alphabet predates the 5th century. A period of writing on wood or other perishable material prior to the preserved monumental inscriptions needs to be assumed, sufficient for the loss of the phonemes represented by ''[[úath]]'' (\"H\") and ''[[straif]]'' (\"Z\" in the manuscript tradition, but probably \"F\" from \"SW\"), ''[[gétal]]'' (representing the velar nasal \"NG\" in the manuscript tradition, but etymologically probably \"GW\"), all of which are clearly part of the system, but unattested in inscriptions.\n\nIt appears that the ogham alphabet was modelled on another script,<ref>[[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Macalister, R. A. Stewart]], ''The Secret Languages of Ireland'' reprinted by Craobh Rua Books, Armagh 1997.</ref> and some even consider it a mere cipher of its template script (Düwel 1968:<ref>Düwel, Klaus. \"Runenkunde\" (runic studies). Stuttgart/Weimar: Metzler, 1968. OCLC 183700</ref> points out similarity with [[Cipher runes|ciphers of Germanic runes]]). The largest number of scholars favours the [[Latin alphabet]] as this template,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Everyday Life of the Pagan Celts|last = Ross|first = Anne|publisher = Carousel|year = 1972|isbn = 0 552 54021 8|location = London|pages = 168}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Celtic Realms|last = Dillon|first = Myles|publisher = Cardinal|year = 1973|isbn = 0 351 15808 1|location = London|pages = 258|last2 = Chadwick|first2 = Nora}}</ref> although the [[Elder Futhark]] and even the [[Greek alphabet]] have their supporters.<ref>''The Secret Languages of Ireland'' as above.</ref> Runic origin would elegantly explain the presence of \"H\" and \"Z\" letters unused in Irish, as well as the presence of vocalic and consonantal variants \"U\" vs. \"W\", unknown to Latin writing and lost in Greek (cf. [[digamma]]). The Latin alphabet is the primary contender mainly because its influence at the required period (4th century) is most easily established, being widely used in neighbouring Roman [[Roman Britain#4th century|Britannia]], while the runes in the 4th century were not very widespread even in [[continental Europe]].\n\nIn Ireland and in Wales, the language of the monumental stone inscriptions is termed [[Primitive Irish]]. The transition to [[Old Irish]], the language of the earliest sources in the Latin alphabet, takes place in about the 6th century.<ref>Thurneysen, Rudolf ''A Grammar of Old Irish''. Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies. 1980, etc. pp. 8–11.</ref> Since ogham inscriptions consist almost exclusively of personal names and marks possibly indicating land ownership, linguistic information that may be glimpsed from the Primitive Irish period is mostly restricted to [[phonology|phonological]] developments.\n\n===Theories of origin===\n[[File:Book of Ballymote 170r.jpg|thumb|upright|Fol. 170r of the [[Book of Ballymote]] (1390), the ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' explaining the ogham script]]\nThere are two main schools of thought among scholars as to the motivation for the creation of ogham. Scholars such as Carney and MacNeill have suggested that ogham was first created as a cryptic alphabet, designed by the Irish so as not to be understood by those with a knowledge of the Latin alphabet.<ref>Carney, J (1975) \"The Invention of the Ogam Cipher\", ''[[Ériu (journal)|Ériu]]'', Vol. 22, pp. 62–63</ref><ref>MacNeill, Eoin (1931) \"Archaisms in the Ogham Inscriptions\", ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'', Vol. 39, pp. 33–53, Dublin {{oclc|246466439}}</ref> In this school of thought, it is asserted that \"the alphabet was created by Irish scholars or druids for political, military or religious reasons to provide a secret means of communication in opposition to the authorities of Roman Britain.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=Catriona |title=Border States in the Work of Tom Mac Intyre: A Paleo-Postmodern Perspective |date=2012 |publisher=Cambridge Scholars |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDcsBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA21&lpg=PA21&dq=Border+States+in+the+Work+of+Tom+Mac+Intyre:+A+Paleo-Postmodern+Perspective&source=bl&ots=dBDOq3FyFa&sig=R15T08-XNX-Qe1mwXh1g42GIcTM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjG79-C1vLfAhUOKKwKHYj_BzsQ6AEwBXoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=Border%20States%20in%20the%20Work%20of%20Tom%20Mac%20Intyre%3A%20A%20Paleo-Postmodern%20Perspective&f=false |accessdate=16 January 2019}}</ref> The Roman Empire, which then ruled over neighbouring southern Britain, represented a very real threat of invasion to Ireland, which may have acted as a spur to the creation of the alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ryan |title=Border States |pages=204-205}}</ref> Alternatively, in later centuries when the threat of invasion had receded and the Irish were themselves invading the western parts of Britain, the desire to keep communications secret from Romans or Romanised Britons would still have provided an incentive.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} With bilingual ogham and Latin inscriptions in Wales, however, one would suppose that the ogham could easily be decoded by anyone in the Post-Roman world.<ref>Thurneysen, R. ''A Grammar of Old Irish'' pages 9–10: \"... In Britain ... most of these inscriptions are bilingual, with a Latin version accompanying the Ogam\". Macalister, ''The Secret Languages of Ireland'' p. 19: \"The reader has only to jot down a few sentences in this alphabet to convince himself that it can never have been used for any extended literary purpose.\"</ref>\n\nThe second main school of thought, put forward by scholars such as McManus,<ref>MacManus 1988, pp. 7, 41, 1991</ref> is that ogham was invented by the first Christian communities in early Ireland, out of a desire to have a unique alphabet for writing short messages and inscriptions in the Irish language. The argument is that the sounds of Primitive Irish were regarded as difficult to transcribe into the Latin alphabet, so the invention of a separate alphabet was deemed appropriate. A possible such origin, as suggested by McManus (1991:41), is the early Christian community known to have existed in Ireland from around AD 400 at the latest, the existence of which is attested by the mission of [[Palladius (bishop of Ireland)|Palladius]] by [[Pope Celestine I]] in AD 431.\n\nA variation is that the alphabet was first invented, for whatever reason, in 4th-century Irish settlements in west [[History of Wales|Wales]] after contact and intermarriage with Romanised Britons with a knowledge of the Latin alphabet.<!-- Are you sure? Did not Ogham appear in South West Ireland before the influx of Irish to Wales? -->{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} In fact, several ogham stones in Wales are bilingual, containing both Irish and [[British Latin]], testifying to the international contacts that led to the existence of some of these stones.<ref>''The New Companion to the Literature of Wales'', by Meic Stephens, p. 540; http://ogham.lyberty.com/mackillop.html</ref>\n\nA third theory put forward by the noted ogham scholar [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|R. A. S. Macalister]] was influential at one time, but finds little favour with scholars today.<ref>Macalister, R. A. S. ''The Secret Languages of Ireland'', pp. 27–36, Cambridge University Press, 1937</ref> Macalister believed that ogham was first invented in Cisalpine Gaul around 600 BC by Gaulish druids as a secret system of [[Scholastic ogham#Hand signals|hand signals]], and was inspired by a form of the Greek alphabet current in Northern Italy at the time. According to this theory, the alphabet was transmitted in oral form or on wood only, until it was finally put into a written form on stone inscriptions in early Christian Ireland. Later scholars are largely united in rejecting this theory, however,<ref>McManus 1988, pp. 22–23, 1991</ref> primarily because a detailed study of the letters{{citation needed|date=July 2010}} shows that they were created specifically for the Primitive Irish of the early centuries AD. The supposed links with the form of the Greek alphabet that Macalister proposed can also be disproved.{{citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nMacalister's theory of hand or finger signals as a source for ogham is a reflection of the fact that the [[signary]] consists of four groups of five letters, with a sequence of strokes from one to five. A theory popular among modern scholars is that the forms of the letters derive from the various numerical [[tally marks|tally-mark]] systems in existence at the time. This theory was first suggested by the scholars [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] and [[Joseph Vendryes]], who proposed that the ogham script was inspired by a pre-existing system of counting based around the numbers five and twenty, which was then adapted to an alphabet form by the first ogamists.<ref>Vendryès 'L'écriture ogamique et ses origines' Études Celtiques, 4, pp. 110–113, 1941; Thurneysen, 'Zum ogam' Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur, pp. 196–197, 1937. Cf. McManus 1988, p. 11, 1991.</ref>\n\n===Legendary accounts===\nAccording to the 11th-century ''[[Lebor Gabála Érenn]]'', the 14th-century ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'', and other Medieval [[Irish folklore]], ogham was first invented soon after the fall of the [[Tower of Babel]], along with the [[Gaelic language]], by the legendary [[Scythian]] king, [[Fenius Farsa]]. According to the Auraicept, Fenius journeyed from [[Scythia]] together with Goídel mac Ethéoir, Íar mac Nema and a [[retinue]] of 72 scholars. They came to the plain of [[Shinar]] to study the [[confusion of tongues|confused languages]] at [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]]'s tower (the [[Tower of Babel]]). Finding that they had already been dispersed, Fenius sent his scholars to study them, staying at the tower, co-ordinating the effort. After ten years, the investigations were complete, and Fenius created  ''in Bérla tóbaide'' \"the selected language\", taking the best of each of the confused tongues, which he called ''Goídelc'', [[Goidelic]], after Goídel mac Ethéoir. He also created extensions of ''Goídelc'', called ''Bérla Féne'', after himself, ''Íarmberla'', after Íar mac Nema, and others, and the ''Beithe-luis-nuin'' (the ogham) as a perfected [[writing system]] for his languages. The names he gave to the letters were those of his 25 best scholars.\n\nAlternatively, the [[In Lebor Ogaim|Ogam Tract]] credits [[Ogma|Ogma mac Elathan]] ([[Ogmios]]) with the script's invention. Ogma was skilled in speech and poetry, and created the system for the learned, to the exclusion of rustics and fools. The first message written in ogam were seven ''b'''s on a birch, sent as a warning to [[Lugh|Lug mac Elathan]], meaning: \"your wife will be carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch protects her\". For this reason, the letter ''b'' is said to be named after the birch, and ''In Lebor Ogaim'' goes on to tell the tradition that all letters were named after trees, a claim also referred to by the Auraicept as an alternative to the naming after Fenius' disciples.\n\n==Alphabet: the Beith-Luis-Nin==\nStrictly speaking, the word ''ogham'' refers only to the form of letters or script, while the letters themselves are known collectively as the ''Beith-luis-nin'' after the letter names of the first letters (in the same manner as the modern \"Alphabet\" deriving from the Greek Alpha and Beta). The fact that the order of the letters is in fact BLFSN led the scholar Macalister to propose that the letter order was originally BLNFS. This was to fit into his own theories which linked the ''Beith-luis-nin'' to a form of the Greek alphabet current in Northern Italy in the 6th and 5th centuries BC. However, there is no evidence for Macalister's theories, and they have since been discounted by later scholars. There are in fact other explanations for the name ''Beith-luis-nin''. One explanation is that the word ''nin'' which literally means 'a forked branch' was also regularly used to mean a written letter in general. ''Beith-luis-nin'' could therefore mean simply 'Beith-luis letters'. The other explanation is that ''Beith-luis-nin'' is a convenient contraction of the first five letters thus: ''Beith-LVS-nin''.<ref>McManus 1988, pp. 36, 167, 1991; B. Ó Cuív, \"Irish words for Alphabet\", Eriu 31, p. 101. There is also the fact that it would be impossible to change the order of letters in ogham, given that it is a numbered series of strokes. In other words, to change N from the third to the fifth letter would also mean changing its symbol from three strokes to five strokes. The letters F and S would also have to be changed. This would obviously lead to great confusion, and would only be done if there was some compelling reason for the change. Macalister provides no such reason.</ref>\n\nThe ogham alphabet originally consisted of twenty distinct characters (''feda''), arranged in four series ''aicmí'' (plural of ''aicme'' \"family\"; compare ''[[aett]]''). Each aicme was named after its first character (''Aicme Beithe'', ''Aicme hÚatha'', ''Aicme Muine'', ''Aicme Ailme'', \"the B Group\", \"the H Group\", \"the M Group\", \"the A Group\"). Five additional letters were later introduced (mainly in the manuscript tradition), the so-called ''[[forfeda]]''.\n\n[[File:Ogham airenach.png|thumb|The ''ogam airenach'', closeup from the page shown above]]\nThe ''[[Ogam Tract]]'' also gives a variety of some 100 variant or secret modes of writing ogham (92 in the [[Book of Ballymote]]), for example the \"shield ogham\" (''ogam airenach'', nr. 73). Even the [[Younger Futhark]] are introduced as a kind of \"Viking ogham\" (nrs. 91, 92).\n\nThe four primary  ''aicmí'' are, with their transcriptions in manuscript tradition and their names according to manuscript tradition in normalised Old Irish, followed by their Primitive Irish sound values, and their presumed original name in Primitive Irish in cases where the name's etymology is known:\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer    =  The twenty standard letters of the Ogham alphabet and the five [[forfeda]].

Conversely, there is a letter for the [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] ''q'' (ᚊ ''ceirt''), a phoneme lost in Old Irish. The base alphabet is therefore, as it were, designed for Proto-Q-Celtic.\n\nOf the five ''[[forfeda]]'' or supplementary letters, only the first,  ''ébad'', regularly appears in inscriptions, but mostly with the value K (McManus, § 5.3, 1991). The others, except for ''emancholl'', have at most only one certain 'orthodox' (see below) inscription each.<ref>See inscription 235 for ''óir'', 240 for ''uillen'', and 327 and 231 for ''pín'' in Macalister CIIC, Vol I</ref> Due to their limited practical use, later ogamists turned the supplementary letters into a series of diphthongs, changing completely the values for ''pín'' and ''emancholl''.<ref>MacManus 1988, §7.13–14, 1991</ref> This meant that the alphabet was once again without a letter for the P sound, forcing the invention of the letter ''peithboc'' (soft 'B'), which appears in the manuscripts only.\n\n*EA ''ébad''\n*OI  ''óir''\n*UI ''uillenn''\n*P, later IO ''pín'' (later ''iphín'')\n*X or Ch (as in ''loch''), later AE ''emancholl''\n\n===Letter names===\n{{Main|Bríatharogam}}\nThe letter names are interpreted as names of trees or shrubs in manuscript tradition, both in ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' ('The Scholars' Primer') and ''[[In Lebor Ogaim]]'' ('The Ogam Tract'). They were first discussed in modern times by [[Ruaidhrí Ó Flaithbheartaigh]] (1685), who took them at face value. The Auraicept itself is aware that not all names are known tree names, saying \"Now all these are wood names such as are found in the ''Ogham Book of Woods,'' and are not derived from men\", admitting that \"some of these trees are not known today\". The Auraicept gives a short phrase or [[kenning]] for each letter, known as a ''Bríatharogam'', that traditionally accompanied each letter name, and a further gloss explaining their meanings and identifying the tree or plant linked to each letter. Only five of the twenty primary letters have tree names that the Auraicept considers comprehensible without further glosses, namely ''beith'' \"birch\", ''fearn'' \"alder\", ''saille'' \"willow\", ''duir'' \"oak\" and ''coll'' \"hazel\". All the other names have to be glossed or \"translated\".\n\nAccording to the leading modern ogham scholar, Damian McManus, the \"Tree Alphabet\" idea dates to the [[Old Irish]] period (say, 10th century), but it post-dates the Primitive Irish period, or at least the time when the letters were originally named. Its origin is probably due to the letters themselves being called ''feda'' \"trees\", or ''nin'' \"forking branches\" due to their shape. Since a few of the letters were, in fact, named after trees, the interpretation arose that they were called ''feda'' because of that. Some of the other letter names had fallen out of use as independent words, and were thus free to be claimed as \"Old Gaelic\" tree names, while others (such as ''ruis'', ''úath'' or ''gort'') were more or less forcefully re-interpreted as epithets of trees by the medieval glossators.\n\nMcManus (1991, §3.15) discusses possible etymologies of all the letter names, and as well as the five mentioned above, he adds one other definite tree name: ''onn'' \"ash\" (the Auraicept wrongly has furze). McManus (1988, p.&nbsp;164) also believes that the name ''Idad'' is probably an artificial form of ''Iubhar'' or yew, as the kennings support that meaning, and concedes that ''Ailm'' may possibly mean \"pine tree\" as it appears to be used to mean that in an 8th-century poem.<ref>The rationale for the artificial form '''Idad''' would be to make a pairing with '''Edad'''. With regard to '''Ailm''', in the ''King and Hermit'' poem the hermit Marban says ''caine ailmi ardom-peitet'' – 'beautiful are the pines that make music for me' This is a reference to the idea that pine makes a pleasing, soothing sound as the wind passes through its needles.</ref> Thus out of twenty letter names, only eight at most are the names of trees. The other names have a variety of meanings, which are set out in the list below.\n\n{{Table Oghamletters}}\n*'''Beith''', Old Irish '''Beithe''' means \"[[birch]]-tree\", cognate to Middle Welsh ''bedw''. Latin ''betula'' is considered a borrowing from the Gaulish cognate.\n*'''Luis''', Old Irish '''Luis''' is either related to ''luise'' \"blaze\" or ''lus'' \"herb\". The arboreal tradition has ''caertheand'' \"[[rowan]]\".\n*'''Fearn''', Old Irish '''Fern''' means \"[[alder]]-tree\", Primitive Irish ''*wernā'', so that the original value of the letter was {{IPA|[w]}}.\n*'''Sail''', Old Irish '''Sail''' means \"[[willow]]-tree\", cognate to Latin ''salix''.\n*'''Nion''', Old Irish '''Nin''' means either \"fork\" or \"loft\". The arboreal tradition has ''uinnius'' \"[[European Ash|ash-tree]]\".\n*'''Uath''', Old Irish '''Úath''' means  ''úath'' \"horror, fear\", the arboreal tradition has \"[[Common Hawthorn|white-thorn]]\". The original etymology of the name, and the letter's value, are however unclear. McManus (1986) suggested a value {{IPA|[y]}}. Peter Schrijver (see McManus 1991:37) suggested that if ''úath'' \"fear\" is cognate with Latin ''pavere'', a trace of PIE ''*p'' might have survived into Primitive Irish, but there is no independent evidence for this.\n*'''Dair''', Old Irish '''Dair''' means \"[[oak]]\" (PIE ''*doru-'').\n*'''Tinne''', Old Irish '''Tinne''' from the evidence of the [[kenning]]s means \"bar of metal, [[ingot]]\". The arboreal tradition has ''cuileand'' \"[[holly]]\".\n*'''Coll''', Old Irish '''Coll''' meant \"[[hazel]]-tree\", cognate with Welsh ''collen'', correctly glossed as ''cainfidh'' \"fair-wood\" (\"hazel\") by the arboreal interpretation. Latin ''corulus'' or ''corylus'' is cognate.\n*'''Ceirt''', Old Irish '''Cert''' is cognate with Welsh ''perth'' \"bush\", Latin ''quercus'' \"oak\" (PIE ''*perkwos''). It was confused with Old Irish ''ceirt'' \"rag\", reflected in the kennings. The Auraicept glosses  ''aball'' \"apple\".\n*'''Muin''', Old Irish '''Muin''': the kennings connect this name to three different words, ''muin'' \"neck, upper part of the back\", ''muin'' \"wile, ruse\", and ''muin'' \"love, esteem\". The arboreal tradition has  ''finemhain'' \"[[vine]]\".\n*'''Gort''', Old Irish '''Gort''' means \"field\" (cognate to ''garden''). The arboreal tradition has ''edind'' \"[[ivy]]\".\n*'''nGéadal''', Old Irish '''Gétal''' from the kennings has a meaning of \"killing\", maybe cognate to ''gonid'' \"slays\", from PIE ''{{PIE|gwen-}}''. The value of the letter in Primitive Irish, then, was a voiced labiovelar, {{IPA|[ɡʷ]}}. The arboreal tradition glosses ''cilcach'', \"[[broom (plant)|broom]]\" or \"[[fern]]\".\n*'''Straif''', Old Irish '''Straiph''' means \"sulphur\". The Primitive Irish letter value is uncertain, it may have been a sibilant different from ''s'', which is taken by ''sail'', maybe a reflex of {{IPA|/st/}} or {{IPA|/sw/}}. The arboreal tradition glosses  ''draighin'' \"[[blackthorn]]\".\n*'''Ruis''', Old Irish '''Ruis''' means \"red\" or \"redness\", glossed as ''trom'' \"[[elderberry|elder]]\".\n*'''Ailm''', Old Irish '''Ailm''' is of uncertain meaning, possibly \"pine-tree\". The Auraicept has ''crand giuis .i. ochtach'', \"[[fir]]-tree\" or \"[[pine]]tree\".\n*'''Onn''', Old Irish '''Onn''' means \"[[ash-tree]]\", although the Auraicept glosses ''aiten''  \"[[furze]]\".\n*'''Úr''', Old Irish '''Úr''', based on the kennings, means \"earth, clay, soil\". The Auraicept glosses ''fraech'' \"[[Erica|heath]]\".\n*'''Eadhadh''', Old Irish '''Edad''' of unknown meaning. The Auraicept glosses  ''crand fir no crithach'' \"test-tree or [[aspen]]\"\n*'''Iodhadh''', Old Irish '''Idad''' is of uncertain meaning, but is probably a form of ''ibhar'' \"[[Taxus baccata|yew]]\", which is the meaning given to it in the arboreal tradition.\n\nOf the ''[[forfeda]]'', four are glossed by the Auraicept:\n*'''Eabhadh''', Old Irish '''Ebhadh''' with ''crithach'' \"aspen\";\n*'''Ór''', \"gold\" (from Latin aurum); the arboreal tradition has ''feorus no edind'', \"spindle tree or ivy\"\n*'''Uilleann''', Old Irish '''Uilleand''' \"elbow\"; the arboreal tradition has ''edleand'' \"[[honeysuckle]]\"\n*'''Pín''', later '''Ifín''', Old Irish '''Iphin''' with  ''spinan no ispin'' \"[[gooseberry]] or thorn\".\n\nThe fifth letter is '''Emancholl''' which means 'twin of hazel'\n\n==Corpus==\n{{Main|Ogham inscriptions}}\n[[File:CIIC 504.gif|thumb|upright|Ogham stone from the Isle of Man showing the ''droim'' in centre. Text reads BIVAIDONAS MAQI MUCOI CUNAVA[LI],\nor in English,  \"Of Bivaidonas, son of the tribe Cunava[li]\".]]\nMonumental ogham inscriptions are found in Ireland and [[Wales]], with a few additional specimens found in southwest England ([[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]]), the [[Isle of Man]], and [[Scotland]], including [[Shetland]] and [[Silchester Ogham stone|a single example]] from [[Silchester]] in England. They were mainly employed as territorial markers and memorials (grave stones). The stone commemorating [[Vortiporius]], a 6th-century king of [[Dyfed]] (originally located in [[Clynderwen]]), is the only ogham stone inscription that bears the name of an identifiable individual.<ref>The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008</ref> The language of the inscriptions is predominantly [[Primitive Irish]]; the few inscriptions in Scotland, such as the [[Lunnasting stone]], record fragments of what is probably the [[Pictish language]].\n\nThe more ancient examples are [[standing stone]]s, where the script was carved into the edge (''droim'' or ''faobhar'') of the stone, which formed the stemline against which individual characters are cut. The text of these \"Orthodox Ogham\" inscriptions is read beginning from the bottom left-hand side of a stone, continuing upward along the edge, across the top and down the right-hand side (in the case of long inscriptions). Roughly 380 inscriptions are known in total (a number, incidentally, very close to the number of known inscriptions in the contemporary [[Elder Futhark]]), of which the highest concentration by far is found in the southwestern Irish province of [[Munster]]. Over one third of the total are found in [[County Kerry]] alone, most densely in the former kingdom of the [[Corcu Duibne]].\n\nLater inscriptions are known as \"[[scholastic Ogham|scholastic]]\", and are post 6th century in date. The term 'scholastic' derives from the fact that the inscriptions are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript sources, instead of being continuations of the original monument tradition. Unlike orthodox ogham, some medieval inscriptions feature all five [[Forfeda]]. Scholastic inscriptions are written on stemlines cut into the face of the stone, instead of along its edge. Ogham was also occasionally used for notes in manuscripts down to the 16th century. A modern ogham inscription is found on a gravestone dating to 1802 in Ahenny, [[County Tipperary]].\n\nIn Scotland, a number of inscriptions using the ogham writing system are known, but their language is still the subject of debate.\nIt has been argued by Richard Cox in ''The Language of Ogham Inscriptions in Scotland'' (1999) that the language of these is Old Norse, but others remain unconvinced by this analysis, and regard the stones as being [[Pict]]ish in origin. However, due to the lack of knowledge about the Picts, the inscriptions remain undeciphered, their language possibly being non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]. The Pictish inscriptions are scholastic, and are believed to have been inspired by the manuscript tradition brought into Scotland by [[Dál Riata|Gaelic settlers]].\n\nA rare example of a Christianised Ogham stone can be seen in [[St. Mary's Collegiate Church Gowran]], [[County Kilkenny]].<ref>A History of St. Mary’s Church. Text by Imelda Kehoe. Published by the Gowran Development Association 1992</ref>\n\n==Non-monumental uses==\n{{Main|Scholastic ogham}}\nAs well as its use for monumental inscriptions, the evidence from early Irish sagas and legends indicates that ogham was used for short messages on wood or metal, either to relay messages or to denote ownership of the object inscribed. Some of these messages seem to have been cryptic in nature and some were also for magical purposes. In addition, there is evidence from sources such as ''[[In Lebor Ogaim]]'', or the ''Ogham Tract'', that ogham may have been used to keep records or lists, such as genealogies and numerical tallies of property and business transactions. There is also evidence that ogham may have been used as a system of finger or hand signals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lewis-Highcorrell |first1=Don |title=Witch School Second Degree: Lessons in the Correllian Traditio |date=2003 |publisher=Llewellyn |location=Woodbury, MN |page=135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2u22BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=ogham+may+have+been+used+as+a+system+of+finger+or+hand+signals&source=bl&ots=tOSwdITqnG&sig=gHlVe1F5llwbXP6gInqquFtL684&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj78Ym02vLfAhUFQKwKHWe3AEUQ6AEwDXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&q=ogham%20may%20have%20been%20used%20as%20a%20system%20of%20finger%20or%20hand%20signals&f=false |accessdate=16 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn later centuries when ogham ceased to be used as a practical alphabet, it retained its place in the learning of Gaelic scholars and poets as the basis of grammar and the rules of poetry. Indeed, until modern times the Latin alphabet in Gaelic continued to be taught using letter names borrowed from the ''Beith-Luis-Nin'', along with the Medieval association of each letter with a different tree.\n\n==Unicode==\n\n{{Main|Ogham (Unicode block)}}\n\nOgham was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe spelling of the names given is a standardisation dating to 1997, used in Unicode Standard and in Irish Standard 434:1999.\n\nThe Unicode block for ogham is U+1680–U+169F.\n\n{{Unicode chart Ogham}}\n\n==Neopaganism==\nModern [[New Age]] and [[Neopagan]] approaches to ogham largely derive from the now-discredited theories of [[Robert Graves]] in his book ''[[The White Goddess]]''.<ref>Carr-Gomm, Philip & Richard Heygate, ''The Book of English Magic'', The Overlook Press, Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc., 2010</ref> In this work, Graves took his inspiration from the theories of the ogham scholar R. A. S. Macalister (see above) and elaborated on them much further. Graves proposed that the ogham alphabet encoded a set of beliefs originating in the Middle East in [[Stone Age]] times, concerning the ceremonies surrounding the worship of the Moon goddess in her various forms. Graves' argument is extremely complex, but in essence he argues that the Hebrews, Greeks and Celts were all influenced by a people originating in the Aegean, called '[[sea people|the people of the sea]]' by the Egyptians, who spread out around Europe in the 2nd millennium BC, taking their religious beliefs with them.<ref>Graves, R 'The White Goddess', pp. 61, 123, Faber & Faber, London, 1961</ref> At some early stage these teachings were encoded in alphabet form by poets to pass on their worship of the goddess (as the muse and inspiration of all poets) in a secret fashion, understandable only to initiates. Eventually, via the druids of Gaul, this knowledge was passed on to the poets of early Ireland and Wales. Graves therefore looked at the Tree Alphabet tradition surrounding ogham and explored the tree folklore of each of the letter names, proposing that the order of the letters formed an ancient \"seasonal calendar of tree magic\".<ref>Graves 1961, p. 165</ref> Although his theories have been disregarded by modern scholars (including Macalister himself, with whom Graves corresponded),<ref>Graves 1961, pp. 116–117</ref> they have been taken up with enthusiasm by the neopagan movement. In addition, Graves followed the BLNFS order of ogham letters put forward by Macalister (see above), with the result that this has been taken up by New Age and Neopagan writers as the 'correct' order of the letters, despite its rejection by scholars.\n\nThe main use of ogham by [[Neo-druidism|modern Druids]], [[Neopaganism|Neo-Pagans]] is for the purpose of divination. Divination by using ogham symbols is mentioned in ''[[Tochmarc Étaíne]]'', a tale in the Irish [[Mythological Cycle]]. In the story, [[druid]] Dalan takes four wands of yew, and writes ogham letters upon them. Then he uses the tools for [[divination]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=PagEd&file=index&topic_id=1&page_id=74 |title=What Is an Ovate? |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=The Order of Bards Ovates & Druids }}</ref> The tale doesn't explain further how the sticks are handled or interpreted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somersetpagan.org/Ogham.html |title=Ogham |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=Somerset Pagans }}</ref> Another method requires a cloth marked out with [[Auraicept na n-Éces|Finn's Window]].<ref name=\"shallcrass\">{{cite web|url=http://www.druidorder.demon.co.uk/ogham.htm  |title=A Little History of Ogham |accessdate=28 April 2010 |author=Philip Shallcrass |publisher=The British Druid Order |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050404123651/http://www.druidorder.demon.co.uk/ogham.htm |archivedate = 4 April 2005}}</ref> A person selects some sticks randomly, throws them on the cloth, and then looks both at the symbols and where they fell.<ref name=\"odubhain\">{{cite web|url=http://www.summerlands.com/crossroads/library/oghamdiv.htm |title=Druids, Ogham and Divination |accessdate=19 January 2007 |author=Searles O'Dubhain }}</ref>\n\nThe divinatory meanings are usually based on the tree ogham, rather than the kennings of the ''[[Bríatharogam]]''.<ref name=\"centerofthegrove\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centerofthegrove1.com/ |title=Center of the Grove |accessdate=19 January 2007 }}</ref> Each letter is associated with a tree or other plant, and meanings are derived from them.

Text reads BIVAIDONAS MAQI MUCOI CUNAVA[LI], or in English of Bivaidonas, son of the tribe Cunava[li] ]]\n\nRoughly 400 known '''[[ogham]] inscriptions''' are on stone monuments scattered around the [[Irish Sea]], the bulk of them dating to the fifth and sixth centuries. Their language is predominantly [[Primitive Irish]], but a few examples record fragments of the [[Pictish language]]. Ogham itself is an Early Medieval form of alphabet or cipher, sometimes known as the \"Celtic Tree Alphabet\".\n\nA number of different numbering schemes are used. The most widespread is '''CIIC''', after [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|R. A. S. Macalister]]. This covers the inscriptions known by the 1940s. Another numbering scheme is that of the Celtic Inscribed Stones Project, '''CISP''', based on the location of the stones; for example CIIC 1 = CISP INCHA/1. Macalister's (1945) numbers run from 1 to 507, including also Latin and Runic inscriptions, with three additional added in 1949. Ziegler lists 344 Gaelic ogham inscriptions known to Macalister (Ireland and Isle of Man), and seven additional inscriptions discovered later.\n\nThe inscriptions may be divided into \"orthodox\" and \"scholastic\" specimens. \"Orthodox\" inscriptions date to the Primitive Irish period, and record a name of an individual, either as a cenotaph or tombstone, or documenting land ownership. \"Scholastic\" inscriptions date from the medieval [[Old Irish]] period up to modern times.\n\nThe vast bulk of the surviving ogham inscriptions stretch in arc from [[County Kerry]] (especially [[Corcu Duibne]]) in the south of Ireland across to [[Dyfed]] in south Wales. The remainder are mostly in south-eastern Ireland, eastern and northern Scotland, the [[Isle of Man]], and England around the [[Devon]]/[[Cornwall]] border. The vast majority of the inscriptions consists of personal names, probably of the person commemorated by the monument.\n\n==Orthodox inscriptions==\n{{Table Oghamletters}}\nIn orthodox inscriptions, the script was carved into the edge (''droim'' or ''faobhar'') of the stone, which formed the stemline against which individual characters are cut. The text of these \"Orthodox Ogham\" inscriptions is read beginning from the bottom left side of a stone, continuing upward along the edge, across the top and down the right side (in the case of long inscriptions).\n\nMacManus (1991) lists a total of 382 known Orthodox inscriptions. They are found in most counties of Ireland, concentrated in southern Ireland: [[County Kerry]] (130), [[County Cork|Cork]] (84), [[County Waterford|Waterford]] (48), [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]] (14), [[County Mayo|Mayo]] (9), [[County Kildare|Kildare]] (8), [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] and [[County Meath|Meath]] (5 each), [[County Carlow|Carlow]] (4), [[County Wexford|Wexford]], [[County Limerick|Limerick]], [[County Roscommon|Roscommon]] (3 each), [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] (2 each), [[County Armagh|Armagh]], [[County Dublin|Dublin]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Leitrim|Leitrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] (1 each). Other specimens are known from [[Wales]] (ca. 40: [[Pembrokeshire]] (16), [[Breconshire]] and [[Carmarthenshire]] (7 each), [[Glamorgan]] (4), [[Ceredigion|Cardiganshire]] (3), [[Denbighshire]] (2), [[Powys]] (1), and [[Caernarvonshire]] (1)), from England ([[Cornwall]] (5) [[Devon]] (2), elsewhere (1?)); the [[Isle of Man]] (5), and with some doubtful examples from Scotland (2?)\n\n===Formula words===\nThe vast majority of inscriptions consists of personal names and they use a series of formula words, usually describing the person's ancestry or tribal affiliation. The formula words used are MAQI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚔ}} – 'son' (Modern Irish ''mic''); MUCOI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚒᚉᚑᚔ}} – 'tribe' or 'sept'; ANM {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚅᚋ}} – 'name' (Modern Irish ''ainm''); AVI {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚃᚔ}} – 'descendant' (Modern Irish ''uí''); CELI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚓᚂᚔ}} – 'follower' or 'devotee' (Modern Irish ''céile''); NETA {{script|Ogam|ᚅᚓᚈᚐ}} – 'nephew' (Modern Irish ''nia''); KOI {{script|Ogam|ᚕᚑᚔ}} – 'here is' (equivalent to Latin HIC IACIT). KOI is unusual in that the K is always written using the first supplementary letter ''Ebad''. In order of frequency the formula words are used as follows:\n\n* X MAQI Y               (X son of Y)\n* X MAQI MUCOI Y         (X son of the tribe Y)\n* X MAQI Y MUCOI Z       (X son of Y of the tribe Z)\n* X KOI MAQI MUCOI Y     (here is X son of the tribe Y)\n* X MUCOI Y               (X of the tribe Y)\n* X MAQI Y MAQI MUCOI Z (X son of Y son of the tribe Z)\n* Single name inscriptions with no accompanying formula word\n* ANM X MAQI Y           (Name X son of Y)\n* ANM X                   (Name X )\n* X AVI Y                 (X descendant of Y)\n* X MAQI Y AVI Z         (X son of Y descendant of Z)\n* X CELI Y                (X follower/devotee of Y)\n* NETTA X                 (nephew/champion of X)\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe nomenclature of the Irish personal names is more interesting than the rather repetitive formulae and reveals details of early Gaelic society, particularly its warlike nature. For example, two of the most commonly occurring elements in the names are CUNA {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐ}} – 'hound' or 'wolf' (Modern Irish ''cú'') and CATTU {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚈᚒ}} – 'battle' (Modern Irish ''cath''). These occur in names such as (300) CUNANETAS {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐᚅᚓᚈᚐᚄ}} – 'Champion of wolves'; (501) CUNAMAGLI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚐᚋᚐᚌᚂᚔ}} – 'prince of wolves'; (107) CUNAGUSSOS – '(he who is) strong as a wolf'; (250) CATTUVVIRR {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚈᚒᚃᚃᚔᚏᚏ}} – 'man of battle'; (303) CATABAR {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚈᚐᚁᚐᚏ}} – 'chief in battle'; IVACATTOS {{script|Ogam|ᚔᚃᚐᚉᚐᚈᚈᚑᚄ}} – 'yew of battle'. Other warlike names include (39) BRANOGENI {{script|Ogam|ᚁᚏᚐᚅᚑᚌᚓᚅᚔ}} – 'born of raven'; (428) TRENAGUSU {{script|Ogam|ᚈᚏᚓᚅᚐᚌᚒᚄᚒ}} – 'strong of vigour'; and (504) BIVAIDONAS {{script|Ogam|ᚁᚔᚃᚐᚔᚇᚑᚅᚐᚄ}} – 'alive like fire'. Elements that are descriptive of physical characteristics are also common, such as (368) VENDUBARI {{script|Ogam|ᚃᚓᚅᚇᚒᚁᚐᚏᚔ}} – 'fair-headed'; (75) CASONI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚐᚄᚑᚅᚔ}} – 'curly headed one'; (119) DALAGNI {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚐᚂᚐᚌᚅᚔ}} – 'one who is blind'; (46) DERCMASOC {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚓᚏᚉᚋᚐᚄᚑᚉ}} – 'one with an elegant eye'; (60) MAILAGNI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚔᚂᚐᚌᚅᚔ}} – 'bald/short haired one' and (239) GATTAGLAN {{script|Ogam|ᚌᚐᚈᚈᚐᚌᚂᚐᚅ}} – 'wise and pure'.\n\nOther names indicate a divine ancestor. The god [[Lugh]] features in many names such as (4) LUGADDON {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚌᚐᚇᚑᚅ}}, (286) LUGUDECA {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚒᚇᚓᚉᚐ}} and (140) LUGAVVECCA {{script|Ogam|ᚂᚒᚌᚐᚃᚃᚓᚉᚉᚐ}}, while the divine name ERC (meaning either 'heaven or 'cow') appears in names such as (93) ERCAIDANA {{script|Ogam|ᚓᚏᚉᚐᚔᚇᚐᚅᚐ}} and (196) ERCAVICCAS {{script|Ogam|ᚓᚏᚉᚐᚃᚔᚉᚉᚐᚄ}} . Other names indicate sept or tribal name, such as (156) DOVVINIAS {{script|Ogam|ᚇᚑᚃᚃᚔᚅᚔᚐᚄ}} from the ''Corcu Duibne'' sept of the Dingle and Iveragh peninsulas in Co. Kerry (named after a local goddess); (215) ALLATO {{script|Ogam|ᚐᚂᚂᚐᚈᚑ}} from the ''Altraige'' of North Kerry and (106) CORIBIRI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚑᚏᚔᚁᚔᚏᚔ}} from the ''Dál Coirpri'' of Co. Cork. Finally of particular interest is the fact that quite a few names denote a relationship to trees, names like (230) MAQI-CARATTINN {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚉᚐᚏᚐᚈᚈᚔᚅᚅ}} – 'son of rowan'; (v) MAQVI QOLI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚊᚃᚔ ᚊᚑᚂᚔ}} – 'son of hazel' and (259) IVOGENI {{script|Ogam|ᚔᚃᚑᚌᚓᚅᚔ}} – 'born of yew'.\n\nThe content of the inscriptions has led scholars such as McNeill and Macalister to argue that they are explicitly pagan in nature. They argue that the inscriptions were later defaced by Christian converts, who deliberately attacked them by removing the word MUCOI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚒᚉᚑᚔ}} on account of its supposedly tribal, pagan associations, and adding crosses next to them to Christianize them. Other scholars, such as McManus argue that there is no evidence for this, citing inscriptions such as (145) QRIMITIR RONANN MAQ COMOGANN {{script|Ogam|᚛ᚊᚏᚔᚋᚔᚈᚔᚏ ᚏᚑᚅᚐᚅᚅ ᚋᚐᚊ ᚉᚑᚋᚑᚌᚐᚅᚅ᚜}}, where QRIMITIR is a loan word from Latin ''presbyter'' or 'priest'. McManus argues that the supposed vandalism of the inscriptions is simply wear and tear, and due to the inscription stones being reused as building material for walls, lintels, etc. (McManus, §4.9). McManus also argues that the MUCOI formula word survived into Christian manuscript usage. There is also the fact the inscriptions were made at a time when Christianity had become firmly established in Ireland. Whether those who wrote the inscriptions were pagans, Christians, or a mixture of both remains unclear.\n\n===Ireland===\nIreland has the vast majority of inscriptions, with 330 out of 382. One of the most important collections of orthodox ogham inscriptions in Ireland can be seen in [[University College Cork]] (UCC) on public display in 'The Stone Corridor'. The inscriptions were \ncollected by antiquarian [[Abraham Abell]] 1783–1851 and were deposited in the Cork Institution before being put on display in UCC. He was a member of the [[Cuvierian Society]] of Cork whose members, including [[John Windele]], Fr. Matt Horgan and R.R. Brash, did extensive work in this area in the mid-19th century.

Examples of Brythonic names include (446) MAGLOCUNI {{script|Ogam|ᚋᚐᚌᚂᚑᚉᚒᚅᚔ}} (Welsh ''Maelgwn'') and (449) CUNOTAMI {{script|Ogam|ᚉᚒᚅᚑᚈᚐᚋᚔ}} (Welsh ''cyndaf'').

The stone commemorates [[Vortiporius]], a 6th-century king of [[Dyfed]] (originally located in [[Clynderwen]]).<ref>{{cite book |last=Davies |first=John |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales |publisher=[[University of Wales Press]] |location=Cardiff |year=2008 |isbn=0-7083-1953-X}}</ref> Wales also has the only ogham inscription known to commemorate a woman.

Scholastic inscriptions typically draw a line into the stone's surface along which the letters are arranged, rather than using the stone's edge.

From the High Middle Ages, contemporary to the Manuscript tradition, they may contain [[Forfeda]]. The 30 or so Pictish inscriptions qualify as early Scholastic, roughly 6th to 9th century.

However, Santali is not an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language and Indic scripts did not have letters for all of Santali's [[phonemes]], especially its [[stop consonant]]s and [[vowels]], which made writing the language accurately in an unmodified Indic script difficult. The detailed analysis was given by [[Byomkes Chakrabarti]] in his \"Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali\".

Unlike most Indic scripts, Ol Chiki is not an [[abugida]], with [[vowels]] given equal representation with [[consonants]]. Additionally, it was designed specifically for the language, but one letter could not be assigned to each phoneme because the sixth vowel in Ol Chiki is still problematic.\n\n==Letters==\nThe values of the letters are as follows: \n\n<!--  style=\"text-align: center;\" -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Letter !! rowspan=2 | Name !! rowspan=2 | [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]<ref name=\"WWS\"/> !! colspan=5 | Transliteration !! rowspan=2 | Shape<ref name=\"portal\">{{cite web | title = Ol Chiki Script | work = A portal for Santals | date = 2002 | url = http://wesanthals.tripod.com/id45.html | accessdate = 2017-09-12}}</ref> \n|-\n!

      "text": "The '''Old Italic scripts''' are a set of similar ancient [[writing systems]] used in the [[Italy|Italian Peninsula]] between about 700 and 100 BC, for various languages spoken in that time and place.  The most notable member is the [[Etruscan alphabet]], which was the immediate ancestor of the [[Latin alphabet]] currently used by [[English language|English]] and many other languages of the world.  The [[runic alphabet]] used in northern [[Europe]] is believed to have been derived from one of these alphabets by the 2nd century AD.\n\nThe Old Italic alphabets clearly derive from the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] one, apparently through the [[Cumaean alphabet]] used in the [[Euboean Greek]] colonies of  [[Ischia]] and [[Cumae]] in the [[Bay of Naples]] in the eighth century BC.  The Etruscans were the leading civilization of Italy in that period, and it is assumed that the other Old Italic scripts were derived from it -- although some of them, including the Latin one, retained certain Greek letters that the Etruscans themselves dropped at a rather early date.  \n\nThe Old Italic alphabets were used for various different languages, which included some [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ones (predominantly from the [[Italic languages|Italic]] branch, but also [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] or [[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) and some non-Indo-European ones (such as [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] itself).\n\n==Alphabets related to Etruscan==\n\nThe following table shows the ancient Italic scripts that are presumed to be related to the Etruscan alphabet. Symbols that are assumed to be correspondent are placed on the same column.  Many symbols occur with two or more variant forms in the same script; only one variant is shown here. The notations '''[←]''' and '''[→]''' indicate that the shapes shown were used when writing right-to-left and left-to-right, respectively.  For more information, such as variant shapes and the prevalent writing direction of each script, see the corresponding language article.\n\n'''Warning: For the languages marked [?] and any cells with a <span style=\"background-color:#FF7744;\">red</span> background, the appearance of the \"Letters\" in the table is whatever one's browser's [[Unicode]] font shows for the corresponding code points in the [[Old Italic (Unicode block)|Old Italic Unicode block]].  The same code point represents different symbol shapes in different languages; therefore, to display those glyph images properly one needs to use a Unicode font specific to that language.'''\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|colspan=31 style=\"background-color:#FAFAFA;text-align:center;\"|'''[[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]'''\n|-\n!Letter [←]\n|[[File:Phoenician aleph.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician beth.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician gimel.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician daleth.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician he.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician waw.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician zayin.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician heth.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician teth.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician yodh.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician kaph.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician lamedh.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician mem.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician nun.svg|x12px]]\n|\n|[[File:Phoenician ayin.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician pe.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician sade.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician qoph.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician res.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician sin.svg|x12px]]\n|[[File:Phoenician taw.svg|x12px]]\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Value \n|-\n!Transcription\n|-\n| colspan=31 style=\"background-color:#FAFAFA;text-align:center;\"|'''[[Western Greek alphabet|Western Greek]]'''\n|-\n!Letter [→]\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Alpha 03}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Beta 16}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Gamma archaic 1}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Delta 04}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Epsilon archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Digamma oblique}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Zeta archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Eta archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Theta archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Iota normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Kappa normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Lambda 09}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Mu 04}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Nu 01}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Xi archaic grid}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Omicron 04}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Pi archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|San 02}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Koppa normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Rho pointed}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Sigma normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Tau normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#E0FFE0;\"|{{GrGl|Upsilon normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#EE80FF;\"|{{GrGl|Chi normal}}\n| style=\"background-color:#EE80FF;\"|{{GrGl|Phi archaic}}\n| style=\"background-color:#EE80FF;\"|{{GrGl|Psi straight}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n!Value\n|a||b||g||d||e||w||zd||h||tʰ||i||k||l||m||n||ks||o||p||s||k||r||s||t||u||ks||pʰ||kʰ|| || ||\n|-\n!Transcription\n|Α||Β||Γ||Δ||Ε||Ϝ||Ζ||Η||Θ||Ι||Κ||Λ||Μ||Ν||Ξ||Ο||Π|| ||||Ρ||Σ||Τ||Υ||Χ||Φ||Ψ|| || || ||\n|-\n| colspan=31 style=\"background-color:#FAFAFA;text-align:center;\"|'''[[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]]''' -

For this reason, the glyphs in the code chart are shown with left-to-right orientation.\n\n{{Unicode chart Old Italic}}\n<!--\n===Letters with transliteration===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!Letter!!Translit.!!Name\n!\n!Letter!!Translit.!!Name\n!\n!Letter!!Translit.!!Name\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌀}}||a||a\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌁}}||b||be\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌂}}||c||ke\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌃}}||d||de\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌄}}||e||e\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌅}}||v||ve\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌆}}||z||ze\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌇}}||h||he\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌈}}||þ||the\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌉}}||i||i\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌊}}||k||ka\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌋}}||l||el\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌌}}||m||em\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌍}}||n||en\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌎}}||š||esh\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌏}}||o||o\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌐}}||p||pe\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌑}}||ś||she\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌒}}||q||ku\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌓}}||r||er\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌔}}||s||es\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌕}}||t||te\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌖}}||u||u\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌗}}||x||eks\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌘}}||ph||phe\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌙}}||ch||khe\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌚}}||f||ef\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌛}}||ř||ers\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌜}}||ç||che\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌝}}||í||ii\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌞}}||ú||uu\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌟}}||*||ess\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌠}}||I||1\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌡}}||V||5\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌢}}||X||10\n|\n|style=\"font-size:x-large\"|{{script|Ital|𐌣}}||L||50\n|}-->\n\n==See also==\n* [[Euboean alphabet]]\n* [[Alphabets of Asia Minor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |last=Bonfante |first=Giuliano |first2=Larissa |last2=Bonfante |title=The Etruscan Language: An Introduction |location=Manchester |publisher=Manchester University Press |year=2002 |edition=2nd |isbn=0-7190-5539-3 }}\n*{{cite book |last=Mullen |first=Alex |title=Southern Gaul and the Mediterranean: Multilingualism and Multiple Identities in the Iron Age and Roman Periods |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-107-02059-7 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Etruscan alphabet|Italic letters}}\n{{Commons|Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan alphabet}}\n{{Commons category|Nucerian alphabet}}\n{{Library resources box |by=no |onlinebooks=yes |others=yes |about=yes |label=Old Italic script\n  |viaf= |lccn= |lcheading= |wikititle= }}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050330053810/http://etp.classics.umass.edu/ Etruscan Texts Project]: A searchable online database of Etruscan inscriptions.\n* [https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10300.pdf Old Italic Unicode]\n* [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/etruscan.htm The Etruscan alphabet] (Omniglot)\n* [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/olditalic.htm Old Italic alphabets] (Omniglot)\n* [http://www.ancientscripts.com/etruscan.html Etruscan] (Ancient Scripts)\n* [http://www.ancientscripts.com/oscan.html Oscan] (Ancient Scripts)\n* [http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_OldItalic.html Unicode Fonts]\n\n{{list of writing systems}}\n{{Etruscans}}\n\n[[Category:Palaeography]]\n[[Category:Obsolete writing systems]]\n[[Category:Greek alphabet]]\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:Scripts encoded in Unicode 3.1]]\n\n[[it:Lingua etrusca#Alfabeto]]"

Texts written in this cuneiform have been found in [[Iran]] ([[Persepolis]], [[Susa]], [[Hamadan]], [[Kharg Island]]), [[Armenia]], [[Romania]] ([[Gherla]]),{{sfn|Kuhrt|2013|page=197}}{{sfn|Frye|1984|page=103}}{{sfn|Schmitt|2000|page=53}} [[Turkey]] ([[Van Fortress]]), and along the [[Suez Canal]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 6. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref>  They were mostly inscriptions from the time period of [[Darius I]], such as the [[DNa inscription]], as well as his son, [[Xerxes I]]. Later kings down to [[Artaxerxes III]] used more recent forms of the language classified as \"pre-Middle Persian\".<ref name=\"OPGTL 6\" />\n\n==History==\n\nOld Persian cuneiform is loosely inspired by the [[Sumerian language|Sumero]]-[[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]; however, only one [[glyph]] is directly derived from it - ''l(a)'' (<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎾</span>), from ''la'' ({{cuneiform|𒆷}}). (''l<sup>a</sup>'' did not occur in native Old Persian words, but was found in Akkadian borrowings.)\n\nScholars today mostly agree that the Old Persian script was invented by about 525 BC to provide monument inscriptions for the [[Achaemenid]] king [[Darius I of Persia|Darius I]], to be used at [[Behistun]]. While a few Old Persian texts seem to be inscribed during the reigns of [[Cyrus the Great]] (CMa, CMb, and CMc, all found at [[Pasargadae]]), the first Achaemenid emperor, or [[Arsames of Persia|Arsames]] and [[Ariaramnes of Persia|Ariaramnes]] (AsH and AmH, both found at [[Hamadan]]), grandfather and great-grandfather of Darius I, all five, specially the later two, are generally agreed to have been later inscriptions.\n\nAround the time period in which Old Persian was used, nearby languages included [[Elamite]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]].  One of the main differences between the writing systems of these languages is that Old Persian is a semi-alphabet while [[Elamite cuneiform|Elamite]] and [[Cuneiform script#Akkadian cuneiform|Akkadian]] were syllabic. In addition, while Old Persian is written in a consistent semi-alphabetic system, Elamite and Akkadian used borrowings from other languages, creating mixed systems.\n\n==Decipherment==\nMuch of the progress made in [[decipherment]] depended on the names of kings.  Attempts at deciphering Old Persian cuneiform started in 1711 when some of Darius's inscriptions were published by [[Jean Chardin]].<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\">Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 9. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref> In 1802, [[Friedrich Münter]] realized that recurring groups of characters must be the word for “king”. [[Georg Friedrich Grotefend]] extended this work by realizing a king's name is often followed by “great king, king of kings” and the name of the king's father.<ref>Kent, R. G.: \"Old Persian: Grammar Texts Lexicon\", page 10. American Oriental Society, 1950.</ref>\n\nGrotefend made a major breakthrough when he noticed that one of the kings' father was not a king.  In Persian history around the time period the inscriptions were expected to be made, there were only two instances where a ruler came to power without being a previous king's son.  They were [[Darius the Great]] and [[Cyrus the Great]], both of whom became emperor by revolt. The deciding factors between these two choices were the names of their fathers and sons. Darius's father was Hystaspes and his son was [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], while Cyrus' father was [[Cambyses I]] and his son was [[Cambyses II]]. Within the text, the father and son of the king had different groups of symbols for names so Grotefend assumed that the king must have been Darius. These connections allowed Grotefend to figure out the cuneiform characters that are part of Darius, Darius's father Hystaspes, and Darius's son [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]]. Grotefend's contribution to Old Persian is unique in that he did not have comparisons between Old Persian and known languages, as opposed to the decipherment of the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the [[Rosetta Stone]]. All his decipherments were done by comparing the texts with known history.\n\nMore advances were made on Grotefend's work and by 1847, most of the symbols were correctly identified.  Notable uses of Old Persian's decipherment include the decipherment of Elamite and Akkadian through the [[Behistun Inscription]].\n\n==Signs==\n[[File:DNa Inscription Dārayavauš.jpg|thumb|<center>The name of [[Darius I]] in Old Persian cuneiform on the [[DNa inscription]] of [[Tomb of Darius I|his tomb]]: ''Dārayavauš'' ([[Wikt:𐎭𐎠𐎼𐎹𐎺𐎢𐏁|𐎭𐎠𐎼𐎹𐎺𐎢𐏁]])</center>]]\nMost scholars consider the writing system to be an independent invention because it has no obvious connections with other writing systems at the time, such as [[Elamite language|Elamite]], Akkadian, [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]] cuneiforms.<ref>Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 1. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> While Old Persian's basic strokes are similar to those found in cuneiform scripts, Old Persian texts were engraved on hard materials, so the engravers had to make cuts that imitated the forms easily made on clay tablets.<ref name=\"OPGTL 9\" />  The signs are composed of horizontal, vertical, and angled wedges.  There are four basic components and new signs are created by adding wedges to these basic components.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\">Windfuhr, G. L.: \"Notes on the old Persian signs\", page 2. Indo-Iranian Journal, 1970.</ref> These four basic components are two parallel wedges without angle, three parallel wedges without angle, one wedge without angle and an angled wedge, and two angled wedges.<ref name=\"NOPS 2\" /> The script is written from left to right.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 134. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nThe script encodes three vowels, ''a'', ''i'', ''u'', and twenty-two consonants, ''k'', ''x'', ''g'', ''c'', ''ç'', ''j'', ''t'', ''θ'', ''d'', ''p'', ''f'', ''b'', ''n'', ''m'', ''y'', ''v'', ''r'', ''l'', ''s'', ''z'', ''š'', and ''h''.  Old Persian contains two sets of consonants: those whose shape depends on the following vowel and those whose shape is independent of the following vowel.  The consonant symbols that depend on the following vowel act like the consonants in [[Devanagari]].  Vowel diacritics are added to these consonant symbols to change the inherent vowel or add length to the inherent vowel.  However, the vowel symbols are usually still included so [di] would be written as [di] [i] even though [di] already implies the vowel.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 136. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref> For the consonants whose shape does not depend on the following vowels, the vowel signs must be used after the consonant symbol.<ref>Daniels, Peter T.: \"The World's Writing Systems\", page 135. Oxford University Press, 1996</ref>\n\nCompared to the [[Avestan alphabet]] Old Persian notably lacks voiced fricatives, but includes the sign ''ç'' (of uncertain pronunciation) and a sign for the non-native ''l''. Notably, in common with the [[Brahmic scripts]], there appears to be no distinction between a consonant followed by an ''a'' and a consonant followed by nothing.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|  ||  || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">k-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">x-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">g-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">c-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">ç-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">j-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">t-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">θ-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">d-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">p-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">f-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">b-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">n-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">m-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">y-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">v-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">r-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">l-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">s-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">z-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">š-</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">h-</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-(a)</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎠</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎣</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎧</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎥</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎨</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐏂</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎩</span>  || rowspan=2|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎫</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎰</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎭</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎱</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎳</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎲</span> || rowspan=2|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎴</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎶</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎹</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎺</span> || rowspan=2|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎼</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎾</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎿</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐏀</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐏁</span> || rowspan=3|<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐏃</span>\n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-i</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎡</span> \n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">—</span> !! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">—</span> \n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎪</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎮</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎷</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎻</span> \n|-\n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">-u</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎢</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎤</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎦</span> \n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">—</span> \n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎬</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎯</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎵</span> || <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎸</span> \n! <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">—</span> \n| <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">𐎽</span> \n|-\n|}\n\n*logograms:\n**''[[Ahura Mazda|Auramazdā]]'': {{script|Xpeo|𐏈}}, {{script|Xpeo|𐏉}}, {{script|Xpeo|𐏊}} (genitive)\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">xšāyaθiya</span>'' \"king\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|𐏋}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">dahyāuš-</span>'' \"country\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|𐏌}}, {{script|XPeo|𐏍}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">baga-</span>'' \"god\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|𐏎}}</span>\n**''<span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">būmiš-</span>'' \"earth\": <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|𐏏}}</span>\n*[[word divider]]: <span lang=\"peo\" dir=\"ltr\">{{script|XPeo|𐏐}}</span>\n*numerals:<ref>Unattested numbers are not listed.

Inscription.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Old Persian inscription in [[Persepolis]]]]\nAlthough based on a logo-syllabic prototype, all vowels but short /a/ are written and so the system is essentially an [[alphabet]]. There are three vowels, long and short. Initially, no distinction is made for length: 𐎠 ''a'' or ''ā,'' 𐎡 ''i'' or ''ī,'' 𐎢 ''u'' or ''ū.'' However, as in the Brahmic scripts, short ''a'' is not written after a consonant: 𐏃 ''h'' or ''ha,'' 𐏃𐎠 ''hā,'' 𐏃𐎡 ''hi'' or ''hī,'' 𐏃𐎢 ''hu'' or ''hū.'' (Old Persian is not considered an [[abugida]] because vowels are represented as full letters.)\n\nThirteen out of twenty-two consonants, such as 𐏃 ''h(a),'' are invariant, regardless of the following vowel (that is, they are alphabetic), while only six have a distinct form for each consonant-vowel combination (that is, they are syllabic), and among these, only ''d'' and ''m'' occur in three forms for all three vowels: 𐎭 ''d'' or ''da,'' 𐎭𐎠 ''dā,'' 𐎮𐎡 ''di'' or ''dī,'' 𐎯𐎢 ''du'' or ''dū.'' (''k, g'' do not occur before ''i,'' and ''j, v'' do not occur before ''u,'' so these consonants only have two forms each.)\n\nSometimes medial long vowels are written with a ''y'' or ''v,'' as in Semitic: 𐎮𐎡𐎹 ''dī,'' 𐎯𐎢𐎺 ''dū.'' Diphthongs are written by mismatching consonant and vowel: 𐎭𐎡 ''dai'', or sometimes, in cases where the consonant does not differentiate between vowels, by writing the consonant and both vowel components: 𐎨𐎡𐏁𐎱𐎡𐏁 ''cišpaiš'' (gen. of name Cišpi- '[[Teispes]]').\n\nIn addition, three consonants, ''t'', ''n'', and ''r'', are partially syllabic, having the same form before ''a'' and ''i'', and a distinct form only before ''u'': 𐎴 ''n'' or ''na,'' 𐎴𐎠 ''nā,'' 𐎴𐎡 ''ni'' or ''nī,'' 𐎵𐎢 ''nu'' or ''nū.''\n\nThe effect is not unlike the English {{IPA|[dʒ]}} sound, which is typically written ''g'' before ''i'' or ''e'', but ''j'' before other vowels (''gem'', ''jam''), or the [[Castilian Spanish]] {{IPA|[θ]}} sound, which is written ''c'' before ''i'' or ''e'' and ''z'' before other vowels (''cinco, zapato''): it is more accurate to say that some of the Old Persian consonants are written by different letters depending on the following vowel, rather than classifying the script as syllabic. This situation had its origin in [[Cuneiform script#Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian cuneiform]], where several syllabic distinctions had been lost and were often clarified with explicit vowels. However, in the case of Assyrian, the vowel was not always used, and was never used where not needed, so the system remained (logo-)syllabic.\n\nFor a while it was speculated that the alphabet could have had its origin in such a system, with a leveling of consonant signs a millennium earlier producing something like the [[Ugaritic alphabet]], but today it is generally accepted that the Semitic alphabet arose from [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], where vowel notation was not important.

[[:zh:s:史記/卷110|110]]) from a 2nd-century BCE [[Yan (state)|Yan]] renegade and dignitary named [[Zhonghang Yue]] ({{zh|s=中行说|p=Zhōngháng Yuè}}).{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} Yue \"taught the [[Chanyu]] (rulers of the [[Xiongnu]]) to write official letters to the Chinese court on a wooden tablet ({{zh|s=牍|t=牘|p=dú|links=no}}) 31 cm long, and to use a seal and large-sized folder\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} The same sources{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} tell that when the Xiongnu noted down something or transmitted a message, they made cuts on a piece of wood (''gemu''). They also mention a \"Hu script\". At the [[Noin-Ula burial site]] and other Hun burial sites in Mongolia and regions north of [[Lake Baikal]], the artifacts displayed over twenty carved characters.

The ''[[Book of Zhou]]'', dating to the 7th century, mentions that the Turks had a written language similar to that of the Sogdians. Two other sources, the ''[[Book of Sui]]'' and the ''[[History of the Northern Dynasties]]'' claim that the Turks did not have a written language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lung 龍|first=Rachel 惠珠|title=Interpreters in Early Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsNoHtgkGPkC|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-2444-7|pages=54–55}}</ref>\n\n==Corpus==\nThe Old Turkic corpus consists of about two hundred<ref name=erdal>Erdal, Marcel. 2004.

The [[Tonyukuk inscription]], a monument situated somewhat farther east, is slightly earlier, dating to ca. 722.

Such vowels can be [[Inherent vowel|taken as intrinsic to the consonant sign]], giving the Old Turkic alphabet an aspect of an [[abugida]] script. In these cases, it is customary to use superscript numerals ¹ and ² to mark consonant signs used with back and front vowels, respectively. This convention was introduced by Thomsen (1893), and followed by Gabain (1941), Malov (1951) and Tekin (1968).{{Citation needed|reason=please create official citation|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Vowels ===\n{| class=\"wikitable wide\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! align=\"center\" colspan=2 | Orkhon !! rowspan=2 | Yenisei <br/>variants !! rowspan=2 | [[Transliteration|Trans-<br>literation]] !! rowspan=2 | [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n|-\n!

The preserved inscriptions were dated to between the 8th and 10th centuries.\n\nThese alphabets are divided into four groups by Kyzlasov (1994)<ref>Kyzlasov I. L.; \"Writings Of Eurasian Steppes\", Eastern Literature, Moscow, 1994, 327 pp. 321-323</ref> \n* [[Languages of Asia|Asiatic]] group (includes Orkhon proper)\n* [[Eurasia]]tic group\n* [[Southern Europe]] group\n\nThe [[Languages of Asia|Asiatic]] group is further divided into three related alphabets:\n* Orkhon alphabet, Göktürks, 8th to 10th centuries\n* Yenisei alphabet,\n** Talas alphabet, a derivative of the Yenisei alphabet, [[Kangju|Kangly]] or [[Karluks]] 8th to 10th centuries. Talas inscriptions include Terek-Say rock inscriptions found in the 1897, Koysary text, Bakaiyr gorge inscriptions, Kalbak-Tash 6 and 12 inscriptions, Talas alphabet has 29 identified letters.<ref>Kyzlasov I. L.; \"Writings Of Eurasian Steppes\", Eastern Literature, Moscow, 1994, pp. 98-100</ref>\n\nThe Eurasiatic group is further divided into five related alphabets:\n* Achiktash, used in [[Sogdia]] 8th to 10th centuries.\n* South-Yenisei, used by the Göktürks 8th to 10th centuries.\n* Two especially similar alphabets: the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] alphabet, used by the [[Khazars]], 8th to 10th centuries; and the Kuban alphabet, used by the [[Bulgars]], 8th to 13th centuries. Inscriptions in both alphabets are found in the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] and on the banks of the [[Kama]] river.\n* [[Tisza]], used by the [[Pechenegs]] 8th to 10th centuries.\n\nA number of alphabets are incompletely collected due to the limitations of the extant inscriptions. Evidence in the study of the Turkic scripts includes Turkic-Chinese bilingual inscriptions, contemporaneous Turkic inscriptions in the Greek alphabet, literal translations into Slavic languages, and paper fragments with Turkic cursive writing from religion, [[Manichaeism]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and legal subjects of the 8th to 10th centuries found in [[Xinjiang]].\n\n== Unicode ==\n\n{{Main|Old Turkic (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe Unicode block for Old Turkic is U+10C00&ndash;U+10C4F. It was added to the [[Unicode]] standard in October 2009, with the release of version 5.2. It includes separate \"Orkhon\" and \"Yenisei\" variants of individual characters.\n\nSince [[Windows 8]] Unicode Old Turkic writing support was added in the [[Segoe]] font.\n\n{{Unicode chart Old Turkic}}\n\n==See also==\n*{{section link|Neolithic signs in China|Banpo and Jiangzhai}}\n*[[Khazar language]]\n*[[Tariat inscriptions]]\n*[[Sükhbaatar inscriptions]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Diringer, David]].

Because [[Latin script|Latin]] orthographies were subject to interference from English conventions among Osage students who were more familiar with English than with Osage, in 2006 the director of the Osage Language Program, Herman Mongrain Lookout, decided to create a distinct script by modifying or fusing Latin letters. This Osage script has been in regular use on the [[Osage Nation]] ever since.<ref>[http://www.osagetribe.com/language/about_us.aspx Osage Nation Language Department] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120021201/http://www.osagetribe.com/language/about_us.aspx |date=2011-11-20 }}</ref> \n\nIn 2012, while in the process of submitting the script to Unicode, a more precise representation of the sounds of Osage was formulated, and by the following year had been adequately tested. In February 2014, a conference on standardizing the reforms was held by Lookout and the staff at the Osage Nation Language Department along with [[Universal Character Set|UCS]] expert [[Michael Everson]]. The result included the introduction of case, the abolition of two ligatures and the addition of several derived characters for sounds that varied between dialects.<ref name=\"N4619\">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2014/14214-n4619-osage.pdf|title=Final proposal to encode the Osage script in the UCS|date=2014-09-21|publisher=ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2, Document N4619|language=en|format=PDF|access-date=2015-01-10|author1=Michael Everson |author2=Herman Mongrain Lookout |author3=Cameron Pratt }}</ref>\n\nThe Osage script was included in Unicode version 9.0 in June 2016 in the [[Osage (Unicode block)|Osage block]].<ref>[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/ Unicode version 9.0.0]</ref>\n\n==Letters==\nFor the pronunciation of the letters of the alphabet, see [[Osage language#Phonology]] or the links below.\n\n=== Vowels ===\nThe 2014 vowel letters are as follows:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+Osage vowels\n!colspan=2|Oral !!colspan=2|[[Nasal vowel|Nasal]]\n|-\n!Osage || Latin || Osage || Latin\n|-\n| 𐒰 𐓘 || A a \n| 𐒰&#x358; 𐓘&#x358; || Ą ą\n|-\n| 𐒱 𐓙 || Ai ai \n| 𐒲 𐓚 || Aį aį \n|-\n| 𐒳 𐓛 || Ə ə\n| 𐒳&#x358; 𐓛&#x358; || Ə̨ ə̨\n|-\n| 𐒷 𐓟 || E e\n| 𐒸 𐓠 || Eį eį\n|-\n| 𐒻 𐓣 || I i\n| 𐒻&#x358; 𐓣&#x358; || Į į\n|-\n| 𐓂 𐓪 || O o \n| 𐓂&#x358; 𐓪&#x358; || Ǫ ǫ\n|-\n| 𐓎 𐓶 || U u\n| 𐓃 𐓫 || Oį oį\n|}\n\nLong vowels are indicated with a macron, high tone by an acute accent, and a long vowel with high tone by a double acute accent: e.g. oral {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x304; 𐓘&#x304;}} ''Ā ā'', {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x301; 𐓘&#x301;}} ''Á á'', {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x30b; 𐓘&#x30b;}} ''Ā&#x301; ā&#x301;'',, nasal {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x358;&#x304; 𐓘&#x358;&#x304;}} ''Ą&#x304; ą&#x304;'', {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x358;&#x301; 𐓘&#x358;&#x301;}} ''Ą&#x301; ą&#x301;'', {{angle bracket|𐒰&#x358;&#x30b; 𐓘&#x358;&#x30b;}} ''Ą&#x304;&#x301; ą&#x304;&#x301;''. \n\nIt is not clear how ''Ə'' is used, as it is not phonemic in Osage. \n\nThe ''a'' comes from Latin {{angle bracket|A}} (without the crossbar, as in the [[NASA|NΛSΛ]] logo), ''e'' from Latin cursive {{angle bracket|''Ɑ''}} (the 'long' sound of the English letter ''a'' is rather like Osage ''e''). The source for ''i'' is obscure, though Latin {{angle bracket|I}} does appear inside {{angle bracket|Λ}} in the diphthong ''ai''.\n\n=== Consonants ===\nThe 2014 consonant letters and digraphs are as follows. As in Latin orthography, the [[ejective consonant]]s are written with a diacritic, and the strongly aspirated stops with digraphs. The pre-aspirated stops were originally written as digraphs with ''h'', but since they vary by dialect with [[geminate]]s, the 2014 revision included new letters for them derived by adding a cross-bar. \n\n{| class=wikitable \n|+Osage consonants\n!colspan=2| Plain ||colspan=2| [[Ejective consonant|Ejective]] ||colspan=2| [[aspirated consonant|Aspirated]] || colspan=2| [[Pre-aspirated]]<br>/[[geminate]]\n|-\n!Osage||Latin||Osage||Latin||Osage||Latin||Osage||Latin\n|-\n| 𐒴 𐓜 || Br br\n|-\n| 𐓊 𐓲 || C c (ts) || 𐓊ʼ 𐓲ʼ || Cʼ cʼ || 𐓌 𐓴 || Ch ch || 𐓋 𐓳 || Hc hc\n|-\n| 𐒵 𐓝 || Č č || colspan=4|  || 𐒶 𐓞 || Hč hč\n|-\n| 𐓍 𐓵 || Ð ð\n|-\n| 𐒹 𐓡 || H h \n|-\n| 𐒺 𐓢 || Hy hy\n|-\n| 𐒼 𐓤 || K k || 𐒼ʼ 𐓤ʼ || Kʼ kʼ || 𐒼𐓸 𐓤𐓸 || Kx kx || 𐒽 𐓥 || Hk hk\n|-\n| 𐒾 𐓦 || Ky ky || colspan=2| || 𐒼𐓯 𐓤𐓯 || Kš kš\n|-\n| 𐒿 𐓧 || L l\n|-\n| 𐓀 𐓨 || M m\n|-\n| 𐓁 𐓩 || N n\n|-\n| 𐓄 𐓬 || P p || 𐓄ʼ 𐓬ʼ || Pʼ pʼ || 𐓄𐓸 𐓬𐓸 || Px px || 𐓅 𐓭 || Hp hp\n|-\n| colspan=4| || 𐓄𐓯 𐓬𐓯 || Pš pš\n|-\n| 𐓆 𐓮 || S s\n|-\n| 𐓇 𐓯 || Š š\n|-\n| 𐓈 𐓰 || T t || colspan=2| || 𐓈𐓸 𐓰𐓸 || Tx tx || 𐓉 𐓱 || Ht ht \n|-\n| 𐓏 𐓷 || W w\n|-\n| 𐓐 𐓸 || X x\n|-\n| 𐓑 𐓹 || Ɣ ɣ (gh)\n|-\n| 𐓒 𐓺 || Z z\n|-\n| 𐓓 𐓻 || Ž ž\n|}\n\n''Px'' and ''pš'' are allophones, as are ''kx'' ~ ''kš'' and ''tx'' ~ ''ch'' (tsh). ''Hy'' and ''ky'' are sequences rather than single consonants.\n\nThe source of ''p'' is Latin {{angle bracket|P}}, that of ''t'' is Latin {{angle bracket|D}} (an alternative transcription of Osage ''t''), ''č'' is from {{angle bracket|Ch}}, ''k'' from {{angle bracket|K}}. ''C'' is from {{angle bracket|Ts}} and the Osage ''s''. ''S'' and ''z'' are the top halves of {{angle bracket|S}} and {{angle bracket|Z}}; ''š'' and ''ž'' are derived from adding a tail to the full letters, much like Latin {{angle bracket|ʒ}}.

The \"river\" is referred to in the Torah (Isaiah 11:15-16) as the Euphrates River. In the mystical Kabbalah the Euphrates River is symbolic of the sephira Binah in the tree of life .  Binah is derived from the Hebrew root (bein) meaning \"between\" and is often referred to as a river.  In \"Passing the River\" the Kabbalist is believed to have achieved the edge \"between\" the uppermost supernal triad and the lower sephiroth on the tree of life in Kabbalah.  This writing system was designed to enable Kabbalists to reveal or conceal teachings; and served as a type and rite of passage.  The Hebrew patriarch Abraham is said to have been entrusted with this alphabet.          \n\nIt is often used in modern [[Wicca]] and forms of [[Witchcraft]] to hide magical writings such as the contents within one's [[Book of Shadows]] from others.  It is also an archaic ritual part of the mystical teachings of Free Masonry.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ptr.htm Passing the River alphabet  at Omniglot]\n\n[[Category:Alphabets]]\n[[Category:Witchcraft]]\n\n\n{{writingsystem-stub}}"

Стефан Пермский) in 1372. The name ''Abur'' is derived from the names of the first two characters: ''An'' and ''Bur''. The script derived from [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], with [[Komi language|Komi]] \"Tamga\" signs, the latter being similar in the appearance to [[rune]]s or [[siglas poveiras]] because they were created by incisions rather than by usual writing. The inclusion of the latter aided the script to greater acceptance among the medieval Permic speakers of the time.\n\nThe script was in use until the 17th century, when it was superseded by the [[Cyrillic script]]. Abur was also used as cryptographic writing for the [[Russian language]].\n\nApril 26, which is the saint's day of Stephen of Perm, is celebrated as Old Permic Alphabet Day.\n\n==Significance==\n[[Image:Wikipedia-logo-kv.png|thumb|Wikipedia logo in Old Permic and Cyrillic script|right]]\nThe Abur inscriptions are among the oldest relics of the [[Uralic languages]]. Only one of them has earlier documents: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], which had been written using the [[Old Hungarian script]] first before the Latin script was used after 1000.\n\nFor comparison, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as a written language [[Mikael Agricola|appeared only]] after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 1543. However, an isolated [[Birch bark letter no. 292|birch bark letter]], found in 1957 in [[Novgorod]] and written in a [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]], has been dated to the beginning of the 13th century.\n\n==Characters==\nLytkin's 1952 work is often considered the authoritative source of documentation for this script.<ref>Лыткин, В. И. 1952. Древнепермский язык: чтение текстов, грамматика, словарь. Москва</ref> There are 24 primary characters, along with 10 secondary characters that are subordinate to the primary characters. There are also some combining marks that may have been used for phonological purposes, in addition to some combining letters from Latin and Cyrillic that have been found as well. Spaces, middle dots, and semi-apostrophes have also been seen as punctuation in documents. A Cyrillic combining titlo is used to indicate numerals.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{See also|Old Permic (Unicode block)}}\nOld Permic (U+10350&ndash;1037F) was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\n{{Unicode chart Old Permic}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://peoples.org.ru/abur.html|title=Abur at Minority languages of Russia on the Net|language=Russian}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/oldpermic.htm|title=Abur|publisher= Omniglot.com}}\n\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n[[Category:Alphabets|Permic script, Old]]\n[[Category:1372 introductions]]\n[[Category:Obsolete writing systems]]\n[[Category:Scripts encoded in Unicode 7.0]]"

Letters that do not link to a following letter ===\nSeven letters ({{lang|fa|و}}, {{lang|fa|ژ}}, {{lang|fa|ز}}, {{lang|fa|ر}}, {{lang|fa|ذ}}, {{lang|fa|د}}, {{lang|fa|ا}}) do not connect to a following letter, unlike the rest of the letters of the alphabet. The seven letters have the same form in isolated and initial position and a second form in medial and final position. For example, when the letter {{lang|fa|ا}} {{transl|fa|alef}} is at the beginning of a word such as {{lang|fa|اینجا}} {{transl|fa|injâ}} (\"here\"), the same form is used as in an isolated {{transl|fa|alef}}. In the case of {{lang|fa|امروز}} {{transl|fa|emruz}} (\"today\"), the letter {{lang|fa|ر}} {{transl|fa|re}} takes the final form and the letter {{lang|fa|و}} {{transl|fa|vâv}} takes the isolated form, but they are in the middle of the word, and {{lang|fa|ز}} also has its isolated form, but it occurs at the end of the word.\n\n===Diacritics===\nPersian script has adopted a subset of [[Arabic diacritics]]: zebar {{IPAslink|æ}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}} in Arabic), zir {{IPAslink|e}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}} in Arabic), and piš {{IPA|/}}{{IPAlink|o}}{{IPA link|u̯}}{{IPA|/}} ''or'' {{IPAslink|o}} ({{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}} in Arabic, pronounced ''zamme'' in [[Western Persian]]), [[Nunation|tanwīne nasb]] {{IPA|/æn/}} and [[šaddah]] ([[gemination]]). Other Arabic diacritics may be seen in Arabic loanwords.\n\n====Short vowels====\nOf the four Arabic short vowels, the Persian language has adopted the following three. The last one, [[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|sukūn]], is not adopted. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Short vowels<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliterated)\n!Trans.\n!Value\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>064E</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|◌&zwj;َ}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|زبر<br />(فتحه)}}\n|{{transl|fa|zebar}}/{{transl|fa|zibar}}\n|{{transl|fa|a}}\n|{{abbr|Ir.|Iranian Persian}}&nbsp;{{IPA|/æ/}}; {{abbr|D.|Dari of Afghanistan}}&nbsp;{{IPA|/a/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>0650</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|◌&zwj;ِ}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|زیر<br /> (کسره)}}\n|{{transl|fa|zer}}/{{transl|fa|zir}}\n|{{transl|fa|e}}\n|{{IPA|/e/}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\" |<small>064F</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|◌&zwj;ُ}}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|پیش<br />(ضمّه)}}\n|{{transl|fa|peš}}/{{transl|fa|piš}}\n|{{transl|fa|o}}\n|{{IPA|/o/}}\n|}\nIn Iranian Persian, none of these short vowels may be the initial or final grapheme in an isolated word, although they may appear in the final position as an [[inflection]], when the word is part of a noun group. In a word that starts with a vowel, the first grapheme is a silent ''alef'' which carries the short vowel, e.g. {{Lang|fa|اُمید}} (''omid'', meaning \"hope\"). In a word that ends with a vowel, letters {{Lang|fa|ع|rtl=yes}}, {{Lang|fa|ه|rtl=yes}} and {{Lang|fa|و}} respectively become the proxy letters for ''zebar'', ''zir'' and ''piš'', e.g. نو (''now'', meaning \"new\") or بسته (''bast-e'', meaning \"package\").\n\n====Tanvin (nunation)====\n{{main article|Nunation}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nunation<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliterated)\n!Notes\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064B</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| َاً، ـاً، ءً }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|تنوین نَصْبْ}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine nasb}}\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064D</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| ٍِ }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|تنوین جَرّ}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine jarr}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Never used in the Persian language.\nTaught in [[Islamic]] nations to\n\ncomplement [[Quran]] education.\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>064C</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| ٌ }}</span>\n|{{lang|fa|تنوین رَفْعْ}}\n|{{transl|fa|Tanvine rafʔ}}\n|}\n\n====Tašdid====\n{{main article|Šadda}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Nunation<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Name<br/>(in Persian)\n!Name<br/>(transliteration)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0651</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| ّ }}</span>\n|تشدید\n|{{transl|fa|tašdid}}\n|}\n\n===Other characters===\nThe following are not actual letters but different orthographical shapes for letters, a ligature in the case of the {{transl|sem|lâm alef}}. As to {{lang|fa|ﺀ}} (''[[hamza]]''), it has only one graphic since it is never tied to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes 'seated' on a vâv, ye or alef, and in that case, the seat behaves like an ordinary vâv, ye or alef respectively. Technically, ''hamza'' is not a letter but a diacritic.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! Name\n! Pronunciation\n! [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n! Unicode\n!

      "text": "Afghanistan possesses a rich [[language|linguistic]] legacy of pre-Islamic scripts, which existed before being displaced by the [[Arabic alphabet]], after the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan]].\nAmong these scripts are [[Śāradā script|Sharada]], [[Gāndhārī language|Gandhari]], [[Kharosthi]], [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]] and [[Brahmi script|Brāhmī]] . For thousands of years, Afghanistan was inhabited by Indo-Vedic people and thus all ancient documents, tracts, monuments and remains are of Hindu origins. Later, Buddhism became the major force in Afghanistan and brought with it its own liturgical languages.\n\nAbundant archeological evidence in the form of [[inscriptions]], [[numismatics]] and [[manuscripts]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} has provided traces of the precursors of the contemporary [[Languages of Afghanistan]] such as [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Dari language|Dari]] and other [[Dardic languages]].\n\n==Sanskrit==\nRecent Archeological unearthings of [[Sanskrit]] inscriptions attest to the prevalence of the Sanskrit alphabet in Afghanistan. \n\nSome later Sanskrit inscriptions in late Brahmi of about around the fifth to eighth centuries have also been found in Afghanistan in recent decades. Worthy of note are the Dilberjin fresco inscriptions (Drevniaia Baktriia); the [[Gardez]] inscriptions on an image of Ganesa; and the [[Parvati|Uma]] Maheshvara image inscriptions from Tapa Skandar.

Gandhari most likely was the daily language of the [[Kushan]]s after they established their empire. From Gandhara, this script spread east and north into various parts of [[Central Asia]]. In the centuries that followed, Kharoshthi became the main script in the [[Tarim basin]] (now part of China's [[Xinjiang]] [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] Autonomous region) for writing local languages.<ref>''The Silk Road in World History'', Xinru Liu, p.58, Oxford University Press</ref>\n\n==Kharosthi==\nInscriptions and documents in [[Kharosthi]] have been found over a broad area in Afghanistan.

The Quikscript text reads, \"This is the way to do it.\"]]\n'''Quikscript''' (also known as the '''Read Alphabet''' and '''Second Shaw''') is an [[alphabet]] (and [[phonemic orthography]]) specifically designed for the [[English language]]. Quikscript replaces traditional English orthography, which uses the [[Latin alphabet]], with completely new letters. It is phonemically regular, compact, and designed to be comfortably and quickly written. There are also Quikscript alphabets adapted for other languages, using the same letters for sounds which do not exist in English.\n\n==Origins and history==\n{{See also|Shavian alphabet}}\n[[George Bernard Shaw]], the writer, critic and playwright, was a highly vocal critic of English spelling because it lacked a coherent system for representing the phonemes of English accurately. As a result, for years he wrote his literary works using [[Pitman shorthand]].  However, he found its limitations frustrating as well and realized that it was not a suitable replacement for the Latin alphabet, being difficult to use to produce printed material and impossible to type.  A shorthand is, by definition, more specialized than an alphabet, which represents the standard written form of a language.  Shaw desired and advocated a phonetic reworking of written English, and this called for a new alphabet.\n\nTo that end, Shaw placed in his will provisions instructing his executor to organize a world-wide competition to design an improved English alphabet.  A British designer, [[Ronald Kingsley Read]], who had corresponded extensively with Shaw for several years regarding just such an alphabet, was selected along with three other finalists as the winners of the competition. Read was chosen to design the final form of the alphabet.  The \"Shaw Alphabet\" or \"[[Shavian]]\", as it is now generally known, was the result.\n\nTo provide field testing of the new alphabet, Read organized a lengthy public testing phase of Shavian by some 500 users from around the world who spoke different dialects of English. Once he had analyzed the results of those tests, Read decided to revise Shavian to incorporate a number of changes to improve the alphabet and make it both easier and faster to write.  He called the revised alphabet \"Quikscript\".  In 1966 he published the Quikscript manual which set out the alphabet's rationale, and briefly discussed different possible methods of alphabet reform.  The heart of the manual provided comprehensive instructions regarding the use of the alphabet along with reading samples.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Quickscript alphabet revised names.png|thumb|right|240px|Alphabet chart with names for all letters and ligatures.]]\nEach Quikscript letter represents one, and only one, English phoneme. There are 25 consonants and 15 vowels, totaling in all 40 letters. The letters are also designed to be written easily and each of them only requires a single (usually curved) stroke of pen.\n\n* Just as in the Roman alphabet, there are short letters, a, c, e, m, and n, written between the base writing line and the \"upper parallel\" (as Read calls it), tall letters, b, d, f, k, and t, which ascend above the top of the short letters, and deep letters, g, j, p and y, which descend below the base writing line. Quikscript, however, makes better use of these possibilities by using 11 tall, 11 deep, and 18 short letters. All vowels are short letters, just as they are in the Roman alphabet.\n* The most common phonemes have the simplest letter shapes.\n* Similar sounding phonemes have similar letter shapes. Examples:\n** Long vowels and glides are written with a larger bend or loop, while short vowels have a simpler shape.\n** Every voiced consonant is written with a deep letter similar in shape to the corresponding voiceless consonant which in turn is written with a tall letter.\n* While the Roman alphabet has two distinct forms in common use, which are designated as lower and upper case, this concept does not exist in the Quikscript alphabet.  There is only one form for the majority of the letters. Names and proper nouns are preceded with a mid-line dot (called a name-dot) which is sufficient to distinguish them from ordinary words.\n* Beginners learn Junior Quikscript first.  Each word is spelled \"as it is spoken\".  Each letter is written separately from the next so that it is equivalent to what is termed \"printing\" in the Roman alphabet.  Some people may prefer Junior Quikscript for printed texts as readers are used to the Roman alphabet being printed in that manner.\n* Senior Quikscript introduces a number of advanced techniques which save time in writing. The most obvious difference between the two is that Senior encourages the connection of one letter to the next as long as the shapes of the letters are not altered.  The design of the alphabet fosters these natural connections, as each Quikscript letter either begins or ends on the base line or the upper parallel.  This structure permits letters to connect easily yet maintains the shapes of the individual letters because there are no connecting strokes between letters as there are in cursive Roman alphabet writing. It is common that Senior writing will have several letters in a row which are connected to each other, but when such a connection is not possible, the letters are simply left unconnected.  Read added a very small number of alternative letter forms, which permit even more letters to connect easily.  It is the writer's choice whether to use them or not.\n* Senior Quikscript also introduces the concept of half-letters.  Read recognized that the top half of several tall letters and the bottom half of several deep letters clearly distinguish those letters.  Therefore, the portion of the vertical shafts of those letters which lie between the base line and upper parallel can be discarded without legibility being affected.  Using half-letters increases the number of letters which can connect with each other.  This produces several benefits:  1) it speeds up handwriting because fewer pen-lifts are required;  2) the alphabet takes on a more cursive and fluid appearance, which is artistically attractive; and 3) most importantly, it increases the variability of the word-shapes.  Fluent readers do not sound out words letter by letter.  They recognize a familiar word-shape without conscious thought of the individual letters.  Anything that increases the distinctiveness of the word-shapes should promote the legibility of the script and the average reading speed.  The use of Quikscript's half-letters creates more varied and distinctive word-shapes than Junior Quikscript, which may make reading fluency in Quikscript easier to achieve and ultimately lead to faster reading speeds.  If this proves to be true in actual usage, then it should encourage the use of Senior Quikscript in printed texts rather than Junior Quikscript.\n* Senior Quikscript also introduces a number of abbreviations for the most common English words, which writers may choose to use. These further reduce the space requirement for printed material and hence the costs.\n\n==Modern day use==\nQuikscript computer fonts have been developed so that the alphabet can be used with computers and the Internet. There is also a computer program which will transliterate Latin alphabet text into Quikscript text.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==References in literature==\nBook two of the popular ''Cole's Funny Picture Books'', published in [[Australia]] by [[Edward William Cole|E. W. Cole]] at the turn of the 20th century, was revised in 1979 to include an article introducing Quikscript under the name Second Shaw.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://quikscript.neocities.org/quik.htm Quikscript Outpost]\n* [https://groups.yahoo.com/group/Read_Alphabet/ Read Alphabet Yahoo group] (Registration required)\n* [http://www.omniglot.com/writing/quikscript.htm Quikscript page (which also includes the PDF of the original manual) at Omniglot.com]\n* [http://sourceforge.net/projects/web-qs/ World English Bible in Quikscript] &ndash; a work in progress to transcribe the [[World English Bible]].\n\n[[Category:English spelling reform]]\n[[Category:Alphabets]]"

The Scandinavian variants are also known as ''futhark'' or ''fuþark'' (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: ''[[Feoh|F]]'', ''[[Ur (rune)|U]]'', ''[[Thurisaz|Þ]]'', ''[[Ansuz (rune)|A]]'', ''[[Raido|R]]'', and ''[[Kaunan|K]]''); the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] variant is ''[[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]'' or ''{{lang|ang|fuþorc}}'' (due to sound-changes undergone in [[Old English]] by the names of those six letters).\n\n[[Runology]] is the study of the runic alphabets, [[runic inscriptions]], [[runestones]], and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] as the cultures that had used runes underwent [[Christianisation]], by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in [[northern Europe]]. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural [[Sweden]] for decorative purposes in [[Dalarna]] and on [[Runic calendar]]s.\n\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the [[Elder Futhark]] (around 150–800 AD), the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]] (400–1100 AD), and the [[Younger Futhark]] (800–1100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called ''Danish'', although they were also used in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Frisia]]); short-branch or [[Rök Runestone|Rök runes]] (also called ''Swedish-Norwegian'', although they were also used in [[Denmark]]); and the ''{{lang|sv|stavlösa}}'' or Hälsinge runes ([[staveless runes]]). The Younger Futhark developed further into the [[Medieval runes]] (1100–1500 AD), and the [[Dalecarlian runes]] ({{circa}} 1500–1800 AD).\n\nHistorically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the [[Old Italic script]]s of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic family in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]], [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], or [[History of the Latin alphabet|Old Latin]] as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for [[epigraphy]], which would become characteristic of the runes.\n\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via [[Irminones|Elbe Germanic]] groups, while a \"[[Goths|Gothic]] hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic [[Chernyakhov culture|expansion]].\n\n==History and use==\n[[Image:Rökstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[Rök Runestone]] in Sweden]]\n[[Image:Vaksalastenen.jpg|thumb|A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century [[Vaksala Runestone]] in Sweden]]\nThe runes were in use among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] from the 1st or 2nd century AD.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of [[Vimose]], [[Funen]], [[Denmark]].{{Sfn | Stoklund | 2003 | p  = 173}} The inscription reads {{lang|de|harja}}; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the [[Meldorf fibula]] in southern [[Jutland]].}}  This period corresponds to the late [[Common Germanic]] stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]].\n\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] and the [[Gothic alphabet]] as variants of ''p''; see {{lang|ang|[[peorð]]}}.)\n\nThe term ''runes'' is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek ''letters''. It is attested on a 6th-century [[Alamanni]]c runestaff as {{lang|goh|runa}} and possibly as {{lang|goh|runo}} on the 4th-century [[Einang stone]]. The name comes from the Germanic root {{lang|gem|run-}} ({{lang-got|𐍂𐌿𐌽𐌰}}, {{lang|got-Latn|runa}}), meaning \"secret\" or \"whisper\". In [[Old Irish|Old Irish Gaelic]], the word {{lang|sga|rún}} means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"intention\" or \"affectionate love.\" Similarly in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Old English]], the word {{lang|cy|rhin}} and {{lang|ang|rūn}} respectively means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"secret writing\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \"miracle\" ({{lang|cy|gwyrth}}). [[Ogham]] is a Celtic script, similarly carved in the Norse manner. The root {{lang|bat|run-}} can also be found in the [[Baltic languages]], meaning \"speech\". In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], {{lang|lt|runoti}} means both \"to cut (with a knife)\" and \"to speak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lkz.lt/en/dze.htm |title=Dictionary of the Lithuanian Language |publisher=LKZ |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}</ref> According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|reuə-}}'' \"dig\".<ref>Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache.

The historical context of the script's origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[Roman auxiliaries|Roman army]], and the Italian peninsula during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]] (1st century BC to 5th century AD).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the [[Kylver Stone]] being the first evidence of the ''futhark'' ordering as well as of the ''p'' rune.\n\n[[Image:Venetic Raetic Camunic Lepontic alphabets.png|thumb|upright 1.3|The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magrè and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic)]]\nSpecifically, the [[Old Italic script#Raetic alphabets|Raetic alphabet]] of [[Bolzano]] is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ({{runic |ᛖ}} ''e'', {{runic |ᛇ}} ''ï'', {{runic |ᛃ}} ''j'', {{runic|ᛜ}} ''ŋ'', {{runic|ᛈ}} ''p'') having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.{{Sfn | Mees | 2000}} Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the [[Latin alphabet]] itself over Raetic candidates.{{Sfn | Odenstedt | 1990}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1996}}<ref>{{Citation |url=http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |type=under preparation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623082749/http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |archivedate=2007-06-23 }}.</ref> A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the [[Negau helmet]] dating to the 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Markey|2001}} This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, {{Lang|gem|Harigast}}.

There are no ''horizontal'' strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the [[Latin alphabet]] used for the [[Duenos inscription]], but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is ''written'' rather than carved runes, such as {{lang|la|[[Codex Runicus]]}}) also show horizontal strokes.\n\nThe \"[[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by [[West Germanic tribes]]. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around [[Jutland]] (the [[Vimose inscriptions]]), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars to be [[Proto-Norse]], are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as {{lang|gem|wagnija}}, {{lang|gem|niþijo}}, and {{lang|gem|harija}} are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be [[Vangiones]], the [[Nidensis]], and the [[Harii]] tribes located in the [[Rhineland]].{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} Since names ending in {{lang|gem|-io}} reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending {{lang|la|-ius}}, and the suffix {{lang|la|-inius}} was reflected by Germanic {{lang|gem|-inio-}},{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1968 |pp=135, 392ff }}{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1966–1967 | p = 207}} the question of the problematic ending {{lang|gem|-ijo}} in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of {{lang|gem|laguþewa}}{{Sfn | Syrett | 1994 | pp= 44ff}} may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a [[Northwest Germanic]] unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | {{Harvnb | Penzl | Hall | 1994a}} assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the [[Gallehus horns]] inscription.{{Sfn | Penzl | Hall | 1994b |p=186}}}}{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 | p=36}}}} An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by È. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic [[koine]]\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 |p=36}}\n\nIn 2017, based on a correlation between the [[graphemes]] observed in situ on the [[Rock Drawings in Valcamonica|Camunian petroglyphs]], and on the genetic study of the [[haplogroup]] of descendants of the Camunian transalpine civilization, E. de Vaugüé shows that the runes and the [[Phoenician alphabet]] have a common origin with the older [[Camunic language| Camunian alphabet]], dated 1000 years BC by the torinese anthropologist Giovanni Marro, founder of the Ethnological Museum of [[Turin]], close to the Etruscan alphabet and the Lepontes and Rhaetian alphabets (themselves derived from the Etruscan system). This would be explained by a migration, about 4,500 years ago, of populations of the [[Unetice culture]], themselves probably coming from, as demonstrated by genetic studies, the [[Yamna culture|Yamna]] riders of the steppes also called [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]]<ref> Élisa de Vaugüé, ''La Civilisation Camunienne, une Civilisation européenne, disparue et oubliée...

This Camunian system, according to the study of its graphemes, would itself derive its origins from the 32 symbols found in European caves for 30,000 years by the Canadian paleo-anthropologist Genevieve Von Petzinger, who could be a proto-language, and a [[Neanderthal|neandertalian]] proto-alphabet<ref>\nThe First Signs: Unlocking the Mysteries of the World's Oldest Symbols, Genevieve von Petzinger[https://www.amazon.fr/First-Signs-Unlocking-Mysteries-Symbols/dp/147678549X]</ref>.\n\n===Early inscriptions===\n[[File:Pietroassa ring 1875.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ring of Pietroassa]] ({{circa|250–400 AD}}) by Henri Trenk, 1875]]\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150–550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in [[Elder Futhark]], but the set of letter shapes and [[bindrune]]s employed is far from standardized. Notably the ''[[jēran|j]]'', ''[[sowilo rune|s]]'', and ''[[ᛜ|ŋ]]'' runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as ''[[ᛈ|p]]'' and ''[[ᛇ|ï]]'', remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the [[Kylver Stone]] ({{circa}} 400 AD).\n\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sjælland, Jylland (Denmark), and Skåne (Sweden). Earlier—but less reliable—artifacts have been found in [[Meldorf]], Süderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the [[Meldorf fibula]], and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nTheories of the existence of separate [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the [[spearhead of Kovel]], with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped [[tiwaz rune|tiwaz]], and its rectangular [[dagaz]]). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the [[Alcuin]] manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century [[Ring of Pietroassa]].\n\nThe ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.<ref>{{Citation |quote=A likely theory is that the runic alphabet was developed by the Goths, a Germanic people, from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy and was perhaps also influenced by the Latin alphabet in the 1st or 2nd century BC |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512796/runic-alphabet |contribution=Runic alphabet|title-link=Encyclopædia Britannica }}.</ref>\n\n===Magical or divinatory use===\n[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#G 205|G 205]]) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}} with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a [[swastika]], a common motif on bracteates]]\n[[File:Gummarpstenen.gif|thumb|An illustration of the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500–700 AD) from [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n[[File:Björketorpsstenen runor.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century [[Björketorp Runestone]] located in [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n{{Main|Runic magic}}\nThe stanza 157 of {{lang|non|[[Hávamál]]}} attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life. In this stanza, [[Odin]] recounts a spell:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Þat kann ek it tolfta,\nef ek sé á tré uppi\nváfa virgilná,:\nsvá ek ríst ok í rúnum fák,\nat sá gengr gumi\nok mælir við mik.<ref name=\"Hávamál\">{{Citation |url=http://www.heimskringla.no/original/edda/havamal.php |archive-url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20070508160024/http://www.heimskringla.no/original/edda/havamal.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-08 |contribution=Hávamál |title=Norrøne Tekster og Kvad |place=Norway |postscript=. }}</ref>\n|I know a twelfth one\nif I see up in a tree,\na dangling corpse in a noose,\nI can so carve and colour the runes,\nthat the man walks\nand talks with me.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=37}}\n}}\nThe earliest runic inscriptions found on artifacts give the name of either the craftsman or the proprietor, or sometimes, remain a linguistic mystery. Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for [[divination]], there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name ''rune'' itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century [[Björketorp Runestone]] warns in [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] using the word ''rune'' in both senses:\n{{Quote |{{lang|non|Haidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz. Arageu haeramalausz uti az. Weladaude, sa'z þat barutz. Uþarba spa.}}\n\nI, master of the runes(?) conceal here runes of power.

I prophesy destruction / prophecy of destruction.<ref name=\"RUNDATADR360\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=DR 360 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref>}}\n\nThe same curse and use of the word, rune, is also found on the [[Stentoften Runestone]]. There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the [[Franks Casket]] (AD 700) panel.\n\nCharm words, such as {{lang|non|auja}}, {{lang|non|laþu}}, {{lang|non|laukaʀ}}, and most commonly, {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}},{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=100–01}} appear on a number of [[Migration period]] Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as {{lang|non|salusalu}} and {{lang|non|luwatuwa}}. Further, an inscription on the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500–700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.{{Sfn|Page|2005 |p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although [[Old Norse language|Norse]] literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: [[Tacitus]]'s 1st-century {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]}}, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s 13th-century {{lang|non|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}, and [[Rimbert]]'s 9th-century {{lang|la|[[Vita Ansgari]]}}.\n\nThe first source, Tacitus's {{lang|la|Germania}}, describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings.  A second source is the {{lang|non|Ynglinga saga}}, where [[Granmar]], the king of {{lang|sv|[[Södermanland]]|italic=no}}, goes to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] for the {{lang|non|[[blót]]|italic=no}}. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long ({{lang|non|Féll honum þá svo spánn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa}}). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a {{lang|non|blótspánn}} (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013 }}\n\nThe third source is Rimbert's {{lang|la|Vita Ansgari}}, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, [[Anund Uppsale]], first brings a Danish fleet to [[Birka]], but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking [[Birka]] would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a {{lang|non|hlautlein}} (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970|p=401}} would be used in the same manner as a {{lang|non|blótspánn}}.\n\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\n\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013}} but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\n===Medieval use===\n[[Image:CodexRunicus.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Codex Runicus]], a [[vellum]] manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the [[Scanian Law]], is written entirely in runes.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs [[Proto-Germanic]] evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent [[diphthong]]s unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect.\n\nNevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = McDermott\n|first1      = Larissa\n|year        = 2016\n|title       = Runes\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=8h08DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=%22Elder+Futhark+contains+a+total+of%22\n|publisher   = [[Lulu.com|Lulu Press]]\n|page        = 70\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9781365130724\n}}</ref> The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From {{circa}} 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language.\n\nSome later runic finds are on monuments ([[runestone]]s), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the [[Bryggen inscriptions]], were found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = William\n|first1      = Gareth\n|year        = 2007\n|title       = West over Sea: Studies in Scandinavian Sea-Borne Expansion and Settlement Before 1300\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=U-2vCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473&dq=%22rune-inscribed+sticks+from+bryggen%22\n|publisher   = [[Brill Publishers]]\n|page        = 473\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9789047421214\n}}</ref> These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature—ranging from name tags, prayers (often in [[Latin]]), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n[[File:BM-ClogAlmanac.JPG|right|thumb|17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the [[runic calendar|clog almanacs]] (sometimes called ''Runic staff'', ''Prim'', or ''Scandinavian calendar'') of Sweden and [[Estonia]]. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\n===Runes in Eddic lore===\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin ({{lang-non|reginkunnr}}). This is attested as early as on the [[Noleby Runestone]] from {{circa|600 AD}} that reads {{lang|non|Runo fahi raginakundo toj[e'k]a...}}, meaning \"I prepare the suitable divine rune...\"<ref name=\"RUNDATAVG63\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 63 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> and in an attestation from the 9th century on the [[Sparlösa Runestone]], which reads {{lang|non|Ok rað runaʀ þaʀ rægi[n]kundu}}, meaning \"And interpret the runes of divine origin\".<ref name=\"RUNDATVG119\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 119 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> In the [[Poetic Edda]] poem {{lang|non|[[Hávamál]]}}, Stanza 80, the runes also are described as {{lang|non|reginkunnr}}:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Þat er þá reynt,\ner þú að rúnum spyrr\ninum reginkunnum,\nþeim er gerðu ginnregin\nok fáði fimbulþulr,\nþá hefir hann bazt, ef hann þegir.<ref name=\"Hávamál\"/>\n|\nThat is now proved,\nwhat you asked of the runes,\nof the potent famous ones,\nwhich the great gods made,\nand the mighty sage stained,\nthat it is best for him if he stays silent.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=25}}\n}}\n\nThe poem {{lang|non|Hávamál}} explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, [[Odin]]. Stanza 138 describes how Odin received the runes through self-sacrifice:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Veit ek at ek hekk vindga meiði a\nnetr allar nío,\ngeiri vndaþr ok gefinn Oðni,\nsialfr sialfom mer,\na þeim meiþi, er mangi veit, hvers hann af rótom renn.\n|\nI know that I hung on a windy tree\n[[numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,\nwounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,\nmyself to myself,\non that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=34}}\n}}\n\nIn stanza 139, Odin continues:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Við hleifi mik seldo ne viþ hornigi,\nnysta ek niþr,\nnam ek vp rvnar,\nopandi nam,\nfell ek aptr þaðan.\n|\nNo bread did they give me nor a [[drinking horn|drink from a horn]],\ndownwards I peered;\nI took up the runes,\nscreaming I took them,\nthen I fell back from there.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=34}}\n}}\n\nThis passage has been interpreted as a mythical representation of shamanic initial rituals in which the initiate must undergo a physical trial in order to receive mystic wisdom.<ref>{{Citation |last=Seigfried |first=Karl E.H. |date=Mar 2010 |contribution-url=http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-three.html |contribution=Odin & the Runes, Part Three |url=http://www.norsemyth.org/ |title=The Norse Mythology }}.</ref>\n\nIn the Poetic Edda poem {{lang|non|[[Rígsþula]]}} another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans. The poem relates how {{lang|non|[[Ríg (Norse god)|Ríg]]|italic=no}}, identified as {{lang|non|[[Heimdall]]|italic=no}} in the introduction, sired three sons — {{lang|non|[[Thrall]]|italic=no}} (slave), {{lang|non|[[Churl]]|italic=no}} (freeman), and {{lang|non|[[Earl|Jarl]]|italic=no}} (noble) — by human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, {{lang|non|Ríg|italic=no}} returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop {{lang|non|[[Olaus Magnus]]|italic=no}} recorded a tradition that a man named {{lang|non|[[Kettil Runske]]|italic=no}} had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\n==Runic alphabets==\n\n=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===\n[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] found on [[Jutland]], now Denmark]]\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing [[Proto-Norse]], consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an [[Norse clans#Runology|Ætt]].

One theory proposes that it was developed in [[Frisia]] and later spread to [[England]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the [[Thames scramasax]], in the [[Vienna Codex (Anglo-Saxon)|Vienna Codex]], in [[Cotton Otho]] B.x ([[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]]) and on the [[Ruthwell Cross]].\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: {{runic|ᚠ}} feoh, {{runic|ᚢ}} ur, {{runic |ᚦ}} thorn, {{runic |ᚩ}} os, {{runic |ᚱ}} rad, {{runic|ᚳ}} cen, {{runic|ᚷ}} gyfu, {{runic |ᚹ}} wynn, {{runic |ᚻ}} haegl, {{runic|ᚾ}} nyd, {{runic |ᛁ}} is, {{runic |ᛄ}} ger, {{runic |ᛇ}} eoh, {{runic |ᛈ}} peordh, {{runic |ᛉ}} eolh, {{runic|ᛋ}} sigel, {{runic|ᛏ}} tir, {{runic|ᛒ}} beorc, {{runic|ᛖ}} eh, {{runic |ᛗ}} mann, {{runic |ᛚ}} lagu, {{runic |ᛝ}} ing, {{runic |ᛟ}} ethel, {{runic|ᛞ}} daeg, {{runic |ᚪ}} ac, {{runic|ᚫ}} aesc, {{runic|ᚣ}} yr, {{runic|ᛡ}} ior, {{runic|ᛠ}} ear.\n\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include {{runic|ᛢ}} cweorth, {{runic |ᛣ}} calc, {{runic |ᚸ}} gar, and {{runic|ᛥ}} stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in [[Pseudo-runes|manuscripts]]. Feoh, þorn, and sigel stood for [f], [þ], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [ð], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters [[yogh]] and [[wynn]], which became [g] and [w] in [[Middle English]].\n\n===\"Marcomannic runes\" (8th to 9th centuries)===\n[[Image:Marcomannic.PNG|thumb| 310px|[[Marcomanni]]c runes]]\nA runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called ''De Inventione Litterarum'', ascribed to [[Hrabanus Maurus]] and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]] ([[Alemannia]], [[Bavaria]]). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the ''Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus'', and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the [[Marcomanni]], and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\n\n[[Wilhelm Grimm]] discussed these runes in 1821.<ref>{{Citation | last = Grimm | first = William | year = 1821 | author-link = Wilhelm Grimm | title = Ueber deutsche Runen |trans-title=Concerning German runes | language = German | chapter = 18 | pages = 149–59}}.</ref>\n\n===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Younger Futhark}}\n[[Image:Yngre futharken.svg|thumb|280px|The [[Younger Futhark]]: long-branch runes and short-twig runes]]\n[[Image:Sigurd.svg|left|thumb|While also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century [[Sigurd stones#Sö 101|Ramsung carving]] is a [[Sigurd stones|Sigurd stone]] that depicts the legend of [[Sigurd]].]]\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the [[Elder Futhark]], consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when [[Proto-Norse]] evolved into [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. They are found in Scandinavia and [[Viking Age]] settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\n===Medieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Medieval runes}}\n[[Image:Medeltida runor.svg|410px|right|thumb|[[Medieval runes]] ]]\n[[Image:Saleby kyrkklocka, Västergötland.png|left|thumb|A church bell from Saleby, [[Västergötland]], Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the [[Old Norse language]]. Dotted variants of [[voiceless]] signs were introduced to denote the corresponding [[voiced]] consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as ''s'', ''c'', and ''z'' often were used interchangeably.{{Sfn | Jacobsen | Moltke | 1942 | p = vii}}{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 20}}\n\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in [[Bergen (Norway)|Bergen]] since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called [[Bryggen inscriptions]]). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin.\n\n===Dalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries)===\n{{Main article|Dalecarlian runes}}\n[[Image:Dalrunor.svg|410px|thumb|[[Dalecarlian runes]] ]]\nAccording to Carl-Gustav Werner, \"In the isolated province of [[Dalarna]] in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.\"{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 7}}  The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brix |first=Lise |title=Isolated people in Sweden only stopped using runes 100 years ago |date=May 21, 2015 |url=http://sciencenordic.com/isolated-people-sweden-only-stopped-using-runes-100-years-ago |work=ScienceNordic}}</ref> Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing [[Elfdalian]].\n\n==Academic study==\n{{Main article |Runology}}\nThe modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by [[Johannes Bureus]] (1568–1652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] sense.\nThe study of runes was continued by [[Olof Rudbeck|Olof Rudbeck Sr]] (1630–1702) and presented in his collection ''Atlantica''. [[Anders Celsius]] (1701–1744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the ''runstenar'' ([[runestone]]s).  From the  \"golden age of [[philology]]\" in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\n==Body of inscriptions==\n{{Main article |Runic inscriptions}}\n[[Image:Kam-med-runer-fra-Vimose DO-4148 2000.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vimose inscriptions|Vimose Comb]] from the island of [[Funen]], Denmark, features the earliest known runic inscription (AD 150 to 200) and simply reads, ᚺᚨᚱᛃᚨ \"Harja\", a male name.<ref>{{cite book | last= Looijenga |first= Tineke | title = Texts and Contexts of the Oldest Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year = 2003 | page = 160 |isbn= 978-90-04-12396-0}}</ref>]]\nThe largest group of surviving Runic inscription are [[Viking Age]] [[Younger Futhark]] runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = de Gruyter\n|first1      = Walter\n|year        = 2002\n|title       = The Nordic Languages, Volume 1\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=PBKxhq2p0PgC&pg=PA700&dq=%22Younger+Futhark+were+used+more%22\n|publisher   = \n|page        = 700\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9783110197051\n}}</ref> Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], more than 650 in total. [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on [[bracteate]]s. [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main article|Modern runic writing}}\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century [[Viking revival]], in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]] ([[Gothicismus]]) and [[Germanic occultism]] in the 19th century, and in the context of the [[Fantasy]] genre and of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] in the 20th century.\n\n===Esotericism===\n\n==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism ====\n{{Further|Runosophy|Armanen runes|Wiligut runes|Runengymnastik}}\n[[File:EBay 025.jpg|thumb|Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in [[Parkend]], [[England]] ]]\n[[Image:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|thumb|180px|From 1933, [[Schutzstaffel unit insignia]] displayed two [[Sig Rune]]s]]\nThe pioneer of the ''[[Armanist]]'' branch of [[Ariosophy]] and one of the more important figures in [[esotericism in Germany and Austria]] in the late 19th and early 20th century was the [[Austria]]n occultist, mysticist, and [[völkisch]] author, [[Guido von List]]. In 1908, he published in ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"[[Armanen runes]]\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902.\nThe use of runes in [[Germanic mysticism]], notably List's \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"[[Wiligut runes]]\" by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], played a certain role in [[Nazi symbolism]]. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to [[Heinrich Himmler]], and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the [[SS-Ehrenring]], which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".\n\n====Modern neopaganism and esotericism====\nRunes are popular in [[Germanic neopaganism]], and to a lesser extent in other forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[New Age]] esotericism. Various systems of [[Runic divination]] have been published since the 1980s, notably by [[Ralph Blum]] (1982), [[Stephen Flowers]] (1984, onward), [[Stephan Grundy]] (1990), and [[Nigel Pennick]] (1995).\n\nThe [[Uthark theory]] originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by [[Sigurd Agrell]] in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist [[Thomas Karlsson]] popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\nThe [[Bluetooth]] logo is the combination of two runes of the [[Younger Futhark]], [[Haglaz]] and [[Berkanan]], equivalent to the letters «H» and «B», that are the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Blåtand's]] name (''bluetooth'' in English), who was a king of Denmark from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]].\n[[File:Bluetooth logo.png|thumb|224x224px|[[Bluetooth]] logo with the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Blåtand]].]]\n\n===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction===\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a [[List of Middle-earth objects#Thrór's map|map]] to emphasize its connection to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]. They also were used in the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but later were replaced by the [[Cirth]] rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, [[Khuzdul]].  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in [[fantasy literature]], but also in other forms of media such as [[video games]] (for example the 1992 video game ''[[Heimdall (video game)|Heimdall]]'' used it as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces).\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main article|Runic (Unicode block)}}\n[[File:Runen Schlagstempel.jpg|thumb|Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark]]\nRunic alphabets were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe [[Unicode block]] for Runic alphabets is U+16A0–U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the [[Elder Futhark]], the [[Anglo-Frisian runes]], and the [[Younger Futhark]] long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"[[Universal Character Set characters|unification]]\".\n\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0–U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB {{runic|᛫}}, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC {{runic|᛬}} and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED {{runic|᛭}}), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern [[runic calendar]] staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic [[Arlaug]] Symbol U+16EE {{runic|ᛮ}}, Runic [[Tvimadur]] Symbol U+16EF {{runic|ᛯ}}, Runic [[Belgthor]] Symbol U+16F0 {{runic|ᛰ}}). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \"cryptogrammic\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the [[Franks Casket]].\n\n{{Unicode chart Runic}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bergakker inscription|Runic inscription in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Pentimal system]] of numerals\n* [[Runic magic]]\n* [[Runiform (disambiguation)]] for unrelated scripts sometimes described as \"runes\" or \"rune-like\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group = \"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin |2}}\n* {{Citation | first = Elmer H. | last = Antonsen | title = On Defining Stages in Prehistoric Germanic | journal = Language | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 19–36 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.2307/411849 | jstor = 411849 }}.<!--\n* {{Citation | editor1-last = Bammesberger | editor1-first = A | editor2-first = G | editor2-last = Waxenberger | title = Das fuþark und Seine Einzelsprachlichen Weiterentwicklungen | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2006 | isbn = 3-11-019008-7}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Blum | first = Ralph | year = 1932 | title = The Book of Runes – A Handbook for the use of Ancient Oracle: The Viking Runes | series = Oracle Books | publisher = St. Martin's Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-312-00729-9}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Erik Brate| last = Brate | first = Erik | year = 1922 | title = Sveriges Runinskrifter | url = http://www.runor.se/ | language = Swedish}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Düwel | first = Klaus | year = 2001 | title = Runenkunde | publisher = JB Metzler | language = German}}. -->\n* {{Citation | last1 = Foote | first1 = P.

      "text": "[[File:Silchester ogham.jpg|thumb|The Silchester stone illustrated in 1894, shortly after its discovery]]\nThe '''Silchester [[Ogham]] stone''' is a pillar stone discovered in [[Silchester]], [[Hampshire]] during excavations in 1893. Thus far it remains the only one of its kind found in England, and the only ogham inscription in England east of [[Cornwall]] and [[Devon]].\n\n==Background==\n\nThe pillar stone was found upside down some five to six feet beneath the surface, apparently at the bottom of a former well. A white metal or pewter vessel \"of peculiar form\" lay underneath, crushed by it. Further investigation revealed an [[ogham]] inscription upon the pillar. According to Amanda Clarke and [[Michael Fulford]] of the [[University of Reading]],\n\n{{quote|The significance of the find as an isolated example of ogham some distance from the main British distribution in Devon and Cornwall and west of the River Severn was certainly appreciated at the time of the discovery. The stone and its inscription were reported on separately from the account of the excavation itself by Sir [[John Rhys]] in the year of the discovery. His reading, EBICATO[S]/[MAQ]I MUCO[I--], 'of Ebicatus, son of the tribe of', has been accepted up to now.<ref name = \"xxx\">[https://www.reading.ac.uk/silchester/i3/victorians/vic_ogham.php Silchester Roman Town - The Insula IX Town Life Project The Victorian Excavations of 1893]</ref>}}\n\nRhys noted that the sandstone marker was \"rudely carved into what seems to me to be a phallic form\", though the upper part was broken off and missing. What was left \"may be described as the frustum of a cone, below which the stone narrows greatly, then widens into a moulded base.\" The inscription is in two lines beginning at the widest part of the frustum at its base.<ref>\"Excavations on the site of the Roman city of Silchester, Hants in 1893\", ''Archaeologia'' 54, January 1894, 199 - 238</ref>\n\n==Dating==\n[[File:Britain.Deisi.Laigin.jpg|thumb|Map of Irish migration to Britain]]\nThe pewter vessel, when reconstructed, turned out to be \"a simple, biconical flagon similar to a few other examples found in southern Britain which can be dated broadly to the fourth and no earlier than the late third century.\"<ref name = \"xxx\"/> The most recent version of the translation on the stone is \"[The something] of Tebicatus, son of the tribe of N”. The missing word may be \"memorial\" or, less probably, \"land\", if the stone were a territorial marker rather than a grave marker. J. A. Baird argues that both archaeological and linguistic evidence suggest that the stone belongs to \"the earliest phases of the ogham script\", which emerges with contact between late Roman Latin and Old Irish.<ref name = \"bai\">Baird, J. A., \"Dura Dererta: The Death and Afterlife of Dura Europos\", in ''Vrbes Extinctae: Archaeologies of Abandoned Classical Towns'', Ashgate, 2012, p.340.</ref>\n\nOn the basis of existing evidence, Reading University says that the \"inscription has been interpreted as an epitaph and it has been variously dated to the fifth and sixth centuries\".<ref name = \"xxx\"/> Baird says that it \"could well date to the late fourth or fifth century\". This would make it \"one of the earliest ogham stones anywhere.\"<ref name = \"bai\"/>\n\n==Significance==\nThe inscription was created during [[Sub-Roman Britain]], a period of intense cross-cultural contact between Britain and Ireland at the time of the Anglo-Saxon invasions. Most ogham inscriptions are present in the British strongholds of Cornwall, Devon and Wales. The Silchester inscription is in Hampshire — east of Devon — and is presumed to be the work of Irish settlers occupying land further east than other known Irish migrants. The tradition of the expulsion of the [[Déisi]] and their migration from Ireland may be related to this pattern of settlement and British-Irish cultural integration.<ref>Meyer, Kuno (Ed.)

The musical arrangement was attributed to [[Louis Le Maire]] (sometimes Lemaire), an 18th-century composer. This was \"Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1835, by C.

Many songs have been written to teach phonemic awareness and they are usually referred to as alphabet songs.\n\n== Acrostic songs ==\nThere are also songs that go through the alphabet, making some of the letters stand for something in the process. An example, ''[[A, You're Adorable]]'' (also known as \"The Alphabet Love Song\"), was recorded in 1948, by [[Buddy Kaye]], [[Fred Wise (lyricist)|Fred Wise]], [[Sidney Lippman]], and later [[Perry Como]].\n\nA newer example of this is from the musical ''[[Matilda the Musical|Matilda]]''. \"School Song\" is an acrostic that spells out the alphabet phonetically.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/school-song-lyrics-matilda-london-cast.html|title=Matilda London Cast - School Song Lyrics {{!}} MetroLyrics|website=www.metrolyrics.com|access-date=2016-12-19}}</ref>\n\n== Backwards song (Verse 2) ==\nThe group [[Wee Sing]] released an alphabet song with the letters in reverse order, called \"ZYXs\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe Canadian children's TV series ''[[The Big Comfy Couch]]'' used a version of the song in the first episode of Season 4, \"Backwards\".<ref>{{Citation|last=FilmRise|title=The Big Comfy Couch - Season 4 Ep 1 - \"Backwards\"|date=2014-01-31|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we13hA-oEgI|accessdate=2017-01-18}}</ref>\n\nComedian [[Soupy Sales]] released a song in 1966 called \"Backwards Alphabet\" which contained the reverse alphabet in lyrical style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Soupy+Sales/_/The+Backwards+Alphabet|title=Soupy Sales — The Backwards Alphabet — Listen, watch, download and discover music for free at Last.fm|website=Last.fm}}</ref> The original version of the song was performed by actress Judi Rolin with the [[Smothers Brothers]] in the 1966 teleplay adaptation of ''Alice Through the Looking Glass''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64sqQTqi-Z0|title=Alice through the Looking Glass: \"Backwards Alphabet\"|first=|last=storyjan|date=13 July 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n=== Related English language songs ===\n*\"[[List of songs from Sesame Street|ABC–DEF–GHI]]\", an alphabet song sung by Big Bird of ''[[Sesame Street]]''\n* \"ABC Kids\", an alternate song sung by [[The Wiggles]] who promoted ''[[ABC Kids (Australia)|ABC for Kids]]'' (2006)\n* \"Al'z A-B-Cee'z\", an alphabet song by hip hop group [[3rd Bass]], on their album ''[[Derelicts of Dialect]]'' (1991)\n* \"Crazy ABCs\", an alphabet rap song that combines pronunciation and phonetics for each letter by Every Child Wins<ref>{{cite web|url=http://everychildwins.com/music/ekag-1/abcs/|title=Listen (Educational & Funny) Kids Songs for Ages 0-5|date=18 March 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n* \"Crazy ABC's\", an acrostic song listing words beginning with each letter used as a [[silent letter]], by the [[Barenaked Ladies]] on their album ''[[Snacktime!]]'' (2008)\n* \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", a show tune from ''The Sound of Music'' (1959), used to teach the order of the notes in the Solfege scale\n* \"[[Swinging the Alphabet]]\", a phonetically based novelty song, popularized by The Three Stooges in the film ''[[Violent Is the Word for Curly]]'' (1938)\n* \"ZYX\", a backwards alphabet song by [[They Might Be Giants]], on their second children's album ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]'' (2005)\n*\"[[The Elements (song)|The Elements]]\", a [[mnemonic]] song of the periodic table by Tom Lehrer (1959)\n*\"A.B.C.

Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press</ref> In the 1965 dictionary, signs are themselves arranged alphabetically, according to their Stokoe transcription, rather than being ordered by their English [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] as in other sign-language dictionaries. This made it the only ASL dictionary where the reader could look up a sign without first knowing how to translate it into English. The Stokoe notation was later adapted to [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) in Kyle et al. (1985) and to [[Australian Aboriginal sign languages]] in Kendon (1988). In each case the researchers modified the alphabet to accommodate phonemes not found in ASL.\n\nThe Stokoe notation is mostly restricted to linguists and academics. The notation is arranged linearly on the page and can be written with a typewriter that has the proper font installed. Unlike [[SignWriting]] or the [[Hamburg Notation System]], it is based on the [[Latin alphabet]] and is [[phoneme|phonemic]], being restricted to the symbols needed to meet the requirements of ASL (or extended to BSL, etc.) rather than accommodating all possible signs. For example, there is a single symbol for circling movement, regardless of whether the plane of the movement is horizontal or vertical.\n\n==Writing direction==\n\nStokoe notation is written horizontally left to right like the Latin alphabet (plus limited vertical stacking of movement symbols, and some diacritical marks written above or below other symbols). This contrasts with [[SignWriting]], which is written vertically from top to bottom (plus partially free two-dimensional placement of components within the writing of a single sign).\n\n==Symbol usage==\n\nStokoe coined the terms ''[[location (sign language)|tab]]'' (\"tabula\" or sign location), ''[[Handshape|dez]]'' (\"designator\" or handshape & orientation), and ''[[movement (sign language)|sig]]'' (\"signification\" or motion & action).  These are used to categorize features of sign-language [[phoneme]]s, somewhat like the distinction between [[consonant]], [[vowel]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] is used in the description of oral languages. A sign is written in the order ''tab-dez-sig:'' TD<sup>s</sup>. Compound signs are separated with a double dashed pipe, approximately TD<sup>s</sup>¦¦TD<sup>s</sup>.\n\nA serious deficiency of the system is that it does not provide for facial expression, [[mouthing]], eye gaze, and body posture, as Stokoe had not worked out their phonemics in ASL.<ref>Kyle & Woll 1988:29</ref> Verbal inflection and non-lexical movement is awkward to notate, and more recent analyses such as those of [[Ted Supalla]] have contradicted Stokoe's set of motion phonemes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} There is also no provision for representing the relationship between signs in their natural context, which restricts the usefulness of the notation to the lexical or dictionary level. Nonetheless, Stokoe demonstrated for the first time that a sign language can be written phonemically just like any other language.\n\nIn the tables below, the first column is a web-based approximation of the Stokoe symbol using the inventory available in [[Unicode]], and the second is an [[ASCII]] substitution for the purpose of citing examples in this article. Proper display of the third column requires the Stokoe font available at the external link below; without that font, you will see the corresponding ASCII character, as used in Mandel (1993).\n\n===''Tab'' (Location)===\n\nThe ''tab'' symbols are a null sign for a neutral location and iconic symbols for parts of the head, arm, and torso. In addition, the ''dez'' (handshape) symbols below may be used to indicate that the location is the passive hand in a specific shape.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Unicode<br>approximation\n!

For example, {{angbr|QB}} represents a flat hand, B, located at the face, Q, and <BB> represents a dominant flat hand B acting on a passive flat hand B. The latter is disambiguated from two B hands acting together by using another letter for the ''tab,'' such as {{angbr|ØBB}} for two B hands acting in neutral space, or {{angbr|QBB}} for both hands at the face.\n\nBesides the shape of the hands, the ''dez'' includes their orientation. This is indicated, when necessary, with subscripts, which are introduced in the next section.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|A||fist (as ASL 'a', 's', or 't')\n|-\n|B||flat hand (as ASL 'b' or '4')\n|-\n|5||spread hand (as ASL '5')\n|-\n|C||cupped hand (as ASL 'c', or more open)\n|-\n|E||claw hand (as ASL 'e', or more clawlike)\n|-\n|F||okay hand (as ASL 'f'; thumb & index touch or cross)\n|-\n|G||pointing hand (as ASL 'g' 'd' or '1')\n|-\n|H||index + middle fingers together (as ASL 'h,' 'n' or 'u')\n|-\n|I||pinkie (as ASL 'i')\n|-\n|K||thumb touches middle finger of V (as ASL 'k' or 'p')\n|-\n|L||angle hand, thumb + index (as ASL 'l')\n|-\n|3||vehicle classifier hand, thumb + index + middle fingers (as ASL '3')\n|-\n|O||tapered hand, fingers curved to touch thumbtip (as ASL 'o')\n|-\n|R||crossed fingers (as ASL 'r')\n|-\n|V||spread index + middle fingers (as ASL 'v' or '2')\n|-\n|W||thumb touches pinkie (as ASL 'w')\n|-\n|X||hook (as ASL 'x')\n|-\n|Y||horns (as ASL 'y', or as index + pinkie)\n|-\n|8||bent middle finger; may touch thumb (as ASL '8', this is a common allophone of Y)\n|}\n\nThere are three diacritics that modify the shape of the ''dez.'' A dot placed above it shows that a finger not normally seen is prominent, usually because it is involved in the production of the sign. For example, {{angbr|Ȧ}} ({{sm|ascii}} 'A) is a fist with the thumb extended, as in {{angbr|UȦᵗ}} {{sm|not}}. Three dots or ticks over a letter shows the fingers are flexed, so that {{angbr|B⃛}} ({{sm|ascii}} ;B) is a flexed flat hand, and {{angbr|V⃛}} (;V) is two flexed fingers. The forearm ''tab'' sign prefixed to the ''dez'' ({{sm|ascii}} j) shows that the forearms are prominent in the production of the sign, as in {{angbr|{{overline|B}}<sub>ɑ</sub> jB<sub>^</sub><sup>ω</sup>}} {{sm|tree}}.\n\n===''Sig'' (movement) and ''dez'' orientation===\n\nThe movement of the hand, or ''sig,'' is written with superscripted letters after the ''dez,'' as D<sup>#</sup> (any ''dez'' D which closes). Multiple movement ''sigs'' are arranged linearly when the movements are sequential, as in TD<sup>×∨×</sup> (any ''dez'' D which touches a ''tab'' T, moves down, and touches again),<sup>1</sup> but stacked one above the other when signed simultaneously, as in TD×ͮ (a ''dez'' which moves down while in contact with the ''tab'').<sup>2</sup>\n\nA dot placed above the ''sig'' indicates that the motion is sharp, as in TD<sup>×̇</sup> (sharp contact by the ''dez'' D),<sup>3</sup> while a dot placed after the ''sig'' indicates that the motion is repeated, as in TD<sup>×·</sup> (repeated contact by the ''dez''; TDx\" in ASCII).\n\nA tilde with a two-hand ''dez,'' TDD<sup>s~</sup>, indicates that first one hand performs the ''sig,'' then the other. Without the tilde, both hands are understood to act together.\n\nA subset of the ''sig'' symbols used for motion are also used to indicate the orientation of the hand. In this use they are subscripted after the ''dez'' instead of superscripted, as in D<sub>#</sub> (any ''dez'' D which starts off closed).<sup>4</sup> Stokoe analyzed the orientation of the hand as part of the ''tab,'' the handshape.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=4|Movement ''(sig)''\n!colspan=4|Orientation ''(dez)''\n|-\n!Unicode!!ASCII!!Stokoe*!!Description\n!Unicode!!ASCII!!Stokoe*!!Description\n|-\n|D<sup>{{IPA|ʌ}}</sup>||D^||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>^</sup></span>|| moving upward\n|D<sub>{{IPA|ʌ}}</sub>||^D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>^</sub></span>|| facing or pointing upward\n|-\n|D<sup>v</sup>||Dv||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>v</sup></span>|| moving downward\n|D<sub>v</sub>||vD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>v</sub></span>|| facing or pointing downward\n|-\n|D<sup>{{IPA|ɴ}}</sup>||Dw||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">Dʳ</span>|| moving up and down\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D<sup><nowiki>></nowiki></sup>||D>||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>></sup></span>|| to the dominant side\n|D<sub><nowiki>></nowiki></sub>||>D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>></sub></span>|| facing the dominant side\n|-\n|D<sup><nowiki><</nowiki></sup>||D<||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup><</sup></span>|| to the center or non-dominant side\n|D<sub><nowiki><</nowiki></sub>||<D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub><</sub></span>|| facing the center or non-dominant side\n|-\n|D<sup>≷</sup>||Dz||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">Dᶻ</span>|| side to side\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D<sup>⊤</sup>||Dt||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">Dᵗ</span>|| toward signer\n|D<sub>⊤</sub>||tD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>t</sub></span>|| facing signer\n|-\n|D<sup>⊥</sup>||Df||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>f</sup></span>|| away from signer\n|D<sub>⊥</sub>||fD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>f</sub></span>|| facing away from signer\n|-\n|Dᶦ||Dm||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>=</sup></span>|| to and fro\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D<sup>{{IPA|ɑ}}</sup>||Da||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>a</sup></span>|| supinate (turn palm up)\n|D<sub>{{IPA|ɑ}}</sub>||aD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>a</sub></span>|| supine (palm facing up)\n|-\n|D<sup>{{IPA|ɒ}}</sup>||Db||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">Dᵇ</span>|| pronate (turn palm down)\n|D<sub>{{IPA|ɒ}}</sub>||bD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>b</sub></span>|| prone (palm facing down)\n|-\n|D<sup>ω</sup>||Dg||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>w</sup></span>|| twist wrist back & forth\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|Dᵑ||Dr||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">Dⁿ</span>|| nod hand, bend wrist\n|D<sub>ŋ</sub>||rD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>n</sub></span>|| bent wrist\n|-\n|D<sup>◽</sup>[D′]||D*[D′]||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>]</sup></span>[D′]|| open up (resulting ''Dez'' D’ shown in brackets)\n|D<sub>◽</sub>||*D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>]</sub></span>|| open\n|-\n|D<sup>#</sup>[D′]||D#[D′]||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>#</sup></span>[D′]|| close (resulting ''Dez'' D’ shown in brackets)\n|D<sub>#</sub>||#D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>#</sub></span>|| closed\n|-\n|D<sup>ᴥ</sup>||De||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>e</sup></span>|| wriggle fingers<br>(symbol looks like a cursive ''e'')\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D<sup>@</sup>||D@||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>@</sup></span>|| circle<br>(symbol is a spiral)\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D⁾⁽||D)(||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>)</sup></span>|| approach, move together\n|D₎₍||)(D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>)</sub></span>|| near\n|-\n|D<sup>×</sup>||Dx||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>x</sup></span>|| contact, touch\n|D<sub>×</sub>||xD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>x</sub></span>|| touching\n|-\n|D<sup>≬</sup>||D$||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>g</sup></span>|| link, grasp\n|D<sub>≬</sub>||$D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>g</sub></span>|| linked\n|-\n|D<sup>‡</sup>||D+||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>+</sup></span>|| cross\n|D<sub>‡</sub>||+D||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>+</sub></span>|| crossed\n|-\n|D<sup>ʘ</sup>||Do||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>o</sup></span>|| enter\n|D<sub>ʘ</sub>||oD||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sub>o</sub></span>|| inside\n|-\n|D<sup>÷</sup>||D%||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>:</sup></span>|| separate\n|colspan=4|—\n|-\n|D<big>{{IPA|ʻʼ}}</big>||D§&nbsp;<small>''or''</small>&nbsp;D&||<span style=\"font-face:Stokoe\">D<sup>(</sup></span>|| exchange positions\n|colspan=4|—\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Proper display requires installation of the Stokoe font available at the external link below.\n:<sup>1</sup> TDx-v-x in ASCII\n:<sup>2</sup> TDxv in ASCII\n:<sup>3</sup> TDx! in ASCII\n:<sup>4</sup> Closing hand and closed hand would be D# and #D in the ASCII system.\n\nSeveral linguists, including, Kyle & Woll, state that Stokoe's ''tab'' conflates two parameters, handshape and orientation, and split off ''ori'' (orientation of the hand) as a fourth parameter. Kendon, however, notes how this greatly complicates the phonological description of signs, and prefers to retain orientation as an aspect of the handshape, with changes of orientation analysed as other changes in the hands, rather than as changes in an independent parameter.\n\n===Relative location===\n\nWhen the ''tab'' is a hand shape, or the ''dez'' consists of two hands, a symbol may be placed between the two letters to indicate their relative position. These include a few of the movement/orientation letters above. In addition, there are symbols to indicate ''position'' above, below, next to, and behind: the underscore on the B in {{nowrap|<u>B</u> L}} shows that the L hand is placed under a B hand, with or without contact, ''etc.''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

It is in the southern Brahmic family of scripts. Due to its script family, it has similarities to the [[Burmese alphabet]], [[Mon alphabet]], and [[Chakma alphabet]].\n\n==Origin==\nThe Tanchangya alphabets were introduced recently in 2012 by adopting a manuscript in Rakhine State as stated by Rupak Debnath.<ref name=mat-2008-167>Rupak-Debnath (2008): 167</ref>\nThough both Chakma and Tanchangya have been using the present Chakma alphabet for a long time, it is still unconfirmed who the alphabets originally belonged to and who introduced it. John M. Clifton in his ‘’Dialects, Orthography and Society ‘’opined that ‘the Tanchangya community decided to base their alphabet on the Chakma  to show they were related to the Chakma. However, they systematically changed the alphabet to show that they were different from the Chakma they were not simply a part of the larger Chakma community.’ <ref>[https://arts-sciences.und.edu/summer-institute-of-linguistics/work-papers/_files/docs/2013-clifton.pdf  Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics], (1988).</ref> Moreover, in order not to cause misunderstanding between two communities, Tanchangya has introduced these alphabets which are yet to develop into Unicode font. For the time being, it is just created as True Font.\n\n==Writing system==\n\nIt is written from left to right, similarly to Brahmi scripts, unlike the Kharosti, which were used to write from right to left. \n[[File:Tanchangya Vowel.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\n\n==Vowels==\nThere are five independent vowels such as A (a:), I(i), v(ʊ), E(e), and O a(oʊ). The other  five vowels are dependent namely, Aa(ɔ) , AA(ʌ), Ii(i:), and  Uu(u:).\n\n[[File: Tanchangya_consonants.jpg|thumb|right|200px]]\n\n==Consonants== \nThere are thirty-one consonants letter found in Tanchangya alphabets. They are classified into group consonants and miscellaneous consonants.\n\n==Arrangement== \nThe alphabets seem to be derived from ancient Brahmic scripts, which inherited the vowel sound within the consonants. If not an independent derivation, it should have derived from Burmese or Mon due to their dwelling with Mon and Burmese from 9th Century B.C (in Tagong the ancient civilisation of Burma {{sfn|Pe Maung Tin|G.H. Luce|2008|p=1}} to until the 15th century Common Era (during the 15th Century, they were attacked by the Rakhine king and brought them to Arakan in 15th Century from Micchagiri, present Thaye in Magwe Division to Arakan) (Dhanyawady Aye Daw Bung, 4).

The Telugu script is also widely used for writing [[Sanskrit]] texts and to some extent the [[Gondi language]]. It gained prominence during the [[Eastern Chalukyas]] also known as Vengi Chalukya era. It shares extensive similarities with the [[Kannada script]], as it has evolved from [[Kadamba script|Kadamba]] and [[Bhattiprolu Script|Bhattiprolu]] scripts of the Brahmi family. Both Adikavi Pampa of Kannada and Adikavi Nannayya of Telugu hail from families native to the Vengi region.\n\n==Derivation from the Brahmi script==\nThe [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi script]] used by [[Mauryan]] kings eventually reached the [[Krishna River]] delta and would give rise to the [[Bhattiprolu Script|Bhattiprolu script]] found on an urn purported to contain Lord [[Buddha]]'s relics.<ref>Antiquity of Telugu language and script: http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/20/stories/2007122054820600.htm</ref><ref>[http://www.buddhavihara.in/ancient.htm Ananda Buddha Vihara<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930085421/http://www.buddhavihara.in/ancient.htm |date=2007-09-30 }}</ref> [[Buddhism]] spread to [[East Asia]] from the nearby ports of [[Ghantasala (town)|Ghantasala]] and [[Masulipatnam]] (ancient Maisolos of [[Ptolemy]] and Masalia of [[Periplus]]).<ref>[http://www.wuys.com/news/Article_Show.asp?ArticleID=8303 The Great Stupa at Nagarjunakonda in Southern India-【佛学研究网】 佛教文化网 中国佛教网 中国佛学网 佛教信息网 佛教研究 佛学讲座 禅学讲座 吴言生说禅<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Bhattiprolu Brahmi script evolved to become the Telugu script by 5th century C.E.<ref>The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems by Florian Coulmas, p. 228</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Murthy|first1=K.N.|last2=Rao|first2=G.U.|title=4.5 Telugu Script|url=http://www.tdil.meity.gov.in/pdf/Vishwabharat/5/4.5.pdf}}</ref><ref>Indiain Epigraphy: a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages, by Richard Solomon, Oxford University Press, 1998, p.40, {{ISBN|0-19-509984-2}}</ref><ref>Indian Epigraphy by Dineschandra Sircar, Motilal Banarsidass, 1996, p.46, {{ISBN|81-208-1166-6}}</ref><ref>The Dravidian Languages\n by Bhadriraju Krishnamurti, 2003, Cambridge University Press, pp.78-79, {{ISBN|0-521-77111-0}}</ref><ref>Comparative Dravidian linguistics: Current perspectives by Bhadriraju Krishnamurti.

The diacritic form is added to consonants (represented by the dotted circle) to form a consonant-vowel syllable (example: ka, kru, mo). అ does not have a diacritic form, because this vowel is already inherent in all of the consonants. The other diacritic vowels are added to consonants to change their pronunciation to that of the vowel.\n\nExamples:\n{| style=\"background:transparent;\"\n| style=\"font-size:18pt;\" | ఖ + ఈ (ీ) → ఖీ || {{IPA|/kʰa/}} + {{IPA|/iː/}} → {{IPA|/kʰiː/}}</tr>\n\n| style=\"font-size:18pt;\" | జ + ఉ (ు) → జు || {{IPA|/dʒa/}} + {{IPA|/u/}} → {{IPA|/dʒu/}}</tr>\n|}\n\n==Consonants==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n!

R. R. Tolkien]]. \nWithin the fictional context of [[Tolkien's legendarium]], the tengwar were invented by the [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]] [[Fëanor]], and used first to write the Elven tongues [[Quenya]] and [[Telerin]]. Later a great number of [[languages of Middle-earth]] were written using the tengwar, including [[Sindarin]]. Tolkien used tengwar to write [[English language|English]]: most of Tolkien's tengwar samples are actually in English.\n\n== Fictional history and terminology ==\nAccording to ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'' (Appendix D to ''Quendi and Eldar''), Fëanor, when he created his script, introduced a change in terminology. He called a letter, i.e. a written representation of a spoken phoneme (''tengwë'') a  ''tengwa''. Previously, any letter or symbol had been called a ''sarat'' (from ''*sar'' \"incise\"). The alphabet of [[Rúmil]] of [[Tirion]], on which Fëanor supposedly based his own work, was known as [[Sarati]]. It later became known as \"Tengwar of Rúmil\".\n\nThe plural of ''tengwa'' was ''tengwar'', and this is the name by which Fëanor's system became known. Since, however, in commonly used modes, an individual ''tengwa'' was equivalent to a consonant, the term ''tengwar'' in popular use became equivalent to \"consonant sign\", and the vowel signs were known as ''ómatehtar''. By loan-translation, the tengwar became known as ''tîw'' (singular ''têw'') in Sindarin, when they were introduced to [[Beleriand]]. The letters of the earlier alphabet native to Sindarin were called ''[[cirth]]'' (singular ''certh'', probably from ''*kirte'' \"cutting\", and thus semantically analogous to Quenya ''sarat''). This term was loaned into exilic Quenya as ''certa'', plural ''certar''.\n\n==Nonfictional history==\n\n===Precursors===\nThe [[sarati]], a script developed by Tolkien in the late 1910s and described in ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]] 13'', anticipates many features of the tengwar: vowel representation by [[diacritic]]s (which is found in many tengwar varieties); different tengwar shapes; and a few correspondences between sound features and letter shape features (though inconsistent).\n\nEven closer to the tengwar is the Valmaric script, described in ''Parma Eldalamberon 14'', which Tolkien used from about 1922 to 1925. It features many tengwar shapes, the inherent vowel {{IPA|[a]}} found in some tengwar varieties, and the tables in the samples V12 and V13 show an arrangement that is very similar to one of the primary tengwar in the classical Quenya \"mode\".\n\n[[Jim Allan (author)|Jim Allan]] (''An Introduction to Elvish'', {{ISBN|0-905220-10-2}}) compared the tengwar with the ''Universal Alphabet'' of [[Francis Lodwick]] of 1686, both on grounds of the correspondence between shape features and sound features, and of the actual letter shapes.\n\n===Tengwar===\n[[Image:One Ring inscription.svg|thumb|300px|The inscription on the [[One Ring]], written in the [[Black Speech]] of [[Mordor]] using tengwar]]\n\nThe tengwar were probably developed in the late 1920s or in the early 1930s. ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', the first published Tengwar sample, dates to 1937 (''[[The Hobbit]]'', most editions with colour plates). The full explanation of the tengwar was published in Appendix E of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1955.\n\nThe ''Mellonath [[Daeron]] Index of Tengwar Specimina'' (DTS) lists most of the known samples of tengwar by Tolkien.\n\nThere are only a few known samples predating publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'' (many of them published posthumously):\n\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS1 DTS 1]&nbsp;– ''The Lonely Mountain Jar Inscription'', published 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS13 DTS 13]&nbsp;– ''Middle Page from the Book of Mazarbul''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS14 DTS 14]&nbsp;– ''Last Page from the Book of Mazarbul, Last Line'', this and the above one originally prepared for inclusion in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS15 DTS 15]&nbsp;– ''Steinborg Drawing Title''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS22 DTS 22]&nbsp;– ''Ilbereth's Greeting'' from [[The Father Christmas Letters]], dating to 1937\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS24 DTS 24]&nbsp;– ''The Treebeard Page''\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS50 DTS 50]/[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS51 51]&nbsp;– ''Edwin Lowdham's Manuscript'' from [[The Notion Club Papers]] has [[Old English language]] text written in tengwar (with a few [[Adûnaic]] and Quenya words), dating to 1945/6.\n*[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS10 DTS 10]&nbsp;– The Brogan Tengwa-greetings, appearing in ''[[The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', No. 118, tentatively dated to 1948.\n*The following samples presumably predate the Lord of the Rings, but they were not explicitly dated: [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS16 DTS 16], [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS17 DTS 17], [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS18 DTS 18]&nbsp;– ''Elvish Script Sample I, II, III'', with parts of the English poems ''Errantry'' and ''Bombadil'', first published in the ''Silmarillion Calendar 1978'', later in ''[[Pictures by J. R. R. Tolkien]]'', as well as [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/mdtci.html#DTS23 DTS 23]&nbsp;– ''So Lúthien'', a page of the English ''Lay of Leithian'' text facsimiled in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'':299.\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:Tengwar alphabet1.png|thumb|200px|The tengwar table, with the name of each ''tengwa''.]]\n\n=== Letters ===\nThe most notable characteristic of the tengwar script is that the shapes of the letters correspond to the [[distinctive feature]]s of the sounds they represent. The Quenya consonant system has five [[place of articulation|places of articulation]]: [[Labial consonant|labial]], [[Dental consonant|dental]], [[Palatal consonant|palatal]], [[Velar consonant|velar]], and [[glottal consonant|glottal]]. The velars distinguish between plain and labialized (that is, articulated with rounded lips, or followed by a {{IPA|[w]}} sound). Each point of articulation, and the corresponding tengwa series, has a name in the classical Quenya mode. Dental sounds are called  ''Tincotéma'' and are represented with the tengwar in column I. Labial sounds are called ''Parmatéma'', and represented by the column II tengwar; velar sounds are called ''Calmatéma'', represented by column III; and labialized velar sounds are called ''Quessetéma'', represented by the ''tengwar'' of column IV. Palatal sounds are called ''Tyelpetéma'' and have no tengwa series of their own, but are represented by column III letters with an added diacritic for following {{IPA|[j]}}.\n\nSimilarly shaped letters reflect not only similar places of articulation, but also similar manners of articulation. In the classical Quenya mode, row 1 represents voiceless stops, row 2 voiced prenasalized stops, row 3 voiceless fricatives, row 4 voiceless prenasalized stops, row 5 nasal stops, and row 6 approximants.<ref>The Complete Tolkien Companion, Third Edition.  Tyler, J.E.A.  New York: St. Martins, 2004.</ref>\n\n====Regularly formed letters====\nMost letters are constructed by a combination of two basic shapes: a vertical '''stem''' (either long or short) and either one or two rounded '''bows''' (which may or may not be underscored, and may be on the left or right of the stem).\n\nThese principal letters are divided into four series (\"témar\") that correspond to the main places of articulation and into six grades (\"tyeller\") that correspond to the main [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]. Both vary among modes.\n\nEach series is headed by the basic signs composed of a vertical stem descending below the line, and a single bow. These basic signs represent the [[phonation|voice]]less [[stop consonant]]s for that series. For the classical Quenya mode, they are {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}}, and the series are named ''tincotéma'', ''parmatéma'', ''calmatéma'', and ''quessetéma'', respectively; téma means \"series\" in Quenya.\n\nIn rows of the ''general use'', there are the following correspondences between letter shapes and manners of articulation:\n* Doubling the bow turns the [[phonation|voiceless consonant]] into a voiced one.\n* Raising the stem above the line turns it into the corresponding [[fricative consonant|fricative]].\n* Shortening it (so it is only the height of the bow) creates the corresponding [[nasal consonant|nasal]]. In most modes, the signs with shortened stem and single bow do not correspond to the [[phonation|voiceless]] nasals, but to the [[approximant]]s.\n\nIn addition to these variations of the tengwar shapes, there is yet another variation, the use of stems that are extended both above and below the line. This shape may correspond to other consonant variations required. Except for some English abbreviations, it is not used in any of the better known tengwar modes, but it occurs in a [[Qenya]] <!--sic--> mode where the tengwa Parma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/pt/}} and the tengwa Calma with extended stem is used for {{IPA|/kt/}}.<ref>See [[Parma Eldalamberon]] 19 (2010), pp. 41–43.</ref> The tengwar with raised stems sometimes occur in [[glyph]] variants that look like extended stems, as seen in the inscription of the [[One Ring]].\n\nHere is an example from the ''parmatéma'' (the signs with a closed bow on the right side) in the \"general use\" of the tengwar:\n[[Image:Parmatéma.png|right|60px]]\n* The basic sign, named ''parma'', (with descending stem) represents {{IPA|/p/}} (it happens to look much like the Latin letter ''P'').\n* With the bow doubled, ''umbar'', it represents {{IPA|/b/}}.\n* With a raised stem, ''formen'', it represents {{IPA|/f/}}.\n* With a raised stem and a doubled bow, ''ampa'', it represents generally {{IPA|/v/}} but possibly {{IPA|/mp/}} (depending upon the language).\n* With a short stem and double bow, ''{{not a typo|malta}}'', it represents {{IPA|/m/}}.\n* With short stem and single bow, ''vala'', it represents {{IPA|/w/}}, or {{IPA|/v/}} if that has the phonological behaviour of a sonorant (as e.g. in Quenya).\n\nIn some languages such as Quenya, which do not contain any voiced fricatives other than \"v\", the raised stem + doubled bow row is used for the very common nasal+stop sequences (''nt'', ''mp'', ''nk'', ''nqu''). In such cases, the \"w\" sign in the previous paragraph is used for \"v\". In the mode of Beleriand, found on the door to [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]], the bottom ''tyellë'' is used for nasals (e.g., ''vala'' is used for {{IPA|/m/}}) and the fifth ''tyellë'' for doubled nasals (''{{not a typo|malta}}'' for {{IPA|/mm/}}).\n\n====Irregularly formed letters====\nThere are additional letters that do not have regular shapes. They may represent, e.g., {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/h/}}. Their use varies considerably from mode to mode. Some aficionados have added more letters not found in Tolkien's writings for use in their modes.\n\n===Tehtar===\n[[File:Tehtar.png|thumb|Tehtar]]\nA ''tehta'' (Quenya \"marking\") is a [[diacritic]] placed above or below the tengwa. They can represent vowels, consonant doubling, or nasal sound.\n\nAs Tolkien explained in the ''ROTK'' appendix, the ''tehtar'' for vowels resemble Latin diacritics: circumflex (î) {{IPA|/a/}}, acute (í) {{IPA|/e/}}, dot (i) {{IPA|/i/}}, left curl (ı̔) {{IPA|/o/}}, and right curl (ı̓) {{IPA|/u/}}. Long vowels, excepting {{IPA|/a/}}, may be indicated by doubling the signs. Some languages from which {{IPA|/o/}} is absent or in which compared to {{IPA|/u/}} it appears sparsely, such as the [[Black Speech]], use left curl for {{IPA|/u/}}; other languages swap the signs for {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}.\n\nA vowel occurring alone is drawn on the vowel carrier, which resembles [[dotless i]] (ı) for a short vowel or dotless j (ȷ) for a long vowel.\n\n== Modes ==\n[[File:Tengwar modi2 EN.svg|thumb|Three modes of tengwar<br>''Yellow: Classical mode''<br>''Pink: Mode of Beleriand''<br>''Grey: General mode'']]\nJust as with any [[alphabet]]ic writing system, every specific language written in tengwar requires a specific [[orthography]], depending on the [[phonology]] of that language. These tengwar orthographies are usually called ''modes''. Some modes follow pronunciation, while others follow traditional orthography.\n\nSome modes map the basic consonants to {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/kʷ/}} (classical mode in chart at right), while others use them to represent {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} (general mode at right).\n\n===Ómatehtar===\nIn some modes, called ''ómatehtar'' (or ''vowel tehtar'') modes, the vowels are represented with [[diacritic]]s called ''tehtar'' (Quenya for 'signs'; corresponding [[Grammatical number|singular]]: ''tehta'', 'sign'). These ómatehtar modes can be loosely considered [[abjad]]s rather than true [[alphabet]]s. In some ómatehtar modes, the consonant signs feature an inherent vowel. These ómatehtar modes can be considered [[abugida|alphasyllabaries]].\n\n''Ómatehtar'' modes can vary in that the vowel stroke can be placed either on top of the consonant preceding it, as in [[Quenya]], or on the consonant following, as in [[Sindarin]], English, and the notorious Black Speech inscription on the One Ring. The other main difference is in the fourth ''tyellë'' below, where those letters with raised stems and doubled bows can be either voiced fricatives, as in Sindarin (general mode at right), or nasalized stops, as in Quenya (classical mode).\n\n===Full writing===\nIn the ''full writing'' modes, the consonants and the vowels are represented by Tengwar. Only one such mode is well known. It is called the \"mode of [[Beleriand]]\" and one can read it on the [[Moria (Middle-earth)#West-door|Doors of Durin]].\n\n===Modes for various languages===\nSince the publication of the first official description of the Tengwar at the end of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', others have created modes for other languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[German language|German]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Welsh (language)|Welsh]]. Modes have also been devised for other [[constructed language]]s; [[Esperanto]] and [[Lojban]].\n\nTolkien has used multiple modes for English, including full writing and ómatehtar alphabetic modes, phonetic full modes and phonetic ómatehtar modes known from documents published after his death.<references group=. />\n\n== Encoding schemes ==\n\n===Legacy encoding===\nThe contemporary [[de facto]] standard in the tengwar user community maps the tengwar characters onto the [[ISO 8859-1]] character encoding following the example of the tengwar typefaces by Dan Smith. This implies a major flaw: If no corresponding tengwar font is installed, a [[mojibake|string of nonsense characters]] appears.\n\nSince there are not enough places in ISO 8859-1's 191 codepoints for all the signs used in tengwar orthography, certain signs are included in a \"tengwar A\" font which also maps its characters on ISO 8859-1, overlapping with the first font.\n\nFor each tengwar diacritic, there are four different codepoints that are used depending on the width of the character which bears it.\n\nOther tengwar typefaces with this encoding include [http://www.dafont.com/tengwar-annatar.font Johan Winge's Tengwar Annatar], [http://at.mansbjorkman.net/parmaite.htm Måns Björkman's Tengwar Parmaitë], [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027083304/http://geocities.com/enrombell/eng_dir/Index.htm  Enrique Mombello's Tengwar Élfica] or [https://web.archive.org/web/20061023195729/http://tengwarformal.limes.com.pl/ Michal Nowakowski's Tengwar Formal] (note that most of these differ in details).\n\nThe following sample shows the first article of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] written in English, according to the traditional [[English orthography]]. It should look similar to the picture at the [[#top|top of the page]], but if no tengwar font is installed, it will appear as a jumble of characters because the corresponding ISO 8859-1 characters will appear instead.\n\n<blockquote style=\"font-family: 'Tengwar Annatar', 'Tengwar Eldamar', 'Tengwar Noldor', 'Tengwar Parmaite', 'Tengwar Formal', 'Tengwar Elfica', 'Tengwar Sindarin', 'Tengwar Quenya', 'Tengwar Gothika'; font-size: 150%; line-height: 150%\">\nj#¸ 9t&5# w`Vb%_ 6EO w6Y5 e7`V`V 2{( zèVj# 5% 2x%51T`Û 2{( 7v%1+- 4hR 7EO 2{$yYO2 y4% 7]F85^ 2{( z5^8I`B5$I( 2{( dyYj2 zE1 1yY6E2_ 5^( 5#4^(7 5% `C 8q7T1T W w74^(692^H -- </blockquote>\nNote: Some browsers may not display these characters properly.\n\n===Unicode===\n\nA proposal has been made by [[Michael Everson]] to include the tengwar in the [[Unicode]] standard.

It is the best-deciphered variant, due to the discovery of several Numidian bilingual inscriptions in Libyan and Punic (notably at [[Dougga]] in Tunisia). 22 letters out of the 24 were deciphered.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n==== Western Libyc or Moorish ====\nThe western variant covers [[Morocco]] and the western half of [[Algeria]] (country populated by the [[Mauri people|Mauri]]), as well as the [[Canary Islands]]. It is more archaic and shows no Phoenician influence (Février 1964&ndash;1965). Its inscriptions are fewer and generally shorter and rougher. The characteristic of this alphabet is that it includes additional signs, approximately 13, that the Eastern one is unaware of, whose value could not be given. Some of these characters are identical to the Touareg letters of the alphabet.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Bu Njem Libyc or Libyan ====\nThere are graffiti discovered at Bou Njem, the antique Gholaia  in [[Libya]], on the wall of an old monument which dated from the 3rd century. The writing is horizontal, made up of nine inscriptions. This variant was heavily influenced by Latin to the point of constituting a special alphabet.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Saharan Libyc or Garamantian ====\nThis variant was widespread in pre-saharan and saharan Libya, territory of the [[Gaetuli]] and [[Garamantes]], where it was used by the inhabitants to engrave their messages. It is mostly unknown and badly located.<ref name=\":1\" /> The ancient '''Tifinagh''' script was a pure [[abjad]]; it had no vowels. [[Gemination]] was not marked. The writing was usually from the bottom to the top, although right-to-left, and even other orders, were also found.

[[Gemination]], though phonemic, is not indicated in Tifinagh. The letter ''t'', +, is often combined with a preceding letter to form a [[typographic ligature|ligature]]. Most of the letters have more than one common form, including mirror-images of the forms shown here.\n\nWhen the letters ''l'' and ''n'' are adjacent to themselves or to each other, the second is offset, either by inclining, lowering, raising, or shortening it.  For example, since the letter ''l'' is a double line, <code>'''||'''</code>, and ''n'' a single line, <code>'''|'''</code>, the sequence ''nn'' may be written <code>'''|''|'''''</code> to differentiate it from ''l''.  Similarly, ''ln'' is <code>'''||''|'''''</code>, ''nl'' <code>'''|''||'''''</code>, ''ll'' <code>'''||''||'''''</code>, ''nnn'' <code>'''|''|''|'''</code>, etc.\n\nTraditionally, the Tifinagh script does not indicate vowels except word-finally, where a single dot stands for any vowel. In some areas, Arabic vowel diacritics are combined with Tifinagh letters to transcribe vowels, or ''y, w'' may be used for long ''ī'' and ''ū''.\n\n==Neo-Tifinagh==\n{{Infobox Writing system\n|name=Neo-Tifinagh\n|time=1980 to present\n|type=[[Alphabet]]\n|languages=[[Standard Moroccan Berber]] and other [[Northern Berber languages]]\n|fam1= [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]\n|fam2=[[Proto-Sinaitic script]]\n|fam3=[[Phoenician alphabet]]\n|fam4=Libyco-Berber\n|fam5=Tifinagh\n|unicode=[https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2D30.pdf U+2D30&ndash;U+2D7F]\n|iso15924=Tfng\n|sample=Amz-plake province Tiznite.JPG\n}}\n[[File:Tifinagh_writing.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tifinagh_writing.JPG|thumb|Neo-Tifinagh, Arabic and French at a store in Morocco]]\nNeo-Tifinagh is the modern fully [[alphabet]]ic script developed from earlier forms of Tifinagh. It is written left to right.\n\nUntil recently, virtually no books or websites were published in this alphabet, with activists favouring the Latin (or, more rarely, Arabic) scripts for serious use; however, it is extremely popular for symbolic use, with many books and websites written in a different script featuring logos or title pages using Neo-Tifinagh.\n\nIn Morocco, use of Neo-Tifinagh was suppressed until recently. The Moroccan state arrested and imprisoned people using this script during the 1980s and 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazighworld.org/studies/articles/rapport_sur_calvaire_ecriture_tifinaghe_maroc.php|title=Rapport sur le calvaire de l'écriture en Tifinagh au Maroc|publisher=Amazighworld.org|accessdate=2017-10-09}}</ref> In 2003, however, the king took a \"neutral\" position between the claims of [[Latin script]] and [[Arabic script]] by adopting Neo-Tifinagh; as a result, books are beginning to be published in this script, and it is taught in some schools. However, many independent Berber-language publications are still published using the Berber Latin alphabet. Outside Morocco, it has no official status.\n\nIn Algeria, almost all Berber publications use the Berber Latin Alphabet. The [[Black Spring (Algeria)|Algerian Black Spring]] was partly caused by the repression of [[Berber languages]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nIn Libya, the government of [[Muammar Gaddafi]] consistently banned Tifinagh from being used in public contexts such as store displays and banners.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tawalt.com/?p=14122|script-title=ar:سلطات الامن الليبية تمنع نشر الملصق الرسمي لمهرجان الزي التقليدي بكباو|language=Arabic|trans-title=Libyan security authorities to prevent the publication of the official poster for the festival traditional costume Pkpau|publisher=TAWALT|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Libyan Civil War (2011)|Libyan Civil War]], the [[National Transitional Council]] has shown an openness towards the Berber languages.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-handed_manual_alphabets",
      "text": "Several [[manual alphabet]]s in use around the world employ two hands to represent some or all of the letters of an [[alphabet]], usually as a part of a deaf [[sign language]]. Two-handed alphabets are less widespread than [[one-handed manual alphabet]]s. They may be used to represent the [[Latin alphabet]] (for example in the manual alphabet used in [[Turkish Sign Language]]) or the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] (as is sometimes used in [[Yugoslav Sign Language]]).\n\n== BANZSL alphabet ==\nThis alphabet is used in the [[BANZSL]] group of sign languages. It has been used in [[British Sign Language]] and [[Auslan]] since at least the 19th century, and in [[New Zealand Sign Language]] since the 1970s. Variations of this alphabet are also used in [[dialect]]s of [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]].\n\n[[File:Bimanual alphabet.jpg|thumb|This chart shows the BANZSL alphabet.]]\n\n=== Notes ===\n* Signs may be made with the left or right hand as the dominant hand, but the roles do not usually switch when [[fingerspelling]]. The dominant hand generally acts as a pointer (or \"pen\") while the secondary hand acts as \"paper\".\n* The vowels A, E, I, O and U are formed by touching each digit respectively, starting with the thumb.\n* The letters C, D, J, K, P, Q, T, V, X, and Y make the shape of the letter itself.\n* The letters B, F, G, L, M, N, R, S, and W suggest the shape of the letter.\n* The letters G, L and R suggest only the lowercase form of the letter.\n* Only the letters H and Z do not have a strong relation to their shape or position in the alphabet.\n* Many letters appear backwards (for example, in right-handed fingerspelling, R and D often appears backwards to the viewer). This is not a mistake or a problem, and your signing does not need to be adjusted to compensate.\n\n{{anchor|Deafblind alphabet}}\n\n== BANZSL deafblind alphabet==\nThis is a variation on the above alphabet, modified for [[Touch|tactile]] use by those communicating with people who are [[Deafblindness|deafblind]].\n\nThe sender holds the [[wrist]] of the receiver. The receiver's hand is relaxed, with the [[Hand#Human anatomy|palm]] open and fingers slightly apart. The signer uses their dominant hand like a pen to sign on the non-dominant hand of the receiver. As a beginner, you may squeeze the wrist of the receiver between words since you will spell haltingly. Once you can spell fluently, simply put a short pause between words. AEIOU are the pads of each finger, beginning with the [[thumb]].\n\n;A: BANZSL \"A\" is signed on the tip of the thumb\n;B: The fingers and thumb are held together to form half of the BANZSL \"B\" and placed on the palm\n;C: Draw your finger along the edge of the thumb and up the index finger, alternatively the direction of the sweep can be reversed\n;D: The signer forms half of the BANZSL \"D\" with their dominant hand and places it against the recessive hand of the receiver; an alternative is to use the index and middle finger placed against the recessive hand\n[[File:Two-hand manual.ogv|right]]\n;E: BANZSL \"E\" is signed on the tip of the index finger\n;F: Half of the BANZSL \"F\" is signed either on the palm or on the top of the receiver's [[index finger]]\n;G: Half of the BANZSL \"G\" is signed on the palm\n;H: BANZSL \"H\" is signed across the palm\n;I: BANZSL \"I\" is signed on the tip of the [[middle finger]]\n;J: BANZSL \"J\" is signed on the hand of the receiver\n;K: Half of the BANZSL \"K\" is signed on the first [[knuckle]] of the index finger\n;L: BANZSL \"L\" is signed on the palm\n;M: BANZSL \"M\" is signed on the palm\n;N: BANZSL \"N\" is signed on the palm\n;O: BANZSL \"O\" is signed on the tip of the [[ring finger]]\n;P: Pinch the pad and nail of the index finger (P for pinch)\n;Q: Hook your curled index finger around the thumb\n;R: BANZSL \"R\" is signed on the palm\n;S: Hook your curled index finger around the [[little finger]]\n;T: BANZSL \"T\" is signed on the receiver's hand\n;U: BANZSL \"U\" is signed on the tip of the little finger\n;V: BANZSL \"V\" is signed on the palm\n;W: There are three ways to do this; all are acceptable, but your receiver might not know them all.\n::Interlace your fingers with theirs\n::Grab all their fingers from the side (if your hand is folded over, their index finger lies across the first knuckles of your hand)\n::Grab their fingers from the top (if your hand is folded over, their fingertips lie across the first knuckles of your hand)\n;X: Half of the BANZSL \"X\" is signed on the index finger\n;Y: The index finger is used to sign a BANZSL \"Y\" on the hand of the receiver\n;Z: The side of the palm is placed on the palm of the receiver\n\n== Other deafblind alphabets ==\n\nFrom [http://www.deafblindinformation.org.au/about-deafblindness/deafblind-communication/deafblind-manual-alphabet \"Deafblind Manual Alphabet\"], on Deafblind Information, Senses Australia (links added): \n\n:\"Variations of this alphabet {{sic| hide=y|is}} used in some dialects of [[Indo-Pakistani Sign Language]].\n:&nbsp;\n:\"Other forms of manual deafblind alphabet are used around the world - eg. The Lorm Deafblind Manual Alphabet (Belgium).<ref name=Lorm>[http://www.deafblind.com/lorm.html The Lorm Deafblind Manual Alphabet]</ref>  In some countries, eg. Sweden, the one-handed alphabet used is modified by applying the shape of the letter into the hand of the person who is deafblind at a different angle, making the shape easier to feel.\"\n\n== Turkish manual alphabet ==\n{{Empty section|date=June 2008}}\n<!-- See Talk page, § Turkish manual alphabet  -->\n{{Google books|xtMxBwAAQBAJ|Current Directions in Turkish Sign Language Research|page=72}}\n\n\n\n== Yugoslav manual alphabet ==\n{{main|Yugoslav manual alphabet}}\nSome signs are modeled after letters of the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]], others after [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]], or stem from other sources.

He copied the inventory of the [[Arabic script]], so the system was not ideal for Zaghawa.\n\nIn 2000, a Zaghawa veterinarian named Siddick Adam Issa adapted Tajir's script to a form which has proven popular in the Zaghawa community. The typography is somewhat innovative in that capital letters have [[descender]]s which drop ''below'' the baseline of the lower-case letters and punctuation, contrasting with the capital letters which rise above most lower-case letters in the Latin alphabet. ''Beria Giray Erfe'' is a full alphabet, with independent letters for vowels; however, [[diacritic]]s are used to mark tone ([[grave accent]] for [[falling tone]] and [[acute accent]] for [[rising tone]]; high, mid, and low tone are unmarked), as well as [[advanced tongue root]] vowels (a [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] derives {{IPA|/i e ə o u/}} from the letters for {{IPA|/ɪ ɛ a ɔ ʊ/}}).\n\nThe letter for {{IPA|/p/}}, which does not occur in Zaghawa or in Arabic, is written by adding a tail to the letter for {{IPA|/b/}}; and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} is derived from the letter for {{IPA|/s/}} with a cross stroke.

It also appears as [[Ancient South Arabian script|South Arabian]] 𐩱, and [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]] ʾÄlef አ.\n\nThese letters are believed to have derived from an [[Egyptian hieroglyph]] depicting an ox's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/521235.stm|title=Oldest alphabet found in Egypt|work=BBC News |date=November 15, 1999}}</ref> The Phoenician variant gave rise to the [[Alpha (letter)|Greek Alpha]] (Α), being re-interpreted to express not the [[glottal consonant]] but the accompanying [[vowel]], and hence the [[A|Latin A]] and [[A (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic А]].\n\nIn [[phonetics]], aleph {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|l|ɛ|f}} originally represented the onset of a vowel at the [[glottis]]. In Semitic languages, this functions as a weak consonant allowing roots with only two true consonants to be conjugated in the manner of a standard three consonant Semitic root. In most Hebrew dialects as well as Syriac, the glottal onset represented by Aleph is an absence of a true consonant although a [[glottal stop]] ({{IPAblink|ʔ}}), which is a true consonant, typically occurs as an allophone. In Arabic, the Alif has the glottal stop pronunciation when occurring initially. In text with diacritical marks, the pronunciation as a glottal stop is usually indicated by a special marking, [[hamza]] in Arabic and [[mappiq]] in Tiberian Hebrew. (Although once thought to be the original pronunciation of Aleph in all cases where it behaves as a consonant, a consistent glottal stop appears to have been absent in ancient Semitic languages such as Akkadian and Ugaritic besides being absent in Syriac and Hebrew.) Occasionally, the Aleph was also used to indicate an initial unstressed vowel before certain consonant clusters, without functioning as a consonant itself, the ''[[Prothesis (linguistics)|prosthetic (or prothetic)]] aleph''. In later Semitic languages, Aleph could sometimes function as a ''[[mater lectionis]]'' indicating the presence of a vowel elsewhere (usually long). The period at which use as a mater lectionis began is the subject of some controversy, though it had become well established by the late stage of Old Aramaic (ca. 200 BCE). Aleph is often [[transliteration|transliterated]] as {{unichar|02BE}}, based on the Greek ''[[spiritus lenis]]'' {{lang|grc|ʼ}}, for example, in the transliteration of the letter name itself, ''{{transl|sem|ʾāleph}}''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andersen|first1=F.I.|last2=Freedman|first2=D.N.|title=Studies in Hebrew and Aramaic Orthography|date=1992|publisher=Eisenbrauns|location=Winona Lake, Indiana|pages=79–90|chapter=Aleph as a vowel in Old Aramaic}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe name ''aleph'' is derived from the West Semitic word for \"[[ox]]\", and the shape of the letter derives from a [[Proto-Sinaitic]] glyph that may have been based on an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] <hiero> F1 </hiero>, which depicts an ox's head.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.dictionary.com/e/a/|title=Meet The Animal That Inspired The Letter A|work=Everything After Z |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Together with Hebrew Aleph, Greek [[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]] and Latin [[A]], it is descended from [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] {{transl|sem|ʾāleph}}, from a reconstructed Proto-Canaanite ''{{transl|sem|ʾalp}}'' \"ox\".\n\nAlif is written in one of the following ways depending on its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ا}}\n\n===Arabic variants===\n====Alif with hamza: {{big|أ}} and {{big|إ}}====\n{{Main|Hamza}}\n{{anchor|hamzat qaṭ‘|hamzat qaṭ`|hamzat qaṭ}}\nThe Arabic letter was used to render either a long {{IPA|/aː/}} or a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}}. That led to [[orthographical]] confusion and to the introduction of the additional letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat qaṭ‘}}'' <big>{{lang|ar|ﺀ}}</big>. [[Hamzah|Hamza]] is not considered a full letter in Arabic orthography: in most cases, it appears on a carrier, either a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'' (<big>{{lang|ar|ؤ}}</big>), a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' (<big>{{lang|ar|ئ}}</big>), or an alif. The choice of carrier depends on complicated orthographic rules. Alif <big>{{lang|ar|إ أ}}</big> is generally the carrier if the only adjacent vowel is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}''. It is the only possible carrier if hamza is the first phoneme of a word. Where alif acts as a carrier for hamza, hamza is added above the alif, or, for initial alif-''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'', below it and indicates that the letter so modified is indeed a glottal stop, not a long vowel.\n\n{{anchor|hamzat waṣl|hamzat wasl}}\nA second type of hamza, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat waṣl}}'' ({{lang|ar|همزة وصل}}), occurs only as the initial phoneme of the [[Al-|definite article]] and in some related cases. It differs from ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzat qaṭ‘}}'' in that it is elided after a preceding vowel. Again, alif is always the carrier.\n\n====Alif maddah: {{big|آ}}====\n{{anchor|alif maddah|alif madda}}\nThe ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif [[Arabic diacritics#Maddah|maddah]]}}'' is a double alif, expressing both a glottal stop and a long vowel.

Although it looks different from a regular ''alif'', it represents the same sound {{IPA|/aː/}}, often realized as a short vowel. When it is written, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' is indistinguishable from final [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] ''[[Yodh#Perso-Arabic ye|ye]]'' or Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' as it is written in Egypt, Sudan and sometimes elsewhere. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Alif maqsurah}}'' is transliterated as {{transl|ar|ALA|á}} in [[ALA-LC Romanization|ALA-LC]], {{transl|ar|DIN|ā}} in [[DIN 31635]], {{transl|ar|ISO|à}} in ISO 233-2, and {{transl|ar|ISO|ỳ}} in [[ISO 233]].\n\n===Numeral===\nAs a numeral, Alaph/Olaf stands for the number one. With a dot below, it is the number 1,000; with a line above it, Alaph/Olaf will represent 1,000,000. With a line below it is 10,000 and with two dots below it is 10,000,000.\n\n==Aramaic==\n\nThe Aramaic reflex of the letter is conventionally represented with the Hebrew {{lang|he|א}} in typography for convenience, but the actual graphic form varied significantly over the long history and wide geographic extent of the language. Maraqten identifies three different aleph traditions in East Arabian coins, a lapidary Aramaic form that realizes it as a combination of a V-shape and a straight stroke attached to the apex, much like a Latin K; a [[cursive]] Aramaic form he calls the \"elaborated X-form\", essentially the same tradition as the Hebrew [[Linguistic reconstruction|reflex]]; and an extremely cursive form with of two crossed oblique lines, much like a simple Latin X.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maraqten|first=Mohammed|title=Notes on the Aramaic script of some coins from East Arabia|journal=[[Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy]]|year=1996|volume=7|pages=304–315|url=https://www.academia.edu/1556846/Notes_on_the_Aramaic_script_of_some_coins_from_East_Arabia}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It is sometimes silent (word-finally always, word-medially sometimes: {{Hebrew|הוּא}} {{IPA|[hu]}} \"he\", {{Hebrew|רָאשִׁי}} {{IPA|[ʁaˈʃi]}} \"main\", {{Hebrew|רֹאשׁ}} {{IPA|[ʁoʃ]}} \"head\", {{Hebrew|רִאשׁוֹן}} {{IPA|[ʁiˈʃon]}} \"first\"). The pronunciation varies in different [[Jewish ethnic divisions]].\n\nIn [[gematria]], aleph represents the number 1, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 1000 (e.g. {{Hebrew|א'תשנ\"ד}} in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the Hebrew [[Calendar date|date]] 1754, not to be confused with 1754 CE).\n\nAleph, along with [[Ayin]], [[Resh]], and [[Heth (letter)|Heth]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. (However, there are few very rare examples of the [[Masoretes]] adding a dagesh or [[mappiq]] to an Aleph or Resh. The verses of [[the Hebrew Bible]] for which an Aleph with a mappiq or dagesh appears are [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 43:26, [[Leviticus]] 23:17, [[Book of Job|Job]] 33:21 and [[Ezra]] 8:18.)\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, the frequency of the usage of alef, out of all the letters, is 4.94%.\n\nAleph is sometimes used as a [[mater lectionis]] to denote a vowel, usually {{IPA|/a/}}. That use is more common in words of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origin, in foreign names, and some other borrowed words.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" |<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" |<small>Various Print Fonts</small>\n! rowspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br />Hebrew]]</small>\n! rowspan=\"2\" |<small>[[Rashi Script|Rashi<br />Script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>[[Serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced font|Monospaced]]</small> <!-- !! </small> [[Rounded Roman]]</small> -->\n|-\n| width=\"20%\" |<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">א</span>\n| width=\"20%\" |<span style=\"font:29pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">א</span>\n| width=\"20%\" |<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">א</span>\n<!-- |width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'cooper black';\">א</span> -->\n| width=\"20%\" |[[File:Hebrew letter Alef handwriting.svg|18px]]\n| width=\"20%\" |[[File:Hebrew letter Alef Rashi.png|31px]]\n|}\n\n===Rabbinic Judaism===\nAleph is the subject of a [[midrash]] that praises its humility in not demanding to start the Bible. (In [[Hebrew]], the Bible begins with the second letter of the [[alphabet]], [[Bet (letter)|Bet]].) In this folktale, Aleph is rewarded by being allowed to start the [[Ten Commandments]]. (In [[Hebrew]], the first word is {{Hebrew|אָנֹכִי}}, which starts with an aleph.)\n\nIn the [[Sefer Yetzirah]], the [[letter (alphabet)|letter]] aleph is [[king]] over breath, formed air in the universe, temperate in the year, and the [[chest]] in the soul.\n\nAleph is also the first letter of the [[Hebrew]] word ''emet'' ({{Hebrew|אֶמֶת}}), which means ''truth''. In [[Jewish mythology]], it was the letter aleph that was carved into the head of the [[golem]] that ultimately gave it life.\n\nAleph also begins the three words that make up God's mystical name in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[I Am that I Am|I Am who I Am]] (in [[Hebrew]], Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh {{lang|he|אהיה אשר אהיה}}), and aleph is an important part of mystical [[amulet]]s and formulas.\n\nAleph, in [[Jewish mysticism]], represents the oneness of God. The letter can be seen as being composed of an upper yud ([[Yodh]]), a lower yud, and a vav ([[Waw (letter)]]) leaning on a diagonal. The upper yud represents the hidden and ineffable aspects of God while the lower yud represents God's revelation and presence in the world. The vav (\"hook\") connects the two realms.\n\nJewish mysticism relates aleph to the element of air, the Fool (Key 0, value 1) of the major arcana of the tarot deck,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tarotjourney.net/tarot-cards/major-arcana/1-the-magician/|title=Tarot Journey with Leisa ReFalo|work=tarotjourney.net|access-date=2010-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704205215/http://tarotjourney.net/tarot-cards/major-arcana/1-the-magician/|archive-date=2010-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref> and the Scintillating Intelligence (#11) of the path between Kether and Chokmah in the Tree of the Sephiroth.\n\n===Yiddish===\n\nIn [[Yiddish]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinreich|first=Uriel|date=1992|title=College Yiddish|location=New York|publisher=[[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research|page=25–8|author-link=Uriel Weinreich}}</ref> aleph is used for several orthographic purposes in native words, usually with different [[diacritical mark]]s borrowed from Hebrew [[niqqud]]:\n* With no diacritics, aleph is silent; it is written at the beginning of words before vowels spelled with the letter [[Waw (letter)|vov]] or [[yodh|yud]]. For instance, ''oykh'' 'also' is spelled אויך. The [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] וי represents the initial [[diphthong]] [{{IPA|oj}}], but that digraph is not permitted at the beginning of a word in Yiddish orthography, so it is preceded by a silent aleph. Some publications use a silent aleph adjecent to such vowels in the middle of a word as well when necessary to avoid ambiguity.\n* An aleph with the diacritic ''[[patach|pasekh]]'', אַ, represents the vowel {{IPAblink|a}} in standard Yiddish.\n* An aleph with the diacritic ''[[kamatz|komets]]'', אָ, represents the vowel {{IPAblink|ɔ}} in standard Yiddish.\n[[Loanword]]s from Hebrew or Aramaic in Yiddish are spelled as they are in their language of origin.\n\n===Mathematics===\nIn [[set theory]], the Hebrew aleph glyph is used as the symbol to denote the [[aleph number]]s, which represent the [[cardinality]] of infinite sets. This notation was introduced by mathematician [[Georg Cantor]]. In older mathematics books, the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident, partly because a [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]] matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up.<ref>{{citation|mr=0553111 |last1=Swanson |first1=Ellen |first2=Arlene Ann |last2=O'Sean |first3=Antoinette Tingley |last3=Schleyer |title=Mathematics into type.

It is used in word-initial position to mark a word beginning with a vowel, but some words beginning with ''i'' or ''u'' do not need its help, and sometimes, an initial Alap/Olaph is [[elision|elided]]. For example, when the Syriac [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]] {{lang|syc|ܐܵܢܵܐ}} is in [[clitic|enclitic]] positions, it is pronounced ''no/na'' (again west/east), rather than the full form ''eno/ana''. The letter occurs very regularly at the end of words, where it represents the long final vowels ''o/a'' or ''e''. In the middle of the word, the letter represents either a [[glottal stop]] between vowels (but West Syriac pronunciation often makes it a [[palatal approximant]]), a long ''i/e'' (less commonly ''o/a'') or is silent.\n\n== South Arabian/Ge'ez ==\nIn the [[Ancient South Arabian script|Ancient South Arabian alphabet]], 𐩱 appears as the seventeenth letter of the South Arabian abjad.

It is written in one of several ways depending on its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ع}}\n\n===Pronunciation===\nArabic ʿayn is one of the most common letters in Arabic. Depending on the region, it ranges from a [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]] {{IPA|[<s></s>[[ʕ]]]}} to an [[epiglottal consonant|epiglottal]] {{IPA|[<s></s>[[ʢ]]]}}.<ref name=\"SOWL\" /> It is [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]], its unvoiced counterpart being {{lang|ar|[[ح]]}}. Due to its position as the innermost letter to emerge from the throat, [[al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]], who wrote the first Arabic dictionary, actually started writing with {{transl|ar|ʿayn}} as the first letter instead of the eighteenth; he viewed its origins deep down in the throat as a sign that it was the first sound, the essential sound, the voice and a representation of the self.<ref>Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, ''The Mute Immortals Speak: Pre-Islamic Poetry and the Poetics of Ritual'', pg. 178. Cornell Studies in Political Economy. [[Ithaca, New York]]: [[Cornell University Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|9780801427640}}</ref>\n\nIn the Persian language and other languages using the Persian alphabet, it is pronounced as {{IPAslink|ʔ}} (glottal stop), and rarely as {{IPAslink|ʁ}} in some languages.\n\nAs in Hebrew, the letter originally stood for two sounds, {{IPAslink|ʕ}} and {{IPAslink|ʁ}}. When pointing was developed, the sound {{IPAslink|ʁ}} was distinguished with a dot on top (<big>{{lang|ar|غ|rtl=yes}}</big>), to give the letter ''ghayn''. In Maltese, which is written with the Latin alphabet, the digraph [[għ]], called ''ʿajn'', is used to write what was originally the same sound.\n\n==Hebrew Ayin==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br/>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br/>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">ע</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:28pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">ע</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">ע</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Ayin handwriting.svg|26px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Ayin Rashi.png|40px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{lang|he|עַיִן|rtl=yes}}</big>\n\nʿayin, along with [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]], [[Resh]], [[He (letter)|He]] and [[Heth (letter)|Heth]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]].\n\n===Phonetic representation===\nʿayin has traditionally been described as a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] ({{IPA|[ʕ]}}). However, this may be imprecise. Although a pharyngeal fricative has occasionally been observed for ʿayin in Arabic and so may occur in Hebrew as well, the sound is more commonly [[voiced epiglottal fricative|epiglottal]] ({{IPAblink|ʢ}}),<ref name=SOWL>Ladefoged, Peter & Ian Maddieson (1996). ''The sounds of the world’s languages''. Oxford: Blackwells. {{ISBN|0-631-19814-8}}</ref> and may also be a [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] glottal stop ({{IPA|[ʔˤ]}}).\n\nIn some historical Sephardi and Ashkenazi pronunciations, ʿayin represented a [[velar nasal]] ({{IPA|[ŋ]}}) (see Shabath, Heskel. “Romanization of the Hebrew Alphabet.” ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 1973. http://search.proquest.com/docview/873832382/, p. 179). \nRemnants can be found in the Yiddish pronunciations of some words such as /ˈjaŋkəv/ and /ˈmansə/ from Hebrew {{Hebrew|יַעֲקֹב}} (''yaʿăqōḇ'', \"Jacob\") and {{Hebrew|מַעֲשֶׂה}} (''maʿăse'', \"story\"), but in other cases, the nasal has disappeared and been replaced by /j/, such as /ˈmajsə/ and /ˈmajrəv/ from Hebrew {{Hebrew|מַעֲשֶׂה}} and {{Hebrew|מַעֲרָב}} (''maʿărāḇ'', \"west\"). \nIn Israeli Hebrew (except for Mizrahi pronunciations), it represents a glottal stop in certain cases but is usually silent (it behaves the same as [[Aleph (Hebrew)|aleph]]). However, changes in adjoining vowels often testify to the former presence of a pharyngeal or epiglottal articulation. As well, it may be used as a [[shibboleth]] to identify the social background of a speaker, as [[Arabs]] and some of the [[Mizrahim]] (mainly of [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] origin) use the more traditional pronunciation, while other Hebrew speakers pronounce it similar to Aleph.\n\nAyin is also one of the three letters that can take a furtive [[patach]] {{transl|he|patach ganuv}}).\n\nIn Hebrew loanwords in Greek and Latin, ʿayin is sometimes reflected as /g/, since the biblical phonemes {{IPAslink|ʕ}} (or \"'''ʿ'''\") and {{IPAslink|ʁ}} (represented by \"g\") were both represented in Hebrew writing by the letter ʿayin (see [[Ghain|Ġain]]). [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Gomorrah]] is from the original {{IPA|/ʁamora/}} (modern '''''ʿ'''Amora'') and [[Gaza City|Gaza]] from the original {{IPA|/ʁazza/}} ('''''ʿ'''aza'') (cf. Arabic غزة Ġazzah, IPA: [ˈɣazza].)\n\nIn Yiddish, the ʿayin is used to write the vowel e when it is not part of the [[diphthong]] ''ey''.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], ʿayin represents the number 70.\n\nʿayin is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called ''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|tagin]]'') when written in a [[sefer Torah]].\n\nBecause the sound is difficult for most non-Arabs to pronounce, it is often used as a shibboleth by Arabic speakers; other sounds, such as [[Heth (letter)|{{transl|ar|Ḥā}}]] and [[Ḍād|{{transl|ar|Ḍād}}]] are also used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Character encodings==\n{{charmap\n|05E2|name1=Hebrew Letter Ayin\n|FB20|name2=Hebrew Letter<br>Alternative Ayin\n|0725|name3=Syriac Letter E\n|080F|name4=Samaritan Letter In\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|0639|name1=ARABIC LETTER AIN\n|08D6|name2=ARABIC SMALL HIGH AIN\n|075D|name3=ARABIC LETTER AIN<br>WITH TWO DOTS<br>ABOVE\n|075F|name4=ARABIC LETTER AIN<br>WITH TWO DOTS<br>VERTICALLY ABOVE\n|06A0|name5=ARABIC LETTER AIN<br>WITH THREE DOTS<br>ABOVE\n|075E|name6=ARABIC LETTER AIN<br>WITH THREE DOTS<br>POINTING DOWNWARDS ABOVE\n|08B3|name7=ARABIC LETTER AIN<br>WITH THREE DOTS<br>BELOW\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|1D25|name1=LATIN LETTER AIN\n|1D5C|name2=MODIFIER LETTER SMALL AIN\n|A724|name3=LATIN CAPITAL LETTER<br>EGYPTOLOGICAL AIN\n|A725|name4=LATIN SMALL LETTER<br>EGYPTOLOGICAL AIN\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10393|name1=Ugaritic<br>Letter Ain\n|1084F|name2=Imperial Aramaic<br>Letter Ayin\n|1090F|name3=Phoenician<br>Letter Ain\n|2CB4|name4=COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER<br>OLD COPTIC AIN\n|2CB5|name5=COPTIC SMALL LETTER<br>OLD COPTIC AIN\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10B4F|name1=INSCRIPTIONAL PARTHIAN<br>LETTER AYIN\n|10B65|name2=INSCRIPTIONAL PAHLAVI<br>LETTER WAW-AYIN-RESH\n|10B85|name3=PSALTER PAHLAVI LETTER<br>WAW-AYIN-RESH\n|10FA|name4=GEORGIAN LETTER AIN\n|1CBA|name5=GEORGIAN MTAVRULI<br>CAPITAL LETTER AIN\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10AD9|name1=MANICHAEAN LETTER AYIN\n|0858|name2=MANDAIC LETTER AIN\n|10897|name3=NABATAEAN LETTER AYIN\n|10A92|name4=OLD NORTH ARABIAN LETTER AIN\n|10870|name5=PALMYRENE LETTER AYIN\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10F12|name1=OLD SOGDIAN LETTER AYIN\n|10F13|name2=OLD SOGDIAN LETTER<br>ALTERNATE AYIN\n|10F18|name3=OLD SOGDIAN LETTER<br>RESH-AYIN-DALETH\n|10F3D|name4=SOGDIAN LETTER AYIN\n|10F40|name5=SOGDIAN LETTER RESH-AYIN\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10FEF|name1=ELYMAIC LETTER AYIN\n}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|ע}}\n\n{{-}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]"

As Bet is the number 2 in gematria, this is said to symbolize that there are two parts to Torah: the Written [[Torah]] and the [[Oral Torah]]. According to [[Legends of the Jews|Jewish legend]], the letter Bet was specially chosen among the twenty two letters in Hebrew by [[God]] as the first letter of Torah as it begins with \"''Bereshit'' (In the beginning) God created heaven and earth.\"<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909). ''The Legends of the Jews [http://www.swartzentrover.com/cotor/e-books/misc/Legends/Legends%20of%20the%20Jews.pdf Vol. I : Alphabet]'' (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society.</ref>\n\n[[Rashi]] points out that the letter is closed on three sides and open on one; this is to teach you that you may question about what happened after creation, but not what happened before it, or what is above the heavens or below the earth.\n\n===In mathematics===\nIn [[set theory]], the [[beth number]]s stand for powers of infinite sets.\n\n==Syriac Beth==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!''Beth''\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Eastern bet.svg|50px]] ''Madnḫaya'' Beth\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Serta bet.svg|50px]] ''Serṭo'' Beth\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Estrangela bet.svg|50px]] ''Esṭrangela'' Beth\n|}\n\n[[File:Syriac letter shapes Beth.PNG|600px]]\n\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], the second letter is {{lang|syr|ܒ}} — Beth ({{lang|syr|ܒܝܼܬ}}). It is one of six letters that represents two associated sounds (the others are [[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]], [[Dalet]], [[Kaph]], [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] and [[Taw (letter)|Taw]]). When Beth has a hard pronunciation (''qûššāyâ'') it is a <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiced bilabial plosive|b]]]. When Beth has a soft pronunciation (''rûkkāḵâ'') it is traditionally pronounced as a <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiced bilabial fricative|v]]], similar to its Hebrew form. However, in eastern dialects, the soft Beth is more often pronounced as a <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiced labial-velar approximant|w]]], and can form [[diphthong]]s with its preceding vowel. Whether Beth should be pronounced as a hard or soft sound is generally determined by its context within a word. However, wherever it is traditionally [[consonant length|geminate]] within a word, even in dialects that no longer distinguish double consonants, it is hard. In the West [[Syriac language|Syriac dialect]], some speakers always pronounce Beth with its hard sound.\n\nBeth, when attached to the beginning of a word, represents the [[preposition]] 'in, with, at'. As a numeral, the letter represents the number 2, and, using various systems of dashes above or below, can stand for 2,000 and 20,000.\n\n==Character encodings==\n\n{{charmap\n|05D1|name1=Hebrew Letter Bet\n|0628|name2=Arabic Letter Beh\n|0712|name3=Syriac Letter Beth\n|0801|name4=Samaritan Letter Bit\n|2136|name5=Bet Symbol\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10381|name1=Ugaritic Letter Beta\n|10841|name2=Imperial Aramaic Letter Beth\n|10901|name3=Phoenician Letter Bet\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|ב}}\n\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]"

Still longer texts in a cursive alphabet are furnished by the clay bowls found in [[Babylonia]] and bearing [[exorcism]]s against magical influences and evil spirits. These bowls date from the 7th or 8th century, and some of the letters are written in a form that is very antiquated ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3, column 1]])''. Somewhat less of a cursive nature is the manuscript, which dates from the 8th century.<ref>Hebrew Papyri: Steinschneider, Hebräische Papyrusfragmente aus dem Fayyum, in Aegyptische Zeitschrift, xvii. 93 et seq., and table vii.; C. I. H. cols. 120 et seq.; Erman and Krebs, Aus den Papyrus der Königlichen Museen, p. 290, Berlin, 1899. For the Hebrew papyri in The Collection of Erzherzog Rainer, see D. H. Müller and D.

The differences visible in the square alphabets are much more apparent. For instance, the Sephardi rounds off still more, and, as in [[Arabic]], there is a tendency to run the lower lines to the left, whereas the Ashkenazi script appears cramped and disjointed. Instead of the little ornaments at the upper ends of the stems, in the letters [[Image:Image1Letters.jpg]] a more or less weak flourish of the line appears. For the rest the cursive of the Codices remains fairly true to the square text. \n\nDocuments of a private nature were certainly written in a much more running hand, as the sample from one of the oldest Arabic letters written with Hebrew letters (possibly the 10th century) clearly shows in the papyrus, in \"Führer durch die Ausstellung\", Table XIX., Vienna, 1894, ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|compare Figure 3, column 4]])''. However, since the preservation of such letters were not held to be of importance, material of this nature from the earlier times is very scarce, and as a consequence the development of the script is very hard to follow. The last two columns of ''[[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3]]'' exhibit the Ashkenazi cursive script of a later date. The next to the last is taken from a manuscript of [[Elias Levita]]. The accompanying specimen presents Sephardi script. In this flowing cursive alphabet the ligatures appear more often. They occur especially in letters which have a sharp turn to the left ([[ג]], [[ז]], [[כ]], [[נ]], [[צ]], [[ח]]), and above all in [[נ]], whose great open bow offers ample space for another letter ''(see Figure 2)''.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Specimen of Modern Sephardic Script.jpg||389px|thumb|right|'''Figure 2:''' \"Specimen of Modern Sephardic Script\" ''(Jewish Encyclopedia, 1901-1906)'']] -->\n\nThe following are the successive stages in the development of each letter: \n* [[Aleph|Alef]] is separated into two parts, the first being written as [[Image:Image2Letters.jpg]], and the [[perpendicular]] stroke placed at the left [[Image:Image3Letters.jpg]]. By the turn of the 20th century, Ashkenazi cursive had these two elements separated, thus ׀c, and the [[acute angle]] was rounded. It received also an abbreviated form connected with the favorite old ligature [[Image:Image4Letters.jpg]], and it is to this ligature of Alef and [[Lamedh|Lamed]] that the contracted [[Mizrahi|Oriental]] Aleph owes its origin ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|Figure 3, column 7]])''. \n* In writing [[Bet (letter)|Bet]], the lower part necessitated an interruption, and to overcome this obstacle it was made [[Image:Image5Letters.jpg]], and, with the total omission of the whole lower line, [[Image:Image6Letters.jpg]]. \n* In [[Gimel]], the left-hand stroke is lengthened more and more. \n* [[Dalet]] had its stroke put on obliquely to distinguish it from [[Resh]]; however, since in rapid writing it easily assumed a form similar in appearance to [[Resh]], [[Dalet]] in analogy with [[ב]] was later changed to [[Image:Image7Letters.jpg]]. \n* A transformation very similar to this took place in the cases of final [[Kaph|Kaf]] and of [[Qoph|Qof]] ''([[Cursive Hebrew#Historical forms|see columns 2, 5, 11, 14]])'', except that Kaf opened out a trifle more than Qof. \n* The lower part of [[Zayin]] was bent sharply to the right and received a little hook at the bottom. \n* The left-hand stroke of [[Teth|Ṭet]] was lengthened. \n* Lamed gradually lost its [[semicircle]] until (as in both [[Nabataean Arabic|Nabataean]] and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]) by the turn of the 20th century, it became a simple stroke, which was bent sharply toward the right. In the modern script today the Lamed has regained its semicircle. \n* Final [[Mem]] branches out at the bottom, and in its latest stage is drawn out either to the left or straight down. \n* In [[Samekh]] the same development also took place, but it afterward became again a simple circle. \n* To write '[[Ayin]] without removing the pen from the surface, its two strokes were joined with a curl. \n* The two forms of the letter [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] spread out in a marked flourish. \n* For [[Tsade|Tsadi]] the right-hand head is made longer, at first only to a small degree, but later on to a considerable extent. \n* In the beginning [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] develops similarly to the same letter in Nabataean, but afterward the central stroke is lengthened upward, like the right arm of Tsadi, and finally it is joined with the left stroke, and the first stroke is left off altogether. \n* The letters [[ה]], [[ד]], [[ח]], [[ן]], [[נ]], [[ר]], [[ת]], have undergone little modification: they have been rounded out and simplified by the omission of the heads.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cursive]]\n*[[Handwriting]]\n*[[Ruqʿah script]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n*[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1308&letter=A#3547 Cursive Hebrew] in the 1901–1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.oketz.com/fonts/script.html Cursive Hebrew fonts for download at ''www.oketz.com'']\n*[http://www.ladinotype.com LadinoType - System for Solitreo and Rashi]\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[Category:Penmanship]]"

''Dales'' is still used by many [[Ashkenazi]] Jews and ''daleth'' by some [[Jew]]s of [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] background, especially in the diaspora.  In some academic circles, it is called ''daleth'', following the [[Tiberian Hebrew]] pronunciation.  It is also called ''daled''.  The '''ד''' like the [[English language|English]] [[D]] represents a [[voiced alveolar stop]]. Just as in English, there may be subtle [[voiced alveolar stop#Varieties of d|varieties]] of the sound that are created when it is spoken.\n\n===Variations===\nDalet can receive a [[dagesh]], being one of the six letters that can receive Dagesh Kal (see Gimel).\nThere are minor variations to this letter's pronunciation, such as\n*'''ד''' dhalet {{IPA|/d/}} ({{IPA|/ð/}} among [[Teimani]]m, [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrachim]] and some [[Sephardi]]m; {{IPA|/z/}} among some Ashkenazim.) or\n*'''דּ'''   dalet {{IPA|/d/}}.\nIn addition, in modern Hebrew, the combination '''ד׳''' (dalet followed by a [[geresh]]) is used when transcribing foreign names to denote {{IPA|/ð/}}.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], dalet symbolizes the number four.\n\nThe letter dalet, along with the [[He (letter)|He]] (and very rarely [[Gimel (letter)|Gimel]]) is used to represent the [[Names of God in Judaism]]. The letter He is used commonly, and the dalet is rarer. A good example is the keter (crown) of a [[tallit]], which has the blessing for donning the [[tallit]], and has the name of God usually represented by a dalet.  A reason for this is that He is used as an abbreviation for HaShem \"The Name\" and the dalet is used as a non-sacred way of referring to God.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nDalet as a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]] in Aramaic (the language of the [[Talmud]]) is a preposition meaning \"that\", or \"which\", or also \"from\" or \"of\"; since many [[Talmud]]ic terms have found their way into Hebrew, one can hear dalet as a prefix in many phrases (as in ''[[Mitzvah]] '''D'''oraitah''; a mitzvah from the [[Torah]].)\n\nIn modern Hebrew the frequency of the usage of dalet, out of all the letters, is 2.59%.\n\n==Syriac daled/dolath==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is one of six letters that represents two associated sounds (the others are [[Bet (letter)|bet]], [[Gimel (letter)|gimel]], [[kaph]], [[Pe (letter)|pe]] and [[Taw (letter)|taw]]). When daled/dolath has a hard pronunciation (''qûššāyâ'') it is a {{IPA|{{bracket|[[voiced alveolar plosive|d]]}}}}. When it has a soft pronunciation (''rûkkāḵâ'') it is traditionally pronounced as a {{IPA|{{bracket|[[Voiced dental fricative|ð]]}}}}. The letter is very common in Syriac as it is often attached to the beginning of words as the [[relative pronoun]].\n\nDaled/dolath is always written with a point below it to distinguish it from the letter [[resh]] ({{lang|syr|ܪ}}), which is identical apart from having a point above. As a numeral, dalad/dolath stands for the number four.

People who practice gematria believe that words with identical numerical values may bear some relation to each other or to the number itself. A single word can yield multiple values depending on the [[cipher]] used.\n\nGematria originated as an Assyro-Babylonian-Greek system of alphanumeric code or cipher that was later adopted into [[Jewish culture]]. Similar systems have been used in other languages and cultures: earlier, the Greek [[isopsephy]], and later, derived from or inspired by Hebrew gematria, Arabic [[abjad numerals]], and English gematria.\n\nA well-known example of Hebrew gematria is the word ''[[Chai (symbol)|chai]]'' (\"alive\"), which is composed of two letters that (using the assignments in the ''Mispar gadol'' table shown below) add up to 18. This has made 18 a \"[[luck#Numerology|lucky number]]\" among the Jewish people. Gifts of money in multiples of 18 are very popular.<ref>{{cite web |title= Chabad.org Chani Benjaminson |url= http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/484894/jewish/What-is-the-reason-giving-money-in-multiples-of-18.htm}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAlthough the term is [[Hebrew Language|Hebrew]], it may be derived from the [[Greek Language|Greek]] γεωμετρία ''geōmetriā'', \"[[geometry]]\", which was used as a translation of gēmaṭriyā, though some scholars believe it to derive from Greek γραμματεια ''grammateia'' \"knowledge of [[writing]]\".

Although ostensibly derived from Greek [[isopsephy]], it is largely used in Jewish texts, notably in those associated with the [[Kabbalah]]. The term does not appear in the [[Hebrew Bible]] itself.<ref name=JE />\n\n==Traditional fields of use==\nSome identify two forms of gematria: the \"revealed\" form, which is prevalent in many hermeneutic methods found throughout [[rabbinic literature]], and the \"mystical\" form, a largely [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] practice.<ref>e.g. Aish HaTorah, http://www.aish.com/spirituality/prayer/Prayer_6_-_Hear_O_Israel_Part_1.asp, which says \"It is part of a Kabbalistic tradition ... Gematria is a Kabbalistic way of showing how two ideas are related on a conceptual level; it is using numerology as a basis to confirm (not create) the connection.\"</ref>\n\nAlthough gematria is most often used to calculate the values of individual words, [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|psukim]] (Biblical verses), [[Talmud]]ical aphorisms, sentences from the standard [[Jewish liturgy|Jewish prayers]], personal, angelic and Godly names, and other religiously significant material, Kabbalists use them often for arbitrary phrases and, occasionally, for various languages.{{cn|date=April 2019}} A few instances of gematria in Arabic, Spanish and Greek, spelled with the Hebrew letters, are mentioned in the works of [[Abraham Abulafia]];<ref>Otzar Eden ha-Ganuz,</ref> some [[Rebbe|Hasidic Rebbis]] also used it, although rarely, for [[Yiddish]].<ref>E.g. the rebbes of the [[Zidichov (Hasidic dynasty)|Zhidichov dynasty]] noticed that the Yiddish word ''vaser'' (water) has the same value as ''Geshem'' (''rain'' in Hebrew), and used this fact for [[Theurgy|theurgic]] meditations</ref> However, the primary language for gematria calculations has always been and remains Hebrew and, to a lesser degree, [[Aramaic]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nA classic Biblical commentary incorporating ''gematria'' is ''Baal ha-Turim'' by [[Jacob ben Asher]].{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n''Gematria'' is often used by the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[Torah]] commentators (such as the ''Sefath Emmeth'' from [[Góra Kalwaria]]).{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Textual sources==\nA [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] textual source makes clear that the word ''gematria'' is dated to at least the [[Tannaic]] period.<br>\n[[Pirkei Avot]] 3:23 (= m.

More advanced methods are usually used for the most significant Biblical verses, [[Jewish liturgy|prayers]], names of God and angels etc.\n* ''Mispar Hechrachi'' (absolute value) that uses full numerical value of the 22 letters. Sometimes it is also called ''Mispar ha-Panim'' (face number), as opposed to the more complicated ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' (back number).\n* ''Mispar Gadol'' counts the final forms (sofit) of the Hebrew letters as a continuation of the numerical sequence for the alphabet, with the final letters assigned values from 500 to 900.\n* The same name, ''Mispar ha-Gadol'', is also used for another method, which spells the name of each letter and adds the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan'' calculates the value of each letter, but truncates all of the zeros. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Me'ugal''.\n* ''Mispar Siduri'' (ordinal value) with each of the twenty-two letters given a value from one to twenty-two.\n* ''Mispar Bone'eh'' (building value, also ''Revu'a'', square<ref>Toras Menachem - Tiferes Levi Yitzchok, Vol. I - Bereshis, p. 2, fn. 7</ref>) is calculated by walking over each letter from the beginning to the end, adding the value of all previous letters and the value of the current letter to the running total. Therefore, the value of the word ''achad'' (one) is 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8)&nbsp;+&nbsp;(1&nbsp;+&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;23.\n* ''Mispar Kidmi'' (triangular value) uses each letter as the sum of all the standard gematria letter values preceding it. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1, the value of Bet is 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, the value of Gimmel is 1+2+3=6, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular or tripled number).\n* ''Mispar P'rati'' calculates the value of each letter as the square of its standard gematria value. Therefore, the value of Aleph is 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the value of Bet is 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, the value of gimmel is 3&nbsp;×&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;9, etc. It's also known as ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Prati'''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Merubah ha-Klali'' is the square of the standard absolute value of each word.\n* ''Mispar Meshulash'' calculates the value of each letter as the cube of their standard value. The same term is more often used for ''Mispar Kidmi''.\n* ''Mispar ha-Akhor'' – The value of each letter is its standard value multiplied by the position of the letter in a word or a phrase in either ascending or descending order. This method is particularly interesting, because the result is sensitive to the order of letters. It is also sometimes called ''Mispar Meshulash'' (triangular number).\n* ''Mispar Mispari'' spells out the standard values of each letter by their Hebrew names (\"Achad\" (one) is 1+8+4=13 etc.), and then adds up the standard values of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Shemi'' (also Millui letter \"filling\"), uses the value of each letter as equal to the value of its name.<ref>the spelling of the name of the number comes from the Talmud</ref> For example, the value of the letter Aleph is (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;30&nbsp;+&nbsp;80)&nbsp;=&nbsp;111, Bet is (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;10&nbsp;+&nbsp;400)&nbsp;=&nbsp;412, etc. Sometimes the same operation is applied two or more times recursively.\n* ''Mispar Ne'elam'' (hidden number) spells out the name of each letter without the letter itself (e.g. \"Leph\" for \"Aleph\") and adds up the value of the resulting string.\n* ''Mispar Katan Mispari'' (integral reduced value) is used where the total numerical value of a word is reduced to a single digit. If the sum of the value exceeds 9, the integer values of the total are repeatedly added to produce a single-digit number. The same value will be arrived at regardless of whether it is the absolute values, the ordinal values, or the reduced values that are being counted by methods above.\n* ''Mispar Misafi'' adds the number of the letters in the word or phrase to their gematria.\n* ''Kolel'' is the number of words, which is often added to the gematria. In case of one word, the standard value is incremented by one.\n\nWithin the wider topic of Gematria are included the various alphabet transformations where one letter is substituted by another based on a logical scheme:\n* ''[[Atbash]]'' exchanges each letter in a word or a phrase by ''opposite'' letters. Opposite letters are determined by substituting the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph) with the last letter (Tav), the second letter (Bet) with the next to last (Shin), etc. The result can be interpreted as a secret message or calculated by the standard gematria methods. A few instances of Atbash are found already in the Hebrew [[Bible]]. For example, see [[Jeremiah]] 25:26, and 51:41, with [[Targum Jonathan|Targum]] and [[Rashi]], in which the name ששך (\"Sheshek\") is thought to represent בבל ([[Babylon]]).<ref name=JE>[[Solomon Schechter]] & Caspar Levias, \"Gematria\". ''The Jewish Encyclopedia'', Volume 5. New York: Funk & Wagnalls Co. 1904. [https://archive.org/stream/jewishencyclopedia05sing#page/588/mode/2up p.589.]</ref>\n* ''Albam'' – the alphabet is divided in half, eleven letters in each section. The first letter of the first series is exchanged for the first letter of the second series, the second letter of the first series for the second letter of the second series and so forth.\n* ''Achbi'' divides the alphabet into two equal groups of eleven letters. Within each group, the first letter is replaced by the last, the second by the tenth, etc.\n* ''Ayak Bakar'' replaces each letter by another one that has a 10-times-greater value. The final letters usually signify the numbers from 500 to 900.  Thousands is reduced to ones (1000 becomes 1, 2000 becomes 2 etc.)\n* ''Ofanim'' replaces each letter by the last letter of its name (e.g. \"Fe\" for \"Aleph\").\n* ''Akhas Beta'' divides the alphabet into three groups of 7, 7 and 8 letters. Each letter is replaced cyclically by the corresponding letter of the next group. The letter [[Tav (letter)|Tav]] remains the same.\n* ''Avgad'' replaces each letter by the next one. Tav becomes Aleph. The opposite operation is also used.\nMost of the above-mentioned methods and ciphers are listed by Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob Cordovero|Moshe Cordevero]].<ref>Moshe Cordevero, ''Sefer Pardes ha-Rimonim'', ''שער האותיות''</ref>\n\nSome authors provide lists of as many as 231 various replacement ciphers, related to the 231 mystical Gates of the [[Sefer Yetzirah]].<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\">Elazar Rokeach, Sefer ha-Shem</ref>\n\nDozens of other far more advanced methods are used in Kabbalistic literature, without any particular names. In Ms. Oxford 1,822, one article lists 75 different forms of gematria.<ref>''Encyclopedia Judaica'', 2007, vol. 7, 426</ref> Some known methods are [[recursion|recursive]] in nature and are reminiscent of the [[graph theory]] or use heavily [[combinatorics]]. Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms|Elazar Rokeach]] often used multiplication, instead of addition, for the above-mentioned methods. For example, spelling out the letters of a word and then multiplying the squares of each letter value in the resulting string produces very large numbers, in orders of [[10^12|trillions]]. The spelling process can be applied recursively, until a certain pattern (e.g. all the letters of the word \"[[Talmud]]\") is found; the gematria of the resulting string is then calculated.  The same author also used sums of all possible unique letter combinations, which add up to the value of a given letter. For example, the letter [[He (letter)|Hei]], which has the standard value of 5, can be produced by combining 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 or 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3, which adds up to&nbsp;30. Sometimes combinations of repeating letters are not allowed (e.g. 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3 is valid, but 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is not). The original letter itself can also be viewed as a valid combination.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Shem\" />\n\nVariant spellings of some letters can be used to produce sets of different numbers, which can be added up or analyzed separately. Many various complex [[formal systems]] and recursive algorithms, based on graph-like structural analysis of the letter names and their relations to each other, [[modular arithmetic]], pattern search and other highly advanced techniques, are found in the \"Sefer ha-Malchuth\" by Rabbi David ha-Levi of [[Draa|Draa Valley]], a Spanish-Moroccan Kabbalist of the 15–16th century.<ref name=\"Sefer ha-Malchut\">Sefer ha-Malchut, \"Sifrei Chaim\", Jerusalem, 2008</ref> Rabbi David ha-Levi's methods take into consideration the numerical values and other properties of the [[Niqqud|vowels]] as well.\n\nKabbalistic [[Jewish views of astrology|astrology]] uses some specific methods to determine the astrological influences on a particular person. According to one method, the gematria of the person's name is added to the gematria of his or her mother's name; the result is then divided by 7 and 12. The remainders signify a particular planet and Zodiac sign.<ref>Commentary to [[Sefer Yetzirah]], attributed to [[Saadia Gaon]], 6:4; Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Sefer Yetzirah, \"WeiserBooks\", Boston, 1997, pp. 220-221</ref>\n\n==Mathematical==\nA formula for finding a letter's corresponding number in Mispar Gadol is: <math>f(x) = \\left(10^{\\mathrm{floor}\\left(\\left(x-1\\right)\\div 9\\right)}\\right)\\times\\left(\\left(\\left(x-1\\right)\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ 9\\right)+1\\right)</math> where ''x'' is the position of the letter in the language letters index (Regular order of letters), and the [[Floor and ceiling functions|floor]] and [[modulo operation|modulo]] functions are used.\n\n==Absolute value==\nThe most common form of Hebrew ''gematria'' is used in the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], and elaborately by many post-Talmudic [[rabbinic literature|commentators]]. It involves reading words and sentences as numbers, assigning numerical instead of phonetic value to each letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. When read as numbers, they can be compared and contrasted with other words or phrases&nbsp;– cf. the Hebrew proverb {{lang|he|נכנס&nbsp;יין&nbsp;יצא&nbsp;סוד}} (''{{transl|he|nichnas&nbsp;yayin&nbsp;yatza&nbsp;sod}}'', lit. \"wine entered, secret went out\", i.e. \"''in vino veritas''\"). The gematric value of {{lang|he|יין}} (\"wine\") is 70 ({{lang|he|י}}=10; {{lang|he|י}}=10; {{lang|he|ן}}=50) and this is also the gematric value of {{lang|he|סוד}} (\"secret\", {{lang|he|ס}}=60; {{lang|he|ו}}=6; {{lang|he|ד}}=4)&lrm;.<ref>Babylonian Talmud, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|tractate Sanhedrin]] 38a, see of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"'[[false etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of 'Lexical Engineering' in Judaism, Islam and Christianity.

For example: the title גְּבֶרֶת (literally \"lady\") is abbreviated גב׳, equivalent to English \"Mrs\" and \"Ms\".<ref>{{cite web|title=(Academy of the Hebrew Language)|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision5.html Hebrew Punctuation }}</ref>\n\n===Denoting a numeral===\nA Geresh can be appended after (left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a [[Hebrew numeral]]. For example: ק׳&lrm; represents 100. A multi-digit Hebrew numeral is indicated by the [[Gershayim]] {{angle bracket|״}}.\n\n==Cantillation mark==\n{{main|Geresh (trope)}}\nAs a note of [[cantillation]] in the reading of the [[Torah]], the Geresh is printed above the accented letter: <span style=\"line-height:120%; font-size: 180%; font-family:'Times New Roman', Arial, Gisha, 'Microsoft Sans Serif', Code2000, 'Courier New', 'Ezra SIL', 'SBL Hebrew';\">ב֜</span>.

Less often, it is pronounced as a fricative {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, except in [[Lower Egypt]] and some parts of Southern [[Arabian Peninsula]].

The two functions of dagesh are distinguished as either qal (light) or hazaq (strong). The six letters are [[Beth (letter)|bet]], gimel, [[Daleth (letter)|daled]], [[kaph]], [[Pe (letter)|pe]], and [[Taw (letter)|taf]]. Three of them (bet, kaph,  and pe) have their sound value changed in modern Hebrew from the fricative to the plosive by adding a dagesh. The other three represent the same pronunciation in modern Hebrew, but have had alternate pronunciations at other times and places. They are essentially pronounced in the fricative as ג gh غ, dh ذ and th ث. In the [[Yemenite Hebrew|Temani]] pronunciation, gimel represents {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, or {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} when with a dagesh, and {{IPA|/ɣ/}} without a dagesh. In modern Hebrew, the combination '''{{Hebrew|ג׳}}''' (gimel followed by a [[geresh]]) is used in loanwords and foreign names to denote {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}}.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], gimel represents the number three.\n\nIt is written like a ''[[Waw (letter)|vav]]'' with a ''[[Yodh|yud]]'' as a \"foot\", and it resembles a person in motion; symbolically, a rich man running after a poor man to give him charity, as in the [[Hebrew alphabet]] ''gimel'' directly precedes ''[[dalet]]'', which signifies a poor or lowly man, from the Hebrew word ''dal'' (b. ''[[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]]'', 104a).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ginzburgh|first1=Yitzchak|first2=Avraham Arieh|last2=Trugman|first3=Moshe Yaakov|last3=Wisnefsky|title=The Alef-beit: Jewish Thought Revealed Through the Hebrew Letters|location=Lanham|publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]]|pages=42,389|date=1991|isbn=9780876685181|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5YVLC35h3B8C&printsec=frontcover}}</ref>\n\nThe word ''gimel'' is related to ''gemul'', which means 'justified repayment', or the giving of reward and punishment.\n\nGimel is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called ''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|tagin]]'') when written in a [[Sefer Torah]]. See ''[[Shin (letter)|shin]]'', ''[[ayin]]'', ''[[teth]]'', ''[[Nun (letter)|nun]]'', ''[[zayin]]'', and ''[[Tsade|tsadi]]''.\n\nThe letter gimel is the [[electoral symbol]] for the [[United Torah Judaism]] party, and the party is often nicknamed ''Gimmel''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamodia.com/2015/03/11/mass-rally-for-united-torah-judaism/|title=Mass Rally for United Torah Judaism - Hamodia.com|date=11 March 2015|website=Hamodia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hamodia.com/2019/04/01/gedolim-special-conference-call-strengthen-utj-uphold-torah-shabbos-religious-character/|title=Gedolim at Special Conference Call to Strengthen UTJ to Uphold Torah, Shabbos and Religious Character - Hamodia.com|date=1 April 2019|website=Hamodia}}</ref>\n\nIn Modern Hebrew, the frequency of usage of gimel, out of all the letters, is 1.26%.\n\n==Syriac Gamal/Gomal==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Gamal/Gomal'''\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Eastern gamal.svg|50px]] ''Madnḫaya'' Gamal\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Serta gamal.svg|50px]] ''Serṭo'' Gomal\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Estrangela gamal.svg|50px]] ''Esṭrangela'' Gamal\n|}\n\n[[File:Syriac letter shapes Gamal.PNG|600px]]\n\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], the third letter is {{lang|syr|ܓ}} — Gamal in eastern pronunciation, Gomal in western pronunciation ({{lang|syr|ܓܵܡܵܠ}}).

When Gamal/Gomal has a soft pronunciation (''rûkkāḵâ&nbsp;'') it traditionally represents {{IPAblink|ɣ}} ({{lang|syr|ܓ݂ܵܡܵܠ}}), or ''Ghamal/Ghomal''. The letter, renamed ''Jamal/Jomal'', is written with a [[tilde]]/tie either below or within it to represent the borrowed [[phoneme]] {{IPAblink|d͡ʒ}} ({{lang|syr|ܓ̰ܡܵܠ}}), which is used in [[Garshuni]] and some [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] to write loan and foreign words from Arabic or Persian.\n\n==Ethiopian/Sudanese Gimel==\n\nThe dialect of Eastern Africa often utilizes the gimel sofit when the gimel ends a word.

''He'', like all Phoenician letters, represented a [[consonant]], but the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic equivalents have all come to represent [[vowel]] sounds.\n\n==Origins==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}\nIn Proto-[[Northwest Semitic]] there were still three voiceless fricatives: uvular {{transl|sem|ḫ}}, glottal {{transl|sem|h}}, and pharyngeal {{transl|sem|ḥ}}. In the [[Wadi el-Hol script]], these appear to be expressed by derivatives of the following Egyptian hieroglyphs <hiero>V28</hiero>''{{transl|sem|ḫayt}}'' \"[[yarn|thread]]\",\n<hiero>A28</hiero> ''{{transl|sem|hillul}}'' \"[[wiktionary:jubilation|jubilation]]\", compare [[South Arabian alphabet|South Arabian]] [[File:himjar ha.PNG|20px]] {{transl|sem|h}}, [[File:himjar ha2.PNG|20px]] {{transl|sem|ḥ}}, [[File:himjar kha.PNG|20px]] {{transl|sem|ḫ}}, [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] <span style=\"font-size:140%;\">ሀ</span>, <span style=\"font-size:140%;\">ሐ</span>, <span style=\"font-size:140%;\">ኀ</span>, and <hiero>O6</hiero> ''{{transl|sem|ḥasir}}'' \"[[court]]\".\nIn the [[Phoenician alphabet]], ''{{transl|sem|ḫayt}}'' and ''{{transl|sem|ḥasir}}'' are merged into [[Heth (letter)|Heth]] \"fence\", while ''{{transl|sem|hillul}}'' is replaced by ''He'' \"[[window]]\".\n\n==Arabic hāʾ==\nThe letter is named ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}''. It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ه}}\n\n''{{Transl|ar|DIN|Hāʾ}}'' is used as a suffix (with the ''[[harakat]]'' dictated by ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|[[ʾIʿrab]]}}'') indicating [[possession (linguistics)|possession]], indicating that the noun marked with the suffix belongs to a specific [[grammatical gender|masculine]] possessor; for example, {{lang|ar|كِتَاب}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|kitāb}}'' (\"book\") becomes {{lang|ar|كِتَابُهُ}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|kitābuhu}}'' (\"his book\") with the addition of final ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}''; the possessor is implied in the suffix. A longer example, {{lang|ar|هُوَ يَقْرَأُ كِتَابَهُ}}, (''huwa yaqraʼu kitābahu'', \"he reads his book\") more clearly indicates the possessor. Hāʾ is also used as the Arabic abbreviation for dates following the Islamic era [[AH (era)|{{sc|ah}}]].\n\nThe ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|hāʾ}}'' suffix appended to a verb represents a masculine [[object (grammar)|object]] (e.g. {{lang|ar|يَقْرَأُهُ}}, ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|yaqraʾuhu}}'', \"he reads it\").\n\nThe feminine form of this construction is in both cases {{lang|ar|ـهَا}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|-hā}}''.\n\nIn [[Nastaʿlīq]] the letter has its own particular shapes. As Urdu and other languages of Pakistan are usually written in Nastaʿlīq, they normally employ those shapes, which are given an independent code point (U+06C1) for compatibility:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ہ}}\n\nFor aspiration Urdu and other languages of Pakistan use a special form of ''hāʾ'', called in Urdu ''do chashmī he'' (\"two-eyed he\"):\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ھ}}\n\nMany Turkic languages of Central Asia like Uyghur as well as Kurdish use the modification of the letter for front vowels /{{IPA link|æ}}/ or /{{IPA link|ɛ}}/. This has its own code point (U+06D5). To distinguish it from Arabic ''hāʾ'' /h/ the letter lacks its initial and medial forms:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ە}}\n\n==Hebrew Hei==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">ה</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:29pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">ה</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">ה</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He handwriting.svg|22px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter He Rashi.png|35px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{hebrew|הֵא}}</big>\n\n===Pronunciation===\nIn [[Hebrew Language|modern Hebrew]], the letter represents a [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/ɦ/}}, and may also be dropped, although this pronunciation is seen as substandard.\n\nAlso, in many variant Hebrew pronunciations the letter may represent a glottal stop. In word-final position, ''Hei'' is used to indicate an ''a''-vowel, usually that of [[qamatz]] (&nbsp;<big>{{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"line-height:normal\">&#x5B8;</span>}}</big>&nbsp;), and in this sense functions like [[Aleph]], [[Vav (letter)|Vav]], and [[Yodh|Yud]] as a [[mater lectionis]], indicating the presence of a long vowel.\n\n''Hei'', along with [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]], [[Ayin]], [[Resh|Reish]], and [[Heth (letter)|Khet]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. Nonetheless, it does receive a marking identical to the dagesh, to form ''Hei-[[mappiq]]'' ({{Hebrew|הּ}}). Although indistinguishable for most modern speakers or readers of Hebrew, the mapiq is placed in a word-final ''Hei'' to indicate that the letter is not merely a mater lectionis but the consonant should be aspirated in that position. It is generally used in Hebrew to indicate the third-person feminine singular genitive marker. Today, such a pronunciation only occurs in religious contexts and even then often only by careful readers of the scriptures.\n\n===Significance of Hei===\nIn [[gematria]], ''Hei'' symbolizes the number five, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 5000 (i.e. התשנ״ד in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[calendar date|date]] 5754). \n\nAttached to words, ''Hei'' may have three possible meanings:\n*A [[preposition]] meaning the definite article \"the\", or the relative pronouns \"that\", or \"who\" (as in \"a boy ''who'' reads\"). For example, ''yeled'', a boy; '''''ha'''yeled'', the boy.\n*A prefix indicating that the sentence is a question. (For example, ''Yadata'', You knew; '''''Ha'''yadata''?, Did you know?)\n*A suffix after place names indicating movement towards the given noun. (For example, ''Yerushalayim'', [[Jerusalem]]; ''Yerushalaym'''ah''''', towards Jerusalem.)\n\nIn modern Hebrew the frequency of the usage of he, out of all the letters, is 8.18%.\n\n''Hei'', representing five in gematria, is often found on amulets, symbolizing the five fingers of a hand, [[Hamsa|a very common talismanic symbol]].\n\n====In Judaism====\n''Hei'' is often used to represent the name of God as an abbreviation for [[Names of God in Judaism#Hashem.2FHadavar|Hashem]], which means ''The Name'' and is a way of saying ''God'' without actually saying the name of God. In print, Hashem is usually written as ''Hei'' with a [[geresh]]: {{Hebrew|ה׳}}.\n\n==Syriac Heh==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Heh'''\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Eastern he.svg|50px]] ''Madnḫaya'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Serta he.svg|50px]] ''Serṭo'' Heh\n|-\n| [[File:Syriac Estrangela he.svg|50px]] ''Esṭrangela'' Heh\n|}\n\n[[File:Syriac letter shapes Heh.PNG|600px]]\n\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], the fifth letter is {{lang|syr|ܗ}} — Heh ({{lang|syr|ܗܹܐ}}). It is pronounced as an <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[voiceless glottal fricative|h]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>. At the end of a word with a point above it, it represents the [[grammatical person|third-person]] [[grammatical gender|feminine]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[suffix]]. Without the point, it stands for the masculine equivalent. Standing alone with a horizontal line above it, it is the [[abbreviation]] for either ''hānoh'' ({{lang|syr|ܗܵܢܘܿ}}), meaning 'this is' or 'that is', or ''[[Hallelujah|halelûya]]'' ({{lang|syr|ܗܵܠܹܠܘܼܝܵܐ}}).

That means, that the letters' appearances change when they are at the end of words from [[כ]], [[פ]], [[צ]], [[מ]], [[נ]] to [[ך]], [[ף]], [[ץ]], [[ם]], [[ן]] respectively.  Final forms are used in transliteration when appropriate, with the exception of foreign words ending in a [p] sound, which retain the non-final form of [[פ]], such as \"קטשופ\" (\"ketchup\").\n\n=== Vowels and diphthongs===\nSince vowels are not consistent in English, they are more difficult to transliterate into other languages.  Sometimes they are just transcribed by the actual English letter, and other times by its actual pronunciation (which also varies).  For the most accurate transliteration, below is a table describing the different vowel sounds and their corresponding letters.\n\nHebrew has only 5 vowel sounds, with lack of discrimination in Hebrew between long and short vowels.  In comparison, English which has around 12 vowel sounds (5 long, 7 short) depending on dialect.  As a result, words such as sit/seat ({{IPA|/sɪt/}} and {{IPA|/siːt/}}), hat/hut ({{IPA|/hæt/}} and {{IPA|/hʌt/}}), and cop/cope ({{IPA|/kɒp/}} and {{IPA|/koʊp/}}) are transliterated as the Hebrew vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}.  The English pronunciation can be known through prior context.\n\nVowels will sometimes be put into Hebrew by their letters, and not by their sounds, even though it is less accurate phonetically.  For example, any sort of \"a\" sound written with the letter \"o\", (ex. mom, monitor, soft), will often be transliterated as an \"o\" vowel, that is, with a vav (ו).  The same is the case for an -or ending (pronounced -er), it will also often be transliterated with a vav as well.  If the word with the \"a\" sound (such as \"a\" or \"ah\"), as in \"ta ta\", or \"spa\", it will be treated as an \"a\".\n\nFor [[full spelling]], the ''[[niqqudot]]'' (the \"dots\") is simply omitted, if [[partial vowelling]] is desired, especially for letters like Vav, then the niqqudot is retained.\n\nThe picture of the \"'''O'''\" represents whatever Hebrew letter is used.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" | Vowels\n|-\n!width=\"0%\"| Letter\n!

The International Hebrew Braille Code is widely used. It was devised in the 1930s and completed in 1944. It is based on [[unified international braille|international norms]], with additional letters devised to accommodate differences between [[English Braille]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].<ref name=Candle/> Unlike Hebrew, but in keeping with other braille alphabets, Hebrew Braille is read from left to right instead of right to left.,<ref name=\"MackenzieMackenzie1954\">{{cite book|last1=Mackenzie|first1=Clutha Nantes|author2=Sir Clutha Nantes Mackenzie|title=World Braille Usage: a survey of efforts towards uniformity of braille notation|year=1954|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> and unlike English Braille, it is a [[Abjad]], all consonants.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the 1930s, there were several regional variations of Hebrew Braille, but no universal system.<ref name=Candle>{{cite news | title = I Shall Light a Candle | last = Okin | first = Tessie | date = August 15, 1952 | accessdate = October 19, 2010 | work = Canadian Jewish Chronicle | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5rMqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PGEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6631,2004612&dq=jewish-braille-institute&hl=en}}</ref> In 1930, the [[JBI International|Jewish Braille Institute of America]], under the direction of the [[Synagogue Council of America]], assembled an international committee for the purpose of producing a unified embossed code to be used by sightless people throughout the world. The committee membership consisted of Isaac Maletz, representing the Jewish Institute for the Blind, Jerusalem; Dr. Max Geffner, of the Blindeninstitut of Vienna; Canon C. F. Waudby, of the National Institute for the Blind, Great Britain; Leopold Dubov, of the Jewish Braille Institute of America; and Rabbi Harry J. Brevis, representing the New York Board of Rabbis.  Rabbi Brevis, who had lost his eyesight in his mid 20s, and who had developed a system of Hebrew braille for his personal use as a rabbinical student while attending the Jewish Institute of Religion from 1926 and 1929, was named chairman of the committee, and Leupold Dubov, the executive director of the Jewish Braille Institute of America, was appointed secretary.  In 1933, the committee voted unanimously to approve and sponsor Brevis' system for adoption as the International Hebrew Braille Code.  Brevis published a selection of readings from the Bible, Mishnah, and contemporary literature using this system in 1935 under the title ''A Hebrew Braille Chrestomathy''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1969_21_02_00.pdf|title=The Story of Hebrew Braille|last=Brevis|first=Harry|date=1969|website=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1969_21_02_00.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>  Among the greater challenges faced by the committee was the accommodation of the Hebrew vowel points.  In 1936,<ref name=Candle/> the first Hebrew Braille book was published with sponsorship from the [[Library of Congress]]: a volume of excerpts from the ''[[Talmud]]'' and other sources.<ref name=\"Blumenthal1969\">{{cite book|last=Blumenthal|first=Walter Hart|title=Bookmen's Bedlam: an Olio of Literary Oddities|year=1969|publisher=Ayer Publishing|isbn=978-0-8369-1022-3|page=175}}</ref> The code underwent further refinements for the better part of a decade until its completion in 1944.<ref name=Candle/>\n\n==Basic alphabet==\nBecause Hebrew Braille derives from English Braille, there is not a one-to-one match between Hebrew letters in print and in braille.  Most obviously, four consonants with the ''[[dagesh]]'' point in print have distinct letters in braille, but three others require a ''dagesh'' prefix {{bc|45}} in braille.  The different placements of the dot on the print letter ''shin'' also correspond to two different letters in braille.  On the other hand, the distinct final forms of some letters in print are not reflected in braille.\n\nIn the table below, the braille letters corresponding to basic letters in print are in the top row, while those derived by pointing in print, and which have a distinct pronunciation in Modern Hebrew, are in the second row.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable<!-- Unicode-->\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 {{verth|va=middle|mw=22px|Basic}}\n!

It is not clear if the prefix can be added to letters that have partners in the bottom row of the table above to distinguish, say, dagesh hazak ''kk'' from dagesh kal ''k'', or ''ww'' from ''û''.\n\nWhen transcribing completely unpointed print texts, only the top row of braille letters is used.\n\n==Vowel pointing==\nApart from those written with {{hebrew|ו}} and {{hebrew|י}} and thus obligatory in print, vowels are optional in braille just as they are in print.

An example of this system is {{Script/Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-family:serif;font-size:large\">„</span>שָׁלוֹם<span style=\"font-family:serif;font-size:large\">”</span>}}.\n\nHowever, this distinction in Hebrew between opening and closing quotation marks has mostly disappeared, and today, quotations are most often punctuated as they are in English (such as {{Script/Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-family:serif;font-size:large\">\"</span>שָׁלוֹם<span style=\"font-family:serif;font-size:large\">\"</span>}}), with both quotation marks high. This is due to the advent of the [[Hebrew keyboard|Hebrew keyboard layout]], which lacks the opening quotation mark ⟨<span style=\"font-family:serif;font-size:large\">„</span>⟩, as well as to the lack in Hebrew of \"[[quotation mark#Curved quotes and Unicode|smart quotes]]\" in certain word processing programs.\n\nIn addition, the quotation mark is often used for the similar looking but different ''[[gershayim]]'' mark ⟨<span style=\"font-size:large\">{{Script/Hebrew|״}}</span>⟩, as that too is absent from the [[Hebrew keyboard]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

      "text": "'''Hebrew spelling''' ({{lang-he|כתיב עברי}} {{IPA|/ktiv ʕivˈri/}}, \"Hebrew spelling\") refers to the way words are spelled in the [[Hebrew language]]. The [[Hebrew alphabet]] contains 22 letters, all of which are primarily consonants.  This is because the Hebrew script is an [[abjad]], that is, its letters indicate consonants, not vowels or syllables. An early system to overcome this, still used today, is [[mater lectionis|''matres lectionis'']], where four of these letters, [[Aleph|alef]], [[He (letter)|he]], [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] also serve as vowel letters. Later, a system of vowel points to indicate vowels (diacritics), called [[niqqud]], was developed.\n\n==History==\n{{Further information|Biblical Hebrew orthography}}\nThroughout history, there have been two main systems of Hebrew spelling. One is vocalized spelling, the other is unvocalized spelling.\n\nIn vocalized spelling (''[[ktiv menuqad]]''), all of the vowels are indicated by vowel points (called [[niqqud]]). In unvocalized spelling (''[[ktiv hasar niqqud]]''), the vowel points are omitted, but some of them are substituted by additional vowel letters - [[Waw (letter)|waw]] and [[yodh]] (''Ktiv malē''). This system is the spelling system commonly used in Israel today.\n\nVowel points are always optional in Hebrew. They can be used fully, partially or not used at all. The recommended approach endorsed today by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and other Israeli educational institutions is to use ''plēnē'' spelling (''matres lectionis'') when not adding vowel dots (which is the usual case), and place a vocalization sign on a letter only when ambiguity cannot be resolved otherwise. The [[defective script|\"defective\" spelling]] is recommended for a fully vocalized text, hence its use is becoming rare. Texts older than 50–60 years may be written in an unvocalized ''defective'' spelling (for example, the word ''ħamiším'' \"fifty\", was written חמשים on banknotes issued in [[Mandatory Palestine]] or the [[Bank of Israel]] in its early days. Today, the common spelling is חמישים). A vocalized ''plene'' spelling system is common in [[children's books]], when it is better to accustom the children to the more popular ''plene'' spelling, while still letting them benefit from the vowel dots as a reading aid in early learning stages.\n\nA third system that was endorsed in the past by the Academy of the Hebrew Language as an optimal system, but abandoned due to low popularity, calls for the use of ''ħolám'' (וֹ), ''šurúq'' (וּ), ''dagéš'' in ''Bet'', ''Kaf'' and ''Pe'' (בּ, כּ, פּ vs. ב, כ, פ), ''Šin Smalít'' (שׂ) and ''mappíq'' (הּ), while abandoning all other vowel dots (in everyday writing). According to this system, ''matres lectionis'' are still introduced to mark vowels, but the letter ''Vav'' is used only as a consonant, while its variants ''ħolám'' and ''šurúq'' serve as vowel letters. This system also makes clear distinction between final ''He'' used as a vowel marker (e.g. ילדה {{IPA|/jalˈda/}} \"a girl\" ) and as a consonant (e.g. ילדהּ {{IPA|/jalˈdah/}} \"her child\"). This system was never extensively used, and the Academy of the Hebrew Language finally abandoned it in 1992, when new rules were published not assuming any use of vowel dots.\n\nRules for unvocalized spelling were first issued by the Hebrew Language Committee in 1890 (which became the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] in 1953) and formally standardised in 1996. Even though the rules are established, some of the rules and specific spellings are disputed by writers and publishers, who often create their own in-house spelling system. Also, because having two spelling systems within the same language is confusing, some would like to reform it. In 2004, [[Mordechai Mishor]], one of the academy's linguists, proposed in a session of the Academy of the Hebrew Language a modest reform.<ref name=\"KD\">[http://kdictionaries.com/kdn/kdn12-3spell.html Kernerman Dictionary News • Number 12 • July 2004]</ref>\n\n==Usage today==\nThere are three systems of spelling used for [[Modern Hebrew]].\n#'''Ktiv hasar''' (\"missing spelling\"): This [[defective script]] may be found in the [[Sefer Torah]] read in [[synagogue]]. It is sometimes considered to be [[anachronism|anachronistic]] in everyday life, although it is still sometimes found in newspapers and published books.<ref name=\"maamarim\">{{cite web |url = http://www.articles.co.il/print.php?id=46399 |first = Einat |last = Kedem|publisher = articles.co.il |title=כתיב מלא (בעיות), כתיב חסר (היגיון)}}</ref> This is the original Hebrew spelling. It is called the \"missing spelling\" because it does not use [[niqqud]].\n#'''[[Ktiv menuqad]]''' (\"dotted spelling\" or \"vowelized spelling\"): This system of spelling is called \"vowelized spelling\" and \"dotted spelling\" because unlike \"missing spelling,\" this system shows exactly how the vowels are in addition to using the dots system (\"[[niqqud|nekudot]]\"). It is rarely used in everyday life. However, it is used wherever someone wants their writings to be clear and unambiguous, such as [[children's books]], poetry, language instruction for newcomers, or ambiguous or foreign terms. However, it is very cumbersome and inconvenient in everyday life.\n#'''Ktiv male''' or '''[[Ktiv hasar niqqud]]''' (\"full spelling\" or \"spelling lacking niqqud\"): This is the dominant system of spelling in Israel, personal correspondence, movie subtitles, etc.<ref name=\"maamarim\" />  Ktiv Male is created to be a niqqud-less spelling that uses ''matres lectionis'' (consonant that are also used as vowels: [[aleph]], [[He (letter)|he]], waw, yodh) instead of the vowel pointers.\n\n===Examples===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Word\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ktiv haser\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ktiv menuqad\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Ktiv male (Ktiv haser niqqud)\n|-\n!English!!IPA\n|-\n| courage\n| {{IPA|/ˈˀomets/}}\n| {{Hebrew|אמץ}}\n| {{Hebrew|אֹמֶץ}}\n| {{Hebrew|אומץ}}\n|-\n| air\n| {{IPA|/aˈvir/}}\n| {{Hebrew|אויר}} <sup>1</sup>\n| {{Hebrew|אֲוִיר}}\n| {{Hebrew|אוויר}}\n|-\n| distribution\n| {{IPA|/ħaluˈqa/}}\n| {{Hebrew|חלקה}} <sup>2</sup>\n| {{Hebrew|חֲלֻקָּה}}\n| {{Hebrew|חלוקה}}\n|-\n| two\n| {{IPA|/ˈʃnajim/}}\n| {{Hebrew|שנים}} <sup>3</sup>\n| {{Hebrew|שְׁנַיִם}}\n| {{Hebrew|שניים}}\n|}\n\nTo illustrate the problem with Ktiv haser:<br>\n<sup>1</sup> spelled the same as {{Hebrew|אויר}} -  {{IPA|/U'jar/}} = \"was drawn\" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|אוּיָר}}<br>\n<sup>2</sup> spelled the same as {{Hebrew|חלקה}} -  {{IPA|/ħelˈqa/}} = \"land plot\" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|חֶלְקַה}} <br>\n<sup>3</sup> spelled the same as {{Hebrew|שנים}} -  {{IPA|/ˈʃanim/}} = \"years\" - in Ktiv menuqad {{Hebrew|שָׁנִים}}\n\n==Usage of multiple systems==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = Examples\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background = \n | footer    = \n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width     = \n | image1    = Kosher McDonalds.JPG\n | width1    = 235\n | caption1  = A kosher (הכשר \"the Kosher\") [[McDonald's]], with the word kosher spelled without niqqud.\n | image2    = Kosher McDonald's restaurant in Ramat-Gan.jpg\n | width2    = 205\n | caption2  = Another kosher (הכּשר \"the Kosher\") McDonald's, with the word kosher spelled with partial niqqud to reduce ambiguity.\n}}\nIn practice, many times two or more spelling systems are used in one text. The most common example of this is a word may be vowelized (using [[niqqud]], the \"dots\") partially, for instance with {{Hebrew|אוֹמץ}}, where only the vav ({{Hebrew|ו}}) is vowelized. This clarifies that the vowel is an \"o\" ({{Hebrew|וֹ}}) and not \"u\" ({{Hebrew|וּ}}). In addition, 3 letters (historically 6), can take a different sound depending on if there is a dot (called a [[dagesh]]) in the middle of the letter (a [[bet (letter)|bet]], [[Kaph|kaf]], and [[Pe (letter)|pe]]). In full spelling, the dot is not included, regardless if it is making one sound or the other. An example when a mixture of systems would be used is to clarify when the letter is taking a dagesh. An example of this is shown in the adjacent picture, where for the word kosher ({{Hebrew|כָּשֵׁר}} <small>(with niqqud)</small>, {{hebrew|כשר}} <small>(full spelling)</small>, {{IPA|/kaˈʃer/}}) may be written as כּשר (a mixture of the two systems) to be unambiguous that it is the letter כּ {{IPA-he|k|}} and not כ {{IPA-he|χ|}}. Words may be written in ''ktiv haser'' (\"missing spelling\") if it is unambiguous and clear enough (ex. חנכה {{IPA|/[[Hanukkah|ħanuˈka]]/}} instead of the \"full\" form חנוכה). In this case, the reader deciphers the word mostly by its context.\n\nAlso, some words are almost always written in the \"missing\" form (''ktiv haser'') in everyday life: לא ({{IPA|/lo/}}, no), אמא ({{IPA|/ima/}}, mother), אם ({{IPA|/im/}}, if), and כנרת ({{IPA|/kiˈneret/}}, [[Kinneret (archaeological site)|Kinneret]]).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hebrew grammar]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n\n[[Category:Hebrew language]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[Category:Language orthographies]]"

While H is a consonant in the Latin alphabet, the Greek and Cyrillic equivalents represent [[vowel]] sounds.\n\n==Origins==\nThe letter shape ultimately goes back to the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] for \"courtyard\", <hiero>O6</hiero>\nPossibly named {{Transl|sem|ḥasir}} in the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]].\n\nThe corresponding [[South Arabian alphabet|South Arabian letters]] are  [[File:himjar ha2.PNG|14px|ḥ]] ḥ and  [[File:himjar kha.PNG|14px|ḫ]] ḫ, corresponding to the [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez letters]] {{Transl|sem|Ḥawṭ}} ሐ and {{Transl|sem|Ḫarm}} ኀ.\n\nThis letter is usually transcribed as ''ḥ'', h with a dot underneath. In some romanization systems, a capital H is also used. The latter method has the advantage of being easy to type on a computer.\n\n==Arabic ḥāʾ==\n{{see also|خ}}\nThe letter is named {{lang|ar|حاء}} ''{{Transl|ar|DIN|ḥāʾ}}'' and is the sixth letter of the alphabet.

This occurs when [[Niqqud|patach gnuva]] comes under the Ḥet at the end of the word. The combination is then pronounced {{IPA|/-aχ/}} rather than {{IPA|/-χa/}}. For example: פתוח ({{IPA|/ˌpaˈtuaχ/}}), and תפוח ({{IPA|/ˌtaˈpuaχ/}}).\n\n===Variations===\nḤet, along with [[Aleph (Hebrew)|Aleph]], [[Ayin]], [[Resh]], and [[He (letter)|He]], cannot receive a [[dagesh]]. As pharyngeal fricatives are difficult for most English speakers to pronounce, loanwords are usually Anglicized to have {{IPA|/h/}}. Thus ''challah'' (חלה), pronounced by native Hebrew speakers as {{IPA|/χala/}} or {{IPA|/ħala/}} is pronounced {{IPA|/halə/}} by most English speakers, who cannot often perceive the difference between {{IPAblink|h}} and {{IPAblink|ħ}}.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], Ḥet represents the number eight.\n\nIn [[chat rooms]], [[Internet forum|online forums]], and [[Social networking service|social networking]] the letter Ḥet repeated (חחחחחחחחחח) denotes laughter, just as in English, in the saying 'Haha'.\n\n==Character encodings==\n{{charmap\n|05D7|name1=Hebrew Letter Het\n|062D|name2=Arabic Letter Hah\n|071A|name3=Syriac Letter Heth\n|0807|name4=Samaritan Letter Hit\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10388|name1=Ugaritic Letter Hota\n|10847|name2=Imperial Aramaic Letter Heth\n|10907|name3=Phoenician Letter Het\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*Ħ, ħ : [[H with stroke]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|ח}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]"

In [[ktiv male|writing without niqqud]], the letter yud is added more often as a [[mater lectionis]], than in writing with niqqud, The main exception is the i vowel in a syllable that ends with [[Shva#Shva Naḥ|shva naḥ]]. For example the words סִדְרָה (series) and סִדְּרָה (she organized) are pronounced identically in modern Hebrew, but in spelling without niqqud סִדְרָה is written סדרה because there is a shva naḥ on the letter ד, and סִדְּרָה is written סידרה.\n\nIn [[Yiddish orthography]] the ''{{transl|he|ḥiriq}}'' is placed under the ''yud'' {{angle bracket|{{Hebrew|יִ}}}}.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] and [[transliteration]] of the different Hiriqs in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].

It is not straightforward, however, to distinguish [[Israelite]]/[[Judahite]] scripts from others which were in use in the immediate area, most notably by the [[Moabites]] and [[Ammon]]ites.\n\nFollowing the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian exile]], [[Jew]]s gradually stopped using the Hebrew script, and instead adopted the \"square\" [[Aramaic script]] (another offshoot of the same family of scripts). This script, used for writing Hebrew, later evolved into the Jewish, or \"square\" script, that is still used today.<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1308&letter=A&search=Alphabet#3531 Jewish Encyclopedia: Alphabet, The Hebrew: Samaritan Alphabet]: \"While the Jews adopted the Aramaic alphabet, gradually abandoning their own, the Samaritans held fast to the original forms, in order to show themselves the veritable heirs of ancient Hebraism. ... It is the same character used in all the Samaritan books of to-day, and remains the only offshoot of the old Hebrew script extant, while the modern Hebrew Alphabet is of Aramaic origin.\"</ref> Closely related scripts were in use all over the Middle East for several hundred years, but following the rise of [[Christianity]] (and later, the rise of [[Islam]]), they gave way to the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] scripts, respectively.\n\nThe Hebrew alphabet was later adapted in order to write down the languages of the [[Jewish diaspora]] ([[Karaim language|Karaim]], [[Judeo-Arabic language|Judæo-Arabic]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], etc.), and was retained all the while in relatively unadapted form throughout the diaspora for Hebrew, which remained the language of Jewish law, scriptures and scholarship. The Hebrew alphabet was also retained as the alphabet used for writing down the [[Hebrew language]] during its [[revival of the Hebrew language|rebirth]] as an everyday modern language starting in the 18th to 19th century.\n\nAccording to one Jewish tradition,<ref>{{cite web|year=2002 |title = The Script of the Torah |publisher=Aishdas |location=Jerusalem, Israel |url=http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_pamphlet9.html}}, Sanhedrin 21b-22a</ref> however, the block script seen today in Hebrew Torah Scrolls, known as [[Ashuri alphabet|Kthav Ashurith]], was the original Hebrew script carved into the [[Ten Commandments]].<ref>''[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]'', Tractate Shabbat 104a, Tractate Megilla 2b. \"Rav Chisda says that the (final) mem and samech in the tablets were miraculously hanging in the air.\" This can only happen in Kthav Ashurith and not in Kthav Ivri.</ref> According to this opinion, the Ktav Ashurith was lost over time, as the masses used [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo-Hebrew]] and its cousins, known as Kthav Ivri, for day to day writing, just as Jews today use a non block script for everyday writing.<ref>''[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]'', Tractate Megilla 3a.</ref> \n\nAccording to the Talmud, the original script was known as Lebonae and was associated with the Samaritan community who continued to preserve the script even after the Jews switched to Ashurith.<ref>Klein, Reuven Chaim, ''[https://www.amazon.com/Lashon-HaKodesh-History-Holiness-Hebrew/dp/1937887367/ Lashon HaKodesh: History, Holiness, & Hebrew]''.

For example, here the ''Cholam'' appears after the letter ''[[Mem (letter)|mem]]'' {{angle bracket|{{Hebrew|מ}}}}&lrm;: <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|מֹ}}</span>. In [[modern Hebrew]] it indicates the [[mid back rounded vowel]], {{IPAblink|o̞}}, and is [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as an ''o''.\n\nThe [[mater lectionis]] letter which is usually employed with ''Cholam'' is [[Vav (letter)|vav]], although in a few words, the letters ''{{transl|he|[[aleph|alef]]}}'' or ''{{transl|he|[[He (letter)|he]]}}'' are used instead of ''{{transl|he|vav}}''. When it is used with a mater lectionis, the ''<span data-ve-clipboard-key=\"0.5243733149203813-1\"> </span>Cholam'' is called ''Cholam malei'' (<small>Modern:</small> {{IPA-he|ħoˈlam maˈle|}}, <small>Biblical:</small> {{IPA-he|ħoˈlam maˈle|}}, \"full {{transl|he|ḥolam}}\"), and without it the ''Cholam'' is called ''Cholam chaser'' (<small>Modern:</small> {{IPA-he|ħoˈlam ħaˈser|}}, <small>Biblical:</small> {{IPA-he|ħoˈlam ħaˈser|}}).\n\n==Appearance==\nCholam without ''mater lectionis'' after it or with the letter He, as in <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|פֹּה}}</span> ({{IPA|/po/}}, \"here\"), is written as a dot above the upper left corner of the letter after which it is pronounced. [[Letter-spacing]] is not supposed to be affected by it, although some buggy computer fonts may add an unneeded space before the next letter.\n\n[[File:Dor-Doar.svg|150px|thumb|left|In the word <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|דֹּאר}}</span>, the Biblical Hebrew spelling of the name [[Tel Dor|Dor]], the ''{{transl|he|alef}}'' is a ''mater lectionis'', and in traditional typography the Holam is written above the {{transl|he|alef}}'s right arm. In the word <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|דֹּאַר}}</span> ({{IPA|/ˈdo.aʁ/}}, \"mail\"), the ''{{transl|he|alef}}'' is a consonant (a [[glottal stop]]), under which appears the vowel ''{{transl|he|[[patah|pataḥ]]}}'', so the ''{{transl|he|ḥolam}}'' is written above the previous letter's upper left corner. Not all fonts actually implement these placement rules, however.]]\nIf the ''mater lectionis'' is ''{{transl|he|vav}}'', the ''Cholam'' appears above the ''{{transl|he|vav}}''. If the ''mater lectionis'' is ''{{transl|he|alef}}'', as in <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|לֹא}}</span> ({{IPA|/lo/}}, \"no\"), it is supposed to appear above the {{transl|he|alef}}'s right hand, although this is not implemented in all computer fonts, and does not always appear even in professionally typeset modern books, so ''Cholam'' with ''{{transl|he|alef}}'' may, in fact, appear in the same place as a regular ''Cholam chaser''. If the ''{{transl|he|alef}}'' itself is not a ''mater lectionis'', but a consonant, the ''Cholam'' appears in its regular place above the upper left corner of the previous letter, as in <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|תֹּאַר}}</span> ({{IPA|/ˈto.aʁ/}}, \"epithet\").\n\nIf ''Cholam chaser'' is written after ''{{transl|he|vav}}'', as in <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{Hebrew|לִגְוֺעַ}}</span> ({{IPA|/liɡˈvo.a/}}, \"to agonize\"), it may appear above the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'', or slightly further to the left; this varies between different fonts. In some fonts Holam merges with the Shin dot, in words such as <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|חֹשֶׁךְ}}</span> ({{IPA|/ˈħoʃeχ/}}, 'darkness') or with the Sin dot, as in <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|שֹׂבַע}}</span> ({{IPA|/ˈsova/}}, 'satiation'). (These dots may or may not appear merged on your screen, as that depends on your device's Hebrew font.)\n\n==Usage==\n''Cholam malei'' is, in general, the most common way to write the {{IPA|/o/}} sound in modern spelling with niqqud. If a word has ''Cholam malei'' in spelling with niqqud, the ''[[mater lectionis]]'' letter ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' is without any exception retained in spelling without niqqud, both according to the spelling rules of the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] and in common practice.\n\nThe use of ''Cholam chaser'' is restricted to certain word patterns, although many common words appear in them. In most cases the Academy's spelling rules mandate that the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' will be written even when the spelling with niqqud does not have it. The normative exceptions from this rule are listed below. It must also be noted that the Academy's standard is not followed perfectly by all speakers, and common deviations from it are also noted below.\n\nIn Biblical Hebrew the above rules are not followed consistently, and sometimes the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' is omitted or added.<ref>''Academy Decisions: Grammar, 2nd edition'', §1.3; {{Cite GHG|8|l|nologo=1}}</ref>\n\nFor further complications involving ''Kamatz katan'' and ''Hataf kamatz'', see the article [[Kamatz]].\n\n===Holam chaser which is written as ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' in text without niqqud===\n:''For details on the transcription of Hebrew, see [[Help:IPA/Hebrew]] and [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]]\n* In words, in which the penultimate syllable has the vowel {{IPA|/o/}} and is stressed (sometimes called ''[[segolate]]''): \n** <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|קֹטֶר}}</span> ('diameter') {{IPA|/ˈkoteʁ/}}\n** <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|זֹהַר}}</span> ('radiance', ''[[Zohar]]''), {{IPA|/ˈzohaʁ/}}\n** <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|נֹגַהּ}}</span> ('brightness', ''Nogah''), {{IPA|/noˈɡa/}}\n** <span style=\"font-size:125%\">{{script/Hebrew|דֹּאַר}}</span> ('mail'), {{IPA|/ˈdo.aʁ/}} or {{IPA|/ˈdoʔaʁ/}}. \n: Some people tend to spell some of these words without the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'', e.g. <span style=\"font-size:125%\">דאר</span> instead of <span style=\"font-size:125%\">דואר</span>, although the Academy mandates <span style=\"font-size:125%\">דואר</span>.

Modern [[diminutive]] forms of Moshe, such as ''Moshiko'' (מושיקו) are written with ''{{transl|he|vav}}''.</ref> and ''[[Shlomo]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|שְׁלֹמֹה}}&lrm;)<ref>A common modern [[diminutive]] version of this name is regularly spelled שלומי (''Shlomi'').</ref> are never written with ''{{transl|he|vav}}''. ''[[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shilo]]''<!-- it's OK that it links to a disambiguation page --> ({{script/Hebrew|שִׁילֹה}}) is sometimes written with ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' in the Bible, but always with He in modern Hebrew. Note also that the adjectives {{script/Hebrew|פַּרְעוֹנִי}}&lrm;, {{script/Hebrew|שִׁילוֹנִי}} are written with ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' and with a nun in the suffix.\n* The name ''[[Aharon (given name)|Aharon]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|אַהֲרֹן}}) is spelled with ''Cholam chaser'' in the Bible. In modern Hebrew both אהרן and אהרון are used.\n* The name ''[[Noah]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|נֹחַ}}) is spelled with ''Cholam chaser'' in the Bible, but it is sometimes written with the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' in the Mishna<ref>For example, in ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'' 5:2 in the [[Kaufmann manuscript]].</ref> and in modern Hebrew.\n* Several other names of places and people are spelled with Holam and Alef in the Bible include ''[[Yoshiyahu]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|יֹאשִׁיָּהוּ}}, ''Josiah''), ''[[Tel Dor|Dor]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|דֹּאר}}, in modern Hebrew {{script/Hebrew|דּוֹר}}) and ''No Amon'' ({{script/Hebrew|נֹא אָמוֹן}}, the Hebrew name of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]).\n* The word {{script/Hebrew|כֹּהֵן}} ('priest'), {{IPA|/koˈhen/}} is spelled with ''Cholam chaser'' in the Bible. It is a common Jewish last name, ''[[Cohen (surname)|Cohen]]''. The Academy mandates ''Cholam malei'' for the noun {{script/Hebrew|כּוֹהֵן}}, but allows the omission of ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' for spelling the personal name.<ref>''Academy Decisions: Grammar, 2nd edition'', §1.3 fn. 55.</ref>\n* Some personal names, such as ''Ohad'' ({{script/Hebrew|אֹהַד}}), ''Zohar'' ({{script/Hebrew|זֹהַר}}) and ''Nogah'' ({{script/Hebrew|נֹגַהּ}}), are sometimes spelled without ''{{transl|he|vav}}'' in modern writing without niqqud, although this varies from person to person.\n* [[God]]'s name ''[[Adonai]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}}) is written with ''Cholam chaser'' to distinguish it from the word \"Lord\" ({{script/Hebrew|אָדוֹן}}) used for humans.<ref>According to The [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon.</ref> When the ''[[Tetragrammaton]]'' is written with niqqud, it follows that of [[Adonai]], so it is written with ''Cholam chaser'', too. For religious reasons writing Adonai and the Tetragrammaton is avoided in modern religious texts except in direct quotes from the Bible. They rarely appear in secular modern Hebrew texts and their spelling there is inconsistent.\n* The name ''[[Elohim]]'' ({{script/Hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}}) is written with ''Cholam chaser'' in the Bible, although its singular form Eloah ({{script/Hebrew|אֱלוֹהַּ}}) is usually written with ''Cholam malei''. In modern Hebrew ''Elohim'' is a common word for \"God\" and it is usually spelled with the ''{{transl|he|vav}}'', which is also the Academy's recommendation.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] and [[transliteration]] of the different ''Cholams'' in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].

The exact shape varies between different manuscripts and printed editions. In many manuscripts, a reversed {{lang|he|nun}} is found, referred to as a \"{{lang|he|nun hafucha}}\" by the [[Masoretes]]. In some earlier printed editions, they are shown as the standard {{lang|he|nun}} upside down or rotated, presumably because the printer did not want to design a new rare character. Recent scholarly editions of the Masoretic text show the reversed {{lang|he|nun}} as described by the Masoretes. In some manuscripts, however, other symbols are occasionally found instead. These are sometimes referred to in rabbinical literature as \"simaniyot\" (markers).\n\nIn the [[Torah]], the inverted {{lang|he|nuns}} frame the text:\n{{quote|Whenever the ark set out, Moses said, \"Rise up, Lord!

One opinion states that it would appear in another location which discusses the order of tribal column, with the position of the Ark already stated there.\n\nThe 85-letter text found between the {{lang|he|nuns}} is also said to be denoted because it is the model for the fewest number of letters which constitute a 'text' which one would be required to save from fire due to its holiness. It also suggests that the inverted {{lang|he|nuns}} may suggest the Hebrew word נֵר ''ner'', meaning 'a light'.<ref>[http://www.oztorah.com/2007/05/inverted-nun-bhaalotcha/ Inverted Nun – B'ha'alot'cha]</ref>\n\n\nThe tractate [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] in the [[Talmud]] says regarding the inverted {{lang|he|nuns}}:\n\n{{quote|It is taught in a [[baraita]]: \"{{lang|he|ויהי בנסוע הארון ויאמר משה}}\" &ndash; The Holy One, blessed be He, placed signs above and below this portion, to say that this is not its place.

In [[modern Hebrew]] (Sephardi/Israeli), it usually indicates the [[phoneme]] {{IPAslink|ä|a}} which is close to the \"[[a]]\" sound in the English word ''f'''a'''r'' and is [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as ''a&#x202f;''. In these cases, its sound is identical to the sound of ''{{transl|he|[[pataḥ]]&#x202f;}}'' in [[modern Hebrew]]. In a minority of cases it indicates the phoneme {{IPAslink|o̞|o}}, equal to the sound of ''{{transl|he|[[holam|ḥolam]]}}''.\n\n==Qamatz Qaṭan, Qamatz Gadol, Ḥataf Qamatz==\n\n===Qamatz Qaṭan vs. Qamatz Gadol===\n{{anchor|Qamatz Qaṭan}}{{anchor|Qamatz Gadol}}\nThe Hebrew of the late centuries BCE and early centuries of the [[Common Era]] had a system with five [[phoneme|phonemic]] long vowels {{IPA|/aː eː iː oː uː/}} and five short vowels {{IPA|/a e i o u/}}.\n\nIn the later dialects of the 1st millennium CE, phonemic vowel length disappeared, and instead was automatically determined by the context, with vowels pronounced long in [[syllable#open syllable|open syllables]] and short in closed ones.  However, the previous vowel phonemes merged in various ways that differed from dialect to dialect:\n* In [[Tiberian Hebrew]], which underlies the written system of vowels, short {{IPA|/a/}} became {{IPA|[a]}} (indicated by ''{{transl|he|pataḥ}}''); long {{IPA|/oː/}} became {{IPA|[o]}} (indicated by ''{{transl|he|[[holam|ḥolam]]}}''); while {{IPA|/aː/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} both merged into an in-between sound {{IPA|[ɔ]}} (similar to the vowel in English \"caught\" without the [[cot-caught merger]]), which was indicated by qamatz.\n* In the [[Babylonian vocalization]], however, short and long variants simply merged, with {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}} becoming [a], while {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}} became [o]; and this system underlies the pronunciation of [[Modern Hebrew]].\n\nThe result is that the vowel written with qamatz might be pronounced as either [a] or [o], depending on historical origin.  It is often said that the two sounds can be distinguished by context:\n*The qamatz sound of {{IPA|[o]}}, known as '''{{transl|he|Qamatz Qaṭan}}''' ({{lang-he-n|קָמַץ קָטָן}}, {{IPA-he|kaˈmats kaˈtan|IPA}}, \"small qamatz\") occurs in a \"closed syllable\", i.e. one which ends in a consonant marked with a [[Shva|shwa nakh]] (zero vowel) or with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh Ḥazak|{{transl|he|dagesh ḥazaq}}]] (which indicates that the consonant was pronounced [[gemination|geminated]], i.e. doubled);\n*The qamatz sound of {{IPA|[a]}}, known as '''{{transl|he|Qamatz Gadol}}''' ({{lang-he-n|קָמַץ גדול}} {{IPA-he|kaˈmats ɡaˈdol|}}, \"big qamatz\") occurs in an \"open syllable\", i.e. any other circumstance: one which ends in a consonant followed by a normal vowel, a consonant at the end of a word and with no vowel marking, or a consonant marked with a [[shva|shwa na]] (originally pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}}).\n\nUnfortunately, the two varieties of shwa are written identically, and pronounced identically in Modern Hebrew; as a result, there is no reliable way to distinguish the two varieties of qamatz when followed by a vowel marked with a shwa. (In some cases, Biblical texts are marked with a ''metheg'' or other [[cantillation]] mark that helps to indicate which pronunciation is intended, but this usage is not consistent, and in any case such marks are absent in non-Biblical texts.)\n\nAn example of the ''qamatz qatan'' is the Modern Hebrew word {{Hebrew|תָּכְנִית}} ({{IPA-he|toχˈnit|}}, \"program\").\n\nAccording to the standard [[Hebrew spelling]] rules as published by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], words which have a qamatz qatan in their base form must be written without a [[Waw (letter)|vav]], hence the standard vowel-less spelling of {{Hebrew|תָּכְנִית}} is {{Hebrew|תכנית}}.  In practice, however, Modern Hebrew words containing a qamatz qatan do add a ''vav'' {{angle bracket|{{Hebrew|ו}}}} to indicate the {{IPA|[o]}} pronunciation; hence the \"nonstandard\" spelling {{Hebrew|תוכנית}} is common in newspapers and is even used in several dictionaries, for example [[Rav Milim]]. Words, which in their base form have a [[holam|{{transl|he|ḥolam}}]] that changes to {{transl|he|qamatz qaṭan}} in declination, retain the ''vav'' in vowel-less spelling: the noun {{Hebrew|חֹפֶשׁ}} ({{IPA-he|ˈχofeʃ|}}, \"freedom\") is spelled {{Hebrew|חופש}} in vowel-less texts; the adjective {{Hebrew|חָפְשִׁי}} ({{IPA-he|χofˈʃi|}}, \"free\") is spelled {{Hebrew|חופשי}} in vowel-less text, despite the use of qamatz qatan, both according to the standard spelling and in common practice.\n\nSome books print the {{transl|he|qamatz qaṭan}} differently, although it is not consistent. For example, in siddur [[Rinat Yisrael]] the vertical line of qamatz qatan is longer. In a book of ''[[Psalms]]'' used by some [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov hassidim]] the qamatz qatan is bolder. In the popular niqqud textbook ''Niqqud halakha le-maase'' by [[Nisan Netser]], the qamatz qatan is printed as an encircled qamatz for didactic purposes.\n\n[[Unicode]] defines the code point {{unichar|05C7|HEBREW POINT QAMATS QATAN}}, although its usage is not required.\n\n===Ḥaṭaf Qamatz===\n'''{{transl|he|Ḥaṭaf Qamatz}}''' ({{lang-he-n|חֲטַף קָמָץ|}}, {{IPA-he|χaˈtaf kaˈmats|IPA}}) is a \"reduced qamatz\". Like qamatz qatan, it is pronounced {{IPAblink|o̞|o}}, but the rationale for its usage is different: it replaces the [[shva]] on letters which require a shva according to the grammar, but where the traditional pronunciation is {{IPAblink|o̞|o}}. This mostly happens with gutturals, for example in {{Hebrew|אֳרָנִים}} ({{IPA-he|oʁaˈnim|}}, \"pines\", the plural form of {{Hebrew|אֹרֶן}}, {{IPA-he|ˈoʁen|}}), but occasionally also on other letters, for example  {{Hebrew|שֳׁרָשִׁים}} ({{IPA-he|ʃoʁaˈʃim|}}, \"roots\", the plural of {{Hebrew|שֹׁרֶשׁ}} {{IPA-he|ˈʃoʁeʃ|}}) and {{Hebrew|צִפֳּרִים}} ({{IPA-he|tsipoˈʁim|}}, \"birds\", the plural of {{Hebrew|צִפּוֹר}} ({{IPA-he|tsiˈpoʁ|}}).\n\n==Pronunciation and transliteration==\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] and [[transliteration]] of the different qamatzes in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].

It has a particular use in the [[Sindhi language]] of Pakistan, where it represents the unaspirated /k/, in contrast to the [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspirated]] /kʰ/, which is written using the \"normal\" kāf {{lang|sd|ک}} (called ''[[keheh]]'').\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ڪ}}\n\nIn [[varieties of Arabic]] ''kāf'' is almost universally pronounced as the [[voiceless velar plosive]] {{IPA|/k/}}, but in [[Palestinian Arabic|rural Palestinian]] and [[Iraqi Arabic|Iraqi]], it is pronounced as a [[voiceless postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|[t͡ʃ]}}.\nIn Moroccan Arabic it's pronounced as k, g or ch.\n\n===Use in literary Arabic===\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]], ''kāf'' is used as a prefix meaning ''\"like\"'', ''\"as\"'', or ''\"as though\"''. For example, {{lang|ar|كَطَائِر}} ({{IPA|/katˤaːʔir/}}), meaning \"like a bird\" or \"as though a bird\" (as in Hebrew, above). The prefix {{lang|ar|كَـ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ka}}'' is one of the Arabic words for \"like\" or \"as\" (the other, {{lang|ar|مِثْل}} {{IPA|/miθl/}}, is unrelated). The {{IPA|/ka/}} prefix sometimes has been added to other words to create fixed constructions. For instance, it is prefixed to {{lang|ar|ذٰلِك}} {{IPA|/ðaːlik/}} \"this, that\" to form the fixed word {{lang|ar|كَذٰلِك}} {{IPA|/kaðaːlik/}} \"like so, likewise.\"\n\n''kāf'' is used as a [[possessive]] suffix for second-person singular nouns (feminine taking ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāf-kasrah}}'' {{lang|ar|كِ}}, {{IPA|/ki/}} and masculine ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāf-fatḥah}}'' {{lang|ar|كَ}} {{IPA|/ka/}}); for instance, {{lang|ar|كِتَاب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitāb}}'' (\"book\") becomes {{lang|ar|كِتَابُكَ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitābuka}}'' (\"your book\", where the person spoken to is masculine) {{lang|ar|كِتَابُكِ}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitābuki}}'' (\"your book\", where the person spoken to is feminine). At the ends of sentences and often in conversation the final vowel is suppressed, and thus {{lang|ar|كِتَابُك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitābuk}}'' (\"your book\"). In several varieties of vernacular Arabic, however, the ''kāf'' with no [[harakat]] is the standard second-person possessive, with the literary Arabic harakah shifted to the letter ''before'' the ''kāf'': thus masculine \"your book\" in these varieties is {{lang|ar|كِتَابَك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitābak}}'' and feminine \"your book\" {{lang|ar|كِتَابِك}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kitābik}}''.\n\n==Hebrew kaf==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">כ</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:28pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">כ</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">כ</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Kaf handwriting.svg|24px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Kaf-nonfinal Rashi.png|35px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{Hebrew|כָּף}}</big>\n\n===Hebrew pronunciation===\n{{main|Modern Hebrew phonology}}\nThe letter kaf is one of the six letters which can receive a [[dagesh]] kal. The other five are [[Beth (letter)|bet]], [[Gimel (letter)|gimel]], [[daleth]], [[Pe (letter)|pe]], and [[Taw (letter)|tav]] (see [[Hebrew alphabet#Ancient Hebrew|Hebrew Alphabet]] for more about these letters).\n\nThere are two orthographic variants of this letter which alter the pronunciation:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! colspan=1 | Name\n!! colspan=1 | Symbol\n!! colspan=1 | [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n!! colspan=1 | [[Transliteration]]\n!! colspan=1 | Example\n|-\n| Kaf\n| align=center | {{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-size:200%;\">כּ</span>}}  \n| align=\"center\" | {{IPA|[k]}}\n| align=\"center\" | k\n| align=\"center\" | '''k'''angaroo\n|-\n| Khaf\n| align=center | {{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-size:200%;\">כ</span>}}  \n| align=\"center\" | {{IPAblink|χ}} or {{IPAblink|x}}\n| align=\"center\" | ch or kh\n| align=\"center\" | lo'''ch'''\n|-\n|}\n\n====Kaf with the dagesh====\nWhen the kaph has a \"dot\" in its center, known as a [[dagesh]], it represents a [[voiceless velar plosive]] ({{IPA|[k]}}). There are various rules in [[Hebrew grammar]] that stipulate when and why a dagesh is used.\n\n====Kaf without the dagesh (khaf)====\nWhen this letter appears as {{Hebrew|כ}} ''without'' the [[dagesh]] (\"dot\") in its center it represents {{IPAblink|χ}}, like the ''ch'' in German \"Bach\".\n\nIn [[Hebrew language|modern Israeli Hebrew]] the letter [[Heth (letter)|heth]] is often pronounced as a {{IPAblink|χ}}, but many communities have differentiated between these letters as in other Semitic languages.\n\n====Final form of kaf====\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various Print Fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br/>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi Script|Rashi<br/>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>[[Serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospace]]d</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">ך</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:28pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">ך</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">ך</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Kaf-final handwriting.svg|21px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Kaf-final Rashi.png|35px]]\n|}\nIf the letter is at the end of a word the symbol is drawn differently.  However, it does not change the pronunciation or [[transliteration]] in any way.   The name for the letter is ''final kaf'' ({{lang|he-Latn|kaf sofit}}). Four additional Hebrew letters take final forms: [[tsade|tsadi]], [[mem]], [[nun (letter)|nun]], and [[pe (letter)|pei]]. Kaf/khaf is the only Hebrew letter that can take a vowel in its word-final form which is pronounced after the consonant, that vowel being the [[niqqud|qamatz]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! colspan=1 | Name\n!! colspan=1 | Alternate name\n!! colspan=1 | Symbol\n|-\n| Final kaf\n| Kaf sofit\n| align=center | {{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-size:200%; line-height:normal\">ךּ</span>}}  \n|-\n| Final khaf\n| Khaf sofit\n| align=center | {{Hebrew|1=<span style=\"font-size:200%; line-height:normal\">ך</span>}}  \n|-\n|}\n\n===Significance of kaph in Hebrew===\nIn [[gematria]], kaph represents the number 20.

Kubutz is a short ''u'' and Shuruk is long ''u''.<ref>דקדוקי אביע\"ה, a classic work on pronunciation; a summary can be found in the preface in the common Sefardic E\"M Siddur ''Avodath Hashem''</ref>.  In an alternate, Ashkenazi naming, the Kubutz (three diagonal dots) is called \"Shuruk\" and Shuruk is called \"Melopum\" ({{Hebrew|מלאפום}}).\n\n==Appearance==\nThe '''Kubutz''' sign is represented by three diagonal dots \"ֻ\" underneath a letter.\n\nThe '''Shuruk''' is the letter Vav with a dot in the middle and to the left of it. The dot is identical to the grammatically different signs [[Dagesh]] and [[Mappiq]], but in a fully vocalized text it is practically impossible to confuse them: Shuruk itself is a vowel sign, so if the letter before the Waw doesn't have its own vowel sign, then the Waw with the dot is a Shuruk and otherwise it is a Waw with a Dagesh or a Mappiq. Furthermore, the Mappiq only appears at the end of the word and only in the letter [[He (letter)|He]] (ה) in modern Hebrew and in the Bible it sometimes appears in [[Aleph]] (א) and only in some Bible manuscripts it appears in the letter Waw, for example in the word גֵּוּ ('[[torso]]') {{IPA|[ɡev]}}.<ref>{{Cite GHG|8|m|nologo=1}} footnote. In modern Hebrew letter this word is written גֵּו.</ref> Compare for example Waw with Dagesh in מְגֻוָּן {{IPA|[məɡuvˈvan]}} 'varied' (without niqqud: מגוון) as opposed to Shuruk in מִגּוּן {{IPA|[miɡˈɡun]}} 'protection' (without niqqud: מיגון); see also [[Waw (letter)#Pronunciation|orthographic variants of Waw]].\n\n==Name==\nIn older grammar books the Kubbutz is called '''Qibbûṣ Pum''' etc. (קִבּוּץ פּוּם), ''compression ''or'' contraction of the mouth''. This was shortened to '''Qibbûṣ''' (also transliterated as '''Kibbutz''' etc.) but later all the names of vowel signs were changed to include their own sound in their first syllable.<ref>{{Cite GHG|8|d|nologo=1}}</ref> This way K'''i'''butz changed to K'''u'''butz, and this is the common name today, although the name \"Kibutz\" is still occasionally used, for example by the Academy of the Hebrew Language.<ref name=\"academy-decisions-1-3\">''Academy Decisions: Grammar'', §1.3.</ref>\n\nShuruk was earlier called '''Shureq''' (שׁוּרֶק), but this name is rarely used today.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Shuruk in modern texts===\n''For details on the sounds of Hebrew, see [[Help:IPA/Hebrew]] and [[Modern Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]]''\n\nThe Shuruk is used to mark {{IPA|[u]}} at the last syllable of the word and in open syllables in the middle of the word:\n* שָׁמְרוּ ('they guarded') {{IPA|[ʃaˈməʁu]}}\n* חָתוּל ('cat') {{IPA|[χaˈtul]}}\n* תְּשׁוּבָה ('answer', ''[[Tshuva]]'') {{IPA|[təʃuˈva]}}\n\nRegardless of syllable type, Shuruk is always written in foreign words and names if they weren't adapted to Hebrew word structure (''mishkal''):\n* אוּנִיבֶרְסִיטָה ('university') {{IPA|[universita]}}\n* הַמְבּוּרְג ('[[Hamburg]]') {{IPA|[hambuʁɡ]}}\n* אוּקְרָאִינָה ('[[Ukraine]]') {{IPA|[ukʁaʔina]}} (closed syllable)\n\nDifferently from all other niqqud signs, a Shuruk can stand on its own in the beginning of the word and not after a consonant when it is the [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] ו־ ''and''. Hebrew one-letter words are written together with the next word and their pronunciation may change according to the first letters of that word. The basic vocalization of this conjunction is ''[[Shva na]]'' (וְ־ {{IPA|[və]}}), but before the [[labial consonant]]s [[Bet (letter)|Bet]] (ב), [[Waw (letter)|Waw]] (ו), [[Mem (letter)|Mem]] (מ) and [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] (פ), and before any letter with ''[[Shva]]'' (except [[Yodh]]) it becomes a Shuruk (וּ־ {{IPA|[u]}}). This is the consistent vocalization in the Bible<ref>{{Cite GHG|26|a|nologo=1}}, {{Cite GHG|104|e|notitle=1}}</ref> and in normative modern Hebrew, but in spoken modern Hebrew it is not consistently productive and the conjunction may simply remain וְ־ in these cases.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}<!-- This is a properly \"citation needed\" case - i'll find documentation for it soon enough. --> It is not reflected in writing without niqqud. Examples:\n* וּמִכְתָּב ('and a letter') {{IPA|[umiχˈtav]}}\n* וּוֶרֶד ('and a rose') {{IPA|[uˈveʁed]}}\n* וּסְפָרִים ('and books') {{IPA|[usəfaˈʁim]}}\n\n===Kubutz in modern texts===\nKubutz is used only in native Hebrew words and in words with foreign roots that were adapted to Hebrew word structure (''mishkal''), for example מְפֻרְמָט ('[[Disk formatting|formatted (disk)]]') {{IPA|[məfuʁˈmat]}} (without niqqud מפורמט). It is written in closed syllables which do not appear at the end of the word. A closed syllable is one which ends in a consonant with [[Shva nakh]] (zero vowel) or in a consonant with [[Dagesh khazak]] (essentially two identical consonants, the first of which has Shva nakh).\n\n====Kubutz in base forms of nouns====\nCommon noun patterns in which Kubutz appears in the base form are:<ref>Based on the list of noun patterns (''mishkalim'') in the [[Even-Shoshan Dictionary]].</ref>\n* /CuCCaC/ where the middle CC is a double consonant (with Dagesh): סֻלָּם ('scale') {{IPA|[sulˈlam]}}, אֻכָּף ('saddle') {{IPA|[ʔukˈkaf]}}. Without niqqud: סולם&lrm;, אוכף.\n* /CuCCa/: חֻלְדָּה ('rat') {{IPA|[χulˈda]}}, without niqqud: חולדה. To this pattern belong also the words whose roots' second and third letter are the same and merge into one consonant with Dagesh: סֻכָּה ('hut', ''[[Sukka]]'') {{IPA|[sukˈka]}}, root ס־כ־כ, without niqqud: סוכה.\n* /CəCuCCa/ where the last CC is a double consonant (with Dagesh): נְקֻדָּה ('point') {{IPA|[nəqudˈda]}}. The Dagesh is not realized in modern Hebrew, but if the letter with the Dagesh is [[Bet (letter)|Bet]] (ב&lrm;), [[Kaph]] (כ&lrm;) or [[Pe (letter)|Pe]] (פ), then it is pronounced as a [[stop consonant]]: כְּתֻבָּה ('[[Ketubba]]', '[[prenuptial agreement]]') {{IPA|[kətubˈba]}}, חֲנֻכָּה ('[[housewarming]]', [[Hanukka]]) {{IPA|[ħanukˈka]}}.<ref name=\"schwa2a-guttural\">{{IPA|[ə]}} changes to {{IPA|[a]}} on a guttural letter.</ref> Without niqqud: נקודה&lrm;, חנוכה.\n* /CuCCan/: שֻׁלְחָן ('desk') {{IPA|[ʃulˈχan]}}, without niqqud: שולחן.\n* /CuCCoCet/ with Dagesh in the middle letter of the root: כֻּתֹּנֶת ('coat', 'garment') {{IPA|[kutˈtonet]}}; with a four letter root: גֻּלְגֹּלֶת ('skull') {{IPA|[ɡulˈɡolet]}}.

All these words are written with Waw in texts without niqqud: דובים&lrm;, דוב&lrm;, כולם&lrm;, כול&lrm;.<ref>As an exception, כול is written without Waw when it is in [[construct state]], compare: כל־האנשים ('all the people'), but היא יודעת הכול ('she knows all'). In any case, this is in regard to {{IPA|[o]}}; for {{IPA|[u]}}, there are no exceptions.</ref>\n* Declined forms of words which have the pattern /CaCoC/ in the singular and become /CəCuCCim/ in the plural: כָּתֹם ('orange', {{IPA|[kaˈtom]}}), pl. כְּתֻמִּים ({{IPA|[kətumˈmim]}}), עָגֹל ('round', {{IPA|[ʕaˈɡol]}}), pl. עֲגֻלִּים ({{IPA|[ʕaɡulˈlim]}}).<ref name=\"schwa2a-guttural\" /> Without niqqud: כתום&lrm;, כתומים&lrm;, עגול&lrm;, עגולים&lrm;.

For example, base form: מַשְׂכֹּרֶת (''wage'', {{IPA|[masˈkoʁet]}}); declined: מַשְׂכָּרְתָּהּ {{IPA|[maskoʁˈtah]}} or מַשְׂכֻּרְתָּהּ {{IPA|[maskuʁˈtah]}}, both being normative spellings and pronunciations of ''her wage''.<ref name=\"academy-decisions-1-3\" /> Without niqqud, in any case: משכורת&lrm;, משכורתה.\n\nThe plural form of words which end in ־וּת was in the past written with a Kubutz in texts with niqqud: sg. חָנוּת ('shop'), {{IPA|[ħaˈnut]}}, pl. חֲנֻיּוֹת {{IPA|[ħanujˈjot]}}. In March 2009 the Academy decided to simplify the niqqud of such words by eliminating the Dagesh in the letter [[yodh]] and changing the Kubutz to Shuruk: חֲנוּיוֹת&lrm;.<ref>[http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision3.html#a Summary of meeting 308, March 16, 2009]; שתי החלטות בדקדוק. דורון יעקב, [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/sifriyya/akadem/Documents/akad40.pdf אקדם – ידיעון האקדמיה ללשון העברית, גיליון 40, שבט תש\"ע]</ref> This doesn't change the pronunciation, since in modern Hebrew the dagesh is not realized anyway. The spelling without niqqud is also unchanged: חנויות.\n\n====Kubutz in verbs====\nKubutz is common in verbs in the passive [[binyan]]im Pual and Huf'al and in some conjugated forms of verbs whose roots' second and third letters are the same.\n\n=====Pual=====\nVerbs and participles in the passive [[binyan]] Pual usually have a Kubutz in the first letter of the root: כֻּנַּס ('was gathered') {{IPA|[kunˈnas]}}, מקֻבָּל ('acceptable') {{IPA|[məqubˈbal]}}, without niqqud: כונס&lrm;, מקובל.\n\nIf the second letter of the root is one of the [[guttural consonant]]s [[Aleph]] (א), [[He (letter)|He]] (ה), [[Ayin]] (ע) and [[Resh]] (ר) - but not [[Heth]] (ח) -, the Kubutz changes to ''holam haser'' in a process called ''tashlum dagesh'' (תשלום דגש&lrm;): יְתֹאַר ('will be described') {{IPA|[yətoˈʔaʁ]}}, מְדֹרָג ('graded') {{IPA|[mədoˈʁaɡ]}}; without niqqud: יתואר&lrm;, מדורג.\n\n=====Huf'al=====\nKubutz is used in the prefixes of verbs and participles in the passive [[binyan]] Huf'al: הֻרְדַּם ('was put to sleep') {{IPA|[huʁˈdam]}}, מֻסְדָּר ('organized') {{IPA|[musˈdaʁ]}}. It is also correct to write words in this binyan with ''[[Kamatz katan]]'' in the prefix: הָרְדַּם&lrm;, מָסְדָּר ({{IPA|[hoʁˈdam]}}, {{IPA|[mosˈdaʁ]}}).<ref>{{Cite GHG|53|b|nologo=1}}</ref> Without niqqud, in any case: הורדם&lrm;, מוסדר.\n\nThe Kubutz is used only if the prefix is a closed vowel, which is the majority of cases. With some root patterns, however, it becomes an open vowel, in which case a Shuruk is written:\n* Roots whose first letter is [[Yodh]] (י&lrm;): הוּטַב ('become better') {{IPA|[huˈtav]}}, root י־ט־ב&lrm;; הוּרַד ('brought down') {{IPA|[huˈrad]}}, root י־ר־ד.\n* Roots whose middle letter is [[Waw (letter)|Waw]] (ו) or [[Yodh]] (י&lrm;): הוּקַם ('erected') {{IPA|[huˈqam]}}, root קום&lrm;; הוּבַן ('understood') {{IPA|[huˈvan]}}, root בין.\n* Roots whose second and third letter are the same: הוּגַן ('protected') {{IPA|[huˈɡan]}}, root גננ.\n\nIn many roots whose first letter is [[Nun (letter)|Nun]] (נ) and in six roots whose first two letters are [[Yodh]] (י) and [[Tsade]] (צ), this letter is assimilated with the second letter of the root, which in turn takes a complementary Dagesh. This makes the syllable of the prefix closed, so accordingly the prefix takes Kubutz: הֻסַּע ('driven') {{IPA|[husˈsaʕ]}}, root נסע&lrm;; הֻצַּג ('presented') {{IPA|[hut͡sˈt͡saɡ]}}, root יצג. Without niqqud: הוסע&lrm;, הוצג.\n\n=====Double roots=====\nKubutz appears in some conjugated forms of verbs with roots whose second and third letter are the same (also called double stems and ע\"ע). Most of them are rarely used.\n\nExamples with verb סָבַב ('turn') {{IPA|[saˈvav]}} in the future tense of binyan Qal:\n* אֲסֻבֵּךְ {{IPA|[asubˈbeχ]}} (1 sg. with possessive suffix)\n* תְּסֻבֶּינָה {{IPA|[təsubˈbena]}} (3 pl. f.)\n\n===In older texts===\nIn the Bible ''Shuruk'' and ''Kubutz'' are not always used according to the above consistent rules and sometimes quite arbitrarily.<ref>{{Cite GHG|8|l|nologo=1}}.</ref> For example, in {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|2:19||}} appear the words: וּמְשֻׁבוֹתַיִךְ תּוֹכִחֻךְ ('and your backslidings shall reprove you', {{IPA|[uməʃuvoˈtajiχ toχiˈħuχ]}}). Kubutz is used in both of them, even though in the first word the syllable is not closed and the Waw is even a part of this word's root, and in the second word the {{IPA|[u]}} sound is in the last syllable. Contrariwise, a Shuruk is used in closed syllables where a Kubutz would be expected, for example in {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:25||}} - עֲרוּמִּים ('naked', {{IPA|[ʕarumˈmim]}}, the plural of עָרֹם, {{IPA|[ʕaˈrom]}}), instead of the more regular עֲרֻמִּים (in modern Hebrew without niqqud: ערומים).\n\nThe word נְאֻם (''speech'', {{IPA|[nəum]}}) is written with Kubutz in the Bible. It was previously frequently used to mark the signature on documents (e.g. נאם יוסף לוי - 'so says Yosef Levi'), but this usage is rare in modern Hebrew, where this word usually means \"(a delivered) speech\" and is regularly spelled with Shuruk - נְאוּם. The name יְהוֹשֻׁעַ ('[[Joshua]]', {{IPA|[jəhoˈʃuaʕ]}}) is spelled with Kubutz in the Bible, but usually יְהוֹשׁוּעַ in modern Hebrew.\n\nIn the first decades of the [[revival of the Hebrew language]] it was common in spelling without niqqud not to write the Waw in words which were written with Kubutz. For example, in the printed works of [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] the word מרבה may mean מְרֻבֶּה ('multiplied', {{IPA|[məʁubˈbe]}}) and מַרְבֶּה ('multiplying', {{IPA|[maʁˈbe]}}).<ref>There are several other possible readings, but this is enough for the example.</ref> This practice disappeared in the middle of twentieth century and now מְרֻבֶּה is written מרובה and מַרְבֶּה is written מרבה.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nIn Biblical Hebrew both signs may have indicated the same sound and when the Bible manuscripts were vocalized Kubutz was simply used where the letter Waw was not written,<ref>Preliminary Remark to {{Cite GHG|8|nologo=1}}</ref> although other possibilities were proposed by researchers, most commonly that the vowels had different [[Length (phonetics)|length]] (quantity), Kubutz being shorter,<ref>{{Cite GHG|9|n|nologo=1}}</ref> or that the signs indicated different sounds (quality), Kubutz being more rounded,<ref>{{Cite GHG|9|o|nologo=1}}</ref> although this is a matter of debate. It is also possible that Biblical Hebrew had several varieties of {{IPA|[u]}} sounds, which were not consistently represented in writing.<ref name=\"rabin-short-vowels\">[[Chaim Rabin]], 'Short Vowels in Tiberian Hebrew', in ''Ḥiqre Lašon'' 1999 (originally published 1961). {{he icon}}.</ref>\n\nShuruk is usually a reflection of reconstructed [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] long {{IPA|/uː/}} (ū) sound, although most likely in the Bible Kubutz stands for it when the letter Waw is not written. Kubutz is one of the reflections of the short Proto-Semitic short {{IPA|/u/}} (ŭ) sound. [[Kamatz Katan]] is a variant of Kubutz in the Bible, as they are found in [[complementary distribution]] in closely related morphological patterns.<ref name=\"rabin-short-vowels\" />\n\nIn modern Hebrew, both signs indicate the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/u/}}, a [[close back rounded vowel]]. Its closest equivalent in English is the \"oo\" sound in m'''oo'''n, but the modern Hebrew pronunciation is shorter. It is [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as a \"u\".\n\nIn modern Hebrew writing without niqqud the {{IPA|/u/}} sound is always written as [[Waw (letter)|Waw]], in which case it is considered a ''[[mater lectionis]]''.\n\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] of the Kubutz and Shuruk in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=3 | Symbol \n! rowspan=3 | Name\n!! colspan=7 | [[Help:IPA/Hebrew|Pronunciation]]\n|-\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]]\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi]]\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Sephardi Hebrew language|Sephardi]]\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Yemenite Hebrew language|Yemenite]]\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]]\n!! colspan=2 | Reconstructed \n|-\n!

In this usage, it has become concatenated with other words to form new constructions often treated as independent words: for instance, {{lang|ar|لِماذا}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|limāḏā}}'', meaning \"why?\", is derived from {{lang|ar|لـِ}} li and {{lang|ar|ماذا}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|māḏā}}'', meaning \"what?\" thus getting \"for what?\".

      "text": "{{italic title}}\n{{More footnotes|date=December 2007}}\nIn the spelling of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and some other [[Semitic languages]], '''''matres lectionis''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|m|eɪ|t|r|iː|z|_|l|ɛ|k|t|i|ˈ|oʊ|n|ᵻ|s}}; from [[Latin]] \"mothers of reading\", singular form: ''mater lectionis'', from {{lang-he-n|אֵם קְרִיאָה}}, 'em k'ri'a) are certain consonants that are used to indicate a vowel. The letters that do this in Hebrew are ''[[aleph]]'' {{Hebrew|א}}, ''[[he (letter)|he]]'' {{Hebrew|ה}}, ''[[waw (letter)|waw]]'' {{Hebrew|ו}} and ''[[yodh|yod]]'' {{Hebrew|י}}. The yod and waw in particular are more often vowels than they are consonants. \n\nIn [[Arabic]], the ''matres lectionis'' (though they are much less often referred to thus) are [[aleph|''alif'']] {{lang|ar|ا}}, [[Waw (letter)|''wāw'']] {{lang|ar|و}}, [[Yodh|''yā’'']] {{lang|ar|ي}} and to some extent  [[He (letter)|''hā’'']] {{lang|ar|ه}}. \n\nThe original value of the ''matres lectionis'' correspond closely to what is called in modern linguistics [[glide (linguistics)|glides]] or semivowels.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', Brill, 2006, 2.238, 308-9.</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nBecause the scripts used to write some Semitic languages lack vowel letters, unambiguous reading of a text might be difficult.  Therefore, to indicate vowels (mostly long), consonant letters are used.  For example, in the Hebrew [[Construct state|construct-state]] form ''bēt'', meaning \"the house of\", the middle letter {{lang|he|[[י]]}} in the spelling {{lang|he|בית}} acts as a vowel, but in the corresponding absolute-state form ''bayit'' (\"house\"), which is spelled the same, the same letter represents a genuine consonant.  ''Matres lectionis'' are extensively employed only in Hebrew, [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Arabic]], but the phenomenon is also found in the [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]], [[Moabite language|Moabite]], [[South Arabian alphabet|South Arabian]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] alphabets.\n\n==Origins and development==\n\nHistorically, the practice of using ''matres lectionis'' seems to have originated when {{IPA|/aj/}} and {{IPA|/aw/}} diphthongs, written with the yod {{lang|he|י}} and the waw {{lang|he|ו}} consonant letters respectively,  monophthongized to simple long vowels {{IPA|/eː/}} and {{IPA|/oː/}}. This epiphenomenal association between consonant letters and vowel sounds was then seized upon and used in words without historic diphthongs.\n\nIn general terms, it is observable that early [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] texts have very few ''matres lectionis'', and that during most of the 1st millennium BCE, Hebrew and Aramaic were quicker to develop ''matres lectionis'' than Phoenician. However, in its latest period of development in [[North Africa]] (referred to as \"[[Punic language|Punic]]\"), Phoenician developed a very full use of ''matres lectionis'', including the use of the letter [[Ayin]] {{lang|he|ע}}, also used for this purpose much later in [[Yiddish orthography]].\n\nIn pre-exilic Hebrew, there was a significant development of the use of the letter He {{lang|he|ה}} to indicate word final vowels other than ''ī'' and ''ū''. This was probably inspired by the phonological change of the third-person singular possessive suffix from {{IPA|/ahuː/}} > {{IPA|/aw/}} > {{IPA|/oː/}} in most environments. However, in later periods of Hebrew, the orthography was changed so word-final ''ō'' was no longer written with the letter He {{lang|he|ה}} (except in a few archaically-spelled proper names, such as [[Solomon]] {{lang|he|שלמה}} and [[Shiloh (biblical figure)|Shiloh]] {{lang|he|שלה}}). The difference between the spelling of the third-person singular possessive suffix (as attached to singular nouns) with He {{lang|he|ה}} in early Hebrew vs. with waw {{lang|he|ו}} in later Hebrew has become an issue in the authentication of the [[Jehoash Inscription]].\n\nAccording to Sass (5), already in the Middle Kingdom there were some cases of ''matres lectionis'', i.e. consonant graphemes which were used to transcribe vowels in foreign words, namely in Punic (Jensen 290, Naveh 62), Aramaic, and Hebrew (he, waw, yod; sometimes even aleph; Naveh 62). Naveh (ibid.) notes that the earliest Aramaic and Hebrew documents already used ''matres lectionis''. Some scholars argue that the Greeks must therefore have borrowed their alphabet from the Arameans. However, the practice has older roots, as the [[Ugaritic alphabet|Semitic cuneiform alphabet of Ugarit]] (13th century BC) already had ''matres lectionis'' (Naveh 138).\n===Hebrew===\nThe earliest method of indicating some vowels in Hebrew writing was to use the [[consonant]] letters ''[[Yodh|yod]]'' {{lang|he|י}}, ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'' {{lang|he|ו}}, ''[[He (letter)|he]]'' {{lang|he|ה}},and ''[[Aleph (Hebrew)|aleph]]'' {{lang|he|א}} of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] to also write long [[vowels]] in some cases. Originally, {{lang|he|א}} and {{lang|he|ה}} were only at the end of words, and {{lang|he|י}} and {{lang|he|ו}} were used mainly to write the original [[diphthongs]] {{IPA|/aw/}} and {{IPA|/aj/}} as well as original vowel+[y]+vowel sequences (which sometimes simplified to plain long vowels). Gradually, as it was found to be insufficient for differentiating between similar nouns, {{lang|he|י}} and {{lang|he|ו}} were also inserted to mark some long vowels of non-diphthongal origin.\n\nIf words can be written with or without ''matres lectionis'', spellings that include the letters are called ''malē'' (Hebrew) or ''plene'' (Latin), meaning \"full\", and spellings without them are called ''ḥaser'' or ''defective''. In some verb forms, ''matres lectionis'' are almost always used. Around the 9th century CE, it was decided that the system of ''matres lectionis'' did not suffice to indicate the vowels precisely enough for purposes of liturgical recitation of Biblical texts so a supplemental [[Niqqud|vowel pointing system (''niqqud'')]] (diacritic symbols indicating vowel pronunciation and other important phonological features not written by the traditional basic consonantal [[orthography]]) joined ''matres lectionis'' as part of the Hebrew writing system.\n\nIn some words in Hebrew, there is a choice of whether to use a ''mater lectionis'' or not, and in modern printed texts ''matres lectionis'' are sometimes used even for short vowels, which is considered to be grammatically incorrect according to traditional norms, though instances are found as far back as [[Talmud]]ic times. Such texts from Judaea and Galilee were noticeably more inclined to ''malē'' spellings than texts from [[Babylonia]]. Similarly, in the [[Middle Ages]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] tended to use ''malē'' spellings under the influence of [[Languages of Europe|European languages]], but [[Sephardi Jews]] tended to use ''ḥaser'' spellings under the influence of Arabic.\n\n===Arabic===\nIn Arabic there is no such choice, and the almost invariable rule is that a long vowel is written with a ''mater lectionis'' and a short vowel with a [[diacritic]] symbol, but the Uthmanic [[orthography]], the one in which the [[Quran]] is traditionally written and printed, has some differences, which are not always consistent. Also, under influence from orthography of European languages, transliterating of borrowed words into Arabic is usually done using ''matres lectionis'' in place of diacritics, even when the latter is more suitable or when words from another Semitic language, such as Hebrew, are transliterated. That phenomenon is augmented by the neglect of diacritics in most printed forms since the beginning of mechanical printing.\n\nThe name given to the three ''matres lectionis'' by traditional Arabic grammar is ''ḥurūf al-līn wa-l-madd'', ‘consonants of softness and lengthening’, or ''ḥurūf al-ʿilal'', ‘causal consonants‘ or ‘consonants of infirmity’, because as in Greek grammar, words with ‘accidents’ were deemed to be afflicted, ill, in opposition to ‘healthy’ words without accidents.<ref>''Encyclopedia of Arabic Language and Linguistics'', Brill, 2006, 2.308ff.</ref>\n\nInformal orthographies of spoken varieties of Arabic also use ''[[he (letter)|ha]]'' to indicate a shorter version of alif, a usage augmented by the ambiguity of the use of ''ha'' and ''taa marbuta'' in formal Arabic orthography. It is a formal orthography in other languages that use Arabic script, such as [[Kurdish alphabets]].\n\n===Syriac===\nSyriac-Aramaic vowels are classified into three groups: the Alap ({{lang|syr|ܐ}}), the waw ({{lang|syr|ܘ}}), and the yod ({{lang|syr|ܝ}}).  The ''mater lectionis'' was developed as early as the 6th century to represent long vowels, which were earlier denoted by a dot under the line. The most frequent ones are the ''yod'' and the ''waw'', while the ''alap'' is mostly restricted to some transliterated words.<ref>{{cite book|last=B. J.|first=Segal|author-link=Judah Segal|title=The Diacritical Point and the Accents in Syriac|year=2004|publisher=Gorgias Press LLC|isbn=978-1-59333-125-2|pages=20–21}}</ref>\n\n==Usage in Hebrew==\n{{details|Hebrew spelling}}\nMost commonly, yod {{Hebrew|י}} indicates ''i'' or ''e'', while waw {{Hebrew|ו}} indicates ''o'' or ''u''. Aleph {{Hebrew|א}} was not systematically developed as a ''mater lectionis'' in Hebrew (unlike in Aramaic and Arabic), but it is occasionally used to indicate an ''a'' vowel. (However, a silent aleph, indicating an original [[glottal stop]] consonant sound that has become silent in Hebrew pronunciation, can occur after almost any vowel.) At the end of a word, He {{Hebrew|ה}} can also be used to indicate that a vowel ''a'' should be pronounced.\n\nExamples:\n:{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Symbol\n! colspan=2 |  Name\n! rowspan=2 |  Vowel formation\n! rowspan=2 |  Vowel quality\n! colspan=2 |  Example\n|-\n!

This tendency was taken to its logical conclusion in fully alphabetic scripts such as [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. Many of the vowel letters in such languages historically go back to ''matres lectionis'' in the Phoenician script. For example, the letter {{angle bracket|i}} was originally derived from the consonant letter ''yod''. Similarly the vowel letters in the [[Avestan alphabet]] were adapted from ''matres lectionis'' in the version of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] adapted as the [[Pahlavi scripts]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hebrew spelling]]\n* [[Ktiv hasar niqqud]]\n* [[Mappiq]]\n* [[Niqqud]]\n* [[Tengwar]]\n* [[Tiberian vocalization]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite GHG|7}}\n* Canteins, Jean. 1972.

MacGregor Mathers]]' late 19th century [[English language|English]] translation of ''[[Kabbalah Denudata|The Kabbalah Denudata]]'', itself a [[Latin]] translation by [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]] of the ''[[Zohar]]'', a primary Kabbalistic text.\n\nThis table has been used as a primary reference for a basic understanding of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] as it applies to the [[Kabbalah]], generally outside of traditional [[Jewish mysticism]], by many modern [[Hermeticism|Hermeticists]] and students of the [[occult]], including members of the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] and other [[Magical organization|magical fraternities]] deriving from it. It has been reproduced and adapted in many books published from the early 20th century to the present.\n\n----\n\n<center>\n{| style=\"font-family:'times new roman',serif;border:1px solid

'bridle', also ''ga'ya'' געיה, lit. 'bellowing', מאריך ''ma'arikh'', or  מעמיד ''ma'amid'') is a punctuation mark used in [[Biblical Hebrew]]  for [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] marking. It is a vertical bar placed under the affected syllable.\n\n== Usage ==\n{{Hebrew punctuation}}\nMeteg is primarily used in [[Biblical Hebrew]] to mark [[secondary stress]] and [[vowel length]]. Words may contain multiple metegs, e.g. מֹשְׁבֹתֵיכֶם, וּלְאֶבְיֹנְךָ.{{clarify|date=November 2016|reason=Examples as shown contain no meteg at all; occurrences of these words located in Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia contain no meteg at all in the left-hand instance (וּלְאֶבְיֹנְךָ, Deuteronomy 15:11) and only a single meteg in the right-hand \"example\" (מֹשְׁבֹֽתֵיכֶ֑ם, Exodus 35:3). Please provide valid, sourced examples if you have them; otherwise, please remove.}}\n\nMeteg is also sometimes used in Biblical Hebrew to mark a [[vowel length|long vowel]]. While short and long vowels are largely allophonic, they are not always predictable from spelling, e.g. ויראו 'and they saw' vs. ויראו 'and they feared'. Meteg's indication of length also indirectly indicates that a following [[shva]] is vocal, as in the previous case. Note that this may distinguish qamatz gadol and qatan, e.g. שמרה 'she guarded' vs. שמרה 'guard (volitive)'.\n\nIn modern usage meteg is only used in liturgical contexts and dictionaries. [[Siddur]]im and dictionaries may use meteg to mark [[primary stress]], often only for non-final stress, since the majority of Hebrew words have final stress.\n\n== Appearance and placement ==\nIts form is a vertical bar placed either to the left, the right, or in the middle of the [[niqqud]] (diacritics for vowels or cantillation) under a consonant.<ref name=\"qsm\">[http://www.qsm.co.il/Hebrew/Hebrew%20Issues.htm Hebrew Issues - DRAFT 2003-08-24]</ref> It is identical in appearance to [[silluq]] and is unified with it in Unicode.<ref name=\"umass\">[http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=music_faculty_pubs Rhythmic and Structural Aspects of the Masoretic Cantillation of the Pentateuch]</ref>\n\nMeteg differs from other Hebrew diacritics in that its placement is not totally fixed.<ref name=\"kirk\">[http://www.gentlewisdom.org.uk/qaya/academic/hebrew/Meteg.html On the Hebrew mark Meteg]</ref> While meteg is usually placed to the left of a vowel, some texts place it to the right, and some place it in the middle of hataf vowels.<ref name=\"kirk\" /> The Rabbinic Bible of 1524–25 always shifts meteg to the left, while the [[Aleppo codex|Aleppo]] and [[Leningrad codex|Leningrad]] codices are not consistent in meteg placement.<ref name=\"kirk\" />\n\nThe different placements of meteg are subgrouped relatively to its order with surrounding vowel points occurring below letters before or after it and are summarized in the table below. Three types of metegs are generally considered, with the left meteg being the most common case for simple vowels (however there's some rare cases where this group must be subdivided according to the placement of cantillation accents), and the medial meteg occurring only (but most frequently) with (composite) [[hataf]] vowels.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Meteg placement in the [[Biblia Hebraica

surrounded by multiple vowel points or cantillation accents below them, the meteg may not fit well on any side of the vowel point below the base letter. In that case the meteg may adopt an ambiguous position, below the existing vowel point or above the cantillation accent that normally fits below the base letter. Such ambiguous positioning occurs in old books like the ''[[Codex Leningradensis]]'' (around year 1006) whose text on paper was extremely compacted with minimal spacing between letters.\n\n== Unicode ==\nIn Unicode, '''Meteg''' and '''Silluq''' (when it occurs before punctuation [[Sof passuk]] at end of verses) are unified.<ref name=\"sil\" />\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\"|Glyph\n!scope=\"col\"|[[Unicode]]<ref name=\"unicode\">[https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/5BD/index.htm Unicode Character 'Hebrew Point Meteg' (U+05BD)]</ref>\n!scope=\"col\"|Name\n|-\n|align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:300%;line-height:normal;font-family:'Ezra SIL','Charis SIL','Doulos SIL',Gentium,GentiumAlt,'DejaVu Sans',Code2000,'TITUS Cyberbit Basic','Lucida Sans Unicode','Chrysanthi Unicode',Frankruehl,'Arial Unicode MS',Arial;\"| {{lang|rtl=yes|he|&nbsp;ֽ&#x05BD;}}\n| U+05BD\n| Hebrew Point Meteg\n|}\n\nUnicode also does not distinguish between the different placements of Meteg.

Consequently, the Meteg may be freely reordered during [[Unicode normalization]] when it appears in sequences with other combining diacritics, without affecting its interpretation or rendering.\n\nWhere the relative placement of Meteg is significant and does not match the standard order of combining classes of Hebrew diacritics (where the Meteg should appear after Hebrew vowel points but before Hebrew cantillation marks in normalized texts), a [[combining grapheme joiner]] (CGJ, U+034F) should be added between Meteg and other diacritics before or after it, to fix its rendering placement and intended meaning.\n\nIn the most frequent use of Meteg, it should follow the vowel mark, but the canonical ordering of combining classes swaps them during standard normalizations: the canonical combining class of Meteg is 22, higher than the canonical combining classes 10 to 20 assigned to Hebrew vowel points; it is also higher than the canonical combining class 21 assigned to the combining [[Dagesh]] (or Mapiq) consonant modifier, but this generally causes no problem.<ref>[https://www.unicode.org/Public/6.2.0/ucd/extracted/DerivedCombiningClass.txt Derived combining classes] in the Unicode character database.</ref>\n\nIn the most frequent cases of use in modern Hebrew, the Meteg should only follow a vowel point and cantillation marks are not used; but in Biblical Hebrew it must sometimes be encoded with an additional CGJ after it before a vowel point, so that it remains interpreted first (and rendered to the right) before the niqqud after it (to the left); Meteg must also be preceded by a CGJ if it must appear after (to the left) a cantillation accent (whose combining class is 220 or more).\n\nAdditionally, the special placements of meteg with the three [[hataf]] vowels (whose canonical combinal classes are between 11 and 13) requires encoding it after the hataf vowel point, separated by a [[zero-width joiner]] control (ZWJ, U+200D) for the medial position (between the two parts of the hataf vowel), or by a [[zero-width non-joiner]] control (ZWNJ, U+200C) for the final position (to the left of the hataf vowel); some encoded texts use CGJ instead of ZWNJ for the later case.\n\nThe three controls CGJ, ZWJ and ZWNJ (which have canonical combining class 0) are all blocking the canonical reordering of meteg with vowels points, and only ZWJ is needed for the special placement of meteg (combining class) in the middle of an hataf vowel. But in the cases where the encoding of CGJ is optional but not needed, or for the case where ZWNJ is replaced by CGJ, the presence or absence of this CGJ control creates texts that are not visually distinctive, but they are still not canonically equivalent. This may create difficulties for plain-text search, unless it uses a conforming [[Unicode collation algorithm]] (UCA) with the appropriate tailoring for the Hebrew script, where these controls are assigned ignorable weights after the initial normalization.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.freelists.org/post/biblitfonts/Fwd-RE-meteg-positioning,3]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100725210229/http://fourquestions.us/pro/editing/normalize.php Normalization for Biblical Hebrew]\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[Category:Punctuation]]"

      "text": "\n{{Table_Numeral_Systems}}\nThe system of '''Hebrew numerals''' is a quasi-decimal alphabetic [[numeral system]] using the letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\nThe system was adapted from that of the [[Greek numerals]] in the late 2nd century BCE.\n\nThe current numeral system is also known as the ''Hebrew alphabetic numerals'' to contrast with earlier systems of writing numerals used in classical antiquity. These systems were inherited from usage in the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]] and [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] scripts, attested from c. 800 BC in the so-called [[Samaria ostraca]] and sometimes known as ''Hebrew-Aramaic numerals'', ultimately derived from the Egyptian [[Hieratic numerals]].\n\nThe Greek system was adopted in [[Hellenistic Judaism]] and had been in use in Greece since about the 5th century BC.\n<ref> Stephen Chrisomalis, ''Numerical Notation: A Comparative History'', Cambridge University Press, 2010,\n[https://books.google.ch/books?id=ux--OWgWvBQC&pg=PA157#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 157]; Solomon Gandz, ''Hebrew Numerals'',  Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research\nVol. 4, (1932 - 1933), pp. 53-112.</ref>\n\nIn this system, there is no notation for [[0 (number)|zero]], and the numeric values for individual letters are added together.  Each unit (1, 2, ..., 9) is assigned a separate letter, each tens (10, 20, ..., 90) a separate letter, and the first four hundreds (100, 200, 300, 400) a separate letter. The later hundreds (500, 600, 700, 800 and 900) are represented by the sum of two or three letters representing the first four hundreds. To represent numbers from 1,000 to 999,999, the same letters are reused to serve as thousands, tens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands. [[Gematria]] (Jewish numerology) uses these transformations extensively.\n\nIn [[Israel]] today, the decimal system of [[Arabic numerals]] (ex. 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.) is used in almost all cases (money, age, date on the [[civil calendar]]).  The Hebrew numerals are used only in special cases, such as when using the [[Hebrew calendar]], or numbering a list (similar to a, b, c, d, etc.), much as [[Roman numerals]] are used in the West.\n\n==Numbers==\nThe Hebrew language has names for common numbers that range from zero to one million. Letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] are used to represent numbers in a few traditional contexts, for example in calendars. In other situations Arabic numerals are used. [[Cardinal numbers|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal numbers]] must agree in gender with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. telephone numbers), the feminine form is used. For ordinal numbers greater than ten the cardinal is used and numbers above the value 20 have no gender.\n\n[[File:Hohe Synagoge Prag 1.jpg|thumb|260px| The lower clock on the [[Jewish Town Hall (Prague)|Jewish Town Hall]] building in [[Prague]], with Hebrew numerals in counterclockwise order.]]\n[[File:Pocket watches with Hebrew numerals.JPG|thumb|260px|Early 20th century pocket watches with Hebrew numerals in clockwise order ([[Jewish Museum, Berlin]]).]]\n\n===Ordinal values===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]]<br><small>(English)</small>\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]]<br><small>(Hebrew)</small>\n|-\n!

Officially, numbers greater than million were represented by the [[long scale]]; However, since January 21st, 2013, the modified [[short scale]] (under which the long scale milliard is substituted for the strict short scale billion), which was already the colloquial standard, became official.<ref>[http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/האקדמיה-ללשון-העברית-התכנסה-לישיבתה-ה-32/ http://www.hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/02/07/האקדמיה-ללשון-העברית-התכנסה-לישיבתה-ה-32/]</ref>\n\n===Speaking and writing===\nCardinal and ordinal numbers must agree in gender (masculine or feminine; mixed groups are treated as masculine) with the noun they are describing. If there is no such noun (e.g. a telephone number or a house number in a street address), the feminine form is used. Ordinal numbers must also agree in number and definite status like other adjectives. The cardinal number precedes the noun (e.g., ''shlosha yeladim''), except for the number one which succeeds it (e.g., ''yeled echad''). The number two is special: ''shnayim'' (m.) and ''shtayim'' (f.) become ''shney'' (m.) and ''shtey'' (f.) when followed by the noun they count. For [[ordinal number]]s (numbers indicating position) greater than ten the cardinal is used.\n\n==Calculations==\nThe Hebrew numeric system operates on the additive principle in which the numeric values of the letters are added together to form the total.  For example, 177 is represented as קעז which (from right to left) corresponds to 100 + 70 + 7 = 177.\n\nMathematically, this type of system requires 27 letters (1-9, 10-90, 100-900).  In practice the last letter, ''tav'' (which has the value 400) is used in combination with itself and/or other letters from ''kof'' (100) onwards, to generate numbers from 500 and above.  Alternatively, the 22-letter Hebrew numeral set is sometimes extended to 27 by using 5 ''sofit'' (final) forms of the Hebrew letters.<ref>According to Gandz (p. 96), cited above, this use of the sofit letters was not widely accepted and soon abandoned.</ref>\n\n===Key exceptions===\nBy convention, the numbers 15 and 16 are represented as ט״ו{{lrm}} (9 + 6) and ט״ז{{lrm}} (9 + 7), respectively, in order to refrain from using the two-letter combinations י-ה{{lrm}} (10 + 5) and י-ו{{lrm}} (10 + 6), which are alternate written forms for the [[Tetragrammaton|Name of God]] in everyday writing. In the calendar, this manifests every [[full moon]], since all Hebrew months start on a [[new moon]] (see for example: [[Tu BiShvat]]).\n\nCombinations which would spell out words with negative connotations are sometimes avoided by switching the order of the letters. For instance, 744 which should be written as תשמ״ד{{lrm}} (meaning \"you/it will be destroyed\") might instead be written as תשד״מ or תמש״ד (meaning \"end to demon\").\n\n===Use of final letters===\nThe Hebrew numeral system has sometimes been extended to include the five final letter forms—ך (500&lrm;), ם (600&lrm;), ן (700&lrm;), ף (800&lrm;) and ץ (900&lrm;)—which are then used to indicate the numbers from 500 to 900.\n\nThe ordinary forms for 500 to 900 are: ת״ק (500&lrm;), ת״ר (600&lrm;), ת״ש (700&lrm;), ת״ת (800&lrm;) and תת״ק (900&lrm;).\n\n==Gershayim==\n[[File:Baiersdorf Juedischer Friedhof 025 (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|A tombstone from 1935 in [[Baiersdorf]], [[Germany]], reading:\n<poem style=\"text-align:center\">נפטר ביום '''כׄ''' אייר\nונקבר ביום '''כׄגׄ''' אייר\nשנת '''תׄרׄצׄהׄ''' לפׄק</poem>\nIn English:\n''<poem style=\"text-align:center\">Passed away on day '''20''' Iyar\nAnd buried on day '''23''' Iyar\nYear '''695''' without the thousands [i.e. year 5695]</poem>''\nNote the dots above each letter in each number.]]\n[[Gershayim]] (U+05F4 in [[Unicode]], and resembling a [[double quote]] mark) (sometimes erroneously referred to as ''merkha'ot'', which is Hebrew for double quote) are inserted before (to the right of) the last (leftmost) letter to indicate that the sequence of letters represents a number rather than a word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by two or more Hebrew numerals (''e.g.,'' 28 → כ״ח{{lrm}}).\n\nSimilarly, a single [[Geresh]] (U+05F3 in Unicode, and resembling a [[single quote]] mark) is appended after (to the left of) a single letter to indicate that the letter represents a number rather than a (one-letter) word.  This is used in the case where a number is represented by a single Hebrew numeral (''e.g.,'' 100 → ק׳{{lrm}}).\n\nNote that [[Geresh]] and [[Gershayim]] merely indicate \"''not a (normal) word.''\" Context usually determines whether they indicate a number or something else (such as \"''[[Hebrew abbreviations|abbreviation]]''\").\n\nAn alternative method found in old manuscripts and still found on modern-day tombstones is to put a dot above each letter of the number.\n\n==Decimals==\nIn print, Arabic numerals are employed in Modern Hebrew for most purposes.  Hebrew numerals are used nowadays primarily for writing the days and years of the [[Hebrew calendar]]; for references to traditional Jewish texts (particularly for Biblical chapter and verse and for Talmudic folios); for bulleted or numbered lists (similar to ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''etc.'', in English); and in numerology ([[gematria]]).\n\n==Thousands and date formats==\nThousands are counted separately, and the thousands count precedes the rest of the number (to the ''right'', since Hebrew is read from right to left).  There are no special marks to signify that the “count” is starting over with thousands, which can theoretically lead to ambiguity, although a single quote mark is sometimes used after the letter.  When specifying years of the Hebrew calendar in the present millennium, writers usually omit the thousands (which is presently 5 [{{lang|he|ה}}]), but if they do not this is accepted to mean 5 * 1000, with no ambiguity. The current Israeli coinage includes the thousands.{{clarify|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Date examples===\n\n<!-- Note: The following Unicode characters are useful here:\n     U+202B = \"RIGHT-TO-LEFT EMBEDDING\"\n     U+202C = \"POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING\"\n     U+05F3 = \"HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERESH\"\n     U+05F4 = \"HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERSHAYIM\"\n     The first two codes above are necessary to render properly in all browsers.\n     I left these encoded as &#x...; to make this section easier to edit. -->\n\n“Monday, 15 Adar 5764” (where 5764 = 5(&times;1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 4, and 15 = 9 + 6):\n\n: In full (with thousands): &ldquo;Monday, 15(th) of Adar, 5764&rdquo;\n: &#x202b;יום שני ט&#x5f4;ו באדר ה&#x5f3;תשס&#x5f4;ד&#x202c;\n\n: Common usage (omitting thousands): &ldquo;Monday, 15(th) of Adar, (5)764&rdquo;\n: &#x202b;יום שני ט&#x5f4;ו באדר תשס&#x5f4;ד&#x202c;\n\n“Thursday, 3 Nisan 5767” (where 5767 = 5(&times;1000) + 400 + 300 + 60 + 7):\n\n: In full (with thousands): &ldquo;Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, 5767&rdquo;\n: &#x202b;יום חמישי ג&#x5f3; בניסן ה&#x5f3;תשס&#x5f4;ז&#x202c;\n\n: Common usage (omitting thousands): &ldquo;Thursday, 3(rd) of Nisan, (5)767&rdquo;\n: &#x202b;יום חמישי ג&#x5f3; בניסן תשס&#x5f4;ז&#x202c;\n\nTo see how ''today's'' date in the [[Hebrew calendar]] is written, see, for example, [http://www.hebcal.com/converter/ Hebcal date converter].\n\n===Recent years===\n5780 (2019&ndash;20) = ה׳תש״פ\n\n5779 (2018&ndash;19) = ה׳תשע״ט\n\n...\n\n5772 (2011&ndash;12) = ה׳תשע״ב\n\n5771 (2010&ndash;11) = ה׳תשע״א\n\n5770 (2009&ndash;10) = ה׳תש״ע\n\n5769 (2008&ndash;09) = ה׳תשס״ט\n\n...\n\n5761 (2000&ndash;01) = ה׳תשס״א\n\n5760 (1999&ndash;00) = ה׳תש״ס\n\n==Similar systems==\n\nThe [[Abjad numerals]] are equivalent to the Hebrew numerals up to 400.

It is the third letter in [[Thaana]] ({{lang|dv|ނ}}), pronounced as \"nonou\". <br> In all languages, it represents the alveolar nasal /n/.\n\nThe Phoenician letter gave rise to the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[nu (letter)|nu]] (Ν), [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]]  [[File:EtruscanN-01.svg|6px|N]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[N]], and  [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Н]].\n\n==Origins==\nNun is believed to be derived from an Egyptian [[Serpent (symbolism)|hieroglyph of a snake]] (the Hebrew word for snake, ''nachash'' begins with a Nun and snake in [[Aramaic]] is ''nun'') or eel. Some have hypothesized a hieroglyph of fish in water as its origin (in Arabic, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nūn}}'' means large fish or whale). The Phoenician letter was named {{Transl|sem|nūn}} \"fish\", but the glyph has been suggested to descend from a hypothetical [[Proto-Canaanite]] {{Transl|sem|naḥš}} \"snake\", based on the name in [[Ge'ez script|Ethiopic]], ultimately from a [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] representing a snake, <hiero>I10</hiero>\n(see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]). {{Transl|sem|Naḥs}} in modern Arabic literally means \"bad luck\".  The cognate letter in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and descended Semitic languages of Ethiopia is ''nehas'', which also means \"brass\".\n\n==Arabic nūn==\n{{Infobox grapheme\n|name=Nūn\n|letter=ن\n|variations=\n|image=\n|imagesize=200\n|imagealt=\n|script=[[Arabic script]]\n|type=[[Abjad]]\n|typedesc=\n|language=[[Arabic language]]\n|phonemes={{IPAslink|n}}\n|unicode=\n|alphanumber=\n|number=\n|usageperiod=\n|children=\n|equivalents=\n|associates=\n|direction=Right-to-left\n}}\nThe letter is named ''{{transl|ar|DIN|nūn}}'', and is written is several ways depending in its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ن}}\nSome examples on its uses in [[Modern Standard Arabic]]:\n\nNūn is used as a suffix indicating present-tense plural feminine nouns; for example {{lang|ar|هِيَ تَكْتُب}} ''hiya taktub'' (\"she writes\") becomes {{lang|ar|هُنَّ تَكْتَبْنَ}} ''hunna taktabna'' (\"they [feminine] write\").\n\nNūn is also used as the prefix for first-person plural [[imperfective]]/[[present tense]] verbs. Thus {{lang|ar|هُوَ يَكْتُب}} ''huwwa yaktub'' (\"he writes\") → {{lang|ar|نَحْنُ نَكْتُب}} ''naḥnu naktub'' (\"we write\").\n\nThe Arabic letter nūn became associated with the spray-painting of nūn for [[Nasrani (Arabic term for Christian)|Nasrani]] (i.e. \"Nazarene\", an Arabic term for Christians used by Muslims) on the gateposts of Christian houses in Isis-held areas of Iraq.<ref>[http://www.euronews.com/2014/07/22/how-an-arabic-letter-was-reclaimed-to-support-iraqs-persecuted-christians-n Euronews] 22 July 2014 \"Over the weekend, while the world’s gaze was on Gaza and Syria, the situation of Christians in northern Iraq took a sharp turn for the worse, with thousands forced to flee their homes. ...

The symbol in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] that represents this sound is {{angbr IPA|ɳ}}, and the equivalent [[X-SAMPA]] symbol is <code>n`</code>. Like all the [[retroflex consonant]]s, the IPA symbol is formed by adding a rightward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of an en (the letter used for the corresponding [[alveolar consonant]]). It is similar to {{angbr IPA|ɲ}}, the letter for the [[palatal nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the left stem, and to {{angbr IPA|ŋ}}, the letter for the [[velar nasal]], which has a leftward-pointing hook extending from the bottom of the right stem.\n[[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] uses the letter ⟨ݨ⟩ for {{IPAslink|ɳ}}.

It is closely related to the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician script]].\n\nThe earliest known inscription in the Paleo-Hebrew script is the [[Zayit Stone]] discovered on a wall at [[Tel Zayit]], in the Beth Guvrin Valley in the lowlands of ancient [[Judea]] in 2005.<ref>The site of Tel Zayit is about 50 km (35 miles) southwest of Jerusalem.</ref> The 22 letters were carved on one side of the 38&nbsp;lb (17&nbsp;kg) stone, which resembles a bowl on the other. The find is attributed to the mid-10th century BCE.\n\n[[File:Gezer calendar close up.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gezer calendar]]]]\nThe script of the [[Gezer calendar]],<ref>An illustration of the Gezer script is available at this [http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/bible/images/writ-04-l.jpg link].</ref><ref>A transcription showing the script is available at this [http://www.oocities.org/gali_al_bulgari/Image31.gif link].</ref> dated to the late 10th century BCE, bears strong resemblance to contemporaneous Phoenician script from inscriptions at [[Byblos]]. The script on the Zayit Stone and Gezer Calendar are an earlier form than the classical Paleo-Hebrew of the 8th century and later; this early script is almost identical to the early Phoenician script on the 10th century Ahiram Sarcophagus Inscription. By the 8th century these early forms developed into a number of national alphabets including Israelite Paleo-Hebrew in Israel and Judah, Moabite in Moab and Ammon, Edomite, Phoenician and Early Aramaic (from which came the Assyrian square script that later became the modern Hebrew Alphabet).\n\nClear Hebrew features are visible in the scripts of the Moabite inscriptions of the [[Mesha Stele]], set up around 840 BCE by King Mesha of Moab.<ref>An illustration of the script used on Mesha's Stele is available at this [http://www.historian.net/images/moabite.gif link].</ref> Similarly, the [[Tel Dan Stele]] from approximately 810 BCE resembles Hebrew inscriptions although its writing is classified as Old Aramaic and it dates from a period when Dan had already fallen into the orbit of Damascus.\n\nThe 8th-century Hebrew inscriptions exhibit many specific and exclusive traits, leading modern scholars to conclude that already in the 10th century BCE the Paleo-Hebrew script was used by wide scribal circles.\n\nEven though very few 10th-century Hebrew inscriptions have been found, the quantity of the epigraphic material from the 8th century onward shows the gradual spread of literacy among the people of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]].\n\nIn 1855 a Phoenician inscription in 22 lines was found among the ruins of [[Sidon]]. Each line contained about 40 or 50 characters. A facsimile copy of the writing was published in United States Magazine in July 1855. The inscription was on the lid of a large stone [[sarcophagus]] carved in fine Egyptian style. The writing was primarily a genealogical history of a king of Sidon buried in the sarcophagus.<ref>''The Newly Discovered Phoenician Inscription'', [[New York Times]], June 15, 1855, pg. 4.</ref>\n\nThe Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was in common use in the ancient [[Israelite]] kingdoms of Israel and Judah. Following the exile of the Kingdom of Judah in the 6th century BCE, in the [[Babylonian captivity of Judah|Babylonian exile]], [[Jew]]s began using a form of the [[Assyrian cuneiform|Assyrian script]], which was another offshoot of the same family of scripts. The [[Samaritans]], who remained in the Land of Israel, continued to use the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.\n\nDuring the 3rd century BCE, Jews began to use a stylized, \"square\" form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] that was used by the [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]] (which in turn was adopted from the [[Assyria]]ns),<ref name=\"A History of the Hebrew Language\">{{cite book|year=1993 |title=A History of the Hebrew Language |publisher=Cambridge University Press |author= Angel Sáenz-Badillos|location=Cambridge, England |isbn=0-521-55634-1}}</ref> while the Samaritans continued to use a form of the Paleo-Hebrew script, called the [[Samaritan script]]. After the fall of the Persian Empire, Jews used both scripts before settling on the Assyrian form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of the Paleo-Hebrew script among Jews was retained only to write the [[Tetragrammaton]].<ref>See [[Tetragrammaton#Dead Sea Scrolls Tetragrammaton]]: Dead Sea Scrolls.</ref>\n\n=== Further development ===\n[[File:Birkat kohanim 22.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration of script on a [[Ketef Hinnom]] amulet, ''circa'' 700 BCE—the \"Silver Scroll\"]]\nThe independent Hebrew script evolved by developing numerous cursive features, the [[Lapidary#Secondary meanings|lapidary]] features of the Phoenician alphabet being ever less pronounced with the passage of time. The aversion of the lapidary script may indicate that the custom of erecting stelae by the kings and offering votive inscriptions to the deity was not widespread in Israel. Even the engraved inscriptions from the 8th century exhibit elements of the cursive style, such as the shading, which is a natural feature of pen-and-ink writing. Examples of such inscriptions include the [[Siloam inscription]],<ref>An illustration of the Siloam script is available at this [http://www.historian.net/images/siloam.jpg link].</ref> numerous tomb inscriptions from [[Jerusalem]],<ref>An illustration of a tomb inscription said to be scratched onto an ossuary to identify the decedent is available [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/wp-content/uploads/1991/07/Inscription1.jpg ''here'']. An article describing the ossuaries Zvi Greenhut excavated from a burial cave in the south of Jerusalem can be found in [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/2598/ ''Jerusalem Perspective''] (July 1, 1991), with links to other articles.</ref><ref>Another tomb inscription is believed to be from the tomb of [[Shebna]], an official of King Hezekiah. An [[:File:Silwan-inscr.jpg|''illustration'']] of the inscription may be viewed, but it is too large to be placed inline.</ref> the [[Ketef Hinnom]] amulets, a fragmentary Hebrew inscription on an ivory which was taken as war spoils (probably from [[Samaria]]) to [[Nimrud]], and the hundreds of 8th to 6th-century Hebrew seals from various sites. The most developed cursive script is found on the 18 [[Lachish letters | Lachish ostraca]],<ref>An illustration of the Lachish script is available at this [http://www.historian.net/images/lachish.gif link].</ref> letters sent by an officer to the governor of Lachish just before the destruction of the [[First Temple]] in 586 BCE. A slightly earlier (''circa'' 620 BCE) but similar script is found on an [[ostracon]] excavated at [[Mesad Hashavyahu#The Mesad Hashavyahu ostracon|Mesad Hashavyahu]], containing a petition for redress of grievances (an appeal by a field worker to the fortress's governor regarding the confiscation of his cloak, which the writer considers to have been unjust).<ref>See [[Mesad Hashavyahu#Translation|Worker's appeal to governor]].</ref><ref>The conduct complained about is contrary to Exodus 22, which provides:“If you take your neighbor’s garment in pledge, you must return it to him before the sun sets; it is his only clothing, the sole covering for his skin. In what else shall he sleep?”</ref>\n\n=== Decline ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Barkokhba-silver-tetradrachm.jpg|thumb|[[Bar Kochba Revolt coinage|Coin from the Bar Kokhba revolt]] with the Paleo-Hebrew writings]]\nAfter the Babylonian capture of Judea, when most of the nobles were taken into exile, the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet continued to be used by the people who remained. One example of such writings are the 6th-century BCE jar handles from [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], on which the names of winegrowers are inscribed. Beginning from the 5th century BCE onward, the Aramaic language and script became an official means of communication. Paleo-Hebrew was still used by scribes and others. Some Paleo-Hebrew fragments of the [[Torah]] were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]: manuscripts 4Q12, 6Q1: Genesis. 4Q22: Exodus. 1Q3, 2Q5, 4Q11, 4Q45, 4Q46, 6Q2: Leviticus.<ref>[http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/image/B-298934 Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library].</ref> In some [[Qumran]] documents, [[YHWH]] is written in Paleo-Hebrew while the rest of the text is in Aramaic square script.<ref>e.g. [[:File:Psalms Scroll.jpg]]</ref> The vast majority of the [[Hashmonean coinage|Hasmonean coinage]], as well as the coins of the [[First Jewish–Roman War]] and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]], bears Paleo-Hebrew legends. The Paleo-Hebrew alphabet fell completely out of use only after 135 CE.\n\n== Legacy ==\n=== Samaritan alphabet ===\n{{Main article|Samaritan alphabet}}\n[[File:Samaritan Leviticus.jpg|thumb|A page from the Samaritan version of [[Leviticus]]]]\nThe paleo-Hebrew alphabet continued to be used by the [[Samaritans]] and over time developed into the [[Samaritan alphabet]]. The Samaritans have continued to use the script for writing both Hebrew and Aramaic texts until the present day. A comparison of the earliest Samaritan inscriptions and the medieval and modern Samaritan manuscripts clearly indicates that the Samaritan script is a static script which was used mainly as a book hand.\n\n=== Babylonian Talmud ===\nThe [[Amoraim|Talmudic sages]] did not share a uniform stance on the subject of Paleo-Hebrew. Some stated that Paleo-Hebrew was the original script used by the Israelites at the time of the Exodus,<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 21b\">[[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 21b</ref> while others believed that Paleo-Hebrew merely served as a stopgap in a time when the ostensibly original script ([[Ashuri alphabet|The Assyrian Script]]) was lost.<ref>[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] 3a, [[Shabbat (Talmud)|Shabbat]] 104a</ref> According to both opinions, [[Ezra the Scribe]] (c. 500 BCE) introduced, or reintroduced the Assyrian script to be used as the primary alphabet for the [[Hebrew language]].<ref name=\"Sanhedrin 21b\"/> The arguments given for both opinions are rooted in Jewish scripture and/or tradition.\n\nA third opinion<ref>Sanhedrin 22a</ref> in the [[Talmud]] states that the script never changed altogether. It would seem that the sage who expressed this opinion did not believe that Paleo-Hebrew ever existed, despite the strong arguments supporting it. His stance is rooted in a scriptural verse,<ref>Exodus 27, 10</ref> which makes reference to the shape of the letter [[vav (letter)|vav]]. The sage argues further that, given the commandment to copy a Torah scroll directly from another, the script could not conceivably have been modified at any point. This third opinion was accepted by some early Jewish scholars,<ref>[[Chananel ben Chushiel|Rabbeinu Chananel]] on Sanhedrin 22a</ref> and rejected by others, partially because it was permitted to write the Torah in Greek.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maimonides|title=Mishne Torah Hilchos Stam 1:19|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925417/jewish/Chapter-One.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in Sacred Name Bibles ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nThe Paleo-Hebrew script has been recently revived for specific use in several [[Sacred Name Bibles]]: including ''Zikarown Say’fer'', ''The Besorah'' and the ''Halleluyah Scriptures''. These translations use it for writing the [[Tetragrammaton]] and other divine names, incorporating these names written in this script in the midst of the English text.\n\n== Unicode ==\nThe Paleo-Hebrew alphabet was unified with the Phoenician alphabet and added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in July, 2006 with the release of version 5.0.\n\nThe Unicode block for Paleo-Hebrew, called Phoenician, is U+10900&ndash;U+1091F.

There are various rules in [[Hebrew grammar]] that stipulate when and why a dagesh is used.\n\n====Fe====\nWhen Pe appears ''without'' the dagesh dot in its center ('''{{lang|he|פ}}'''), then it usually represents a [[voiceless labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|/f/}}.\n\n====Final form of Pe/Fe====\nAt the end of words, the letter's written form changes to a ''Pe/Fe Sophit'' (Final Pe/Fe): {{lang|he|ף}}.\n\nWhen a word in modern Hebrew borrowed from another language ends with {{IPA|/p/}}, the non-final form is used (e.g. {{lang|he|ּפִילִיפ}} {{IPA|/ˈfilip/}} \"Philip\"), while borrowings ending in {{IPA|/f/}} still use the Pe Sofit (e.g. {{lang|he|כֵּיף}} {{IPA|/kef/}} \"fun\", from Arabic). This is because native Hebrew words, which always use the final form at the end, cannot end in {{IPA|/p/}}.\n\n=== Significance ===\nIn [[gematria]], Pe represents the number 80. Its final form represents 800 but this is rarely used, [[Tav (letter)|Tav]] written twice (400+400) being used instead.\n\n==Character encodings==\n\n{{charmap\n|05E4|name1=Hebrew Letter Pe\n|05E3|name2=Hebrew Letter Final Pe\n|0641|name3=Arabic Letter Feh\n|0726|name4=Syriac Letter Pe\n|0810|name5=Samaritan Letter Pi\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|10394|name1=Ugaritic Letter Pu\n|10850|name2=Imperial Aramaic Letter Pe\n|10910|name3=Phoenician Letter Pe\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|פ}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters|Faʼ]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[Category:Letters with final form]]"

      "text": "[[Image:Aleppo Codex (Deut).jpg|thumb|right|300px|An image from the Masoretic [[Aleppo Codex]] of [[Deuteronomy]] 33, containing a ''qere'' and ''ketiv'' in the second column, the fifth line, the second word (33:9). The ''ketiv'' is \"Beno\" - \"his son\" {{Hebrew|בְּנוֹ}}, while the ''qere'' is \"banaw\" - \"his children\" {{Hebrew|בָּנָיו}}.]]\n'''Qere and Ketiv''', from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] ''qere'' or ''q're'', {{Hebrew|קְרֵי}} (\"[what is] read\") and ''ketiv'', or ''ketib'', ''kethib'', ''kethibh'', ''kethiv'', {{Hebrew|כְּתִיב}} (\"[what is] written\"), also known as \"keri uchesiv\" or \"keri uchetiv,\" refer to a small number of differences between what is written in the consonantal text of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], as preserved by scribal tradition, and what is read.  In such situations, the '''Qere''' is the technical [[orthography|orthographic]] device used to indicate the pronunciation of the words in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew language scriptures (Tanakh), while the '''Ketiv''' indicates their written form, as inherited from tradition.\n\nThe word {{Hebrew|קרי}} is often pointed {{Hebrew|קְרִי}} and pronounced \"kri\" or \"keri\", reflecting the opinion that it is a passive participle rather than an imperative. This is reflected in the [[Ashkenazi]] pronunciation \"keri uchesiv\" mentioned above.\n\n==The Masoretic tradition==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\n[[Torah scroll]]s for use in public reading in synagogues contain only the [[Hebrew language]] consonantal text, handed down by tradition (with only a very limited and ambiguous indication of vowels by means of [[matres lectionis]]).  However, in the [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] [[codex|codices]] of the 9th–10th centuries, and most subsequent manuscripts and published editions of the [[Tanakh]] intended for personal study, the pure consonantal text is annotated with [[niqqud|vowel points]], [[cantillation]] marks and other diacritic symbols used by the [[Masoretes]] to indicate how it should be read and chanted, besides marginal notes serving various functions. That Masoretic reading or pronunciation is known as the ''Qere'' (Aramaic קרי \"to be read\"), while the pre-Masoretic consonantal spelling is known as the ''Ketiv'' (Aramaic כתיב \"(what is) written\").\n\nThough the basic consonantal text written in the [[Hebrew alphabet]] was never deliberately altered, sometimes the Masoretes noted a different reading of a word than that found in the pre-Masoretic consonantal text.  The scribes used ''qere/ketiv'' to show, without changing the received consonantal text, that in their tradition a different reading of the text is to be used. The ''qere/ketiv'' was also used to correct obvious errors in the consonantal text without changing it{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} .\n\nHowever, not all ''qere/ketiv'' represented cases of textual doubt, sometimes the change is deliberate. For example, the words in Deut. 28 (throughout) were deliberately replaced with qere because the ketiv was considered (after the return from Exile) too obscene to read in public. A very high percentage of ''qere/ketiv'' is accounted for by change of dialect from old archaic Hebrew to later Hebrew. When the old Hebrew dialect fell into disuse and certain words became unfamiliar to the masses, the scribes amended the original dialect to the later familiar dialect. A good example is the word Jerusalem, which in old Hebrew is always written ירושלם, but in a later period it is written ירושלים, thus the qere provides the more familiar reading without altering the text. This is also evident in 2 Kings 4 (throughout) where the archaic Hebrew 2p feminine form of ''-ti'' is consistently eliminated by the qere, which replaces it with the familiar standard form of ''-t''.<ref>https://torahtextmakesenseofit.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/kk-e.pdf</ref>     \n\nIn such Masoretic texts, the vowel diacritics of the ''qere'' (the Masoretic reading) would be placed in the main text, added around the consonantal letters of the ''ketiv'' (the written variant to be substituted – even if it contains a completely different number of letters), with a special sign indicating that there was a marginal note for this word.  In the margins there would be a {{Hebrew|ק}} sign (for ''qere''), followed by the consonants of the ''qere'' reading. In this way, the vowel points were removed from the ''qere'' and written instead on the ''ketiv''. Despite this, the vowels and consonantal letters of the ''qere'' were still meant to be read together.\n\n==Types of Qere and Ketiv==\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2012}}\n\n===\"Ordinary\" qere===\nIn an \"ordinary\" ''qere'', there is only a difference in certain closely related letters, or letters that can be silent (as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 8:17). For example, the similarly shaped letters {{Hebrew|י ו ן}} are often exchanged ([[Deuteronomy]] 34:7), as are {{Hebrew|כ ב}} ([[Esther]] 3:4) and the similar-sounding {{Hebrew|ד ת}} ([[Song of Songs]] 4:9). Very often, one of the letters {{Hebrew|א ה ו י}} are inserted ([[Ecclesiastes]] 10:3) or removed from a word ([[Deuteronomy]] 2:33). Many other similar cases exist. Other times, letters are reordered within the word ([[Ecclesiastes]] 9:4).\n\nBecause the difference between the ''qere'' and ''ketiv'' is relatively large, a note is made in footnotes, sidenotes or brackets to indicate it (see \"Typography\" below).\n\n===\"Vowel\" qere===\nSometimes, although the letters are unchanged, the vowel points differ between the ''qere'' and ''ketiv'' of the word ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 12:8). The ''ketiv'' is typically omitted with no indication, leaving only the vowelization for the ''qere''. Often the ''ketiv'' is left in an unusual spelling, but other times, both ''qere'' and ''ketiv'' remain in standard spelling.\n\nThis type of ''qere'' is different from ''qere'' perpetuum, because here, the consonants do not change. In a ''qere'' perpetuum, the consonants actually do change.\n\n===\"Omitted\" qere===\nOccasionally, a word is not read at all ([[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:12), in which case the word is marked ''ketiv velo qere'', meaning \"written and not read.\"\n\n===\"Added\" qere===\nOccasionally, a word is read but not written at all ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] 20:14; [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] 3:5), in which case the word is marked ''qere velo ketiv'', meaning \"read and not written.\"\n\n===\"Euphemistic\" qere===\nIn rarer cases, the word is replaced entirely ([[Deuteronomy]] 28:27, 30; [[Samuel]] I 5:6) for reasons of ''tohorat halashon'', \"purity of language.\"<ref>Megillah 25b</ref><ref>pp. 474-75, ''Tikkun, the Kestenbaum Edition.'' Brooklyn: [http://www.artscroll.com/ Mesorah Publications, Ltd.], 2004.</ref> This type of ''qere'' is noted in a printed Hebrew Bible.\n\n===\"Split/Joined\" qere===\nIn such a case, a ''ketiv'' is one word while the ''qere'' is multiple words ([[Deuteronomy]] 33:2) or vice versa ([[Book of Lamentations|Lamentations]] 4:3).\n\n===Qere perpetuum===\nIn a few cases a change may be marked solely by the adjustment of the vowels written on the consonants, without any notes in the margin, if it is common enough that this will suffice for the reader to recognize it. This is known as a '''Qere perpetuum''' (\"perpetual\" ''Qere'')<!--or '''standing Qere'''-->. It differs from an \"ordinary ''qere''\" in that there is no note marker and no accompanying marginal note &mdash; these are certain commonly occurring cases of ''qere''/''ketiv'' in which the reader is expected to understand that a ''qere'' exists merely from seeing the vowel points of the ''qere'' in the consonantal letters of the ''ketiv''.\n\n[[Image:Qre-perpetuum.png|thumb|right|300px|Qere perpetuum of the 3rd. fem. singular pronoun]]\nFor example, in the [[Pentateuch]], the third-person singular feminine pronoun {{Hebrew|היא}} ''hī'' is usually spelled the same as the third-person singular masculine pronoun {{Hebrew|הוא}} ''hū''.  The Masoretes indicated this situation by adding a written diacritic symbol for the vowel [i] to the pre-Masoretic consonantal spelling h-w-' {{Hebrew|הוא}} (see diagram).   The resulting orthography would seem to indicate a pronunciation ''hiw'', but this is meaningless in Biblical Hebrew, and a knowledgeable reader of the biblical text would know to read the feminine pronoun ''hī'' here.\n\nAnother example of an important ''qere perpetuum'' in the text of the Bible is the name of the God of Israel – {{Hebrew|יהוה}} (cf. [[Tetragrammaton]]). Often it is marked with the vowels {{Hebrew|יְהֹוָה}}, indicating that it is to be pronounced as {{Hebrew|אֲדֹנָי}} ''Adonai'' (meaning \"my Lord\") rather than with its own vowels. The consensus of mainstream scholarship is that \"Yehowah\" (or in Latin transcription \"Jehovah\") is a pseudo-Hebrew form which was mistakenly created when Medieval and/or Renaissance Christian scholars misunderstood this common ''qere perpetuum'', so that \"the bastard word 'Jehovah' [was] obtained by fusing the vowels of the one word with the consonants of the other\"<ref>Entry \"Tetragrammaton\" in ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (2nd. edition) edited by F.L. Cross and E.A. Livingstone. (1978), p. 1354 {{ISBN|0-19-211545-6}}</ref> (similar to reading ''hiw'' for the ''qere perpetuum'' of the third-person singular feminine pronoun). The usual Jewish practice at the time of the Masoretes was to pronounce it as \"Adonai\", as is still the Jewish custom today.<ref>''The New [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]]-Gesenius Hebrew and English Lexicon With an Appendix Containing the Biblical Aramaic'' by Frances Brown, with the cooperation of S.R. Driver and Charles Briggs (1907), p. 218 (entry יהוה listed under root הוה).</ref>\n\nOccasionally, the Tetragrammaton is marked {{Hebrew|יֱהֹוִה}} ([[Deuteronomy]] 3:24, [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]] 73:28) to indicate a qere of {{Hebrew|אֱלֹהִים}} ''Elohim'', another Divine Name.<ref>pp. xvi. \"Pronouncing the Names of God.\" Tikkun, The Kestenbaum Edition. Commentary by Rabbi Avie Gold. Brooklyn: [http://www.artscroll.com/ Mesorah Publications, Ltd.], 2004.</ref>\n\n==Interpretation and significance==\n\n===Jewish tradition===\nIn Jewish tradition, both the ''qere'' and the ''ketiv'' are considered highly significant. When reading the Torah scroll in the synagogue, [[Jewish law]] stipulates that the ''qere'' is to be read and not the ''ketiv'', to the extent that if the ''ketiv'' was read, it must be corrected and read according to the ''qere''.<ref>Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 141:8</ref><ref>[http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1378 \"Keri\" and \"Ketiv\": Words in the Torah That are Not Pronounced According to Their Spelling.] Torah Learning Resources. 2010. Accessed 13 November 2011.</ref> In addition however, Jewish law requires the scroll to be written according to the ''ketiv'', and this is so critical that substituting the ''qere'' for the ''ketiv'' invalidates the entire Torah scroll.<ref>Mishneh Torah, [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925429/jewish/Chapter-Seven.htm Hilchot Mezuzah Tefilin V'Sefer Torah 7:11] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302205959/http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925429/jewish/Chapter-Seven.htm |date=March 2, 2012 }}</ref><ref>pp. 594-95. ''Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations'' by Abraham Joshua Heschel and Gordon Tucker.</ref>\n\nVarious traditional commentaries on the Torah illustrate the interplay of meaning between the ''qere'' and the ''ketiv'', showing how each enhances the meaning of the other. Some examples of this include:\n\n*'''Genesis 8:17''': \"Take out (''ketiv''/written: Send out) all the living things that are with you, from all the flesh: the birds, the animals, all the creeping things that creep over the earth; they shall swarm in the earth and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.\"\n:''[[Rashi]], ibid.'': It is written as \"send out\" and read as \"take out.\" [Noah] is to say to them, \"Go out!\" Thus, [the written form] \"send out.\" If they do not want to go out, you should take them out.\n\n*'''Genesis 12:8''': \"And he [Abram] moved from there to the mountain east of Beit-Eil and set up his tent (''ketiv''/written: her tent); Beit-Eil was in the west and Ai in the east. He built an altar there to the Lord and called in the name of the Lord.\"\n:''Rashi, ibid.'': It is written as \"her tent.\" First, he set up his wife's tent, and afterwards his own. [[Bereishit Rabbah]][, 39:15].\n\n:''[[Siftei Chachamim]], ibid.'': Hows does Rashi know that Abraham erected his wife's tent before his own; maybe he put up his own tent first? His words were based on the words of the [[Talmud]] that \"one should honor his wife more than himself\" (Yevamot 62b).<ref>Chumash, the Gutnick Edition. Compiled and adapted by R. Chaim Miller. Brooklyn: [http://www.kolmenachem.com Kol Menachem], 2006.</ref>\n\n*'''Exodus 39:33''': \"And they brought the [[Mishkan]] to Moses: the tent and all its vessels; its hooks, its beams, its bars (''ketiv''/written: its bar), its pillars, and its sockets.\"\n:''Rashi, Exodus 26:26'': The five [bars which supported the wall-planks and kept them straight] were [in] three [lines going horizontally through each plank of the three walls], but the top and bottom [bars in the three walls] were made of two parts, each extending through half of the wall. Each [bar] would enter a hole [in the wall] on opposite sides until they met each other. Thus we find that the top and bottom [bars] were [really] two [bars each], which were four [half-bars]. The middle bar, however, extended the entire length of the wall, going from end to end of the wall.\n\n:''Mefane'ach Nelamim, cited in Eim LaMikra VeLaMasoret, Exodus 39:33'': The Talmud (Shabbat 98b with Rashi) understands \"from end to end\" as a miracle: after the planks were in place on the three sides of the Mishkan, a seventy-cubit-long bar would be inserted into the center of the first plank at the eastern end of either the northern or southern wall. When that bar reached the end of that wall, it would miraculously curve itself so that it continued within the western wall. At the end of that wall, it again turned to fill the space drilled through the planks of the third wall.... Thus the middle bar, which seemed to be three separate bars for the three walls, was really one long bar. The ''qere'', \"its bars\" refers to the simple interpretation that there were three distinct middle-bars, one for each wall. But the ''ketiv'', \"its bar,\" refers to the second interpretation, that the three middle bars were really only one bar that miraculously spanned all three walls.<ref>Tikkun, the Kestenbaum Edition. Commentary by R. Avie Gold. Brooklyn: [http://www.artscroll.com Mesorah Publications Ltd.], 2004.</ref>\n\n===Other===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\nSome{{who|date=November 2011}} consider the ''qere'' and ''ketiv'' to be matters of scribal opinion, but modern translators nevertheless tend to follow the ''qere'' rather than the ''ketiv''.\n\n==Typography==\nModern editions of the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] and [[Tanakh]] include information about the ''qere'' and ''ketiv'', but with varying formatting, even among books from the same publisher. Usually, the ''qere'' is written in the main text with its vowels, and the ''ketiv'' is in a side- or footnote (as in the Gutnick and Stone editions of the Chumash, from Kol Menachem<ref>[http://www.kolmenachem.com/ Kol Menachem]</ref> and Artscroll,<ref>[http://www.artscroll.com/ Artscroll]</ref> respectively). Other times, the ''ketiv'' is indicated in brackets, in-line with the main text (as in the Rubin edition of the Prophets, also from Artscroll).\n\nIn a [[Tikkun (book)|Tikkun]], which is used to train the synagogue Torah reader, both the full text using the ''ketiv'' and the full text using the ''qere'' are printed, side-by-side. However, an additional note is still made in brackets (as in the Kestenbaum edition from Artscroll) or in a footnote (as in the Tikkun LaKorim from Ktav.<ref>[http://www.ktav.com/ Ktav]</ref>)\n\nIn older prayerbooks (such as the older, all-Hebrew edition of Siddur Tehillat Hashem al pi Nusach HaArizal, in the prayer [[Tikkun Chatzot]]), the ''ketiv'' was vowelized according to the ''qere'' and printed in the main text.

The typeface (which was not used by Rashi himself) is based on 15th century [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] semi-cursive [[handwriting]]. It was taken as a model by early Hebrew typographers such as [[Abraham Garton]], the [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino family]] and [[Daniel Bomberg]], a [[Christians|Christian]] printer in [[Venice]], in their editions of commented texts (such as the [[Mikraot Gedolot]] and the Talmud, in which Rashi's commentaries prominently figure).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shurpin |first1=Yehuda |title=What Is Rashi Script and Where Did It Come From? |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3715921/jewish/What-Is-Rashi-Script-and-Where-Did-It-Come-From.htm |website=chabad.org |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |language=English |quote=It is not clear which Hebrew work can claim the title as the first Jewish book printed, since many of the early Jewish incunabula were printed without a date.

(This was not the first printed edition of Rashi’s commentary; between 1469 and 1472, three brothers, Obadiah, Menasseh and Benjamin of Rome, were known to have printed an edition of Rashi, but it was undated.1) What is unique about the 1475 edition of Rashi is that the printer created and used a new typeface based on existing Sephardic semi-cursive handwriting.}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe initial development of typefaces for the [[printing press]] was often anchored in a pre-existing [[manuscript culture]]. In the case of the Hebrew press, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] tradition prevailed and square or [[block letter]]s were [[movable type|cast]] for [[Biblical]] and other important works. Secondary religious text, such as rabbinic commentaries, was, however, commonly set with a semi-cursive form of Sephardic origin, ultimately normalised as the Rashi typeface.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shurpin |first1=Yehuda |title=What Is Rashi Script and Where Did It Come From? |url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3715921/jewish/What-Is-Rashi-Script-and-Where-Did-It-Come-From.htm |website=chabad.org |accessdate=November 17, 2018 |language=English |quote=In order to distinguish between the biblical text and the commentaries, the biblical text was printed in the common square typeface, while the commentaries were printed in what is today known as Rashi script.}}</ref>\n\nA corresponding but distinctive semicursive typeface was used for printing [[Yiddish language#Printing|Yiddish]].

The '''romanization of Hebrew''' is the use of the [[Latin alphabet]] to [[Transliteration|transliterate]] Hebrew words.\n\nFor example, the Hebrew name spelled {{hebrew|יִשְׂרָאֵל}} (\"Israel\") in the Hebrew alphabet can be romanized as ''{{strong|Yisrael}}'' or ''{{strong|Yiśrāʼēl}}'' in the Latin alphabet.\n\nRomanization includes any use of the Latin alphabet to transliterate Hebrew words. Usually it is to identify a Hebrew word in a non-Hebrew language that uses the Latin alphabet, such as German, Spanish, Turkish, and so on. [[Transliteration]] uses an alphabet to represent the letters and sounds of a word spelled in another alphabet, whereas [[orthographic transcription|transcription]] uses an alphabet to represent the sounds only. Romanization can do both.{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Both what? Transliteration ''already'' includes both by this explanation}}\n\nTo go the other way, that is from English to Hebrew, see [[Hebraization of English]]. Both Hebraization of English and Romanization of Hebrew are forms of transliteration. Where these are formalized these are known as \"transliteration systems\", and, where only some words, not all, are transliterated, this is known as \"transliteration policy\".\n\n== Transliteration ==\n\n=== When to transliterate ===\n{{main|Transliteration}}\nTransliteration assumes two different [[Writing system|script systems]]. The use of a French word in English without translation, such as \"[[bourgeois]]\", is not transliteration. The use of a Hindi word in English such as \"[[khaki]]\" (originally खाकी) is transliteration. Transliteration of a foreign word into another language is usually the exception to translation, and often occurs when there is something distinctive about the word in the original language, such as a [[double entendre]], [[uniqueness]], religious, cultural or political significance,<ref>e.g. rationale of the author of ''Athenian settlements of the fourth century B.C.'' p. xiii Jack Cargill – 1995 \"In relation to Greek words other than personal names, the main issue is deciding when to transliterate, i.e., when to employ an Anglicized Greek word rather than translating the Greek word into English. My tendency is \"when in doubt, ...\"{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=when in doubt, do, or when in doubt, don't?}}</ref> or it may occur to add local flavour.\n\nIn the cases of Hebrew transliteration into English, many Hebrew words have a long history of transliteration, for example [[Amen]], [[Satan]], [[ephod]], [[Urim and Thummim]] have traditionally been transliterated, not translated.<ref>Exodus p. 152 Henry Leopold Ellison – 1982 \"THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS II Exodus 28:1–43 (cont'd) THE EPHOD (28:5 14) We have no means of giving a definitive meaning to 'ephod', the English being simply a transliteration of the Hebrew.\"</ref> These terms were in many cases also first transliterated into Greek and Latin before English.\n\nDifferent publishers have different transliteration policies. For example [[ArtScroll]] publications generally transliterate more words relative to sources such as the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] 1911, or [[Jewish Publication Society]] texts.\n\n=== How to transliterate ===\nThere are various [[transliteration]] standards or systems for Hebrew-to-English; no one system has significant common usage across all fields. Consequently in general usage there are often no hard and fast rules in Hebrew-to-English transliteration, and many transliterations are an approximation due to lack of equivalence between the [[English alphabet|English]] and [[Hebrew alphabet]]s. Conflicting systems of transliteration often appear in the same text, as certain Hebrew words tend to associate with certain traditions of transliteration. For example,\n{{quote|For Hanukkah at the synagogue Beith Sheer Chayyim, Isaac donned his talis that Yitzchak sent him from Bet Qehila in Tsfat, Israel.{{Dubious |reason=This screwball example looks made up by a Wikipedia editor, or if not it appears to be an artifact of careless editing|date=April 2017}}}}\nThis text includes instances of the same word transliterated in different ways: The Hebrew word {{hebrew|בית}} is transliterated as both ''Beith'' and ''Bet''.\n\nThese discrepancies in transliterations of the same word can be traced to discrepancies in the transliterations of individual Hebrew letters, reflecting not only different traditions of transliteration into different languages that use Latin alphabets, but also the fact that different pronunciation styles exist for the same letters in Israel (e.g. mainstream secular Ashkenazi pronunciations used in the media versus Mizrahi, Arab, or Orthodox Ashkenazi colloquial pronunciations). For example, ''Hanukkah'' and ''Chayyim'' are transliterated with different initial letter combinations, although in Hebrew both begin with the letter [[Heth|{{hebrew|ח}}]]; the use of \"ch\" reflects German / Yiddish influence and pronunciation, whereas the \"h\" or \"ḥ\" may indicate a softer pronunciation of [[Heth|{{hebrew|ח}}]] as in ancient [[Hebrew]], [[Judeo-Arabic]] or [[Mizrahi Hebrew]]. Similarly, the Hebrew letter [[Taw|{{hebrew|ת}}]] is transliterated as ''th'' in the word ''Beith'', [[Ashkenazi Hebrew|''s'']] in the word [[tallit|''talis'']], and [[Sephardi Hebrew|''t'']] in the word ''Bet'', even though it is the same letter in all three words in Hebrew. The Hebrew letter [[Qoph|{{hebrew|ק}}]] is transliterated as ''c'' in ''Isaac'', ''k'' in ''Yitzchak'', and ''q'' in ''Qehila''. Finally, the Hebrew letter [[Tsade|{{hebrew|צ}}]] is transliterated variously as ''s'' (in ''Isaac''{{Dubious |reason=\"Issac\" is not not a transliteration but rather the English equivalent|date=April 2017}}), ''tz'' (in ''Yitzchak''), and ''ts'' (in ''Tsfat''), again reflecting different traditions of spelling or pronunciation. These inconsistencies make it more difficult for the non-Hebrew-speaking reader to recognize related word forms, or even to properly pronounce the Hebrew words thus transliterated.\n\n== Historic instances ==\n\nEarly [[romanization]] of Hebrew occurred with the contact between the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] and the [[Jew]]s. It was influenced by earlier [[transliteration]] into the [[Greek language]]. For example, the name of the Roman province of [[Iudaea (Roman province)|Iudaea]] (63 BCE) was apparently derived from the Greek words {{lang|grc|Ἰούδα}} (Iouda) and {{lang|grc|Ἰουδαία}} (Ioudaia). These words can be seen in Chapter 1 of [[Esdras]] (Ezra) in the [[Septuagint]], a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek. The Greek words in turn are transliterations of the Hebrew word {{hebrew|יהודה}} (''Yehuda'') that we now know adapted in English as the names [[Judah (surname)|Judah]], Judas and Jude.\n\nIn the 1st century, [[Satire XIV|Satire 14]] of Juvenal uses the Hebraic words ''sabbata'', ''Iudaicum'', and ''Moyses'', apparently adopted from the Greek.\n\nThe 4th-century and 5th-century Latin translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]] romanize its proper names. The familiar Biblical names in English are derived from these romanizations. The [[Vulgate]], of the early 5th century, is considered the first direct Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible. Apart from names, another term that the Vulgate romanizes is the [[technical terminology|technical term]] ''[[mamzer]]'' ({{hebrew|ממזר}}).\n\nWith the rise of [[Zionism]], some Jews promoted the use of romanization instead of Hebrew script in hopes of helping more people learn Hebrew. One such promoter was Ithamar Ben Yehuda, or [[Ittamar Ben Avi]] as he styled himself. His father [[Eliezer Ben Yehuda]] raised him to be the first modern native speaker of Hebrew. In 1927 Ben-Avi published the biography ''Avi'' in romanized Hebrew (now listed in the online catalog of the [[Jewish National and University Library]]). However, the innovation did not catch on.\n\nPolitical activist [[Ze'ev Jabotinsky]], leader of [[Betar (youth movement)|Betar]], and Chief [[Abraham Isaac Kook|Rabbi Kook]], also expressed their support for the reform of Hebrew script using Latin letters.\n\n== Modern uses ==\n[[File:Giwatajjim066.jpg|thumbnail|Road signs in [[Israel]] written in [[Hebrew]] and romanized Hebrew transliteration]]\nRomanized Hebrew can be used to present Hebrew terminology or text to anyone who is not familiar with the Hebrew script. Many Jewish prayer books include supplementary romanization for some or all of the Hebrew-language congregational prayers.\n\nRomanized Hebrew is also used for Hebrew-language items in library catalogs and Hebrew-language place names on maps. In Israel, most catalogs and maps use the Hebrew script, but romanized maps are easily available and road signs include romanized names. Some Hebrew speakers use romanization to communicate when using internet systems that have poor support for the Hebrew alphabet. Romanized Hebrew is also used in music scores, in part because music is written left-to-right and Hebrew is written right-to-left.\n\nStandard romanizations exist for these various purposes. However, non-standard romanization is widely seen, even on some Israeli street signs. The standards are not generally taught outside of their specific organizations and disciplines.\n\n== Standards ==\n\n*'''Traditional, scholarly''': [[ISO 259]]:1984; [[ISO 259-2]]:1994 (simplified); [[Society of Biblical Literature]] (SBL) Handbook of Style\n*'''National''': for example:\n**''Rules of Transcription: Romanization of Hebrew''. [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]], 1957. Updated and augmented with a simplified version, 2000. Replaced by a new system altogether in 2006.\n**[[DIN 31636]], the German standard.\n*{{Section link|Artscroll|Transliteration system}}\n*'''Bibliographic data''': ANSI Z39.25-1975; [[American Library Association|ALA]]/[[Library of Congress|LC]] Romanization Tables (1991) and their book ''Hebraica Cataloging'' (1987), with ''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'' (1972–1993) as an authority on names and common terms. Library of Congress Authorities is an online database that records and sources the forms of subjects, names, and titles that the Library of Congress uses.\n*'''Geographic names''': [[United States Board on Geographic Names|BGN]]/PCGN 1962 (US and UK), approximately equivalent to [[UNGEGN]] 1977 (United Nations), as both are based on the Academy of the Hebrew Language recommendations. However, BGN provides more and somewhat different specific recommendations. The GEONet Names Server is an authoritative online database that lists BGN names and assists with font character availability and conventional forms of names.\n*'''Phonemic''': [[ISO 259-3|ISO/FDIS 259-3:1999]] (not an adopted standard)\n\n===Comparative table===\n\nThe following table is a breakdown of each letter in the Hebrew alphabet, describing its name or names, and its [[Latin script]] [[transliteration]] values used in academic work. If two glyphs are shown for a consonant, then the left-most glyph is the final form of the letter (or right-most glyph if your browser doesn't support right-to-left text layout). The conventions here are [[ISO 259]], the UNGEGN system based on the old-fashioned Hebrew Academy system,<ref name=\"Report on UN Romanization\">[http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/rom1_he.pdf \"Report on the Current Status of United Nations Romanization Systems for Geographical Names\"], Compiled by the UNGEGN Working Group on Romanization Systems Version 4.0, February 2013</ref> and the modern common informal [[Israel]]i transcription. In addition, an [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] pronunciation is indicated&mdash;historical ([[Tiberian vocalization]]) for ISO 259, prescribed for Hebrew Academy, and in practice for Israeli. For the vowels further down, the letters ח and ט are used as symbolic anchors for vowel symbols, but should otherwise be ignored.\n\nFor the letters {{hebrew|בּ גּ דּ כּ פּ תּ}} with [[dagesh]] in ISO 259 Classical Hebrew and by the Hebrew Academy standard, they are transcribed as single graphemes (b g d k p t) at the beginnings of words, after other consonants, and after [[Shva|shewa]] ְ&nbsp; or ẖatafim ֱ&nbsp; ֲ&nbsp; ֳ&nbsp;. In almost every other situation, they are transcribed as double letters (bb gg dd kk pp tt). This does not apply to common Israeli Hebrew transliteration, where there are no double consonants.\n\nThe letters {{hebrew|א ה}} at the ends of words without additional [[niqqud]] are silent and not transliterated. The letter {{hebrew|ו}} at the end of a word with ẖolam ֹ&nbsp; is also silent and not transliterated. The letter {{hebrew|י}} at the end of a word after ẖiriq ִ&nbsp; is also silent and not transliterated. The situation of the letter {{hebrew|י}} at the end of a word after ẕere ֵ&nbsp; or seggol ֶ&nbsp; is more complicated, as they are silent in Classical Hebrew and in Hebrew Academy prescription and not transliterated in those systems, but they form diphthongs (ei) in Israeli Hebrew&mdash;see the vowels and diphthongs sections further down. In any event, the shewa naẖ is placed between two adjacent consonants in all situations; if there is not even a shewa naẖ between consonants, then the first of the two consonants is silent and not transliterated&mdash;this is usually one of {{hebrew|א ו י}}, but even occasionally {{hebrew|ה}} and rarely {{hebrew|ש}} (in the name {{hebrew|יִשָּׂשכָר}} [[Issachar]]) are encountered silent in this fashion. In Israeli Hebrew transcription, a vowel before yud at the end of a word or before yud then shewa naẖ inside a word, is transcribed as a diphthong (ai oi ui)&mdash;see the diphthongs section further down.\n\nIn Classical Hebrew transliteration, vowels can be long (gāḏōl), short (qāṭān) or ultra short (ḥăṭep̄), and are transliterated as such. Ultra short vowels are always one of šəwā nāʻ ְ&nbsp;, ḥăṭep̄ səḡōl ֱ&nbsp;, ḥăṭep̄ páṯaḥ ֲ&nbsp; or ḥăṭep̄ qāmeṣ ֳ&nbsp;. Šəwā ְ&nbsp; is ''always'' always šəwā nāʻ (pronounced) if it's immediately after the word's first consonant, or after a consonant after a long vowel and before another pronounced consonant&mdash;otherwise, šəwā is realized as šəwā nāḥ (silent). The vowels ṣērē ֵ&nbsp; and ḥōlem ֹ&nbsp; are always long in all situations. The vowels ḥīreq ִ&nbsp;, səḡōl ֶ&nbsp;, páṯaḥ ַ&nbsp;, qāmeṣ ָ&nbsp;, qibbūṣ ֻ&nbsp; and šūreq {{hebrew|וּ}}&nbsp; are always long if they are the stressed syllable, or if they are in a syllable before only one consonant and another vowel, and in these cases they are transliterated as long. If they are unstressed and before a double consonant or a consonant cluster, or in the word's final ''unstressed'' syllable, then they are always short and transliterated as short. But if a vowel carries an accent ֫&nbsp; or a meteg ֽ&nbsp;, then it is always long&mdash;a meteg in particular is often used in places where a vowel is long but not necessarily the word's stressed syllable. Lastly, there are exceptional circumstances when long vowels&mdash;even ṣērē and ḥōlem&mdash;may not force a following šəwā to become šəwā nāʻ, including for example names such as {{hebrew|גֵּרְשֹׁם}} [[Gershom|Gēršōm]] (not Gērəšōm as it might seem), {{hebrew|בֵּלְשַׁאצַּר}} [[Belshazzar|Bēlšaṣṣạr]] (not Bēləšaṣṣạr) and {{hebrew|צִֽקְלַג}} [[Ziklag|Ṣīqlạḡ]] (not Ṣīqəlạḡ). Some of these seem to be learned exceptions, and most words under the same circumstances have šəwā nāʻ as expected, such as {{hebrew|נָֽצְרַת}} [[Nazareth|Nāṣərạṯ]] (not Nāṣrạṯ). (This is ''all'' moot in Israeli Hebrew, where, as already mentioned, [[shva nach]] tends to opportunistically replace [[shva na]] where comfortable, so {{hebrew|נָֽצְרַת}} is Natzrat not Natzerat, etc.)\n\nFor the vowel qamaẕ ָ, whether the vowel is long or short in Classical Hebrew affects the pronunciation in Academy or Israeli Hebrew, even though vowel length is not phonemic in those systems, and the difference is transliterated accordingly. Qamaẕ qatan when short is /o/, except when at the end of a word when not before a final consonant, in which case it is /a/. Qamaẕ gadol is ''usually'' /a/, but in rare situations in Classical Hebrew it can be treated as a long open /ọ/, which although pronounced identically to /ā/ (both were {{IPA|[ɔː]}}), this a/o distinction is clearly made in the pronunciation of Academy and Israeli Hebrew, and is thus transliterated.\n\nIf any word ends with one of {{hebrew|הַּ חַ עַ}}, then the vowel pataẖ is pronounced ''before'' the consonant, not after as it is written, and so the ''transliterated'' sequence is /ah/, /aẖ/, /aʻ/, etc.\n\nIn certain rare words that are meant to begin with two consecutive consonants even in Classical Hebrew, an invisible səḡōl qāṭān vowel is pronounced before the two consonants in Classical Hebrew and is so transcribed, because Classical words may not begin with more than one consonant. This rule does not apply to Academy and Israeli Hebrew, where consonant clusters are more tolerated. For example, the word {{hebrew|שְׁתַּ֫יִם}} (\"two\") would appear as štáyim, but is actually ʼeštáyim.{{Dubious |reason=where is the glottal stop and \"eh\" sound coming from?|date=April 2017}} However, it remains simply shtayim in Academy and Israeli Hebrew.\n\nIn 2006, the Hebrew Academy replaced their 1953 transliteration rules with new rules, and these were adopted as a United Nations standard in 2007.<ref name=\"Report on UN Romanization\" /> {{As of|2008}}, migration to the new transliteration standard is still underway, and many signs and documents still use the 1953 conventions. The new 2006 rules attempt to more closely follow Israeli Hebrew vowel habits (such as the collapse of many shva na), but stop short of adopting most of the informal transliteration patterns. It still transliterates the diphthong {{IPA|[e̞͡ɪ]}} as /e/, and it still transliterates separate /ẖ/ and /kh/ in all cases. It is unspecific about rules governing the transliteration of phonemes not traditionally native to Hebrew.\n\n====Table====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Symbol\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" | Common Israeli\n! colspan=\"4\" | Hebrew Academy\n! colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" | ISO 259\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | 2006\n! colspan=\"2\" | 1953\n|-\n!

One extreme is to make a phonetic transcription of one person's speech on one occasion.\n\nIn Israel, a pronunciation known as General Israeli Hebrew or Standard Hebrew is widely used and documented. For Israeli speech and text where linguistic groups are not at issue, romanization can use a phonetic transcription according to Standard Hebrew pronunciation. However, there are many Israeli groups with differing pronunciations of Hebrew and differing social priorities.\n\nAn attempt to devise a more general system of romanization is complicated by the long and varied history of the Hebrew language. Most Hebrew texts can be appropriately pronounced according to several different systems of pronunciation, both traditional and modern. Even today, it is customary to write Hebrew using only consonants and [[matres lectionis]]. There was no way to indicate vowels clearly in Hebrew writing until the time of the [[Second Temple]]. Since an earlier time, multiple geographically separated communities have used Hebrew as a language of literature rather than conversation.\n\nOne system of assigning and indicating pronunciation in Hebrew, the [[Tiberian vocalization]], is broadly authoritative for Hebrew text since the end of the Second Temple period (Sáenz-Badillos, page xi). It is possible to accommodate the pronunciations of different communities by transliterating the Tiberian vocalization without attempting to transcribe a specific phonetic pronunciation.\n\nNotable varieties of Hebrew for which Tiberian vocalization is not suitable are the Hebrew of the Qumran community (as known from the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]) and of the [[Samaritan]]s. For romanizations of Samaritan pronunciation, it is advisable to take quotations directly from a Samaritan edition of the Hebrew Bible, which has approximately 6,000 textual variations from Jewish editions.\n\nIt is appropriate to focus only on the consonantal spelling when discussing unusually structured words from ancient or medieval works.\n\n== Use of Tiberian principles ==\n{{Main|Tiberian vocalization}}\n\nThe Tiberian vocalization was devised in order to add indications of pronunciation to the consonantal text of the Hebrew Bible, without changing the consonantal text. It was intended for experts in Biblical Hebrew grammar and morphology.\n\nTransliterations usually avoid the typographically complex marks that are used in Tiberian vocalization. They also attempt to indicate vowels and syllables more explicitly than Tiberian vocalization does. Therefore a technical transliteration requires the use of Tiberian principles, as mentioned below, rather than simply representing the Tiberian symbols. Many transliteration standards require a thorough knowledge of these principles, yet they usually do not provide practical details.\n\n=== Vowels ===\n* There are seven basic vowels.\n* A vowel may be long, short, or ultrashort.\n* The vowel \"shva\" may be sounded (shva na) or silent (shva nach).\n* Consonants that have been used historically to indicate vowels, the \"matres lectionis\", are no substitute for proper vowel marks.\n* The vowel \"kamets\" may have its usual sound (kamets gadol – long \"a\") or a different sound (kamets katan – short \"o\").\n\n=== Consonants ===\n\n* Six consonants (beth, gimel, daleth, kaph, pe, and tav) can be hard or soft. To be specific, they are pronounced either as [[Stop consonant|stops]] or [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]] (\"spirantized\"). For example, the letter bet can be pronounced as \"b\" or \"v\". Tiberian vocalization marks a hard consonant with a ''[[dagesh]] kal'' (in the Hebrew term) or ''lene'' (Latin). A soft consonant lacks a ''dagesh kal'', and is sometimes explicitly marked using ''[[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]]'', an overbar. Transliterations sometimes also use an overbar or underbar to mark a soft consonant. (In Modern Sephardic Hebrew, however, only three consonants—bet, kaph, and pe—retain the hard–soft distinction. In the Ashkenazic style of pronunciation, the soft tav is sounded as \"s\".)\n* A letter that looks like shin may be that letter (when marked with a shin dot) or the letter sin (when marked with a sin dot).\n* Most consonants can undergo [[gemination]]. Tiberian vocalization marks gemination with a ''dagesh hazak'' (in the Hebrew term) or ''forte'' (Latin), which looks the same as ''dagesh kal''.\n* A consonant that is normally silent (most often he) may be sounded if it is a root consonant or possessive ending. Tiberian vocalization marks such a consonant using a mapiq, which looks like a dagesh.\n* A silent vav may be used to hold a holem vowel, but sometimes a vav with holem has consonant value.\n\n== Additional transliteration principles ==\n\nA further complication is that the Roman alphabet does not have as many letters for certain sounds found in the Hebrew alphabet, and sometimes no letter at all. Some romanizations resolve this problem using additional non-Tiberian principles:\n\n* The two letters that represent a stop may be written using the forward and backward quote marks, or similar marks.\n* Certain consonants are considered \"emphatic\" (the consonants ח ט צ), due to being pronounced traditionally toward the back of the mouth. They may be transliterated distinctively by using an underdot.\n* The letter \"vav\" (ו) was once pronounced like English \"w\", in contrast to its current pronunciation identical to the letter \"vet\" (the soft letter ב).\n* The Karmeli transcription (see link at bottom of page) creates additional letters based on similar Hebrew or Cyrillic letters to represent the sounds that lack Roman letters.\n\nFinally, for ease of reading it is common to apply certain principles foreign to Hebrew:\n* Use a hyphen between common prefixes or suffixes and a romanized word.\n* Capitalize the first letter of a proper name, but not its prefixes.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anglicisation]]\n*[[Hebraization of English]]\n*[[Help:IPA/Hebrew]]\n*[[Other alphabets in Morse code#Hebrew]]\n*[[Romanization of Arabic]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* {{cite book|first=Angel|last= Sáenz-Badillos|title=A History of the Hebrew Language|publisher= Cambridge University Press|orig-year=1993|date=2000|isbn=0-521-55634-1}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/di-dn/diaspora/rome.html|title= The Jewish diaspora: Rome|access-date= August 9, 2005}}\n* {{cite web |title= Parallel texts of Ezra in various languages |url= http://www.unboundbible.org/index.cfm?method=unbound.welcome |work= Unbound Bible |access-date= August 16, 2005}}\n* {{cite web|author=Juvenal|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/juvenal/14.shtml|title= Satire 14|publisher=[[The Latin Library]]|access-date= August 9, 2005}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.nostradamus.net/transliteration.htm|title= Transliteration|access-date= August 9, 2005}} Excellent, lively summary of issues and options for transliteration of Hebrew.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bhgrammar.com The entire Hebrew bible transliterated in two different formats], Matthew Anstey\n* [http://gibberish.co.il/transliterate.html Transliteration between Hebrew and Standard English or ISO 259]\n* \"[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885932357&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FPrinter Hebrish or Engbrew]\", Talya Halkin in ''The Jerusalem Post'' (July 6, 2006).\n* [http://www.eki.ee/wgrs/rom1_he.pdf United Nations romanization of Hebrew]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070407223825/http://gnswww.nga.mil/geonames/GNS/index.jsp GEONet Names Server]\n* [http://www.library.yale.edu/cataloging/hebraicateam/Hebraica%20Cataloging/chap1.htm ALA/LC romanization of Hebrew]\n* [http://authorities.loc.gov/ Library of Congress Authorities]\n* Society of Biblical Literature, [http://wwwlibe.ces.org.tw/library/download/The%20SBL%20Handbook%20of%20style.pdf SBL Handbook of Style 2nd edition (archived)], ''[http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/SBLHandbookofStyle.aspx SBL Handbook of Style 2nd edition], ''[https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHSsupp2015-02.pdf Student Supplement for the SBL Handbook of Style, Second edition]''.''\n* Transliterated text of the [[Torah]] and all [[Haftarah|Haftarot]] are available from http://bible.ort.org/ based on [[Sephardi]] pronunciation.\n* [http://www.stav.org.il/karmeli/ The Karmeli Alphabet]; a Romanization developed in Israel that uses extra invented letters\n* [http://www.alittlehebrew.com/transliterate Automatic Hebrew-To-English Transliteration]\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Romanization}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Romanization Of Hebrew}}\n[[Category:Romanization|Hebrew]]\n[[Category:Hebrew language]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]"

The Babylonian [[Talmud]] (tractate Shabbat 104a), on the other hand, attributes this instead to samekh, but samekh did not have such a hollow form in the sacred [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]] that would presumably have been used for the tablets.

This is a contraction of {{lang|he|כּאשר}}, ''ka'asher'' (as, when).\n\nShin is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called ''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|tagin]]'') when written in a [[Sefer Torah]]. See [[Gimmel]], [[Ayin]], [[Teth]], [[Nun (letter)|Nun]], [[Zayin]], and [[Tzade|Tzadi]].\n\nAccording to [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 12:6, the tribe of [[Ephraim]] could not differentiate between Shin and [[Samekh]]; when the [[Gilead]]ites were at war with the [[Ephraimite]]s, they would ask suspected Ephraimites to say the word '''''shi'''bolet''; an Ephraimite would say '''''si'''bolet'' and thus be exposed. From this episode we get the English word [[shibboleth]].\n\n====In Judaism====\nShin also stands for the word [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]], a name for God. Because of this, a [[kohen]] (priest) forms the letter Shin with his hands as he recites the [[Priestly Blessing]]. In the mid 1960s, actor [[Leonard Nimoy]] used a single-handed version of this gesture to create the [[Vulcan salute|Vulcan hand salute]] for his character, [[Mr. Spock]], on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.<ref>[[Star Trek: The Original Series]], episode #30 \"[[Amok Time]]\" (production #34), and ''[[I Am Not Spock]]'', [[Leonard Nimoy]], 1977.</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |people=Nimoy, Leonard (Narrator) |date=February 6, 2014 |title=Live Long and Prosper: The Jewish Story Behind Spock, Leonard Nimoy's Star Trek Character |medium= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyiWkWcR86I |access-date=February 27, 2015 |publisher=Yiddish Book Center }}</ref>\n\nThe letter Shin is often inscribed on the case containing a [[mezuzah]], a scroll of parchment with Biblical text written on it. The text contained in the mezuzah is the [[Shema Yisrael]] prayer, which calls the Israelites to love their God with all their heart, soul and strength. The mezuzah is situated upon all the doorframes in a home or establishment. Sometimes the whole word ''Shaddai'' will be written.\n\nThe Shema Yisrael prayer also commands the Israelites to write God's commandments on their hearts (Deut. 6:6); the shape of the letter Shin mimics the structure of the human [[heart]]: the lower, larger left [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] (which supplies the full body) and the smaller right ventricle (which supplies the lungs) are positioned like the lines of the letter Shin.\n\nA religious significance has been applied to the fact that there are three valleys that comprise the city of Jerusalem's geography: the Valley of Ben Hinnom, Tyropoeon Valley, and [[Kidron Valley]], and that these valleys converge to also form the shape of the letter shin, and that the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] is located where the dagesh (horizontal line) is.  This is seen as a fulfillment of passages such as Deuteronomy 16:2 that instructs Jews to celebrate the Pasach at \"the place the LORD will choose as a dwelling for his Name\" (NIV).\n\nIn the [[Sefer Yetzirah]] the letter Shin is King over Fire, Formed Heaven in the Universe, Hot in the Year, and the Head in the Soul.\n\nThe 13th-century Kabbalistic text Sefer HaTemunah, holds that a single letter of unknown pronunciation, held by some to be the four-pronged shin on one side of the [[teffilin]] box, is missing from the current alphabet. The world's flaws, the book teaches, are related to the absence of this letter, the eventual revelation of which will repair the universe.\n\n==== In Russian ====\n[[File:Cyrillic letter Sha - uppercase and lowercase.svg|thumb|The [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] letter \"[[Sha (Cyrillic)|sha]]\" is sometimes said to derive from the Hebrew letter ''shin'', showing how both letters are nearly identical.]]\nThe corresponding letter for the {{IPAslink|ʃ}} sound in [[Russian language|Russian]] is nearly identical in shape to the Hebrew ''shin''. Given that the [[Cyrillic script]] includes borrowed letters from a variety of different alphabets such as [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], it is often suggested that the letter ''[[Sha (Cyrillic)|sha]]'' is directly borrowed from the Hebrew letter ''shin'' (other hypothesized sources include [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] and [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]]).\n\n====Sayings with Shin====\nThe '''Shin-[[Bet (letter)|Bet]]''' was an old acronym for the Israeli [[Shin Bet|Department of Internal General Security]].\n\nA '''Shin-Shin Clash''' is [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli military]] parlance for a battle between two tank divisions (\"armour\" in Hebrew is שִׁרְיוֹן - ''shiryon'').\n\n'''Sh'at haShin''' (the Shin hour) is the last possible moment for any action, usually military. Corresponds to the English expression ''the eleventh hour''.\n\n==Character encodings==\n\n{{charmap\n|05E9|name1=Hebrew Letter Shin\n|0633|name2=Arabic Letter Seen\n|0634|name3=Arabic Letter Sheen\n|072B|name4=Syriac Letter Shin\n|FB2A|name5=Hebrew Letter Shin With Shin Dot\n|FB2B|name6=Hebrew Letter Shin With Sin Dot\n|FB2C|name7=Hebrew Letter Shin With Dagesh And Shin Dot\n|FB2D|name8=Hebrew Letter Shin With Dagesh And Sin Dot\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|0814|name1=Samaritan Letter Shan\n|10398|name2=Ugaritic Letter Shen\n|10854|name3=Imperial Aramaic Letter Shin\n|10914|name4=Phoenician Letter Shin\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|ש}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shin (Letter)}}\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Arabic letters]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]"

It indicates either the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/ə/}} ('''shva na'''', mobile shva) or the complete absence of a vowel ([[Zero (linguistics)|Ø]]) ('''shva nach''', resting shva).\n\nIt is transliterated as \"e\", \"ĕ\", \"ə\", \"<big>'</big>\" ([[apostrophe]]), or nothing. Note that usage of \"ə\" for shva is questionable: transliterating modern Hebrew Shva Nach with ə or ' is misleading, since it is never actually pronounced {{IPA|[ə]}} – [[Schwa|the vowel {{IPA|[ə]}}]] does not exist in modern Hebrew – moreover, the vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} is probably not characteristic of earlier pronunciations either (see [[Tiberian vocalization#mobile shwa|Tiberian vocalization → Mobile Shwa = Shwa na']]).\n\nA shva sign in combination with the [[Hebrew diacritics|vowel diacritics]] [[patah|patáẖ]], [[segol|segól]] and [[Kamatz Katan|kamáts katán]] produces a \"ẖatáf\": a diacritic for a \"tnuʿá ẖatufá\" (a \"fleeting\" or \"furtive\" vowel).\n\n==Pronunciation in modern Hebrew==\nIn [[Modern Hebrew]], shva is either pronounced /e/ or is mute ([[Zero (linguistics)|Ø]]), regardless of its traditional classification as ''shva nacḥ'' ({{Hebrew|שְׁוָא נָח}}) or ''shva na'' ({{Hebrew|שְׁוָא נָע}}), see following table for examples.

In religious contexts, however, scrupulous readers of the [[Jewish prayer|prayers]] and scriptures do still differentiate properly between ''Shva Nach'' and ''Shva Na'' (e.g. {{transl|he|zĕman}}).\n\n==Traditional classification==\n\nIn traditional Hebrew grammar, shvas are in most cases classified as either \"shva na\" (Heb. שווא נע) or as \"shva naḥ\" (Heb. שווא נח); in a few cases as \"shva meraḥef\" (Heb. שווא מרחף), and when discussing Tiberian pronunciation (ca. from the 8th until the 15th century) some shvas are classified as \"shva ga'ya\" (Heb. שווא געיה).\n\nA shva is categorized according to several attributes of its grammatical context. The three categories of shva relevant to [[Linguistic prescription|standard]] grammar of Modern Hebrew are \"shva na\", \"shva naḥ\" and \"shva meraḥef\"; the following table summarizes four distinguishing attributes which determine these categories:\n\n*Does the shva supersede a vowel or no vowel in the word's [[Inflection|non inflected]] form?\n*Is the preceding letter [[Niqqud|pointed]] with a \"short\" or a \"long\" niqqud-variant?\n*Is the following letter, when [[Begadkefat|בג״ד כפ״ת]], pointed with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh Kal|dagesh qal]] or not?\n*Is the letter which is pointed with shva [[syllabification|assigned to the preceding or to the following syllable]]?\n\nTo help illustrate the first criterion (existence or non-existence of a vowel in the word's non [[Inflection|inflected]] form), the \"location\" of the shva, i.e., the place within the word where the lack of vowel is indicated by it, is marked within the [[phonemic transcription#Narrow versus broad transcription|phonemic transcription]] with an orange [[Zero (linguistics)|linguistic zero]]: <span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">Ø</span>; if existing, the corresponding vowel in the basic (non inflected) form of the example is also marked in orange.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-style=\"font-size:x-small\"\n!rowspan=2|type of shva\n|rowspan=5| \n!colspan=3 rowspan=2|example\n|rowspan=5| \n!colspan=3 rowspan=2|non [[Inflection|inflected]] form of example\n|rowspan=5| \n!rowspan=2|[[Linguistic prescription|standard]] [[syllabification]] \n|rowspan=5| \n!colspan=4|attributes:\n|-style=\"font-size:x-small; background-color:#f0f0f0; line-height:1em\"\n|supersedes in [[Inflection|non inflected]] form:\n|preceding letter's [[niqqud]]:\n|following letter with / without [[Dagesh#Dagesh Kal|dagesh qal]]:\n|[[syllabification|assigned to syllable]]:\n|-style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|na||עֵרְבוֹנוֹת||{{IPA|/er}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">Ø</span>{{IPA|voˈnot/}}||(deposits)||עֵרָבוֹן||{{IPA|/er}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">{{IPA|a}}</span>{{IPA|ˈvon/}}||(deposit)||עֵ—רְבוֹ—נוֹת\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|vowel\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|long\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|without\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|following\n|-style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|naḥ||עֶלְבּוֹנוֹת||{{IPA|/el}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">Ø</span>{{IPA|boˈnot/}}||(insults)||עֶלְבּוֹן||{{IPA|/el}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">Ø</span>{{IPA|ˈbon/}}||(insult)||עֶלְ—בּוֹ—נוֹת\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|no vowel\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|short\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|with\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|preceding\n|-style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|meraḥef||יֶאֶרְכוּ||{{IPA|/je.er}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">Ø</span>{{IPA|ˈχu/}}||(they&nbsp;will&nbsp;last)||יֶאֱרַךְ||{{IPA|/je.eˈr}}<span style=\"color:orange; font-weight:bold;\">{{IPA|a}}</span>{{IPA|χ/}}||(it&nbsp;will&nbsp;last)||יֶ—אֶרְ—כוּ\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|vowel\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|short\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|without\n|style=\"font-size:x-small\"|preceding\n|}\n\n=== Shva Na ===\nIn most cases, traditional Hebrew grammar considers ''shva na'', or the mobile shva, to be an entity that supersedes a vowel that exists in the basic form of a word but not after this word underwent [[inflection]] or [[declension]]. Additionally, any shva marked under an initial letter is classified shva na.\n\nMerely identifying a given shva as being a \"shva na\" offers no indication as to its pronunciation in Modern Hebrew; it is however relevant to the application of standard [[niqqud]], e.g.: a {{rtl-lang|he|בג״ד כפ״ת}} letter following a letter marked with a shva na may not be marked with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh Kal|dagesh qal]] (Modern Hebrew [[phonology]] sometimes disagrees with this [[linguistic prescription]], as in {{rtl-lang|he|זִפְּזְפּוּ}} – 'they zapped\" – in which the second [[Pe (letter)|pe]] is pointed with a dagesh qal although preceded by a shva na), or: the vowel preceding a letter marked with a shva na must be represented by the \"long\" niqqud-variant for that vowel: [[Kamatz|qamats]] and not [[patah|pataḥ]], [[tsere]] and not [[segol]] etc.{{ref label|long-short-variants|↑|}}. Furthermore, in standard [[syllabification]], the letter under which a shva na is marked is grouped with the following syllable.\n\nThe [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]'s transliteration guidelines<ref name=academy>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140703210016/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/TheTranscription/Documents/taatiq2007.pdf Transliteration guidelines from 2006 (p. 4)]</ref> specify that shva na should be transliterated only if pronounced in Modern Hebrew, in which case \"e\" be used for general purposes and \"ĕ\" for precise transliteration. Generally, shva na is sometimes transliterated \"ə\". Concerning Modern Hebrew pronunciation, however, this symbol is misleading, since it is commonly used in linguistics to denote the vowel [[Schwa]], which does not exist in Modern Hebrew.\n\nA shva na can be identified as such by means of the following criteria:\n#when marked under the first letter of a word, as in {{rtl-lang|he|מְרַחֵף}}, {{rtl-lang|he|לְפָנָי}}, and {{rtl-lang|he|שְׁמַע}},\n#when marked under the first of two identical letters,\n#when it's the second of two shvas marked under two consecutive letters (except when marked under the last letter of a word), as in  {{rtl-lang|he|רַעְמְסֵס}} {{small|(Exo. 12:37)}} and {{rtl-lang|he|וישְׁמְעו}} {{small|(Gen. 3:8)}},\n#when the letter before the one under which it is marked is marked with a \"long\" niqqud-variant,{{ref label|long-short-variants|↑|}}, such as the long vowel of either ''yod'' or ''ḥiríq'', as in {{rtl-lang|he|יְחִֽידְֿךָ}} {{small|(Gen. 22:2)}} (''yeḥīdh<sup>ə</sup>kha''), or the long vowel of ''waw'' or ''ḥolam'', as in the words {{rtl-lang|he|הוֹלְכִֿים}}, {{rtl-lang|he|יוֹדְֿעִים}} and {{rtl-lang|he|מוֹכְֿרִים}} (''hōl<sup>ə</sup>khīm'', ''yōd<sup>ə</sup>ʻīm'' and ''mōkh<sup>ə</sup>rīm'') and {{rtl-lang|he|שֹׁפְטִים וְשֹׁטְרִים}}  {{small|(Deut. 16:18)}}, ''\"shōf<sup>ə</sup>ṭīm wa-shōṭ<sup>ə</sup>rīm.\"''\n#when marked under a letter with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh hazak|dagesh ḥazaq]] (historically an indicator of [[gemination]]), as {{rtl-lang|he|מִפְּנֵיכֶם}} {{small|(Lev. 18:24)}} and {{rtl-lang|he|מִקְּדָֿשׁ}} {{small|(Exo. 15:17)}}.<ref name=\"Maḥberet Kitrei Ha-Torah 1990\">''Maḥberet Kitrei Ha-Torah'' (ed. Yoav Pinhas Halevi), chapter 5, Benei Barak 1990 (Hebrew)</ref>{{rp|31}}\n\n''For a more detailed account, see [[Tiberian vocalization#Vowels|Tiberian vocalization → Vowels]].''\n\n=== Shva Naḥ ===\n{{anchor|Shva Nacḥ}}\nTraditional Hebrew grammar defines shva naḥ, or shva quiescens, as indicating the absence of a vowel. In Modern Hebrew, some shvas classified as shva naḥ are nonetheless pronounced {{IPA|/e/}} (e.g. the shva under the second [[dalet]] in the word שָׁדַדְתְּ – {{IPA|/ʃaˈdadet/}} – \"you (f.) robbed\"; see [[#Pronunciation in modern Hebrew|table above]]).\n\nIn all but a small number of cases, a shva not conforming to the criteria listed [[#Shva Na|above]] is classified shva naḥ. This offers no conclusive indication as to its pronunciation in Modern Hebrew; it is however relevant to the application of standard [[niqqud]], e.g.: a בג״ד כפ״ת letter following a letter marked with a shva nacḥ must be marked with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh Kal|dagesh qal]] (Modern Hebrew [[phonology]] sometimes disagrees with this [[linguistic prescription]], as in לְפַסְפֵס – \"to miss\" – in which the second [[Pe (letter)|pe]] lacks a dagesh qal although preceded by a shva naḥ), or: the vowel preceding a letter marked with a shva naḥ must be represented by the \"short\" niqqud-variant for that vowel: [[patah|pataḥ and not]] [[Kamatz|qamats]], [[segol]] and not [[tsere]] etc.{{ref label|long-short-variants|↑|}}. Furthermore, in standard [[syllabification]], the letter under which a shva naḥ is marked is grouped with the preceding syllable.\n\nThe [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]'s transliteration guidelines<ref name=academy/> specify that shva naḥ should not be represented in transliteration.\n\n=== Shva Meraḥef ===\n\"Shva meraḥef\" is the grammatical designation of a shva which does not comply with all criteria characterizing a shva na (specifically, one marked under a letter following a letter marked with a \"short\", not a \"long\", niqqud-variant{{ref label|long-short-variants|↑|}}), but which does, like a shva na, supersede a vowel (or a shva na) that exists in the basic form of a word but not after this word underwent [[inflection]] or [[declension]].\n\nThe classification of a shva as \"shva meraḥef\" is relevant to the application of standard [[niqqud]], e.g.: a בג״ד כפ״ת letter following a letter marked with a shva meraḥef should not be marked with a [[Dagesh#Dagesh Kal|dagesh qal]], although the vowel preceding this letter could be represented by the \"short\" niqqud-variant for that vowel.{{ref label|long-short-variants|↑|}} This reflects sometimes, but not always, pronunciation in Modern Hebrew, e.g. מַלְכֵי (\"kings of\") is commonly pronounced in accordance with the standard form, {{IPA|/malˈχej/}} (with no dagesh qal in the letter [[Kaph|kaf]]), whereas כַּלְבֵי (\"dogs of\"), whose standard pronunciation is {{IPA|/kalˈvej/}}, is commonly pronounced {{IPA|/kalˈbej/}} (as if there were a dagesh qal in the letter [[Bet (letter)|bet]]). In standard [[syllabification]], the letter under which a shva meraḥef is marked is grouped with the preceding syllable.\n\n=== Shva Ga'ya ===\n[[File:Ga‘yá.png|thumb|The word /vənā'šūḇā/ in ''[[Book of Lamentations|Ekhah]]'' (Lamentations) 5:21. The ga'ja in the word (marked in red) renders the shva stressed. In the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese]] [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] tradition, the pronunciation is ['vanā'šūḇā].]]\n\"Shva Ga'ya\" designates a shva marked under a letter that is also marked with the [[cantillation]] mark \"[[Meteg|ga'ya]]\" ({{Hebrew|<big>גַּעְיָה</big>}} lit. \"bleating\" or \"bellowing\")<ref name=\"Maḥberet Kitrei Ha-Torah 1990\" />{{rp|22-23}}, or \"meteg\", e.g. the shva under the letter [[Bet (letter)|bet]] in the word בְּהוֹנוֹת (\"toes\") would normally be classified a shva na and be transliterated \"e\": \"behonót\" (or according to the precise standard,<ref name=academy/> \"ĕ\": \"bĕhonót\"), however, if marked with the ga'ya cantillation mark, [[File:Shwa-gaja.jpg|50px]], this shva is classified as shva ga'ya, and the transliteration reflecting its historical pronunciation would be \"bohonót\". For more on the strict application of the Shva Ga'ya, see {{main article|Yemenite Hebrew#Strict Application of Mobile Shewā}}.\n\n==T'nua hatufa==\n\nWithin [[niqqud]], vowel [[Hebrew diacritics|diacritics]] are sorted into three groups: \"big\", \"small\" and \"fleeting\" or \"furtive\" (\"T'nuot g'dolot\" – \"גדולות\", \"T'nuot k'tanot\" – \"קטנות\" and \"T'nuot chatufot\" \"חטופות\"), sometimes also referred to as \"long\", \"short\" and \"very short\" or \"ultrashort\". This grouping might have correlated to different [[vowel length]]s in earlier forms of Hebrew (see [[Tiberian vocalization#Vowels|Tiberian vocalization → Vowels]]; spoken Israeli Hebrew however does not distinguish between different vowel lengths, thus this orthographic differentiation is not manifest in speech).\n\nThe vowel diacritics classified as \"chatufot\" (\"fleeting\") all share the common feature of being a [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] of a \"small vowel\" diacritic ([[patah|Patach]], [[Segol]] or [[Kamatz Katan]]) plus a shva sign. Similarly, their names are derived from the respective \"small vowel\" diacritic's name plus the [[Noun adjunct|adjunct]] \"chataf\": \"chataf patach\", \"chataf segol\" and \"chataf kamatz\".\n\nAs with a shva na, standard ([[Linguistic prescription|prescribed]]) [[syllabification]] determines that letters [[Niqqud|pointed]] with a \"fleeting vowel\" diacritic be considered part of the subsequent [[syllable]], even if in modern Hebrew pronunciation this diacritic represents a full-fledged syllable, thus e.g. the [[phonology|phonologically]] trisyllabic word \"הֶעֱמִיד\" (\"he placed upright\"), pronounced {{IPA|/he.eˈmid/}}, should [[standard language|standardly]] be syllabified into only two syllables, \"הֶ—עֱמִיד\" (\"he'emid\").\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! rowspan=2 | Name\n!! rowspan=2 | Symbol\n!! colspan=3 |[[Israeli Hebrew]]\n|-\n!! colspan=1 | [[Help:IPA chart for Hebrew|IPA]]\n!! colspan=1 | [[Transliteration]]\n!! colspan=1 | English<br />approximate\n|-\n| [[Reduced Segol]]<br>(\"ẖatáf segól\")\n| align=\"center\" | [[File:Hataf Segol.svg|35px]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPAblink|e̞}}\n| align=\"center\" | e\n| align=\"center\" | m'''e'''n\n|-\n| [[Reduced Patach]]<br>(\"ẖatáf patáẖ\")\n| align=\"center\" | [[File:Hataf Patah.svg|35px]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPAblink|ä}}\n| align=\"center\" | a\n| align=\"center\" | c'''u'''p\n|-\n| [[Reduced Kamatz]]<br>(\"ẖatáf kamáts\")\n| align=\"center\" | [[File:3 Hataf Qamaz.PNG|35px]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPAblink|o̞}}\n| align=\"center\" | o\n| align=\"center\" | cl'''o'''ck\n|-\n| Reduced Hiriq<br>(\"ẖatáf ẖiríq\") – not in current use, appears rarely<ref>[[I Kings]] [[s:he:מלכים א יז יא|17:11]] \"לקחי־נא\"; [[Psalms]] [[s:he:תהלים יד א|14:1]] \"השחיתו\",\"התעיבו\"; Psalms [[s:he:תהלים נג ב|53:2]] \"השחיתו\", \"והתעיבו\"</ref> in the [[Aleppo Codex]]<ref>[http://www.hagigim.com/modules.php?name=Forums&file=printview&t=14292&start=0 hagigim.com]</ref>\n| align=\"center\" | [[File:Hataf hiriq.png|35px]]\n| align=\"center\" | {{IPAblink|i}}\n| align=\"center\" | i\n| align=\"center\" | '''i'''t\n|-\n|}\n\n===Comparison table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! colspan=8 | Vowel comparison table\n|- align=center\n! colspan=3 | [[Vowel Length]]<br />{{small|(phonetically not manifested in Israeli Hebrew)}}\n! colspan=2 | [[Help:IPA chart for Hebrew|IPA]]\n! rowspan=2 | [[Transliteration]]\n! rowspan=2 | English<br>approximate\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n!

It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ت}}\n\nFinal {{lang|ar| ـَتْ }} (''[[fathah]]'', then {{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ&#x202f;}} with a [[sukun]] on it, [[Arabic phonology|pronounced]] {{IPA|/at/}}, though diacritics are normally omitted) is used to mark feminine gender for third-person [[perfective aspect|perfective]]/[[past tense]] verbs, while final {{lang|ar| تَ }} ({{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ-fatḥah}}, {{IPA|/ta/}}) is used to mark past-tense second-person singular masculine verbs, final {{lang|ar| تِ }} ({{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ-kasrah}}, {{IPA|/ti/}}) to mark past-tense second-person singular feminine verbs, and final {{lang|ar| تُ }} ({{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ-[[damma|ḍammah]]}}, {{IPA|/tu/}}) to mark past-tense first-person singular verbs. The plural form of Arabic letter {{lang|ar|ت }} is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼāt}}'' ({{lang|ar|تاءات}}), a [[palindrome]].\n\nRecently the isolated {{lang|ar| ت }} has been used online as an [[emoticon]], because it resembles a smiling face.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Tāʼ marbūṭah===\nAn alternative form called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ marbūṭah}}'' ({{Lang|ar|تاء مربوطة}}, \"bound ''{{transl|ar|DIN|tāʼ&nbsp;}}''\") is used at the end of words to mark [[grammatical gender|feminine gender]] for [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s. In [[Modern Standard Arabic]], it denotes {{IPA|/-a/}} or {{IPA|/-at/}}. Regular ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ}}'', to distinguish it from ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ marbūṭah}}'', is referred to as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ maftūḥah}}'' ({{Lang|ar|تاء مفتوحة}}, \"open ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ&nbsp;}}''\").\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ة}}\n\nIn words such as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|risālah}}'' {{Lang|ar|رسالة}} ('letter, message'), ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ marbūṭah}}'' is denoted as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|h}}'', and pronounced as {{IPA|/-a/}}. When a word ending with a tāʼ marbūṭah is suffixed with a [[ʾIʿrab#Types of declension|grammatical case ending]] or (in Modern Standard Arabic or the dialects) any other suffix, the {{IPA|/t/}} is clearly pronounced. For example, the word {{lang|ar|رسالة}} ('letter, message') is pronounced as ''{{transl|ar|Wehr|risāla}}'' in [[pausa]] but is pronounced ''{{transl|ar|risālatu}}'' in the nominative case ({{IPA|/u/}} being the nominative case ending). The pronunciation is {{IPA|/t/}}, just like a regular ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ&#x202f;}}'' ({{Lang|ar|ت}}), but the identity of the \"character\" remains a ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ marbūṭah}}''. Note that the isolated and final forms of this letter combine the shape of ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|hāʼ&#x202f;}}'' and the two dots of ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ&#x202f;}}''.\n\nWhen words containing the symbol are borrowed into other languages written in the Arabic alphabet (such as [[Persian language|Persian]]), ''{{Transl|ar|ALA|tāʼ marbūṭah}}'' usually becomes either a regular {{lang|ar|[[ه]]}} or a regular {{lang|ar|ت}}.\n\n==Hebrew tav==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !! <small>[[Sans-serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">ת</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:28pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">ת</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">ת</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Taf handwriting.svg|26px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Taf Rashi.png|40px]]\n|}\n\nHebrew spelling: <big>{{lang|he|תָו}}</big>\n\n===Hebrew pronunciation===\nThe letter ''tav'' in modern Hebrew usually represents a [[voiceless alveolar plosive]]: {{IPA|/t/}}.\n\n==== Variations on written form and pronunciation ====\nThe letter ''tav'' is one of the six letters that can receive a [[dagesh kal]] diacritic; the others are [[beth (letter)|bet]], [[gimel]], [[dalet]], [[kaph]] and [[pe (letter)|pe]]. Bet, kaph and pe have their sound values changed in modern Hebrew from the fricative to the plosive, by adding a dagesh. In modern Hebrew, the other three do not change their pronunciation with or without a dagesh, but they have had alternate pronunciations at other times and places.\n\nIn traditional [[Ashkenazi]] pronunciation, tav represents an {{IPA|/s/}} without the [[dagesh]] and has the plosive form when it has the dagesh. Among [[Yemenite Jews|Yemen]] and some [[Sephardi]] areas, tav without a dagesh represented a [[voiceless dental fricative]] {{IPA|/θ/}} - a pronunciation hailed by the [[Bension Kohen|Sfath Emeth]] work as wholly authentic, while the tav with the dagesh is the plosive {{IPA|/t/}}. In traditional [[Italian Jews|Italian]] pronunciation, tav without a dagesh is sometimes {{IPA|/d/}}.{{clarify|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Significance of tav===\nIn [[gematria#Values table|gematria]], tav represents the number 400, the largest single number that can be represented without using the ''sophit'' (final) forms (see [[kaph]], [[mem]], [[nun (letter)|nun]], [[Pe (letter)|pe]], and [[tzade]]).\n\nIn representing names from foreign languages, a ''[[Hebrew numerals#Gershayim|geresh]]'' or ''chupchik'' can also be placed after the tav ({{lang|he|ת׳}}), making it represent {{IPAslink|θ}}. (See also: [[Hebraization of English]])\n\n====In Judaism====\nTav is the last letter of the Hebrew word ''emet'', which means '[[truth]]'. The [[midrash]] explains that ''emet'' is made up of the first, middle, and last letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] ([[aleph]], [[mem]], and tav: {{lang|he|אמת}}). ''Sheqer'' (שקר, falsehood), on the other hand, is made up of the 19th, 20th, and 21st (and penultimate) letters.\n\nThus, truth is all-encompassing, while falsehood is narrow and deceiving. In [[Jewish mythology]] it was the word ''emet'' that was carved into the head of the [[golem]] which ultimately gave it life.  But when the letter ''aleph'' was erased from the golem's forehead, what was left was \"''met''\"—dead.  And so the golem died.\n\n[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 9:4 depicts a vision in which the ''tav'' plays a [[Passover]] role similar to the blood on the lintel and doorposts of a Hebrew home in Egypt.<ref>''Exodus'' 12:7,12.</ref> In Ezekiel’s vision, the Lord has his angels separate the demographic wheat from the chaff by going through Jerusalem, the capital city of ancient Israel, and inscribing a mark, a tav, “upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof.”\n\nIn Ezekiel's vision, then, the Lord is counting tav-marked Israelites as worthwhile to spare, but counts the people worthy of annihilation who lack the tav and the critical attitude it signifies. In other words, looking askance at a culture marked by dire moral decline is a kind of [[shibboleth]] for loyalty and zeal for God.<ref>Cf. the New Testament's condemnation of lukewarmness in ''Revelation'' 3:15-16</ref>\n\n====Sayings with taf====\n\"From aleph to taf\" describes something from beginning to end, the Hebrew equivalent of the English \"From A to Z.\"\n\n==Syriac taw==\nIn the [[Syriac alphabet]], as in the Hebrew and Phoenician alphabets, taw (<big>{{lang|syc|ܬ}}</big>) is the last letter in the alphabet.  It represents either {{IPA|/t/}} ([[voiceless alveolar plosive]]) or between a {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} sound.\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!{{transl|syc|Esṭrangelā}}<br />(classical) !! {{transl|syc|Madnḥāyā}}<br />(eastern) !!
