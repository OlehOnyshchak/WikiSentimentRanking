It is the 16th letter of the modern Arabic alphabet. The [[Persian language|Persian]] ṭa is pronounced as a hard \"t\" sound and is the 19th letter in the modern [[Persian alphabet]]. The Phoenician letter also gave rise to the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[theta]] ({{lang|el|Θ}}), originally an [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] [[voiceless alveolar stop]] but now used for the [[voiceless dental fricative]]. The Arabic letter is sometimes transliterated as ''tah'' in English,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+FEC4 |title=“ﻄ” U+FEC4 Arabic Letter Tah Medial Form Unicode Character |website=comport|date=  |author= |accessdate= 7 June 2019}}</ref> for example in [[Arabic script in Unicode]].\n\nThe sound value of Teth is {{IPAslink|tˤ}}, one of the Semitic [[emphatic consonant]]s.\n\n==Origins==\nThe Phoenician letter name {{Transl|sem|ṭēth}} means \"wheel\", but the letter possibly (according to Brian Colless{{cn|date=November 2017}}) continues a [[Proto-Sinaitic script|Middle Bronze Age]] glyph named {{Transl|sem|ṭab}} \"good\", ''Tav'' in Aramaic and ''Tov'' {{Hebrew|טוב}} in Hebrew, ''ṭayyib'' {{lang|ar|طَيّب}} in modern Arabic, based on the ''nfr'' \"good\" [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]]:\n\n<hiero>F35</hiero>\n\nJewish scripture books about the \"holy letters\" from the 10th century and on discuss the connection or origin of the letter Teth with the word Tov,<ref>This was especially emphasized ever since the late 1600s after the [[Baal Shem Tov]] became influential, since the letter Teth was in his Acronym standing for Tov, and goodness was part of his philosophy.</ref> and the [[acrostic]] poems of the Bible use 'Tov' to depict the letter.<ref>e.g. Psalm 119:65-72</ref>\n\n==Arabic ṭāʾ==\nThe letter is named ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|ṭāʾ&nbsp;}}''; [[Modern Standard Arabic]] pronunciation: {{IPA|/tˤ/}}. \n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ط}}\n\n==Hebrew Tet==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!|<small>[[Serif]]</small> !! <small>[[sans-Serif]]</small> !! <small>[[Monospaced]]</small>!!<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br>Hebrew]]</small>!!<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Times New Roman', 'SBL Hebrew', David, Narkisim, 'Taamey Frank CLM', serif;\">ט</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:28pt Arial, 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', 'DejaVu Sans', Tahoma, Alef, sans-serif;\">ט</span>\n|width=20%|<span style=\"font:30pt 'Courier New', 'Miriam Fixed', FreeMono, monospace;\">ט</span>\n|width=20%|[[File:Hebrew letter Tet handwriting.svg|24px]]\n|width=20%|[[File:Rashi-tet.png|35px]]\n|}\n\nThe Hebrew spelling of name of the letter: <big>{{Hebrew|טֵית}}</big>\n\n===Hebrew pronunciation===\nIn [[Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], Tet represents a [[voiceless alveolar plosive]] {{IPA|/t/}}, although this can be [[Pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] to produce {{IPA|[tˤ]}} in traditional [[Yemenite Jews|Temani]] and [[Sephardi]] pronunciation.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], Tet represents the number nine. When followed by an apostrophe, it means 9,000. The most common example of this usage is in the numbers of the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]] (e.g., {{Hebrew|ט'תשנד}} in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[Calendar date|date]] 9754).\n\nAs well, in gematria, the number 15 is written with Tet and [[Waw (letter)|Vav]], (9+6) to avoid the normal construction [[Yodh|Yud]] and [[He (letter)|Hei]] (10+5) which spells a [[Names of God in Judaism|name of God]]. Similarly, 16 is written with Tet and [[Zayin]] (9+7) instead of [[Yodh|Yud]] and [[Waw (letter)|Vav]] (10+6) to avoid spelling part of the [[Tetragrammaton]].\n\nTet is also one of the seven letters which receive special crowns (called ''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|tagin]]'') when written in a [[Sefer Torah]]. See [[Shin (letter)|Shin]], [[Ayin]], [[Gimmel]], [[Nun (letter)|Nun]], [[Zayin]], and [[Tzade|Tzadi]].\n\n==Similar symbols==\nA symbol similar to the Phoenician teth is used for the [[tensor product]], as <math>\\otimes</math>, but this is presumably an independent development, by modification of the [[multiplication sign]] ×.

      "text": "{{no footnotes|date=April 2015}}\n[[File:Aleppo Codex Joshua 1 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Closeup of Aleppo Codex, Joshua 1:1]]\nThe '''Tiberian vocalization''', '''Tiberian pointing''', or '''Tiberian niqqud''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Hebrew|נִיקוּד טְבֵרִיָנִי}} ''Nikkud Tveriyani'') is a system of [[diacritic]]s (''[[niqqud]]'') devised by the [[Masoretes]] of [[Tiberias]] to add to the consonantal text of the [[Hebrew Bible]] to produce the [[Masoretic Text]].<ref>The portions of the Hebrew Bible in [[Biblical Aramaic]] use the same system of vocalization.</ref> The system soon became used to vocalize other Hebrew texts, as well. \n\nThe Tiberian vocalization marks vowels and stress, makes fine distinctions of consonant quality and length, and serves as punctuation. While the Tiberian system was devised for [[Tiberian Hebrew]], it has become the dominant system for vocalizing all forms of Hebrew and has long since eclipsed the [[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]] and [[Palestinian vocalization]] systems.\n\n==Consonant diacritics==\nThe [[sin dot]] distinguishes between the two values of {{Hebrew|ש}}. A ''[[dagesh]]'' indicates a consonant is geminate or unspirantized, and a ''[[rafe|raphe]]'' indicates [[spirantization]]. The ''[[mappiq]]'' indicates that {{Hebrew|ה}} is consonantal, not silent, in syllable-coda position.\n\n==Vowel diacritics==\nThe seven vowel qualities of Tiberian Hebrew are indicated straightforwardly by distinct diacritics:\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|niqqud with א\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אַ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֶ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֵ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אִ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אָ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֹ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֻ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אוּ}}\n|-\n|name\n|[[patah]]\n|[[segol]]\n|[[tzere]]\n|[[hiriq]]\n|[[qamatz]]\n|[[holam]]\n|[[qubutz]]\n|[[shuruq]]\n|-\n|value\n|{{IPA|/a/}}\n|{{IPA|/ɛ/}}\n|{{IPA|/e/}}\n|{{IPA|/i/}}\n||{{IPA|/ɔ/}} \n|{{IPA|/o/}}\n|colspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|/u/}}\n|}\nThe diacritics [[qubutz]] and [[shuruq]] both represent {{IPA|/u/}}, but shuruq is used when the text uses full spelling (with [[waw (letter)|waw]] as a [[mater lectionis]]). Each of the vowel phonemes could be allophonically lengthened; occasionally, the length is marked with [[metheg]]. (Then, metheg also can indirectly indicate when a following [[shva]] is vocal.)\n\nThe ultrashort vowels are slightly more complicated. There were two graphemes corresponding to the vowel {{IPA|/ă/}}, attested by alternations in manuscripts like {{Hebrew|ארֲריך~ארְריך, ואשמֳעָה~ואשמְעָה}}.&lrm;.<ref name=\"b105-106\" /> In addition, one of the graphemes could also be silent:\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" style=\"text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|niqqud with א\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אְ}}\n<!-- how does one put a <ref>...</ref> on the ''actual'' alef with svah in the first row, instead of on the word ''shva'' in the second row of the table like I did?\nIf you know how to do it, it would be better I think -->\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֲ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֱ}}\n|style=\"font-family: 'david'; font-size:250%\" height=40 valign=top| {{lang|he|אֳ}}\n|-\n|name\n| [[shva]] \n| [[hataf patah]]\n| [[hataf segol]]\n| [[hataf qamatz]]\n|-\n|value\n|{{IPA|/ă/, ⌀}}\n|{{IPA|/ă/}}\n|{{IPA|/ɛ̆/}}\n|{{IPA|/ɔ̆/}}\n|}\n\n[[File:Tiberian-vocalisation-david-fine.jpg|thumb|300px|Figurines holding Tiberian vowel diacritics.

Segôl ({{Hebrew|סְגוֹל}} bunch of grapes) takes its name from its form. So {{Hebrew|שָׁלֹשׁ נְקֻדּוֹת}} (three points) is another name for Qibbúṣ. Moreover the names were mostly so formed (but only later), that the sound of each vowel is heard in the first syllable ({{Hebrew|קָמֶץ}} for {{Hebrew|קֹמֶץ}},&lrm; {{Hebrew|פַּתַח}} for {{Hebrew|פֶּתַח}},&lrm; {{Hebrew|צֵרִי}} for {{Hebrew|צְרִי}}); in order to carry this out consistently some even write Sägôl, Qomeṣ-ḥatûf, Qûbbûṣ.|sign=[[Wilhelm Gesenius]]|source={{Cite GHG|8|d|nologo=1}}}}\n\n==Cantillation==\n[[Cantillation]] signs mark stress and punctuation.

Its oldest sound value is probably {{IPA|/sˤ/}}, although there is a variety of pronunciation in different modern Semitic languages and their dialects. It represents the coalescence of three [[Proto-Semitic]] \"[[emphatic consonant]]s\" in [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which kept the phonemes separate, introduced variants of {{Transl|ar|DIN|ṣād}} and {{Transl|ar|DIN|[[ṭāʾ]]}} to express the three (see {{Transl|ar|DIN|[[ḍād]]}}, {{Transl|ar|DIN|[[ẓāʾ]]}}). In Aramaic, these emphatic consonants coalesced instead with ''[[Ayin|ʿayin]]'' and ''[[Teth|ṭēt]]'', respectively, thus Hebrew ''ereṣ'' ארץ (earth) is ''araʿ'' ארע in Aramaic.\n\nThe Phoenician letter is continued in the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[San (letter)|San]] (Ϻ) and possibly [[Sampi]] (Ϡ),  and in [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan]] 𐌑 ''Ś''.

This is the same in [[Yiddish]]. Historically, it likely represented a [[pharyngealisation|pharyngealized]] {{IPA|/t͡sˤ/}}; which became {{IPAblink|t͡s}} in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] pronunciation. A ''[[Hebrew numerals#Gershayim|geresh]]'' can also be placed after ''tsade'' ({{Hebrew|צ׳&nbsp;;&nbsp;ץ׳}}), giving it the sound {{IPAblink|t͡ʃ}}, e.g. {{Hebrew|צִ׳יפְּס}} ''{{transl|he|čips}}'', meaning \"chips\".\n\nṢade appears as {{IPA|[sˤ]}} amongst [[Yemenite Jews]] and other Jews from the [[Middle East]]; the loss of [[affricate consonant|affricatisation]] is likely due to influence from Arabic.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], {{transl|he|Ṣadi}} represents the number 90. Its final form represents 900, but this is rarely used, [[Tau (letter)|Taw]], [[Tau (letter)|Taw]], and [[Qoph|Qof]] (400+400+100) being used instead.\n\nAs an abbreviation, it stands for ''ṣafon'', North.\n\n{{transl|he|Ṣadi}} is also one of the seven letters that receive a special crown (called ''tagin'') when written in a [[Sefer Torah]].

In modern Hebrew, tzere is pronounced the same as and indicates the [[phoneme]] /e/ which is the same as the \"e\" sound in s'''e'''ll and is [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliterated]] as an \"e\".  There was a distinction in [[Tiberian Hebrew]] between [[segol]] and Tzere.\n\n==Usage==\nTzere is usually written in these cases:\n* In final stressed closed syllables: מַחְשֵׁב ({{IPA|[maħˈʃev]}}, ''computer''), סִפֵּר ({{IPA|[sipˈpeʁ]}}, ''he told''; without niqqud סיפר). Also in final syllables closed by guttural letters with an added furtive [[patach]]: מַטְבֵּעַ ({{IPA|[matˈbeaʕ]}}, ''coin''), שוֹכֵחַ ({{IPA|[ʃoˈχeaħ]}}, ''forgetting''). Notable exceptions to this rule are:\n** The personal suffixes ־תֶם ({{IPA|[tem]}}, 2 pl. m.), ־תֶן ({{IPA|[ten]}}, 2 pl. f.), ־כֶם ({{IPA|[χem]}}, 2 pl. m.), ־כֶן ({{IPA|[χen]}}, 2 pl. f.), ־הֶם ({{IPA|[hem]}}, 3 pl. m.), ־הֶן ({{IPA|[hen]}}, 3 pl. f.) are written with segol. (But the words הֵם ({{IPA|[hem]}}, ''they m.''), הֵן ({{IPA|[hen]}}, ''they f.'') are written with Tzere.)\n** The words אֱמֶת ({{IPA|[eˈmet]}}, ''truth''), בַּרְזֶל ({{IPA|[baʁˈzel]}}, ''iron''), גַּרְזֶן ({{IPA|[ɡaʁˈzen]}}, ''axe''), כַּרְמֶל ({{IPA|[kaʁˈmel]}}, ''[[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]'', ''gardenland''), עֲרָפֶל ({{IPA|[ʕaʁaˈfel]}}, ''fog'') are written with segol.\n** The word בֵּן ({{IPA|[ben]}}, ''son, boy'') is written with tzere in the absolute state, but with segol in the [[construct state]]: בֶּן־. In the Bible this rule also applies to other words which end in tzere, when they are written with [[maqaf]].<ref>Academy Decisions: Grammar, 2nd edition, §1.4 ב.</ref>\n* In non-final, unstressed open syllables: עֵנָב ({{IPA|[ʕeˈnav]}}, ''grape''), תֵּבָה ({{IPA|[teˈva]}}, ''chest'', ''ark''; without niqqud תיבה).\n* In the first (stressed) syllable of about 70 [[segolate]] words, among them חֵלֶק ({{IPA|[ˈħeleq]}}, ''part''), סֵפֶר ({{IPA|[ˈsefeʁ]}}, ''book''), עֵדֶן ({{IPA|[ˈʕeden]}}, ''Eden'').<ref>A full list appears in [http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/GrammarDecisions/1/Pages/Ch1D059.aspx Academy Decisions: Grammar, 2nd edition, §1.4 כ].</ref> In other – much more numerous – segolate words the first {{IPA|[e]}} sound is a [[segol]].\n* In final open syllables, when the [[mater lectionis]] is [[yodh|yod]] (י) or [[aleph]] (א&lrm;): בְּנֵי־ ({{IPA|[bəne]}}, ''sons of''), מוֹצֵא ({{IPA|[moˈtse]}}, ''finding''). When the mater lectionis is [[he (letter)|he]] (ה), the vowel sign is usually [[segol]], but tzere is written in the imperative and absolute infinitive forms of the verb, in nouns in construct state, and in the base form of several other nouns (see below for details).\n\nIn declension tzere sometimes changes to other vowels or to [[shva]]. The full rules for these changes were formulated the Academy of the Hebrew Language.<ref name=\"academy-decisions-1-4\" />\n\nIn modern Hebrew there are words which are [[homophone]]s and [[homograph]]s in spelling without niqqud, but are written differently with niqqud, the difference being segol and tzere. For example, עֶרֶב ''evening'' and עֵרֶב ''[[weft]]'' are both pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʕeʁev]}} and written ערב without niqqud (these words also have different etymology).\n\n==Writing tzere with and without matres lectionis==\n{{Main article|Mater lectionis}}\n''Tzere'' can be written with and without matres lectionis. The most prominent mater lectionis for tzere is [[Yodh|Yod]] ({{Hebrew|י}}), and in some cases it is used with the letters [[aleph]] ({{Hebrew|א}}) and [[he (letter)|he]] ({{Hebrew|ה}}).\n\nStandard spelling rules mandate only one way to spell every word with or without the Yod after tzere. Although in standard modern pronunciation the sound of tzere with or without the Yod is the same, it may change the word's meaning in a written text (see below).\n\n===Standard usage without Yod===\n''Tzere'' can be written by itself without mater lectionis, in which case it is called ''tzere ḥaser'' (\"lacking tzere\"), for example in the word {{Hebrew|זֵר}} ({{IPA|[zeɾ]}}, ''wreath''). In this case, in text without niqqud the vowel {{IPA|[e]}} is usually not written at all: זר. This word can be also vocalized as {{Hebrew|זָר}} ({{IPA|[zaɾ]}}, ''stranger'') and the reader has to guess the right pronunciation according to the context. According to the standardized Hebrew spelling the letter Yod is sometimes written in texts without niqqud, when there is a grammatical reason for it; for example, the verb {{Hebrew|תֵּעָדֵר}} ({{IPA|[teʕaˈdeɾ]}}, ''she will be absent'') is written without Yod in texts with niqqud, but the Yod is written in a text without niqqud: {{Hebrew|תיעדר}}.\n\n===Standard usage with Yod===\n''Tzere'' with Yod is called \"full tzere\". When a full tzere is written in text with niqqud, the letter Yod must be written in text without niqqud. The main cases for writing the tzere with Yod are these:\n\n* Tzere is written with Yod to indicate the plural number of declined words, for example {{Hebrew|מוּצָרֵנוּ}} means ''our product'' and {{Hebrew|מוּצָרֵינוּ}} means ''our product'''s'''''; the standard pronunciation is the same: {{IPA|[mutsaˈɾenu]}}.\n* Tzere is written with Yod in words in which the Yod is a part of the [[Semitic root|root]]:\n** Nouns, for example בֵּיצָה ({{IPA|[beˈtsa]}}, ''egg''), root ב־י־צ&lrm;; זֵיתִים ({{IPA|[zeˈtim]}}, ''olives'', the plural of זַיִת), root ז־י־ת&lrm;, מֵידָע ({{IPA|[meˈdaʕ]}}, ''information''), root י־ד־ע. Tzere is also traditionally written with Yod in several other words, the roots of which are rarely used productively to form other words, among them פְּסֵיפָס ({{IPA|[pəseˈfas]}}, ''mosaic''), קֵיסָם ({{IPA|[qeˈsam]}}, ''sliver'') and the word \"tzere\" itself – צֵירֵי ({{IPA|[tseˈɾe]}}).<ref name=\"academy-decisions-1-4\">Academy Decisions: Grammar, 2nd edition, §1.4.</ref>\n** Verbs, in which the last letter of the root is he (ל״ה), which is by convention treated as interchangeable with Yod,<ref>{{Cite GHG|75}}.</ref> for example נִבְנֵית ({{IPA|[nivˈnet]}}, ''being built f.''), root ב־נ־ה (or ב־נ־י). In Arabic the corresponding verbs are written with ʾalif maqṣūra, which represents a similar interchange of the letters [[yāʾ]] (ي) and [[ʾalif]] (ا).\n** Some verbs in which the first letter of the root is Yod (פ״י&lrm;),<ref>{{Cite GHG|70}}.</ref> for example הֵיטִיב ({{IPA|[heˈtiv]}}, ''he did well''), root י־ט־ב.\n* In standard spelling without niqqud Yod is written to represent the [e] sound in words formed in the pattern heCCeC (הֶקְטֵל), in which the first and the second consonants of the root merge, even though the vowel there is not tzere, but seggol, for example הֶשֵּׂג ({{IPA|[hesˈseɡ]}}, ''achievement''; root נ־שׂ־ג, without niqqud הישג).\n\n===Nonstandard usage of Yod to represent tzere===\nIn texts with full niqqud – mostly poetry, religious and children books – tzere is usually written in accordance with the rules mandated by the Academy. The Academy defined some cases in which a Yod is added to texts without niqqud to signify an {{IPA|[e]}} sound, but in common usage Yod is often written or not written contrary to the standard.\n\nSome notable common deviations from the standard in which a Yod is added include:\n* Some words are often written with Yod in texts without niqqud, even though the Yod is not a part  of the root and is not written in a text with niqqud. For example: מֵמַד ({{IPA|[meˈmad]}}, ''dimension''), מֵרַב ({{IPA|[meˈɾav]}}, ''[[Merab]]'', ''most''), שֵׂעָר ({{IPA|[seˈʕaɾ]}}, ''hair'') are often written מימד&lrm;, מירב and שיער, even though the standard spelling without niqqud is ממד&lrm;, מרב&lrm;, שער. This goes further as the Yod is retained  in declined forms of the  word, which aren't written with tzere at all, but with  shva; for example, the word שְׂעָרוֹת ({{IPA|[seʕaˈɾot]}}, ''hairs'') is frequently written שיערות, although the vowel of the ש is shva (the standard spelling is שערות).\n* Words in the pattern CəCeCa (קְטֵלָה) are often written with a Yod, even though it is not the standard. Examples include בְּרֵכָה ({{IPA|[bəɾeˈχa]}}, ''pool''), גְּנֵבָה ({{IPA|[ɡəneˈva]}}, ''theft''), שְׂרֵפָה ({{IPA|[səɾeˈfa]}}, ''burning''), which are often written בריכה&lrm;, גניבה&lrm;, שריפה instead of the standard ברכה&lrm;, גנבה&lrm;, שרפה.\n* Yod is often added in texts without niqqud to represent tzere in the future tense of verbs in which Yod is the first letter of the root, for example יֵשֵׁב ({{IPA|[yeˈʃev]}}, ''he will sit'') is often written יישב, although the standard spelling is ישב. This spelling may also be vocalized יָשַׁב ({{IPA|[yaˈʃav]}}, ''he sat''), but adding a Yod doesn't solve the ambiguity – יישב may be vocalized יְיַשֵׁב ({{IPA|[yeˈyaʃev]}}, ''he will settle'') and יִשֵׁב ({{IPA|[yiˈʃev]}}, ''he settled''). Because of the many potential ambiguities, the Academy suggests adding vocalization in such cases.\n* Several other (non-comprehensive) examples:\n** The standard spelling of the plural form of the word פְּרִי ({{IPA|[pəɾi]}}, ''fruit'') is פֵּרוֹת ({{IPA|[peɾot]}}) with niqqud and פרות without niqqud, but it is often written פירות&lrm; (פרות may also mean פָּרוֹת {{IPA|[paˈɾot]}} ''cows'').\n** The words אֵזוֹר ({{IPA|[eˈzoɾ]}}, ''zone''), הֵפֶךְ ({{IPA|[ˈhefeχ]}}, ''contrary''; also הֶפֶךְ&lrm;), תֵּכֶף ({{IPA|[ˈteχef]}}, ''immediately''; also תֶּכֶף) are sometimes spelled איזור&lrm;, היפך&lrm;, תיכף, although the standard spelling without niqqud is אזור&lrm;, הפך&lrm;, תכף. (In the ''[[Even-Shoshan Dictionary|Even-Shoshan]]'' dictionary תיכף refers to תֶּכֶף; in the ''Rav-Millim'' dictionary it is the main entry.)\n\nSome notable common deviations from the standard in which a Yod is not written include:\n* According to the modern spelling rules, the Academy mandates writing a Yod in some cases in which the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} changes to {{IPA|[e]}} for grammatical reasons. (Not writing the Yod is correct according to the old ''ktiv haser'' spelling.) For example:\n** In the future, imperative and infinitive forms of verbs in [[binyan]] ''nif'al'', the vowel of the prefix is usually {{IPA|[i]}}, which in standard spelling without niqqud is written with a Yod: לְהִזָּהֵר ({{IPA|[ləhizzaˈheɾ]}}, ''to be cautious''), standard spelling without niqqud: להיזהר. This vowel changes to {{IPA|[e]}} before the guttural letters א&lrm;, ה&lrm;, ח&lrm;, ע&lrm;, ר&lrm;: לְהֵרָדֵם ({{IPA|[ləheɾaˈdem]}}, ''to fall asleep''), standard spelling without niqqud: להירדם. Sometimes, however, verbs with both {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}} are written without a Yod in texts without niqqud: להזהר&lrm;, להרדם.\n** In nouns of the pattern CiCCuC, such as סִפּוּק ({{IPA|[sipˈpuq]}}, ''satisfaction'', without niqqud סיפוק) the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} also changes to {{IPA|[e]}} before guttural letters: פֵּרוּשׁ ({{IPA|[peˈɾuʃ]}}, ''commentary''), תֵּאוּר ({{IPA|[teˈʔuɾ]}}, ''description''), without niqqud: פירוש&lrm;, תיאור, but sometimes פרוש&lrm;, תאור.\n* The Yod is sometimes omitted from words, the last letter of whose root is ה&lrm;. This is a mistake, because in these verbs the Yod is written in texts with niqqud. For example: הוֹדֵיתִי ({{IPA|[hoˈdeti]}}, ''I thanked'', root י־ד־ה&lrm;), נֶהֱנֵינוּ ({{IPA|[neheˈnenu]}}, ''we enjoyed'', root ה־נ־ה) are sometimes incorrectly spelled הודתי&lrm;, נהננו.\n\n===Tzere with aleph and he===\nThe letter aleph (א) is the mater lectionis after tzere in the middle or the end of the word when it is a part of the root: מוֹצֵא ({{IPA|[moˈtse]}}, ''finding m.''), מוֹצֵאת ({{IPA|[moˈtset]}}, ''finding f.'').\n\nThe letter he (ה) is very rarely used as a mater lectionis for {{IPA|[e]}} in the middle of the word. The notable example for this is the word יְפֵהפִיָּה ({{IPA|[jəfefiˈja]}}, ''pretty''), in which the two last letters of the root (י־פ־ה) are [[reduplication|reduplicated]]. It can also be spelled יפה־פיה (fem.; so in the Bible, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|46:20||}}) or יפיפיה.\n\nThe letter he (ה) is often used as a mater lectionis for the vowel {{IPA|[e]}} in the end of the word, but the niqqud is usually segol. It is tzere in these cases:\n* In the [[construct state]] of nouns: absolute state שָׂדֶה ({{IPA|[saˈde]}}, ''field''), but construct state שְׂדֵה־ ({{IPA|[səde]}}).\n* In the imperative and absolute infinitive forms of the verb: future form יְגַלֶּה ({{IPA|[jəɡalˈle]}}, ''he will discover''), but גַּלֵּה ({{IPA|[ɡalˈle]}}, ''discover!''); future form תַּרְבֶּה ({{IPA|[taɾˈbe]}}, ''she shall increase, make many''), absolute infinitive הַרְבֵּה ({{IPA|[haɾˈbe]}}, ''many'').\n* In some words, among them אַיֵּה ({{IPA|[ajˈje]}}, ''where?''), אַרְיֵה ({{IPA|[aɾˈje]}}, ''lion''), הִנֵּה ({{IPA|[hinˈne]}}, ''here!''), יָשְׁפֵה ({{IPA|[jaʃəˈfe]}}, ''jasper''; also יָשְׁפֶה&lrm;), ־עֶשְׂרֵה ({{IPA|[ʕesˈre]}}, ''-teen f.'').<ref>A grammatical supplement to the Even-Shoshan Dictionary (2003 edition), §15.</ref>\n\n==Pronunciation==\nThe following table contains the [[pronunciation]] and [[transliteration]] of the different tzeres in reconstructed historical forms and [[dialect]]s using the [[help:IPA|International Phonetic Alphabet]].

In this case it has no diacritic, but could be marked with a sukun in some traditions. The preceding consonant could either have no diacritic or have {{Transl|ar|DIN|[[fatḥa]]}} sign, hinting to the first vowel {{IPA|/a/}} in the diphthong.\n\nAs a vowel, ''wāw'' can serve as the carrier of a [[hamza]]: {{lang|ar|ؤ}}.\n\n''Wāw'' serves several functions in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Perhaps foremost among them is that it is the primary [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] in Arabic, equivalent to \"and\"; it is usually [[prefix]]ed to other conjunctions, such as {{lang|ar|وَلَكِن}} ''wa-lākin'', meaning \"but\". Another function is the \"[[oath]]\", by preceding a noun of great significantly valued by the speaker. It is often literally translatable to \"By...\" or \"I swear to...\", and is often used in the [[Qur'an]] in this way, and also in the generally fixed construction {{lang|ar|والله}} ''wallāh'' (\"By [[Allah]]!\" or \"I swear to God!\").\n\n=== Derived letters ===\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|&#x6CB;}}\nWith an additional triple dot diacritic above ''waw'', the letter then named ''ve'' is used to represent distinctively the consonant {{IPAslink|v}} sometimes in Arabic-based [[Soranî|Sorani Kurdish]] and in [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet|Arabic-based]] [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].\n\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ۆ}}\n{{IPAslink|o}} in Sorani Kurdish; {{IPAslink|v}} in [[Kazakh alphabets#Arabic|Arabic-based]] [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]; {{IPAslink|ø}} in Uyghur.<br />\nThirty-fourth letter of the Azerbaijani Arabic script, represents Ô {{IPAslink|ɔ}}.<br />\nIt is also used for short vowel {{IPAslink|o}} or {{IPAslink|u}} in a lot of languages,{{specify|date=January 2015}} for example \"u\" in ''b<u>u</u>ll'' ({{lang|ar|بۆل}})\n\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ۉ}}\nfor {{IPAslink|oː}} or {{IPAslink|u}}, used in a lot of languages,{{specify|date=January 2015}} for example  <u>[[o]]</u> in ''b<u>o</u>ld'' ({{lang|ar|بۉلد}})\n\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ۈ}}\n{{IPAslink|y}} in Uyghur and also in other languages{{specify|date=January 2015}} with a similar vowel.\n\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ۊ}}\n{{IPAslink|ʉː}} in [[Southern Kurdish]].\n\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ۏ}}\nIn [[Jawi script]]:\nUsed for {{IPAslink|v}}.\n\n===Other letters===\nSee [[Arabic script in Unicode#Arabic|Arabic script in Unicode]]\n\n==Hebrew Waw==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=5|<small>[[Orthography|Orthographic]] variants</small>\n|-\n!colspan=3|<small>Various print fonts</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Cursive Hebrew|Cursive<br />Hebrew]]</small>\n!rowspan=2|<small>[[Rashi script|Rashi<br>script]]</small>\n|-\n!|<small>Serif</small> !!

It is pronounced {{IPAblink|o̞}} ([[phonemic transcription|phonemically transcribed]] more simply as {{IPA|/o/}}).\n\nThe distinction is normally ignored, and the HEBREW POINT HOLAM (U+05B9) is used in all cases.\n\nThe vowel can be denoted without the vav, as just the dot placed above and to the left of the letter it points, and it is then called ''[[holam haser|{{transl|he|ḥolam ḥaser}}]]''. Some inadequate typefaces do not support the distinction between the ''{{transl|he|ḥolam male}}'' ⟨{{Hebrew|ו&#x05B9;}}⟩ {{IPA|/o/}}, the consonantal vav pointed with a ''{{transl|he|ḥolam ḥaser}}'' ⟨{{Hebrew|ו&#x05BA;}}⟩ {{IPA|/vo/}} (compare ''{{transl|he|ḥolam male}}'' ⟨{{Hebrew|מַצּו&#x05B9;ת}}⟩ {{IPA|/maˈts'''o'''t/}} and consonantal vav-''{{transl|he|ḥolam ḥaser}}'' ⟨{{Hebrew|מִצְו&#x05BA;ת}}⟩ {{IPA|/mitsˈ'''vo'''t/}}). To display a consonantal vav with ''{{transl|he|ḥolam ḥaser}}'' correctly, the typeface must either support the vav with the Unicode combining character \"HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV\" (U+05BA, HTML Entity (decimal) &amp;#1466;)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/05ba/fontsupport.htm |title=List of fonts that support U+05BA at |publisher=Fileformat.info |date= |accessdate=2013-04-11}}</ref> or the precomposed character {{Hebrew|&#xFB4B;}} (U+FB4B). \n* Compare the three:\n*# The vav with the combining character HEBREW POINT HOLAM: {{Hebrew|מִצְו&#x05B9;ת}}\n*# The vav with the combining character HEBREW POINT HOLAM HASER FOR VAV: {{Hebrew|מִצְו&#x05BA;ת}}\n*# The precomposed character: {{Hebrew|מִצְ&#xFB4B;ת}}\n\n====Vav with a dot in the middle====\n{{Main|Shuruk}}\nVav can also be used as a ''mater lectionis'' for {{IPAblink|u}}, in which case it is known as a ''[[shuruk]]'', and in text with [[niqqud]] is marked with a dot in the middle (on the left side).\n\n[[Shuruk]] and vav with a [[dagesh]] look identical (\"{{Hebrew|וּ}}\") and are only distinguishable through the fact that in text with niqqud, vav with a [[dagesh]] will normally be attributed a vocal point in addition, e.g. {{Hebrew|שׁוּק}} ({{IPA|/ʃuk/}}), \"a market\", (the \"{{Hebrew|וּ}}\" denotes a [[shuruk]]) as opposed to {{Hebrew|שִׁוֵּק}} ({{IPA|/ʃiˈvek/}}), \"to market\" (the \"{{Hebrew|וּ}}\" denotes a vav with [[dagesh]] and is additionally pointed with a [[zeire]], \"&nbsp;<span style=\"unicode-bidi:bidi-override\">{{Hebrew|ֵ}}</span>&nbsp;\", denoting {{IPA|/e/}}). In the word {{Hebrew|שִׁוּוּק}} ({{IPA|/ʃiˈvuk/}}), \"marketing\", the first (\"{{Hebrew|וּ}}\") denotes a vav with dagesh, the second a shuruk, being the vowel attributed to the first.\n\n===Numerical value===\nVav in [[gematria]] represents the number six, and when used at the beginning of [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew years]], it means 6000 (i.e. {{lang|he|ותשנד}} in [[Arabic numerals|numbers]] would be the [[Calendar date|date]] 6754.)\n\n===Words written as vav===\n{{main|Hebrew grammar}}\n\nVav at the beginning of the word has several possible meanings:\n* ''[[waw-conjunctive|vav conjunctive]]'' (Vav Hachibur, literally \"the Vav of Connection\"—chibur means \"joining, or bringing together\") is a vav connecting two words or parts of a sentence; it is a [[grammatical conjunction]] meaning '' 'and' '', cognate to the Arabic. This is the most common usage.\n* ''[[waw-consecutive|vav consecutive]]'' (Vav Hahipuch, literally \"the Vav of Reversal\"—hipuch means \"inversion\"), mainly biblical, commonly mistaken for the previous type of vav; it indicates consequence of actions and reverses the tense of the verb following it:\n**when placed in front of a verb in the imperfect tense, it changes the verb to the perfect tense. For example, ''yomar'' means 'he will say' and ''vayomar'' means 'he said';\n**when placed in front of a verb in the perfect, it changes the verb to the imperfect tense. For example, ''ahavtah'' means 'you loved', and ''ve'ahavtah'' means 'you will love'.\n(Note: Older Hebrew did not have \"tense\" in a temporal sense, \"perfect,\" and \"imperfect\" instead denoting aspect of completed or continuing action. Modern Hebrew verbal tenses have developed closer to their Indo-European counterparts, mostly having a temporal quality rather than denoting aspect. As a rule, Modern Hebrew does not use the \"Vav Consecutive\" form.)\n* ''[[waw-explicative|vav explicative]]''\n\n===Yiddish===\n\nIn [[Yiddish]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinreich|first=Uriel|date=1992|title=College Yiddish|location=New York|publisher=[[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research|pages=27–8|author-link=Uriel Weinreich}}</ref> the letter (known as '''vov''') is used for several orthographic purposes in native words:\n* Alone, a single vov {{script/Hebrew|ו}} represents the vowel {{IPAblink|u}} in standard Yiddish.\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] {{script/Hebrew|וו}}, \"''tsvey vovn''\" ('two vovs'), represents the consonant {{IPAblink|v}}.\n* The digraph {{script/Hebrew|וי}}, consisting of a vov followed by a [[yodh|yud]], represents the diphthong [{{IPA|oj}}].\nThe single vov may be written with a dot on the left when necessary to avoid ambiguity and distinguish it from other functions of the letter. For example, the word ''vu'' 'where' is spelled {{script/Hebrew|וווּ}}, as ''tsvey vovn'' followed by a single vov; the single vov indicating {{IPAblink|u}} is marked with a dot in order to distinguish which of the three vovs represents the vowel.

Its sound value is {{IPAslink|j}} in all languages for which it is used; in many languages, it also serves as a [[vowel length|long vowel]], representing {{IPAslink|i|iː}}.\n\nThe Phoenician letter gave rise to the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] [[Iota]] (Ι),<ref>Victor Parker, ''A History of Greece, 1300 to 30 BC'', (John Wiley & Sons, 2014), 67.</ref> [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] [[I]], [[J]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] [[Dotted I (Cyrillic)|І]], [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] iauda (Ⲓ) and [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]] [[isaz|eis]] [[File:Gothic_letter_eis.svg|4px]].\n\n==Origins==\nYodh is originated from a pictograph of a “hand” that ultimately derives from [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] [[:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Semitic/yad-|*yad-]]. It may be related to the Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyph]] of an “arm” or “hand” <hiero> D36 </hiero>\n\n==Arabic yāʼ==\n{{Infobox grapheme\n|name=Yāʾ\n|letter=ي\n|variations=\n|image=\n|imagesize=200\n|imagealt=\n|script=[[Arabic script]]\n|type=[[Abjad]]\n|typedesc=\n|language=[[Arabic language]]\n|phonemes={{IPAblink|j}}, {{IPAblink|iː}}\n|unicode=\n|alphanumber=4\n|number=\n|usageperiod=\n|children=\n|equivalents=\n|associates=\n|direction=Right-to-left\n}}\nThe letter {{lang|ar|ي}} is named ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʼ}}'' ({{lang|ar|يَاء}}). It is written in several ways depending on its position in the word:\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ي}}\n\nIt is pronounced in four ways:\n* As a consonant, it is pronounced as a [[palatal approximant]] '''{{IPA|/j/}}''', typically at the beginnings of words in front of short or long vowels.\n*A [[vowel length|long]] <!--The value may change across North Africa and West Asia--> '''{{IPA|/iː/}}''' usually in the middle or end of words. In this case it has no diacritic, but could be marked with a [[Kasrah|kasra]] in the preceding letter in some traditions.\n*A [[vowel length|long]] '''{{IPA|/eː/}}''' In many [[varieties of Arabic|dialects]], as a result of the [[monophthong]]ization that underwent the diphthong {{IPA|/aj/}} in most of the words. \n* A part of a [[diphthong]], '''{{IPA|/aj/}}'''. Then, it has no diacritic but could be marked with a sukun in some traditions. The preceding consonant could have no diacritic or have {{transl|ar|DIN|[[Fatha|fatḥa]]}} sign, hinting to the first vowel in the diphthong, i.e. {{IPA|/a/}}.\n\nAs a vowel, yāʾ can serve as the \"seat\" of the [[hamza]]: {{lang|ar|ئ}}\n\nYāʾ serves several functions in the Arabic language. Yāʾ as a prefix is the marker for a singular [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb, as in {{lang|ar|يَكْتُب}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|yaktub}}'' \"he writes\" from the root {{lang|ar|ك-ت-ب}} K-T-B (\"write, writing\"). Yāʾ with a [[shadda]] is particularly used to turn a noun into an adjective, called a ''nisbah'' ({{lang|ar|نِسْبَة}}). For instance, {{lang|ar|مِصْر}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Miṣr}}'' ([[Egypt]]) → {{lang|ar|مِصْرِيّ}} ''Miṣriyy'' (Egyptian). The transformation can be more abstract; for instance, {{lang|ar|مَوْضَوع}} ''mawḍūʿ'' (matter, object) → {{lang|ar|مَوْضُوعِيّ}} ''mawḍūʿiyy'' ([[wikt:objectivity|objective]]). Still other uses of this function can be a bit further from the root: {{lang|ar|إِشْتِرَاك}} ''ishtirāk'' (cooperation) → {{lang|ar|إِشْتِرَاكِيّ}} ''ishtirākiyy'' ([[socialism|socialist]]). The common pronunciation of the final {{IPA|/-ijj/}} is most often pronounced as {{IPA-ar|i|}} or {{IPA-ar|iː|}}.\n\nA form similar to but distinguished from yāʾ is the ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif maqṣūrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|أَلِف مَقْصُورَة}}) \"limited/restricted [[aleph|alif]]\", with the form {{lang|ar|ى}}. It indicates a final long <!--Across North Africa & West Asia it has different values [e, ɛ, æ, a, ä]--> {{IPA|/aː/}}.\n\nIn Egypt, Sudan and sometimes the [[Maghreb]], the final form is always {{lang|ar|ى}} (without dots), both in handwriting and in print, representing both final {{IPA|/-iː/}} and {{IPA|/-aː/}}. {{lang|ar|ى}} representing final {{IPA|/-aː/}} ([[DIN 31635]] transliteration: {{transl|ar|DIN|ā}}) is less likely to occur in Modern Standard Arabic. In this case, it is commonly known as, especially in Egypt, {{lang|ar|أَلِف لَيِّنَة}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʾalif layyinah}}'' {{IPA-arz|ˈʔælef læjˈjenæ|}}. In Egypt, it is always short {{IPA|[-æ, -ɑ]}} if used in [[Egyptian Arabic]] and most commonly short in Modern Standard Arabic, as well.\n\n=== Alif maqṣūrah ===\n{{Anchor|alifmaqsura}}The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' ({{lang|ar|ألف مقصورة}}, 'limited/restricted alif'), commonly known in Egypt as ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif layyinah}}'' ({{lang|ar|ألف لينة}}, 'flexible alif'), looks like a dotless [[Ya'|{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}]] <big>{{lang|ar|ى}}</big> (final <big>{{lang|ar|ـى}}</big>) and may appear only at the end of a word. Although it looks different from a regular ''alif'', it represents the same sound {{IPA|/aː/}}, often realized as a short vowel. When it is written, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif maqṣūrah}}'' is indistinguishable from final [[Persian alphabet|Persian]] ''[[Yodh#Perso-Arabic ye|ye]]'' or Arabic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' as it is written in Egypt, Sudan and sometimes elsewhere. The letter is transliterated as {{transl|ar|ALA|y}} in [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]. ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Alif maqsurah}}'' is transliterated as {{transl|ar|ALA|á}} in [[ALA-LC Romanization|ALA-LC]], {{transl|ar|DIN|ā}} in [[DIN 31635]], {{transl|ar|ISO|à}} in ISO 233-2, and {{transl|ar|ISO|ỳ}} in [[ISO 233]].\n\n''In Arabic, Alif maqsurah'' {{lang|ar|ى}} is not used initially or medially, and it is not joinable initially or medially in all fonts. However, the letter is used initially and medially in the [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]] and the Arabic-based [[Kyrgyz alphabet]]: (<big>{{script/Arabic|ىـ ـىـ}}</big>).{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ى}}\n\n===Perso-Arabic ye===\n<!-- [[ی]] redirects here -->\n{{Arabic script sidebar|Pashto|nav=no}}\n{{Arabic script sidebar|Persian|nav=no}}\nIn the [[Persian alphabet]], the letter is generally called ''ye'' following [[Persian language|Persian-language]] custom. In its final form, the letter does not have dots ({{lang|fa|ی}}), much like the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|DIN|[[Aleph#Alif maqṣūrah: ى|Alif maqṣūrah]]}}'' or, more to the point, much like the custom in Egypt, Sudan and sometimes Maghreb. On account of this difference, Perso-Arabic ''ye'' is located at a different [[Unicode]] [[code point]] than both of the standard Arabic letters. In computers, the Persian version of the letter automatically appears with two dots initially and medially: (<big>{{lang|fa|یـ ـیـ ـی}}</big>).\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ی}}\n\nIn [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], it uses a ring instead from ي of a dots below (<big>{{script/Arabic|ؠ ؠـ ـؠـ ـؠ}}</big>).\n{{Arabic alphabet shapes|ؠ}}\n\n=== Returned yāʾ ===\nIn different calligraphic styles like the [[Hijazi script]], [[Kufic]], and [[Nastaʿlīq script]], a final ''yāʾ'' might have a particular shape with the descender turned to the right ({{Nastaliq|ـے}}), called ''al-yāʾ al-mardūdah/al-rājiʿah'' (\"returned, recurred ''yāʾ''\"),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gacek|first1=Adam|title=The Arabic manuscript tradition: a glossary of technical terms and bibliography: supplement|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004165401|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfZYCcOL8dYC&pg=PA29}}</ref> either with two dots or without them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Yūsofī|first1=Ḡolām-Ḥosayn|title=Encyclopædia Iranica|date=1990|volume=IV|pages=680–704|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/calligraphy|chapter=Calligraphy}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] this is called ''[[baṛī ye]]'' (\"big ye\"), but is an independent letter used for /ɛː, eː/ and differs from the basic ye (''choṭī ye'', \"little ye\"). For this reason the letter has its own [[code point]] in Unicode.

As a [[mater lectionis]], it represents the vowel {{IPAblink|i}}. At the end of words with a vowel or when marked with a [[Shva#Shva Na.E1.B8.A5|sh'va nach]], it represents the formation of a [[diphthong]], such as {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/ai/}}, or {{IPA|/oi/}}.\n\n===Significance===\nIn [[gematria]], Yud represents the number ten.\n\nAs a [[Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]], it designates the third person singular (or plural, with a [[Waw (letter)|Vav]] as a [[suffix]]) in the future tense.\n\nAs a [[suffix]], it indicates first person singular possessive; ''av'' (father) becomes ''avi'' (my father).\n\n\"Yod\" in the Hebrew language signifies [[iodine]]. Iodine is also called يود ''yod'' in Arabic.\n\n====In religion====\nTwo Yuds in a row designate the name of God [[Names of God in Judaism#Adonai|Adonai]] and in pointed texts are written with the vowels of Adonai; this is done as well with the [[Tetragrammaton]].\n\nAs Yud is the smallest letter, much [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] and mystical significance is attached to it. According to the [[Gospel of Matthew]], [[Jesus]] mentioned it during the [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|Antithesis of the Law]], when he says: \"One jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.\" Jot, or iota, refers to the letter Yud; it was often overlooked by scribes because of its size and position as a [[mater lectionis]]. In modern Hebrew, the phrase \"tip of the Yud\" refers to a small and insignificant thing, and someone who \"worries about the tip of a Yud\" is someone who is picky and meticulous about small details.\n\nMuch [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] and mystical significance is also attached to it because of its gematria value as ten, which is an important number in Judaism, and its place in the name of God.<ref>[http://www.inner.org/hebleter/yud.htm Inner.org]</ref>\n\n===Yiddish===\n\nIn [[Yiddish]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinreich|first=Uriel|date=1992|title=College Yiddish|location=New York|publisher=[[YIVO]] Institute for Jewish Research|pages=27–8|author-link=Uriel Weinreich}}</ref> the letter yud is used for several orthographic purposes in native words:\n* Alone, a single yud י may represent the vowel {{IPAblink|i}} or the consonant {{IPAblink|j}}. When adjacent to another vowel, or another yud, {{IPAblink|i}} may be distinguished from {{IPAblink|j}} by the addition of a dot below. Thus the word ''Yidish'' 'Yiddish' is spelled ייִדיש. The first yud represents [{{IPA|j}}]; the second yud represents [{{IPA|i}}] and is distinguished from the adjacent [{{IPA|j}}] by a dot; the third yud represents [{{IPA|i}}] as well, but no dot is necessary.\n* The [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]] יי, consisting of two yuds, represents the diphthong [{{IPA|ej}}].\n* A pair of yuds with a horizontal line (''[[patach|pasekh]]'') under them, ײַ, represents the diphthong [{{IPA|aj}}] in standard Yiddish.\n* The digraph consisting of a [[Waw (letter)|vov]] followed by a yud, וי, represents the diphthong [{{IPA|oj}}].\n\n[[Loanword]]s from Hebrew or Aramaic in Yiddish are spelled as they are in their language of origin.\n\n==Character encodings==\n{{charmap\n|05D9|name1=Hebrew Letter Yod\n|064A|name2=Arabic Letter Yeh\n|06CC|name3=Persian Letter Ye\n|071D|name4=Syriac Letter Yudh\n|0809|name5=Samaritan Letter Yut\n}}\n\n{{charmap\n|1038A|name1=Ugaritic Letter Yod\n|10849|name2=Imperial Aramaic Letter Yodh\n|10909|name3=Phoenician Letter Yod\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-dropping]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|י}}\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n{{Arabic language}}\n{{Northwest Semitic abjad}}\n\n[[Category:Phoenician alphabet]]\n[[Category:Hebrew alphabet]]\n[[Category:Vowel letters]]\n[[Category:Graphemes]]"

Since the vowels can be understood from surrounding, context can help readers read the correct pronunciations of several letters of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (the [[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]] sign and other rare glyphs are also listed as part of the niqqud system but are not in common use){{ref label|rafe|*|}};\n* ''[[geresh]]'' and ''[[gershayim]],'' two diacritics that are not considered a part of niqqud, each of which has several functions (e.g. to denote [[Hebrew numerals]]);\n* and ''[[cantillation]],'' \"accents\" which are used exclusively to indicate how Biblical passages should be chanted and may possess a punctuating function.\n\nSeveral diacritical systems were developed in the Early Middle Ages. The most widespread system, and the only one still used to a significant degree today, was created by the [[Masoretes]] of [[Tiberias]] in the second half of the first millennium in the [[Land of Israel]] (see [[Masoretic Text]], [[Tiberian Hebrew]]).\nThe Niqqud signs and cantillation marks developed by the Masoretes are small compared to consonants, so they could be added to the consonantal texts without retranscribing them.\n\n==Pointing ''(niqqud)''==\n{{main article|niqqud}}\nIn modern Israeli orthography, vowel and consonant pointing is seldom used, except in specialised texts such as dictionaries, poetry, or texts for children or for new immigrants. Israeli Hebrew has five vowel phonemes—{{IPAslink|i}}, {{IPAslink|e̞|e}}, {{IPAslink|ä|a}}, {{IPAslink|o̞|o}} and {{IPAslink|u}}—but many more written symbols for them.  ''Niqqud'' distinguish the following vowels and consonants; for more detail, see the main article.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! rowspan=2 | Name\n!! rowspan=2 | Symbol\n!! rowspan=2 | [[Unicode]]\n!!

This assertion was hotly contested by Swiss theologian [[Johannes Buxtorf II]] in 1648. [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Brian Walton]]'s 1657 polyglot bible followed Cappel in revising the vowel points. In 1675, the 2nd and 3rd canons of the so-called [[Helvetic Consensus]] of the [[Swiss Reformed Church]] confirmed Buxtorf's view as orthodox and affirmed that the vowel points were inspired.{{Cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arabic diacritics]]\n* [[Q're perpetuum]]\n* [[Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[Hebrew spelling]]\n\n==Notes==\n:'''*'''{{note|rafe}} The [[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]] sign ({{Hebrew|רפה}}, {{Hebrew|&nbsp;&#1471;&nbsp;}} ) which is used to mark fricative consonants in the [[YIVO]] orthography of [[Yiddish]]; is no longer used in modern printed Hebrew.

It was also frequently used in place of a final ''e'' (which was still pronounced at the time) when it was elided before a vowel, as in ''un' heure''. Modern French [[orthography]] has restored the spelling ''une heure''.<ref>Alfred Ewert, ''The French Language'', 1933, Faber & Faber, London, p 119</ref>\n\n====Early English practice====\nFrom the 16th century, following French practice, the apostrophe was used when a vowel letter was omitted either because of incidental [[elision]] (''I'm'' for ''I am'') or because the letter no longer represented a sound (''lov'd'' for ''loved''). English spelling retained many [[inflection]]s that were not pronounced as [[syllables]], notably verb endings (''-est, -eth, -es, -ed'') and the noun ending ''-es'', which marked either plurals or possessives (also known as [[Genitive case|genitives]]; see [[#Possessive apostrophe|Possessive apostrophe]], below). So apostrophe followed by ''s'' was often used to mark a plural, especially when the noun was a [[loan word]] (and especially a word ending in ''a'', as in ''the two comma's'').<ref name=Crystal/>\n\n====Standardisation====\nThe use of [[elision]] has continued to the present day, but significant changes have been made to the [[possessive case|possessive]] and [[plural]] uses. By the 18th century, apostrophe + ''s'' was regularly used for all [[possessive case|possessive]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] forms, even when the letter ''e'' was not omitted (as in ''the gate's height''). This was regarded as representing the [[Old English]] [[genitive]] singular [[inflection]] ''-es''. The [[plural]] use was greatly reduced, but a need was felt to mark [[possessive case|possessive]] [[plural]]. The solution was to use an apostrophe after the [[plural]] ''s'' (as in ''girls' dresses''). However, this was not universally accepted until the mid-19th century.<ref name=Crystal/>\n\n===Possessive apostrophe===\n{{See also|English possessive}}\n\nThe apostrophe is used in English to indicate what is, for historical reasons, misleadingly called the [[possessive]] case in the English language. This case was called the [[Genitive case|genitive]] until the 18th century and (like the genitive case in other languages) does not always involve [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. For example, in the phrase \"little Roger's headmaster\", little Roger does not own the headmaster; in the phrase \"tomorrow's weather\", tomorrow does not/will not own the weather.\n\nIn the words of [[Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]:<ref>{{cite book |page=475 |title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |year=1994 |publisher=Merriam-Webster |isbn=978-0-87779-132-4 }}</ref>\n{{quote|The argument is a case of fooling oneself with one's own terminology.

Until the 18th century, the apostrophe was extensively used to indicate (subjective, \"normal\") plural, and its use for indicating plural \"possessive\" use was not standard before the middle of the 19th century.\n\n====General principles for the possessive apostrophe====\n; Summary of rules for most situations{{anchor|Summary of rules for most situations}}\n\n* Possessive personal pronouns, serving as either noun-equivalents or adjective-equivalents, do not use an apostrophe, even when they end in ''s''. The complete list of those ending in the letter ''s'' or the corresponding sound {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}} but not taking an apostrophe is ''ours, yours, his, hers, its, theirs'', and ''whose''.\n* Other pronouns, singular nouns not ending in ''s'', and plural nouns not ending in ''s'' all take ''<nowiki />'s'' in the possessive: e.g., ''someone's'', ''a cat's toys'', ''women's''.\n* Plural nouns already ending in ''s'' take only an apostrophe after the pre-existing ''s'' when the possessive is formed: e.g., ''three cats' toys''.\n\n; Basic rule (singular nouns){{anchor|Basic rule (singular nouns)}}\n\nFor most singular nouns the ending ''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s'' is added; e.g., ''the cat's whiskers''.\n*If a singular noun ends with an ''s''-sound (spelled with ''-s'', ''-se'', for example), practice varies as to whether to add ''{{'s}}'' or the apostrophe alone. A widely accepted practice is to follow whichever spoken form is judged better: ''the boss's shoes'', ''Mrs Jones' hat'' (or ''Mrs Jones's hat'', if that spoken form is preferred). In many cases, both spoken and written forms differ between writers. (See details [[#Singular nouns ending with an \"s\" or \"z\" sound|below]].)\n* Acronyms and initialisms used as nouns (CD, DVD, NATO, RADAR, etc.) follow the same rules as singular nouns: e.g., \"''the TV's picture quality''\".\n{{anchor|Plural possessive}}\n; Basic rule (plural nouns){{anchor|Basic rule (plural nouns)}}\nWhen the noun is a normal plural, with an added ''s'', no extra ''s'' is added in the possessive; so ''the neighbours' garden'' (where there is more than one neighbour) is standard rather than ''the neighbours's garden''.\n* If the plural is not one that is formed by adding ''s'', an ''s'' is added for the possessive, ''after'' the apostrophe: ''children's hats'', ''women's hairdresser'', ''some people's eyes'' (but compare ''some peoples' recent emergence into nationhood'', where ''peoples'' is meant as the plural of the singular ''people''). These principles are universally accepted.\n* A few English nouns have plurals that are not spelled with a final ''s'' but nevertheless end in an /s/ or a /z/ sound: ''mice'' (plural of ''mouse''; also in compounds like ''[[dormouse]]'', ''[[titmouse]]''), ''[[dice]]'' (when used as the plural of ''die''), ''pence'' (a plural of ''penny'', with compounds like ''sixpence'' that now tend to be taken as singulars). In the absence of specific exceptional treatment in style guides, the possessives of these plurals are formed by adding an apostrophe and an ''s'' in the standard way: ''seven [[titmice]]'s tails were found'', ''the dice's last fall was a seven'', ''his few pence's value was not enough to buy bread''. These would often be rephrased, where possible: ''the last fall of the dice was a seven''.{{NoteTag|''Pease'' as an old plural of ''pea'' is indeterminate: ''Lentils' and pease'[s] use in such dishes was optional''. Nouns borrowed from French ending in ''-eau'', ''-eu'', ''-au'', or ''-ou'' sometimes have alternative plurals that retain the French ''-x'': ''beaux'' or ''beaus''; ''bureaux'' or ''bureaus''; ''adieux'' or ''adieus''; ''fabliaux'' or ''fabliaus''; ''choux'' or ''chous''. The ''x'' in these plurals is often pronounced. If it is, then (in the absence of specific rulings from style guides) the plural possessives are formed with an apostrophe alone: ''the beaux' [or beaus'] appearance at the ball''; ''the bureaux' [or bureaus'] responses differed''. If the ''x'' is not pronounced, then in the absence of special rulings the plurals are formed with an apostrophe followed by an ''s'': ''the beaux's appearance''; ''the bureaux's responses''; ''their adieux's effect was that everyone wept''. See also [[#Nouns ending with silent \"s\", \"x\", or \"z\"|Nouns ending with silent \"s\", \"x\" or \"z\"]], below, and attached notes.}}\n\n; Basic rule (compound nouns){{anchor|Basic rule (compound nouns)}}\nCompound nouns have their singular possessives formed with an apostrophe and an added ''s'', in accordance with the rules given above: ''the Attorney-General's husband''; ''the [[Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports]]'s prerogative''; ''this Minister for Justice's intervention''; ''her father-in-law's new wife''.\n*In such examples, the plurals are formed with an ''s'' that does not occur at the end: e.g., ''attorneys-general''. A problem therefore arises with the ''possessive'' plurals of these compounds. Sources that rule on the matter appear to favour the following forms, in which there is both an ''s'' added to form the plural, and a separate ''s'' added for the possessive: ''the attorneys-general's husbands''; ''successive Ministers for Justice's interventions''; ''their fathers-in-law's new wives''.<ref>''Style Guide'', [https://web.archive.org/web/20080313021406/http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/bjssg.pdf US Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics]; [http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-8.html ''The United States Government Printing Office Style Manual 2000''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627092149/http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-8.html |date=27 June 2006 }}; ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' (CMOS), 5.25: \"The possessive of a multiword compound noun is formed by adding the appropriate ending to the last word {parents-in-law's message}.\"</ref> Because these constructions stretch the resources of punctuation beyond comfort, in practice they are normally reworded: ''interventions by successive Ministers for Justice''.<ref>CMOS, 7.25: \"If plural compounds pose problems, opt for ''of''. ...

There is often a policy of leaving off the additional ''s'' on any such name, but this can prove problematic when specific names are contradictory (for example, ''[[St James' Park]]'' in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] [the football ground] and the area of ''[[St. James's Park]]'' in London). Having said that, there has been ongoing debate around the punctuation of St James' Park (Newcastle) for some time, contrary to St James's Park (London) which is the less contentious version. For more details on practice with geographic names, see the relevant section [[apostrophe#Possessives in geographic names|below]].\n\nSome writers like to reflect standard spoken practice in cases like these with ''sake'': ''for convenience' sake'', ''for goodness' sake'', ''for appearance' sake'', ''for compromise' sake'', etc. This punctuation is preferred in major style guides.

Certainly a sibilant is pronounced in examples like ''Descartes's'' and ''Dumas's''; the question addressed here is whether ''s'' needs to be added. Similar examples with ''x'' or ''z'': ''Sauce Périgueux's main ingredient is truffle''; ''His [[pince-nez]]'s loss went unnoticed''; ''\"Verreaux('s) eagle, a large, predominantly black eagle, ''Aquila verreauxi'',...\"'' ([[OED]], entry for \"Verreaux\", with silent ''x''; see [[Verreaux's eagle]]); in each of these some writers might omit the added ''s''. The same principles and residual uncertainties apply with \"naturalised\" English words, like ''Illinois'' and ''Arkansas''.<ref>In February 2007 Arkansas historian Parker Westbrook successfully petitioned State Representative Steve Harrelson to settle once and for all that the correct possessive should not be ''Arkansas<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' but ''Arkansas's'' ([http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2007/02/27/arkansas_house_to_argue_over_apostrophes/ ''Arkansas House to argue over apostrophes'']). Arkansas's Apostrophe Act came into law in March 2007 (ABC News [USA], 6 March 2007).</ref>\n\nFor possessive ''plurals'' of words ending in silent ''x'', ''z'' or ''s'', the few authorities that address the issue at all typically call for an added ''s'' and suggest that the apostrophe precede the ''s'': ''The Loucheux's homeland is in the Yukon''; ''Compare the two Dumas's literary achievements''.{{NoteTag|1= An apparent exception is ''The Complete Stylist'', Sheridan Baker, 2nd edition 1972, p.&nbsp;165: \"''... citizens' rights'', ''the Joneses' possessions'', and similarly ''The Beaux' Stratagem''.\" But in fact the ''x'' in ''beaux'', as in other such plurals in English, is often already pronounced (see a note to [[#Basic rule (plural nouns)|Basic rule (plural nouns)]], above); ''[[The Beaux Stratagem]]'', the title of a play by George Farquhar (1707), originally lacked the apostrophe (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=6AgJAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover the title page] of a 1752 edition); and it is complicated by the following ''s'' in ''stratagem''.

Usage is variable and inconsistent. Style guides typically advise consulting an official source for the standard form of the name (as one would do if uncertain about other aspects of the spelling of the name); some tend towards greater prescriptiveness, for or against such an apostrophe.{{NoteTag|''Gregg Reference Manual'', 10th edition, 2003, distinguishes between what it calls ''possessive'' and ''descriptive'' forms, and uses this distinction in analyzing the problem. From paragraph&nbsp;628: \"a.&nbsp;Do not mistake a descriptive form ending in ''s'' for a possessive form[:] sales effort (sales describes the kind of effort)... b.&nbsp;Some cases can be difficult to distinguish. Is it ''the girls basketball team'' or ''the girls' basketball team?'' Try substituting an irregular plural like ''women''. You would not say ''the women basketball team''; you would say ''the women's basketball team''. By analogy, ''the girls' basketball team'' is correct\" [italics given exactly as in original, including following punctuation]. (However in this case the phrase in question is not part of the name: the words are not capitalised!) And then this principle is applied to organizations at paragraph&nbsp;640, where examples are given, including the non-conforming ''Childrens Hospital, (in Los Angeles)'': \"The names of many organizations, products, and publications contain words that could be considered either possessive or descriptive terms... c. In all cases follow the organization's preference when known.\"}} As the case of ''{{sic|wom|ens|hide=yes}}'' shows, it is not possible to analyze these forms simply as non-possessive plurals, since ''women'' is the only correct plural form of ''woman''.\n\n====Possessives in business names====\n[[File:Green Craig's.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign to Green [[Crag and tail|Craigs]] housing development]]\n{{See also|S-form}}\n\nWhere a business name is based on a family name it should in theory take an apostrophe, but many leave it out (contrast ''[[Sainsbury's]]'' with ''[[Harrods]]''). In recent times there has been an increasing tendency to drop the apostrophe. Names based on a first name are more likely to take an apostrophe, but this is not always the case. Some business names may inadvertently spell a different name if the name with an ''s'' at the end is also a name, such as Parson.\nA small activist group called the [[Apostrophe Protection Society]]<ref>[http://www.apostrophe.org.uk/ Apostrophe Protection Society's website]. Apostrophe.org.uk (12 February 2013). Retrieved on 7 April 2013.</ref> has campaigned for large retailers such as Harrods, [[Currys]], and [[Selfridges]] to reinstate their missing punctuation.

Times Online (21 August 2006).</ref> Further confusion can be caused by businesses whose names look as if they should be pronounced differently without an apostrophe, such as Paulos Circus, and other companies that leave the apostrophe out of their logos but include it in written text, such as [[Cadwalader's]].\n\n===Apostrophe showing omission===\nAn apostrophe is commonly used to indicate omitted characters, normally letters:\n* It is used in [[contraction (grammar)|contractions]], such as ''can't'' from ''cannot'', ''it's'' from ''it is'' or ''it has'', and ''I'll'' from ''I will'' or ''I shall''.<ref>In reports of very informal speech ''<nowiki />'s'' may sometimes represent ''does'': \"Where's that come from?\"</ref>\n* It is used in [[abbreviation]]s, as ''gov't'' for ''government''. It may indicate omitted numbers where the spoken form is also capable of omissions, as ''<nowiki />'70s'' for ''1970s'' representing ''seventies'' for ''nineteen-seventies''. In modern usage, apostrophes are generally omitted when letters are removed from the start of a word, particularly for a [[compound word]]. For example, it is not common to write ''<nowiki />'bus'' (for ''omnibus''), ''<nowiki />'phone'' (''telephone''), ''<nowiki />'net'' (''Internet''). However, if the shortening is unusual, dialectal or archaic, the apostrophe may still be used to mark it (e.g., ''<nowiki />'bout'' for ''about'', ''<nowiki />'less'' for ''unless'', ''<nowiki />'twas'' for ''it was''). Sometimes a misunderstanding of the original form of a word results in a non-standard contraction. A common example: ''<nowiki />'til'' for ''until'', though ''till'' is in fact the original form, and ''until'' is derived from it.\n**The spelling ''fo'c's'le'', contracted from the nautical term ''forecastle'', is unusual for having three apostrophes. The spelling ''bo's'n's'' (from ''boatswain's''), as in ''Bo's'n's Mate'', also has three apostrophes, two showing omission and one possession. ''Fo'c's'le'' may also take a possessive ''s''&nbsp;– as in ''the fo'c's'le's timbers''&nbsp;– giving four apostrophes in one word.<ref>[[SOED]] gives ''fo'c's'le'' as the only shortened form of ''forecastle'', though others are shown in [[OED]]. SOED gives ''bo's'n'' as one spelling of ''bosun'', itself a variant of ''boatswain''.</ref>  A word which formerly contained two apostrophes is ''sha'n't '' for ''shall not'', examples of which may be found in the older works of [[P G Wodehouse]] and \"Frank Richards\" ([[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Charles Hamilton]]), but this has been superseded by ''shan't''.\n**Shortenings with more apostrophes, such as ''y'all'dn't've'' ([[y'all]] wouldn't have), are possible, particularly in [[Southern American English|Southern US dialects]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Can You Have Multiple Contractions in the Same Word?

(''We rehearsed for the opening night on Friday.'')\n**We rehearsed because Friday's opening night. (''We rehearsed because Friday is opening night.'' \"Friday's\" here is a contraction of \"Friday is.\")\n*[[Eye dialect]]s use apostrophes in creating the effect of a non-standard pronunciation.\n*Apostrophes to omit letters in place names are common on British road signs when space does not allow for the full name (e.g. [[Wolverhampton]] abbreviated as \"W'hampton\" and [[Kidderminster]] as \"K'minster\", as shown on [https://www.google.com/maps/@52.5285894,-2.3816704,3a,75y,283.86h,85.53t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1stlcDS82yOTOXHKVwGQdc6g!2e0 this sign]).\n\n===Use in forming some plurals===\n[[File:Oakland_A's_logo.svg|thumb|right|upright|The apostrophe can be used in plural abbreviations<br />as in the team logo of the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]].]]\n\nThe apostrophe may be used for clarity with the plurals of single letters as in\n:\"minding your p's and q's\"\n:\"A's and S's\"<ref name=\"Hart apostrophe\">{{cite book|quote=In plural forms of a single letter an apostrophe can sometimes be clearer ...

The apostrophe here may be seen as marking a contraction where the prefix ''Mc'' or ''[[Irish surname prefixes|Mac]]'' would normally appear.

For example:\n*in the [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] word ''[[mus'haf]]'', a transliteration of {{script|Arab|مصحف}}, the syllables are as in ''mus·haf'', not ''mu·shaf''\n*in the Japanese name ''[[Shin'ichi]]'', the apostrophe shows that the pronunciation is ''shi·n·i·chi'' ([[hiragana]] {{nihongo2|しんいち}}), where the letters ''n'' ({{nihongo2|ん}}) and ''i'' ({{nihongo2|い}}) are separate [[mora (linguistics)|morae]], rather than ''shi·ni·chi'' ({{nihongo2|しにち}}).\n*in the Chinese [[Pinyin]] romanization, the apostrophe (') ({{linktext|隔音符號}}, géyīn fúhào, 'syllable-dividing mark') is used before a syllable starting with a vowel (''a'', ''o'', or ''e'') in a multiple-syllable word when the syllable does not start the word (which is most commonly realized as {{IPA|[ɰ]}}), unless the syllable immediately follows a [[hyphen]] or other dash.<ref name=\"apostrophes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/hanyu/apostrophes.html|title=Apostrophes in Hanyu Pinyin: when and where to use them}}</ref> This is done to remove ambiguity that could arise, as in ''[[Xi'an]]'', which consists of the two syllables ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|xi}}'' (\"{{zh|c=西|labels=no}}\") ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|an}}'' (\"{{zh|c=安|labels=no}}\"), compared to such words as ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|xian}}'' (\"{{zh|c=先|labels=no}}\"). (This ambiguity does not occur when tone marks are used: The two tone marks in ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Xīān}}'' unambiguously show that the word consists of two syllables. However, even with tone marks, the city is usually spelled with an apostrophe as ''{{lang|zh-latn-pinyin|Xī'ān}}''.)\nFurthermore, an apostrophe may be used to indicate a [[glottal stop]] in transliterations. For example:\n*in the Arabic word ''[[Qur'an]]'', a common transliteration of (part of) {{script|Arab|القرآن}} ''al-qur'ān'', the apostrophe corresponds to the diacritic [[Arabic diacritics#Maddah|Maddah]] over the [['alif]], one of the letters in the [[Arabic alphabet]]\nRather than [[ʿ]] the apostrophe is sometimes used to indicate a [[voiced pharyngeal fricative]] as it sounds and looks like the glottal stop to most English speakers. For example:\n*in the Arabic word ''[[Ka'aba]]'' for {{script|Arab|الكعبة}} ''al-kaʿbah'', the apostrophe corresponds to the Arabic letter [[Ayin#Arabic ʿAyn|ʿayn]].\n\n===Non-standard English use===\n{{quote|If you have a name that ends in \"s,\" or if you will observe home-made signs selling tomatoes or chili-and-beans, you will quickly note what can be done with a possessive apostrophe in reckless hands.|[[Algis Budrys]], 1965<ref name=\"budrys196512\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Budrys\n |first=Algis\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1965\n |title=Galaxy Bookshelf\n |department=\n |url=\n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=147–156\n |type=\n}}</ref>}}\n\nFailure to observe standard use of the apostrophe is widespread and frequently criticised as incorrect,<ref>Truss, p.&nbsp;41, pp.&nbsp;48–54.</ref><ref name=HoBS/> often generating heated debate.

The practice, once common and acceptable (see [[#Historical development|Historical development]]), comes from the identical sound of the [[plural]] and [[possessive case|possessive]] forms of most English [[noun]]s. It is often criticised as a form of [[hypercorrection]] coming from a widespread ignorance of the proper use of the apostrophe or of punctuation in general. [[Lynne Truss]], author of ''[[Eats, Shoots & Leaves]]'', points out that before the 19th century it was standard orthography to use the apostrophe to form a plural of a foreign-sounding word that ended in a vowel (e. g., ''banana's'', ''folio's'', ''logo's'', ''quarto's'', ''pasta's'', ''ouzo's'') to clarify pronunciation. Truss says this usage is no longer considered proper in formal writing.<ref>Truss, pp.&nbsp;63–65.</ref>\n\nThe term is believed to have been coined in the middle of the 20th century by a teacher of languages working in [[Liverpool]], at a time when such mistakes were common in the handwritten signs and advertisements of [[greengrocer]]s (e. g., ''Apple's [[shilling|1/-]] a pound, Orange's 1/6[[penny|d]] a pound''). Some have argued that its use in mass communication by employees of well-known companies has led to the less literate assuming it to be standard and adopting the habit themselves.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author= Christina Cavella and Robin A.

For example, in [[Dutch grammar#Plural|Dutch]], the apostrophe is inserted before the ''s'' when pluralising most words ending in a vowel or ''y'' for example, ''baby's'' (English ''babies'') and ''radio's'' (English ''radios'').

For example, the French word {{lang|fr|[[:fr:pin's|pin's]]}} (from English ''pin'') is used (with the apostrophe in both singular and plural) for [[collectible]] [[lapel pin]]s. Similarly, there is an [[Andorra]]n football club called [[FC Ranger's|FC Rànger's]] (after such British clubs as [[Rangers F.C.]]) and a Japanese dance group called [[Super Monkey's]].\n\n====Omission====\nIn the UK there is a tendency to drop apostrophes in many commonly used names such as [[Lytham St Annes|St Annes]], St Johns Lane,<ref>A search on www.multimpap.com for \"St Johns Lane\" in the UK, with or without apostrophe, finds the apostrophe omitted in 5 instances out of 25</ref> and so on.\n\nIn 2009, a resident in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] was accused of [[vandalism]] by one neighbour after he painted apostrophes on road signs that had spelled the street name as ''St Johns Close''.<ref>Fernandez, Colin, [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1207301/Punctuation-hero-branded-vandal-inserting-apostrophes-street-signs.html 'Punctuation hero' branded a vandal for painting apostrophes on street signs], ''[[The Daily Mail]]'', accessed 19 August 2009</ref>\n\nUK supermarket chain [[Tesco]] omits the mark where standard practice would require it.

The name comes from the [[Scouse]] slang for ''lads''.\n\nThe over-use of apostrophes in names in [[fantasy literature]] was satirised by [[Neal Stephenson]] in ''[[Reamde]]''.\n\n===Criticism===\nOver the years, the use of apostrophes has been criticised. George Bernard Shaw called them \"uncouth bacilli\", referring to the apostrophe-like shape of many [[Bacillus|bacteria]]. In his book ''American Speech'', linguist Steven Byington stated of the apostrophe that \"the language would be none the worse for its abolition\". Adrian Room, in his ''[[English Journal]]'' article \"Axing the Apostrophe\", argued that apostrophes are unnecessary, and context will resolve any ambiguity.<ref name=about>{{cite web |url=http://grammar.about.com/b/2008/10/29/the-long-campaign-to-abolish-the-apostrophe.htm|title=The Long Campaign to Abolish the Apostrophe|last=Nordquist|first=Richard|date=29 October 2008|publisher=About.com|accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> In a letter to the ''English Journal'', Peter Brodie stated that apostrophes are \"largely decorative ...

Wells]], emeritus professor of phonetics at [[University College London]], says the apostrophe is \"a waste of time\".<ref name=about/>\n\n==Non-English use==\n\n===As a mark of elision===\nIn many languages, especially European languages, the apostrophe is used to indicate the [[elision]] of one or more sounds, as in English.\n*In [[Albanian language|Albanian]] the apostrophe is used to show that a vowel has been omitted from words, especially in different forms of verbs and in some forms of personal pronoun. For example, ''t'i them'' (from ''të + i them''), ''m'i mori'' (from ''më + i mori''). It is used too in some of the forms of possessive pronouns, for example: ''s'ëmës'' (from ''së ëmës'').\n*In [[Afrikaans]] the apostrophe is used to show that letters have been omitted from words. The most common use is in the indefinite article ''{{'}}n'', which is a contraction of ''een'' meaning 'one' (the number). As the initial ''e'' is omitted and cannot be capitalised, if a sentence begins with ''{{'}}n'' the second word in the sentence is capitalised. For example: ''{{'}}n Boom is groen'', 'A tree is green'. In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals and diminutives where the root ends with long [[vowel]]s, e.g. ''foto's'', ''taxi's'', ''Lulu's'', ''Lulu'tjie'', etc.<ref>{{cite book\n |author-link= http://www.nb.co.za/listing/taalkommissie-van-die-sa-akademie-vir-wetenskap-en-kuns/676/\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |author2-link=\n |title= Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls\n |place= Cape Town, South Africa\n |publisher= Pharos Woordeboeke\n |year= 2002\n |edition=  9th\n |url= http://www.nb.co.za/product/afrikaanse-woordelys-en-spelre-ls----de-uitgawe/7390/\n |isbn= 1-86890-034-7}}</ref>\n*In [[Danish language|Danish]], apostrophes are sometimes seen on [[advertising|commercial]] materials. One might commonly see ''Ta' mig med'' ('Take me with [you]') next to a stand with advertisement leaflets; that would be written ''Tag mig med'' in standard orthography. As in German, the apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive, except when there is already an ''s'', ''x'' or ''z'' present in the base form, as in ''Esajas' bog'' ('the Book of Esajas').\n*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the apostrophe is used to indicate omitted characters. For example, the indefinite article ''een'' can be shortened to ''{{'}}n'', and the definite article ''het'' shortened to ''{{'}}t''. When this happens in the first word of a sentence, the ''second'' word of the sentence is capitalised. In general, this way of using the apostrophe is considered non-standard, except in ''{{'}}s morgens'', ''{{'}}s middags'', ''{{'}}s avonds'', ''{{'}}s nachts'' (for ''des morgens, des middags, des avonds, des nachts'', 'at morning, at afternoon, at evening, at night'). In addition, the apostrophe is used for plurals where the singulars end with long [[vowel]]s, e.g. ''foto's'', ''taxi's''; and for the genitive of proper names ending with these vowels, e.g. ''Anna's'', ''Otto's''. These are in fact elided vowels; use of the apostrophe prevents spellings like ''fotoos'' and ''Annaas''. However, most [[diminutive]]s do not use an apostrophe where the plural forms would; producing spellings such as ''fotootje'' and ''taxietje''.\n*In [[Esperanto]], the [[Fundamento de Esperanto|Fundamento]] limits the elision mark to the definite article ''l{{'}}'' (from ''la'') and singular nominative nouns (''kor{{'}}'' from ''koro'', 'heart'). This is mostly confined to poetry and songs. Idiomatic phrases such as ''dank' al'' (from ''(kun) danko al'', 'thanks to') and ''del{{'}}'' (from ''de la'', 'of the') are nonetheless frequent. In-word elision is usually marked with a [[hyphen]], as in ''D-ro'' (from ''doktoro'', 'Dr'). Some early guides used and advocated the use of apostrophes between word parts, to aid recognition of such [[compound word]]s as ''gitar'ist'o'', 'guitarist'.\n* In [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], and [[Occitan language|Occitan]] word sequences such as ''[[coup d'état|(coup) d'état]]'', ''[[Maître d'hôtel|(maître) d'hôtel]]'' (often shortened to ''maître d{{'}}'', when used in English), ''[[L'Aquila]]'' and ''[[L'Hospitalet de Llobregat]]'' the final vowel in the first word (''de'' 'of', ''la'' 'the', etc.) is elided because the word that follows it starts with a vowel or a [[H|mute h]]. Similarly, French has ''qu'il'' instead of ''que il'' ('that he'), ''c'est'' instead of ''ce est'' ('it is or it's'), and so on. Catalan, French, Italian, and Occitan surnames sometimes contain apostrophes of elision, e.g. ''d'Alembert'', ''D'Angelo''.\n* French feminine singular [[possessive adjective]]s do not undergo elision, but change to the masculine form instead: ''ma'' preceding ''église'' becomes ''mon église'' ('my church').{{NoteTag|In early French such elisions did occur: ''m'espée'' (''ma''&nbsp;+''espée'', modern French ''mon épée'': 'my sword'), ''s'enfance'' (''sa''&nbsp;+''enfance'', ''son enfance'': 'his or her childhood'). But the only modern survivals of this elision with apostrophe are ''m'amie'' and ''m'amour'', as archaic and idiomatic alternatives to ''mon amie'' and ''mon amour'' ('my [female] friend', 'my love'); forms without the apostrophe also used: ''mamie'' or ''ma mie'', ''mamour''.}}\n* [[Quebec]]'s [[Bill 101]], which dictates the use of [[Quebec French|French in the province]], prohibits the use of apostrophes in proper names in which it would not be used in proper French (thus the international donut chain [[Tim Hortons]], originally spelled with the possessive apostrophe as Tim Horton's, was required to drop the apostrophe in Quebec to comply with Bill 101).<ref>{{cite news|last=Dickinson |first=Casey |title=Canadian Doughnut Shop Targets Upstate |work=CNY Business Journal |date=24 November 2000 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200011/ai_n8927439/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318230325/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200011/ai_n8927439 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 March 2006 }}</ref>\n* [[Galician language]] standard admits the use of apostrophe (''apóstrofo'') for contractions that normally don't use (e.g.: de + a= da) it but when the second element is a proper noun, mostly a title: ''o heroe d'A Odisea'' (the heroe of the [[Odyssey]]). They are also used to reproduce oral ellisions and, as stated below, to join (or split) commercial names of popular public establishments, namely bars and in masculine (''O'Pote'', The pot), maybe pretending to remind anglicised versions of [[Irish surnames]].\n* In [[Luganda|Ganda]], when a word ending with a [[vowel]] is followed by a word beginning with a vowel, the final vowel of the first word is [[elision|elided]] and the initial vowel of the second word [[vowel length|lengthened]] in compensation. When the first word is a [[monosyllable]], this elision is represented in the orthography with an apostrophe: in ''taata w'abaana'' 'the father of the children', ''wa'' ('of') becomes&nbsp;''w''{{'}}; in ''y'ani?'' ('who is it?'), ''ye'' ('who') becomes&nbsp;''y{{'}}''. But the final vowel of a [[polysyllable]] is always written, even if it is elided in speech: ''omusajja oyo'' ('this man'), not *''omusajj'oyo'', because ''omusajja'' ('man') is a polysyllable.\n* In German an apostrophe is used almost exclusively to indicate omitted letters. It must not be used for plurals or most of the possessive forms. (The only exceptions are the possessive cases of names ending in an \"s\"-sound as in ''Max' Vater'', or \"to prevent ambiguities\" in all other possessive cases of names, as in ''Andrea's Blumenladen''. The English/Saxon style of using an apostrophe for possession was introduced after the spelling reform, but is strongly disagreed on by native speakers, and discouraged. Although possessive usage (beyond the exceptions) is widespread, it is often deemed incorrect. The German equivalent of \"greengrocers' apostrophes\" would be the derogatory ''Deppenapostroph'' ('idiot's apostrophe'; {{crossref|see the article [[:de:Apostrophitis|Apostrophitis]] in German Wikipedia}}).\n* {{anchor|Greek apostrophe|Apostrofos}}<!--linked from Romanization of Greek, apostrofos, &c.--> In modern printings of [[Ancient Greek]], apostrophes are also used to mark elision. Some Ancient Greek words that end in short vowels elide when the next word starts with a vowel. For example, many Ancient Greek authors would write {{lang|grc|δἄλλος}} (''d'állos'') for {{lang|grc|δὲ ἄλλος}} (''dè állos'') and {{lang|grc|ἆροὐ}} (''âr' ou'') for {{lang|grc|ἆρα οὐ}} (''âra ou''). Such modern usage should be carefully distinguished from [[polytonic orthography|polytonic Greek]]'s native [[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]] marks, which usually appear as a form of rounded apostrophe.\n* In [[Hebrew]], the ''[[geresh]]'' (׳), often typed as an apostrophe, is used to denote initialisms. A double ''geresh'' (״), known by the dual form [[gershayim]], is used to denote [[acronym]]s; it is inserted before (i.e., to the right of) the last letter of the acronym. Examples: פרופ׳ (abbreviation for פרופסור, 'professor', '[[professor]]'); נ״ב (''nun-bet'', '[[P.S.]]'). The ''geresh'' is also used to indicate the elision of a sound; however, this use is much less frequent, and confined to the purpose of imitating a natural, informal utterance, for example: {{Lang|he|אנ׳לא|rtl=yes}} (''anlo'' – short for {{lang|he|אני לא|rtl=yes}}, ''ani lo'', 'I am/do not').\n*In Irish, the past tense of verbs beginning with a vowel, or with ''fh'' followed by a vowel, begins with ''d' ''(elision of ''do''), for example ''do oscail'' becomes ''d'oscail'' ('opened') and ''do fhill'' becomes ''d'fhill'' ('returned'). The [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''is'' is often elided to ''<nowiki />'s'', and ''do'' ('to'), ''mo'' ('my') etc. are elided before ''f'' and vowels.\n*In [[Italian language|Italian]] it is used for elision with pronouns, as in ''l'ha'' instead of ''la ha'', articles, as in ''l'opera'' instead of ''la opera'', and for truncation, as in ''po{{'}}'' instead of ''poco''.\n*In modern [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], the apostrophe marks that a word has been contracted, such as ''ha'kke'' from ''har ikke'' ('have/has not'). Unlike English and French, such elisions are not accepted as part of standard orthography but are used to create a more \"oral style\" in writing. The apostrophe is also used to mark the genitive for words that end in an -s sound: words ending in -s, -x, and -z, some speakers also including words ending in the sound {{IPA-no|ʃ}}. As Norwegian doesn't form the plural with -s, there is no need to distinguish between an -s forming the possessive and the -s forming the plural. Therefore, we have ''mann'' ('man') and ''manns'' ('man's'), without apostrophe, but ''los'' ('naval pilot') and ''los'<nowiki />'' ('naval pilot's'). Indicating the possessive for the two former American presidents named George Bush, whose names end in {{IPA-no|ʃ}}, could be written as both ''Bushs'' (simply adding an -s to the name) and ''Bush'<nowiki />'' (adding an apostrophe to the end of the name).{{clarify|date=June 2018|reason=Replace this confusing example with something that's actually Norwegian.}}\n* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] the apostrophe is also used in a few combinations, such as ''caixa-d'água'' ('water tower'), ''galinha-d'angola'' ('guineafowl'), ''pau-d'alho'' (a plant species, ''Gallesia integrifolia''), etc. Portuguese has many contractions between prepositions and articles or pronouns (like ''na'' for ''em'' + ''a''), but these are written without an apostrophe.\n* Modern Spanish no longer uses the apostrophe to indicate elision in standard writing, although it can sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose.{{NoteTag|Examples include ''Nuestras vidas son los ríos/que van a dar en la mar,/qu'es el morir.'' meaning 'Our lives are the rivers/that flow to give to the sea,/which is death.' (from ''Coplas de Don Jorge Manrique por la muerte de su padre'', 1477) and ''¿...&nbsp;qué me ha de aprovechar ver la pintura/d'aquel que con las alas derretidas&nbsp;...?'' meaning '...&nbsp;what could it help me to see the painting of that one with the melted wings&nbsp;...?' (from the 12th sonnet of Garcilazo de la Vega, c. 1500–36).}} Instead Spanish writes out the spoken elision in full (''de enero'', ''mi hijo'') except for the contraction ''del'' for ''de'' + ''el'', which uses no apostrophe. Spanish also switches to a form that is identical to the masculine article (but is actually a variant of the feminine article) immediately before a feminine noun beginning with a stressed ''a'' instead of writing (or saying) an elision: ''un águila blanca'', ''el águila blanca'', and ''el agua pura'' but ''una/la blanca águila'' and ''la pura agua''. This reflects the origin of the Spanish definite articles from the Latin demonstratives ''ille/illa/illum''.\n*In [[Swedish (language)|Swedish]], the apostrophe marks an elision, such as ''på sta'n'', short for ''på staden'' ('in the city'), to make the text more similar to the spoken language. This is relaxed style, fairly rarely used, and would not be used by traditional newspapers in political articles, but could be used in entertainment related articles and similar. The formal way to denote elision in Swedish is by using colon, e.g. ''S:t Erik'' for ''Sankt Erik'' which is rarely spelled out in full. The apostrophe must not be used to indicate the possessive except – although not mandatory – when there is already an ''s'', ''x'' or ''z'' present in the base form, as in ''Lukas' bok''.\n*[[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the apostrophe to mark elision of the definite article ''yr'' ('the') following a vowel (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''y'', or, in Welsh, ''w''), as in ''i'r tŷ'', 'to the house'. It is also used with the particle ''yn'', such as with ''mae hi'n'', 'she is'.\n\n===As a glottal stop===\n{{See also|ʻOkina{{!}}Okina|Saltillo (linguistics)|Modifier letter apostrophe|Modifier letter double apostrophe|Modifier letter right half ring}}\n\nSeveral languages and transliteration systems use the apostrophe or some similar mark to indicate a [[glottal stop]], sometimes considering it a letter of the alphabet:\n\n*In several [[Finno-Ugric languages]], such as [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; for example in the Finnish word ''raa'an'', being the genitive or accusative of ''raaka'' ('raw').\n*In [[Guaraní language|Guarani]], it is called ''puso'' {{IPA|/puˈso/}}, and used in the words ''ñe'ẽ'' (language, to speak), ''ka'a'' (grass), ''a'ỹ'' (sterile).\n*In [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], the ''[[ʻOkina|ʻokina]]'' {{angle bracket|ʻ}}, an inverted apostrophe, is often rendered as {{angle bracket|'}}. It is considered a letter of the alphabet.\n*[[Mayan language|Mayan]].\n*In the [[Tongan language]], the apostrophe is called a ''fakauʻa'' and is the last letter of the alphabet. It represents the glottal stop. Like the ʻokina, it is inverted.\n*Various other [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Samoan language|Samoan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], and [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]].\n*[[Tetum language|Tetum]], one of the official languages of [[East Timor]].\n*The [[Brazil]]ian native [[Tupi language]].\n*[[Mossi language|Mossi]] (Mooré), a language of [[Burkina Faso]].\n*In [[Võro language|Võro]], the apostrophe is used in parallel with the letter ''q'' as symbol of plural.\n*Several [[fictional languages]] such as [[Klingon language|Klingon]], [[D'ni language|D'ni]], [[Mando'a]] or [[Na'vi language|Na'vi]].<ref>[http://www.zompist.com/kitlong.html Language Construction Kit], refers to the common phenomenon of adding apostrophes to make names appear \"alien\"</ref>\n\nThe apostrophe represents sounds resembling the glottal stop in the [[Turkic languages]] and in some [[romanization]]s of [[Semitic languages]], including [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. In typography, this function may be performed by the closing single [[quotation mark]]. In that case, the letter ''[[ayin|'ayn]]'' (Arabic ع and Hebrew ע) is correspondingly transliterated with the opening single quotation mark.\n\n===As a mark of palatalization or non-palatalization===\nSome languages and [[transliteration]] systems use the apostrophe to mark the presence, or the lack of, [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]:\n\n*In [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], the apostrophe is used between a consonant and a following \"soft\" ([[Iotation|iotified]]) vowel (Be.: [[е]], [[ё]], [[ю]], [[я]]; Uk.: [[є]], [[ї]], [[ю]], [[я]]) to indicate that ''no'' palatalization of the preceding consonant takes place, and the vowel is pronounced in the same way as at the beginning of the word. It therefore marks a morpheme boundary before /j/, and in Ukrainian, is a letter of the alphabet (as the hard sign in Russian is) rather than a simple punctuation mark in English, as it is not a punctuation mark in Ukrainian. It appears frequently in Ukrainian, as, for instance, in the words: <п'ять> [p\"jat'] 'five', <від'їзд> [vid'jizd] 'departure', <об'єднаний> [ob'jednanyj] 'united', <з'ясувати> [z'jasuvaty] 'to clear up, explain', <п'єса> [p'jesa] play (drama), etc.<ref>Daniel Bunčić (Bonn), \"The apostrophe: A neglected and misunderstood reading aid\" at the [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/daniel.buncic/apostroph/apostrophe.pdf Tübingen University website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414224723/http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/daniel.buncic/apostroph/apostrophe.pdf |date=14 April 2012 }}</ref><ref>[http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-1566.html Linguist List 13.1566, Daniel Bunčić, \"Apostrophe rules in languages\"], from 31 May 2002.</ref>\n*In Russian and some derived alphabets, the same function has been served by the [[hard sign]] (ъ, formerly called ''yer''). But the apostrophe saw some use as a substitute after 1918, when Soviet authorities enforced an orthographic reform by confiscating [[movable type]] bearing the hard sign from stubborn printing houses in Petrograd.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090604160709/http://www.vladtv.ru/leksikon.shtml?news=131 \"Лексикон\" Валерия Скорбилина Архив выпусков программы]. vladtv.ru (Archives in Russian)</ref>\n*In some [[Latin transliteration]]s of certain [[Cyrillic alphabets]] (for [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], Russian, and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), the apostrophe is used to replace the [[soft sign]] (ь, indicating palatalization of the preceding consonant), e.g., ''Русь'' is transliterated ''[[Kievan Rus'|Rus']]'' according to the [[BGN/PCGN system]]. (The [[Prime (symbol)#Use in linguistics|prime symbol]] is also used for the same purpose.) Some of these transliteration schemes use a [[Modifier letter double apostrophe|double apostrophe]] (&nbsp;ˮ&nbsp;) to represent the apostrophe in Ukrainian and Belarusian text, e.g. Ukrainian ''слов'янське'' ('Slavic') is transliterated as ''slov\"yans'ke''.\n*Some [[Karelian language|Karelian]] orthographies use an apostrophe to indicate palatalization, e.g. ''n'evvuo'' ('to give advice'), ''d'uuri'' ('just (like)'), ''el'vüttiä'' ('to revive').\n\n===To separate morphemes===\nSome languages use the apostrophe to separate the [[root (linguistics)|root]] of a word and its [[affix]]es, especially if the root is foreign and unassimilated. (For another kind of morphemic separation see [[#Miscellaneous uses in other languages|pinyin]], below.)\n\n* In [[Danish language|Danish]] an apostrophe is sometimes used to join the [[enclitic]] [[definite article]] to words of foreign origin, or to other words that would otherwise look awkward. For example, one would write ''IP'en'' to mean \"the [[IP address]]\". There is some variation in what is considered \"awkward enough\" to warrant an apostrophe; for instance, long-established words such as ''firma'' ('company') or ''niveau'' ('level') might be written ''firma'et'' and ''niveau'et'', but will generally be seen without an apostrophe. Due to Danish influence, this usage of the apostrophe can also be seen in Norwegian, but is non-standard – a hyphen should be used instead: e.g. CD-en (the CD).\n*In [[Estonian language|Estonian]], apostrophes can be used in the declension of some foreign names to separate the stem from any [[declension]] endings; e.g., ''Monet{{'}}'' ([[genitive case]]) or ''Monet'sse'' ([[illative case]]) of ''Monet'' (name of the famous painter).\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], apostrophes are used in the declension of foreign names or loan words that end in a consonant when written but are pronounced with a vowel ending, e.g. ''show'ssa'' ('in a show'), ''Bordeaux'hon'' ('to Bordeaux'). For Finnish as well as [[Swedish language|Swedish]], there is a closely related [[colon (punctuation)#Word-medial separator|use of the colon]].\n*In [[Polish language|Polish]], the apostrophe is used exclusively for marking inflections of words and word-like elements (but not [[acronym]]s – a hyphen is used instead) whose spelling conflicts with the normal rules of inflection. This mainly affects foreign words and names. For instance, one would correctly write ''Kampania Ala Gore'a'' for \"[[Al Gore]]'s campaign\". In this example, ''Ala'' is spelled without an apostrophe, since its spelling and pronunciation fit into normal Polish rules; but ''Gore'a'' needs the apostrophe, because ''e'' disappears from the pronunciation, changing the inflection pattern. This rule is often misunderstood as calling for an apostrophe after ''all'' foreign words, regardless of their pronunciation, yielding the incorrect ''Kampania Al'a Gore'a'', for example. The effect is akin to the greengrocers' apostrophe (see above).\n*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[noun#Proper nouns and common nouns|proper nouns]] are capitalised and an apostrophe is inserted between the noun and any following [[inflectional suffix]], e.g. ''İstanbul'da'' (\"in [[Istanbul]]\"), contrasting with ''okulda'' (\"in school\", ''okul'' is a common noun) and ''İstanbullu'' ('Istanbulite', ''-lu'' is a [[derivational suffix]]).<ref>[http://www.tdk.gov.tr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=187 The rules regarding the apostrophe] on the site of the Turkish Language Institute (TDK), the official authority on the Turkish language</ref>\n*In [[Welsh language|Welsh]] the apostrophe is used with infixed pronouns in order to distinguish them from the preceding word (e.g. ''a'm chwaer'', 'and my sister' as opposed to ''am chwaer'', 'about a sister').\n\n===Miscellaneous uses in other languages===\n*In [[Breton language|Breton]], the combination ''c'h'' is used for the consonant {{IPA|/x/}} (like ''ch'' in English ''Loch Ness''), while ''ch'' is used for the consonant {{IPA|/ʃ/}} (as in French ''chat'' or English ''she'').\n*In [[Czech language|Czech]], an apostrophe is used for writing to indicate spoken or informal language where the writer wants to express the natural way of informal speech, but it should not be used in formal text or text of a serious nature. E.g., instead of ''četl'' ('he read'), the word form ''čet'<nowiki />'' is used. ''Čet'<nowiki />'' is the informal variant of the verb form ''četl'', at least in some varieties.<ref>[http://cja.ujc.cas.cz/CJA4/files/04-0547.pdf Rostl, Četl, příč. min. sg. m.] cja.ujc.cas.cz Retrieved on 8 December 2016.</ref> These two words are the same in meaning, but to use the informal form gives the text a more natural tone, as though a friend were talking to you. Furthermore, the same as in the Slovak case above holds for lowercase ''t'' and ''d'', and for the two-digit year notation.\n*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], one of the [[consonant gradation]] patterns is the change of a ''k'' into a [[Hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]], e.g. ''keko'' → ''keon'' ('a pile' → 'a pile's'). This hiatus has to be indicated in spelling with an apostrophe if a long vowel or a diphthong would be immediately followed by the final vowel, e.g. ''ruoko'' → ''ruo'on'', ''vaaka'' → ''vaa'an''. (This is in contrast to compound words, where the equivalent problem is solved with a [[hyphen]], e.g. ''maa-ala'', 'land area'.) Similarly, the apostrophe is used to mark the [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] (contraction) that occurs in poetry, e.g. ''miss' on'' for ''missä on'' ('where is').\n*[[Galician cuisine|Galician restaurants]] sometimes use ''{{'}}'' in their names instead of the standard article ''O'' ('the').<ref>[http://www.paginasamarillas.es/resultados.asp?activ=Restaurantes+gallegos&nomb=O&prov=MADRID&pgpv=1&mode=listadirGalician Restaurantes gallegos, llamadas O en la provincia de Madrid]. paginasamarillas.es</ref>\n*In [[Luganda|Ganda]], ''ng{{'}}'' (pronounced {{IPA|/ŋ/}}) is used in place of ''ŋ'' on keyboards where this character is not available. The apostrophe distinguishes it from the letter combination ''ng'' (pronounced {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}}), which has separate use in the language. Compare this with the Swahili usage below.\n*In [[Hebrew]], the ''[[geresh]]'' (a diacritic similar to the apostrophe and often represented by one) is used for several purposes other than to mark an elision:\n**As an adjacent to letters to show sounds that are not represented in the [[Hebrew alphabet]]: Sounds such as {{IPAslink|dʒ}} (English ''j'' as in ''job''), {{IPAslink|θ}} (English ''th'' as in ''thigh''), and {{IPAslink|tʃ}} (English ''ch'' as in ''check'') are indicated using ג, ת, and צ with a ''[[geresh]]'' (informally ''chupchik''). For example, the name ''George'' is spelled ג׳ורג׳ in Hebrew (with ג׳ representing the first and last consonants).\n**To denote a [[Hebrew numerals|Hebrew numeral]] (e.g., נ׳, which stands for '50')\n**To denote a Hebrew letter which stands for itself (e.g., מ׳ – the letter ''[[mem]]'')\n**[[Gershayim]] (a double geresh) to denote a Hebrew letter name (e.g., למ״ד – the letter ''[[lamed]]'')\n**Another (rarer) use of geresh is to denote the last syllable (which in some cases, but not all, is a [[suffix]]) in some words of [[Yiddish]] [[etymology|origin]] (e.g., חבר׳ה, מיידל׳ה).\n**In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early modern period]], gershayim were also used to denote foreign words, as well as a means of [[Emphasis (typography)|emphasis]].\n* In Italian, an apostrophe is sometimes used as a substitute for a [[Grave accent|grave]] or an [[acute accent]] after a final vowel: in capitals, or when the proper form of the letter is unavailable. So ''Niccolò'' might be rendered as ''Niccolo{{'}}'', or ''NICCOLO{{'}}''; ''perché'', as ''perche{{'}}'', or ''PERCHE{{'}}''. This applies only to machine or computer writing, in the absence of a suitable keyboard. \n* In [[Jèrriais]], one of the uses of the apostrophe is to mark [[gemination]], or consonant length: For example, ''t't'' represents {{IPA|/tː/}}, ''s's'' {{IPA|/sː/}}, ''n'n'' {{IPA|/nː/}}, ''th'th'' {{IPA|/ðː/}}, and ''ch'ch'' {{IPA|/ʃː/}} (contrasted with {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/ð/}}, and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}).\n* In standard [[Lojban]] orthography, the apostrophe is a letter in its own right (called y'y [əhə]) that can appear only between two vowels, and is phonemically realised as either [[voiceless glottal fricative|[h]]] or, more rarely, [[voiceless dental fricative|[θ]]].\n*In [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] the apostrophe is sometimes used to represent the sound [[schwa]], which can be found on dialectal levels, but not in the Standard Macedonian.\n*In [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the [[caron]] over lowercase ''t'', ''d'', ''l'', and uppercase ''L'' [[consonants]] resembles an apostrophe, for example, ''ď'', ''ť'', ''ľ'',  and ''Ľ''. This is especially so in certain common typographic renderings. But it is non-standard to use an apostrophe instead of the caron. There is also ''l'' with an acute accent: ''ĺ'', ''Ĺ''. In Slovak the apostrophe is properly used only to indicate [[elision]] in certain words (''tys{{'}}'', as an abbreviated form of ''ty si'' ('you are'), or ''hor{{'}}'' for ''hore'' ('up')); however, these elisions are restricted to poetry (with a few exceptions). Moreover, the apostrophe is also used before a two-digit year number (to indicate the omission of the first two digits): ''{{'}}87'' (usually used for 1987).\n* In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], an apostrophe after ''ng'' shows that there is no sound of {{IPA|/ɡ/}} after the {{IPA|/ŋ/}} sound; that is, that the ''ng'' is pronounced as in English ''singer'', not as in English ''finger''.\n* In [[Switzerland]], the apostrophe is used as [[thousands separator]] alongside the [[fixed space]] (e.g., 2'000'000 or {{val|2000000}} for two million) in all four [[languages of Switzerland|national languages]].\n* In the new [[Uzbek alphabet|Uzbek Latin alphabet]] adopted in 2000, the apostrophe serves as a [[diacritic|diacritical mark]] to distinguish different phonemes written with the same letter: it differentiates ''o{{'}}'' (corresponding to Cyrillic ''[[Short U (Cyrillic)|ў]]'') from ''o'', and ''g{{'}}'' (Cyrillic ''[[Ghayn|ғ]]'') from ''g''. This avoids the use of special characters, allowing Uzbek to be typed with ease in ordinary [[ASCII]] on any Latin keyboard. In addition, a postvocalic apostrophe in Uzbek represents the glottal stop phoneme derived from Arabic ''[[hamza]]h'' or ''[[Ayin|'ayn]]'', replacing Cyrillic ''[[Yer|ъ]]''.\n*In English [[Yorkshire dialect]], the apostrophe is used to represent the word ''the'', which is contracted to a more glottal (or 'unreleased') /t/ sound. Most users will write ''in t'barn'' ('in the barn'), ''on t'step'' ('on the step'); and those unfamiliar with Yorkshire speech will often make these sound like ''intuh barn'' and ''ontuh step''. A more accurate rendition might be ''in't barn'' and ''on't step'', though even this does not truly convey correct Yorkshire pronunciation as the ''t'' is more like a [[glottal stop]].\n*In the [[pinyin]] (hànyǔ pīnyīn) system of [[romanization]] for [[Standard Chinese]], an apostrophe is often loosely said to separate syllables in a word where ambiguity could arise. Example: the standard romanization for the name of the city ''[[Xī'ān]]'' includes an apostrophe to distinguish it from a single-syllable word ''xian''. More strictly, however, it is standard to place an apostrophe only before every ''a'', ''e'', or ''o'' that starts a new syllable after the first if it is not preceded by a hyphen or a dash. Examples: ''[[Tiananmen|Tiān'ānmén]]'', ''[[Yǎ'ān]]''; but simply ''[[Jǐnán]]'', in which the syllables are ''ji'' and ''nan'', since the absence of an apostrophe shows that the syllables are not ''jin'' and ''an'' (contrast ''[[Jīn'ān]]'').<ref>[http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/hanyu/apostrophes.html Apostrophes in Hanyu Pinyin: when and where to use them]. Pinyin.info. Retrieved on 7 April 2013.</ref> This is a kind of morpheme-separation marking (see [[#To separate morphemes|above]]).\n*In the largely superseded [[Wade-Giles|Wade–Giles]] romanization for Standard Chinese, an apostrophe marks [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] of the preceding consonant sound. Example: in ''tsê'' (pinyin ''ze'') the consonant represented by ''ts'' is unaspirated, but in ''ts'ê'' (pinyin ''ce'') the consonant represented by ''ts{{'}}'' is aspirated.\n*In some systems of romanization for the Japanese, the apostrophe is used between [[Mora (linguistics)|moras]] in ambiguous situations, to differentiate between, for example, ''na'' and ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''. (This is similar to the practice in Pinyin mentioned above.)\n*In science fiction and fantasy, the apostrophe is often used in fictional names, sometimes to indicate a [[glottal stop]] (for example [[Mitth'raw'nuruodo]] in ''[[Star Wars]]''), but also sometimes simply for decoration.\n\n==Typographic form==\nThe form of the apostrophe originates in [[manuscript]] writing, as a point with a downwards tail curving clockwise. This form was inherited by the ''typographic apostrophe'' (&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: serif;\">’</span>&nbsp;), also known as the ''[[typeset]] apostrophe'', or, informally, the ''curly apostrophe''. Later [[sans-serif]] typefaces had stylised apostrophes with a more geometric or simplified form, but usually retaining the same directional bias as a closing quotation mark.\n\nWith the invention of the [[typewriter]], a \"neutral\" quotation mark form (&nbsp;'&nbsp;) was created to economize on the keyboard, by using a single key to represent: the apostrophe, both opening and closing single [[quotation mark]]s, single [[prime (symbol)|primes]], and on some typewriters the [[exclamation point]] by overprinting with a period. This is known as the ''typewriter apostrophe'' or ''vertical apostrophe''. The same convention was adopted for [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nBoth simplifications carried over to computer keyboards and the [[ASCII]] character set. However, although these are widely used due to their ubiquity and convenience, they are deprecated in contexts where proper typography is important.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080304032823/http://apostropheatrophy.com/ Apostrophe Atrophy].

As such, it is a highly overloaded character. In ASCII, it represents a left single [[quotation mark]], right single quotation mark, apostrophe, vertical line or [[prime (symbol)|prime]] (punctuation marks), or an [[acute accent]] (modifier letters).\n\nMany earlier (pre-1985) computer displays and printers rendered the ASCII apostrophe as a typographic apostrophe, and rendered the ASCII [[grave accent]] (&nbsp;'''`'''&nbsp;) U+0060 as a matching left single quotation mark. This allowed a more typographic appearance of text: <code>``I&nbsp;can't'&#39;</code> would appear as <tt>‘‘I&nbsp;can’t’’</tt> on these systems. This can still be seen in many documents prepared at that time, and is still used in the [[TeX]] typesetting system to create typographic quotes.\n\n===Typographic apostrophe in 8-bit encodings===\nSupport for the typographic apostrophe (&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family:serif\">’</span>&nbsp;) was introduced in several 8-bit character encodings, such as the [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]] operating system's [[Mac Roman]] character set (in 1984), and later in the [[CP1252]] encoding of [[Microsoft Windows]]. Both sets also used this code point for a closing single quote. There is no such character in [[ISO 8859-1]].\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows code page|code page]] [[CP1252]] (sometimes incorrectly called ''ANSI'' or ''ISO-Latin'') contains the typographic apostrophe at 0x92. Due to \"smart quotes\" in Microsoft software converting the ASCII apostrophe to this value, other software makers have been effectively forced to adopt this as a ''de facto'' convention. For instance, the [[HTML5]] standard specifies that this value is interpreted as this character from CP1252.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#character-encodings-0 |title=8 The HTML syntax |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=17 December 2012 |website= |publisher=W3C |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref> Some earlier non-Microsoft browsers would display a '?' for this and make web pages composed with Microsoft software somewhat hard to read.\n\n===Entering apostrophes===\nAlthough ubiquitous in typeset material, the typographic apostrophe (&nbsp;<span style=\"font-family: serif\">’</span>&nbsp;) is rather difficult to enter on a computer, since it does not have its own key on a standard keyboard. Outside the world of professional typesetting and graphic design, many people do not know how to enter this character and instead use the typewriter apostrophe (&nbsp;'&nbsp;). The typewriter apostrophe has always been considered tolerable on Web pages because of the egalitarian nature of Web publishing, the low resolution of computer monitors in comparison to print, and legacy limitations provided by ASCII.\n\nMore recently, the standard use of the typographic apostrophe is becoming more common on the Web due to the wide adoption of the [[Unicode]] text encoding standard, higher-resolution displays, and advanced [[spatial anti-aliasing|anti-aliasing]] of text in modern operating systems. Because typewriter apostrophes are now often automatically converted to typographic apostrophes by [[word processor|word processing]] and desktop publishing software, the typographic apostrophe does often appear in documents produced by non-professionals, albeit sometimes incorrectly—see the section \"Smart Quotes\" below.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+How to enter typographic apostrophes on a computer (US keyboard layout)\n!

A similar facility may be offered on web servers after submitting text in a form field, e.g. on weblogs or free encyclopedias. This is known as the ''smart quotes'' feature; apostrophes and quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as ''dumb quotes''.\n\nSuch conversion is not always correct. Smart quotes often incorrectly converts a leading apostrophe to an opening quotation mark (e.g., in abbreviations of years: ''<span style=\"font-family: serif\">‘</span>29'' rather than the correct ''<span style=\"font-family:serif\">’</span>29'' for the years ''1929'' or ''2029'' (depending on context); or ''<span style=\"font-family: serif\">‘</span>twas'' instead of ''<span style=\"font-family: serif\">’</span>twas'' as the [[archaism|archaic]] abbreviation of ''it was''). Smart quote features also often fail to recognise situations when a [[prime (symbol)|prime]] rather than an apostrophe is needed; for example, incorrectly rendering the latitude 49°&nbsp;53&prime;&nbsp;08″ as 49°&nbsp;53<span style=\"font-family: serif\">’</span>&nbsp;08<span style=\"font-family: serif\">\"</span>.\n\nIn [[Microsoft Word]] it is possible to turn smart quotes off (in some versions, by navigating through ''Tools'', ''AutoCorrect'', ''AutoFormat as you type'', and then unchecking the appropriate option). Alternatively, typing Control-Z (for ''Undo'') immediately after entering the apostrophe will convert it back to a typewriter apostrophe. In Microsoft Word for Windows, holding down the Control key while typing two apostrophes will produce a single typographic apostrophe.\n\n===Programming===\nSome programming languages, like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], use the ASCII apostrophe to delimit [[string literal]]s. In many languages, including [[JavaScript]], [[ECMAScript]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]], either the apostrophe or the double quote may be used, allowing string literals to contain the other character (but not to contain both without using an [[escape character]]), e.g. <code>foo = 'He said \"Bar!\"';</code>. Strings delimited with apostrophes are often called ''single quoted''. Some languages, such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], and many shell languages, treat single quoted strings as \"raw\" strings, while double quoted strings have expressions (such as \"$variable\") replaced with their values when interpreted.\n\nThe [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] (and many [[List of C-family programming languages|derived languages]] like [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]) uses apostrophes to delimit a [[character literal]]. In these languages a character is a different object than a one-letter string.\n\nIn [[C++]], since [[C++14]], apostrophes are also used as digit separators in numeric literals.\n\nIn [[Visual Basic]] (and earlier Microsoft BASIC dialects such as QuickBASIC) an apostrophe is used to denote the start of a comment.{{NoteTag|As a comment character in MS BASIC, the apostrophe is in most cases an abbreviation of the REM statement, which can be appended to the end of almost any line with a colon (:). The cases where the apostrophe is not an abbreviation for <code>REM</code> would be those where the apostrophe is allowed but a REM statement is not. Note that there are also cases of the reverse constraint; for example, in QuickBASIC, a comment at the end of a DATA statement line cannot start with an apostrophe but must use <code>: REM</code>.}}\n\nIn the [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] family of programming languages, an apostrophe is shorthand for the <code>quote</code> operator.\n\nIn [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], in addition to being used to delimit a character literal, an apostrophe can start an explicit [[Object lifetime|lifetime]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Apologetic apostrophe]]\n*[[Caron]]\n*[[Contraction (grammar)]]\n*[[Elision]]\n*[[Genitive case]]\n*[[Modifier letter double apostrophe]]\n*[[Possessive case]]\n*[[MOS:'|Wikipedia Manual of Style §&nbsp;Apostrophes]] for the use of different apostrophe characters within Wikipedia\n\n==Notes==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |authorlink=Lynne Truss |last=Truss |first=Lynne |title=[[Eats, Shoots & Leaves|Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation]] |year=2003 |publisher=Gotham Books |location=Toronto |edition= North American |ISBN = 1-59240-087-6 }}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|apostrophe}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224635/http://stc-carolina.org/newsletter/tiki-index.php?page=Obsessed+with+Possessives \"Obsessed with Possessives\"] The Carolina Chapter of the [[Society for Technical Communication]] article on apostrophe use with possessives.\n*[http://snowball.tartarus.org/texts/apostrophe.html The apostrophe character] Problems representing apostrophes on computers\n*[http://www.apostrophe.org.uk/ The Apostrophe Protection Society]\n*[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ucs/quotes.html ASCII and Unicode quotation marks]\n*[http://www.dreaded-apostrophe.com/ The Dreaded Apostrophe: An approach using a single rule only]\n*[http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apostrophe How to use an apostrophe] The Oatmeal\n{{refend}}\n*[http://observer.american.edu/cas/tesol/resources/working-paper-2.cfm \"How the Past Affects the Future: The Story of the Apostrophe\"] by Christina Cavella and Robin A.

The chants are written and notated in accordance with the special signs or marks printed in the [[Masoretic text]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (or [[Tanakh]]) to complement the letters and vowel points.\n\nThese marks are known in English as ''accents'', ''notes'' or ''trope symbols'', and in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as {{lang|he|טעמי המקרא}} ''ta`amei ha-mikra'' or just {{lang|he|טעמים}} ''te`amim''.  Some of these signs were also sometimes used in medieval manuscripts of the [[Mishnah]].  The musical motifs associated with the signs are known in Hebrew as ''niggun'' or ''neginot'' (not to be confused with [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] [[nigun]]) and in [[Yiddish]] as {{lang|he|טראָפ}} '''trop''': the word ''trope'' is sometimes used in [[Jewish English languages|Jewish English]] with the same meaning.\n\n== History ==\nThree systems of Hebrew punctuation (including vowels and cantillation symbols) have been used: the Babylonian, the Palestinian and the Tiberian, only the last of which is used today.\n\n===Babylonian system===\n\nBabylonian Biblical manuscripts from the [[Geonim|Geonic]] period contain no cantillation marks in the current sense, but small Hebrew letters are used to mark significant divisions within a verse.  Up to eight different letters are found, depending on the importance of the break and where it occurs in the verse: these correspond roughly to the disjunctives of the Tiberian system.  For example, in some manuscripts the letter ''tav'', for ''tevir'' (break), does duty for both Tiberian ''tevir'' and ''zaqef''.<ref>In more than one tradition, the melodic outline of ''darga tevir'' is similar to that of ''(mahpach) pashta zaqef qaton'', though their syntactical functions are not quite the same.</ref>  In general there are no symbols for the conjunctives, though some late manuscripts use the Tiberian symbols for these.  There is also no equivalent for low-grade disjunctives such as ''telishah gedolah'': these are generally replaced by the equivalent of ''zaqef'' or ''revia''.\n\nNothing is known of the musical realization of these marks, but it seems likely that they represent breaks or variations in a set melody applied to each verse.  (A somewhat similar system is used in manuscripts of the [[Qur'an]] to guide the reader in fitting the chant to the verse: see ''[[Qur'an reading]]''.)\n\nThis system is reflected in the cantillation practices of the [[Yemenite Jews]], who now use the Tiberian symbols, but tend to have musical motifs only for the disjunctives and render the conjunctives in a monotone.  It is notable that the Yemenite Jews have only eight disjunctive motifs, thus clearly reflecting the Babylonian notation. The same is true of the Karaite mode for the haftarah; while in the Sephardi haftarah modes different disjunctives often have the same or closely similar motifs, reducing the total number of effective motifs to something like the same number.\n\n=== Palestinian system ===\n\nThe Babylonian system, as mentioned above, is mainly concerned with showing breaks in the verse.  Early Palestinian manuscripts, by contrast, are mainly concerned with showing phrases: for example the ''tifcha-etnachta'', ''zarqa-segolta'' and ''pashta-zaqef'' sequences, with or without intervening unaccented words.  These sequences are generally linked by a series of dots, beginning or ending with a dash or a dot in a different place to show which sequence is meant.  Unaccented words (which in the Tiberian system carry conjunctives) are generally shown by a dot following the word, as if to link it to the following word.  There are separate symbols for more elaborate tropes like ''pazer'' and ''telisha gedolah''.\n\nThe manuscripts are extremely fragmentary, no two of them following quite the same conventions, and these marks may represent the individual reader's aide-memoire rather than a formal system of punctuation (for example, vowel signs are often used only where the word would otherwise be ambiguous).  In one manuscript, presumably of somewhat later date than the others, there are separate marks for different conjunctives, actually outnumbering those in the Tiberian system (for example, ''munach'' before ''etnachta'' has a different sign from ''munach'' before ''zaqef''), and the overall system approaches the Tiberian in comprehensiveness.  In some other manuscripts, in particular those containing [[Targum]]im rather than original text, the Tiberian symbols have been added by a later hand.  In general, it may be observed that the Palestinian and Tiberian systems are far more closely related to each other than either is to the Babylonian.\n\nThis system of phrasing is reflected in the Sephardic cantillation modes, in which the conjunctives (and to some extent the \"near companions\" such as ''tifcha'', ''pashta'' and ''zarqa'') are rendered as flourishes leading into the motif of the following disjunctive rather than as motifs in their own right.\n\nThe somewhat inconsistent use of dots above and below the words as disjunctives is closely similar to that found in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] texts.<ref>[[Segal, J. B.]], ''The Diacritical Point and the Accents in Syriac'': Oxford 1953, repr. 2003 {{ISBN|1-59333-032-4}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59333-032-3}}.</ref>  Kahle<ref>''Masoreten des Westens''.</ref> also notes some similarity with the punctuation of [[Samaritan Hebrew]].\n\n=== Tiberian system ===\n\nBy the tenth century C.E., the chant in use in Palestine had clearly become more complex, both because of the existence of ''pazer'', ''geresh'' and ''telisha'' motifs in longer verses and because the realization of a phrase ending with a given type of break varied according to the number of words and syllables in the phrase.  The Tiberian [[Masoretes]] therefore decided to invent a comprehensive notation with a symbol on each word, to replace the fragmentary systems previously in use.  In particular, it was necessary to invent a range of different conjunctive accents to show how to introduce and elaborate the main motif in longer phrases.  (For example, ''tevir'' is preceded by ''mercha'', a short flourish, in shorter phrases but by ''darga'', a more elaborate run of notes, in longer phrases.)  The system they devised is the one in use today, and is found in Biblical manuscripts such as the [[Aleppo Codex]].  A Masoretic treatise called ''Diqduqe ha-te'amim'' (precise rules of the accents) by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]] survives, though both the names and the classification of the accents differ somewhat from those of the present day.\n\nAs the accents were (and are) not shown on a Torah scroll, it was found necessary to have a person making hand signals to the reader to show the tune, as in the Byzantine system of [[neume]]s.  This system of [[cheironomy]] survives in some communities to the present day, notably in [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italy]].  It is speculated that both the shapes and the names of some of the accents (e.g. ''tifcha'', literally \"hand-breadth\") may refer to the hand signals rather than to the syntactical functions or melodies denoted by them.  Today in most communities there is no system of hand signals and the reader learns the melody of each reading in advance.\n\nThe Tiberian system spread quickly and was accepted in all communities by the 13th century.  Each community re-interpreted its reading tradition so as to allocate one short musical motif to each symbol: this process has gone furthest in the Western Ashkenazi and Ottoman (Jerusalem-Sephardi, Syrian etc.) traditions.  Learning the accents and their musical rendition is now an important part of the preparations for a [[B'nai Mitzvah|bar mitzvah]], as this is the first occasion on which a person reads from the [[Torah]] in public.\n\nIn the early period of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] there was a move to abandon the system of cantillation and give Scriptural readings in normal speech (in Hebrew or in the vernacular).  In recent decades, however, traditional cantillation has been restored in many communities.\n\n==Purpose==\n\n===Synagogue use===\nA primary purpose of the cantillation signs is to guide the chanting of the sacred texts during public worship. Very roughly speaking, each word of text has a cantillation mark at its primary accent and associated with that mark is a musical phrase that tells how to sing that word.  The reality is more complex, with some words having two or no marks and the musical meaning of some marks dependent upon context. There are different sets of musical phrases associated with different sections of the Bible. The music varies with different Jewish traditions and individual [[Hazzan|cantorial]] styles.\n\n===Explanation to text===\nThe cantillation signs also provide information on the syntactical structure of the text and some say they are a commentary on the text itself, highlighting important ideas musically. The tropes are not random strings but follow a set and describable grammar.  The very word ''ta'am'', used in Hebrew to refer to the cantillation marks, literally means \"taste\" or \"sense\", the point being that the pauses and intonation denoted by the accents (with or without formal musical rendition) bring out the sense of the passage.\n\n==Different systems for different sets of books==\nThere are two systems of cantillation marks in the [[Tanakh]].  One is used in the twenty-one prose books, while the other appears in the three poetical books of [[Book of Psalms|Psalms]], [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Book of Job|Job]].  Except where otherwise stated, this article describes the \"prose\" system.\n\n==Traditional roots==\nThe current system of cantillation notes has its historical roots in the Tiberian [[Masoretic Text|masorah]]. The cantillation signs are included in [[Unicode]] as characters U+0591 through U+05AF in the [[Hebrew (Unicode block)|Hebrew]] block.\n\n===Different naming according to rites===\nThe names of some of the cantillation signs differ in the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]], [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] traditions; for example Sephardim use ''qadma'' to mean what Ashkenazim call ''pashta'', and ''azla'' to mean what Ashkenazim call ''qadma''.<ref>Technically, ''qadma''/''azla'' before ''gerish'' is a different sign from ''qadma'' before other disjunctives, even though they look identical. Sephardim reserve ''azla'' for the first of these: the second is ''qadma meḥabber''.</ref> In this article, as in almost all Hebrew grammars, the Ashkenazi terminology is used.  The names in other traditions are shown in the table [[#Names in different traditions|below]].\n\n==Functions of cantillation signs in explanation of text==\n\nThe cantillation signs serve three functions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Functions\n!Function\n!Description\n|-\n| Syntax\n| They divide biblical verses into smaller units of meaning, a function which also gives them a limited but sometimes important role as a source for [[Exegesis#Judaism|exegesis]].  This function is accomplished through the use of various conjunctive signs (which indicate that words should be connected in a single phrase) and especially a hierarchy of dividing signs of various strength which divide each verse into smaller phrases.  The function of the disjunctive cantillation signs may be roughly compared to modern punctuation signs such as periods, commas, semicolons, etc.\n|-\n| Phonetics\n| Most of the cantillation signs indicate the specific syllable where the stress (accent) falls in the pronunciation of a word.\n|-\n| Music\n| The cantillation signs have musical value: reading the [[Hebrew Bible]] with cantillation becomes a musical chant, where the music itself serves as a tool to emphasise the proper accentuation and syntax (as mentioned previously).\n|}\n\n===Syntax===\nIn general, each word in the Tanach has one cantillation sign. This may be either a ''disjunctive'', showing a division between that and the following word, or a ''conjunctive'', joining the two words (like a slur in music). Thus, disjunctives divide a verse into phrases, and within each phrase all the words except the last carry conjunctives. (There are two types of exception to the rule about words having only one sign. A group of words joined by hyphens is regarded as one word so they only have one accent between them. Conversely, a long word may have two—e.g., a disjunctive on the stressed syllable and the related conjunctive two syllables before in place of ''meteg''.)\n\nThe disjunctives are traditionally divided into four levels, with lower level disjunctives marking less important breaks.\n\n#The first level, known as \"Emperors\", includes ''[[sof pasuq|sof pasuk]]'' / ''siluk'', marking the end of the verse, and ''atnach'' / ''[[etnachta]]'', marking the middle.\n#The second level is known as \"Kings\". The usual second level disjunctive is ''[[zakef katan|zakef qatan]]'' (when on its own, this becomes ''[[zakef gadol]]''). This is replaced by ''[[tifcha]]'' when in the immediate neighborhood of ''sof pasuk'' or ''atnach''. A stronger second level disjunctive, used in very long verses, is ''[[segol (trope)|segol]]'': when it occurs on its own, this may be replaced by ''[[shalshelet]]''.\n#The third level is known as \"Dukes\". The usual third level disjunctive is ''[[revia (cantillation)|revia]]''.  For musical reasons, this is replaced by ''[[zarka]]'' when in the vicinity of ''segol'', by ''[[pashta]]'' or ''[[yetiv]]'' when in the vicinity of ''zakef'', and by ''[[tevir]]'' when in the vicinity of ''tifcha''.\n#The fourth level is known as \"Counts\". These are found mainly in longer verses, and tend to cluster near the beginning of a half-verse: for this reason their musical realisation is usually more elaborate than that of higher level disjunctives. They are ''[[pazer]]'', ''[[geresh]]'', ''[[gershayim]]'', ''[[telisha gedola]]h'', ''munach legarmeh'' and ''qarne farah''.\n\nThe general conjunctive is ''[[munach]]''. Depending on which disjunctive follows, this may be replaced by ''[[mercha]]'', ''[[mahpach]]'', ''[[darga]]'', ''[[kadma|qadma]]'', ''[[telisha ketana|telisha qetannah]]'' or ''[[yerach ben yomo]]''.\n\nOne other symbol is ''[[mercha kefula]]h'', double mercha. There is some argument about whether this is another conjunctive or an occasional replacement for ''tevir''.\n\nDisjunctives have a function somewhat similar to punctuation in Western languages. ''Sof pasuk'' could be thought of as a full stop, ''atnach'' as a semi-colon, second level disjunctives as commas and third level disjunctives as commas or unmarked. Where two words are written in the [[construct state]] (for example, ''pene ha-mayim'', \"the face of the waters\"), the first noun (''nomen regens'') invariably carries a conjunctive.\n\nThe cantillation signs are often an important aid in the interpretation of a passage.  For example, the words ''qol qore bamidbar panu derekh [[YHWH]]'' ([http://kjv.biblebrowser.com/isaiah/40-3.htm Isaiah 40:3]) is translated in the [[King James Version of the Bible|Authorised Version]] as \"The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD\".  As the word ''qore'' takes the high-level disjunctive ''zakef katon'' this meaning is discouraged by the cantillation marks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Accordingly, the [[New Revised Standard Version]] translates \"A voice cries out: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the {{LORD}}, ...'\" while the [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New Jewish Publication Society Version]] has \"A voice rings out: 'Clear in the desert a road for the {{LORD}}'.\"\n\n===Phonetics===\nMost cantillation signs are written on the consonant of the stressed syllable of a word.  This also shows where the most important note of the musical motif should go.\n\nA few signs always go on the first or last consonant of a word.  This may have been for musical reasons, or it may be to distinguish them from other accents of similar shape.  For example, ''pashta'', which goes on the last consonant, otherwise looks like k''adma'', which goes on the stressed syllable.\n\nSome signs are written (and sung) differently when the word is not stressed on its last syllable.  ''Pashta'' on a word of this kind is doubled, one going on the stressed syllable and the other on the last consonant.  ''Geresh'' is doubled unless it occurs on a non-finally-stressed word or follows k''adma'' (to form the k''adma ve-azla'' phrase).\n\n===Music===\nCantillation signs guide the reader in applying a chant to Biblical readings. This chant is technically regarded as a ritualized form of speech intonation rather than as a musical exercise like the singing of metrical hymns: for this reason Jews always speak of ''saying'' or ''reading'' a passage rather than of ''singing'' it. (In [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] the word is ''leynen'' 'read', derived from Latin ''legere'', giving rise to the [[Jewish English languages|Jewish English]] verb \"to leyn\".)\n\nThe musical value of the cantillation signs serves the same function for Jews worldwide, but the specific tunes vary between different communities. The most common tunes today are as follows.\n\n*Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]:\n**The Polish-Lithuanian melody, used by [[Ashkenazic]] descendants of eastern European Jews, is the most common tune in the world today, both in Israel and the diaspora.\n**The [[Ashkenazic]] melodies from central and western European Jewry are used far less today than before [[the Holocaust]], but still survive in some communities, especially in Great Britain. They are of interest because a very similar melody was notated by [[Johann Reuchlin]] as in use in Germany in his day (15th–16th century, C.E.).\n*Among [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews]]:\n**The \"Jerusalem Sephardic\" (''Sepharadi-Yerushalmi'') melody is now the most widely used Sephardic melody in Israel, and is also used in some Sephardic communities in the diaspora.\n**The Greek/Turkish/Balkan, [[Syrian Jews|Syrian]] and [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian]] melodies are related to the Jerusalem Sephardic melody. They are more sparingly used in Israel today, but are still heard in the Diaspora, especially in America.\n**There are two [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Iraqi]] melodies, one close to the Syrian melody and traditionally used in Baghdad (and sometimes in Israel), and another more distinctive melody originating in Mosul and generally used in the Iraqi Jewish diaspora, especially in India.<ref>Specimens of both may be found [https://web.archive.org/web/20130129170812/http://hazzan.qpon.co.il/Front/Multimedia/albom.asp?mBoundary=11371&aType=3 here]. It is possible that the Mosul melody represents the older Iraqi tradition and that the Baghdad melody was imported from Syria following the appointment of Chief Rabbi Sadka Bekhor Hussein in 1743.</ref>\n**The [[Moroccan cantillation|Moroccan melody]] is used widely by Jews of Moroccan descent, both in Israel and in the diaspora, especially France. It subdivides into a Spanish-Moroccan melody, used in the northern coastal strip, and an Arab-Moroccan melody, used in the interior of the country, with some local variations. The Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan melodies are somewhat similar, and may be regarded as intermediate between the Moroccan and \"Jerusalem Sephardic\" melodies. \n**The [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews#Cantillation|Spanish and Portuguese melody]] is in common use in the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish and Portuguese Sephardi]] communities of [[Jewish community of Livorno|Livorno]], [[Gibraltar]], the Netherlands, England, Canada, the United States and other places in the Americas. It is closely related to the Spanish-Moroccan melody and has some resemblance to the Iraqi (Mosul and diaspora) melody.\n*[[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] melodies are still used in Italy, as well as in one Italian synagogue in Jerusalem, one in [[Italian Synagogue (Istanbul)|Istanbul]], and one in [[New York City]]. These vary greatly locally: for example the melody used in Rome resembles the Spanish and Portuguese melody rather than those used in northern Italy.\n*[[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] style of cantillation is used today in Greece, New York and Israel and is rooted in the Byzantine [[Byzantine music|tradition]]<ref>Ross, M. S., Europäisches Zentrum für Jüdische Musik, CD-Projekt: „Synagogale Musik der romaniotischen Juden Griechenlands“ -ongoing/2016-</ref> \n*The [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] melody can be heard in Israel primarily, but also in some American cities.<ref>[http://jewishyemenites.com/JY_synog.html Yemenite Synagogues in America]</ref>\n\n====Reconstructed melody====\nThere has been an attempted reconstruction of the original melody by [[Suzanne Haïk-Vantoura]], on the basis of the shapes and positions of the marks and without any reference to existing melodies, as described in her book ''La musique de la Bible révélée'' and her records. That reconstruction assumes the signs represent the degrees of various musical scales, that is individual notes, which puts it at odds with all existing traditions where the signs invariably represent melodic motives; it also takes no account of the existence of older systems of notation, such as the [[#Babylonian system|Babylonian]] and [[#Palestinian system|Palestinian]] systems. Musicologists have rejected her results as dubious and her methodology as flawed.<ref>Dalia Cohen and Daniel Weill. \"Progress in Deductive Research on the Original Performance of Tiberian Accents (Te'amim).\" ''Proceedings of the Ninth World Conference of Jewish Studies'', Division D, Vol. II (Jerusalem, 1986): 265–80; cf. also, e.g., the review by P.T.

Torah (general melody for the whole year) {{Audio-nohelp|Cantillation Example Torah Ashkenazi.ogg|Example}}\n**2. Torah – special melody for [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]]. One may hear the reading at [http://www.torahplace.com/free-torah-audio-downloads-cantillation/yom-kippur-reading-cantillation/]. This tune is also employed on [[Simhat Torah]] in various degrees (depending on the specific community). Echoes of it can also be heard for certain verses in the Torah reading for fast days in some communities.\n***There are a number of variants employed for special sections, such as those for the ''[[Aseret haDibrot]]'' (Ten Commandments), ''[[Song of the sea|Az Yashir]]'' (Song of the Sea), and the list of Masa'ot.\n***In all Torah modes, there is a \"[[Coda (music)|coda]]\" motif that is used for the last few words of each reading.\n***There is a special coda used at the end of each of the five books of the Torah that leads to the traditional exclamation of \"Hazak Hazak V'Nithazek!\" (Be strong, be strong so we are strengthened!).\n**3. Haftarot {{Audio-nohelp|Cantillation Example Haftarah Ashkenazi.ogg|Example}}\n***In the haftarah mode, there is also a \"coda\" motif. In the Western Ashkenazic mode, this is applied to the end of every verse. A different coda is used at the end of the haftarah among both Eastern and Western Ashkenazim, modulating from minor to major to introduce the following blessing.\n***This is also the tune that is applied when reading the non-haftarah portions of the books of the Prophets and the latter Writings (Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah, and Chronicles), although this usage is largely theoretical, as these are not subject to public reading as the other sections and books are.\n*The [[Five Megillot]] (3 melodies are employed for these five scrolls)\n**4. Esther – a mostly light and joyous tune with elements of drama and foreboding used for the ''Megillat Esther'' on [[Purim]]. The coda at the end of each [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|pasuk (verse)]] modulates from major to minor to produce a more serious effect. Certain short passages pertaining to the destruction of the temple are customarily read in the tune of Lamentations. There are also additional musical customs, such as saying the word {{hebrew|סוס}} ([[horse]]) with a [[wiktionary:neigh|neighing]] sound, not indicated by the cantillation.\n**5. Lamentations – a mournful tune.  Echoes of it can also be heard for certain verses in Esther and in the Torah reading preceding the [[Ninth of Av]]. The Haftarot preceding and during the [[Ninth of Av]] also use this melody, when read in non-Hasidic shuls. {{Audio-nohelp|Cantillation Example Lamentations Ashkenazi.ogg|Example}}\n**6. The three remaining scrolls are publicly read within Ashkenazic communities during the [[three pilgrimage festivals]]. All are read in the same melody, which may be considered the \"general\" melody for the ''megillot'': the [[Song of Songs]] on [[Passover]]; [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]] on [[Shavuot]]; [[Ecclesiastes]] on [[Sukkot]].\n\nThe Ashkenazic tradition preserves no melody for the special cantillation notes of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job, which were not publicly read in the synagogue by European Jews. However, the [[Ashkenazic]] [[yeshiva]] known as [[Yeshivat Aderet Eliyahu|Aderet Eliyahu]], or (more informally) ''Zilberman's'', in the Old City of Jerusalem, uses an adaptation of the Syrian cantillation-melody for these books, and this is becoming more popular among other Ashkenazim as well.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Sephardic and Eastern melodies===\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century there was a single Ottoman-Sephardic tradition (no doubt with local variations) covering Turkey, Syria, Palestine and Egypt.<ref>The tables in the 1905 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] article on cantillation sets out a single melody for \"Syria and Egypt\".</ref>  Today the Jerusalem-Sephardic, Syrian, Egyptian and Baghdadi melodies recognisably belong to a single family.  For example, in these traditions the Torah reading is always or almost always in [[Weekly Maqam#Maqam Sigah|Maqam Sigah]].  There are some variations, among individual readers as well as among communities: for example the Egyptian melody is related to the more elaborate and cantorial form of the Syrian melody and was transitioning toward Maqam Huzzam before the mass expulsion in 1950.  The [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] tradition, being based on the Egyptian, also forms part of this group.<ref>http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/Liturgy/Cantillation.shtml and recordings by Moshe Dabbah on http://pizmonim.org/.</ref>\n\nAnother recognisable family consists of the Iraqi (Mosul and Iraqi diaspora), Spanish-Moroccan and Spanish and Portuguese melodies.  The probable reason for the occurrence of similar melodies at opposite ends of the Arab world is that they represent the remains of an old Arab-Jewish tradition not overlaid by the later Ottoman-Sephardic tradition that spread to the countries in between.  There may also have been some convergence between the London Spanish and Portuguese and Iraqi melodies during [[British Raj|British rule in India]] and the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]].\n\nThe Jews of North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Yemen all had local musical traditions for cantillation.  When these Jewish communities emigrated (mostly to Israel) during the twentieth century, they brought their musical traditions with them.  But as the immigrants themselves grew older, many particular national melodies began to be forgotten, or to become assimilated into the \"Jerusalem Sephardic\" melting-pot.\n\nAs with the Ashkenazim, there is one tune for Torah readings and a different tune for haftarot.  Spanish and Portuguese Jews have a special tune for the Ten Commandments when read according to the ''ta'am elyon'', known as \"High Na'um\", which is also used for some other words and passages which it is desired to emphasize.<ref>These are listed in Rodrigues Pereira,'' 'Hochmat Shelomo''.</ref>  Other communities, such as the Syrian Jews, observe the differences between the two sets of cantillation marks for the Ten Commandments but have no special melody for ''ta'am 'elyon''.<ref>Syrian Jews have a tradition of prolonging ''tarcha'' (''tifcha'') in certain verses, largely coinciding with those which Spanish and Portuguese Jews recite in High Na'um. For details, see the http://www.pizmonim.org website, under the tab \"Torah readings\".</ref>  There is no special tune for Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in any Sephardic tradition.  As with Ashkenazim, the normal musical value of cantillation signs is replaced by a \"coda\" motif at the end of each Torah reading and of each haftarah verse (though there is no special coda for the end of the haftarah), suggesting a common origin for the Sephardi and Ashkenazi chants.\n\nEastern Jewish communities have no liturgical tradition of reading Ecclesiastes, and there is no public liturgical reading of Song of Songs on Passover, though brief extracts may be read after the morning service during the first half of Nisan.  (Individuals may read it after the Passover Seder, and many communities recite it every Friday night.)  There are specialized tunes for Song of Songs, Ruth, Esther and Lamentations.  The prose passages at the beginning and end of the book of Job may be read either to the tune of Song of Songs or to that of Ruth, depending on the community.  The Ruth tune is generally the \"default\" tune for any book of the [[Ketuvim]] (Hagiographa) that does not have a tune of its own.\n\nUnlike the Ashkenazic tradition, the eastern traditions, in particular that of the Syrian Jews, include melodies for the special cantillation of Psalms, Proverbs and the poetic parts of Job.  In many eastern communities, Proverbs is read on the six Sabbaths between [[Passover]] and [[Shavuot]], Job on the [[Tisha B'Av|Ninth of Av]], and Psalms are read on a great many occasions.  The cantillation melody for Psalms can also vary depending on the occasion.  The [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] have no tradition for the rendering of the Psalms according to the cantillation marks, but the melody used for several psalms in the evening service is noticeably similar to that of Syrian psalm cantillation, and may represent the remnants of such a tradition.\n\n===Yemenite melodies===\nYemenite cantillation has a total of eight distinctive motifs, falling within four main patterns:\n*''molikh'' ('moving') used for the conjunctives and some minor disjunctives\n*''mafsik'' ('pausing') for most third level disjunctives\n*''ma'amid'' ('elongating') for most second level disjunctives; and\n*the patterns of ''etnaḥa'' and ''silluq'' (''sof pasuk'').\n\nThis is true equally of the system used for the Torah and the systems used for the other books. It appears to be a relic of the [[#Babylonian system|Babylonian system]], which also recognised only eight types of disjunctive and no conjunctives.\n\n===Learning melodies===\n\nSome communities had a simplified melody for the Torah, used in teaching it to children, as distinct from the mode used in synagogue.  (This should not be confused with the ''lernen steiger'' used for studying the Mishnah and Talmud.)  For example, the Yemenite community teaches a simplified melody for children, to be used both in school and when they are called to read the sixth aliyah.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://yemenite.org/shishi/shishi.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 25, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423044424/http://yemenite.org/shishi/shishi.htm |archive-date=April 23, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The simplified melody is also used for the reading of the [[Targum]], which is generally performed by a young boy.\n\nConversely, the [[Syrian Jews|Syrian]] community knows two types of Torah cantillation, a simpler one for general use and a more elaborate one used by professional [[hazzan]]im.  It is probable that the simpler melody was originally a teaching mode.  Today however it is the mode in general use, and is also an ancestor of the \"Jerusalem-Sephardic\" melody.\n\nSome communities had a simplified melody for the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], distinct from that used in reading the [[Haftarah]]: the distinction is mentioned in one medieval Sephardic source.<ref>The article on \"Cantillation\" in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] shows tunes for \"Prophets (other readings)\" for both the Western Sephardi and the Baghdadi traditions.</ref>\n\n==Names and shapes of the te'amim==\n\n===Names in different traditions===\n\nThe following table shows the names of the te'amim in the Ashkenazi, Sephardi, and Italian traditions together with their [[Unicode]] symbols.

symbols themselves.  These tables are often printed at the end of a [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (Hebrew [[Pentateuch]]).\n\nThe order of recitation bears some relation to the groups in which the signs are likely to occur in a typical Biblical verse, but differs in detail between different communities. Below are traditional Ashkenazi and Sephardi orders, though variations are found in both communities.\n\n====Ashkenazic====\n[[File:TAMI MIKRA ASHKENAZ.svg|center|thumb|580px]]\n\n====Sephardic====\n[[File:TAMI MIKRA MIZRAH.png|center|thumb|580px]]<!-- The sign for sof passuk, two vertical diamond-like marks, is missing at the end of the above graphic. -->\n\n===Meanings of the names===\n;Azla:\"Going away\", because it is often the end of the phrase 'Qadma ve'Azla'.\n;Darga:\"Trill\" from its sound, or \"step\" from its shape.\n;Etnachta/Atnach:\"Pause, rest\" because it is the pause in the middle of a verse.\n;[[Geresh]]:\"Expulsion, driving out\".  So called because it is often \"partnered\" with the Qadma (as an Azla) but here appears on its own, \"separated.\"\n;[[Gershayim]]:Double Geresh, from its appearance.\n;Mahpach:\"Turning round\".  In old manuscripts, it was written like a U on its side, hence like someone doing a U turn.  In printed books, it has a V shape, possibly because that was easier for the early printers to make.  In Eastern communities it is called ''shofar mehuppach'', \"reversed horn\", because it faces the other way from ''shofar holech'' (''munach'')\n;Mercha:\"Lengthener\", because it prolongs the melody of the word that follows.  In modern usage it sometimes means \"comma\", but this usage is taken from the cantillation sign.\n;[[Mercha kefula|Mercha-kefulah]]:Kefulah means \"double\", because it looks like two merchas together.  There are only five in the whole Torah: Gen. 27:25, Ex. 5:15, Lev. 10:1, Num. 14:3, Num. 32:42.\n;[[Munach]]:\"Resting\", because the shape is a horn lying on its side. (In Eastern communities it is called ''shofar holech'', horn going forward.)  ''Munach legarmeh'' (''munach'' on its own) is a disjunctive, used mainly before ''revia'', but occasionally before a pazer.  It may be distinguished from ordinary ''munach'' by the dividing line (''pesiq'') following the word.\n;Pashta:\"Stretching out\", because its shape is leaning forward (or in reference to a hand signal).\n;Pazer:\"Lavish\" or \"strew\", because it has so many notes.\n;Qadma:\"To progress, advance.\"  It always occurs at the beginning of a phrase (often before other conjunctives) and its shape is leaning forward.  In particular it is the first member of the ''Qadma ve-Azla'' pair.\n;Revia:\"Quarter\" or \"fourth\", probably because it splits the half verse from the start to ''etnachta'' (or ''etnachta'' to the end) into quarters (as it ranks below ''zaqef'', the main division within the half verse). Other possibilities are that it came fourth in the ''zarqa'' table (in the current Ashkenazi table it comes fifth) or that it was regarded as occupying the fourth level in the hierarchy.<ref>In the normal grammatical account it is a third-level disjunctive.  But it would become fourth level if one regarded ''etnachta'' as occupying a separate level from ''sof pasuq'', or ''segol''/''shalshelet'' as on a level of their own intermediate between ''etnachta'' and ''zaqef qaton''.</ref>\n:Its apparent appropriateness to the square or diamond shape of the symbol is coincidence: in most manuscripts, it is simply a point.  \n;Segol:\"Bunch of grapes\" (from its shape, which looks like a bunch of grapes).\n;[[Shalshelet]]:\"Chain\", either from its appearance or because it is a long chain of notes.  There are only four in the whole Torah: Gen. 19:16, 24:12, 39:8; Lev. 8:23.\n;[[Sof Passuk|Sof Pasuk]]:\"End of verse\": it is the last note of every verse.  It is sometimes called ''silluq'' (taking leave).\n;Telisha Qetannah/Gedolah:\"Detached\" because they are never linked to the following note as one musical phrase; Qetannah = small (short); Gedolah = big (long).<ref>In the Sephardic tradition, both are equally referred to as ''talsha'' and the melodies are frequently confused.  When it is desired to refer unambiguously to ''telisha qetannah'' (the conjunctive), terms such as ''talsa'' or ''tilsa'' are used, on the analogy with the distinction between the letters ''shin'' and ''sin'' (the ''sin'' has a dot on the left and ''telisha qetannah'' appears on the left of the word); another term used for both accents is ''tirtzah''.  Which term is used for which accent varies among communities and even among individuals.</ref>\n;Tevir:\"Broken\", because it represents a break in reading (in some traditions there is a big jump down in pitch between the first and second notes).\n;[[Tifcha]]:\"Diagonal\", or \"hand-breadth\".  In old manuscripts, it was written as a straight diagonal line.  In printed books, it is curved, apparently to make it a mirror image of Mercha, with which it is usually paired (the two together could be regarded as forming a slur).  The name \"tifcha\" may be an allusion to a hand signal.<ref>In Sephardic and Oriental communities it is called ''tarḥa'', meaning \"dragging\" or \"effort\".  Hence the [[proverbial phrase]] \"after ''tarḥa'', ''atnaḥ''\", after effort comes rest: see the series of puns in the poem on [http://pizmonim.org/text/PAGE%2099-II.pdf pp. 99-100, ''Shir u-Shbaḥah Hallel ve-Zimrah''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719054230/http://pizmonim.org/text/PAGE%2099-II.pdf |date=2011-07-19 }}.</ref>\n;Yetiv:\"Resting\" or \"sitting\", because it may be followed by a short pause, or more probably because the shape is like a horn sitting up.  (In the Italian tradition, it is called ''shofar yetiv'', sitting horn.)\n;Zaqef Qaton/Gadol:\"Upright\" (from their shape, or in allusion to a hand signal); Qaton = small (short); Gadol = big (long).\n;Zarqa:\"Scatterer\", because it is like a scattering of notes.\n\n''Numbers 35:5 (in Parshat Mas'ei) has two notes found nowhere else in the Torah:''\n;Qarne Farah:\"Horns of a cow\" (from its shape), sometimes called ''pazer gadol''.\n;Yerach ben Yomo:\"Moon one day old\" (because it looks like a crescent moon), sometimes called ''galgal'' (circle).\n\n==Sequences==\nThe rules governing the sequence of cantillation marks are as follows.\n#A verse is divided into two half verses, the first ending with, and governed by, ''etnachta'', and the second ending with, and governed by, ''sof pasuk''.  A very short verse may have no ''etnachta'' and be governed by ''sof pasuk'' alone.\n#A half verse may be divided into two or more phrases marked off by second-level disjunctives.\n#A second-level phrase may be divided into two or more sub-phrases marked off by third-level disjunctives.\n#A third-level phrase may be divided into two or more sub-phrases marked off by fourth-level disjunctives.\n#The last subdivision within a phrase must always be constituted by a disjunctive one level down, chosen to fit the disjunctive governing the phrase and called (in the Table below) its \"near companion\".  Thus, a disjunctive may be preceded by a disjunctive of its own or a higher level, or by its near companion, but not by any other disjunctive of a lower level than its own.\n#The other subdivisions within a phrase are constituted by the \"default\" disjunctive for the next lower level (the \"remote companion\").\n#Any disjunctive may or may not be preceded by one or more conjunctives, varying with the disjunctive in question.\n#A disjunctive constituting a phrase on its own (i.e. not preceded by either a near companion or a conjunctive) may be substituted by a stronger disjunctive of the same level, called in the Table the \"equivalent isolated disjunctive\".\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"border:2px solid #ccccff;text-align:center;\" | Main disjunctive\n|

Tarkha Maarikh Sof Pasuk):The group that occurs at the end of each ''pasuk'' (verse), and always includes the Sof-Pasuk at the very minimum. Either or both of the Mercha's may be omitted.\n;(Mercha) Tifcha (Munach) Etnachta (Sephardic Maarikh Tarkha Shofar Holekh Atna):one of the most common groups, but can only appear once in each ''pasuk''. Tifcha can appear without a Mercha, but Mercha cannot appear without a Tifcha (or other following disjunctive). Etnachta can appear without a Munach, but Munach cannot appear without an Etnachta (or other following disjunctive). Munach-Etnachta can appear without a Mercha-Tifcha, but a Mercha-Tifcha cannot appear without a Munach-Etnachta (or Etnachta on its own).\n\n====Second level phrases====\n;(Mahpach) Pashta (Munach) Zaqef Qaton (Sephardic Mehuppakh Qadma Shofar Holekh Zaqef Qaton):one of the most common groups. Pashta can appear without a Mahpach, but a Mahpach cannot appear without a Pashta. Alternatively, ''Yetiv'' can appear on its own in place of Pashta. Zaqef Qaton can appear without a Munach, but a Munach cannot appear without a Qaton (or other following disjunctive).\n;Zakef Gadol:Not a part of a group, as it replaces a Zaqef Qaton sequence.\n;[Munach] Zarka [Munach] Segol (Sephardic Mehuppach Zarka Mehuppach Segolta):Zarqa is only ever found before Segol; a Munach may precede either one.\n;Shalshelet:Not a part of a group, as it replaces a Segol sequence. Occurs only four times in the Torah, and always at the beginning of a verse.<ref>http://www.divreinavon.com/pdf/Shalshelet1.pdf Symbolic Interpretation of the Shalshelet</ref>\n\n====Third level phrases====\n;Munach | Munach Revia (Sephardic Shofar Holekh | Shofar Holekh Revia):The following combinations occur: Revia on its own; Munach Revia; Darga Munach Revia; Munach-with-Pesiq Revia; Munach-with-Pesiq Munach Revia.  (Munach with Pesiq is a disjunctive, separate from Munach proper, and also known as ''Munach legarmeh'', munach on its own.)\n;Darga Tevir:Tevir is found either alone or preceded by Darga or Mercha. Darga occasionally precedes other combinations (e.g. Darga Munach Revia).\n;Mercha-Kefula (Sephardic Tere ta’ame):Occasionally preceded by Darga, but usually on its own. Occurs only five times in the Torah, and once in Haftarah. Its function appears to be similar to Tevir.\n\n====Fourth level phrases====\n;Qadma v'Azla:This pair is known as such when found together, and may precede a Mahpach, a Revia group or a Tevir group. A Qadma can also be found without an Azla before a Mahpach, and an Azla without a Qadma is known as Azla-Geresh or simply Geresh.  Gershayim on its own fulfils the same function as Qadma v'Azla, in that it can precede either a Mahpach, a Revia group or a Tevir group.\n;Pazer:Not considered part of a group, but usually followed by a Telisha Qetannah or a Telisha Gedolah. It may be preceded by one or more Munachs.\n;Telisha Qetannah/Gedolah (Sephardic Talsha/Tirtsa):Not considered a part of a group, usually appears individually, sometimes after a Pazer.  It often precedes Qadma.\n;Yerach ben Yomo Qarnei Farah:The rarest group of all. Occurs only once in the whole Torah, in the parashah Masey, on the words ''alpayim b'ammah'' (two thousand cubits). It is equivalent to Munach Pazer.\n\n==Psalms, Proverbs and Job==\nThe system of cantillation signs used throughout the [[Tanakh]] is replaced by a very different system for these three poetic books.  Many of the signs may ''appear'' the same or similar at first glance, but most of them serve entirely different functions in these three books.  (Only a few signs have functions similar to what they do in the rest of the [[Tanakh]].)  The short narratives at the beginning and end of [[Book of Job|Job]] use the \"regular\" system, but the bulk of the book (the poetry) uses the special system.  For this reason, these three books are referred to as ''sifrei emet'' (Books of Truth), the word ''emet'' meaning \"truth\", but also being an acronym for the first letters of the three books ([[Book of Job|Iyov]], [[Book of Proverbs|Mishle]], [[Book of Psalms|Tehillim]]).\n\nA verse may be divided into one, two or three stichs.  In a two-stich verse, the first stich ends with ''atnach''.  In a three-stich verse, the first stich ends with ''oleh ve-yored'', which looks like ''mahpach'' (above the word) followed by ''tifcha'', on either the same word or two consecutive words, and the second stich ends with ''atnach''.\n\nMajor disjunctives within a stich are ''revia qaton'' (immediately before ''oleh ve-yored''), ''revia gadol'' (elsewhere) and ''tzinnor'' (which looks like ''zarqa''). The first (or only) stich in a verse may be divided by ''dechi'', which looks like ''tifcha'' but goes under the first letter of the word to the right of the vowel sign. The last stich in a two- or three-stich verse may be divided by ''revia megurash'', which looks like ''geresh'' combined with ''revia''.\n\nMinor disjunctives are ''pazer gadol'', ''shalshelet gedolah'', ''azla legarmeh'' (looking like ''qadma'') and ''mehuppach legarmeh'' (looking like ''mahpach''): all of these except ''pazer'' are followed by a ''pesiq''.  ''Mehuppach'' without a ''pesiq'' sometimes occurs at the beginning of a stich.\n\nAll other accents are conjunctives.\n\n==Mishnah==\n\nSome manuscripts of early Rabbinic literature contain marks for partial or systematic cantillation. This is true of the [[Sifra]], and especially of [[Cairo Geniza|Genizah]] fragments of the [[Mishnah]].<ref>For a full study see Israel Yeivin, ''Cantillation of the Oral Law''. ''Leshonenu'' 24 (1960), pp. 47-231 (Hebrew).</ref>\n\nToday, many communities have a special tune for the Mishnaic passage \"Bammeh madliqin\" in the [[Kabbalat Shabbat|Friday night service]].  Otherwise, there is often a customary intonation used in the study of Mishnah or Talmud, somewhat similar to an Arabic [[mawwal]], but this is not reduced to a precise system like that for the Biblical books.  Recordings have been made for Israeli national archives, and Frank Alvarez-Pereyre has published a book-length study of the Syrian tradition of Mishnah reading on the basis of these recordings.\n\n==In Christian missionary uses==\n\nThe Jewish born Christian convert Ezekiel Margoliouth translated the [[New Testament]] to Hebrew in 1865 with cantillation marks added. It is the only completely cantillated translation of the New Testament. The translation was published by the [[Church's Ministry Among Jewish People|London Jews' Society]].<ref>Scanned versions of this translation can be found here [http://www.alittlehebrew.com/jorge/London%20Jews%20Society/Margoliouth%20Hebrew%20NT.pdf], here [http://jer-31.com/Margoliuth.html] and here {{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119150730/http://vineofdavid.org/remnant_repository/ezekiel_margoliouth/|title=Archived copy|accessdate=2011-10-12|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n====Grammar and masorah====\n* {{Cite GHG|15}}\n* {{Citation | editor-last = Dotan | editor-first = Aaron | title = Sefer diqduqe ha-te'amim le-rabbi Aharon Ben-Moshe Ben-Asher | publisher = Hebrew University | place = Jerusalem | year = 1979 | origyear = 1963 }}, earlier edition {{Citation | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/38509 | title = Leipzig | publisher = Hebrew books.org}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Moshe | last = ha-Naqdan | title = Darche ha-Niqqud ve-ha-neginot | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/38534 | place = Hanover | year = 1822 | origyear =1847  | publisher = Hebrew books.org}}, earlier edition {{Citation | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/24792 | title = Vilna}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Yosef | last = bar Kalonymus | editor-first = A | editor-last = Berliner | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/38690 | title = Ta'ame eme\"t baḥaruzim | place = Berlin | year = 1886 | language = Hebrew, German | origyear = 1485 | publisher = Hebrew books.org}}, a medieval poem setting out the rules for the three poetical books; original in {{Citation | title = Maḥzor of Casal Maggiore}}.\n* {{Citation | first = Judah | last = ben Bil'am | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/35317 | title = Sha'ar ta'ame sheloshah sifre eme\"t | origyear = 1556 | place = Amsterdam | year = 1859 | publisher = Hebrew books.org}}, original from Paris.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Mordechai Breuer| last = Breuer | first = Mordechai | title = Ta'amei hammiqra be-21 sefarim uvesifrei emet | place = Jerusalem | year = 1981 | language = Hebrew}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Wolf Heidenheim| last = Heidenheim | first = Wolf | url = http://hebrewbooks.org/7218 | title = Sefer Mishpete ha-Ta'amim | place = Rödelheim | year = 1808 | language = Hebrew | publisher = Hebrew books.org}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Wickes | first = William | title = A Treatise on the Accentuation of the Twenty-One so-called Prose Books of the Old Testament | place = Oxford | year = 1887}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Christian David Ginsburg| last = Ginsburg | first = Christian David | title = Introduction to the Massoretico-Critical Edition of the Hebrew Bible | publisher = Trinitarian Bible Society | year = 1897}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Paul E.

It was added to the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[orthography]] at the same time as the [[Masoretic]] system of [[niqqud]] (vowel points). It takes the form of a dot placed inside a [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letter]] and has the effect of modifying the sound in one of two ways.\n\nAn identical mark, called [[mappiq]], has a different phonetic function, and can be applied to different consonants; the same mark is also employed in the vowel [[shuruk]].\n\nDagesh and mappiq symbols are often omitted in writing. For instance, {{Hebrew|בּ}} is often written as {{Hebrew|ב}}. The use or omission of such marks is usually consistent throughout any given context. The two functions of dagesh are distinguished as either ''kal'' (light) or ''ḥazak'' (strong).\n\n== {{anchor|Dagesh Kal}}  Dagesh kal ==\nA '''''{{transl|he|dagesh kal}}''''' or '''''{{transl|he|dagesh qal}}''''' ({{hebrew|דגש קל}}, or {{hebrew|דגש קשיין}}, also \"''{{transl|he|dagesh}}'' [[lenis consonant|lene]]\", \"weak/light ''dagesh''\", opposed to \"[[#Dagesh hazak|strong dot]]\") may be placed inside the consonants {{Hebrew|ב}} ''bet'', {{hebrew|ג}} ''gimel'', {{hebrew|ד}} ''dalet'',  {{hebrew|כ}} ''kaf'', {{hebrew|פ}} ''pe'' and {{hebrew|ת}} ''tav''. They each had two sounds: the original \"hard\" ([[plosive consonant|plosive]]) sound, and a \"soft\" ([[fricative consonant|fricative]]) sound. Before the [[Babylonian captivity]], the soft sounds did not exist in Hebrew, but were added as a result of Aramaic-influenced pronunciation of Hebrew after this point in history. The letters take on their hard sounds when they have no vowel sound before them, and take their soft sounds when a vowel immediately precedes them, across word boundaries in Biblical Hebrew, but not in Modern Hebrew. When vowel diacritics are used, the hard sounds are indicated by a central dot called ''dagesh'', while the soft sounds lack a ''dagesh''.  In Modern Hebrew, however, the ''dagesh'' only changes the pronunciation of {{hebrew|ב}} ''bet'', {{hebrew|כ}} ''kaf'', and {{hebrew|פ}} ''pe'' (traditional Ashkenazic pronunciation also varies the pronunciation of {{hebrew|ת}} ''tav'', and some traditional Middle Eastern pronunciations carry alternate forms for {{hebrew|ד}} ''dalet'').\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!! colspan=5 | With dagesh\n!! colspan=5 | Without dagesh\n|-\n!! colspan=1 |Symbol\n!

The Hebrew spoken by the Jews of Yemen ([[Yemenite Hebrew]]) still preserves unique [[phonemes]] for these letters with and without a dagesh.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428054913/http://sagavyah.tripod.com:80/ALEFBET.html |title=Vocalization of Hebrew Alphabet |accessdate=2018-09-20 }}</ref></small>\n\n<nowiki>***</nowiki> The letter ''hey'' (ה) when word final is usually silent in order to indicate the presence of a word-final vowel.

However, when a non-silent word-final ''hey'' (הּ) occurs, it can take a [[furtive patach]].\n\n===Pronunciation===\nIn [[Israel]]'s general population, the pronunciation of some of the above letters has become identical to the pronunciation of others:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Letter\n! pronounced like\n!

This gemination is not adhered to in modern Hebrew and is only used in careful pronunciation, such as reading of scriptures in a synagogue service, recitations of biblical or traditional texts or on ceremonious occasions, and then only by very precise readers.\n\nThe following letters, the [[Guttural consonant|gutturals]], almost never have a dagesh: ''[[Aleph (Hebrew)|aleph]]'' א, ''[[he (letter)|he]]'' ה, ''[[heth (letter)|chet]]'' ח, ''[[ayin]]'' ע, ''[[resh]]'' ר. (A few instances of ''resh'' with dagesh are [[Masoretic Text|masoretically]] recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]], as well as a few cases of ''aleph'' with a dagesh, such as in [[Leviticus]] 23:17.)\n\nThe presence of a dagesh ḥazak or consonant-doubling in a word may be entirely morphological, or, as is often the case, is a lengthening to compensate for a deleted consonant.\n<!-- It said here: \"The following needs to be explained more in English, and with fewer foreign words!\"  Reckon this is enough now? -->\nA ''dagesh ḥazak'' may be placed in letters for one of the following reasons:\n\n* The letter follows the [[article (linguistics)|definite article]], the word \"the\". For example, {{Hebrew|שָׁמָיִם}} ''shamayim'' \"heaven(s)\" in {{bibleverse||Gen|1:8|HE}} is {{Hebrew|הַשָּׁמַיִם}} ''Ha'''shsh'''amayim'' \"the heaven(s)\" in  {{bibleverse||Gen|1:1|HE}}. This is because the definite article was originally a stand-alone particle הַל ''hal'', but at some early stage in ancient Hebrew it contracted into a prefix הַ 'ha-', and the loss of the ל 'l' was compensated for by doubling the following letter. In this situation where the following letter is a guttural, the vowel in 'ha-' becomes long to compensate for the inability to double the next letter - otherwise, this vowel is almost always short. This also happens in words taking the prefix לַ 'la-', since it is a prefix created by the contraction of לְ 'le-' + הַ 'ha-'. Occasionally, the letter following a [[He (letter)|He]] which is used to indicate a question may also receive a dagesh, e.g. {{bibleverse||Num|13:20|HE}} {{Hebrew|הַשְּׁמֵנָה הִוא}} ''Ha'''shshe'''mena hi?'' - \"whether it is fat\".\n* The letter follows the prefix מִ 'mi-' where this prefix is an abbreviation for the word ''min'', meaning \"from\".  For example, the phrase \"from your hand\", if spelled as two words, would be {{Hebrew|מִן יָדֶךָ}} ''min yadekha''. In Gen. 4:11, however, it occurs as one word: {{Hebrew|מִיָּדֶךָ}} ''mi'''yy'''adekha''. This prefix mostly replaces the usage of the particle מִן ''min'' in modern Hebrew.\n* The letter follows the prefix שֶׁ 'she-' in modern Hebrew, which is a prefixed contraction of the relative pronoun אֲשֶׁר ''asher'', where the first letter is dropped and the last letter disappears and doubles the next letter. This prefix is rare in Biblical texts, but mostly replaces the use of אֲשֶׁר ''asher'' in Modern Hebrew.\n* It marks the doubling of a letter that is caused by a weak letter losing its vowel. In these situations, the weak letter disappears, and the following letter is doubled to compensate for it. For example, compare Ex. 6:7 {{Hebrew|לָקַחְתִּי}} ''lakachti'' with  {{bibleverse||Num|23:28|HE}}, where the first letter of the root ל has been elided: {{Hebrew|וַיִּקַּח}} ''vayyi'''kk'''ach''. Lamed only behaves as a weak letter in this particular root word, but never anywhere else.\n* If the letter follows a [[waw-consecutive|''vav'' consecutive]] imperfect (sometimes referred to as ''vav'' conversive, or ''[[Waw (letter)#Words written as vav|vav ha'hipuch]]''), which, in Biblical Hebrew, switches a verb between perfect and imperfect. For example, compare Judges 7:4 {{Hebrew|יֵלֵךְ}} ''yelekh'' \"let him go\" with Deu. 31:1 {{Hebrew|וַיֵּלֶך}} ''va'''yy'''elekh'' \"he went\". A possible reason for this doubling is that the וַ 'va-' prefix could be the remains of an auxiliary verb הָוַיַ ''hawaya'' (the ancient form of the verb הָיָה ''hayah'', \"to be\") being contracted into a prefix, losing the initial 'ha', and the final 'ya' syllable disappearing and doubling the next letter.\n* In some of the ''[[binyan]]'' verbal stems, where the Piel, Pual and Hitpa'el stems themselves cause doubling in the second root letter of a verb. For example:\n** Ex. 15:9 {{Hebrew|אֲחַלֵּק}} ''acha'''ll'''ek'' \"I shall divide\", Piel Stem, first person future tense \n** in the phrase הָלֵּלוּ יַהּ ''hallelu yah'' \"praise the LORD\", where ''hallelu'' is in Piel Stem, masculine plural Imperative form\n** Gen. 47:31 {{Hebrew|וַיִּתְחַזֵּק}} ''vayyitcha'''zz'''ek'', \"he strengthened himself\", Hitpael stem\n\n== Rafe ==\nIn Masoretic manuscripts the opposite of a ''dagesh'' would be indicated by a ''[[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]]'', a small line on top of the letter.  This is no longer found in Hebrew, but may still sometimes be seen in [[Yiddish]] and [[Ladino language|Ladino]].\n<!--\n==Pronunciation of modern Israeli Hebrew==\n{{Further|[[Hebrew language]]}}\n\nBelow is a complete list of Hebrew letters which may take a dagesh, and their pronunciation as consonants in modern Israeli Hebrew:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is part of the [[Masoretes]]' system of [[niqqud]] (vowel points), and was added to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[orthography]] at the same time. It takes the form of a dot in the middle of a letter (usually {{Hebrew|ה}}, ''[[He (letter)|he]]''). An identical point with a different phonetic function (marking different consonants) is called a [[dagesh]].\n\n[[File:Mapiq.png]]\n\nThe ''mappiq'' is used to mark the letter {{Hebrew|ה}} (''[[He (letter)|he]]'') (and rarely ''[[aleph]]''), indicating that it is to be pronounced as a consonant, although in a position where the letter usually indicates a vowel.\n\nBefore the vowel points were invented, some consonants were used to indicate vowel sounds. These consonants are called ''[[matres lectionis]]''. The letter ''he'' (transliterated ''H'') at the end of a word (Hebrew is written from right to left) can indicate the vowel sound ''a'' or ''e''. When it does, it is not acting as a consonant, and therefore in pure phonetic logic the Biblical name Zechariah (among others) should be spelled \"Zekharya\" without the final \"h\".  However, silent final h being also a feature of English, it is usually retained in Hebrew transliterations to distinguish final ''he'' from final ''aleph''.\n\nThe divine name [[Jah|Yah]] has a mappiq (a dot inside the last letter), so the last letter shall not be read as a vowel ''a'', but as the consonant ''H'' - and therefore Yah (and not Ya).\n\nThe most common occurrence of ''mappiq'' is in the suffix \"-ah\", meaning \"her\".\n\nA ''he'' with ''mappiq'' is meant to be pronounced as a full consonant \"h\", and in [[Mizrahi Hebrew|Mizrahi]] and [[Yemenite Hebrew]] it is pronounced more strongly than a normal ''he'', sometimes with a slight following ''[[schwa|shwa]]'' sound (this rule is also followed by Dutch Sephardim).  In modern Hebrew, however, it is normally silent; although it is still pronounced in religious contexts by careful readers of the [[Jewish prayer|prayers]] and scriptures.\n\n== Rafe ==\n\nIn Masoretic manuscripts the opposite of a ''mappiq'' would be indicated by a ''[[rafe (diacritic)|rafe]]'', a small line on top of the letter.  This is no longer found in Hebrew.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hebrew alphabet]]\n* [[Biblical Hebrew phonology|Hebrew phonology]]\n* [[Mater lectionis]]\n* [[Rafe]]\n\n{{Hebrew language}}\n\n[[Category:Niqqud]]\n[[Category:Hebrew grammar]]\n[[Category:Hebrew diacritics]]"

Several such diacritical systems were developed in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. The most widespread system, and the only one still used to a significant degree today, was created by the [[Masoretes]] of [[Tiberias]] in the second half of the first millennium AD in the [[Land of Israel]] (see [[Masoretic Text]], [[Tiberian Hebrew]]). Text written with niqqud is called ''[[ktiv menuqad]]''.\n\nNiqqud marks are small compared to the letters, so they can be added without retranscribing texts whose writers did not anticipate them.\n\nIn modern Israeli orthography ''niqqud'' is seldom used, except in specialised texts such as dictionaries, poetry, or texts for children or for new immigrants. For purposes of disambiguation, a system of spelling without niqqud, known in Hebrew as ''[[Ktiv hasar niqqud|ktiv maleh]]'' ({{hebrew|כְּתִיב מָלֵא}}, literally \"full spelling\") has developed. This was formally standardised in the ''Rules for Spelling without Niqqud'' ({{hebrew|כְּלָלִי הַכְּתִיב חֶסֶר הַנִּקּוּד}})  enacted by the\n[[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]  in 1996,<ref>[http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision4.html ''Rules for Spelling without Niqqud''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227051707/http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/decision4.html |date=2009-02-27 }}</ref> and updated in 2017.<ref>[http://hebrew-academy.org.il/topic/hahlatot/missingvocalizationspelling/ ''Rules for Spelling without Niqqud'' (Hebrew, with 2017 updates)]</ref>\n\nOne reason for the lesser use of niqqud is that it no longer reflects the current pronunciation. In [[modern Hebrew]], [[tzere]] is pronounced the same as [[segol]], although they were distinct in [[Tiberian Hebrew]], and also [[pataḥ]] makes the same sound as a [[qamatz]]. To the younger generation of native Hebrew speakers, these distinctions seem arbitrary and meaningless; on the other hand, Hebrew language purists have rejected out of hand the idea of changing the basics of niqqud and fitting them to the current pronunciation – with the result that in practice niqqud is increasingly going out of use.<ref>“Supposedly, the teachers who taught my generation knew Hebrew perfectly. They had a thorough knowledge of all the Hebrew classics as well as of modern Hebrew literature. But Hebrew was not their natural language. They had gained their knowledge of Hebrew from books, by tremendous effort. And they subjected us, who grew up with Hebrew as out mother tongue, to a terrible torture. They demanded that we master perfectly all the niceties and nuances of a language purism which meant nothing to us. I remember when I was asked to write words with nikkud on the blackboard and made a hash of it, the teacher said “You are a total ignoramus”. Ze’ev Galili’s Blog, December 31, 2004 [http://www.zeevgalili.com/2004/12/376]\n</ref>\n\n==Demonstration==\nThis table uses the consonant letters '''{{Hebrew|ב}}''', '''{{Hebrew|ח}}''' or '''{{Hebrew|ש}}''', where appropriate, to demonstrate where the niqqud is placed in relation to the consonant it is pronounced ''after''. Any other letters shown are actually part of the vowel. Note that there is some variation among different traditions in exactly how some vowel points are pronounced. The table below shows how most [[Israelis]] would pronounce them, but the classic [[Ashkenazi]] pronunciation, for example, differs in several respects.\n\n{{hatnote|1=This demonstration is known to work in [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Mozilla]] [[web browser|browsers]] in at least some circumstances, but in most other [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] browsers the niqqud do not properly combine with the consonants. It works very well when \"dir=rtl\" is added in the HTML source. This is because, currently, the Windows text display engine does not combine the niqqud automatically. Except as noted, the vowel pointings should appear directly beneath the letters and the accompanying \"vowel letter\" for the mālê (long) forms appear after.}}\n\n{{hatnote|Note concerning [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: the transcription symbols are linked to the articles about the sounds they represent. The [[diacritic]]<big>&nbsp;˘&nbsp;</big>([[breve]]) indicates a [[Length (phonetics)|short vowel]]; the [[Colon (punctuation)#Diacritical usage|triangular colon]]

An example in English is the vowel sound of the 'a' in the word ''about''. Schwa in English is mainly found in [[unstressed vowel|unstressed]] positions, but in some other languages it occurs more frequently as a stressed vowel.\n\nIn relation to certain languages, the name \"schwa\" and the symbol {{IPA|ə}} may be used for some other [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] and [[tone (linguistics)|toneless]] '''neutral vowel''', not necessarily mid-central.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''schwa'' is from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word ''{{transl|he|shva}}'' ({{lang|he|שְׁוָא}}&nbsp; {{IPA-he|ʃva|IPA}}, <small>classical pronunciation:</small> ''{{transl|he|shəwāʼ}}''&nbsp; {{IPA-he|ʃəˑwɒːʔ|}}), designating the Hebrew [[niqqud]] vowel sign [[shva]] (two vertical dots written beneath a letter): in [[Modern Hebrew]], it indicates either the [[phoneme]] {{IPAslink|e̞|e}} or the complete [[zero (linguistics)|absence]] of a vowel. (The Hebrew shva is also sometimes [[transliteration|transliterated]] using the schwa symbol [[ə]], even if this pronunciation is found neither in [[shva#Pronunciation in Modern Hebrew|Modern Hebrew]] nor in [[Tiberian vocalization#mobile shwa|Tiberian vocalization]].{{cn| date= August 2018}})\n\nThe term was introduced by German linguists in the 19th century, and so the spelling ''sch'' is [[German language|German]] in origin. It was first used in English texts between 1890 and 1895.<ref>{{Dictionary.com|schwa}}</ref><ref>{{OEtymD|schwa}}</ref>\n\nThe symbol {{angle bracket|ə}} was used first by [[Johann Andreas Schmeller]] for the reduced vowel at the end of the German name ''Gabe''. [[Alexander John Ellis]], in his ''palæotype alphabet'', used it for the similar English sound in ''but'' {{IPAc-en|b|V|t}}.\n\n==Description==\n{{Main|Epenthesis|Unstressed vowel|Vowel reduction}}\nSometimes the term \"schwa\" is used for any [[epenthesis|epenthetic vowel]], but some languages use different epenthetic vowels ([[Navajo language|Navajo]] uses {{IPA|[i]}}).\n\nIn [[English language|English]], schwa is the most common [[vowel]] sound.<ref>Rachael-Anne Knight(2012), Phonetics: A course book, Cambridge University Press, p.71.</ref> It is a [[reduced vowel]] in many unstressed [[syllable]]s especially if [[syllabic consonant]]s are not used. Depending on dialect, it may be written using any of the following letters:\n\n*'a', as in ''about'' {{IPA|[əˈbaʊt]}}\n*'e', as in ''taken'' {{IPA|[ˈtʰeɪkən]}}\n*'i', as in ''pencil'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰɛnsəl]}}\n*'o', as in ''memory'' {{IPA|[ˈmɛməri]}}\n*'u', as in ''supply'' {{IPA|[səˈplaɪ]}}\n*'y', as in ''sibyl'' {{IPA|[ˈsɪbəl]}}\n*unwritten, as in ''rhythm'' {{IPA|[ˈɹɪðəm]}}\n\nSchwa is a very [[vowel length|short]] neutral vowel sound, and like all other vowels, its precise quality varies depending on the adjacent [[consonants]]. In most varieties of English, schwa occurs almost exclusively in unstressed syllables. (There is also an [[open-mid central unrounded vowel]] or \"long schwa\", represented as {{IPA|ɜː}}, which occurs in some [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]] dialect stressed syllables, as in ''bird'' and ''alert''.)\n\nIn [[New Zealand English]], the high front lax vowel (as in the word ''bit'' {{IPAc-en|'|b|I|t}}) has [[Vowel shift|shifted]] open and back to sound like schwa, and both stressed and unstressed schwas exist. To a certain extent, that is true for [[South African English]] as well.\n\nIn [[General American]], schwa and {{IPA|/ɜː/}} are the two vowel sounds that can be [[r-colored vowel|r-colored]] (rhotacized); r-colored schwa is used in words with unstressed \"er\" syllables, such as ''dinner''. See also [[stress and vowel reduction in English]].\n\n[[Welsh language|Welsh]] uses the letter {{angle bracket|y}} to represent schwa, which is a phonemic vowel rather than the realisation of an unstressed vowel. The letter {{angle bracket|y}} represents schwa in all positions except in final syllables where it represents {{IPA|/ɪ/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}. For example, the word ''ysbyty'' (\"hospital\") is pronounced {{IPA|/əsˈbəti/}}.\n\nQuite a few languages have a sound similar to schwa. It is similar to a short [[French language|French]] unaccented {{angle bracket|e}}, which is rounded and less central, more like an [[open-mid front rounded vowel|open-mid]] or [[close-mid front rounded vowel]]. It is almost always unstressed, but [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] are some of the languages that allow stressed schwas.\n\nIn most dialects of [[Russian language|Russian]] an unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} or {{angle bracket|o}} reduces to a schwa. In dialects of [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]] a schwa occurs in place of the [[Old Polish language|Old Polish]] short consonants ''u, i, y''.<ref>{{cite book | last1= Breza | first1= Edward | last2= Treder | first2= Jerzy | title= Gramatyka kaszubska | year=1981 | publisher= Zrzeszenie Kaszubsko-Pomorskie | location= Gdańsk | isbn= 83-00-00102-6 | page=16}}</ref>\n\nMany [[Caucasian languages]] and some [[Uralic languages]] (like [[Komi language|Komi]]) also use phonemic schwa, and allow schwas to be stressed. In the Eastern dialects of [[Catalan language|Catalan]], including the standard variety, based in the dialect spoken in and around [[Barcelona]], an unstressed {{angle bracket|a}} or {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced as a schwa (called ''\"vocal neutra\"'', 'neutral vowel'). A stressed schwa can occur in the Catalan dialects spoken in the [[Balearic Islands]], as well as in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], as in ''mătură'' {{IPA|[ˈməturə]}} ('broom').\n\nIn [[Europe]]an and some [[Africa]]n dialects of [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the schwa occurs in many unstressed syllables that end in {{angle bracket|e}}, such as ''noite'' ('night'), ''tarde'' ('afternoon'), ''pêssego'' ('peach'), and ''pecado'' ('sin'). However, that is rare in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] except in such areas as [[Curitiba]] in [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]{{cn| date= October 2018}}).\n\nIn [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]], a final, unstressed {{angle bracket|a}}, and unstressed {{angle bracket|e}} and {{angle bracket|o}} are pronounced as a schwa: ''pìzza'' ('pizza'), ''semmàna'' ('week'), '' purtuàllo'' ('orange').\n\nThe inherent vowel in the [[Devanagari]] script, an [[abugida]] used to write [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Sanskrit]] is a schwa, written {{angle bracket|अ}} either in isolation or word-initially.\n\nOther characters used to represent this sound include {{angle bracket|ը}} in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], {{angle bracket|ă}} in Romanian, and {{angle bracket|ë}} in Albanian. In Bulgarian [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], the letter {{angle bracket|[[yer|ъ]]}}, which has a very different orthographic function in Modern Russian, is used.\n\nIn languages such as [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] there is no such sound that would resemble the \"schwa\" characteristics.\n\nIn [[Korean language|Korean]], the letter (or rather [[Hangul#jamo|jamo]]) is used, but it may also represent a \"null\" vowel used in the transcription of foreign consonant clusters, when it may be deleted. In most Sanskrit-based languages, the schwa {{angle bracket|[[devanagari|अ]]}} is the implied vowel after every consonant and so has no didactic marks. For example, in Hindi, the character क is pronounced \"kə\" without marking, but के is pronounced \"ke\" (pronounced \"kay\") with a marking.\n\nA subscript small schwa (ₔ) is used in [[Indo-European studies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2004/04191-n2788-laryngeals.pdf|title=L2/04-191: Proposal to encode six Indo-Europeanist phonetic characters in the UCS|date=2004-06-07|first1=Deborah|last1=Anderson|first2=Michael|last2=Everson}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n===Albanian===\nIn Albanian, schwa is represented by the letter {{angle bracket|[[ë]]}}, which is also one of the letters of the [[Albanian alphabet]], coming right after the letter {{angle bracket|[[e]]}}. It can be stressed like in words ''i ëmbël'' {{IPA|/i əmbəl/}} and ''ëndërr'' {{IPA|/əndər/}} ('sweet' and 'dream', respectively).\n\n===Armenian===\nIn Armenian, schwa is represented by the letter '''ը''' (capital '''Ը'''). It is occasionally word-initial but usually word-final, as a form of the definite article. Unwritten schwa sounds are also inserted to split initial consonant clusters; for example, ճնճղուկ (''čnčłuk'') [tʃʼəntʃʼə'ʁuk] 'sparrow'.\n\n===Azerbaijani===\nIn the [[Azerbaijani alphabet]], the schwa character '''ə''' is used, but to represent the '''[[Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel|æ]]''' sound.\n\n===Catalan===\nIn Catalan, schwa is represented by the letters '''a''' or '''e''' in unstressed vowels: \"par'''e'''\" {{IPA|/ˈpaɾ'''ə'''/}} (''father''), \"B'''a'''rc'''e'''lon'''a'''\" {{IPA|/bəɾsəˈlonə/}}. In the Balearic Islands, the sound is sometimes also in stressed vowels, \"p'''e'''r'''a'''\" {{IPA|/ˈpəɾə/}} (''pear'').\n\n===Dutch===\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the digraph {{angle bracket|ij}} in the suffix ''-lijk'' {{IPA-nl|lək|}}, as in ''waarschijnlijk'' {{IPA-nl|ʋaːrˈsxɛinlək|}} ('probably') is pronounced as a schwa. If an {{angle bracket|e}} falls at the ultimate (or penultimate) place before a consonant in Dutch words and is unstressed, it becomes a schwa, as in the verb ending \"-en\" (''lopen'') and the diminutive suffix \"-tje(s)\" (''tafeltje(s)'').\n\n===Romanian===\nIn Romanian, schwa is represented by letter [[Ă]], [[ă]], and it is a letter on its own (the second in the [[Romanian alphabet]]). It can be stressed in words in which it is the only vowel such as \"păr\" {{IPA|/pər/}} (''hair'' or ''pear tree'') or \"văd\" {{IPA|/vəd/}} (''I see''). Some words, which also contain other vowels, can have the stress on '''ă''': \"cărțile\" {{IPA|/ˈkərt͡sile/}} (''the books'') and \"odăi\" {{IPA|/oˈdəj/}} (''rooms'').\n\n===Malay===\nIn the [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variant, schwa is always unstressed except for [[Jakarta]]-influenced informal Indonesian whose schwa can be stressed. In final closed syllables in the formal register, the vowel is ''a'' (the final syllable is usually the second syllable since most Indonesian root words consist of two syllables). In some cases, the vowel ''a'' is pronounced as a stressed schwa (only when the vowel ''a'' is located between two consonants in a syllable), but never in formal speech:\n\n*datang (=come), pronounced {{IPA|[dɑːˈtʌŋ]}}, and often written as ''dateng'' in informal writing.\n*kental (=viscous), pronounced {{IPA|[kənˈtʌl]}}.\n*hitam (=black), pronounced {{IPA|[hiˈtʌm]}}, written as ''item'' in informal language.\n*dalam (=deep, in), pronounced {{IPA|[dɑːˈlʌm]}}, often written as ''dalem''.\n*malam (=night), pronounced {{IPA|[mʌˈlʌm]}}, written as ''malem'' in informal language.\n\nIndonesian orthography formerly used unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} only for the schwa sound, and the full vowel /e/ was written {{angle bracket|é}}. Malaysian orthography, on the other hand, formerly indicated the schwa with {{angle bracket|ĕ}} (called ''pĕpĕt''), and unmarked {{angle bracket|e}} stood for /e/.\n\nIn the 1972 spelling reform that unified Indonesian and Malaysian spelling conventions (''[[Differences between Malay and Indonesian#Orthography|Ejaan yang Disempurnakan]]'', regulated by [[Majlis Bahasa Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia|MABBIM]]), it was agreed to use neither diacritic.<ref>Asmah Haji Omar, {{cite journal |year=1989 |title=The Malay Spelling Reform |journal=Journal of the Simplified Spelling Society |issue=2 |pages=9–13 |url=http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706054017/http://www.spellingsociety.org/journals/j11/malay.php |archivedate=2010-07-06 |df= }}</ref> There is no longer an orthographic distinction between /ə/ and /e/; both are spelled with an unmarked {{angle bracket|e}}. This means that the pronunciation of any given letter ''e'' in both Indonesian and Malaysian variants is not immediately obvious to the learner and must be learned separately. However, in a number of Indonesian dictionaries and lesson books for foreign learners, the notation is preserved to help learners. For example, the word for 'wheeled vehicle' in Indonesia and Malaysia, which was formerly spelled ''keréta'' in Indonesia and ''kĕreta'' in Malaysia, is now spelled ''kereta'' in both countries.\n\nIn Southern Malaysian pronunciation, which is predominant in common Malaysian media, the final letter -''a'' represents schwa, and final ''-ah'' stands for  /a/. The dialect of [[Kedah]] in northern Malaysia, however, pronounces final -''a'' as /a/ also. In loanwords, a nonfinal short /a/ may become schwa in Malay such as ''Mekah'' (<Arabic ''[[Mecca|Makkah]]'', Malay pronunciation {{IPA|[ˈməkah]}}).\n\n===Welsh===\nThe schwa is denoted in Welsh by the letter 'y'. It is a very common letter as 'y' is the definite article with 'yr' being the definite article if the following word starts with a vowel.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n==Schwa syncope==\n{{main|Syncope (phonology)}}In phonology, [[Syncope (phonology)|syncope]] is the process of deleting unstressed sounds, particularly unstressed vowels.

The phonetics of the typical reflexes make five vowels easy to arrange in a common system (\"the Latin five\"): ''i e a o u''.\n\nHowever, a sixth correspondence set is not so simple, ''ə'' in Indo-European languages (if it survives at all; in medial syllables, it is lost in Baltic and Slavic and reflected as ''u'', in Germanic, if it is not lost; in Indic, the reflex is ''i'', and in Iranian, the vowel is lost):\n\n(1) Gothic ''fadar'' \"father\", Latin ''pater'', Greek ''patḗr'', Old Irish ''athair'' /ˈaθirʲ/, but Vedic ''pitár-'', Avestan ''pta, ta'' nominative singular (the form ''pita'' scans as a monosyllable and is presumably an orthographic artifact). \n(2) Gothic ''dauhtar'' (Old High German ''tohter'' and similar old Germanic forms), Old Church Slavic ''dŭšti'', Lithuanian ''duktė'', Vedic ''duhitár-'', Avestan ''duγðar'' but Greek ''thugátēr''.\n\nThe obvious slots were all taken by five short vowel reconstructions with strong phonetic claims, and the etymon for the sixth vowel was put into the most available space, phonetically speaking: not high, not low, not front, not back, not rounded: *''ə'' \"schwa\".\n\nThat was not such a bad guess: in Indic, there are [[prop vowel]]s for otherwise impossible final consonant sequences, and they too become Vedic ''i'': Vedic ''hā́rdi'' nominative singular \"heart\". The original Indo-European paradigm was based on a neuter root-noun *''ḱerd-/*ǵherd-'' whose endingless nominative singular, pre-Indo-European ''**ḱerd, **ǵherd'' had become Proto-Indo-European ''*ḱēr, *ǵhēr'' by simplification of the final cluster with compensatory lengthening of the vowel: Greek ''kêr'', Hittite HEART-''er''; in Indic, the root-final *''d'' was restored in the nominative singular, based on all the other cases but at a cost: a word-final cluster /rd/ is phonologically impossible in Indic, a problem resolved by a prop vowel. Any vowel would have done the job, but a neutral vowel is a usual choice: Proto-Indo-Iranian *''źhārd-ə'' from which, by regular sound laws, ''hā́rdi''. Another example is Vedic ''ákṣi'' nominative singular neuter \"eye\" from *''akṣ'' (oblique stem ''akṣṇ-''), root *''okʷ'' (*''H₃ekʷ'').\n\nThis ''schwa primum indogermanicum'' was, however, always slightly odd. Seemingly independent occurrences, as in the \"father\" words, were rare. More commonly, *ə alternated with long vowels, in a clearly patterned system, parallel to the alternation between a short vowel and zero: the root *''sed'' \"sit\" has forms as such in Sanskrit (''sadati'' \"is sitting\"), but the reduplicated present, ''sīdati'' \"sits down\" reflects *''si-sd-'' with zero grade of the root: the vowel has dropped. Compare the Indic root ''sthā'' \"stand\", with such forms as ''ásthāt'' aorist \"he stood\", but the participle, where the root vowel should drop, is ''sthi-tá-'' \"stood\" with ''-i-'' from schwa.\n\nEventually, ''schwa indogermanicum'' was radically reinterpreted as the reflex of the syllabic \"laryngeals\" (consonants), and what is now known as the laryngeal theory was developing into its current form. It then was often referred to as the \"theory of consonantal schwa\".\n\nThere is also a ''schwa secundum'' (usually, the ''indogermanicum'' is unsaid), which is some kind of reduced state of an originally short vowel. The reconstruction or reconstructions (two different schwas are commonly deployed) of 6 is only a stopgap. Its supposed reflexes are various and unpredictable, and the occurrence of the vowels has no morphological anchor, unlike the whole rest of the ablaut (vowel alternation) system. In terms of linguistic reconstruction, therefore, it has no explanatory value, being a case of putting the rabbit into the hat for the purpose of taking it back out again. In more technical terms, a ''schwa secundum'' in a reconstruction is actually a case of removing an attested mystery into the protolanguage and replacing one mystery by another. Most cases of ''schwa secundum'' are not really problems at all, being ordinary cases of levelling, or the phenomena have other and better explanations. For example, the occurrence of ''-u-'' in Greek for expected ''-o-'', as in ''núx'' \"night\" and ''phúllon'' \"leaf\" (cf. Latin ''nox, folium'') seems to be regular when the expected ''o'' is between a labial and a resonant consonant (''núx'' reflects *''nokʷt-s'').\n\nThe Indo-European kinship terms built to a suffix that looks like *''-ter-'', \"father, mother, brother, daughter,\" and \"husband's brother's wife\" (Sanskrit ''yātar-''), may actually be formed with a suffix *''-əter-'', i.e. ''-h₂ter-''. That is, *''pəter-'' is morphologically *''p-h̥₂ter-'', and the subscript ring means \"syllabic\", *''māter-'' \"mother\" is actually *''ma-h₂ter-'' etc.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{wiktionary-inline}}\n*{{cite web |url=http://www.vanoostendorp.nl/fonologie/schwaip.htm |title=Schwa in Phonological Theory |accessdate=2008-01-29 |author=Marc van Oostendorp |year=1999}}\n\n[[Category:Vowels]]\n[[Category:Niqqud]]"

Hebrew is also referred to as [[Lashon Hakodesh]], or ''Holy Tongue''. The interchanging of Ashuri with Hebrew prompts the understanding that Ashuri, Hebrew, and Lashon Hakodesh are one and the same language.\n\n==Ktav Ashuri==\nKtav Ashuri ({{lang-he-n|כְּתָב אַשּׁוּרִי}}, ''{{transl|he|ktav ashurí}}''), or Assyrian script, is a traditional calligraphic form of the alphabet shared between [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. Over some centuries, certain ornaments were simplified or removed for use outside traditional religious calligraphy, to become the modern print form of the Hebrew alphabet, which it most closely resembles.\n\nMention of the Ashuri script first appears in rabbinic writings of the [[Mishnah|Mishnaic]] and [[Talmud]]ic periods, referring to the formal script used in certain [[Jewish]] ceremonial items, such as [[sefer Torah|sifrei Torah]], [[tefillin]], [[mezuzah|mezuzot]] and the [[Five Megillot]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/alephbet.htm|title=Judaism 101: Hebrew Alphabet|last=Rich|first=Tracey R.|date=|website=www.jewfaq.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref> Also sometimes called the \"square\" script, the term is used to distinguish the Ashuri script from the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]. \n\nThe Talmud gives two opinions for why the script is called \"Ashuri\": either because the Jews brought it back with them when they returned from exile in Assyria;<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.22a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sanhedrin 22a]</ref> or alternatively, this script was given at [[Mount Sinai|Sinai]] and then forgotten and eventually revived, and received its name because it is \"meusheret\" (beautiful/praiseworthy or authorized).<ref>[https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.22a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en Sanhedrin 22a]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Example of Ashuri Ashkenaz Alphabet on Parchment.jpg|thumb|This is a sample of the Ashuri alphabet written according to the Ashkenaz scribal custom on parchment (klaf)]]\n\n== Ritual use of the script ==\nThere are many rules concerning the proper formation of letters if the written text is to be valid for religious purposes.\n\n[[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Mizrahi]], and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] Jews each have their own calligraphic tradition regarding certain details of how each letter is formed, although the overall shape is similar.

''Stam'' is an [[Hebrew abbreviations|acronym]] denoting these writings, as indicated by the [[gershayim]] (<span style=\"font-size:large;\">[[״]]</span>) punctuation mark. One who writes such articles is called a ''[[Sofer|Sofer Stam]]''. The writing is done by means of a feather, and ink (known as ''D'yo'') onto special parchment called ''[[klaf]]''. There exist two primary traditions in respect to the formation of the letters, ''Ktav HaAshkenazi'' and ''Ktav HaSefardi'', however the differences between them are slight.\n\n==Klaf==\n{{Main|Klaf}}\n\nKlaf is the material on which a ''sofer'' writes certain Jewish liturgical and ritual documents, the kosher form of parchment or vellum. The writing material can be made of the specially prepared skin of a [[kosher animals|kosher animal]] - goat, cattle, or deer. The hide can consist of:\n* ''[[Gevil]]'' ({{Hebrew|גוויל}}), the full, un-split hide;\n* ''[[Klaf]]'' ({{Hebrew|קלף}}), the outer, hairy layer; or\n* ''[[Duchsustus]]'' ({{Hebrew|דוכסוסטוס}})\n\nOnly ''gevil'' and ''klaf'' can be used for holy writings. ''Duchsustus'' is not permitted. However, ''duchsustus'' is used for writing a [[mezuzah]].\n\n==Kulmus==\n\nThe {{lang|he-Latn|kulmus}} ({{lang|he|קולמוס}}) is the feather or reed used for the writing. The original source of the word stems from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc-Latn|[[kalamos]]}} ({{wikt-lang|grc|κᾰ́λᾰμος}}) The feathers need to be obtained from a large bird and today the feathers of turkeys are most often used for this purpose. There is some debate however, as to whether feathers need be obtained from a kosher bird species or not.\n\n==Deyo==\n\nThe special ink prepared for the writing is called ''d'yo'' ({{Hebrew|דיו}}). [[Maimonides]] wrote that the ''d'yo'' is prepared in the following way:\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4464 Religion in Israel.JPG|thumb|Ktav Stam]]\n<blockquote>One collects the vapor of oils, of tar, of wax, or the like, and kneads it together with sap from a tree and a drop of honey. It is moistened extensively, crushed until it is formed into flat cakes, dried, and then stored. When one desires to write with it, one soaks it in gallnut juice or the like and writes with it. Thus, if one attempts to rub it out, he would be able to. This is the ink with which it is most preferable to write scrolls, tefillin, and mezuzot. If however one wrote any of the three with gallnut juice or vitriol, which remains without being rubbed out, it is acceptable.<ref>[[Mishne Torah]], Laws of Tefillin 1:4</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Sirtut==\n\n''Sirtut'' ({{Hebrew|שרטוט}}) are straight lines that the ''sofer'' must, by Torah law, etch into the ''klaf''. The obligation primarily pertains to Sifrei Torah, Mezuza, and Meggila, however there are those who are similarly accustomed to placing ''sirtut'' on the ''[[Tefillin#Parchment scrolls|Arba Parshiyot]]'' for ''tefillin''. This helps the ''sofer'' write in neat straight lines.\n\n==Ketiva Lishma==\n\nEvery aspect of the process must be done ''lishma'' ({{Hebrew|לשמה}}), which is to say for its own sake with pure motives. The ''sofer'' must also be particularly concentrated upon the writing of any of the [[Names of God in Judaism#7 names|Divine Names]]. At many junctures in the process he is obligated to verbalize the fact that he is performing his action ''lishma''.\n\n==Form of the letters==\n\nThe ''[[Ashuri alphabet|K'tav Ashuri]]'' is the only permissible Hebrew script, however over the centuries in [[Jewish diaspora|Exile]] some minor variations have developed. The two primary traditions are ''Ktav HaAshkenazi'' and ''Ktav HaSefardi''.\n\n''Ketav [[Ashkenazi]]'' is split into two categories:\n* Ketav [[Shulchan Aruch#Beth Yosef|Bet Yosef]] – which is the standard Ashkenaz tradition.\n* Ketav [[Isaac Luria|HaAri]] – which is the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] tradition.\n\n''Ktav [[Sefardi]]'' (also known as ''Vellish'') – is the standard utilized by [[Mizrahi Jews]], and [[Yemenite Jews]].\n\n==Tagin==\n\n''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|Tag]]in'' (or ''taggin'') are the distinct crown like [[serifs]] affixed atop the letters. If the ''tagin'' are absent, the writing is not invalidated. According to [[Rabbi Akiva]] in the [[Talmud]], not only can one learn something from every letter in the Torah, but one can also learn something from the placement of the ''tagin''. On the letters {{Hebrew|ג, ז, ט, נ, ע, צ, ש}} there are three ''tagin'', on the letters {{Hebrew|ב, ד, ה, ח, י, ק}} there is one ''tag'', and on the letters {{Hebrew|א, ו, כ, ל, מ, ס, פ, ר, ת}} there are none.\n\n==Errors==\nSome errors are inevitable in the course of production. If the error involves a word other than a Divine Name, the mistaken letter may be removed from the scroll by scraping the letter off the scroll with a sharp object. If the Divine Name is written in error, the entire page, if written in a Torah, must be cut from the scroll and a new page added, and the page written anew from the beginning. The new page is sewn into the scroll to maintain continuity of the document. The old page is treated with appropriate respect, and is either buried, or [[Genizah|stored away]] with respect rather than otherwise destroyed or discarded. In ''tefillin'' and ''mezuzot'' all the letters, the words and the ''[[Parashah|parashot]]'' are required to be written in the order they appear in the Torah. Within any of the ''parashot'' if an error or an invalidated letter is discovered, or a missing letter was discovered after the completion of the writing, the rest of the document must be erased from the end all the way back to the error, to fix it, and write it anew.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sifrei Torah#Production|Sifrei Torah production]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/8308 Keset HaSofer in Hebrew]\n* [http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/keset/kesetindex.shtml Keset HaSofer in English]\n* [http://www.sofer.co.uk Information on how to be sofer, diaries and sources]\n* [http://www.sofer.com/calligraphy/learning.shtml Learning to Become a Sofer]\n* [http://www.soferstam.com/Movies-Lasofer/M-Lasofer-Samples.html Videos on How to Form Letters]\n* [http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/orgs/stam/index.htm Vaad Mishmereth STaM - Institute for the Preservation of STaM]\n\n{{Sofer}}\n\n[[Category:Jewish law and rituals]]\n[[Category:Hebrew calligraphy]]\n[[Category:Hebrew words and phrases]]"

Generally, ''halakha'' requires that ''mezuzot'' be affixed within 30 days of moving into a rented house or apartment. This applies to Jews living in the [[Diaspora]] (i.e., outside of the [[Land of Israel]]). For a purchased home or apartment in the Diaspora, or a residence in Israel (owned or rented), the mezuzah is affixed immediately upon moving in. The reason for this difference is that there is an assumption that when a Jew lives in Israel, Israel shall remain his/her permanent residence, whereas a home in the diaspora is temporary. Mezuzot are very special objects and must be taken care of carefully and according to Jewish laws and traditions.\n\n[[File:Mezuzah-RS.jpg|thumb|right|Mezuzah affixed to a door frame on South Street in Philadelphia.]]\nWhere the doorway is wide enough, many [[Ashkenazi Jews]] tilt the mezuzah so that the top slants toward the room into which the door opens.

The compromise solution has been suggested by Rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]].<ref name=chabad/>\n\nMost [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]], [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] and other non-Ashkenazi Jews affix the mezuzah vertically,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ohr.edu/ask/ask059.htm |title=Mezuzah - Which Way is UP??}}</ref> though [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] living in countries where the majority of Jews are Ashkenazim usually place it slanting.\n\nThe procedure is to hold the ''mezuzah'' against the spot upon which it will be affixed, then recite a blessing:\n\n:{{Hebrew|בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה יי אֱלֹהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם, אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשַׁנוּ בְּמִצְו‌ֹתָיו וְצִוָּנוּ לִקְבּוֹעַ מְזוּזָה}}\n:{{lang|he-Latn|Barukh atah Adonai Eloheinu melekh ha‘olam, asher qideshanu bemitzvotav vetzivanu liqboa‘ mezuzah.}}\n\n:Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who sanctified us with His ''[[mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and commanded us to affix a ''mezuzah''.\n\nAny Jew can recite the blessing provided he or she is old enough to understand the significance of the ''[[mitzvah]]''. After the blessing, the ''mezuzah'' is attached. \n\nWhenever passing through the doorway, many people touch a finger to the mezuzah as a way of showing respect to God in a simpler fashion than saying the prayer.\n\nWhen affixing several ''mezuzot'', it is sufficient to recite the blessing once, before affixing the first one.\n\n==Checking the parchment==\nMany observant Jews from all Jewish denominations have a qualified scribe check the mezuzot parchments for defects (such as small tears or faded lettering) at least twice every seven years.<ref name=\"bt\">[[Babylonian Talmud]], Yoma 11a</ref><ref name=\"mb\">[[Shulchan Aruch]] (291:1)</ref>  This job can be done by a sofer (scribe) or by anyone with similar training. A sofer also can make new mezuzot parchments which are in accordance with Kurdush Law.\n\n==Mezuzah cases==\nThe commandment to affix a mezuzah is widely followed in the Jewish world, even by Jews who are not religiously observant. While the important part of the mezuzah is the ''klaf'', or the parchment, and not the case itself, designing and producing mezuzah cases has been elevated to an art form over the ages. Mezuzah cases are produced from a wide variety of materials, from silver and precious metals, to wood, stone, ceramics, pewter, and even [[polymer clay]]. Some dealers of mezuzah cases will provide or offer for sale a copy of the text that has been photocopied onto paper; this is not a kosher (valid) mezuzah,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mezuzah Guide|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/278460/jewish/Guide.htm#278464|website=Chabad.org|publisher=The Chabad-Lubavitch movement|accessdate=7 September 2015|ref=kosher_mezuzah}}</ref> which must be handwritten onto a piece of parchment by a qualified scribe.\n\n==Additional inscriptions==\nIt is very customary to write two inscriptions on the back of the parchment:\n\n*the Hebrew word {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|שדי}}}} (''Shaddai'')\n*the phrase \"{{nowrap|{{Hebrew|כוזו במוכסז כוזו}}}}\"\n\n[[File:ShinMezuzahJosephSherman.jpg|thumb|Clear mezuzah case in Jerusalem, Israel]]\n\n''[[El Shaddai|Shaddai]]'', [\"Almighty\"] one of the [[names of God in Judaism|biblical names of God]], also serves here as an [[acronym]] for ''Shomer Daltot Yisrael'', \"Guardian of Israel's doors\". Many mezuzah cases are also marked with the Hebrew letter {{Hebrew|ש}} (Shin), for ''Shaddai''.\n\n\"{{nowrap|{{Hebrew|כוזו במוכסז כוזו}}}}\" is a [[Caesar cipher]] &mdash; a one letter shift &mdash; of the third, fourth, and fifth words of the Shema, ''\"Adonai, Eloheinu, Adonai\"'', \"The Lord, our God, the Lord\"; it is written on the back of the case, opposite the corresponding words on the front.<ref>Alexander Poltorak [http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=312102 The Mysterious Name]</ref> This inscription dates from the 11th century and is found among the [[Chassidei Ashkenaz|''Hasidei Ashkenaz'']] (medieval German Jewish mystics).\n\nAccording to the [[Sephardic]] custom ([[minhag]]), the phrase {{nowrap|\"{{Hebrew|כוזו במוכסז כוזו}}\"}} is prohibited, and only the Hebrew word {{nowrap|{{Hebrew|שדי}}}} (''Shaddai'') is to be written on the back of the mezuzah. This practice is supported by the [[Shulchan Aruch]] and the writings of the [[Rambam]]. The [[Ashkenazi]] custom of writing both phrases, however, was supported in the writings of the [[Moses Isserles|Remo]]. (Yoreh De'ah 288:15)\n\nIn this regard it is worthwhile to refer to the often cited passage from [[Maimonides|Rambam’s]] ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' which states:<blockquote>''It is a common custom to write [God's name,] Shaddai, on the outside of a mezuzah opposite the empty space left between the two passages. There is no difficulty in this, since [the addition is made] outside. Those, however, who write the names of angels, other sacred names, verses, or forms, on the inside [of a mezuzah] are among those who do not have a portion in the world to come. Not only do these fools nullify the mitzvah, but furthermore, they make from a great mitzvah [which reflects] the unity of the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, the love of Him, and the service of Him, a talisman for their own benefit. They, in their foolish conception, think that this will help them regarding the vanities of the world.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/925427/jewish/Chapter-Five.htm|title=Mishneh Torah|last=Rambam|first=.|publisher=|others=tr.

The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue. Another modern analogue is [[ASCII art]], where ASCII or extended ASCII characters are arranged to form an image on a computer screen and/or printout.\n\n== Motivation ==\n{{see also|Calligram}}\n[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]\nThere is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Matthias Buchinger]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://gawno.com/2009/05/micrography-text-art-and-typography/ Micrography: Text Art and Typography]\n* Leila Avrin, [http://www.jhom.com/topics/letters/micrography.html Interlaces and Grotesques: the Art of Hebrew Micrography], Jewish Heritage Online Magazine\n* [http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/prophpent.html A 13th Century Pentateuch] British Library, BL Add.

It must meet extremely strict standards of production. The Torah scroll is mainly used in the ritual of [[Torah reading]] during [[Jewish prayer]]s. At other times, it is stored in the holiest spot within a [[synagogue]], the [[Torah ark]], which is usually an ornate curtained-off cabinet or section of the synagogue built along the wall that most closely faces [[Jerusalem]], the direction Jews face when [[Jewish prayer|praying]].\n\nThe text of the Torah is also commonly printed and [[bookbinding|bound]] in [[codex|book form]] for non-ritual functions. It is then known as a ''[[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]]'' (\"five-part\", for the five books of Moses), and is often accompanied by commentaries or translations.\n\n==Usage==\n[[Torah reading]] from a ''Sefer Torah'' is traditionally reserved for Monday and Thursday mornings, as well as for [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holidays]]. The presence of a ''[[minyan]]'' is required for the reading of the Torah to be held in public during the course of the worship services. As [[Cantillation|the Torah is sung]], following the often dense text is aided by a ''[[yad]]'' (\"hand\"), a metal or wooden hand-shaped pointer that protects the scrolls by avoiding unnecessary contact of the skin with the parchment.\n\nAll Jews do a prayer with [[Berakhah]] thanking God for [[Matan Torah]], before Torah reading and all days during first [[Berakhot]]{{dn|date=April 2019}} of [[Shacharit]].<ref>[[Rabbi Yehudah]] said: \"They did not recite the blessings over the Torah before studying it!\" (''[[Talmud]], [[Bava Metzia]] 85a-b'')</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[Image:SilverTorahCase.jpg|thumb|right|A sterling silver Torah case. In some traditions the Torah is housed in an ornamental wooden case.]]\nAccording to [[halakha]], a ''Sefer Torah'' is a copy of the formal Hebrew text of the Torah hand-written on ''[[gevil]]'' or ''[[klaf]]'' (forms of [[parchment]]) (see below) by using a [[quill]] (or other permitted writing utensil) dipped in ink. Producing a sefer Torah fulfills one of the [[613 commandments]]. “The k'laf/parchment on which the Torah scroll is written, the hair or sinew with which the panels of parchment are sewn together, and the quill pen with which the text is written all must come from ritually clean —that is, kosher— animals.”<ref>''Essential Torah: A Complete Guide to the Five Books of Moses'' by George Robinson. (Schocken, 2006) {{ISBN|0-8052-4186-8}}. pp.10–11</ref>\n\nWritten entirely in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a sefer Torah contains 304,805 letters, all of which must be duplicated precisely by a trained [[sofer]] (“scribe”), an effort which may take as long as approximately one and a half years. An error during transcription may render the sefer Torah ''pasul'' (“invalid”). According to the [[Talmud]], all scrolls must also be written on ''gevil'' parchment that is treated with salt, flour and ''m'afatsim'' in order to be valid. Scrolls not processed in this way are considered invalid (Hilkoth Tefillin 1:8 & 1:14, Maimonides).\n\nThe calfskin or parchment on which the sacred Hebrew text is written is mounted into a wooden housing called עץ חיים (Tree of Life) in Hebrew. The housing has two rollers, each of which has two handles used for scrolling the text, four handles in all. Between the handles and the rollers are round plates or disks which are carved with images of holy places, engraved with dedications to the donor's parents or other loved ones, and decorated with gold or silver.\n\nMost modern Sifrei Torah are written with forty-two lines of text per column (Yemenite Jews use fifty one). Very strict rules about the position and appearance of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] are observed. See for example the [[Mishnah Berurah]] on the subject.<ref>[http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/ms/letterforms.shtml Mishnat Soferim The forms of the letters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711145829/http://www.hasoferet.com/ritual/ms/letterforms.shtml |date=2011-07-11 }} translated by Jen Taylor Friedman (geniza.net)</ref> Any of several Hebrew scripts may be used, most of which are fairly ornate and exacting. The fidelity of the Hebrew text of the [[Tanakh]], and the Torah in particular, is considered paramount, down to the last letter: translations or transcriptions are frowned upon for formal service use, and transcribing is done with painstaking care.\n\nSome errors are inevitable in the course of production. If the error involves a word other than the name of God, the mistaken letter may be obliterated from the scroll by scraping the letter off the scroll with a sharp object. If the name of God is written in error, the entire page must be cut from the scroll and a new page added, and the page written anew from the beginning. The new page is sewn into the scroll to maintain continuity of the document. The old page is treated with appropriate respect, and is buried with respect rather than being otherwise destroyed or discarded.\n\nThe completion of the Sefer Torah is a cause for great celebration, and honored guests of the individual who commissioned the Torah are invited to a celebration wherein each of the honored guests is given the opportunity to write one of the final letters. It is a great honor to be chosen for this.\n\nIt is a [[mitzvah]] for every Jewish male to either write or have written for him a Sefer Torah. Of the 613 commandments, one – the 82nd as enumerated by [[Rashi]], and the final as it occurs in the text the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] (31:19) – is that every Jewish male should write a Sefer Torah in his lifetime.\n\nIn modern times, it is usual for some scholars to become ''soferim'' and to be paid to complete a Sefer Torah under contract on behalf of a community or by individuals to mark a special occasion or commemoration. Because of the work involved, these can cost tens of thousands of [[United States dollar]]s to produce to ritually proper standards.\n\nA printed version of the Torah is known colloquially as a [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (plural ''Chumashim''). Although strictly speaking it is known as Chamishah Chumshei Torah (Five \"Fifths\" of Torah). They are treated as respected texts, but not anywhere near the level of sacredness accorded a Sefer Torah, which is often a major possession of a Jewish community. A ''chumash'' contains the Torah and other writings, usually organised for liturgical use, and sometimes accompanied by some of the main classic commentaries.\n\n==Types of material permitted to use for a Sefer Torah==\n{{main|klaf|gevil}}\n[[File:Yemenite_Sefer_Torah_on_Givil_200_years_old.jpg|thumb|right|A 200-year-old Yemenite Sefer Torah, on Gevil, from the Beith Keneseth Rambam in Jerusalem. The Sofer was from the Sharabi family]]\nThere are three types of specially processed animal skin or ''[[parchment]]'': gevil (a full, un-split animal hide), ''Klaf'' (also ''Qlaf'' or ''K'laf''), and [[Duchsustus|duchsustos]], the latter two being one half of a split animal hide; arguably either the inner layer (adjacent to the flesh), or the outer layer (on which the hair grows). These are [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] words to describe different types of parchment, although the term ''duchsustos'' is Greek. These are used for the production of a [[mezuzah]], [[Five Megillot|megillah]], [[tefillin]], and/or a Sefer Torah (“Torah scroll”). A kosher Sefer Torah should be written on gevil. If klaf is used in place of gevil, the Sefer Torah is still kosher, but this should not be done at the outset (l'chatchila). A Sefer Torah written on duchsustos is not kosher.\n[[File:Scroll ink materials.JPG|200px|thumb|left|Ingredients used in making ink for Hebrew scrolls today.]]\n\nAfter preparation, the scribe must mark out the parchment using the ''sargel'' (“ruler”) ensuring the guidelines are straight. Only the top guide is done and the letters suspended from it.\n\nThe use of gevil and certain types of parchment has allowed some ''sifrei Torah'' of antiquity to survive intact for over 800 years.\n\nThe ink used in writing scrolls had to adhere to a surface that was rolled and unrolled, so special inks were developed. Even so, ink would slowly flake off of scrolls. If the ink from too many letters is lost, a Torah scroll is no longer used.\n\n==External decorations==\n[[Image:TorahBreastPlate.jpg|thumb|right|A Sterling Silver Torah Breast Plate - or Hoshen - often decorate Torah Scrolls.]]\n[[Image:TorahCrown1.jpg|thumb|right|A set of sterling silver finials (''rimmonim'') are used to decorate the top ends of the rollers.]]\nA completed Sefer Torah is treated with great honor and respect. While not in use it is housed in the [[Torah ark]] (''Aron Kodesh'' or ''Hekhal''), which in its turn is usually veiled by an embroidered [[parochet]] (curtain) as it should be according to Exodus 26:31–34. The scroll itself will often be girded with a strip of silk (see [[wimpel]]) and \"robed\" with a piece of protective fine fabric, called the \"Mantle of the Law\". It is decorated with an ornamental [[priestly breastplate]], scroll-handles (''‘etz ḥayyim''), and the principal ornament—the \"Crown of the Law\", which is made to fit over the upper ends of the rollers when the scroll is closed. Some scrolls have two crowns, one for each upper end.  The metalwork is often made of beaten silver, sometimes gilded.  The gold and silver ornaments belonging to the scroll are collectively known as ''kele kodesh'' (sacred vessels), and somewhat resemble the ornaments of the [[High Priest of Israel]] (''Kohen gadol''). The scroll-handles, breastplate and crown often have little bells attached to them (cf. [[Rimmon|rimmonim]]). A [[yad]], or pointer, may also be hung from the scroll, since the Torah itself should never be touched with the bare finger. This ornamentation does not constitute worship of the Sefer Torah, but is intended to distinguish it as sacred and holy, as the living word of God. Special prayers are recited when the Sefer Torah is removed from the ark (see [[Torah reading]]), and the text is chanted, rather than spoken, in a special melodic manner (see [[Cantillation]] and [[Nigun]]).  Whenever the scroll is opened to be read it is laid on a piece of cloth called the ''mappah''. When the Sefer Torah is carried through the synagogue, the members of the congregation may touch the edge of their [[tallit]] to the Sefer Torah and then kiss it as a sign of respect.\n\nIn the [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrachi]] and [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote traditions]], the Sefer Torah is generally not robed in a mantle, but rather housed in an ornamental wooden case which protects the scroll, called a \"tik\". On the other hand, most [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi communities]] &mdash; those communities associated with the Spanish diaspora, such as [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Moroccan Jews]], the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] (with the exception of the Hamburg tradition<ref>Mosel, Wilhelm: [http://www1.uni-hamburg.de/rz3a035//1markt.html “Synagoge der Portugiesisch-Jüdischen Gemeinde in Hamburg (Synagogue of the Portuguese-Jewish Community in Hamburg), situated at the rear of No. 6 of the former Zweite Marktstraße, later Marcusstraße.”]</ref>), and the [[Judaeo-Spanish]] communities of the [[Ottoman Empire]] &mdash; do not use ''tikim'', but rather ''vestidos'' (mantles).\n\n==Inauguration of a Torah scroll==\n{{main|Inauguration of a Torah scroll}}\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 10909 Architecture of Israel.JPG|180px|right|thumb|Torah scrolls are escorted into a new synagogue in [[Kfar Maimon]], Israel, 2006]]\nThe installation of a new sefer Torah into a synagogue, or into the sanctuary or [[beth midrash]] of a [[yeshiva]], rabbinical college, university campus, nursing home, military base, or other institution, is done in a ceremony known as ''[[Inauguration of a Torah scroll|hachnosas sefer Torah]]'', or \"ushering in a Torah scroll\"; this is accompanied by celebratory dancing, singing, and a festive meal. This practice has its source in the escorting of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to [[Jerusalem]], led by King [[David]].

      "text": "{{other uses2|Sofer}}\n{{For|the talmudic tractate|Soferim (Talmud)}}\n[[File:Sofer.jpg|200px|thumb|upright|A sofer finishing the final letters of a [[sefer Torah]]]]\nA '''Sofer''', '''Sopher''', '''Sofer SeTaM''', or '''Sofer ST\"M''' ([[Hebrew language|Heb:]] \"scribe\", {{lang-he2|[[w:he:סופר סת\"ם|סופר סת״ם]]}}) (female: ''soferet'') is a Jewish [[scribe]] who can transcribe [[sefer Torah|sifrei Torah]], [[tefillin]], and [[Mezuzah|mezuzot]], the [[Five Megillot]] and other religious writings. ({{anchor|ST_M}}'''ST\"M''', {{lang-he2|סת״ם}}, is an abbreviation of these three terms. The plural of sofer is \"soferim\" {{lang-he2|סופרים}}.)\n\nBy simple definition, a sofer is a [[copyist]], but the religious role in [[Judaism]] is much more. Besides sifrei Torah, tefillin, and mezuzot, scribes are also necessary to write the [[Five Megillot]] (scrolls of the [[Song of Songs]], [[Book of Ruth]], [[Book of Esther]], [[Ecclesiastes]], and [[Book of Lamentations]]), [[Nevi'im]] (the books of the prophets, used for reading the [[haftarah]]), and for ''[[Get (divorce document)|gittin]]'', divorce documents. Also, many scribes function as calligraphers—writing functional documents such as [[ketubah|''ketubot'']] \"marriage contracts\", or ornamental and artistic renditions of religious texts, which do not require any scribal qualifications, and to which the rules on lettering and parchment specifications do not apply.\n\nThe major [[halakha]] pertaining to ''sofrut'', the practice of scribal arts, is in the [[Talmud]] in the tractate \"[[Soferim (Talmud)|Maseket Sofrim]]\". In the Torah's [[613 commandments]], the second to last<ref>82nd of the [[613 commandments]] as enumerated by [[Rashi]], and the second to final as it occurs in the text of the Torah, [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 31:19, the final being in Deuteronomy 32:38</ref> is that every [[Jews|Jew]] should write a Sefer Torah in his lifetime ({{bibleverse-lb||Deuteronomy|31:19|HE}}).\n\n==Qualifications and education==\n[[File:Sofer, Jewish scribe.JPG|thumb|A Sofer at work, [[Ein Bokek]], Israel]]\nA sofer must be religiously observant, of good character, and knowledgeable about the laws concerning sofrut. It is a common misconception that one has to be a [[rabbi]] in order to become a sofer, which is not required by Jewish law.\n\nPeople who want to become ritual scribes usually learn from another expert scribe by undergoing Shimush (Apprenticeship), since it would be impossible for someone to be a scribe without any actual practice. The hardest part about learning to be a sofer is not the [[calligraphy]], but, rather, remembering the thousands of laws that apply to sifrei Torah, tefillin, mezuzot, and all the other texts that are written on [[parchment]].\n\nSome people who want to become ritual scribes learn at the ''Vaad Mishmereth STaM'', with the option of receiving a certificate. (This is an international organization whose goal is to protect the halachic and artistic integrity of the scribal arts. It is located in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Bnei Brak]] in Israel, as well as in [[Brooklyn]], New York, United States.) Certification of this sort is not a halachic requirement, nor does it necessarily guarantee the quality of a particular sofer's work. This process does however ensure that a certified sofer has received the proper education and is a recognized expert in the field of sofrut.\n\n===Texts teaching sofrut===\n[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Torah Scribe.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Torah Scribe'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]], [[National Museum, Wrocław]]]]\nThe main texts from which soferim learn the scribal art include the ''Keset Ha-Sofer'', ''Chasdey David'', [[Mishnah Berurah]] Volume I (B)—The laws of tefillin, Mishneh Torah: Hilchot Tefillin u'Mezuzah v'Sefer Torah.

      "text": "[[File:Two Torah scrolls.jpg|right|350px|Yemenite Torah scrolls]]\n'''Yemenite scrolls of the Law''' containing the Five Books of Moses (the ''[[Torah]]'') represent one of three authoritative [[Sofer (scribe)|scribal]] traditions for the transmission of the Torah, the other two being the [[Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardic]] traditions that slightly differ.<ref>Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), p. 68. According to Penkower, the Ashkenazi tradition– with respect to ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'' in their Torah scrolls – follows more closely the teachings of Rabbi [[Meir Abulafia|Meir Halevi Abulafia]] (the Ramah), Rabbi [[Menahem Lonzano]] (author of ''Or Torah'') and Rabbi [[Jedidiah Norzi]], the author of the seminal work, ''Minḥat Shai''. Their accepted orthography for the Hebrew Bible was published in the Tartaz Codex, printed in Amsterdam in 1666. Excluding the irregular letters in the Torah, the Ashkenazi tradition differs from the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] tradition in some thirteen places. Penkower goes on to say that the Yemenite tradition, in terms of ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', is nearly identical to the Aleppo Codex; see also [[Mordechai Breuer|Breuer, M.]] (1976), English Introduction (p. xxvii).</ref> While all three traditions purport to follow the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] traditions of [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher|Aaron ben Asher]], slight differences between the three major traditions have developed over the years. Biblical texts proofread by ben Asher survive in two extant codices (the [[Aleppo Codex]] and the [[Leningrad Codex]]), the latter said to have only been patterned after texts proofread by Ben Asher. The former work, although more precise, was partially lost following its removal from Aleppo in 1947.\n\nThe Yemenite Torah scroll is unique in that it contains many of the oddly-formed letters, such as the \"overlapping\" ''pe'' (פ) and the \"crooked\" ''lamed'' (ל), etc., mentioned in ''Sefer Tagae'',<ref>An ancient [[Tannaic]] manuscript that was first printed in Paris in 1866 under the title ''Sefer Tagin'', although believed to be defected in parts by its copyists, and which was also copied in ''[[Mahzor Vitri]]'', top of ''Parashat Vayishlaḥ'' (pp. 674–ff.), with slight variations. The entire work has been reprinted by [[Menachem Mendel Kasher|Kasher, M.]] (1978), pp. 87–90.</ref> as also by [[Menachem Meiri]]<ref>[[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] (1956)</ref> and by [[Maimonides]],<ref>''[[Mishne Torah]]'' (''Hil. Sefer Torah'' 7:8)</ref> although not found in ben Asher's [[orthography]]. The old line arrangements employed by the early Yemenite scribes in their Torah scrolls are nearly the same as prescribed by ben Asher. Like ben Asher's Masoretic tradition, it also contains nearly all the ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', as well as the large and small letters employed in the writing of the Torah, a work held by medieval scribes in Israel to be the most accurate of all Masoretic traditions.\n\nThe disputes between ben Asher and [[Ben Naphtali]] are well-known to Hebrew grammarians. Maimonides' verdict in that dispute is in accordance with ben Asher.<ref>[[Maimonides]], Hil. ''Sefer Torah'' 8:4</ref>\n<blockquote>\nThe codex that we have relied upon in these matters is the well-known codex in Egypt, comprising twenty-four canonical books, [and] which was in Jerusalem for several years to proof-read the scrolls there from, and all [of Israel] used to rely upon it, since '''Ben-Asher''' had proof-read it and scrutinized it for many years, and proof-read it many times, just as they had copied down. Now, upon it, I relied with regard to the book of the Law that I wrote, according to the rules which govern its proper writing.</blockquote>\n\nMaimonides' ruling in this regard eventually caused the Jews of Yemen to abandon their former system of orthography, and during his lifetime most scribes in Yemen had already begun to replace their former system of orthography for that of Ben-Asher.<ref name=jerusalem1989>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1989), p. 934</ref> Scribes in Yemen, especially the illustrious Benayah family of scribes<ref>Benayah ben Sa'adyah has long been acknowledged as the greatest scribe of Yemenite Jewry and as patriarch of an entire family of Yemenite scribes which flourished beginning in the latter half of the fifteenth century, in and around the capital, Sana'a.  In addition to Benaya himself, at least four of his children (three sons and a daughter) and two of his grandsons followed in his footsteps and penned Hebrew manuscripts. According to Yemenite tradition, the Benayah family is said to have copied some 400 volumes. Out of this great number, only about 36 codices have survived.</ref> of the 15th and 16th centuries, patterned their own codices containing the proper orthography, vocalization and accentuation after Maimonides' accepted practice in his ''[[Sefer Torah]]'', who, in turn, had based his Torah-scroll on Ben-Asher's orthography,<ref>Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), p. 63 (top)</ref> with especial attention given to the line arrangements of the two Prosaic Songs mentioned by him, the [[Parashah#Spacing techniques|Open and Closed sections]] of the Torah, and ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum''.<ref name=jerusalem1989 /> Such codices were disseminated all throughout Yemen. The ''tījān'' (codices) were copied with particular care, since they were intended as model texts from which scribes would copy Torah scrolls, with the one exception that in the Torah scrolls themselves they contained no vocalization and accentuations. In most of these ''tījān'', every three pages equalled one column in the Sefer Torah.<ref>See the Yemenite Codex (''Tāj'') now at the British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=or_2350_f123v Or. 2350], written in 1408, showing the beginning of the column used in the Torah for ''Shirat ha-Yam'' (the ''Song of the Sea''), and which single column is continued in the following two pages of the codex.</ref> A recurring avowal appears in nearly all copies of codices penned by the Benayah family, namely, that the codex which lay before the reader was written \"completely according to the arrangement of the book which was in Egypt, which was edited by Ben Asher....\"<ref>Hibshoosh, Yehiel (1985), Foreword by [[Shelomo Morag]]; Taj Benaya (copied in the 1846th year of the Seleucid era/1535 CE); British Museum, Or. 2364; British Museum, Or. 2349; British Museum, Or. 2350; British Museum, Or. 2365; British Museum, Or. 1379, et al.</ref> Based on the preceding lines of this avowal, the reference is to the Open and Closed sections that were copied from the section on orthography in the Yemenite MS. of Maimonides’ [[Mishneh Torah]], a work which Maimonides himself claims to have been based on Ben-Asher (i.e. the Aleppo Codex), universally recognized since the time of Maimonides as the most accurate recension of the Hebrew Bible. Benayah’s use of this avowal simply mirrors the words of Maimonides in his ''Hilkhot Sefer Torah'', while most scholars doubt if he had actually seen a codex proofread by Ben-Asher.<ref>Bin-Nun, Adam (2016)</ref> Others say that the avowal merely refers to the [[Tiberian pointing|Tiberian masoretic tradition]] (vowels and accentuations) adopted by the Benayah family in their codices.<ref>Offer, Joseph (1989), p. 338 [62], note 10.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yemenite_Torah_case_with_finials.jpg|thumb|right|Yemenite Torah case with finials]]\n\n==Layout==\nThe Yemenite scroll of the Torah is traditionally written on 51 lines to each column,<ref name=beneibarak2000>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (2000), p. 172 (§ 165:23)</ref> differing from Ashkenazi and Sephardic scrolls that are almost exclusively made of 42 lines to each column. Unique to Yemenite scrolls, based on what is prescribed in their codices, is that each column concludes with the end of a particular verse and begins with the start of a new verse; never broken in the middle.<ref>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (1975), p. 33.</ref> Each column starts afresh, excepting in only six designated places, whose [[mnemonics]] are בי\"ה שמ\"ו (see ''infra''), and in excepting in the two prosaic songs (the ''Song of the Sea'' and ''Ha'azinu''), where the columns in these places begin in the middle of a verse.<ref>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (2000), pp.174–175 (§ 165:23)</ref> These six places (five places when בראשית of Gen. 1:1 is excluded, since it is only used to form the mnemonic) are the only exceptions to the rule, and which practice is intended to ensure uniformity and exactness in the scribal practice and layout in the ''Sefer Torah'' throughout all generations. Yemenite scrolls comprise a total of 226 columns (רכ\"ו דפים),<ref name=beneibarak2000 /> and which average width of each column is approximately four finger-breadths, usually {{convert|9.3|cm|in|}}, with a space of {{convert|3.7|cm|in|}} between columns. Columns containing the Prosaic Songs are considerably wider to facilitate the writing of the song in its usual format. For the Prosaic Song ''[[Ha'azinu]]'', the first column which contains the song is made ca. {{convert|14|cm|in|}} in width, while the second column that concludes the song is made ca. {{convert|14.9|cm|in|}} in width. For the Prosaic ''[[Song of the Sea]]'' the column measures approximately {{convert|14|cm|in|}} in width. The sheets of parchment used in making the scroll measure approximately {{convert|54.7|cm|in|}} in length (from top to bottom), although varying in width, with at least three columns to each sheet. Most are made with full-grain leather (Heb. ''[[Gevil|ğawīl]]''),<ref>[[Shulhan Arukh]], ''Yoreh De'ah'' (Hil. ''Sefer Torah'' § 271:3).</ref> that is, leather where the \"split\" layer has not been removed from it. In Yemen, the custom was to treat the raw hide with a tannin-solution made from the leaves of Acacia etbaica (Arabic: ''qarāḍ'') to ensure the leather's lasting durability. This also gave to the leather a reddish-brown luster. The sheets of parchment were traditionally sewn together with [[sinew]]s (tendons) taken from the animal's loins (flanks), rather than from the animal's heels (the latter being prescribed by Maimonides).<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1985), chapter 3, p. 334 (note 20). The advantage of taking the tendons from the flanks (Heb. '''כסלים''') is that they were naturally long, unlike those taken from the heel, and they did not require softening by working them with a stone, nor was it necessary to twine the tendons before making use of them (ibid.).</ref>\n\n==Plene and defective scriptum==\nThere are thirteen orthographic traditions in the first category which are peculiar to the Yemenite tradition and which differ from the traditions borne by other groups. The Yemenite arrangement has been published in many sources, the most notable of which being that of the last Chief Rabbi of Yemen, Rabbi [[Amram Qorah]].<ref>[[Amram Qorah|Qorah, A.]] (1987), pp. 103–105.</ref> By a comparative study, the Yemenite tradition in ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'' is nearly in complete harmony with that of the Aleppo Codex which was proofread by the masorete, [[Aaron ben Asher|Ben-Asher]].<ref>Offer, Joseph (1989), 309 [33]</ref>\n[[File:Yemenite Sefer Torah on Givil 200 years old.jpg|thumb|Yemenite Sefer Torah on full-grain leather]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"background:Ivory; text-align:center\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"|Verses\n! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"|Content\n! style=\"background:Navajowhite;\"|Change\n|-\n|\n|columnspan=3|''Genesis'' (בראשית)\n|\n|-\n|{{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|4:13|HE}}\n|'''גדול עוני מנשא'''<ref>[[Amram Qorah|Qorah, A.]] (1987), p. 103 (Hebrew).

The [[Leningrad Codex]], a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work, has also the word '''תעשה''' written without a ''yod'', in ''defective scriptum''. Concerning this word in Exodus 25:31, [[Avraham ibn Ezra]] has written: \"I have seen books [of the Torah] that were checked by the sages of Tiberias, and fifteen of their elders have sworn that they have looked three times upon every word and every point, and [upon] every word written in ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'', and lo! There was written a ''yod'' in the word תֵּיעֲשֶׂה. But I haven’t found so in the books [of the Torah] in Spain and in France, and beyond the sea. Moreover, the ancients have expounded that the addition of a ''yod'' (i.e. numerical value of ten) alludes to the ten candelabrums that Solomon would make, although the general rule states that if there were there a ''yod'' it is a foreign word. By way of an exegesis [they have said] that it was made by itself (i.e. because of its passive-perfect tense).

There, Maimonides writes: `''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''This is the offering, [etc.]''`(Lev. 6:12); \"`''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs [to the verse], `''Speak unto Aaron, [etc.]''` (Lev. 6:17); `''And this is the law of the guilt-offering, [etc.]''` (Lev. 7:1); `''And this is the law of the sacrifice, [etc.]''` (Lev. 7:11); '''`''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''Speak unto the children of Israel, [etc.] [all suet, etc.]''` (Lev. 7:22)''';  `''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''Take Aaron, [etc.]''` (Lev. 8:1) – all of them are Open sections, and they are [altogether] six.\" In the highlighted text, the [[Leningrad Codex]] (a text whose scribe made use of texts proofread by Ben-Asher when editing his own work) renders this passage of scripture an Open section. (Original Hebrew: וידבר דזה קרבן, וידבר דדבר אל אהרן, וזאת תורת האשם, וזאת תורת זבח, '''וידבר דדבר אל בני ישראל''', וידבר דקח את אהרן, כולן פתוחות, והן שש). See also [[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] (1881), [http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49533&st=&pgnum=133&hilite= ''Parashat Ṣau'', # 7], who lists this section as an \"Open Section\" (Hebrew). However, in the modern printed texts of Maimonides, the reading differs greatly: \"`''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''This is the offering, [etc.]''` (Lev. 6:12); `''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''Speak unto Aaron, [etc.]''` (Lev. 6:17); `''And this is the law of the guilt-offering, [etc.]''` (Lev. 7:1); `''And this is the law of the sacrifice, [etc.]''` (Lev. 7:11); '''`''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''Speak unto the children of Israel, [etc.] He that offers, [etc.]''` (Lev. 7:28)'''; `''And the LORD spake, [etc.]''` which belongs to [the verse], `''Take Aaron, [etc.]''` (Lev. 8:1) – all of them are Open sections, and they are [altogether] six.\" (Hebrew: ). Rabbi Yehudah Attiya, a rabbi of Aleppo who had seen the Aleppo Codex and copied-down its Open and Closed sections, made a comparison between the same and Maimonides' list of Open and Closed sections. This list was sent to Jerusalem, and was later reviewed by [[Umberto Cassuto|M.D. Cassuto]], who, in turn, disclosed that the section known as ''ha-maqrīv'' (Lev. 7:28), though not listed as a section in Maimonides, was listed as an Open section in the Aleppo Codex.</ref>\n|-\n|{{Bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|7:28–29|HE}}\n|'''פרשת המקריב'''<ref name=jerusalem1987 />\n|<small>This is neither a \"Closed\" nor an \"Open\" Section</small><ref>This section is listed as an Open section in the Aleppo Codex.

The line arrangements of ''[[Haazinu|Shirat Ha'azinu]]'' (Deut. 32:1–43) in the Yemenite Torah scrolls follow closely that of Ben Asher as conveyed by Maimonides' Mishne Torah, and, unlike the Sephardic tradition of writing the song in seventy lines (based on the ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]''),<ref>''Shulhan Arukh'' (''Yoreh De'ah'' § 275:5). The Sephardic tradition is also consonant with the practice found in the [[Minor Tractate]], ''[[Soferim (Talmud)|Treatise Sofrim]]'' 12:9.</ref> the Yemenite tradition is to write the song in only sixty-seven lines.<ref>The Yemenite tradition, in terms of number of lines in ''Shirat Ha'azinu'', follows the ruling of Maimonides, in his handwritten Ms. of Mishne Torah, now at the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford, England ([http://maimonides.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/viewer/ Ms. Huntington 80]), pp. 135b–136a. In the printed texts, however, the text of Maimonides' ''Mishne Torah'' (''Hil. Sefer Torah'' 8:4) has been altered to read \"seventy lines\" (rather than 67). A comparison with the partially extant Book of Deuteronomy in the Aleppo Codex reveals that it, too, was written in only 67 lines. See: [http://aleppocodex.org/newsite/index.html The Aleppo Codex Online] (select Book of Deuteronomy from list, starting with chapter 32_28).</ref>\n\nThe column on the sheet of parchment containing the prosaic song ''Ha'azinu'' is made wider than other columns, so as to make room for the poem's layout, written in the format of sixty-seven double half-columns, meaning to say, spaces are made between the verses which appear to descend in two columns. The prosaic song itself is preceded by a blank space, above which are six lines that are written in a format fixed by tradition, with the following words at the head of each line: the 1st line starting with '''ואעידה''' and ending with '''ידעתי'''; the 2nd line starting with '''אחרי''' and ending with '''מן'''; the 3rd line starting with '''הדרך''' and ending with '''הרעה'''; the 4th line starting with '''באחרית''' and ending with God's divine name, '''יהוה'''; the 5th line starting with '''להכעיסו''' and ending with '''כל'''; and the 6th line starting with '''קהל''' and ending with '''תמם'''.<ref>See the 15th century Yemenite Codex at the British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=or_2350_f300r Or. 2350], showing the six lines with their proper indentations. Every three pages in the codex equals one column in the Sefer Torah.</ref> It is to be noted that the original Yemenite practice was to write these six short lines with [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentations]] before and after the text of each line, rather than draw-out the lines unto the margins by stretching certain letters within the text.<ref>[[Yihya Saleh|Saleh Y.]] (1979), vol. 2, ''responsum'' # 22. Although Maharitz suggested a compromise of sorts out of respect to those exponents of the law who objected to this practice of making indentations in these six lines, the original Yemenite tradition viewed the practice as valid, and Yemenite scribes continued to make use of this practice, without change.</ref> The scribal practice of indenting these six lines was also the widespread practice used in [[Turkey]], in very old and exquisite Torah scrolls during the time of Rabbi [[Chaim Benveniste]] (1603–1673).<ref>[[Chaim Benveniste|Benveniste, C.]] (n.d.), s.v. [[Yoreh De'ah]] ''responsum'' # 234</ref> After these six lines there is a space followed by the Prosaic Song, written in the format of a song. The Yemenite tradition follows the Aleppo Codex's layout of the Prosaic Song, excepting lines 38 and 39, being the only deviation in word sequence, now believed by most scholars to be an anomaly, by way of confusing the double usage of the Hebrew word '''גם''' (q.v.

Ibn Tibbon replied, sending to him an accurate copy of the arranged lines of the ''[[Song of the Sea]]'' ({{Lang-he-n|שירת הים}}) in Exodus 15:1–19 as found in the scroll that was copied from Maimonides’ Torah scroll. He writes that he found the three words, '''את מי הים''' (= \"''the waters of the sea''\"), written at the beginning of the last line.<ref>[[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] (1956), p. 47, who mentions this invaluable account, wherein he copies down a letter written by Rabbi Meir b. Todros Halevi where he states explicitly that he found the words as written above, but decided against its orthography because of the way the previous lines had been made.</ref> Notwithstanding, Rabbi Meir ben Todros admitted to having deviated from this tradition, having decided against its orthography, seeing that in the ''Song of the Sea'' all of the previous lines had thus far ended in one word, and it seemed fitting to him that the second to the last line should also end in one word. He therefore changed its order, by his own admittance. The author of ''Minḥat Shai'' followed in suit and also changed the original order of the last two lines in the ''Song of the Sea''. The Yemenite Jews still maintain the old tradition in the line arrangements of the ''Song of the Sea'', following Ben Asher's format in the words that are to begin each line, as well as in the words which are to conclude each line.<ref name=\"bneibrak2000c\" /> Their fidelity to tradition has been praised by Dr. Penkower, a specialist of Textual Transmission of the Bible and the ''Masorah'' at the Department of the Bible in [[Bar-Ilan University]], who wrote: \"It's worthy of adding that in the Yemenite manuscripts of the Torah the arrangement of lines in the Prosaic ''Song of the Sea'' is exactly like the arrangement found in the Aleppo Codex, including the last two lines and the lines that are before the ''Song'' and that are after it.\"<ref>Penkower, Jordan S.

The [[Damascus Pentateuch]] of the 10th century, which incorporates both the Ben Asher and Ben Naphtali traditions, also writes these words as one word (see ibid., p. 140 in vol. 1).</ref> However, in the Yemenite tradition, the words are not joined together, but are written as two words,<ref>Hibshoosh, Yehiel (1985), Preface, s.v. Exodus 17:16</ref> just as the words appear in the [[Leningrad Codex]] and in the [[Damascus Pentateuch]]. This anomaly may be attributed to the fact that the Yemenite copyists in their transmission of the ''masorah'' made use of several ancient works, and perhaps even their own ancient Torah scrolls, just as they did when conveying the ''plene'' and ''defective scriptum'' of the ''textus receptus'' (which almost completely agreed with that of masorete, Ben-Asher) – yet, without the aid or assistance of Maimonides who left no indication on how these words should be written, or just as they did also with the irregular letters written in the Torah, although here, too, Maimonides gave no indication about which of these letters should be made differently.<ref> Penkower, Jordan S. (1992), pp. 69–70, esp. note 190.</ref> While Ben Asher was the arbiter in cases of vocalization in the Aleppo Codex, he was not, admittedly, the scribe who wrote the text, which scribe was rather Shlomo ben Buya'a. Since the Leningrad Codex, a codex also proofread by Ben-Asher, stands at variance here with the Aleppo Codex's entry, one might only speculate if Ben-Asher ever totally agreed with everything written in those codices. Yishai ben Amram ha-Cohen Amadi (late 16th century), a man who had actually seen the Aleppo Codex and noted its rendition of '''כסיה''' as one word, continued to write in his own papers the word as being made-up of two words. Moreover, the ''Treatise Sofrim''<ref>''Treatise Sofrim'' 7:3</ref> which brings down a list of words in the Torah that are written as one word, but read as two words (e.g. '''בגד''' in Gen. 30:11 which is read as '''בא גד''', and '''אשדת''' in Deut. 33:3 which is read as '''אש דת''') does not list '''כסיה''' as one of these words.\n\n[[Mordechai Breuer]] makes note of the fact that \"versions in the Talmud differ in many instances from the versions of the Masoretes (see, for example, ''Gilyon ha-Shas'', the comments of R. [[Akiva Eger|Aqiba Eiger]] on the margin of the Talmud, ''Shabbat'' 55b). Accordingly, Talmudic versions are of no relevance here; perhaps they reflect the 'correct' or 'original' text of the Bible, but they are non-Masoretic by definition, and they have nothing to do with the uniform version which was accepted by the Tiberian Masoretes.\"<ref>[[Mordechai Breuer|Breuer, M.]] (1976), pp. xiv; 88</ref>\n\nSimilarly, according to [[Rashi]], the verse '''ויהי ביום כלות משה''' (in Numbers 7:1) is written with '''כלת''' in ''defective scriptum''. This, however, is not the case in the [[Masoretic Text]]s, nor in the Yemenite Jewish tradition, where the word '''כלות''' is written in ''[[plene]]'' scriptum. Elsewhere, according to Rashi, the word '''פילגשים''' in (Genesis 25:6) is also written in ''defective scriptum'', and which is not the case in either the Masoretic texts or in the Yemenite Jewish tradition.\n\n==Other line arrangements==\nA famous rabbinic dictum states that scribes are to be careful to have certain columns begin with fixed words, known by their [[mnemonics]], '''בי\"ה שמ\"ו'''.<ref>[[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] (1956), p. 38</ref> These, too, can be found in their designated places, each letter commencing the word of that column. Such was also the practice in Yemen.<ref>See ''[[Tikkun (book)#Tikkun soferim|Tikkun Soferim]]'' (1993), based on an old Torah scroll brought out from Yemen.</ref> For example: The Hebrew character ''bet'' ('''ב''') represents the first word in the Torah, '''<big>ב</big>ראשית''' (Gen. 1:1); the Hebrew character ''yod'' ('''י''') represents '''<big>י</big>הודה אתה יודוך''' (Gen. 49:8); the Hebrew character ''he'' ('''ה''') represents '''<big>ה</big>באים אחריהם בים''' (Exo. 14:28); the Hebrew character ''shin'' ('''ש''') represents '''<big>ש</big>מר ושמעת''' (Deut. 12:28); the Hebrew character ''mim'' ('''מ''') represents '''<big>מ</big>וצא שפתיך תשמר''' (Deut. 23:24); and, finally, the Hebrew character ''waw'' ('''ו''') represents '''<big>ו</big>אעידה בם''' (Deut. 31:28). Aside from the first word in this mnemonic device taken from Psalm 68:5, the other letters come to represent the only places in the entire Torah where the column begins in the middle of a verse, whereas in all other columns, the start of a new verse always commences a new column. Likewise, in ''[[Shemini (parsha)|Parashat Shemini]]'' ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0310.htm Leviticus 10:16]), a tradition passed down by the scribes was to ensure that each scribe when copying from a master text is careful to write the first '''דרש''' (''derosh'') at the very end of the line, while the second '''דרש''' (''derash'') be written at the forefront of the next line.<ref>[[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] (1956), p. 38, citing ''Treatise Sofrim'' 9:2.</ref> In the Yemenite Torah scroll brought out from Yemen, now belonging to Azriel ben Saadia Tzadok (Saleh) of Benei Barak, from which a ''[[Tikkun (book)|Tikkun Soferim]]'' was made in five small pocket volumes to facilitate the accurate transmission of the same ''masorah'' by scribes, the first word '''דרש''' is, indeed, found at the very end of line # 14, whereas the second word '''דרש''' is found written at the forefront of line # 15.<ref>''[[Tikkun (book)#Tikkun soferim|Tikkun Soferim]]'' (1993), s.v.

In these findings, there emerged differences between the Aleppo Codex and the Yemenite tradition (based on Maimonides) in three different sections. See: Offer, Joseph (1989), pp. 325 [49]–326 [50]).</ref> Neither one of these sections reflect the custom of Yemen today, which points to the assumption that, apparently, they changed their ancient practice in this matter to conform with that of Maimonides, as stated by the late chief Yemenite Rabbi, [[Yosef Qafih]].<ref name=jerusalem1989 /> Scholars have pointed out eight differences between the Aleppo Codex and the [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]] tradition of orthography.<ref>These being: Gen. 41:45; Exo. 1:19; Exo. 17:16; Exo. 34:1; Lev. 7:28–29; Lev. 19:16; Lev. 25:10–12 and Num. 22:5.</ref> At least in one reference it is believed to be an error by the copyist of the Aleppo Codex, and is not generally practised by any community in Israel, namely, that of writing '''היא''' in Leviticus 25:10–12 ('''יובל היא''') with a ''yod'' ('''י''') instead of a ''waw'' ('''ו''').<ref>Offer, Joseph (1989), p. 312 [36].

Nevertheless, the right thing is to scrupulously attend to the matter, just as it appears in the ''Composition'' (i.e. Mishne Torah), in the Book of ''Ahavah'', but whatsoever is found to be different from it, no one is to give judgment concerning it that it is invalid, unless it is different from all the books that are in existence.\"<ref>[[Abraham Maimuni]] (1937), ''responsum'' # 91 (pp.{{nbsp}}134–135)</ref>\n\n==Treating of leather and ink used in Torah scroll==\nIn Yemen, large goats (2 yrs. old) were used in making the parchment for Torah scrolls, as opposed to ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries) in which only small kids of the goats (appx. 2 months old) were used for the vellum.<ref>In Yemen, small kids of the goats, approximately two months old, were used for vellum (kalaf) in making Tefillin.  It was not necessary to split the leather, in this case, since it was already very thin. The custom in treating leather hides that were to be used for the books of the Law and for the scroll of Esther was, indeed, to put them into an astringent solution of a gall-like substance extracted from the leaves of acacia (Arabic: ''qaradh''). However, the vellum (kalaf) used in writing the Tefillin was never treated with any gall-like substance. (The reason being that leather, when treated with gall or similar substances, constricts and usually takes on a darker colour. Although this treatment gives the leather its durability , it makes writing on such parchment very difficult, as the ink tends to glide on the parchment and is not absorbed so readily into the leather. This makes writing the four portions of scripture in the Tefillin all the more difficult, since the strips of parchment were very small in order that they might be inserted within the phylactery boxes. For this reason, in Yemen as in other places of world Jewry, the leather used in writing the four portions of scripture for the Tefillin went without the treatment of gall, and was subsequently white.)</ref> In Torah scrolls, the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the ''salam''-tree (''Acacia etbaica''; ''A. nilotica kraussiana''), a tree known locally by the name ''qaraḍ'' (''garadh''). The same tannin substance and its use in treating leather for sacred scrolls is mentioned by [[Maimonides]] (1989:298). These leaves, being astringent, have the same function as gall.<ref>Gall substances used in tanning leather is a requisite according to many exponents of Jewish law, such as the author of the lexicon, ''[[Sefer Ha-Arukh]]'', and [[Maimonides]], and [[Rabbeinu Hananel]], and Rabbi [[Hai Gaon]], and the [[Sheëltot]] of Rabbi Achai of Shibha. The gall gives the leather its lasting durability. The Shulhan Arukh of Maran, on the other hand, writes that it is sufficient to treat leather with lime alone. Leaves from the ''salam''-tree (Ar. ''qarat'') were crushed and put within a bath of water. The untreated leather was added to this solution for a period of 15 days, the time allotted for its preparation. After the first 8 days of soaking, the leaves are changed with a batch of fresh leaves. After another 7–8 days, the leather was ready for use. The ''salam''-tree leaves give the leather a reddish-tinge. The tree, known locally as ''qarāḍ'', grows plenteous in the coastal areas of Arabia and Oman.</ref> A bath solution of the crushed leaves of this tree, into which raw leather had been inserted for prolonged soaking, would take only 15 days for curing. The water and leaves, however, required changing after seven or eight days, and the leather needed to be turned over daily. Usually such treatment would suffice, without the need of spreading any other salve onto the leather,<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1989), p.{{nbsp}}962 </ref> but only in cases where there was an erasure and the newly applied ink would spread would scribes in Yemen practise \"[[sizing]]\" of the leather, a process so-called by treating the leather parchment with a paste of [[Tragacanth gum]] ({{lang-ar|'''كثيراء'''}}) or [[Gum arabic]], and allowing the place to dry before applying ink.\n\nAccording to [[Amram Qorah]], the way in which leather was prepared in Yemen for use in writing a Torah scroll was as follows: \n:If it were whole leather (Heb. ''[[Gevil|ğawīl]]'') that the scribe wanted to write a Torah scroll upon, he would go to the tanner, select for himself sheep hides that had been treated (cured) to his satisfaction, and the tanner would sell them to him in their imperfect state, without trimming and without modification. The scribe then brings them to his house, softens them by sprinkling water upon them, and then spreads them out and stretches them, and then smooths the face of the leather on its flesh side, by scraping it with an instrument called a [[rasp]] (Arabic: ''mibshara''). Afterwards, he cuts away the excessive edges and the outer corners, until he is left with a square sheet of leather. He then stains the sheet [of leather] with a dye solution made of [[turmeric]], which resembles the colour of [[saffron]], and then marks on the two ends of the sheet of parchment with the aid of a tool called a ruler the number of lines that are customarily made, and thus he delineates lines after he had rubbed the face of the leather on the side facing the hairs, with a smooth stone, in a scrupulous manner, so that it will be fitting and make writing easier. He then divides the columns<ref>As a first resort, no sheet of parchment has less than three columns, and no more than eight columns. See: Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (2000), p.148 (§ 165:9)</ref> and, forthwith, begins his task [of writing].\n:[As for the parchment known as [[Klaf|''q'laf'']]] (the leather that is not whole, and used mainly for writing the portions contained in the [[Tefillin]]), most scribes were skilled in treating leather for use as ''q'laf''. The scribe does all those steps mentioned in the working of ''ğawīl'', and smooths the face of the leather on its flesh side, for the space of what is needed to write upon [and no more], leaving it white, without dyeing it any colour.\"<ref>[[Amram Qorah|Qorah, A.]] (1987), p. 99</ref>   \n\nIn Yemen, scribes prepared their own ink concoction, usually made from soaking [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulphate]] crystals ([[Atramentum|copper vitriol]]) in water, known locally as ''zāğ'' ({{lang-ar|زاج}}), but more often by mixing in the water ''al-ḥura'' (Litharge of alum),<ref>A yellowish-white mineral having the same property as vitriol, and which turns the water black. It was derived from a saline earth found in the ravines and gulches of Yemen. The same earth, when extracted, was usually mixed with alum. The alum was then cleansed of its litharge until it became white. The litharge was then taken up and mixed with water to produce a black dye. In this, the Yemenites did not follow the teaching of Maimonides who wrote that the ink must not be indelible. The use of vitriol made the ink indelible.</ref> ''qishr rumān'' (Pomegranate rinds), ''ʿafaṣ'' ([[Gall]]), ground to a powder and steeped in water and exposed to the sun's rays for two or three days, sifted of its residue and its yellowish liquid added to the ink concoction only near the time of writing, and after the ink had once again been allowed to sit in the sun for more than a day in order to receive its luster. An excessive amount of gall was seen as detrimental to the ink, therefore, used sparingly, as also too many pomegranate rinds will cause the ink to fade. A little sugar was also added to the ink concoction, as well as soot from burnt oils and ''ṣameġ'' ([[Gum Arabic]]).<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1989), p. 965</ref> In some places, wormwood ([[Artemisia absinthium]]), or what is called in Arabic ''shiba'', was added to the ink to preserve the leather from mold and mildew. The traditional writing instrument in Yemen was the [[Arundo donax|cane reed]] (calamus), rather than the feathered [[quill]].<ref>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (2000), pp.{{nbsp}}150–151</ref>\n\n==Forms of the letters and special techniques==\nJust as there is a unique style of writing associated with Ashkenazi scrolls, and another style for Sephardic scrolls, so too is there a style of writing that is peculiar to Yemenite scribes of the previous centuries. Each community, however, makes use of the square Hebrew script. In some scrolls of Yemenite provenance, there was not a practice among scribes to write the Hebrew letters with their ''[[Tag (Hebrew writing)|Tagim]]'', since the accurate tradition of doing so had long been lost. The ancient practice in Yemen when writing the letter ''ḥet'' ('''ח''') is to make its roof flat, and not a \"gable-roof,\" as prescribed by [[Rabbeinu Tam]] (Yaakov Meir), although more modern scrolls have adopted Rabbeinu Tam's method. The difference stems from one's understanding of the word '''חטרי''' in Tractate ''[[Menahot|Menaḥoth]]''.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] ([http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37966&st=&pgnum=475&hilite= ''Menaḥot'' 29b]), ''Tosafot'', s.v. '''דחטריה'''.</ref> In Yemenite scrolls, the Hebrew letters are made to suspend a fraction below the ruled lines, rather than hang directly from the ruled lines.\n\nThe manner in which Jewish scribes made certain Hebrew characters has evolved throughout the years in Yemen. Rabbi [[David ben Zimra]] (1479–1573) mentions the practice of the Jews of [[Aden]], where in all their Torah scrolls the left leg of the Hebrew character ''he'' ('''ה''') was slightly joined to the roof of the letter, a practice which he disqualifies, although admitting that such was also the practice that he found in old scrolls written in Egypt, and which practice had been rendered valid by Rabbi [[Isaac ben Sheshet]] and Rabbi [[Joseph Colon Trabotto|Joseph Colon]].<ref>[[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|Ben Zimrah, David]] (1972), part ii, ''responsum'' # 596</ref> Nevertheless, the old practice in Yemen of slightly joining the leg of the Hebrew character ''he'' ('''ה''') to its roof, or the leg of the ''qof'' ('''ק''') to its roof, eventually evolved to conform with the custom that is practised in other communities in Israel. Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]], commenting on Maimonides' ''Mishne Torah'', responds to the old practice and goes to great lengths to show that such letters, had they been written in such a way, should not be disqualified, although the custom in Israel has now changed.<ref>[[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1985), ''Hil. Sefer Torah'' 10:1 (note 8). Qafih wrote:  \"...If a letter touched itself in a place where its shape is not made entirely corrupt thereby, and [if] it does not resemble a different letter, it is [still] valid... And if it is a questionable matter, they bring a young child who is neither wise, nor unintelligent, just as it is explained in the Gemara (''Menahoth'' 29b). So it is our custom to render valid anything similar to these cases, and even as a first resort they are [permitted] to read in a scroll of the Law that has in it such joining, and it is not necessary to amend it. Look at [[Yihya Saleh|Saleh, Y.]] (1979b), vol. 3, ''responsum'' # 213, who wrote in the name of Rabbi [[Levi ibn Habib|Levi, the son of Habib]] (HaRalbach), who quotes in turn from the [[Menachem Meiri|Meiri]] in ''Qiryat Sefer''. And even if the left leg of the letter ''he'' ('''ה''') was found clinging to its rooftop, with [only] a slight joining and not a considerable one, so long as the shape of the [Hebrew] letter ''he'' ('''ה''') is [still] recognizable and a young child reads it as the letter ''he'', it is valid. So did Rabbi [[Simeon ben Zemah Duran|Shimon Bar Tzemach]] (the ''Tashbetz'') write in the second volume [of his Questions & Responsa], section # 73. Moreover, even if the entire scroll was written from the start in this way, it is valid and does not require being amended. And he brings down proof from that which is written in [Tractate] ''Menahoth'' [29b], that the more meticulous scribes would hang the [left] leg of the letter he. By this wording we learn that only as a first rule of thumb, being of a more superlative nature, was it stated, and not that it is indispensable... Be apprised, [moreover], that in the ancient Torah scrolls of Yemen the leg of the letter ''qof'' ('''ק''') was joined to its roof, and in this manner was [written] the scroll of the Law known as \"Tam,\" which was in the village Qaryat al-Qabil.  All of the legs of the letter ''qof'' were joined to their roof. And so were the ancient scrolls of the Law in Tunis and Tripoli made, just as Rabbi Shimon Bar Tzemach (the ''Tashbetz'') wrote in a ''responsum'', vol. I, [''responsum''] # 50. Look there, for he went to great lengths to prove that it is valid. And there, in ''responsum'' # 51, he brought evidence from the words of Rabbi [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] that in this manner were [written] the scrolls of the Law in Spain. Wherefore, [such a scroll] is valid as a first resort.\"</ref>\n\nOne of the unique features found in scrolls penned in Yemen is the practice of marking the end of the biblical verse, not with ink, but by stamping the leather with a round-tipped metal instrument at the end of the verse, in order to assist the ''baal qoré'' when reading and knowing when he is to come to a full-stop. These dot-like impressions in the leather were made so as to resemble an inverted ''segol'' (one dot on top of two dots). Where the reading was to produce the sound made by the trope symbol ''[[Etnachta|etnaḥa]]'' (brief pause), it too was marked with only one dot by the same instrument beneath the word whose reading is to be read as such. Two diagonal stamp marks were made above the word whose reading called for it to be read with a ''[[Cantillation#Names in different traditions|zarqa]]''. Some have questioned the validity of marking a Torah scroll in this way, but the sages of Yemen have explained its validity by saying that extraneous markings that are made in the leather without ink are permitted.<ref>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (1989), responsa # 126 and 127, pp.{{nbsp}}301–303; [http://www.maharitz.co.il/?CategoryID=300&ArticleID=2891&Page=2 The Validity of Torah Scrolls that are Stamped with Dots] (Hebrew), being a review of the subject by Rabbi Yitzhaq Ratzaby; Qorah, Shelomoh (2012), pp. 130–ff.</ref><ref>Cf. [[Shulchan Aruch]] (''[[Yoreh De'ah]]'' §274:7 [6]): \"A book [of the Law] that is punctuated is invalid, and even if they had removed from it the punctuation symbols; so, too, a division of verses [in the Torah] is invalid.\" '''Addenda''' ([[Moses Isserles]]): \"And this refers, specifically, to when he made the biblical cantillation symbol with ink, etc.\"</ref>  \n\nYemenite Torah scrolls traditionally had also the additional feature where the top corners of each leather sheet of parchment were folded backwards, immediately following the leather's treatment and before the actual writing.<ref>Ratzaby, Yitzhaq (2000), p. 148 (§ 165:9 - note 30)</ref> This was done to distinguish between each sheet, as also to give the reader the ability to grasp with his two hands the sheet of parchment by the folds, without touching the letters themselves. The left and right margins of each sheet of parchment were made to a standard width of one-fingerbreadth (ca. 2.5 [[Centimetre|cm]].), and when coupled together with other sheets, the margins came to two fingerbreadths.<ref>[[Zohar Amar|Amar, Z.]] (2017), p. 45; cf. [[Yosef Qafih|Qafih, Y.]] (1985), chapter 9:2, note 4, who cites the [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Menaḥot'' 30a) for the basis of this ancient practice.</ref> The stitching of the sheets of parchment together was made differently from the practices found among other groups, in that the stitching made with ligaments was made closer together (appx. one centimeter between stitches) and more tightly fitting in Yemenite scrolls.<ref>[[Zohar Amar|Amar, Z.]] (2017), p. 45</ref>\n\n===Torah cases===\nThe Torah case (Heb. ''tiq'') traditionally used in Yemen was either a seven faceted or octagonal wooden box, typically made of a light wood, such as Sudanese teak ([[Cordia abyssinica]]), equipped with a pair of brass clasps cut in ornamental floral shapes for closing. The entire wooden box was fitted tightly with a thickly woven decorative cloth, replete with 3 to 5 buttons with matching loops. The top of the box was made with slits wherein they inserted protruding staves for carrying the decorative silver [[finials]] (Heb. ''rimmonim'').<ref>Muchawsky-Schnapper, Ester (1999), pp. 122–123</ref>\n\n==Testimonials==\n[[Yaakov Sapir]] (1822–1886), a Lithuanian Jewish scholar from Jerusalem, was commissioned by the Jerusalem Rabbinate and traveled to Egypt, to Yemen and to India between the years 1857 to 1863. In 1859, he visited the Jewish community in [[Yemen]], publishing an account of his travels soon thereafter in a book entitled, ''Iben Sapir'', perhaps one of the most momentous travelogues ever to have been written in that century, and where he describes the life of the Jewish community there. He also described the Torah scrolls and codices had in Yemen and their peculiar tradition of orthography, an excerpt of which follows.<ref>[[Jacob Saphir|Sapir, J.]] (1866), chapter ''Ḥadrei Teman''</ref>\n{{hidden begin|style=\"border:1px solid #aaa\"|title={{center|Yaakov Sapir on the Tradition of Orthography in Yemen}}}}\n\nAnd lo, in their books of the Torah there are to be found several differences in ''defective'' and ''plene'' letters, for example: ''minnaso''  <small>(Gen. 4:13)</small>, [in the  verse, \"My iniquity is greater than I can bear,\"] lacks a ''waw''; [or] ''maʻayanoth'' <small>(Gen. 7:11)</small> [in the verse, \"All of the fountains of the deep were opened,\"] lacks a ''waw''; [as well as] ''wiyiheyu kol yamei noaḥ'' <small>(Gen. 9:28)</small>, [in the verse, \"And all of the days of Noah were,\" etc., is written] with the addition of a ''waw'' at its end; ''teʻaseh'' <small>(Exo. 25:31)</small>, [in the verse, \"Of beaten work shall the candlestick be made,\"]  lacks a ''yod''; ''ḥodsheikhem'' <small>(Num.10:10)</small>, [in the verse, \"Your new moons,\" etc., is written] with the addition of a ''yod''; as also in the lay-out of the [[Song of the Sea]] <small>(Exo.15: 1-ff.)</small> and in certain closed sections [of the Law]. And I saw that all their ancient books were [written] in this way.\n\n<small>(A note appended later by R. Yaakov Sapir to the above section reads as follows:)</small>\n\nI do recall my faults this day. When I had taken with me a scroll of the Torah [written] in the handwriting of the scriveners of Yemen, and when I had proofread it, I found in it the differences that I formerly mentioned, as well as other [changes] – besides that which can be attributed to scribal error, and I corrected it after the manner of our own books. Then when I happened to be, afterwards, in Paris during [the month of] Tishri, 5625 ''[[anno mundi]]'' (1865 CE), I saw a book in the library of that great personage, the savant and honorable teacher and Rabbi, Rabbi Hertz Ginsburg (may his light shine), which [library] stood under the supervision of my beloved friend, the wise and illustrious Rabbi, [even] our teacher the Rabbi, S. Zacks (may his light shine), a most dear manuscript made by the Rabbi [who is known as] ''[[Menachem Meiri|the Meiri]]'', of blessed memory, [and which book was entitled], ''Kiryat Sefer''.{{efn|name=a}}\n \nIts name is derived from [its content, which treats on] all the laws governing the scroll of the Law, how it ought to be written, and how read, therein showing all of the ''defective'' [letters], and ''plene'' [letters],{{efn|name=b}} open sections and closed sections, [etc., which scribes are wont to make in a scroll of the Law] – nothing being left undone, whether small or great, which he did not bring out in that book. He has withal done far more than what could ever have been expected, whether it were of any man who came before him, or who should come after him.\nNow I shall copy here, in short, an outline of the matters from one of the chapters, being useful for the purport [of our discourse], and whose words are as follows:\n\n\"Now behold, herein, do I make a copy{{efn|name=c}} of the writing which the forenamed Rabbi (i.e. the ''Ramah'',{{efn|name=d}} of blessed memory) sent to the sages of [[Burgos, Spain|Burgos]] [in Spain] who had belabored themselves on this point (i.e. over the subject of proofreading the scroll of the Law) with a well-known book [of the Law] attributed to Hillel the elder, [and] which was called by them ''Halleujah''.\"{{efn|name=e}}\n  \nThe [author of the book] ''Yuchasin''{{efn|name=f}} wrote these words: \"Now in the year 4956 ''[[anno mundi]]'' (1196 CE), on the 8th of Menaḥem Av, there fell out a great religious persecution in the kingdom of [[León, Spain|León]],{{efn|name=g}} to the extent that they carried away from there a Codex containing the 24 canonical books of the Bible, called the ''Biblia'', which R. Hillel{{efn|name=h}} had written, and from which they would proofread the texts of all the scrolls. Now I saw some of them (i.e. scrolls) that were sold in Africa, and at my time, they were nine-hundred years old since the time they were first written.\"{{efn|name=i}} The [same author of the book] ''Yuchasin'', on the year 5250 ''anno mundi'' (1490 CE), wrote: ''ha-Qimḥi''{{efn|name=j}} (c. 1160–c. 1235) said in his ''Piece on Grammar'', in the chapter ''lemaʻan tizkaru'', that the Codex was in Toledo [of Spain], and [that it was found written after its prescription] in the books [of the Law] left by the early Geonim, [particularly] by Rav [[Sherira Gaon|Sherira]] [Gaon] and Rabbeinu [[Hai Gaon|Hai]] [Gaon]. And when the books of Rabbeinu Moshe (i.e. [[Maimonides]], of blessed memory) came amongst them and they saw his tradition of orthography{{efn|name=k}} in this regard, they sent to him (i.e. to the ''Ramah'') and he answered them after [much] flowery speech and many praises, whose words were these: 'But presently I shall tell you the truth, that all the books that have reached us of those books written by Rabbeinu Moshe (Maimonides), may peace rest on him, with regard to open sections and closed sections, all of them were engrossed with different errors one from the other, since the words of the book were concealed [from understanding], and those copyists who copied from it made rash decisions on their own, and each one added [what he pleased], and diminished [from the true text] according to his own understanding, thus defacing the books with things that they imagined in their heart to be true, and which they gave their opinion to, but which I was compelled to investigate and make inquiry into, etc., etc. And so, I sent to [[Marseilles]], to the most erudite man [there], [[Samuel Ibn Tibbon]],{{efn|name=l}} the physician, and I asked him to send me an [accurate] account of the closed and open sections from the book [of the Law] that was copied from the book [of the Law] belonging to that Rabbi (i.e. Maimonides) that came with him to Marseilles, and which said Rabbi (may his memory be blessed) had signed in his own handwriting; as also that which I, myself, had written down from the book (that was no longer before me), ''I am Moshe, the son of Rabbi Maimon the Sepharadi''. And so did he do, sending them to me with due speed, and I found in the copy of the writing, etc. all the things that you brought to my attention for a decision [as touching the writings of Maimonides] that they were [indeed] true, etc. and that the other matters that were concealed [therein from our understanding] were not made clear unto me by that book until I was compelled to once again search and inquire [into them], etc., and it was revealed unto me their import{{efn|name=m}} by the help of Him who favors man with understanding. Now, behold! They are written in this [leafed] booklet which is being sent to you, etc., [both] open and closed [sections], [and] that which is neither an open [section] nor a closed [section], but rather an arranged [section],{{efn|name=n}} in my own handwriting. Likewise, I have written for you the lay-out of the [prosaic] song ''[[Ha'azinu]]''{{efn|name=o}} in two categories: one, containing the names of words that come at the beginning of each line; the other, containing the names of words that come at the end of each line. (Now there are altogether sixty-seven lines [in the prosaic song ''Ha'azinu''], just as it is found in my handwritten Bible Codex, and in [copies of] Maimonides of [those made by the] early exponents of our laws…) … [Signed]: From him that has been afflicted with reproof of instruction, not with whips, ''per se'', but with scorpions, until he was compelled to confess his sorrow unto many – perchance they will seek mercy upon him from Him who has mercy; [I], who writes to his friends and companions, '''Meir Halevi, the son of R. Todros'''.' \"\n\nAnd, there, the Rabbi who is ''the Meiri'', of blessed memory, writes more, [''viz''.], that in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] [of Spain] there was a book [of the Law] called ''the Book of Ezra'',{{efn|name=p}} and a certain Codex that was copied from the Codex belonging to the ''Ramah'' (i.e. [[Meir Abulafia|Meir ha-Levi b. Todros Abulafia]], c. 1165–1244), whom we mentioned, which [latter] was proofread many times with utmost diligence by several scribes and wise men, in the forenamed city, with painstaking care and great expense, and came afterwards into his hand{{efn|name=q}} with all the testimonies of the proofreaders and scribes, and, based on it, he wrote in this, his own book ''Kiryat Sefer'', every word which is either ''defective'' or ''plene'', open and closed sections, in the year of the exile of [[France]], which corresponds to the year 5066 ''anno mundi'' (1306 CE). Unto here we have brought down his words. Now, behold! I have found [and] seen in this [book], ''Kiryat Sefer'', exactly as it is found written in the scrolls of Yemen! (q.v. ''supra'', the treatise on Egypt, where I have elaborated in great length about all their details.) And so, in vain have I erased and made corrections. Now if I had seen it beforehand, I would not have touched it [with my own] hand! But He is merciful [and] atones for iniquity… END\n\n'''Original:'''\n\nוהנה בס\"ת שלהם נמצא כמה שנויים בחסר ויתר כמו מנשא (בראשית ד' י\"ג) ח\"ו מעינת (נח ז' י\"א) ח\"ו ויהיו כל ימי נח (נח ט' כ\"ח) בואו לאחרונה תעשה (תרומה כ\"ה ל\"א) ח\"י חדשיכם (בהעלותך י' י') מ\"י וכן בצורת שירת הים ובאיזה סתומות * וראיתי שכל ספריהם הקודמים כן הוא\n\n(המחבר הוסיף הערה זו בעת הדפוס)\n\nאת חטאי אני מזכיר היום כי הבאתי עמי ס\"ת מכתיבת סופרי תימן וכאשר הגהתיה מצאתי בה השנויים הנז' ועוד (לבד איזה טעות סופר) ותיקנתיה עפ\"י ספרים שלנו. ובהיותי אח\"כ תשרי תרכ\"ה בפאריז ראיתי בבית עקד הספרים של הגביר האדיר החכם הנכבד מו\"ה הירץ גינצבורג נ\"י העומדת תחת יד ידי\"נ הרב החכם המפואר מוהר\"ש זאקש נ\"י ספר כ\"י יקר להרב המאירי ז\"ל קרית ספר. שמו על כל דיני ס\"ת כתיבתו וקריאתו ומצויין בו כל החסרות ויתרות ופתוחות וסתומות לא הניח דבר קטון וגדול שלא העלה בספר הזה והוא מפליא לעשות מכל אשר לפניו ולאחריו. ואעתיק בזה בקיצור ריש מילין מפרק אחד הנצרך לענינינו וז\"ל: \"והריני כותב כאן כתב שלחו הרב הנזכר (הרמ\"ה ז\"ל) לחכמי בורגיש שטרחו על זה (בהגהת ס\"ת) עם ספר הידוע להלל הזקן שנקרא ביניהם הללויה.

The extended Arial type family includes more styles: Rounded (Light, Regular, Bold, Extra Bold); Monospaced (Regular, Oblique, Bold, Bold Oblique). Many of these have been issued in multiple font configurations with different degrees of language support. The most widely used and bundled Arial fonts are Arial Regular, Italic, Bold, and Bold Italic; the same styles of Arial Narrow; and Arial Black. More recently, Arial Rounded has also been widely bundled.\n\nIn Office 2007, Arial was replaced by [[Calibri]] as the default typeface in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], and [[WordPad]].\n\n== Design characteristics ==\n[[File:Arial 215 comparison.png|thumb|A comparison of Arial, Helvetica and Monotype Grotesque 215 scaled to equivalent cap height showing the most distinctive characters.

The overall treatment of curves is softer and fuller than in most industrial style sans serif faces.  Terminal strokes are cut on the diagonal which helps to give the face a less mechanical appearance.  Arial is an extremely versatile family of typefaces which can be used with equal success for text setting in reports, presentations, magazines etc, and for display use in newspapers, advertising and promotions.}}\n\nIn 2005, Robin Nicholas said, \"It was designed as a generic sans serif; almost a bland sans serif.\"<ref name=\"MacUser\" /><ref>{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Joe|title=Upload of Macuser|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/4901460991/in/photostream/|website=Flickr|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nArial is a neo-grotesque typeface: a design based on the influence of nineteenth-century sans-serifs, but made more regular and even to be more suited to continuous body text and to form a cohesive family of fonts.\n\nApart from the need to match the character widths and approximate/general appearance of Helvetica, the letter shapes of Arial are also strongly influenced by Monotype's own [[Monotype Grotesque]] designs, released in or by the 1920s, with additional influence from 'New Grotesque', an abortive redesign from 1956.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Arial Addendum no. 3|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/10/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94arial-addendum-no-3/|website=Blue Pencil|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw (& Nicholas)|title=Arial addendum no. 4|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/11/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94arial-addendum-no-4/|website=Blue Pencil|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"arial_dead\" /><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Monotype Imaging|url=http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/RobinNicholas/Samples.aspx?type=samp3|title=Type Designer Showcase: Robin Nicholas – Arial|accessdate=2011-05-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714113415/http://www.monotypeimaging.com/ProductsServices/TypeDesignerShowcase/RobinNicholas/Samples.aspx?type=samp3|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The designs of the ''R'', ''G'' and ''r'' also resemble [[Gill Sans]]. The changes cause the typeface to nearly match [[Mergenthaler Linotype Company|Linotype]] [[Helvetica]] in both proportion and weight (see figure), and perfectly match in width.<ref name=\"Scourge\" /> Monotype executive Allan Haley observed, \"Arial was drawn more rounded than Helvetica, the curves softer and fuller and the counters more open.

[[Arial Unicode MS]] uses monotone stroke widths on [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic glyphs]], similar to [[Tahoma (typeface)|Tahoma]].\n\nThe Cyrillic, Greek and [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] Spacing Modifier Letters glyphs initially introduced in Arial Unicode MS, but later debuted in Arial version 5.00, have different appearances.\n\n== History ==\n\n[[IBM]] debuted two printers for the in-office publishing market in 1982: the 240-[[dots per inch|DPI]] 3800-3 [[laser printer|laserxerographic printer]], and the 600-DPI 4250 electro-erosion laminate typesetter.<!-- \nBEGIN LONG REFERENCE BLOCK\n--><ref name=\"Boag\" >{{cite mailing list|title=Have you ever thought about the LaserWriter fonts and how you got them?|mailinglist=Typo-L|date=14 Oct 1996|last=Boag|first=Andrew|url=http://www.xnet.se/xpo/typetalk/|accessdate=9 May 2011}} \"Monotype's first contract for the IBM 4250 included [...] Helvetica (sub-licensed from Lino) [...] When it came to the 3800 laser printer I think IBM wanted a functional equivalent to Helvetica to save on the licensing wrangles, and this is when the Arial bitmaps were first created.

      "text": "{{For|Koren Publishers|Koren Publishers Jerusalem}}\n'''Koren Type''' refers to two Hebrew fonts, Koren Bible Type and Hebrew Book Type created by Israeli typographer and graphic designer [[Elyahu Koren]]. Koren created Koren Bible Type for the specific purpose of printing The Koren Bible, published by [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] in 1962. He created Koren Book Type for The Koren Siddur (Prayerbook), which the publishing house produced in 1981.\n\n==Koren Bible Type==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Wikipediaimages.3.jpeg|thumb|225px|Eliyahu Koren at work on the Koren Bible Type {{deletable image-caption|Monday, 11 January 2010}}]] -->\n[[Judah L. Magnes]], President of The [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]] asked Eliyahu Koren, then Korngold, to create a new font for an entirely new edition of the Hebrew [[Bible]] that he sought to publish under the University's auspices during World War II. The Bible was to be the first Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by Jews in nearly 500 years. A design competition was held, and Korngold's font won.\n\nThe preliminary version of the font that grew out of the competition was used in an edition of the Book of Jonah issued in 1946 by the publishing house of The Hebrew University (later Magnes Press). The font was not cast for this modest publication, but rather drawn by Korngold and reproduced photographically. The font was based on the Moshe Ben-Asher Codex of the Prophets manuscript, belonging to the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] community in Cairo, the earliest Medieval manuscript with a [[Colophon_(publishing)|colophon]], written in 895 CE in [[Tiberias]].\n\nFollowing the Hebrew University's decision to publish a different edition of the Bible in 1953, Korngold resigned from the University Bible Committee and took over the initiative of producing a new, fully Jewish Bible with a new font.\n\nKorngold set out to design the most readable Hebrew font possible. He consulted Dr. Arie Feigenbaum, an ophthalmologist, who shared with him research conducted on the legibility of Latin book types. Korngold made clear distinctions between similar letters such as bet and kaf, gimel and nun, dalet and resh. He believed that each letter should be recognizable even if only its top 1/3 were visible. He also believed that designers should learn from the earliest printers and typographers, who based their fonts on fine handwriting.\n\nThe final design was the result of Korngold's study and re-study of Hebrew manuscripts and early printing types, and a sensitive approach to modernization that maintained serifs and shading (the contrast of thick and thin elements of the letter).\n\nThe Koren Bible Type was cast in 36-point by [[Deberny & Peignot]], the largest typefounding firm in France, over the course of two years. The type arrived in Israel in 1957, and a proof page was printed at Ahva Press. Korngold (now Koren), disappointed by the result, insisted that the foundry redo the type due to a loss of character in the letters' corners. The foundry agreed, after their microscopic examination proved that the Koren type was off by .03 millimeters.\n\n===Koren Book Type===\nEliyahu Koren created Koren Book Type for use in the [[Koren Siddur]], published in 1981.\n\nKoren Type has been used in publications of Koren Publishers Jerusalem ever since, as well as in other important texts. The Jewish Braille Institute of America has used Koren Type for books published for the partially sighted.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tabletmag.com/life-and-religion/8297/prayer-type/ \"Prayer Type: How Eliyahu Koren used typography to encourage a new way to pray,\" ''Tablet Magazine'', June 30, 2009]\n\n[[Category:Hebrew typefaces]]"

It expresses the [[Primitive Irish]] [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] phoneme. The 14th century ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' glosses the name as ''aball'', meaning \"[[apple tree]]\". Its phonetic value is {{IPA|[kʷ]}}.\n\nThe ''[[Bríatharogam]]'' (kennings) for the letter are:\n*''Morainn mac Moín'': ''Clithar baiscill'' ‘the shelter of a lunatic’\n*''Maic ind Óc'': ''Bríg anduini'' ‘substance of an insignificant person’\n*''Con Culainn'': ''Dígu fethail'' ‘dregs of clothing’\n\nMcManus (1991:37) compares it to Welsh ''perth'' ‘thorn bush’, Latin ''quercus'' ‘oak’ ([[PIE]] *''perkwos''). The name was confused with Old Irish ''ceirt'' ‘rag’, reflected in the kennings.\n\nIn the framework of a [[Elder Futhark|runic]] origin of the Ogham, the name has also been compared to the name of the [[Old English language|Anglo Saxon]] [[Futhorc]] ''p''-rune, ''[[Peorð]]'': This name is itself unclear, but most often identified as ‘[[pear]]’, a meaning not unrelated to ‘apple’. The ''p'' letter of the [[Gothic alphabet]] has a cognate name, ''pairþra'', alongside the clearly related ''qairþra'', the name for the Gothic labiovelar. Since an influence of Ogham letter names on Gothic letter names is eminently unlikely, it seems most probable that the [[Proto-Germanic]] ''p'' rune  had a meaning of ‘pear tree’ (''*pera-trewô''?), continued in the Anglo-Saxon ''peorð'' rune (with the meaning of the name forgotten), and was introduced into 4th century Ireland as the name of a rune named after a pear or apple tree. As ''p'' was nonexistent as a phoneme in Primitive Irish, the ''p'' and ''q'' runes would have been considered equivalent.\n\n==References==\n*Damian McManus, ''A Guide to Ogam'', Maynooth 1991.\n\n[[Category:Ogham letters]]"

      "text": "{{Contains Ogham text}}\n{{Table Oghamletters}}\nThe '''''Forfeda''''' are the \"additional\" letters of the [[Ogham]] alphabet, beyond the basic inventory of twenty signs. The most important of these are five ''forfeda'' which were arranged in their own ''aicme'' or class, and were invented in the [[Old Irish]] period, several centuries after the peak of Ogham usage. They appear to have represented sounds felt to be missing from the original alphabet, maybe  ''é(o)'', ''ó(i)'', ''ú(i)'', ''p'' and ''ch''.{{clarify|date=March 2012}}\n\n==The ''aicme'' forfeda==\nThe five ''aicme'' forfeda are glossed in the manuscripts ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' ('The Scholars' Primer),  ''[[De dúilib feda]]'' ('Elements of the Letters') and ''[[In Lebor Ogaim]]'' ('The Book of Ogam'), by several ''[[Bríatharogam|Bríatharogaim]]'' (\"word oghams\" ), or two word [[kenning]]s, which explain the meanings of the names of the letters of the [[Ogham]] alphabet. Three variant lists of ''bríatharogaim'' or 'word-oghams' have been preserved, dating to the [[Old Irish]] period. They are as follows:\n\n*''Bríatharogam Morainn mac Moín''\n*''Bríatharogam Maic ind Óc''\n*''Bríatharogam Con Culainn''\n\nLater Medieval scholars{{Who|date=March 2012}} believed{{Weasel-inline|date=March 2012}} that all of the letter names of the ogham alphabet were those of trees, and attempted to explain the ''bríatharogaim'' in that light. However, modern scholarship{{Which|date=March 2012}} has shown that only eight at most of the original twenty letter names are those of trees, and that the word-oghams or kennings themselves support this. Of the ''forfeda'' letter names, only one may be{{Vague|date=March 2012}} that of a tree or shrub (pín) and their kennings as edited (in normalized Old Irish) and translated by McManus (1988) are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n| align=center colspan=\"3\" | Letter\n| align=center | Meaning\n| align=center | ''Bríatharogam Morainn mac Moín''\n| align=center | ''Bríatharogam Maic ind Óc''\n| align=center | ''Bríatharogam Con Culainn''\n|-\n| ᚕ\n| align=left |EA\n| align=left | Ébhadh\n| align=left | Unknown\n| align=left | ''snámchaín feda'' <br> \"fair-swimming letter\"\n| align=left | ''cosc lobair'' <br> \"[admonishing?] of an infirm person\"\n| align=left | ''caínem éco'' <br> \"fairest fish\"\n|-\n| ᚖ\n| align=left |OI\n| align=left | Óir\n| align=left | 'Gold'\n| align=left | ''sruithem aicde'' <br> \"most venerable substance\"\n| align=left | ''lí crotha'' <br> \"splendour of form\"\n| align=left |\n|-\n| ᚗ\n| align=left |UI\n| align=left | Uilleann\n| align=left | 'Elbow'\n| align=left | ''túthmar fid'' <br> \"fragrant tree\"\n| align=left | ''cubat oll'' <br> \"great elbow/cubit\"\n| align=left |\n|-\n| ᚘ\n| align=left |P, later IO\n| align=left | [[Ifín (letter)|Pín, later Iphín]]\n| align=left | 'Spine/thorn'?\n| align=left | ''milsem fedo'' <br> \"sweetest tree\"\n| align=left | ''amram mlais'' <br> \"most wonderful taste\"\n| align=left |\n|-\n| ᚙ\n| align=left |CH or X, later AE\n| align=left | Eamhancholl\n| align=left | 'Twin-of-hazel'\n| align=left | ''lúad sáethaig'' <br> \"groan of a sick person\"\n| align=left | ''mol galraig'' <br> \"groan of a sick person\"\n| align=left |\n|}\n\nFour of these names are glossed in the Auraicept with tree names, ''ebhadh'' as ''crithach'' \"[[aspen]]\", ''oir'' as ''feorus no edind'' \"[[spindle-tree]] or [[ivy]]\", ''uilleand'' as ''edleand'' \"[[honeysuckle]]\", and ''iphin'' as ''spinan no ispin'' \"[[gooseberry]] or [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]\".\n\nThe kennings for ''Ébhadh'' point to the sound ''éo'' or ''é'', which is also the word for \"[[salmon]]\". The name appears modelled after ''[[Eadhadh]]'' and ''[[Iodhadh]]''. The kennings for ''Ór'' point to the word ''ór'' \"[[gold]]\" (cognate to Latin ''aurum'').  The kenning of ''Uilleann'', \"great elbow\", refers to the letter name. Since the Ogham alphabet dates to the [[Primitive Irish]] period, it had no sign for [p] in its original form and the letter ''Pín'' was added as a letter to express it. McManus states that the name ''Pín'' was probably influenced by Latin ''[[pinus]]'' ('pine'), but a more likely explanation is that it derives from Latin ''spina'' ('thorn'), as the kennings indicate a tree or shrub with sweet tasting fruit (therefore not a pine). According to Kelly (1976) the name ''spín'' ( deriving from the Latin ) appears in the Old Irish tree lists as meaning either gooseberry or thorn, so the medieval glosses may be correct on this occasion. The name ''Eamhancholl'' means \"twinned C\", referring to the shape of the letter. The Bríatharogam kenning \"groan of a sick person\" refers to a value ''ch'' [x], predating the decision that all five ''forfeda'' represent vowels.\n\nApart from the first letter, the forfeda were little used in inscriptions, and this led later ogamists to rearrange them as a series of vowel diphthongs, necessitating a complete change to the sounds of ''Pín'' and ''Eamhancholl'' (the name ''Pín'' also had to be changed to ''Iphín''). This arrangement is how they appear in most manuscripts:\n*<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚕ</span> (U+1695) ''Éabhadh'': ''ea'', ''éo''  ''ea'';\n*<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚖ</span> (U+1696) ''Ór'': ''oi''  ''óe'', ''oi'';\n*<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚗ</span> (U+1697) ''Uilleann'': ''ui'', ''úa'', ''ui'';\n*<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚘ</span> (U+1698) ''Ifín'': ''io''  ''ía'', ''ia'';\n*<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚙ</span> (U+1699)''Eamhancholl'': ''ae''.\n\nThis arrangement meant that once again the ogham alphabet was without a letter for the [p] sound, making necessary the creation of Peith (see below).\n\n===Inscriptions===\nApart from the first letter ''Eabhadh'', the ''forfeda'' do not appear often in orthodox [[ogham inscriptions]]. ''Eabhadh'' was in fact frequently used as part of the formula word KOI ᚕᚑᚔ, but with the value /k/ or /x/. KOI means something like 'here' and is the ogham equivalent of the Latin HIC IACIT (McManus §5.3, 1991). It also appears with its vocalic value in later orthodox inscriptions however. Of the other ''forfeda'' the next three appear only a few times, and the last letter ''Eamhancholl'' does not appear at all. So rare are the other ''forfeda'' in inscriptions that it is worthwhile detailing the individual examples (numbering as given by Macalister):\n\n* ''Óir''. This appears twice, once in an inscription in Killogrone in Co. Kerry (235), which reads ANM M'''Ó'''LEG'''Ó'''MRID MACI VECUMEN ᚛ᚐᚅᚋ ᚋᚖᚂᚓᚌᚖᚋᚏᚔᚇ ᚋᚐᚉᚔ ᚍᚓᚉᚒᚋᚓᚅ᚜; and once in a late inscription on a cross slab at Formaston in Aberdeenshire, which reads MAQQ'''Ó''' TALLUORRH NÉHHTV ROBBAC CÉNNEFF ᚛ᚋᚐᚊᚊᚖ ᚈᚐᚂᚂᚒᚑᚏᚏᚆ ᚅᚓᚆᚆᚈᚍ ᚏᚑᚁᚁᚐᚉ ᚉᚓᚅᚅᚓᚃᚃ᚜.\n*''Uilleann''. This appears only once, in an inscription in Teeromoyle, again in Co. Kerry (240). The inscription reads MOCURRETI MAQI VLISACES'''UI'''CMIR ᚛ᚋᚑᚉᚒᚏᚏᚓᚈᚔ ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚍᚂᚔᚄᚐᚉᚓᚄᚗᚉᚋᚔᚏ᚜.\n*''Pín''. This appears in two, or possibly three, inscriptions. The first is in Cool East on Valencia Island in Co. Kerry (231), and reads LOGITTI MAQI ER'''P'''ENN ᚛ᚂᚑᚌᚔᚈᚈᚔ ᚋᚐᚊᚔ ᚓᚏᚘᚓᚅ᚜. The letter [p] appears as an X shape instead of the 'double X' shape of the letter, presumably because the correct letter shape is quite hard to carve. The second inscription is in Crickowel in Breconshire in Wales (327) and reads TUR'''P'''ILI MOSAC TRALLONI ᚛ᚈᚒᚏᚘᚔᚂᚔ ᚋᚑᚄᚐᚉ ᚈᚏᚐᚂᚂᚑᚅᚔ᚜. Again an X shape is used. The third and final inscription is in Margam in Glamorganshire in Wales (409) and reads '''P'''AM'''P'''ES ᚛ᚘᚐᚋᚘᚓᚄ᚜. However, much of the inscription is broken off and what remains looks like a squat arrowhead. It almost certainly stands for [p] however, as the ogham inscription is accompanied by one in Latin which confirms the sound.\n\n==Other forfeda==\nBeyond the five Forfeda discussed above, which doubtlessly date to [[Old Irish]] times, there is a large number of letter variants and symbols, partly found in manuscripts, and partly in \"scholastic\" (post 6th century) inscriptions collectively termed \"Forfeda\". They may date to [[Old Irish]], [[Middle Irish]] or even early modern times.\n\n===Peith===\nDue to the \"schematicism of later Ogamists\" (McManus 1988:167), who insisted on treating the five primary forfeda as vowels, [p] had again to be expressed as a modification of [b], called ''peithe'', after ''[[beithe]]'', also called ''beithe bog'' \"soft ''beithe''\" or, tautologically, ''peithbog'' (<span style=\"font-size:125%;\">ᚚ</span> ''Peith'', Unicode allocation U+169A).\n\n===Manuscript tradition===\n{{further|Scholastic Ogham}}\n[[Image:Forfeda.png|thumb|350px|The ''forfeda'' of the Ogham scales in the [[Book of Ballymote]] (scale nrs. 79, 80, 81 [http://www.equinox-project.com/v22125.htm][http://www.equinox-project.com/v22126.htm][http://www.equinox-project.com/v22127.htm]) ]]\nThe 7th-12th century ''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' among the 92 \"variants\" of the Ogham script gives more letters identified as ''forfeda'' (variant nrs. 79, 80 and 81).\n\n===Inscriptions===\nThe Bressay stone in [[Shetland]] ([[Celtic Inscribed Stones Project|CISP]] BREAY/1) contains five forfeda, three of them paralleled on other Scottish monuments and also in Irish manuscripts, and two  unique to Bressay. One of the latter is possibly a correction of an error in carving and not intended as a forfid. One is \"rabbit-eared\", interpreted as some kind of modified D, presumably the voiced spirant. Another is an \"angled vowel\", presumably a modified A. One unique character consists of  five undulating strokes sloping backwards across the stem, possibly a modified I. The fourth is a four-stroke cross-hatching, also appearing in the late eighth or ninth-century Bern ogham alphabet and syllabary under a label which has previously been read as RR, but another suggestions is SS. It appears in the [[Book of Ballymote]], scale no. 64.[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/cisp/database/stone/breay_1.html]\n\n==References==\n*Kelly, Fergus 'The Old Irish Tree-list' ''Celtica'' 11 (1976) pp122–3\n*Macalister, Robert A.S.

In [[Old Irish]], the letter name was '''Nin''', a name which is notable for referring both to a specific letter, and to any of the Ogham letters in general.\n{{wiktionary|ᚅ}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nThe glossators of the [[Ogam Tract]] and the [[Auraicept na n-Éces]] seem to refer to at least two Irish words  ''nin'', meaning \"part of a weaver's loom\", and \"a wave\". The corresponding adjective ''ninach'' is glossed as ''gablach'' and used as a synonym of [[cross]], and the  word seems to be roughly synonymous with ''gabul'' \"fork, forked branch\", and is thus a plausible base for a name for \"Ogham letters\", which after all (at least the consonants), look like forks or combs. The second ''nin'' seems to be cognate with Welsh ''nen'' \"roof, heaven\", with a meaning of \"loftiness\", with an adjective ''ninach'' \"lofty\". The kennings are explained by the glossators that weavers' beams were erected as signs of peace. The \"arboreal\" tradition claims the word as [[ash-tree]], concluding that looms were made of ashwood. In some instances, the association with ashwood, which is best known as the raw material for spears, the kenning was amended to \"destruction of peace\". McManus (1988) suggests that the word for \"forked branch\" was applied to the olive branch, the shaking of which in Irish tradition requested an interruption of a battle. The kennings related to beauty, on the other hand, are maybe somehow dependent on the second meaning of \"lofty\".\n\n==Bríatharogam==\nIn the medieval kennings, called ''[[Bríatharogam]]'' or ''Word Ogham'' the verses associated with ''Nin'' are:\n\ncostud síde - \"establishing of peace\"\t in the Word Ogham of ''Morann mic Moín''\n\nbág ban - \"boast of women\"  in the Word Ogham of ''Mac ind Óc''\n\nbág maise - \"boast of beauty\"  in the Word Ogham of ''Culainn''.<ref>[[Auraicept na n-Éces]] Calder, George, Edinburgh, John Grant (1917), reprint Four Courts Press (1995), {{ISBN|1-85182-181-3}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Naudiz]]\n*[[Nun (letter)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Damian McManus, ''Irish letter-names and their kennings'', Ériu 39 (1988), 127-168.\n\n[[Category:Ogham letters]]"

It is an alphabet of [[abjad]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of writing|publisher=Reaktion Books|year=2004|page=90}}</ref> type, consisting of 22 [[consonant]] letters only, leaving vowel sounds implicit, although certain late varieties use ''[[matres lectionis]]'' for some [[vowel]]s. It was used to write [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], a Northern [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language, used by the ancient civilization of [[Phoenicia]] in modern-day [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], and northern [[Israel]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/phoenicia/|title=Phoenicia|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-12}}</ref> \n\nThe Phoenician alphabet, which the Phoenicians adapted from the early West Semitic alphabet<ref>Beyond Babel: A Handbook for Biblical Hebrew and Related Languages, article by Charles R.

[[Modern Hebrew]] script is a stylistic variant of the Aramaic. The [[Greek alphabet]] (with its descendants [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], [[Runic script|Runic]], and [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]]) also derives from the Phoenician.\n\nAs the letters were originally incised with a [[stylus]], they are mostly angular and straight, although cursive versions steadily gained popularity, culminating in the Neo-Punic alphabet of [[Roman-era]] North Africa. \n\nPhoenician was usually written right to left, though some texts alternate directions ([[boustrophedon]]).\n\n== History ==\n{{further information|Abjad}}\n\n=== Origin ===\n{{further information|Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Canaanite script}}\n\nThe earliest known alphabetic (or \"proto-alphabetic\") inscriptions are the so-called [[Proto-Sinaitic script|Proto-Sinaitic (or Proto-Canaanite) script]] sporadically attested in the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and in [[Canaan]] in the late [[Middle Bronze Age|Middle]] and [[Late Bronze Age]]. The script was not widely used until the rise of [[Syro-Hittite|new Semitic kingdoms]] in the 13th and 12th centuries BC.\n\nThe Phoenician alphabet is a direct continuation of the \"Proto-Canaanite\" script of the [[Bronze Age collapse]] period. The so-called [[Ahiram sarcophagus|Ahiram epitaph]], from about 1200 BC, engraved on the sarcophagus of king [[Ahiram]] in Byblos, Lebanon, one of five known [[Byblian royal inscriptions]], shows essentially the fully developed Phoenician script,<ref>Coulmas (1989) p. 141.</ref> although the name \"Phoenician\" is by convention given to inscriptions beginning in the mid 11th century BC.<ref>Markoe (2000) p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Spread of the alphabet and its social effects ===\n{{further information|History of the alphabet}}\nBeginning in the 9th century BC, adaptations of the Phoenician alphabet thrived, including [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Old Italic alphabets|Old Italic]], [[alphabets of Asia Minor|Anatolian]], and the [[Paleohispanic scripts]]. The alphabet's attractive innovation was its phonetic nature, in which [[Phonetic script|one sound was represented by one symbol]], which meant only a few dozen symbols to learn. The other scripts of the time, [[cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], employed many complex [[Character (symbol)|characters]] and required long professional training to achieve proficiency.<ref>Hock and Joseph (1996) p. 85.</ref>\n\nAnother reason for its success was the [[Thalassocracy|maritime trading culture]] of Phoenician merchants, which spread the alphabet into parts of [[North Africa]] and Southern [[Europe]].<ref>Daniels (1996) p. 94-95.</ref> Phoenician inscriptions have been found in [[archaeological]] sites at a number of former Phoenician cities and [[colonies]] around the Mediterranean, such as [[Byblos]] (in present-day [[Lebanon]]) and [[Carthage]] in [[North Africa]]. Later finds indicate earlier use in [[Egypt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/111499sci-alphabet-origin.html|title=Discovery of Egyptian Inscriptions Indicates an Earlier Date for Origin of the Alphabet|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe alphabet had long-term effects on the social structures of the civilizations that came in contact with it. Its simplicity not only allowed its easy adaptation to multiple languages, but it also allowed the common people to learn how to write. This upset the long-standing status of literacy as an exclusive achievement of royal and religious elites, [[Scribe|scribes]] who used their monopoly on information to control the common population.<ref>Fischer (2003) p. 68-69.</ref> The appearance of Phoenician disintegrated many of these [[class division]]s, although many [[Middle Eastern]] kingdoms, such as [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Adiabene]], would continue to use [[cuneiform]] for legal and liturgical matters well into the [[Common Era]].\n\n===Modern rediscovery===\nThe Phoenician alphabet was first uncovered in the 17th century, but up to the 19th century its origin was unknown. It was at first believed that the script was a direct variation of [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s,<ref>Jensen (1969) p. 256.</ref> which had been spectacularly [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#Decipherment|deciphered]] shortly before. However, scholars could not find any link between the two writing systems, nor to [[hieratic]] or [[cuneiform]]. The theories of independent creation ranged from the idea of a single individual conceiving it, to the [[Hyksos]] people forming it from corrupt [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian]].<ref>Jensen (1969) p. 256-258.</ref> It was eventually discovered that the [[Proto-Sinaitic script|proto-Sinaitic alphabet]] was inspired by the model of hieroglyphs.\n\n== Development ==\nThe Phoenician letter forms shown here are idealized: actual Phoenician writing was cruder and less uniform, with significant variations by era and region.\n\nWhen alphabetic writing began in [[Greece]], the letter forms were similar but not identical to Phoenician, and vowels were added to the consonant-only Phoenician letters. There were also distinct [[Archaic Greek alphabets|variants]] of the writing system in different parts of Greece, primarily in how those Phoenician characters that did not have an exact match to Greek sounds were used. The [[Ionic alphabet|Ionic variant]] evolved into the standard Greek alphabet, and the [[Cumae alphabet|Cumae variant]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], which accounts for many of the differences between the two. Occasionally, Phoenician used a short stroke or dot symbol as a word separator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10900.pdf |title=Charts |website=unicode.org |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n{{missing information|section|cladogram for \"other alphabets\" to display relation|date=April 2019|small=yes}}\nThe chart shows the ''graphical'' evolution of Phoenician letter forms into other alphabets. The ''sound'' values also changed significantly, both at the initial creation of new alphabets and from gradual pronunciation changes which did not immediately lead to spelling changes.\n\n<div role=presentation  style=\"max-width:100%; overflow-x: scroll\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" id=\"letters_chart\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Letter\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Name<ref>after {{cite book|first=Steven R.|last=Fischer|year=2001|title=A History of Writing|publisher=Reaction Books|location=London|page=126}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Meaning\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Phoneme]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Origin\n! colspan=\"27\" | Corresponding letter in\n|-\n!

These names were not arbitrary: each Phoenician letter was based on an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an Egyptian word; this word was translated into Phoenician (or a closely related Semitic language), then the initial sound of the translated word became the letter's Phoenician value.<ref>Jensen (1969) p. 262-263.</ref> For example, the second letter of the Phoenician alphabet was based on the Egyptian hieroglyph for \"house\" (a sketch of a house); the Semitic word for \"house\" was [[Bet (letter)|''bet'']]; hence the Phoenician letter was called ''bet'' and had the sound value ''b''.\n\nAccording to a 1904 theory by [[Theodor Nöldeke]], some of the letter names were changed in Phoenician from the Proto-Canaanite script.{{Dubious|date=March 2010}} This includes:\n*''gaml'' \"throwing stick\" to ''gimel'' \"camel\"\n*''digg'' \"fish\" to ''dalet'' \"door\"\n*''hll'' \"jubilation\" to ''he'' \"window\"\n*''ziqq'' \"manacle\" to ''zayin'' \"weapon\"\n*''naḥš'' \"snake\" to ''nun'' \"fish\"\n*''piʾt'' \"corner\" to ''pe'' \"mouth\"\n*''šimš'' \"sun\" to ''šin'' \"tooth\"\n\n[[Yigael Yadin]] (1963) went to great lengths to prove that there was actual battle equipment similar to some of the original letter forms.<ref>Yigael Yadin, ''The Art of Warfare in Biblical Lands''. McGraw-Hill, 1963. The Samech – a quick war ladder, later to become the '$' dollar sign drawing the three internal lines quickly. The 'Z' shaped Zayin – an ancient boomerang used for hunting. The 'H' shaped Het – mammoth tuffs.<!--tusks?--></ref>\n\n==Numerals==\nThe Phoenician numeral system consisted of separate symbols for 1, 10, 20, and 100. The sign for 1 was a simple vertical stroke (𐤖). Other numbers up to 9 were formed by adding the appropriate number of such strokes, arranged in groups of three. The symbol for 10 was a horizontal line or tack ({{Script|Phnx|𐤗}}). The sign for 20 (𐤘) could come in different glyph variants, one of them being a combination of two 10-tacks, approximately Z-shaped. Larger multiples of ten were formed by grouping the appropriate number of 20s and 10s. There existed several glyph variants for 100 (𐤙). The 100 symbol could be multiplied by a preceding numeral, e.g. the combination of \"4\" and \"100\" yielded 400.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n3284.pdf|title=Phoenician numerals in Unicode], [http://www.dma.ens.fr/culturemath/histoire%20des%20maths/htm/Verdan/Verdan.htm Systèmes numéraux|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref> The system did not contain a numeral [[zero]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wichita.edu/history/topics/num-sys.html#greek|title=Number Systems|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Infobox Unicode block\n|blockname = Phoenician\n|rangestart = 10900\n|rangeend = 1091F\n|script1 = Phoenician\n|5_0 = 27\n|5_2 = 2\n|note = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org|title=Unicode character database|work=The Unicode Standard|accessdate=2016-07-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/enumeratedversions.html|title=Enumerated Versions of The Unicode Standard|work=The Unicode Standard|accessdate=2016-07-09}}</ref>\n}}\nThe Phoenician alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in July 2006 with the release of version 5.0.

The current [[Hebrew alphabet]] is a stylized form of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], itself a descendant of the Phoenician script.\n\nThe Aramaic alphabet, used to write [[Aramaic]], is another descendant of Phoenician. Aramaic, being the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Middle East, was widely adopted. It later split off (due to political divisions) into a number of related alphabets, including [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], and [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]], the latter of which, in its cursive form, became an ancestor of the [[Arabic alphabet]] currently used in Arabic-speaking countries from North Africa through the Levant to Iraq and the [[Persian Gulf]] region, as well as in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and other countries.\n\nThe [[Sogdian alphabet]], a descendant of Phoenician via Syriac, is an ancestor of the [[Old Uyghur alphabet|Old Uyghur]], which in turn is an ancestor of the [[Mongolian alphabet|Mongolian]] and [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu]] alphabets, the former of which is still in use and the latter of which survives as the [[Xibe language|Xibe]] script.\n\nThe [[Arabic script]] is a descendant of Phoenician via Aramaic.\n\nThe [[Coptic alphabet]], still used in Egypt for writing the Christian liturgical language Coptic (descended from Ancient Egyptian), is mostly based on the Greek alphabet, but with a few additional letters for sounds not in Greek at the time. Those additional letters are based on Demotic script.\n\n===Derived European scripts===\nAccording to [[Herodotus]],<ref>Herodotus, ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D58%3Asection%3D1 Book V, 58].</ref> the Phoenician prince [[Cadmus]] was accredited with the introduction of the Phoenician alphabet—''phoinikeia grammata'', \"Phoenician letters\"—to the Greeks, who adapted it to form their [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek alphabet]], which was later introduced to the rest of [[Europe]].

It was possibly more important in Greek to write out vowel sounds: Phoenician being a Semitic language, words were based on [[Semitic roots|consonantal roots]] that permitted extensive removal of vowels without loss of meaning, a feature absent in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] Greek. (However, [[Akkadian cuneiform]], which wrote a related Semitic language, did indicate vowels, which suggests the Phoenicians simply accepted the model of the Egyptians, who never wrote vowels.) In any case, the Greeks repurposed the Phoenician letters of consonant sounds not present in Greek; each such letter had its name shorn of its leading consonant, and the letter took the value of the now-leading vowel. For example, [[Aleph|''ʾāleph'']], which designated a [[glottal stop]] in Phoenician, was repurposed to represent the vowel {{IPA|/a/}}; [[He (letter)|''he'']] became {{IPA|/e/}}, [[Heth|''ḥet'']] became {{IPA|/eː/}} (a long vowel), [[Ayin|''ʿayin'']] became {{IPA|/o/}} (because the [[Pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeality]] altered the following vowel), while the two semi-consonants [[wau (letter)|''wau'']] and [[yodh|''yod'']] became the corresponding high vowels, {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/i/}}. (Some dialects of Greek, which did possess {{IPA|/h/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}, continued to use the Phoenician letters for those consonants as well.)\n\n[[Cyrillic script]] was derived from the [[Greek alphabet]]. Some Cyrillic letters (generally for sounds not in Mediaeval Greek) are based on [[Glagolitic]] forms, which in turn were influenced by the Hebrew or even Coptic alphabets.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nThe [[Latin alphabet]] was derived from [[Old Italic alphabet|Old Italic]] (originally a form of the Greek alphabet), used for [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] and other languages. The origin of the [[Runic alphabet]] is disputed: the main theories are that it evolved either from the Latin alphabet itself, some early Old Italic alphabet via the Alpine scripts, or the Greek alphabet. Despite this debate, the Runic alphabet is clearly derived from one or more scripts that ultimately trace their roots back to the Phoenician alphabet.<ref name=\"JG\" /><ref>Spurkland, Terje (2005): ''Norwegian Runes and Runic Inscriptions'', translated by Betsy van der Hoek, Boydell Press, Woodbridge, pp. 3–4</ref>\n\n===Brahmic scripts===\n\n{{See also|Brahmi_script#Semitic_model_hypothesis|label 1=Aramaic hypothesis}}\nMany Western scholars believe that the [[Brahmi script]] of India and the subsequent [[Indic alphabets]] are also derived from the Aramaic script, which would make Phoenician the ancestor of virtually every alphabetic writing system in use today.<ref>Richard Salomon, \"Brahmi and Kharoshthi\", in ''The World's Writing Systems''</ref>\n\nHowever, due to an [[Brahmi script#Indigenous origin hypothesis|indigenous-origin hypothesis]] of Brahmic scripts, no definitive scholarly consensus exists.\n\n==Surviving examples==\n*[[Ahiram sarcophagus]]\n*[[Bodashtart]]\n*[[Çineköy inscription]]\n*[[Cippi of Melqart]]\n*[[Eshmunazar]]\n*[[Karatepe]]\n*[[Kilamuwa Stela]]\n*[[Nora Stone]]\n*[[Pyrgi Tablets]]\n*[[Temple of Eshmun]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arabic alphabet]]\n*[[Aramaic alphabet]]\n*[[Armenian alphabet]]\n*[[Avestan alphabet]]\n*[[Hebrew alphabet]]\n*[[Greek alphabet]]\n*[[Old Turkic script]]\n*[[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]]\n*[[Tanakh at Qumran]]\n*[[Tifinagh]]\n*[[Ugaritic alphabet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Commons|Phoenician alphabet}}\n*[[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]],'' Je m'appelle Byblos'', H & D, Paris, 2005. {{ISBN|2-914266-04-9}}\n* Maria Eugenia Aubet, ''The Phoenicians and the West'' Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, London, 2001.\n* Daniels, Peter T., et al. eds.

It was used to write the [[Aramaic language]] and had displaced the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]], itself a derivative of the Phoenician alphabet, for the writing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The letters all represent [[consonant]]s, some of which are also used as ''[[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'' to indicate long [[vowel]]s.\n\nThe Aramaic [[alphabet]] is historically significant since virtually all [[modern history|modern]] [[Middle East]]ern writing systems can be traced back to it as well as numerous non-[[Chinese characters|Chinese]] writing systems of Central and East Asia. That is primarily from the widespread usage of the Aramaic language as both a ''[[lingua franca]]'' and the official language of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] and [[Neo-Babylonian Empire|Neo-Babylonian]] Empires, and their successor, the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Among the scripts in modern use, the [[Hebrew alphabet]] bears the closest relation to the Imperial Aramaic script of the 5th century BC, with an identical letter inventory and, for the most part, nearly identical letter shapes. The Aramaic alphabet was an ancestor to the Nabataean alphabet and the later Arabic alphabet.\n\nWriting systems (like the Aramaic one) that indicate consonants but do not indicate most vowels other than by means of ''matres lectionis'' or added diacritical signs, have been called [[abjad]]s by [[Peter T. Daniels]] to distinguish them from alphabets, such as the [[Greek alphabet]], which represent vowels more systematically. The term was coined to avoid the notion that a writing system that represents sounds must be either a [[syllabary]] or an alphabet, which would imply that a system like Aramaic must be either a syllabary (as argued by [[Ignace Gelb]]) or an incomplete or [[defective script|deficient alphabet]] (as most other writers have said). Rather, it is a different type.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|left|Bilingual Greek and Aramaic inscription by the [[Mauryan Empire|Mauryan]] emperor [[Ashoka]] at [[Kandahar]], [[Afghanistan]], 3rd century BC.]]\nThe earliest inscriptions in the [[Aramaic language]] use the [[Phoenician alphabet]].<ref>''Inland Syria and the East-of-Jordan Region in the First Millennium BCE before the Assyrian Intrusions'', Mark W. Chavalas, The Age of Solomon: Scholarship at the Turn of the Millennium, ed. Lowell K. Handy, (Brill, 1997), 169.</ref> Over time, the alphabet developed into the form shown below. Aramaic gradually became the ''lingua franca'' throughout the Middle East, with the script at first complementing and then displacing [[Assyrian cuneiform]], as the predominant writing system.\n\n== Achaemenid Empire (The First Persian Empire) ==\nAround 500 BC, following the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] conquest of [[Mesopotamia]] under [[Darius I]], [[Old Aramaic]] was adopted by the Persians as the \"vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast Persian empire with its different peoples and languages. The use of a single official language, which modern scholarship has dubbed as Official Aramaic, Imperial Aramaic or Achaemenid Aramaic, can be assumed to have greatly contributed to the astonishing success of the Achaemenid Persians in holding their far-flung empire together for as long as they did.\"<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|title=Aramaic<!-- pp 250–261 --><!-- section:Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire pp 251–252-->|last=Shaked|first=Saul|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|location=New York|pages=250–261}} p. 251</ref>\n\nImperial Aramaic was highly standardised; its orthography was based more on historical roots than any spoken dialect and was inevitably influenced by [[Old Persian]]. The Aramaic glyph forms of the period are often divided into two main styles, the \"lapidary\" form, usually inscribed on hard surfaces like stone monuments, and a cursive form whose lapidary form tended to be more conservative by remaining more visually similar to Phoenician and early Aramaic. Both were in use through the Achaemenid Persian period, but the cursive form steadily gained ground over the lapidary, which had largely disappeared by the 3rd century BC.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Greenfield|first1=J.C.|editor1-last=Gershevitch|editor1-first=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran: Volume 2|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=709–710|chapter=Aramaic in the Achaemenid Empire}}</ref>\n[[File:Stele Salm Louvre AO5009.jpg|thumb|Stele with dedicatory lapidary Aramaic inscription to the god Salm.

Formerly, Hebrew had been written using an alphabet closer in form to that of Phoenician, the [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet]].\n\n===Aramaic-derived scripts===\nSince the evolution of the Aramaic alphabet out of the Phoenician one was a gradual process, the division of the world's alphabets into the ones derived from the Phoenician one directly and the ones derived from Phoenician via Aramaic is somewhat artificial. In general, the alphabets of the Mediterranean region (Anatolia, Greece, Italy) are classified as Phoenician-derived, adapted from around the 8th century BC, and those of the East (the Levant, Persia, Central Asia and India) are considered Aramaic-derived, adapted from around the 6th century BC from the Imperial Aramaic script of the Achaemenid Empire.\n\nAfter the fall of the Achaemenid Empire, the unity of the Imperial Aramaic script was lost, diversifying into a number of descendant cursives.\n\nThe Hebrew and [[Nabataean alphabet]]s, as they stood by the [[Roman era]], were little changed in style from the Imperial Aramaic alphabet.\n\nA [[cursive Hebrew]] variant developed from the early centuries AD, but it remained restricted to the status of a variant used alongside the noncursive. By contrast, the cursive developed out of the Nabataean alphabet in the same period soon became the standard for writing Arabic, evolving into the [[Arabic alphabet]] as it stood by the time of the early [[Islamic conquests|spread of Islam]].\n\nThe development of cursive versions of Aramaic also led to the creation of the [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Palmyrene alphabet|Palmyrene]] and [[Mandaic alphabet]]s, which formed the basis of the historical scripts of Central Asia, such as the [[Sogdian alphabet|Sogdian]] and [[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] alphabets.<ref name=\"Kara1996\">{{cite book |first=György|last=Kara|chapter=Aramaic Scripts for Altaic Languages|editors=Daniels, Peter T.; Bright, William |title=The World's Writing Systems |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=535–558|year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-507993-7 |title-link=The World's Writing Systems}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Old Turkic script]] is generally considered to have its ultimate origins in Aramaic,<ref>''Babylonian beginnings: The origin of the cuneiform writing system in comparative perspective'', Jerold S.

The near-identity of the Aramaic and the classical Hebrew alphabets caused Aramaic text to be typeset mostly in the standard Hebrew script in scholarly literature.\n\n===Maaloula===\n{{further|Western Neo-Aramaic}}\nIn [[Maaloula]], one of few surviving communities in which a [[Western Neo-Aramaic|Western Aramaic]] dialect is still spoken, an Aramaic institute was established in 2007 by [[Damascus University]] that teaches courses to keep the language alive. The institute's activities were suspended in 2010 amidst fears that the square Aramaic alphabet used in the program too closely resembled the square script of the [[Hebrew alphabet]] and all the signs with the square Aramaic script were taken down. The program stated that they would instead use the more distinct [[Syriac alphabet]], although use of the Aramaic alphabet has continued to some degree.<ref name=\"institute\">{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0402/Easter-Sunday-A-Syrian-bid-to-resurrect-Aramaic-the-language-of-Jesus-Christ |title=Easter Sunday: A Syrian bid to resurrect Aramaic, the language of Jesus Christ |last=Beach |first=Alastair |newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |date=2010-04-02 |accessdate=2010-04-02}}</ref> Al Jazeera Arabic also broadcast a program about Western Neo-Aramaic and the villages in which it is spoken with the square script still in use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rbrZ1W2nAs|title=أرض تحكي لغة المسيح|first=|last=Al Jazeera Documentary الجزيرة الوثائقية|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=27 March 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\n==Letters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" | Letter<br/>name\n! colspan=\"4\" | Aramaic written using\n! rowspan=\"3\" | [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]\n! colspan=\"7\" | Equivalent letter in\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac script]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | Imperial Aramaic\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Brahmi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Nabataean alphabet|Nabataean]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Kharosthi]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Western Neo-Aramaic#Square Aramaic Alphabet|Maalouli Aramaic]]\n|-\n!

Originally, they represented only the consonants ''w'' and ''y'', but they were later adopted to indicate the long vowels ''ū'' and ''ī'' respectively as well (often also ''ō'' and ''ē'' respectively). In the latter role, they are known as ''{{lang|la|matres lectionis}}'' or \"mothers of reading\".\n\nĀlap, likewise, has some of the characteristics of a ''{{lang|la|mater lectionis}}'' because in initial positions, it indicates a [[glottal stop]] (followed by a vowel), but otherwise, it often also stands for the long vowels ''ā'' or ''ē''. Among Jews, the influence of Hebrew often led to the use of Hē instead, at the end of a word.\n\nThe practice of using certain letters to hold vowel values spread to Aramaic-derived writing systems, such as in Arabic and Hebrew, which still follow the practice.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main|Syriac (Unicode block)|Imperial Aramaic (Unicode block)}}\n\nThe Syriac Aramaic alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September 1999, with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe Syriac Abbreviation (a type of [[overline]]) can be represented with a special control character called the [[Syriac Abbreviation Mark]] (U+070F). The Unicode block for Syriac Aramaic is U+0700&ndash;U+074F:\n\n{{Unicode chart Syriac}}\n\nThe Imperial Aramaic alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in October 2009, with the release of version 5.2.\n\nThe Unicode block for Imperial Aramaic is U+10840&ndash;U+1085F:\n\n{{Unicode chart Imperial Aramaic}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Syriac alphabet]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Byrne, Ryan. “Middle Aramaic Scripts.” ''Encyclopaedia of Language and Linguistics''.

The first letter, ''a'' (corresponding to ''alaph''), is used to represent a range of open vowels. The sixth letter, ''wa'', is used for close back vowels (''u'' and ''o''), and the tenth letter, ''ya'' is used for close front vowels (''i'' and ''e''). These last two can also serve as the consonants ''w/v'' and ''y''. The eighth letter corresponds to the Semitic ''[[heth]]'', and is called ''eh''; it is pronounced as a long ''i''-vowel but is used only as a suffix for the [[Grammatical person|third person singular]].<ref name=\"Mandaeans1937\"/> The sixteenth letter, ''e'' (Aramaic ''[[Ayin|ayn]]''), usually represents ''e'' at the beginning of a word or, when followed by ''wa'' or ''ya'', represents initial ''u'' or ''i'' respectively.\n\nA mark similar to an underscore ({{unichar|085A|MANDAIC VOCALIZATION MARK|cwith=&#x25CC;}}) can be used to distinguish vowel quality for three Mandaic vowels. It is used in teaching materials but may be omitted from ordinary text.<ref name=\"L208270\"/> It is only used with vowels ''a'', ''wa'', and ''ya''. Using the letter ''ba'' as an example:\n\n* {{large|&#x0841;&#x0840;}} /bā/ becomes {{large|&#x0841;&#x0840;&#x085A;}} /ba/\n* {{large|&#x0841;&#x0845;}} /bu/ becomes {{large|&#x0841;&#x0845;&#x085A;}} /bo/\n* {{large|&#x0841;&#x0849;}} /bi/ becomes {{large|&#x0841;&#x0849;&#x085A;}} /be/\n\n===Gemination mark===\nA dot under a consonant ({{unichar|085B|MANDAIC GEMINATION MARK|cwith=&#x25CC;}}) can be used to note [[gemination]], indicating what native writers call a \"hard\" pronunciation.<ref name=\"L208270\"/>\nSample words include {{large|&#x0840;&#x084A;&#x085B;&#x0840;}} (ekka) 'there is', {{large|&#x0854;&#x0849;&#x084D;&#x085B;&#x0840;}} (šenna) 'tooth', {{large|&#x084B;&#x0849;&#x0841;&#x085B;&#x0840;}} (lebba) 'heart', and {{large|&#x0853;&#x0841;&#x085B;&#x0847;}} (rabba) 'great'.<ref name=\"L208270\"/>\n\n===Ligatures===\nThe 23rd letter of the alphabet is the digraph ''adu'' (''da'' + ''ya''), the relative particle<ref name=\"TUSME\"/><ref name=\"MandadaicDictionary\"/> (cf. Arabic [[tāʾ marbūṭah]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] letter \"ti\", and English [[Ampersand#Its Place in the Alphabet|ampersand]]).\n\nIn addition to normal joining behavior, some Mandaic letters can combine to form various [[Typographic ligature|ligatures]]:<ref name=\"DBWWS\"/><ref name=\"L208270\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2008/08270r-n3485r-mandaic.pdf|title=L2/08-270R: Proposal for encoding the Mandaic script in the BMP of the UCS|date=2008-08-04|first1=Michael|last1=Everson|authorlink1=Michael Everson|first2=Bob|last2=Richmond}}</ref>\n* {{large|&#x084A;&#x0843;}} /kd/, {{large|&#x0857;}} /kḏ/, {{large|&#x084A;&#x0849;}} /ki/, {{large|&#x084A;&#x084B;}} /kl/, {{large|&#x084A;&#x0853;}} /kr/, {{large|&#x084A;&#x0855;}} /kt/, and {{large|&#x084A;&#x0845;}} /ku/\n* {{large|&#x084D;&#x0843;}} /nd/, {{large|&#x084D;&#x0849;}} /ni/, {{large|&#x084D;&#x084C;}} /nm/, {{large|&#x084D;&#x0852;}} /nq/, {{large|&#x084D;&#x0855;}} /nt/, and {{large|&#x084D;&#x0845;}} /nu/\n* {{large|&#x0850;&#x084B;}} /pl/, {{large|&#x0850;&#x0853;}} /pr/, and {{large|&#x0850;&#x0845;}} /pu/\n* {{large|&#x0851;&#x084B;}} /ṣl/, {{large|&#x0851;&#x0853;}} /ṣr/, and {{large|&#x0851;&#x0845;}} /ṣu/\n* {{large|&#x0845;&#x0855;}} /ut/\n\nBoth ''adu'' ({{unichar|0856|MANDAIC LETTER DUSHENNA}}) and the old ligature kḏ ({{unichar|0857|MANDAIC LETTER KAD}}) are treated as single characters in Unicode.\n\n==Extensions==\n===Affrication mark===\n\nPostclassical and modern Mandaic use many [[Persian language|Persian]] words. Various Mandaic letters can be re-purposed by placing two horizontally-aligned dots underneath ({{unichar|0859|MANDAIC AFFRICATION MARK|cwith=&#x25CC;}}).

New York: Oxford University Press</ref>) is a writing system for several [[Algonquian languages]] that emerged during the nineteenth century and whose existence was first noted in 1880.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 123</ref> It was originally used near the [[Great Lakes]]: [[Fox language|Fox]] (also known as ''Meskwaki'' or ''Mesquakie''), [[Sac (people)|Sac]] (the latter also spelled ''Sauk''), and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] (these three constituting closely related but politically distinct [[dialect]]s of a single language for which there is no common term), in addition to [[Potawatomi language|Potawatomi]]. Use of the script was subsequently extended to the [[Siouan languages|Siouan]] language [[Winnebago language|Ho-Chunk]] (also known as ''Winnebago'').<ref>Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 168-173</ref> Use of the Great Lakes script has also been attributed to speakers of the [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] dialect of the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] language, but supporting evidence is weak.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nConsonant and vowel letters that comprise a [[syllable]] are grouped into units that are separated by spaces.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1996, p. 169</ref> The system is of interest to students of writing systems because it is a case of an alphabetic system acquiring aspects of a [[syllabary]].<ref>Justeson, John and Laurence Stevens, 1991-1993</ref>\n\nThe Great Lakes script is unrelated to [[Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics|Cree syllabics]], which was invented by [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] to write [[Cree language|Cree]] and extended to a number of other Canadian indigenous languages.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 116</ref>\n\n==History and origins==\nThe script is based upon \"a European cursive form of the Roman alphabet\".<ref name=\"Walker, Willard, 1981, p. 169\"/> Vowel letters correspond with French writing conventions, suggesting a French source. The order of the consonants in tables of the Great Lakes Syllabics is evidence that the script was developed by people who knew the [[Canadian syllabics]] syllabary previously in use in Canada, suggesting an origin in Canada.<ref>Unseth, Peter. 2017. The syllabary used by the Kickapoo in Mexico. ''Written Language and Literacy'' 19.2: 246 – 256.</ref>\n\nThe early development of the system is not known. In 1880, when first reported, use of the script was widespread among speakers of Fox and Sac.<ref name=\"Walker, Willard, 1981, p. 169\">Walker, Willard, 1981, p. 169</ref> Some remarks by Potawatomi speakers suggest that the first Potawatomi usage was in approximately the same period.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1981; Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 126</ref>\n\nPotawatomi does not have a consonant /h/, and instead has a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} in places where Fox would have /h/. In Potawatomi, the glottal stop is the only consonant not represented in the script, and similarly in Fox /h/ is the only consonant that is not represented. Because glottal stops have frequently been overlooked when transcribing Native American languages with the Latin script, whereas /h/ seldom is, this anomaly suggests that the script was originally developed for Potawatomi, and subsequently transmitted to speakers of Fox, Sac, and Kickapoo.<ref name=\"Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 127\">Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 127</ref>\n\n==Description==\nIn syllabics, syllables are separated by spaces, and words optionally by a point (period) as the [[word divider]]. Old transcriptions of Algonquian languages by Westerners frequently separated the syllables of the languages with hyphens, and the period would be used every few words at the end of a sentence, so these practices may be historically related.\n\nGreat Lakes syllabics is an [[alphabet]], with separate letters for consonants and vowels.  However, it is written in syllabic blocks, like the [[Korean alphabet]]. Moreover, the vowel /a/ is not written unless it forms a syllable by itself. That is, the letter {{angbr|k}} transcribes both the consonant /k/ and the syllable /ka/. In most Great Lakes syllabics alphabets, the letter for the vowel /i/ has been reduced to its dot, which has become a [[diacritic]] on the consonant of the syllable. Both phenomena (ignoring an [[inherent vowel]] and writing other vowels as diacritics) are characteristics of a subclass of alphabet, such as [[Devanagari]], known variously as ''[[abugida]]s'' or ''alphasyllabaries''.  The [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] consonants are distinguished from the [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] as [[digraph (typography)|digraph]]s with the letter {{angbr|h}}, but the distinction is frequently ignored, making syllabics a [[defective script]] for consonants as well as vowels.\n\nThere are several alphabets based on the script. Samples of the Fox alphabet are in Jones (1906), and Walker (1981, 1996); the latter includes handwriting samples for each letter or compound letter from four different early 20th century Fox writers.<ref>Jones, William, 1906; Walker, Willard, 1981, pp. 158-159; Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 170-171</ref> Samples of the Potawatomi alphabet are in Walker (1981, 1986).<ref>Walker, Willard, 1981, p. 160; Walker, Willard, 1996, p. 172</ref> Goddard (1996) includes a postcard written in the Fox script, and Kinkade and Mattina (1996) includes a page of text in the Fox alphabet.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 124; Kinkade, Dale and Anthony Mattina, 1996, p. 250, Fig. 3</ref>\n\n===Fox alphabet===\nThe syllabary symbols used by the Fox, Sauk, and Kickapoo groups have only minor differences. This section outlines the main characteristics of the Fox alphabet, which is the most completely described in published sources. A brief discussion of the Sauk alphabet has also been published.<ref>Reinschmidt, Kirsten, 1995</ref> \nFox speakers refer to the script in both Fox and English as the ''pa·pe·pi·po·'', referring to the first row of consonant-plus-vowel syllables in traditional presentations of the script.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe core component of the Fox presentation is 48 syllables arranged in twelve rows and four columns. One row is the four vowel letters by themselves. The others each consist of one of the eleven consonant letters by itself (with the inherent vowel /a/ understood) and followed by each of the three combining vowel letters. The script accommodates all the consonant sounds of the Fox language with the exception of /h/, which has no letter. No distinction is made between long and short vowels. A sequence of two identical vowel letters is read as two syllables, typically with an /h/ assumed between the two vowels.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, pp. 117-119</ref>\n\nSyllables are separated by spaces. Punctuation consists of a [[word divider]], \"which variously appears as a dot, a small line, or an {{angbr|X}} or {{angbr|+}}.... Many writers do not use the word divider, being particularly apt to omit it at line ends, and some never use it.\"<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 120</ref> Jones (1906) indicated that the dot or small line were used as word dividers and the cross as a sentence divider, but subsequent study of Fox text manuscripts does not support this claim.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 120; Jones, William, 1906, p. 91</ref>\n\nSeveral variants of the script existed among Fox speakers, in which various symbols were substituted for combinations of consonant and vowel letters. These variants were apparently originally used as secret codes and were not widely utilized. Samples of the variant forms are in Walker (1981), taken from Jones (1906).<ref>Jones, William, 1906; Walker, Willard, 1981, pp. 158-159</ref>\n\nThere are also minor variations in the form of the script used by Kickapoo speakers, and Kickapoo speakers living in Mexico have added orthographic modifications based on Spanish.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 169, 171</ref>\n\n== Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) adoption ==\nThe Fox alphabet was adapted by speakers of Ho-Chunk (also known as ''Winnebago'') subsequent to an encounter in [[Nebraska]] in 1883/1884 with Fox speakers, who told them of other Fox speakers who were using a new writing system in order to write their own language. On a subsequent visit to Fox territory in [[Iowa]] in 1884, a Winnebago speaker learned to write in the script.<ref>Fletcher, Alice, 1890</ref> Period reports indicate rapid adoption of the script by Winnebago speakers in Nebraska and [[Wisconsin]]. Winnebago [[phonology]] is significantly different from that of Fox-Sauk-Kickapoo and Potawatomi, with both more consonants and vowels, and the script was adapted in order to accommodate some of these differences.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1981, p. 162</ref>\n\nAnthropologist [[Paul Radin]] worked with Ho-Chunk speaker Sam Blowsnake to produce ''Crashing Thunder: The Autobiography of an American Indian.''<ref>Blowsnake, Sam, 1920</ref> This autobiography was based upon handwritten material composed by Blowsnake in the script.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1981, p.162</ref> Use of syllabics declined over time; when Radin visited Winnebago communities in 1912, he reported that it was known only to a small number of people.<ref>Walker, Willard, 1981, pp. 161-162; Walker, Willard, 1996, pp. 172-173</ref>\n\n== Possible Ottawa use ==\nSome comments by [[Ottawa language|Ottawa]] speaker [[Andrew Blackbird|Andrew J. Blackbird]] \"…in which he recalls his father Mackadepenessy ‘making his own alphabet which he called ‘Paw-pa-pe-po’\" and teaching it to other Ottawas from the [[Harbor Springs, Michigan|L'Arbre Croche]] village on the [[Lower Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]] have been interpreted as suggesting use of a syllabic writing system by Ottawas earlier in the nineteenth century, although Blackbird was not himself a user of the script. Blackbird’s Ottawa writings use a mixture of French and English-based characteristics, but not those of Great Lakes script.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 127; Walker, Willard, 1996, p. 169</ref> There are no known Odawa texts written in the script.\n\nIt has been suggested that Blackbird’s father may have been referring to a separate orthography developed by French Roman Catholic missionaries and spread by missionary August Dejean, who arrived at L'Arbre Croche, Michigan in 1827, and wrote a primer and catechism in an orthography similar to that used by other French missionaries.<ref name=\"Goddard, Ives, 1996, p. 127\"/>\n\n== Ojibwa use ==\nIn his 1932 \"Ethnobotany of the Ojibwe Indians,\" Huron H. Smith records, \"The Ojibwe have written their language for a longer time than any other Algonquin tribe and, while they employ a script in corresponding with absent members of the tribe, it has little value to the ethnologist....\" Smith then clarifies what he means by 'script' and provides a script table in the footnotes.<ref>Smith, p. 335</ref>\n\n==Written materials==\nIn the early twentieth century, [[Bureau of American Ethnology]] linguist [[Truman Michelson]] engaged several Fox speakers to write stories using the Fox script. Some of these texts are lengthy, running to several hundred printed pages each. A large collection of these unpublished texts is now archived in the [[Smithsonian Institution]] [[National Anthropological Archives]]. A photograph of Michelson and prolific Fox writer Albert Kiyana appears in Kinkade and Mattina (1996).<ref>Kinkade, Dale and Anthony Mattina, 1996, p. 250, Fig. 3</ref> Kiyana wrote stories for Michelson between 1911 and his death in 1918. A newly edited and transcribed version of \"Owl Sacred Pack,\" one of the culturally most significant of the stories written by Kiyana has recently been published.<ref>Goddard, Ives, 2007</ref>\n\n==Correspondence table==\nBecause Great Lakes Aboriginal syllabics is not part of the [[Unicode]] standards, glyphs for this table have been approximated with cursive Latin script.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Ho-Chunk\n!Potawatomi\n!Odawa\n!Meshkwaki\n!Ojibwe\n|-\n!\n| '\n| '\n| '\n| h\n| ' / h\n|-\n!

So-called '''impure abjads''' do represent vowels, either with optional [[diacritic]]s, a limited number of distinct vowel glyphs, or both.  The name ''abjad'' is based on the old [[Arabic]] alphabet's first four letters&mdash;a, b, j, d&mdash;to replace the common terms \"'''consonantary'''\" or  \"'''consonantal alphabet'''\" to refer to the family of scripts called [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"abjad\" (''{{transl|ar|abjad}}'' {{lang|ar|أبجد}}) is derived from pronouncing the first letters of the Old alphabet order in [[ Arabic]]. The ordering (''{{transl|ar|abjadī}}'') of [[Arabic letters]] used to match that of the older [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Semitic alphabet|Semitic]] alphabets: ''{{transl|sem|ʾ&nbsp;(aleph)&nbsp;-&nbsp;b&nbsp;-&nbsp;g&nbsp;-&nbsp;d}}''.\n\n==Terminology==\nAccording to the formulations of Daniels,{{sfn|Daniels| Bright|1996}} abjads differ from [[alphabet]]s in that only consonants, not vowels, are represented among the basic [[grapheme]]s. Abjads differ from [[abugida]]s, another category defined by Daniels, in that in abjads, the vowel sound is ''implied'' by [[phonology]], and where [[Diacritic|vowel marks]] exist for the system, such as [[niqqud|nikkud]] for [[Hebrew]] and [[harakat|ḥarakāt]] for [[Arabic]], their use is optional and not the dominant (or literate) form. Abugidas mark all vowels (other than the [[Inherent vowel|\"inherent\" vowel]]) with a [[diacritic]], a minor attachment to the letter, or a standalone [[glyph]]. Some abugidas use a special symbol to ''suppress'' the inherent vowel so that the consonant alone can be properly represented. In a [[syllabary]], a grapheme denotes a complete syllable, that is, either a lone vowel sound or a combination of a vowel sound with one or more consonant sounds.\n\nThe antagonism of abjad versus alphabet, as it was formulated by Daniels, has been rejected by some other scholars because abjad is also used as a term not only for the Arabic numeral system but, which is most important in terms of historical grammatology, also as term for the alphabetic device (i.e. letter order) of ancient Northwest Semitic scripts in opposition to the 'south Arabian' order. This caused fatal effects on terminology in general and especially in (ancient) Semitic philology. Also, it suggests that consonantal alphabets, in opposition to, for instance, the Greek alphabet, were not yet true alphabets and not yet entirely complete, lacking something important to be a fully working script system. It has also been objected that, as a set of letters, an alphabet is not the mirror of what should be there in a language from a phonological point of view; rather, it is the data stock of what provides maximum efficiency with least effort from a semantic point of view.{{sfn|Lehmann|2011}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[Image:Ba`alat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.10|A specimen of [[Proto-Sinaitic]] script containing a phrase which may mean 'to [[Baalat]]'. The line running from the upper left to lower right reads ''mt l b<sup>c</sup>lt''.]]\n\n{{See also|History of the alphabet#Descendants of the Aramaic abjad}}\n\nThe first abjad to gain widespread usage was the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician abjad]]. Unlike other contemporary scripts, such as [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], the Phoenician script consisted of only a few dozen symbols. This made the script easy to learn, and seafaring Phoenician merchants took the script throughout the then-known world.\n\nThe Phoenician abjad was a radical simplification of phonetic writing, since hieroglyphics required the writer to pick a hieroglyph starting with the same sound that the writer wanted to write in order to write phonetically, much as ''[[Man'yōgana|man'yôgana]]'' ([[Chinese characters]] used solely for phonetic use) was used to represent [[Japanese language|Japanese]] phonetically before the invention of [[kana]].\n\nPhoenician gave rise to a number of new writing systems, including the [[Greek alphabet]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], a widely used abjad. The Greek alphabet evolved into the modern western alphabets, such as [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic]], while Aramaic became the ancestor of many modern abjads and abugidas of Asia.\n\n==Impure abjads==\n[[Image:Arabic albayancalligraphy.svg|thumb|''Al-ʻArabiyya'', meaning \"Arabic\": an example of the Arabic script, which is an impure abjad.]]\n\nImpure abjads have characters for some vowels, optional vowel diacritics, or both. The term pure abjad refers to scripts entirely lacking in vowel indicators.{{sfn|Daniels|2013}} However, most modern abjads, such as [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], and [[Pahlavi alphabet|Pahlavi]], are \"impure\" abjads{{snd}}that is, they also contain symbols for some of the vowel phonemes, although the said non-diacritic vowel letters are also used to write certain consonants, particularly [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] that sound similar to long vowels. A \"pure\" abjad is exemplified (perhaps) by very early forms of ancient [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], though at some point (at least by the 9th century BC) it and most of the contemporary Semitic abjads had begun to overload a few of the consonant symbols with a secondary function as vowel markers, called ''[[mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]''.{{sfn|Lipiński|1994}} This practice was at first rare and limited in scope but became increasingly common and more developed in later times.\n\n===Addition of vowels===\n{{Main|Greek alphabet}}\n\nIn the 9th century BC the Greeks adapted the Phoenician script for use in their own language. The phonetic structure of the Greek language created too many ambiguities when vowels went unrepresented, so the script was modified. They did not need letters for the [[guttural consonant|guttural]] sounds represented by ''[[aleph]]'', ''[[he (letter)|he]]'', ''[[Heth (letter)|heth]]'' or ''[[ayin]]'', so these symbols were assigned vocalic values. The letters ''[[Waw (letter)|waw]]'' and ''[[Yodh|yod]]'' were also adapted into vowel signs; along with ''he'', these were already used as ''[[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]'' in Phoenician. The major innovation of Greek was to dedicate these symbols exclusively and unambiguously to vowel sounds that could be combined arbitrarily with consonants (as opposed to syllabaries such as [[Linear B]] which usually have vowel symbols but cannot combine them with consonants to form arbitrary syllables).\n\n[[Abugida]]s developed along a slightly different route. The basic consonantal symbol was considered to have an inherent \"a\" vowel sound. Hooks or short lines attached to various parts of the basic letter modify the vowel. In this way, the [[South Arabian alphabet]] evolved into the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] between the 5th century BC and the 5th century AD. Similarly, around the 3rd century BC, the [[Brāhmī script]] developed (from the [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic abjad]], it has been hypothesized).\n\nThe other major family of abugidas, [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]], was initially developed in the 1840s by missionary and linguist [[James Evans (linguist)|James Evans]] for the Cree and Ojibwe languages. Evans used features of [[Devanagari script]] and [[Pitman shorthand]] to create his initial abugida. Later in the 19th century, other missionaries adapted Evans' system to other Canadian aboriginal languages. Canadian syllabics differ from other abugidas in that the vowel is indicated by rotation of the consonantal symbol, with each vowel having a consistent orientation.\n\n==Abjads and the structure of Semitic languages==\nThe abjad form of writing is well-adapted to the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] structure of the Semitic languages it was developed to write. This is because words in Semitic languages are formed from [[triliteral|a root consisting of (usually) three consonants]], the vowels being used to indicate inflectional or derived forms.  For instance, according to [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Modern Standard Arabic]], from the Arabic root {{lang|ar|ذ&nbsp;ب&nbsp;ح}} ''Dh-B-Ḥ'' (to slaughter) can be derived the forms {{lang|ar|ذَبَحَ}} ''{{transl|ar|dhabaḥa}}'' (he slaughtered), {{lang|ar|ذَبَحْتَ}} ''{{transl|ar|dhabaḥta}}'' (you (masculine singular) slaughtered), {{lang|ar|يُذَبِّحُ}} ''{{transl|ar|yudhabbiḥu}}'' (he slaughters), and {{lang|ar|مَذْبَح}} ''{{transl|ar|madhbaḥ}}'' (slaughterhouse). In most cases, the absence of full glyphs for vowels makes the common root clearer, allowing readers to guess the meaning of unfamiliar words from familiar roots (especially in conjunction with [[context (language use)|context]] clues) and improving word recognition{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}{{dubious|date=August 2011}} while reading for practiced readers.<!--extremely exaggerated, there are dozens of Arabic words of different roots which are only distinguished by vowels-->\n\nBy contrast, the Arabic and Hebrew scripts sometimes perform the role of [[alphabet|true alphabets]] rather than abjads when used to write certain [[Indo-European languages]], including [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Arebica|Bosnian]], and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]].\n\n==Comparative chart of

W., and ‛Abdallah, Yu., ''Textes du Yémen Antique inscrits sur bois''. [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], Belgium, 1994 (Publications de l'Institut Orientaliste de Louvain, 43)).\n\nZabur was a writing system in [[Ancient history of Yemen|ancient Yemen]] along with Musnad. The difference between the two is that Musnad documented historical events, meanwhile Zabur Writings were used for religious scripts or to record daily transactions among ancient Yemenis. Zabur Writings could be found on [[palimpsest]] form written on [[papyri]] or palm-leaf stalks.<ref>Inscribed old south Arabian Sticks and palm-leaf stalks: An introduction and a paleographical approach Jacques Ryckmans p.127</ref><ref>S.

It bears a sibling relationship to early forms of the [[Pahlavi script]], both systems having developed from the [[Imperial Aramaic alphabet]], in which the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] court rendered its particular, official dialect of the [[Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Aramaic language]]. Unlike Pahlavi, Manichaean script reveals influences from [[Sogdian script]], which in turn descends from the Syriac branch of Aramaic. Manichaean script is so named because Manichaean texts attribute its design to [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] himself. [[Middle Persian]] is written with this alphabet.\n\n==Overview==\nOlder Manichaean texts appear in a script and language that is still identifiable as [[Syriac language|Syriac]]-[[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and these compositions are then classified as Syriac/Aramaic texts. Later texts using Manichaean script are attested in the literature of three Middle Iranian language [[ethnolect]]s:\n*[[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] — the dialect of [[Sogdia]] in the east, which had a large Manichean population.\n*[[Parthian language|Parthian]] — the dialect of [[Parthia]] in the northeast, which is indistinguishable from Medean of the northwest.\n* [[Middle Persian]] — the dialect of [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]] ([[Persis]], or Persia proper) in southwest [[Greater Iran|Iran]].\n\nThe Manichaean system does not have a high incidence of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] language [[logogram]]s and [[ideogram]]s inherited from chancellery [[Imperial Aramaic]] that are an essential characteristic of the Pahlavi system. Besides that, Manichaean spelling was less conservative or historical and corresponded closer to contemporary pronunciation: e.g. a word such as ''āzād'' \"noble, free\" was written ''ʼčʼt'' in Pahlavi, but ''ʼʼzʼd'' in Manichaean Middle Persian of the same period.\n\nManichaean script was not the only script used to render Manichaean manuscripts. When writing in [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], which was frequently the case, Manichaean scribes frequently used the [[Sogdian alphabet]] (\"Uighur script\"). Likewise, outside Manichaeism, the dialect of Parsa (Persia proper) was also recorded in other  systems, including Pahlavi scripts (in which case it is known as \"Pahlevi\" or [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian]]) and [[Avestan alphabet]] (in which case it is known as [[Pazend]]).\n\nAs Manichaeism was persecuted around [[Mesopotamia]] and the regions of the [[Sasanian Empire]], its origins, it became well-established in Central Asia and along the [[Silk Road]]. It became an official state religion among the Uyghurs for five centuries (from the 8th through the 12th century), and thus many surviving manuscripts are found in the [[Turpan]] region in the Iranian languages aforementioned, the [[Old Uyghur language]], and the [[Tocharian languages]].\n\nIn the 19th century, German expeditions discovered a number of Manichaean manuscripts at Bulayiq on the Silk Road near Turpan in what is now [[Xinjiang]]. Many of these manuscripts are today preserved in Berlin.\n\n==Characters==\nLike most abjads, Manichaean is written from right to left and lacks vowels. Particularly, it has certain consonants that join on both sides, some that join only on the right, and some that only join on the left, and some that do not join at all, unlike the most well-known abjad, Arabic, which has only consonants that join on both sides or on the right. Manichaean has a separate sign for the conjunction \"ud\" (and), two dots are placed above characters to indicate abbreviations, and there are several punctuation marks to indicate headlines, page divisions, sentence divisions, and others.\n\nThere are obligatory conjuncts for certain combinations involving \"n\" and \"y.\" The numbers are built from units of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 100 and can be visually identifiable. There are also some alternate forms of certain characters.\n\n==Unicode==\n{{See also|Manichaean (Unicode block)}}\nThe Manichaean alphabet (U+10AC0&ndash;U+10AFF) was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.\n\n{{Unicode chart Manichaean}}\n<!--\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}-->\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite encyclopedia|article=Manichean script|last=Durkin-Meisterernst|first=Desmond|date=October 14, 2005|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/manichean-script}}\n*[http://www.bbaw.de/forschung/turfanforschung/dta/m/dta_m_index.htm Photos of the original texts written in manichaean script discovered at Turpan] (Under the link \"Texte in manichäischer Schrift\")\n*{{cite web|url=http://titus.fkidg1.uni-frankfurt.de/unicode/iranian/3tagung.htm |title=Initial Iranian conference proposing Unicode for Manichaean Script}}\n\n{{Manichaeism footer}}\n{{list of writing systems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Manichaean Script}}\n[[Category:Obsolete writing systems]]\n[[Category:Abjad writing systems]]\n[[Category:Manichaeism]]\n[[Category:Persian scripts]]\n[[Category:Scripts encoded in Unicode 7.0]]"

The essential characteristics of Pahlavi are{{Sfn |Geiger|Kuhn|2002|pp= 249ff}}\n*the use of a specific [[Aramaic script|Aramaic]]-derived script;\n*the high incidence of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic words]] used as [[heterogram (linguistics)|heterogram]]s (called ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig|hozwārishn]]'', \"archaisms\").\nPahlavi compositions have been found for the dialects/ethnolects of [[Parthian language|Parthia]], [[Middle Persian language|Persis]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdiana]], [[Scythian language|Scythia]], and [[Khotanese language|Khotan]].<ref name=\"Kent_1953\">{{harvnb|Kent|1953}}</ref> Independent of the [[Variety (linguistics)|variant]] for which the Pahlavi system was used, the written form of that language only qualifies as Pahlavi when it has the characteristics noted above.\n\nPahlavi is then an admixture of\n*written [[Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Imperial Aramaic]], from which Pahlavi derives its script, logograms, and some of its vocabulary.\n*spoken [[Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]], from which Pahlavi derives its terminations, symbol rules, and most of its vocabulary.\n\nPahlavi may thus be defined as a system of writing applied to (but not unique for) a specific language group, but with critical features alien to that language group. It has the characteristics of a distinct language, but is not one. It is an exclusively written system, but much Pahlavi literature remains essentially an oral literature committed to writing and so retains many of the characteristics of oral composition.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term Pahlavi is said<ref name=\"Mirza_2002_162\">{{harvnb|Mirza|2002|p=162}}.</ref> to be derived from the [[Parthian language]] word ''parthav'' or ''parthau'', meaning Parthia, a region just east of the [[Caspian Sea]], with the ''-i'' suffix denoting the language and people of that region. If this etymology is correct, ''Parthav'' presumably became ''pahlaw'' through a [[semivowel|semivowel glide]] ''rt'' (or in other cases ''rd'') change to ''l'', a common occurrence in language evolution (e.g. Arsacid ''sard'' became ''sal'', ''zard''>''zal'', ''vard''>''gol'', ''sardar''>''salar'' etc.). The term has been traced back further<ref name=\"Mirza_2002_162\"/> to [[Avestan]] ''pərəthu-'' \"broad [as the earth]\", also evident in [[Sanskrit]] ''pŗthvi-'' \"earth\" and ''parthivi'' \"[lord] of the earth\". Common to all Indo-Iranian languages is a connotation of \"mighty\".\n\n==History==\nThe earliest attested use of Pahlavi dates to the reign of [[Arsaces I of Parthia]] (250 BC) in early [[Parthian coins]] with Pahlavi scripts.<ref>{{harvnb|Mirza|2002|p=162}}, no citation, but probably referring to {{harvnb|West|1904}}</ref> There are also several Pahlavi texts written during the reign of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] (''r.'' 171–138 BC).<ref name=\"Boyce_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Boyce|2002|p=106}}.</ref> The cellars of the treasury at Mithradatkird (near modern-day [[Nisa, Iran|Nisa]]) reveal thousands of pottery sherds with brief records; several [[Ostracon|ostraca]] that are fully dated <!-- (following the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] as it had been introduced by [[Artaxerxes II]], but with the regnal year of Mithridates)--> bear references to members of the immediate family of the king.<ref name=\"Weber_1992\">{{harvnb|Boyce|2002|p=106}} ''cf.'' {{harvnb|Weber|1992}}.</ref>\n\nSuch fragments, as also the rock inscriptions of Sassanid kings, which are datable to the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, do not, however, qualify as a significant literary corpus. Although in theory Pahlavi could have been used to render any Middle Iranian language and hence may have been in use as early as 300 BC, no manuscripts that can be dated to before the 6th century AD have yet been found. Thus, when used for the name of a literary genre, i.e. [[Pahlavi literature]], the term refers to Middle Iranian (mostly [[Middle Persian]]) texts dated near or after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]] and (with exceptions) extending to about AD 900, after which Iranian languages enter the \"modern\" stage.\n\nThe oldest surviving example of the Pahlavi literature is from fragments of the so-called \"[[Pahlavi Psalter]]\", a 6th- or 7th-century-AD translation of a Syriac Psalter found at Bulayiq on the [[Silk Road]], near [[Turpan]] in north-west China. It is in a more archaic script than [[Book Pahlavi]].<ref name=\"Weber_1992_32_33\">{{harvnb|Weber|1992|pp=32–33}}.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], the Pahlavi script was replaced by the [[Arabic script]], except in [[Middle Persian literature|Zoroastrian sacred literature]].\n\nThe replacement of the Pahlavi script with the Arabic script in order to write the Persian language was done by the [[Tahirids]] in 9th century [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ira M. Lapidus|title=Islamic Societies to the Nineteenth Century: A Global History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcPZ1k65pqkC&pg=PA256#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=29 October 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51441-5|pages=256–}}</ref><ref name=\"Lapidus2002\">{{cite book|author=Ira M.

This practice can be dated to the period immediately following the Islamic conquest.<ref name=\"Boyce_2002_106\"/>\n\n==Script==\nThe Pahlavi script is one of the two essential characteristics of the Pahlavi system (see above). Its origin and development occurred independently of the various [[Iranian languages|Middle Iranian languages]] for which it was used. The Pahlavi script is derived from the [[Aramaic script]] as it was used under the [[Achaemenid]]s, with modifications to support the phonology of the Iranian languages. It is essentially a typical [[abjad]], where, in general, only long vowels are marked with [[matres lectionis]] (although short /i/ and /u/ are sometimes expressed so as well), and vowel-initial words are marked with an [[aleph]]. However, because of the high incidence of [[logogram]]s derived from Aramaic words, the Pahlavi script is far from always phonetic; and even when it is phonetic, it may have more than one transliterational symbol per sign, because certain originally different Aramaic letters have merged into identical graphic forms&nbsp;– especially in the Book Pahlavi variety. (For a review of the transliteration problems of Pahlavi, see [[Walter Bruno Henning|Henning]].{{Sfn |Henning|1958|pp=126–29}}) In addition to this, during much of its later history, Pahlavi orthography was characterized by historical or archaizing spellings. Most notably, it continued to reflect the pronunciation that preceded the widespread Iranian [[lenition]] processes, whereby postvocalic voiceless [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate]]s had become voiced, and voiced stops had become [[semivowel]]s. Similarly, certain words continued to be spelt with postvocalic {{angle bracket|s}} and {{angle bracket|t}} even after the consonants had been [[debuccalization|debuccalized]] to {{angle bracket|h}} in the living language.\n\nThe Pahlavi script consisted of two widely used forms: Inscriptional Pahlavi and Book Pahlavi. A third form, Psalter Pahlavi, is not widely attested.\n\n===Inscriptional Parthian===\n{{main|Inscriptional Parthian}}\nAlthough the [[Arsacid Empire|Parthian Arsacids]] generally wrote in Greek, some of the coins and seals of the Arsacid period (mid-3rd-century BC to early 3rd-century AD) also include inscriptions in the [[Parthian language]]. The script of these inscriptions is called inscriptional Parthian. Numerous clay fragments from Arsacid-era Parthia proper, in particular a large collection of fragments from Nisa that date to the reign of [[Mithridates I of Parthia|Mithridates I]] (''r.'' 171–138 BC), are likewise inscribed in inscriptional Parthian. The bilingual and trilingual inscriptions of the early (3rd-century AD) [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] include Parthian texts, which were then also rendered in inscriptional Parthian. The Parthian language was a Middle Iranian language of Parthia proper, a region in the north-western segment of the Iranian plateau where the Arsacids had their power base. \n\nInscriptional Parthian script had 22 letters for sounds and 8 letters for numerals. The letters were not joined. Inscriptional Parthian has [[Inscriptional Parthian (Unicode block)|its own Unicode block]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Shapur Kabe Zartosht (cropped).png|Parthian version of [[Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht]]\nFile:Naqsh-e Rajab - Shapur parade - detail of inscription.jpg|Parthian (above), along with Greek (below) and Middle Persian was being used in inscriptions of early [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian]] kings.

Genuine Middle Persian as it appears in these inscriptions was the Middle Iranian language of Persia proper, the region in the south-western corner of the Iranian plateau where the Sassanids had their power base.\n\nInscriptional Pahlavi script had 19 characters which were not joined.<ref name=\"Central Asia 1999, P.89\">{{Citation | last1 = Livinsky | first1 = BA | last2 = Guang‐Da | first2 = Zhang | last3 = Samghabadi | first3 = R Shabani |date=March 1999 | place = Delhi | ISBN = 978-81-208-1540-7 | title = History of civilizations of Central Asia | volume = 3.

This text, which was found at Bulayiq near [[Turpan]] in northwest China, is the earliest evidence of literary composition in Pahlavi, dating to the 6th or 7th century AD.{{Sfn | Gignoux | 2002}}  The extant manuscript dates no earlier than the mid-6th century since the translation reflects liturgical additions to the Syriac original by [[Mar Aba I]], who was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]] ''c.'' 540–552.{{Sfn |Andreas|1910|pp= 869–872}} Its use is peculiar to Christians in [[Iran]], given its use in a fragmentary manuscript of the Psalms of David.<ref>https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2011/11147-n4040-psalter-pahlavi.pdf</ref>\n\nThe script of the psalms has altogether 18 graphemes, 5 more than Book Pahlavi and one less than Inscriptional Pahlavi. As in Book Pahlavi, letters are connected to each other. The only other surviving source of Psalter Pahlavi are the inscriptions on a bronze processional cross found at [[Herat]], in present-day Afghanistan. Due to the dearth of comparable material, some words and phrases in both sources remain undeciphered.\n\nOf the 18 characters, 9 connect in all four traditional abjad positions, while 9 connect only on their right or are isolated. Numbers are built from units of 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 20, and 100. The numbers 10 and 20 join on both sides, but the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 only join on the right, and if they are followed by an additional digit, they lose their tail, which is visually evident in their isolated forms. There are 12 encoded punctuation characters, and many are similar to those found in Syriac. The section marks are written in half-red and half-black, and several documents have entire sections in both black and red, as a means of distinction.\n\n===Book Pahlavi===\n\nBook Pahlavi is a smoother script in which letters are joined to each other and often form complicated [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Book Pahlavi was the most common form of the script, with only 12 or 13 [[grapheme]]s (13 when including ''aleph'') representing 24 [[sound]]s. The formal coalescence of originally different letters caused ambiguity, and the letters became even less distinct when they formed part of a ligature.<ref name=\"Central Asia 1999, P.89\"/> In its later forms, attempts were made to improve the consonantary and reduce ambiguity through [[diacritic]] marks.\n\nBook Pahlavi continued to be in common use until about AD 900. After that date, Pahlavi was preserved only by the Zoroastrian clergy.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Eranshahr.svg|The word ''[[Ērān-šahr]]'', spelled ʾylʾnštr', in Book Pahlavi.\nFile:Ispahbod Xurshid's coin-1.jpg|Coin of [[Khurshid of Tabaristan|Ispahbod Khurshid]] (r.&nbsp;740–760) with Book Pahlavi writings. Book Pahlavi, instead of Inscriptional Pahlavi, was used in late Middle Persian inscriptions.\nFile:Stone cross with Pahlavi inscription.jpg|Stone cross with Book Pahlavi writings. Valiyapalli Church in Kottayam, Kerala, India.\n</gallery>\n\n===Logograms===\n{{see also|Heterogram (linguistics)}}\nIn both Inscriptional and Book Pahlavi, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, were spelled according to their [[Imperial Aramaic|Aramaic]] equivalents, which were used as logograms.  For example, the word for \"dog\" was written as {{angle bracket|KLBʼ}} (Aramaic ''kalbā'') but pronounced ''sag''; and the word for \"bread\" would be written as Aramaic {{angle bracket|LḤMʼ}} (''laḥmā'') but understood as the sign for Iranian ''nān''.{{Sfn |Nyberg|1974}}  These words were known as ''huzvārishn''. Such a logogram could also be followed by letters expressing parts of the Persian word phonetically, e.g. {{angle bracket|ʼB-tr}} for ''pitar'' \"father\". The grammatical endings were usually written phonetically. A logogram did not necessarily originate from the lexical form of the word in Aramaic, it could also come from a [[declension|declined]] or [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] Aramaic form. For example, ''tō'' \"you\" (singular) was spelt {{angle bracket|LK}} (Aramaic \"to you\", including the preposition ''l-''). A word could be written phonetically even when a logogram for it existed (''pitar'' could be {{angle bracket|ʼB-tr}} ''or'' {{angle bracket|pytr}}), but logograms were nevertheless used very frequently in texts.\n\nMany huzvarishn were listed in the lexicon ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]''. The practice of using these logograms appears to have originated from the use of Aramaic in the [[Chancellor|chancelleries]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/frahang-i-pahlawig | title = Encyclopedia Iranica | contribution = Frahang-i Pahlavig}}.</ref> Partly similar phenomena are found in the use of [[Sumerogram|Sumerograms and Akkadograms]] in [[ancient Mesopotamia]] and the [[Hittite empire]], and in the adaptation of [[Chinese writing]] to [[Japanese orthography|Japanese]].\n\n===Problems in reading Book Pahlavi===\nAs pointed out above, the convergence in form of many of the characters of Book Pahlavi causes a high degree of ambiguity in most Pahlavi writing and it needs to be resolved by the context. Some mergers are restricted to particular groups of words or individual spellings. Further ambiguity is added by the fact that even outside of ligatures, the boundaries between letters are not clear, and many letters look identical to combinations of other letters. As an example, one may take the fact that the name of God, ''[[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]]'', could equally be read (and, by [[Parsi people|Parsis]], often was read) ''Anhoma''. Historically speaking, it was spelt {{angle bracket|ʼwhrmzd}}, a fairly straightforward spelling for an [[abjad]].  However, {{angle bracket|w}} had coalesced with {{angle bracket|n}}; {{angle bracket|r}} had coalesced, in the spelling of certain words, with both {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|w}}; and {{angle bracket|z}} had been reduced, in the spelling of certain words, to a form whose combination with {{angle bracket|d}} was indistinguishable from a {{angle bracket|ʼ}}, which in turn had coalesced with {{angle bracket|h}}. This meant that the same orthographic form that stood for {{angle bracket|ʼwhrmzd}} could also be interpreted as {{angle bracket|ʼnhwmh}} (among many other possible readings). The logograms could also pose problems. For this reason, important religious texts were sometimes transcribed into the phonetically unambiguous [[Avestan alphabet]]. This latter system is called [[Pazend]].\n\n==Literary dialects==\nFrom a formal historical and linguistic point of view, the Pahlavi script does not have a one-to-one correspondence with any Middle Iranian language: none was written in Pahlavi exclusively, and inversely, the Pahlavi script was used for more than one language. Still, the vast majority of surviving Pahlavi texts are in Middle Persian, hence the occasional use of the term \"Pahlavi\" to refer to that language.\n\n===Arsacid Pahlavi=== <!-- this is the term used by Kent et al. -->\n{{Main|Parthian language}}\nFollowing the overthrow of the [[Seleucid]]s, the [[Parthia]]n [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]]s—who considered themselves the legitimate heirs of the [[Achaemenid]]s—adopted the manner, customs and government of the Persian court of two centuries previously. Among the many practices so adopted was the use of the [[Aramaic language]] (\"[[Aramaic language#Imperial Aramaic|Imperial Aramaic]]\") that together with [[Aramaic script]] served as the language of the chancellery. By the end of the Arsacid era, the written Aramaic words had come to be understood as [[logogram]]s, as explained above.\n\nThe use of Pahlavi gained popularity following its adoption as the language/script of the commentaries (''Zend'') on the [[Avesta]].<ref name=\"Mirza_2002_162\"/><ref name=\"Dhalla_1922_269\">{{harvnb|Dhalla|1922|p=269}}.</ref> Propagated by the priesthood, who were not only considered to be transmitters of all knowledge but were also instrumental in government, the use of Pahlavi eventually reached all corners of the Parthian Arsacid empire.\n\nArsacid Pahlavi is also called Parthian Pahlavi (or just Parthian), Chaldeo-Pahlavi, or Northwest Pahlavi, the latter reflecting its apparent development from a dialect that was almost identical to that of the Medes.<ref name=\"Kent_1953\" />\n\n===Sasanian Pahlavi=== <!-- \"Sasanian Pahlavi\" is the term used by Kent et al. -->\n{{Main|Middle Persian}}\nFollowing the defeat of the Parthian Arsacids by the Persian Sasanians ([[Sassanid]]s), the latter inherited the empire and its institutions, and with it the use of the Aramaic-derived language and script. Like the Parthians before him, [[Ardeshir I|Ardeshir]], the founder of the second Persian Empire, projected himself as a successor to the regnal traditions of the first, in particular those of [[Artaxerxes II]], whose throne name the new emperor adopted.\n\nFrom a linguistic point of view, there was probably only little disruption. Since the Sassanids had inherited the bureaucracy, in the beginning the affairs of government went on as before, with the use of dictionaries such as the [[Frahang-i Pahlavig]] assisting the transition. The royalty themselves came from a priestly tradition (Ardeshir's father and grandfather were both, in addition to being kings, also priests), and as such would have been proficient in the language and script.  More importantly, being both Western Middle [[Iranian languages]], Parthian was closely related to the dialect of the southwest (which was more properly called ''Pārsi'',<ref name=\"Boyce_2002_106\"/> that is, the language of [[Fars Province|Pārsā]], Persia proper).\n\nArsacid Pahlavi did not die out with the Arsacids. It is represented in some bilingual inscriptions alongside the Sassanid Pahlavi; by the parchment manuscripts of Auroman; and by certain [[Manichaeanism|Manichaean]] texts from [[Turpan]]. Furthermore, the archaic orthography of Sasanian Pahlavi continued to reflect, in many respects, pronunciations that had been used in Arsacid times (in Parthia as well as Fars) and not its contemporary pronunciation.\n\nSasanian Pahlavi is also called Sassanid Pahlavi, Persian Pahlavi, or Southwest Pahlavi.\n\n===Post-conquest Pahlavi===\nFollowing the Islamic conquest of the Sassanids, the term ''Pahlavi'' came to refer to the (written) \"language\" of the southwest (i.e. Pārsi). How this came to pass remains unclear, but it has been assumed<ref name=\"Boyce_2002_106\"/> that this was simply because it was the dialect that the conquerors would have been most familiar with. <!-- In return, by the 9th century, the term ''Pārsi'' (or ''Farsi'' in Arabic-Persian) came to apply nominally to any Iranian, and hence his/her language, which by then was rendered in Arabic script. -->\n\n{{Anchor|Zoroastrian_Middle_Persian}}As the language and script of religious and semi-religious commentaries, Pahlavi remained in use long after that language had been superseded (in general use) by Modern Persian and Arabic script had been adopted as the means to render it. As late as the 17th century, Zoroastrian priests in Iran admonished their Indian co-religionists to learn it.<ref name=\"Rivayat_382\">{{harvnb|Dhabar|1932}} ''R''382</ref>\n\nPost-conquest Pahlavi (or just Pahlavi) is also called '''Zoroastrian Pahlavi''' or '''Zoroastrian Middle Persian'''.\n\n==Unicode==\n\n{{Main|Inscriptional Pahlavi (Unicode block)|Inscriptional Parthian (Unicode block)|Psalter Pahlavi (Unicode block)}}\nTables showing the letters and their names or pronunciations are available online.<ref name=tables>{{Citation | url = http://www.ancientscripts.com/pahlavi.html | title = Pahlavi script |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204071933/http://www.ancientscripts.com/pahlavi.html|archivedate=December 4, 2016|deadurl=no}} gives pronunciations.

One possible reason for this could be that in the early 19th century, British English had not yet started to drop its non-intervocalic ''r''s.</ref> {{As of|1996}}, Pitman shorthand was the most popular shorthand system used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the second most popular in the [[United States]].<ref>Daniels, Peter T. \"Shorthand\", in Daniels, Peter T. and Bright, William, ''The World's Writing Systems'', Oxford University Press, New York, 1996, p. 811. {{ISBN|0-19-507993-0}}.</ref>\n\nOne characteristic feature of Pitman shorthand is that [[unvoiced]] and [[voiced]] pairs of sounds (such as /p/ and /b/ or /t/ and /d/) are represented by strokes which differ only in thickness; the thin stroke representing \"light\" sounds such as /p/ and /t/; the thick stroke representing \"heavy\" sounds such as /b/ and /d/. Doing this requires a writing instrument responsive to the user's drawing pressure: specialist [[fountain pen]]s (with fine, flexible nibs) were originally used, but [[pencil]]s are now more commonly used.\n\nPitman shorthand uses straight strokes and quarter-circle strokes, in various orientations, to represent [[consonant]] sounds.  The predominant way of indicating [[vowel]]s is to use light or heavy dots, dashes, or other special marks drawn close to the consonant. Vowels are drawn before the stroke (or over a horizontal stroke) if the vowel is pronounced before the consonant, and after the stroke (or under a horizontal stroke) if pronounced after the consonant. Each vowel, whether indicated by a dot for a short vowel or by a dash for a longer, more drawn-out vowel, has its own position relative to its adjacent stroke (beginning, middle, or end) to indicate different vowel sounds in an unambiguous system. However, to increase writing speed, rules of \"vowel indication\" exist whereby the consonant stroke is raised, kept on the line, or lowered to match whether the first vowel of the word is written at the beginning, middle, or end of a consonant stroke—without actually writing the vowel. This is often enough to distinguish words with similar consonant patterns. Another method of vowel indication is to choose from among a selection of different strokes for the same consonant. For example, the sound \"R\" has two kinds of strokes: round, or straight-line, depending on whether there is a vowel sound before or after the R.\n\nThere have been several versions of Pitman's shorthand since 1837. The original Pitman's shorthand had an \"alphabet\" of consonants, which was later modified. Additional modifications and rules were added to successive versions. Pitman New Era (1922–1975) had the most developed set of rules and abbreviation lists. Pitman 2000 (1975–present) introduced some simplifications and drastically reduced the list of abbreviations to reduce the memory load, officially reduced to a list of 144 short forms. The later versions dropped certain symbols and introduced other simplifications to earlier versions. For example, strokes \"rer\" (heavy curved downstroke) and \"kway\" (hooked horizontal straight stroke) are present in Pitman's New Era, but not in Pitman's 2000.\n\n==History==\nPitman was asked to create a shorthand system of his own in 1837. He had used [[Taylor shorthand|Samuel Taylor's system]] for seven years, but his symbols bear greater similarity to the older [[John Byrom|Byrom]] system. The first [[phonetics|phonetician]] to invent a system of shorthand, Pitman used similar-looking symbols for phonetically related sounds. He was the first to use thickness of a stroke to indicate [[voiced consonant|voicing]] (voiced consonants such as {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are written with heavier lines than unvoiced ones such as /p/ and /t/), and consonants with similar [[place of articulation]] were oriented in similar directions, with straight lines for [[plosive consonant|plosives]] and arcs for [[fricative]]s. For example, the [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] consonants are upright: {{angle bracket|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}} = {{IPA|/t/}}, {{angle bracket|'''<nowiki>|</nowiki>'''}} = {{IPA|/d/}}, {{angle bracket|)}} = {{IPA|/s/}}, {{angle bracket|''')'''}} = {{IPA|/z/}}, {{angle bracket|(}} = {{IPA|/θ/}} (as in ''thigh''), {{angle bracket|'''('''}} = {{IPA|/ð/}} (as in ''thy'').\n\nPitman's brother [[Benjamin Pitman]] settled in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], in the United States and introduced Pitman's system there. He used it in the 1865–67 trial of the conspirators behind the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. In [[Australia]] the system was introduced by another Pitman brother, [[Jacob Pitman|Jacob]]. Jacob Pitman is buried in Sydney's [[Rookwood Necropolis]], in Australia. The epitaph is written phonetically.<ref>[http://www.newchurch.org.au/hurstville/Aug_2002_Newsletter.html#Rev%20Jacob%20Pitman%20Discovered The New Church Newsletter – Hurstville Society August 2002]</ref> <blockquote>IN LUVING MEMERI OV JACOB PITMAN, BORN NOV. 28, 1810 TROWBRIDGE ENGLAND, SETELD IN ADELAIDE 1838 DEID 12TH MARCH 1890 ARKITEKT INTRODIUST FONETIK SHORTHAND AND WOZ THE FERST MINISTER IN THEEZ KOLONIZ OV THE DOKTRINZ OV THE SEKOND OR NIU KRISTIAN CHURCH WHICH AKNOLEJEZ THE LORD JESUS CHRIST IN HIZ DEVEIN HIUMANITI AZ THE KREATER OV THE YUNIVERS THE REDEEMER AND REJENERATER OV MEN GOD OVER AUL BLESED FOR EVER.</blockquote>\n\nAt one time, Pitman was the most commonly used shorthand system in the entire English-speaking world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Pitman Shorthand |publisher=Sir Isaac Pitman & Sons (Canada), Ltd. |year=1937 |location=Toronto}}</ref> Part of its popularity was due to the fact that it was the first subject taught by [[correspondence course]]. Today in many regions (especially the U.S.), it has been superseded by [[Gregg shorthand]], developed by [[John Robert Gregg]]. [[Teeline]] has become more common in recent years, as it is based on spelling, rather than pronunciation.\n\n==Writing==\nLike [[Gregg shorthand]], Pitman shorthand is phonetic; with the exception of abbreviated shapes called logograms, words are written exactly as they are pronounced. There are twenty-four consonants that can be represented in Pitman's shorthand, twelve vowels and four [[diphthong]]s. The consonants are indicated by strokes, the vowels by interposed dots.\n\n===Logograms (Short Forms)===\n[[File:Pitman Short Forms.svg|border|700px]]\n\nCommon words are represented by special outlines called logograms (or \"Short Forms\" in Pitman's New Era). Words and phrases which have such forms are called grammalogues. Hundreds exist and only a tiny number are shown above. The shapes are written separately to show that they represent distinct words, but in common phrases (\"you are\", \"thank you\", etc.) two or three logograms may be joined together, or a final flick added to represent ''the''.\n\n===Consonants===\n[[File:Pitman Consonants.PNG]]\n\nThe consonants in Pitman's shorthand are pronounced ''bee, pee, dee, tee, jay, chay, gay, kay, vee, eff, thee, ith, zee, ess, zhee, ish,  em, el, en, ray ar, ing, way, yay,'' and ''hay''. When both an unvoiced consonant and its corresponding voiced consonant are present in this system, the distinction is made by drawing the stroke for the voiced consonant ''thicker'' than the one for the unvoiced consonant. (Thus ''s'' is {{angle bracket|)}} and ''z'' is {{angle bracket|''')'''}}.) There are two strokes for ''r'': ''ar'' and ''ray''. The former assumes the form of the top right-hand quarter of a circle (drawn top down), whereas the latter is like ''chay'' {{angle bracket|/}}, only less steep (drawn bottom to top). There are rules governing when to use each of these forms.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe long vowels in Pitman's shorthand are: {{IPA|/ɑː/, /eɪ/, /iː/, /ɔː/, /oʊ/, and /uː/}}. The short vowels are {{IPA|/æ/, /ɛ/, /ɪ/, /ɒ/, /ʌ/, and /ʊ/}}. The long vowels may be remembered by the sentence, \"Pa, may we all go too?\" {{IPA|/pɑː <nowiki>|</nowiki> meɪ wiː ɔːl ɡoʊ tuː/}}, and the short vowels may be remembered by the sentence, \"That pen is not much good\" {{IPA|/ðæt pɛn ɪz nɒt mʌt͡ʃ ɡʊd/}}.\n\nA vowel is represented by a dot or a dash, which can be written either lightly or heavily depending on the vowel needed. As this gives only four symbols, they can be written in three different positions – either at the beginning, middle or end of a consonant stroke – to represent the 12 vowels.  \n\nThe dots and dashes representing long vowels are darker than the ones representing short vowels. For example, ''say'' is written as \")•\", but ''seh'' (if it did exist) would be written as \")·\"; ''see'' is written as \")'''.'''\", but ''sih'' (if there were such a word) would be written as \").\".\n\nAnother feature of Pitman's shorthand allows most vowels to be omitted in order to speed up the process of writing. As mentioned above, each vowel is written next to the consonant stroke at the beginning, middle or end of the stroke. Pitman's shorthand is designed to be written on lined paper and when a word's first vowel is a \"first position\" vowel (i.e. it is written at the beginning of the stroke), the whole shorthand outline for the word is written above the paper's ruled line. When it is a second position vowel, the outline is written on the line. And when it is a third position vowel it is written through the line. In this way, the position of the outline indicates that the first vowel can only be one of four possibilities. In most cases, this means that the first and often all the other vowels can be omitted entirely.\n\n===Diphthongs===\n<math>ie \\;\\;\\; ^\\lor \\qquad oi \\;\\;\\; ^\\mathfrak{7} \\qquad ow \\;\\;\\; _\\land \\qquad ew \\;\\;\\; _\\cap</math>\n\nThere are four diphthongs in Pitman's shorthand, representing {{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}}, {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|j|uː}}, as in the words \"'''I''' enj'''oy''' G'''ow''''s m'''u'''sic.\" The first three appear as small checkmarks; the \"ew\" sound is written as a small arch. Both \"ie\" and \"oi\" are written in first position, while \"ow\" and \"ew\" are written in third position. In the same way, the whole outline is placed above, on or through the paper's ruled line. If the diphthong is followed by a neutral vowel, a little flick is added.\n\n===Other shapes===\n;Circles: The circles are of two sizes – small and large. Small circle represents 's' (sing) and 'z' (gaze). Big circle represents 'ses' and 'swa'. If the big circle comes initially in the stroke it represents 'swa' (sweep, but not sway). Elsewhere it represents 'ses' the vowel in the middle can be any of the vowel or diphthong (crisis, crises and exercise). If the vowel is anything other than 'e' then it must be represented inside the circle.\n\n;Loops:The loops are of two sizes – small and big. The small loop represents 'st' and 'sd' (cost and based) – pronounced stee loop. The big loop represents 'ster' (master and masterpiece). 'ster' loop does not come in the beginning of a word (sterling).\n\n;Small hooks\n:'''At the start.''' For straight strokes pee, bee, tee, dee, chay, jay, kay and gay the hook comes in both the sides of the stroke. Hook in clockwise direction represents 'r' after the stroke (tray, Nichrome, bigger). Hook in counter-clockwise direction represents 'l' after the stroke (ply, amplify, angle). For curved strokes eff, vee, ith, thee, ish, zhee, em, en, ing the hook is written in before the stroke is written and it represents 'r' after the stroke (other, measure, manner, every).\n:'''At the end.''' For straight strokes pee, bee, tee, dee, chay, jay, kay and gay the hook comes in both the sides of the stroke. Hook in clockwise direction represents 'en' after the stroke (train, chin, ge'''n'''uine). Hook in counter-clockwise direction represents 'eff' or 'vee' after the stroke (pave, calf, toughen). For curved strokes eff, vee, ith, thee, ish, zhee, em, en, ing the hook is written in after the stroke is written and it represents 'n' after the stroke (men, thin).\n\n;Shun hook\nThe shun hook is written on the right hand side of a simple t, d or j.\n:The big hook after any stroke represents 'shun', 'zhun' etc. (fusion, vision).\n:#For straight strokes with initial circle or loop or hook, the shun hook is written in opposite direction (section). Depression and depletion have shun hooks in different directions.\n:#For simple straight strokes, the shun hook is written in the direction opposite to the occurrence of the vowel. Caution and auction have shun hooks in different directions.\n:#For curved strokes, the shun hook is written after the stroke, continuing the curve (motion, notion).\nTo represent the sound s-shun as in sessation, decision, musician etc. you write a small circle and continue round to form a small hook.\n\n;Other hooks\n:'''Big hook for 'wh'.''' The big hook in the beginning of the stroke way represents 'wh' (whine).\n:'''Hook before ell.''' The small hook before ell represents 'way' before it (well). The big hook before ell represents 'wh' before it (while).---\n\n===Halving and doubling===\nMany strokes (both straight and curved) may be halved in length to denote\na final \"t\" or \"d\". The halving principle may be combined with an initial or final hook (or both) to make words such as \"trained\" appear as a single short vertical light stroke with an initial and final hook.  There are some exceptions to avoid ambiguous forms:  a straight-r stroke can't be halved if it's the only syllable, because that might be confused for some other short-form (logogram) consisting of a short-stroke mark in that direction (\"and\" or \"should\").\n\n;Doubling of curved strokes: If ter, der, ture, ther, dher comes in the word the preceding stroke is written double the size (matter, nature, mother).  There are exceptions to avoid ambiguous forms:  for example, \"leader\" is not written as a doubled-l but as l plus a hooked-d representing \"dr\". (But, e.g., \"later\" is a doubled-l.)\n\n;Doubling of straight strokes: the doubling principle has an exception when \"ter\" ''et al.'', is preceded by only a straight stroke. Doubling is not employed in that case (cadre). If it has more than one stroke before \"ter\" ''et al.'', or has a hook at the end (tender), or a joined diphthong (pewter), then the doubling principle is employed.\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe protagonist of [[David R. Palmer]]'s novels ''Emergence'' and ''Tracking'' purportedly writes her journals in Pitman Shorthand, declaring it the \"best, potentially fastest, most versatile of various pen systems\".\n\nThe Vogons in the 2005 movie version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' use a blockier form of Pitman 2000.<ref name=\"test\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/trivia] {{unreliable?|date=April 2019}}</ref>\n\nLinguist [[Henry Sweet]] dubbed Pitman's Shorthand \"Pitfall Shorthand\" in his 1892 ''Manual of Current Shorthand''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sweet|first=Henry|title=A Manual of Current Shorthand, Orthographic and Phonetic|year=1892|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://cdm16471.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15457coll1/id/105/rec/1}}</ref>\n\nIn the preface to his play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', [[George Bernard Shaw]] cites [[Henry Sweet]]'s \"Pitfall Shorthand\" comment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shaw|first=George Bernard|title=Pygmalion|year=1912|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3825/pg3825.txt}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Pitman |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Pitman |title=Pitman Shorthand Instructor and Key: A Complete Exposition of Sir Isaac Pitman's System of Shorthand |publisher=Pitman Australia |location=Carlton, Victoria (Australia) |isbn=0-85896-065-6}}\n*{{cite book |title=A Manual of Phonography; or, Writing by Sound|last=Pitman |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Pitman |year=1845 |publisher=S.

In the 19th century there were scholars who subscribed to the theory of the Egyptian origin, while other theories held that the Phoenician script developed from [[Akkadian cuneiform]], [[Cretan hieroglyphs]], the [[Cypriot syllabary]], and [[Anatolian hieroglyphs]].<ref>{{citation | author1=Joseph Naveh | author2=Solomon Asher Birnbaum | author3=David Diringer | author4=Zvi Hermann Federbush | author5=Jonathan Shunary | author6=Jacob Maimon | entry=ALPHABET, HEBREW | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=1 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=689–728 | isbn=978-0-02-865929-9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[#Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions|Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions]] were studied by [[Alan Gardiner]] who, based on a short bilingual inscription on a stone sphinx, identified the inscriptions as Semitic, reading ''{{transl|ar|DIN|mʾhbʿl}}'' as \"the beloved of the Lady\" (''{{transl|ar|DIN|mʾhb}}'' \"beloved\", with the second ''b'' and the final ''t'' of ''{{transl|ar|DIN|bʿlt}}'' \"Lady\" missing).\n\n[[William F. Albright|William Albright]] in the 1950s and 1960s published interpretations of Proto-Sinaitic as the key to show the derivation of the Canaanite alphabet from [[hieratic]],<ref>William F. Albright, ''The Proto-Sinaitic Inscriptions and their Decipherment'' (1966)</ref> leading to the commonly accepted belief that the language of the inscriptions was Semitic and that the script had a hieratic prototype.\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions, along with the contemporary parallels found in Canaan and Wadi el-Hol, are thus hypothesized to show an intermediate step between Egyptian [[Hieratic]] and the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. Brian Colless (2014) notes that 18 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet have counterparts in the Byblos syllabary, and it seems that the proto-alphabet evolved as a simplification of the syllabary, moving from syllabic to consonantal writing, in the style of the Egyptian script (which did not normally indicate vowels); this goes against the Goldwasser hypothesis (2010) that the original alphabet was invented by ignorant miners in Sinai.\n\nAccording to the \"alphabet theory\", the early Semitic proto-alphabet reflected in the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions would have given rise to both the [[Ancient South Arabian script]] and the [[Proto-Canaanite alphabet]] by the time of the [[Late Bronze Age collapse]] (1200–1150 BCE).<ref name=\"healy18\"/>\n\nThe theory centers on Albright's hypothesis that only the graphic form of the Proto-Sinaitic characters derive from Egyptian hieroglyphs, and that they were given the sound value of the [[acrophony|first consonant]] of the Semitic translation of the hieroglyph (many hieroglyphs had already been used acrophonically in Egyptian):\nFor example, the hieroglyph for [[Pr (hieroglyph)|''pr'']] \"house\" (a rectangle partially open along one side, \"O1\" in [[Gardiner's sign list]]) was adopted to write Semitic {{IPA|/b/}}, after the first consonant of ''baytu'', the Semitic word for \"house\".<ref name=BAR/><ref>This is in marked contrast to the history of adoption of the Phoenician alphabet in the Iron Age (where ''ʾālep'' gave rise to the Greek letter ''aleph'', i.e. the Semitic term for \"ox\" was left untranslated and adopted as simply the name of the letter).</ref>\nAccording to the alphabet hypothesis, the shapes of the letters would have evolved from Proto-Sinaitic forms into Phoenician forms, but most of the names of the letters would have remained the same.\n\n===Synopsis===\nBelow is a table synoptically showing selected Proto-Sinaitic signs and the proposed correspondences with Phoenician letters. Also shown are the sound values, names, and descendants of the Phoenician letters.<ref>Based on Simons (2011),\n* Figure Two: \"Representative selection of proto-Sinaitic characters with comparison to Egyptian hieroglyphs\" (p.&nbsp;38),\n* Figure Three: \"Chart of all early proto-Canaanite letters with comparison to proto-Sinaitic signs\" (p.&nbsp;39),\n* Figure Four: \"Representative selection of later proto-Canaanite letters with comparison to early proto-Canaanite and proto-Sinaitic signs\" (p.&nbsp;40).\n\nSee also: Goldwasser (2010), following Albright (1966), \"Schematic Table of Proto-Sinaitic Characters\" ([http://www.apocalypse2008-2015.com/images/Proto-Sinaitic_Table.gif fig. 1]).\n\nA comparison of glyphs from western (\"Proto-Canaanite\", Byblos) and southern scripts along with the reconstructed \"Linear Ugaritic\" (Lundin 1987) is found in Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz, ''Die Keilalphabete: die phönizisch-kanaanäischen und altarabischen Alphabete in Ugarit'', Ugarit-Verlag, 1988, p. 102, reprinted in Wilfred G.

All these scripts are believed to be descendants of the [[Proto-Sinaitic script]]. That script was used by the ancient [[Israelites]], both [[Jews]] and Samaritans. The better-known \"square script\" [[Hebrew alphabet]] traditionally used by Jews is a stylized version of the [[Aramaic alphabet]] called \"Assyrian writing\" (כתב אשורי) which they adopted from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] (which in turn adopted it from the [[Arameans]]). After the fall of the Persian Empire, Judaism used both scripts before settling on the Aramaic form. For a limited time thereafter, the use of paleo-Hebrew (proto-Samaritan) among Jews was retained only to write the [[Tetragrammaton]], but soon that custom was also abandoned.\n\nThe Samaritan alphabet first became known to the Western world with the publication of a manuscript of the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]] in 1631 by [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IOAtAAAAYAAJ Exercitationes ecclesiasticae in utrumque Samaritanorum Pentateuchum], 1631</ref> In 1616 the traveler [[Pietro della Valle]] had purchased a copy of the text in [[Damascus]], and this manuscript, now known as Codex B, was deposited in a [[Paris]]ian library.{{sfn| Flôrenṭîn|2005|p=1|ps=: \"When the Samaritan version of the Pentateuch was revealed to the Western world early in the 17th century...

The cursive script is thus named because its letters are connected with a base line.  Since many letters in the cursive script are extremely similar in form, to the point of being indistinguishable, it is the most difficult to read of the three varieties.<ref name=coulmas/>  As the Sogdian alphabet became more cursive and more stylized, some letters became more difficult to distinguish, or were distinguished only in final position, e.g. ''n'' and ''z''.<ref name=daniels/>\n\n==Source materials==\n\nThe Sogdian script is known from religious texts of [[Buddhism]], [[Manichaeism]], and [[Christianity]], as well as from secular sources such as letters, coins, and legal documents.  The oldest known Sogdian documents are the Ancient Letters, found in 1920 by [[Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]] in a watchtower near [[Dunhuang]], China.<ref name=coulmas/>  These letters date to approximately 312-313 C.E. and are written in Early Sogdian.<ref name=gharib/>\n\nThe Sogdian Buddhist texts, written in the sutra script, are younger, dating to approximately the sixth to eighth or ninth century.  They were found during the first two decades of the twentieth century in one of the caves of the Thousand Buddhas in the Chinese province of [[Gansu]].  The bulk of these manuscripts reside in the [[British Museum]], the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=gharib/>\n\nAnother important discovery was of the Mug Documents in 1933 by Soviet scholars. These documents were found in the remains of a fortress on Mount Mug in northern [[Tajikistan]]. The documents, numbering over 76, were written on many different types of materials, such as paper, silk, wood, and skin. According to the dates on the documents, they date to the eighth century C.E.  The majority of them were written using the Sogdian cursive script.<ref name=gharib/>\n\n==Child writing systems==\n[[File:Bugut.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Sogdian script on the Bugut Inscription (585), central [[Mongolia]]. Sogdian is the distant ancestor of the Mongolian script.]]\nThe \"Uyghur\" cursive script eventually developed into the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]], which was used to write the [[Old Uyghur language]].<ref name=coulmas/>  This child script was, however, rotated 90 degrees, written in a vertical direction from top to bottom, but with the first vertical line starting from the left side, not from the right as in Chinese, most probably because the [[right-to-left]] direction was used in horizontal writing.  The [[Traditional Mongolian alphabet]], being an adaptation of the Old Uyghur alphabet, still uses this kind of vertical writing, as does its more remote descendant [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu]].<ref name=mote>{{Citation|title=Imperial China, 900-1800|author=F.W.

It has 30 letters. Other languages (particularly [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]) were occasionally written in the Ugaritic script in the area around Ugarit, although not elsewhere.\n\n[[Clay tablet]]s written in Ugaritic provide the earliest evidence of both the North Semitic and South Semitic orders of the alphabet, which gave rise to the alphabetic orders of the reduced [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] alphabet and its descendants (including [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]) on the one hand, and of the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] on the other.  [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Old South Arabian]] are the only other Semitic alphabets which have letters for all or almost all of the 29 commonly reconstructed [[proto-Semitic]] consonant phonemes. (But note that several of these distinctions were only secondarily added to the Arabic alphabet by means of diacritic dots.) According to Manfried Dietrich and Oswald Loretz in ''Handbook of Ugaritic Studies'' (eds. Wilfred G.E. Watson and Nicholas Wyatt, 1999): \"The language they [the 30 signs] represented could be described as an idiom which in terms of content seemed to be comparable to Canaanite texts, but from a phonological perspective, however, was more like Arabic\" (82, 89, 614).\n\nThe script was written from left to right. Although cuneiform and pressed into clay, its symbols were unrelated to those of [[cuneiform script|Akkadian cuneiform]].<ref>''The Early Alphabet'' by John F. Healey in ''Reading the Past: Ancient Writing from Cuneiform to the Alphabet'' (1990) {{isbn|0-520-07431-9}}, p. 216.</ref>\n\n==Function==\nUgaritic was an augmented [[abjad]]. In most syllables only consonants were written, including the {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} of [[diphthong]]s. However, Ugaritic was unusual among early abjads in also writing vowels after the [[glottal stop]]. It is thought that the letter for the syllable {{IPA|/ʔa/}} originally represented the consonant {{IPA|/ʔ/}}, as aleph does in other Semitic abjads, and that it was later restricted to {{IPA|/ʔa/}} with the addition, at the end of the alphabet, of {{IPA|/ʔi/}} and {{IPA|/ʔu/}}.<ref>Florian Coulmas, 1991, ''The writing systems of the world''</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com.eg/books?id=L2T_4KVwpTQC&pg=PA149&dq=glottals+AND+Ugaritic&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yUdaT_TNAs7XsgaNwuD_Cw&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=aleph&f=false William Schniedewind, Joel Hunt, 2007.

Other letters look similar as well: 𐎅 h resembles its assumed Greek cognate E, while 𐎆 w, 𐎔 p, and 𐎘 θ are similar to Greek Y, Π, and Σ turned on their sides.<ref name=\"colless\" /> [[Jared Diamond]]<ref>[http://discovermagazine.com/1994/jun/writingright384 Writing Right | Senses | DISCOVER Magazine<!--Bot-generated title-->]</ref> believes the alphabet was consciously designed, citing as evidence the possibility that the letters with the fewest strokes may have been the most frequent.\n\n==Abecedaries==\nLists of Ugaritic letters (abecedaria, singular [[abecedarium]]) have been found in two alphabetic orders: the \"Northern Semitic order\" more similar to the one found in [[Arabic Alphabet|Arabic]] (earlier order), [[Hebrew Alphabet|Hebrew]] and [[Phoenician Alphabet|Phoenician]], and more distantly, the [[Greek Alphabet|Greek]] and [[Latin alphabet]]s; and the \"Southern Semitic order\" more similar to the one found in the [[South Arabian alphabet|South Arabian]], and the [[Ge'ez alphabet]]s.

It is written from right to left in a [[cursive]] style and includes 28 letters. Most letters have contextual letterforms.\n\nThe Arabic alphabet is considered an abjad, meaning it only uses [[consonant]]s, but it is now considered an \"[[impure abjad]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Natural Language Processing of Semitic Languages|last=Zitouni|first=Imed|publisher=Springer Science & Business|year=2014|isbn=3642453589|location=|pages=15}}</ref> As with other impure ''abjads'', such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]], scribes later devised means of indicating [[vowel]] sounds by separate vowel [[diacritics]].\n\n==Consonants==\nThe basic Arabic alphabet contains 28 [[letter (alphabet)|letters]]. Adaptations of the [[Arabic script]] for other languages added and removed some letters, as for [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Jawi script|Malay]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Arwi]] and [[Malayalam]] ([[Arabi Malayalam]]), all of which have additional letters as shown below. There are no distinct [[letter case|upper and lower case]] letter forms.\n\nMany letters look similar but are distinguished from one another by dots (''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Arabic diacritics#I'jam (phonetic distinctions of consonants)|ʾiʿjām]]}}'') above or below their central part (''{{transl|ar|[[rasm]]}}''). These dots are an integral part of a letter, since they distinguish between letters that represent different sounds. For example, the Arabic letters ب (b), ت (t), and ث (th) have the same basic shape, but have one dot below, two dots above, and three dots above; the letter ن (n) also has the same form in initial and medial forms, with one dot above, though it is somewhat different in isolated and final form.\n\nBoth printed and written Arabic are [[cursive]], with most of the letters within a word directly connected to the adjacent letters.\n\n===Alphabetical order===\nThere are two main [[collation|collating sequences]] for the Arabic alphabet: abjad and hija.\n\nThe original ''{{transl|ar|ʾabjadīy}}'' order ({{lang|ar|أَبْجَدِيّ}}), used for [[lettering]], derives from the order of the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and is therefore similar to the order of other Phoenician-derived alphabets, such as the [[Hebrew alphabet]]. In this order, letters are also used as numbers, [[Abjad numerals]], and possess the same alphanumeric code/[[cipher]] as Hebrew [[gematria]] and Greek [[isopsephy]].\n\nThe ''{{transl|ar|hijā’ī}}'' ({{lang|ar|هِجَائِي}}) or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alifbāʾī}}'' ({{lang|ar|أَلِفْبَائِي}}) order, used where lists of names and words are sorted, as in phonebooks, classroom lists, and dictionaries, groups letters by similarity of shape.\n\n==== Abjadī ====\nThe ''{{transl|ar|ʾabjadī}}'' order is not a simple historical continuation of the earlier north Semitic alphabetic order, since it has a position corresponding to the Aramaic letter ''[[samekh]]/semkat'' {{lang|he|ס}}, yet no letter of the Arabic alphabet historically derives from that letter. Loss of ''{{transl|he|sameḵ}}'' was compensated for by the split of ''[[shin (letter)|shin]]'' {{lang|he|ש}} into two independent Arabic letters, {{lang|ar|ش}} (''shīn'') and {{lang|ar|ﺱ}} (''sīn'') which moved up to take the place of ''{{transl|he|sameḵ}}''. The six other letters that do not correspond to any north Semitic letter are placed at the end.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Common ''{{transl|ar|ALA|abjadī}}'' sequence\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|غ}} || {{lang|ar|ظ}} || {{lang|ar|ض}} || {{lang|ar|ذ}} || {{lang|ar|خ}} || {{lang|ar|ث}} || {{lang|ar|ت}} || {{lang|ar|ش}} || {{lang|ar|ر}} || {{lang|ar|ق}} || {{lang|ar|ص}} || {{lang|ar|ف}} || {{lang|ar|ع}} || {{lang|ar|س}} || {{lang|ar|ن}} || {{lang|ar|م}} || {{lang|ar|ل}} || {{lang|ar|ك}} || {{lang|ar|ي}} || {{lang|ar|ط}} || {{lang|ar|ح}} || {{lang|ar|ز}} || {{lang|ar|و}} || {{lang|ar|ه}} || {{lang|ar|د}} || {{lang|ar|ج}} || {{lang|ar|ب}} || {{lang|ar|أ}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|ẓ}} || {{transl|ar|ḍ}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|ṣ}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|ʿ}}''' || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|ṭ}} || {{transl|ar|ḥ}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|ʾ}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow  |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n|}\n\nThis is commonly vocalized as follows:\n: ''{{transl|ar|ʾabjad hawwaz ḥuṭṭī kalaman saʿfaṣ qarashat thakhadh ḍaẓagh}}''.\nAnother vocalization is:\n: ''{{transl|ar|ʾabujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman saʿfaṣ qurishat thakhudh ḍaẓugh}}''{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ [[Maghreb]]ian ''{{transl|ar|abjadī}}'' sequence (probably older)<ref name=magb>{{ar icon}} [http://alyaseer.net/vb/showthread.php?t=8807 Alyaseer.net {{lang|ar|ترتيب المداخل والبطاقات في القوائم والفهارس الموضوعية}} Ordering entries and cards in subject indexes] Discussion thread ''(Accessed 2009-October–06)''</ref>\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|ش}} || {{lang|ar|غ}} || {{lang|ar|ظ}} || {{lang|ar|ذ}} || {{lang|ar|خ}} || {{lang|ar|ث}} || {{lang|ar|ت}} || {{lang|ar|س}} || {{lang|ar|ر}} || {{lang|ar|ق}} || {{lang|ar|ض}} || {{lang|ar|ف}} || {{lang|ar|ع}} || {{lang|ar|ص}} || {{lang|ar|ن}} || {{lang|ar|م}} || {{lang|ar|ل}} || {{lang|ar|ك}} || {{lang|ar|ي}} || {{lang|ar|ط}} || {{lang|ar|ح}} || {{lang|ar|ز}} || {{lang|ar|و}} || {{lang|ar|ه}} || {{lang|ar|د}} || {{lang|ar|ج}} || {{lang|ar|ب}} || {{lang|ar|أ}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|ẓ}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|ḍ}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || '''{{transl|ar|ʿ}}''' || {{transl|ar|ṣ}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|ṭ}} || {{transl|ar|ḥ}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|ʾ}}\n|- style=\"color:gray\"|\n| 28 || 27 || 26 || 25 || 24 || 23 || 22 || 21 || 20 || 19 || 18 || 17 || 16 || 15 || 14 || 13 || 12 || 11 || 10 || 09 || 08 || 07 || 06 || 05 || 04 || 03 || 02 || 01\n|-\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=4 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=pink |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=2 bgcolor=lightgrey |\n| colspan=1 bgcolor=yellow |\n| colspan=14 bgcolor=grey |\n|}\n\nThis can be vocalized as:\n: ''{{transl|ar|ʾabujadin hawazin ḥuṭiya kalman ṣaʿfaḍ qurisat thakhudh ẓaghush}}''\n\n==== Hijāʾī ====\nModern dictionaries and other reference books do not use the ''{{transl|ar|abjadī}}'' order to sort alphabetically; instead, the newer ''{{transl|ar|hijāʾī}}'' order is used wherein letters are partially grouped together by similarity of shape.

Letters can exhibit up to four distinct forms corresponding to an initial, medial (middle), final, or isolated position ([[IMFI]]). While some letters show considerable variations, others remain almost identical across all four positions. Generally, letters in the same word are linked together on both sides by short horizontal lines, but six letters ({{lang|ar|و ,ز ,ر ,ذ ,د ,ا}}) can only be linked to their preceding letter. For example, {{lang|ar|أرارات}} ([[Mount Ararat|Ararat]]) has only isolated forms because each letter cannot be connected to its following one. In addition, some letter combinations are written as [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]] (special shapes), notably ''{{transl|ar|lām-alif}}'' {{lang|ar|لا}},<ref>{{cite book |title=Writing Systems: A Linguistic Approach |author=Rogers, Henry |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2005 |page=135}}</ref> which is the only mandatory ligature (the un-ligated combination {{lang|ar|لـا}} is considered difficult to read).\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n\n====Table of basic letters====\n{{other uses|Arabic script}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arabic letters usage in Literary Arabic\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Common\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Maghreb]]ian\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter<br />name\n(Classical pronunciation)\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Letter<br />name in Arabic script\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Romanization of Arabic|Trans-<br />literation]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Value in Literary Arabic ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]])\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Closest English equivalent in pronunciation\n!colspan=\"3\"|Contextual forms\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Isolated<br />form\n|-\n!ʾAbjadī !!

however, Arabic language speakers may usually not follow a standardized scheme when transcribing names. Also names are regularly transcribed as pronounced locally, not as pronounced in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] (if they were of Arabic origin).\n* Regarding pronunciation, the phonemic values given are those of Modern Standard Arabic, which is taught in schools and universities. In practice, pronunciation may vary considerably from region to region. For more details concerning the pronunciation of Arabic, consult the articles ''[[Arabic phonology]]'' and ''[[varieties of Arabic]]''.\n* The names of the Arabic letters can be thought of as abstractions of an older version where they were meaningful words in the [[Proto-Semitic]] language. Names of Arabic letters may have quite different names popularly.\n* Six letters ({{lang|ar|و ز ر ذ د ا}}) do not have a distinct medial form and have to be written with their final form without being connected to the next letter. Their initial form matches the isolated form. The following letter is written in its initial form, or isolated form if it is the final letter in the word.\n* The letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' originated in the [[Phoenician alphabet]] as a consonant-sign indicating a glottal stop. Today it has lost its function as a consonant, and, together with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ya’}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'', is a ''[[mater lectionis]]'', a consonant sign standing in for a long vowel (see below), or as support for certain diacritics (''{{transl|ar|ALA|maddah}}'' and ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'').\n* Arabic currently uses a [[diacritic]] sign, {{lang|ar|ء}}, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'', to denote the [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}, written alone or with a carrier:\n** alone: {{lang|ar|ء}}\n** with a carrier: {{lang|ar|إ أ}} (above or under a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''), {{lang|ar|ؤ}} (above a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}''), {{lang|ar|ئ}} (above a dotless ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'' or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’ hamzah}}'').\n\n:In academic work, the ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|ء}}) is transliterated with the [[modifier letter right half ring]] (ʾ), while the [[modifier letter left half ring]] (ʿ) transliterates the letter ''[[Ayin|{{transl|ar|ALA|‘ayn}}]]'' ({{lang|ar|ع}}), which represents a different sound, not found in English.\n\n::The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' has a single form, since it is never linked to a preceding or following letter. However, it is sometimes combined with a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'', and in that case the carrier behaves like an ordinary ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yā’}}'', or ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n====Alif====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Instead of writing the letter twice, Arabic places a ''W''-shaped sign called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}'', above it. Note that if a vowel occurs between the two consonants the letter will simply be written twice. The [[diacritic]] only appears where the consonant at the end of one syllable is identical to the initial consonant of the following syllable. (The generic term for such [[diacritic]]al signs is ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[harakat|ḥarakāt]]}}'').\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Transliteration\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0651</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;ّ}}</span>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}\n|<big>شَدَّة</big>\n|(consonant doubled)\n|}\n\n====Nunation====\n{{Main|Nunation}}\n\nNunation ({{lang-ar|تنوين}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|tanwīn}}'') is the addition of a final ''{{transl|ar|ALA|-n}}''&nbsp; to a [[noun]] or [[adjective]]. The vowel before it indicates [[grammatical case]]. In written Arabic nunation is indicated by doubling the vowel [[diacritic]] at the end of the word.\n\n== Vowels ==\nUsers of Arabic usually write [[vowel length|long vowels]] but omit short ones, so readers must utilize their knowledge of the language in order to supply the missing vowels. However, in the education system and particularly in classes on Arabic grammar these vowels are used since they are crucial to the grammar. An Arabic sentence can have a completely different meaning by a subtle change of the vowels. This is why in an important text such as the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Qur’ān}}'' the three basic vowel signs (see below) are mandated, like the ''[[Arabic diacritics|ḥarakāt]]'' and all the other diacritics or other types of marks, for example the [[Cantillation|cantillation signs]].\n\n===Short vowels===\n{{Further|Arabic diacritics}}\n\nIn the Arabic handwriting of everyday use, in general publications, and on street signs, short vowels are typically not written. On the other hand, copies of the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Quran|Qur’ān]]}}'' cannot be endorsed by the religious institutes that review them unless the diacritics are included. Children's books, elementary school texts, and Arabic-language grammars in general will include diacritics to some degree. These are known as \"[[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]]\" texts.\n\nShort vowels may be written with [[diacritic]]s placed above or below the consonant that precedes them in the syllable, called ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḥarakāt}}''. All Arabic vowels, long and short, follow a consonant; in Arabic, words like \"Ali\" or \"alif\", for example, start with a consonant: ''{{transl|ar|‘Aliyy}}''<!--not DIN 31635 transliteration-->, ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}''.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Short vowels<br />(fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] text)\n!Code\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Trans.\n!Value\n!Remarks\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| َ}}</span>\n|<small>064E</small>\n|fat·ḥah\n|فَتْحَة\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}''\n|{{IPA|/a/}}\n|the ''fathah'' (half-short \"a\") sounds properly more like the English \"E\" (as in \"h'''''<u>e</u>'''''n\", \"m'''''<u>a</u>'''''n\") in comparison to the letter ''alif'' (<big>'''ا'''</big>) which is a full-whole \"A\" (= like the English letter \"A\" as in \"'''''<u>a</u>'''''rk\", \"'''<u>''u''</u>'''p\")\ne.g. <big>حَرَكَة</big> ''ḥarakah'' is pronounced more like ''\"ḥerekeh\"'' ; شَمْس ''shams'' is pronounced more like \"''shems''\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| ُ}}</span>\n|<small>064F</small>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}\n|ضَمَّة\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}''\n|{{IPA|/u/}}\n|English \"U\" (as \"f'''<u>''u''</u>'''ll\")\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic| ِ}}</span>\n|<small>0650</small>\n|{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}\n|كَسْرَة\n|''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}''\n|{{IPA|/i/}}\n|English \"I\" (as in \"p'''<u>''i''</u>'''ck\")\n|}\n\n===Long vowels===\nIn the fully [[Arabic diacritics|vocalized]] Arabic text found in texts such as [[Quran]], a long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}'' following a consonant other than a ''[[hamza|{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}]]'' is written with a short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'' sign (''{{transl|ar|ALA|fatḥah}}'') on the consonant plus an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾalif}}'' after it; long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ī}}'' is written as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|kasrah}}'') plus a {{transl|ar|ALA|''yāʾ''}}; and long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū}}'' as a sign for short ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'' (''{{transl|ar|ALA|ḍammah}}'') plus a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}''. Briefly, ''{{transl|ar|ᵃa}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}''; ''{{transl|ar|ⁱy}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ī}}''; and ''{{transl|ar|ᵘw}}'' = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ū}}''. Long ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}'' following a ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' may be represented by an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾalif maddah}}'' or by a free ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' followed by an ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾalif}}'' (two consecutive ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾalif}}''s are never allowed in Arabic).\n\nThe table below shows vowels placed above or below a dotted circle replacing a primary consonant letter or a ''[[Shadda|{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}]]'' sign. For clarity in the table, the primary letters on the left used to mark these long vowels are shown only in their isolated form. Please note that most consonants do connect to the left with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ʾalif}}'', ''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāw}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʾ}}'' written then with their medial or final form. Additionally, the letter ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʾ}}'' in the last row may connect to the letter on its left, and then will use a medial or initial form.

In others, these ''y'' and ''w'' carry a ''sukūn''. Outside of the ''Qur’ān'', the latter convention is extremely rare, to the point that ''y'' with ''sukūn'' will be unambiguously read as the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|/aj/}}, and ''w'' with ''sukūn'' will be read {{IPA|/aw/}}.\n\nFor example, the letters ''{{transl|ar|m-y-l}}'' can be read like English ''meel'' or ''mail'', or (theoretically) also like ''mayyal'' or ''mayil''. But if a ''sukūn'' is added on the ''y'' then the ''m'' cannot have a ''sukūn'' (because two letters in a row cannot be ''sukūn''ated), cannot have a ''ḍammah'' (because there is never an ''uy'' sound in Arabic unless there is another vowel after the ''y''), and cannot have a ''kasrah'' (because ''kasrah'' before ''sukūn''ated ''y'' is never found outside the ''Qur’ān''), so it ''must'' have a ''fatḥah'' and the only possible pronunciation is {{IPA|/majl/}} (meaning mile, or even e-mail). By the same token, m-y-t with a ''sukūn'' over the ''y'' can be ''mayt'' but not ''mayyit'' or ''meet'', and m-w-t with a ''sukūn'' on the ''w'' can only be ''mawt'', not ''moot'' (''iw'' is impossible when the ''w'' closes the syllable).\n\nVowel marks are always written as if the ''[[’I‘rab|i‘rāb]]'' vowels were in fact pronounced, even when they must be skipped in actual pronunciation. So, when writing the name ''Aḥmad'', it is optional to place a ''sukūn'' on the ''ḥ'', but a ''sukūn'' is forbidden on the ''d'', because it would carry a ''ḍammah'' if any other word followed, as in ''Aḥmadu zawjī'' \"Ahmad is my husband\".\n\nAnother example: the sentence that in correct literary Arabic must be pronounced ''Aḥmadu zawjun shirrīr'' \"Ahmad is a wicked husband\", is usually mispronounced (due to influence from vernacular Arabic varieties) as ''Aḥmad zawj shirrīr''. Yet, for the purposes of Arabic grammar and orthography, is treated as if it were not mispronounced and as if yet another word followed it, i.e., if adding any vowel marks, they must be added as if the pronunciation were ''Aḥmadu zawjun sharrīrun'' with a ''tanwīn'' 'un' at the end. So, it is correct to add an ''un'' ''tanwīn'' sign on the final ''r'', but actually pronouncing it would be a hypercorrection. Also, it is never correct to write a ''sukūn'' on that ''r'', even though in actual pronunciation it is (and in correct Arabic MUST be) ''sukūn''ed.\n\nOf course, if the correct ''i‘rāb'' is a ''sukūn'', it may be optionally written.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!General<br />Unicode\n!Name\n!Name in Arabic script\n!Translit.\n!Phonemic Value (IPA)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0652</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;ْ}}</span>\n|sukūn\n|سُكُون\n|(no vowel with this consonant letter or<br />diphthong with this long vowel letter)\n|∅\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|style=\"line-height:180%;padding:10px;\"|<small>0670</small><br /><span style=\"font-size:190%;\">{{script/Arabic|&nbsp;ٰ}}</span>\n|alif khanjariyyah [dagger ’alif - smaller ’alif written above consonant]\n| أَلِف خَنْجَرِيَّة\n|''ā''\n|{{IPA|/aː/}}\n|}\n\nThe ''sukūn'' is also used for transliterating words into the Arabic script.

In most of present-day North Africa, the usual Western Arabic numerals are used. Like Western Arabic numerals, in Eastern Arabic numerals, the units are always right-most, and the highest value left-most.\n\n===Letters as numerals===\n{{main|Abjad numerals}}\n\nIn addition, the Arabic alphabet can be used to represent numbers ([[Abjad numerals]]). This usage is based on the ''{{transl|ar|ʾabjadī}}'' order of the alphabet. {{lang|ar|أ}} ''{{transl|ar|ʾalif}}'' is 1, {{lang|ar|ب}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bāʾ}}'' is 2, {{lang|ar|ج}} ''{{transl|ar|jīm}}'' is 3, and so on until {{lang|ar|ي}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|yāʾ}}'' = 10, {{lang|ar|ك}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|kāf}}'' = 20, {{lang|ar|ل}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|lām}}'' = 30, …, {{lang|ar|ر}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|rāʾ}}'' = 200, …, {{lang|ar|غ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ghayn}}'' = 1000. This is sometimes used to produce [[chronogram]]s.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Arabic alphabet}}\n[[File:Arabic script evolution.svg|thumb|250px|Evolution of early [[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] (9th–11th century). The ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Basmala]]}}'' is taken as an example, from [[Kufic]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Qur’ān]]}}'' manuscripts. (1) Early 9th century script used no dots or [[diacritic]] marks;<ref>[[commons:File:Basmala kufi.svg|File:Basmala kufi.svg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref> (2) and (3) in the 9th–10th century during the Abbasid dynasty, [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali|Abu al-Aswad]]'s system used red dots with each arrangement or position indicating a different short vowel. Later, a second system of black dots was used to differentiate between letters like ''{{transl|ar|ALA|fā’}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|qāf}}'';<ref name=\"wikimedia1\">[[commons:File:Kufi.jpg|File:Kufi.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref><ref name=\"wikimedia1\"/> (4) in the 11th century ([[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi|al-Farāhīdī]]'s system) dots were changed into shapes resembling the letters to transcribe the corresponding long vowels. This system is the one used today.<ref>[[commons:File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg|File:Qur'an folio 11th century kufic.jpg - Wikimedia Commons]]</ref>]]\nThe Arabic alphabet can be traced back to the [[Nabataean alphabet]] used to write [[Nabataean]]. The first known text in the Arabic alphabet is a late 4th-century inscription from ''{{transl|ar|[[Jabal Ramm]]}}'' (50&nbsp;km east of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[Aqaba|‘Aqabah]]}}'') in [[Jordan]], but the first dated one is a trilingual inscription at [[Zebed]] in [[Syria]] from 512.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} However, the [[epigraphy|epigraphic]] record is extremely sparse, with only five certainly [[pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions]] surviving, though some others may be pre-Islamic. Later, dots were added above and below the letters to differentiate them. (The Aramaic language had fewer phonemes than the Arabic, and some originally distinct Aramaic letters had become indistinguishable in shape, so that in the early writings 15 distinct letter-shapes had to do duty for 28 sounds; cf. the similarly ambiguous [[Book Pahlavi|Pahlavi]] alphabet.) The first surviving document that definitely uses these dots is also the first surviving Arabic [[papyrus]] ([[PERF 558]]), dated April 643, although they did not become obligatory until much later. Important texts were and still are frequently memorized, especially in [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|Qurʾan memorization]], a practice which probably arose partially from a desire to avoid the great ambiguity of the script.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nLater still, vowel marks and the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|hamzah}}'' were introduced, beginning some time in the latter half of the 7th century, preceding the first invention of [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]] and [[Tiberian vocalization|Hebrew vocalization]]. Initially, this was done by a system of red dots, said to have been commissioned in the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] era by [[Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali]] a dot above = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|a}}'', a dot below = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|i}}'', a dot on the line = ''{{transl|ar|ALA|u}}'', and doubled dots indicated [[nunation]]. However, this was cumbersome and easily confusable with the letter-distinguishing dots, so about 100 years later, the modern system was adopted. The system was finalized around 786 by ''{{transl|ar|ALA|[[al-Farahidi|al-Farāhīdī]]}}''.\n\n=== Arabic printing presses ===\nAlthough [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] generally receives credit for introducing the printing press to [[Egypt]] during his invasion of that country in 1798, and though he did indeed bring printing presses and [[Arabic script]] presses to print the French occupation's official newspaper ''Al-Tanbiyyah'' (\"The Courier\"), printing in the Arabic language started several centuries earlier.\n\nIn 1514, following [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s invention of the printing press in 1450, Gregorio de Gregorii, a Venetian, published an entire prayer-book in Arabic script; it was entitled ''[[Kitab salat al-sawai|Kitab Salat al-Sawa'i]]'' and was intended for eastern Christian communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.viverefano.com/2014/11/19/294-anniversario-della-biblioteca-federiciana-ricerche-e-curiosit-sul-kitab-salat-al-sawai/504874/|title=294° anniversario della Biblioteca Federiciana: ricerche e curiosità sul Kitab Salat al-Sawai|access-date=2017-01-31}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1580 and 1586, type designer [[Robert Granjon]] designed Arabic typefaces for Cardinal [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando de' Medici]], and the [[Medici Oriental Press|Medici press]] published many Christian prayer and scholarly Arabic texts in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xu2y8w_o2sQC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=Robert+Granjon+designed+Arabic+typefaces&source=bl&ots=yaY_spZf0n&sig=ACfU3U0Hql1-4FJkIlaLNjavA6qNgWECpA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDrYu41rPhAhVuThUIHRi4B3w4ChDoATAGegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=Robert%20Granjon%20designed%20Arabic%20typefaces&f=false|title=Design and Structure of Arabic Script|last=Naghashian|first=Naghi|date=2013-01-21|publisher=epubli|isbn=9783844245059|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[Maronite]] monks at the Maar Quzhayy Monastery in [[Mount Lebanon]] published the first Arabic books to use movable type in the Middle East.

The [[Greek Orthodox]] monk [[Abd Allah Zakhir]] set up an [[Arabic]] [[printing press]] using [[movable type]] at the monastery of Saint John at the town of [[Dhour El Shuwayr]] in Mount Lebanon, the first homemade press in Lebanon using Arabic script. He personally cut the type molds and did the founding of the typeface. The first book came off his press in 1734; this press continued in use until 1899.<ref>\n[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm Arabic and the Art of Printing – A Special Section] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229133008/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198102/arabic.and.the.art.of.printing-a.special.section.htm |date=29 December 2006 }}, by Paul Lunde\n</ref>\n\n== Computers ==\nThe Arabic alphabet can be encoded using several [[character set]]s, including [[ISO-8859-6]], [[Windows-1256]] and [[Unicode]] (see links in Infobox above), latter thanks to the \"Arabic segment\", entries U+0600 to U+06FF. However, none of the sets indicates the form that each character should take in context. It is left to the [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering engine]] to select the proper [[glyph]] to display for each character.\n\nEach letter has a position-independent encoding in [[Unicode]], and the rendering software can infer the correct glyph form (initial, medial, final or isolated) from its joining context. That is the current recommendation. However, for compatibility with previous standards, the initial, medial, final and isolated forms can also be encoded separately.\n\n===Unicode===\n{{Main|Arabic characters in Unicode}}\nAs of [[Unicode]] 12.0, the [[Arabic script]] is contained in the following [[Unicode block|blocks]]:<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Scripts.txt | work=Unicode Character Database | title=UAX #24: Script data file | publisher=The Unicode Consortium}}</ref>\n* [[Arabic (Unicode block)|Arabic]] (0600–06FF, 255 characters)\n* [[Arabic Supplement]] (0750–077F, 48 characters)\n* [[Arabic Extended-A]] (08A0–08FF, 74 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] (FB50–FDFF, 611 characters)\n* [[Arabic Presentation Forms-B]] (FE70–FEFF, 141 characters)\n* [[Rumi Numeral Symbols]] (10E60–10E7F, 31 characters)\n* [[Indic Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Indic Siyaq Numbers]] (1EC70–1ECBF, 68 characters)\n* [[Ottoman Siyaq Numbers (Unicode block)|Ottoman Siyaq Numbers]] (1ED00–1ED4F, 61 characters)\n* [[Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols]] (1EE00—1EEFF, 143 characters)\n\nThe basic Arabic range encodes the standard letters and diacritics but does not encode contextual forms (U+0621-U+0652 being directly based on [[ISO 8859-6]]). It also includes the most common diacritics and [[Arabic-Indic digits]]. U+06D6 to U+06ED encode Qur'anic annotation signs such as \"end of ''[[ayah]]''\" ۝ۖ and \"start of ''[[Rub El Hizb|rub el hizb]]''\" ۞. The Arabic supplement range encodes letter variants mostly used for writing African (non-Arabic) languages. The Arabic Extended-A range encodes additional Qur'anic annotations and letter variants used for various non-Arabic languages.\n\nThe Arabic Presentation Forms-A range encodes contextual forms and ligatures of letter variants needed for Persian, Urdu, Sindhi and Central Asian languages. The Arabic Presentation Forms-B range encodes spacing forms of Arabic diacritics, and more contextual letter forms. The Arabic Mathematical Alphabetical Symbols block encodes characters used in Arabic mathematical expressions.\n\nSee also the notes of the section on [[#Modified letters|modified letters]].\n\n===Keyboards===\n{{see also|Keyboard layout|Arabic keyboard}}\n[[File:KB Arabic MAC.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic Mac keyboard layout]]\n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|450px|Arabic PC keyboard layout]]\n[[File:Intellark4qwerty.png|thumb|450px|[[Intellark]] imposed on a QWERTY keyboard layout.]]\n\nKeyboards designed for different nations have different layouts so proficiency in one style of keyboard, such as Iraq's, does not transfer to proficiency in another, such as Saudi Arabia's. Differences can include the location of non-alphabetic characters.\n\nAll Arabic keyboards allow typing Roman characters, e.g., for the URL in a [[web browser]]. Thus, each Arabic keyboard has both Arabic and Roman characters marked on the keys. Usually the Roman characters of an Arabic keyboard conform to the [[QWERTY]] layout, but in [[North Africa]], where [[French language|French]] is the most common language typed using the Roman characters, the Arabic keyboards are [[AZERTY]].\n\nTo encode a particular written form of a character, there are extra code points provided in Unicode which can be used to express the exact written form desired. The range ''Arabic presentation forms A'' (U+FB50 to U+FDFF) contain ligatures while the range ''Arabic presentation forms B'' (U+FE70 to U+FEFF) contains the positional variants. These effects are better achieved in Unicode by using the ''[[zero-width joiner]]'' and ''[[zero-width non-joiner|non-joiner]]'', as these presentation forms are deprecated in Unicode, and should generally only be used within the internals of text-rendering software, when using Unicode as an intermediate form for conversion between character encodings, or for backwards compatibility with implementations that rely on the hard-coding of glyph forms.\n\nFinally, the Unicode encoding of Arabic is in ''logical order'', that is, the characters are entered, and stored in computer memory, in the order that they are written and pronounced without worrying about the direction in which they will be displayed on paper or on the screen. Again, it is left to the rendering engine to present the characters in the correct direction, using Unicode's [[bi-directional text]] features. In this regard, if the Arabic words on this page are written left to right, it is an indication that the Unicode rendering engine used to display them is out of date.<ref>For more information about encoding Arabic, consult the Unicode manual available at [https://www.unicode.org/ The Unicode website]</ref><ref>See also [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf Multilingual Computing with Arabic and Arabic Transliteration: Arabicizing Windows Applications to Read and Write Arabic & Solutions for the Transliteration Quagmire Faced by Arabic-Script Languages] and [https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/multilingual_computing_arabic.ppt A PowerPoint Tutorial (with screen shots and an English voice-over) on how to add Arabic to the Windows Operating System]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911024303/https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/su/mideast/Multilingual_Computing_with_Arabic_and_Arabic_Transliteration.pdf |date=11 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThere are competing online tools, e.g. [http://www.yamli.com/editor/ Yamli editor], which allow entry of Arabic letters without having Arabic support installed on a PC, and without knowledge of the layout of the Arabic keyboard.<ref>[http://www.yamli.com/press/ Yamli in the News]</ref>\n\n===Handwriting recognition===\nThe first software program of its kind in the world that identifies Arabic handwriting in real time was developed by researchers at [[Ben-Gurion University]] (BGU).\n\nThe prototype enables the user to write Arabic words by hand on an electronic screen, which then analyzes the text and translates it into printed Arabic letters in a thousandth of a second. The error rate is less than three percent, according to Dr. Jihad El-Sana, from BGU's department of computer sciences, who developed the system along with master's degree student Fadi Biadsy.<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/technology/arabic-handwriting-gets-computerized-thanks-to-israeli-innovation/ Israel 21c]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Arabic alphabet}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{Portal-inline|size=tiny|Arabic alphabet}}\n* [[Abjad numerals]]\n* [[Ancient South Arabian script]]\n* [[Algerian braille]]\n* [[Arabic braille]]\n* [[Arabic calligraphy]]\n* [[Arabic Chat Alphabet]]\n* [[Arabic diacritics]]\n* [[Arabic letter frequency]]\n* [[Arabic Mathematical Alphabetic Symbols]]\n* [[Arabic numerals]]\n* [[Arabic script]] – about other languages written in Arabic script\n* [[Arabic Unicode]]\n* [[ArabTeX]] – provides Arabic support for [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]]\n* [[Kufic]]\n* [[Modern Arabic mathematical notation]]\n* [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]]\n* [[Rasm]]\n* [[Romanization of Arabic]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

      "text": "The term '''Ajami''' ({{lang-ar|عجمي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿajamī }}''), or '''Ajamiyya''' ({{lang-ar|عجمية}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿajamiyyah}}),'' which comes from the Arabic root for ''foreign'' or ''stranger'', has been applied to [[Arabic script|Arabic alphabets]] used for writing [[African languages]], especially those of [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], although many other African languages were written using the script, among them [[Yoruba language|Yoruba, the Fulani/Pulaar of Fulfulde]]. It is considered an Arabic-derived African writing system. Since African languages involve phonetic sounds and systems different from the [[Arabic language]], there have often been adaptations of the Arabic script to transcribe them, a process similar to what has been done with the Arabic script in non-Arab countries of the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]] and with the [[Latin script]] in Africa or with the Latin-based [[Vietnamese alphabet]].\n\nThe West African [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an example of a language written using Ajami, especially during the pre-colonial period when Qur'anic schools taught Muslim children Arabic, and by extension, Ajami. When Western colonizers adopted [[Boko alphabet|a Latin orthography for Hausa]], Ajami went into decline and now is employed less frequently than the Latin standard orthography. However, Hausa Ajami is still in widespread use, especially in Islamic circles.\nIts use is often in a situation of [[digraphia]], with Ajami used for specific purposes, such as for local herbal preparations in the [[Dyula language|Jula]] language.<ref>Donaldson, Coleman. 2013. Jula Ajami in Burkina Faso: A grassroots literacy in the former Kong empire. ''Working Papers in Educational Linguistics'' 28.2: 19-36.</ref>\n\n==Hausa Ajami Script==\n\nThere is no standard system of using Ajami, and different writers may use letters with different values. Short vowels are written regularly with the help of vowel marks (which are seldom used in Arabic texts other than the Quran). Many medieval Hausa manuscripts, similar to the [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] written in the Ajami script, have been discovered recently and some of them even describe [[constellation]]s and [[Islamic calendars|calendar]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201105/from.africa.in.ajami.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141130201717/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201105/from.africa.in.ajami.htm |archive-date=2014-11-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn the following table, some vowels are shown with the Arabic letter for '''t''' as an example.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:120%\"\n|-\n!

The writers from the North of Albania used Latin letters under the influence of the Catholic Church, those from the South of Albania under the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others used Arabic letters under the influence of Islam. There were also attempts for an original Albanian alphabet in the period of 1750–1850. The current alphabet in use among Albanians is one of the two variants approved in the [[Congress of Monastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Monastir ([[Bitola]], [[Republic of North Macedonia|North Macedonia]]).\n\n===Alphabet used in early literature===\nThe first certain document in Albanian is the \"[[Formula e pagëzimit]]\" (1462) (baptismal formula), issued by [[Pal Engjëlli]] (1417–1470); it was written in Latin characters.<ref name=\"Newmark\">{{cite book |title=Standard Albanian: a reference grammar for students |last=Newmark |first=Leonard |authorlink= |author2=Philip Hubbard|author3=Peter R.

It is assumed that this is the alphabet used later for the \"Gospel of Elbasan\". Anastasios calls Kosmas the \"[[Cadmus]] of Albania\".<ref>[https://books.google.gr/books?id=AQJj5_pYxtIC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82+%CE%BC%CE%B9%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%AE%CE%BB&source=bl&ots=gvLHRJ80D6&sig=ivD-VtZg6r9U_Qc-8e0gMijiwf8&hl=el&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8lPOwmpnQAhVGbRQKHcygBsQQ6AEIVDAN#v=onepage&q&f=false Minaoglou Charalampos, \"Anastasios Michael and the Speech about Hellenism\", Athens, 2013, p. 37 and note 90] In Greek language.</ref>\n\n===National awakening 19th-century endeavours===\nIn 1857 [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], an Albanian scholar and translator, drafted in [[Istanbul]], [[Ottoman Empire]], a ''Memorandum for the Albanian language''. He then went to [[Malta]], where he stayed until 1860 in a [[Protestant]] [[seminary]], finishing the translation of ''[[The New Testament]]'' in the [[Tosk]] and [[Gheg]] dialects. He was helped by Nikolla Serreqi from [[Shkodër]] with the [[Gheg]] version of the New Testament. Nikolla Serreqi was also the propulsor for the use of the Latin script for the translation of the New Testament, which had already been used by the early writers of the Albanian literature; Kristoforidhi enthusiastically embraced the idea of a Latin alphabet.<ref>Lloshi pp.14-15</ref>\n\nIn November 1869, a Commission for the Alphabet of the Albanian Language was gathered in Istanbul. One of its members was [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]] and the main purpose of the commission was the creation of a unique alphabet for all the Albanians. In January 1870 the commission ended its work of the standardization of the alphabet, which was mainly in Latin letters. A plan on the creation of textbooks and spread of Albanian schools was drafted. However this plan was not realized, because the Ottoman government wouldn't finance the expenses for the establishment of such schools.<ref>Lloshi p.18</ref>\n\nAlthough this commission had gathered and delivered an alphabet in 1870, the writers from the North still used the Latin-based alphabet, whereas in southern Albania writers used mostly the Greek letters. In southern Albania, the main activity of Albanian writers consisted in translating Greek Orthodox religious texts, and not in forming any kind of literature which could form a strong tradition for the use of Greek letters. As the albanologist Robert Elsie has written:<ref>Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, Birmingham, 15 (1991), p. 20-34.</ref>\n\n{{Quotation|The predominance of Greek as the language of Christian education and culture in southern Albania and the often hostile attitude of the Orthodox church to the spread of writing in Albanian made it impossible for an Albanian literature in Greek script to evolve. The Orthodox church, as the main vehicle of culture in the southern Balkans, while intent on spreading Christian education and values, was never convinced of the utility of writing in the vernacular as a means of converting the masses, as the Catholic church in northern Albania had been, to a certain extent, during the Counter-Reformation. Nor, with the exception of the ephemeral printing press in Voskopoja, did the southern Albanians ever have at their disposal publishing facilities like those available to the clerics and scholars of Catholic Albania in Venice and Dalmatia. As such, the Orthodox tradition in Albanian writing, a strong cultural heritage of scholarship and erudition, though one limited primarily to translations of religious texts and to the compilation of dictionaries, was to remain a flower which never really blossomed.}}\n\nThe turning point was the aftermath of the [[League of Prizren]] (1878) events when in 1879 [[Sami Frashëri]] and [[Naim Frashëri]] formed the [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings]]. Sami Frashëri, [[Koto Hoxhi]], [[Pashko Vasa]] and [[Jani Vreto]] created an alphabet.<ref name=book>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IJ2s9sQ9bGkC&pg=PA290&lpg=PA290&dq=koto+hoxhi&source=bl&ots=YIKMQffSFK&sig=7ALCDYVOY2NbBdfDwChP2UWbD6w&hl=en&ei=EBS7S7vKCIS80gTEzOj9Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=koto%20hoxhi&f=false The Albanians: an ethnic history from prehistoric times to the present], Edwin E. Jacques, p.290, 1995, accessed April 2010</ref> This was based on the principle of \"one sound one letter\" (although the revision of 1908 replaced the letter ''ρ'' by the ''rr'' digraph to avoid confusion with ''p''). This was called the \"Istanbul alphabet\" (also \"Frashëri alphabet\"). In 1905 this alphabet was in widespread use in all Albanian territory, North and South, including Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox areas.\n\nOne year earlier, in 1904 had been published the Albanian dictionary ({{lang-sq|Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe}}) of [[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], after the author's death. The dictionary had been drafted 25 years before its publication and was written in the Greek alphabet.<ref>Lloshi p. 9.</ref>\n\nThe so-called [[Bashkimi alphabet|''Bashkimi'' alphabet]] was designed by the [[Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language]] for being written on a French typewriter and includes no diacritics other than ''[[é]]'' (compared to ten graphemes of the Istanbul alphabet which were either non-Latin or had diacritics).\n\n===Congress of Manastir===\n{{Main article|Congress of Manastir}}\nIn 1908, the [[Congress of Manastir]] was held by Albanian intellectuals in [[Bitola]], [[Ottoman Empire]], modern-day [[Republic of North Macedonia]]. The Congress was hosted by the ''Bashkimi'' (\"unity\") club, and prominent delegates included [[Gjergj Fishta]], [[Ndre Mjeda]], [[Mit'hat Frashëri]], [[Sotir Peçi]], [[Shahin Kolonja]], and [[Gjergj D. Qiriazi]]. There was much debate and the contending alphabets were ''Istanbul'', ''Bashkimi'' and ''Agimi''. However, the Congress was unable to make a clear decision and opted for a compromise solution of using both the widely used ''Istanbul'', with minor changes, and a modified version of the ''Bashkimi'' alphabet. Usage of the alphabet of Istanbul declined rapidly and it was essentially extinct over the following decades.\n \nDuring 1909 and 1910 there were movements by [[Young Turks]] supporters to adopt an Arabic alphabet, as they considered the Latin script to be un-Islamic. In [[Korçë]] and [[Gjirokastër]], demonstrations took place favoring the Latin script, and in [[Elbasan]], Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the [[Young Turks]] dropped their opposition to the Latin script; finally, the Latin ''Bashkimi'' alphabet was adopted, and is still in use today.\n\nThe modifications to the Bashkimi alphabet were made to include characters used in the Istanbul and Agimi alphabets. ''Ç'' was chosen over ''ch'' since ''c with cedilla'' could be found on every typewriter, given its use in French. Other changes were more esthetic and as a way to combine the three scripts.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|Alphabetical order: || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23 || 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30 || 31 || 32 || 33 || 34 || 35 || 36\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|I.P.A.: || [a&nbsp;ɑ&nbsp;ɒ] || [b] || [ts] || [tʃ] || [d] || [ð] || [e&nbsp;ɛ] || [ə] || [f] || [g] || [ɟ] || [h&nbsp;ħ] || [i] || [j] || [k&nbsp;q] || [l] || [ɫ] || [m] || [n] || [ɲ] || [o&nbsp;ɔ] || [p] || [tɕ] || [ɾ] || [r] || [s] || [ʃ] || [t] || [θ] || [u] || [v] || [dz] || [dʒ] || [y] || [z] || [ʒ]\n|-\n|align=\"right\"|Bashkimi alphabet: || [[a|A a]] || [[b|B b]] || [[ts (digraph)|Ts ts]] || [[ch (digraph)|Ch ch]] || [[d|D d]] || [[Dh (digraph)|Dh dh]] || [[é|É é]] || [[e|E e]]|| [[f|F f]] || [[g|G g]] || [[gh (digraph)|Gh gh]] || [[h|H h]] || [[i|I i]] || [[j|J j]] || [[k|K k]] || [[l|L l]] || [[ll|Ll ll]] || [[m|M m]] || [[n|N n]] || [[gn (digraph)|Gn gn]] || [[o|O o]] || [[p|P p]] || [[c|C c]] || [[r|R r]] || [[Rr (digraph)|Rr rr]] || [[s|S s]] || [[Sh (digraph)|Sh sh]] || [[t|T t]] || [[Th (digraph)|Th th]] || [[u|U u]] || [[v|V v]] || [[z|Z z]] || [[Zh (digraph)|Zh zh]] || [[y|Y y]] || [[x|X x]] || [[Xh (digraph)|Xh xh]] \n|- \n|align=\"right\"|Istanbul alphabet: || [[a|A a]] || [[b|B b]] || [[c|C c]] || [[ç|Ç ç]] || [[d|D d]] || [[δ|Б δ]] || [[e|E ε]] || [[ε|♇ e]] || [[f|F f]] || [[g|G g]] || [[γ|Γ γ]] || [[h|H h]] || [[i|I i]] || [[j|J j]] || [[k|K k]] || [[l|L l]] || [[λ|Λ λ]] || [[m|M m]] || [[n|N n]] || [[ŋ|И ŋ]] || [[o|O o]] || [[p|Π p]] || [[q|Q q]] || [[r|R r]] ||[[ρ|Ρ ρ]] || [[s|S s]] || [[Sigma|Ϲ σ]] || [[t|T t]] || [[θ|Θ θ]] || [[u|U u]] || [[v|V v]] || [[x|X x]] || X̦ x̦ || [[y|Y y]] || [[z|Z z]] || Z̧ z̧\n|-\n|align=\"right\"| Manastir alphabet (modified Bashkimi, current alphabet): || [[a|A a]] || [[b|B b]] || [[c|C c]] || [[ç|Ç ç]] || [[d|D d]] || [[Dh (digraph)|Dh dh]] || [[e|E e]] || [[ë|Ë ë]] || [[f|F f]] || [[g|G g]] || [[Gj (digraph)|Gj gj]] || [[h|H h]] || [[i|I i]] || [[j|J j]] || [[k|K k]] || [[l|L l]] || [[ll|Ll ll]] || [[m|M m]] || [[n|N n]] || [[Nj (digraph)|Nj nj]] || [[o|O o]] || [[p|P p]] || [[q|Q q]] || [[r|R r]] || [[Rr (digraph)|Rr rr]] || [[s|S s]] || [[Sh (digraph)|Sh sh]] || [[t|T t]] || [[Th (digraph)|Th th]] || [[u|U u]] || [[v|V v]] || [[x|X x]] || [[Xh (digraph)|Xh xh]] || [[y|Y y]] || [[z|Z z]] || [[Zh (digraph)|Zh zh]]\n|- \n|}\n\nA [[Second Congress of Manastir|second congress at Monastir]] (Bitola) was held in April 1910, which confirmed the decision taken in the first congress of Monastir. After [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|Albanian independence]] in 1912, there were two alphabets in use. Following the events of the Balkan wars and World War I, the Bashkimi variant dominated. The Bashkimi alphabet is at the origin of the official alphabet of the Albanian language in use today.\n\n==Other alphabets used for written Albanian==\nThe modern Latin-based Albanian alphabet is the result of long evolution. Before the creation of the unified alphabet, Albanian was written in several different alphabets, with several sub-variants:\n\n===Derived alphabets===\n\n'''Latin-derived alphabet'''\n* The [[Latin script]], using various conventions:\n** The oldest surviving document with Albanian text is from the 15th century and written in the Latin script. Early Albanian writers such as [[Gjon Buzuku]], [[Pjetër Bogdani]], [[Pjetër Budi]], and [[Frang Bardhi]] also used a Latin-based script, adding Greek characters to represent extra sounds.\n** A ''Catholic alphabet'' used by [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] ([[Italy|Italo]]-[[Albanians]]).\n** The ''Istanbul'' alphabet, created by [[Sami Frashëri]], combining Latin and Greek. This became widely used as it was also adopted by the [[Istanbul]] [[Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings|Society for the Printing of Albanian Writings]], which in 1879 printed ''Alfabetare'', the first Albanian [[abecedarium]].\n** ''Bashkimi'', developed by the Albanian [[Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language|literary society Bashkimi (Unity)]] in [[Shkodër]] with the help of [[Catholic]] clergy and [[Franciscan]]s aiming at more simplicity than its forerunners. It used digraphs for unique sounds of the Albanian language. It resembles the current alphabet with the differences being the use of ''ch'' for ''ç'', ''c'' for ''q'', ''ts'' for ''c'', ''é'' for ''e'', ''e'' for ''ë'', ''gh'' for ''gj'', ''gn'' for ''nj'', and ''z/zh'' have swapped places with ''x/xh''.\n** ''Agimi'', developed by the [[Agimi (society)|Agimi (\"Dawn\") Literary Society]] in 1901, and spearheaded by [[Ndre Mjeda]]. It made use of diacritics instead of digraphs used by Bashkimi.\n\n'''Greek-derived alphabet'''\n* The [[Greek alphabet]]; used to write [[Tosk]] starting in about 1500 (Elsie, 1991). The printing press at [[Voskopojë]] published several Albanian texts in Greek script during the 18th century (Macrakis, 1996).\n\n'''[[Elifba|Ottoman-derived alphabet]]'''\n* The [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]], favored by [[Muslims]]. Last version called ''[[Elifba|Elifbaja shqip]]'' was published by scholar and writer [[Rexhep Voka]], a prominent figure of the [[Albanian National Awakening]].\n\n'''Arabic-derived alphabet'''\n* The [[Arabic alphabet]]; a primer was published in 1861 in [[Constantinople]] by [[Daut Boriçi|Mullah Daut Boriçi]].<ref name=\"Norris\">{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&pg=PA76&dq=Daut+Bori%C3%A7i&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIwtachLbDyAIVhG4-Ch10UwDg#v=onepage&q=Daut%20Bori%C3%A7i&f=false| title=Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World|author=H.

Widely thought to be the work of [[Gregory of Durrës]]. According to Robert Elsie, \"The alphabet of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is quite well suited to the Albanian language. Indeed, on the whole, one might regard it as better suited than the present-day Albanian alphabet, based on a Latin model. The Elbasan alphabet utilizes one character per phoneme, with the exception of ''n'', for which there are two characters, and ''g'', for which there are three characters (two of which being restricted to specific Greek loanwords). The distinction between Albanian ''r'' and ''rr'' and between ''l'' and ''ll'' is created by a dot over the character. A dot over a ''d'' creates an ''nd''. A spiritus lenis plus acute above the line, as in Greek, seems to be utilized on a sporadic basis to indicate word or phrase stress. On the whole, the writing system utilized in the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is clear, relatively precise, and appears to be well thought out by its inventor.\"<ref name=\"Elise\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf|title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript (Anonimi i Elbasanit), 1761, and the struggle for an original Albanian alphabet|access-date=2016-07-13|first1=Robert|last1=Elise|format=pdf|publisher=Robert Elise}}</ref>\n* '''Undeciphered Script''' from the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript. On the front page of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript itself is a drawing and about a dozen words, perhaps personal names, written in a script which differs completely from that of the rest of the manuscript. This writing system has as yet to be deciphered, although Elbasan scholar Dhimitër Shuteriqi (b. 1915) has made an attempt to read it.<ref name=\"Elise\"/>\n* The '''[[Todhri script]]''' (18th century), attributed to Todhri Haxhifilipi. The Todhri alphabet was discovered by Johann Georg von Hahn (1811–1869), Austrian consul in Janina and the father of Albanian Studies. Hahn published what he regarded as 'the original' Albanian alphabet in his monumental Albanesische Studien (Jena 1854) and saw in it a derivative of ancient [[Phoenician script]]. The study of this alphabet was subsequently taken up by Leopold Geitler (1847–1885) who regarded Todhri script as derived primarily from Roman cursive, and by the Slovenian scholar Rajko Nahtigal(1877–1958). The Todhri alphabet is a complex writing system of fifty-two characters which was used sporadically for written communication in and around Elbasan from the late eighteenth century on. It does not conform adequately to the Albanian language, certainly not as well as the alphabet of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript, to which it shows no relation<ref name=\"Elise\"/>\n* Another original script is found in '''Codex of Berat''' (not to be confused with [[Codex Beratinus|Codex Beratinus I]] and [[Codex Beratinus II|II]]). This 154-page manuscript, now preserved in the National Library of Tiranë, is in actual fact a simple paper manuscript and must not be envisaged as an illuminated parchment 'codex' in the Western tradition. It seems to have been the work of at least two hands and to have been written between the years 1764 and 1798. The manuscript is commonly attributed to one [[Constantine of Berat]] (c. 1745 – c. 1825), known in Albanian as Kostandin Berati or Kostë Berati, who is thought to have been an Orthodox monk and writer from Berat. Constantine of Berat is reported to have possessed the manuscript from 1764 to 1822, although there is no indication that he was its author. The Codex of Berat contains various and sundry texts in Greek and Albanian: biblical and Orthodox liturgical texts in Albanian written in the Greek alphabet, all of them no doubt translated from Greek or strongly influenced by Greek models; a forty-four-line Albanian poem with the corresponding Greek text known as Zonja Shën Mëri përpara kryqësë (The Virgin Mary before the cross); two Greek-Albanian glossaries comprising a total of 1,710 entries; various religious notes; and a chronicle of events between 1764 and 1789 written in Greek. \n*On page 104 of the codex, we find two lines of Albanian written in an '''original alphabet of 37 letters''', influenced, as it would seem, by [[Glagolitic script]]. On page 106, the author also gives an overview of the writing system he created. It, too, is not well devised and does not seem to occur anywhere else.<ref name=\"Elise\"/>\n* The '''[[Veso Bey alphabet]]''', another original alphabet by Veso bey, who is one of the most prominent chiefs of Gjirokastër, from the family of Alizot Pasha. Veso Bey learned it in his youth from an Albanian hodja as a secret script which his family inherited, and used it himself for correspondence with his relatives.<ref name=\"Elise\"/><ref>[https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2009/09328-old-albanian.pdf]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chikyukotobamura.org/muse/wr_europa_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215092857/http://www.chikyukotobamura.org/muse/wr_europa_1.html |archivedate=2013-12-15 |df= }}</ref>\n* '''[[Vellara script]]''' was used in southern Albania, named after the Greek doctor, lyricist and writer [[Ioannis Vilaras]] (Alb: Jan Vellara). The son of a doctor, Vilaras studied medicine in Padua in 1789 and later lived in Venice. In 1801, he became a physician to Veli, son of the infamous [[Ali Pasha Tepelena]] (1741–1822). Vilaras is remembered primarily as a modern Greek poet and does not seem to have been a native Albanian speaker at all. He is the author of eighty-six pages of bilingual grammatical notes, dated 1801, which were designed no doubt to teach other Greek-speakers Albanian. The Albanian in question is a Tosk dialect written in an original alphabet of thirty letters based on Latin and to a lesser extent on Greek. The manuscript of the work was donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (supplément grec 251, f. 138-187) in 1819 by François Pouqueville (1770–1839), French consul in Janina during the reign of Ali Pasha Tepelena . Pouqueville was aware of the value of the work, noting: \"Je possède un manuscrit, une grammaire grecque vulgaire et schype qui pourrait être utile aux philologues\", but chose not to publish it in his travel narratives. Appendixed to the grammatical notes is also a letter dated 30 October 1801, written in Albanian in Vellara's handwriting from the village of [[Vokopolë]], south of Berat, where the physician had been obliged to follow Veli during the latter's military campaign against Ibrahim of Berat. Part of the manuscript is also a list of proverbs, both in modern Greek and Albanian.<ref name=\"Shuteriqi1976\">{{citation| author=Dhimiter Shuteriqi| page=151|location = Tirana| year=1976| oclc=252881121 | publisher= Academy of Sciences of PR of Albania| title=Shkrimet Shqipe ne Vitet 1332-1850}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VithkuqiScript.png|thumb|250px|The letters of the Vithkuqi alphabet matched to their modern Albanian equivalents.]]\n* The '''[[Vithkuqi alphabet]]''' (1844). From 1824 to 1844, [[Naum Veqilharxhi]] developed and promoted a 33-letter alphabet which he had printed in an eight-page Albanian spelling book in 1844. This little spelling book was distributed throughout southern Albania, from Korçë to Berat, and was received, as it seems, with a good deal of enthusiasm. In the following year, 1845, the booklet was augmented to forty-eight pages in a now equally rare second edition entitled Faré i ri abétor shqip per djélm nismetore (A very new Albanian spelling book for elementary schoolboys). However, the resonance of this original alphabet, which reminds one at first glance of a type of cursive Armenian, was in fact limited, due in part to the author's premature death one year later and in part no doubt to financial and technical considerations. In the mid-nineteenth century, when publishing was making great strides even in the Balkans, a script requiring a new font for printing would have resulted in prohibitive costs for any prospective publisher. As such, although reasonably phonetic and confessionally neutral, the Veqilharxhi alphabet never took hold.<ref>{{cite book|last=Straehle|first=Carolin|title=International journal of the sociology of language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fvhhAAAAMAAJ&q=Naum+Veqilharxhi&dq=Naum+Veqilharxhi|year=1974|publisher=Mouton|page=5}}</ref>\n\n===Older versions of the alphabet in Latin characters===\n\nBefore the standardisation of the Albanian alphabet, there were several ways of writing the sounds peculiar to Albanian, namely ⟨c⟩, ⟨ç⟩, ⟨dh⟩, ⟨ë⟩, ⟨gj⟩, ⟨ll⟩, ⟨nj⟩, ⟨q⟩, ⟨rr⟩, ⟨sh⟩, ⟨th⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨xh⟩, ⟨y⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨zh⟩.\n\n;⟨c⟩, ⟨ç⟩, ⟨k⟩, and ⟨q⟩\nThe earliest Albanian sources were written by people educated in Italy, as a consequence, the value of the letters were similar to those of the Italian alphabet. The present-day '''c''' was written with a ⟨z⟩, and the present-day '''ç''' was written as ⟨c⟩ as late as 1895. Conversely, the present-day '''k''' was written as ⟨c⟩ until 1868. '''c''' was also written as ⟨ts⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨tz⟩ (Rada 1866) and ⟨zz⟩. It was first written as ⟨c⟩ in 1879 by Frashëri but also in 1908 by Pekmezi. '''ç''' was also written as ⟨tz⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ts̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨tš⟩, ⟨ci⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨tç⟩ (Dozon 1878), ⟨č⟩ (by Agimi) and ⟨ch⟩ (by Bashkimi). '''ç''' itself was first used by Frasheri (1879).\n\nThe present-day '''q''' was variously written as ⟨ch⟩, ⟨chi⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨ky⟩, ⟨kj⟩, and as a ⟨k⟩ with various diacritics (dot, overline, apostrophe). ⟨q⟩ was first used in Frashëri's Stamboll mix-alphabet in 1879 and also in the ''Grammaire albanaise'' of 1887.\n\n;⟨dh⟩ and ⟨th⟩\nThe present-day '''dh''' was originally written with a character similar to the Greek xi (ξ). This was doubled (ξξ) to write 'th'. These characters were used as late as 1895. Leake first used ⟨dh⟩ and ⟨th⟩ in 1814. '''dh''' was also written using the Greek letter delta (δ), while Alimi used ⟨đ⟩ and Frasheri used a ⟨d⟩ with a hook on the top stem of the letter.\n\n;⟨ë⟩\nThis letter was not usually differentiated from ⟨e⟩, but when it was, it was usually done by means of diacritics: ⟨ė⟩ (Bogdani 1685, da Lecce 1716 and Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨e̊⟩ (Lepsius 1863), ⟨ẹ̄⟩ (Miklosich 1870) or by new letters ⟨ö⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨υ⟩ (Rada 1866), ⟨ε⟩ (Meyer 1891, note Frasheri used ⟨ε⟩ for ⟨e⟩, and ⟨e⟩ to write ⟨ë⟩; the revision of 1908 swapped these letters) and ⟨ə⟩ (Alimi). Rada first used ⟨ë⟩ in 1870.\n\n;⟨gj⟩ and ⟨g⟩\nThese two sounds were not usually differentiated. They were variously written as ⟨g⟩, ⟨gh⟩ and ⟨ghi⟩. When they were differentiated, '''g''' was written as ⟨g⟩ or (by Liguori 1867) as ⟨gh⟩, while '''gj''' was written as ⟨gi⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ḡ⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ǵ⟩ (first used by Lepsius 1863), ⟨gy⟩ (Dozon 1878) and a modified ⟨g⟩ (Frasheri). Hahn first used '''gj''' in 1954, but it was also used in the ''Grammaire albanaise'' (1887) and by Librandi (1897). Rada (1866) used ⟨g⟩, ⟨gh⟩, ⟨gc⟩, and ⟨gk⟩ for '''g''', and ⟨gki⟩ for ⟨gj⟩.\n\n;⟨h⟩\nThe older versions of the Albanian alphabet differentiated between two “h” sounds, one for {{IPA|[h]}} one for the [[Voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}}. The second sound was written as ⟨h⟩, ⟨kh⟩, ⟨ch⟩, and Greek khi ⟨χ⟩.\n\n;⟨ll⟩ and ⟨l⟩\nThree “l” sounds were distinguished in older Albanian alphabets, represented by [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] as {{IPA|/[[alveolar lateral approximant|l]] [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|ɫ]] [[palatal lateral approximant|ʎ]]/}}. '''l''' {{IPA|/l/}} was written as ⟨l⟩. '''ll''' {{IPA|/ɫ/}} was written as ⟨λ⟩, italic ⟨''l''⟩, ⟨lh⟩ and ⟨ł⟩. Blanchi (1635) first used '''ll'''. {{IPA|/ʎ/}} was written as ⟨l⟩, ⟨li⟩, ⟨l’⟩, ⟨lh⟩, ⟨gl⟩, ⟨ly⟩ and ⟨lj⟩.\n\n;⟨nj⟩\nThis sound was most commonly written as ⟨gn⟩ in Italian fashion. It was also written as italic ⟨''n''⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨n̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ń⟩ (first used by Lepsius 1863), ⟨ṅ⟩ (Miklosich 1870 and Meyer 1888). Hahn first used '''nj''' in 1854, but also the ''Grammaire albanaise'' in 1887.\n\n;⟨rr⟩\nBlanchi first used ⟨rr⟩ to represent this sound. However, also used were Greek rho (ρ) (Miklosich 1870), ⟨ṙ⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨rh⟩ (Dozon 1878 and ''Grammaire albanaise'' 1887), ⟨r̄⟩ (Meyer 1888 and 1891), ⟨r̀⟩ (Alimi) and ⟨p⟩ (Frasheri, who used a modified ⟨p⟩ for [p]).\n\n;⟨sh⟩ and ⟨s⟩\nThese two sounds were not consistently differentiated in the earliest versions of the Albanian alphabet. When they were differentiated, '''s''' was represented by ⟨s⟩ or ⟨ss⟩, while '''sh''' was represented by ⟨sc⟩, ⟨ſc⟩, ⟨s̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ç⟩ (Dozon 1878) and ⟨š⟩. '''sh''' was first used by Rada in 1866.\n\n;⟨x⟩\nFrasheri first used ⟨x⟩ to represent this sound. Formerly, it was written variously as ⟨ds⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨dz⟩, ⟨z⟩, and ⟨zh⟩.\n\n;⟨xh⟩\nThe ''Grammaire albanaise'' (1887) first used ⟨xh⟩. Formerly, it was written variously as ⟨gi⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨dš⟩, ⟨dž⟩, ⟨x⟩ and ⟨zh⟩.\n\n;⟨y⟩\nThis sound was written as ⟨y⟩ in 1828. Formerly it was written as ȣ (Cyrillic [[Uk (Cyrillic)|uk]]), italic ⟨''u''⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ü⟩, ⟨ṳ⟩, and ⟨ε⟩.\n\n;⟨z⟩\nLeake first used ⟨z⟩ to represent this sound in 1814. Formerly, it was written variously as a backward 3, Greek zeta (ζ), ⟨x⟩ (Bashkimi) and a symbol similar to ⟨p⟩ (Altsmar).\n\n;⟨zh⟩\nThis sound was variously written as an overlined ζ, ⟨sg⟩, ⟨ž⟩, ⟨j⟩, underdotted z, ⟨xh⟩ (Bashkimi), ⟨zc⟩. It was also written with a backward 3 in combination: 3gh and 3c.\n\n{{Anchor|Greek}}\n\n===Older versions of the alphabet in Greek characters===\n\n[[Arvanites]] in Greece used the altered Greek alphabet to write in Albanian.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171007170814/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/alphabet/alban-greek-alpha.jpg Albanian-Greek]</ref><ref>{{Citation |author= Carl Faulmann |authorlink= |title= Das Buch der Schrift enthaltend die Schriftzeichen und Alphabete aller Zeiten und aller Völker des Erdkreises|url=https://archive.org/stream/dasbuchderschri00faulgoog#page/n200/mode/2up |edition=2nd |volume=1 |year= 1880 |publisher=Druck und Verlag der kaiserlich-königlichen Hof- und Staatsdruckerei |location=Wien |language=German |isbn= |oclc= }}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=34|Albanian written in the Greek alphabet\n|-\n|Α||Β||B||Ϳ||Γ||Γ̇||Γ̇ϳ||Δ||D||Ε||Ε̱||Ζ||Θ||Ι||Κ||Κϳ||Λ||Λϳ||Μ||Ν||Ν̇||Νϳ||Ξ||Ο||Π||Ρ||Σ||Σ̇||Σ̈||Τ||Υ||Φ||Χ̇||Χ\n|-\n|α||β||b||ϳ||γ||γ̇||γ̇ϳ||δ||d||ε||ε̱||ζ||θ||ι||κ||κϳ||λ||λϳ||μ||ν||ν̇||νϳ||ξ||ο||π||ρ||σ||σ̇||σ̈||τ||υ||φ||χ̇||χ\n|-\n!colspan=34|Modern Albanian\n|-\n|a||v||b||j||g||g||gj||dh||d||e||ë||z||th||i||k||q||l||lj||m||n||nj||nj||ks||o||p||r||s||s||sh||t||y||f||h||h\n|}\n\n===Older versions of the alphabet in Cyrillic characters===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-align=\"center\"\n|align=\"right\"|Modern Latin: || [[a]] || [[b]] || [[c]] || [[ç]] || [[d]] || [[Dh (digraph)|dh]] || [[e]] || [[ë]] || [[f]] || [[g]] || [[Gj (digraph)|gj]] || [[h]] || [[i]] || [[j]] || [[k]] || [[l]] || [[ll]] || [[m]] || [[n]] || [[Nj (letter)|nj]] || [[Ng (digraph)|ng]] || [[o]] || [[p]] || [[q]] || [[r]] || [[Rr (digraph)|rr]] || [[s]] || [[Sh (digraph)|sh]] || [[t]] || [[Th (digraph)|th]] || [[u]] || [[v]] || [[x]] || [[Xh (digraph)|xh]] || [[y]] || [[z]] || [[Zh (digraph)|zh]] || je || ju || ja || sht\n|-align=\"center\"\n|align=\"right\"|[[Cyrillic]]: || [[а]] || [[б]] || [[ц]] || [[ч]] || [[д]] || [[δ]] || [[е]] || [[ъ]] || [[ф]] || [[г]] || гї, гј, [[ђ]] || [[х]] || [[ї]], [[и]] || [[ѣ]], [[ј]] || [[к]] || [[л]], [[љ]] || [[л]] || [[м]] || [[н]] || [[њ]] || нг || [[о]] || [[п]] || кї, [[ћ]] || [[р]] || рр || [[с]] || [[ш]] || [[т]] || [[ѳ]] || [[у]] || [[в]] || дс || [[џ]] || ју, [[ӱ]] || [[з]] || [[ж]] || ѣе, је || ѣу, ју || ѣа, ја || [[щ]], шт\n|-align=\"center\"\n|align=\"right\"|Alternate: || [[а]] || [[б]] || [[ц]] || [[ч]] || [[д]] || [[ҙ]] || [[е]] || [[ә]] || [[ф]] || [[г]] || [[ѓ]] || [[х]] || [[и]] || [[й]] || [[к]] || [[л]] || [[љ]] || [[м]] || [[н]] || [[њ]] || [[ң]] || [[о]] || [[п]] || [[ќ]] || [[р]] || [[р̌]] || [[с]] || [[ш]] || [[т]] || [[ҫ]] || [[у]] || [[в]] || [[ѕ]] || [[џ]] || [[ү]] || [[з]] || [[ж]] || [[є]] || [[ю]] || [[я]] || [[щ]]\n|}\n\nSample of Albanian language text, written in Cyrillic characters (central column).

University of Minnesota Press. Minneapolis, USA</ref> ''Aljamiado'' or ''Aljamía'' is \"a corruption of the Arabic word [[Ajam|''ʿajamiyah'']] (in this case it means foreign language) and, generally, the Arabic expression ''ʿajam'' and its derivative ''ʿajamiyah'' are applicable to peoples whose ancestry is not of Arabian origin\". In linguistic terms, the ''Aljamía'' is the use of the [[Arabic alphabet]] to transcribe a [[Romance language]]. It was used by some people in some areas of [[Al-Andalus]] as an everyday communication vehicle, {{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} while Arabic was reserved as the language of science, high culture, and religion.\n\nThe systematic writing of Romance-language texts in Arabic scripts appears to have begun in the fifteenth century, and the overwhelming majority of such texts that can be dated belong to the sixteenth century.<ref>L.P.

(Harvey 1987.)</ref>\n\nIn later times, [[Morisco]]s were banned from using Arabic as a religious language, and wrote in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] on Islamic subjects. Examples are the ''Coplas del alhichante de Puey Monzón'', narrating a ''[[Hajj]]'',<ref>Gerard Albert Wiegers, ''Islamic Literature in Spanish and Aljamiado'' 1994, p. 226.</ref> or the ''[[Poema de Yuçuf]]'' on the Biblical [[Joseph (dreamer)|Joseph]] (written in [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]).<ref>MENÉNDEZ PIDAL, Ramón, ''Poema de Yuçuf: Materiales para su estudio'', Granada, Universidad de Granada, (1952) p. 62-63</ref>\n\n==Usage by the Moriscos during the persecution of Muslims in Spain==\n[[File:Flicker - Aljamiado letters.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Aljamiado letters]]\n\nAljamiado played a very important role in preserving Islam and the Arabic language in the life of the Moriscos. After the fall of the last Muslim kingdom on the Iberian peninsula, the Moriscos (Andalusian Muslims in Granada and other parts of what was once [[Al-Andalus]]) were forced to convert to Christianity or leave the peninsula. They were forced to adopt Christian customs and traditions and to attend church services on Sundays. Nevertheless, some of the Moriscos [[Crypto-Islam|kept their Islamic belief and traditions secretly]] through the usage of Aljamiado.\n\nIn 1567, [[Philip II of Spain]] issued a royal decree in Spain, which forced Moriscos to abandon using Arabic on all occasions, formal and informal, speaking and writing. Using Arabic in any sense of the word would be regarded as a crime. They were given three years to learn the language of the Christian Spanish, after which they would have to get rid of all Arabic written material. Moriscos translated all prayers and the sayings of their prophet [[Mohammed]] into Aljamiado transcriptions of the Spanish language, while keeping all [[Qur'an]]ic verses in the original Arabic. Aljamiado scrolls were circulated amongst the Moriscos. Historians came to know about Aljamiado literature only in the early nineteenth century. Some of the Aljamiado scrolls are kept in the [[Spanish National Library]] in Madrid.\n\n==Other uses==\nThe word ''aljamiado'' is sometimes used for other non-Semitic language written in Arabic letters. For example, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Albanian language|Albanian]] texts written in Arabic script during the Ottoman period have been referred to as aljamiado. However, many linguists prefer to limit the term to Romance languages,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} instead using ''[[arebica]]'' to refer to the use of Arabic script for Slavic languages. The word ''Aljamiado'' is also used to refer to Greek written in the Arabic/Ottoman alphabet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mozarabic language]]\n* [[Kharja]]s\n* [[:Category:Arabic alphabets]]\n* [[Arabic Afrikaans]]\n* [[Karamanli Turkish]]\n* [[Jawi (script)]]\n* [[Ajami script]]\n* [[Arebica]]\n* [[Elifbaja shqip]]\n* [[Xiaoerjing]]\n* [[Judeo-Spanish]]\n\n==References and notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Los Siete Alhaicales y otras plegarias de mudéjares y moriscos'' by Xavier Casassas Canals published by Almuzara, Sevilla (Spain), 2007. {{es icon}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024142707/http://www.arabic-islamic.org/aljamiado/textos_aljamiados/a1p_153.html A bilingual Arabic-''aljamiado'' Qur'an from the fifteenth century]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050403224328/http://www.arabic-islamic.org/biblioteca/aljamiado/aljamiado.html Aljamiado (Texts and Studies) ]\n* [http://alhadith.stanford.edu Alhadith: Morisco Literature & Culture] A website devoted to the literature and language of the Moriscos; contains a multilingual bibliography, digital texts, and a catalogue of aljamiado-morisco manuscripts.\n\n{{Arabic alphabets}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:15th century in Al-Andalus]]\n[[Category:Arabic alphabets]]\n[[Category:Spanish language]]\n[[Category:Moriscos]]"

      "text": "'''Arabic Afrikaans''' (''Arabiese Afrikaans'', {{Script|Arab|اَرابيسي اَفريكانس}}) was a form of [[Afrikaans]] that was written in [[Arabic script]]. It began in the 1830s in the [[madrasa]] in [[Cape Town]]. Beside a 16th century manuscript in the [[German language]] written with Arabic script,<ref>compare the [[Lutheran hymn]] [[Vater unser im Himmelreich]] in the following picture.

The earliest, the \"Hidyat al-Islam\", is dated 1845, though its source manuscript no longer exists. The oldest surviving manuscript, which describes the basic Islamic learning, was written by the [[imam]] [[Abdul-Kahhar ibn Abdul-Malik]] in 1868. The most professional version was written in 1869 by [[Abu Bakr Effendi]], who came from [[Istanbul]] to the Cape in 1862.\n\n==Uiteensetting van die Godsdiens==\n\nOne of the best examples of this literature was ''Uiteensetting van die Godsdiens'' (\"Exposition of the Religion\"), a book laying out [[Islam]]ic traditions according to the [[Hanafi]] religious law. Written by [[Abu Bakr Effendi]], it was printed using Arabic script throughout, but contained transcriptions of Afrikaans.\n\nAccording to one of the three experts in this field, the German [[Hans Kähler]], about 20 people were responsible for the text, but the most important contributors to Arabic Afrikaans opinion were:\n*Abdul Kahhar ibn Hajji Abdul Malik (early 19th century)\n*Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Baha ud-Din (mid-19th century)\n*Ismail ibn Muhammad Hanif (mid-19th century)\n*Abd ur-Rahman ibn Muhammad Al-Iraqi (late 19th century), and\n*Abu Bakr Effendi (late 19th century).\n\nThis is a paragraph of the book ''Uiteensetting van die godsdiens'':\n*Transcription of the Arabic-alphabet text. The italics mark Arabic-language words:\n*:Iek bagent diesie ''kitab'' met Allah (''ta'ala'') sain naam. Allah (''ta'ala'') es ''rizq'' giefar ien ''dunya'' fer al wat liefandag ies. Allah (''ta'ala'') es beriengar ien die ''gannat'' ien dag ''ahirat'' fer al die miesie an djinns wat oewhap ''iman'' gadoet het. Al die dank an parais es rieg fer Allah (''ta'ala'') alien. Allah (''ta'ala'') het gagief fer oewhans Islam sain ''agama''. Islam sain ''agama'' oek waas gawies fantefoewhar Ibrahim sain ''agama''... An Allah (''ta'ala'') het gamaak die Qur'an ''rasulullah'' sain hadit fer seker ''dalil'' fer oewhans... An Allah (''ta'ala'') het galaat oewhans wiet die riegtie wieg fan die ''ilm''s an gahelp fer oewhans oewham ta lier ander miesie oewhap die riegtie manierie.\n*Translation into modern standard Afrikaans:\n*:Ek begin hierdie boek met Allah (hy is verhewe) se naam. Allah (h.i.v.) is onderhouer in die wêreld vir al wat lewendig is. Allah (h.i.v.) is bringer in die paradys in die laaste dag vir al die mense en djinns wat oop iman gedoen het (m.a.w. in die geloof gesterwe het). Al die dank en prys is reg vir Allah (h.i.v.) alleen. Allah het gegee vir ons Islam se godsdiens. Islam se godsdiens ook was gewees vantevore Abraham se godsdiens...En Allah (h.i.v.) het gemaak die Koran en die profeet se hadit vir seker bewys vir ons...En Allah (h.i.v.) het gelaat ons weet die regte weg van die godsdienswetenskappe en gehelp vir ons om te leer ander mense op die regte manier.\n\nThe Arabic-alphabet version uses an Arabic word in several places where modern Afrikaans uses a Germanic word, e.g. ''dunya'' دنيا for ''wêreld,'' meaning \"world\". The Arabic words are entirely unknown in Afrikaans.\n\nWithout the above ''Translation into modern standard Afrikaans'' (which is in itself not standard Afrikaans although much closer to it), it is nearly impossible for an Afrikaans-speaking person to understand the above ''Transcription of the Arabic-alphabet text''. Some words do however appear to resemble phonetic transliterations between Arabic script and the version of Afrikaans spoken by Cape Coloured people, mixed with Dutch.\n\n[[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|Islam arrived among the Malays during the early 15th century]] and these works were most likely teaching tools; a way for Muslim teachers to instruct Malay slaves in the Cape while not necessarily being able to speak Dutch very well or at all.\n\n==Qur'an==\n\n\nAn example that used Arabic vowels was a handwritten Arabic–Afrikaans bilingual [[Koran]] (perhaps written in the 1880s). In it, for example, [[Sura]]h [[Al-Mulk|67]] verse 1 says:<ref>Michael Cook, ''The Koran, A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|0-19-285344-9}}, p. 93</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n!

Full letters were eventually introduced for all vowels (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish Arabic]] script), making Arebica a true [[alphabet]], unlike its Perso-Arabic base.\n\nThe final version of Arebica was devised by [[Džemaludin Čaušević|Mehmed Džemaludin Čaušević]] at the end of the 19th century. His version is called ''Matufovica'', ''Matufovača'', or ''Mektebica''.\n\n==Contemporary use==\nThe first literary work to be published in Arebica for 64 years (since 1941) was a comic book \"Hadži Šefko i hadži Mefko\" in 2005 (authors Amir Al-Zubi and Meliha Čičak-Al-Zubi). The authors made slight modifications to Arebica.\n\nThe first book in Arebica with an ISBN was \"Epohe fonetske misli kod Arapa i arebica\" (\"The Age of Phonetic Thought of Arabs and

This language was enriched, promoted and developed in Kayalpattinam, It had a rich body of work in jurisprudence, [[sufism]], law, medicine, and [[sexology]], of which little has been preserved. It was used as a bridge language for Tamil Muslims to learn Arabic.<ref>\n  ''216 th year commemoration today: Remembering His Holiness Bukhary Thangal'' Sunday Observer – January 5, 2003.

Most of the ''[[fiqh]]'' books, particularly those of Imaam Shaafi and Imaam Abu Hanifa, have been found in Arwi. There was also a translation of the [[Bible]] into Arwi in 1926. Arwi contributed immensely{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} to the education and progression of Muslim women in [[South India]] and Sri Lanka. Arwi-educated women were active participants in the social fabric of society playing vital roles in education, medicine and even politics.\n\nLarge portions of Arwi works were lost in two periods of time: in the 16th century with the arrival of the [[Portuguese Empire#Portuguese enter the Indian Ocean (1497–1542)|Portuguese]] and in the 20th century with the arrival of the mainstream [[printing press]]. Using the Arabic script meant that Arwi could not jump to print easily.\n\nPresently, manuscripts are being eaten away by [[termites]] in homes and in private, public and institutional libraries. Efforts are underway to halt the decline and revive the language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\nArwi still has a place among the more traditional Indian Tamil Muslim and [[Sri Lankan Moor]] families.\n\n==Script==\nThe Arwi alphabet is the Arabic alphabet with thirteen additional letters, used to represent the Tamil vowels ''e'' and ''o'' and several Tamil consonants that could not be mapped to Arabic sounds.<ref name=\"tors\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arwi vowels arranged according to the [[Tamil script|Tamil order]] (right to left)\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|ஔ}} || {{transl|ar|ஓ}} || {{transl|ar|ஒ}} || {{transl|ar|ஐ}} || {{transl|ar|ஏ}} || {{transl|ar|எ}} || {{transl|ar|ஊ}} || {{transl|ar|உ}} || {{transl|ar|ஈ}} || {{transl|ar|இ}} || {{transl|ar|ஆ}} || {{transl|ar|அ}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|اَو}} || {{transl|ar|او}} || {{transl|ar|اٗ}} || {{transl|ar|اَی}} || {{transl|ar|ای}} || {{transl|ar|ࣣا}} || {{transl|ar|اُو}} || {{transl|ar|اُ}} || {{transl|ar|اِی}} || {{transl|ar|اِ}} || {{transl|ar|آ}} || {{transl|ar|اَ}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|au}} || {{transl|ar|ō}} || {{transl|ar|o}} || {{transl|ar|ai}} || {{transl|ar|ē}} || {{transl|ar|e}} || {{transl|ar|ū}} || {{transl|ar|u}} || {{transl|ar|ī}} || {{transl|ar|i}} || {{transl|ar|ā}} || {{transl|ar|a}}\n|-\n|}\n[[File:Arwi-lan1.png|thumbnail|arwi]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Arwi letters arranged according to the [[Arabic script in Unicode#Character table|Arabic ''{{transl|ar|hijā’ī}}'' order]]\n|-\n| || {{transl|ar|ள்}} || || {{transl|ar|ஷ்}} || {{transl|ar|ஸ்}} || {{transl|ar|ஃஜ்}} || {{transl|ar|ர்}} || {{transl|ar|ற்}} || || {{transl|ar|ட்ட்}} || {{transl|ar|ட்}} || {{transl|ar|த்}} || || || {{transl|ar|ச்ச்}} || {{transl|ar|ஜ்}} || || {{transl|ar|த்த்}} || || {{transl|ar|ஆ}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|ض}} || {{lang|ar|صٜ}} || {{lang|ar|ص}} || {{lang|ar|ش}} || {{lang|ar|س}} || {{lang|ar|ز}} || {{lang|ar|ڔ}} || {{lang|ar|ر}} || {{lang|ar|ذ}} || {{lang|ar|ڍ}} || {{lang|ar|ڊ}} || {{lang|ar|د}} || {{lang|ar|خ}} || {{lang|ar|ح}} || {{lang|ar|چ}} || {{lang|ar|ج}} || {{lang|ar|ث}} || {{lang|ar|ت}} || {{lang|ar|ب}} || {{lang|ar|ا}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|ḍ}} || {{transl|ar|L}} || {{transl|ar|ṣ}} || {{transl|ar|sh}} || {{transl|ar|s}} || {{transl|ar|z}} || {{transl|ar|r}} || {{transl|ar|R}} || {{transl|ar|dh}} || {{transl|ar|T}} || {{transl|ar|D}} || {{transl|ar|d}} || {{transl|ar|kh}} || {{transl|ar|ḥ}} || {{transl|ar|ch}} || {{transl|ar|j}} || {{transl|ar|th}} || {{transl|ar|t}} || {{transl|ar|b}} || {{transl|ar|ā}}\n|-\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|ய்}} || {{transl|ar|வ்}} || {{transl|ar|ஹ்}} || {{transl|ar|ஞ்}} || {{transl|ar|ண்}} || {{transl|ar|ந்,ன்}} || {{transl|ar|ம்}} || {{transl|ar|ல்}} || {{transl|ar|க்}} || {{transl|ar|க்க்}} || || {{transl|ar|ப்}} || {{transl|ar|ஃப்}} || || {{transl|ar|ங்}} || || || || {{transl|ar|ழ்}}\n|-\n| {{lang|ar|ي}} || {{lang|ar|و}} || {{lang|ar|ه}} || {{lang|ar|ݧ}} || {{lang|ar|ڹ}} || {{lang|ar|ن}} || {{lang|ar|م}} || {{lang|ar|ل}} || {{lang|ar|ࢴ}} || {{lang|ar|ك}} || {{lang|ar|ق}} || {{lang|ar|ڣ}} || {{lang|ar|ف}} || {{lang|ar|غ}} || {{lang|ar|ࢳ}} || {{lang|ar|ع}} || {{lang|ar|ظ}} || {{lang|ar|ط}} || {{lang|ar|ۻ}}\n|-\n| {{transl|ar|y}} || {{transl|ar|w}} || {{transl|ar|h}} || {{transl|ar|gn}} || {{transl|ar|N}} || {{transl|ar|n}} || {{transl|ar|m}} || {{transl|ar|l}} || {{transl|ar|g}} || {{transl|ar|k}} || {{transl|ar|q}} || {{transl|ar|p}} || {{transl|ar|f}} || {{transl|ar|gh}} || {{transl|ar|ng}} || '''{{transl|ar|‘}}''' || {{transl|ar| ẓ}} || {{transl|ar|ṭ}} || {{transl|ar|zh}}\n|-\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"tors\">Torsten Tschacher (2001).

This superseded previous versions based on [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] and [[Arabic script]]s.\n\nIn [[Iran]], the [[Arabic script]] is used to write the Azeri language. While there have been a few standardization efforts, the orthography and the set of letters used differs widely among Iranian Azeri writers, with at least two major branches, the orthography used by [[Behzad Behzadi]] and the ''[[Azari (magazine)|Azari]]'' magazine, and the orthography used by the ''[[Varliq]]'' magazine (both are quarterlies published in [[Tehran]]).\n\nIn [[Russia]], the Cyrillic alphabet is still used.<ref>http://derbend.ru/</ref> \n== History and development ==\n\nFrom the nineteenth century there were efforts by some intellectuals like [[Mirza Fatali Akhundov]] and [[Mammad agha Shahtakhtinski]] to replace the Arabic script and create a Latin alphabet for Azeri. In 1929, a Latin alphabet was created by [[Soviet Union]] sponsored ''Yeni türk əlifba komitəsi'' (New Turkish Alphabet Committee; Јени түрк əлифба комитəси) in [[Baku]] which hoped that the new alphabet would divide the Azerbaijanis in the USSR from those living in Iran.<ref>Script change in Azerbaijan: acts of identity, [[Lynley Hatcher]], International Journal of the Sociology of Language.

Mirza Fatali Akhundov: alphabet reformer before his time. Azer-baijan International, 8(1), 53</ref> there was some historical basis for the reform which received overwhelming support at the First Turcological Congress in Baku during 1926 where the reform was voted for 101 to 7.

This event is written in golden letters of our history\"<ref>Wright, Sue (2004), Language Policy and Language Planning, Basingstokes: Palgrave MacMillan.</ref>\nAs a result, in the Soviet Union in 1926 the [[Uniform Turkic Alphabet]] was introduced to replace the varieties of the [[Arabic script]] in use at the time.<ref>Clement, Victoria (2005).

When compared to the historic Latin alphabet: '''Ğğ''' has replaced the historic Ƣƣ (which was represented in Cyrillic by the stroked Ғғ); the undotted '''Iı''' (also used in Turkish) has replaced the historic soft sign; the dotted '''İi''' (also used in Turkish) has replaced the historic soft-dotted Ii; '''Jj''' has replaced the historic Ƶƶ; '''Öö''' has replaced the historic Ɵɵ; '''Üü''' has replaced the historic Үy; and '''Yy''' has replaced the historic Jj.\n\n=== Schwa (Ə) ===\nWhen the new Latin script was introduced on December 25, 1991, [[Umlaut (diacritic)|A-umlaut]] was selected to represent the sound /æ/. However, on May 16, 1992, it was replaced by the grapheme [[ə#The schwa symbol|schwa]] (Ə ə), used previously. Although use of Ä ä (also used in  [[Tatar alphabet#Zamanälif|Tatar]], [[Turkmen alphabet|Turkmen]], and [[Gagauz language#Alphabet|Gagauz]]) seems to be a simpler alternative as the schwa is absent in most character sets, particularly [[ISO/IEC 8859-9|Turkish encoding]], it was reintroduced; the schwa had existed continuously from 1929 to 1991 to represent Azeri's most common vowel, in both post-Arabic alphabets (Latin and Cyrillic) of Azerbaijan.\n\n== Comparison ==\nThis section contains the [[national anthem of Azerbaijan]], in the current Latin, Cyrillic, Jaꞑalif, and Perso-Arabic alphabets.\n{| cellpadding=\"8\"\n| '''1992–'''\n| '''1991-1992'''\n| '''1958–1991''' (still used in [[Dagestan]])\n| '''1939-1958'''\n| '''1933–1939'''\n| '''1929-1933'''\n| '''–1929''' (still used in [[Iranian Azerbaijan]])\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|\n:Azərbaycan!

During the 14th–16th centuries they gradually stopped using their own language and started using the [[Old Belarusian language]] rendered in the Belarusian Arabic alphabet.

This Albanian variant of the [[Abjad]] [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet|Ottoman-Persian script]] was used to write the Albanian language. The last version of the ''Elifbaja shqip'' was invented by the leader of the [[Albanian National Awakening]], Moslem scholar [[Rexhep Voka]] (1847-1917).\n\nThe [[Ottoman Turkish alphabet]] was mainly favored by [[Albanian people|Albanian]] [[Muslims]], but also used by some [[Christians]]. After being especially used during the [[Bejte]] poetry, a [[Primer (textbook)|primer]] for the Albanian language in [[Arabic script]] was published in 1861 in [[Constantinople]] by [[Daut Boriçi|Mullah Daut Boriçi]], a prominent member of the [[League of Prizren]].<ref name=\"Norris\">{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RGmzir-ITtUC&pg=PA76&dq=Daut+Bori%C3%A7i&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBWoVChMIwtachLbDyAIVhG4-Ch10UwDg#v=onepage&q=Daut%20Bori%C3%A7i&f=false| title=Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World|author=H.

In [[Elbasan]], Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the Young Turks dropped their opposition to the Latin script, and the [[Latin alphabet]] was invented. In order to eliminate ambiguity in the pronunciation of the Arabic script, [[Rexhep Voka]] developed a customized Arabic alphabet consisting of 44 consonants and vowels, which he published in 1911. However, it was hardly used anymore due to the [[Congress of Monastir]]. Tiranli Fazli then used this script to publish a thirty-two page grammar. Only one Albanian newspaper at the time ever appeared in Arabic script, and it lasted a brief period. Regardless of what script appeared, such material raised Albanian national consciousness.<ref>Robert Elsie: ''The Currents of Moslem and Bektash Writing in Albania (1850–1950).''

Various people — missionaries, colonial administrators, and scholarly researchers — devised various ways of writing . One issue similar to other efforts by Europeans to use their alphabet and home orthographic conventions was how to write African languages with unfamiliar sounds. In the case of Fula, these included how to represent sounds such as the implosive b and d, the ejective y, the [[velar n]] (the latter being present in European languages, but never in initial position), prenasalised consonants, and [[long vowel]]s, all of which are can change meaning.\n\nMajor influences on the current forms used for writing Fula were decisions made by colonial administrators in [[Northern Nigeria]] <!-- need to ref. John Philips' book here --> and the [[Africa Alphabet]]. Post independence African governments decided to retain the Latin alphabet as the basis for transcribing their languages. Various writers in Fula, such as [[Amadou Hampate Ba]] and [[Alfa Ibrahim Sow]], wrote and published in this script.\n\nMajor UNESCO-sponsored conferences on harmonising Latin-based African language orthographies in Bamako in 1966 and Niamey in 1978 confirmed standards for writing Fula. Nevertheless, orthographies for the language and its variants are determined at the country level. So while Fula writing uses basically the same character sets and rules across the region, there are some minor variations.\n\n===Orthography===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nSome general rules:\n*Vowels\n**Long vowels are doubled\n**Two different vowels are never used together\n*Consonants\n**To accentuate a consonant, double the consonant (or write ⟨'⟩ before the consonant; e.g., \"temmeere\" = \"te'meere\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}})\n\n===Alphabets by country===\n<!-- this section is very rough & needs verification -->\n\n====Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania====\n* '''[[a]], [[Aa (digraph)|aa]], [[b]], [[Mb (digraph)|mb]], [[ɓ]], [[c]], [[d]], [[Nd (digraph)|nd]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], ee, [[f]], [[g]], [[Ng (digraph)|ng]], [[h]], [[i]], [[Ii (digraph)|ii]], [[j]], [[Nj (digraph)|nj]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ŋ]], [[ñ]], [[o]], [[Oo (digraph)|oo]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[Letter combination of uu|uu]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[ƴ]]'''\n\n==== Guinea ====\n* '''[[a]], [[b]], [[ɓ]], nb, [[c]], [[d]], [[ɗ]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[ɠ]], [[Ng (digraph)|ng]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[Nj (digraph)|nj]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[ɲ]], [[ŋ]], [[o]], [[p]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[w]], [[y]], [[ƴ]]'''\nPrior to adoption of this system in 1989, the [[Guinean languages alphabet]] was used. This was based on the simple Latin alphabet with [[Typographical ligature|digraphs]] for the sounds particular to Pular, and is still used by some Pular speakers (in part because it can be typed using commercial keyboards).
