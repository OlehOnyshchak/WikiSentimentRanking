      "text": "The '''Majorana equation''' is a [[relativistic wave equation]]. It is named after the Italian physicist [[Ettore Majorana]].\n\n==Definition==\n\nThe Majorana equation is\n:<math> -i {\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /} \\psi + m \\psi_c = 0 \\qquad \\qquad (1)</math>\nwith the derivative operator <math>{\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /}</math> written in [[Feynman slash notation]] to include the [[gamma matrices]] as well as a summation over the spinor components. \n\nIn this equation, <math display=\"inline\">\\psi_c</math> ''is the charge conjugate of'' <math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math>, which can be defined in the [[Gamma_matrices#Majorana basis|Majorana basis]] as\n:<math> \\psi_c := i \\psi^*.\\ </math>\n\nThis relation leads to the alternate expression\n:<math> i {\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /} \\psi_c + m \\psi = 0 \\qquad \\qquad (2) </math>.\nIn both cases, the quantity <math display=\"inline\">m</math> is called the '''Majorana mass'''.<ref>{{cite book |first1=T.-P. |last1=Cheng |first2=L.-F. |last2=Li |title=Gauge Theory of Elementary Particle Physics |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1983 |isbn=0-19-851961-3 }}</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Similarity to Dirac equation===\n\nThe Majorana is similar to the [[Dirac equation]] in the sense that it involves four-component spinors, gamma matrices, and mass terms, but includes the [[C-symmetry|charge conjugate]]&nbsp;<math display=\"inline\">\\psi_c</math> of a [[spinor]]&nbsp;<math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math>. In contrast, the [[Weyl equation]] is for two-component spinor without mass.\n\n===Charge conservation===\n\nThe appearance of both <math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math> and <math display=\"inline\">\\psi_c</math> in the Majorana equation means that the field&nbsp;<math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math> cannot be coupled to a charged [[electromagnetic field]] without violating [[charge conservation]], since particles have the opposite charge to their own antiparticles. To satisfy this restriction, <math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math> must be taken to be neutral.\n\n==Field quanta==\n\nThe quanta of the Majorana equation allow for two classes of particles, a neutral particle and its neutral [[antiparticle]]. The frequently applied supplemental condition <math display=\"inline\">\\Psi=\\Psi_c</math> results in a single neutral particle, in which case <math display=\"inline\">\\psi</math> is known as a '''Majorana [[spinor]]'''. For a Majorana spinor, the Majorana equation is equivalent to the [[Dirac equation]].\n\n===Majorana particle===\n{{main|Majorana particle}}\n\nParticles corresponding to Majorana spinors are known as [[Majorana particle]]s, due to the above self-conjugacy constraint. All the fermions included in the [[Standard Model]] have been excluded as [[Majorana fermion]]s (since they have non-zero electric charge they cannot be antiparticles of themselves) with the exception of the [[neutrino]] (which is neutral).\n\nTheoretically, the neutrino is a possible exception to this pattern. If so, [[Double beta decay#Neutrinoless double-beta decay|neutrinoless double-beta decay]], as well as a range of lepton-number violating [[meson]] and charged [[lepton]] decays, are possible. A number of experiments probing whether the neutrino is a Majorana particle are currently underway.<ref>A.

      "text": "{{COI|date=June 2019}}\nIn [[theoretical physics]] and [[cosmology]] the  '''mass dimension one fermions of spin one half''' are  a [[dark matter]] candidate. These fermions are fundamentally different from the hitherto known matter particles, like electrons or neutrinos. Despite being endowed with spin one half they are not described by the celebrated Dirac formalism but, instead, by a spinorial Klein-Gordon formalism.\n\nIn 2004 Dharam Vir Ahluwalia (IIT Guwahati) in collaboration with Daniel Grumiller presented an unexpected theoretical discovery of spin one-half fermions with mass dimension one.

Ahluwalia, The theory of local mass dimension one fermions of spin one half,  Adv. Appl. Clifford Algebras 27 (2017) no.3, 2247-2285 . [[doi:10.1007/s00006-017-0775-1]]</ref> As a result there now exists an entirely new  quantum theory of spin one-half fermions that is free from all the mentioned issues. The interactions of the new fermions are restricted to dimension-four quartic self interaction, and also to a dimension-four coupling with the Higgs. A generalised Yukawa coupling of the new fermions with neutrinos provides an hitherto unsuspected source of lepton-number violation. The new fermions thus present a first-principle dark matter partner to Dirac fermions of the standard model with contrasting mass dimensions — that of three halves for the latter versus one of the former without mutating the statistics from fermionic to bosonic.\n\nMass dimension one fermionic field of spin one half uses ELKO as its expansion coefficients. ELKO is an acronym of the original German term \"'''E'''igenspinoren des '''L'''adungs'''k'''onjugations'''o'''perators\", designating [[spinors]] that are eigenspinors of the [[charge conjugation]] operator.\n\nSince the new fermions have a mass dimensionality mismatch with [[standard model]] matter fields they were suggested as a dark matter candidate. As a result of their scalar-like mass dimension they differ significantly from the mass dimension 3/2 Dirac fermions.<ref>M. Dias, F. de Campos and J. M.

The cup is rotated by its handle through a full twist of 360°, so that the handle is brought all the way around the central vertical axis of the cup and back to its original position.\n\nNote that after this rotation, the cup has been returned to its original orientation, but that its orientation with respect to the walls is ''twisted''.  In other words, if we lower the coffee cup to the floor of the room, the two bands will coil around each other in one full twist of a [[double helix]].  This is an example of '''orientation entanglement''': the new orientation of the coffee cup embedded in the room is not actually the same as the old orientation, as evidenced by the twisting of the rubber bands.  Stated another way, the orientation of the coffee cup has become entangled with the orientation of the surrounding walls.\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Vector coffee cup.svg|thumb|150px|The coffee cup vector. After a full rotation, the vector is unchanged.]]\nClearly the geometry of spatial vectors alone is insufficient to express the orientation entanglement (the twist of the rubber bands).  Consider drawing a vector across the cup.  A full rotation will move the vector around so that the new orientation of the vector is the same as the old one.  The vector alone doesn't know that the coffee cup is entangled with the walls of the room.\n\nIn fact, the coffee cup is inextricably entangled.  There is no way to untwist the bands without rotating the cup.  However, consider what happens instead when the cup is rotated, not through just one 360° turn, but ''two'' 360° turns for a total rotation of 720°.  Then if the cup is lowered to the floor, the two rubber bands coil around each other in two full twists of a double helix.  If the cup is now brought up through the center of one coil of this helix, and passed onto its other side, the twist disappears.  The bands are no longer coiled about each other, even though no additional rotation had to be performed.  (This experiment is more easily performed with a ribbon or belt.  See below.)\n\n[[File:Twisted ribbon solution.png|thumb|Untwisting a ribbon without rotation.]]\nThus, whereas the orientation of the cup was twisted with respect to the walls after a rotation of only 360°, it was no longer twisted after a rotation of 720°.  By only considering the vector attached to the cup, it is impossible to distinguish between these two cases, however.  It is only when we attach a '''spinor''' to the cup that we can distinguish between the twisted and untwisted case.\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Moebius coffee cup.png|thumb|right|A spinor.]]\nIn this situation, a spinor is a sort of ''polarized'' vector. In the adjacent diagram, a spinor can be represented as a vector whose head is a flag lying on one side of a [[Möbius strip]], pointing inward. Initially, suppose that the flag is on top of the strip as shown.  As the coffee cup is rotated it carries the spinor, and its flag, along the strip.  If the cup is rotated through 360°, the spinor returns to the initial position, but the flag is now underneath the strip, pointing outward.  It takes another 360° rotation in order to return the flag to its original orientation.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Formal details==\nIn three dimensions, the problem illustrated above corresponds to the fact that the [[Lie group]] [[SO(3)]] is not [[simply connected]].  Mathematically, one can tackle this problem by exhibiting the [[special unitary group]], [[SU(2)]], which is also the [[spin group]] in three [[metric signature|Euclidean]] dimensions, as a [[double covering group|double cover]] of SO(3).  If {{nowrap|''X'' {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>)}} is a vector in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, then we identify ''X'' with the 2 × 2 matrix with complex entries\n:<math>X = \\left(\\begin{matrix} x_1 & x_2 - ix_3 \\\\ x_2 + ix_3 & -x_1 \\end{matrix}\\right)</math>\n\nNote that −det(''X'') gives the square of the Euclidean length of ''X'' regarded as a vector, and that ''X'' is a [[trace-free]], or better, trace-zero [[Hermitian matrix]].\n\nThe unitary group acts on ''X'' via\n:<math>X \\mapsto MXM^\\dagger</math>\n\nwhere ''M'' ∈ SU(2).  Note that, since ''M'' is unitary,\n:<math>\\det\\left(MXM^\\dagger\\right) = \\det(X)</math>, and\n:<math>MXM^\\dagger</math> is trace-zero Hermitian.\n\nHence SU(2) acts via rotation on the vectors ''X''.  Conversely, since any [[change of basis]] which sends trace-zero Hermitian matrices to trace-zero Hermitian matrices must be unitary, it follows that every rotation also lifts to SU(2).  However, each rotation is obtained from a pair of elements ''M'' and −''M'' of SU(2).  Hence SU(2) is a double-cover of SO(3).  Furthermore, SU(2) is easily seen to be itself simply connected by realizing it as the group of unit [[quaternion]]s, a space [[homeomorphic]] to the [[3-sphere]].\n\nA unit quaternion has the cosine of half the rotation angle as its scalar part and the sine of half the rotation angle multiplying a unit vector along some rotation axis (here assumed fixed) as its pseudovector (or axial vector) part. If the initial orientation of a rigid body (with unentangled connections to its fixed surroundings) is identified with a unit quaternion having a zero pseudovector part and +1 for the scalar part, then after one complete rotation (2π rad) the pseudovector part returns to zero and the scalar part has become −1 (entangled).  After two complete rotations (4π rad) the pseudovector part again returns to zero and the scalar part returns to +1 (unentangled), completing the cycle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Plate trick]]\n* [[Tangloids]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*Feynman, Leighton, Sands.

After the first rotation of the hand, the arm will be bent, but after the second rotation it will end in the original position. To do this, the hand makes one rotation passing over its shoulder, twisting the arm, and then another rotation passing under that untwists it.\n\nThere is a [[Balinese candle dance]],<ref name=\"NYT-20140203\">{{Citation |title=Pandanggo sa ilaw - Candle Dance |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Gf8Xa0N2yk }}</ref> where an open cup of liquid is held instead of a plate. Since the feet can remain fixed during the manoeuvre, but the hand rotates twice, and all the arm and shoulder and other body segments smoothly connect the feet to the hand and undergo the intermediate rotations, then the rotation loops that each segment undergoes are progressively collapsed as one progresses from the hand along the arm to the shoulder, torso, legs and finally the feet, which represent the collapse of the loop to a point, since they did not rotate.\n\n[[Twirling|Figure-eight twirling]] used in [[baton twirling]], staff twirling in [[martial art]]s, and [[swordsmanship]], provides a similar demonstration. Here it is also fairly easy and natural to collapse the motion of the hand progressively down through a wiggle to a stationary position, providing an additional, and perhaps more intuitive demonstration that the double rotation loop can be collapsed to a point.\n\nIn [[mathematical physics]], the trick illustrates the quaternionic mathematics behind the [[spin (physics)|spin]] of [[spinor]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-strange-numbers-that-birthed-modern-algebra-20180906/|access-date=9 September 2018|title=The Strange Numbers That Birthed Modern Algebra|publisher=Quanta Magazine|date=6 Sep 2018|author=Charlie Wood}}</ref> As with the plate trick, these particles' spins return to their original state only after two full rotations, not after one.\n\n===The belt trick===\n[[File:Belt Gürtel.jpg|thumb|Leather belt with frame buckle]]\nThe same phenomenon can be demonstrated using a leather belt with an ordinary [[belt buckle|frame buckle]], whose prong serves as a pointer. The end opposite the buckle is clamped so it cannot move. The belt is extended without a twist and the buckle is kept horizontal while being turned clockwise one complete turn (360°), as evidenced by watching the prong. The belt will then appear twisted, and no maneuvering of the buckle that keeps it horizontal and pointed in the same direction can undo the twist. Obviously a 360° turn counterclockwise would undo the twist. The surprise element of the trick is that a second 360° turn in the clockwise direction, while apparently making the belt even more twisted, does allow the belt to be returned to its untwisted state by maneuvering the buckle under the clamped end while always keeping the buckle horizontal and pointed in the same direction.<ref>http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/dirac-belt/DiracBelt.html Retrieved September 9 2018</ref> \n\nMathematically, the belt serves as a record, as one moves along it, of how the buckle was transformed from its original position, with the belt untwisted, to its final rotated position. The clamped end always represents the null rotation. The trick demonstrates that a path in rotation space (SO3) that produces a 360 degree rotation is not homotopy equivalent to a null rotation, but a path that produces a double rotation (720°) is null equivalent.<ref name=Staly2010 />\n\n==In fiction==\nA fictional extension of the belt trick appears in [[Ian McEwan]]'s novel ''[[Solar (novel)|Solar]]'' as a plot device to explain the protagonist's Nobel prize work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}&nbsp; Dick van Dyke performs the plate trick in the children’s movie [[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]] (1968).<ref>{{Citation |title=Dick van Dyke Performs the Plate Trick |url=http://ariwatch.com/VS/Algorithms/PlateTrick.htm }}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal|last1=Bolker|first1=Ethan D.|title=The Spinor Spanner|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|date=November 1973|volume=80|issue=9|pages=977–984|doi=10.2307/2318771|jstor=2318771}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Pengelley|first=David|last2=Ramras|first2=Daniel|date=2017-02-21|title=How Efficiently Can One Untangle a Double-Twist?

The Lorentz group is a complex function that can be written as the product of a module times a unitary complex phase.

      "text": "In a field of [[mathematics]] known as [[representation theory]] '''pure spinors''' (or '''simple spinors''') are [[spinor]]s that are annihilated under the Clifford action by a maximal [[isotropic subspace]] of the space of vectors.  They were introduced by [[Élie Cartan]] in the 1930s to classify [[Almost complex manifold|complex structures]].  Pure spinors were introduced into the realm of theoretical physics, and elevated in their importance in the study of [[spinor bundle|spin geometry]] more generally, by [[Roger Penrose]] in the 1960s, where they became among the basic objects of study in [[twistor theory]].\n\n==Definition==\nConsider a [[complex number|complex]] [[vector space]] '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup> with even [[complex dimension]] 2''n'' and a [[quadratic form]] ''Q'', which maps a vector ''v'' to complex number ''Q''(''v'').  The [[Clifford algebra]] ''C''ℓ<sub>2n</sub>('''C''') is the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] generated by products of vectors in '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup> subject to the relation\n\n:<math>v^2=Q(v). \\, </math>\n\n[[Spinor]]s are [[module (mathematics)|modules]] of the Clifford algebra, and so in particular there is an action of '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup> on the space of spinors.  The subset of '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup> that annihilates a given spinor ψ is a complex subspace '''C'''<sup>''m''</sup>.  If ψ is nonzero then ''m'' is less than or equal to&nbsp;''n''.  If ''m'' is equal to ''n'' then ψ is said to be a ''pure spinor''.\n\n==The set of pure spinors==\nEvery pure spinor is annihilated by a half-dimensional subspace of ''C''<sup>2''n''</sup>.  Conversely given a half-dimensional subspace it is possible to determine the pure spinor that it annihilates up to multiplication by a complex number.  Pure spinors defined up to complex multiplication are called '''projective pure spinors'''.  The space of projective pure spinors is the [[homogeneous space]]\n\n:SO(2''n'')/U(''n'').\n\nNot all spinors are pure.  In general pure spinors may be separated from impure spinors via a series of [[quadratic equation]]s called pure spinor [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s.  However, in 6 or less real dimensions all spinors are pure.  In 8 dimensions there is, projectively, a single pure spinor constraint.  In 10 dimensions, the case relevant for [[superstring theory]], there are 10 constraints\n\n:<math>\\psi\\Gamma^\\mu \\psi = 0.\\,</math>\n\nwhere Γ<sup>''μ''</sup> are the [[gamma matrices]], which represent the vectors '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup> that generate the Clifford algebra.  In general there are\n\n:<math> {2n \\choose n - 4} </math>\n\nconstraints.\n\n==Pure spinors in string theory==\n<!--This all seems a bit dubious to me.  It was the second paragraph of the introduction, where it was clearly revisionist as a description of the \"history\" of pure spinors.  For example, Hitchin has known about pure spinors for ages.  Then again, string theorists love to appropriate things that have been around for ages.  So take this all with a grain of salt.-->\nRecently pure spinors have attracted attention in [[string theory]].  In the year 2000 [[Nathan Berkovits]], professor at [http://www.ift.unesp.br/ Instituto de Fisica Teorica] in São Paulo-Brazil introduced the [[pure spinor formalism]] in his paper [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/hep-th/0001035 Super-Poincare covariant quantization of the superstring]. In 2002 [[Nigel Hitchin]] introduced [[generalized Calabi–Yau manifold]]s in his paper [http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/math.DG/0209099 Generalized Calabi–Yau manifolds], where the [[generalized complex structure]] is defined by a pure spinor.  These spaces describe the geometries of [[Compactification (physics)#Flux compactification|flux compactification]]s in string theory.\n\n==References==\n\n*  Cartan, Élie.

      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Rarita–Schwinger equation''' is the\n[[theory of relativity|relativistic]] [[field equation]] of [[spin (physics)|spin]]-3/2 [[fermion]]s. It is similar to the [[Dirac equation]] for spin-1/2 fermions. This equation was first introduced by [[William Rarita]] and [[Julian Schwinger]] in 1941. \n\nIn modern notation it can be written as:<ref>S.

It corresponds to the {{math|({{sfrac|1|2}}, {{sfrac|1|2}}) ⊗ (({{sfrac|1|2}}, 0) ⊕ (0, {{sfrac|1|2}}))}} [[Representations of the Lorentz group|representation of the Lorentz group]], or rather, its {{math|(1, {{sfrac|1|2}}) ⊕ ({{sfrac|1|2}}, 1)}} part.<ref>S. Weinberg, \"The quantum theory of fields\", Vol. 1, Cambridge p. 232</ref>\n\n\nThis field equation can be derived as the [[Euler&ndash;Lagrange equation]] corresponding to the Rarita–Schwinger [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]]:<ref>S.

So far, no [[elementary particle]] with spin 3/2 has been found experimentally.  \n\nThe massless Rarita–Schwinger equation has a fermionic gauge symmetry: is invariant under the gauge transformation <math>\\psi_\\mu \\rightarrow \\psi_\\mu + \\partial_\\mu \\epsilon</math>, where <math>\\epsilon\\equiv \\epsilon_\\alpha</math>  is an arbitrary spinor field. This is simply the local [[supersymmetry]] of [[supergravity]], and the field must be a gravitino.\n\n\"Weyl\" and \"Majorana\" versions of the Rarita–Schwinger equation also exist.\n\n==Equations of motion in the massless case==\nConsider a massless Rarita-Schwinger field described by the Lagrangian density\n:<math> \\mathcal L_{RS} = \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\psi_\\rho,</math>\nwhere the sum over spin indices is implicit, <math>\\psi_\\mu</math> are Majorana spinors, and\n:<math> \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\equiv \\frac{1}{3!} \\gamma^{[\\mu}\\gamma^\\nu \\gamma^{\\rho]}. </math>\n\nTo obtain the equations of motion we vary the Lagrangian with respect to the fields <math>\\psi_\\mu</math>, obtaining:\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal L_{RS} =\n    \\delta \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\psi_\\rho\n    + \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\delta \\psi_\\rho\n    = \\delta \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\psi_\\rho\n    - \\partial_\\nu \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\delta \\psi_\\rho\n    + \\text{ boundary terms}\n</math>\nusing the Majorana flip properties<ref>Pierre Ramond - Field theory, a Modern Primer - p.40</ref>\nwe see that the second and first terms on the RHS are equal, concluding that\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal L_{RS} = 2 \\delta \\bar \\psi_\\mu \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\psi_\\rho, </math>\nplus unimportant boundary terms.\nImposing <math> \\delta \\mathcal L_{RS} = 0</math> we thus see that the equation of motion for a massless Majorana Rarita-Schwinger spinor reads:\n:<math> \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} \\partial_\\nu \\psi_\\rho = 0. </math>\n\n==Drawbacks of the equation==\nThe current description of massive, higher spin fields through either Rarita–Schwinger or [[Fierz–Pauli equation|Fierz–Pauli]] formalisms is afflicted with several maladies.\n\n===Superluminal propagation===\n\nAs in the case of the Dirac equation, electromagnetic interaction can be added by promoting the partial derivative to [[gauge covariant derivative]]:\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu \\rightarrow D_\\mu = \\partial_\\mu - i e A_\\mu </math>.\nIn 1969, Velo and Zwanziger showed that the Rarita–Schwinger Lagrangian coupled to [[electromagnetism]] leads to equation with solutions representing wavefronts, some of which propagate faster than light. In other words, \nthe field then suffers from acausal, superluminal propagation; consequently, the [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] in interaction with electromagnetism is essentially flawed{{why|date=February 2016}}.

      "text": "In [[differential geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]], a '''spin connection''' is a [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] on a [[spinor bundle]].  It is induced, in a canonical manner, from the [[affine connection]].  It can also be regarded as the [[gauge field]] generated by local [[Lorentz transformation]]s. In some canonical formulations of general relativity, a spin connection is defined on spatial slices and can also be regarded as the gauge field generated by local [[rotations]].\n\nThe spin connection occurs in two common forms: the ''Levi-Civita spin connection'', when it is derived from the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and the ''affine spin connection'', when it is obtained from the affine connection. The difference between the two of these is that the Levi-Civita connection is by definition the unique [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] connection, whereas the affine connection (and so the affine spin connection) may contain torsion.\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet <math>e_\\mu^{\\;\\,a}</math> be the local Lorentz [[frame field]]s or [[Cartan formalism (physics)|vierbein]] (also known as a tetrad), which is a set of orthogonal space time vector fields that diagonalize the metric tensor\n\n:<math>g_{\\mu \\nu} = e_\\mu^{\\;\\,a} e_\\nu^{\\;\\,b} \\eta_{ab},</math>\n\nwhere <math>g_{\\mu \\nu}</math> is the spacetime metric and <math>\\eta_{ab}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]]. Here, Latin letters denote the local [[Lorentz]] frame indices; Greek indices denote general coordinate indices. This simply expresses that <math>g_{\\mu \\nu}</math>, when written in terms of the basis <math>e_\\mu^{\\;\\,a}</math>, is locally flat. The Greek vierbein indices can be raised or lowered by the metric, i.e. <math>g^{\\mu \\nu}</math> or <math>g_{\\mu \\nu}</math>. The Latin or \"Lorentzian\" vierbein indices can be raised or lowered by <math>\\eta^{ab}</math> or <math>\\eta_{ab}</math> respectively. For example, <math>e^{\\mu a}=g^{\\mu\\nu} e_\\nu^{\\;\\,a}</math> and <math>e_{\\nu a}=\\eta_{ab} e_{\\nu}^{\\;\\,b}</math>\n\nThe [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] spin connection is given by\n:<math>\\omega_{\\mu}^{\\ ab}=e_\\nu^{\\ a}  \\Gamma^\\nu_{\\ \\sigma\\mu}e^{\\sigma b} + e_\\nu^{\\ a} \\partial_\\mu e^{\\nu b} = e_\\nu^{\\ a} \\Gamma^\\nu_{\\ \\sigma\\mu}e^{\\sigma b} - e^{\\nu b} \\partial_\\mu e_\\nu ^{\\ a},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^\\sigma_{\\mu\\nu}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]]. This definition should be taken as defining the torsion-free spin connection, since, by convention, the Christoffel symbols are derived from the [[Levi-Civita connection]], which is the single, unique connection on a manifold that is torsion-free. In general, there is no restriction: the spin connection may also contain torsion.\n\nNote that <math>\\omega_{\\mu}^{\\ ab}=e_\\nu^{\\ a} \\partial_{;\\mu} e^{\\nu b}=e_\\nu^{\\ a} ( \\partial_\\mu e^{\\nu b}+\\Gamma^\\nu_{\\ \\sigma\\mu}e^{\\sigma b})</math> using the gravitational covariant derivative <math>\\partial_{;\\mu} e^{\\nu b}</math> of the contravariant vector <math>e^{\\nu b}</math>.  The spin connection may be written purely in terms of the vierbein field as<ref>M.B. Green, J.H. Schwarz, E. Witten, \"Superstring theory\", Vol. 2.</ref>\n\n:<math>\\omega_{\\mu}^{\\ ab}=\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\nu a}(\\partial_\\mu e_\\nu^{\\ b}-\\partial_\\nu e_\\mu^{\\ b})-\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\nu b}(\\partial_\\mu e_\\nu^{\\ a}-\\partial_\\nu e_\\mu^{\\ a})-\\frac{1}{2}e^{\\rho a}e^{\\sigma b}(\\partial_\\rho e_{\\sigma c}-\\partial_\\sigma e_{\\rho c})e_\\mu^{\\ c},</math>\n\nwhich by definition is anti-symmetric in its internal indices <math>a, b</math>.\n\nThe spin connection <math>\\omega_\\mu^{\\ ab}</math> defines a covariant derivative <math>D_\\mu</math> on generalized tensors. For example, its action on <math>V_\\nu^{\\ a}</math> is\n:<math>D_\\mu V_\\nu^{\\ a} = \\partial_\\mu V_\\nu^{\\ a} + {{\\omega_\\mu}^a}_b V_\\nu^{\\ b} - \\Gamma^\\sigma_{\\ \\nu \\mu} V_\\sigma^{\\ a}</math>\n\n==Cartan's structure equations==\nIn the [[Cartan formalism (physics)|Cartan formalism]], the spin connection is used to define both torsion and curvature. These are easiest to read by working with [[differential form]]s, as this hides some of the profusion of indexes. The equations presented here are effectively a restatement of those that can be found in the article on the [[connection form]] and the [[curvature form]]. The primary difference is that these retain the indexes on the vierbein, instead of completely hiding them. More narrowly, the Cartan formalism is to be interpreted in its historical setting, as a generalization of the idea of an [[affine connection]] to a [[homogeneous space]]; it is not yet as general as the idea of a [[principal connection]] on a [[fiber bundle]]. It serves as a suitable half-way point between the narrower setting in [[Riemannian geometry]] and the fully abstract fiber bundle setting, thus emphasizing the similarity to [[gauge theory]]. Note that Cartan's structure equations, as expressed here, have a direct analog: the [[Maurer–Cartan equation]]s for [[Lie group]]s (that is, they are the same equations, but in a different setting and notation).\n\nWriting \n:<math>e^a = e_\\mu^{\\;\\,a} dx^\\mu</math>\nfor the orthonormal coordinates on the [[cotangent bundle]], the affine spin connection one-form is \n:<math>\\omega^{ab} = \\omega_\\mu^{\\;\\;ab} dx^\\mu</math>\nThe [[torsion tensor|torsion]] 2-form is given by\n:<math>\\Theta^a = de^a + \\omega^a_{\\;b} \\wedge e^b</math>\nwhile the [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature 2-form]] is\n:<math>R^a_{\\;\\,b} = d\\omega^a_{\\;\\,b} + \\omega^a_{\\;c} \\wedge \\omega^c_{\\;\\,b}\n  = \\frac{1}{2}R^a_{\\;\\,bcd}e^c\\wedge e^d</math>\nThese two equations, taken together are called '''Cartan's structure equations'''.<ref name=\"eguchi\">Tohru Eguchi, Peter B. Gilkey and Andrew J. Hanson, \"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234195796_Gravitation_Gauge_Theories_And_Differential_Geometry Gravitation, Gauge Theories and Differential Geometry]\", ''Physics Reports'' '''66''' (1980) pp 213-393.</ref>\nConsistency requires that the [[Bianchi identities]] be obeyed. The first Bianchi identity is obtained by taking the exterior derivative of the torsion:\n:<math>d\\Theta^a + \\omega^a_{\\;b} \\wedge \\Theta^b = R^a_{\\;\\,b} \\wedge e^b</math>\nwhile the second by differentiating the curvature:\n:<math>dR^a_{\\;\\,b} + \\omega^a_{\\;c} \\wedge R^c_{\\;\\,b} - R^a_{\\;\\,c} \\wedge \\omega^c_{\\;b} = 0.</math>\nThe covariant derivative for a generic [[differential form]] <math>V^a_{\\;\\,b}</math> of degree ''p'' is defined by\n:<math>DV^a_{\\;\\,b}= dV^a_{\\;\\,b} + \\omega^a_{\\;c} \\wedge V^c_{\\;\\,b} - (-1)^p V^a_{\\;\\,c} \\wedge \\omega^c_{\\;b}.</math>\nBianchi's second identity then becomes\n:<math>DR^a_{\\;\\,b}=0.</math>\nThe difference between a connection with torsion, and the unique torsionless connection is given by the [[contorsion tensor]]. Connections with torsion are commonly found in theories of [[teleparallelism]], [[Einstein–Cartan theory]], [[gauge theory gravity]] and [[supergravity]].\n\n== Derivation ==\n\n=== By the tetrad postulate ===\nIt is easy to deduce by raising and lowering indices as needed that the [[frame field]]s defined by <math>g_{\\mu \\nu} = {e_\\mu}^{a} {e_\\nu}^{b} \\eta_{ab}</math> will also satisfy <math>{e_\\mu}^a {e^\\mu}_b  = \\delta^a_b</math> and <math>{e_\\mu}^b {e^\\nu}_b  = \\delta^\\nu_\\mu</math>. We expect that <math>D_\\mu</math> will also annihilate the Minkowski metric <math>\\eta_{ab}</math>,\n:<math>D_\\mu \\eta_{ab} = \\partial_\\mu \\eta_{ab} - {\\omega_{\\mu a}}^{c} \\eta_{cb} - {\\omega_{\\mu b}}^{c} \\eta_{ac} = 0. </math>\nThis implies that the connection is anti-symmetric in its internal indices, <math>{\\omega_{\\mu}}^{ab} = - {\\omega_{\\mu}}^{ba}.</math>  \nThis is also deduced by taking the gravitational covariant derivative <math>\\partial_{;\\beta}({e_\\mu}^a {e^\\mu}_b)  = 0</math> which implies that <math>\\partial_{;\\beta}{e_\\mu}^a {e^\\mu}_b  = -{e_\\mu}^a \\partial_{;\\beta}{e^\\mu}_b </math> thus ultimately, <math>{\\omega_{\\beta}}^{ab} = -{\\omega_{\\beta}}^{ba}</math>. This is sometimes called the '''metricity condition''';<ref name=\"eguchi\"/> it is analogous to the more commonly stated metricity condition that <math>g_{\\mu\\nu;\\alpha}=0.</math> Note that this condition holds only for the Levi-Civita spin connection, and not for the affine spin connection in general.\n\nBy substituting the formula for the Christoffel symbols <math>{\\Gamma^\\nu}_{\\sigma \\mu} = {1 \\over 2} g^{\\nu \\delta} (\\partial_\\sigma g_{\\delta \\mu} + \\partial_\\mu g_{\\sigma \\delta} - \\partial_\\delta g_{\\sigma \\mu})</math> written in terms of the <math>{e_\\mu}^a</math>, the spin connection can be written entirely in terms of the <math>{e_\\mu}^a</math>,\n:<math>{\\omega_{\\mu}}^{ab} = e^{\\nu [a} ({{e_\\nu}^{b]}}_{,\\mu} - {{e_\\mu}^{b]}}_{,\\nu} + e^{\\sigma |b]} {e_\\mu}^c e_{\\nu c, \\sigma })</math>\nwhere antisymmetrization of indices has an implicit factor of 1/2.\n\n=== By the metric compatibility ===\n\nThis formula can be derived another way. To directly solve the compatibility condition for the spin connection <math>{\\omega_\\mu}^{ab}</math>, one can use the same trick that was used to solve <math>\\nabla_\\rho g_{\\alpha \\beta} = 0</math> for the Christoffel symbols <math>{\\Gamma^\\gamma}_{\\alpha \\beta}</math>. First contract the compatibility condition to give\n\n:<math>{e^\\alpha}_b {e^\\beta}_c (\\partial_{[\\alpha} e_{\\beta] a} + {\\omega_{[\\alpha a}}^{d} \\;e_{\\beta ] d}) = 0</math>.\n\nThen, do a cyclic permutation of the free indices <math>a,b,</math> and <math>c</math>, and add and subtract the three resulting equations:\n\n:<math>\\Omega_{bca} + \\Omega_{abc} - \\Omega_{cab} + 2 {e^\\alpha}_b \\omega_{\\alpha ac} = 0</math>\n\nwhere we have used the definition <math>\\Omega_{bca} := {e^\\alpha}_b {e^\\beta}_c \\partial_{[\\alpha} e_{\\beta ] a}</math>. The solution for the spin connection is\n\n:<math>\\omega_{\\alpha ca} = {1 \\over 2} {e_\\alpha}^b (\\Omega_{bca} + \\Omega_{abc} - \\Omega_{cab})</math>.\n\nFrom this we obtain the same formula as before.\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe spin connection arises in the [[Dirac equation]] when expressed in the language of [[curved spacetime]], see [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime]]. Specifically there are problems coupling gravity to [[spinor]] fields: there are no finite-dimensional spinor representations of the [[General covariance|general covariance group]]. However, there are of course spinorial representations of the [[Lorentz group]]. This fact is utilized by employing tetrad fields describing a flat tangent space at every point of spacetime. The [[Dirac matrices]] <math>\\gamma^a</math> are contracted onto vierbiens,\n\n:<math>\\gamma^a {e^\\mu}_a (x) = \\gamma^\\mu (x)</math>.\n\nWe wish to construct a generally covariant Dirac equation. Under a flat tangent space [[Lorentz transformation]] the spinor transforms as\n\n:<math>\\psi \\mapsto e^{i \\epsilon^{ab} (x) \\sigma_{ab}} \\psi</math>\n\nWe have introduced local Lorentz transformations on flat tangent space, so <math>\\epsilon_{ab}</math> is a function of space-time. This means that the partial derivative of a spinor is no longer a genuine tensor. As usual, one introduces a connection field <math>{\\omega_\\mu}^{ab}</math> that allows us to gauge the Lorentz group. The covariant derivative defined with the spin connection is,\n\n:<math>\\nabla_\\mu \\psi = (\\partial_\\mu - {i \\over 4} {\\omega_\\mu}^{ab} \\sigma_{ab}) \\psi= (\\partial_\\mu - {i \\over 4} e^{\\nu a}\\partial_{;\\mu} {e_\\nu}^b \\sigma_{ab}) \\psi</math>,\n\nand is a genuine tensor and Dirac's equation is rewritten as\n\n:<math>(i \\gamma^\\mu \\nabla_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0</math>.\n\nThe generally covariant fermion action couples fermions to gravity when added to the first order [[tetradic Palatini action]],\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L} = - {1 \\over 2 \\kappa^2} e\\, {e^\\mu}_a {e^\\nu}_b {\\Omega_{\\mu \\nu}}^{ab} [\\omega] + e \\overline{\\psi} (i \\gamma^\\mu \\nabla_\\mu - m) \\psi</math>\n\nwhere <math>e := \\det {e_\\mu}^a = \\sqrt{-g}</math> and <math>{\\Omega_{\\mu \\nu}}^{ab}</math> is the curvature of the spin connection.\n\nThe tetradic Palatini formulation of general relativity which is a first order formulation of the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] where the tetrad and the spin connection are the basic independent variables. In the 3+1 version of Palatini formulation, the information about the spatial metric, <math>q_{ab} (x)</math>, is encoded in the triad <math>e_a^i</math> (three-dimensional, spatial version of the tetrad). Here we extend the metric compatibility condition <math>D_a q_{bc} = 0</math> to <math>e_a^i</math>, that is, <math>D_a e_b^i = 0</math> and we obtain a formula similar to the one given above but for the spatial spin connection <math>\\Gamma_a^{ij}</math>.\n\nThe spatial spin connection appears in the definition of [[Ashtekar variables|Ashtekar-Barbero variables]] which allows 3+1 general relativity to be rewritten as a special type of <math>\\mathrm{SU}(2)</math> [[Yang–Mills]] gauge theory. One defines <math>\\Gamma_a^i = \\epsilon^{ijk} \\Gamma_a^{jk}</math>. The Ashtekar-Barbero connection variable is then defined as <math>A_a^i = \\Gamma_a^i + \\beta c_a^i</math> where <math>c_a^i = c_{ab} e^{bi}</math> and <math>c_{ab}</math> is the extrinsic [[curvature]] and <math>\\beta</math> is the [[Immirzi parameter]]. With <math>A_a^i</math> as the configuration variable, the conjugate momentum is the densitized triad <math>E_a^i = |\\det (e)| e_a^i</math>. With 3+1 general relativity rewritten as a special type of <math>\\mathrm{SU}(2)</math> [[Yang–Mills]] gauge theory, it allows the importation of non-perturbative techniques used in [[Quantum chromodynamics]] to canonical quantum general relativity.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Ashtekar variables]]\n* [[Dirac operator]]\n* [[Cartan connection]]\n* [[Levi-Civita connection]]\n* [[Ricci calculus]]\n* [[Supergravity]]\n* [[Torsion tensor]]\n* [[Contorsion tensor]]\n* [[Dirac equation in curved spacetime]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Hehl, F.W.; von der Heyde, P.; Kerlick, G.D.; Nester, J.M.

A distinct article discusses the [[spin representation]]s.\n\n==Motivation and physical interpretation== \nThe spin group is used in [[physics]] to describe the symmetries of (electrically neutral, uncharged) [[fermion]]s. Its complexification, Spinc, is used to describe electrically charged fermions, most notably the [[electron]]. Strictly speaking, the spin group describes a fermion in a zero-dimensional space; but of course, space is not zero-dimensional, and so the spin group is used to define [[spin structure]]s on (pseudo-)[[Riemannian manifold]]s: the spin group is the [[structure group]] of a [[spinor bundle]]. The [[affine connection]] on a spinor bundle is the [[spin connection]]; the spin connection is useful as it can simplify and bring elegance to many intricate calculations in [[general relativity]].  The spin connection in turn enables the [[Dirac equation]] to be written in curved spacetime (effectively in the [[tetrad (general relativity)|tetrad]] coordinates), which in turn provides a footing for [[quantum gravity]], as well as a formalization of [[Hawking radiation]] (where one of a pair of entangled, virtual fermions fall past the event horizon, and the other does not). In short, the spin group is a vital cornerstone, centrally important for understanding advanced concepts in modern theoretical physics. In mathematics, the spin group is interesting in its own right: not just for all these reasons, but for many more.\n\n==Construction==\nConstruction of the Spin group often starts with the construction of a certain [[Clifford algebra]] over a real vector space ''V''.<ref name=\"jost\">Jürgen Jost, ''Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis'', (2002) Springer Verlag {{isbn|3-540-42627-2}} ''(See Chapter 1.)''</ref> The Clifford algebra is the quotient of the [[tensor algebra]] T''V'' of ''V'' by a two-sided ideal.  The tensor algebra (over the reals) may be written as \n:<math>\\mathrm{T}V= \\mathbb {R} \\oplus V \\oplus (V\\otimes V) \\oplus \\cdots </math>\n\nThe Clifford algebra Cl(''V'') is then the [[quotient associative algebra|quotient algebra]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cl}(V) = \\mathrm{T}V / \\left( v \\otimes v + \\Vert v \\Vert^2 \\right)</math> \nwhere <math>\\Vert v\\Vert</math> is the norm of a vector <math>v\\in V</math>. The resulting space is naturally [[graded (mathematics)|graded]], and can be written as \n:<math>\\operatorname{Cl}(V) = \\operatorname{Cl}^0 \\oplus \\operatorname{Cl}^1 \\oplus \\operatorname{Cl}^2 \\oplus \\cdots</math>\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{Cl}^0 = \\mathbf{R}</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Cl}^1 = V</math>. The [[spin algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{spin}</math> is defined as\n:<math>\\operatorname{Cl}^2 =\\mathfrak{spin}(V) = \\mathfrak{spin}(n) ,</math>\nwhere the last is a short-hand for ''V'' being a real vector space of real dimension ''n''.  It is a [[Lie algebra]]; it has a natural action on ''V'', and in this way can be shown to be isomorphic to the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(n)</math> of the [[special orthogonal group]].\n\nThe [[pin group]] <math>\\operatorname{Pin}(V)</math> is a subgroup of <math>\\operatorname{Cl}(V)</math>'s Clifford group of all elements of the form \n:<math>v_1 v_2 \\cdots v_k ,</math> \nwhere each <math>v_i\\in V</math> is of unit length: <math>\\Vert v_i\\Vert=1.</math>\n\nThe spin group is then defined as \n:<math>\\operatorname{Spin}(V) = \\operatorname{Pin}(V) \\cap \\operatorname{Cl}^{\\text{even}}</math>\nwhere \n<math>\\operatorname{Cl}^{even}=\\operatorname{Cl}^0 \\oplus \\operatorname{Cl}^2 \\oplus \\operatorname{Cl}^4 \\oplus \\cdots</math>\nis the subspace of an even number of products. That is, Spin(''V'') consists of all elements of Pin(''V''), given above, with the restriction to ''k'' being an even number. The restriction to the even subspace is key to the formation of two-component (Weyl) spinors, constructed below.\n\nNote, incidentally, that if the set <math>\\{e_i\\}</math> are an orthonormal basis of the (real) vector space ''V'', then the quotient above endows the space with a natural anti-commuting structure:\n\n:<math>e_i e_j = -e_j e_i</math>\nif <math>i \\ne j</math> (this follows by considering <math>v\\otimes v</math> for <math>v=e_i+e_j</math>).  This anti-commutation turns out to be of tremendous importance in physics, as it captures the spirit of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s. A precise formulation is out of scope, here, but it involves the creation of a [[spinor bundle]] on [[Minkowski spacetime]]; the resulting spinor fields can be seen to be anti-commuting as a by-product of the Clifford algebra construction.  This anti-commutation property is also a key ingredient for the formulation of [[supersymmetry]]. The Clifford algebra and the spin group have many interesting and curious properties, some of which are listed below.\n\n== Double covering==\nA double covering of SO(''n'') by Spin(''n'') can be given explicitly, as follows.  Let <math>\\{e_i\\}</math> be an [[orthonormal basis]] for ''V''.  Define an anti-[[automorphism]] <math>t:\\operatorname{Cl}(V) \\to \\operatorname{Cl}(V)</math> by\n:<math>\n  \\left(e_i e_j \\cdots e_k\\right)^t \n  = e_k\\cdots e_j e_i </math>\nThis can be extended to all elements of <math>a,b\\in \\operatorname{Cl}(V)</math> by homomorphism:\n:<math> (a b)^t = b^t a^t</math>\n\nObserve that Spin(''V'') can then be defined as all elements <math>a \\in \\operatorname{Pin}(V)</math> for which\n:<math>a a^t = 1</math>\n\nWith this notation, an explicit double covering is the homomorphism given by\n:<math>\\rho(a) v = a v a^t ,</math>\nwhere <math>v \\in V</math>. The above gives a double covering of both O(''n'') by Pin(''n'') and of SO(''n'') by Spin(''n'') because <math>a</math> gives the same transformation as <math>-a</math>. With a small amount of work, it can be seen that <math>\\rho(a)</math> corresponds to reflection across a hyperplane; this follows from the anti-commuting property of the Clifford algebra.\n\n== Spinor space==\nIt is worth reviewing how spinor space and [[Weyl spinor]]s are constructed, given this formalism. Given a real vector space ''V'' of dimension {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''m''}} an even number, its [[complexification]] is <math>V \\otimes \\mathbf{C}</math>. It can be written as the direct sum of a subspace <math>W</math> of spinors and a subspace <math>\\overline{W}</math> of anti-spinors:\n\n:<math>V \\otimes \\mathbf{C} = W \\oplus \\overline{W}</math>\n\nThe space <math>W</math> is spanned by the spinors\n<math>\\eta_k = \\left( e_{2k-1} -ie_{2k} \\right) / \\sqrt 2</math>\nfor <math>1\\le k\\le m</math> and the complex conjugate spinors span <math>\\overline{W}</math>.  It is straightforward to see that the spinors anti-commute, and that the product of a spinor and anti-spinor is a scalar.\n\nThe '''spinor space''' is defined as the [[exterior algebra]] <math>\\textstyle{\\bigwedge} W</math>. The (complexified) Clifford algebra acts naturally on this space; the (complexified) spin group corresponds to the length-preserving [[endomorphism]]s. There is a natural grading on the exterior algebra: The product of an odd number of copies of <math>W</math> correspond to the physics notion of fermions; the even subspace corresponds to the bosons. The representations of the action of the spin group on the spinor space can be built in a relatively straightforward fashion.<ref name=\"jost\"/>\n\n==Complex case==\n{{Main|Spin structure#SpinC structures}}\nThe Spin<sup>''c''</sup> group is defined by the [[exact sequence]] \n:<math>1 \\to \\mathrm{Z}_2 \\to \\operatorname{Spin}^{\\mathbf{C}}(n) \\to \\operatorname{SO}(n)\\times \\operatorname{U}(1) \\to 1.</math>\n\nIt is a multiplicative subgroup of the [[complexification]] <math>\\operatorname{Cl}(V)\\otimes \\mathbf{C}</math> of the Clifford algebra, and specifically, it is the subgroup generated by Spin(''V'') and the unit circle in '''C'''.  Alternately, it is the quotient\n:<math>\\operatorname{Spin}^{\\mathbf{C}}(V) = \\left( \\operatorname{Spin}(V) \\times S^1 \\right) / \\sim</math>\nwhere the equivalence <math>\\sim</math> identifies {{nowrap|(''a'', ''u'')}} with {{nowrap|(−''a'', −''u'')}}.\n\nThis has important applications in 4-manifold theory and [[Seiberg–Witten theory]].  In physics, the Spin group is appropriate for describing uncharged fermions, while the Spin<sup>'''C'''</sup> group is used to describe electrically charged fermions. In this case, the U(1) symmetry is specifically the [[gauge group]] of [[electromagnetism]].\n\n==Accidental isomorphisms==\nIn low dimensions, there are [[isomorphism]]s among the classical Lie groups called ''[[accidental isomorphism]]s''. For instance, there are isomorphisms between low-dimensional spin groups and certain classical Lie groups, owing to low-dimensional isomorphisms between the [[root system]]s (and corresponding isomorphisms of [[Dynkin diagram]]s) of the different families of [[simple Lie algebra]]s. Writing '''R''' for the reals, '''C''' for the complex numbers, '''H''' for the [[quaternion]]s and the general understanding that Cl(''n'') is a short-hand for Cl('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) and that Spin(''n'') is a short-hand for Spin('''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>) and so on, one then has that<ref name=\"jost\"/>\n\n:Cl(1) = '''C''' the complex numbers\n:Pin(1) = {+i, −i, +1, −1}\n:Spin(1) = [[Orthogonal group|O(1)]] = {+1, −1} &nbsp; &nbsp;  the orthogonal group of dimension zero.\n--\n:Cl(2) = [[quaternion|'''H''']] the quaternions\n:Spin(2) = [[U(1)]] = [[Special orthogonal group|SO(2)]], which acts on ''z'' in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> by double phase rotation {{nowrap|''z'' ↦ ''u''<sup>2</sup>''z''}}. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  dim = 1\n--\n:Cl(3) = '''H''' ⊕ '''H'''\n:Spin(3) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]] = [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]], corresponding to <math>B_1 \\cong A_1</math>. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  dim = 3\n--\n:Cl(4)= M(2, '''H''') the two-by-two matrices with quaternionic coefficients\n:Spin(4) = SU(2)&nbsp;×&nbsp;SU(2), corresponding to <math>D_2 \\cong A_1 \\times A_1</math>. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  dim = 6\n--\n:Spin(5) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(2)]], corresponding to <math>B_2 \\cong C_2</math>.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; dim = 10\n:Spin(6) = [[Special unitary group|SU(4)]], corresponding to <math>D_3 \\cong A_3</math>.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; dim = 15\n\nThere are certain vestiges of these isomorphisms left over for {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 7, 8}} (see [[Spin(8)]] for more details). For higher ''n'', these isomorphisms disappear entirely.\n\n==Indefinite signature==\nIn [[signature (quadratic form)|indefinite signature]], the spin group {{nowrap|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}} is constructed through [[Clifford algebra]]s in a similar way to standard spin groups. It is a [[covering group|double cover]] of {{nowrap|SO<sub>0</sub>(''p'', ''q'')}}, the [[connected component of the identity]] of the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|SO(''p'', ''q'')}}. For {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' > 2}}, {{nowrap|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}} is connected; for {{nowrap|1=(''p'', ''q'') = (1, 1)}} there are two connected components<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55487352|title=Supersymmetry for mathematicians : an introduction|last=Varadarajan|first=V. S.|date=2004|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=|isbn=0821835742|location=Providence, R.I.|pages=|oclc=55487352}}</ref>{{rp|193}}. As in definite signature, there are some accidental isomorphisms in low dimensions:\n\n:Spin(1, 1) = [[General linear group|GL(1, '''R''')]]\n:Spin(2, 1) = [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]]\n:Spin(3, 1) = [[Special linear group|SL(2, '''C''')]]\n:Spin(2, 2) = [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]] × [[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]]\n:Spin(4, 1) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(1, 1)]]\n:Spin(3, 2) = [[Symplectic group|Sp(4, '''R''')]]\n:Spin(5, 1) = [[Special linear group|SL(2, '''H''')]]\n:Spin(4, 2) = [[Special unitary group|SU(2, 2)]]\n:Spin(3, 3) = [[Special linear group|SL(4, '''R''')]]\n:Spin(6, 2) = [[Special unitary group|SU(2, 2, '''H''')]]\n\nNote that {{nowrap|1=Spin(''p'', ''q'') = Spin(''q'', ''p'')}}.\n\n==Topological considerations==\n[[Connected space|Connected]] and [[simply connected]] Lie groups are classified by their Lie algebra. So if ''G'' is a connected Lie group with a simple Lie algebra, with ''G''′ the [[universal cover]] of ''G'', there is an inclusion\n\n:<math> \\pi_1 (G) \\subset \\operatorname{Z}(G'), </math>\n\nwith Z(''G''′) the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''G''′. This inclusion and the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of ''G'' determine ''G'' entirely (note that it is not the case that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and π<sub>1</sub>(''G'') determine ''G'' entirely; for instance SL(2, '''R''') and PSL(2, '''R''') have the same Lie algebra and same fundamental group '''Z''', but are not isomorphic).\n\nThe definite signature Spin(''n'') are all [[simply connected]] for ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2, so they are the universal coverings of SO(''n'').\n\nIn indefinite signature, Spin(''p'', ''q'') is not necessarily connected, and in general the [[identity component]], Spin<sub>0</sub>(''p'',  ''q''), is not simply connected, thus it is not a universal cover. The fundamental group is most easily understood by considering the [[maximal compact subgroup]] of SO(''p'',  ''q''), which is SO(''p'')&nbsp;×&nbsp;SO(''q''), and noting that rather than being the product of the 2-fold covers (hence a 4-fold cover), Spin(''p'',  ''q'') is the \"diagonal\" 2-fold cover – it is a 2-fold quotient of the 4-fold cover. Explicitly, the maximal compact connected subgroup of Spin(''p'',  ''q'') is\n\n:Spin(''p'') × Spin(''q'')/{(1, 1), (−1, −1)}.\n\nThis allows us to calculate the [[fundamental groups]] of Spin(''p'', ''q''), taking ''p'' ≥ ''q'':\n\n:<math>\\pi_1(\\mbox{Spin}(p,q)) = \\begin{cases}\n\\{0\\} & (p,q)=(1,1) \\mbox{ or } (1,0) \\\\\n\\{0\\} & p > 2, q = 0,1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z} & (p,q)=(2,0) \\mbox{ or } (2,1) \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z} \\times \\mathbf{Z} & (p,q) = (2,2) \\\\\n\\mathbf{Z} & p > 2, q=2 \\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}_2 & p, q >2\\\\\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThus once ''p'', ''q'' > 2 the fundamental group is Z<sub>2</sub>, as it is a 2-fold quotient of a product of two universal covers.\n\nThe maps on fundamental groups are given as follows. For ''p'', ''q'' > 2, this implies that the map π<sub>1</sub>(Spin(''p'', ''q'')) → π<sub>1</sub>(SO(''p'', ''q'')) is given by 1 ∈ Z<sub>2</sub> going to (1,1) ∈ Z<sub>2</sub> × Z<sub>2</sub>. For ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, ''q''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2, this map is given by 1 ∈ '''Z''' → (1,1) ∈ '''Z''' × Z<sub>2</sub>. And finally, for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, (1,0) ∈ '''Z''' × '''Z''' is sent to (1,1) ∈ '''Z''' × '''Z''' and (0, 1) is sent to (1, −1).\n\n==Center==\nThe center of the spin groups, for n≥3, (complex and real) are given as follows:<ref name=\":0\" />{{rp|208}}\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{Z}(\\operatorname{Spin}(n,\\mathbf{C})) &= \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{Z}_2 & n = 2k+1\\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}_4 & n = 4k+2\\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathrm{Z}_2 & n = 4k\\\\\n\\end{cases} \\\\\n\\operatorname{Z}(\\operatorname{Spin}(p,q)) &= \\begin{cases}\n\\mathrm{Z}_2 & p \\text{ or } q \\text{ odd}\\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}_4 & n = 4k+2, \\text{ and } p, q \\text{ even}\\\\\n\\mathrm{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathrm{Z}_2 & n = 4k, \\text{ and } p, q \\text{ even}\\\\\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Quotient groups==\n[[Quotient group]]s can be obtained from a spin group by quotienting out by a subgroup of the center, with the spin group then being a [[covering group]] of the resulting quotient, and both groups having the same Lie algebra.\n\nQuotienting out by the entire center yields the minimal such group, the [[projective special orthogonal group]], which is [[centerless]], while quotienting out by {±1} yields the special orthogonal group – if the center equals {±1} (namely in odd dimension), these two quotient groups agree. If the spin group is simply connected (as Spin(''n'') is for ''n'' > 2), then Spin is the ''maximal'' group in the sequence, and one has a sequence of three groups,\n:Spin(''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;SO(''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;PSO(''n''),\nsplitting by parity yields:\n:Spin(2''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;SO(2''n'')&nbsp;→&nbsp;PSO(2''n''),\n:Spin(2''n''+1)&nbsp;→&nbsp;SO(2''n''+1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;PSO(2''n''+1),\nwhich are the three [[compact real form]]s (or two, if SO&nbsp;=&nbsp;PSO ) of the [[compact Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{so} (n, \\mathbf{R}).</math>\n\nThe [[homotopy group]]s of the cover and the quotient are related by the [[long exact sequence of a fibration]], with discrete fiber (the fiber being the kernel) – thus all homotopy groups for ''k'' > 1 are equal, but π<sub>0</sub> and π<sub>1</sub> may differ.\n\nFor ''n'' > 2, Spin(''n'') is [[simply connected]] (π<sub>0</sub> = π<sub>1</sub> = {1} is trivial), so SO(''n'') is connected and has fundamental group Z<sub>2</sub> while PSO(''n'') is connected and has fundamental group equal to the center of Spin(''n'').\n\nIn indefinite signature the covers and homotopy groups are more complicated – Spin(''p'', ''q'') is not simply connected, and quotienting also affects connected components. The analysis is simpler if one considers the maximal (connected) compact SO(''p'') × SO(''q'') ⊂ SO(''p'', ''q'') and the [[component group]] of Spin(''p'', ''q'').\n\n==Postnikov tower==\nThe spin group appears in a [[Postnikov tower]] anchored by the [[orthogonal group]]:\n\n:<math>\\ldots\\rightarrow \\text{Fivebrane}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{String}(n)\\rightarrow \\text{Spin}(n)\\rightarrow \\text{SO}(n) \\rightarrow \\text{O}(n) </math>\n\nThe tower is obtained by successively removing (killing) homotopy groups of increasing order. This is done by constructing [[short exact sequence]]s starting with an [[Eilenberg&ndash;MacLane space]] for the homotopy group to be removed. Killing the {{pi}}<sub>3</sub> homotopy group in Spin(''n''), one obtains the infinite-dimensional [[string group]] String(''n'').\n\n==Discrete subgroups==\nDiscrete subgroups of the spin group can be understood by relating them to discrete subgroups of the special orthogonal group (rotational [[point group]]s).\n\nGiven the double cover Spin(''n'') → SO(''n''), by the [[lattice theorem]], there is a [[Galois connection]] between subgroups of Spin(''n'') and subgroups of SO(''n'') (rotational point groups): the image of a subgroup of Spin(''n'') is a rotational point group, and the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of Spin(''n''), and the [[closure operator]] on subgroups of Spin(''n'') is multiplication by {±1}. These may be called \"binary point groups\"; most familiar is the 3-dimensional case, known as [[binary polyhedral group]]s.\n\nConcretely, every binary point group is either the preimage of a point group (hence denoted 2''G'', for the point group ''G''), or is an index 2 subgroup of the preimage of a point group which maps (isomorphically) onto the point group; in the latter case the full binary group is abstractly <math>\\mathrm{C}_2 \\times G</math> (since {±1} is central). As an example of these latter, given a cyclic group of odd order <math>\\mathrm{C}_{2k+1}</math> in SO(''n''), its preimage is a cyclic group of twice the order, <math>\\mathrm{C}_{4k+2} \\cong \\mathrm{C}_{2k+1} \\times \\mathrm{C}_2,</math> and the subgroup  ''C''<sub>2''k''+1</sub> < Spin(''n'')  maps isomorphically to ''C''<sub>2''k''+1</sub> <  SO(''n'').\n\nOf particular note are two series:\n* higher [[binary tetrahedral group]]s, corresponding to the 2-fold cover of symmetries of the ''n''-simplex.\n*:This group can also be considered as the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the symmetric group]], 2⋅ A<sub>''n''</sub> → A<sub>''n''</sub>, with the alternating group being the (rotational) symmetry group of the ''n''-simplex.\n* higher [[binary octahedral group]]s, corresponding to the 2-fold covers of the [[hyperoctahedral group]] (symmetries of the [[hypercube]], or equivalently of its dual, the [[cross-polytope]]).\n\nFor point groups that reverse orientation, the situation is more complicated, as there are two [[pin group]]s, so there are two possible binary groups corresponding to a given point group.\n\n==See also==\n{{Colbegin}}\n* [[Clifford algebra]]\n* [[Clifford analysis]]\n* [[Spinor]]\n* [[Spinor bundle]]\n* [[Spin structure]]\n* [[Table of Lie groups]]\n* [[Anyon]]\n* [[Orientation entanglement]]\n{{Colend}}\n\n===Related groups===\n* [[Pin group]] Pin(''n'') – two-fold cover of [[orthogonal group]], O(''n'')\n* [[Metaplectic group]] Mp(2''n'') – two-fold cover of [[symplectic group]], Sp(2''n'')\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Cite book | last1=Karoubi | first1=Max|title=K-Theory | publisher=Springer | isbn=978-3-540-79889-7 | year=2008 |pages=210–214| postscript=<!--None-->}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spin Group}}\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Topology of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Spinors]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''spin representations''' are particular [[projective representation]]s of the [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]] or [[special orthogonal group]]s in arbitrary [[dimension]] and [[metric signature|signature]] (i.e., including [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s). More precisely, they are [[representation of a Lie group|representations]] of the [[spin group]]s, which are [[Double covering group|double cover]]s of the special orthogonal groups. They are usually studied over the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number]]s, but they can be defined over other [[field (mathematics)|field]]s.\n\nElements of a spin representation are called [[spinor]]s. They play an important role in the [[physics|physical]] description of [[fermion]]s such as the [[electron]].\n\nThe spin representations may be constructed in several ways, but typically the construction involves (perhaps only implicitly) the choice of a maximal isotropic subspace in the vector representation of the group. Over the real numbers, this usually requires using a complexification of the vector representation. For this reason, it is convenient to define the spin representations over the complex numbers first, and derive [[real representation]]s by introducing [[real structure]]s.\n\nThe properties of the spin representations depend, in a subtle way, on the dimension and signature of the orthogonal group. In particular, spin representations often admit [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] [[bilinear form]]s, which can be used to [[Embedding|embed]] the spin groups into [[classical Lie group]]s. In low dimensions, these embeddings are [[surjective]] and determine special isomorphisms between the spin groups and more familiar Lie groups; this elucidates the properties of spinors in these dimensions.\n\n==Set-up==\n\nLet {{math|''V''}} be a [[dimension (vector space)|finite-dimensional]] real or complex [[vector space]] with a [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] [[quadratic form]] {{math|''Q''}}. The (real or complex) [[linear map]]s preserving {{math|''Q''}} form the [[orthogonal group]] {{math|O(''V'', ''Q'')}}. The identity component of the group is called the special orthogonal group {{math|SO(''V'', ''Q'')}}. (For {{math|''V''}} real with an indefinite quadratic form, this terminology is not standard: the special orthogonal group is usually defined to be a subgroup with two components in this case.)  Up to [[group isomorphism]], {{math|SO(''V'', ''Q'')}} has a unique [[connected space|connected]] [[Double covering group|double cover]], the spin group {{math|Spin(''V'', ''Q'')}}. There is thus a [[group homomorphism]] {{math|Spin(''V'', ''Q'') → SO(''V'', ''Q'')}} whose [[kernel (group theory)|kernel]] has two elements denoted {{math|<nowiki/>{1, −1<nowiki/>}}}, where {{math|1}} is the [[identity element]].\n\nThe groups {{math|O(''V'', ''Q''), SO(''V'', ''Q'')}} and {{math|Spin(''V'', ''Q'')}} are all [[Lie groups]], and for fixed {{math|(''V'', ''Q'')}} they have the same [[Lie algebra]], {{math|'''so'''(''V'', ''Q'')}}. If {{math|''V''}} is real, then {{math|''V''}} is a real vector subspace of its [[complexification]] {{math|''V''<sub>'''C'''</sub> {{=}} ''V'' ⊗<sub>'''R'''</sub> '''C'''}}, and the quadratic form {{math|''Q''}} extends naturally to a quadratic form {{math|''Q''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} on {{math|''V''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}. This embeds {{math|SO(''V'', ''Q'')}} as a [[subgroup]] of {{math|SO(''V''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, ''Q''<sub>'''C'''</sub>)}}, and hence we may realise {{math|Spin(''V'', ''Q'')}} as a subgroup of {{math|Spin(''V''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, ''Q''<sub>'''C'''</sub>)}}. Furthermore, {{math|'''so'''(''V''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, ''Q''<sub>'''C'''</sub>)}} is the complexification of {{math|'''so'''(''V'', ''Q'')}}.\n\nIn the complex case, quadratic forms are determined up to isomorphism by the dimension {{math|''n''}} of {{math|''V''}}. Concretely, we may assume {{math|''V'' {{=}} '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} and\n:<math>Q(z_1,\\ldots, z_n) = z_1^2+ z_2^2+\\cdots+z_n^2.</math>\nThe corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebra are denoted {{math|O(''n'', '''C'''), SO(''n'', '''C'''), Spin(''n'', '''C''')}} and {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}}.\n\nIn the real case, quadratic forms are determined up to isomorphism by a pair of nonnegative integers {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} where {{math|''n'' {{=}} ''p'' + ''q''}} is the dimension of {{math|''V''}}, and {{math|''p'' − ''q''}} is the [[Sylvester's law of inertia|signature]]. Concretely, we may assume {{math|''V'' {{=}} '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} and\n:<math>Q(x_1,\\ldots, x_n) = x_1^2+ x_2^2+\\cdots+x_p^2-(x_{p+1}^2+\\cdots +x_{p+q}^2).</math>\nThe corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebra are denoted {{math|O(''p'', ''q''), SO(''p'', ''q''), Spin(''p'', ''q'')}} and {{math|'''so'''(''p'', ''q'')}}. We write {{math|'''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>}} in place of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} to make the signature explicit.\n\nThe spin representations are, in a sense, the simplest [[representation of a Lie group|representation]]s of {{math|Spin(''n'', '''C''')}} and {{math|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}} that do not come from representations of {{math|SO(''n'', '''C''')}} and {{math|SO(''p'', ''q'')}}. A spin representation is, therefore, a real or complex vector space {{math|''S''}} together with a group homomorphism {{math|''ρ''}} from {{math|Spin(''n'', '''C''')}} or {{math|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}} to the [[general linear group]] {{math|GL(''S'')}} such that the element {{math|−1}} is ''not'' in the kernel of {{math|''ρ''}}.\n\nIf {{math|''S''}} is such a representation, then according to the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras, it induces a [[Lie algebra representation]], i.e., a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]] from {{math|'''so'''(''n'', ''C'')}} or {{math|'''so'''(''p'', ''q'')}} to the Lie algebra {{math|'''gl'''(''S'')}} of [[linear map#Endomorphisms and automorphisms|endomorphisms]] of {{math|''S''}} with the [[commutator#Ring theory|commutator bracket]].\n\nSpin representations can be analysed according to the following strategy: if {{math|''S''}} is a real spin representation of {{math|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}}, then its complexification is a complex spin representation of {{math|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}}; as a representation of {{math|'''so'''(''p'', ''q'')}}, it therefore extends to a complex representation of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}}. Proceeding in reverse, we therefore ''first'' construct complex spin representations of {{math|Spin(''n'', '''C''')}} and {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}}, then restrict them to complex spin representations of {{math|'''so'''(''p'', ''q'')}} and {{math|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}}, then finally analyse possible reductions to real spin representations.\n\n==Complex spin representations==\n\nLet {{math|1=''V'' = '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} with the standard quadratic form {{math|''Q''}} so that \n:<math>\\mathfrak{so}(V,Q) = \\mathfrak{so}(n,\\mathbb C).</math>\nThe [[symmetric bilinear form]] on {{math|''V''}} associated to {{math|''Q''}} by [[Polarization identity#Symmetric bilinear forms|polarization]] is denoted {{math|{{langle}}.,.{{rangle}}}}.\n\n===Isotropic subspaces and root systems===\n\nA standard construction of the spin representations of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}} begins with a choice of a pair {{math|(''W'', ''W''<sup>∗</sup>)}}\nof maximal [[isotropic quadratic form|totally isotropic subspace]]s (with respect to {{math|''Q''}}) of {{math|''V''}} with {{math|''W'' ∩ ''W''<sup>∗</sup> {{=}} 0}}. Let us make such a choice. If {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2''m''}} or {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2''m'' + 1}}, then {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} both have dimension {{math|''m''}}. If {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2''m''}}, then {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''W'' ⊕ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}, whereas if {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2''m'' + 1}}, then {{math|''V'' {{=}} ''W'' ⊕ ''U'' ⊕ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}, where {{math|''U''}} is the 1-dimensional orthogonal complement to {{math|''W'' ⊕ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}. The bilinear form {{math|{{langle}}.,.{{rangle}}}} associated to {{math|''Q''}} induces a [[bilinear map|pairing]] between {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}, which must be nondegenerate, because {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} are totally isotropic subspaces and {{math|''Q''}} is nondegenerate. Hence {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} are [[dual vector space]]s.\n\nMore concretely, let {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; ''a''<sub>''m''</sub>}} be a basis for {{math|''W''}}. Then there is a unique basis {{math|''&alpha;''<sub>1</sub>, ... ''&alpha;''<sub>''m''</sub>}} of {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} such that\n:<math> \\langle \\alpha_i,a_j\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}.</math>\nIf {{math|''A''}} is an {{math|''m'' &times; ''m''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''}} induces an endomorphism of {{math|''W''}} with respect to this basis and the transpose {{math|''A''<sup>T</sup>}} induces a transformation of {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} with\n:<math> \\langle Aw, w^* \\rangle = \\langle w,A^\\mathrm{T} w^*\\rangle</math>\nfor all {{math|''w''}} in {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''w''<sup>∗</sup>}} in {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}. It follows that the endomorphism {{math|''&rho;''<sub>''A''</sub>}} of {{math|''V''}}, equal to {{math|''A''}} on {{math|''W''}}, {{math|&minus;''A''<sup>T</sup>}} on {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} and zero on {{math|''U''}} (if {{math|''n''}} is odd), is skew,\n:<math> \\langle  \\rho_A u, v \\rangle = -\\langle u,\\rho_A v\\rangle</math>\nfor all {{math|''u'', ''v''}} in {{math|''V''}}, and hence (see [[classical group]]) an element of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''') ⊂ End(''V'')}}.\n\nUsing the diagonal matrices in this construction defines a [[Cartan subalgebra]] {{math|'''h'''}} of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}}: the [[rank of a Lie group|rank]] of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}} is {{math|''m''}}, and the diagonal {{math|''n'' &times; ''n''}} matrices determine an {{math|''m''}}-dimensional abelian subalgebra.\n\nLet {{math|''ε''<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; ''ε''<sub>''m''</sub>}} be the basis of {{math|'''h'''<sup>∗</sup>}} such that, for a diagonal matrix {{math|''A'', ''ε''<sub>''k''</sub>(''&rho;''<sub>''A''</sub>)}} is the {{math|''k''}}th diagonal entry of {{math|''A''}}. Clearly this is a basis for {{math|'''h'''<sup>∗</sup>}}. Since the bilinear form identifies {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}} with <math>\\wedge^2 V</math>, explicitly,\n:<math>x \\wedge y \\mapsto \\varphi_{x \\wedge y}, \\quad \\varphi_{x \\wedge y}(v) = 2(\\langle y, v\\rangle x - \\langle x, v\\rangle y),\\quad x \\wedge y \\in \\wedge^2V,\\quad x,y,v \\in V, \\quad \\varphi_{x \\wedge y} \\in \\mathfrak{so}(n, \\mathbb{C}),</math><ref>{{harvnb|Fulton|Harris|1991}} Chapter 20, p.303. The factor 2 is not important, it is there to agree with the Clifford algebra construction.</ref>\nit is now easy to construct the [[root system]] associated to {{math|'''h'''}}. The [[root space]]s (simultaneous eigenspaces for the action of {{math|'''h'''}}) are spanned by the following elements:\n:<math> a_i\\wedge a_j,\\; i\\neq j,</math> with [[root system|root]] (simultaneous eigenvalue) <math>\\varepsilon_i + \\varepsilon_j</math>\n:<math> a_i\\wedge \\alpha_j</math> (which is in {{math|'''h'''}} if {{math|''i'' {{=}} ''j'')}} with root <math> \\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_j</math>\n:<math> \\alpha_i\\wedge \\alpha_j,\\; i\\neq j,</math> with root <math> -\\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_j,</math>\nand, if {{math|''n''}} is odd, and {{math|''u''}} is a nonzero element of {{math|''U''}},\n:<math> a_i\\wedge u,</math> with root <math> \\varepsilon_i </math>\n:<math> \\alpha_i\\wedge u,</math> with root <math> -\\varepsilon_i.</math>\nThus, with respect to the basis {{math|''ε''<sub>1</sub>, &hellip; ''ε''<sub>''m''</sub>}}, the roots are the vectors in {{math|'''h'''<sup>∗</sup>}} that are permutations of\n:<math>(\\pm 1,\\pm 1, 0, 0, \\dots, 0)</math>\ntogether with the permutations of\n:<math>(\\pm 1, 0, 0, \\dots, 0)</math>\nif {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2''m'' + 1}} is odd.\n\nA system of [[positive root]]s is given by {{math|''ε''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''ε''<sub>''j''</sub> (''i'' ≠ ''j''), ''ε''<sub>''i''</sub> &minus; ''ε''<sub>''j''</sub> (''i'' < ''j'')}} and (for {{math|''n''}} odd) {{math|''ε''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. The corresponding [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s are\n:<math>\\varepsilon_1-\\varepsilon_2, \\varepsilon_2-\\varepsilon_3, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{m-1}-\\varepsilon_m, \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\n\\varepsilon_{m-1}+\\varepsilon_m& n=2m\\\\\n\\varepsilon_m & n=2m+1.\n\\end{matrix}\\right.</math>\nThe positive roots are nonnegative integer linear combinations of the simple roots.\n\n===Spin representations and their weights===\n\nOne construction of the spin representations of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}} uses the [[exterior algebra]](s)\n:<math>S=\\wedge^\\bullet W</math> and/or <math>S'=\\wedge^\\bullet W^*.</math>\nThere is an action of {{math|''V''}} on {{math|''S''}} such that for any element {{math|1=''v'' = ''w'' + ''w''<sup>∗</sup>}} in {{math|''W'' ⊕ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} and any {{math|''&psi;''}} in {{math|''S''}} the action is given by:\n:<math>  v\\cdot \\psi = 2^{\\frac{1}{2}}(w\\wedge\\psi+\\iota(w^*)\\psi), </math>\nwhere the second term is a contraction ([[interior multiplication]]) defined using the bilinear form, which pairs {{math|''W''}} and {{math|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}. This action respects the [[Clifford relation]]s {{math|1=''v''<sup>2</sup> = ''Q''(''v'')'''1'''}}, and so induces a homomorphism from the [[Clifford algebra]] {{math|Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C'''}} of {{math|''V''}} to {{math|End(''S'')}}. A similar action can be defined on {{math|''S''&prime;}}, so that both {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''S''&prime;}} are [[Clifford module]]s.\n\nThe Lie algebra {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}} is isomorphic to the complexified Lie algebra {{math|'''spin'''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>'''C'''</sup>}} in {{math|Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C'''}} via the mapping induced by the covering {{math|Spin(''n'') → SO(''n'')}}\n:<math> v \\wedge w \\mapsto \\tfrac14[v,w].</math>\nIt follows that both {{math|''S''}} and {{math|''S''&prime;}} are representations of {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''C''')}}. They are actually [[isomorphism|equivalent]] representations, so we focus on ''S''.\n\nThe explicit description shows that the elements {{math|''&alpha;''<sub>''i''</sub> ∧ ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} of the Cartan subalgebra {{math|'''h'''}} act on {{math|''S''}} by\n:<math> (\\alpha_i\\wedge a_i) \\cdot \\psi = \\tfrac14 (2^{\\tfrac12})^{2} ( \\iota(\\alpha_i)(a_i\\wedge\\psi)-a_i\\wedge(\\iota(\\alpha_i)\\psi))\n= \\tfrac12 \\psi - a_i\\wedge(\\iota(\\alpha_i)\\psi).</math>\nA basis for {{math|''S''}} is given by elements of the form\n:<math> a_{i_1}\\wedge a_{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge a_{i_k}</math>\nfor {{math|0 ≤ ''k'' ≤ ''m''}} and {{math|''i''<sub>1</sub> < ... < ''i''<sub>''k''</sub>}}. These clearly span [[weight space]]s for the action of {{math|'''h'''}}: {{math|''&alpha;''<sub>''i''</sub> ∧ ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} has eigenvalue −1/2 on the given basis vector if {{math|1=''i'' = ''i''<sub>''j''</sub>}} for some {{math|''j''}}, and has eigenvalue {{math|1/2}} otherwise.\n\nIt follows that the [[weight (representation theory)|weights]] of {{math|''S''}} are all possible combinations of\n:<math>\\bigl(\\pm \\tfrac12,\\pm \\tfrac12, \\ldots \\pm\\tfrac12\\bigr)</math>\nand each [[weight space]] is one-dimensional. Elements of {{math|''S''}} are called [[Dirac spinor]]s.\n\nWhen {{math|''n''}} is even, {{math|''S''}} is not an [[irreducible representation]]: <math>S_+=\\wedge^{\\mathrm{even}} W</math> and <math>S_-=\\wedge^{\\mathrm{odd}} W</math> are invariant subspaces. The weights divide into those with an even number of minus signs, and those with an odd number of minus signs. Both ''S''<sub>+</sub> and ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub> are irreducible representations of dimension 2<sup>''m''&minus;1</sup> whose elements are called [[Weyl spinor]]s. They are also known as chiral spin representations or half-spin representations. With respect to the positive root system above, the [[highest weight]]s of ''S''<sub>+</sub> and ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub> are\n:<math>\\bigl(\\tfrac12,\\tfrac12, \\ldots\\tfrac12, \\tfrac12\\bigr)</math> and <math>\\bigl(\\tfrac12,\\tfrac12, \\ldots\\tfrac12, -\\tfrac12\\bigr)</math>\nrespectively. The Clifford action identifies Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' with End(''S'') and the [[Clifford algebra#Grading|even subalgebra]] is identified with the endomorphisms preserving ''S''<sub>+</sub> and ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub>. The other [[Clifford module]] ''S''&prime; is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to ''S'' in this case.\n\nWhen ''n'' is odd, ''S'' is an irreducible representation of '''so'''(''n'','''C''') of dimension 2<sup>''m''</sup>: the Clifford action of a unit vector ''u'' ∈ ''U'' is given by \n:<math> u\\cdot \\psi = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\n\\psi&\\hbox{if } \\psi\\in \\wedge^{\\mathrm{even}} W\\\\\n-\\psi&\\hbox{if } \\psi\\in \\wedge^{\\mathrm{odd}} W\n\\end{matrix}\\right.</math>\nand so elements of '''so'''(''n'','''C''') of the form ''u''∧''w'' or ''u''∧''w''<sup>∗</sup> do not preserve the even and odd parts of the exterior algebra of ''W''. The highest weight of ''S'' is\n:<math>\\bigl(\\tfrac12,\\tfrac12, \\ldots \\tfrac12\\bigr).</math>\nThe Clifford action is not faithful on ''S'': Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' can be identified with End(''S'') ⊕ End(''S''&prime;), where ''u'' acts with the opposite sign on ''S''&prime;. More precisely, the two representations are related by the [[parity (mathematics)|parity]] [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''&alpha;'' of Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' (also known as the principal automorphism), which is the identity on the even subalgebra, and minus the identity on the odd part of Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C'''. In other words, there is a [[linear isomorphism]] from ''S'' to ''S''&prime;, which identifies the action of ''A'' in Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' on ''S'' with the action of ''&alpha;''(''A'') on ''S''&prime;.\n\n===Bilinear forms===\n\nif ''&lambda;'' is a weight of ''S'', so is &minus;''&lambda;''. It follows that ''S'' is isomorphic to the [[dual representation]] ''S''<sup>∗</sup>.\n\nWhen ''n'' = 2''m'' + 1 is odd, the isomorphism ''B'': ''S'' → ''S''<sup>∗</sup> is unique up to scale by [[Schur's lemma]], since ''S'' is irreducible, and it defines a nondegenerate invariant bilinear form ''&beta;'' on ''S'' via\n:<math>\\beta(\\varphi,\\psi) = B(\\varphi)(\\psi).</math>\nHere invariance means that\n: <math>\\beta(\\xi\\cdot\\varphi,\\psi) + \\beta(\\varphi,\\xi\\cdot\\psi) = 0</math>\nfor all ''&xi;'' in '''so'''(''n'','''C''') and ''&phi;'', ''&psi;'' in ''S'' &mdash; in other words the action of ''&xi;'' is skew with respect to ''&beta;''. In fact, more is true: ''S''<sup>∗</sup> is a representation of the [[opposite category|opposite]] Clifford algebra, and therefore, since Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' only has two nontrivial [[simple module]]s ''S'' and ''S''&prime;, related by the parity involution ''&alpha;'', there is an [[antiautomorphism]] ''&tau;'' of Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C''' such that\n: <math>\\quad\\beta(A\\cdot\\varphi,\\psi) = \\beta(\\varphi,\\tau(A)\\cdot\\psi)\\qquad (1)</math>\nfor any ''A'' in Cl<sub>''n''</sub>'''C'''. In fact ''&tau;'' is reversion (the antiautomorphism induced by the identity on ''V'') for ''m'' even, and conjugation (the antiautomorphism induced by minus the identity on ''V'') for ''m'' odd. These two antiautomorphisms are related by parity involution ''&alpha;'', which is the automorphism induced by minus the identity on ''V''. Both satisfy ''&tau;''(''&xi;'') = &minus;''&xi;'' for ''&xi;'' in '''so'''(''n'','''C''').\n\nWhen ''n'' = 2''m'', the situation depends more sensitively upon the parity of ''m''. For ''m'' even, a weight ''&lambda;'' has an even number of minus signs if and only if &minus;''&lambda;'' does; it follows that there are separate isomorphisms ''B''<sub>±</sub>: ''S''<sub>±</sub> → ''S''<sub>±</sub><sup>∗</sup> of each half-spin representation with its dual, each determined uniquely up to scale. These may be combined into an isomorphism ''B'': ''S'' → ''S''<sup>∗</sup>. For ''m'' odd, ''&lambda;'' is a weight of ''S''<sub>+</sub> if and only if &minus;''&lambda;'' is a weight of ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub>; thus there is an isomorphism from ''S''<sub>+</sub> to ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub><sup>∗</sup>, again unique up to scale, and its [[Dual space#Transpose of a linear map|transpose]] provides an isomorphism from ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub> to ''S''<sub>+</sub><sup>∗</sup>. These may again be combined into an isomorphism ''B'': ''S'' → ''S''<sup>∗</sup>.\n\nFor both ''m'' even and ''m'' odd, the freedom in the choice of ''B'' may be restricted to an overall scale by insisting that the bilinear form ''&beta;'' corresponding to ''B'' satisfies (1), where ''&tau;'' is a fixed antiautomorphism (either reversion or conjugation).\n\n===Symmetry and the tensor square===\n\nThe symmetry properties of ''&beta;'': ''S'' ⊗ ''S'' → '''C''' can be determined using Clifford algebras or representation theory. In fact much more can be said: the tensor square ''S'' ⊗ ''S'' must decompose into a direct sum of ''k''-forms on ''V'' for various ''k'', because its weights are all elements in '''h'''<sup>∗</sup> whose components belong to {&minus;1,0,1}. Now [[equivariant]] linear maps ''S'' ⊗ ''S'' → ∧<sup>''k''</sup>''V''<sup>∗</sup> correspond bijectively to invariant maps ∧<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' ⊗ ''S'' ⊗ ''S'' → '''C''' and nonzero such maps can be constructed via the inclusion of ∧<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' into the Clifford algebra. Furthermore, if ''&beta;''(''&phi;'',''&psi;'') = ''&epsilon;'' ''&beta;''(''&psi;'',''&phi;'') and ''&tau;'' has sign ''&epsilon;''<sub>''k''</sub> on ∧<sup>''k''</sup>''V'' then\n:<math>\\beta(A\\cdot\\varphi,\\psi) = \\varepsilon\\varepsilon_k \\beta(A\\cdot\\psi,\\varphi)</math>\nfor ''A'' in ∧<sup>''k''</sup>''V''.\n\nIf ''n'' = 2''m''+1 is odd then it follows from Schur's Lemma that\n:<math> S\\otimes S \\cong \\bigoplus_{j=0}^{m} \\wedge^{2j} V^*</math>\n(both sides have dimension 2<sup>2''m''</sup> and the representations on the right are inequivalent). Because the symmetries are governed by an involution ''&tau;'' that is either conjugation or reversion, the symmetry of the ∧<sup>''2j''</sup>''V''<sup>∗</sup> component alternates with ''j''. Elementary combinatorics gives\n:<math> \\sum_{j=0}^m (-1)^j \\dim \\wedge^{2j} \\Complex^{2m+1} = (-1)^{\\frac12 m(m+1)} 2^m = (-1)^{\\frac12 m(m+1)}(\\dim \\mathrm S^2S-\\dim \\wedge^2 S)</math>\nand the sign determines which representations occur in S<sup>2</sup>''S'' and which occur in ∧<sup>2</sup>''S''.<ref>This sign can also be determined from the observation that if ''&phi;'' is a highest weight vector for ''S'' then ''&phi;''⊗''&phi;'' is a highest weight vector for &and;<sup>''m''</sup>''V'' &cong; &and;<sup>''m''+1</sup>''V'', so this summand must occur in S<sup>2</sup>''S''.</ref> In particular\n:<math> \\beta(\\phi,\\psi)=(-1)^{\\frac12 m(m+1)}\\beta(\\psi,\\phi),</math> and\n:<math> \\beta(v\\cdot\\phi,\\psi) = (-1)^m(-1)^{\\frac12 m(m+1)}\\beta(v\\cdot\\psi,\\phi) = (-1)^m \\beta(\\phi,v\\cdot\\psi)</math>\nfor ''v'' ∈ ''V'' (which is isomorphic to ∧<sup>2''m''</sup>''V''), confirming that ''&tau;'' is reversion for ''m'' even, and conjugation for ''m'' odd.\n\nIf ''n'' = 2''m'' is even, then the analysis is more involved, but the result is a more refined decomposition: S<sup>2</sup>''S''<sub>±</sub>, &and;<sup>2</sup>''S''<sub>±</sub> and ''S''<sub>+</sub> ⊗ ''S''<sub>&minus;</sub> can each be decomposed as a direct sum of ''k''-forms (where for ''k'' = ''m'' there is a further decomposition into selfdual and antiselfdual ''m''-forms).\n\nThe main outcome is a realisation of '''so'''(''n'','''C''') as a subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra on ''S'', depending upon ''n'' modulo 8, according to the following table:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n!

However, there are additional \"reality\" structures that are invariant under the action of the real Lie algebras. These come in three types.\n# There is an invariant complex antilinear map ''r'': ''S'' → ''S'' with ''r''<sup>2</sup> = id<sub>''S''</sub>. The fixed point set of ''r'' is then a real vector subspace ''S''<sub>'''R'''</sub> of ''S'' with ''S''<sub>'''R'''</sub> ⊗ '''C''' = ''S''. This is called a '''real structure'''.\n# There is an invariant complex antilinear map ''j'': ''S'' → ''S'' with ''j''<sup>2</sup> = &minus;id<sub>''S''</sub>. It follows that the triple ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'':=''ij'' make ''S'' into a quaternionic vector space ''S''<sub>'''H'''</sub>. This is called a '''quaternionic structure'''.\n# There is an invariant complex antilinear map ''b'': ''S'' → ''S''<sup>∗</sup> that is invertible. This defines a pseudohermitian bilinear form on ''S'' and is called a '''hermitian structure'''.\n\nThe type of structure invariant under '''so'''(''p'',''q'') depends only on the signature ''p'' &minus; ''q'' modulo 8, and is given by the following table.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center\"\n! ''p''&minus;''q'' mod 8\n| 0\n| 1\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n| 5\n| 6\n| 7\n|-\n!

Since ''n'' = ''p'' + ''q'' ≅ ''p'' − ''q'' mod 2, there are two cases: the dimension and signature are both even, and the dimension and signature are both odd.\n\nThe odd case is simpler, there is only one complex spin representation ''S'', and hermitian structures do not occur. Apart from the trivial case ''n'' = 1, ''S'' is always even-dimensional, say dim ''S'' = 2''N''. The real forms of '''so'''(2''N'','''C''') are '''so'''(''K'',''L'') with ''K'' + ''L'' = 2''N'' and '''so'''<sup>∗</sup>(''N'','''H'''), while the real forms of '''sp'''(2''N'','''C''') are '''sp'''(2''N'','''R''') and '''sp'''(''K'',''L'') with  ''K'' + ''L'' = ''N''. The presence of a Clifford action of ''V'' on ''S'' forces ''K'' = ''L'' in both cases unless ''pq'' = 0, in which case ''KL''=0, which is denoted simply '''so'''(2''N'') or '''sp'''(''N''). Hence the odd spin representations may be summarized in the following table.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!\n! ''n'' mod 8\n! 1, 7\n! 3, 5\n|-\n! ''p''-''q'' mod 8\n!\n!

For {{math|''n'' > 2}}, the complex half-spin representations are even-dimensional. We have additionally to deal with hermitian structures and the real forms of {{math|'''sl'''(2''N'', '''C''')}}, which are {{math|'''sl'''(2''N'', '''R''')}}, {{math|'''su'''(''K'', ''L'')}} with {{math|1=''K'' + ''L'' = 2''N''}}, and {{math|'''sl'''(''N'', '''H''')}}.

(Similarly, any orientation reversing orthogonal transformation is either a reflection or the product of three reflections.)  Thus if ''R'' is a rotation which decomposes as the reflection in the plane perpendicular to a unit vector '''u'''<sub>1</sub> followed by the reflection in the plane perpendicular to '''u'''<sub>2</sub>, then the matrix ''U''<sub>2</sub>''U''<sub>1</sub>''XU''<sub>1</sub>''U''<sub>2</sub> represents the rotation of the vector '''x''' through ''R''.\n\nHaving effectively encoded all of the rotational linear geometry of 3-space into a set of complex 2&times;2 matrices, it is natural to ask what role, if any, the 2&times;1 matrices (i.e., the [[column vector]]s) play.  Provisionally, a '''spinor''' is a column vector\n:<math>\\xi=\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\xi_1\\\\\\xi_2\\end{matrix}\\right],</math> with complex entries ''ξ''<sub>1</sub> and ''ξ''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe space of spinors is evidently acted upon by complex 2&times;2 matrices.  Furthermore, the product of two reflections in a given pair of unit vectors defines a 2&times;2 matrix whose action on euclidean vectors is a rotation, so there is an action of rotations on spinors.  However, there is one important caveat: the factorization of a rotation is not unique.  Clearly, if ''X'' → ''RXR''<sup>−1</sup> is a representation of a rotation, then replacing ''R'' by −''R'' will yield the same rotation.  In fact, one can easily show that this is the only ambiguity which arises.  Thus the action of a rotation on a spinor is always ''double-valued''.\n\nThere were some precursors to Cartan's work with 2×2 complex matrices: [[Wolfgang Pauli]] had used these matrices so intently that elements of a certain [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of a four-dimensional subspace are called [[Pauli matrices]] &sigma;<sub>i</sub>, so that the Hermitian matrix is written as a [[Pauli matrices#Pauli vector|Pauli vector]] <math>\\vec{x} \\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}.</math><ref>The Pauli vector is a formal device. It may be thought of as an element of {{math|''M''<sub>2</sub>(ℂ) ⊗ ℝ<sup>3</sup>}}, where the [[tensor product|tensor product space]] is endowed with a mapping {{math|⋅: ℝ<sup>3</sup> × ''M''<sub>2</sub>(ℂ) ⊗ ℝ<sup>3</sup> → ''M''<sub>2</sub>(ℂ)}}.</ref> In the mid 19th century the algebraic operations of this algebra of four complex dimensions were studied as [[biquaternion]]s.\n\n==Isotropic vectors ==\n\nSpinors can be constructed directly from [[isotropic line|isotropic vector]]s in 3-space without using the quaternionic construction.  To motivate this introduction of spinors, suppose that ''X'' is a matrix representing a vector '''x''' in complex 3-space.  Suppose further that '''x''' is isotropic: i.e.,\n:<math>{\\mathbf x}\\cdot{\\mathbf x} = x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=0.</math>\nThen since the determinant of ''X'' is zero there is a proportionality between its rows or columns. Thus the matrix may be written as an [[outer product]] of two complex 2-vectors:\n:<math>X=2\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\xi_1\\\\\\xi_2\\end{matrix}\\right]\\left[\\begin{matrix}-\\xi_2&\\xi_1\\end{matrix}\\right].</math>\nThis factorization yields an [[overdetermined system]] of equations in the coordinates of the vector '''x''':\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\left.\\begin{matrix}\n\\xi_1^2-\\xi_2^2&=x_1\\\\\ni(\\xi_1^2+\\xi_2^2)&=x_2\\\\\n-2\\xi_1\\xi_2&=x_3\n\\end{matrix}\\right\\}\n</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nsubject to the constraint\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>x_1^2+x_2^2+x_3^2=0.</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nThis system admits the solutions\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\xi_1=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{x_1-ix_2}{2}},\\quad \\xi_2=\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{-x_1-ix_2}{2}}.</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nEither choice of sign solves the system ({{EquationNote|1}}).  Thus a spinor may be viewed as an isotropic vector, along with a choice of sign.  Note that because of the [[branch cut|logarithmic branching]], it is impossible to choose a sign consistently so that ({{EquationNote|3}}) varies continuously along a full rotation among the coordinates '''x'''.  In spite of this ambiguity of the representation of a rotation on a spinor, the rotations do act unambiguously by a [[fractional linear transformation]] on the ratio ''ξ''<sub>1</sub>:''ξ''<sub>2</sub> since one choice of sign in the solution ({{EquationNote|3}}) forces the choice of the second sign.  In particular, the space of spinors is a [[projective representation]] of the orthogonal group.\n\nAs a consequence of this point of view, spinors may be regarded as a kind of \"square root\" of isotropic vectors.  Specifically, introducing the matrix\n:<math>C=\\left(\\begin{matrix}0&1\\\\-1&0\\end{matrix}\\right),</math>\nthe system ({{EquationNote|1}}) is equivalent to solving ''X'' = 2 ''ξ'' <sup>t</sup>''ξ'' ''C'' for the undetermined spinor ''ξ''.\n\n''A fortiori'', if the roles of ''ξ'' and '''x''' are now reversed, the form ''Q''(''ξ'') = '''x''' defines, for each spinor ''ξ'', a vector '''x''' quadratically in the components of ''ξ''.  If this quadratic form is [[polarization of an algebraic form|polarized]], it determines a bilinear vector-valued form on spinors ''Q''(''μ'', ''ξ'').  This bilinear form then transform tensorially under a reflection or a rotation.\n\n== Reality ==\nThe above considerations apply equally well whether the original euclidean space under consideration is real or complex.  When the space is real, however, spinors possess some additional structure which in turn facilitates a complete description of the representation of the rotation group.  Suppose, for simplicity, that the inner product on 3-space has positive-definite signature:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\left|x\\right|^2 = x_1^2 + x^2_2 + x_3^2</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nWith this convention, real vectors correspond to Hermitian matrices.  Furthermore, real rotations preserving the form ({{EquationNote|4}}) correspond (in the double-valued sense) to unitary matrices of determinant one.  In modern terms, this presents the [[special unitary group]] SU(2) as a [[Double covering group|double cover]] of SO(3).  As a consequence, the spinor Hermitian product\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\langle\\mu|\\xi\\rangle = \\bar{\\mu}_1\\xi_1+\\bar{\\mu}_2\\xi_2</math>|{{EquationRef|5}}}}\n\nis preserved by all rotations, and therefore is canonical.\n\nIf, however, the signature of the inner product on 3-space is indefinite (i.e., non-degenerate, but also not positive definite), then the foregoing analysis must be adjusted to reflect this.  Suppose then that the length form on 3-space is given by:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\left|\\mathbf{x}\\right|^2 = x_1^2 - x^2_2 + x_3^2</math>|{{EquationRef|4&prime;}}}}\n\nThen the construction of spinors of the preceding sections proceeds, but with ''x''<sub>2</sub> replacing ''i x''<sub>2</sub> in all the formulas.  With this new convention, the matrix associated to a real vector (''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) is itself real:\n:<math>\\left(\\begin{matrix}x_3&x_1-x_2\\\\x_1+x_2&-x_3\\end{matrix}\\right)</math>.\nThe form ({{EquationNote|5}}) is no longer invariant under a real rotation (or reversal), since the group stabilizing ({{EquationNote|4&prime;}}) is now a [[Lorentz group]] O(2,1).  Instead, the anti-Hermitian form\n:<math>\\langle\\mu|\\xi\\rangle = \\bar{\\mu}_1\\xi_2-\\bar{\\mu}_2\\xi_1</math>\ndefines the appropriate notion of inner product for spinors in this metric signature.  This form is invariant under transformations in the connected component of the identity of O(2,1).\n\nIn either case, the quartic form\n:<math>\\langle\\mu|\\xi\\rangle^2 = \\hbox{length}\\left(Q(\\bar{\\mu},\\xi)\\right)^2</math>\nis fully invariant under O(3) (or O(2,1), respectively), where ''Q'' is the vector-valued bilinear form described in the previous section.  The fact that this is a quartic invariant, rather than quadratic, has an important consequence.  If one confines attention to the group of special orthogonal transformations, then it is possible unambiguously to take the square root of this form and obtain an identification of spinors with their duals.  In the language of representation theory, this implies that there is only one irreducible spin representation of SO(3) (or SO(2,1)) up to isomorphism.  If, however, reversals (e.g., reflections in a plane) are also allowed, then it is no longer possible to identify spinors with their duals owing to a change of sign on the application of a reflection.  Thus there are two irreducible spin representations of O(3) (or O(2,1)), sometimes called the '''pin representations'''.\n\n==Reality structures==\n\nThe differences between these two signatures can be codified by the notion of a ''[[reality structure]]'' on the space of spinors.  Informally, this is a prescription for taking a complex conjugate of a spinor, but in such a way that this may not correspond to the usual conjugate per the components of a spinor.  Specifically, a reality structure is specified by a Hermitian 2 &times; 2 matrix ''K'' whose product with itself is the identity matrix: ''K''<sup>2</sup> = ''Id''.  The conjugate of a spinor with respect to a reality structure ''K'' is defined by\n:<math>\\xi^* = K\\bar{\\xi}.</math>\n\nThe particular form of the inner product on vectors (e.g., ({{EquationNote|4}}) or ({{EquationNote|4&prime;}})) determines a reality structure (up to a factor of -1) by requiring\n:<math>\\bar{X}=KXK\\,</math>, whenever ''X'' is a matrix associated to a real vector.\nThus ''K'' = ''i C'' is the reality structure in Euclidean signature ({{EquationNote|4}}), and ''K'' = ''Id'' is that for signature ({{EquationNote|4&prime;}}).  With a reality structure in hand, one has the following results:\n* ''X'' is the matrix associated to a real vector if, and only if, <math>\\bar{X} = K X K\\,</math>.\n* If μ and ''ξ'' is a spinor, then the inner product \n::<math>\\langle\\mu|\\xi\\rangle = i\\,^t\\mu^* C \\xi</math>\n:determines a Hermitian form which is invariant under proper orthogonal transformations.\n<!-- Somewhere around here (?) would be a good place to talk about the equivalence and non-equivalence of the covariant and contravariant representations, according as the spin group or pin group is used. -->\n\n==Examples in physics==\n\n===Spinors of the Pauli spin matrices ===\n{{see also|quaternions and spatial rotation}}\n\nOften, the first example of spinors that a student of physics \nencounters are the 2&times;1 spinors used in Pauli's theory of electron spin.\nThe [[Pauli matrices]] are a vector of three 2&times;2 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]\nthat are used as [[Spin (physics)|spin]] [[Operator (physics)|operators]].\n\nGiven a [[unit vector]] in 3 dimensions, for example (''a'', ''b'', ''c''), one takes a\n[[dot product]] with the Pauli spin matrices to obtain a spin matrix for\nspin in the direction of the unit vector.\n\nThe [[eigenvector]]s of that spin matrix are the spinors for\nspin-1/2 oriented in the direction given by the vector.\n\nExample: ''u'' = (0.8, -0.6, 0) is a unit vector.  Dotting this with the Pauli\nspin matrices gives the matrix:\n\n:<math>\n  S_u = (0.8,-0.6,0.0)\\cdot \\vec{\\sigma}=0.8 \\sigma_{1}-0.6\\sigma_{2}+0.0\\sigma_{3} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0.0 & 0.8+0.6i \\\\\n    0.8-0.6i & 0.0\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe eigenvectors may be found by the usual methods of \n[[linear algebra]], but a convenient trick\nis to note that a Pauli spin matrix is an [[involutory matrix]], that is, the square of the above matrix is the [[identity matrix]].\n\nThus a (matrix) solution to the eigenvector problem with eigenvalues of\n±1 is simply 1 ± ''S<sub>u</sub>''.  That is,\n\n:<math>\nS_u (1\\pm S_u) = \\pm 1 (1 \\pm S_u)\n</math>\n\nOne can then choose either of the columns of the eigenvector\nmatrix as the vector solution, provided that the column chosen\nis not zero.  Taking the first column of the above,\neigenvector solutions for the two eigenvalues are:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.0+ (0.0)\\\\\n0.0 +(0.8-0.6i)\n\\end{bmatrix},\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1.0- (0.0)\\\\\n0.0-(0.8-0.6i)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe trick used to find the eigenvectors is related to the concept of\n[[Ideal (ring theory)|ideals]], that is, the matrix eigenvectors (1 ± ''S<sub>u</sub>'')/2 are [[projection operator]]s or [[idempotent]]s and therefore each generates an\n[[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in the Pauli algebra.  The same trick\nworks in any [[Clifford algebra]], in particular\nthe [[Gamma matrices|Dirac algebra]] that is discussed below.  These projection\noperators are also seen in [[density matrix]] theory\nwhere they are examples of pure density matrices.\n\nMore generally, the projection operator for spin in the (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') direction\nis given by\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix}1+c&a-ib\\\\a+ib&1-c\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nand any non zero column can be taken as the projection operator.  While the\ntwo columns appear different, one can use ''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> = 1 to show that they are multiples (possibly zero) of the same spinor.\n\n===General remarks===\nIn [[atomic physics]] and [[Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]], the property of ''spin'' plays a major role.  In addition to their other properties all particles possess a non-classical property, i.e., which has no correspondence at all in conventional physics, namely the [[Spin (physics)|spin]], which is a kind of ''intrinsic angular momentum''. In the position representation, instead of a wavefunction without spin, ''ψ'' = ''ψ''('''r'''), one has with spin: ''ψ'' = ''ψ''('''r''', ''σ''), where ''σ'' takes the following discrete set of values: \n:<math>\\sigma =-S\\cdot\\hbar , -(S-1)\\cdot\\hbar , ... ,+(S-1)\\cdot\\hbar ,+S\\cdot\\hbar </math>. \nThe  ''total angular momentum'' operator, <math>\\vec{\\mathbb J}</math>, of a particle corresponds to the ''sum'' of the ''orbital angular momentum'' (i.e., there only integers are allowed) and the ''intrinsic part'', the ''spin''. One distinguishes [[boson]]s (S = 0, ±1, ±2, ...) and [[fermion]]s (S = ±1/2, ±3/2, ±5/2, ...).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bloch sphere]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Spinors]]\n\n[[ru:Спинор трёхмерного пространства]]"

Each player holds one of the blocks of wood. The first player holds one block of wood still, while the other player rotates the other block of wood for two full revolutions. The plane of rotation is perpendicular to the  strings when not tangled. The strings now overlap each other. Then the first player tries to untangle the strings without rotating either piece of wood. Only translations (moving the pieces without rotating) are allowed. Afterwards, the players reverse roles; whoever can untangle the strings fastest is the winner. Try it with only one revolution. The strings are of course overlapping again but they can not be untangled without rotating one of the two wooden blocks.\n\nThis game serves to clarify the notion that rotations in space have properties that cannot be intuitively explained by considering only the rotation of a single rigid object in space. Specifically, considering the rotation of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s and derived quantities (i.e., [[tensor]]s of higher order via tensor multiplication) does not provide for all the properties of rotations as a more abstract concept.{{Clarify|What properties of rotations? \"Rotations as a more abstract concept\" dodges a description.|date=July 2011}} The extra information in representation theory of groups is provided by the [[spinor]] representations. These are objects defined in mathematical terms that do transform under the given rotation group (see [[group theory]]) but however their properties cannot be visualized with the idea of rotating a rigid object. These extra features are provided for in this game with the presence of strings.\n\nThe pedagogical aim is to show that rotations have extra consequences when one considers properties of the object being subjected to them in relation with its surroundings or space itself. Without trying to make a direct analogy one can be convinced of the importance of considering these extra properties following the rationale implied by this game: an object is defined here consisting of two rods and strings connecting them. Applying a rotation means here rotating one of the two rods 360 degrees. The ''rod'' returns in the same place as before the rotation, thus we say that ''it transforms as a vector under rotations in three-dimensional space (i.e. under the special [[orthogonal group]] of dimension 3)''. We are not saying any more here other than that if you turn a full circle around your self you will end up where you were before. However, ''the object as we defined it being the two rods and string is not in the same state as before'', the strings are entangled and ''cannot be unentangled without applying again a rotation in any part of the system''. If we rotate the rod again in the same directions so that it will have completed a 720 degrees rotation in total ''the strings can be untangled without rotating any part'' (e.g. by \"sliding\" the rods and/or stretching the strings). We then say it transforms as a spinor. This is actually how an electron behaves and we say it is a [[spin-1/2]] particle.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[orientation entanglement]]\n* [[plate trick]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMA6eQXxT3k-s Tangloids], YouTube\n\n[[Category:Mathematical games]]\n[[Category:Spinors]]"

Most commonly, it describes those special features of the [[Dynkin diagram]] D<sub>4</sub> and the associated [[Lie group]] [[Spin(8)]], the [[Double covering group|double cover]] of 8-dimensional rotation group [[SO(8)]], arising because the group has an [[outer automorphism]] of order three. There is a geometrical version of triality, analogous to [[Duality (projective geometry)|duality in projective geometry]].\n\nOf all [[simple Lie group]]s, Spin(8) has the most symmetrical Dynkin diagram, D<sub>4</sub>. The diagram has four nodes with one node located at the center, and the other three attached symmetrically. The [[symmetry group]] of the diagram is the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>3</sub> which acts by permuting the three legs. This gives rise to an ''S''<sub>3</sub> group of outer automorphisms of Spin(8). This [[automorphism group]] permutes the three 8-dimensional [[irreducible representation]]s of Spin(8); these being the ''vector'' representation and two [[chirality (mathematics)|chiral]] ''spin'' representations. These automorphisms do not project to automorphisms of SO(8). The vector representation—the natural action of SO(8) (hence Spin(8)) on {{math|''F''<sup>8</sup>}}—consists over the real numbers of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 8-vectors]] and is generally known as the \"defining module\", while the chiral spin representations are also known as [[spinor|\"half-spin representations\"]], and all three of these are [[fundamental representation]]s.\n\nNo other Dynkin diagram has an automorphism group of order greater than 2; for other D<sub>''n''</sub> (corresponding to other even Spin groups, Spin(2''n'')), there is still the automorphism corresponding to switching the two half-spin representations, but these are not isomorphic to the vector representation.\n\nRoughly speaking, symmetries of the Dynkin diagram lead to automorphisms of the [[Bruhat–Tits building]] associated with the group.  For [[special linear group]]s, one obtains projective duality.  For Spin(8), one finds a curious phenomenon involving 1-, 2-, and 4-dimensional subspaces of 8-dimensional space, historically known as \"geometric triality\".\n\nThe exceptional 3-fold symmetry of the D<sub>4</sub> diagram also gives rise to the [[Steinberg group (Lie theory)|Steinberg group]] [[3D4|<sup>3</sup>D<sub>4</sub>]].\n\n==General formulation==\n\nA duality between two vector spaces over a field {{mvar|F}} is a non-degenerate [[bilinear form]]\n:<math> V_1\\times V_2\\to F,</math>\ni.e., for each non-zero vector {{mvar|v}} in one of the two vector spaces, the pairing with {{mvar|v}} is a non-zero [[linear functional]] on the other.\n\nSimilarly, a triality between three vector spaces over a field {{mvar|F}} is a non-degenerate [[multilinear form|trilinear form]]\n:<math> V_1\\times V_2\\times V_3\\to F,</math>\ni.e., each non-zero vector in one of the three vector spaces induces a duality between the other two.\n\nBy choosing vectors {{math|''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} in each {{math|''V''<sub>''i''</sub>}} on which the trilinear form evaluates to 1, we find that the three vector spaces are all [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to each other, and to their duals. Denoting this common vector space by {{mvar|V}}, the triality may be re-expressed as a [[algebra over a field|bilinear multiplication]]\n:<math> V \\times V \\to V</math>\nwhere each {{math|''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} corresponds to the identity element in {{mvar|V}}. The non-degeneracy condition now implies that {{mvar|V}} is a [[composition algebra]]. It follows that {{mvar|V}} has dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8. If further {{math|1=''F'' = [[real number|'''R''']]}} and the form used to identify {{mvar|V}} with its dual is [[definite quadratic form|positively definite]], then {{mvar|V}} is a [[Hurwitz's theorem (composition algebras)|Euclidean Hurwitz algebra]], and is therefore isomorphic to '''R''', '''C''', '''H''' or&nbsp;'''O'''.\n\nConversely, composition algebras immediately give rise to trialities by taking each {{math|''V''<sub>''i''</sub>}} equal to the algebra, and [[tensor contraction|contracting]] the multiplication with the inner product on the algebra to make a trilinear form.\n\nAn alternative construction of trialities uses spinors in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8. The eight-dimensional case corresponds to the triality property of Spin(8).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Triple product]], may be related to the 4-dimensional triality (on [[quaternion]]s)\n\n==References==\n\n* [[John Frank Adams]] (1981), ''Spin(8), Triality, F<sub>4</sub> and all that'', in \"Superspace and supergravity\", edited by Stephen Hawking and Martin Roček, Cambridge University Press, pages 435&ndash;445.\n* [[John Frank Adams]] (1996), ''Lectures on Exceptional Lie Groups'' (Chicago Lectures in Mathematics), edited by Zafer Mahmud and Mamora Mimura, University of Chicago Press, {{isbn|0-226-00527-5}}.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last1=Knus | first1=Max-Albert | last2=Merkurjev | first2=Alexander | author2-link=Alexander Merkurjev | last3=Rost | first3=Markus | author3-link=Markus Rost | last4=Tignol | first4=Jean-Pierre | title=The book of involutions | others=With a preface by J.

In applications to QCD, the two particles interact by way of four-vector potentials and Lorentz invariant scalar interactions, derived in part from the field theoretic chromomagnetic interactions between the quarks and in part by phenomenological considerations. As with the Breit equation a sixteen-component [[spinor]] Ψ is used.\n\n==Equations==\n\nFor QED, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body [[Dirac equation]] in the presence of an external [[electromagnetic field]], given by the [[4-potential]] <math>A_\\mu</math>. For QCD, each equation has the same structure as the ordinary one-body [[Dirac equation]] in the presence of an external field similar to the electromagnetic field and an additional external field given by in terms of a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] scalar <math>S</math>.

The two-body Dirac equations (TBDE) have the property that if\none of the masses becomes very large, say <math>m_{2}\\rightarrow \\infty</math> then the 16-component Dirac equation reduces to the 4-component one-body [[Dirac equation]] for particle one in an external potential.\n\nIn [[SI units]]:\n\n:<math>[(\\gamma_1)_\\mu (p_1-\\tilde{A}_1)^\\mu+m_1c + \\tilde{S}_1]\\Psi=0,</math>\n:<math>[(\\gamma_2)_\\mu (p_2-\\tilde{A}_2)^\\mu+m_2c + \\tilde{S}_2]\\Psi=0.</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and\n\n:<math>p^\\mu = -i\\hbar{\\partial\\over\\partial x_\\mu} </math>\n\nNatural units will be used below. A tilde symbol is used over the two sets of potentials to indicate that they may have additional gamma matrix dependencies not present in the one-body Dirac equation.  Any coupling constants such as the [[Elementary charge|electron charge]] are embodied in the vector potentials.\n\n==Constraint dynamics and the TBDE==\n\nConstraint dynamics applied to the TBDE requires a particular form of mathematical consistency: the two Dirac operators must [[commutator|commute]] with each other. This is plausible if one views the two equations as two compatible constraints on the wave function. (See the discussion below on constraint dynamics.) If the two operators did not commute, (as, e.g., with the coordinate and momentum operators <math> x,p </math>) then the constraints would not be compatible (one could not e.g., have a wave function that satisfied both <math> x\\Psi=0</math> and <math>p\\Psi=0</math>).  This mathematical consistency or compatibility leads to three important properties of the TBDE. The first is a condition that eliminates the dependence on the relative time in the center of momentum (c.m.) frame defined by <math>P=p_1+p_2=(w,\\vec 0)</math>. (The variable <math>w</math> is the total energy in the c.m. frame.) Stated another way, the relative time is eliminated in a covariant way. In particular, for the two operators to commute, the scalar and four-vector potentials can depend on the relative coordinate <math>x=x_1 - x_2</math> only through its component <math> x_{\\perp }</math> orthogonal to <math>P</math> in which\n\n:<math> x_\\perp^\\mu =(\\eta^{\\mu \\nu }-P^\\mu P^\\nu /P^2)x_\\nu, \\, </math>\n:<math> P_\\mu x_\\perp^\\mu =0. \\, </math>\n\nThis implies that in the c.m. frame <math>x_\\perp =(0,\\vec{x}=\\vec{x}_1 -\\vec{x}_2)</math>, which has zero time component.\n\nSecondly, the mathematical consistency condition also eliminates the relative energy in the [[Center-of-momentum frame|c.m. frame]]. It does this by imposing on each Dirac operator a structure such that in a particular combination they lead to this interaction independent form, eliminating in a covariant way the relative energy.\n\n:<math>P\\cdot p\\Psi =(-P^0p^0+\\vec P\\cdot p)\\Psi=0. \\,</math>\n\nIn this expression <math>p</math> is the relative momentum having the form <math>(p_1 - p_2)/2</math> for equal masses. In the c.m. frame (<math> P^0=w,\\vec P=\\vec 0</math>), the time component <math>p^0</math> of the relative momentum, that is the relative energy, is thus eliminated. in the sense that <math>p^0\\Psi=0</math>.\n\nA third consequence of the mathematical consistency is that each of the world scalar <math>\\tilde{S}_i</math> and four vector <math>\\tilde{A}_{i}^{\\mu }</math> potentials has a term with a fixed dependence on <math>\\gamma _{1}</math> and <math>\\gamma _{2}</math> in addition to the gamma matrix independent forms of <math>S_i</math> and <math>A_i^\\mu</math> which appear in the ordinary one-body Dirac equation for scalar and vector potentials.\nThese extra terms correspond to additional recoil spin-dependence not present in the one-body Dirac equation and vanish when one of the particles becomes very heavy (the so-called static limit).\n\n== More on constraint dynamics: generalized mass shell constraints ==\n\nConstraint dynamics arose from the work of Dirac <ref name=\"Dirac\"/>  and Bergmann.<ref>P. G. Bergmann \" Non-linear field theories\"  Physical Review 75, 680–85  (1949)</ref> This section\nshows how the elimination of relative time and energy takes place in the\nc.m. system for the simple system of two relativistic spinless particles.\nConstraint dynamics was first applied to the classical relativistic two particle system by Todorov,<ref>I.

Sudarshan, Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol 35 350,1032 (1963)</ref>  That theorem states that without fields, one cannot have a relativistic [[Hamiltonian dynamics]]. Thus, the same covariant three-dimensional approach which allows the quantized version of constraint dynamics to remove [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|quantum ghosts]] simultaneously circumvents at the classical level the C.J.S. theorem. Consider a constraint on the otherwise independent coordinate and momentum four vectors, written in the form <math>\\phi _{i}(p,x)\\approx 0</math>.  The symbol<math>\\approx 0</math> is called a weak equality and implies that the constraint is to be imposed only after any needed [[Poisson brackets]] are performed. In the presence of such constraints, the total\n[[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] <math>\\mathcal{H}</math> is obtained from the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] <math> \\mathcal{L}</math> by adding to the [[Legendre Hamiltonian]] <math>(p\\dot{x}-\\mathcal{L})</math> the sum of the constraints times an appropriate set of [[Lagrange multiplier]]s <math>(\\lambda _{i})</math>.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H}=p\\dot{x}-\\mathcal{L}+\\lambda _{i}\\phi _{i}</math>,\n\nThis total Hamiltonian is traditionally called the Dirac Hamiltonian.\nConstraints arise naturally from parameter invariant actions of the form\n\n:<math>I=\\int d\\tau \\mathcal{L(\\tau )=}\\int d\\tau ^{\\prime }\\frac{d\\tau }{d\\tau\n^{\\prime }}\\mathcal{L(\\tau )=}\\int d\\tau ^{\\prime }\\mathcal{L(\\tau }^{\\prime\n}\\mathcal{)}.</math>\n\nIn the case of four vector and Lorentz scalar interactions for a single\nparticle the Lagrangian is\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L(\\tau)}=-(m+S(x))\\sqrt{-\\dot{x}^{2}}+\\dot{x}\\cdot A(x) \\, </math>\n\nThe [[Canonical coordinates|canonical momentum]] is\n\n:<math>p=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\dot{x}}=\\frac{\\mathcal{(}m+S(x))\\dot{x}}{\\sqrt{-\\dot{x}^{2}}}+A(x)</math>\n\nand by squaring leads to the generalized mass shell condition or generalized\nmass shell constraint\n\n:<math> ( p-A)^2 + (m+S)^2 =0. \\,</math>\n\nSince, in this case, the Legendre Hamiltonian vanishes\n\n:<math>p\\cdot \\dot{x}-\\mathcal{L}=0, \\, </math>\n\nthe Dirac Hamiltonian is simply the generalized mass constraint (with no\ninteractions it would simply be the ordinary mass shell constraint)\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H=\\lambda }\\left[ \\left( p-A\\right)^2 + (m+S)^2 \\right] \\equiv \\lambda\n(p^{2}+m^{2}+\\Phi (x,p)). </math>\n\nOne then postulates that for two bodies the Dirac Hamiltonian is the sum of\ntwo such mass shell constraints,\n\n: <math>\\mathcal{H}_i=p_i^2+m_i^2+\\Phi_i (x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)\\approx 0, \\, </math>\n\nthat is\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} =\\lambda_1[p_1^2+m_1^2+\\Phi_1(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] + \\lambda_2[p_2^2 + m_2^2+\\Phi_2(x_1,x_2,p_1,p_2)] </math>\n\n:<math>  =\\lambda_1 \\mathcal{H}_1 + \\lambda_2 \\mathcal{H}_2, \\, </math>\n\nand that each constraint <math>\\mathcal{H}_i</math> be constant in the proper time associated with <math>\\mathcal{H}</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{\\dot{H}}_i=\\{\\mathcal{H}_i,\\mathcal{H\\}\\approx }0 \\, </math>\n\nHere the weak equality means that the [[Poisson bracket]] could result in terms proportional one of the constraints, the classical Poisson brackets for the relativistic two-body system being defined by\n\n:<math> \\{O_1,O_2\\}=\\frac{\\partial O_1}{\\partial x_1^\\mu}\n\\frac{\\partial O_2}{\\partial p_{1\\mu}}\n-\\frac{\\partial O_1}{\\partial p_1^\\mu}\n \\frac{\\partial O_2}{\\partial x_{1\\mu}}\n+\\frac{\\partial O_1}{\\partial x_2^\\mu}\n \\frac{\\partial O_2}{\\partial p_{2\\mu}}\n-\\frac{\\partial O_1}{\\partial p_2^\\mu}\n\\frac{\\partial O_2}{\\partial x_{2\\mu}}.</math>\n\nTo see the consequences of having each constraint be a constant of the\nmotion, take, for example\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{\\dot{H}}_1 = \\{\\mathcal{H}_1,\\mathcal{H\\}=}\\lambda _1 \\{\\mathcal{H}_1, \\mathcal{H}_1\\mathcal{\\}+}\\{\\mathcal{H}_1,\\lambda_1\\mathcal{\\}\n\\mathcal{H}}_2\\mathcal{+\\lambda}_2\\{\\mathcal{H}_2,\\mathcal{H}_1\n\\mathcal{\\}+}\\{\\mathcal{\\lambda }_2,\\mathcal{H}_1\\mathcal{\\}H}_2.</math>\n\nSince <math>\\{\\mathcal{H}_1,\\mathcal{H}_1\\}=0</math> and\n<math>\\mathcal{H}_{1}\\approx 0</math> and <math>\\mathcal{H}_2 \\approx 0</math> one has\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{\\dot{H}}_{1}\\approx \\mathcal{\\lambda }_{2}\\{\\mathcal{H}_{2}, \\mathcal{H}_{1}\\}\\approx 0. \\,</math>\n\nThe simplest solution to this is\n\n:<math>\\Phi _1 =\\Phi _2 \\equiv \\Phi (x_\\perp )</math>\n\nwhich leads to (note the equality in this case is not a weak one in that no constraint need be imposed after the Poisson bracket is worked out)\n\n:<math> \\{\\mathcal{H}_2,\\mathcal{H}_1\\}=0 \\, </math>\n\n(see Todorov,<ref name=\"Todorov\"/> and Wong and Crater <ref>Cheuk-Yin Wong and Horace W.

The classical Poisson brackets are replaced by commutators\n\n:<math>\\{O_1,O_2\\}\\rightarrow \\frac{1}{i}[O_1,O_2]. \\, </math>\n\nThus\n\n:<math> [\\mathcal{H}_2,\\mathcal{H}_{1}]=0, \\, </math>\n\nand we see in this case that the constraint formalism leads to the vanishing commutator of the wave operators for the two particlein.  This is the analogue of the claim stated earlier that the two Dirac operators commute with one another.\n\n==  Covariant elimination of the relative energy ==\n\nThe vanishing of the above commutator ensures that the dynamics is\nindependent of the relative time in the c.m. frame.  In order to\ncovariantly eliminate the relative energy, introduce the relative momentum <math>p\n</math> defined by\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>p_{1} =\\frac{p_{1}\\cdot P}{P^{2}}P+p\\,,</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}} \n{{NumBlk|:|<math>p_{2} =\\frac{p_{2}\\cdot P}{P^{2}}P-p\\,,</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n \nThe above definition of the relative momentum forces the orthogonality of the total\nmomentum and the relative momentum,\n\n:<math>P\\cdot p=0</math>,\n\nwhich follows from taking the scalar product of either equation with <math>P</math>.\nFrom Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}), this relative momentum can be written in terms of \n<math>p_{1}</math> and <math>p_{2}</math> as\n\n:<math>p=\\frac{\\varepsilon _{2}}{\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}p_{1}-\\frac{\\varepsilon _{1}}{\\sqrt{\n-P^{2}}}p_{2} </math>\n\nwhere \n \n:<math>\\varepsilon _{1} =-\\frac{p_{1}\\cdot P}{\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\\frac{\nP^{2}+p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}^{2}}{2\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}</math>\n:<math>\\varepsilon _{2} =-\\frac{p_{2}\\cdot P}{\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}=-\\frac{\nP^{2}+p_{2}^{2}-p_{1}^{2}}{2\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}</math>\n \nare the projections of the momenta <math>p_{1}</math> and <math>p_{2}</math> along the direction\nof the total momentum <math>P</math>. Subtracting the two constraints <math>\\mathcal{H}\n_{1}\\Psi =0</math> and <math>\\mathcal{H}_{2}\\Psi =0</math>, gives\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(p_{1}^{2}-p_{2}^{2})\\Psi =-(m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})\\Psi</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\nThus on these states <math>\\Psi </math> \n \n:<math>\\varepsilon _{1}\\Psi  =\\frac{-P^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}\n\\Psi</math>\n:<math>\\varepsilon _{2}\\Psi  =\\frac{-P^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2\\sqrt{-P^{2}}}\n\\Psi</math> .\n\nThe equation <math>\\mathcal{H}\\Psi =0</math> describes both the c.m. motion and the\ninternal relative motion. To characterize the former motion, observe that\nsince the potential <math>\\Phi </math> depends only on the difference of the two\ncoordinates\n\n:<math>[P,\\mathcal{H}]\\Psi =0</math>.\n\n(This does not require that <math>[P,\\lambda _{i}]=0</math> since the <math>\\mathcal{H}\n_{i}\\Psi =0</math>.) Thus, the total momentum <math>P</math> is a constant of motion and \n<math>\\Psi </math> is an eigenstate state characterized by a total momentum \n<math>P^{\\prime }</math>. In the c.m. system <math>P^{\\prime }=(w,\\vec{0}),</math> with <math>w</math> the\ninvariant center of momentum (c.m.) energy. Thus\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>(P^{2}+w^{2})\\Psi =0\\,,</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nand so <math>\\Psi </math> is also an eigenstate of  c.m. energy operators for each of\nthe two particles, \n \n:<math>\\varepsilon _{1}\\Psi  =\\frac{w^{2}+m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}}{2w}\\Psi</math>\n:<math>\\varepsilon _{2}\\Psi  =\\frac{w^{2}+m_{2}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}}{2w}\\Psi</math>.\n \nThe relative momentum then satisfies\n\n:<math>p\\Psi =\\frac{\\varepsilon _{2}p_{1}-\\varepsilon _{1}p_{2}}{w}\\Psi</math>,\n\nso that\n\n:<math>p_{1}\\Psi  =\\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon _{1}}{w}P+p\\right) \\Psi </math>,\n:<math>p_{2}\\Psi  =\\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon _{2}}{w}P-p\\right) \\Psi </math> ,\n\nThe above set of equations follow from the constraints <math>\\mathcal{H}_{i}\\Psi\n=0</math> and the definition of the relative momenta given in Eqs.({{EquationNote|1}}) and ({{EquationNote|2}}).\nIf instead one chooses to define (for a more general choice see Horwitz),\n<ref>L.

This conforms with the earlier claim on the\nvanishing of the relative energy in the c.m. frame made in conjunction with\nthe TBDE.\\ In the second choice the c.m. value of the relative energy is\nnot defined as zero but comes from the original generalized mass shell\nconstraints.

Because of the connection between the potentials used in the TBDE and the corresponding quantum field theory, any radiative correction to the lowest order interaction can be incorporated into those potentials.  To see how this comes about, consider by contrast how one computes scattering amplitudes without quantum field theory.  With no quantum field theory one must come upon potentials by classical arguments or phenomenological considerations.

In a long series \"On quaternions, or on a new system of imaginaries in algebra\" beginning in 1844 in [[Philosophical Magazine]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]] communicated a system multiplying according to the [[quaternion group]].  In 1848 [[Thomas Kirkman]] reported<ref>[[Thomas Kirkman]] (1848) \"On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of ''n'' Squares\", [[London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine]] 1848, p 447 [http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kolJAAAAYAAJ  Google books link]</ref> on his correspondence with [[Arthur Cayley]] regarding equations on the units determining a system of hypercomplex numbers.\n\n===Tessarines===\nIn 1848 [[James Cockle (lawyer)|James Cockle]] introduced the '''tessarines''' in a series of articles in ''Philosophical Magazine''.<ref>[[James Cockle]] in London-Dublin-Edinburgh [[Philosophical Magazine]], series 3\n* 1848 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20157#page/449/mode/1up On Certain Functions Resembling Quaternions and on a New Imaginary in Algebra], 33:435–9.\n* 1849 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20121#page/51/mode/1up On a New Imaginary in Algebra] 34:37–47.\n* 1849 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20121#page/420/mode/1up On the Symbols of Algebra and on the Theory of Tessarines] 34:406–10.\n* 1850 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20083#page/305/mode/1up On the True Amplitude of a Tessarine] 36:290-2.\n* 1850 [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/120166#page/295/mode/1up On Impossible Equations, on Impossible Quantities and on Tessarines] 37:281–3.\nLinks from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]].</ref>\n\nA '''tessarine''' is a hypercomplex number of the form\n\n:<math>t = w + x i + y j + z k, \\quad w, x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>\n\nwhere <math> i j = j i = k, \\quad i^2 = -1, \\quad j^2 = +1 .</math>\nCockle used tessarines to isolate the hyperbolic cosine series and the hyperbolic sine series in the exponential series.

(see especially pages 455–67)</ref> '''bicomplex numbers''' in ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'', which form an algebra isomorphic to the tessarines.\n\nCorrado Segre read [[W. R. Hamilton]]'s ''Lectures on Quaternions'' (1853) and the works of [[W. K. Clifford]]. Segre used some of Hamilton's notation to develop his system of '''bicomplex numbers''': Let ''h'' and ''i'' be elements that square to −1 and that commute. Then, presuming [[associativity]] of multiplication, the product ''hi'' must square to +1. The algebra constructed on the basis {{nowrap|{ 1, ''h'', ''i'', ''hi'' }<nowiki/>}} is then the same as James Cockle's tessarines, represented using a different basis. Segre noted that elements\n:<math> g = (1 - hi)/2, \\quad g' = (1 + hi)/2 </math> &nbsp; are [[idempotent]]s.\nWhen bicomplex numbers are expressed in terms of the basis {{nowrap|{ 1, ''h'', ''i'', −''hi'' }<nowiki/>}}, their equivalence with tessarines is apparent. Looking at the linear representation of these [[ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] algebras shows agreement in the fourth dimension when the negative sign is used; consider the sample product given above under linear representation.\n\nThe [[University of Kansas]] has contributed to the development of bicomplex analysis. In 1953, Ph.D. student James D. Riley's thesis \"Contributions to the theory of functions of a bicomplex variable\" was published in the [[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] (2nd Ser., 5:132–165). In 1991 [[G. Baley Price]] published a book<ref>[[G. Baley Price]] (1991) ''An Introduction to Multicomplex Spaces and Functions'', [[Marcel Dekker]] {{ISBN|0-8247-8345-X}}</ref> on bicomplex numbers, [[multicomplex number]]s, and their function theory. Professor Price also gives some history of the subject in the preface to his book. Another book developing bicomplex numbers and their applications is by Catoni, Bocaletti, Cannata, Nichelatti & Zampetti (2008).<ref>F. Catoni, D. Boccaletti, R. Cannata, V. Catoni, E. Nichelatti, P. Zampetti. (2008) ''The Mathematics of Minkowski Space-Time with an Introduction to Commutative Hypercomplex Numbers'', [[Birkhäuser Verlag]], Basel {{ISBN|978-3-7643-8613-9}}</ref>\n\n==Quotient rings of polynomials==\nOne comparison of bicomplex numbers and tessarines uses the [[polynomial ring]] '''R'''[''X'',''Y''], where {{nowrap|1=''XY'' = ''YX''}}. The [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] <math>A = (X^2 + 1,\\ Y^2 - 1)</math> then provides a [[quotient ring]] representing tessarines. In this quotient ring approach, elements of the tessarines correspond to [[coset]]s with respect to the ideal ''A''. Similarly, the ideal <math> B = (X^2 + 1,\\ Y^2 + 1 )</math> produces a quotient representing bicomplex numbers.\n\nA generalization of this approach uses the [[free algebra]] {{nowrap|'''R'''⟨''X'',''Y''⟩}} in two ''non-commuting'' indeterminates ''X'' and ''Y''. Consider these three second degree [[polynomial]]s <math>X^2 + 1,\\ Y^2 - 1,\\ XY - YX</math>. Let ''A'' be the ideal generated by them. Then the quotient ring {{nowrap|'''R'''⟨''X'',''Y''⟩/''A''}} is isomorphic to the ring of tessarines.\n\nTo see that <math>(XY)^2 + 1 \\in A</math> &nbsp;note that\n\n:<math>X Y^2 X = X(Y^2 - 1) X + (X^2 + 1) - 1 ,</math> so that \n:<math>X Y^2 X + 1 = X(Y^2 - 1)X + (X^2 + 1) \\in A .</math> But then\n:<math> XY(XY - YX) + X Y^2 X + 1 \\in A .</math> as required.\n\nNow consider the alternative ideal ''B'' generated by <math>X^2 + 1,\\ Y^2 + 1,\\ XY - YX</math>.\nIn this case one can prove <math>(XY)^2 - 1 \\in B</math>. The [[ring isomorphism]] {{nowrap|'''R'''⟨''X'',''Y''⟩/''A'' ≅ '''R'''⟨''X'',''Y''⟩/''B''}} involves a [[change of basis]] exchanging <math>Y \\leftrightarrow XY</math>.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the field '''C''' of ordinary complex numbers is presumed given, and '''C'''[''X''] is the ring of polynomials in ''X'' with complex coefficients. Then the quotient {{nowrap|'''C'''[''X'']/(''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}} is another presentation of bicomplex numbers.\n\n==Polynomial roots==\nWrite {{nowrap|1=<sup>2</sup>'''C''' = '''C''' ⊕ '''C'''}} and represent elements of it by ordered pairs (''u'',''v'') of complex numbers. Since the algebra of tessarines '''T''' is isomorphic to <sup>2</sup>'''C''', the [[ring of polynomials|rings of polynomials]] '''T'''[X] and <sup>2</sup>'''C'''[''X''] are also isomorphic, however polynomials in the latter algebra split:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k=1}^n (a_k , b_k ) (u , v)^k \\quad = \\quad \\left({\\sum_{k=1}^n a_i u^k} ,\\quad  \\sum_{k=1}^n b_k v^k \\right).</math>\n\nIn consequence, when a polynomial equation <math>f(u,v) = (0,0)</math> in this algebra is set, it reduces to two polynomial equations on '''C'''. If the degree is ''n'', then there are ''n'' [[root of a function|roots]] for each equation: <math>u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n,\\ v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n .</math>\nAny ordered pair <math>( u_i , v_j ) \\!</math> from this set of roots will satisfy the original equation in <sup>2</sup>'''C'''[''X''], so it has ''n''<sup>2</sup> roots.\n\nDue to the isomorphism with '''T'''[''X''], there is a correspondence of polynomials and a correspondence of their roots. Hence the tessarine polynomials of degree ''n'' also have ''n''<sup>2</sup> roots, counting [[multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity of roots]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Number systems}}\n\n[[Category:Composition algebras]]\n[[Category:Hypercomplex numbers]]\n[[Category:Matrices]]"

For example, the equation\n:<math>(x+1)^2 = -9</math>\nhas no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to [[field extension|extend]] the real numbers with an [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] {{math|''i''}} (sometimes called the [[imaginary unit]]) that is taken to satisfy the relation {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}, so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found.

Furthermore, complex numbers can also be divided by nonzero complex numbers. Overall, the complex number system is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\nThe geometric identification of the complex numbers with the complex plane, which is a [[Euclidean plane]] (<math>\\mathbb R^2</math>), makes their structure as a real 2-dimensional [[vector space]] evident. Real and imaginary parts of a complex number may be taken as components of a vector with respect to the canonical [[standard basis]]. The addition of complex numbers is thus immediately depicted as the usual component-wise addition of vectors. However, the complex numbers allow for a richer algebraic structure, comprising additional operations, that are not necessarily available in a vector space; e.g., the multiplication of two complex numbers always yields again a complex number, and should not be mistaken for the usual \"products\" involving vectors, like the ''[[scalar multiplication]]'', the ''[[scalar product]]'' or other (sesqui)linear [[bilinear form|forms]], available in many vector spaces; and the broadly exploited ''[[vector product]]'' exists only in an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-dependent form in three dimensions.\n\n==Definition==\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]]. The real part of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is {{mvar|x}}, and its imaginary part is {{mvar|y}}.]]\n\nBased on the concept of [[real number]]s, a complex number is a number of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers and {{math|''i''}} is an indeterminate satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}. For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra |last=Axler |first=Sheldon |page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThis way, a complex number is defined as a [[polynomial]] with real coefficients in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, for which the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} is imposed. Based on this definition, complex numbers can be added and multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials. The relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} induces the equalities {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''</sup> {{=}} 1 , ''i''<sup>4''k''+1</sup> {{=}} ''i'' , ''i''<sup>4''k''+2</sup> {{=}} −1 ,}} and {{math|''i''<sup>4''k''+3</sup> {{=}} −i ,}} which hold for all integers {{mvar|k;}} these allow the reduction of any polynomial that results from the addition and multiplication of complex numbers to a linear polynomial in {{mvar|i}}, again of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}} with real coefficients {{mvar|a, b.}}\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called its ''imaginary part''.

As with polynomials, it is common to write {{mvar|a}} for {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} and {{math|''bi''}} for {{math|0 + ''bi''}}. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, i.e., {{math|''b'' {{=}} −''{{!}}b{{!}}'' < 0,}} it is common to write {{math|''a'' − ''{{!}}b{{!}}i''}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (−''{{!}}b{{!}}'')''i''}}; for example, for {{math|''b'' {{=}} −4,}} {{math|3 − 4''i''}} can be written instead of {{math|3 + (−4)''i''.}}\n\nSince in polynomials with real coefficients the multiplication of the indeterminate {{math|''i''}} and a real is commutative, the polynomial {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} may be written as {{math|''a'' + ''ib''.}} This is often expedient for imaginary parts denoted by expressions, e.g., when {{mvar|b}} is a radical.<ref>See {{harv|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref>\n\nThe real part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Re(''z'')}} or {{math|ℜ(''z'')}}; the imaginary part of a complex number {{mvar|z}} is denoted by {{math|Im(''z'')}} or {{math|ℑ(''z'')}}.

Another prominent space on which the coordinates may be projected is the two-dimensional surface of a sphere, which is then called [[Riemann sphere]].\n\n=== Cartesian complex plane ===\nThe definition of the complex numbers involving two arbitrary real values immediately suggest the use of Cartesian coordinates in the complex plane. The horizontal (''real'') axis is generally used to display the real part with increasing values to the right and the imaginary part marks the vertical (''imaginary'') axis, increasing values upwards.\n\nA charted number may be either viewed as the coordinatized point, or as a [[Vector (geometric)|position vector]] from the origin to this point. The coordinate values of a complex number {{mvar|z}} are said to give its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic'' form.\n\nNotably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector addition]], while multiplication (see [[#Multiplication and division in polar form|below]]) corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding the angles they make with the real axis. Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to rotating the position vector [[orientation (geometry)|counterclockwise]] by a quarter [[turn (geometry)|turn]] ([[right angle|90°]]) about the origin\n: <math>(a + bi)\\cdot i = ai + b(i)^2 = -b + ai .</math>\n\n=== Polar complex plane {{anchor|Polar form}}=== <!-- [[Nth root]] links to this section -->\n{{Main|Polar coordinate system}}\n{{Redirect|Polar form|the higher-dimensional analogue|Polar decomposition}}\n[[File:Complex number illustration modarg.svg|right|thumb|Argument {{mvar|φ}} and modulus {{mvar|r}} locate a point in the complex plane.]]\n\n====Modulus and argument====\nAn alternative option for coordinates in the complex plane is the [[polar coordinate system]] that uses the distance of the point {{mvar|z}} from the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] (''O''), and the angle subtended between the [[positive real axis]] and the line segment ''Oz'' in a counterclockwise sense. This leads to the polar form of complex numbers.\n\nThe ''[[absolute value]]'' (or ''modulus'' or ''magnitude'') of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} is<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 18.</ref>\n:<math>r=|z|=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}.</math>\nIf {{mvar|z}} is a real number (that is, if {{math|1=''y'' = 0}}), then {{math|1=''r'' = {{!}}''x''{{!}}}}. That is, the absolute value of a real number equals its absolute value as a complex number.\n\nBy [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the absolute value of complex number is the distance to the origin of the point representing the complex number in the [[complex plane]].\n\nThe ''[[arg (mathematics)|argument]]'' of {{mvar|z}} (in many applications referred to as the \"phase\" {{mvar|φ}}) is the angle of the [[radius]] ''Oz'' with the positive real axis, and is written as <math>\\arg(z)</math>.

Values in the range {{closed-open|0, 2π}} are obtained by adding {{math|2π}} if the value is negative. The value of {{mvar|φ}} is expressed in [[radian]]s in this article. It can increase by any integer multiple of {{math|2π}} and still give the same angle, viewed as subtended by the rays of the positive real axis and from the origin through ''z''. Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as [[Multivalued function|multivalued]].   The polar angle for the complex number 0 is indeterminate, but arbitrary choice of the angle&nbsp;0 is common.\n\nThe value of {{mvar|φ}} equals the result of [[atan2]]:\n:<math>\\varphi = \\operatorname{atan2}\\left(\\operatorname{Im}(z),\\operatorname{Re}(z) \\right).</math>\n\nTogether, {{mvar|r}} and {{mvar|φ}} give another way of representing complex numbers, the ''polar form'', as the combination of modulus and argument fully specify the position of a point on the plane.

Because each complex number is represented in two dimensions, visually graphing a complex function would require the perception of a [[four dimensional space]], which is possible only in projections. Because of this, other ways of visualizing complex functions have been designed.\n\nIn [[Domain coloring]] the output dimensions are represented by color and brightness, respectively. Each point in the complex plane as domain is ''ornated'', typically with ''color'' representing the argument of the complex number, and ''brightness'' representing the magnitude. Dark spots mark moduli near zero, brighter spots are farther away from the origin, the gradation may be discontinuous, but is assumed as monotonous. The colors often vary in steps of {{sfrac|{{pi}}|3}} for {{math|0}} to {{math|2{{pi}}}} from red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, to magenta. These plots are called [[Domain coloring|color wheel graphs]]. This provides a simple way to visualize the functions without losing information. The picture shows zeros for {{math|±1, (2+i)}} and poles at {{math|±{{radic|−2−2i}}.}}\n\n[[Riemann surface]]s are another way to visualize complex functions.{{explain|date=December 2018}} Riemann surfaces can be thought of as [[Deformation theory|deformations]] of the complex plane; while the horizontal axes represent the real and imaginary inputs, the single vertical axis only represents either the real or imaginary output. However, Riemann surfaces are built in such a way that rotating them 180 degrees shows the imaginary output, and vice versa. Unlike domain coloring, Riemann surfaces can represent [[multivalued function]]s like <math>\\sqrt{z}</math>.\n\n==History==\nThe solution in radicals (without [[trigonometric functions]]) of a general cubic equation contains the square roots of [[negative numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (the so-called [[casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|first=Morris |last= Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial]] equation of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any [[polynomial]] equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the full development of complex numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and root extraction of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician [[Rafael Bombelli]].<ref>{{Citation |last1=Katz |first1=Victor J. |title=A History of Mathematics, Brief Version |section= 9.1.4 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-321-16193-2 |year=2004}}</ref> A more abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].\n\nThe earliest fleeting reference to [[square root]]s of [[negative number]]s can perhaps be said to occur in the work of the [[Hellenistic mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]], where in his ''[[Hero of Alexandria#Bibliography|Stereometrica]]'' he considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term <math>\\sqrt{81 - 144} = 3i\\sqrt{7}</math> in his calculations, although negative quantities were not conceived of in [[Hellenistic mathematics]] and Hero merely replaced it by its positive (<math>\\sqrt{144 - 81} = 3\\sqrt{7}</math>).<ref>{{Citation |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of {{sqrt|−1}} |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |year=2007 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12798-9 |url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe impetus to study complex numbers as a topic in itself first arose in the 16th century when [[algebraic solution]]s for the roots of [[Cubic equation|cubic]] and [[Quartic equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]]s were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>x^3 = px + q</math>{{refn|group=\"note\"|In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively.

However formal calculations with complex numbers show that the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>3</sup> = ''i''}} has solutions {{math|−''i''}}, <math>{\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math> and <math>{\\tfrac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\tfrac{1}{2}}i</math>. Substituting these in turn for <math>{\\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}</math> in Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and −1 as the solutions of {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> − ''x'' = 0}}. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later mathematicians showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[René Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La Géométrie &#124; The Geometry of René Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=René |authorlink=René Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=978-0-486-60068-0 |page= |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26400 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c'est-à-dire que l'on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque équation, mais qu'il n'y a quelquefois aucune quantité qui corresponde à celle qu'on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity <math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\tfrac{1}{a}}</math>) in the case when both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|−1}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of −1\". It was not until 1831 that he overcame these doubts and published his treatise on complex numbers as points in the plane, largely establishing modern notation and terminology. In the beginning of the 19th century, other mathematicians discovered independently the geometrical representation of the complex numbers: Buée, [[C. V.

Argand called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''direction factor'', and <math>r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math> the ''modulus''; Cauchy (1828) called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''reduced form'' (l'expression réduite) and apparently introduced the term ''argument''; Gauss used {{math|''i''}} for <math>\\sqrt{-1}</math>, introduced the term ''complex number'' for {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}, and called {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>}} the ''norm''. The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto Hölder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Relations and operations==\n===Equality===\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[iff|if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal.

If the complex numbers are written in polar form, they are equal if and only if they have the same argument and the same magnitude.\n\n===Ordering===\nSince complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a two-dimensional plane, there is no natural [[linear ordering]] on the set of complex numbers. In fact, there is no [[linear ordering]] on the complex numbers that is compatible with addition and multiplication – the complex numbers cannot have the structure of an [[ordered field]].

This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line.

For example, multiplying by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to a quarter-[[turn (geometry)|turn]] counter-clockwise, which gives back {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}. The picture at the right illustrates the multiplication of\n:<math>(2+i)(3+i)=5+5i. </math>\nSince the real and imaginary part of {{math|5 + 5''i''}} are equal, the argument of that number is 45 degrees, or π/4 (in [[radian]]). On the other hand, it is also the sum of the angles at the origin of the red and blue triangles are [[arctan]](1/3) and arctan(1/2), respectively. Thus, the formula\n:<math>\\frac{\\pi}{4} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) </math>\nholds. As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this – known as [[Machin-like formulas]] – are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi|π]].\n\nSimilarly, division is given by\n:<math>\\frac{z_1}{z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{r_2} \\left(\\cos(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2)\\right).</math>\n\n===Square root===\n{{see also|Square root#Square roots of negative and complex numbers|l1=Square roots of negative and complex numbers}}\nThe square roots of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} (with {{math|''b'' ≠ 0}}) are <math> \\pm (\\gamma + \\delta i)</math>, where\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\sgn (b) \\sqrt{\\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},</math>\n\nwhere sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function.

Here {{radic|''r''|''n''}} is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}. While the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}}, there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root of {{mvar|z}} is considered as a [[multivalued function]] (in {{mvar|z}}), as opposed to a usual function {{mvar|f}}, for which {{math|''f''(''z'')}} is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as\n:<math>\\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z</math>\n(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex numbers.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15–16.</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|−''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = −1}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, page 25.</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].\n\n===Solutions of polynomial equations===\nGiven any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, the equation\n:<math>a_n z^n + \\dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0</math>\nhas at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is nonzero.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]'', of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> − 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1 ≠ 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 978-3-540-60741-0\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1–37\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' − ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' − ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' ↦ ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'', ''p'') = { ''y'' {{!}} ''p'' − (''y'' − ''x'')(''y'' − ''x'')* ∈ ''P'' } }} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bourbaki |first=Nicolas |author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\n[[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced the approach to define the set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|first=Leo |last=Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215–16}}</ref> as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of {{nowrap|[[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}}}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>See {{harv|Apostol|1981}}, pages 15–16.</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0</math>,\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourbaki|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|−1}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|−''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} −1}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2 × 2}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]]. See the article on [[2 × 2 real matrices]] for other representations of complex numbers.\n\n==Complex analysis==\n[[File:Sin1perz.png|thumb|270px|[[Domain coloring|Color wheel graph]] of {{math|sin(1/''z'')}}.

These imply that {{math|1={{!}}1{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}''z''/''w''{{!}} = {{!}}''z''{{!}}/{{!}}''w''{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'', ''w'') = {{!}}''z'' − ''w''{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'', ''w'') = {{!}}''z'' − ''w''{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' ≥ 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''φ'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' ≠ 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}} – called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}} – satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w) = \\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''π'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|−π, π}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''ω''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''ω'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when naïvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = \\left(a^b\\right)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' → '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' → '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' − ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have applications in many scientific areas, including [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some of these applications are described below.\n\n===Geometry===\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n:<math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>{{citation|last=Lester|first=J.A.|title=Triangles I: Shapes|journal=[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]|volume=52|pages=30–54|year=1994|doi=10.1007/BF01818325}}</ref>\n\n====Fractal geometry====\n[[File:Mandelset hires.png|right|250px|thumb|the mandelbrot set with the real and imaginary axes labeled.]]\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is a popular example of a fractal formed on the complex plane. It is defined by plotting every location <math>c</math> where iterating the sequence <math>f_c(z)=z^2+c</math> does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] infinitely. Similarly, [[Julia set]]s have the same rules, except where <math>c</math> remains constant.\n\n====Triangles====\nEvery triangle has a unique [[Steiner inellipse]] – an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1|journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]]|volume=115|issue=4|pages=330–38|year=2008a|doi=10.1080/00029890.2008.11920532|issn=0002-9890}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Kalman|first1=Dan|title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics|url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663|journal=[[Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]]|year=2008b}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s – they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] – a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|ζ(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n=== In applied mathematics ===\n\n====Control theory====\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, i.e. have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n\n* in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n* all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n* on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\n\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n====Signal analysis====\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere ω represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\cos((\\omega + \\alpha)t) + \\cos\\left((\\omega - \\alpha)t\\right)\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega + \\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega - \\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\left(e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t}\\right) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n    & = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===In physics===\n\n====Electromagnetism and electrical engineering====\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos\\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>{{citation|last1=Grant|first1=I.S.|title=Electromagnetism|year=2008|edition=2|publisher=Manchester Physics Series|isbn=978-0-471-92712-9|last2=Phillips|first2=W.R.}}</ref>\n\n====Fluid dynamics====\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n====Quantum mechanics====\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics – the [[Schrödinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]] – make use of complex numbers.\n\n====Relativity====\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, i.e.: {{math|''x''·''y'' ≠ ''y''·''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'', ''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''·''y'')·''z'' ≠ ''x''·(''y''·''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley–Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley–Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1, ''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2 × 2}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1, ''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\ni.e., the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 × 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = −''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> − 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metrics]] on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it. The completion <math>\\mathbf{C}_p</math> of <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> turns out to be algebraically closed. This field is called ''p''-adic complex numbers by analogy.\n\nThe fields '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> and their finite field extensions, including '''C''', are [[local field]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Complex numbers}}\n* [[Algebraic surface]]\n* [[Circular motion#Using complex numbers|Circular motion using complex numbers]]\n* [[Complex-base system]]\n* [[Complex geometry]]\n* [[Eisenstein integer]]\n* [[Euler's identity]]\n* [[Geometric algebra#Unit pseudoscalars|Geometric algebra]] (which includes the complex plane as the 2-dimensional [[Spinor#Two dimensions|spinor]] subspace <math>\\mathcal{G}_2^+</math>)\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Unit complex number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n====Works cited====\n* {{Citation |last=Ahlfors |first=Lars |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1979 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-000657-7}}\n* {{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|last=Apostol |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Apostol|year=1981|publisher=Addison-Wesley |ref={{harvid|Apostol|1981}} }}\n* {{springer|id=c/c024140|title=Complex number|year=2001|first=E.D.|last=Solomentsev}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikiversity|Complex Numbers}}\n{{wikibooks|Calculus/Complex numbers}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Number/Complex Numbers}}\n* {{citation |last= Penrose |first= Roger |author-link= Roger Penrose |title=The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe |publisher= Alfred A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''octonions''' are a [[normed division algebra]] over the [[real number]]s, meaning it is a [[Hypercomplex number|hypercomplex]] [[Number#Classification|number system]]; Octonions are usually represented by the capital letter O, using boldface '''O''' or [[blackboard bold]] <math>\\mathbb O</math>. Octonions have eight dimensions; twice the number of dimensions of the [[quaternions]], of which they are an extension. They are [[commutative property|noncommutative]] and [[associative property|nonassociative]], but satisfy a weaker form of associativity; namely, they are [[alternative algebra|alternative]]. They are also [[Power associativity|power associative]].\n\nOctonions are not as well known as the quaternions and complex numbers, which are much more widely studied and used. Octonions are related to exceptional structures in mathematics, among them the [[Simple Lie group#Exceptional cases|exceptional Lie group]]s. Octonions have applications in fields such as [[string theory]], [[special relativity]] and [[quantum logic]]. Applying the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] to the octonions produces the [[sedenion]]s.\n\n== History ==\nThe octonions were discovered in 1843 by [[John T. Graves]], inspired by his friend [[W. R. Hamilton]]'s discovery of quaternions. Graves called his discovery octaves, and mentioned them in a letter to Hamilton dated 16 December 1843. He first published his result  slightly later than [[Arthur Cayley]]'s article.<ref>{{harv|Graves|1845}}</ref> The octonions were discovered independently by Cayley<ref>{{Citation|first=Arthur |last=Cayley|title= On Jacobi's elliptic functions, in reply to the Rev..; and on quaternions|journal= [[Philosophical Magazine]] |volume=26 |year=1845|pages=208–211|doi=10.1080/14786444508645107}}. Appendix reprinted in ''The Collected Mathematical Papers'', Johnson Reprint Co., New York, 1963, p.&nbsp;127</ref> and are sometimes referred to as Cayley numbers or the Cayley algebra. Hamilton described the early history of Graves' discovery.<ref>{{citation|last=Hamilton |authorlink=William Rowan Hamilton|journal=Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy|volume= 21 |year=1848|pages= 338–341|title=Note, by Sir W. R. Hamilton, respecting the researches of John T. Graves, Esq.|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro21iris}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe octonions can be thought of as octets (or 8-tuples) of real numbers. Every octonion is a real [[linear combination]] of the '''unit octonions''':\n\n:<math>\\{e_0, e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, e_7\\},</math>\n\nwhere ''e''<sub>0</sub> is the scalar or real element; it may be identified with the real number 1. That is, every octonion ''x'' can be written in the form\n:<math>x = x_0e_0 + x_1e_1 + x_2e_2 + x_3e_3 + x_4e_4 + x_5e_5 + x_6e_6 + x_7e_7,\\,</math>\nwith real coefficients {''x''<sub>''i''</sub>}.\n\nAddition and subtraction of octonions is done by adding and subtracting corresponding terms and hence their coefficients, like quaternions. Multiplication is more complex. Multiplication is [[Distributive property|distributive]] over addition, so the product of two octonions can be calculated by summing the products of all the terms, again like quaternions. The product of each pair of terms can be given by multiplication of the coefficients and a [[multiplication table]] of the unit octonions, like this one (due to Cayley, 1845, and Graves, 1843):<ref name=GSSV>{{Citation |title=Hypercomplex analysis |edition=Conference on quaternionic and Clifford analysis; proceedings |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H-5v6pPpyb4C&pg=PA168 |page=168 |author=G Gentili, C Stoppato, DC Struppa and F Vlacci |chapter=Recent developments for regular functions of a hypercomplex variable|editor1=Irene Sabadini |editor2=M Shapiro |editor3=F Sommen |isbn=978-3-7643-9892-7 |year=2009 |publisher=Birkhäuser}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|-\n  |\n  |\n  |colspan=\"8\" |<math>e_j</math>\n|-\n  | | \n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_ie_j</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_0</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_1</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_2</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_3</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_4</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_5</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_6</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  | rowspan=\"8\" |<math>e_i</math>\n  !<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_4</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>e_2</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_5</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n  |<math>-e_1</math>\n|-\n  !<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>e_7</math>\n  |<math>-e_6</math>\n  |<math>e_5</math>\n  |<math>e_4</math>\n  |<math>-e_3</math>\n  |<math>-e_2</math>\n  |<math>e_1</math>\n  |<math>-e_0</math>\n|-\n|}\n\nMost off-diagonal elements of the table are antisymmetric, making it almost a [[skew-symmetric matrix]] except for the elements on the main diagonal, as well as the row and column for which {{math|''e''<sub>0</sub>}} is an operand.\n\nThe table can be summarized as follows:<ref name= Shestakov>\n\n{{Citation |title=Non-associative algebra and its applications |author1=Lev Vasilʹevitch Sabinin |author2=Larissa Sbitneva |author3=I.

The others can be obtained by permuting and changing the signs of the non-scalar basis elements. The 480 different algebras are isomorphic, and there is rarely a need to consider which particular multiplication rule is used. Each of these 480 definitions is invariant up to signs under some 7-cycle of the points (1234567), and for each 7-cycle there are four definitions, differing by signs and reversal of order. A common choice is to use the definition invariant under the 7-cycle (1234567) with {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub> = ''e''<sub>4</sub>}} as it is particularly easy to remember the multiplication.\n\nA variation of this sometimes used is to label the elements of the basis by the elements ∞, 0, 1, 2, ..., 6, of the [[projective line]] over the finite field of order 7. The multiplication is then given by {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>∞</sub> = 1}} and {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub> = ''e''<sub>4</sub>}}, and all expressions obtained from this by adding a constant (mod 7) to all subscripts: in other words using the 7 triples (124) (235) (346) (450) (561) (602) (013). These are the nonzero codewords of the [[quadratic residue code]] of length 7 over the [[Finite field|Galois field]] of two elements, [[GF(2)|''GF''(2)]]. There is a symmetry of order 7 given by adding a constant mod 7 to all subscripts, and also a symmetry of order 3 given by multiplying all subscripts by one of the quadratic residues 1, 2, 4 mod 7.<ref name=Parra>\n\n{{Citation |title=Clifford algebras with numeric and symbolic computations |author1=Rafał Abłamowicz |author2=Pertti Lounesto |author3=Josep M.

Just as quaternions can be defined as pairs of complex numbers, the octonions can be defined as pairs of quaternions. Addition is defined pairwise. The product of two pairs of quaternions {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}} and {{nowrap|(''c'', ''d'')}} is defined by\n:<math>(a,b)(c,d)=(ac-d^{*}b,da+bc^{*}),</math>\nwhere <math>z^{*}</math> denotes the [[Quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocal|conjugate of the quaternion]] ''z''.

The lines are directional. The seven points correspond to the seven standard basis elements of Im('''O''') (see definition [[#Conjugate, norm, and inverse|below]]). Each pair of distinct points lies on a unique line and each line runs through exactly three points.\n\nLet {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be an ordered triple of points lying on a given line with the order specified by the direction of the arrow. Then multiplication is given by\n\n:''ab'' = ''c'' and ''ba'' = −''c''\n\ntogether with [[cyclic permutation]]s. These rules together with\n\n*1 is the multiplicative identity,\n*''e''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> = −1 for each point in the diagram\n\ncompletely defines the multiplicative structure of the octonions. Each of the seven lines generates a subalgebra of '''O''' isomorphic to the quaternions '''H'''.\n\n===Conjugate, norm, and inverse===\nThe ''conjugate'' of an octonion\n\n:<math>x = x_0\\,e_0 + x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7</math>\n\nis given by\n\n:<math>x^* = x_0\\,e_0 - x_1\\,e_1 - x_2\\,e_2 - x_3\\,e_3 - x_4\\,e_4 - x_5\\,e_5 - x_6\\,e_6 - x_7\\,e_7.</math>\nConjugation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] of '''O''' and satisfies {{nowrap|1=''(xy)''<sup>∗</sup> = ''y''<sup>∗</sup> ''x''<sup>∗</sup>}} (note the change in order).\n\nThe ''real part'' of ''x'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x + x^*}{2} = x_0\\,e_0</math>\n\nand the ''imaginary part'' by\n\n:<math>\\frac{x - x^*}{2} = x_1\\,e_1 + x_2\\,e_2 + x_3\\,e_3 + x_4\\,e_4 + x_5\\,e_5 + x_6\\,e_6 + x_7\\,e_7.</math>\n\nThe set of all purely imaginary octonions span a 7 dimension subspace of '''O''', denoted Im('''O''').\n\nConjugation of octonions satisfies the equation\n\n:<math>x^* =-\\frac{1}{6} (x+(e_1x)e_1+(e_2x)e_2+(e_3x)e_3+(e_4x)e_4+(e_5x)e_5+(e_6x)e_6+(e_7x)e_7).</math>\n\nThe product of an octonion with its conjugate, {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>∗</sup> ''x'' = ''x'' ''x''<sup>∗</sup>}}, is always a nonnegative real number:\n\n:<math>x^*x = x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 + x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2.</math>\n\nUsing this the norm of an octonion can be defined, as\n\n:<math>\\|x\\| = \\sqrt{x^*x}.</math>\n\nThis norm agrees with the standard [[Euclidean norm]] on '''R'''<sup>8</sup>.\n\nThe existence of a norm on '''O''' implies the existence of [[inverse element|inverses]] for every nonzero element of '''O'''. The inverse of {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ 0}} is given by\n\n:<math>x^{-1} = \\frac {x^*}{\\|x\\|^2}.</math>\n\nIt satisfies {{nowrap|1=''x'' ''x''<sup>−1</sup> = ''x''<sup>−1</sup> ''x'' = 1}}.\n\n==Properties==\nOctonionic multiplication is neither [[commutative]]:\n\n:<math>e_ie_j = -e_je_i \\neq e_je_i\\,</math> if <math>i, j</math> are distinct and non-zero,\n\nnor [[associative]]:\n\n:<math>(e_ie_j)e_k = -e_i(e_je_k) \\neq e_i(e_je_k)\\,</math> if <math>i, j, k</math> are distinct, non-zero and <math>e_ie_j \\neq\\pm e_k</math>.\n\nThe octonions do satisfy a weaker form of associativity: they are alternative. This means that the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is associative. Actually, one can show that the subalgebra generated by any two elements of '''O''' is [[isomorphic]] to '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''', all of which are associative. Because of their non-associativity, octonions do not have matrix representations, unlike quaternions.\n\nThe octonions do retain one important property shared by '''R''', '''C''', and '''H''': the norm on '''O''' satisfies\n\n:<math>\\|xy\\| = \\|x\\|\\|y\\|</math>\n\nThis equation means that the octonions form a [[composition algebra]]. The higher-dimensional algebras defined by the Cayley–Dickson construction (e.g., the sedenions) all fail to satisfy this property. They all have [[zero divisor]]s.\n\nWider number systems exist which have a multiplicative modulus (e.g. 16-dimensional conic sedenions). Their modulus is defined differently from their norm, and they also contain zero divisors.\n\nAs shown by [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]], '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O''' are the only normed division algebras over the reals. These four algebras also form the only alternative, finite-dimensional division algebras over the reals ([[up to]] isomorphism).\n\nNot being associative, the nonzero elements of '''O''' do not form a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. They do, however, form a [[loop (algebra)|loop]], indeed a [[Moufang loop]].\n\n===Commutator and cross product===\nThe [[commutator]] of two octonions ''x'' and ''y'' is given by\n\n:<math>[x, y] = xy - yx.</math>\n\nThis is antisymmetric and imaginary. If it is considered only as a product on the imaginary subspace Im('''O''') it defines a product on that space, the [[seven-dimensional cross product]], given by\n\n:<math>x \\times y = \\frac{1}{2}(xy - yx).</math>\n\nLike the [[cross product]] in three dimensions this is a vector orthogonal to ''x'' and ''y'' with magnitude\n\n:<math>\\|x \\times y\\| = \\|x\\| \\|y\\| \\sin \\theta.</math>\n\nBut like the octonion product it is not uniquely defined. Instead there are many different cross products, each one dependent on the choice of octonion product.<ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=pp. 37–38}}</ref>\n\n===Automorphisms===\nAn [[automorphism]], ''A'', of the octonions is an invertible [[linear transformation]] of '''O''' which satisfies\n\n:<math>A(xy) = A(x)A(y).</math>\n\nThe set of all automorphisms of '''O''' forms a group called [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]].<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8.6}}</ref> The group ''G''<sub>2</sub> is a [[simply connected]], [[Compact group|compact]], real [[Lie group]] of dimension 14. This group is the smallest of the exceptional Lie groups and is isomorphic to the subgroup of Spin(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional real spinor representation. The group Spin(7) is in turn a subgroup of the group of isotopies described below.\n\n''See also'': [[PSL(2,7)]] – the [[automorphism group]] of the Fano plane.\n\n===Isotopies===\nAn [[isotopy of an algebra]] is a triple of bijective linear maps ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' such that if {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = ''z''}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''(''x'')''b''(''y'') = ''c''(''z'')}}. For {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} this is the same as an automorphism. The isotopy group of an algebra is the group of all isotopies, which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup.\n\nThe isotopy group of the octonions is the group Spin<sub>8</sub>('''R'''), with ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' acting as the three 8-dimensional representations.<ref>{{harv|Conway|Smith|2003|loc=Chapter 8}}</ref> The subgroup of elements where ''c'' fixes the identity is the subgroup Spin<sub>7</sub>('''R'''), and the subgroup where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' all fix the identity is the automorphism group ''G''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n==Applications==\nThe octonions play a significant role in the classification and construction of other mathematical entities. For example, the [[exceptional Lie group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]] is the automorphism group of the octonions, and the other exceptional Lie groups [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] and [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] can be understood as the isometries of certain [[projective plane]]s defined using the octonions.<ref>Baez (2002), section 4.</ref> The set of [[self-adjoint]] <math>3 \\times 3</math> octonionic matrices, equipped with a symmetrized matrix product, defines the [[Albert algebra]].

The phrase \"integral octonions\" usually refers to a fixed choice of one of these seven orders.\n\nThese maximal orders were constructed by {{harvtxt|Kirmse|1925}}, Dickson and Bruck as follows. Label the 8 basis vectors by the points of the projective line over the field with 7 elements. First form the \"Kirmse integers\" : these consist of octonions whose coordinates are integers or half integers, and that are half integers (that is, halves of odd integers) on one of the 16 sets\n:∅ (∞124) (∞235) (∞346) (∞450) (∞561) (∞602) (∞013) (∞0123456) (0356) (1460) (2501) (3612) (4023) (5134) (6245)\nof the extended [[quadratic residue code]] of length 8 over the field of 2 elements, given by ∅, (∞124) and its images under adding a constant mod 7, and the complements of these 8 sets. Then switch infinity and any one other coordinate; this operation creates a bijection of the Kirmse integers onto a different set, which is a maximal order. There are 7 ways to do this, giving 7 maximal orders, which are all equivalent under cyclic permutations of the 7 coordinates 0123456. (Kirmse incorrectly claimed that the Kirmse integers also form a maximal order, so he thought there were 8 maximal orders rather than 7, but as {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1946}} pointed out they are not closed under multiplication; this mistake occurs in several published papers.)\n\nThe Kirmse integers and the 7 maximal orders are all isometric to the [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]] rescaled by a factor of 1/{{radic|2}}. In particular there are 240 elements of minimum nonzero norm 1 in each of these orders, forming a Moufang loop of order 240.\n\nThe integral octonions have a \"division with remainder\" property: given integral octonions ''a'' and {{nowrap|''b'' ≠ 0}}, we can find ''q'' and ''r'' with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''qb'' + ''r''}}, where the remainder ''r'' has norm less than that of ''b''.\n\nIn the integral octonions, all left ideals and right ideals are 2-sided ideals, and the only 2-sided ideals are the principal ideals ''nO'' where ''n'' is a non-negative integer.\n\nThe integral octonions have a version of factorization into primes, though it is not straightforward to state because the octonions are not associative so the product of octonions depends on the order in which one does the products. The irreducible integral octonions are exactly those of prime norm, and every integral octonion can be written as a product of irreducible octonions. More precisely an integral octonion of norm ''mn'' can be written as a product of integral octonions of norms ''m'' and ''n''.\n\nThe automorphism group of the integral octonions is the group ''G''<sub>2</sub>('''F'''<sub>2</sub>) of order 12096, which has a simple subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to the unitary group <sup>2</sup>''A''<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2</sup>). The isotopy group of the integral octonions is the perfect double cover of the group of rotations of the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Composition algebra]]\n*[[Octonion algebra]]\n*[[Okubo algebra]]\n*[[Spin(8)]]\n*[[Split-octonion]]s\n*[[Triality]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| title = The Octonions | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | issn = 0273-0979 | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 145–205 | year = 2002 | url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/ | doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-01-00934-X | arxiv = math/0105155v4| mr = 1886087}}\n* {{Cite journal | ref = harv| last1 = Baez | first1 = John C. | authorlink = John Baez| doi = 10.1090/S0273-0979-05-01052-9 | title = Errata for ''The Octonions'' | journal = Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–214 | year = 2005 | url = http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2005-42-02/S0273-0979-05-01052-9/S0273-0979-05-01052-9.pdf }}\n* {{Citation|authorlink=John Horton Conway|last1=Conway|first1=John Horton|last2=Smith|first2=Derek A.|year=2003|title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry|publisher=A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''octonion algebra''' or '''Cayley algebra''' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' is an [[algebraic structure]] which is an 8-[[Dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] [[composition algebra]] over ''F''. In other words, it is a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebra|non-associative algebra]] ''A'' over ''F'' with a [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|non-degenerate]] [[quadratic form]] ''N'' (called the ''norm form'') such that\n:<math>N(xy) = N(x)N(y)</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''.\n\nThe most well-known example of an octonion algebra is the classical [[octonion]]s, which are an octonion algebra over '''R''', the field of [[real number]]s. The [[split-octonion]]s also form an octonion algebra over '''R'''. Up to [[Algebra homomorphism|'''R'''-algebra isomorphism]], these are the only octonion algebras over the reals. The algebra of [[bioctonion]]s is the octonion algebra over the [[complex number]]s '''C'''.\n\nThe octonion algebra for ''N'' is a [[division algebra]] if and only if the form ''N'' is [[Anisotropic quadratic space|anisotropic]].  A '''split octonion algebra''' is one for which the quadratic form ''N'' is [[Isotropic quadratic form|isotropic]] (i.e., there exists a non-zero vector ''x'' with ''N''(''x'') = 0). Up to ''F''-algebra isomorphism, there is a unique split octonion algebra over any field ''F''.<ref name=Sch48>Schafer (1995) p.48</ref>  When ''F'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]] or a [[finite field]], these are the only octonion algebras over ''F''.\n\nOctonion algebras are always nonassociative. They are, however, [[alternative algebra]]s, alternativity being a weaker form of associativity. Moreover, the [[Moufang identities]] hold in any octonion algebra. It follows that the invertible elements in any octonion algebra form a [[Moufang loop]], as do the elements of unit norm.\n\nThe construction of general octonion algebras over an arbitrary field ''k'' was described by [[Leonard Dickson]] in his book ''Algebren und ihre Zahlentheorie'' (1927) (Seite 264) and repeated by [[Max Zorn]].<ref>[[Max Zorn]] (1931) \"Alternativekörper und quadratische Systeme\", [[Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg]] 9(3/4): 395–402, see 399</ref> The product depends on selection of a &gamma; from ''k''. Given ''q'' and ''Q'' from a [[quaternion algebra]] over ''k'', the octonion is written ''q'' + ''Q''e. Another octonion may be written ''r'' + ''R''e. Then with * denoting the conjugation in the quaternion algebra, their product is\n:<math>(q + Qe)(r + Re) = (qr + \\gamma R^* Q) + (Rq + q r^* )e .</math>\nZorn’s [[German language]] description of this [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] contributed to the persistent use of this [[eponym]] describing the construction of [[composition algebra]]s.\n\n==Classification==\n\nIt is a theorem of [[Adolf Hurwitz]] that the ''F''-isomorphism classes of the norm form are in one-to-one correspondence with the isomorphism classes of octonion ''F''-algebras. Moreover, the possible norm forms are exactly the [[Pfister form|Pfister 3-forms]] over ''F''.<ref name=Lam327>Lam (2005) p.327</ref>\n\nSince any two octonion ''F''-algebras become isomorphic over the algebraic closure of ''F'', one can apply the ideas of non-[[Abelian group|abelian]] [[Galois cohomology]]. In particular, by using the fact that the automorphism group of the split octonions is the split [[algebraic group]] [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]], one sees the correspondence of isomorphism classes of octonion ''F''-algebras with isomorphism classes of G<sub>2</sub>-[[torsor]]s over ''F''.

The [[ring isomorphism]]\n\n:<math>D \\rarr \\R^2 \\; : \\quad x + y j \\mapsto (x + y, x - y) </math> \n\nrelates proportional quadratic forms, but the mapping is ''not'' an [[isometry]] since the multiplicative identity (1,1) of '''R'''<sup>2</sup> is at a distance {{radic|2}} from 0, which is normalized in D.\n\nSplit-complex numbers have many other names; see the [[#Synonyms|synonyms section]] below. See the article [[Motor variable]] for functions of a split-complex number.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''split-complex number''' is an ordered pair of real numbers, written in the form\n:<math>z = x + jy</math>\nwhere ''x'' and ''y'' are [[real number]]s and the quantity ''j'' satisfies\n:<math>j^2 = +1</math>\nChoosing <math>j^2 = -1</math> results in the [[Complex_number|complex numbers]]. It is this sign change which distinguishes the split-complex numbers from the ordinary complex ones. The quantity ''j'' here is not a real number but an independent quantity.\n\nThe collection of all such ''z'' is called the '''split-complex plane'''. [[Addition]] and [[multiplication]] of split-complex numbers are defined by\n:<math>(x + j y) + (u + j v) = (x + u) + j (y + v)\n</math>\n:<math>(x + j y)(u + j v) = (xu + yv) + j (xv + yu).</math>\n\nThis multiplication is [[commutative]], [[associative]] and [[distributive property|distributes]] over addition.\n\n===Conjugate, modulus, and bilinear form===\nJust as for complex numbers, one can define the notion of a '''split-complex conjugate'''. If\n:<math>z = x + jy</math>\nthe conjugate of ''z'' is defined as\n:<math>z^* = x - jy.</math>\nThe conjugate satisfies similar properties to usual complex conjugate. Namely,\n:<math>(z+w)^* = z^* + w^*</math>\n:<math>(z w)^* = z^* w^*</math>\n:<math>(z^*)^* = z.</math>\nThese three properties imply that the split-complex conjugate is an [[automorphism]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 2.\n\nThe '''modulus''' of a split-complex number {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''j''&thinsp;''y''}} is given by the [[isotropic quadratic form]]\n: <math>\\lVert z \\rVert = z z^* = z^* z = x^2 - y^2 .</math>\nIt has the [[composition algebra]] property:\n: <math>\\lVert z w \\rVert = \\lVert z \\rVert \\lVert w \\rVert .</math>\nHowever, this quadratic form is not [[Definite bilinear form|positive-definite]] but rather has [[metric signature|signature]] {{nowrap|(1, −1)}}, so the modulus is ''not'' a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]].\n\nThe associated [[bilinear form]] is given by\n:<math>\\langle z, w \\rangle = \\operatorname{Re}(z w^*) = \\operatorname{Re}(z^* w) = xu - yv,</math>\nwhere {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''j''&thinsp;''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''j''&thinsp;''v''}}. Another expression for the modulus is then\n: <math> \\lVert z \\rVert = \\langle z, z \\rangle .</math>\nSince it is not positive-definite, this bilinear form is not an [[inner product]]; nevertheless the bilinear form is frequently referred to as an ''indefinite inner product''. A similar abuse of language refers to the modulus as a norm.\n\nA split-complex number is invertible [[if and only if]] its modulus is nonzero (<math>\\lVert z \\rVert \\ne 0 </math>), thus ''x'' ± ''j''&thinsp;''x'' have no inverse. The [[multiplicative inverse]] of an invertible element is given by\n: <math> z^{-1} = z^{*} / \\lVert z \\rVert .</math>\nSplit-complex numbers which are not invertible are called [[null vector]]s. These are all of the form {{nowrap|(''a'' ± ''j''&thinsp;''a'')}} for some real number ''a''.\n\n===The diagonal basis===\nThere are two nontrivial [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s given by {{nowrap|1=''e'' = (1 − ''j'')/2}}  and  {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>∗</sup> = (1 + ''j'')/2}}. Recall that idempotent means that {{nowrap|1=''ee'' = ''e''}} and {{nowrap|1=''e''<sup>∗</sup>''e''<sup>∗</sup> = ''e''<sup>∗</sup>}}. Both of these elements are null:\n: <math>\\lVert e \\rVert = \\lVert e^* \\rVert = e^* e = 0 .</math>\n\nIt is often convenient to use ''e'' and ''e''<sup>∗</sup> as an alternate [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the split-complex plane. This basis is called the '''diagonal basis''' or '''null basis'''. The split-complex number ''z'' can be written in the null basis as\n:<math>z = x + jy = (x-y)e + (x+y)e^*.</math>\nIf we denote the number {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''ae'' + ''be''<sup>∗</sup>}} for real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' by {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'')}}, then split-complex multiplication is given by\n:<math>(a_1,b_1)(a_2,b_2) = (a_1a_2,b_1b_2).</math>\nIn this basis, it becomes clear that the split-complex numbers are [[ring isomorphism|ring-isomorphic]] to the direct sum '''R''' ⊕ '''R''' with addition and multiplication defined pairwise.\n\nThe split-complex conjugate in the diagonal basis is given by\n:<math>(a,b)^*=(b,a)</math>\nand the modulus by\n:<math>\\lVert (a,b) \\rVert = ab .</math>\n\nThough lying in the same isomorphism class in the [[category of rings]], the split-complex plane and the direct sum of two real lines differ in their layout in the [[Cartesian plane]]. The isomorphism, as a planar mapping, consists of a counter-clockwise rotation by 45° and a [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]] by {{sqrt|2}}. The dilation in particular has sometimes caused confusion in connection with areas of [[hyperbolic sector]]s. Indeed, [[hyperbolic angle]] corresponds to [[area]] of sectors in the <math>\\mathbf{R} \\oplus \\mathbf{R}</math> plane with its \"unit circle\" given by \n<math>\\lbrace (a,b) \\in \\mathbf{R} \\oplus \\mathbf{R} : ab = 1 \\rbrace .</math> The contracted \"unit circle\"\n<math> \\lbrace \\cosh a + j \\ \\sinh a : a \\in \\mathbf{R} \\rbrace </math> of the split-complex plane has only ''half the area'' in the span of a corresponding hyperbolic sector. Such confusion may be perpetuated when the geometry of the split-complex plane is not distinguished from that of <math>\\mathbf{R} \\oplus \\mathbf{R} .</math>\n\n==Geometry==<!-- This section is linked from [[Lorentz transformation]] -->\n[[Image:Drini-conjugatehyperbolas.svg|thumb|Unit hyperbola with <nowiki>||</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>||</nowiki>=1 (blue),<br> conjugate hyperbola with <nowiki>||</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>||</nowiki>=&minus;1 (green),<br> and asymptotes <nowiki>||</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>||</nowiki>=0 (red)]]\n\nA two-dimensional real [[vector space]] with the Minkowski inner product is called {{nowrap|(1 + 1)}}-dimensional [[Minkowski space]], often denoted '''R'''<sup>1,1</sup>. Just as much of the [[geometry]] of the Euclidean plane '''R'''<sup>2</sup> can be described with complex numbers, the geometry of the Minkowski plane '''R'''<sup>1,1</sup> can be described with split-complex numbers.\n\nThe set of points\n:<math>\\{ z : \\lVert z \\rVert = a^2 \\}</math>\nis a [[hyperbola]] for every nonzero ''a'' in '''R'''. The hyperbola consists of a right and left branch passing through {{nowrap|(''a'', 0)}} and {{nowrap|(−''a'', 0)}}. The case {{nowrap|1=''a'' = 1}} is called the [[unit hyperbola]]. The conjugate hyperbola is given by\n:<math>\\{ z : \\lVert z \\rVert = -a^2 \\}</math>\nwith an upper and lower branch passing through {{nowrap|(0, ''a'')}} and {{nowrap|(0, −''a'')}}. The hyperbola and conjugate hyperbola are separated by two diagonal [[asymptote]]s which form the set of null elements:\n:<math>\\{ z : \\lVert z \\rVert = 0 \\}.</math>\nThese two lines (sometimes called the '''null cone''') are [[perpendicular]] in '''R'''<sup>2</sup> and have slopes ±1.\n\nSplit-complex numbers ''z'' and ''w'' are said to be [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] if {{nowrap|1={{langle}}''z'', ''w''{{rangle}} = 0}}. While analogous to ordinary orthogonality, particularly as it is known with ordinary complex number arithmetic, this condition is more subtle. It forms the basis for the [[Minkowski space#Causal structure|simultaneous hyperplane]] concept in spacetime.\n\nThe analogue of [[Euler's formula]] for the split-complex numbers is\n:<math>\\exp(j\\theta) = \\cosh(\\theta) + j\\sinh(\\theta).\\,</math>\nThis can be derived from a [[power series]] expansion using the fact that [[hyperbolic cosine|cosh]] has only even powers while that for [[hyperbolic sine|sinh]] has odd powers. For all real values of the [[hyperbolic angle]] ''θ'' the split-complex number {{nowrap|1=''λ'' = exp(''jθ'')}} has norm 1 and lies on the right branch of the unit hyperbola. Numbers such as λ have been called [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versors]].\n\nSince λ has modulus 1, multiplying any split-complex number ''z'' by ''λ'' preserves the modulus of ''z'' and represents a ''hyperbolic rotation'' (also called a [[Lorentz boost]] or a [[squeeze mapping]]). Multiplying by ''λ'' preserves the geometric structure, taking hyperbolas to themselves and the null cone to itself.\n\nThe set of all transformations of the split-complex plane which preserve the modulus (or equivalently, the inner product) forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the [[generalized orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|O(1, 1)}}. This group consists of the hyperbolic rotations, which form a [[subgroup]] denoted {{nowrap|SO<sup>+</sup>(1, 1)}}, combined with four [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s given by\n:<math>z\\mapsto\\pm z</math> and <math>z\\mapsto\\pm z^{*}.</math>\n\nThe exponential map\n:<math>\\exp\\colon(\\mathbb R, +) \\to \\mathrm{SO}^{+}(1,1)</math>\nsending ''θ'' to rotation by exp(''jθ'') is a [[group isomorphism]] since the usual exponential formula applies:\n:<math>e^{j(\\theta+\\phi)} = e^{j\\theta}e^{j\\phi}.\\,</math>\nIf a split-complex number ''z'' does not lie on one of the diagonals, then ''z'' has a [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]].\n\n==Algebraic properties==\nIn [[abstract algebra]] terms, the split-complex numbers can be described as the [[quotient ring|quotient]] of the [[polynomial ring]] '''R'''[''x''] by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the [[polynomial]] {{nobreak|''x''<sup>2</sup> − 1}},\n\n:'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> − 1).\n\nThe image of ''x'' in the quotient is the \"imaginary\" unit ''j''. With this description, it is clear that the split-complex numbers form a [[commutative ring]] with [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Moreover, if we define scalar multiplication in the obvious manner, the split-complex numbers actually form a commutative and [[associative algebra]] over the reals of dimension two. The algebra is ''not'' a [[division algebra]] or [[field (mathematics)|field]] since the null elements are not invertible. In fact, all of the nonzero null elements are [[zero divisor]]s.\nSince addition and multiplication are continuous operations with respect to the usual topology of the plane, the split-complex numbers form a [[topological ring]].\n\nThe algebra of split-complex numbers forms a [[composition algebra]] since\n:<math> \\lVert zw \\rVert = \\lVert z \\rVert \\lVert w \\rVert </math> &nbsp;for any numbers ''z'' and ''w''.\n\nFrom the definition it is apparent that the ring of split-complex numbers\nis isomorphic to the [[group ring]] '''R'''[C<sub>2</sub>]\nof the [[cyclic group]] C<sub>2</sub> over the real numbers '''R'''.\n\n==Matrix representations==\nOne can easily represent split-complex numbers by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The split-complex number\n:<math>z = x + jy</math>\ncan be represented by the matrix\n:<math>z \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}x & y \\\\ y & x\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nAddition and multiplication of split-complex numbers are then given by matrix addition and multiplication. The modulus of ''z'' is given by the [[determinant]] of the corresponding matrix. In this representation, split-complex conjugation corresponds to multiplying on both sides by the matrix\n:<math>C = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} .</math>\n\nFor any real number ''a'', a hyperbolic rotation by a [[hyperbolic angle]] ''a'' corresponds to multiplication by the matrix\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\\cosh a & \\sinh a \\\\ \\sinh a & \\cosh a\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n[[File:Commutative diagram split-complex number 2.svg|right|200px|thumb|This [[commutative diagram]] relates the action of the hyperbolic versor on ''D'' to squeeze mapping &sigma; applied to R<sup>2</sup>]]\n\nThe diagonal basis for the split-complex number plane can be invoked by using an ordered pair {{nowrap|(''x'', ''y'')}} for <math>z = x + jy</math> and making the mapping\n:<math>(u,v) = (x,y) \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\1 & -1\\end{pmatrix} = (x,y) S .</math>\nNow the quadratic form is <math> u v = (x+y)(x-y) = x^2 - y^2 .</math>\nFurthermore,\n:<math>(\\cosh a, \\sinh a)\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\\\1 & -1\\end{pmatrix} = (e^a, e^{-a})</math>\nso the two [[one-parameter group|parametrized]] hyperbolas are brought into correspondence with ''S''.\nThe [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] <math>e^{bj} \\!</math>\nthen corresponds under this linear transformation to a [[squeeze mapping]]\n:<math>\\sigma:(u,v) \\mapsto (r u, v/r) ,\\quad r = e^b .</math>\n\nNote that in the context of [[2 × 2 real matrices]] there are in fact a great number of different representations of split-complex numbers. The above diagonal representation represents the [[Jordan canonical form]] of the matrix representation of the split-complex numbers. For a split-complex number {{nowrap|1=''z'' = (''x'', ''y'')}} given by the following matrix representation:\n:<math>Z = \\begin{pmatrix}x & y \\\\ y & x\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nits Jordan canonical form is given by:\n:<math> J_{z} = \\begin{pmatrix}x+y & 0 \\\\ 0 & x-y\\end{pmatrix} ,</math>\nwhere <math>Z = S J_{z} S^{-1} \\ ,</math> and \n:<math> S = \\begin{pmatrix}1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1\\end{pmatrix} .</math>\n\n==History==\nThe use of split-complex numbers dates back to 1848 when [[James Cockle (lawyer)|James Cockle]] revealed his [[tessarine]]s.<ref>[[James Cockle]] (1849) [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20121#page/51/mode/1up On a New Imaginary in Algebra] 34:37–47, ''London-Edinburgh-Dublin Philosophical Magazine'' (3) '''33''':435–9, link from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]].</ref> [[William Kingdon Clifford]] used split-complex numbers to represent sums of spins. Clifford introduced the use of split-complex numbers as coefficients in a quaternion algebra now called [[split-biquaternion]]s. He called its elements \"motors\", a term in parallel with the \"rotor\" action of an ordinary complex number taken from the [[circle group]]. Extending the analogy, functions of a [[motor variable]] contrast to functions of an ordinary [[complex variable]].\n\nSince the early twentieth century, the split-complex multiplication has commonly been seen as a [[Lorentz boost]] of a [[spacetime]] plane.<ref>Francesco Antonuccio (1994) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/9311032v2.pdf Semi-complex analysis and mathematical physics]</ref><ref>F.

We introduce a new imaginary unit ℓ and write a pair of quaternions (''a'', ''b'') in the form ''a'' + ℓ''b''. The product is defined by the rule:<ref> Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', page 158, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n:<math>(a + \\ell b)(c + \\ell d) = (ac + \\lambda \\bar db) + \\ell(da + b\\bar c)</math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\lambda = \\ell^2.</math>\nIf λ is chosen to be &minus;1, we get the octonions. If, instead, it is taken to be +1 we get the split-octonions. One can also obtain the split-octonions via a Cayley–Dickson doubling of the [[split-quaternion]]s. Here either choice of λ (±1) gives the split-octonions.\n\n===Multiplication table===\n[[File:SplitFanoPlane.svg|thumb|A mnemonic for the products of the split octonions.]]\n\nA [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the split-octonions is given by the set { <math>1, i, j, k, \\ell, \\ell i, \\ell j, \\ell k</math> }.\n\nEvery split-octonion <math>x</math> can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the basis elements,\n:<math>x = x_0 + x_1\\,i + x_2\\,j + x_3\\,k + x_4\\,\\ell + x_5\\,\\ell i + x_6\\,\\ell j + x_7\\,\\ell k,</math>\nwith real coefficients <math>x_a</math>.\n\nBy linearity, multiplication of split-octonions is completely determined by the following [[multiplication table]]:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:0.5em auto\"\n|- \n  |\n  |\n  |colspan=\"8\" | multiplier\n|-\n  | | \n  ! width=\"30pt\" | \n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>1</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>i</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>j</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>k</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>\\ell</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>\\ell i</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>\\ell j</math>\n  ! width=\"30pt\" | <math>\\ell k</math>\n|-\n  | rowspan=\"8\" | multiplicand\n  !<math>1</math>\n  |<math>1</math>\n  |<math>i</math>\n  |<math>j</math>\n  |<math>k</math>\n  |<math>\\ell</math>\n  |<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell k</math>\n|-\n  !<math>i</math>\n  |<math>i</math>\n  |<math>-1</math>\n  |<math>k</math>\n  |<math>-j</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>\\ell</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>\\ell j</math>\n|-\n  !<math>j</math>\n  |<math>j</math>\n  |<math>-k</math>\n  |<math>-1</math>\n  |<math>i</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>\\ell</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell i</math>\n|-\n  !<math>k</math>\n  |<math>k</math>\n  |<math>j</math>\n  |<math>-i</math>\n  |<math>-1</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>\\ell</math>\n|-\n  !<math>\\ell</math>\n  |<math>\\ell</math>\n  |<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>1</math>\n  |<math>i</math>\n  |<math>j</math>\n  |<math>k</math>\n|-\n  !<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>-i</math>\n  |<math>1</math>\n  |<math>k</math>\n  |<math>-j</math>\n|-\n  !<math>\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>-j</math>\n  |<math>-k</math>\n  |<math>1</math>\n  |<math>i</math>\n|-\n  !<math>\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>\\ell k</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell j</math>\n  |<math>\\ell i</math>\n  |<math>-\\ell</math>\n  |<math>-k</math>\n  |<math>j</math>\n  |<math>-i</math>\n  |<math>1</math>\n|}\n\nA convenient [[mnemonic]] is given by the diagram at the right which represents the multiplication table for the split-octonions. This one is derived from its parent octonion (one of 480 possible), which is defined by: \n\n:<math>e_i e_j = - \\delta_{ij}e_0 + \\varepsilon _{ijk} e_k,\\, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta_{ij}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]] and <math>\\varepsilon _{ijk}</math> is a [[completely antisymmetric tensor]] with value <math>+1</math> when <math>ijk = 123, 154, 176, 264, 257, 374, 365,</math> and:\n\n:<math>e_ie_0 = e_0e_i = e_i;\\,\\,\\,\\,e_0e_0 = e_0,\\,</math>\n\nwith <math>e_0</math> the scalar element, and <math>i, j, k = 1 ... 7</math>. \n\nThe red arrows indicate possible direction reversals imposed by negating the lower right quadrant of the parent creating a split octonion with this multiplication table.\n\n===Conjugate, norm and inverse===\n\nThe ''conjugate'' of a split-octonion ''x'' is given by\n:<math>\\bar x = x_0 - x_1\\,i - x_2\\,j - x_3\\,k - x_4\\,\\ell - x_5\\,\\ell i - x_6\\,\\ell j - x_7\\,\\ell k</math>&nbsp; just as for the octonions.\n\nThe [[quadratic form]] on ''x'' is given by\n:<math>N(x) = \\bar x x = (x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2) - (x_4^2 + x_5^2 + x_6^2 + x_7^2) .</math>\n\nThis quadratic form N(''x'') is an [[isotropic quadratic form]] since there are non-zero split-octonions ''x'' with N(''x'') = 0. With N, the split-octonions form a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] of eight dimensions over ℝ, sometimes written ℝ<sup>4,4</sup> to denote the signature of the quadratic form.\n\nIf N(''x'') ≠ 0, then ''x'' has a (two-sided) [[multiplicative inverse]] ''x''<sup>&minus;1</sup> given by\n:<math>x^{-1} = N(x)^{-1}{\\bar x}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n\nThe split-octonions, like the octonions, are noncommutative and nonassociative. Also like the octonions, they form a [[composition algebra]] since the quadratic form ''N'' is multiplicative. That is,\n:<math>N(xy) = N(x)N(y).\\,</math>\nThe split-octonions satisfy the [[Moufang identities]] and so form an [[alternative algebra]]. Therefore, by [[Artin's theorem]], the subalgebra generated by any two elements is associative. The set of all invertible elements (i.e. those elements for which ''N''(''x'') ≠ 0) form a [[Moufang loop]].\n\n==Zorn's vector-matrix algebra==\n\nSince the split-octonions are nonassociative they cannot be represented by ordinary [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (matrix multiplication is always associative). [[Max August Zorn|Zorn]] found a way to represent them as \"matrices\" containing both scalars and vectors using a modified version of matrix multiplication.<ref>[[Max Zorn]] (1931) \"Alternativekörper und quadratische Systeme\", [[Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg]] 9(3/4): 395–402</ref> Specifically, define a ''vector-matrix'' to be a 2&times;2 matrix of the form<ref>[[Nathan Jacobson]] (1962) ''Lie Algebras'', page 142, Interscience Publishers.</ref><ref>Richard D.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Alexander polynomial''' is a [[knot invariant]] which assigns a [[polynomial]] with integer coefficients to each knot type.  [[James Waddell Alexander II]] discovered this, the first [[knot polynomial]], in 1923.  In 1969, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] showed a version of this polynomial, now called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''', could be computed using a [[skein relation]], although its significance was not realized until the discovery of the [[Jones polynomial]] in 1984.  Soon after Conway's reworking of the Alexander polynomial, it was realized that a similar skein relation was exhibited in Alexander's paper on his polynomial.<ref>Alexander describes his skein relation toward the end of his paper under the heading \"miscellaneous theorems\", which is possibly why it got lost.  [[Joan Birman]] mentions in her paper ''New points of view in knot theory'' (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 28 (1993), no. 2, 253–287) that Mark Kidwell brought her attention to Alexander's relation in 1970.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''K'' be a [[Knot (mathematics)|knot]] in the [[3-sphere]].  Let ''X'' be the infinite [[covering space|cyclic cover]] of the [[knot complement]] of ''K''.  This covering can be obtained by cutting the knot complement along a [[Seifert surface]] of ''K'' and gluing together infinitely many copies of the resulting manifold with boundary in a cyclic manner.  There is a [[deck transformation|covering transformation]] ''t'' acting on ''X''.  Consider the first homology (with integer coefficients) of ''X'', denoted <math>H_1(X)</math>.  The transformation ''t'' acts on the homology and so we can consider <math>H_1(X)</math> a [[module (mathematics)|module]] over the ring of [[Laurent polynomial]]s <math>\\mathbb{Z}[t, t^{-1}]</math>.  This is called the '''Alexander invariant''' or '''Alexander module'''.\n\nThe module is finitely presentable; a [[presentation matrix]] for this module is called the '''Alexander matrix'''.  If the number of generators, ''r'', is less than or equal to the number of relations, ''s'', then we consider the ideal generated by all ''r'' by ''r'' minors of the matrix; this is the zero'th [[Fitting ideal]] or '''Alexander ideal''' and does not depend on choice of presentation matrix.  If ''r > s'', set the ideal equal to 0.  If the Alexander ideal is [[principal ideal|principal]], take a generator; this is called an Alexander polynomial of the knot.  Since this is only unique up to multiplication by the Laurent monomial <math>\\pm t^n</math>, one often fixes a particular unique form.  Alexander's choice of normalization is to make the polynomial have a positive [[constant term]].\n\nAlexander proved that the Alexander ideal is nonzero and always principal.  Thus an Alexander polynomial always exists, and is clearly a knot invariant, denoted <math>\\Delta_K(t)</math>. The Alexander polynomial for the knot configured by only one string is a polynomial of t<sup>2</sup> and then it is the same polynomial for the mirror image knot. Namely, it can not distinguish between the knot and one for its mirror image.\n\n==Computing the polynomial==\nThe following procedure for computing the Alexander polynomial was given by J. W. Alexander in his paper.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alexander |first1=J.W. |title=Topological Invariants of Knots and Links |url=http://www.ams.org/journals/tran/1928-030-02/S0002-9947-1928-1501429-1/S0002-9947-1928-1501429-1.pdf |accessdate=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nTake an [[oriented]] diagram  of the knot with ''n'' crossings; there are ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 regions of the knot diagram. To work out the Alexander polynomial, first one must create an [[incidence matrix]] of size (''n'', ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2).  The ''n'' rows correspond to the ''n'' crossings, and the ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 columns to the regions. The values for the matrix entries are either 0, 1, −1, ''t'', −''t''.\n\nConsider the entry corresponding to a particular region and crossing. If the region is not adjacent to the crossing, the entry is 0. If the region is adjacent to the crossing, the entry depends on its location. The following table gives the entry, determined by the location of the region at the crossing from the perspective of the incoming undercrossing line.\n\n: on the left before undercrossing: −''t''\n: on the right before undercrossing: 1\n: on the left after undercrossing: ''t''\n: on the right after undercrossing: −1\n\nRemove two columns corresponding to adjacent regions from the matrix, and work out the determinant of the new ''n'' by ''n'' matrix.  Depending on the columns removed, the answer will differ by multiplication by <math>\\pm t^n</math>, where the power of n is not necessarily the number of crossings in the knot.  To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of ''t'' and multiply by −1 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive.  This gives the Alexander polynomial.\n\nThe Alexander polynomial can also be computed from the [[Seifert matrix]].\n\nAfter the work of J. W. Alexander, [[Ralph Fox]] considered a copresentation of the knot group <math>\\pi_1(S^3\\backslash K)</math>, and introduced non-commutative differential calculus {{harvtxt|Fox|1961}}, which also permits one to compute <math>\\Delta_K(t)</math>. Detailed exposition of this approach about higher Alexander polynomials can be found in the book {{harvtxt|Crowell|Fox|1963}}.\n\n==Basic properties of the polynomial==\n\nThe Alexander polynomial is symmetric: <math>\\Delta_K(t^{-1}) = \\Delta_K(t)</math> for all knots K.\n\n: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the [[Poincaré duality|Poincaré Duality isomorphism]] <math> \\overline{H_1 X} \\simeq \\mathrm{Hom}_{\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]}(H_1 X, G) </math> where <math>G</math> is the quotient of the field of fractions of <math>\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]</math> by <math>\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]</math>, considered as a <math>\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]</math>-module, and where <math>\\overline{H_1 X}</math> is the conjugate <math>\\mathbb Z[t,t^{-1}]</math>-module to <math>H_1 X</math> ie: as an abelian group it is identical to <math>H_1 X</math> but the covering transformation <math>t</math> acts by <math>t^{-1}</math>.\n\nFurthermore, the Alexander polynomial evaluates to a unit on 1: <math>\\Delta_K(1)=\\pm 1</math>.\n\n: From the point of view of the definition, this is an expression of the fact that the knot complement is a homology circle, generated by the covering transformation <math>t</math>.  More generally if <math>M</math> is a 3-manifold such that <math>rank(H_1 M) = 1</math> it has an Alexander polynomial <math>\\Delta_M(t)</math> defined as the order ideal of its infinite-cyclic covering space.  In this case <math>\\Delta_M(1)</math> is, up to sign, equal to the order of the torsion subgroup of <math>H_1 M</math>.\n\nIt is known that every integral Laurent polynomial which is both symmetric and evaluates to a unit at 1 is the Alexander polynomial of a knot (Kawauchi 1996).\n\n==Geometric significance of the polynomial==\n\nSince the Alexander ideal is principal, <math>\\Delta_K(t)=1</math> [[if and only if]] the commutator subgroup of the knot group is [[perfect group|perfect]] (i.e. equal to its own [[commutator subgroup]]).\n\nFor a [[topologically slice]] knot, the Alexander polynomial satisfies the Fox–Milnor condition <math>\\Delta_K(t) = f(t)f(t^{-1})</math> where <math>f(t)</math> is some other integral Laurent polynomial.\n\nTwice the [[Seifert surface|knot genus]] is bounded below by the degree of the Alexander polynomial.\n\n[[Michael Freedman]] proved that a knot in the 3-sphere is [[topologically slice]]; i.e., bounds a \"locally-flat\" topological disc in the 4-ball, if the Alexander polynomial of the knot is trivial (Freedman and Quinn, 1990).\n\n{{harvtxt|Kauffman|1983}} describes the first construction of the Alexander polynomial via state sums derived from physical models. A survey of these topic and other connections with physics are given in {{harvtxt|Kauffman|2001}}.\n\nThere are other relations with surfaces and smooth 4-dimensional topology. For example, under certain assumptions, there is a way of modifying a smooth [[4-manifold]] by performing a [[surgery theory|surgery]] that consists of removing a neighborhood of a two-dimensional torus and replacing it with a knot complement crossed with ''S''<sup>1</sup>. The result is a smooth 4-manifold homeomorphic to the original, though now the [[Seiberg–Witten invariant]] has been modified by multiplication with the Alexander polynomial of the knot.<ref>{{Cite arxiv<!-- Deny Citation Bot-->|arxiv = dg-ga/9612014 |title = Knots, Links, and 4-Manifolds  |last1 = Fintushel|first1 = Ronald|last2 = Stern|first2 = Ronald J|year = 1996}}</ref>\n\nKnots with symmetries are known to have restricted Alexander polynomials. See the symmetry section in (Kawauchi 1996). Nonetheless, the Alexander polynomial can fail to detect some symmetries, such as strong invertibility.\n\nIf the [[knot complement]] fibers over the circle, then the Alexander polynomial of the knot is known to be ''monic'' (the coefficients of the highest and lowest order terms are equal to <math>\\pm 1</math>). In fact, if <math>S \\to C_K \\to S^1</math> is a fiber bundle where <math>C_K</math> is the knot complement, let <math>g : S \\to S</math> represent the [[monodromy]], then <math>\\Delta_K(t) = {\\rm Det}(tI-g_*)</math> where <math>g_*\\colon H_1 S \\to H_1 S</math> is the induced map on homology.\n\n==Relations to satellite operations==\n\nIf a knot <math>K</math> is a [[satellite knot]] with pattern knot <math>K'</math> (there exists an embedding <math>f : S^1 \\times D^2 \\to S^3</math> such that <math>K=f(K')</math>, where <math>S^1 \\times D^2 \\subset S^3</math> is an unknotted solid torus containing <math>K'</math>), then <math>\\Delta_K(t) = \\Delta_{f(S^1 \\times \\{0\\})}(t^a) \\Delta_{K'}(t)</math>, where <math>a \\in \\mathbb Z</math> is the integer that represents <math>K' \\subset S^1 \\times D^2</math> in <math>H_1(S^1\\times D^2) = \\mathbb Z</math>.\n\nExamples: For a connect-sum <math>\\Delta_{K_1 \\# K_2}(t) = \\Delta_{K_1}(t) \\Delta_{K_2}(t)</math>. If <math>K</math> is an untwisted [[Satellite knot|Whitehead double]], then <math>\\Delta_K(t)=\\pm 1</math>.\n\n==Alexander–Conway polynomial==\nAlexander proved the Alexander polynomial satisfies a skein relation.  [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]] later rediscovered this in a different form and showed that the skein relation together with a choice of value on the unknot was enough to determine the polynomial.  Conway's version is a polynomial in ''z'' with integer coefficients, denoted <math>\\nabla(z)</math> and called the '''Alexander–Conway polynomial''' (also known as '''Conway polynomial''' or '''Conway–Alexander polynomial''').\n\nSuppose we are given an oriented link diagram, where <math>L_+, L_-, L_0</math> are link diagrams resulting from crossing and smoothing changes on a local region of a specified crossing of the diagram, as indicated in the figure.  [[Image:Skein (HOMFLY).svg|200px|center]]\n\nHere are Conway's skein relations:\n\n* <math>\\nabla(O) = 1</math> (where O is any diagram of the unknot)\n* <math>\\nabla(L_+) - \\nabla(L_-) = z \\nabla(L_0)</math>\n\nThe relationship to the standard Alexander polynomial is given by <math>\\Delta_L(t^2) = \\nabla_L(t - t^{-1})</math>.  Here <math>\\Delta_L</math> must be properly normalized (by multiplication of <math>\\pm t^{n/2}</math>) to satisfy the skein relation <math>\\Delta(L_+) - \\Delta(L_-) = (t^{1/2} - t^{-1/2}) \\Delta(L_0)</math>.  Note that this relation gives a Laurent polynomial in ''t<sup>1/2</sup>''.\n\nSee [[knot theory]] for an example computing the Conway polynomial of the trefoil.\n\n==Relation to Floer homology==\n\nUsing pseudo-holomorphic curves, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004}} and {{harvtxt|Rasmussen|2003}} associated a bigraded abelian group, called knot Floer homology, to each isotopy class of knots. The graded [[Euler characteristic]] of knot Floer homology is the Alexander polynomial. While the Alexander polynomial gives a lower bound on the genus of a knot, {{harvtxt|Ozsvath|Szabo|2004b}} showed that knot Floer homology detects the genus. Similarly, while the Alexander polynomial gives an obstruction to a knot complement fibering over the circle, {{harvtxt|Ni|2007}} showed that knot Floer homology completely determines when a knot complement fibers over the circle. The knot Floer homology groups are part of the Heegaard Floer homology family of invariants; see [[Floer homology]] for further discussion.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal |first=J.

      "text": "{{italic title}}\n[[File:Begriffsschrift Titel.png|thumb|200px|The title page of the original 1879 edition]]\n'''''Begriffsschrift''''' (German for, roughly, \"concept-script\") is a book on [[logic]] by [[Gottlob Frege]], published in 1879, and the [[formal system]] set out in that book.\n\n''Begriffsschrift'' is usually translated as ''concept writing'' or ''concept notation''; the full title of the book identifies it as \"a [[formula]] [[language]], modeled on that of [[arithmetic]], of pure [[thought]].\" Frege's motivation for developing his formal approach to logic resembled [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s motivation for his [[calculus ratiocinator]] (despite that, in the foreword Frege clearly denies that he achieved this aim, and also that his main aim would be constructing an ideal language like Leibniz's, which Frege declares to be a quite hard and idealistic, however not impossible, task). Frege went on to employ his logical calculus in his research on the [[foundations of mathematics]], carried out over the next quarter century.\n\n== Notation and the system ==\nThe calculus contains the first appearance of quantified variables, and is essentially classical bivalent [[second-order logic]] with identity.  It is bivalent in that sentences or formulas denote either True or False; second order because it includes relation variables in addition to object variables and allows quantification over both.  The modifier \"with identity\" specifies that the language includes the identity relation, =.\n\nFrege presents his calculus using idiosyncratic two-dimensional [[mathematical notation|notation]]: connectives and quantifiers are written using lines connecting formulas, rather than the symbols ¬, ∧, and ∀ in use today. For example, that judgement ''B'' materially implies judgement ''A'', i.e. <math> B \\rightarrow A </math> is written as [[File:BS-05-Kondicionaliskis-svg.svg|60px]].\n\nIn the first chapter, Frege defines basic ideas and notation, like proposition (\"judgement\"), the [[universal quantifier]] (\"the generality\"), the [[material conditional|conditional]], [[negation]] and the \"sign for identity of content\" <math> \\equiv </math> (which he used to indicate both [[material equivalence]] and identity proper); in the second chapter he declares nine formalized propositions as axioms.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" |Basic concept\n! scope=\"col\" |Frege's notation\n! scope=\"col\" |Modern notations\n|-\n||Judging\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>\\vdash A,\\Vdash A</math>\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>p(A)=1,</math>\n<math>p(A)=i</math>\n<math>\\vdash A, \\Vdash A</math>\n|-\n||Negation\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Begriffsschrift connective1.svg|60px]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>\\neg A</math><br>\n<math>{\\sim} A</math>\n|-\n||Conditional (implication)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:Begriffsschrift connective2.svg|80px]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>B\\rightarrow A</math>\n<math>B\\supset A</math>\n|-\n||Universal quantification\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[File:BS-12-Begriffsschrift Quantifier1-svg.svg |85px]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>\\forall x\\, F(x)</math>\n|-\n||[[Existential quantification]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[file:BS-14-Begriffsschrift Quantifier3-svg.svg|95px]]\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>\\exists x\\, F(x)</math>\n|-\n||Content identity (equivalence/identity)\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>A\\equiv B</math>\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|<math>A \\leftrightarrow B</math><br>\n<math>A \\equiv B</math><br>\n<math>A = B</math>\n|}\n\nIn chapter 1, §5, Frege defines the conditional as follows:\n\n:\"Let A and B refer to judgeable contents, then the four possibilities are:\n# A is asserted, B is asserted;\n# A is asserted, B is negated;\n# A is negated, B is asserted;\n#A is negated, B is negated.\n\nLet\n\n:[[File:Kondicionaliskis wb.png]]\nsignify that the third of those possibilities does not obtain, but one of the three others does. So if we negate [[File:Begriffsschrift connective2.svg|69x55px]],                              \nthat means the third possibility is valid, i.e. we negate A and assert B.\"\n\n== The calculus in Frege's work  ==\nFrege declared nine of his propositions to be [[axiom]]s, and justified them by arguing informally that, given their intended meanings, they express self-evident truths. Re-expressed in contemporary notation, these axioms are:\n\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ A \\rightarrow \\left( B \\rightarrow A \\right) </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ \\left[ \\ A \\rightarrow \\left( B \\rightarrow C \\right) \\ \\right] \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\left[ \\ \\left( A \\rightarrow B \\right) \\rightarrow \\left( A \\rightarrow C \\right) \\ \\right] </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ \\left[ \\ D \\rightarrow \\left( B \\rightarrow A \\right) \\ \\right] \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\left[ \\ B \\rightarrow \\left( D \\rightarrow A \\right) \\ \\right] </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ \\left( B \\rightarrow A \\right) \\ \\rightarrow \\ \\left( \\lnot A \\rightarrow \\lnot B \\right) </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ \\lnot \\lnot A \\rightarrow A </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ A \\rightarrow  \\lnot\\lnot A </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ \\left( c=d \\right) \\rightarrow \\left( f(c) = f(d) \\right) </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\ c = c </math>\n# <math> \\vdash \\ \\  \\forall a \\ f(a)  \\rightarrow \\ f(c) </math>\n\nThese are propositions 1, 2, 8, 28, 31, 41, 52, 54, and 58 in the ''Begriffschrifft''. (1)–(3) govern [[material conditional|material implication]], (4)–(6) [[negation]], (7) and (8) identity, and (9) the [[universal quantifier]]. (7) expresses [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]'s [[identity of indiscernibles|indiscernibility of identicals]], and (8) asserts that identity is a [[reflexive relation]].\n\nAll other propositions are deduced from (1)–(9) by invoking any of the following [[inference rule]]s:\n*[[Modus ponens]] allows us to infer <math>\\vdash B</math> from <math>\\vdash A \\to B</math> and <math>\\vdash A</math>;\n*The [[generalization (logic)|rule of generalization]] allows us to infer <math>\\vdash P \\to \\forall x A(x)</math> from <math>\\vdash P \\to A(x)</math> if ''x'' does not occur in ''P'';\n*The [[first-order logic#Rules of inference|rule of substitution]], which Frege does not state explicitly. This rule is much harder to articulate precisely than the two preceding rules, and Frege invokes it in ways that are not obviously legitimate.\n\nThe main results of the third chapter, titled \"Parts from a general series theory,\" concern what is now called the [[ancestral relation|ancestral]] of a relation ''R''. \"''a'' is an ''R''-ancestor of ''b''\" is written \"''aR''*''b''\".\n\nFrege applied the results from the ''Begriffsschrifft'', including those on the ancestral of a relation, in his later work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]''. Thus, if we take ''xRy'' to be the relation ''y'' = ''x'' + 1, then 0''R''*''y'' is the predicate \"''y'' is a natural number.\" (133) says that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are [[natural number]]s, then one of the following must hold: ''x'' < ''y'', ''x'' = ''y'', or ''y'' < ''x''. This is the so-called \"law of [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomy]]\".\n\n== Influence on other works ==\nFor a careful recent study of how the ''Begriffsschrift'' was reviewed in the German mathematical literature, see Vilko (1998). Some reviewers, especially [[Ernst Schröder]], were on the whole favorable. All work in formal logic subsequent to the ''Begriffsschrift'' is indebted to it, because its second-order logic was the first formal logic capable of representing a fair bit of mathematics and natural language.\n\nSome vestige of Frege's notation survives in the \"[[Turnstile (symbol)|turnstile]]\" symbol <math>\\vdash</math> derived from his   \"Urteilsstrich\" (''judging/inferring stroke'') │ and \"Inhaltsstrich\" (i.e. ''content stroke'') ──. Frege used these symbols in the ''Begriffsschrift'' in the unified form ├─ for declaring that a proposition is true.  In his later \"Grundgesetze\" he revises slightly his interpretation of the ├─ symbol.\n\nIn \"Begriffsschrift\" the \"Definitionsdoppelstrich\" (i.e. ''definition double stroke'') │├─ indicates that a proposition is a definition. Furthermore, the negation sign  <math>\\neg</math> can be read as a combination of the horizontal ''Inhaltsstrich'' with a vertical negation stroke. This negation symbol was reintroduced by  [[Arend Heyting]]<ref>Arend Heyting: \"Die formalen Regeln der intuitionistischen Logik,\" in: ''Sitzungsberichte der preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, phys.-math. Klasse'', 1930, pp. 42–65.</ref> in 1930 to distinguish [[intuitionistic]] from classical negation. It also appears in [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gerhard Gentzen's]] doctoral dissertation.\n\nIn the ''[[Tractatus Logico Philosophicus]]'', [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] pays homage to Frege by employing the term ''Begriffsschrift'' as a synonym for logical formalism.\n\nFrege's 1892 essay, \"[[On Sense and Reference]],\" recants some of the conclusions of the ''Begriffsschrifft'' about identity (denoted in mathematics by the \"=\" sign).  In particular, he rejects the \"Begriffsschrift\" view that the identity predicate expresses a relationship between names, in favor of the conclusion that it expresses [[equality (mathematics)|a relationship between the objects]] that are [[denotation (semiotics)|denoted]] by those names.\n\n== Quotations ==\n<blockquote>\"If the task of philosophy is to break the domination of words over the human mind [...], then my concept notation, being developed for these purposes, can be a useful instrument for philosophers [...] I believe the cause of logic has been advanced  already by the invention of this concept notation.\" (Preface to the ''Begriffsschrift'')</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ancestral relation]]\n*[[Frege's propositional calculus]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[[Gottlob Frege]].

Example applications of braid groups include [[knot theory]], where any knot may be represented as the closure of certain braids (a result known as [[Alexander's theorem]]); in [[mathematical physics]] where Artin's canonical presentation of the braid group corresponds to the [[Yang–Baxter equation]] (see {{Section link||Basic properties}}); and in [[monodromy]] invariants of algebraic geometry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Daniel|last2=Suciu|first2=Alexander|date=1997|title=The Braid Monodromy of Plane Algebraic Curves and Hyperplane Arrangements|journal=Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici|volume=72|issue=2|doi=10.1007/s000140050017|pmid=|access-date=|via=|pages=285–315|arxiv=alg-geom/9608001}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nIn this introduction let {{math|''n'' {{=}} 4}}; the generalization to other values of {{math|''n''}} will be straightforward. Consider two sets of four items lying on a table, with the items in each set being arranged in a vertical line, and such that one set sits next to the other. (In the illustrations below, these are the black dots.)  Using four strands, each item of the first set is connected with an item of the second set so that a one-to-one correspondence results. Such a connection is called a ''braid''. Often some strands will have to pass over or under others, and this is crucial: the following two connections are ''different'' braids:\n:\n{| valign=\"centre\"\n|-----\n| [[File:braid s1 inv.png|The braid sigma 1^(-1)]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is different from&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<td>[[File:braid s1.png|The braid sigma 1]]\n|}\n\nOn the other hand, two such connections which can be made to look the same by \"pulling the strands\" are considered ''the same'' braid:\n:\n{| valign=\"centre\"\n|-----\n| [[File:braid s1 inv.png|The braid sigma 1^(-1)]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the same as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<td>[[File:braid s1 inv alt.png|Another representation of sigma 1^(-1)]]\n|}\n\nAll strands are required to move from left to right; knots like the following are ''not'' considered braids:\n:\n{| valign=\"centre\"\n|-----\n| [[File:braid nobraid.png|Not a braid]]\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a braid\n|}\n\nAny two braids can be ''composed'' by drawing the first next to the second, identifying the four items in the middle, and connecting corresponding strands:\n:\n{| valign=\"centre\"\n|-----\n| [[File:braid s3.png]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composed with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| [[File:braid s2.png]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yields &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<td>[[File:braid s3s2.png]]\n|}\n\nAnother example:\n:\n{| valign=\"centre\"\n|-----\n| [[File:braid s1 inv s3 inv.png]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composed with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| [[File:braid s1 s3 inv.png]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yields &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| [[File:braid s3 inv squared.png]]\n|}\nThe composition of the braids {{math|σ}} and {{math|τ}} is written as {{math|στ}}.\n\nThe set of all braids on four strands is denoted by <math>B_4</math>. The above composition of braids is indeed a [[group (mathematics)|group]] operation. The [[identity element]] is the braid consisting of four parallel horizontal strands, and the [[inverse element|inverse]] of a braid consists of that braid which \"undoes\" whatever the first braid did, which is obtained by flipping a diagram such as the ones above across a vertical line going through its centre. (The first two example braids above are inverses of each other.)\n\n== Applications ==\nBraid theory has recently been applied to [[fluid mechanics]], specifically to the field of [[chaotic mixing]] in fluid flows. The braiding of (2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional space-time trajectories formed by motion of physical rods, periodic orbits or \"ghost rods\", and almost-invariant sets has been used to estimate the [[topological entropy]] of several engineered and naturally occurring fluid systems, via the use of [[Nielsen–Thurston classification]].<ref>{{citation|last1= Boyland|first1 = Philip L.|last2= Aref|first2 = Hassan|last3= Stremler|first3= Mark A.|bibcode = 2000JFM...403..277B|doi= 10.1017/S0022112099007107|mr= 1742169|journal     = Journal of Fluid Mechanics|pages = 277–304|title = Topological fluid mechanics of stirring|url= http://www.math.ufl.edu/~boyland/stir.pdf|volume = 403|year = 2000|deadurl = yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110726092237/http://www.math.ufl.edu/~boyland/stir.pdf|archivedate = 2011-07-26|df=}}</ref><ref>{{citation| last1 = Gouillart | first1 = Emmanuelle| last2 = Thiffeault | first2 = Jean-Luc| last3 = Finn | first3 = Matthew D.| arxiv = nlin/0510075| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevE.73.036311| mr = 2231368| issue = 3| journal = Physical Review E| page = 036311| title = Topological mixing with ghost rods| volume = 73| year = 2006|bibcode = 2006PhRvE..73c6311G }}</ref><ref>{{citation| last1 = Stremler | first1 = Mark A.| last2 = Ross | first2 = Shane D.| last3 = Grover | first3 = Piyush| last4 = Kumar | first4 = Pankaj| doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.114101| issue = 11| journal = Physical Review Letters| page = 114101| title = Topological chaos and periodic braiding of almost-cyclic sets| volume = 106| year = 2011|bibcode = 2011PhRvL.106k4101S }}</ref>\n\n==Formal treatment==\n{{Main|Configuration space (mathematics)#Connection to braid groups}}\n\nTo put the above informal discussion of braid groups on firm ground, one needs to use the [[homotopy]] concept of [[algebraic topology]], defining braid groups as [[fundamental group]]s of a [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]. Alternatively, one can define the braid group purely algebraically via the braid relations, keeping the pictures in mind only to guide the intuition.\n\nTo explain how to reduce a braid group in the sense of Artin to a fundamental group, we consider a connected [[manifold]] <math>X</math> of dimension at least 2. The ''[[Symmetric product (topology)|symmetric product]]'' of <math>n</math> copies of <math>X</math> means the quotient of <math>X^n</math>, the <math>n</math>-fold [[Cartesian product]] of <math>X</math> by the permutation action of the [[symmetric group]] on <math>n</math> strands operating on the indices of coordinates. That is, an ordered <math>n</math>-tuple is in the same [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]] as any other that is a re-ordered version of it.\n\nA path in the <math>n</math>-fold symmetric product is the abstract way of discussing <math>n</math> points of <math>X</math>, considered as an unordered <math>n</math>-tuple, independently tracing out <math>n</math> strings. Since we must require that the strings never pass through each other, it is necessary that we pass to the subspace <math>Y</math> of the symmetric product, of orbits of <math>n</math>-tuples of ''distinct'' points. That is, we remove all the subspaces of <math>X^n</math> defined by conditions <math>x_i = x_j</math> for all <math>1\\le i<j\\le n</math>. This is invariant under the symmetric group, and <math>Y</math> is the quotient by the symmetric group of the non-excluded <math>n</math>-tuples. Under the dimension condition <math>Y</math> will be connected.\n\nWith this definition, then, we can call '''the [[braid group]] of <math>X</math> with <math>n</math> strings''' the fundamental group of <math>Y</math> (for any choice of base point &ndash; this is well-defined [[up to]] isomorphism). The case where <math>X</math> is the Euclidean plane is the original one of Artin. In some cases it can be shown that the higher [[homotopy group]]s of <math>Y</math> are trivial.\n\n===Closed braids=== <!-- [[closed braid]] and [[closed braids]] redirect to this section. -->\n{{See also|Brunnian braid}}\nWhen ''X'' is the plane, the braid can be ''closed'', i.e., corresponding ends can be connected in pairs, to form a [[link (knot theory)|link]], i.e., a possibly intertwined union of possibly knotted loops in three dimensions. The number of components of the link can be anything from 1 to ''n'', depending on the permutation of strands determined by the link. A theorem of [[James Waddell Alexander II|J. W. Alexander]] demonstrates that every link can be obtained in this way as the \"closure\" of a braid. Compare with [[string links]].\n\nDifferent braids can give rise to the same link, just as different crossing diagrams can give rise to the same [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]. In 1935, [[Andrey Markov Jr.]] described two moves on braid diagrams that yield equivalence in the corresponding closed braids.<ref>{{citation| last = Markov | first = Andrey | author-link = Andrey Markov Jr.| journal = Recueil Mathématique de la Société Mathématique de Moscou| language = German, Russian| pages = 73–78| title = Über die freie Äquivalenz der geschlossenen Zöpfe| volume = 1| url = http://mi.mathnet.ru/msb5359| year = 1935}}</ref> A single-move version of Markov's theorem, was published by in 1997.<ref>{{citation| last1 = Lambropoulou | first1 = Sofia| last2 = Rourke | first2 = Colin P. | authorlink2=Colin P.

[[braid theory]]), an interpretation that was lost from view until it was rediscovered by [[Ralph Fox]] and Lee Neuwirth in 1962.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Ralph|author1-link=Ralph Fox|last2= Neuwirth|first2= Lee|title=The braid groups|journal=Mathematica Scandinavica|volume= 10|year= 1962|pages= 119–126|mr=0150755|doi=10.7146/math.scand.a-10518}}</ref>\n\n==Basic properties==\n\n===Generators and relations===\nConsider the following three braids:\n\n{|\n|-----\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:braid s1.png]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:braid s2.png]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[[File:braid s3.png]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n|-----\n<td><center><math>\\sigma_1</math></center>\n<td><center><math>\\sigma_2</math></center>\n<td><center><math>\\sigma_3</math></center>\n|}\n\nEvery braid in <math>B_4</math> can be written as a composition of a number of these braids and their inverses. In other words, these three braids [[generating set of a group|generate]] the group <math>B_4</math>.  To see this, an arbitrary braid is scanned from left to right for crossings; beginning at the top, whenever a crossing of strands <math>i</math> and <math>i+1</math> is encountered, <math>\\sigma_i</math> or <math>\\sigma_i^{-1}</math> is written down, depending on whether strand <math>i</math> moves under or over strand <math>i+1</math>. Upon reaching the right end, the braid has been written as a product of the <math>\\sigma</math>'s and their inverses.\n\nIt is clear that\n\n::(i) <math>\\sigma_1 \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_3 \\sigma_1</math>,\n\nwhile the following two relations are not quite as obvious:\n\n::(iia) <math>\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2</math>,\n::(iib) <math>\\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3</math>\n\n(these relations can be appreciated best by drawing the braid on a piece of paper).  It can be shown that all other relations among the braids <math>\\sigma_1</math>, <math>\\sigma_2</math> and <math>\\sigma_3</math> already follow from these relations and the group axioms.\n\nGeneralising this example to <math>n</math> strands, the group <math>B_n</math> can be abstractly defined via the following [[presentation of a group|presentation]]:\n\n:<math>B_n= \\left \\langle \\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_{n-1}| \\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i=\\sigma_{i+1}\\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+1}, \\sigma_i\\sigma_j=\\sigma_j\\sigma_i \\right \\rangle, </math>\n\nwhere in the first group of relations <math>1 \\le i\\le n-2</math> and in the second group of relations, <math>i-j\\ge 2</math>. This presentation leads to generalisations of braid groups called [[Artin group]]s. The cubic relations, known as the '''braid relations''', play an important role in the theory of [[Yang–Baxter equation]]s.\n\n===Further properties===\n* The braid group <math>B_1</math> is [[trivial group|trivial]], <math>B_2</math> is an infinite [[cyclic group]] <math>\\Z</math>, and <math>B_3</math> is isomorphic to the [[knot group]] of the [[trefoil knot]] – in particular, it is an infinite [[abelian group|non-abelian group]].\n* The {{math|''n''}}-strand braid group <math>B_n</math> embeds as a [[subgroup]] into the <math>(n+1)</math>-strand braid group <math>B_{n+1}</math> by adding an extra strand that does not cross any of the first {{math|''n''}} strands. The increasing union of the braid groups with all <math>n \\ge 1</math> is the '''infinite braid group''' <math>B_{\\infty}</math>.\n* All non-identity elements of <math>B_n</math> have infinite [[order (group theory)|order]]; i.e., <math>B_n</math> is [[torsion (algebra)|torsion-free]].\n*There is a left-invariant [[linear order]] on <math>B_n</math> called the [[Dehornoy order]].\n* For <math>n\\ge 3</math>, <math>B_n</math> contains a subgroup isomorphic to the [[free group]] on two generators.\n* There is a [[group homomorphism|homomorphism]] <math>B_n \\to \\Z</math> defined by {{math|σ<sub>''i''</sub> ↦ 1}}. So for instance, the braid {{math|σ<sub>2</sub>σ<sub>3</sub>σ<sub>1</sub><sup>−1</sup>σ<sub>2</sub>σ<sub>3</sub>}} is mapped to {{math|1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;−&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 {{=}} 3}}. This map corresponds to the [[abelianization]] of the braid group.\n\n==Interactions==\n\n===Relation with symmetric group and the pure braid group===\nBy forgetting how the strands twist and cross, every braid on {{math|''n''}} strands determines a [[permutation]] on {{math|''n''}} elements. This assignment is onto, compatible with composition, and therefore becomes a [[surjective]] [[group homomorphism]] {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>'' → ''S<sub>n</sub>''}} from the braid group into the [[symmetric group]]. The image of the braid σ<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} is the transposition {{math|''s''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} (''i'', ''i''+1) ∈ ''S<sub>n</sub>''}}. These transpositions generate the symmetric group, satisfy the braid group relations, and have order 2. This transforms the Artin presentation of the braid group into the [[Coxeter group|Coxeter presentation]] of the symmetric group:\n\n:<math>S_n = \\left \\langle s_1,\\ldots,s_{n-1}| s_i s_{i+1} s_i=s_{i+1} s_i s_{i+1}, s_i s_j = s_j s_i \\text{ for } |i-j|\\geq 2, s_i^2=1 \\right\\rangle. </math>\n\nThe [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of the homomorphism {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>'' → ''S<sub>n</sub>''}} is the subgroup of {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} called the '''pure braid group on {{math|''n''}} strands''' and denoted {{math|''P<sub>n</sub>''}}. In a pure braid, the beginning and the end of each strand are in the same position. Pure braid groups fit into a [[short exact sequence]]\n\n: <math>1\\to F_{n-1} \\to P_n \\to P_{n-1}\\to 1.</math>\n\nThis sequence splits and therefore pure braid groups are realized as iterated [[semidirect product|semi-direct products]] of free groups.\n\n===Relation between <math>B_3</math> and the modular group===\n[[File:Braid-modular-group-cover.svg|thumb|376px|<math>B_3</math> is the [[universal central extension]] of the modular group.]]\n\nThe braid group <math>B_3</math> is the [[universal central extension]] of the [[modular group]] <math>\\mathrm{PSL}(2, \\Z)</math>, with these sitting as lattices inside the (topological) universal covering group\n\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\R)} \\to \\mathrm{PSL}(2,\\R)</math>.\n\nFurthermore, the modular group has trivial center, and thus the modular group is isomorphic to the [[quotient group]] of <math>B_3</math> modulo its [[center (group theory)|center]], <math>Z(B_3),</math> and equivalently, to the group of [[inner automorphism]]s of <math>B_3</math>.\n\nHere is a construction of this [[isomorphic|isomorphism]]. Define\n\n:<math>a = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1, \\quad b = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2</math>.\n\nFrom the braid relations it follows that <math>a^2 = b^3</math>. Denoting this latter product as <math>c</math>, one may verify from the braid relations that\n\n:<math>\\sigma_1 c \\sigma_1^{-1} = \\sigma_2 c \\sigma_2^{-1}=c</math>\n\nimplying that <math>c</math> is in the center of <math>B_3</math>. Let <math>C</math> denote the [[subgroup]] of <math>B_3</math> [[group generator|generated]] by {{math|''c''}}, since {{math|''C''&nbsp;⊂&nbsp;''Z''(''B''<sub>3</sub>)}}, it is a [[normal subgroup]] and one may take the [[quotient group]] {{math|''B''<sub>3</sub>/''C''}}. We claim {{math|''B''<sub>3</sub>/''C'' ≅ PSL(2, '''Z''')}}; this isomorphism can be given an explicit form. The [[coset]]s {{math|σ<sub>1</sub>''C''}} and {{math|σ<sub>2</sub>''C''}} map to\n\n:<math>\\sigma_1C \\mapsto R=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\sigma_2C \\mapsto L^{-1}=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''L''}} and {{math|''R''}} are the standard left and right moves on the [[Stern–Brocot tree]]; it is well known that these moves generate the modular group.\n\nAlternately, one common [[presentation of a group|presentation]] for the modular group is\n\n:<math>\\langle v,p\\, |\\, v^2=p^3=1\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>v=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\qquad p=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nMapping {{math|''a''}} to {{math|''v''}} and {{math|''b''}} to {{math|''p''}} yields a surjective group homomorphism {{math|''B''<sub>3</sub> → PSL(2, '''Z''')}}.\n\nThe center of {{math|''B''<sub>3</sub>}} is equal to {{math|''C''}}, a consequence of the facts that {{math|''c''}} is in the center, the modular group has trivial center, and the above surjective homomorphism has [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] {{math|''C''}}.\n\n===Relationship to the mapping class group and classification of braids===\nThe braid group {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} can be shown to be isomorphic to the [[mapping class group]] of a [[punctured disk]] with {{math|''n''}} punctures. This is most easily visualized by imagining each puncture as being connected by a string to the boundary of the disk; each mapping homomorphism that permutes two of the punctures can then be seen to be a homotopy of the strings, that is, a braiding of these strings.\n\nVia this mapping class group interpretation of braids, each braid may be classified as [[Nielsen-Thurston classification|periodic, reducible or pseudo-Anosov]].\n\n===Connection to knot theory===\nIf a braid is given and one connects the first left-hand item to the first right-hand item using a new string, the second left-hand item to the second right-hand item etc. (without creating any braids in the new strings), one obtains a [[link (knot theory)|link]], and sometimes a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]]. [[Alexander's theorem]] in [[braid theory]] states that the converse is true as well: every [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] and every [[link (knot theory)|link]] arises in this fashion from at least one braid; such a braid can be obtained by cutting the link. Since braids can be concretely given as words in the generators {{math|σ<sub>''i''</sub>}}, this is often the preferred method of entering knots into computer programs.\n\n=== Computational aspects ===\nThe [[word problem for groups|word problem]] for the braid relations is efficiently solvable and there exists a [[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal form]] for elements of {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} in terms of the generators {{math|σ<sub>1</sub>, ..., σ<sub>''n''−1</sub>}}. (In essence, computing the normal form of a braid is the algebraic analogue of \"pulling the strands\" as illustrated in our second set of images above.) The free [[GAP (computer algebra system)|GAP computer algebra system]] can carry out computations in {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} if the elements are given in terms of these generators. There is also a package called ''CHEVIE'' for GAP3 with special support for braid groups. The word problem is also efficiently solved via the [[Lawrence–Krammer representation]].\n\nIn addition to the word problem, there are several known hard computational problems that could implement braid groups, applications in [[cryptography]] have been suggested.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Actions==\nIn analogy with the action of the symmetric group by permutations, in various mathematical settings there exists a natural action of the braid group on {{math|''n''}}-tuples of objects or on the {{math|''n''}}-folded [[tensor product]] that involves some \"twists\". Consider an arbitrary group {{math|''G''}} and let {{math|''X''}} be the set of all {{math|''n''}}-tuples of elements of {{math|''G''}} whose product is the [[identity element]] of {{math|''G''}}. Then {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on {{math|''X''}} in the following fashion:\n\n: <math> \\sigma_i \\left (x_1,\\ldots,x_{i-1},x_i, x_{i+1},\\ldots, x_n \\right)= \\left (x_1,\\ldots, x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, x_{i+1}^{-1}x_i x_{i+1}, x_{i+2},\\ldots,x_n \\right ). </math>\n\nThus the elements {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} and {{math|''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>}} exchange places and, in addition, {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>''}} is twisted by the [[inner automorphism]] corresponding to {{math|''x''<sub>''i''+1</sub>}} — this ensures that the product of the components  of {{math|''x''}} remains the identity element. It may be checked that the braid group relations are satisfied and this formula indeed defines a group action of {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} on {{math|''X''}}. As another example, a [[braided monoidal category]] is a [[monoidal category]] with a braid group action. Such structures play an important role in modern [[mathematical physics]] and lead to quantum [[knot invariant]]s.\n\n===Representations===\nElements of the braid group {{math|''B<sub>n</sub>''}} can be represented more concretely by matrices. One classical such [[group representation|representation]] is [[Burau representation]], where the matrix entries are single variable [[Laurent polynomial]]s. It had been a long-standing question whether Burau representation was [[faithful representation|faithful]], but the answer turned out to be negative for {{math|''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;5}}. More generally, it was a major open problem whether braid groups were [[linear group|linear]]. In 1990, [[Ruth Lawrence]] described a family of more general \"Lawrence representations\" depending on several parameters. In 1996, Chetan Nayak and [[Frank Wilczek]] posited that in analogy to projective representations of {{math|SO(3)}}, the projective representations of the braid group have a physical meaning for certain quasiparticles in the [[fractional quantum hall effect]]. Around 2001 [[Stephen Bigelow]] and Daan Krammer independently proved that all braid groups are linear. Their work used the [[Lawrence–Krammer representation]] of dimension <math>n(n-1)/2</math> depending on the variables {{math|''q''}} and {{math|''t''}}. By suitably specializing these variables, the braid group <math>B_n</math> may be realized as a subgroup of the [[general linear group]] over the [[complex numbers]].\n\n==Infinitely generated braid groups==\nThere are many ways to generalize this notion to an infinite number of strands.  The simplest way is to take the [[direct limit]] of braid groups, where the attaching maps <math>f \\colon B_n \\to B_{n+1}</math> send the <math>n-1</math> generators of <math>B_{n}</math> to the first <math>n-1</math>  generators of <math>B_{n+1}</math> (i.e., by attaching a trivial strand). Paul Fabel has shown that there are two [[topological space|topologies]] that can be imposed on the resulting group each of whose [[complete metric space|completion]] yields a different group. One is a very tame group and is isomorphic to the [[mapping class group]] of the infinitely punctured disk&mdash;a discrete set of punctures limiting to the boundary of the [[unit disk|disk]].\n\nThe second group can be thought of the same as with finite braid groups.  Place a strand at each of the points <math>(0, 1/n)</math> and the set of all braids&mdash;where a braid is defined to be a collection of paths from the points <math>(0, 1/n, 0)</math> to the points <math>(0, 1/n, 1)</math> so that the function yields a permutation on endpoints&mdash;is isomorphic to this wilder group.  An interesting fact is that the pure braid group in this group is isomorphic to both the [[inverse limit]] of finite pure braid groups <math>P_n</math> and to the [[fundamental group]] of the [[Hilbert cube]] minus the set\n:<math>\\{(x_i)_{i\\in \\mathbb{N}} \\mid x_i=x_j\\text{ for some }i\\ne j\\}.</math>\n\n==Cohomology==\n{{See also|Configuration space (mathematics)#Connection to braid groups}}\n\nThe [[Group cohomology|cohomology of a group]] <math>G</math> is defined as the cohomology of the corresponding [[Eilenberg–MacLane space|Eilenberg–MacLane]] [[classifying space]], <math>K(G, 1)</math>, which is a [[CW complex]] uniquely determined by <math>G</math> up to homotopy.

The Brauer algebra has dimension (2''n'')!/2<sup>''n''</sup>''n''! = (2''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)(2''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;3)&nbsp;···&nbsp;5·3·1 and has a basis consisting of all pairings on a set of 2''n'' elements ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''Y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''Y''<sub>''n''</sub> (that is, all [[perfect matching]]s of a [[complete graph]] ''K''<sub>2''n''</sub>: any two of the 2''n'' elements may be matched to each other, regardless of their symbols). The elements ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> are usually written in a row, with the elements ''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> beneath them.  The product of two basis elements ''A'' and ''B'' is obtained by first identifying the endpoints in the bottom row of  ''A '' and the top row of  ''B '' (Figure  ''AB '' in the diagram), then deleting the endpoints in the middle row and joining endpoints in the remaining two rows if they are joined, directly or by a path, in  ''AB '' (Figure  ''AB=nn '' in the diagram).\n\n==The orthogonal group==\nIf ''O''<sub>''d''</sub>('''R''')  is the orthogonal group acting on ''V'' = '''R'''<sup>''d''</sup>, then \nthe Brauer algebra has a natural action on the space of polynomials on ''V''<sup>''n''</sup> commuting with the action of the orthogonal group.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Birman–Wenzl algebra]], a deformation of the Brauer algebra.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Brauer | first1=Richard | authorlink = Richard Brauer | title=On Algebras Which are Connected with the Semisimple Continuous Groups | jstor=1968843 | publisher=Annals of Mathematics | series=Second Series | year=1937 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] | issn=0003-486X | volume=38 | issue=4 | pages=857–872 | doi=10.2307/1968843}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Wenzl | first1=Hans | title=On the structure of Brauer's centralizer algebras | jstor=1971466 | mr=951511 | year=1988 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=128 | issue=1 | pages=173–193 | doi=10.2307/1971466}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Weyl | first1=Hermann | author1-link=Hermann Weyl | title=The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and Representations | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmzKSP2xTtYC | accessdate=03/2007/26 | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | isbn=978-0-691-05756-9 | mr=0000255 | year=1946}}\n\n[[Category:Representation theory]]\n[[Category:Diagram algebras]]"

      "text": "'''Skein relations''' are a mathematical tool used to study [[knot (mathematics)|knots]]. A central question in the [[knot theory|mathematical theory of knots]] is whether two [[knot diagram]]s represent the same knot. One way to answer the question is using [[knot polynomial]]s, which are [[knot invariant|invariants of the knot]]. If two diagrams have different [[polynomial]]s, they represent different knots. In general, the [[converse (logic)|converse]] does not hold.\n\nSkein relations are often used to give a simple definition of knot polynomials. A skein relation gives a linear relation between the values of a knot polynomial on a collection of three [[link (knot theory)|links]] which differ from each other only in a small region. For some knot polynomials, such as the [[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway]], [[Alexander polynomial|Alexander]], and [[Jones polynomial]]s, the relevant skein relations are sufficient to calculate the polynomial [[Recursion|recursively]]. For others, such as the [[HOMFLYPT polynomial]], more complicated algorithms are necessary.\n\n==Definition==\nA skein relationship requires three link diagrams that are identical except at one crossing. The three diagrams must exhibit the three possibilities that could occur for the two line segments at that crossing, one of the lines could pass  ''under,'' the same line could be ''over'' or the two lines might not cross at all. Link diagrams must be considered because a single skein change can alter a diagram from representing a knot to one representing a link and vice versa. Depending on the knot polynomial in question, the links (or tangles) appearing in a skein relation may be oriented or unoriented.\n\n<!--Funny, I was right the first time, then thought too much =p-->\nThe three diagrams are labelled as follows. Turn the three link diagram so the directions at the crossing in question are both roughly northward. One diagram will have northwest over northeast, it is labelled ''L''<sub>−</sub>. Another will have northeast over northwest, it's ''L''<sub>+</sub>. The remaining diagram is lacking that crossing and is labelled ''L''<sub>0</sub>.\n:[[File:skein-relation-patches.png]]\n(The labelling is actually independent of direction insofar as it remains the same if all directions are reversed. Thus polynomials on undirected knots are unambiguously defined by this method. However, the directions on ''links'' are a vital detail to retain as one recurses through a polynomial calculation.)\n\nIt is also sensible to think in a generative sense, by taking an existing link diagram and \"patching\" it to make the other two&mdash;just so long as the patches are applied with compatible directions.\n\nTo recursively define a knot (link) polynomial, a function ''F'' is fixed and for any triple of diagrams and their polynomials labelled as above,\n:<math>F\\Big(L_-,L_0,L_+\\Big)=0</math>\nor more pedantically\n:<math>F\\Big(L_-(x),L_0(x),L_+(x),x\\Big)=0</math> for all <math>x</math>\n(Finding an ''F'' which produces polynomials independent of the sequences of crossings used in a recursion is no trivial exercise.)\n\nMore formally, a skein relation can be thought of as defining the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a [[quotient map]] from the [[planar algebra]] of [[tangle (mathematics)|tangles]]. Such a map corresponds to a knot polynomial if all closed diagrams are taken to some (polynomial) multiple of the image of the empty diagram.\n\n==Example==\nSometime in the early 1960s, [[John Horton Conway|Conway]] showed how to compute the Alexander polynomial using skein relations.  As it is [[recursion|recursive]], it is not quite so direct as Alexander's original [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] method; on the other hand, parts of the work done for one knot will apply to others. In particular, the network of diagrams is the same for all skein-related polynomials.\n\nLet function ''P'' from link diagrams to [[Laurent series]] in <math>\\sqrt x</math> be\nsuch that <math>P({\\rm unknot})=1</math> and a triple of skein-relation diagrams <math>(L_-, L_0, L_+)</math> satisfies the equation\n:<math>P(L_-) = (x^{-1/2}-x^{1/2})P(L_0) + P(L_+)</math>\nThen ''P'' maps a knot to one of its Alexander polynomials.\n\nIn this example, we calculate the Alexander polynomial of the [[cinquefoil knot]] ([[File:skein-relation-cinquefoil-plus-sm.png]]), the [[alternating knot]] with five crossings in its minimal diagram. At each stage we exhibit a relationship involving a more complex link and two simpler diagrams.  Note that the more complex link is on the right in each step below except the last. For convenience, let ''A'' = ''x''<sup>−1/2</sup>−x<sup>1/2</sup>.\n\nTo begin, we create two new diagrams by patching one of the cinquefoil's crossings (highlighted in yellow) so\n\n:''P''([[File:skein-relation-cinquefoil-minus-sm.png]]) = ''A'' × ''P''([[File:skein-relation-cinquefoil-zero-sm.png]]) + ''P''([[File:skein-relation-cinquefoil-plus-sm.png]])\n\nThe first diagram is actually a trefoil; the second diagram is two unknots with four crossings. Patching the latter\n\n:''P''([[File:skein-relation-link24-minus-sm.png]]) = ''A'' × ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link24-zero-sm.png]]) + ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link24-plus-sm.png]])\n\ngives, again, a trefoil, and two unknots with ''two'' crossings (the [[Hopf link]] [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HopfLink.html]). Patching the trefoil\n\n:''P''([[File:skein-relation-trefoil-minus-sm.png]]) = ''A'' × ''P''([[File:skein-relation-trefoil-zero-sm.png]]) + ''P''([[File:skein-relation-trefoil-plus-sm.png]])\n\ngives the unknot and, again, the Hopf link. Patching the Hopf link\n\n:''P''([[File:skein-relation-link22-minus-sm.png]]) = ''A'' × ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link22-zero-sm.png]]) + ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link22-plus-sm.png]])\n\ngives a link with 0 crossings (unlink) and an unknot. The unlink takes a bit of sneakiness:\n\n:''P''([[File:skein-relation-link20-minus-sm.png]]) = ''A'' × ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link20-zero-sm.png]]) + ''P''([[File:skein-relation-link20-plus-sm.png]])\n\n===Computations===\nWe now have enough relations to compute the polynomials of all the links we've encountered, and can use the above equations in reverse order to work up to the cinquefoil knot itself. The calculation is described in the table below, where '''?''' denotes the unknown quantity we are solving for in each relation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | knot name\n! rowspan=2 | diagrams\n! colspan=3 | ''P'' (diagram)\n|-\n! skein equation\n!

The points indicate the existence of an attribute described by the intersection of contours in the Euler diagram. These points may be joined together forming a shape like a [[spider]].

      "text": "[[Image:Spin network.svg|right|thumb|200px|Simple spin network of the type used in [[loop quantum gravity]]]]\n\nIn [[physics]], a '''spin network''' is a type of diagram which can be used to represent [[Quantum state|states]] and interactions between [[Particle physics|particles]] and [[Quantum field theory|fields]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. From a [[mathematical]] perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent [[multilinear function]]s and functions between [[representation theory|representations]] of [[matrix group]]s. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. \n\n[[Roger Penrose]] is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971,<ref name=Penrose71/> although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before his time. Spin networks have been applied to the theory of [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] by [[Carlo Rovelli]], [[Lee Smolin]], [[Jorge Pullin]], [[Rodolfo Gambini]] and others. \n\nSpin networks can also be used to construct a particular [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[connection (mathematics)|connections]] which is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== Penrose's original definition ===\nA spin network, as described in Penrose (1971),<ref name=Penrose71>R. Penrose (1971a), \"Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial spacetime,\" in T. Bastin (ed.), ''Quantum Theory and Beyond'', Cambridge University Press (this paper can be found online on [[John C. Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/penrose/ website]); and R. Penrose (1971b), \"Applications of negative dimensional tensors,\" in D. J. A. Welsh (ed.), ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'' ([[Proceedings|Proc.]] [[Academic conference|Conf.]], Oxford, 1969), Academic Press, pp. 221–244, esp. p. 241 (the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to Roger Penrose, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tweb/00001/#05 \"On the Origins of Twistor Theory\"] in: ''Gravitation and Geometry, a Volume in Honour of [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|I. Robinson]]'', Biblipolis, Naples 1987).</ref> is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the [[world line]] of a \"unit\" (either an [[elementary particle]] or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called ''closed spin networks''. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations.\n\nEach line segment is labelled with an integer called a [[spin number]]. A unit with spin number ''n'' is called an ''n''-unit and has [[angular momentum]] ''nħ/2'', where ''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. For [[boson]]s, such as [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s, ''n'' is an even number. For [[fermion]]s, such as [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s, ''n'' is odd.\n\nGiven any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the ''norm'' of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the [[probabilities]] of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. Then, these requirements are stated as:\n* [[Triangle inequality]]: ''a'' must be less than or equal to ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''c'', and ''c'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''b''.\n* Fermion conservation: ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be an even number.\nFor example, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 9 is impossible since 9 > 3 + 4. However, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. \nSome conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be a whole number.\n\n=== Formal definition ===\nMore formally, a spin network is a (directed) [[graph theory|graph]] whose [[graph theory|edges]] are associated with [[Irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[Representations of Lie groups/algebras|representations]] of a [[Compact group|compact]] [[Lie group]] and whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are associated with [[intertwiner#Representation_theory|intertwiner]]s of the edge representations adjacent to it.\n\nA spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on this manifold. One computes [[holonomy|holonomies]] of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.\n\n== Usage in physics ==\n\n=== In the context of loop quantum gravity ===\nIn [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG), a spin network represents a \"quantum state\" of the [[gravitational field]] on a 3-dimensional [[hypersurface]]. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, \"[[s-knot]]s\"{{snd}}that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under [[diffeomorphisms]]) is [[countable]]<!-- inaccurate - diffeomorphism class? -->; it constitutes a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of LQG [[Hilbert space]].\n\nOne of the key results of loop quantum gravity is [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of areas: the operator of the area ''A'' of a two-dimensional surface Σ should have a discrete [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]]. Every '''spin network''' is an [[eigenstate]] of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals\n\n:<math>A_{\\Sigma} = 8\\pi \\ell_\\text{PL}^2\\gamma\n\\sum_i  \\sqrt{j_i(j_i+1)}</math>\n\nwhere the sum goes over all intersections ''i'' of Σ with the spin network. In this formula,\n*{{ell}}<sub>PL</sub> is the [[Planck length]],\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is the [[Immirzi parameter]] and\n*''j<sub>i</sub>'' = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] associated with the link ''i'' of the spin network.  The two-dimensional area is therefore \"concentrated\" in the intersections with the spin network.\n\nAccording to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an [[Immirzi parameter]] on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10<sup>−66</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models.  Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator ''A'' are constrained by [[ladder symmetry]].\n\nSimilar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of 3D submanifold that contains part of spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary \"quantum of volume\" and every link is a \"quantum of area\" surrounding this volume.\n\n=== More general gauge theories ===\nSimilar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a [[connection form]]. This is actually an exact [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] over a lattice. Over a [[manifold]] however, assumptions like [[diffeomorphism invariance]] are needed to make the duality exact (smearing [[Wilson loop]]s is tricky). Later, it was generalized by [[Robert Oeckl]] to representations of [[quantum group]]s in 2 and 3 dimensions using the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]].\n\n[[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] have also defined [[string-net]]s using [[tensor category|tensor categories]] that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. [[String-net condensation]] produces [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states in condensed matter.\n\n== Usage in mathematics ==\nIn mathematics, spin networks have been used to study [[skein module]]s and [[character variety|character varieties]], which correspond to spaces of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Spin networks}}\n*[[Character variety]]\n*[[Penrose graphical notation]]\n*[[Spin foam]]\n*[[String-net]]\n*[[Trace diagram]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n=== Early papers ===\n*I.

      "text": "[[Image:trace diagram adjugate.png|right|thumb|150px|A trace diagram representing the [[adjugate matrix|adjugate of a matrix]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], '''trace diagrams''' are a graphical means of performing computations in [[linear algebra|linear]] and [[multilinear algebra]]. They can be represented as (slightly modified) [[graph theory|graphs]] in which some edges are labeled by [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The simplest trace diagrams represent the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and [[determinant]] of a matrix. Several results in linear algebra, such as [[Cramer's Rule]] and the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], have simple diagrammatic proofs. They are closely related to [[Penrose's graphical notation]].\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\nLet ''V'' be a [[vector space]] of [[vector space|dimension]] ''n'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' (with ''n''≥2), and let Fun(''V'',''V'') denote the [[linear transformation]]s on ''V''. An ''' ''n''-trace diagram''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] <math>\\mathcal{D}=(V_1\\sqcup V_2\\sqcup V_n, E)</math>, where the sets ''V''<sub>''i''</sub> (''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;''n'') are composed of [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] ''i'', together with the following additional structures:\n* a ''ciliation'' at each vertex in the graph, which is an explicit ordering of the adjacent edges at that vertex;\n* a labeling ''V''<sub>2</sub> → Fun(''V'',''V'') associating each degree-2 vertex to a linear transformation.\nNote that ''V''<sub>2</sub> and ''V<sub>n</sub>'' should be considered as distinct sets in the case&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. A '''framed trace diagram''' is a trace diagram together with a partition of the degree-1 vertices ''V''<sub>1</sub> into two disjoint ordered collections called the ''inputs'' and the ''outputs''.\n\nThe \"graph\" underlying a trace diagram may have the following special features, which are not always included in the standard definition of a graph:\n* [[Loop (graph theory)|Loops]] are permitted (a loop is an edge that connects a vertex to itself).\n* Edges that have no vertices are permitted, and are represented by small circles.\n* Multiple edges between the same two vertices are permitted.\n\n=== Drawing conventions ===\n\n* When trace diagrams are drawn, the ciliation on an ''n''-vertex is commonly represented by a small mark between two of the incident edges (in the figure above, a small red dot); the specific ordering of edges follows by proceeding counter-clockwise from this mark.\n* The ciliation and labeling at a degree-2 vertex are combined into a single directed node that allows one to differentiate the first edge (the ''incoming'' edge) from the second edge (the ''outgoing'' edge).\n* Framed diagrams are drawn with ''inputs'' at the bottom of the diagram and ''outputs'' at the top of the diagram. In both cases, the ordering corresponds to reading from left to right.\n\n=== Correspondence with multilinear functions ===\n\nEvery framed trace diagram corresponds to a [[multilinear]] function between [[tensor]] powers of the vector space ''V''. The degree-1 vertices correspond to the inputs and outputs of the function, while the degree-''n'' vertices correspond to the generalized [[Levi-Civita symbol]] (which is an [[anti-symmetric tensor]] related to the [[determinant]]). If a diagram has no output strands, its function maps tensor products to a scalar. If there are no degree-1 vertices, the diagram is said to be '''closed''' and its corresponding function may be identified with a scalar.\n\nBy definition, a trace diagram's function is computed using [[signed graph]] coloring. For each [[edge coloring]] of the graph's edges by ''n'' labels, so that no two edges adjacent to the same vertex have the same label, one assigns a ''weight'' based on the labels at the vertices and the labels adjacent to the matrix labels. These weights become the coefficients of the diagram's function.\n\nIn practice, a trace diagram's function is typically computed by ''decomposing'' the diagram into smaller pieces whose functions are known. The overall function can then be computed by re-composing the individual functions.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== 3-Vector diagrams ===\nSeveral [[vector identities]] have easy proofs using trace diagrams. This section covers 3-trace diagrams. In the translation of diagrams to functions, it can be shown that the positions of ciliations at the degree-3 vertices has no influence on the resulting function, so they may be omitted.\n\nIt can be shown that the [[cross product]] and [[dot product]] of 3-dimensional vectors are represented by\n\n:[[Image:Trace diagram vector product definitions.png|300px]]\n\nIn this picture, the inputs to the function are shown as vectors in yellow boxes at the bottom of the diagram. The cross product diagram has an output vector, represented by the free strand at the top of the diagram. The dot product diagram does not have an output vector; hence, its output is a scalar.\n\nAs a first example, consider the scalar triple product identity\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{u}\\times\\mathbf{v})\\cdot\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{u}\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{w})=(\\mathbf{w}\\times\\mathbf{u})\\cdot\\mathbf{v}=\\det(\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{v}\\mathbf{w}).</math>\n\nTo prove this diagrammatically, note that all of the following figures are different depictions of the same 3-trace diagram (as specified by the above definition):\n\n:[[File:Trace diagram triple product identity.png|350px]]\n\nCombining the above diagrams for the cross product and the dot product, one can read off the three leftmost diagrams as precisely the three leftmost scalar triple products in the above identity. It can also be shown that the rightmost diagram represents det['''u''' '''v''' '''w''']. The scalar triple product identity follows because each is a different representation of the same diagram's function.\n\nAs a second example, one can show that\n:[[File:Trace diagram 3 binor identity.png|100px]]\n(where the equality indicates that the identity holds for the underlying multilinear functions). One can show that this kind of identity does not change by \"bending\" the diagram or attaching more diagrams, provided the changes are consistent across all diagrams in the identity. Thus, one can bend the top of the diagram down to the bottom, and attach vectors to each of the free edges, to obtain\n:[[File:Trace diagram quadruple product identity.png|350px]]\nwhich reads\n:<math>(\\mathbf{x}\\times\\mathbf{u})\\cdot(\\mathbf{v}\\times\\mathbf{w})=(\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{v})(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{w})-(\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{w})(\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}),</math>\na well-known identity relating four 3-dimensional vectors.\n\n=== Diagrams with matrices ===\n\nThe simplest closed diagrams with a single matrix label correspond to the coefficients of the [[characteristic polynomial]], up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension of the matrix. One representation of these diagrams is shown below, where <math>\\propto</math> is used to indicate equality up to a scalar factor that depends only on the dimension ''n'' of the underlying vector space.\n\n:[[File:Trace diagram invariant diagrams.png|600px]].\n\n== Properties ==\n\nLet ''G'' be the group of n×n matrices. If a closed trace diagram is labeled by ''k'' different matrices, it may be interpreted as a function from <math>G^k</math> to an algebra of multilinear functions. This function is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under simultaneous [[conjugacy class|conjugation]], that is, the function corresponding to <math>(g_1,\\ldots,g_k)</math> is the same as the function corresponding to <math>(a g_1 a^{-1}, \\ldots, a g_k a^{-1})</math> for any invertible <math>a\\in G</math>.\n\n== Extensions and applications ==\n\nTrace diagrams may be specialized for particular [[Lie groups]] by altering the definition slightly. In this context, they are sometimes called [[birdtracks]], [[Penrose graphical notation|tensor diagrams]], or [[Penrose graphical notation]].\n\nTrace diagrams have primarily been used by physicists as a tool for studying [[Lie groups]]. The most common applications use [[representation theory]] to construct [[spin network]]s from trace diagrams. In mathematics, they have been used to study [[character variety|character varieties]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Multilinear map]]\n*[[Gain graph]]\n\n== References ==\n\nBooks:\n\n* ''Diagram Techniques in Group Theory'', G.

      "text": "{{about|a particular structure known as a non-associative algebra|non-associativity in general|Non-associativity}}\nA '''non-associative algebra'''{{sfn|Schafer|1995|loc=Chapter 1}} (or '''distributive algebra''') is an [[algebra over a field]] where the [[binary operation|binary multiplication operation]] is not assumed to be [[associative operation|associative]]. That is, an [[algebraic structure]] ''A'' is a non-associative algebra over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'' if it is a [[vector space]] over ''K'' and is equipped with a ''K''-[[bilinear map|bilinear]] binary multiplication operation ''A'' × ''A'' → ''A'' which may or may not be associative. Examples include [[Lie algebra]]s, [[Jordan algebra]]s, the [[octonion]]s, and three-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with the [[cross product]] operation. Since it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative, using parentheses to indicate the order of multiplications is necessary. For example, the expressions (''ab'')(''cd''), (''a''(''bc''))''d'' and ''a''(''b''(''cd'')) may all yield different answers.\n\nWhile this use of ''non-associative'' means that associativity is not assumed, it does not mean that associativity is disallowed. In other words, \"non-associative\" means \"not necessarily associative\", just as \"noncommutative\" means \"not necessarily commutative\" for [[noncommutative ring]]s.\n\nAn algebra is ''[[unital algebra|unital]]'' or ''unitary'' if it has an [[identity element]] ''I'' with ''Ix'' = ''x'' = ''xI'' for all ''x'' in the algebra. For example, the [[octonion]]s are unital, but [[Lie algebra]]s never are.\n\nThe nonassociative algebra structure of ''A'' may be studied by associating it with other associative algebras which are subalgebra of the full algebra of ''K''-[[endomorphisms]] of ''A'' as a ''K''-vector space.  Two such are the '''[[derivation algebra]]''' and the '''(associative) enveloping algebra''', the latter being in a sense \"the smallest associative algebra containing ''A''\".\n\nMore generally, some authors consider the concept of a non-associative algebra over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'': An [[Module (mathematics)|''R''-module]] equipped with an ''R''-bilinear binary multiplication operation.{{sfn|Schafer|1995|loc=pp.1}} If a structure obeys all of the ring axioms apart from associativity (for example, any ''R''-algebra), then it is naturally a <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-algebra, so some authors refer to non-associative <math>\\mathbb{Z}</math>-algebras as '''non-associative rings'''.\n\n{{Algebraic structures |Algebra}}\n\n== Algebras satisfying identities ==\n\nRing-like structures with two binary operations and no other restrictions are a broad class, one which is too general to study. For this reason, the best-known kinds of non-associative algebras satisfy [[identity (mathematics)|identities]] which simplify multiplication somewhat. These include the following identities.\n\nIn the list, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' denote arbitrary elements of an algebra.\n* [[Associativity|Associative]]:  (''xy'')''z'' = ''x''(''yz'').\n* [[Commutativity|Commutative]]:  ''xy'' = ''yx''.\n* [[Anticommutative]]:<ref name=Sch3>{{harvnb|Schafer|1995|p=3}}</ref> ''xy'' = −''yx''.<ref>This is always implied by the identity ''xx'' = 0 for all ''x'', and the converse holds for fields of characteristic other than two.</ref>\n* [[Jacobi identity]]:<ref name=Sch3/><ref name=Oku12>{{harvnb|Okubo|2005|p=12}}</ref> (''xy'')''z'' + (''yz'')''x'' + (''zx'')''y'' = 0. \n* [[Jordan identity]]:<ref name=Sch91>{{harvnb|Schafer|1995|p=91}}</ref><ref name=Oku13>{{harvnb|Okubo|2005|p=13}}</ref> (''xy'')(''x''<sup>2</sup>) = ''x''(''y''(''x''<sup>2</sup>)).\n* [[Power associative]]:<ref name=Sch30>{{harvnb|Schafer|1995|p=30}}</ref><ref name=Oku17>{{harvnb|Okubo|2005|p=17}}</ref><ref name=KMRT451/> For all ''x'', any three nonnegative powers of ''x'' associate.

It turns out that for elements of ''C(A)'' it is enough that two of the sets <math>([n,A,A], [A,n,A] , [A,A,n])</math> are <math>\\{0\\}</math> for the third to also be the zero set.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>3</sup> with multiplication given by the [[vector cross product]] is an example of an algebra which is anticommutative and not associative. The cross product also satisfies the Jacobi identity.\n* [[Lie algebra]]s are algebras satisfying anticommutativity and the Jacobi identity.\n* Algebras of [[vector field]]s on a [[differentiable manifold]] (if ''K'' is '''R''' or the [[complex number]]s '''C''') or an [[algebraic variety]] (for general ''K'');\n* [[Jordan algebra]]s are algebras which satisfy the commutative law and the Jordan identity.<ref name=Oku13/>\n* Every associative algebra gives rise to a Lie algebra by using the [[commutator]] as Lie bracket. In fact every Lie algebra can either be constructed this way, or is a subalgebra of a Lie algebra so constructed.\n* Every associative algebra over a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] other than 2 gives rise to a Jordan algebra by defining a new multiplication ''x*y'' = (1/2)(''xy'' + ''yx''). In contrast to the Lie algebra case, not every Jordan algebra can be constructed this way. Those that can are called ''special''.\n* [[Alternative algebra]]s are algebras satisfying the alternative property. The most important examples of alternative algebras are the [[octonions]] (an algebra over the reals), and generalizations of the octonions over other fields. All associative algebras are alternative. Up to isomorphism, the only finite-dimensional real alternative, division algebras (see below) are the reals, complexes, quaternions and octonions.\n* [[Power-associative algebra]]s, are those algebras satisfying the power-associative identity. Examples include all associative algebras, all alternative algebras, Jordan algebras, and the [[sedenion]]s.\n* The [[hyperbolic quaternion]] algebra over '''R''', which was an experimental algebra before the adoption of [[Minkowski space]] for [[special relativity]].\n\nMore classes of algebras:\n\n* [[Graded algebra]]s. These include most of the algebras of interest to [[multilinear algebra]], such as the [[tensor algebra]], [[symmetric algebra]], and [[exterior algebra]] over a given [[vector space]]. Graded algebras can be generalized to [[filtered algebra]]s.\n* [[Division algebra]]s, in which multiplicative inverses exist. The finite-dimensional alternative division algebras over the field of real numbers have been classified.  They are the [[real number]]s (dimension 1), the [[complex number]]s (dimension 2), the [[quaternion]]s (dimension 4), and the [[octonion]]s (dimension 8). The quaternions and octonions are not commutative. Of these algebras, all are associative except for the octonions.\n* [[Quadratic algebra]]s, which require that ''xx'' = ''re'' + ''sx'', for some elements ''r'' and ''s'' in the ground field, and ''e'' a unit for the algebra. Examples include all finite-dimensional alternative algebras, and the algebra of real 2-by-2 matrices. Up to isomorphism the only alternative, quadratic real algebras without divisors of zero are the reals, complexes, quaternions, and octonions.\n* The [[Cayley–Dickson algebra]]s (where ''K'' is '''R'''), which begin with:\n** '''C''' (a commutative and associative algebra);\n** the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' (an associative algebra);\n** the [[octonion]]s (an [[alternative algebra]]);\n** the [[sedenion]]s, and the infinite sequence of Cayley-Dickson algebras ([[power-associative algebra]]s).\n* The [[Poisson algebra]]s are considered in [[geometric quantization]]. They carry two multiplications, turning them into commutative algebras and Lie algebras in different ways.\n*[[Genetic algebra]]s are non-associative algebras used in mathematical genetics.\n*[[Triple system]]s\n{{See also|list of algebras}}\n\n== Properties ==\n\nThere are several properties that may be familiar from ring theory, or from associative algebras, which are not always true for non-associative algebras. Unlike the associative case, elements with a (two-sided) multiplicative inverse might also be a [[zero divisor]]. For example, all non-zero elements of the [[sedenion]]s have a two-sided inverse, but some of them are also zero divisors.\n\n==Free non-associative algebra==\nThe '''free non-associative algebra''' on a set ''X'' over a field ''K'' is defined as the algebra with basis consisting of all non-associative monomials, finite formal products of elements of ''X'' retaining parentheses.  The product of monomials ''u'', ''v'' is just (''u'')(''v'').  The algebra is unital if one takes the empty product as a monomial.<ref>{{cite book | title=Graduate Algebra: Noncommutative View | page=321 | series=Graduate studies in mathematics | first=Louis Halle | last=Rowen | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2008 | isbn=0-8218-8408-5 }}</ref>\n\nKurosh proved that every subalgebra of a free non-associative algebra is free.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Kurosh | first=A.G. | title=Non-associative algebras and free products of algebras | journal=Mat.

      "text": "{{Redirect|Artin's theorem|Artin's theorem on primitive elements|Primitive element theorem}}\n\nIn [[abstract algebra]], an '''alternative algebra''' is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] in which multiplication need not be [[associative]], only [[alternativity|alternative]]. That is, one must have\n*<math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>\n*<math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra.\n\nEvery [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly [[non-associative algebra]]s such as the [[octonion]]s.\n\n==The associator==\n\nAlternative algebras are so named because they are the algebras for which the [[associator]] is [[alternating form|alternating]]. The associator is a [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] given by\n:<math>[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)</math>.\nBy definition, a multilinear map is alternating if it [[Vanish_(mathematics)|vanishes]] whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to<ref name=Sch27>Schafer (1995) p.27</ref>\n:<math>[x,x,y] = 0</math>\n:<math>[y,x,x] = 0.</math>\nBoth of these identities together imply that the associator is totally [[skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]]. That is,\n:<math>[x_{\\sigma(1)}, x_{\\sigma(2)}, x_{\\sigma(3)}] = \\sgn(\\sigma)[x_1,x_2,x_3]</math>\nfor any [[permutation]] σ. It follows that\n:<math>[x,y,x] = 0</math>\nfor all ''x'' and ''y''. This is equivalent to the ''[[flexible identity]]''<ref name=Sch28>Schafer (1995) p.28</ref>\n:<math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>\nThe associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:\n*left alternative identity: <math>x(xy) = (xx)y</math>\n*right alternative identity: <math>(yx)x = y(xx)</math>\n*flexible identity: <math>(xy)x = x(yx).</math>\nis alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.\n\nAn alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the base field is not 2.\n\n==Examples==\n* Every [[associative algebra]] is alternative.\n* The [[octonion]]s form a non-associative alternative algebra, a normed division algebra of dimension 8 over the real numbers.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=John Horton Conway | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | last2=Smith | first2=Derek A. | year=2003 | title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry | publisher=A.

It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written unambiguously without parentheses in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements <math>x,y,z</math> in an alternative algebra associate (i.e., <math>[x,y,z] = 0</math>), the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.\n\nA corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are [[power-associative]], that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative.<ref name=Sch30>Schafer (1995) p.30</ref>  The converse need not hold: the sedenions are power-associative but not alternative.\n\nThe [[Moufang identities]]\n*<math>a(x(ay)) = (axa)y</math>\n*<math>((xa)y)a = x(aya)</math>\n*<math>(ax)(ya) = a(xy)a</math>\nhold in any alternative algebra.<ref name=Sch28/>\n\nIn a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element <math>x</math> and all <math>y</math> one has\n:<math>y = x^{-1}(xy).</math>\nThis is equivalent to saying the associator <math>[x^{-1},x,y]</math> vanishes for all such <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>. If <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are invertible then <math>xy</math> is also invertible with inverse <math>(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}</math>. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a [[Moufang loop]]. This ''loop of units'' in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the [[group of units]] in an associative ring or algebra.\n\nKleinfeld's theorem states that any simple non-associative alternative ring is a generalized octonion algebra over its center.<ref name=ZSSS151>Zhevlakov, Slin'ko, Shestakov, Shirshov.

This is similar to the definition of an [[isotopy of loops]], except that it must also preserve the linear structure of the algebra. For {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} this is the same as an isomorphism. The '''autotopy group''' of an algebra is the group of all isotopies to itself (sometimes called autotopies), which contains the group of automorphisms as a subgroup.\n\nIsotopy of algebras was introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Albert|year=1942|authorlink=A. A. Albert}}, who was inspired by work of Steenrod.\nSome authors use a slightly different definition that an isotopy is a triple of bijective linear maps ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' such that if {{nowrap|1=''xyz'' = 1}} then {{nowrap|1=''a''(''x'')''b''(''y'')''c''(''z'') = 1}}. For [[Alternative algebra|alternative]] [[division algebra]]s such as the [[octonion]]s the two definitions of isotopy are equivalent, but in general they are not.\n\n==Examples==\n\n*If {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} is an isomorphism then the triple {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} is an isotopy. Conversely, if the algebras have identity elements 1 that are preserved by the maps ''a'' and ''b'' of an isotopy, then {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = ''c''}} is an isomorphism.\n*If ''A'' is an associative algebra with identity and ''a'' and ''c'' are left multiplication by some fixed invertible element, and ''b'' is the identity then {{nowrap|(''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} is an isotopy. Similarly we could take ''b'' and ''c'' to be right multiplication by some invertible element and take ''a'' to be the identity. These form two commuting subgroups of the autotopy group, and the full autotopy group is generated by these two subgroups and the automorphism group.\n*If an algebra (not assumed to be associative) with an identity element is isotopic to an associative algebra with an identity element, then the two algebras are isomorphic. In particular two associative algebras with identity elements are isotopic if and only if they are isomorphic. However associative algebras with identity elements can be isotopic to algebras without identity elements.\n*The autotopy group of the octonions is the [[spin group]] Spin<sub>8</sub>, much larger than its automorphism group [[G2 (mathematics)|''G''<sub>2</sub>]].\n*If ''B'' is a [[mutation (algebra)|mutation]] of the associative algebra ''A'' by an invertible element, then there is an isotopy from ''A'' to ''B''.\n*If ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are any invertible linear maps of an algebra, and one defines a new product {{nowrap|''c''<sup>−1</sup>(''a''(''x'')''b''(''y''))}}, then the algebra defined by this new product is isotopic to the original algebra. For example, the complex numbers with the product ''x''{{overline|''y''}} is isotopic to the complex numbers with the usual product, even though it is not commutative and has no identity element.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation|MR=0007747 \n|last=Albert|first= A.

The axioms imply<ref>Jacobson (1968), p.35–36, specifically remark before (56) and theorem 8.</ref> that a Jordan algebra is [[power-associative]] and satisfies the following generalization of the Jordan identity: <math>(x^my)x^n = x^m(yx^n)</math> for all positive integers ''m'' and ''n''.\n\nJordan algebras were first introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Pascual Jordan|first=Pascual |last=Jordan|year=1933}} to formalize the notion of an algebra of [[observable]]s in [[quantum mechanics]]. They were originally called \"r-number systems\", but were renamed \"Jordan algebras\" by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Abraham Adrian Albert|last=Albert|first=Abraham Adrian|year=1946}}, who began the systematic study of general Jordan algebras.\n\n==Special Jordan algebras==\n\nGiven an [[associative algebra]] ''A'' (not of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 2), one can construct a Jordan algebra ''A''<sup>+</sup> using the same underlying addition vector space. Notice first that an associative algebra is a Jordan algebra if and only if it is commutative. If it is not commutative we can define a new multiplication on ''A'' to make it commutative, and in fact make it a Jordan algebra. The new multiplication ''x'' ∘ ''y'' is the '''Jordan product''':\n:<math>x\\circ y = \\frac{xy+yx}{2}.</math>\n\nThis defines a Jordan algebra ''A''<sup>+</sup>, and we call these Jordan algebras, as well as any subalgebras of these Jordan algebras, '''special Jordan algebras'''. All other Jordan algebras are called '''exceptional Jordan algebras'''. The Shirshov–Cohn theorem states that any Jordan algebra with two [[Generating set|generators]] is special.<ref name=mcc100>McCrimmon (2004) p.100</ref>  Related to this, Macdonald's theorem states that any polynomial in three variables, which has degree one in one of the variables, and which vanishes in every special Jordan algebra, vanishes in every Jordan algebra.<ref name=mcc99>McCrimmon (2004) p.99</ref>\n\n===Hermitian Jordan algebras===\n\nIf (''A'', ''&sigma;'') is an associative algebra with an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''&sigma;'', then if ''&sigma;''(''x'')=''x'' and ''&sigma;''(''y'')=''y'' it follows that\n:<math>\\sigma(xy + yx) = xy + yx.</math>\n\nThus the set of all elements fixed by the involution (sometimes called the ''hermitian'' elements) form a subalgebra of ''A''<sup>+</sup> which is sometimes denoted H(''A'',''&sigma;'').\n\n== Examples ==\n\n1. The set of [[self-adjoint]] real, complex, or quaternionic matrices with multiplication\n\n:<math>(xy + yx)/2</math>\n\nform a special Jordan algebra.\n\n2. The set of 3&times;3 self-adjoint matrices over the  [[octonion]]s, again with multiplication\n\n:<math>(xy + yx)/2,</math>\n\nis a 27 dimensional, exceptional Jordan algebra (it is exceptional because the [[octonion]]s are not associative). This was the first example of an [[Albert algebra]]. Its automorphism group is the exceptional Lie group [[F₄]]. Since over the [[complex numbers]] this is the only simple exceptional Jordan algebra up to isomorphism,<ref name=\":0\" /> it is often referred to as \"the\" exceptional Jordan algebra. Over the [[real numbers]] there are three isomorphism classes of simple exceptional Jordan algebras.<ref name=\":0\">Springer-Veldkamp (2000), 5.8, p.&nbsp;153</ref>\n\n== Derivations and structure algebra ==\n\nA [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] of a Jordan algebra ''A'' is an endomorphism ''D'' of ''A'' such that ''D''(''xy'') = ''D''(''x'')''y''+''xD''(''y''). The derivations form a [[Lie algebra]] '''der'''(''A''). The Jordan identity implies that if ''x'' and ''y'' are elements of ''A'', then the endomorphism sending ''z'' to ''x''(''yz'')&minus;''y''(''xz'') is a derivation. Thus the direct sum of ''A'' and '''der'''(''A'') can be made into a Lie algebra, called the '''structure algebra''' of ''A'', '''str'''(''A'').\n\nA simple example is provided by the Hermitian Jordan algebras H(''A'',''&sigma;''). In this case any element ''x'' of ''A'' with ''&sigma;''(''x'')=&minus;''x'' defines a derivation. In many important examples, the structure algebra of H(''A'',''&sigma;'') is ''A''.\n\nDerivation and structure algebras also form part of Tits' construction of the [[Freudenthal magic square]].\n\n==Formally real Jordan algebras==\n\nA (possibly nonassociative) algebra over the real numbers is said to be '''formally real''' if it satisfies the property that a sum of n squares can only vanish if each one vanishes individually.  In 1932, Jordan attempted to axiomatize quantum theory by saying that the algebra of observables of any quantum system should be a formally real algebra which is commutative (''xy'' = ''yx'') and power-associative (the associative law holds for products involving only ''x'', so that powers of any element ''x'' are unambiguously defined).  He proved that any such algebra is  a Jordan algebra.\n\nNot every Jordan algebra is formally real, but {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} classified the finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebras. Every formally real Jordan algebra can be written as a direct sum of so-called '''simple''' ones, which are not themselves direct sums in a nontrivial way.  In finite dimensions, the simple formally real Jordan algebras come in four infinite families, together with one exceptional case:\n\n* The Jordan algebra of ''n''&times;''n'' self-adjoint real matrices, as above.\n* The Jordan algebra of ''n''&times;''n'' self-adjoint complex matrices, as above.\n* The Jordan algebra of ''n''&times;''n'' self-adjoint quaternionic matrices. as above.\n* The Jordan algebra freely generated by '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>  with the relations\n*:<math>x^2 = \\langle x, x\\rangle </math>\n:where the right-hand side is defined using the usual inner product on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.  This is sometimes called a '''spin factor''' or a Jordan algebra of '''Clifford type'''.\n* The Jordan algebra of 3&times;3 self-adjoint octonionic matrices, as above (an exceptional Jordan algebra called the [[Albert algebra]]).\n\nOf these possibilities, so far it appears that nature makes use only of the ''n''&times;''n'' complex matrices as algebras of observables.  However, the spin factors play a role in special relativity, and all the formally real Jordan algebras are related to [[projective geometry]].\n\n==Peirce decomposition==\n\nIf ''e'' is an idempotent in a Jordan algebra ''A'' (''e''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''e'') and ''R'' is the operation of multiplication by ''e'', then\n* ''R''(2''R''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)(''R''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0\nso the only eigenvalues of ''R'' are 0, 1/2, 1. If the Jordan algebra ''A'' is finite-dimensional over a field of characteristic not 2, this implies that it is a direct sum of subspaces ''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;''A''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'')&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;''A''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') of the three eigenspaces. This decomposition was first considered by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}} for totally real Jordan algebras. It was later studied in full generality by {{harvtxt|Albert|1947}}  and called the '''[[Peirce decomposition]]''' of ''A'' relative to the idempotent&nbsp;''e''.<ref>McCrimmon (2004) pp.&nbsp;99 ''et seq'',235 ''et seq''</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Infinite-dimensional Jordan algebras===\nIn 1979, [[Efim Zelmanov]] classified infinite-dimensional simple (and prime non-degenerate) Jordan algebras. They are either of Hermitian or Clifford type. In particular, the only exceptional simple Jordan algebras are finite-dimensional [[Albert algebra]]s, which have dimension 27.\n\n===Jordan operator algebras===\n{{Main article|Jordan operator algebra}}\nThe theory of [[operator algebras]] has been extended to cover [[Jordan operator algebra]]s.\n\nThe counterparts of [[C* algebra]]s are JB algebras, which in finite dimensions are called [[Euclidean Jordan algebra]]s. The norm on the real Jordan algebra must be [[Complete metric space|complete]] and satisfy the axioms:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|a\\circ b\\|\\le \\|a\\|\\cdot \\|b\\|,\\,\\,\\, \\|a^2\\|=\\|a\\|^2,\\,\\,\\, \\|a^2\\|\\le \\|a^2 +b^2\\|.}</math>\n\nThese axioms guarantee that the Jordan algebra is formally real, so that, if a sum of squares of terms is zero, those terms must be zero. The complexifications of JB algebras are called Jordan C* algebras or JB* algebras. They have been used extensively \nin [[complex geometry]] to extend [[Max Koecher|Koecher's]] Jordan algebraic treatment of [[bounded symmetric domain]]s to infinite dimensions. Not all JB algebras can be realized as Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, exactly as in finite dimensions. The exceptional [[Albert algebra]] is the common obstruction.\n\nThe Jordan algebra analogue of [[von Neumann algebra]]s is played by JBW algebras. These turn out to be JB algebras which, as Banach spaces, are the dual spaces of Banach spaces. Much of the structure theory of von Neumann algebras can be carried over to JBW algebras. In particular the JBW factors—those with center reduced to '''R'''—are completely understood in terms of von Neumann algebras. Apart from the exceptional [[Albert algebra]], all JWB factors can be realised as Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space closed in the [[weak operator topology]]. Of these the spin factors can be constructed very simply from real  Hilbert spaces. All other JWB factors are either the self-adjoint part of a [[Von Neumann algebra#Factors|von Neumann factor]] or its fixed point subalgebra under a period 2 *-antiautomorphism of the von Neumann factor.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Hanche-Olsen|Størmer|1984}}\n*{{harvnb|Upmeier|1985}}\n*{{harvnb|Upmeier|1987}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}</ref>\n\n===Jordan rings===\nA Jordan ring is a generalization of Jordan algebras, requiring only that the Jordan ring be over a general ring rather than a field. Alternatively one can define a Jordan ring as a commutative [[nonassociative ring]] that respects the Jordan identity.\n\n===Jordan superalgebras===\n\nJordan [[superalgebra]]s were introduced by Kac, Kantor and Kaplansky; these are <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2</math>-graded algebras <math>J_0 \\oplus J_1</math> where <math>J_0</math> is a Jordan algebra and <math>J_1</math> has a \"Lie-like\" product with values in <math>J_0</math>.<ref>McCrimmon (2004) pp.9–10</ref>\n\nAny <math>\\mathbb{Z}/2</math>-graded associative algebra <math>A_0 \\oplus A_1</math> becomes a Jordan superalgebra with respect to the graded Jordan brace\n\n:<math>\\{x_i,y_j\\} = x_i y_j + (-1)^{ij} y_j x_i \\ . </math>\n\nJordan simple superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 were classified by {{harvtxt|Kac|1977}}.  They include several families and some exceptional algebras, notably <math>K_3</math> and <math>K_{10}</math>.\n\n===J-structures===\n{{Main article|J-structure}}\nThe concept of [[J-structure]] was introduced by {{harvtxt|Springer|1973}} to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using [[linear algebraic group]]s and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and [[Hua's identity]] as a basic relation.  In [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2 the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.\n\n===Quadratic Jordan algebras===\n{{Main article|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nQuadratic Jordan algebras are a generalization of (linear) Jordan algebras introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Kevin|last=McCrimmon|year=1966}}. The fundamental identities of the [[quadratic representation]] of a linear Jordan algebra are used as axioms to define a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field of arbitrary characteristic. There is a uniform description of finite-dimensional simple quadratic Jordan algebras, independent of characteristic: in characteristic not equal to 2 the theory of quadratic Jordan algebras reduces to that of linear Jordan algebras.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Freudenthal algebra]]\n* [[Jordan triple system]]\n* [[Jordan pair]]\n* [[Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction]]\n* [[Scorza variety]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last=Albert | first=A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Jordan operator algebras''' are real or complex [[Jordan algebra]]s with the compatible structure of a Banach space. When the coefficients are [[real numbers]], the algebras are called '''Jordan Banach algebras'''. The theory has been extensively developed only for the subclass of '''JB algebras'''. The axioms for these algebras were devised by {{harvtxt|Alfsen|Schultz|Størmer|1978}}. Those that can be realised concretely as subalgebras of self-adjoint operators on a real or complex Hilbert space with the operator Jordan product and the [[operator norm]] are called '''JC algebras'''. The axioms for complex Jordan operator algebras, first suggested by [[Irving Kaplansky]] in 1976, require an involution and are called '''JB* algebras''' or '''Jordan C* algebras'''. By analogy with the abstract characterisation of [[von Neumann algebra]]s as [[C* algebra]]s for which the underlying Banach space is the dual of another, there is a corresponding definition of '''JBW algebras'''. Those that can be realised using [[weak operator topology|ultraweakly closed]] Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators with the operator Jordan product are called '''JW algebras'''. The JBW algebras with trivial center, so-called '''JBW factors''', are classified in terms of von Neumann factors: apart from the exceptional 27 dimensional [[Albert algebra]] and the '''spin factors''', all other JBW factors are isomorphic either to the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann factor or to its fixed point algebra under a period two *-anti-automorphism. Jordan operator algebras have been applied in [[quantum mechanics]] and in [[complex geometry]], where [[Max Koecher|Koecher's]] description of [[bounded symmetric domain]]s using [[Jordan algebra]]s has been extended to infinite dimensions.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===JC algebra===\nA '''JC algebra''' is a real subspace of the space of self-adjoint operators on a real or complex Hilbert space, closed under the operator Jordan product ''a'' ∘ ''b'' = ½(''ab'' + ''ba'') and closed in the operator norm.\n\n===Jordan Banach algebra===\nA '''Jordan Banach algebra''' is a real Jordan algebra with a norm making it a Banach space and satisfying  || ''a'' ∘ ''b'' || ≤ ||''a''||⋅||''b''||.\n\n===JB algebra===\nA '''JB algebra''' is a Jordan Banach algebra satisfying\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|a^2\\|=\\|a\\|^2,\\,\\,\\, \\|a^2\\| \\le \\|a^2 + b^2\\|.}</math>\n\n===JB* algebras===\nA '''JB* algebra''' or '''Jordan C* algebra''' is a complex Jordan algebra with an involution ''a'' ↦ ''a''* and a norm  making it a Banach space and satisfying\n\n* ||''a'' ∘ ''b'' || ≤ ||''a''||⋅||''b''||\n* ||''a''*|| = ||''a''||\n* ||{''a'',''a''*,''a''}|| = ||''a''||<sup>3</sup> where the [[Jordan triple system|Jordan triple product]] is defined by {''a'',''b'',''c''} = (''a'' ∘ ''b'') ∘ ''c'' + (''c'' ∘ ''b'') ∘ ''a'' − (''a'' ∘ ''c'') ∘ ''b''.\n\n===JW algebras===\nA '''JW algebra''' is a Jordan subalgebra of the Jordan algebra of self-adjoint operators on a complex Hilbert space that is closed in the [[weak operator topology]].\n\n===JBW algebras===\nA '''JBW algebra''' is a JB algebra that, as a real Banach space, is the dual of a Banach space called its '''predual'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanche-Olsen|Størmer|1984|p=111}}</ref> There is an equivalent more technical definition in terms of the continuity properties of the linear functionals in the predual, called '''normal functionals'''.

Positive normal functional are those that are non-negative on positive operators.\n* For every non-zero operator, there is a positive normal functional that does not vanish on that operator.\n\n==Properties of JB algebras==\n{{See also|Euclidean Jordan algebra}}\n*If a unital JB algebra is [[associative algebra|associative]], then its complexification with its natural involution is a commutative C* algebra. It is therefore isomorphic to C(''X'') for a compact Hausdorff space ''X'', the space of characters of the algebra. \n*'''Spectral theorem.''' If ''a'' is a single operator in a JB algebra, the closed subalgebra generated by 1 and ''a'' is associative. It can be identified with the continuous real-valued functions on the spectrum of ''a'', the set of real λ for which ''a'' − λ1 is not invertible.\n*The positive elements in a unital JB algebra are those with spectrum contained in [0,∞). By the spectral theorem, they coincide with the space of squares and form a closed convex cone. If ''b'' ≥ 0, then {''a'',''b'',''a''} ≥ 0. \n* A JB algebra is a [[formally real Jordan algebra]]: if a sum of squares of terms is zero, then each term is zero. In finite dimensions, a JB algebra is isomorphic to a [[Euclidean Jordan algebra]].<ref>{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}</ref>\n* The [[spectral radius]] on a JB algebra defines an equivalent norm also satisfying the axioms for a JB algebra. \n* A state on a unital JB algebra is a bounded linear functional ''f'' such that ''f''(1) = 1 and ''f'' is non-negative on the positive cone. The state space is a convex set closed in the weak* topology. The extreme points are called pure states.

In particular a Jordan algebra is closed in the [[weak operator topology]] if and only if it is closed in the [[Ultraweak topology|ultraweak operator topology]]. The two topologies coincide on the Jordan algebra.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Effros|Størmer|1967}}\n*{{harvnb|Dixmier|1957}}\n*{{harvnb|Dixmier|1981}}\n*{{harvnb|Hanche-Olsen|Størmer|1984|p=112}}</ref>\n*For a JBW algebra, the space of positive normal functionals is invariant under the quadratic representation ''Q''(''a'')''b'' = {''a'',''b'',''a''}. If ''f'' is positive so is ''f'' ∘ ''Q''(''a''). \n*The weak topology  on a JW algebra ''M'' is define by the seminorms |''f''(''a'')| where ''f'' is a normal state; the strong topology is defined by the seminorms |''f''(''a''<sup>2</sup>)|<sup>1/2</sup>. The quadratic representation and Jordan product operators ''L''(''a'')''b'' = ''a'' ∘ ''b'' are continuous operators on ''M'' for both the weak and strong topology. \n*An idempotent ''p'' in a JBW algebra ''M'' is called a '''projection'''. If ''p'' is a projection, then ''Q''(''p'')''M'' is a JBW algebra with identity ''p''. \n*If ''a'' is any element of a JBW algebra, the smallest weakly closed unital subalgebra it generates is associative and hence the self-adjoint part of an Abelian von Neumann algebra. In particular ''a'' can be approximated in norm by linear combinations of orthogonal projections.\n*The projections in a JBW algebra are closed under lattice operations. Thus for a family ''p''<sub>α</sub> there is a smallest projection ''p'' such that ''p'' ≥ ''p''<sub>α</sub> and a largest projection ''q'' such that ''q'' ≤ ''p''<sub>α</sub>.\n*The '''center''' of a JBW algebra ''M'' consists of all ''z'' such ''L''(''z'') commutes with ''L''(''a'') for ''a'' in ''M''. It is an associative algebra and the real part of an Abelian von Neumann algebra. A JBW algebra is called a '''factor''' if its center consists of scalar operators.\n*If ''A'' is a JB algebra, its second dual ''A''** is a JBW algebra. The normal states are states in ''A''* and can be identified with states on ''A''. Moreover, ''A''** is the JBW algebra generated by ''A''.\n*A JB algebra is a JBW algebra if and only if, as a real Banach space, it is the dual of a Banach space. This Banach space, its ''predual'', is the space of normal functionals, defined as differences of positive normal functionals. These are the functionals continuous for the weak or strong topologies. As a consequence the weak and strong topologies coincide on a JBW algebra.\n*In a JBW algebra, the JBW algebra generated by a Jordan subalgebra coincides with its weak closure. Moreover, an extension of the Kaplansky density theorem holds: the unit ball of the subalgebra is weakly dense in the unit ball of the JBW algebra it generates.\n*[[Tomita–Takesaki theory]] has been extended by {{harvtxt|Haagerup|Hanche-Olsen|1984}} to normal states of a JBW algebra that are faithful, i.e. do not vanish on any non-zero positive operator.

The inner automorphisms of ''M'' are those generated by the period two automorphisms ''Q''(1 – 2''p'') where ''p'' is  a projection. Two projections are equivalent if there is an inner automorphism carrying one onto the other. Given two projections in a factor, one of them is always equivalent to a sub-projection of the other. If each is equivalent to a sub-projection of the other, they are equivalent.\n\nA JBW factor can be classified into three mutually exclusive types as follows:\n\n* It is type I if there is a minimal projection.

If ''e'' can be taken to be 1, it is Type II<sub>1</sub>. Otherwise it is type II<sub>≈</sub>. \n* It is Type III if the projections do not form a modular lattice. All non-zero projections are then equivalent.<ref>{{harvnb|Hanche-Olsen|Størmer|120–134}}</ref>\n\n[[Tomita–Takesaki theory]] permits a further classification of the type III case into types III<sub>λ</sub> (0 ≤ λ ≤ 1) with the additional invariant of an [[ergodic flow]] on a [[Lp space|Lebesgue space]] (the \"flow of weights\") when λ = 0.<ref>{{harvnb|Haagerup|Hanche-Olsen|1984}}</ref>\n\n===Classification of JBW factors of Type I===\n* The JBW factor of Type I<sub>1</sub> is the [[real numbers]]. \n* The JBW factors of Type I<sub>2</sub> are the '''spin factors'''.  Let ''H'' be a real Hilbert space of dimension greater than 1. Set ''M'' = ''H'' ⊕ '''R''' with inner product (''u''⊕λ,''v''⊕μ) =(''u'',''v'') + λμ and product (u⊕λ)∘(v⊕μ)=( μ''u'' + λ''v'') ⊕ [(''u'',''v'') + λμ]. With the operator norm ||''L''(''a'')||, ''M'' is a JBW factor and also a JW factor.\n* The JBW factors of Type I<sub>3</sub> are the self-adjoint 3 by 3 matrices with entries in the real numbers, the [[complex number]]s or the [[quaternion]]s or the [[octonion]]s.\n*The JBW factors of Type I<sub>''n''</sub> with 4 ≤ ''n'' < ∞ are the self-adjoint ''n'' by ''n'' matrices with entries in the real numbers, the complex numbers or the quaternions.\n*The JBW factors of Type I<sub>∞</sub> are the self-adjoint operators on an infinite-dimensional real, complex or [[quaternionic Hilbert space]]. The quaternionic space is defined as all sequences '''x''' = (''x''<sub>''i''</sub>) with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> in '''H''' and ∑ |''x''<sub>''i''</sub>|<sup>2</sup> < ∞. The '''H'''-valued inner product is given by ('''x''','''y''') = ∑ (''y''<sub>''i''</sub>)*''x''<sub>''i''</sub>. There is an underlying real inner product given by ('''x''','''y''')<sub>'''R'''</sub> = Re ('''x''','''y''').

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''mutation''', also called a '''homotope''', of a unital [[Jordan algebra]] is a new Jordan algebra defined by a given element of the Jordan algebra. The mutation has a unit if and only if the given element is invertible, in which case the mutation is called a '''proper mutation''' or an '''isotope'''. Mutations were first introduced by [[Max Koecher]] in his Jordan algebraic approach to [[Hermitian symmetric space]]s and [[bounded symmetric domain]]s of tube type. Their functorial properties allow an explicit construction of the corresponding Hermitian symmetric space of compact type as a compactification of a finite-dimensional complex semisimple Jordan algebra. The automorphism group of the compactification becomes a [[complex Lie group|complex subgroup]], the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of its [[maximal compact subgroup]]. Both groups act transitively on the compactification. The theory has been extended to cover all Hermitian symmetric spaces using the theory of [[Jordan pair]]s or [[Jordan triple system]]s. Koecher obtained the results in the more general case directly from the Jordan algebra case using the fact that only Jordan pairs associated with period two automorphisms of Jordan algebras are required.\n\n==Definitions==\n{{see also|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nLet ''A'' be a unital Jordan algebra over a field ''k'' of characteristic ≠ 2.<ref>See: \n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1999}}\n*{{harvnb|Loos|1975}}\n*{{harvnb|Loos|1977}}</ref> For ''a'' in ''A'' define the Jordan multiplication operator on ''A'' by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a)b=ab}</math>\n\nand the [[quadratic representation]] ''Q''(''a'') by\n\n:<math> Q(a)=2L(a)^2 -L(a^2). \\, </math>\n\nIt satisfies\n\n:<math>Q(1)=I. \\,</math>\n\nthe  [[Quadratic Jordan algebra|fundamental identity]]\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Q(Q(a)b)=Q(a)Q(b)Q(a)}</math>\n\nthe commutation or homotopy identity\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Q(a)R(b,a)=R(a,b)Q(a) = 2Q(Q(a)b,a),}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math> R(a,b)c=2Q(a,c)b,\\,\\,\\, Q(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2} (Q(x+y)-Q(x)-Q(y)).</math>\n\nIn particular if ''a'' or ''b'' is invertible then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{R(a,b)=2Q(a)Q(a^{-1},b)=2Q(a,b^{-1})Q(b).}</math>\n\nIt follows that ''A'' with the operations ''Q'' and ''R'' and the identity element defines a [[quadratic Jordan algebra]], where a ''quadratic Jordan algebra'' consists of a vector space ''A''  with a distinguished element 1  and a quadratic map of ''A'' into endomorphisms of ''A'', ''a'' ↦ ''Q''(''a''), satisfying the conditions:\n\n* {{math|1=''Q''(1) = id}}\n* {{math|1=''Q''(''Q''(''a'')''b'') = ''Q''(''a'')''Q''(''b'')''Q''(''a'')}} (\"fundamental identity\")\n* {{math|1=''Q''(''a'')''R''(''b'',''a'') = ''R''(''a'',''b'')''Q''(''a'')}} (\"commutation or homotopy identity\"), where {{math|1=''R''(''a'',''b'')''c'' = (''Q''(''a'' + ''c'') − ''Q''(''a'') − ''Q''(''c''))''b''}}\n\nThe Jordan triple product is defined by\n\n:<math> \\{a,b,c\\}=(ab)c+(cb)a -(ac)b, \\, </math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math> Q(a)b=\\{a,b,a\\},\\,\\,\\, Q(a,c)b=\\{a,b,c\\},\\,\\,\\, R(a,b)c=\\{a,b,c\\}. \\, </math>\n\nThere are also the formulas\n\n:<math> Q(a,b)=L(a)L(b)+L(b)L(a) - L(ab),\\,\\,\\, R(a,b)= [L(a),L(b)] + L(ab). \\, </math>\n\nFor ''y'' in ''A'' the '''mutation''' ''A''<sup>''y''</sup> is defined to the vector space ''A'' with multiplication\n\n:<math> a\\circ b= \\{a,y,b\\}. \\,</math>\n \nIf ''Q''(''y'') is invertible, the mutual is called a '''proper mutation''' or '''isotope'''.\n\n==Quadratic Jordan algebras==\n{{main|Quadratic Jordan algebra}}\nLet ''A'' be a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field ''k'' of characteristic ≠ 2.

The commuting self-adjoint operators {{math|1=''L''(''x'')''L''(''y'')}} with {{math|1=''x'', ''y''}} odd powers of {{math|''a''}} act on {{math|''F''}}, so can be simultaneously diagonalized by an orthonormal basis {{math|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Since {{math|1=(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>3</sup>}} is a positive multiple of {{math|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, rescaling if necessary, {{math|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} can be chosen to be a tripotent. They form an orthogonal family by construction. Since {{math|''a''}} is in {{math|''F''}}, it can be written {{math|1=''a'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with {{math|1=α<sub>''i''</sub>}} real. These are called the eigenvalues of {{math|''a''}} (with respect to τ). Any other tripotent {{math|''e''}} in {{math|''F''}} has the form {{math|1=''a'' = ∑ ε<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with {{math|1=ε<sub>''i''</sub> = 0, ±1}}, so the {{math|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} are up to sign the minimal tripotents in {{math|''F''}}.\n\nA maximal family of orthogonal tripotents in {{math|1=''E''<sub>τ</sub>}} is called a '''Jordan frame'''. The tripotents are necessarily minimal. All Jordan frames have the same number of elements, called the '''rank''' of {{math|1=''E''<sub>τ</sub>}}. Any two frames are related by an element in the subgroup of the structure group of {{math|1=''E''<sub>τ</sub>}} preserving the trace form. For a given Jordan frame {{math|1=(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, any element {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''V''}} can be written in the form {{math|1= ''a'' = ''u'' ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with {{math|1=α<sub>''i''</sub> ≥ 0}} and  {{math|''u''}} an operator in {{math|''K''<sub>τ</sub>}}. The '''spectral norm''' of {{math|''a''}} is defined by ||''a''|| = sup α<sub>''i''</sub> and is independent of choices. Its square equals the operator norm of {{math|1=''Q''<sub>τ</sub>(''a'')}}. Thus {{math|''V''}} becomes a complex normed space with open unit ball {{math|''D''<sub>τ</sub>}}.\n\nNote that for {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''E''}}, the operator {{math|1=''Q''(''x'')}} is self-adjoint so that the norm ||{{math|1=''Q''(''x'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}|| = ||{{math|1=''Q''(''x'')}}||<sup>''n''</sup>. Since {{math|1=''Q''(''x'')<sup>''n''</sup> = ''Q''(''x''<sup>''n''</sup>)}}, it follows that ||{{math|1=''x''<sup>''n''</sup>}}|| = ||{{math|''x''}}||<sup>''n''</sup>. In particular the spectral norm of {{math|1=''x'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} in {{math|''A''}} is the square root of the spectral norm of {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> = ∑ (α<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup> ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. It follows that the spectral norm of {{math|''x''}} is the same whether calculated in {{math|''A''}} or {{math|1=''A''<sub>τ</sub>}}. Since {{math|1=''K''<sub>τ</sub>}} preserves both norms, the spectral norm on {{math|1=''A''<sub>τ</sub>}} is obtained by restricting the spectral norm on {{math|1=''A''}}.\n\nFor a Jordan frame {{math|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>}}, let {{math|1=''V''<sub>''e''</sub> = ⊕ '''C''' ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. There is an action of {{math|1=SL(2,'''C''')<sup>''m''</sup>}} on {{math|1=''V''<sub>''e''</sub>}} which extends to ''V''. If {{math|1=''c'' = ∑ γ<sub>''i''</sub>''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|1=''b'' = ∑ β<sub>''i''</sub>''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, then {{math|''S''(''c'')}} and {{math|''T''(''b'')}} give the action of the product of the lower and upper unitriangular matrices. If {{math|1=''a'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub>''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} with {{math|1=α<sub>''i''</sub> ≠ 0}}, then the corresponding product of diagonal matrices act as {{math|1=''W'' = ''B''<sub>τ</sub>(''a'', ''e'' − ''a'')}}, where {{math|1=''e'' = ∑ ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Loos|1977|pp=9.4–9.5}}</ref> In particular the diagonal matrices give an action of {{math|1=('''C'''*)<sup>''m''</sup>}} and {{math|1='''T'''<sup>''m''</sup>}}.\n\nAs in the case without an automorphism τ, there is an automorphism θ of {{math|''G''<sub>τ</sub>}}.

This corresponds to the automorphism of ''E'' = ''H''<sub>''p'' + ''q''</sub>('''R''') given by conjugating by the diagonal matrix with ''p'' diagonal entries equal to 1 and ''q'' to −1. Without loss of generality {{math|''p''}} can be taken greater than {{math|''q''}}. The structure is given by\nthe triple product {{math|1=''xy''<sup>''t''</sup>''z''}}. The space ''X'' can be identified with the Grassmannian of {{math|''p''}}-dimensional subspace of {{math|1='''C'''<sup>''p'' + ''q''</sup> = '''C'''<sup>''p''</sup> ⊕ '''C'''<sup>''q''</sup>}}. This has a natural embedding in {{math|1='''C'''<sup>2''p''</sup> = '''C'''<sup>''p''</sup> ⊕ '''C'''<sup>''p''</sup>}} by adding 0's in the last {{math|1=''p'' − ''q''}} coordinates. Since any {{math|''p''}}-dimensional subspace of {{math|1='''C'''<sup>2''p''</sup>}} can be represented in the form [{{math|1=''I'' − ''y''<sup>''t''</sup>''x''}}|{{math|''x''}}], the same is true for subspaces lying in {{math|1='''C'''<sup>''p'' + ''q''</sup>}}. The last {{math|''p'' − ''q''}} rows of {{math|''x''}} must vanish and the mapping does not change if the last {{math|''p'' − ''q''}} rows of  {{math|''y''}} are set equal to zero. So a similar representation holds for mappings, but now with  ''q'' by ''p'' matrices. Exactly as when {{math|1=''p'' = ''q''}}, it follows that there is an action of {{math|1=GL(''p'' + ''q'', '''C''')}} by fractional linear transformations.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1969}}\n*{{harvnb|Loos|1977}}\n</ref>\n\n'''Type II<sub>n</sub>''' ''F'' is the space of real skew-symmetric ''m'' by ''m'' matrices. After removing a factor of {{radic|-1}}, this corresponds to the period 2 automorphism given by complex conjugation on ''E'' = ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''').\n\n'''Type V.''' ''F'' is the direct sum of two copies of the Cayley numbers, regarded as 1 by 2 matrices. This corresponds to the canonical period 2 automorphism defined by any minimal idempotent in ''E'' = ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''').\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mutation (algebra)]]\n* [[Symmetric cone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Dineen|first= S.|last2= Mackey|first2= M.|last3= Mellon|first3= P.|title= The density property for JB∗-triples|journal=Studia Math.|volume= 137|year=1999|pages=143–160|hdl= 10197/7056}}\n*{{citation|last=Drucker|first= D.|title= Exceptional Lie algebras and the structure of Hermitian symmetric spaces|journal= Mem.

The fundamental identities of the [[quadratic representation]] of a linear Jordan algebra are used as axioms to define a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field of arbitrary characteristic. There is a uniform description of finite-dimensional simple quadratic Jordan algebras, independent of characteristic. If 2 is invertible in the field of coefficients, the theory of quadratic Jordan algebras reduces to that of linear Jordan algebras.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''quadratic Jordan algebra''' consists of a vector space ''A'' over a field ''K'' with a distinguished element 1 and a quadratic map of ''A'' into the ''K''-endomorphisms of ''A'', ''a'' ↦ ''Q''(''a''), satisfying the conditions:\n\n* ''Q''(1) = id;\n* ''Q''(''Q''(''a'')''b'') = ''Q''(''a'')''Q''(''b'')''Q''(''a'') (\"fundamental identity\");\n* ''Q''(''a'')''R''(''b'',''a'') = ''R''(''a'',''b'')''Q''(''a'') (\"commutation identity\"), where ''R''(''a'',''b'')''c'' = (''Q''(''a'' + ''c'') − ''Q''(''a'') − ''Q''(''c''))''b''.\n\nFurther, these properties are required to hold under any [[extension of scalars]].<ref name=Rac1>Racine (1973) p.1</ref>\n\n===Elements===\nAn element ''a'' is '''invertible''' if ''Q''(''a'') is invertible and there exists ''b'' such that ''Q''(''b'') is the inverse of ''Q''(''a'') and ''Q''(''a'')''b'' = ''a'': such ''b'' is unique and we say that ''b'' is the '''inverse''' of ''a''.  A '''Jordan division algebra''' is one in which every non-zero element is invertible.<ref name=Rac2/>\n\n===Structure===\nLet ''B'' be a subspace of ''A''.

Graduate Texts in Mathematics Springer-Verlag. {{ISBN|0387943706}}</ref>{{rp|369-376}} This definition is constructed so that the category <math>\\mathcal{A}-Mod</math> is a [[tensor category]] under the usual vector space tensor product, and in fact this can be taken as the definition instead of the list of above identities.<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|368}} Since many of the quasi-bialgebras that appear \"in nature\" have trivial unit constraints, ie. <math>l=r=1</math> the definition may sometimes be given with this assumed.<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|370}} Note that a [[bialgebra]] is just a quasi-bialgebra with trivial unit and associativity constraints: <math>l=r=1</math> and <math>\\Phi=1 \\otimes 1 \\otimes 1</math>.\n\n== Braided Quasi-Bialgebras ==\nA ''braided quasi-bialgebra'' (also called a ''quasi-triangular quasi-bialgebra'') is a quasi-bialgebra whose corresponding tensor category <math>\\mathcal{A}-Mod</math> is [[Braided monoidal category|braided]]. Equivalently, by analogy with [[Quasitriangular Hopf algebra|braided bialgebras]], we can construct a notion of a ''universal R-matrix'' which controls the non-[[coalgebra|cocommutativity]] of a quasi-bialgebra. The definition is the same as in the [[Quasitriangular Hopf algebra|braided bialgebra]] case except for additional complications in the formulas caused by adding in the associator.\n\n'''Proposition:''' A quasi-bialgebra <math>(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta,\\epsilon,\\Phi,l,r)</math> is braided if it has a ''universal R-matrix'', ie an invertible element <math>R \\in \\mathcal{A \\otimes A}</math> such that the following 3 identities hold:\n\n:<math>(\\Delta^{op})(a)=R \\Delta(a) R^{-1}</math>\n\n:<math>(id \\otimes \\Delta)(R)=(\\Phi_{231})^{-1} R_{13} \\Phi_{213} R_{12} (\\Phi_{213})^{-1}</math>\n\n:<math>(\\Delta \\otimes id)(R)=(\\Phi_{321}) R_{13} (\\Phi_{213})^{-1} R_{23} \\Phi_{123}</math>\n\nWhere, for every <math>a_1 \\otimes ... \\otimes a_k \\in \\mathcal{A}^{\\otimes k}</math>, <math>a_{i_1 i_2 ... i_n}</math> is the monomial with <math>a_j</math> in the <math>i_j</math>th spot, where any omitted numbers correspond to the identity in that spot. Finally we extend this by linearity to all of <math>\\mathcal{A}^{\\otimes k}</math>.<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|371}}\n\nAgain, similar to the [[Quasitriangular Hopf algebra|braided bialgebra]] case, this universal R-matrix satisfies (a non-associative version of) the [[Yang-Baxter equation]]:\n\n:<math>R_{12}\\Phi_{321}R_{13}(\\Phi_{132})^{-1}R_{23}\\Phi_{123}=\\Phi_{321}R_{23}(\\Phi_{231})^{-1}R_{13}\\Phi_{213}R_{12}</math><ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|372}}\n\n== Twisting ==\nGiven a quasi-bialgebra, further quasi-bialgebras can be generated by twisting (from now on we will assume <math>r=l=1</math>) .\n\nIf <math>\\mathcal{B_A}</math> is a quasi-bialgebra and <math>F \\in \\mathcal{A \\otimes A} </math> is an invertible element such that <math>(\\varepsilon \\otimes id) F = (id \\otimes \\varepsilon) F = 1 </math>, set\n\n:<math> \\Delta ' (a) = F \\Delta (a) F^{-1}, \\quad \\forall a \\in \\mathcal{A}</math>\n:<math> \\Phi ' = (1 \\otimes  F) \\ ((id \\otimes \\Delta) F) \\ \\Phi \\ ((\\Delta \\otimes id)F^{-1}) \\ (F^{-1} \\otimes 1).</math>\n\nThen, the set <math>(\\mathcal{A}, \\Delta ' , \\varepsilon, \\Phi ')</math> is also a quasi-bialgebra obtained by twisting <math> \\mathcal{B_A} </math> by ''F'', which is called a ''twist'' or ''gauge transformation''.<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|373}} If <math>(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta,\\varepsilon, \\Phi)</math> was a braided quasi-bialgebra with universal R-matrix <math>R</math> , then so is <math>(\\mathcal{A},\\Delta',\\varepsilon, \\Phi ')</math> with universal R-matrix <math>F_{21}RF^{-1}</math> (using the notation from the above section).<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|376}} However, the twist of a bialgebra is only in general a quasi-bialgebra. Twistings fulfill many expected properties. For example, twisting by <math>F_1</math> and then <math>F_2</math> is equivalent to twisting by <math>F_2F_1</math>, and twisting by <math>F</math> then <math>F^{-1}</math> recovers the original quasi-bialgebra.\n\nTwistings have the important property that they induce categorical equivalences on the tensor category of modules:\n\n'''Theorem:''' Let <math>\\mathcal{B_A}</math>, <math>\\mathcal{B_{A'}}</math> be quasi-bialgebras, let <math>\\mathcal{B'_{A'}}</math> be the twisting of <math>\\mathcal{B_{A'}}</math> by <math>F</math>, and let there exist an isomorphism: <math>\\alpha:\\mathcal{B_A} \\to \\mathcal{B'_{A'}}</math>. Then the induced tensor functor <math>(\\alpha^*,id,\\phi_2^F)</math> is a tensor category equivalence between <math>\\mathcal{A'}-mod</math> and <math>\\mathcal{A}-mod</math>. Where <math>\\phi_2^F(v \\otimes w)=F^{-1}(v \\otimes w)</math>. Moreover, if <math>\\alpha</math> is an isomorphism of braided quasi-bialgebras, then the above induced functor is a braided tensor category equivalence.<ref name=Kassel/>{{rp|375-376}}\n\n== Usage ==\n\nQuasi-bialgebras form the basis of the study of [[quasi-Hopf algebra]]s and further to the study of [[Drinfeld twist]]s and the representations in terms of [[F-matrix|F-matrices]] associated with finite-dimensional irreducible [[representation theory|representations]] of [[quantum affine algebras|quantum affine algebra]]. F-matrices can be used to factorize the corresponding [[R-matrix]]. This leads to applications in [[statistical mechanics]], as quantum affine algebras, and their representations give rise to solutions of the [[Yang-Baxter equation]], a solvability condition for various statistical models, allowing characteristics of the model to be deduced from its corresponding quantum affine algebra. The study of F-matrices has been applied to models such as the [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|XXZ]] in the framework of the Algebraic [[Bethe ansatz]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Bialgebra]]\n*[[Hopf algebra]]\n*[[Quasi-Hopf algebra]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Vladimir Drinfeld]], ''Quasi-Hopf algebras'', Leningrad Math J. 1 (1989), 1419-1457\n* J.M.

Unlike the octonions, the sedenions are not an [[alternative algebra]]. Applying the Cayley–Dickson construction to the sedenions yields a 32-dimensional algebra, sometimes called the ''32-ions'' or ''Trigintaduonions''.<ref>Raoul E. Cawagas, et al. (2009). [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.2047.pdf \"THE BASIC SUBALGEBRA STRUCTURE OF THE CAYLEY-DICKSON ALGEBRA OF DIMENSION 32 (TRIGINTADUONIONS)\"].</ref> It is possible to apply the Cayley–Dickson construction to the sedenions infinitely often.\n\nThe term ''sedenion'' is also used for other 16-dimensional algebraic structures, such as a tensor product of two copies of the [[biquaternion]]s, or the algebra of 4 by 4 matrices over the reals, or that studied by {{harvtxt|Smith |1995}}.\n\n==Arithmetic==\n[[File:Sedenion-Fano_Tesseract.gif|thumb|A visualization of a 4D extension to the cubic [[Octonion#Fano plane mnemonic|octonion]],<ref>{{Harv|Baez|2002|loc=p. 6}}</ref> showing the 35 triads as [[hyperplane]]s through the real <math>(e_0)</math> vertex of the sedenion example given.]]\nLike [[octonion]]s, [[multiplication]] of sedenions is neither [[commutative]] nor [[associative]].\nBut in contrast to the octonions, the sedenions do not even have the property of being [[alternative algebra|alternative]].\nThey do, however, have the property of [[power associativity]], which can be stated as that, for any element <var>x</var> of <math>\\mathbb{S}</math>, the power <math>x^n</math> is well defined. They are also [[Flexible algebra|flexible]].\n\nEvery sedenion is a [[linear combination]] of the unit sedenions <math>e_0</math>, <math>e_1</math>, <math>e_2</math>, <math>e_3</math>, ...,<math>e_{15}</math>,\nwhich form a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the [[vector space]] of sedenions. Every sedenion can be represented in the form\n\n:<math>x = x_0e_0 + x_1e_1 + x_2e_2 + \\ldots + x_{14}e_{14} + x_{15}e_{15},\\,</math>.\n\nAddition and subtraction are defined by the addition and subtraction of corresponding coefficients and multiplication is [[distributive property|distributive]] over addition.\n\nLike other algebras based on the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]], the sedenions contain the algebra they were constructed from. So, they contain the octonions (<math>e_0</math> to <math>e_7</math> in the table below), and therefore also the quaternions (<math>e_0</math> to <math>e_3</math>), complex numbers (<math>e_0</math> and <math>e_1</math>) and reals (<math>e_0</math>).\n\nThe sedenions have a multiplicative [[identity element]] <math>e_0</math> and multiplicative inverses but they are not a [[division algebra]] because they have [[zero divisors]]. This means that two non-zero sedenions can be multiplied to obtain zero: an example is (<math>e_3</math> + <math>e_{10}</math>)(<math>e_6</math> − <math>e_{15}</math>). All [[hypercomplex number]] systems after sedenions that are based on the Cayley–Dickson construction contain zero divisors.\n\nA sedenion multiplication table is shown below:\n{{collapse top| multiplication table}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- \n  |\n  |\n  |colspan=\"16\" | multiplier <math>e_j</math>\n|-\n  | |\n  ! <math>e_ie_j</math>\n  ! <math>e_0</math>\n  ! <math>e_1</math>\n  ! <math>e_2</math>\n  ! <math>e_3</math>\n  ! <math>e_4</math>\n  ! <math>e_5</math>\n  ! <math>e_6</math>\n  ! <math>e_7</math>\n  ! <math>e_8</math>\n  ! <math>e_9</math>\n  ! <math>e_{10}</math>\n  ! <math>e_{11}</math>\n  ! <math>e_{12}</math>\n  ! <math>e_{13}</math>\n  ! <math>e_{14}</math>\n  ! <math>e_{15}</math>\n|- <!-- Would color coding the cells be nice or annoying?

By the [[Koecher–Vinberg theorem]] these correspond to the cone of squares in finite-dimensional [[Jordan algebra#Formally real Jordan algebras|real Euclidean Jordan algebra]]s, originally studied and classified by {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1933}}. The [[tube domain]] associated with a symmetric cone is a noncompact [[Hermitian symmetric space]] of '''tube type'''. All the algebraic and geometric structures associated with the symmetric space can be expressed naturally in terms of the Jordan algebra. The other irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type correspond to [[Siegel domain]]s of the second kind. These can be described in terms of more complicated structures called [[Jordan triple system]]s, which generalize Jordan algebras without identity.<ref>This article uses as its main sources {{harvtxt|Jordan|von Neumann|Wigner|1934}}, {{harvtxt|Koecher|1999}} and {{harvtxt|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}, adopting the terminology and some simplifications from the latter.</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\nA [[convex cone]] ''C'' in a finite-dimensional real [[inner product space]] ''V'' is a convex set invariant under multiplication by positive scalars. It spans the subspace ''C'' – ''C'' and the largest subspace it contains is ''C'' ∩ (−''C''). It spans the whole space if and only if it contains a basis. Since the [[convex hull]] of the basis is a polytope with non-empty interior, this happens if and only if ''C'' has non-empty interior. The interior in this case is also a convex cone. Moreover, an open convex cone coincides with the interior of its closure, since any interior point in the closure must lie in the interior of some polytope in the original cone. A convex cone is said to be ''proper'' if its closure, also a cone, contains no subspaces.\n\nLet ''C'' be an open convex cone. Its '''dual''' is defined as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{C^*=\\{X: (X,Y) > 0\\,\\,\\mathrm{for}\\,\\,Y \\in \\overline{C}\\}.}</math>\n\nIt is also an open convex cone and ''C''** = ''C''.<ref>{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=2–4}}</ref> An open convex cone ''C'' is said to be '''self-dual''' if ''C''* = ''C''. It is necessarily proper, since\nit does not contain 0, so cannot contain both ''X'' and −''X''.\n\nThe '''automorphism group''' of an open convex cone is defined by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{Aut}\\,C =\\{g\\in \\mathrm{GL}(V)| gC=C\\}.}</math>\n\nClearly ''g'' lies in Aut ''C'' if and only if ''g'' takes the closure of ''C'' onto itself. So Aut ''C'' is a closed subgroup of GL(''V'') and hence a [[Lie group]]. Moreover, Aut ''C''* = (Aut ''C'')*, where ''g''* is the adjoint of ''g''. ''C'' is said to be '''homogeneous''' if Aut ''C'' acts transitively on ''C''.\n\nThe open convex cone ''C'' is called a '''symmetric cone''' if it is self-dual and homogeneous.\n\n==Group theoretic properties==\n*If ''C'' is a symmetric cone, then Aut ''C'' is closed under taking adjoints.\n*The identity component Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C'' acts transitively on ''C''.\n*The stabilizers of points are [[maximal compact subgroup]]s, all conjugate, and exhaust the maximal compact subgroups of Aut ''C''.\n*In Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C'' the stabilizers of points are [[maximal compact subgroup]]s, all conjugate, and exhaust the maximal compact subgroups of Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C''.\n*The maximal compact subgroups of Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C'' are connected.\n*The component group of Aut ''C'' is isomorphic to the component group of a maximal compact subgroup and therefore finite.\n*Aut ''C'' ∩ O(V) and Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C'' ∩ O(V) are maximal compact subgroups in Aut ''C'' and Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C''.\n* ''C'' is naturally a [[Riemannian symmetric space]] isomorphic to ''G'' / ''K'' where ''G'' = Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C''.

The trace form has the advantage of being manifestly invariant under automorphisms of the Jordan algebra, which is thus a closed subgroup of O(''E'') and thus a compact Lie group. In practical examples, however, it is often easier to produce an inner product for which the ''L''(''a'') are self-adjoint than verify directly positive-definiteness of the trace form. (The equivalent original condition of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner was that if a sum of squares of elements vanishes then each of those elements has to vanish.<ref>For a proof of equivalence see:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1999|p=118}}, Theorem 12\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=42,153–154}}</ref>)\n\n===Power associativity===\nFrom the Jordan condition it follows that the Jordan algebra is [[Power associativity|'''power associative''']], i.e. the Jordan subalgebra generated by any single element ''a'' in ''E'' is actually an associative commutative algebra. Thus, defining ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> inductively by ''a''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''a'' (''a''<sup>''n''−1</sup>), the following associativity relation holds:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{a^m a^n = a^{m+n},}</math>\n\nso the subalgebra can be identified with '''R'''[''a''], polynomials in ''a''. In fact [[Polarization of an algebraic form|polarizing]] of the Jordan relation—replacing ''a'' by ''a'' + ''tb'' and taking the coefficient of ''t''—yields\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{2L(ab)L(a) + L(a^2)L(b)=2L(a)L(b)L(a) + L(a^2b).}</math>\n\nThis identity implies that ''L''(''a''<sup>''m''</sup>) is a polynomial in ''L''(''a'') and ''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>) for all ''m''. In fact, assuming the result for lower exponents than ''m'',\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{a^2 a^{m-1} =a^{m-1}(a^2)=L(a^{m-1})L(a)a=L(a)L(a^{m-1})a=L(a)a^m=a^{m+1}.}</math>\n\nSetting ''b'' = ''a''<sup>''m'' – 1</sup> in the polarized Jordan identity gives:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a^{m+1})=2L(a^m)L(a)+L(a^2)L(a^{m-1})-2L(a)^2L(a^{m-1}),}</math>\n\na [[recurrence relation]] showing inductively that ''L''(''a''<sup>''m'' + 1</sup>) is a polynomial in ''L''(''a'') and ''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>).\n\nConsequently, if power-associativity holds when the first exponent is  ≤ ''m'', then it also holds for ''m''+1 since\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a^{m+1})a^n=2L(a)L(a^m)a^n+ L(a^2)L(a^{m-1})a^n -2L(a)^2L(a^{m-1})a^n\n=a^{m+n+1}.}</math>\n\n===Idempotents and rank===\nAn element ''e'' in ''E'' is called an [[idempotent]] if ''e''<sup>2</sup> = ''e''. Two idempotents are said to be orthogonal if ''ef'' = 0. This is equivalent to orthogonality with respect to the inner product,  since (''ef'',''ef'') = (''e'',''f''). In this case ''g'' = ''e'' + ''f'' is also an idempotent. An idempotent ''g'' is called ''primitive'' or ''minimal'' if it cannot be written as a sum of non-zero orthogonal idempotents. If ''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub> are pairwise orthogonal idempotents then their sum is also an idempotent and the algebra they generate consists of all linear combinations of the ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>. It is an associative algebra. If ''e'' is an idempotent, then 1 − ''e'' is an orthogonal idempotent. An orthogonal set of idempotents with sum 1 is said to be a ''complete set'' or a ''partition of 1''. If each idempotent in the set is minimal it is called a ''Jordan frame''. Since the number of elements in any orthogonal set of idempotents is bounded by dim ''E'', Jordan frames exist. The maximal number of elements in a Jordan frame is called the '''rank''' ''r'' of ''E''.\n\n===Spectral decomposition===\nThe spectral theorem states that any element ''a'' can be uniquely written as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{a=\\sum \\lambda_i e_i,}</math>\n\nwhere the idempotents ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are a partition of 1 and the λ<sub>''i''</sub>, the ''eigenvalues'' of ''a'', are real and distinct. In fact let ''E''<sub>0</sub> = '''R'''[a] and let ''T'' be the restriction of ''L''(''a'') to ''E''<sub>0</sub>. ''T'' is self-adjoint and has 1 as a cyclic vector. So the [[commutant]] of ''T'' consists of polynomials in ''T'' (or ''a''). By the [[spectral theorem]] for self-adjoint operators,\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{T=\\sum \\lambda_i P_i}</math>\n\nwhere the ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> are orthogonal projections on ''E''<sub>0</sub> with sum ''I'' and the λ<sub>''i''</sub>'s are the distinct real eigenvalues of ''T''. Since the   ''P''<sub>''i''</sub>'s commute with ''T'' and are self-adjoint, they are given by multiplication elements ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of  '''R'''[a] and thus form a partition of 1. Uniqueness follows because if ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> is a partition of 1 and ''a'' = ∑ μ<sub>''i''</sub> ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>, then with ''p''(''t'')=∏ (''t'' - μ<sub>''j''</sub>) and ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''p''/(''t'' − μ<sub>''i''</sub>), ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>(''a'')/''p''<sub>''i''</sub>(μ<sub>''i''</sub>). So the ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are polynomials in ''a'' and uniqueness follows from uniqueness of the spectral decomposition of ''T''.\n\nThe spectral theorem implies that the rank is independent of the Jordan frame. For a Jordan frame with ''k'' minimal idempotents can be used to construct an element ''a'' with ''k'' distinct eigenvalues. As above the minimal polynomial ''p'' of ''a'' has degree ''k'' and '''R'''[''a''] has dimension ''k''. Its dimension is also the largest ''k'' such that ''F''<sub>''k''</sub>(''a'') ≠ 0 where ''F''<sub>''k''</sub>(''a'') is the determinant of a [[Gram matrix]]:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{F_k(a)=\\det_{0\\le m,n< k} (a^m,a^n).}</math>\n\nSo the rank ''r'' is the largest integer ''k'' for which ''F''<sub>''k''</sub> is not identically zero on ''E''. In this case, as a non-vanishing polynomial, ''F''<sub>''r''</sub> is non-zero on an open dense subset of ''E''. the ''regular elements''. Any other ''a'' is a limit of regular elements ''a''<sup>(''n'')</sup>. Since the operator norm of ''L''(''x'') gives an equivalent norm on ''E'', a standard compactness argument shows that, passing to a subsequence if necessary, the spectral idempotents of the ''a''<sup>(''n'')</sup> and their corresponding eigenvalues are convergent. The limit of Jordan frames is a Jordan frame, since a limit of non-zero idempotents yields a non-zero idempotent by continuity of the operator norm. It follows that every Jordan frame is made up of ''r'' minimal idempotents.\n\nIf ''e'' and ''f'' are orthogonal idempotents, the spectral theorem shows that ''e'' and ''f'' are polynomials in ''a'' = ''e'' − ''f'', so that ''L''(''e'') and ''L''(''f'') commute. This can be seen directly from the polarized Jordan identity which implies ''L''(''e'')''L''(''f'') = 2 ''L''(''e'')''L''(''f'')''L''(''e''). Commutativity follows by taking adjoints.\n\n===Spectral decomposition for an idempotent===\nIf ''e'' is a non-zero idempotent then the eigenvalues of ''L''(''e'') can only be 0, 1/2 and 1, since taking ''a'' = ''b'' = ''e'' in the polarized Jordan identity yields\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{2L(e)^3-3L(e)^2 +L(e)=0.}</math>\n\nIn particular the operator norm of ''L''(''e'') is 1 and its trace is strictly positive.\n\nThere is a corresponding orthogonal eigenspace decomposition of ''E''\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{E=E_0(e)\\oplus E_{1/2}(e) \\oplus E_1(e),}</math>\n\nwhere, for ''a'' in ''E'', ''E''<sub>λ</sub>(''a'') denotes the λ-eigenspace of ''L''(''a''). In this decomposition ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') and ''E''<sub>0</sub>(''e'') are Jordan algebras with identity elements ''e'' and 1 − ''e''. Their sum ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') ⊕ ''E''<sub>0</sub>(''e'') is a direct sum of Jordan algebras in that any product between them is zero. It is the ''centralizer subalgebra'' of ''e'' and consists of all ''a'' such that ''L''(''a'') commutes with ''L''(''e''). The subspace ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'') is a module for the centralizer of ''e'', the ''centralizer module'', and the product of any two elements in it lies in the centralizer subalgebra. On the other hand, if\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{U=8L(e)^2 -8L(e) +I,}</math>\n\nthen ''U'' is self-adjoint equal to 1 on the centralizer algebra and −1 on the centralizer module. So ''U''<sup>2</sup> = ''I'' and the properties above show that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\sigma(x) = Ux}</math>\n\ndefines an involutive Jordan algebra automorphism σ of ''E''.\n\n:<small>In fact the Jordan algebra and module properties follow by replacing ''a'' and ''b'' in the polarized Jordan identity by ''e'' and ''a''. If ''ea'' = 0, this gives ''L''(''e'')''L''(''a'') = 2''L''(''e'')''L''(''a'')''L''(''e''). Taking adjoints it follows that ''L''(''a'') commutes with ''L''(''e''). Similarly if (1 − ''e'')''a'' = 0, ''L''(''a'') commutes with ''I'' − ''L''(''e'') and hence ''L''(''e''). This implies the Jordan algebra and module properties. To check that a product of elements in the module lies in the algebra, it is enough to check this for squares: but if ''L''(''e'')''a'' = ½ ''a'', then ''ea'' = ½ ''a'', so ''L''(''a'')<sup>2</sup> + ''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>)''L''(''e'') = 2''L''(''a'')''L''(''e'')''L''(''a'') + ''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>''e'').

Using the [[Peirce decomposition]], they reduced the problem to an algebraic problem involving [[Hurwitz's theorem (composition algebras)|multiplicative quadratic forms]] already solved by [[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]]. The presentation here, following {{harvtxt|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}, using [[composition algebra]]s or '''Euclidean Hurwitz algebras,''' is a shorter version of the original derivation.\n\n===Central decomposition===\nIf ''E'' is a Euclidean Jordan algebra an '''ideal''' ''F'' in ''E'' is a linear subspace closed under multiplication by elements of ''E'', i.e. ''F'' is invariant under the operators ''L''(''a'') for ''a'' in ''E''. If ''P'' is the orthogonal projection onto ''F'' it commutes with the operators ''L''(''a''), In particular ''F''<sup>⊥</sup> = (''I'' − ''P'')''E'' is also an ideal and ''E'' = ''F'' ⊕ ''F''<sup>⊥</sup>. Furthermore, if ''e'' = ''P''(1), then ''P'' = ''L''(''e''). In fact for ''a'' in ''E''\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{ea=ae=L(a)P(1)=P(L(a)1)=P(a),}</math>\n\nso that ''ea'' = ''a'' for ''a'' in ''F'' and 0 for ''a'' in ''F''<sup>⊥</sup>. In particular ''e'' and 1 − ''e'' are orthogonal idempotents with ''L''(''e'') = ''P'' and ''L''(1 − ''e'') = ''I'' − ''P''. ''e'' and 1 − ''e'' are the identities in the Euclidean Jordan algebras  ''F'' and ''F''<sup>⊥</sup>. The idempotent ''e'' is ''central'' in ''E'', where the '''center''' of ''E'' is defined to be the set of all ''z'' such that ''L''(''z'') commutes with ''L''(''a'') for all ''a''. It forms a commutative associative subalgebra.\n\nContinuing in this way ''E'' can be written as a direct sum of minimal ideals\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{E=\\oplus E_i.}</math>\n\nIf ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> is the projection onto ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''P''<sub>''i''</sub>(1) then ''P''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''L''(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>). The ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are orthogonal with sum 1 and are the identities in ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>. Minimality forces ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> to be '''simple''', i.e. to have no non-trivial ideals. For since ''L''(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) commutes with all ''L''(''a'')'s, any ideal ''F'' ⊂ ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>\nwould be invariant under ''E'' since ''F'' = ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>''F''. Such a decomposition into a direct sum of simple Euclidean algebras is unique. If ''E'' = ⊕ ''F''<sub>''j''</sub> is another decomposition, then ''F''<sub>''j''</sub>=⊕ e<sub>''i''</sub>''F''<sub>''j''</sub>. By minimality only one of the terms here is non-zero so equals ''F''<sub>''j''</sub>. By minimality the corresponding ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> equals ''F''<sub>''j''</sub>, proving uniqueness.\n\nIn this way the classification of Euclidean Jordan algebras is reduced to that of simple ones. For a simple algebra ''E'' all inner products for which the operators ''L''(''a'') are self adjoint are proportional. Indeed, any other product has the form (''Ta'', ''b'') for some positive self-adjoint operator commuting with the ''L''(''a'')'s. Any non-zero eigenspace of ''T'' is an ideal in ''A'' and therefore by simplicity ''T'' must act on the whole of ''E'' as a positive scalar.\n\n===List of all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras===\n\n* Let ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') be the space of real symmetric ''n'' by ''n'' matrices with inner product (''a'',''b'') = Tr ''ab'' and Jordan product ''a'' ∘ ''b'' = ½(''ab'' + ''ba''). Then ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''') is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank ''n'' for ''n'' ≥ 3.\n* Let ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') be the space of complex self-adjoint ''n'' by ''n'' matrices with inner product (''a'',''b'') = Re Tr ''ab''* and Jordan product ''a'' ∘ ''b'' = ½(''ab'' + ''ba''). Then ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank ''n'' ≥ 3.\n* Let ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''H''') be the space of self-adjoint ''n'' by ''n'' matrices with entries in the [[quaternion]]s, inner product (''a'',''b'') = Re Tr ''ab''* and Jordan product ''a'' ∘ ''b'' = ½(''ab'' + ''ba''). Then ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''H''') is a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank ''n'' ≥ 3.\n* Let ''V'' be a finite dimensional real inner product space and set ''E'' = ''V'' ⊕ '''R''' with inner product (''u''⊕λ,''v''⊕μ) =(''u'',''v'') + λμ and product (u⊕λ)∘(v⊕μ)=( μ''u'' + λ''v'') ⊕ [(''u'',''v'') + λμ]. This is a Euclidean Jordan algebra of rank 2.\n*The above examples in fact give all the simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, except for one exceptional case ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O'''), the self-adjoint matrices over the [[octonion]]s or [[Cayley number]]s, another rank 3 simple Euclidean Jordan algebra of dimension 27 (see below).\n\n===Peirce decomposition===\n{{see also|Peirce decomposition}}\nLet ''E'' be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra with inner product given by the trace form τ(''a'')= Tr ''L''(''a''). The proof that ''E'' has the above form rests on constructing an analogue of matrix units for a Jordan frame in ''E''. The following properties of idempotents hold in ''E''.\n\n*An idempotent ''e'' is minimal in ''E'' if and only if ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') has dimension one (so equals '''R'''''e''). Moreover ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'') ≠ (0).  In fact the spectral projections of any element of ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') lie in ''E'' so if non-zero must equal ''e''. If the 1/2 eigenspace vanished then  ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') = '''R'''''e'' would be an ideal.\n*If ''e'' and ''f'' are non-orthogonal minimal idempotents, then there is a period 2 automorphism σ of ''E'' such that σ''e''=''f'', so that ''e'' and ''f'' have the same trace.\n*If ''e'' and ''f'' are orthogonal minimal idempotents then ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'') ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''f'') ≠ (0). Moreover, there is a period 2 automorphism σ of ''E'' such that σ''e''=''f'', so that ''e'' and ''f'' have the same trace, and for any ''a'' in this intersection, ''a''<sup>2</sup> = ½ τ(''e'') |''a''|<sup>2</sup> (''e'' + ''f'').\n*All minimal idempotents in ''E'' are in the same orbit of the automorphism group so have the same trace τ<sub>0</sub>.\n*If ''e'', ''f'', ''g'' are three minimal orthogonal idempotents, then for ''a'' in ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'') ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''f'') and ''b'' in ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''f'') ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''g''), ''L''(''a'')<sup>2</sup> ''b'' = ⅛ τ<sub>0</sub> |''a''|<sup>2</sup> ''b'' and |''ab''|<sup>2</sup> =  ⅛ τ<sub>0</sub> |''a''|<sup>2</sup>|''b''|<sup>2</sup>. Moreover, ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e'') ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''f'') ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''g'') = (0).\n*If ''e''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''r''</sub> and ''f''<sub>''1''</sub>, ..., ''f''<sub>''r''</sub> are Jordan frames in ''E'', then there is an automorphism α such that α''e''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''i''</sub>.\n*If (''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) is a Jordan frame and ''E''<sub>''ii''</sub> = ''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) and ''E''<sub>''ij''</sub> = ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) ∩ ''E''<sub>1/2</sub>(''e''<sub>''j''</sub>), then ''E'' is the orthogonal direct sum the ''E''<sub>''ii''</sub>'s and ''E''<sub>''ij''</sub>'s. Since ''E'' is simple, the ''E''<sub>''ii''</sub>'s are one-dimensional and the subspaces ''E''<sub>''ij''</sub> are all non-zero for ''i'' ≠ ''j''.\n*If ''a'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> for some Jordan frame (''e''<sub>''i''</sub>), then ''L''(''a'') acts as  α<sub>''i''</sub> on ''E''<sub>''ii''</sub> and (α<sub>''i''</sub> + α<sub>''i''</sub>)/2 on ''E''<sub>''ij''</sub>.\n\n===Reduction to Euclidean Hurwitz algebras===\n{{Main article|Euclidean Hurwitz algebra}}\nLet ''E'' be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra. From the properties of the Peirce decomposition it follows that:\n\n*If ''E'' has rank 2, then it has the form ''V'' ⊕ '''R''' for some inner product space ''V'' with Jordan product as described above.\n*If ''E'' has rank ''r'' > 2, then there is a non-associative unital algebra ''A'', associative if ''r'' > 3, equipped with an inner product satisfying (ab,ab)= (a,a)(b,b) and such that ''E'' = ''H''<sub>''r''</sub>(''A''). (Conjugation in ''A'' is defined by ''a''* = −a + 2(a,1)1.)\n\nSuch an algebra ''A'' is called a '''Euclidean Hurwitz algebra'''.  In ''A'' if  λ(''a'')''b'' =  ''ab'' and ρ(''a'')''b'' = ''ba'', then:\n\n* the involution is an antiautomorphism, i.e. {{math|1=(''a b'')*=''b''* ''a''*}}\n* {{math|1=''a a''* = ‖ ''a'' ‖<sup>2</sup> 1 = ''a''* ''a''}}\n* {{math|1= λ(''a''*) = λ(''a'')*}}, {{math|1=ρ(''a''*) = ρ(''a'')*}}, so that the involution on the algebra corresponds to taking [[adjoint operator|adjoints]]\n* {{math|1=Re(''a b'') = Re(''b a'')}} if {{math|1=Re ''x'' = (''x'' + ''x''*)/2 = (''x'', 1)1}}\n* {{math|1=Re(''a b'') ''c'' = Re ''a''(''b c'')}}\n* {{math|1=λ(''a''<sup>2</sup>) = λ(''a'')<sup>2</sup>}}, {{math|1= ρ(''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ρ(''a'')<sup>2</sup>}}, so that {{mvar|A}} is an [[alternative algebra]].\n\nBy [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] ''A'' must be isomorphic to '''R''', '''C''', '''H''' or '''O'''. The first three are associative division algebras. The octonions do not form an associative algebra, so ''H''<sub>''r''</sub>('''O''') can only give a Jordan algebra for ''r'' = 3. Because ''A'' is associative when ''A'' = '''R''', '''C''' or '''H''', it is immediate that ''H''<sub>''r''</sub>(''A'') is a Jordan algebra for ''r'' ≥ 3. A separate argument, given originally by {{harvtxt|Albert|1934}}, is required to show that ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''') with Jordan product ''a''∘''b'' = ½(''ab'' + ''ba'') satisfies the Jordan identity [''L''(''a''),''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>)] = 0. There is a later more direct proof using the [[Freudenthal diagonalization theorem]] due to {{harvtxt|Freudenthal|1951}}: he proved that given any matrix in the algebra ''H''<sub>''r''</sub>('''A''') there is an algebra automorphism carrying the matrix onto a diagonal matrix with real entries; it is then straightforward to check that [''L''(''a''),''L''(''b'')] = 0 for real diagonal matrices.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Freudenthal|1985}}\n*{{harvnb|Postnikov|1986}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}\n*{{harvnb|Springer|Veldkamp|2000}}</ref>\n\n===Exceptional and special Euclidean Jordan algebras===\nThe '''exceptional''' Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E''= ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''') is called the [[Albert algebra]]. The Cohn–Shirshov theorem implies that it cannot be generated by two elements (and the identity). This can be seen directly. For by Freudenthal's diagonalization theorem one element ''X'' can be taken to be a diagonal matrix with real entries and the other  ''Y'' to be orthogonal to the Jordan subalgebra generated by ''X''. If all the diagonal entries of ''X'' are distinct, the Jordan subalgebra generated by ''X'' and ''Y'' is generated by the diagonal matrices and three elements\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Y_1=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & y_1\\\\0 & y_1^* & 0\\end{pmatrix},\\,\\,\\,\nY_2=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & y_2^*\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0\\\\y_2 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix},\\,\\,\\,\nY_3=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & y_3 & 0\\\\ y_3^* & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nIt is straightforward to verify that the real linear span of the diagonal matrices, these matrices and similar matrices with real entries form a unital Jordan subalgebra. If the diagonal entries of ''X'' are not distinct, ''X'' can be taken to be the primitive idempotent ''e''<sub>1</sub> with diagonal entries 1, 0 and 0. The analysis in {{harvtxt|Springer|Veldkamp|2000}} then shows that the unital Jordan subalgebra generated by ''X'' and ''Y'' is proper. Indeed, if, if 1 − ''e''<sub>1</sub> is the sum of two primitive idempotents in the subalgebra, then, after applying an automorphism of ''E'' if necessary, the subalgebra will be generated by the diagonal matrices and a matrix orthogonal to the diagonal matrices. By the previous argument it will be proper. If 1 - ''e''<sub>1</sub> is a primitive idempotent, the subalgebra must be proper, by the properties of the rank in ''E''.\n\nA Euclidean algebra is said to be ''special'' if its central decomposition contains no copies of the Albert algebra. Since the Albert algebra cannot be generated by two elements, it follows that a Euclidean Jordan algebra generated by two elements is special. This is the '''[[Shirshov–Cohn theorem]]''' for Euclidean Jordan algebras.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Freudenthal|1985}}\n*{{harvnb|Jacobson|1968}}\n*{{harvnb|Zhevlakov|Slinko|Shestakov|Shirshov|1982}}\n*{{harvnb|Hanche-Olsen|Størmer|1984}}\n*{{harvnb|Springer|Veldkamp|2000|pp=117–141}}</ref>\n\nThe classification shows that each non-exceptional simple Euclidean Jordan algebra is a subalgebra of some ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''').

Moreover, ''a'' has positive spectrum if and only if ''L''(''a'') has positive spectrum. For if ''a'' has positive spectrum, ''a'' - ε1 has non-negative spectrum for some ε > 0.\n\nThe '''positive cone''' ''C'' in ''E'' is defined to be the set of elements ''a'' such that ''a'' has positive spectrum.

Set ''S''(''t'')= –''T''(''t'') + ''M'' with ''M'' > 0 chosen so large that ''S''(''t'') is positive for all ''t''. The operator norm ||''S''(''t'')|| is continuous. It is less than ''M'' for ''t'' = α and greater than ''M'' for ''t'' = β. So for some α < ''s'' < β, ||''S''(''s'')|| = M and there is a vector ''v'' ≠ 0 such that ''S''(''s'')''v'' = ''Mv''. In particular ''T''(''s'')''v'' = 0, so that ''T''(''s'') is not invertible.\n\nSuppose that ''x'' = ''Q''(''a'')''b'' does not lie in ''C''. Let ''b''(''t'') = (1 − ''t'') + ''tb'' with 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1. By convexity ''b''(''t'') lies in ''C''. Let ''x''(''t'') = ''Q''(''a'')''b''(''t'') and ''X''(''t'') = ''L''(''x''(''t'')). If ''X''(''t'') is invertible for all ''t'' with 0 ≤ ''t'' ≤ 1, the eigenvalue argument gives a contradiction since it is positive at ''t'' = 0 and has negative eigenvalues at ''t'' = 1. So ''X''(''s'') has a zero eigenvalue for some ''s'' with 0 < ''s'' ≤ 1: ''X''(''s'')''w'' = 0 with ''w'' ≠ 0. By the properties of the quadratic representation, ''x''(''t'') is invertible for all ''t''. Let ''Y''(''t'') = ''L''(''x''(''t'')<sup>2</sup>). This is a positive operator since ''x''(''t'')<sup>2</sup> lies in ''C''. Let ''T''(''t'') = ''Q''(''x''(''t'')), an invertible self-adjoint operator by the invertibility of ''x''(''t'').  On the other hand, ''T''(''t'') = 2''X''(''t'')<sup>2</sup> - ''Y''(''t''). So (''T''(''s'')''w'',''w'') < 0 since ''Y''(''s'') is positive and ''X''(''s'')''w'' = 0. In particular ''T''(''s'') has some negative eigenvalues. On the other hand, the operator ''T''(0) = ''Q''(''a''<sup>2</sup>) = ''Q''(''a'')<sup>2</sup> is positive. By the eigenvalue argument, ''T''(''t'') has eigenvalue 0 for some ''t'' with 0 < ''t'' < ''s'', a contradiction.\n\nIt follows that the linear operators ''Q''(''a'') with ''a'' invertible, and their inverses, take the cone ''C'' onto itself. Indeed, the inverse of ''Q''(''a'') is just ''Q''(''a''<sup>−1</sup>). Since ''Q''(''a'')1 = ''a''<sup>2</sup>, there is thus a transitive group of symmetries:\n\n{{quote box|align=left|'''''C''''' '''is a symmetric cone.'''}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Euclidean Jordan algebra of a symmetric cone==\n\n===Construction===\nLet ''C'' be a symmetric cone in the Euclidean space ''E''. As above, Aut ''C'' denotes the closed subgroup of GL(''E'') taking ''C'' (or equivalently its closure) onto itself. Let ''G'' = Aut<sub>0</sub> ''C'' be its identity component. ''K'' = ''G'' ∩ O(''E''). It is a maximal compact subgroup of ''G'' and the stabilizer of a point ''e'' in ''C''. It is connected. The group ''G'' is invariant under taking adjoints. Let σ''g'' =(''g''*)<sup>−1</sup>,  period 2 automorphism. Thus ''K'' is the fixed point subgroup of σ. Let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be the Lie algebra of ''G''.

If ''N'' is the closed subgroup of ''S'' such that ''nx'' = ''x'' modulo ⊕<sub>(''p'',''q'') > (''i'',''j'')</sub> ''E''<sub>''pq''</sub>, then ''S'' = ''AN'' = ''NA'', a [[semidirect product]] with ''A'' normalizing ''N''.

The group ''N'' is lower unitriangular and its Lie algebra lower triangular. In particular the exponential map is a polynomial mapping of <math>\\mathfrak{n}</math> onto ''N'', with polynomial inverse given by the logarithm.\n\n==Complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra==\n\n===Definition of complexification===\nLet ''E'' be a Euclidean Jordan algebra. The complexification ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub> = ''E'' ⊕ ''iE'' has a natural conjugation operation (''a'' + ''ib'')* = ''a'' − ''ib'' and a natural complex inner product and norm. The Jordan product on ''E'' extends bilinearly to ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, so that (''a'' + ''ib'')(''c'' + ''id'') = (''ac'' − ''bd'') + ''i''(''ad'' + ''bc''). If multiplication is defined by ''L''(''a'')''b'' = ''ab'' then the Jordan axiom\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[L(a),L(a^2)]=0}</math>\n\nstill holds by analytic continuation. Indeed, the identity above holds when ''a'' is replaced by ''a'' + ''tb'' for ''t'' real; and since the left side is then a polynomial with values in End ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub> vanishing for real ''t'', it vanishes also ''t'' complex. Analytic continuation also shows that all for the formulas involving power-associativity for a single element ''a'' in ''E'', including recursion formulas for ''L''(''a''<sup>''m''</sup>), also hold in ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. Since for ''b'' in ''E'', ''L''(''b'') is still self-adjoint on ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, the adjoint relation ''L''(''a''*) = ''L''(''a'')* holds for ''a'' in ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. Similarly the symmetric bilinear form β(''a'',''b'') = (''a'',''b''*) satisfies β(''ab'',''c'') = β(''b'',''ac''). If the inner product comes from the trace form, then  β(''a'',''b'') = Tr ''L''(''ab'').\n\nFor ''a'' in ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, the quadratic representation is defined as before by  ''Q''(''a'')=2''L''(''a'')<sup>2</sup> − ''L''(''a''<sup>2</sup>).

Power associativity shows that ''L''(''a'') and ''L''(''a''<sup>−1</sup>) commute. Moreover, ''a''<sup>−1</sup> is invertible with inverse ''a''.\n\nAs in ''E'', ''a'' is invertible if and only if ''Q''(''a'') is invertible. In that case\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Q(a)^{-1}a=a^{-1},\\,\\,\\, Q(a^{-1})=Q(a)^{-1}.}</math>\n\nIndeed, as for ''E'', if ''Q''(''a'') is invertible it carries '''C'''[''a''] onto itself, while ''Q''(''a'')1 = ''a''<sup>2</sup>, so\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(Q(a)^{-1} a)a=a Q(a)^{-1} a=L(a)Q(a)^{-1}a=Q(a)^{-1}a^2 =1,}</math>\n\nso ''a'' is invertible. Conversely if ''a'' is invertible, taking ''b'' = ''a''<sup>−2</sup> in the fundamental identity shows that ''Q''(''a'') is invertible. Replacing ''a'' by ''a''<sup>−1</sup> and ''b'' by ''a'' then shows that its inverse is ''Q''(''a''<sup>−1</sup>). Finally if ''a'' and ''b'' are invertible then so is  ''c'' = ''Q''(''a'')''b'' and it satisfies the inverse identity:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(Q(a)b)^{-1}=Q(a^{-1})b^{-1}.}</math>\n\nInvertibility of ''c'' follows from the fundamental formula which gives ''Q''(''c'') = ''Q''(''a'')''Q''(''b'')''Q''(''a'').

In particular ''e'' and 1 − ''e'' are orthogonal ''central'' idempotents with ''L''(''e'') = ''P'' and ''L''(1 − ''e'') = ''I'' − ''P''.\n\nSo simplicity follows from the fact that the center of ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub> is the complexification of the center of ''E''.\n\n==Symmetry groups of bounded domain and tube domain==\nAccording to the \"elementary approach\" to bounded symmetric space of Koecher,<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1999}}\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1969}}\n</ref> Hermitian symmetric spaces of noncompact type can be realized in the complexification of a Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E'' as either the open unit ball for the spectral norm, a bounded domain, or as the open tube domain {{math|1=''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC''}}, where ''C'' is the positive open cone in ''E''. In the simplest case where ''E'' = '''R''', the complexification of ''E'' is just '''C''', the bounded domain corresponds to the open unit disk and the tube domain to the upper half plane. Both these spaces have transitive groups of biholomorphisms given by Möbius transformations, corresponding to matrices in {{math|SU(1,1)}} or {{math|SL(2,'''R''')}}. They both lie in the Riemann sphere {{math|1='''C''' ∪ {∞}}}, the standard one-point compactification of '''C'''. Moreover, the symmetry groups are all particular cases of Möbius transformations corresponding to matrices in {{math|SL(2,'''C''')}}. This complex Lie group and its maximal compact subgroup {{math|SU(2)}} act transitively on the Riemann sphere. The groups are also algebraic. They have distinguished generating subgroups and have an explicit description in terms of generators and relations. Moreover, the Cayley transform gives an explicit Möbius transformation from the open disk onto the upper half plane.  All these features generalize to arbitrary Euclidean Jordan algebras.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Loos|1977}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}</ref> The compactification and complex Lie group are described in the next section and correspond to the dual Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. In this section only the symmetries of and between the bounded domain and tube domain are described.\n\nJordan frames provide one of the main Jordan algebraic techniques to describe the symmetry groups. Each Jordan frame gives rise to a product of copies of '''R''' and '''C'''. The symmetry groups of the corresponding open domains and the compactification—polydisks and polyspheres—can be deduced from the case of the unit disk, the upper halfplane and Riemann sphere. All these symmetries extend to the larger Jordan algebra and its compactification. The analysis can also be reduced to this case because all points in the complex algebra (or its compactification) lie in an image of the polydisk (or polysphere) under the unitary structure group.\n\n===Definitions===\nLet {{math|''E''}} be a Euclidean Jordan algebra with complexification {{math|1=''A'' = ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub> = ''E'' + ''iE''}}.\n\nThe unit ball or disk ''D'' in {{math|''A''}} is just the convex bounded open set of elements\n{{math|''a''}} such the ||''a''|| < 1, i.e. the unit ball for the spectral norm.\n\nThe tube domain ''T'' in {{math|''A''}} is the unbounded convex open set {{math|1=''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC''}}, where ''C'' is the open positive cone in {{math|''E''}}.\n\n===Möbius transformations===\nThe group SL(2,'''C''') acts by [[Möbius transformation]]s on the [[Riemann sphere]] '''C''' ∪ {∞}, the [[one-point compactification]] of '''C'''. If ''g'' in SL(2,'''C''') is given by the matrix\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{g=\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha & \\beta \\\\ \\gamma & \\delta\\end{pmatrix},}</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{g(z)=(\\alpha z +\\beta)(\\gamma z +\\delta)^{-1}.}</math>\n\nSimilarly the group SL(2,'''R''') acts by Möbius transformations on the circle '''R''' ∪ {∞}, the one-point compactification of '''R'''.\n\nLet ''k'' = '''R''' or '''C'''. Then SL(2,''k'') is generated by the three subgroups of lower and upper unitriangular matrices, '''L''' and '''U'''', and the diagonal matrices '''D'''. It is also generated by the lower (or upper) unitriangular matrices, the diagonal matrices and the matrix\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{J=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThe matrix ''J'' corresponds to the Möbius transformation {{math|1= ''j''(''z'') = −''z''<sup>−1</sup>}} and can be written\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{J=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThe Möbius transformations fixing ∞ are just the upper triangular matrices '''B''' = '''UD''' = '''DU'''. If ''g'' does not fix ∞, it sends ∞ to a finite point ''a''. But then ''g'' can be composed with an upper unitriangular matrix to send ''a'' to 0 and then with ''J'' to send 0 to infinity. This argument gives the one of the simplest examples of the [[Bruhat decomposition]]:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathbf{SL}(2,k) = \\mathbf{B} \\cup \\mathbf{B}\\cdot J\\cdot \\mathbf{B},}</math>\n\nthe double coset decomposition of {{math|SL(2,''k'')}}. In fact the union is disjoint and can be written more precisely as\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathbf{SL}(2,k) = \\mathbf{B} \\cup  \\mathbf{B} \\cdot J\\cdot\\mathbf{U},}</math>\n\nwhere the product occurring in the second term is direct.\n\nNow let\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{T(\\beta)=\\begin{pmatrix}1 & \\beta \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThen\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\begin{pmatrix}\\alpha & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\alpha^{-1}\\end{pmatrix} = JT(\\alpha^{-1}) JT(\\alpha)JT(\\alpha^{-1}).}</math>\n\nIt follows {{math|SL(2,''k'')}} is generated by the group of operators {{math|''T''(β)}} and ''J'' subject to the following relations:\n\n*{{math|1= β ↦ ''T''(β)}} is an additive homomorphism\n*{{math|1= α ↦ ''D''(α) = ''JT''(α<sup>−1</sup>)''JT''(α)''JT''(α<sup>−1</sup>)}} is a multiplicative homomorphism\n*{{math|1=''D''(−1) = ''J''}}\n*{{math|1=''D''(α)''T''(β)''D''(α)<sup>−1</sup> = ''T''(α<sup>2</sup>β)}}\n*{{math|1=''JD''(α)''J''<sup>−1</sup> = ''D''(α)<sup>−1</sup>}}\n\nThe last relation follows from the definition of {{math|1=''D''(α)}}. The generator and relations above is fact gives a presentation of {{math|SL(2,''k'')}}. Indeed, consider the free group Φ generated by ''J'' and {{math|''T''(β)}} with ''J'' of order 4 and its square central. This consists of all products\n{{math|1=''T''(β<sub>1</sub>)''JT''(β<sub>2</sub>)''JT''(β<sub>3</sub>)''J'' ... ''T''(β<sub>''m''</sub>)''J''}} for {{math|1=''m'' ≥ 0}}. There is a natural homomorphism of Φ onto {{math|SL(2,''k'')}}. Its kernel contain the normal subgroup Δ generated by the relations above. So there is a natural homomorphism of Φ/Δ onto {{math|SL(2,''k'')}}. To show that it is injective it suffices to show that the Bruhat decomposition also holds in {{math|1= Φ/Δ}}. It is enough to prove the first version, since the more precise version follows from the commutation relations between ''J'' and\n{{math|''D''(α)}}. The set {{math|1='''B''' ∪ '''B''' ''J'' '''B'''}} is invariant under inversion, contains operators {{math|''T''(β)}} and ''J'', so it is enough to show it is invariant under multiplication. By construction it is invariant under multiplication by '''B'''. It is invariant under multiplication by ''J'' because of the defining equation for {{math|1=''D''(α)}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Lang|1985|pp=209–210}}</ref>\n\nIn particular the center of  {{math|SL(2,''k'')}} consists of the scalar matrices {{math|1=±''I''}}  and it is the only non-trivial normal subgroup of {{math|SL(2,''k'')}}, so that {{math|1=PSL(2,''k'') = SL(2,''k'')/{±''I''}}} is [[simple group|simple]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=30–32}}</ref> In fact if {{math|1='''K'''}} is a normal subgroup, then the Bruhat decomposition implies that {{math|'''B'''}} is a maximal subgroup, so that either {{math|'''K'''}} is contained in {{math|'''B'''}} or\n{{math|1='''KB''' = SL(2,''k'')}}. In the first case {{math|'''K'''}} fixes one point and hence every point of {{math|1= ''k'' ∪ {∞}}}, so lies in the center. In the second case, the [[commutator subgroup]] of {{math|SL(2,''k'')}} is the whole group, since it the group is generated by lower and upper unitriangular matrices and the fourth relation shows that all such matrices are commutators\nsince {{math|1=[''T''(β),''D''(α)] = ''T''(β − α<sup>2</sup>β)}}. Writing {{math|1=''J'' = ''kb''}} with {{math|''k''}} in {{math|'''K'''}} and {{math|''b''}} in {{math|'''B'''}}, it follows that {{math|1='''L''' = ''k'' '''U''' ''k''<sup>−1</sup>}}. Since {{math|'''U'''}} and {{math|'''L'''}} generate the whole group, {{math|1=SL(2,''k'') = '''KU'''}}. But then {{math|1=SL(2,''k'')/'''K''' ≅ '''U'''/'''U''' ∩ '''K'''}}. The right hand side here is Abelian while the left hand side is its own commutator subgroup. Hence this must be the trivial group and {{math|1='''K''' = SL(2,''k'')}}.\n\nGiven an element ''a'' in the complex Jordan algebra {{math|1=''A'' = ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, the unital Jordan subalgebra {{math|1='''C'''[''a'']}} is associative and commutative. Multiplication by ''a'' defines an operator on  {{math|1='''C'''[''a'']}} which has a spectrum, namely its set of complex eigenvalues. If {{math|''p''(''t'')}} is a complex polynomial, then {{math|''p''(''a'')}} is defined in {{math|1='''C'''[''a'']}}. It is invertible in {{math|''A''}} if and only if it is invertible in\n{{math|1='''C'''[''a'']}}, which happen precisely when {{math|''p''}} does not vanish on the spectrum of {{math|''a''}}. This permits [[rational function]]s of {{math|''a''}} to be defined whenever the function is defined on the spectrum of {{math|''a''}}. If {{math|''F''}} and {{math|''G''}} are rational functions with {{math|''G''}} and {{math|1=''F''∘''G''}} defined on {{math|''a''}}, then\n{{math|''F''}} is defined on {{math|''G''(''a'')}} and {{math|1=''F''(''G''(''a'')) = (''F''∘''G'')(''a'')}}. This applies in particular to complex Möbius transformations which can be defined by\n{{math|1=''g''(''a'') = (α''a'' + β1)(γ''a'' + δ1)<sup>−1</sup>}}. They leave {{math|1='''C'''[''a'']}} invariant and, when defined, the group composition law holds. (In the next section complex Möbius transformations will be defined on the compactification of {{math|''A''}}.)<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1999}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=150–153}}</ref>\n\nGiven a primitive idempotent {{math|''e''}} in {{math|''E''}} with Peirce decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{E=E_1(e)\\oplus E_{1/2}(e)\\oplus E_0(e),\\,\\,\\,\\, A=A_1(e)\\oplus A_{1/2}(e)\\oplus A_0(e).}</math>\n\nthe action of {{math|SL(2,'''C''')}} by Möbius transformations on {{math|1=''E''<sub>1</sub>(''e'') = '''C''' ''e''}} can be extended to an action on ''A'' so that the action leaves invariant the components {{math|1=''A''<sub>''i''</sub>(''e'')}} and in particular acts trivially on {{math|1=''E''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Loos|1977|pp=9.4–9.5}}</ref> If {{math|1=''P''<sub>0</sub>}} is the projection onto {{math|1=''A''<sub>0</sub>(''e'')}}, the action is given be the formula\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{g(z e\\oplus x_{1/2} \\oplus x_0)={\\alpha z +\\beta \\over \\gamma z +\\delta}\\cdot e \\oplus (\\gamma z +\\delta)^{-1} x_{1/2} \\oplus x_0 - (\\gamma z + \\delta)^{-1}P_0(x_{1/2}^2).}</math>\n\nFor a Jordan frame of primitive idempotents {{math|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>}}, the actions of  {{math|SL(2,'''C''')}} associated with different {{math|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} commute, thus giving an action of {{math|SL(2,'''C''')<sup>''m''</sup>}}. The diagonal copy of  {{math|SL(2,'''C''')}} gives again the action by Möbius transformations on {{math|''A''}}.\n\n===Cayley transform===\n{{see also|Cayley transform}}\nThe Möbius transformation defined by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{C(z)=i{1+z\\over 1-z}=-i +{2i\\over 1 - z}}</math>\n\nis called the [[Cayley transform]]. Its inverse is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P(w)={w-i\\over w+i} = 1 -{2i\\over w+i}.}</math>\n\nThe inverse Cayley transform carries the real line onto the circle with the point 1 omitted. It carries the upper halfplane onto the unit disk and the lower halfplane onto the complement of the closed unit disk. In [[operator theory]] the mapping {{math|1=''T'' ↦ ''P''(''T'')}} takes self-adjoint operators ''T'' onto unitary operators ''U'' not containing 1 in their spectrum. For matrices this follows because unitary and self-adjoint matrices can be diagonalized and their eigenvalues lie on the unit circle or real line. In this finite-dimensional setting the Cayley transform and its inverse establish a bijection between the matrices of operator norm less than one and operators with imaginary part a positive operator. This is the special case for {{math|1=''A'' = M<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''')}} of the Jordan algebraic result, explained below, which asserts that the Cayley transform and its inverse establish a bijection between the bounded domain {{math|''D''}} and the tube domain {{math|''T''}}.\n\nIn the case of matrices, the bijection follows from resolvant formulas.<ref>{{harvnb|Folland|1989|pp=203–204}}</ref> In fact if the imaginary part of {{math|''T''}} is positive, then {{math|1=''T'' + ''iI''}} is invertible since\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|(T+iI)x\\|^2= \\|(T-iI)x\\|^2 + 4(\\mathrm{Im}(T)x,x).}</math>\n\nIn particular, setting {{math|1=''y'' = (''T'' + ''iI'')''x''}},\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|y\\|^2= \\|P(T)y\\|^2 + 4(\\mathrm{Im}(T)x,x).}</math>\n\nEquivalently\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{I-P(T)^*P(T) =\n4 (T^* -iI)^{-1}[\\mathrm{Im}\\,T] (T+iI)^{-1}}</math>\n\nis a positive operator, so that ||''P''(''T'')|| < 1.

This corresponds to the Jordan algebra of symmetric complex matrices, the complexification of {{math|''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''R''')}}.\n\nIn {{math|1=''A'' = ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} the above resolvant identities take the following form:<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1999}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=200–201}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Q(1-u^*)Q(C(u)+C(u^*))Q(1-u)=-4B(u^*,u)}</math>\n\nand equivalently\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{  4Q(\\mathrm{Im} \\,a) = Q(a^*-i)B(P(a)^*,P(a))Q(a+i),}</math>\n\nwhere the Bergman operator  {{math|1=''B''(''x'',''y'')}} is defined by {{math|1=''B''(''x'',''y'') = ''I'' − 2''R''(''x'',''y'') + ''Q''(''x'')''Q''(''y'')}} with {{math|1=''R''(''x'',''y'') = [''L''(''x''),''L''(''y'')] + ''L''(''xy'')}}. The inverses here are well defined. In fact in one direction {{math|1=1 − ''u''}} is invertible for ||''u''|| < 1: this follows either using the fact that the norm satisfies ||''ab''|| ≤ ||''a''|| ||''b''||; or using the resolvant identity and the invertibility of {{math|1=''B''(''u''*,''u'')}} (see below). In the other direction if the imaginary part of {{math|''a''}} is in {{math|''C''}} then the imaginary part of {{math|''L''(''a'')}} is positive definite so that {{math|''a''}} is invertible. This argument can be applied to {{math|''a'' + ''i''}}, so it also invertible.\n\nTo establish the correspondence, it is enough to check it when {{math|''E''}} is simple. In that case it follows from the connectivity of {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''D''}} and because:\n\n{{quote box|align=left|* For {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''E''}}, {{math|1=''Q''(''x'')}} is a positive operator if and only if {{math|''x''}} or {{math|1=−''x''}} lies in {{math|1=''C''}}\n* {{math|1=''B''(''a''*,''a'')}} is a positive operator if and only if {{math|''a''}} or its inverse (if invertible) lies in {{math|''D''}}}}\n{{Clear}}\n\nThe first criterion follows from the fact that the eigenvalues of {{math|1=''Q''(''x'')}} are exactly {{math|1=λ<sub>''i''</sub>λ<sub>''j''</sub>}} if the eigenvalues of {{math|''x''}} are {{math|1=λ<sub>''i''</sub>}}.

Hence for ||''a''|| ≤ 1,  {{math|1=''a'' − λ}} is invertible for |λ| > 1. It follows that the Möbius transformation {{math|''ga''}} is defined for ||''a''|| ≤ 1 and {{math|''g''}} in {{math|SU(1,1)}}. Where defined it is injective. It is holomorphic on {{math|''D''}}. By the [[maximum modulus principle]], to show that {{math|''g''}} maps {{math|''D''}} onto {{math|''D''}} it suffices to show it maps {{math|''S''}} onto itself.

Uniqueness of the maximal compact subgroup up to conjugacy follows from [[maximal compact subgroup#Proof of uniqueness for semisimple groups|a general argument]] or can be deduced for classical domains directly using [[Sylvester's law of inertia]] following {{harvtxt|Sugiura|1982}}.<ref>Note that the elementary argument in {{harvtxt|Igusa|1972|p=23}} cited in  {{harvtxt|Folland|1989}} is incomplete.</ref> For the example of Hermitian matrices over '''C''', this reduces to proving that {{math|1=U(''n'') × U(''n'')}} is up to conjugacy the unique maximal compact subgroup in {{math|1=U(''n'',''n'')}}.

The Hermitian form corresponds to an orthogonal decomposition into two subspaces of dimension {{math|''n''}} both invariant under {{math|''K''}} with the form positive definite on one and negative definite on the other. By Sylvester's law of inertia,  given two subspaces of dimension {{math|''n''}} on which the Hermitian form is positive definite, one is carried onto the other by an element of {{math|1=U(''n'',''n'')}}. Hence there is an element {{math|''g''}} of  {{math|1=U(''n'',''n'')}} such that the positive definite subspace is given by {{math|''gW''}}. So {{math|1=''gKg''<sup>−1</sup>}} leaves {{math|''W''}} invariant and {{math|1=''gKg''<sup>−1</sup> ⊆ U(''n'') × U(''n'')}}.\n\nA similar argument. with [[quaternion]]s replacing the complex numbers, shows uniquess for the symplectic group, which corresponds to Hermitian matrices over '''R'''. This can also been see more directly by using [[Complex manifold|complex structures]]. A complex structure is an invertible operator ''J'' with ''J''<sup>2</sup> = −''I''. preserving the symplectic form ''B'' and such that −''B''(''Jx'',''y'') is a real inner product. The symplectic group acts transitively on complex structures by conjugation. Moreover, the subgroup commuting with ''J'' is naturally identified with the unitary group for the corresponding complex inner product space. Uniqueness follows by showing that any compact subgroup ''K'' commutes with some complex structure ''J''. In fact, averaging over Haar measure, there is a ''K''-invariant inner product on the underlying space. The symplectic form yields an invertible skew-adjoint operator ''T'' commuting with ''K''. The operator ''S'' = −''T''<sup>2</sup> is positive, so has a unique positive square root, which commutes with ''K''. So ''J'' = ''S''<sup>−1/2</sup>''T'', the phase of ''T'', has square −''I'' and commutes with ''K''.\n\n===Automorphism group of tube domain===\nThere is an [[Cartan decomposition]] for ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> corresponding to the action on the tube ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'':\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_T=K_T A_T K_T.}</math>\n\n*''K''<sub>''T''</sub> is the stabilizer of ''i'' in ''iC'' ⊂ ''T'', so a maximal compact subgroup of ''G''<sub>''T''</sub>. Under the Cayley transform, ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> corresponds to ''K''<sub>''D''</sub>, the stabilizer of 0 in the bounded symmetric domain, where it acts linearly. Since ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> is semisimple, every [[Maximal compact subgroup#Proof of uniqueness for semisimple groups|maximal compact subgroup]] is conjugate to ''K''<sub>''T''</sub>.\n*The center of ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> or ''G''<sub>''D''</sub> is trivial. In fact the only point fixed by ''K''<sub>''D''</sub> in ''D'' is 0. Uniqueness implies that the [[Center (geometry)|center]] of ''G''<sub>''D''</sub> must fix 0. It follows that the center of ''G''<sub>''D''</sub> lies in ''K''<sub>''D''</sub> and hence that the center of ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> lies in ''K''<sub>''T''</sub>. The center of ''K''<sub>''D''</sub> is isomorphic to the circle group: a rotation through θ corresponds to multiplication by ''e''<sup>''i''θ</sup> on ''D''. In Cayley transform it corresponds to the [[Möbius transformation]] ''z'' ↦ (''cz'' + ''s'')(−''sz''  + ''c'')<sup>−1</sup> where ''c'' = cos θ/2 and ''s'' = sin θ/2. (In particular, when θ = π, this gives the symmetry ''j''(''z'') = −''z''<sup>−1</sup>.) In fact all Möbius transformations  ''z'' ↦ (α''z'' + β)(−γ''z''  +  δ)<sup>−1</sup> with αδ − βγ = 1 lie in ''G''<sub>''T''</sub>. Since PSL(2,'''R''') has trivial center, the center of ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> is trivial.<ref>{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|p=208}}</ref>\n* ''A''<sub>''T''</sub> is given by the linear operators ''Q''(''a'') with ''a'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> with  α<sub>''i''</sub> > 0.\n\nIn fact the Cartan decomposition for {{math|1=''G''<sub>''T''</sub>}} follows from the decomposition for {{math|1=''G''<sub>''D''</sub>}}. Given {{math|1=''z''}} in {{math|1=''D''}}, there is an element {{math|''u''}} in {{math|1=''K''<sub>''D''</sub>}}, the identity component of {{math|1=Γ<sub>''u''</sub>(''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>)}}, such that {{math|1=''z'' = ''u'' ∑ α<sub>''j''</sub>''e''<sub>''j''</sub>}} with {{math|1=α<sub>''j''</sub> ≥ 0}}. Since ||''z''|| < 1, it follows that {{math|1=α<sub>''j''</sub> < 1}}. Taking the Cayley transform of ''z'', it follows that every {{math|''w''}} in {{math|''T''}} can be written {{math|1=''w'' = ''k''∘ ''C'' ∑ α<sub>''j''</sub>''e''<sub>''j''</sub>}}, with {{math|''C''}} the Cayley transform and {{math|''k''}} in {{math|1=''K''<sub>''T''</sub>}}. Since\n{{math|1=''C'' ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub>''e''<sub>''i''</sub> = ∑ β<sub>''j''</sub>''e''<sub>''j''</sub> ''i''}} with\n{{math|1=β<sub>''j''</sub> = (1 + α<sub>''j''</sub>)(1 − α<sub>''j''</sub>)<sup>−1</sup>}}, the point {{math|''w''}} is of the form {{math|1=''w'' =''ka''(''i'')}} with {{math|''a''}} in {{math|''A''}}. Hence {{math|1=''G''<sub>''T''</sub> = ''K''<sub>''T''</sub>''A''<sub>''T''</sub>''K''<sub>''T''</sub>}}.\n\n===3-graded Lie algebras===\n\n===Iwasawa decomposition===\nThere is an [[Iwasawa decomposition]] for ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> corresponding to the action on the tube ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC'':<ref>{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|p=334}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_T=K_T A_T N_T.}</math>\n\n*''K''<sub>''T''</sub> is the stabilizer of ''i'' in ''iC'' ⊂ ''T''.\n* ''A''<sub>''T''</sub> is given by the linear operators ''Q''(''a'') where ''a'' = ∑ α<sub>''i''</sub> ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> with  α<sub>''i''</sub> > 0.\n* ''N''<sub>''T''</sub> is a lower unitriangular group on ''E''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. It is the semidirect product of the unipotent triangular group ''N'' appearing in the Iwasawa decomposition of ''G'' (the symmetry group of ''C'') and ''N''<sub>0</sub> = ''E'', group of translations ''x'' ↦ ''x'' + ''b''.\n\nThe group ''S'' = ''AN'' acts on ''E'' linearly and conjugation on ''N''<sub>0</sub> reproduces this action. Since the group ''S'' acts simply transitively on ''C'', it follows that ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub>=''S''⋅''N''<sub>0</sub> acts simply transitively on ''T'' = ''E'' + ''iC''.  Let ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> be the group of [[biholomorphism]]s of the tube ''T''. The Cayley transform shows that is isomorphic to the group ''H''<sub>''D''</sub> of biholomorphisms of the bounded domain ''D''. Since ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub> acts simply transitively on the tube ''T'' while ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> fixes ''ic'', they have trivial intersection.\n\nGiven ''g'' in ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>, take ''s'' in  ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub> such that ''g''<sup>−1</sup>(''i'')=''s''<sup>−1</sup>(''i''). then ''gs''<sup>−1</sup>  fixes ''i'' and therefore lies in ''K''<sub>''T''</sub>. Hence ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> = ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> ⋅''A''⋅''N''<sub>''T''</sub>. So the product is a group.\n\n===Lie group structure===\nBy a result of [[Henri Cartan]], ''H''<sub>''D''</sub> is a Lie group. Cartan's original proof is presented in {{harvtxt|Narasimhan|1971}}. It can also be deduced from the fact the ''D'' is complete for the [[Bergman metric]], for which the isometries form a Lie group; by [[Montel's theorem]], the group of biholomorphisms is a closed subgroup.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Cartan|1935}}\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}\n*{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1963}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994}}</ref>\n\nThat ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> is a Lie group can be seen directly in this case.  In fact there is a finite-dimensional 3-graded Lie algebra  <math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math> of vector fields with an involution σ. The Killing form is negative definite on the +1 eigenspace of σ  and positive definite on the −1 eigenspace. As a group ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>  normalizes <math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math> since the two subgroups ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> and ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub> do. The +1 eigenspace corresponds to the Lie algebra of ''K''<sub>''T''</sub>. Similarly the Lie algebras of the linear group ''AN'' and the affine group ''N''<sub>0</sub> lie in <math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math>. Since the group ''G''<sub>''T''</sub> has trivial center, the map into GL(<math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math>) is injective. Since ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> is compact, its image in GL(<math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math>) is compact. Since the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}_T</math> is compatible with that of ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub>, the image of ''AN''<sub>''T''</sub> is closed. Hence the image of the product is closed, since the image of ''K''<sub>''T''</sub> is compact. Since it is a closed subgroup, it follows that ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> is a Lie group.\n\n==Generalizations==\nEuclidean Jordan algebras can be used to construct Hermitian symmetric spaces of tube type. The remaining Hermitian symmetric spaces are Siegel domains of the second kind. They can be constructed using Euclidean [[Jordan triple system]]s, a generalization of Euclidean Jordan algebras. In fact for a Euclidean Jordan algebra ''E'' let\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a,b)=2([L(a),L(b)] + L(ab)).}</math>\n\nThen ''L''(''a'',''b'') gives a bilinear map into End ''E'' such that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a,b)^*=L(b,a)},\\,\\,\\, L(a,b)c=L(c,b)a</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[L(a,b),L(c,d)]=L(L(a,b)c,d)-L(c,L(b,a)d).}</math>\n\nAny such bilinear system is called a '''Euclidean Jordan triple system'''. By definition the operators ''L''(''a'',''b'') form a Lie subalgebra of End ''E''.\n\nThe [[Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction]] gives a one-one correspondence between Jordan triple systems and 3-graded Lie algebras\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}_0\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}_1,}</math>\n\nsatisfying\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[\\mathfrak{g}_p,\\mathfrak{g}_q]\\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}_{p+q}}</math>\n\nand equipped with an involutive automorphism σ reversing the grading. In this case\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L(a,b) = \\mathrm{ad}\\,[a,\\sigma(b)]}</math>\n\ndefines a Jordan triple system on <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}</math>. In the case of Euclidean Jordan algebras or triple systems the Kantor–Koecher–Tits construction can be identified with the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all homomorphic automorphisms of the corresponding [[bounded symmetric domain]].\nThe Lie algebra is constructed by taking <math>\\mathfrak{g}_0</math> to be the Lie subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> of End ''E'' generated by the L(''a'',''b'') and <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\pm 1}</math> to be copies of ''E''. The Lie bracket is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[(a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2)]=(T_1a_2-T_2a_1,[T_1,T_2]+L(a_1,b_2)-L(a_2,b_1),T_2^*b_1-T_1^*b_2)}</math>\n\nand the involution by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\sigma(a,T,b)=(b,-T^*,a).}</math>\n\nThe [[Killing form]] is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{B((a_1,T_1,b_1),(a_2,T_2,b_2))= (a_1,b_2) + (b_1,a_2) +  \\beta(T_1,T_2),}</math>\n\nwhere β(''T''<sub>1</sub>,''T''<sub>2</sub>) is the symmetric bilinear form defined by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\beta(L(a,b),L(c,d))=(L(a,b)c,d)=(L(c,d)a,b).}</math>\n\nThese formulas, originally derived for Jordan algebras, work equally well for Jordan triple systems.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1967}}\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1968}}\n*{{harvnb|Koecher|1969}}\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=218–219}}</ref>\nThe account in {{harvtxt|Koecher|1969}} develops the theory of [[bounded symmetric domain]]s starting from the standpoint of 3-graded Lie algebras. For a given finite-dimensional vector space ''E'', Koecher considers finite-dimensional Lie algebras <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of vector fields on ''E'' with polynomial coefficients of degree ≤ 2. <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{-1}</math> consists of the constant vector fields ∂<sub>''i''</sub> and <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{0}</math> must contain the [[Euler operator]] ''H'' = ∑ ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>⋅∂<sub>''i''</sub> as a central element. Requiring the existence of an involution σ leads directly to a Jordan triple structure on ''V'' as above. As for all Jordan triple structures, fixing ''c'' in ''E'',\nthe operators ''L''<sub>''c''</sub>(''a'') = ''L''(''a'',''c'') give ''E'' a Jordan algebra structure, determined by ''e''. The operators ''L''(''a'',''b'') themselves come from a Jordan algebra structure as above if and only if there are additional operators ''E''<sub>±</sub> in  <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\pm 1}</math> so that ''H'', ''E''<sub>±</sub> give a copy of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math>. The corresponding Weyl group element implements the involution σ. This case corresponds to that of Euclidean Jordan algebras.\n\nThe remaining cases are constructed uniformly by Koecher using involutions of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras.<ref>{{harvnb|Koecher|1969|p=85}}</ref> Let ''E'' be a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra and τ a Jordan algebra automorphism of ''E'' of period 2. Thus ''E'' = ''E''<sub>+1</sub> ⊕ ''E''<sub>−1</sub> has an eigenspace decomposition for τ with ''E''<sub>+1</sub> a Jordan subalgebra and ''E''<sub>−1</sub> a module. Moreover, a product of two elements in ''E''<sub>−1</sub> lies in ''E''<sub>+1</sub>. For ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''E''<sub>−1</sub>, set\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{L_0(a,b)c=L(a,b)c}</math>\n\nand (''a'',''b'')= Tr ''L''(''ab''). Then ''F'' = ''E''<sub>−1</sub> is a simple Euclidean Jordan triple system, obtained by restricting the triple system on ''E'' to ''F''.  Koecher exhibits explicit involutions of simple Euclidean Jordan algebras directly (see below). These Jordan triple systems correspond to irreducible Hermitian symmetric spaces given by Siegel domains of the second kind. In Cartan's listing, their compact duals are SU(''p'' + ''q'')/S(U(''p'') × U(''q'')) with ''p'' ≠ ''q'' (AIII), SO(2''n'')/U(''n'') with ''n'' odd (DIII) and E<sub>6</sub>/SO(10) × U(1) (EIII).\n\n'''Examples'''\n*''F'' is the space of ''p'' by ''q'' matrices over '''R''' with ''p'' ≠ ''q''. In this case ''L''(''a'',''b'')''c''= ''ab''<sup>''t''</sup>''c'' + ''cb''<sup>''t''</sup>''a'' with inner product (''a'',''b'') = Tr ''ab''<sup>''t''</sup>. This is Koecher's construction for the involution on ''E'' = ''H''<sub>''p'' + ''q''</sub>('''R''') given by conjugating by the diagonal matrix with ''p'' digonal entries equal to 1 and ''q'' to −1.\n*''F'' is the space of real skew-symmetric ''m'' by ''m'' matrices. In this case ''L''(''a'',''b'')''c'' = ''abc'' + ''cba'' with inner product (''a'',''b'') = −Tr ''ab''. After removing a factor of √(-1), this is Koecher's construction applied to complex conjugation on ''E'' = ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''').\n*''F'' is the direct sum of two copies of the Cayley numbers, regarded as 1 by 2 matrices. This triple system is obtained by Koecher's construction for the canonical involution defined by any minimal idempotent in ''E'' = ''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''').\n\nThe classification of Euclidean Jordan triple systems has been achieved by generalizing the methods of Jordan, von Neumann and Wigner, but the proofs are more involved.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Loos|1977}}\n*{{harvnb|Neher|1979}}\n*{{harvnb|Neher|1980}}\n*{{harvnb|Neher|1981}}\n*{{harvnb|Neher|1987}}\n</ref> Prior differential geometric methods of {{harvtxt|Kobayashi|Nagano|1965}}, invoking a 3-graded Lie algebra, and of {{harvtxt|Loos|1971}}, {{harvtxt|Loos|1985}} lead to a more rapid classification.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Albert|first= A.

      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Valya algebra''' (or '''Valentina algebra''') is a [[Algebra over a field#Non-associative algebras|nonassociative algebra]] ''M'' over a field ''F'' whose [[product (mathematics)|multiplicative binary operation]] ''g'' satisfies the following axioms:\n\n1. The [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetry]] condition  \n:<math>g (A, B) =-g (B, A) </math> \nfor all <math>A,B \\in M</math>. \n\n2. The Valya identity \n:<math> J (g (A_1, A_2), g (A_3, A_4), g (A_5, A_6)) =0 </math>\nfor all <math>A_k \\in M</math>, where k=1,2,...,6, and\n\n<math> J (A, B, C):= g (g (A, B), C)+g (g (B, C), A)+g (g (C, A), B). </math>\n\n3. The bilinear condition\n:<math> g(aA+bB,C)=ag(A,C)+bg(B,C) </math>\nfor all <math>A,B,C \\in M</math> and <math>a,b \\in F</math>. \n\nWe say that M is a Valya algebra if the [[commutant]] of this algebra is a Lie subalgebra. Each [[Lie algebra]] is a Valya algebra. \n\nThere is the following relationship between the [[commutant-associative algebra]] and Valentina algebra. The replacement of the multiplication g(A,B) in an algebra M by the operation of commutation [A,B]=g(A,B)-g(B,A), makes it into the algebra <math>M^{(-)}</math>. \nIf M is a [[commutant-associative algebra]], then <math>M^{(-)}</math> is a Valya algebra. A Valya algebra is a generalization of a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Examples==\n\nLet us give the following examples regarding Valya algebras.\n\n(1) Every finite Valya algebra is the [[Tangent space|tangent algebra]] of an analytic local commutant-associative [[Quasigroup|loop]] (Valya loop) as each finite [[Lie algebra]] is the tangent algebra of an analytic local group ([[Lie group]]). This is the analog of the classical correspondence between analytic local groups ([[Lie groups]]) and [[Lie algebra]]s.\n\n(2) A bilinear operation for the [[differential form|differential 1-forms]]\n:<math> \\alpha=F_k(x)\\, dx^k , \\quad \\beta=G_k(x)\\, dx^k </math>\non a symplectic manifold can be introduced by the rule\n: <math> (\\alpha,\\beta)_0=d \\Psi(\\alpha,\\beta)+ \\Psi(d\\alpha,\\beta)+\\Psi(\\alpha,d\\beta), \\, </math>\nwhere <math>(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> is 1-form. A set of all nonclosed 1-forms, together with this operation, is Lie algebra.\n\nIf <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> are closed 1-forms, then \n<math>d\\alpha=d\\beta=0</math> and\n: <math> (\\alpha,\\beta)=d \\Psi(\\alpha,\\beta). \\,</math>\nA set of all closed 1-forms, together with this bracket, form a [[Lie algebra]]. A set of all nonclosed 1-forms together with the bilinear operation <math>(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> is a Valya algebra, and it is not a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Malcev algebra]]\n* [[Alternative algebra]]\n* [[Commutant-associative algebra]]\n\n==References==\n* A.

Conversely, to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra over real or complex numbers, there is a corresponding [[connected space|connected]] Lie group unique up to finite coverings ([[Lie's third theorem]]). This [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence|correspondence]] allows one to study the structure and [[List of simple Lie groups|classification]] of Lie groups in terms of Lie algebras.\n\nIn physics, Lie groups appear as symmetry groups of physical systems, and their Lie algebras (tangent vectors near the identity) may be thought of as infinitesimal symmetry motions, directions of symmetry. Thus Lie algebras and their representations are used extensively in physics, notably in [[Hydrogen atom|quantum mechanics]] and particle physics.\n\nAn elementary example is the space of three dimensional vectors <math>\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with the bracket operation defined by the [[cross product]] <math>[x,y]=x\\times y.</math> This is skew-symmetric since <math>x\\times y = -y\\times x</math>, and instead of associativity it satisfies the Jacobi identity: <blockquote><math> x\\times(y\\times z) \\ =\\ (x\\times y)\\times z \\ +\\  y\\times(x\\times z). </math></blockquote>This is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of [[3D rotation group|rotations of space]], and each vector <math>v\\in\\R^3</math> may be pictured as an infinitesimal rotation around the axis ''v'', with velocity equal to the magnitude of ''v''. The Lie bracket is a measure of the non-commutativity between two rotations: since a rotation commutes with itself, we have the alternating property <math>[x,x]=x\\times x = 0</math>.\n\n== History ==\nLie algebras were introduced to study the concept of [[infinitesimal transformation]]s by [[Sophus Lie|Marius Sophus Lie]] in the 1870s,<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2000}}</ref> and independently discovered by [[Wilhelm Killing]]<ref>{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|2005}}</ref> in the 1880s. The name ''Lie algebra'' was given by [[Hermann Weyl]] in the 1930s; in older texts, the term ''infinitesimal group'' is used.\n\n== Definitions ==\n===Definition of a Lie algebra===\nA Lie algebra is a [[vector space]] <math>\\,\\mathfrak{g}</math> over some [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb{F}</math><ref group=nb>{{harvtxt|Bourbaki|1989|loc=Section 2.}} allows more generally for a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[commutative ring]] with [[Ring (mathematics)#Multiplicative identity: mandatory vs. optional|unit element]].</ref> together with a [[binary operation]] <math>[\\,\\cdot\\,,\\cdot\\,]: \\mathfrak{g}\\times\\mathfrak{g}\\to\\mathfrak{g}</math> called the Lie bracket satisfying the following axioms:\n\n* [[Bilinear operator|Bilinearity]],\n::<math> [a x + b y, z] = a [x, z] + b [y, z], </math>\n::<math> [z, a x + b y] = a[z, x] + b [z, y] </math>\n:for all scalars ''a'', ''b'' in <math>\\mathbb F</math> and all elements ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\n* [[Alternatization|Alternativity]],\n::<math> [x,x]=0\\ </math>\n:for all ''x''  in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\n* The [[Jacobi identity]],\n:: <math> [x,[y,z]] + [z,[x,y]] + [y,[z,x]] = 0 \\ </math>\n:for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nUsing bilinearity to expand the Lie bracket <math> [x+y,x+y] </math> and using alternativity shows that <math> [x,y] + [y,x]=0\\ </math> for all elements ''x'', ''y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, showing that bilinearity and alternativity together imply \n* [[Anticommutativity]],\n:: <math> [x,y] = -[y,x],\\ </math> \n:for all elements ''x'', ''y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. If the field's [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] is not 2 then anticommutativity implies alternativity.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1978|p=1}}</ref>\n\nIt is customary to denote a Lie algebra by a lower-case [[fraktur]] letter such as <math>\\mathfrak{g, h, b, n}</math>. If a Lie algebra is associated with a [[Lie group]], then the algebra is denoted by the fraktur version of the group: for example the Lie algebra of [[special unitary group|SU(''n'')]] is <math>\\mathfrak{su}(n)</math>.\n\n===Generators and dimension===\nElements of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are said [[Generator (mathematics)|generate]] it if the smallest subalgebra containing these elements is <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> itself. The ''dimension'' of a Lie algebra is its dimension as a vector space over ''F''. The cardinality of a minimal generating set of a Lie algebra is always less than or equal to its dimension.\n\nSee the [[classification of low-dimensional real Lie algebras]] for other small examples.\n\n=== Subalgebras, ideals and homomorphisms ===\nThe Lie bracket is not [[associative]], meaning that <math>[[x,y],z]</math> need not equal <math>[x,[y,z]]</math>. (However, it is ''[[flexible algebra|flexible]]''.) Nonetheless, much of the terminology of associative [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] and [[associative algebra|algebra]]s is commonly applied to Lie algebras. A ''Lie subalgebra''  is a subspace <math>\\mathfrak{h} \\subseteq \\mathfrak{g}</math> which is closed under the Lie bracket.  An ''ideal'' <math>\\mathfrak i\\subseteq\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a subalgebra satisfying the stronger condition:<ref>Due to the anticommutativity of the commutator, the notions of a left and right ideal in a Lie algebra coincide.</ref>\n\n:<math>[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak i]\\subseteq \\mathfrak i.</math>\n\nA Lie algebra ''homomorphism'' is a linear map compatible with the respective Lie brackets:\n\n:<math> \\phi: \\mathfrak{g}\\to\\mathfrak{g'}, \\quad \\phi([x,y])=[\\phi(x),\\phi(y)] \\ \\text{for all}\\ \nx,y \\in \\mathfrak g. </math>\n\nAs for associative rings, ideals are precisely the kernels of homomorphisms; given a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and an ideal <math>\\mathfrak i</math> in it, one constructs the ''factor algebra'' or ''quotient algebra'' <math>\\mathfrak{g}/\\mathfrak i</math>, and the [[first isomorphism theorem]] holds for Lie algebras.\n\nSince the Lie bracket is a kind of infinitesimal [[commutator]] of the corresponding Lie group, we say that two elements <math>x,y\\in\\mathfrak g</math> ''commute'' if their bracket vanishes: <math>[x,y]=0</math>. \n\nThe [[centralizer]] subalgebra of a subset <math>S\\subset \\mathfrak{g}</math> is the set of elements commuting with ''S'': that is, <math>\\mathfrak{z}_{\\mathfrak g}(S) = \\{x\\in\\mathfrak g\\ \\mid\\ [x, s] = 0 \\ \\text{ for all } s\\in S\\}</math>. The centralizer of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> itself is the ''center''  <math>\\mathfrak{z}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.

The corresponding Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is the space of matrices which are tangent vectors to ''G'' inside the linear space <math>M_n(\\mathbb{C})</math>: this consists of derivatives of smooth curves in ''G'' at the identity: <blockquote><math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\{ X = c'(0) \\in M_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\ \\mid\\ \\text{ smooth } c : \\mathbb{R}\\to G, \\ c(0) = I \\}.</math></blockquote>The Lie bracket of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is given by the commutator of matrices, <math>[X,Y]=XY-YX</math>.

Similarly, one can define the corresponding real Lie group <math>{\\rm SL}_n(\\mathbb{R})</math> and its Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\mathbb{R})</math>.\n* The [[unitary group]] <math>U(n)</math> consists of ''n''&nbsp;×&nbsp;''n'' unitary matrices (satisfying <math>U^*=U^{-1}</math>).

Its Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(n)</math> consists of real skew-symmetric matrices (<math>X^{\\rm T}=-X</math>). The full orthogonal group <math>\\mathrm{O}(n)</math>, without the determinant-one condition, consists of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math> and a separate connected component, so it has the ''same'' Lie algebra as <math>\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math>. Similarly, one can define a complex version of this group and algebra, simply by allowing complex  matrix entries.\n\n=== Two dimensions ===\n\n* On any field <math>F</math> there is, up to isomorphism, a single two-dimensional nonabelian Lie algebra with generators ''x, y,''  and bracket defined as <math> \\left [x, y\\right ] = y</math>. It generates the [[Affine group#Matrix representation|affine group in one dimension]].\n\n:This can be realized by the matrices: \n::<math> x= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right), \\qquad y=   \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{array}\\right),   </math>\n:and, for <math>F = \\mathbb{R}</math> or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, the resulting group elements are upper triangular 2×2 matrices with unit lower diagonal:\n::<math> \\exp(ax+by)= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} e^a & \\tfrac{b}{a}(e^a-1)\\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right) . </math>\n\n=== Three dimensions ===\n\n* The [[Heisenberg algebra]] <math>{\\rm H}_3(\\mathbb{R})</math> is a three-dimensional Lie algebra generated by elements {{mvar|x}},  {{mvar|y}}  and  {{mvar|z}} with Lie brackets\n\n:: <math>[x,y]=z,\\quad [x,z]=0, \\quad [y,z]=0</math> .\n:It is realized as the space of 3&times;3 strictly upper-triangular matrices, with the commutator Lie bracket:\n::<math>\nx = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&1&0\\\\\n0&0&0\\\\\n0&0&0\n\\end{array}\\right),\\quad\ny = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&0&0\\\\\n0&0&1\\\\\n0&0&0\n\\end{array}\\right),\\quad\nz = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&0&1\\\\\n0&0&0\\\\\n0&0&0\n\\end{array}\\right)~.\\quad\n</math>\n\n:Any element of the [[Heisenberg group]] is thus representable as a product of group generators, i.e., [[matrix exponential]]s of these Lie algebra generators, \n::<math>\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n1&a&c\\\\\n0&1&b\\\\\n0&0&1\n\\end{array}\\right)= e^{by} e^{cz} e^{ax}~.\n</math>\n\n* The Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> of the group SO(3) is spanned by the three matrices<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|}} Example 3.27</ref>\n::<math>\nF_1 = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&0&0\\\\\n0&0&-1\\\\\n0&1&0\n\\end{array}\\right),\\quad\nF_2 = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&0&1\\\\\n0&0&0\\\\\n-1&0&0\n\\end{array}\\right),\\quad\nF_3 = \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0&-1&0\\\\\n1&0&0\\\\\n0&0&0\n\\end{array}\\right)~.\\quad\n</math>\n:The commutation relations among these generators are\n::<math>[F_1, F_2] = F_3,</math>\n:: <math>[F_2, F_3] = F_1,</math>\n:: <math>[F_3, F_1] = F_2.</math>\n::\n:The three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with the Lie bracket given by the [[cross product]] of [[Vector (geometric)|vectors]] has the same commutation relations as above: thus, it is isomorphic to <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math>. This Lie algebra appears in [[quantum mechanics]] as the components of the [[angular momentum]] operator.\n\n=== Infinite dimensions ===\n\n* An important class of infinite-dimensional real Lie algebras arises in [[differential topology]]. The space of smooth [[vector field]]s on a [[differentiable manifold]] ''M'' forms a Lie algebra, where the Lie bracket is defined to be the [[Lie bracket of vector fields|commutator of vector fields]]. One way of expressing the Lie bracket is through the formalism of [[Lie derivative]]s, which identifies a vector field ''X'' with a first order partial differential operator ''L''<sub>''X''</sub> acting on smooth functions by letting ''L''<sub>''X''</sub>(''f'') be the directional derivative of the function ''f'' in the direction of ''X''. The Lie bracket [''X'',''Y''] of two vector fields is the vector field defined through its action on functions by the formula:\n \t\n:: <math> L_{[X,Y]}f=L_X(L_Y f)-L_Y(L_X f).\\,</math>\n\n*[[Kac–Moody algebra|Kac–Moody algebras]] are a large class of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras whose structure is very similar to the finite-dimensional cases above.\n* The [[Moyal bracket|Moyal algebra]] is an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra that contains all [[Classical Lie groups#Relationship with bilinear forms|classical Lie algebra]]s as subalgebras.\n* The [[Virasoro algebra]] is of paramount importance in [[string theory]].\n\n== Representations ==\n{{main|Lie algebra representation}}\n\n===Definitions===\nGiven a vector space ''V'', let <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math> denote the Lie algebra consisting of all linear [[endomorphism]]s of ''V'', with bracket given by <math>[X,Y]=XY-YX</math>. A ''representation'' of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on ''V'' is a Lie algebra homomorphism\n:<math>\\pi: \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak{gl}(V).</math>\n\nA representation is said to be ''faithful'' if its kernel is zero. [[Ado's theorem]]<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|1962|loc=Ch. VI}}</ref> states that every finite-dimensional Lie algebra has a faithful representation on a finite-dimensional vector space.\n\n===Adjoint representation===\nFor any Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, we can define a representation\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}\\colon\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>\ngiven by <math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y]</math> is a representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on the vector space <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> called the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].\n\n===Goals of representation theory===\nOne important aspect of the study of Lie algebras (especially semisimple Lie algebras) is the study of their representations. (Indeed, most of the books listed in the references section devote a substantial fraction of their pages to representation theory.) Although Ado's theorem is an important result, the primary goal of representation theory is not to find a faithful representation of a given Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. Indeed, in the semisimple case, the adjoint representation is already faithful. Rather the goal is to understand ''all'' possible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, up to the natural notion of equivalence. In the semisimple case, [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility|Weyl's theorem]]<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|loc=Theorem 10.9}}</ref> says that every finite-dimensional representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations (those with no nontrivial invariant subspaces). The irreducible representations, in turn, are classified by a [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|theorem of the highest weight]].\n\n===Representation theory in physics===\nThe representation theory of Lie algebras plays an important role in various parts of theoretical physics. There, one considers operators on the space of states that satisfy certain natural commutation relations. These commutation relations typically come from a symmetry of the problem—specifically, they are the relations of the Lie algebra of the relevant symmetry group. An example would be the [[angular momentum operator]]s, whose commutation relations are those of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> of the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. Typically, the space of states is very far from being irreducible under the pertinent operators, but one can attempt to decompose it into irreducible pieces. In doing so, one needs to know the irreducible representations of the given Lie algebra. In the study of the quantum [[Hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen atom]], for example, quantum mechanics textbooks give (without calling it that) a classification of the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math>.\n\n== Structure theory and classification ==\n\nLie algebras can be classified to some extent. In particular, this has an application to the classification of Lie groups.\n\n=== Abelian, nilpotent, and solvable ===\nAnalogously to abelian, nilpotent, and solvable groups, defined in terms of the derived subgroups, one can define abelian, nilpotent, and solvable Lie algebras.\n\nA Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is ''abelian{{anchor|abelian}}'' if the Lie bracket vanishes, i.e. [''x'',''y''] = 0, for all ''x'' and ''y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. Abelian Lie algebras correspond to commutative (or [[abelian group|abelian]]) connected Lie groups such as vector spaces <math>\\mathbb{K}^n</math> or [[torus|tori]] <math>\\mathbb{T}^n</math>, and are all of the form <math>\\mathfrak{k}^n,</math> meaning an ''n''-dimensional vector space with the trivial Lie bracket.\n\nA more general class of Lie algebras is defined by the vanishing of all commutators of given length. A Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is ''[[nilpotent Lie algebra|nilpotent]]'' if the [[lower central series]]\n\n:<math> \\mathfrak{g} > [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}] > [[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],\\mathfrak{g}] > [[[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],\\mathfrak{g}],\\mathfrak{g}] > \\cdots</math>\n\nbecomes zero eventually. By [[Engel's theorem]], a Lie algebra is nilpotent if and only if for every ''u'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> the [[adjoint endomorphism]]\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}(u):\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{g}, \\quad \\operatorname{ad}(u)v=[u,v]</math>\n\nis nilpotent.\n\nMore generally still, a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is said to be ''[[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]]'' if the [[derived series]]:\n\n:<math> \\mathfrak{g} > [\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}] > [[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]] > [[[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]],[[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}],[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}]]]  > \\cdots</math>\n\nbecomes zero eventually.\n\nEvery finite-dimensional Lie algebra has a unique maximal solvable ideal, called its [[radical of a Lie algebra|radical]]. Under the Lie correspondence, nilpotent (respectively, solvable) connected Lie groups correspond to nilpotent (respectively, solvable) Lie algebras.\n\n=== Simple and semisimple ===\n{{main|Semisimple Lie algebra}}\nA Lie algebra is \"[[Simple Lie algebra|simple]]\" if it has no non-trivial ideals and is not abelian. (That is to say, a one-dimensional—necessarily abelian—Lie algebra is by definition not simple, even though it has no nontrivial ideals.) A Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is called ''[[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]]'' if it is isomorphic to a direct sum of simple algebras. There are several equivalent characterizations of semisimple algebras, such as having no nonzero solvable ideals.\n\nThe concept of semisimplicity for Lie algebras is closely related with the complete reducibility (semisimplicity) of their representations. When the ground field <math>\\mathbb{F}</math> has [[characteristic (field)|characteristic]] zero, any finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is semisimple (i.e., direct sum of irreducible representations.) In general, a Lie algebra is called [[reductive Lie algebra|reductive]] if the adjoint representation is semisimple. Thus, a semisimple Lie algebra is reductive.<!--\n of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> over ''F'' is equivalent to the complete reducibility of all finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra representation|representations]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> An early proof of this statement proceeded via connection with compact groups ([[Weyl's unitary trick]]), but later entirely algebraic proofs were found.-->\n\n=== Cartan's criterion ===\n\n[[Cartan's criterion]] gives conditions for a Lie algebra to be nilpotent, solvable, or semisimple. It is based on the notion of the [[Killing form]], a [[symmetric bilinear form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> defined by the formula\n: <math>K(u,v)=\\operatorname{tr}(\\operatorname{ad}(u)\\operatorname{ad}(v)),</math>\nwhere tr denotes the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace of a linear operator]]. A Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is semisimple if and only if the Killing form is [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]]. A Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is solvable if and only if <math>K(\\mathfrak{g},[\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{g}])=0.</math>\n\n=== Classification ===\n\nThe [[Levi decomposition]] expresses an arbitrary Lie algebra as a [[semidirect sum]] of its solvable radical and a semisimple Lie algebra, almost in a canonical way. Furthermore, semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field have been completely classified through their [[root system]]s. However, the classification of solvable Lie algebras is a 'wild' problem, and cannot{{Clarify|date=April 2009}} be accomplished in general.\n\n== Relation to Lie groups ==\n{{main|Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence}}\nAlthough Lie algebras are often studied in their own right, historically they arose as a means to study [[Lie group]]s.\n\nWe now briefly outline the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebras. Any Lie group gives rise to a canonically determined Lie algebra (concretely, ''the tangent space at the identity''). Conversely, for any finite-dimensional Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, there exists a corresponding connected Lie group <math>G</math> with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. This is [[Lie's third theorem]]; see the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]]. This Lie group is not determined uniquely; however, any two Lie groups with the same Lie algebra are ''locally isomorphic'', and in particular, have the same [[universal cover]]. For instance, the [[special orthogonal group]] [[SO(3)]] and the [[special unitary group]] [[SU(2)]] give rise to the same Lie algebra, which is isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with the cross-product, but SU(2) is a simply-connected twofold cover of SO(3).\n\nIf we consider ''simply connected'' Lie groups, however, we have a one-to-one correspondence: For each (finite-dimensional real) Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, there is a unique simply connected Lie group <math>G</math> with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\nThe correspondence between Lie algebras and Lie groups is used in several ways, including in the [[list of simple Lie groups|classification of Lie groups]] and the related matter of the [[representation theory]] of Lie groups.  Every representation of a Lie algebra lifts uniquely to a representation of the corresponding connected, simply connected Lie group, and conversely every representation of any Lie group induces a representation of the group's Lie algebra; the representations are in one-to-one correspondence.  Therefore, knowing the representations of a Lie algebra settles the question of representations of the group.\n\nAs for classification, it can be shown that any connected Lie group with a given Lie algebra is isomorphic to the universal cover mod a discrete central subgroup.  So classifying Lie groups becomes simply a matter of counting the discrete subgroups of the [[Center (algebra)|center]], once the classification of Lie algebras is known (solved by [[Élie Cartan|Cartan]] et al. in the [[Semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] case).\n\nIf the Lie algebra is infinite-dimensional, the issue is more subtle.  In many instances, the exponential map is not even locally a [[homeomorphism]] (for example, in Diff('''S'''<sup>1</sup>), one may find diffeomorphisms arbitrarily close to the identity that are not in the image of exp).  Furthermore, some infinite-dimensional Lie algebras are not the Lie algebra of any group.\n\n== Lie algebra with additional structures ==\nA Lie algebra can be equipped with some additional structures that are assumed to be compatible with the bracket. For example, a [[graded Lie algebra]] is a Lie algebra with a graded vector space structure. If it also comes with differential (so that the underlying graded vector space is a [[chain complex]]), then it is called a [[differential graded Lie algebra]].\n\nA [[simplicial Lie algebra]] is a [[simplicial object]] in the category of Lie algebras; in other words, it is obtained by replacing the underlying set with a [[simplicial set]] (so it might be better thought of as a family of Lie algebras).\n\n== Lie ring ==\nA ''Lie ring'' arises as a generalisation of Lie algebras, or through the study of the [[lower central series]] of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]]. A Lie ring is defined as a [[nonassociative ring]] with multiplication that is [[anticommutative]] and satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]]. More specifically we can define a Lie ring <math>L</math> to be an [[abelian group]] with an operation <math>[\\cdot,\\cdot]</math> that has the following properties:\n\n* Bilinearity:\n\n::<math> [x + y, z] = [x, z] + [y, z], \\quad  [z, x + y] = [z, x] + [z, y] </math>\n\n:for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' &isin; ''L''.\n\n* The ''Jacobi identity'':\n\n:: <math> [x,[y,z]] + [y,[z,x]] + [z,[x,y]] = 0 \\quad </math>\n\n:for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''L''.\n\n* For all ''x'' in ''L'':\n\n::<math> [x,x]=0 \\quad </math>\n\nLie rings need not be [[Lie group]]s under addition.  Any Lie algebra is an example of a Lie ring.  Any [[associative ring]] can be made into a Lie ring by defining a bracket operator <math>[x,y] = xy - yx</math>.  Conversely to any Lie algebra there is a corresponding ring, called the [[universal enveloping algebra]].\n\nLie rings are used in the study of finite [[p-group]]s through the ''Lazard correspondence'''.  The lower central factors of a ''p''-group are finite abelian ''p''-groups, so modules over '''Z'''/''p'''''Z'''.  The direct sum of the lower central factors is given the structure of a Lie ring by defining the bracket to be the [[commutator]] of two coset representatives.  The Lie ring structure is enriched with another module homomorphism, the ''p''th power map, making the associated Lie ring a so-called restricted Lie ring.\n\nLie rings are also useful in the definition of a [[p-adic analytic group]]s and their endomorphisms by studying Lie algebras over rings of integers such as the [[p-adic integers]].  The definition of finite groups of Lie type due to Chevalley involves restricting from a Lie algebra over the complex numbers to a Lie algebra over the integers, and the reducing modulo ''p'' to get a Lie algebra over a finite field.\n\n=== Examples ===\n* Any Lie algebra over a general [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] instead of a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] is an example of a Lie ring.  Lie rings are ''not'' [[Lie group]]s under addition, despite the name.\n* Any associative ring can be made into a Lie ring by defining a bracket operator\n:: <math>[x,y] = xy - yx.</math>\n* For an example of a Lie ring arising from the study of [[Group (mathematics)|groups]], let <math>G</math> be a group with <math>(x,y) = x^{-1}y^{-1}xy</math> the commutator operation, and let <math>G = G_0 \\supseteq G_1 \\supseteq G_2 \\supseteq \\cdots \\supseteq G_n \\supseteq \\cdots</math> be a [[central series]]  in <math>G</math> &mdash; that is the commutator subgroup <math>(G_i,G_j)</math> is contained in <math>G_{i+j}</math> for any <math>i,j</math>. Then\n\n:: <math>L = \\bigoplus G_i/G_{i+1}</math>\n\n:is a Lie ring with addition supplied by the group operation (which will be × in each homogeneous part), and the bracket operation given by\n\n:: <math>[xG_i, yG_j] = (x,y)G_{i+j}\\ </math>\n\n:extended linearly. Note that the centrality of the series ensures the commutator <math>(x,y)</math> gives the bracket operation the appropriate Lie theoretic properties.\n\n==See also==\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-2}}\n* [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra]]\n* [[Anyonic Lie algebra]]\n* [[Chiral Lie algebra]]\n* [[Free Lie algebra]]<!-- Need to be discussed somewhere in this article but not clear where, probably not too early. -->\n* [[Index of a Lie algebra]]\n* [[Lie algebra cohomology]]\n* [[Lie algebra extension]]\n* [[Lie algebra representation]]\n* [[Lie bialgebra]]\n* [[Lie coalgebra]]\n* [[Lie operad]]\n* [[Particle physics and representation theory]]\n\n{{Col-2-of-2}}\n* [[Lie superalgebra]]\n* [[Poisson algebra]]\n* [[Pre-Lie algebra]]\n* [[Quantum groups]]\n* [[Moyal bracket|Moyal algebra]]\n* [[Quasi-Frobenius Lie algebra]]\n* [[Quasi-Lie algebra]]\n* [[Restricted Lie algebra]]\n* [[Serre relations]]\n* [[Symmetric Lie algebra]] <!-- missing article -->\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Beltiţă|first= Daniel|title=Smooth Homogeneous Structures in Operator Theory|series=Chapman & Hall/CRC Monographs and Surveys in Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume= 137|publisher= Chapman & Hall/CRC Press|year= 2006|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4200-3480-6|mr=2188389}}\n* Boza, Luis; Fedriani, Eugenio M. and Núñez, Juan.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''pre-Lie algebra''' is an [[algebraic structure]] on a [[vector space]] that describes some properties of objects such as [[Tree (graph theory)|rooted trees]] and [[vector fields]] on [[affine space]].\n\nThe notion of pre-Lie algebra has been introduced by [[Murray Gerstenhaber]] in his work on [[Deformation theory|deformations]] of algebras.\n\nPre-Lie algebras have been considered under some other names, among which one can cite left-symmetric algebras, right-symmetric algebras or Vinberg algebras.\n\n== Definition ==\nA pre-Lie algebra <math>(V,\\triangleleft)</math> is a vector space <math>V</math> with a bilinear map <math>\\triangleleft : V \\otimes V \\to V</math>, satisfying the relation\n<math>\n(x \\triangleleft y) \\triangleleft z - x \\triangleleft (y \\triangleleft z) = (x \\triangleleft z) \\triangleleft y - x \\triangleleft (z \\triangleleft y).\n</math>\n\nThis identity can be seen as the invariance of the [[associator]] <math>(x,y,z) = (x \\triangleleft y) \\triangleleft z - x \\triangleleft (y \\triangleleft z)</math> under the exchange of the two variables <math>y</math> and <math>z</math>.\n\nEvery [[associative algebra]] is hence also a pre-Lie algebra, as the associator vanishes identically.  Although weaker than associativity, the defining relation of a pre-Lie algebra still implies that the commutator <math> x \\triangleleft y - y \\triangleleft x </math> is a Lie bracket.  In particular, the Jacobi identity for the commutator follows from cycling the <math> x,y,z </math> terms in the defining relation for pre-Lie algebras, above.\n\n== Examples ==\n=== [[Vector field]]s on an affine space ===\n\nLet <math>U \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</math> be an open neighborhood of <math> \\mathbb{R}^n</math>, parameterised by variables <math> x_1,\\cdots,x_n</math>.  Given vector fields <math> u= u_i \\partial_{x_i}</math>, <math> v=v_j \\partial_{x_j}</math> we define <math> u \\triangleleft v = v_j \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j} \\partial x_i</math>.  \n\nThe difference between <math>(u \\triangleleft v) \\triangleleft w</math> and <math>u \\triangleleft (v \\triangleleft w)</math>, is\n<math> (u \\triangleleft v) \\triangleleft w - u \\triangleleft (v \\triangleleft w) = v_j w_k \\frac{\\partial^2 u_i}{\\partial x_j \\partial x_k}\\partial_{x_i} </math>\nwhich is symmetric in <math> v </math> and <math> w </math>.  Thus <math> \\triangleleft </math> defines a pre-Lie algebra structure.\n\nGiven a manifold <math> M </math> and homeomorphisms <math> \\phi, \\phi'</math> from <math> U,U'\\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</math> to overlapping open neighborhoods of <math> M </math>, they each define a pre-Lie algebra structure <math> \\triangleleft, \\triangleleft'</math> on vector fields defined on the overlap.  Whilst <math> \\triangleleft </math> need not agree with <math>\\triangleleft'</math>, their commutators do agree: <math> u \\triangleleft v - v \\triangleleft u =u \\triangleleft' v - v\\triangleleft' u =[v,u]</math>, the Lie bracket of <math> v </math> and <math> u </math>. \n\n=== [[Rooted tree]]s ===\n\nLet <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> be the [[free vector space]] spanned by all rooted trees.\n\nOne can introduce a bilinear product <math>\\curvearrowleft</math> on <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> as follows.

This algebra is well studied and understood, and is often used as a model for the study of other Lie algebras.  The [[Lie group]] that it generates is the [[special linear group]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})</math> is central to the study of [[special relativity]], [[general relativity]] and [[supersymmetry]]: its [[fundamental representation]] is the so-called [[spinor representation]], while its [[adjoint endomorphism|adjoint representation]] generates the [[Lorentz group]] SO(3,1) of special relativity.\n\nThe algebra <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{R})</math> plays an important role in the study of [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[fractal]]s, as it generates the [[Möbius group]] [[SL(2,R)]], which describes the automorphisms of the [[Hyperbolic geometry#Models of the hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic plane]], the simplest [[Riemann surface]] of negative curvature; by contrast, [[SL(2,C)]] describes the automorphisms of the hyperbolic 3-dimensional ball.\n\n== Representation Theory of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math> ==\n\nThe simplest non-trivial Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})</math>, consisting of two-by-two matrices with zero trace. There are three basis elements, <math>e</math>,<math>f</math>, and <math>h</math>, with\n\n<math>e = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\n0&1\\\\\n0&0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n</math>\n<math>f = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\n0&0\\\\\n1&0\n\\end{array}\\right)\n</math>\nand\n<math>h = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc}\n1&0\\\\\n0&-1\n\\end{array}\\right)\n</math>\n\nThe commutators are\n\n<math>[e,f]=h</math>, <math>[h,f]=-2f</math>, and <math>[h,e]=2e</math>\n\nLet <math>V</math> be a finite irreducible [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math>, and let <math>v</math> be an [[eigenvector]] of <math>h</math> with the highest [[eigenvalue]] <math>\\lambda</math>. Then,\n\n<math>[h,e]v=hev-ehv=2ev</math>\n\nor\n\n<math>hev=(\\lambda+2)ev</math>\n\nSince <math>v</math> is the eigenvector of highest eigenvalue, <math>ev=0</math>. Similarly, we can show that\n\n<math>hfv=(\\lambda-2)fv</math>\n\nand since h has a lowest eigenvalue, there is a <math>N</math> such that <math>f^N v=0</math>. We will take the smallest <math>N</math> such that this happens.\n\nWe can then recursively calculate\n\n<math>ef^k v= (-k^2+(\\lambda+1)k)f^{k-1} v</math>\n\nand we find\n\n<math>e^k f^k v=k!h(h-1)...(h-k+1) v</math>\n\nTaking <math>k=N</math>, we get\n\n<math>0=e^N f^N v=N!h(h-1)...(h-N+1) v</math>\n\nSince we chose <math>N</math> to be the smallest exponent such that <math>f^N v=0</math>, we conclude that\n<math>\\lambda=N-1</math> (for example by writing <math> 0=e f^{N} v= (-N^2+(\\lambda+1)N)f^{N-1} v</math>). From this, we see that\n\n<math>v</math>, <math>fv</math>, ...\n<math>f^{\\lambda} v</math>\n\nare all nonzero, and it is easy to show that they are linearly independent. \nTherefore, for each <math> N</math>, there is a unique, up to isomorphism, irreducible representation <math>V</math> of dimension <math>N</math> spanned by elements <math>v</math>, <math>fv</math>, ...\n<math>f^{\\lambda} v</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 4.32</ref>\n\nThe beautiful special case of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math> shows a general way to find irreducible representations of Lie Algebras. Namely, we divide the algebra to three subalgebras \"h\" (the [[Cartan algebra|Cartan Subalgebra]]), \"e\", and \"f\", which behave approximately like their namesakes in <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math>. Namely, in an irreducible representation, we have a \"highest\" eigenvector of \"h\", on which \"e\" acts by zero.

The '''adjoint bundle''' of ''P'' is the [[associated bundle]]\n:<math>\\mathrm{ad} P = P\\times^{\\mathrm{Ad}}\\mathfrak g</math>\nThe adjoint bundle is also commonly denoted by <math>\\mathfrak g_P</math>. Explicitly, elements of the adjoint bundle are [[equivalence class]]es of pairs [''p'', ''x''] for ''p'' ∈ ''P'' and ''x'' ∈ <math>\\mathfrak g</math> such that\n:<math>[p\\cdot g,x] = [p,\\mathrm{Ad}_{g^{-1}}(x)]</math>\nfor all ''g'' ∈ ''G''. Since the [[structure group]] of the adjoint bundle consists of Lie algebra [[automorphism]]s, the fibers naturally carry a Lie algebra structure making the adjoint bundle into a bundle of Lie algebras over ''M''.\n\n==Example <ref>B.S. Kiranagi,,Lie algebra bundles and Lie rings, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. India 54(a),1984,38-44.</ref>==\nLet G be any Lie group with a closed sub group H and let L be the Lie algebra of G.

H is a topological transformation group of L and obviously for every u in H, <math>d\\alpha_{u}: L \\mapsto  L</math> is a Lie algebra automorphism.\n\nsince H is a closed subgroup of a Lie group G, there is a locally trivial principal bundle over X=G/H having H as a structure group. So the existence of coordinate functions <math>g_{ij}:  U_{i}\\cap  U_{j} \\rightarrow H</math> is assured where <math>U_{i}</math> is an open covering for X. Then by the existence theorem  there exists a Lie bundle <math> \\xi= (E,P,X,L,H) </math> with the continuous mapping <math> \\Theta :\\xi \\oplus \\xi \\rightarrow \\xi </math> inducing on each fibre the Lie bracket.\n\n==Properties==\n\n[[Vector-valued differential form|Differential forms]] on ''M'' with values in <math>\\mathrm{ad} P</math> are in one-to-one correspondence with [[tensorial form|horizontal, ''G''-equivariant]] [[Lie algebra-valued form]]s on ''P''. A prime example is the [[curvature form|curvature]] of any [[connection (principal bundle)|connection]] on ''P'' which may be regarded as a 2-form on ''M'' with values in <math>\\mathrm{ad} P</math>.\n\nThe space of sections of the adjoint bundle is naturally an (infinite-dimensional) Lie algebra. It may be regarded as the Lie algebra of the infinite-dimensional Lie group of [[gauge transformation]]s of ''P'' which can be thought of as sections of the bundle ''P'' &times;<sup>Ψ</sup> ''G'' where Ψ is the action of ''G'' on itself by [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation | last1=Kobayashi|first1=Shoshichi|last2=Nomizu|first2=Katsumi | title = [[Foundations of Differential Geometry]]|volume=Vol. 1| publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]] | year=1996|edition=New|isbn=0-471-15733-3}}\n* {{citation|last1 = Kolář|first1=Ivan|last2=Michor|first2=Peter|last3=Slovák|first3=Jan|url=http://www.emis.de/monographs/KSM/kmsbookh.pdf|format=PDF|title=Natural operators in differential geometry|year = 1993|publisher = Springer-Verlag}} page 161 and page 400.\n*  B.S.

The affine Lie algebra <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}</math> is obtained by adding one extra dimension to the loop algebra and modifying a commutator in a non-trivial way, which physicists call a '''[[Anomaly (physics)|quantum anomaly]]''' (in this case, the anomaly of the [[WZW model]]) and mathematicians a '''[[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]]'''. More generally, \nif σ is an [[automorphism]] of the simple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> associated to an automorphism of its [[Dynkin diagram]], the '''twisted loop algebra''' <math>L_\\sigma\\mathfrak{g}</math> consists of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued functions ''f'' on the real line which satisfy\nthe twisted periodicity condition ''f(x+2π) = σ f(x)''. Their central extensions are precisely the '''twisted affine Lie algebras'''. The point of view of string theory helps to understand many deep properties of affine Lie algebras, such as the fact that the [[algebraic character|character]]s of their representations transform amongst themselves under the [[modular group]].\n\n== Affine Lie algebras from simple Lie algebras ==\n=== Definition ===\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a finite dimensional simple Lie algebra, the corresponding \naffine Lie algebra <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}</math> is constructed as a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]</math>, with one-dimensional center <math>\\mathbb{C}c.</math>\nAs a vector space,\n\n: <math>\\widehat{\\mathfrak{g}}=\\mathfrak{g}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]\\oplus\\mathbb{C}c,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]</math> is the complex vector space of [[Laurent series|Laurent polynomials]] in the indeterminate ''t''. The Lie bracket is defined by the formula\n\n: <math>[a\\otimes t^n+\\alpha c, b\\otimes t^m+\\beta c]=[a,b]\\otimes t^{n+m}+\\langle a|b\\rangle n\\delta_{m+n,0}c</math>\n\nfor all <math>a,b\\in\\mathfrak{g}, \\alpha,\\beta\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>  and <math>n,m\\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>, where <math>[a,b]</math> is the Lie bracket in the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and <math>\\langle\\cdot |\\cdot\\rangle</math> is the [[Killing form|Cartan-Killing form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> \n\nThe affine Lie algebra corresponding to a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra is the direct sum of the affine Lie algebras corresponding to its simple summands. There is a distinguished derivation of the affine Lie algebra defined by \n\n: <math> \\delta (a\\otimes t^m+\\alpha c) = t{d\\over dt} (a\\otimes t^m).</math>\n\nThe corresponding '''affine Kac-Moody algebra''' is defined by adding an extra generator ''d'' satisfying ''[d,A] = δ(A)'' (a [[semidirect product]]).\n\n===Constructing the Dynkin diagrams<!--linked from 'Dynkin diagram'-->===\n\nThe [[Dynkin diagram]] of each affine Lie algebra consists of that of the corresponding simple Lie algebra plus an additional node, which corresponds to the addition of an imaginary root.  Of course, such a node cannot be attached to the Dynkin diagram in just any location, but for each simple Lie algebra there exists a number of possible attachments equal to the cardinality of the group of [[Outer automorphism group|outer automorphisms]] of the Lie algebra.  In particular, this group always contains the identity element, and the corresponding affine Lie algebra is called an '''untwisted''' affine Lie algebra.  When the simple algebra admits automorphisms that are not inner automorphisms, one may obtain other Dynkin diagrams and these correspond to '''twisted''' affine Lie algebras.\n\n{| class=wikitable width=660\n|+ [[Dynkin diagram]]s for affine Lie algebras\n|- align=center\n|valign=top|[[File:Affine Dynkin diagrams.png|360px]]<BR>The set of extended (untwisted) affine Dynkin diagrams, with added nodes in green\n|[[File:Twisted affine Dynkin diagrams.png|300px]]<BR>\"Twisted\" affine forms are named with (2) or (3) superscripts.<BR>(''k'' is the number of nodes in the graph)\n|}\n\n===Classifying the central extensions===\n\nThe attachment of an extra node to the Dynkin diagram of the corresponding simple Lie algebra corresponds to the following construction.  An affine Lie algebra can always be constructed as a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]] of the loop algebra of the corresponding simple Lie algebra.  If one wishes to begin instead with a semisimple Lie algebra, then one needs to centrally extend by a number of elements equal to the number of simple components of the semisimple algebra.  In physics, one often considers instead the direct sum of a semisimple algebra and an abelian algebra <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>.  In this case one also needs to add ''n'' further central elements for the ''n'' abelian generators.\n\nThe second integral cohomology of the loop group of the corresponding simple compact Lie group is isomorphic to the integers.  Central extensions of the affine Lie group by a single generator are topologically circle bundles over this free loop group, which are classified by a two-class known as the first [[Chern class]] of the [[fibration]].  Therefore, the central extensions of an affine Lie group are classified by a single parameter ''k'' which is called the ''level'' in the physics literature, where it first appeared.  Unitary highest weight representations of the affine compact groups only exist when ''k'' is a natural number.  More generally, if one considers a semi-simple algebra, there is a central charge for each simple component.\n\n==Representation theory==\nThe [[representation theory]] for affine Lie algebras is usually developed using [[Verma module]]s.  Just as in the case of semi-simple Lie algebras, these can be gotten as the [[highest weight module]]s. There are no finite-dimensional representations; this follows from the fact that the [[null vector]]s of a finite-dimensional Verma module are necessarily zero; whereas those for the affine Lie algebras are not.  Roughly speaking, this follows because the [[Killing form]] is Lorentzian in the <math>c,\\delta</math> directions, thus <math>(z, \\bar{z})</math> are sometimes called \"lightcone coordinates\" on the string.  The \"radially ordered\" [[current algebra|current operator]] products can be understood to be time-like [[normal order]]ed by taking <math>z=\\exp(\\tau + i\\sigma)</math> with <math>\\tau</math> the time-like direction along the string [[world sheet]] and <math>\\sigma</math> the spatial direction.\n\n==Weyl group and characters==\n{{main|Weyl-Kac character formula}}\n\nThe [[Weyl group]] of an affine Lie algebra can be written as a [[semi-direct product]] of the Weyl group of the zero-mode algebra (the Lie algebra used to define the [[loop algebra]]) and the [[coroot lattice]].\n\nThe [[Weyl character formula]] of the [[algebraic character]]s of the affine Lie algebras generalizes to the [[Weyl-Kac character formula]].  A number of interesting constructions follow from these. One may construct generalizations of the [[Jacobi theta function]]. These theta functions transform under the [[modular group]]. The usual denominator identities of semi-simple Lie algebras generalize as well; because the characters can be written as \"deformations\" or [[q-analog]]s of the highest weights, this led to many new combinatoric identities, include many previously unknown identities for the [[Dedekind eta function]]. These generalizations can be viewed as a practical example of the [[Langlands program]].\n\n==Applications==\n\nThey appear naturally in [[theoretical physics]] (for example, in [[conformal field theory|conformal field theories]] such as the [[WZW model]] and [[coset model]]s and even on the worldsheet of the [[heterotic string]]), geometry, and elsewhere in mathematics.\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=P.|last= Di Francesco|first2=P. |last2=Mathieu|first3=D. |last3=Sénéchal|title=Conformal Field Theory''|publisher=Springer-Verlag| year=1997|isbn=0-387-94785-X}}\n*{{citation|first=Jurgen|last= Fuchs|title=Affine Lie Algebras and Quantum Groups|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-48412-X}}\n*{{citation|first=Peter|last=Goddard|authorlink=Peter Goddard (physicist)|first2=David|last2=Olive|title=Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras: A Reprint Volume for Physicists|series=Advanced Series in Mathematical Physics|volume=3|publisher=World Scientific|year=1988|isbn=9971-5-0419-7}} \n*{{citation|first=Victor|last= Kac|authorlink=Victor Kac|title=Infinite dimensional Lie algebras |edition=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1990|isbn=0-521-46693-8}}\n*{{citation|first=Toshitake|last= Kohno|title=Conformal Field Theory and Topology|year=1998|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=0-8218-2130-X}}\n*{{citation|first1=Andrew|last1=Pressley|first2=Graeme|last2=Segal|authorlink2=Graeme Segal|title=Loop groups|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-19-853535-X}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"

The vertical bundle is isomorphic to the trivial '''g''' bundle over ''P'', where '''g''' is the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G'', and the quotient by the diagonal ''G'' action is the [[associated bundle]] ''P'' &times;<sub>''G''</sub> '''g'''. The quotient by ''G'' of this exact sequence thus yields the Atiyah sequence of vector bundles over ''M''.\n\n==Lie groupoid viewpoint==\n\nAny principal ''G''-bundle ''P''→''M'' has a gauge groupoid, whose objects are points of ''M'', and whose morphisms are elements of the quotient of ''P''&times;''P'' by the diagonal action of ''G'', with source and target given by the two projections of ''M''. The [[Lie algebroid]] of this [[Lie groupoid]] is the Atiyah algebroid.\n\nThe space of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of the Atiyah algebroid over ''M'' is the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''-invariant vector fields on ''P'' under [[Lie bracket]], which is an extension of the Lie algebra of vector fields on ''M'' by the ''G''-invariant vertical vector fields.

      "text": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:(''B'', ''N'') pair}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''(''B'', ''N'') pair''' is a structure on [[groups of Lie type]] that allows one to give uniform proofs of many results, instead of giving a large number of case-by-case proofs. Roughly speaking, it shows that all such groups are similar to the [[general linear group]] over a field. They were introduced by the mathematician [[Jacques Tits]], and are also sometimes known as '''Tits systems'''.\n\n==Definition==\n\nA '''(''B'', ''N'') pair''' is a pair of subgroups ''B'' and ''N'' of a group ''G'' such that the following axioms hold:\n\n* ''G'' is generated by ''B'' and ''N''.\n* The intersection, ''H'', of ''B'' and ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of ''N''.\n*The group ''W'' = ''N/H'' is generated by a set ''S'' of elements ''w<sub>i</sub>'' of order 2, for ''i'' in some non-empty set ''I''. \n*If ''w<sub>i</sub>'' is an element of ''S'' and ''w'' is any element of ''W'', then ''w<sub>i</sub>Bw'' is contained in the union of ''Bw<sub>i</sub>wB'' and ''BwB''.\n*No generator ''w<sub>i</sub>'' normalizes ''B''.\n\nThe idea of this definition is that ''B'' is an analogue of the upper triangular matrices of \nthe general linear group ''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>(''K''), ''H'' is an analogue of the diagonal matrices, and ''N'' is an analogue of the [[normalizer]] of ''H''.\n\nThe subgroup ''B'' is sometimes called the '''[[Borel subgroup]]''', ''H'' is sometimes called the '''Cartan subgroup''', and ''W'' is called the '''[[Weyl group]]'''.  The pair (''W'',''S'') is a ''[[Coxeter system]]''.\n\nThe number of generators is called the '''rank'''.\n\n==Examples==\n*Suppose that ''G'' is any [[doubly transitive permutation group]] on a set ''X'' with more than 2 elements. We let ''B'' be the subgroup of ''G'' fixing a point ''x'', and we let ''N'' be the subgroup fixing or exchanging 2 points ''x'' and ''y''. The subgroup ''H'' is then the set of elements fixing both ''x'' and ''y'', and ''W'' has order 2 and its nontrivial element is represented by anything exchanging ''x'' and ''y''.\n*Conversely, if ''G'' has a (B, N) pair of rank 1, then the action of ''G'' on the cosets of ''B'' is [[doubly transitive]]. So BN pairs of rank 1 are more or less the same as doubly transitive actions on sets with more than 2 elements.\n*Suppose that ''G'' is the general linear group ''GL''<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') over a field ''K''. We take ''B'' to be the upper triangular matrices, ''H'' to be the diagonal matrices, and ''N'' to be the [[monomial matrices]], i.e.  matrices with exactly one non-zero element in each row and column. There are ''n''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1  generators ''w<sub>i</sub>'', represented by the matrices obtained by swapping two adjacent rows of a diagonal matrix.\n*More generally, any [[group of Lie type]] has the structure of a BN-pair.\n*A reductive algebraic group over a [[local field]] has a BN-pair where ''B'' is an [[Iwahori subgroup]].\n\n==Properties of groups with a BN pair==\n\nThe map taking ''w'' to ''BwB'' is an isomorphism from the set of elements of ''W'' to the set of double cosets of ''B''; this is the [[Bruhat decomposition]]&nbsp;''G''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''BWB''.\n\nIf ''T'' is a subset of ''S'' then let ''W''(''T'') be the subgroup of ''W'' generated by ''T'': we define and ''G''(''T'') = ''BW''(''T'')''B'' to be the ''standard [[parabolic subgroup]]'' for ''T''.  \nThe subgroups of ''G'' containing conjugates of ''B'' are the ''parabolic subgroups''; conjugates of ''B'' are called [[Borel subgroup]]s (or minimal parabolic subgroups).  These are precisely the standard parabolic subgroups.\n\n==Applications==\n\nBN-pairs can be used to prove that many groups of Lie type are simple modulo their centers. More precisely, if ''G'' has a ''BN''-pair such that ''B'' is a [[solvable group]], the intersection of all conjugates of ''B'' is trivial, and the set of generators of ''W'' cannot be decomposed into two non-empty commuting sets, then ''G'' is simple whenever it is a [[perfect group]]. In practice all of these conditions except for ''G'' being perfect are easy to check. Checking that ''G'' is perfect needs some slightly messy calculations (and in fact there are a few small groups of Lie type which are not perfect). But showing that a group is perfect is usually far easier than showing it is simple.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas | title=Lie Groups and Lie Algebras: Chapters 4–6 | series=Elements of Mathematics | publisher=Springer | year=2002 | isbn=3-540-42650-7 | zbl=0983.17001 }}  The standard reference for BN pairs.\n* {{cite book | title=Trees | first=Jean-Pierre | last=Serre | authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre | publisher=Springer | year=2003 | isbn=3-540-44237-5 | zbl=1013.20001 }}\n\n[[Category:Group theory|B]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras|B]]\n[[Category:Algebraic groups|B]]"

However, its symmetric part can be diagonalized, that is the 3 × 3 matrix ''C''<sup>''ab''</sup> can be reduced to the form:\n:<math>C^{ab} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & n_2 & a \\\\\n0 & -a & n_3\n\\end{bmatrix}, </math>\nwhere ''a'' is an arbitrary number. After this is done, there still remains the possibility to perform transformations with diagonal <math>A_{\\bar{b}}^{\\bar{a}}</math>, under which the quantities ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''n''<sub>3</sub> and ''a'' change as follows:\n:<math>n_2 = \\left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \\right )^{-1} \\left ( A_2^2 \\right )^2 \\acute{n}_2, \\quad n_3 = \\left ( A_1^1 A_2^2 A_3^3 \\right )^{-1} \\left ( A_3^3 \\right )^2 \\acute{n}_3, \\quad a = \\left ( A_1^1 \\right )^{-1} \\acute{a}.</math>\nThese formulas show that for nonzero ''n''<sub>2</sub>, ''n''<sub>3</sub>, ''a'', the combination ''a''<sup>2</sup>(''n''<sub>2</sub>''n''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>−1</sup> is an invariant quantity. By a choice of <math>A_1^1</math>, one can impose the condition ''a'' > 0 and after this is done, the choice of the sign of <math>A_3^3 \\left ( A_2^2 \\right )^{-1}</math> permits one to change both signs of ''n''<sub>2</sub> and ''n''<sub>3</sub> simultaneously, that is the set (''n''<sub>2</sub> , ''n''<sub>3</sub>) is equivalent to the set (−''n''<sub>2</sub>,−''n''<sub>3</sub>). It follows that there are the following four different possibilities:\n:<math>(a, n_2, n_3 ) = (a, 0, 0), (a, 0, 1), (a, 1, 1), (a, 1,-1).</math>\nFor the first two, the number ''a'' can be transformed to unity by a choice of\nthe parameters <math>A_1^1</math> and <math>A_3^3 \\left ( A_2^2 \\right )^{-1}</math>. For the second two possibilities, both of these parameters are already fixed and ''a'' remains an invariant and arbitrary positive number. Historically these four types of homogeneous spaces have been classified as:\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\nBianchi \\ V & : & n_1 = 0, \\ (a, n_2, n_3) & = & (1, 0, 0), \\\\\nBianchi \\ IV & : & n_1 = 0, \\ (a, n_2, n_3) & = & (1, 0, 1), \\\\\nBianchi \\ VII & : & n_1 = 0, \\ (a, n_2, n_3) & = & (a, 1, 1), \\\\\nBianchi \\ III & : & n_1 = 0, \\ (a, n_2, n_3) & = & (1, 1, -1), \\\\\nBianchi \\ VI & : & n_1 = 0, \\ (a, n_2, n_3) & = & (a, 1, -1).\n\\end{matrix} </math>\nType ''III'' is just a particular case of type ''VI'' corresponding to ''a'' = 1. Types ''VII'' and ''VI'' contain an infinity of invariantly different types of algebras corresponding to the arbitrariness of the continuous parameter ''a''. Type ''VII''<sub>0</sub> is a particular case of ''VII'' corresponding to ''a'' = 0 while type ''VI''<sub>0</sub> is a particular case of ''VI'' corresponding also to ''a'' = 0.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n==Curvature of Bianchi spaces==\nThe Bianchi spaces have the property that their [[Ricci tensor]]s can be [[separation of variables|separated]] into a product of the [[basis vector]]s associated with the space and a coordinate-independent tensor.\n\nFor a given [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] \n:<math>ds^2 = \\gamma_{ab} \\xi^{(a)}_i \\xi^{(b)}_k dx^i dx^k</math>\n(where <math>\\xi^{(a)}_idx^i</math>　are [[differential form|1-forms]]), the Ricci curvature tensor <math>R_{ik}</math> is given by:\n:<math>R_{ik} = R_{(a)(b)} \\xi^{(a)}_i \\xi^{(b)}_k</math>\n\n:<math>R_{(a)(b)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ C^{cd}_{\\ \\ b} \\left( C_{cda} + C_{dca} \\right) + C^c_{\\  cd} \\left( C^{\\ \\ d}_{ab} + C^{\\ \\ d}_{ba} \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} C^{\\ cd}_b C_{acd} \\right]</math>\n\nwhere the indices on the structure constants are raised and lowered with <math>\\gamma_{ab}</math> which is not a function of <math>x^i</math>.\n\n== Cosmological application ==\nIn [[cosmology]], this classification is used for a [[homogeneous space|homogeneous]] [[spacetime]] of dimension 3+1.

      "text": "{{Lie groups|Homogeneous spaces}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Borel–de Siebenthal theory''' describes the closed connected subgroups of a [[compact Lie group]] that have ''maximal rank'', i.e. contain a [[maximal torus]]. It is named after the Swiss mathematicians [[Armand Borel]] and Jean de Siebenthal who developed the theory in 1949. Each such subgroup is the [[identity component]] of the [[centralizer]] of its center. They can be described recursively in terms of the associated [[root system]] of the group. The subgroups for which the corresponding homogeneous space has an invariant complex structure correspond to [[parabolic subgroup]]s in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of the compact Lie group, a [[reductive algebraic group]].\n\n==Connected subgroups of maximal rank==\nLet ''G'' be connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. [[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]] showed that the centralizer of a torus ''S'' ⊆ ''T'' is a connected closed subgroup containing ''T'', so of  ''maximal rank''. Indeed, if ''x'' is in C<sub>''G''</sub>(''S''), there is a maximal torus containing both ''S'' and ''x'' and it is contained in C<sub>''G''</sub>(''S'').<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref>\n\nBorel and de Siebenthal proved that the connected closed subgroups of maximal rank are precisely the [[identity component]]s of the centralizers of their centers.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nTheir result  relies on a fact from representation theory. The weights of an irreducible representation of a connected compact semisimple group ''K'' with highest weight λ can be easily described (without their multiplicities): they are precisely the saturation under the [[Weyl group]] of the [[dominant weight]]s obtained by subtracting off a sum of simple roots from λ. In particular, if the [[irreducible representation]] is trivial on the center of ''K'' (a finite abelian group), 0 is a weight.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981}}\n*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}\n*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}\n</ref>\n\nTo prove the characterization of Borel and de Siebenthal, let ''H'' be a closed connected subgroup of ''G'' containing ''T'' with center ''Z''. The identity component ''L'' of C<sub>''G''</sub>(Z) contains ''H''. If it were strictly larger, the restriction of the adjoint representation of ''L'' to ''H'' would be trivial on ''Z''. Any irreducible summand, orthogonal to the Lie algebra of ''H'', would provide non-zero weight zero vectors for ''T'' / ''Z'' ⊆ ''H'' / ''Z'', contradicting the maximality of the torus ''T'' / ''Z'' in ''L'' / ''Z''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank==\nBorel and de Siebenthal classified the maximal closed connected subgroups of maximal rank of a connected compact Lie group.\n\nThe general classification of connected closed subgroups of maximal rank can be reduced to this case, because any connected subgroup of maximal rank is contained in a finite chain of such subgroups, each maximal in the next one. Maximal subgroups are the identity components of any element of their center not belonging to the center of the whole group.\n\nThe problem of determining the maximal connected subgroups of maximal rank can be further reduced to the case where the compact Lie group is simple. In fact the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> of a connected compact Lie group ''G'' splits as a direct sum of the ideals\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{z} \\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_1\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathfrak{g}_m,}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{z}</math> is the center and the other factors <math>\\mathfrak{g}_i</math> are simple. If ''T'' is a maximal torus, its Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> has a corresponding splitting\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{t}=\\mathfrak{z} \\oplus \\mathfrak{t}_1\\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathfrak{t}_m,}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{t}_i</math> is maximal abelian in <math>\\mathfrak{g}_i</math>. If ''H'' is a closed connected of ''G'' containing ''T'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, the complexification of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is the direct sum of the complexification of <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> and a number of one-dimensional weight spaces, each of which lies in the complexification of a factor <math>\\mathfrak{g}_i</math>. Thus if\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}_i=\\mathfrak{h}\\cap\\mathfrak{g}_i,} </math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{h}=\\mathfrak{z} \\oplus \\mathfrak{h}_1\\oplus\\cdots \\oplus \\mathfrak{h}_m.}</math>\n\nIf ''H'' is maximal, all but one of the <math>\\mathfrak{h}_i</math>'s coincide with <math>\\mathfrak{g}_i</math> and the remaining one is maximal and of maximal rank. For that factor, the closed connected subgroup of the corresponding simply connected simple compact Lie group is maximal and of maximal rank.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|p=276}}</ref>\n\nLet ''G'' be a connected simply connected compact simple Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. Let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be the Lie algebra of ''G'' and <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> that of ''T''. Let Δ be the corresponding [[root system]]. Choose a set of positive roots and corresponding simple roots α<sub>1</sub>, ..., α<sub>''n''</sub>.

(The number of ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> equal to 1 is equal to |''Z''| – 1, where ''Z'' is the center of ''G''.)\n\nThe ''Weyl alcove'' is defined by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{A=\\{T\\in\\mathfrak{t}:\\, \\alpha_1(T)\\ge 0, \\dots,\\alpha_n(T)\\ge 0, \\alpha_0(T)\\le 1\\}.}</math>\n\n[[Élie Cartan]] showed that it is a [[fundamental domain]] for the [[affine Weyl group]]. If ''G''<sub>1</sub> = ''G'' / ''Z'' and ''T''<sub>1</sub> = ''T'' / ''Z'', it follows that the exponential mapping from <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to ''G''<sub>1</sub> carries 2π''A'' onto ''T''<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe Weyl alcove ''A'' is a [[simplex]] with vertices at\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{v_0=0,\\,\\, v_i=m_i^{-1} X_i,}</math>\n\nwhere α<sub>''i''</sub>(''X''<sub>''j''</sub>) = δ<sub>''ij''</sub>.\n\nThe main result of Borel and de Siebenthal is as follows.\n\n{{quote box|align=left|quote='''THEOREM.'''

It is semisimple in the second case with a system of simple roots obtained by replacing α<sub>''i''</sub> by −α<sub>0</sub>. In the first case it is the direct product of the circle group generated by ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> and a semisimple compact group with a system of simple roots obtained by omitting α<sub>''i''</sub>.\n\nThis result can be rephrased in terms of the [[Affine Dynkin diagram|extended Dynkin diagram]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> which adds an extra node for the highest root as well as the labels ''m''<sub>''i''</sub>. The maximal subalgebras <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> of maximal rank are either non-semisimple or semimsimple. The non-semisimple ones are obtained by deleting two nodes from the extended diagram with coefficient one. The corresponding unlabelled diagram gives the Dynkin diagram semisimple part of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, the other part being a one-dimensional factor.  The Dynkin diagrams for the semisimple ones are obtained by removing one node with coefficient a prime. This leads to the following possibilities:\n\n* A<sub>''n''</sub>: A<sub>''p''</sub> × A <sub>''n'' − ''p'' − 1</sub> × '''T''' (non-semisimple)\n* B<sub>''n''</sub>: D<sub>''n''</sub> or B<sub>''p''</sub> × D<sub>''n'' − ''p''</sub> (semisimple), B<sub>''n'' − 1</sub> × '''T''' (non-semisimple)\n* C<sub>''n''</sub>: C<sub>''p''</sub> × C<sub>''n'' − ''p''</sub> (SS), A<sub>''n'' - 1</sub> × '''T''' (NSS)\n* D<sub>''n''</sub>: D<sub>''p''</sub> × D<sub>''n'' - ''p''</sub> (SS), D<sub>''n'' - 1</sub> × '''T''', A<sub>n-1</sub> × '''T''' (NSS)\n* E<sub>6</sub>: A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>5</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>2</sub> (SS), D<sub>5</sub> × '''T''' (NSS)\n* E<sub>7</sub>: A<sub>1</sub> × D<sub>6</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>5</sub>, A<sub>7</sub> (SS), E<sub>6</sub> × '''T''' (NSS)\n* E<sub>8</sub>: D<sub>8</sub>, A<sub>8</sub>, A<sub>4</sub> × A<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>6</sub> × A<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>7</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> (SS)\n* F<sub>4</sub>: B<sub>4</sub>, A<sub>2</sub> × A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> × C<sub>3</sub> (SS)\n* G<sub>2</sub>: A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> × A<sub>1</sub> (SS)\n\nAll the corresponding homogeneous spaces are symmetric, since the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 2, apart from G<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>2</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>/A<sub>2</sub>×A<sub>5</sub> and all the E<sub>8</sub> spaces other than E<sub>8</sub>/D<sub>8</sub> and E<sub>8</sub>/E<sub>7</sub>×A<sub>1</sub>. In all these exceptional cases the subalgebra is the fixed point algebra of an inner automorphism of period 3, except for E<sub>8</sub>/A<sub>4</sub>×A<sub>4</sub> where the automorphism has period 5. The homogeneous spaces are then called [[weakly symmetric spaces]].\n\nTo prove the theorem, note that ''H''<sub>1</sub> is the identity component of the centralizer of an element exp ''T'' with ''T'' in 2π ''A''. Stabilizers increase in moving from a subsimplex to an edge or vertex, so ''T'' either lies on an edge or is a vertex. If it lies on an edge than that edge connects 0 to a vertex ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1, which is the first case. If ''T'' is a vertex ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> has a non-trivial factor ''m'', then ''mT'' has a larger stabilizer than ''T'', contradicting maximality. So ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> must be prime. Maximality can be checked directly using the fact that an intermediate subgroup  ''K'' would have the same form, so that its center would be either (a) '''T''' or (b) an element of prime order. If the center of ''H''<sub>1</sub> is ''''T''', each simple root with ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> prime is already a root of ''K'', so (b) is not possible; and if (a) holds, α<sub>''i''</sub> is the only root that could be omitted with ''m''<sub>''j''</sub> = 1, so ''K'' = ''H''<sub>1</sub>. If the center of ''H''<sub>1</sub> is of prime order, α<sub>''j''</sub> is a root of ''K'' for ''m''<sub>''j''</sub> = 1, so that (a) is not possible; if (b) holds, then the only possible omitted simple root is α<sub>''i''</sub>, so that ''K'' = ''H''<sub>1</sub>.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}\n*{{harvnb|Kane|2001}}</ref>\n\n==Closed subsystems of roots==\nA subset Δ<sub>1</sub> ⊂ Δ is called a '''closed subsystem''' if whenever α and β lie in Δ<sub>1</sub> with α + β in Δ, then  α + β lies in Δ<sub>1</sub>. Two subsystems Δ<sub>1</sub> and Δ<sub>2</sub> are said to be ''equivalent'' if σ( Δ<sub>1</sub>) = Δ<sub>2</sub> for some σ in ''W'' = ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''T'') / ''T'', the [[Weyl group]].

Let ''K'' be a closed subgroup of ''G'' lying between ''G''<sup>σ</sup> and its [[identity component]]. The compact homogeneous space ''G'' / ''K'' is called a [[symmetric space|symmetric space of compact type]]. The Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> admits a decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k}\\oplus\\mathfrak{p},}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the Lie algebra of ''K'', is the +1 eigenspace of σ and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> the –1 eigenspace.\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> contains no simple summand of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the pair (<math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, σ) is called an [[orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra]] of ''compact type''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nAny inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, invariant under the [[adjoint representation]] and σ, induces a Riemannian structure on ''G'' / ''K'', with ''G'' acting by isometries.

There are two possibilities: either the automorphism σ is inner, in which case ''K'' has maximal rank and the theory of Borel and de Siebenthal applies; or the automorphism σ is outer, so that, because σ preserves a maximal torus, the rank of ''K'' is less than the rank of ''G'' and σ corresponds to an automorphism of the Dynkin diagram modulo inner automorphisms. {{harvtxt|Wolf|2010}} determines directly all possible σ in the latter case: they correspond to the symmetric spaces\nSU(''n'')/SO(''n''), SO(''a''+''b'')/SO(''a'')×SO(''b'') (''a'' and ''b'' odd), E<sub>6</sub>/F<sub>4</sub> and E<sub>6</sub>/C<sub>4</sub>.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Victor Kac]] noticed that all finite order automorphisms of a simple Lie algebra can be determined using the corresponding [[affine Lie algebra]]: that classification, which leads to an alternative method of classifying pairs (<math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, σ), is described in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1978}}.\n\n==Applications to hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type==\nThe equal rank case with ''K'' non-semisimple corresponds exactly to the [[Hermitian symmetric space]]s ''G'' / ''K'' of compact type.\n\nIn fact the symmetric space has an [[almost complex structure]] preserving the Riemannian metric if and only if there is a linear map ''J'' with ''J''<sup>2</sup> = −''I'' on <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> which preserves the inner product and commutes with the action of ''K''. In this case ''J'' lies in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and exp ''Jt'' forms a one-parameter group in the center of ''K''.  This follows because if ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' lie in  <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>, then by the invariance of the inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math><ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=149–150}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{([[A,B],C],D)=([A,B],[C,D])=([[C,D],B],A).}</math>\n\nReplacing ''A'' and ''B'' by ''JA'' and ''JB'', it follows that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[JA,JB] = [A,B].}</math>\n\nDefine a linear map δ on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> by extending ''J'' to be 0 on  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. The last relation shows that δ is a derivation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is semisimple, δ must be an inner derivation, so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\delta(X)=[T + A,X],}</math>\n\nwith ''T'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and ''A'' in <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Taking ''X'' in  <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that ''A'' = 0 and ''T'' lies in the center of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and hence that ''K'' is non-semisimple.\n<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|1996|pp=261–262}}</ref>\n\nIf on the other hand ''G'' / ''K'' is irreducible with ''K'' non-semisimple, the compact group ''G'' must be simple and ''K'' of maximal rank. From the theorem of Borel and de Siebenthal, the involution σ is inner and ''K'' is the centralizer of a torus ''S''. It follows that ''G'' / ''K'' is simply connected and there is a [[parabolic subgroup]] ''P'' in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> of ''G'' such that ''G'' / ''K'' = ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> / ''P''. In particular there is a complex structure on ''G'' / ''K'' and the action of ''G'' is holomorphic.\n\nIn general any compact hermitian symmetric space is simply connected and can be written as a direct product of irreducible hermitian symmetric spaces ''G''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''K''<sub>''i''</sub> with ''G''<sub>''i''</sub> simple. The irreducible ones are exactly the non-semisimple cases described above.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|3}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|journal=Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici|year=1949|volume=23|pages=200–221|first=A.|last= Borel|first2=J.|last2= De Siebenthal|url=https://eudml.org/doc/138983|title=Les sous-groupes fermés de rang maximum des groupes de Lie clos}}\n*{{citation|last=Borel|first=Armand|title=Les espaces hermitiens symétriques, Exposé No. 62|series=Séminaire Bourbaki|volume=2|url=http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=SB_1951-1954__2__121_0|year=1952|access-date=2013-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003445/http://www.numdam.org/numdam-bin/fitem?id=SB_1951-1954__2__121_0|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes}}\n*{{citation|first=N.|last=Bourbaki|series=Éléments de Mathématique|title=Groupes et Algèbres de Lie (Chapitres 4,5 et 6)|publisher=Masson|year=1981|isbn=978-3-540-34490-2}}\n*{{citation|first=N.|last=Bourbaki|series=Éléments de Mathématique|title=Groupes et Algèbres de Lie (Chapitre 9)|publisher=Masson|year=1982|isbn=978-3-540-34392-9}}\n*{{citation|title=Lie groups|publisher=Springer|year=2000 |isbn=978-3-540-15293-4 |first=J.J.|last=Duistermaat|first2=A.|last2=Kolk|series=Universitext}}\n*{{citation|first=Sigurdur|last= Helgason|title=Differential geometry, Lie groups, and symmetric spaces|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-8218-2848-9}}\n*{{citation|first=James E.|last= Humphreys|title=Linear Algebraic Groups|publisher=Springer|year=1981|isbn=978-0-387-90108-4|series=Graduate texts in mathematics|volume=21}}\n*{{citation|first=James E.|last= Humphreys|title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory|publisher=Springer|edition=2nd|\nyear=1997|series=Graduate texts in mathematics|volume=9|isbn=978-3-540-90053-5}}\n*{{citation|title=Reflection Groups and Invariant Theory|first=Richard|last= Kane|publisher=Springer|year= 2001|isbn=978-0-387-98979-2}}\n*{{citation|last=Kobayashi|first=Shoshichi|last2=Nomizu|first2=Katsumi|title=Foundations of differential geometry|volume=2|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=1996|isbn=978-0-471-15732-8}}\n*{{citation|title=Linear Algebraic Groups and Finite Groups of Lie Type|volume=133|series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics|\nfirst=Gunter|last=Malle|first2=Donna|last2=Testerman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 2011|isbn=978-1-139-49953-8}}\n*{{citation|last=Wolf|first=Joseph A.|title=Spaces of constant curvature|publisher= American Mathematical Society|edition= 6th|year=2010|series= AMS Chelsea Publishing|isbn=978-0-8218-5282-8}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Borel-de Siebenthal theory}}\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Algebraic groups]]\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Capelli's identity''', named after {{harvs|first=Alfredo|last=Capelli|authorlink=Alfredo Capelli|year=1887|txt}}, is an analogue of the formula det(''AB'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;det(''A'')&nbsp;det(''B''), for certain matrices with noncommuting entries, related to the [[Lie algebra representation|representation theory of the Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math>. It can be used to relate an invariant ''ƒ'' to the invariant Ω''ƒ'', where Ω is [[Cayley's Ω process]].\n\n==Statement==\nSuppose that ''x''<sub>''ij''</sub> for  ''i'',''j'' = 1,...,''n'' are commuting variables. Write  ''E''<sub>ij</sub> for the polarization operator \n:<math>E_{ij} = \\sum_{a=1}^n x_{ia}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{ja}}.</math>\n\nThe  Capelli identity states that the following differential operators, expressed as determinants, are equal:\n:<math>\n\\begin{vmatrix}  E_{11}+n-1 & \\cdots &E_{1,n-1}& E_{1n} \\\\ \\vdots& \\ddots & \\vdots&\\vdots\\\\  E_{n-1,1} & \\cdots & E_{n-1,n-1}+1&E_{n-1,n} \\\\  E_{n1} & \\cdots & E_{n,n-1}& E_{nn} +0\\end{vmatrix} =\n\\begin{vmatrix}  x_{11} & \\cdots & x_{1n} \\\\ \\vdots& \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\  x_{n1} & \\cdots & x_{nn} \\end{vmatrix}\n\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{11}} & \\cdots &\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{1n}} \\\\ \\vdots& \\ddots & \\vdots\\\\ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{n1}} & \\cdots &\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{nn}}  \\end{vmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nBoth sides are differential operators. The determinant on the left has non-commuting entries, and is expanded with all terms preserving their \"left to right\" order. Such a determinant is often called a ''column-determinant'', since it can be obtained by the column expansion of the determinant starting from the first column. It can be formally written as\n\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} \\sgn(\\sigma)  A_{\\sigma(1),1}A_{\\sigma(2),2}\\cdots A_{\\sigma(n),n},</math>\n\nwhere in the product first come the elements from the first column, then from the second and so on.  The determinant on the far right is [[Cayley's omega process]], and the one on the left is the Capelli determinant.\n\nThe operators ''E''<sub>ij</sub> can be written in a matrix form:\n\n:<math>E = X D^t,</math>\n\nwhere <math>E, X, D</math> are matrices with elements ''E''<sub>ij</sub>, ''x''<sub>ij</sub>, <math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{ij}}</math> respectively. If all elements in these matrices would be commutative then  clearly <math>\\det(E) = \\det(X) \\det(D^t)</math>. The Capelli identity shows that despite noncommutativity there exists a \"quantization\" of the formula above. The only price for the noncommutativity is a small correction: <math>(n-i)\\delta_{ij}</math> on the left hand side. For generic noncommutative matrices formulas like\n\n:<math>\\det(AB)=\\det(A)\\det(B)</math>\ndo not exist, and the notion of the 'determinant' itself does not make sense for generic noncommutative matrices. That is why the Capelli identity still holds some mystery, despite many proofs offered for it. A very short proof does not seem to exist. Direct verification of the statement can be given as an exercise for ''n'' = 2, but is already long for ''n'' = 3.\n\n==Relations with representation theory==\n\nConsider the following slightly more general context. Suppose that <math>n</math> and <math>m</math> are two integers and <math>x_{ij}</math> for  <math>i = 1, \\dots, n, \\ j = 1, \\dots, m</math>, be commuting variables. Redefine  <math>E_{ij}</math> by almost the same formula:\n\n:<math>E_{ij} = \\sum_{a=1}^m x_{ia}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{ja}}.</math>\n\nwith the only difference that summation index <math>a</math> ranges from <math>1</math> to <math>m</math>. One can easily see that such operators satisfy the commutation relations:\n\n:<math>[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \\delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \\delta_{il}E_{kj}.~~~~~~~~~</math>\n\nHere  <math>[a,b]</math> denotes the [[commutator]] <math>ab-ba</math>. These are the same commutation relations which are satisfied by the matrices <math>e_{ij}</math> which have zeros everywhere except the position <math>(i,j)</math>, where 1 stands. (<math>e_{ij}</math> are sometimes called ''matrix units''). Hence we conclude that the correspondence <math>\\pi : e_{ij} \\mapsto E_{ij} </math> defines a [[Lie algebra representation|representation of the Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math> in the vector space of polynomials of <math>x_{ij}</math>.\n\n===Case ''m'' = 1 and representation ''S''<sup>''k''</sup> C<sup>''n''</sup> ===\n\nIt is especially instructive to consider the special case ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1; in this case we have ''x''<sub>''i1''</sub>, which is abbreviated as ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>:\n\n:<math>E_{ij} =  x_i \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j}.</math>\n\nIn particular, for the polynomials of the first degree it is seen that:\n\n:<math>E_{ij} x_k =  \\delta_{jk} x_i. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</math>\n\nHence the action of <math>E_{ij}</math> restricted to the space of first-order polynomials is exactly the same as the action of ''matrix units''  <math>e_{ij}</math> on vectors in <math>\\mathbb{C}^{n}</math>. So, from the representation theory point of view, the subspace of polynomials of first degree is a [[Representation theory|subrepresentation]] of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math>, which we identified with the standard representation in <math>\\mathbb{C}^{n}</math>. Going further, it is seen that the differential operators <math>E_{ij} </math> preserve the degree of the polynomials, and hence the polynomials of each fixed degree form a  [[Representation theory|subrepresentation]] of the Lie algebra  <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math>. One can see further that the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree ''k'' can be identified with the symmetric tensor power <math>S^k \\mathbb{C}^n</math> of the standard representation <math>\\mathbb C^n</math>.\n\nOne can also easily identify the [[highest weight]] structure of these representations. The monomial <math>x^k_1</math> is a [[highest weight vector]], indeed: <math>E_{ij} x^k_1=0</math> for ''i''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''j''. Its highest weight equals to (''k'',&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...&nbsp;,0), indeed: <math>E_{ii} x^k_1= k \\delta_{i1}x^k_1</math>.\n\nSuch representation is sometimes called bosonic representation of <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math>. Similar formulas <math>E_{ij} =  \\psi_{i}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\psi_{j}} </math> define the so-called fermionic representation, here <math>\\psi_{i}</math> are anti-commuting variables. Again polynomials of ''k''-th degree form an irreducible subrepresentation which is isomorphic to <math>\\Lambda^k \\mathbb{C}^{n}</math> i.e. anti-symmetric tensor power of <math> \\mathbb{C}^{n}</math>. Highest weight of such representation is (0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;0). These representations for ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n'' are [[fundamental representation]]s of <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math>.\n\n==== Capelli identity for ''m'' = 1 ====\n\nLet us return to the Capelli identity. One can prove the following:\n\n:<math>\\det(E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) = 0, \\qquad  n>1  </math>\n\nthe motivation for this equality is the following: consider <math> E^c_{ij} =  x_i p_j</math> for some commuting variables <math>x_i, p_j</math>. The matrix <math> E^{c} </math> is of rank one and hence its determinant is equal to zero. Elements of matrix <math> E </math> are defined by the similar formulas, however, its elements do not  commute. The Capelli identity shows that the commutative identity: <math> \\det(E^{c})=0 </math> can be preserved for the small price of correcting matrix <math> E </math> by <math> (n-i)\\delta_{ij} </math>.\n\nLet us also mention that similar identity can be given for the characteristic polynomial:\n\n:<math>\\det(t+E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) =  t^{[n]}+ \\mathrm{Tr}(E)t^{[n-1]}, ~~~~  </math>\n\nwhere <math>t^{[k]}=t(t+1) \\cdots (t+k-1)</math>.  The commutative counterpart of this is a simple fact that for rank&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 matrices the characteristic polynomial contains only the first and the second coefficients.\n\nConsider an example for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.\n\n:<math> \\begin{align}\n& \\begin{vmatrix} t+ E_{11}+1 & E_{12} \\\\\nE_{21}  & t+ E_{22} \n\\end{vmatrix}\n=\\begin{vmatrix} t+ x_1 \\partial_1+1 & x_1 \\partial_2 \\\\\nx_2 \\partial_1  & t+ x_2 \\partial_2\n\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[8pt]\n& = (t+ x_1 \\partial_1+1 ) ( t+ x_2 \\partial_2)- x_2 \\partial_1 x_1 \\partial_2 \\\\[6pt]\n& = t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \\partial_1 + x_2 \\partial_2) \n+x_1 \\partial_1 x_2 \\partial_2+x_2 \\partial_2 -\n x_2 \\partial_1 x_1 \\partial_2\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nUsing\n\n: <math>\\partial_1 x_1= x_1\\partial_1+1,\\partial_1 x_2= x_2\\partial_1, x_1x_2=x_2x_1 </math>\n\nwe see that this is equal to:\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& {} \\quad t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \\partial_1 + x_2 \\partial_2) \n+x_2 x_1 \\partial_1  \\partial_2+x_2 \\partial_2 -\n x_2  x_1 \\partial_1 \\partial_2 - x_2   \\partial_2 \\\\[8pt]\n& = t(t+1)+ t( x_1 \\partial_1 + x_2 \\partial_2)=t^{[2]}+ t\\,\\mathrm{Tr}(E).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== The universal enveloping algebra  <math>U(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)</math>  and its center  ===\nAn interesting property of the Capelli determinant is that it commutes with all operators ''E<sub>ij</sub>'', that is, the [[commutator]] <math>[ E_{ij}, \\det(E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij})]=0</math> is equal to zero. It can be generalized:\n\nConsider any elements ''E<sub>ij</sub>'' in any ring, such that they satisfy the commutation relation <math>[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \\delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \\delta_{il}E_{kj}</math>, (so they can be differential operators above, matrix units ''e<sub>ij</sub>'' or any other elements) define elements ''C<sub>k</sub>'' as follows:\n\n:<math>\\det(t+E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) =  \nt^{[n]}+\\sum_{k=n-1,\\dots,0} t^{[k]} C_k, ~~~~~ </math>\n\nwhere <math>t^{[k]}=t(t+1)\\cdots(t+k-1),</math>\n\nthen:\n\n* elements ''C<sub>k</sub>'' commute with all elements ''E<sub>ij</sub>''\n* elements ''C<sub>k</sub>'' can be given by the formulas similar to the commutative case:\n:<math>C_k=\\sum_{I=(i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_k)} \\det(E+(k-i)\\delta_{ij})_{II},</math>\n\ni.e. they are sums of principal  minors of the matrix ''E'', modulo the ''Capelli correction''  <math>+(k-i)\\delta_{ij}</math>. In particular element ''C<sub>0</sub>'' is the Capelli determinant considered above.\n\nThese statements are interrelated with the Capelli identity, as will be discussed below,  and similarly to it the  direct few lines short proof does not seem to exist, despite the simplicity of the formulation.\n\nThe [[universal enveloping algebra]]\n\n:<math>U(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)</math>\n\ncan defined as an algebra generated by\n\n:''E<sub>ij</sub>''\n\nsubject to the relations\n\n:<math>[ E_{ij}, E_{kl}] = \\delta_{jk}E_{il}-  \\delta_{il}E_{kj}</math>\n\nalone. The proposition above  shows that elements ''C<sub>k</sub>''belong to the  [[Center (algebra)|center]] of <math>U(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)</math>. It can be shown that they actually are free generators of the center of <math>U(\\mathfrak{gl}_n)</math>. They are sometimes called ''Capelli generators''. The Capelli identities for them will be discussed below.\n\nConsider an example for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n{}\\quad \\begin{vmatrix} t+ E_{11}+1 & E_{12} \\\\\nE_{21}  & t+ E_{22} \n\\end{vmatrix}\n& = (t+ E_{11}+1)(t+ E_{22})-E_{21}E_{12} \\\\\n& = t(t+1)+t(E_{11}+E_{22})+E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}+E_{22}. \n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nIt is  immediate to check that element  <math>(E_{11}+E_{22})</math> commute with <math>E_{ij}</math>. (It corresponds to an obvious fact that the identity matrix commute with all other matrices). More instructive is  to check commutativity of the second element  with  <math>E_{ij}</math>. Let us do it for <math>E_{12}</math>:\n\n:<math>\n[E_{12}, E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}+E_{22}]\n</math>\n\n:<math>\n=[E_{12}, E_{11}] E_{22} + E_{11} [E_{12}, E_{22}] -\n[E_{12}, E_{21}] E_{12} - E_{21}[E_{12},E_{12}] +[E_{12},E_{22}]\n </math>\n\n:<math>\n=-E_{12} E_{22} + E_{11} E_{12} -\n(E_{11}- E_{22}) E_{12} - 0 +E_{12}\n </math>\n\n:<math>\n=-E_{12} E_{22} + E_{22} E_{12}  +E_{12}= -E_{12} + E_{12}=0.\n </math>\n\nWe see that the naive determinant <math> E_{11}E_{22}-E_{21}E_{12}</math> will not commute with <math>E_{12} </math> and the Capelli's correction <math> +E_{22}</math> is essential to ensure the centrality.\n\n===General ''m'' and  dual pairs ===\n\nLet us return to the general case:\n\n:<math>E_{ij} = \\sum_{a=1}^m x_{ia}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{ja}},</math>\nfor arbitrary ''n'' and ''m''. Definition of operators ''E''<sub>ij</sub> can be written in a matrix form: <math>E = X D^t</math>, where  <math>E</math> is <math>n \\times n </math> matrix  with elements  <math>E_{ij}</math>;  <math>X</math> is <math>n \\times m </math> matrix  with elements  <math>x_{ij}</math>;  <math>D</math> is <math>n \\times m </math> matrix  with elements  <math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{ij}}</math>.\n\n'''Capelli–Cauchy–Binet identities'''\n\nFor general ''m'' matrix ''E'' is given as product of the two rectangular matrices: ''X'' and transpose to ''D''. If all elements of these matrices would commute then one knows that the determinant of ''E'' can be expressed by the so-called [[Cauchy–Binet formula]] via [[major and minor|minor]]s of ''X'' and ''D''. An analogue of this formula also exists for matrix ''E'' again for the same mild price of the correction <math> E \\rightarrow (E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) </math>:\n\n:<math>\\det(E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) = \\sum_{I=(1\\le i_1<i_2<\\cdots <i_n \\le m)} \\det(X_{I}) \\det(D^t_{I})</math>,\n\nIn particular (similar to the commutative case): if ''m<n'', then <math>\\det(E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) =0 </math>; if ''m=n'' we return to the identity above.\n\nLet us also mention that similar to the commutative case (see [[Minor (linear algebra)#Applications|Cauchy–Binet for minors]]), one can express not only the determinant of ''E'', but also its minors via minors of ''X'' and ''D'':\n\n:<math>\\det(E+(s-i)\\delta_{ij})_{KL} = \\sum_{I=(1\\le i_1<i_2< \\cdots <i_s \\le m)} \\det(X_{KI}) \\det(D^t_{IL})</math>,\n\nHere ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''k''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;...&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''<sub>''s''</sub>), ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''l''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;''l''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;...&nbsp;<&nbsp;''l''<sub>''s''</sub>), are arbitrary multi-indexes; as usually  <math>M_{KL} </math> denotes a submatrix of ''M'' formed by the elements ''M<sub> k<sub>a</sub>l<sub>b</sub></sub>''. Pay attention that the Capelli correction now contains ''s'', not ''n'' as in previous formula.  Note that for ''s=1'', the correction (''s''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''i'') disappears and we get just the definition of ''E'' as a product of ''X'' and transpose to ''D''. Let us also mention that for generic ''K,L'' corresponding minors do not commute with all elements ''E<sub>ij</sub>'', so the Capelli identity exists not only for central elements.\n\nAs a corollary of this formula and the one for the characteristic polynomial in the previous section let us mention the following:\n\n:<math>\\det(t+E+(n-i)\\delta_{ij}) = t^{[n]}+\\sum_{k=n-1,\\dots,0}t^{[k]} \\sum_{I,J}  \\det(X_{IJ}) \\det(D^t_{JI}),</math>\n\nwhere <math> I=(1\\le i_1<\\cdots <i_k \\le n),</math> <math> J=(1\\le j_1< \\cdots <j_k \\le n) </math>. This formula is similar to the commutative case, modula <math>+(n-i)\\delta_{ij} </math> at the left hand side and ''t<sup>[n]</sup>'' instead of ''t<sup>n</sup>'' at the right hand side.\n\n'''Relation to dual pairs'''\n\nModern interest in these identities has been much stimulated by  [[Roger Evans Howe|Roger Howe]] who considered them in his theory of [[Howe duality|reductive dual pairs]] (also known as Howe duality). To make the first contact with these ideas, let us look more precisely on operators  <math>E_{ij} </math>.  Such operators preserve the degree of polynomials. Let us look at the polynomials of degree 1: <math>E_{ij} x_{kl} = x_{il} \\delta_{jk} </math>, we see that index ''l'' is preserved. One can see that from the representation theory point of view  polynomials of the first degree can be identified with direct sum of the representations <math>\\mathbb{C}^n \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbb{C}^n </math>, here  ''l''-th subspace (''l=1...m'') is spanned by <math> x_{il} </math>, ''i''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''n''.  Let us give another look on this vector space:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{C}^n \\oplus \\cdots \\oplus \\mathbb{C}^n = \\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^m  .</math>\n\nSuch point of view gives the first hint  of symmetry between ''m'' and ''n''. To deepen this idea consider:\n\n:<math>E_{ij}^\\text{dual} = \\sum_{a=1}^n x_{ai}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_{aj}}.</math>\n\nThese operators  are given by the same formulas as  <math>E_{ij}</math> modula renumeration <math>i \\leftrightarrow j</math>, hence by the same arguments we can deduce that <math>E_{ij}^\\text{dual} </math> form a [[Lie algebra representation|representation of the Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_m</math> in the vector space of polynomials of ''x''<sub>''ij''</sub>. Before going further we can mention the following property: differential operators <math>E_{ij}^\\text{dual} </math> commute with differential operators <math>E_{kl} </math>.\n\nThe Lie group  <math>GL_n \\times  GL_m </math> acts on the vector space <math> \\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^m  </math> in a natural way. One can show that the corresponding action of Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n \\times \\mathfrak{gl}_m</math> is given by the differential operators <math>E_{ij}~~~~</math> and  <math> E_{ij}^\\text{dual} </math> respectively. This explains the commutativity of these operators.\n\nThe following deeper properties actually hold true:\n\n* The only differential operators  which commute with <math>E_{ij}~~~~</math> are polynomials in <math> E_{ij}^\\text{dual} </math>, and vice versa.\n* Decomposition of the vector space of polynomials into a direct sum of tensor products of irreducible representations of <math>GL_n </math> and <math>  GL_m </math> can be given as follows:\n\n: <math>\\mathbb{C} [x_{ij}] = S(\\mathbb{C}^n \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^m) = \\sum_D \\rho_n^D \\otimes\\rho_m^{D'}. </math>\n\nThe summands are indexed by the [[Young diagram]]s ''D'', and representations <math>\\rho^D</math> are mutually non-isomorphic. And diagram <math>{D} </math> determine <math> {D'} </math> and vice versa.\n\n* In particular the representation of the big group  <math> GL_n \\times  GL_m </math>  is multiplicity free, that is each irreducible representation occurs only one time.\n\nOne easily observe the strong similarity to [[Schur–Weyl duality]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nMuch work have been done on the identity and its generalizations.

Since <math>\\theta^2=1</math>, the linear map <math>\\theta</math> has the two eigenvalues <math>\\pm1</math>.  Let <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> be the corresponding eigenspaces, then <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k}+\\mathfrak{p}</math>.  Since <math>\\theta</math> is a Lie algebra automorphism, eigenvalues are multiplicative. It follows that\n\n: <math>[\\mathfrak{k}, \\mathfrak{k}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{k}</math>, <math>[\\mathfrak{k}, \\mathfrak{p}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{p}</math>, and <math>[\\mathfrak{p}, \\mathfrak{p}] \\subseteq \\mathfrak{k}</math>.\n\nThus <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> is a Lie subalgebra, while any subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is commutative.\n\nConversely, a decomposition <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k}+\\mathfrak{p}</math> with these extra properties determines an involution <math>\\theta</math> on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> that is <math>+1</math> on <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>-1</math> on <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>.\n\nSuch a pair <math>(\\mathfrak{k}, \\mathfrak{p})</math> is also called a ''Cartan pair'' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, \nand <math>(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{k})</math> is called a ''symmetric pair''. This notion of a Cartan pair here is not to be confused with the [[Cartan pair|distinct notion]] involving the relative Lie algebra cohomology <math>H^*(\\mathfrak{g},\\mathfrak{k})</math>.\n\nThe decomposition <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k}+\\mathfrak{p}</math> associated to a Cartan involution is called a ''Cartan decomposition'' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.  The special feature of a Cartan decomposition is that the Killing form is negative definite on <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and positive definite on <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>.  Furthermore, <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> are orthogonal complements of each other with respect to the Killing form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\n== Cartan decomposition on the Lie group level ==\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a non-compact semisimple Lie group and <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> its Lie algebra. Let <math>\\theta</math> be a Cartan involution on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and let <math>(\\mathfrak{k},\\mathfrak{p})</math> be the resulting Cartan pair.  Let <math>K</math> be the [[analytic subgroup]] of <math>G</math> with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>.  Then:\n* There is a Lie group automorphism <math>\\Theta</math> with differential <math>\\theta</math> at the identity that satisfies <math>\\Theta^2=1</math>.\n* The subgroup of elements fixed by <math>\\Theta</math> is <math>K</math>; in particular, <math>K</math> is a closed subgroup.\n* The mapping <math>K\\times\\mathfrak{p} \\rightarrow G</math> given by <math>(k,X) \\mapsto k\\cdot \\mathrm{exp}(X)</math> is a [[diffeomorphism]].\n* The subgroup <math>K</math> contains the center <math>Z_G</math> of <math>G</math>, and <math>K/Z_G</math> is compact.\n* The subgroup <math>K</math> is the maximal subgroup of <math>G</math> that contains the center and for which <math>K/Z_G</math> is compact.\n\nThe automorphism <math>\\Theta</math> is also called the ''global Cartan involution'', and the diffeomorphism <math>K\\times\\mathfrak{p} \\rightarrow G</math> is called the ''global Cartan decomposition''. If we write <math>P=\\mathrm{exp}(\\mathfrak{p})\\subset G</math>\nthis says that the product map <math>K\\times P \\rightarrow G</math> is a diffeomorphism so <math>G=KP</math>.\n\nFor the general linear group, <math> X \\mapsto (X^{-1})^T </math> is a Cartan involution.\n\nA refinement of the Cartan decomposition for symmetric spaces of compact or noncompact type states that the maximal Abelian subalgebras <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> are unique up to conjugation by <math>K</math>. Moreover,\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{p}= \\bigcup_{k\\in K} \\mathrm{Ad}\\, k \\cdot \\mathfrak{a}.}\n\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad\n\\displaystyle{P= \\bigcup_{k\\in K} \\mathrm{Ad}\\, k \\cdot A.}\n</math> \nwhere <math>A = e^\\mathfrak{a}</math>.\n\nIn the compact and noncompact case the global Cartan decomposition thus implies\n\n:<math>G = KAK,</math>\n\nGeometrically the image of the subgroup <math>A</math> in <math>G/K</math> is a [[totally geodesic]] submanifold.\n\n== Relation to polar decomposition ==\n\nConsider <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{R})</math> with the Cartan involution <math>\\theta(X)=-X^T</math>.  Then <math>\\mathfrak{k}=\\mathfrak{so}_n(\\mathbb{R})</math> is the real Lie algebra of skew-symmetric matrices, so that <math>K=\\mathrm{SO}(n)</math>, while <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is the subspace of symmetric matrices.  Thus the exponential map is a diffeomorphism from <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> onto the space of positive definite matrices.  Up to this exponential map, the global Cartan decomposition is the [[polar decomposition]] of a matrix. The polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is unique.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Lie group decompositions]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{more footnotes|date=March 2016}}\n*{{citation|first=Sigurdur|last= Helgason|authorlink=Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|title=Differential geometry, Lie groups, and symmetric spaces|year=1978|publisher=Academic Press|isbn= 0-8218-2848-7}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Kleiner|first=I.|title=A History of Abstract Algebra|year=2007|isbn=978-0817646844|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udj-1UuaOiIC&pg=PA46&dq=history+cartan+decomposition&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aa-wUuCDEMGmkQfNqoHABg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=history%20cartan%20decomposition&f=false|publisher=Birkhäuser}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Knapp|first=A.

All of these are named after the French [[mathematician]] [[Élie Cartan]]. Amusingly, the Cartan matrices in the context of [[Lie algebra]]s were first investigated by [[Wilhelm Killing]], whereas the [[Killing form]] is due to Cartan.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Lie algebras ==\n{{Lie groups}}\n\nA '''generalized Cartan matrix''' is a [[square matrix]] <math>A = (a_{ij})</math> with [[integer|integral]] entries such that\n\n# For diagonal entries, <math>a_{ii} = 2 </math>.\n# For non-diagonal entries, <math>a_{ij} \\leq 0 </math>.\n# <math>a_{ij} = 0</math> if and only if <math>a_{ji} = 0</math>\n# <math>A</math> can be written as <math>DS</math>, where <math>D</math> is a [[diagonal matrix]], and <math>S</math> is a [[symmetric matrix]].\n\nFor example, the Cartan matrix for [[G2 (mathematics)#Dynkin diagram and Cartan matrix|''G''<sub>2</sub>]] can be decomposed as such:\n:<math>\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n     2 & -3 \\\\\n    -1 &  2\n  \\end{bmatrix} =\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    3&0\\\\\n    0&1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix}\n     \\frac{2}{3} & -1 \\\\\n    -1           &  2\n  \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe third condition is not independent but is really a consequence of the first and fourth conditions.\n\nWe can always choose a ''D'' with positive diagonal entries. In that case, if ''S'' in the above decomposition is [[positive-definite matrix|positive definite]], then ''A'' is said to be a '''Cartan matrix'''.\n\nThe Cartan matrix of a simple [[Lie algebra]] is the matrix whose elements are the [[scalar product]]s\n\n:<math>a_{ji}=2 {(r_i,r_j)\\over (r_j,r_j)}</math> <ref>{{cite book |last1=Georgi |first1=Howard |title=Lie Algebras in Particle Physics |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=0-7382-0233-9 |page=115 |edition=2}}</ref>\n\n(sometimes called the '''Cartan integers''') where ''r<sub>i</sub>'' are the [[root system|simple roots]] of the algebra. The entries are integral from one of the properties of [[root system|root]]s. The first condition follows from the definition, the second from the fact that for <math>i\\neq j, r_j-{2(r_i,r_j)\\over (r_i,r_i)}r_i</math> is a root which is a [[linear combination]] of the simple roots ''r<sub>i</sub>'' and ''r<sub>j</sub>'' with a positive coefficient for ''r<sub>j</sub>'' and so, the coefficient for ''r<sub>i</sub>'' has to be nonnegative. The third is true because orthogonality is a symmetric relation. And lastly, let <math>D_{ij}={\\delta_{ij}\\over (r_i,r_i)}</math> and <math>S_{ij}=2(r_i,r_j)</math>. Because the simple roots span a [[Euclidean space]], S is positive definite.\n\nConversely, given a generalized Cartan matrix, one can recover its corresponding Lie algebra. (See [[Kac–Moody algebra]] for more details).\n\n=== Classification ===\nAn <math>n \\times n</math> matrix ''A'' is '''decomposable''' if there exists a nonempty proper subset <math>I \\subset \\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math> such that <math>a_{ij} = 0</math> whenever <math>i \\in I</math> and <math>j \\notin I</math>. ''A'' is '''indecomposable''' if it is not decomposable.\n\nLet ''A'' be an indecomposable generalized Cartan matrix. We say that ''A'' is of '''finite type''' if all of its [[principal minor]]s are positive, that ''A'' is of '''affine type''' if its proper principal minors are positive and ''A'' has [[determinant]] 0, and that ''A'' is of '''indefinite type''' otherwise.\n\nFinite type indecomposable matrices classify the finite dimensional [[simple Lie algebra]]s (of types <math>A_n, B_n, C_n, D_n, E_6, E_7, E_8, F_4, G_2 </math>), while affine type indecomposable matrices classify the [[affine Lie algebra]]s (say over some algebraically closed field of characteristic 0).\n\n==== Determinants of the Cartan matrices of the simple Lie algebras ====\nThe determinants of the Cartan matrices of the simple Lie algebras given in the following table (Along with A<sub>1</sub>=B<sub>1</sub>=C<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>=C<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>=A<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>=A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub>, E<sub>5</sub>=D<sub>5</sub>, E<sub>4</sub>=A<sub>4</sub>, and E<sub>3</sub>=A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>1</sub>)<ref>[https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/70011/JMAPAQ-23-11-2019-1.pdf Cartan-Gram determinants for the simple Lie Groups] Alfred C.

At this limit, there appears a [[gauge group|local symmetry group]]. The matrix of [[intersection number]]s of a basis of the two-cycles is conjectured to be the Cartan matrix of the [[Lie algebra]] of this local symmetry group.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sen|first=Ashoke|title=A Note on Enhanced Gauge Symmetries in M- and String Theory|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|volume=1997|issue=9|pages=001|year=1997|publisher=IOP Publishing|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/1997/09/001|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1126-6708/1997/09/001|arxiv=hep-th/9707123}}</ref>\n\nThis can be explained as follows. In M-theory one has [[soliton]]s which are two-dimensional surfaces called ''membranes'' or ''2-branes''. A 2-brane has a [[tension (physics)|tension]] and thus tends to shrink, but it may wrap around a two-cycles which prevents it from shrinking to zero.\n\nOne may [[Compactification (physics)|compactify]] one dimension which is shared by all two-cycles and their intersecting points, and then take the limit where this dimension shrinks to zero, thus getting a [[dimensional reduction]] over this dimension. Then one gets type IIA [[string theory]] as a limit of M-theory, with 2-branes wrapping a two-cycles now described by an open string stretched between [[D-brane]]s. There is a [[U(1)]] local symmetry group for each D-brane, resembling the [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of moving it without changing its orientation. The limit where the two-cycles have zero area is the limit where these D-branes are on top of each other, so that one gets an enhanced local symmetry group.\n\nNow, an open string stretched between two D-branes represents a Lie algebra generator, and the [[commutator]] of two such generator is a third one, represented by an open string which one gets by gluing together the edges of two open strings. \nThe latter relation between different open strings is dependent on the way 2-branes may intersect in the original M-theory, i.e. in the intersection numbers of two-cycles. Thus the Lie algebra depends entirely on these intersection numbers. The precise relation to the Cartan matrix is because the latter describes the commutators of the [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s, which are related to the two-cycles in the basis that is chosen.\n\nNote that generators in the [[Cartan subalgebra]] are represented by open strings which are stretched between a D-brane and itself.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dynkin diagram]]\n* [[Exceptional Jordan algebra]]\n* [[Fundamental representation]]\n* [[Killing form]]\n* [[Simple Lie group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | first1=William | last1=Fulton | authorlink=William Fulton (mathematician) | first2=Joe | last2=Harris |authorlink2=Joe Harris (mathematician)  | title=Representation theory: A first course | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=129 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1991 | isbn=0-387-97495-4 | page=334 }}\n* {{cite book | first=James E. | last=Humphreys | title=Introduction to Lie algebras and representation theory | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=9 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1972 | isbn=0-387-90052-7 | pages=55–56 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-6398-2}}\n* {{Cite book|last=Kac|first= Victor G.|title=Infinite Dimensional Lie Algebras|edition=3rd|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year= 1990|isbn=978-0-521-46693-6}}.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Cartan matrix|id=p/c020530}}\n* {{mathworld | urlname = CartanMatrix | title = Cartan matrix }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cartan Matrix}}\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Representation theory]]"

(So, the centralizer of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> coincides with <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>.) The non-zero weights are called the '''[[root system|roots]]''', and the corresponding eigenspaces are called '''[[root system|root spaces]]''', and are all 1-dimensional. (See [[Semisimple_Lie algebra#Cartan_subalgebras|Cartan subalgebras of semisimple Lie algebras]] for more information.)\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a [[linear Lie algebra]] (a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra of endomorphisms of a finite-dimensional vector space ''V'') over an algebraically closed field, then any Cartan subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the [[centralizer]] of a maximal [[toral Lie algebra|toral Lie subalgebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>; that is, a subalgebra consisting entirely of elements which are diagonalizable as endomorphisms of ''V'' which is maximal in the sense that it is not properly included in any other such subalgebra. If <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is semisimple and the field has characteristic zero, then a maximal toral subalgebra is self-normalizing, and so is equal to the associated Cartan subalgebra.  If in addition <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is semisimple, then the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint representation]] presents <math>\\mathfrak g</math> as a linear Lie algebra, so that  a subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is Cartan if and only if it is a maximal toral subalgebra. An advantage of this approach is that it is trivial to show the existence of such a subalgebra. In fact, if <math>\\mathfrak g</math> has only nilpotent elements, then it is [[nilpotent Lie algebra|nilpotent]] ([[Engel's theorem]]), but then its [[Killing form]] is identically zero, contradicting semisimplicity.

For example, the Lie algebra ''sl''<sub>2''n''</sub>('''C''') of 2''n'' by 2''n'' matrices of trace 0 has a Cartan subalgebra of rank 2''n''−1 but has a maximal abelian subalgebra of dimension ''n''<sup>2</sup> consisting of all matrices of the form <math>{0\\ A\\choose 0\\ 0}</math> with ''A'' any ''n'' by ''n'' matrix.  One can directly see this abelian subalgebra is not a Cartan subalgebra, since it is contained in the nilpotent algebra of strictly upper triangular matrices (or, since it is normalized by diagonal matrices).\n\n== Splitting Cartan subalgebra ==\n{{main|Splitting Cartan subalgebra}}\n\nOver non-algebraically closed fields, not all Cartan subalgebras are conjugate.

Any two splitting Cartan algebras are conjugate, and they fulfill a similar function to Cartan algebras in semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, so split semisimple Lie algebras (indeed, split reductive Lie algebras) share many properties with semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields.\n\nOver a non-algebraically closed field not every semisimple Lie algebra is splittable, however.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cartan subgroup]]\n*[[Carter subgroup]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Linear algebraic groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-387-97370-8 | mr=1102012 | year=1991 | volume=126}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Jacobson | first1=Nathan | author1-link=Nathan Jacobson | title=Lie algebras | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-486-63832-4 | mr=559927 | year=1979}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Humphreys | first1=James E. | title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-90053-7 | year=1972}}\n*{{springer|id=C/c020550|first=V.L.|last= Popov|authorlink=Vladimir L.

The converse is false: there are non-nilpotent Lie algebras whose Killing form vanishes. An example is given by the semidirect product of an abelian Lie algebra ''V''  with a 1-dimensional Lie algebra acting on ''V'' as an endomorphism ''b'' such that ''b'' is not nilpotent and Tr(''b''<sup>2</sup>)=0.\n\nIn characteristic 0, every reductive Lie algebra (one that is a sum of abelian and simple Lie algebras) has a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form. However the converse is false: a Lie algebra with a non-degenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form need not be a sum of simple and abelian Lie algebras. A typical counterexample is ''G'' = ''L''[''t'']/''t''<sup>''n''</sup>''L''[''t''] where ''n''>1, ''L'' is a simple complex Lie algebra with a bilinear form (,), and the bilinear form on ''G'' is given by taking the coefficient of ''t''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> of the '''C'''[''t'']-valued bilinear form on ''G'' induced by the form on ''L''.

It is the simplest to define, and so is given first. However, one may also have Casimir invariants of higher order, which correspond to homogeneous symmetric polynomials of higher order; their definition is given last.\n\n===Quadratic Casimir element===\nSuppose that <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is an <math>n</math>-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]]. Let ''B'' be a nondegenerate [[bilinear form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> that is invariant under the [[Adjoint_representation_of_a_Lie_algebra|adjoint action]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on itself, meaning that <math>B(ad_XY,Z)+B(Y,ad_XZ)=0</math> for all X,Y,Z in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. (The most typical choice of ''B'' is the [[Killing form]].)\nLet\n:<math>\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe any [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and\n:<math>\\{X^i\\}_{i=1}^n</math>\nbe the dual basis of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with respect to ''B''. The '''Casimir element''' <math>\\Omega</math> for ''B'' is the element of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math> given by the formula \n:<math>\\Omega = \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i X^i.</math>\n\nAlthough the definition relies on a choice of basis for the Lie algebra, it is easy to show that ''Ω'' is independent of this choice. On the other hand, ''Ω''  does depend on the bilinear form ''B''. The invariance of ''B'' implies that the Casimir element commutes with all elements of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, and hence lies in the center of the universal enveloping algebra <math>U(\\mathfrak{g})</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.5</ref>\n\n===Casimir invariant of a linear representation and of a smooth action===\n\nGiven a [[Lie algebra representation|representation]] ρ of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on a vector space V, possibly infinite-dimensional, the '''Casimir invariant''' of ρ is defined to be ρ(Ω), the linear operator on V given by the formula\n\n:<math>\\rho(\\Omega) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\rho(X_i)\\rho(X^i).</math>\n\nHere we are assuming that ''B'' is the Killing form, otherwise ''B'' must be specified.\n\nA specific form of this construction plays an important role in differential geometry and global analysis. Suppose that a connected Lie group G with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> [[Lie group action|acts]] on a differentiable manifold ''M''. Consider the corresponding representation ρ of ''G'' on the space of smooth functions on M. Then elements of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are represented by first order differential operators on M. In this situation, the Casimir invariant of ρ is the G-invariant second order differential operator on ''M'' defined by the above formula. \n\nSpecializing further, if it happens that ''M'' has a [[Riemannian metric]] on which ''G'' acts transitively by isometries, and the stabilizer subgroup ''G''<sub>x</sub> of a point acts irreducibly on the tangent space of ''M'' at ''x'', then the Casimir invariant of ρ is a scalar multiple of the [[Laplacian operator]] coming from the metric. \n\nMore general Casimir invariants may also be defined, commonly occurring in the study of [[pseudo-differential operator]]s in [[Fredholm theory]].\n\n===General case===\nThe article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s gives a detailed, precise definition of Casimir operators, and an exposition of some of their properties. In particular, all Casimir operators correspond to symmetric [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in the [[symmetric algebra]] of the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] <math>\\mbox{ad}_\\mathfrak{g}.</math>  That is, in general, one has that any Casimir operator will have the form\n\n:<math>C_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} X_i \\otimes X_j \\otimes \\cdots\\otimes X_k</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''m''}} is the order of the symmetric tensor <math>\\kappa^{ij\\cdots k}</math> and the <math>X_i</math> form a [[vector space basis]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math> This corresponds to a symmetric homogeneous polynomial\n\n:<math>c_{(m)} = \\kappa^{ij\\cdots k} t_i t_j \\cdots t_k</math>\nin {{math|''m''}} indeterminate variables <math>t_i</math> in the [[polynomial algebra]] <math>K[t_i, t_j, \\cdots ,t_k]</math> over a field {{math|''K''.}} The reason for the symmetry follows from the [[PBW theorem]] and is discussed in much greater detail in the article on [[universal enveloping algebra]]s.\n\n''Not just any'' symmetric tensor (symmetric homogeneous polynomial) will do; it must explicitly commute with the Lie bracket.  That is, one ''must'' have that \n\n:<math>[C_{(m)}, X_i] = 0</math>\nfor all basis elements <math>X_i.</math> Any proposed symmetric polynomial can be explicitly checked, making use of the [[structure constants]]\n:<math>[X_i,X_j]=f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}X_k</math>\nin order to obtain\n:<math>f_{ij}^{\\;\\; k}  \\kappa^{jl\\cdots m} \n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; l}  \\kappa^{kj\\cdots m} + \\cdots\n+ f_{ij}^{\\;\\; m}  \\kappa^{kl\\cdots j} = 0\n</math>\nThis result is originally due to [[Israel Gelfand]].<ref>Xavier Bekaert, \"[http://www.ulb.ac.be/sciences/ptm/pmif/Rencontres/ModaveI/Xavier.pdf Universal enveloping algebras and some applications in physics]\" (2005) ''Lecture, Modave Summer School in Mathematical Physics''.</ref>  The commutation relation implies that the Casimir operators lie in the center of the universal enveloping algebra, and, in particular, always commute with any element of the Lie algebra. It is due to this property of commutation that allows a [[representation of a Lie algebra]] to be labelled by eigenvalues of the associated Casimir operators. \n\nNote also that any linear combination of the symmetric polynomials described above will lie in the center as well: therefore, the Casimir operators are, by definition, restricted to that subset that span this space (that provide a basis for this space).  For a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] of rank {{math|''r'',}} there will be {{math|''r''}} Casimir invariants.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n===Uniqueness===\nSince for a simple lie algebra every invariant bilinear form is a multiple of the [[Killing form]], the corresponding Casimir element is uniquely defined up to a constant. For a general semisimple Lie algebra, the space of invariant bilinear forms has one basis vector for each simple component, and hence the same is true for the space of corresponding Casimir operators.\n\n===Relation to the Laplacian on G===\nIf <math>G</math> is a Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the  choice of an invariant bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> corresponds to a choice of bi-invariant [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian metric]] on <math>G</math>. Then under the identification of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with the left invariant differential operators on <math>G</math>, the Casimir element of the bilinear form on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> maps to the [[Laplace–Beltrami operator|Laplacian]] of <math>G</math> (with respect to the corresponding bi-invariant metric).\n\n===Generalizations===\nThe Casimir operator is a distinguished quadratic element of the [[center (algebra)|center]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the Lie algebra. In other words, it is a member of the algebra of all differential operators that commutes with all the generators in the Lie algebra. In fact all quadratic elements in the center of the universal enveloping algebra arise this way.\nHowever, the center may contain other, non-quadratic, elements.\n\nBy [[Giulio Racah|Racah]]'s theorem,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Racah|first1=Giulio|title=Group theory and spectroscopy|date=1965|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg}}</ref> for a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] the dimension of the center of the universal enveloping algebra is equal to its [[Semisimple Lie algebra#Rank|rank]]. The Casimir operator gives the concept of the [[Laplacian]] on a general [[semisimple Lie group]]; but this way of counting shows that there may be no unique analogue of the Laplacian, for rank > 1.\n\nBy definition any member of the center of the universal enveloping algebra commutes with all other elements in the algebra. By [[Schur's Lemma]], in any [[irreducible representation]] of the Lie algebra, the Casimir operator is thus proportional to the identity.  This constant of proportionality can be used to classify the representations of the Lie algebra (and hence, also of its [[Lie group]]). Physical mass and spin are examples of these constants, as are many other [[quantum number]]s found in [[quantum mechanics]]. Superficially, [[topological quantum number]]s form an exception to this pattern; although deeper theories hint that these are two facets of the same phenomenon.{{According to whom|date=December 2013}}.\n\n== Example: <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> ==\nThe Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> is the Lie algebra of [[SO(3)]], the rotation group for three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]].  It is simple of rank 1, and so it has a single independent Casimir. The Killing form for the rotation group is just the [[Kronecker delta]], and so the Casimir invariant is simply the sum of the squares of the generators <math>L_x,\\, L_y,\\, L_z</math> of the algebra.  That is, the Casimir invariant is given by\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2.</math>\n\nConsider the irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> in which the largest eigenvalue of <math>L_z</math> is <math>\\ell</math>, where the possible values of <math>\\ell</math> are <math>0,1/2,1,3/2,\\ldots</math>. The invariance of the Casimir operator implies that it is a multiple of the identity operator ''I''. This constant can be computed explicitly, giving the following result<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Proposition 17.8</ref>\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2=\\ell(\\ell+1)I.</math>\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], the scalar value <math>\\ell</math> is referred to as the [[total angular momentum]]. For finite-dimensional matrix-valued [[group representation|representations]] of the rotation group, <math>\\ell</math> always takes on integer values (for [[boson|bosonic representation]]s) or half-integer values (for [[fermion|fermionic representation]]s).\n\nFor a given value of <math>\\ell</math>, the matrix representation is <math>(2\\ell+1)</math>-dimensional. Thus, for example, the three-dimensional representation for <math>\\mathfrak{so}(3)</math> corresponds to <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>, and is given by the generators\n\n:<math>\nL_x=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& -1\\\\\n0& 1& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_y=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& 0& 1\\\\\n0& 0& 0\\\\\n-1& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix};\\quad\nL_z=\ni\\begin{pmatrix}\n0& -1& 0\\\\\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\nwhere the factors of <math>i</math> are needed for agreement with the physics convention (used here) that the generators should be self-adjoint operators.\n\nThe quadratic Casimir invariant can then easily be computed by hand, with the result that\n\n:<math>L^2=L_x^2+L_y^2+L_z^2= 2\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1& 0& 0\\\\\n0& 1& 0\\\\\n0& 0& 1\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas <math>\\ell(\\ell+1)\\,=\\,2</math> when <math>\\ell\\,=\\,1</math>. Similarly, the two dimensional representation has a basis given by the [[Pauli matrices]], which correspond to [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1/2, and one can again check the formula for the Casimir by direct computation.\n\n==Eigenvalues==\nGiven that <math>\\Omega</math> is central in the enveloping algebra, it acts on simple modules by a scalar. Let <math>\\langle,\\rangle</math> be any bilinear symmetric non-degenerate form, by which we define <math>\\Omega</math>. Let <math>L(\\lambda)</math> be the finite dimensional highest weight module of weight <math>\\lambda</math>. Then the Casimir element <math>\\Omega</math> acts on <math>L(\\lambda)</math> by the constant \n:<math>\\langle \\lambda, \\lambda + 2 \\rho \\rangle=\\langle\\lambda+\\rho,\\lambda+\\rho\\rangle - \\langle\\rho,\\rho\\rangle ,</math> \nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the weight defined by half the sum of the positive roots.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 10.6</ref> \n\nAn important point is that if <math>L(\\lambda)</math> is nontrivial (i.e. if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>), then the above constant is nonzero. After all, since <math>\\lambda</math> is dominant, if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math>, then <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda\\rangle>0</math> and <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\rho\\rangle\\geq 0</math>, showing that <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\lambda+2\\rho\\rangle >0</math>. This observation plays an important role in the proof of [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]]. It is also possible to prove the nonvanishing of the eigenvalue in a more abstract way—without using an explicit formula for the eigenvalue—using Cartan's criterion; see Sections 4.3 and 6.2 in the book of Humphreys.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Harish-Chandra isomorphism]]\n*[[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Quantum Theory for Mathematicians|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=267|publisher=Springer|year=2013}}\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Humphreys | first=James E. | title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory | edition=Second printing, revised | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | volume=9 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | location=New York | year=1978 | isbn=0-387-90053-5 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Jacobson | first=Nathan | title=Lie algebras | publisher=Dover Publications | year=1979 | isbn=0-486-63832-4 | pages=243–249 }}\n\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "text": "In mathematical physics, [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients]] are the expansion coefficients of [[total angular momentum]] [[eigenstate]]s in an uncoupled [[tensor product]] basis. Mathematically, they specify the decomposition of the tensor product of two irreducible representations into a [[direct sum]] of irreducible representations, where the type and the multiplicities of these irreducible representations are known abstractly. The name derives from the German mathematicians [[Alfred Clebsch]] (1833–1872) and [[Paul Gordan]] (1837–1912), who encountered an equivalent problem in invariant theory.\n\nGeneralization to SU(3) of Clebsch–Gordan coefficients is useful because of their utility in characterizing [[Hadron|hadronic decays]], where a [[Flavour (particle physics)|flavor-SU(3) symmetry]] exists (the [[Eightfold Way (physics)]]) that connects the three light  [[quarks]]: [[Up quark|up]], [[Down quark|down]], and [[Strange quark|strange]].\n\n==Groups==\n{{Main article|Group (mathematics)}}\nA group is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form <math>(G,*))</math> consisting of a set {{mvar|G}} and a [[binary operation]] (*) (often called a 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:\n# '''Closure''': For every pair of elements {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|G}}, the ''product'' <math>x*y</math> is also in {{mvar|G}}  ( in symbols, for every two elements <math>x,y\\in G,x*y</math> is also in <math>G.</math>\n# '''Associativity''': For every {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|G}}, both <math>(x*y)*z</math> and <math>x*(y*z)</math> result with the same element in {{mvar|G}} ( in symbols, <math>(x*y)*z=x*(y*z)</math> for every <math>x,y</math>, and <math>z \\in G</math>).\n# '''Existence of identity''': There must be an element ( say {{mvar|e}} ) in {{mvar|G}} such that product any element of {{mvar|G}} with {{mvar|e}} make no change to the element ( in symbols, <math>x*e=e*x= x</math> for every <math>x\\in G</math>).\n# '''Existence of inverse''': For each element ({{mvar|x}} ) in {{mvar|G}}, there must be an element {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|G}} such that product of {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is the identity element {{mvar|e}} ( in symbols, for each <math>x\\in G</math> there is a <math>y \\in  G</math> such that <math>x*y=y*x=e</math> for every;<math>x\\in G</math>).\n# '''Commutative''': In addition to the above four, if it so happens that <math>\n\\forall x,y\\in G</math>, <math>x*y=y*x</math>, then the group is called an [[Abelian group]]. Otherwise it is called a non-Abelian group.\n\n==Symmetry group==\n{{Main article|Symmetry group}}\nIn abstract algebra, the symmetry group of an object (image, signal, etc.) is the group of all [[isometry|isometries]] under which the object is invariant with composition as the operation. It is a [[subgroup]] of the [[isometry group]] of the space concerned.<ref>''Group Theory and its Application to Physical Problems''-Morton Hammermesh, {{ISBN|978-0486661810}}, Chapter-2</ref> In quantum mechanics, all transformations of a system that leave the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] unchanged comprise the ''symmetry group'' of the Hamiltonian.

All transformations have an inverse. Thus, these form a group <ref>http://www.phys.nthu.edu.tw/~class/Group_theory/Chap%201.pdf</ref>\n\n==The SU(3) group==\n{{main article|Special unitary group}}\nThe [[special unitary group]] '''''SU''''' is the group of [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] whose determinant is equal to 1.<ref>P. Carruthers (1966) ''Introduction to Unitary symmetry'', Interscience. [https://books.google.com/books?id=t33soAEACAAJ online].</ref>  This set is closed under matrix multiplication. All transformations characterized by the special unitary group leave norms unchanged. The  {{math|SU(3)}} symmetry appears in [[quantum chromodynamics]], and, as already indicated in the light quark flavour symmetry dubbed the [[Eightfold Way (physics)]]. The quarks possess colour quantum numbers and form the fundamental (triplet) representation of an {{math|SU(3)}} group.\n\nThe group {{math|SU(3)}} is a subgroup of group {{math|U(3)}}, the group of all 3×3 unitary matrices. The unitarity condition imposes nine constraint relations on the total 18 degrees of freedom of a 3×3 complex matrix. Thus, the dimension of the {{math|U(3)}} group is 9. Furthermore, multiplying a ''U'' by a phase, {{math|e<sup>''iφ''</sup>}} leaves the norm invariant. Thus  {{math|U(3)}} can be decomposed into a direct product of {{math|U(1)⊗SU(3)}}. Because of this additional constraint,  {{math|SU(3)}} has dimension 8.\n\n===Generators of the Lie algebra===\nEvery unitary matrix {{mvar|U}} can be written in the form\n: <math>U=e^{iH} \\, </math>\nwhere ''H'' is [[Hermitian matrix|hermitian]]. The elements of  {{math|SU(3)}} can be expressed as\n: <math>U=e^{i\\sum{a_k\\lambda_k}}</math>\nwhere <math>\\lambda_k</math> are the 8 linearly independent matrices forming the basis of the [[Lie algebra]] of  {{math|SU(3)}}, in the tripet representation. The unit determinant condition requires the <math>\\lambda_k</math> matrices to be traceless, since\n: <math>\\det(e^A)=e^{\\operatorname{tr} (A)}</math>.\n\nAn explicit basis in the fundamental, '''3''', representation can be constructed in analogy to the Pauli matrix algebra of the spin operators. It consists of the [[Gell-Mann matrices]],\n: <math>\n\\begin{array}{ccc}\n\\lambda_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} &  \n\\lambda_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i & 0 \\\\ i & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} &\n\\lambda_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\  \\\\\n\\lambda_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} & \n\\lambda_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & -i \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ i & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\\\  \\\\\n\\lambda_6 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} & \n\\lambda_7 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -i \\\\ 0 & i & 0 \\end{pmatrix} &\n\\lambda_8 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nThese are the generators of the {{math|SU(3)}} group in the triplet representation, and they are normalized as\n: <math>\\operatorname{tr}(\\lambda_j\\lambda_k)=2\\delta_{jk} .</math>\n\nThe Lie algebra structure constants of the group are given by the commutators of <math>\\lambda_k</math>\n: <math>[\\lambda_j,\\lambda_k]=2if_{jkl}\\lambda_l ~,</math>\nwhere <math>f_{jkl}</math> are the structure constants completely  antisymmetric and are analogous to the Levi-Civita symbol <math>\\epsilon_{jkl}</math> of {{math|SU(2)}}.  \n\nIn general, they vanish, unless they contain an odd number of indices from the set {2,5,7}, corresponding to the antisymmetric {{mvar|λ}}s.

Here, <math>\\hat{I}_3</math> stands for the z-component of [[Isospin]] and <math>\\hat{Y}</math> is the [[Hypercharge]], and they comprise the (abelian) [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the full Lie algebra. The maximum number of mutually commuting generators of a Lie algebra is called its ''rank'':  {{math|SU(3)}} has rank 2. The remaining 6 generators, the ± ladder operators, correspond to the 6 [[root system|roots]] arranged on the 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice of the figure.\n\n===Casimir operators ===\n{{Main article|Casimir operator}}\nThe '''Casimir operator''' is an operator that commutes with all the generators of the Lie group.

This  is because states in a given representation are connected by the action of the generators of the Lie algebra, and all generators commute with the Casimir operators.\n\nFor example, for the triplet representation, {{math|''D''(1,0)}}, the eigenvalue of {{tmath|\\hat{C}_1}} is 4/3, and of {{tmath|\\hat{C}_2}}, 10/9.\n\nMore generally, from [[Freudenthal's formula]], for generic {{math|D(p,q)}}, the eigenvalue<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.38.215| title = Dynamical Symmetry in Particle Physics| journal = Reviews of Modern Physics| volume = 38| issue = 2| pages = 215–255| year = 1966| last1 = Pais | first1 = A.|bibcode = 1966RvMP...38..215P }}, (3.65)</ref> of {{tmath|\\hat{C}_1}} is <math>(p^2+q^2+3p+3q+pq)/3</math>.\n\nThe eigenvalue (\"anomaly coefficient\") of {{tmath|\\hat{C}_2}} is<ref>Pais, ibid.

Each irreducible representation corresponds to a single-particle state and a product of more than one irreducible representation indicates a multiparticle state.\n\nSince the particles are mostly indistinguishable in quantum mechanics, this approximately relates to several permutable particles.  The permutations of {{mvar|n}} identical particles constitute the [[Permutation group|symmetric group]] '''S'''<sub>{{mvar|n}}</sub>. Every {{mvar|n}}-particle state of  '''S'''<sub>{{mvar|n}}</sub> that is made up of single-particle states of the fundamental  {{mvar|N}}-dimensional SU(N) multiplet belongs to an irreducible SU(N) representation. Thus, it can be used to determine the Clebsch–Gordan series for any unitary group.<ref name=\"Arfken\">''Mathematical Methods for Physicists'' by George B. Arfken, Hans J. Weber.

[[File:Young tableaux 1.jpeg|thumb|350px|A sample Young tableau.

Following rules are followed while constructing the tableaux:<ref name=\"Arfken\" />\n# A row must not be longer than the one before it.\n# The quantum labels (numbers in the <big>□</big>) should not decrease while going left to right in a row.\n# The quantum labels must strictly increase while going down in a column.\n\n===Case for ''N'' = 3===\nFor ''N''=3 that is in the case of SU(3), the following situation arises. In SU(3) there are three labels, they are generally designated by (u,d,s) corresponding to up, down and strange quarks which follows the SU(3) algebra. They can also be designated generically as (1,2,3). For two particle system, we have the following six symmetry states:\n\n:{|\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top\"\n|<math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\nuu\n}\n</math> || || <math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (ud+du)\n}\n</math> || || <math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (us+su)\n}\n</math> || || <math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n2 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\ndd\n}\n</math> || || <math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (ds+sd)\n}\n</math> || || <math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|}\n\\hline\n3 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\nss\n}\n</math>\n|}\nand the following three antisymmetric states:\n\n:<math>\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|}\n\\hline\n1 \\\\ \n\\hline\n2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (ud-du)\n}\n\\qquad\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|}\n\\hline\n1 \\\\ \n\\hline\n3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (us-su)\n}\n\\qquad\n{\n\\begin{array}{|c|}\n\\hline\n2 \\\\ \n\\hline\n3 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\atop\n\\frac 1 \\sqrt 2 (ds-sd)\n}\n</math>\nThe 1-column, 3-row tableau is the singlet, and so all tableaux of nontrivial irreps of SU(3) cannot have more than two rows.

      "text": "{{Lie groups |Semi-simple}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''complexification''' or '''universal complexification''' of a [[real Lie group]] is given by a continuous homomorphism of the group into a [[complex Lie group]] with the universal property that every continuous homomorphism of the original group into another complex Lie group extends compatibly to a complex analytic homomorphism between the complex Lie groups. The complexification, which always exists, is unique up to isomorphism. Its [[Lie algebra]] is a quotient of the [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra of the original group. They are isomorphic if the original group has a quotient by a discrete normal subgroup which is linear.\n\nFor [[compact Lie group]]s, the complexification, sometimes called the '''Chevalley complexification''' after [[Claude Chevalley]], can be defined as the group of complex characters of the [[Hopf algebra]] of [[representative function]]s, i.e. the [[matrix coefficient]]s of finite-dimensional [[unitary representation|representation]]s of the group. In any finite-dimensional faithful unitary representation of the compact group it can be realized concretely as a closed subgroup of the complex [[general linear group]]. It consists of operators with [[polar decomposition]] {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''u'' • exp ''iX''}}, where {{math|''u''}} is a unitary operator in the compact group and {{math|''X''}} is a skew-adjoint operator in its Lie algebra. In this case the complexification is a [[algebraic group|complex algebraic group]] and its Lie algebra is the complexification of the Lie algebra of the compact Lie group.\n\n==Universal complexification==\n\n===Definition===\nIf {{math|''G''}} is a Lie group, a '''universal complexification''' is given by a complex Lie group {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} and a continuous homomorphism {{math|''φ'': ''G'' → ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} with the universal property that, if {{math|''f'': ''G'' → ''H''}} is an arbitrary continuous homomorphism into a complex Lie group {{math|''H''}}, then there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism {{math|''F'': ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> →  ''H''}} such that {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''F'' ∘ ''φ''}}. \n\nUniversal complexifications always exist and are unique up to a unique complex analytic isomorphism (preserving inclusion of the original group).\n\n===Existence===\nIf {{math|''G''}} is connected with Lie algebra {{math|𝖌}}, then its [[universal covering group]] {{math|'''G'''}} is simply connected. Let {{math|'''G'''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} be the simply connected complex Lie group with Lie algebra {{math|𝖌 ⊗ '''C'''}}. Let {{math|''Φ'':  '''G'''  → '''G'''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} be the natural homomorphism and {{math|''π'':'''G'''  → ''G''}} the natural covering map. Then given a homomorphism {{math|''f'': ''G'' → ''H''}}, there is a unique complex analytic homomorphism {{math|''E'':  '''G'''<sub>'''C'''</sub> → ''H''}} such that {{math|''f'' ∘ ''π''  {{=}} ''E'' ∘ ''Φ''}}. Let {{math|''K''}} be the intersection of the kernels of the homomorphisms {{math|''E''}} as {{math|''f''}} varies over all possibilities. Then {{math|''K''}} is a closed normal complex Lie subgroup of {{math|'''G'''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} and the quotient group is a universal complexification. In particular if {{math|''G''}} is simply connected, its universal complexification is just {{math|'''G'''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}.<ref>See:\n\n* {{harvnb|Hochschild|1965|P=204-205}}\n* {{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=212–214}}</ref>\n\nFor non-connected Lie groups {{math|''G''}} with identity component {{math|''G''<sup>o</sup>}} and component group {{math|Γ {{=}} ''G'' / ''G''<sup>o</sup>}}, the extension\n\n:<math> \\{1\\} \\rightarrow G^o \\rightarrow G \\rightarrow \\Gamma \\rightarrow \\{1\\} </math>\n\ninduces an extension\n\n:<math>\\{1\\} \\rightarrow (G^o)_{\\mathbf{C}} \\rightarrow G_{\\mathbf{C}} \\rightarrow \\Gamma \\rightarrow \\{1\\} </math>\n\nand the complex Lie group {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} is a complexification of {{math|''G''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1981|pp=210–214}}</ref>\n\n===Uniqueness===\nThe universal property implies that the universal complexification is unique up to complex analytic isomorphism.\n\n===Injectivity===\nIf the original group is linear, so too is the universal complexification and the homomorphism between the two is an inclusion.<ref>{{harvnb|Hochschild|1966}}</ref> {{harvtxt|Onishchik|Vinberg|1994}} give an example of a connected real Lie group for which the homomorphism is not injective even at the Lie algebra level: they take the product of {{math|'''T'''}} by the [[universal covering group]] of {{math|SL(2,'''R''')}} and quotient out by the discrete cyclic subgroup generated by an irrational rotation in the first factor and a generator of the center in the second.\n\n==Chevalley complexification==\n\n===Hopf algebra of matrix coefficients===\nIf {{math|''G'' }}is a compact Lie group, the *-algebra {{math|''A''}} of matrix coefficients of finite-dimensional unitary representations is a uniformly dense *-subalgebra of {{math|''C''(''G'')}}, the *-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on {{math|''G''}}. It is naturally a [[Hopf algebra]] with [[comultiplication]] given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\Delta f(g,h)= f(gh).}</math>\n\nThe characters of {{math|''A''}} are the *-homomorphisms of {{math|''A''}} into {{math|'''C'''}}. They can be identified with the point evaluations {{math|''f'' ↦ ''f''(''g'')}} for {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''}} and the comultiplication allows the group structure on {{math|''G''}} to be recovered. The homomorphisms of {{math|''A''}} into {{math|'''C'''}} also form a group. It is a complex Lie group and can be identified with the complexification {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} of {{math|''G''}}. The *-algebra {{math|''A''}} is generated by the matrix coefficients of any faithful representation {{mvar|σ}} of {{math|''G''}}. It follows that {{mvar|σ}} defines a faithful complex analytic representation of {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Hochschild|1965}}\n*{{harvnb|Chevalley|1946}}\n*{{harvnb|Bröcker|tom Dieck|1985}}\n</ref>\n\n===Invariant theory===\nThe original approach of {{harvtxt|Chevalley|1946}} to the complexification of a compact Lie group can be concisely stated within the language of classical [[invariant theory]], described in {{harvtxt|Weyl|1946}}. Let {{math|''G''}} be a closed subgroup of the [[unitary group]] {{math|''U''(''V'')}} where {{math|''V''}} is a finite-dimensional complex inner product space. Its Lie algebra consists of all skew-adjoint operators {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|exp ''tX''}} lies in {{math|''G''}} for all real {{math|''t''}}. Set {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''V'' ⊕ '''C'''}} with the trivial action of {{math|''G''}} on the second summand. The group {{math|''G''}} acts on {{math|''W''<sup>⊗''N'' </sup>}}, with an element {{math|''u''}} acting as {{math|''u''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}}. The [[commutant]] (or centralizer algebra) is denoted by {{math|''A''<sub>''N''</sub> {{=}} End<sub>''G''</sub> ''W''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}}. It is generated as a *-algebra by its unitary operators and its commutant is the *-algebra spanned by the operators {{math|''u''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}}. The complexification {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} of {{math|''G''}} consists of all operators {{math|''g''}} in {{math|GL(''V'')}} such that {{math|''g''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}} commutes with {{math|''A''<sub>''N''</sub>}} and {{math|''g''}} acts trivially on the second summand in {{math|'''C'''}}. By definition it is a closed subgroup of {{math|GL(''V'')}}. The defining relations (as a commutant) show that {{math|''G''}} is an algebraic subgroup. Its intersection with {{math|''U''(''V'')}} coincides with {{math|''G''}}, since it is ''a priori'' a larger compact group for which the irreducible representations stay irreducible and inequivalent when restricted to {{math|''G''}}. Since {{math|''A''<sub>''N''</sub>}} is generated by unitaries, an invertible operator {{math|''g''}} lies in {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} if the unitary operator {{math|''u''}} and positive operator {{math|''p''}} in its [[polar decomposition]] {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''u'' ⋅ ''p''}} both lie in {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}. Thus {{math|''u''}} lies in {{math|''G''}} and the operator {{math|''p''}} can be written uniquely as {{math|''p'' {{=}} exp ''T''}} with {{math|''T''}} a self-adjoint operator. By the [[functional calculus]] for polynomial functions it follows that {{math|''h''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}} lies in the commutant of {{math|''A''<sub>''N''</sub>}} if {{math|''h'' {{=}} exp ''z'' ''T''}} with {{math|''z''}} in {{math|'''C'''}}. In particular taking {{math|''z''}} purely imaginary, {{math|''T''}} must have the form {{math|''iX''}} with {{math|''X''}} in the Lie algebra of {{math|''G''}}. Since every finite-dimensional representation of {{math|''G''}} occurs as a direct summand of {{math|''W''<sup>⊗''N''</sup>}}, it is left invariant by {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} and thus every finite-dimensional representation of {{math|''G''}} extends uniquely to {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}. The extension is compatible with the polar decomposition. Finally the polar decomposition implies that {{math|''G''}} is a maximal compact subgroup of {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, since a strictly larger compact subgroup would contain all integer powers of a positive operator {{math|''p''}}, a closed infinite discrete subgroup.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Chevalley|1946}}\n*{{harvnb|Weyl|1946}}</ref>\n\n==Decompositions in the Chevalley complexification==\n\n===Cartan decomposition===\nThe decomposition derived from the polar decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_{\\mathbf{C}} = G\\cdot P =G \\cdot \\exp i\\mathfrak{g},}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|𝖌}} is the Lie algebra of {{math|''G''}}, is called the '''[[Cartan decomposition]]''' of {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}. The exponential factor {{math|''P''}} is invariant under conjugation by {{math|''G''}} but is not a subgroup. The complexification is invariant under taking adjoints, since {{math|''G''}} consists of unitary operators and {{math|''P''}} of positive operators.\n\n===Gauss decomposition===\nThe '''Gauss decomposition''' is a generalization of the [[LU decomposition]] for the general linear group and a specialization of the [[Bruhat decomposition]]. For {{math|GL(''V'')}} it states that with respect to a given orthonormal basis {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}} an element {{math|''g''}} of {{math|GL(''V'')}} can be factorized in the form\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{g=XDY}</math>\n\nwith {{math|''X''}} lower [[unitriangular matrix|unitriangular]], {{math|''Y''}} upper unitriangular and {{math|''D''}} diagonal if and only if all the [[principal minor]]s of {{math|''g''}} are non-vanishing. In this case {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} and {{math|''D''}} are uniquely determined.\n\nIn fact Gaussian elimination shows there is a unique {{math|''X''}} such that {{math|''X''<sup>−1</sup> ''g''}} is upper triangular.<ref>{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973|p=28}}</ref>\n\nThe upper and lower unitriangular matrices, {{math|'''N'''<sub>+</sub>}} and {{math|'''N'''<sub>−</sub>}}, are closed unipotent subgroups of GL(''V''). Their Lie algebras consist of upper and lower strictly triangular matrices. The exponential mapping is a polynomial mapping from the Lie algebra to the corresponding subgroup by nilpotence. The inverse is given by the logarithm mapping which by unipotence is also a polynomial mapping. In particular there is a correspondence between closed connected subgroups of {{math|'''N'''<sub>±</sub>}} and subalgebras of their Lie algebras. The exponential map is onto in each case, since the polynomial function  {{math|log ( ''e''<sup>''A''</sup> ''e''<sup>''B''</sup> )}} lies in a given Lie subalgebra if {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} do and are sufficiently small.<ref>{{harvnb|Bump|2001|pp=202–203}}</ref>\n\nThe Gauss decomposition can be extended to complexifications of other closed connected subgroups {{math|''G''}} of {{math|U(''V'')}} by using the root decomposition to write the complexified Lie algebra as<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Bump|2001}}\n*{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathfrak{n}_- \\oplus \\mathfrak{t}_{\\mathbf{C}} \\oplus \\mathfrak{n}_+,}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|𝖙}} is the Lie algebra of a maximal torus {{math|''T''}} of {{math|''G''}} and {{math|𝖓<sub>±</sub>}} are the direct sum of the corresponding positive and negative root spaces. In the weight space decomposition of {{math|''V''}} as eigenspaces of {{math|''T'', 𝖙}} acts as diagonally, {{math|𝖓<sub>+</sub>}} acts as lowering operators and {{math|𝖓<sub>−</sub>}} as raising operators. {{math|𝖓<sub>±</sub>}} are nilpotent Lie algebras acting as nilpotent operators; they are each other's adjoints on {{math|''V''}}. In particular {{math|''T''}} acts by conjugation of {{math|𝖓<sub>+</sub>}}, so that {{math|𝖙<sub>'''C'''</sub> ⊕ 𝖓<sub>+</sub>}} is a semidirect product of a nilpotent Lie algebra by an abelian Lie algebra.\n\nBy [[Engel's theorem]], if {{math|𝖆 ⊕ 𝖓}} is a semidirect product, with {{math|𝖆}} abelian and {{math|𝖓}} nilpotent, acting on a finite-dimensional vector space {{math|''W''}} with operators in {{math|𝖆}} diagonalizable and operators in {{math|𝖓}} nilpotent, there is a vector {{math|''w''}} that is an eigenvector for {{math|𝖆}} and is annihilated by {{math|𝖓}}. In fact it is enough to show there is a vector annihilated by {{math|𝖓}}, which follows by induction on {{math|dim 𝖓}}, since the derived algebra {{math|𝖓'}} annihilates a non-zero subspace of vectors on which {{math|𝖓 / 𝖓'}} and {{math|𝖆}} act with the same hypotheses.\n\nApplying this argument repeatedly to {{math|𝖙<sub>'''C'''</sub> ⊕ 𝖓<sub>+</sub>}} shows that there is an orthonormal basis {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}}  of {{math|''V''}} consisting of eigenvectors of {{math|𝖙<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} with {{math|𝖓<sub>+</sub>}} acting as upper triangular matrices with zeros on the diagonal.\n\nIf {{math|''N''<sub>±</sub>}} and {{math|''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} are the complex Lie groups corresponding to {{math|𝖓<sub>+</sub>}} and {{math|𝖙<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, then the Gauss decomposition states that the subset\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{N_- T_{\\mathbf{C}} N_+}</math>\n\nis a direct product and consists of the elements in {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} for which the principal minors are non-vanishing. It is open and dense. Moreover, if {{math|'''T'''}} denotes the maximal torus in {{math|U(''V'')}},\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{N_\\pm=\\mathbf{N}_\\pm\\cap G_{\\mathbf{C}},\\,\\,\\, T_{\\mathbf{C}} = \\mathbf{T}_{\\mathbf{C}}\\cap G_{\\mathbf{C}}.}</math>\n\nThese results are an immediate consequence of the corresponding results for {{math|GL(''V'')}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Zhelobenko|1973}}</ref>\n\n===Bruhat decomposition===\nIf {{math|''W'' {{=}} ''N''<sub>''G''</sub>(''T'') / ''T''}} denotes the [[Weyl group]] of {{math|''T''}} and {{math|''B''}} denotes the [[Borel subgroup]] {{math|''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub> ''N''<sub>+</sub>}}, the Gauss decomposition is also a consequence of the more precise '''[[Bruhat decomposition]]'''\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_{\\mathbf{C}} =\\bigcup_{\\sigma\\in W} B\\sigma B,}</math>\n\ndecomposing {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} into a disjoint union of [[double coset]]s of {{math|''B''}}. The complex dimension of a double coset {{math|''BσB''}} is determined by the length of {{mvar|σ}} as an element of {{math|''W''}}.

From the properties of the Iwasawa decomposition for {{math|GL(''V'')}}, the map {{math|''G'' × ''A'' × ''N''}} is a diffeomorphism onto its image in {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, which is closed. On the other hand, the dimension of the image is the same as the dimension of {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, so it is also open.

In particular the identification between {{math|''G'' / ''T''}} and {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> / ''B''}} can be used to formulate the [[Borel–Weil theorem]]. It states that each irreducible representation\nof {{math|''G''}} can be obtained by [[induced representation|holomorphic induction]] from a character of {{math|''T''}}, or equivalently that it is realized in the space of [[section (fiber bundle)|section]]s of a [[holomorphic line bundle]] on {{math|''G'' / ''T''}}.\n\nThe closed connected subgroups of {{math|''G''}} containing {{math|''T''}} are described by [[Borel–de Siebenthal theory]]. They are exactly the [[centralizer]]s of tori {{math|''S'' ⊆ ''T''}}. Since every torus is generated topologically by a single element {{math|''x''}}, these are the same as centralizers {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''X'')}} of elements {{math|''X''}} in {{math|𝖙}}. By a result of Hopf {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'')}} is always connected: indeed any element {{math|''y''}} is along with {{math|''S''}} contained in some maximal torus, necessarily contained in {{math|C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'')}}.\n\nGiven an irreducible finite-dimensional representation {{math|''V''<sub>λ</sub>}} with highest weight vector {{math|''v''}} of weight {{math|''λ''}}, the stabilizer of {{math|'''C''' ''v''}} in {{math|''G''}} is a closed subgroup {{math|''H''}}. Since {{math|''v''}} is an eigenvector of {{math|''T''}}, {{math|''H''}} contains {{math|''T''}}. The complexification {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} also acts on {{math|''V''}} and the stabilizer is a closed complex subgroup {{math|''P''}} containing {{math|''T''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}. Since {{math|''v''}} is annihilated by every raising operator corresponding to a positive root {{math|''α''}}, {{math|''P''}} contains the Borel subgroup {{math|''B''}}. The vector {{math|''v''}} is also a highest weight vector for the copy of {{math|'''sl'''<sub>2</sub>}} corresponding to {{math|''α''}}, so it is annihilated by the lowering operator generating {{math|𝖌<sub>−''α''</sub>}} if {{math|(''λ'', ''α'') {{=}} 0}}.  The Lie algebra {{math|'''p'''}} of {{math|''P''}} is the direct sum of {{math|𝖙<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} and root space vectors annihilating {{math|''v''}}, so that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{p}=\\mathfrak{b}\\oplus \\bigoplus_{(\\alpha,\\lambda)=0} \\mathfrak{g}_{-\\alpha}.}</math>\n\nThe Lie algebra of {{math|''H'' {{=}} ''P'' ∩ ''G''}} is given by {{math|'''p''' ∩ 𝖌}}. By the Iwasawa decomposition {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> {{=}} ''GAN''}}. Since {{math|''AN''}} fixes {{math|'''C''' ''v''}}, the {{math|''G''}}-orbit of {{math|''v''}} in the complex projective space of {{math|''V''<sub>''λ''</sub>}} coincides with the {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} orbit and\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G/H=G_{\\mathbf{C}}/P.}</math>\n\nIn particular\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G/T=G_{\\mathbf{C}}/B.}</math>\n\nUsing the identification of the Lie algebra of {{math|''T''}} with its dual, {{math|''H''}} equals the centralizer of {{mvar|λ}} in {{math|''G''}}, and hence is connected. The group {{math|''P''}} is also connected. In fact the space {{math|''G'' / ''H''}} is simply connected,\nsince it can be written as the quotient of the (compact) universal covering group of the compact semisimple group {{math|''G'' / ''Z''}} by a connected subgroup, where {{math|''Z''}} is the center of {{math|''G''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978}}</ref> If {{math|''P''<sup>o</sup>}} is the identity component of {{math|''P''}},   {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> / ''P''}} has {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> / ''P''<sup>o</sup>}} as a covering space, so that {{math|''P'' {{=}} ''P''<sup>o</sup>}}. The homogeneous space {{math|''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> / ''P''}} has a complex structure, because {{math|''P''}} is a complex subgroup. The orbit in complex projective space is closed in the Zariski topology by [[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#Chow.27s theorem|Chow's theorem]], so is a smooth projective variety. The Borel–Weil theorem and its generalizations are discussed in this context in {{harvtxt|Serre|1954}}, {{harvtxt|Helgason|1994}}, {{harvtxt|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}} and {{harvtxt|Sepanski|2007}}.\n\nThe parabolic subgroup {{math|''P''}} can also be written as a union of double cosets of {{math|''B''}}\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{P=\\bigcup_{\\sigma\\in W_\\lambda} B\\sigma B,}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''W''<sub>''λ''</sub>}} is the stabilizer of {{mvar|λ}} in the Weyl group {{math|''W''}}.

(In fact this is true for any automorphism of ''G'', as shown for inner automorphisms by [[Robert Steinberg|Steinberg]] and in general by [[Armand Borel|Borel]].) <ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|pp=320–321}}\n*{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=46–48}}\n*{{harvnb|Duistermaar|Kolk|2000|pp=194–195}}\n*{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|p=151}}, Exercise 11\n</ref>\n\nThis can be seen most directly when the involution σ corresponds to a [[Hermitian symmetric space]]. In that case σ is inner and implemented by an element in a one-parameter subgroup  exp ''tT'' contained in the center of ''G''<sup>σ</sup>. The innerness of σ implies that ''K'' contains a maximal torus of ''G'', so has maximal rank. On the other hand, the centralizer of the subgroup generated by the torus ''S'' of elements exp ''tT'' is connected, since if ''x'' is any element in ''K'' there is a maximal torus containing ''x'' and ''S'',  which lies in the centralizer. On the other hand, it contains ''K'' since ''S'' is central in ''K'' and is contained in ''K'' since ''z'' lies in ''S''. So ''K'' is the centralizer of ''S'' and hence connected. In particular ''K'' contains the center of ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wolf|2010}}</ref>\n\nFor a general involution σ, the connectedness of ''G''<sup>σ</sup> can be seen as follows.<ref>See:\n{{harvnb|Bourbaki|1982|pp=46–48}}</ref>\n\nThe starting point is the Abelian version of the result: if ''T'' is a maximal torus of a simply connected group ''G'' and σ is an involution leaving invariant ''T'' and a choice of positive roots (or equivalently a [[Weyl chamber]]), then the fixed point subgroup ''T''<sup>σ</sup> is connected. In fact the kernel of the exponential map from <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> onto ''T'' is a lattice Λ with a '''Z'''-basis indexed by simple roots, which σ permutes. Splitting up according to orbits, ''T'' can be written as a product of terms '''T''' on which σ acts trivially or terms '''T'''<sup>2</sup> where σ interchanges the factors. The fixed point subgroup just corresponds to taking the diagonal subgroups in the second case, so is connected.\n\nNow let ''x'' be any element fixed by σ, let ''S'' be a maximal torus in C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'')<sup>σ</sup> and let ''T'' be the identity component of C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'', ''S''). Then ''T'' is a maximal torus in ''G'' containing ''x'' and ''S''. It is invariant under σ and the identity component of ''T''<sup>σ</sup> is ''S''. In fact since ''x'' and ''S'' commute, they are contained in a maximal torus which, because it is connected, must lie in ''T''. By construction ''T'' is invariant under σ. The identity component of ''T''<sup>σ</sup> contains  ''S'', lies in C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'')<sup>σ</sup> and centralizes ''S'', so it equals ''S''. But ''S'' is central in ''T'', to ''T'' must be Abelian and hence a maximal torus. For σ acts as multiplication by −1 on the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}\\ominus \\mathfrak{s}</math>, so it and therefore also <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> are Abelian.\n\nThe proof is completed by showing that σ preserves a Weyl chamber associated with ''T''. For then ''T''<sup>σ</sup> is connected so must equal ''S''. Hence ''x'' lies in ''S''.  Since ''x'' was arbitrary, ''G''<sup>σ</sup> must therefore be connected.\n\nTo produce a Weyl chamber invariant under σ, note that there is no root space <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\alpha</math> on which both ''x'' and ''S'' acted trivially, for this would contradict the fact that C<sub>''G''</sub>(''x'', ''S'') has the same Lie algebra as ''T''. Hence there must be an element ''s'' in ''S'' such that ''t'' = ''xs'' acts non-trivially on each root space. In this case ''t'' is a ''regular element'' of ''T''—the identity component of its centralizer in ''G'' equals ''T''. There is a unique [[affine Weyl group|Weyl alcove]] ''A'' in <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> such that ''t'' lies in exp ''A'' and 0 lies in the closure of ''A''. Since ''t'' is fixed by σ, the alcove is left invariant by σ and hence so also is the [[Weyl chamber]] ''C'' containing it.\n\n===Conjugations on the complexification===\nLet ''G'' be a simply connected compact Lie group with complexification ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. The map ''c''(''g'') = (''g''*)<sup>−1</sup> defines an automorphism of ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> as a real Lie group with ''G'' as fixed point subgroup. It is conjugate-linear on <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathbf{C}}</math> and satisfies ''c''<sup>2</sup> = id. Such automorphisms of either ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> or  <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathbf{C}}</math> are called '''conjugations'''.\nSince ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> is also simply connected any conjugation ''c''<sub>1</sub> on <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathbf{C}}</math> corresponds to a unique automorphism ''c''<sub>1</sub> of ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>.\n\nThe classification of conjugations ''c''<sub>0</sub> reduces to that of involutions σ of ''G'' because\ngiven a ''c''<sub>1</sub> there is an automorphism φ of the complex group ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> such that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{c_0=\\varphi\\circ c_1\\circ \\varphi^{-1}}</math>\n\ncommutes with ''c''. The conjugation ''c''<sub>0</sub> then leaves ''G'' invariant and restricts to an involutive automorphism σ. By simple connectivity the same is true at the level of Lie algebras. At the Lie algebra level ''c''<sub>0</sub> can be recovered from σ by the formula\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{c_0(X+iY)=\\sigma(X)- i\\sigma(Y)}</math>\n\nfor ''X'', ''Y'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nTo prove the existence of φ let ψ = ''c''<sub>1</sub>''c'' an automorphism of the complex group ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. On the Lie algebra level it defines a self-adjoint operator for the complex inner product\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(X,Y)=-B(X,c(Y)),}</math>\n\nwhere ''B'' is the [[Killing form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}_{\\mathbf{C}}</math>. Thus ψ<sup>2</sup> is a positive operator and an automorphism along with all its real powers. In particular take\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\varphi=(\\psi^2)^{1/4}}</math>\n\nIt satisfies\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{c_0c=\\varphi c_1 \\varphi^{-1} c=\\varphi cc_1 \\varphi=(\\psi^2)^{1/2} \\psi^{-1} =\\varphi^{-1} cc_1 \\varphi^{-1}=c \\varphi c_1\\varphi^{-1}=cc_0.}</math>\n\n===Cartan decomposition in a real form===\nFor the complexification ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>, the Cartan decomposition is described above. Derived from the [[polar decomposition]] in the complex [[general linear group]], it gives a diffeomorphism\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_{\\mathbf{C}} = G\\cdot \\exp i\\mathfrak{g} = G\\cdot P = P\\cdot G.}</math>\n\nOn ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> there is a conjugation operator ''c'' corresponding to ''G'' as well as an involution σ commuting with ''c''. Let ''c''<sub>0</sub> = ''c'' σ and let ''G''<sub>0</sub> be the fixed point subgroup of ''c''. It is closed in the matrix group ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub> and therefore a Lie group. The involution σ acts on both ''G'' and ''G''<sub>0</sub>. For the Lie algebra of ''G'' there is a decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k} \\oplus \\mathfrak{p}}</math>\n\ninto the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of σ. The fixed point subgroup ''K'' of σ in ''G'' is connected since ''G'' is simply connected. Its Lie algebra is the +1 eigenspace <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. The Lie algebra of ''G''<sub>0</sub> is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k} \\oplus \\mathfrak{p}}</math>\n\nand the fixed point subgroup of σ is again ''K'', so that ''G'' ∩ ''G''<sub>0</sub> = ''K''. In ''G''<sub>0</sub>, there is a Cartan decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{G_0=K\\cdot \\exp i\\mathfrak{p} =K\\cdot P_0 = P_0\\cdot K}</math>\n\nwhich is again a diffeomorphism onto the direct and corresponds to the polar decomposition of matrices.\nIt is the restriction of the decomposition on ''G''<sub>'''C'''</sub>. The product gives a diffeomorphism onto a closed subset of ''G''<sub>0</sub>. To check that it is surjective, for ''g'' in ''G''<sub>0</sub> write ''g'' = ''u'' ⋅ ''p'' with ''u'' in ''G'' and ''p'' in ''P''. Since ''c''<sub>0</sub> ''g'' = ''g'', uniqueness implies that σ''u'' = ''u'' and σ''p'' = ''p''<sup>−1</sup>. Hence ''u'' lies in ''K'' and ''p'' in ''P''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nThe Cartan decomposition in ''G''<sub>0</sub> shows that ''G''<sub>0</sub> is connected, simply connected and noncompact, because of the direct factor ''P''<sub>0</sub>. Thus ''G''<sub>0</sub> is a noncompact real semisimple Lie group.<ref>{{harvnb|Dieudonné|1977|pp=166–168}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, given a maximal Abelian subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>, ''A'' = exp  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is a toral subgroup such that σ(''a'') = ''a''<sup>−1</sup> on ''A''; and any two such <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>'s are conjugate by an element of ''K''.\nThe properties of ''A'' can be shown directly.  ''A'' is closed because the closure of ''A'' is a toral subgroup satisfying σ(''a'') = ''a''<sup>−1</sup>, so its Lie algebra lies in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> and hence equals <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> by maximality. ''A'' can be generated topologically by a single element exp ''X'', so  <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> is the centralizer of ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>. In the ''K''-orbit of any element of <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> there is an element ''Y'' such that (X,Ad ''k'' Y) is minimized at ''k'' = 1. Setting ''k'' = exp ''tT'' with ''T'' in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, it follows that (''X'',[''T'',''Y'']) = 0 and hence [''X'',''Y''] = 0, so that ''Y'' must lie in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>.

Notice here that the differential lowers the degree and so this differential graded Lie algebra is considered to be homologically graded. If instead the differential raised degree the differential graded Lie algebra is said to be cohomologically graded (usually to reinforce this point the grading is written in superscript: <math>L^i</math>). The choice of (co)homological grading usually depends upon personal preference or the situation as they are equivalent: a homologically graded space can be made into a cohomological one via setting <math>L^i=L_{-i}</math>.\n\nAlternative equivalent definitions of a differential graded Lie algebra include:\n\n# a Lie algebra object internal to the category of chain complexes;\n# a strict <math> L_\\infty </math>-algebra.\n\nA morphism of differential graded Lie algebras is a graded linear map <math>f:L\\to L^\\prime</math> that commutes with the bracket and the differential, i.e., <math>f [x,y]_{L}=[f(x),f(y)]_{L^\\prime}</math> and <math> f (d_L x) = d_{L^\\prime} f (x) </math>. Differential graded Lie algebras and their morphisms define a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n== Products and coproducts ==\n\nThe [[Product (mathematics)|product]] of two differential graded Lie algebras, <math>L\\times L^\\prime </math>, is defined as follows: take the direct sum of the two graded vector spaces <math>L\\oplus L^\\prime </math>, now equip it with the bracket <math>[(x,x^\\prime),(y,y^\\prime)]=([x,y],[x^\\prime,y^\\prime])</math> and differential <math> D(x,x^\\prime )=(dx,d^\\prime x^\\prime) </math>.\n\nThe [[coproduct]] of two differential graded Lie algebras, <math>L*L^\\prime</math>, is often called the free product. It is defined as the free graded Lie algebra on the two underlying vector spaces with the unique differential extending the two original ones.\n\n== Connection to deformation theory ==\n\nThe main application is to the [[deformation theory]] over [[Field (mathematics)|fields]] of characteristic zero (in particular over the complex numbers.)

One then classifies Dynkin diagrams according to the constraints they must satisfy, as described below.\n\nDropping the direction on the graph edges corresponds to replacing a root system by the [[finite reflection group]] it generates, the so-called [[Weyl group]], and thus undirected Dynkin diagrams classify Weyl groups.\n\nThey have the following correspondence for the Lie algebras associated to classical groups over the complex numbers:<ul><li><math>A_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak {sl}_{n+1}</math>, the [[special linear Lie algebra]].\n</li><li><math>B_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}</math>, the odd-dimensional [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]].</li><li><math>C_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak {sp}_{2n}</math>, the [[symplectic Lie algebra]].</li><li><math>D_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}</math>, the even-dimensional [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] (<math>n>1</math>).</li></ul>For the exceptional groups, the names for the lie algebra and the associated Dynkin diagram coincide.\n\n== Related classifications ==\n\nDynkin diagrams can be interpreted as classifying many distinct, related objects, and the notation \"A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, ...\" is used to refer to ''all'' such interpretations, depending on context; this ambiguity can be confusing.\n\nThe central classification is that a simple Lie algebra has a root system, to which is associated an (oriented) Dynkin diagram; all three of these may be referred to as B<sub>''n''</sub>, for instance.\n\nThe ''un''oriented Dynkin diagram is a form of Coxeter diagram, and corresponds to the Weyl group, which is the [[finite reflection group]] associated to the root system. Thus B<sub>''n''</sub> may refer to the unoriented diagram (a special kind of Coxeter diagram), the Weyl group (a concrete reflection group), or the abstract Coxeter group.\n\nNote that while the Weyl group is abstractly isomorphic to the Coxeter group, a specific isomorphism depends on an ordered choice of simple roots. Beware also that while Dynkin diagram notation is standardized, Coxeter diagram and group notation is varied and sometimes agrees with Dynkin diagram notation and sometimes does not.\n\nLastly, ''sometimes'' associated objects are referred to by the same notation, though this cannot always be done regularly. Examples include:\n* The [[root lattice]] generated by the root system, as in the [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]]. This is naturally defined, but not one-to-one – for example, A<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> both generate the [[hexagonal lattice]].\n* An associated polytope – for example [[Gosset 4 21 polytope|Gosset 4<sub>21</sub> polytope]] may be referred to as \"the E<sub>8</sub> polytope\", as its vertices are derived from the E<sub>8</sub> root system and it has the E<sub>8</sub> Coxeter group as symmetry group.\n* An associated quadratic form or manifold – for example, the [[E8 manifold|E<sub>8</sub> manifold]] has [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] given by the E<sub>8</sub> lattice.\nThese latter notations are mostly used for objects associated with exceptional diagrams – objects associated to the regular diagrams (A, B, C, D) instead have traditional names.\n\nThe index (the ''n'') equals to the number of nodes in the diagram, the number of simple roots in a basis, the dimension of the root lattice and span of the root system, the number of generators of the Coxeter group, and the rank of the Lie algebra. However, ''n'' does not equal the dimension of the defining module (a [[fundamental representation]]) of the Lie algebra – the index on the Dynkin diagram should not be confused with the index on the Lie algebra. For example, <math>B_4</math> corresponds to <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2\\cdot 4 + 1} = \\mathfrak{so}_9,</math> which naturally acts on 9-dimensional space, but has rank 4 as a Lie algebra.\n\nThe [[#Simply laced|simply laced]] Dynkin diagrams, those with no multiple edges (A, D, E) classify many further mathematical objects; see discussion at [[ADE classification]].\n\n===Example: A2===\n[[File:Root system A2.svg|thumb|The <math>A_2</math>, {{Dynkin|node|3|node}} root system.]]\nFor example, the symbol <math>A_2</math> may refer to:\n* The '''Dynkin diagram''' with 2 connected nodes, {{Dynkin|node|3|node}}, which may also be interpreted as a '''[[Coxeter diagram]]'''.\n* The '''[[root system]]''' with 2 simple roots at a <math>2\\pi/3</math> (120 degree) angle.\n* The '''Lie algebra''' <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_{2+1} = \\mathfrak{sl}_3</math> of [[rank (Lie algebra)|rank]] 2.\n* The '''[[Weyl group]]''' of symmetries of the roots (reflections in the hyperplane orthogonal to the roots), isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] <math>S_3</math> (of order 6).\n* The abstract '''[[Coxeter group]]''', presented by generators and relations, <math>\\left\\langle r_1,r_2 \\mid (r_1)^2=(r_2)^2=(r_ir_j)^3=1\\right\\rangle.</math>\n\n==Construction from root systems==\n\nConsider a [[root system]], assumed to be reduced and integral (or \"crystallographic\"). In many applications, this root system will arise from a [[semisimple Lie algebra]]. Let <math>\\Delta</math> be a set of [[Root_system#Positive_roots_and_simple_roots|positive simple roots]]. We then construct a diagram from <math>\\Delta</math> as follows.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 8.6</ref> Form a graph with one vertex for each element of <math>\\Delta</math>. Then insert edges between each pair of vertices according to the following recipe. If the roots corresponding to the two vertices are orthogonal, there is no edge between the vertices. If the angle between the two roots is 120 degrees, we put one edge between the vertices. If the angle is 135 degrees, we put two edges, and if the angle is 150 degrees, we put three edges. (These four cases exhaust all possible angles between pairs of positive simple roots.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Propositions 8.6 and 8.13</ref>) Finally, if there are any edges between a given pair of vertices, we decorate them with an arrow pointing from the vertex corresponding to the longer root to the vertex corresponding to the shorter one. (The arrow is omitted if the roots have the same length.) Thinking of the arrow as a \"greater than\" sign makes it clear which way the arrow should go. Dynkin diagrams lead to a [[Root_system#Classification_of_root_systems_by_Dynkin_diagrams|classification]] of root systems. Note also that the angles and length ratios between roots are [[Root_system#Elementary_consequences_of_the_root_system_axioms|related]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.6</ref> Thus, the edges for non-orthogonal roots may alternatively be described as one edge for a length ratio of 1, two edges for a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, and three edges for a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt{3}</math>. (There are no edges when the roots are orthogonal, regardless of the length ratio.)\n\nIn the A2 root system, shown at right, the roots labeled <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> form a base. Since these two roots are at angle of 120 degrees (with a length ratio of 1), the Dynkin diagram consists of two vertices connected by a single edge: {{Dynkin|node|3|node}}.\n\n== Constraints ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n\nDynkin diagrams must satisfy certain constraints; these are essentially those satisfied by finite [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]]s, together with an additional crystallographic constraint.\n\n== Connection with Coxeter diagrams ==\n\nDynkin diagrams are closely related to [[Coxeter-Dynkin diagram|Coxeter diagrams]] of finite [[Coxeter group]]s, and the terminology is often conflated.<ref group=\"note\">In this section we refer to the general class as \"Coxeter diagrams\" rather than \"Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams\" for clarity, as there is great potential for confusion, and for concision.</ref>\n\nDynkin diagrams differ from Coxeter diagrams of finite groups in two important respects:\n;Partly directed: Dynkin diagrams are ''partly [[directed graph|directed]]'' – any multiple edge (in Coxeter terms, labeled with \"4\" or above) has a direction (an arrow pointing from one node to the other); thus Dynkin diagrams have ''more'' data than the underlying Coxeter diagram (undirected graph).\n:At the level of root systems the direction corresponds to pointing towards the shorter vector; edges labeled \"3\" have no direction because the corresponding vectors must have equal length. (Caution: Some authors reverse this convention, with the arrow pointing towards the longer vector.)\n;Crystallographic restriction: Dynkin diagrams must satisfy an additional restriction, namely that the only allowable edge labels are 2, 3, 4, and 6, a restriction not shared by Coxeter diagrams, so not every Coxeter diagram of a finite group comes from a Dynkin diagram.\n:At the level of root systems this corresponds to the [[crystallographic restriction theorem]], as the roots form a lattice.\nA further difference, which is only stylistic, is that Dynkin diagrams are conventionally drawn with double or triple edges between nodes (for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4,&nbsp;6), rather than an edge labeled with \"''p''\".\n\nThe term \"Dynkin diagram\" at times refers to the ''directed'' graph, at times to the ''undirected'' graph. For precision, in this article \"Dynkin diagram\" will mean ''directed,'' and the underlying undirected graph will be called an \"undirected Dynkin diagram\".

However, not all maps of root systems arise as maps of diagrams.<ref name=\"armstrong\">[http://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/transformations-of-dynkin-diagrams/ Transformations of Dynkin Diagrams], John Armstrong, March 5, 2010</ref>\n\nFor example, there are two inclusions of root systems of A<sub>2</sub> in G<sub>2</sub>, either as the six long roots or the six short roots. However, the nodes in the G<sub>2</sub> diagram correspond to one long root and one short root, while the nodes in the A<sub>2</sub> diagram correspond to roots of equal length, and thus this map of root systems cannot be expressed as a map of the diagrams.\n\nSome inclusions of root systems can be expressed as one diagram being an [[induced subgraph]] of another, meaning \"a subset of the nodes, with all edges between them\". This is because eliminating a node from a Dynkin diagram corresponds to removing a simple root from a root system, which yields a root system of rank one lower. By contrast, removing an edge (or changing the multiplicity of an edge) while leaving the nodes unchanged corresponds to changing the angles between roots, which cannot be done without changing the entire root system. Thus, one can meaningfully remove nodes, but not edges. Removing a node from a connected diagram may yield a connected diagram (simple Lie algebra), if the node is a leaf, or a disconnected diagram (semisimple but not simple Lie algebra), with either two or three components (the latter for D<sub>''n''</sub> and E<sub>''n''</sub>). At the level of Lie algebras, these inclusions correspond to sub-Lie algebras.\n\nThe maximal subgraphs are as follows; subgraphs related by a [[#Automorphisms|diagram automorphism]] are labeled \"conjugate\":\n* A<sub>''n''+1</sub>: A<sub>''n''</sub>, in 2 conjugate ways.\n* B<sub>''n''+1</sub>: A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>.\n* C<sub>''n''+1</sub>: A<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>.\n* D<sub>''n''+1</sub>: A<sub>''n''</sub> (2 conjugate ways), D<sub>''n''</sub>.\n* E<sub>''n''+1</sub>: A<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>, E<sub>''n''</sub>.\n** For E<sub>6</sub>, two of these coincide: <math>\\mathrm{D}_5 \\cong \\mathrm{E}_5</math> and are conjugate.\n* F<sub>4</sub>: B<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>.\n* G<sub>2</sub>: A<sub>1</sub>, in 2 non-conjugate ways (as a long root or a short root).\n\nFinally, duality of diagrams corresponds to reversing the direction of arrows, if any:<ref name=\"armstrong\" /> B<sub>n</sub> and C<sub>n</sub> are dual, while F<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub> are self-dual, as are the simply-laced ADE diagrams.\n\n== Simply laced<!--'Simply laced Dynkin diagram' redirects here--> ==\n{{Main|ADE classification}}\n[[File:Simply Laced Dynkin Diagrams.svg|thumb|upright|The simply laced Dynkin diagrams classify diverse mathematical objects; this is called the [[ADE classification]].]]\n\nA Dynkin diagram with no multiple edges is called '''simply laced''', as are the corresponding Lie algebra and Lie group.

Beyond simplicity, a further benefit of this convention is that diagram automorphisms are realized by Euclidean isometries of the diagrams.\n\nAlternative convention include writing a number by the edge to indicate multiplicity (commonly used in Coxeter diagrams), darkening nodes to indicate root length, or using 120° angles on valence 2 nodes to make the nodes more distinct.\n\nThere are also conventions about numbering the nodes. The most common modern convention had developed by the 1960s and is illustrated in {{Harv|Bourbaki|1968}}.<ref name=\"overdraw\" />\n\n== Rank 2 Dynkin diagrams ==\n\nDynkin diagrams are equivalent to generalized [[Cartan matrix|Cartan matrices]], as shown in this table of rank 2 Dynkin diagrams with their corresponding ''2''x''2'' Cartan matrices.\n\nFor rank 2, the Cartan matrix form is:\n: <math>A = \\left [\\begin{matrix}2&a_{12}\\\\a_{21}&2\\end{matrix}\\right ]</math>\n\nA multi-edged diagram corresponds to the nondiagonal Cartan matrix elements -a<sub>21</sub>, -a<sub>12</sub>, with the number of edges drawn equal to '''max'''(-a<sub>21</sub>, -a<sub>12</sub>), and an arrow pointing towards nonunity elements.\n\nA '''generalized Cartan matrix''' is a [[square matrix]] <math>A = (a_{ij})</math> such that:\n# For diagonal entries, <math>a_{ii} = 2</math>.\n# For non-diagonal entries, <math>a_{ij} \\leq 0 </math>.\n# <math>a_{ij} = 0</math> if and only if <math>a_{ji} = 0</math>\n\nThe Cartan matrix determines whether the group is of '''finite type''' (if it is a [[Positive-definite matrix]], i.e. all eigenvalues are positive), of '''affine type''' (if it is not positive-definite but positive-semidefinite, i.e. all eigenvalues are non-negative), or of '''indefinite type'''. The indefinite type often is further subdivided, for example a Coxeter group is '''Lorentzian''' if it has one negative eigenvalue and all other eigenvalues are positive. Moreover, multiple sources refer to '''hyberbolic''' Coxeter groups, but there are several non-equivalent definitions for this term. In the discussion below, hyperbolic Coxeter groups are a special case of Lorentzian, satisfying an extra condition. Note that for rank 2, all negative determinant Cartan matrices correspond to hyperbolic Coxeter group. But in general, most negative determinant matrices are neither hyperbolic nor Lorentzian.\n\nFinite branches have (-a<sub>21</sub>, -a<sub>12</sub>)=(1,1), (2,1), (3,1), and affine branches (with a zero determinant) have (-a<sub>21</sub>, -a<sub>12</sub>) =(2,2) or (4,1).\n\n{| class=wikitable width=720\n|+ Rank 2 Dynkin diagrams\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Group<BR>name\n!colspan=3|Dynkin diagram\n!colspan=2|Cartan matrix\n!rowspan=2|Symmetry<BR>order\n!rowspan=2|Related<BR>simply-laced<BR>group<sup>3</sup>\n|-\n!(Standard)<BR>multi-edged<BR>graph<BR>{{Dynkin2|node_n1|3|node_n2}}\n!Valued<BR>graph<sup>1</sup>\n!Coxeter<BR>graph<sup>2</sup>\n!<math>\\left [\\begin{matrix}2&a_{12}\\\\a_{21}&2\\end{matrix}\\right ]</math>\n!Determinant<br>(4-a<sub>21</sub>*a<sub>12</sub>)\n|- align=center\n!colspan=7|[[Dynkin diagram#Finite Dynkin diagrams|Finite]] (Determinant>0)\n|- align=center\n!A<sub>1</sub>xA<sub>1</sub>\n|{{Dynkin|node}} {{Dynkin|node}}\n|{{Dynkin|node}} {{Dynkin|node}}\n| {{CDD|node|2|node}}\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&0\\\\0&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|4\n|2\n|&nbsp;\n|- align=center\n!A<sub>2</sub><BR>(undirected)\n|{{Dynkin|node|3|node}}\n|{{Dynkin|node|3|node}}\n| {{CDD|node|3|node}}\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-1&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|3\n|3\n|&nbsp;\n|- align=center\n!B<sub>2</sub>\n|{{Dynkin|node|4b|nodeg}}\n|{{Dynkin|node|v21|nodeg}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-2\\\\-1&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|2\n|4\n|<math>{A}_3</math> {{Dynkin|node|branch2}}\n|- align=center\n!C<sub>2</sub>\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|4a|node}}\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v12|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-2&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|2\n|4\n|<math>{A}_3</math> {{Dynkin|branch1|node}}\n|- align=center\n!BC<sub>2</sub><BR>(undirected)\n|{{Dynkin|node|4|node}}\n|\n| {{CDD|node|4|node}}\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-\\sqrt{2}\\\\-\\sqrt{2}&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|2\n|4\n|\n|- align=center\n!G<sub>2</sub>\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|6a|node}}\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v13|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-3&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|1\n|6\n|<math>{D}_4</math> [[File:Dynkin affine D3 folding.png]]\n|- align=center\n!G<sub>2</sub><BR>(undirected)\n|{{Dynkin|node|6|node}}\n|\n|{{CDD|node|6|node}}\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-\\sqrt{3}\\\\-\\sqrt{3}&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|1\n|6\n|\n|- align=center\n!colspan=7|[[Dynkin diagram#Affine Dynkin diagrams|Affine]] (Determinant=0)\n|- align=center\n!A<sub>1</sub><sup>(1)</sup>\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|4ab|nodeg}}\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v22|nodeg}}\n| {{CDD|node|infin|node}}\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-2\\\\-2&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|0\n|∞\n|<math>{\\tilde{A}}_3</math> [[File:Dynkin affine A3 folding.png]]\n|- align=center\n!A<sub>2</sub><sup>(2)</sup>\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|4c|node}}\n|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v14|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-4&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|0\n|∞\n|<math>{\\tilde{D}}_4</math> [[File:Dynkin affine D4 folding.png]]\n|- align=center\n!colspan=7|Hyperbolic (Determinant<0)\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v51|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-5&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -1\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v32|nodeg}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-2\\\\-3&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -2\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v61|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-6&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -2\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v71|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-7&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -3\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v42|nodeg}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-2\\\\-4&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -4\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v81|node}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-1\\\\-8&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -4\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|v33|nodeg}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-3\\\\-3&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n| -5\n| -\n|\n|- align=center\n!\n|colspan=2|{{Dynkin|nodeg|vab|nodeg}}\n|\n|<math>\\left [\\begin{smallmatrix}2&-b\\\\-a&2\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ]</math>\n|4-ab<0\n| -\n|-\n|colspan=8|\nNote<sup>1</sup>: For hyperbolic groups, (a<sub>12</sub>*a<sub>21</sub>>4), the multiedge style is abandoned in favor of an explicit labeling (a<sub>21</sub>, a<sub>12</sub>) on the edge.

groups are [[Lorentz group]]s, defined by adding three nodes to the finite groups. The E<sub>8</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub> offer six series ending as very-extended groups. Other extended series not shown can be defined from A<sub>n</sub>, B<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, and D<sub>n</sub>, as different series for each ''n''. The determinant of the associated [[Cartan matrix]] determine where the series changes from finite (positive) to affine (zero) to a noncompact hyperbolic group (negative), and ending as a Lorentz group that can be defined with the use of one [[time-like]] dimension, and is used in [[M theory]].<ref>[https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0304206v2.pdf The symmetry of M-theories], Francois Englert,

[[Engel's theorem]] states that every finite-dimensional Engel algebra is nilpotent. {{harv|Cohn|1955}} gave  examples of a non-nilpotent Engel groups and algebras.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Cohn | first1=P.
