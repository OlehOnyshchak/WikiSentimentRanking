The lamellipodia of these keratinocytes allow them to move at speeds of 10–20&nbsp;μm&nbsp;/&nbsp;min over [[epithelium|epithelial]] surfaces. When separated from the main part of a cell, a lamellipodium can still crawl about freely on its own.\n \nLamellipodia are a characteristic feature at the front, leading edge, of motile cells. They are believed to be the actual motor which pulls the cell forward during the process of [[cell migration]]. The tip of the lamellipodium is the site where [[exocytosis]] occurs in migrating mammalian cells as part of their [[clathrin]]-mediated [[endocytic cycle]]. This, together with actin-polymerisation there, helps extend the lamella forward and thus advance the cell's front. It thus acts as a steering device for cells in the process of [[chemotaxis]]. It is also the site from which particles or aggregates attached to the cell surface migrate in a process known as [[cap formation]].\n\n;Structure\nStructurally, the barbed ends of the microfilaments (localized actin [[monomer]]s in an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-bound form) face the \"seeking\" edge of the cell, while the pointed ends (localized actin monomers in an [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]]-bound form) face the lamella behind.<ref name=\"Cramer\">{{cite journal |last=Cramer |first=Louise P. |year=1997 |title=Molecular mechanism of actin-dependent retrograde flow in lamellipodia of motile cells |journal=[[Frontiers in Bioscience]] |volume=2 |issue= 4|pages=d260–270 |url=http://www.fbsserver.org/1997/v2/d/cramer/cramer.pdf |pmid=9206973 |doi=10.2741/a189}}</ref> This creates [[treadmilling]] throughout the lamellipodium, which aids in the retrograde flow of particles throughout.<ref name=\"Cramer\"/> [[Arp2/3 complex]]es are present at microfilament-microfilament junctions in lamellipodia, and help create the actin meshwork.

They convert chemical energy into mechanical work by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. [[flagellum|Flagellar]] [[rotation]], however, is powered by a [[proton pump]].{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Cellular functions ==\n\nThe best prominent example of a motor protein is the [[muscle]] protein [[myosin]] which \"motors\" the contraction of muscle fibers in animals. Motor proteins are the driving force behind most [[active transport]] of [[protein]]s and [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. [[Kinesin]]s and [[dyneins#Structure|cytoplasmic dyneins]] play essential roles in intracellular transport such as [[axoplasmic transport|axonal transport]] and in the formation of the [[spindle apparatus]] and the separation of the [[chromosome]]s during [[mitosis]] and [[meiosis]]. Axonemal dynein, found in [[cilia]] and [[flagella]], is crucial to [[cell motility]], for example in [[spermatozoa]], and fluid transport, for example in trachea.\n\n== Diseases associated with motor protein defects ==\n\nThe importance of motor proteins in cells becomes evident when they fail to fulfill their function. For example, [[kinesin]] deficiencies have been identified as the cause for [[Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease]] and some [[kidney disease]]s. Dynein deficiencies can lead to [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] [[infection]]s of the [[respiratory tract]] as [[cilia]] fail to function without dynein. Numerous myosin deficiencies are related to disease states and genetic syndromes. Because [[myosin]] II is essential for muscle contraction, defects in muscular myosin predictably cause myopathies. Because myosin are necessary for the process of hearing through their contribution to the structure of stereocilia, defects in unconventional myosin can lead to [[Usher syndrome]] and non-syndromic [[deafness]].<ref name=\"Hirokawa\">{{cite journal |vauthors= Hirokawa N, Takamura R |title= Biochemical and molecular characterization of diseases linked to motor proteins |journal= Trends in Biochemical Sciences |date= 2003 |volume= 28 |pages = 558–65 |pmid= 14559185 |doi= 10.1016/j.tibs.2003.08.006 |issue= 10}}</ref>\n\n== Cytoskeletal motor proteins ==\n\nMotor proteins utilizing the [[cytoskeleton]] for movement falls into two categories based on their substrates: Actin motors such as myosin move along [[microfilament]]s through interaction with [[actin]]. Microtubule motors such as dynein and kinesin movement along [[microtubule]]s through interaction with [[tubulin]]. There are two basic types of microtubule motors: plus-end motors and minus-end motors, depending on the direction in which they \"walk\" along the microtubule cables within the cell.\n\n=== Actin motors ===\n\n==== Myosin ====\n[[Myosin]]s are a [[Protein superfamily|superfamily]] of [[actin]] motor proteins that convert chemical energy in the form of ATP to mechanical energy, thus generating force and movement. The first identified myosin, myosin II, is responsible for generating [[muscle contraction]]. Myosin II is an elongated protein that is formed from two heavy chains with motor heads and two light chains. Each myosin head contains actin and ATP binding site. The myosin heads bind and hydrolyze ATP, which provides the energy to walk toward the plus end of an actin filament. Myosin II are also vital in the process of [[cell division]]. For example, non-muscle myosin II bipolar thick filaments provide the force of contraction needed to divide the cell into two daughter cells during cytokinesis. In addition to myosin II, many other myosin types are responsible for variety of movement of non-muscle cells. For example, myosin is involved in intracellular organization and the protrusion of actin-rich structures at the cell surface. Myosin V is involved in vesicle and organelle transport.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Molecular Motors|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26888/|date = 2002-01-01|first = Bruce|last = Alberts|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Johnson|first3 = Julian|last3 = Lewis|first4 = Martin|last4 = Raff|first5 = Keith|last5 = Roberts|first6 = Peter|last6 = Walter}}</ref> Myosin XI are involved in [[cytoplasmic streaming]], wherein movement along [[microfilament]] networks in the cell allows [[organelle]]s and [[cytoplasm]] to stream in a particular direction.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The myosin superfamily at a glance|journal = Journal of Cell Science|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 1477-9137|pmc = 3346823|pmid = 22566666|pages = 1627–32|volume = 125|issue = Pt 7|doi = 10.1242/jcs.094300|first = M.

Types of muscle are [[striated muscle tissue|striated muscle]] (such as [[skeletal striated muscle|skeletal muscle]] and [[cardiac muscle]]), obliquely striated muscle (found in some [[invertebrate]]s), and [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscle]]. Various arrangements of myofilaments create different muscles. Striated muscle has transverse bands of filaments. In obliquely striated muscle, the filaments are staggered. Smooth muscle has irregular arrangements of filaments.\n\n==Structure==\nThere are three different types of myofilaments: thick, thin, and elastic filaments.\n*Thick filaments consist primarily of the protein [[myosin]]. Each thick filament is approximately 15&nbsp;nm in diameter, and each is made of several hundred molecules of myosin.  A myosin molecule is shaped like a golf club, with a tail formed of two intertwined chains and a double globular head projecting from it at an angle.  Half of the myosin heads angle to the left and half of them angle to the right, creating an area in the middle of the filament known as the bare zone.\n*Thin filaments, 7&nbsp;nm in diameter, consist primarily of the protein [[actin]], specifically fibrous (F) actin. Each F actin strand is composed of a string of subunits called globular (G) actin.  Each G actin has an active site that can bind to the head of a myosin molecule.  Each thin filament also has approximately 40 to 60 molecules of tropomyosin, the protein that blocks the active sites of the thin filaments when the muscle is relaxed.  Each tropomyosin molecule has a smaller calcium-binding protein called troponin bound to it.  All thin filaments are attached to the [[sarcomere|Z-line]].\n*Elastic filaments, 1&nbsp;nm in diameter, are made of [[titin]], a large springy protein. They run through the core of each thick filament and anchor it to the Z-line, the end point of a [[sarcomere]].  Titin also stabilizes the thick filament, while centering it between the thin filaments.  It also aids in preventing overstretching of the thick filament, recoiling like a spring whenever a muscle is stretched.<ref>http://connect.mheducation.com/connect/hmEBook.do?setTab=sectionTabs</ref>\n\n==Function==\nThe protein complex composed of actin myosin, contractile proteins, is sometimes referred to as \"[[actomyosin]]\". In [[striated muscle]], such as [[skeletal muscle|skeletal]] and [[cardiac muscle]], the actin and myosin filaments each have a specific and constant length in the order of a few micrometers, far less than the length of the elongated muscle [[cell (biology)|cell]] (a few millimeters in the case of human skeletal [[muscle]] cells). The filaments are organized into repeated subunits along the length of the myofibril. These subunits are called [[sarcomere]]s.\n\nThe contractile nature of this protein complex is based on the structure of the thick and thin filaments. The thick filament, [[myosin]], has a double-headed structure, with the heads positioned at opposite ends of the molecule. During muscle contraction, the heads of the myosin filaments attach to oppositely oriented thin filaments, [[actin]], and pull them past one another. The action of myosin attachment and actin movement results in sarcomere shortening. Muscle contraction consists of the simultaneous shortening of multiple sarcomeres.<ref>Alberts, Bruce., et al., \"Muscle Contraction.\" Essential Cell Biology. 3rd. New York: Garland Science, 2010. p. 599. Print.</ref>\n\nWhat follows is a summary of muscle fiber contraction and relaxation,<ref>Shier, David., et al., \"Muscular System\", Hole's Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology. 9th. McGraw Hill, 2006. p. 175. Print.</ref>\n\n===Muscle fiber contraction===\n#The axon terminal of a motor neuron releases the [[neurotransmitter]], [[acetylcholine]].\n#Acetylcholine diffuses across the [[synaptic cleft]] and binds to the muscle fiber membrane.\n#This depolarizes the muscle fiber membrane, and the impulse travels to the muscle's [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] via the transverse tubules.\n#[[Calcium]] ions are then released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the [[sarcoplasm]] and subsequently bind to [[troponin]].\n#Troponin and the associated [[tropomyosin]] undergo a conformational change after calcium binding and expose the [[myosin]] binding sites on [[actin]], the thin filament.\n#The filaments of actin and myosin then form linkages.\n#After binding, myosin pulls actin filaments toward each other, or inward.\n#Thus muscle contraction occurs, and the sarcomere shortens as this process takes place.\n\n===Muscle fiber relaxation===\n#The [[enzyme]] [[acetylcholinesterase]] breaks down acetylcholine and this ceases muscle fiber stimulation.\n#Active transport moves calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fiber.\n#[[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] causes the binding between actin and myosin filaments to break.\n#Troponin and tropomyosin revert to their original conformation and thereby block binding sites on the actin filament.\n#The muscle fiber relaxes and the entire sarcomere lengthens.\n#The muscle fiber is now prepared for the next contraction.\n\n===Response to exercise===\nThe changes that occur to the myofilament in response to exercise have long been a subject of interest to exercise physiologists and the athletes who depend on their research for the most advanced training techniques. Athletes across a spectrum of sporting events are particularly interested to know what type of training protocol will result in maximal force generation from a muscle or set of muscles, so much attention has been given to changes in the myofilament under bouts of chronic and acute forms of exercise.\n\nWhile the exact mechanism of myofilament alteration in response to exercise is still being studied in mammals, some interesting clues have been revealed in [[Thoroughbred]] race horses. Researchers studied the presence of mRNA in skeletal muscle of horses at three distinct times; immediately before training, immediately after training, and four hours after training. They reported statistically significant differences in mRNA for genes specific to production of [[actin]]. This study provides evidence of the mechanisms for both immediate and delayed myofilament response to exercise at the molecular level.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=McGivney BA, Eivers SS, MacHugh DE, etal |title=Transcriptional adaptations following exercise in thoroughbred horse skeletal muscle highlights molecular mechanisms that lead to muscle hypertrophy |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10 |issue= |pages=638 |year=2009 |pmid=20042072 |pmc=2812474 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-638 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/638}}</ref>\n\nMore recently, myofilament protein changes have been studied in humans in response to resistance training. Again, researchers are not completely clear about the molecular mechanisms of change, and an alteration of fiber-type composition in the myofilament may not be the answer many athletes have long assumed.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Erskine RM, Jones DA, Maffulli N, Williams AG, Stewart CE, Degens H |title=What causes in vivo muscle specific tension to increase following resistance training? |journal=Exp. Physiol. |volume=96 |issue=2 |pages=145–55 |date=February 2011 |pmid=20889606 |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2010.053975 |url=http://ep.physoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=20889606}}</ref>  This study looked at the muscle specific tension in the quadriceps femoris and vastus lateralis of forty-two young men. Researchers report a 17% increase in specific muscle tension after a period of resistance training, despite a decrease in the presence of MyHC, myosin heavy-chain. This study concludes that there is no clear relationship between fiber-type composition and in vivo muscle tension, nor was there evidence of myofilament packing in the trained muscles.\n\n==Research==\nOther promising areas of research that may illumine the exact molecular nature of exercise-induced protein remodeling in muscle may be the study of related proteins involved with cell architecture, such as [[desmin]] and [[dystrophin]]. These proteins are thought to provide the cellular scaffolding necessary for the actin-myosin complex to undergo contraction. Research on desmin revealed that its presence increased greatly in a test group exposed to resistance training, while there was no evidence of desmin increase with endurance training. According to this study, there was no detectable increase in dystrophin in resistance or endurance training.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Parcell AC, Woolstenhulme MT, Sawyer RD |title=Structural protein alterations to resistance and endurance cycling exercise training |journal=J Strength Cond Res |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=359–65 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19209072 |doi=10.1519/JSC.0b013e318198fd62 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1064-8011&volume=23&issue=2&spage=359}}</ref>  It may be that exercise-induced myofilament alterations involve more than the contractile proteins actin & myosin.\n\nWhile the research on muscle fiber remodeling is on-going, there are generally accepted facts about the myofilament from the American College of Sports Medicine.<ref>Gore, Jessica. \"Muscle Growth in Bodybuilders\". http://Livestrong.com. June 2010.</ref>  It is thought that an increase in muscle strength is due to an increase in muscle fiber size, not an increase in number of muscle fibers and myofilaments. However, there is some evidence of animal satellite cells differentiating into new muscle fibers and not merely providing a support function to muscle cells.\n\nThe weakened contractile function of skeletal muscle is also linked to the state of the myofibrils.  Recent studies suggest that these conditions are associated with altered single fiber performance due to decreased expression of myofilament proteins and/or changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge interactions. Furthermore, cellular and myofilament-level adaptations are related to diminished whole muscle and whole body performance.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 4176476 | pmid=25309456 | doi=10.3389/fphys.2014.00369 | volume=5 | title=Skeletal muscle myofilament adaptations to aging, disease, and disuse and their effects on whole muscle performance in older adult humans | year=2014 | journal=Front Physiol | pages=369 |vauthors=Miller MS, Callahan DM, Toth MJ }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* Muscle :: Diversity of Muscle—Britannica Online Encyclopedia.\" Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia.

It is the repeating unit between two Z lines. [[Skeletal striated muscle|Skeletal muscles]] are composed of tubular muscle cells ([[myocytes]] called '''muscle fibers''' or '''myofibers''') which are formed in a process known as [[myogenesis]]. Muscle fibers contain numerous tubular [[myofibrils]]. Myofibrils are composed of repeating sections of sarcomeres, which appear under the microscope as alternating dark and light bands. Sarcomeres are composed of long, fibrous proteins as filaments that slide past each other when a muscle contracts or relaxes.\n\nTwo of the important proteins are [[myosin]], which forms the thick filament, and [[actin]], which forms the thin filament. Myosin has a long, fibrous tail and a globular head, which binds to actin. The myosin head also binds to [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which is the source of energy for muscle movement. Myosin can only bind to actin when the binding sites on actin are exposed by calcium ions.\n\nActin molecules are bound to the Z line, which forms the borders of the sarcomere.

In electron micrographs of cross-striated muscle, the '''Z-line''' (from the [[German language|German]] \"Zwischenscheibe\", the disc ''in between'' the I bands) appears as a series of dark lines. They act as an anchoring point of the [[actin]] filaments.\n* Surrounding the Z-line is the region of the '''I-band''' (for ''[[isotropic]]''). I-band is the zone of thin filaments that is not superimposed by thick filaments (myosin).\n* Following the I-band is the '''A-band''' (for ''[[anisotropic]]'').  Named for their properties under a polarizing [[microscope]]. An A-band contains the entire length of a single thick filament. The Anisotropic band contains both thick and thin filaments. \n* Within the A-band is a paler region called the '''H-zone''' (from the German \"heller\", ''brighter''). Named for their lighter appearance under a polarization [[microscope]]. H-band is the zone of the thick filaments that has no actin.\n* Within the H-zone is a thin '''M-line''' (from the German \"Mittelscheibe\", the disc in the ''middle'' of the sarcomere) formed of cross-connecting elements of the cytoskeleton.\n\nThe relationship between the proteins and the regions of the sarcomere are as follows:\n* ''Actin'' filaments, the thin filaments, are the major component of the I-band and extend into the A-band.\n* ''Myosin'' filaments, the thick filaments, are bipolar and extend throughout the A-band.  They are cross-linked at the centre by the M-band.\n* The giant protein ''[[titin]]'' (connectin) extends from the Z-line of the sarcomere, where it binds to the thick filament (myosin) system, to the M-band, where it is thought to interact with the thick filaments. Titin (and its splice isoforms) is the biggest single highly elasticated protein found in nature. It provides binding sites for numerous proteins and is thought to play an important role as sarcomeric ruler and as blueprint for the assembly of the sarcomere.\n* Another giant protein, [[nebulin]], is hypothesised to extend along the thin filaments and the entire I-Band. Similar to titin, it is thought to act as a molecular ruler along for thin filament assembly.\n* Several proteins important for the stability of the sarcomeric structure are found in the Z-line as well as in the M-band of the sarcomere.\n* Actin filaments and titin molecules are cross-linked in the Z-disc via the Z-line protein alpha-actinin.\n* The M-band proteins [[myomesin]] as well as C-protein crosslink the thick filament system (myosins) and the M-band part of titin (the elastic filaments).\n*The M-line also binds creatine kinase, which facilitates the reaction of ADP and phosphocreatine into ATP and creatine.\n* The interaction between actin and myosin filaments in the A-band of the sarcomere is responsible for the [[muscle contraction]] (sliding filament model).<ref name=\"Campbell\"/>\n\n==Contraction==\n{{main|Muscle contraction}}\n\nUpon muscle contraction, the A-bands do not change their length (1.85 micrometer in mammalian skeletal muscle),<ref name=Lieber>Skeletal Muscle Structure, Function, and Plasticity: The Physiological Basis of Rehabilitation. Lieber, 2002.  {{ISBN|978-0781730617}}</ref> whereas the I-bands and the H-zone shorten. This causes the Z lines to come closer together.\n\nThe protein [tropomyosin] covers the myosin binding sites of the actin molecules in the muscle cell.  To allow the muscle cell to contract, tropomyosin must be moved to uncover the binding sites on the actin.  Calcium ions bind with troponin-C molecules (which are dispersed throughout the tropomyosin protein) and alter the structure of the tropomyosin, forcing it to reveal the cross-bridge binding site on the actin.\n\nThe concentration of calcium within muscle cells is controlled by the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]], a unique form of [[endoplasmic reticulum]] in the [[sarcoplasm]].  Muscle contraction ends when calcium ions are pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, allowing the contractile apparatus and, thus, muscle cell to relax.\n\nDuring stimulation of the muscle cell, the motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]], which travels across the neuromuscular junction (the synapse between the terminal bouton of the neuron and the muscle cell).  [[Acetylcholine]] binds to a post-synaptic [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]. A change in the receptor conformation allows an influx of [[sodium]] ions and initiation of a post-synaptic action potential. The [[action potential]] then travels along T (transverse) tubules until it reaches the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Here, the depolarized membrane activates voltage-gated L-type calcium channels, present in the plasma membrane. The L-type calcium channels are in close association with ryanodine receptors present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The inward flow of calcium from the L-type calcium channels activate ryanodine receptors to release calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This mechanism is called calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). It is not understood whether the physical opening of the L-type calcium channels or the presence of calcium causes the ryanodine receptors to open. The outflow of calcium allows the myosin heads access to the actin cross-bridge binding sites, permitting muscle contraction.<ref name=Lieber />\n\n==Rest==\nAt rest, the myosin head is bound to an [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule in a low-energy configuration and is unable to access the cross-bridge binding sites on the actin.  However, the myosin head can hydrolyze ATP into [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and an inorganic phosphate ion.  A portion of the energy released in this reaction changes the shape of the myosin head and promotes it to a high-energy configuration.  Through the process of binding to the actin, the myosin head releases ADP and an inorganic phosphate ion, changing its configuration back to one of low energy.  The myosin remains attached to actin in a state known as ''rigor'', until a new ATP binds the myosin head. This binding of ATP to myosin releases the actin by cross-bridge dissociation. The ATP-associated myosin is ready for another cycle, beginning with hydrolysis of the ATP.\n\nThe A-band is visible as dark transverse lines across myofibers; the I-band is visible as lightly staining transverse lines, and the Z-line is visible as dark lines separating sarcomeres at the light-microscope level.\n\n==Storage==\nMost muscle cells store enough ATP for only a small number of muscle contractions.  While muscle cells also store [[glycogen]], most of the energy required for contraction is derived from phosphagens.  One such [[phosphagen]], [[creatine phosphate]], is used to provide ADP with a phosphate group for ATP synthesis in [[vertebrates]].<ref name=Lieber />\n\n==Comparative structure==\nThe structure of the sarcomere affects its function in several ways.  The overlap of actin and myosin gives rise to the [[Muscle contraction#Force-length and force-velocity relationships|length-tension curve]], which shows how sarcomere [[Force (physics)|force]] output decreases if the muscle is stretched so that fewer cross-bridges can form or compressed until actin filaments interfere with each other.  Length of the actin and myosin filaments (taken together as sarcomere length) affects force and velocity – longer sarcomeres have more cross-bridges and thus more force, but have a reduced range of shortening.  Vertebrates display a very limited range of sarcomere lengths, with roughly the same optimal length (length at peak length-tension) in all muscles of an individual as well as between species.  [[Arthropods]], however, show tremendous variation (over seven-fold) in sarcomere length, both between species and between muscles in a single individual.  The reasons for the lack of substantial sarcomere variability in vertebrates is not fully known.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Sarcomeres}}\n*[http://www.mechanobio.info/modules/go-0000146#2_go-0000146 MBInfo: Sarcomere]\n*[http://www.mechanobio.info/topics/cytoskeleton-dynamics/go-0043292 MBInfo: Contractile Fiber]\n*[https://www.kasem.info/histology-videos/first-year-histology-videos/muscular-tissue-videos Muscular Tissues Videos]\n*{{BUHistology|21601ooa}} - \"Ultrastructure of the Cell: sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle\"\n* {{MedicalMnemonics|50|379|107|}}\n*[http://www.antibodypatterns.com/skm.php Images created by antibody to striations]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071015045959/http://www.club150kg-dc.fr/Decouv_Dc/Contenu/Biomeca_Frameset(uk).htm Muscle Contraction for dummies]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTb0NHKMJjA Model representation of the sarcomere]\n\n{{Muscle tissue}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n[[Category:Cell movement]]\n[[Category:Muscular system]]"

Each heavy chain has a globular motor domain with a doughnut-shaped structure believed to resemble that of other [[AAA proteins]],  a coiled coil \"stalk\" that binds to the microtubule, and an extended tail (or \"stem\") that attaches to a neighboring microtubule of the same [[axoneme]]. Each dynein molecule thus forms a cross-bridge between two adjacent microtubules of the ciliary axoneme. During the \"power stroke\", which causes movement, the AAA ATPase motor domain undergoes a conformational change that causes the microtubule-binding stalk to pivot relative to the cargo-binding tail with the result that one microtubule slides relative to the other (Karp, 2005).  This sliding produces the bending movement needed for cilia to beat and propel the cell or other particles.  Groups of dynein molecules responsible for movement in opposite directions are probably activated and inactivated in a coordinated fashion so that the cilia or flagella can move back and forth. The [[radial spoke]] has been proposed as the (or one of the) structures that synchronizes this movement.\n\nThe regulation of axonemal dynein activity is critical for flagellar beat frequency and cilia waveform. Modes of axonemal dynein regulation include phosphorylation, redox, and calcium. Mechanical forces on the axoneme also affect anoxemal dynein function. The heavy chains of inner and outer arms of axonemal dynein are phosphorylated/dephosphorylated to control the rate of microtubule sliding.

      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}\nThe '''Kinesin-13 Family''' are a subfamily of [[motor proteins]] known as [[kinesin]]s. Most kinesins transport materials or cargo around the cell while traversing along [[microtubule]] [[polymer]] tracks with the help of [[ATP hydrolysis|ATP-hydrolysis]]-created energy.\n\n==Structure==\nThey are easily identified by their three typical structural components including a highly conserved structural domain, catalytic core, and microtubule binding sites. The kinesin-13 family, unlike other kinesins, has an internally positioned motor domain. They were initially named KIF-M because of the unique location of their catalytic core in the middle of the [[polypeptide]] between the [[N-terminal]] globular domain and the [[C-terminal]] stalk but they are truly special due to their versatile nature. The Kinesin-13 family's molecular mechanism is less understood than other classes of kinesins which have their motor domains at one end of the molecule or the other. They are capable of traveling to both the minus and plus ends of [[microtubules]] whereas most motors are unidirectional. Thus they can catalytically [[polymerization|depolymerize]] a microtubule from both ends making it a very efficient process.\n\nThe exact mechanism of Kinesin-13 activated microtubule depolymerization remains unclear, however, recent biochemical and structural studies revealed some more detailed class specific features enabling researchers to formulate a model.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ogawa T, Nitta R, Okada Y, Hirokawa N | title = A common mechanism for microtubule destabilizers-M type kinesins stabilize curling of the protofilament using the class-specific neck and loops | journal = Cell | volume = 116 | issue = 4 | pages = 591–602 | date = Feb 2004 | pmid = 14980225 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(04)00129-1 }}</ref>) The protein first contacts the side wall of a microtubule. This is not a stable interaction because the convex surface of the catalytic core does not fit to the flat surface of the straight microtubule [[protofilament]]. Steric hindrance between the molecule neck and adjacent protofilament further inhibits full contact between protein and the microtubule and only facilitates one-dimensional [[diffusion]] along the microtubule. At this time, The protein's [[nucleotide binding pocket]] is trapped in an open state so that the structure is not [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzing]] ATP. Once the motor reaches the end of the microtubule, the protofilament spontaneously curves itself allowing motor to make full contact with the [[tubulin]] [[Protein subunit|subunit]]. More MCAK molecules collectively bind to the curved region supporting the theory that they do not actively peel away the microtubule but they wait patiently for it to adopt this curved conformation. They stabilize the curved conformation by binding to the end of the microtubule and then catalyze depolymerization.\n\n==Functions during mitosis==\nThe major function of mitosis is to separate replicated [[sister chromatids]], and this is accomplished in part during [[anaphase]] A when \"kinetochore microtubules (or kMTs)\" that link the sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles shorten by depolymerization, exerting forces on the chromatids that pull them to the poles. In ''[[Drosophila]]'' there is evidence that sister chromatids are moved to opposite spindle poles by a \"kinesin-13 dependent pacman-flux mechanism\" in which one kinesin-13 isoform, KLP59c, localized to kinetochores facilitates the depolymerization of the end of the kMTs facing the chromatid (pacman), whereas a second kinesin-13 isoform, KLP10A, localized on the spindle poles facilitates the depolymerization of the opposite end of the kMTs facing the poles (flux) <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers GC, Rogers SL, Schwimmer TA, Ems-McClung SC, Walczak CE, Vale RD, Scholey JM, Sharp DJ | title = Two mitotic kinesins cooperate to drive sister chromatid separation during anaphase | journal = Nature | volume = 427 | issue = 6972 | pages = 364–70 | date = Jan 2004 | pmid = 14681690 | doi = 10.1038/nature02256 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[KIF13A]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://download.cell.com/supplementarydata/cell/116/4/591/DC1/index.htm Video Illustrations]\n\n[[Category:Motor proteins]]"

The neck domain can also serve as a binding site for myosin ''light chains'' which are distinct proteins that form part of a macromolecular complex and generally have regulatory functions.\n* The ''tail domain'' generally mediates interaction with cargo molecules and/or other myosin [[protein subunits|subunit]]s. In some cases, the tail domain may play a role in regulating motor activity.\n\n===Power stroke===\n{{Main|Muscle contraction}}\n\nMultiple myosin II molecules generate force in [[muscle contraction|skeletal muscle]] through a power stroke mechanism fuelled by the energy released from ATP hydrolysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyska MJ, Warshaw DM | title = The myosin power stroke | journal = Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton | volume = 51 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11810692 | doi = 10.1002/cm.10014 }}</ref> The power stroke occurs at the release of phosphate from the myosin molecule after the ATP hydrolysis while myosin is tightly bound to actin.

The combined effect of the myriad power strokes causes the muscle to contract.\n\n== Nomenclature, evolution, and the family tree ==\n[[File:MyosinUnrootedTree.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2.2|Myosin unrooted [[phylogenetic tree]]]]\n\nThe wide variety of myosin genes found throughout the eukaryotic phyla were named according to different schemes as they were discovered.  The nomenclature can therefore be somewhat confusing when attempting to compare the functions of myosin proteins within and between organisms.\n\nSkeletal muscle myosin, the most conspicuous of the myosin superfamily due to its abundance in [[muscle fibers]], was the first to be discovered. This protein makes up part of the sarcomere and forms macromolecular filaments composed of multiple myosin subunits. Similar filament-forming myosin proteins were found in cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and nonmuscle cells. However, beginning in the 1970s, researchers began to discover new myosin genes in simple eukaryotes<ref name=\"Pollard and Korn, 1973\"/> encoding proteins that acted as monomers and were therefore entitled Class I myosins. These new myosins were collectively termed \"unconventional myosins\"<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheney RE, Mooseker MS | title = Unconventional myosins | journal = Current Opinion in Cell Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–35 | date = February 1992 | pmid = 1558751 | doi = 10.1016/0955-0674(92)90055-H }}</ref> and have been found in many tissues other than muscle.

Presumably this is so the myosins may interact, via their tails, with a large number of different cargoes, while the goal in each case – to move along actin filaments – remains the same and therefore requires the same machinery in the motor. For example, the [[human genome]] contains over 40 different myosin [[genes]].\n\nThese differences in shape also determine the speed at which myosins can move along actin filaments. The hydrolysis of ATP and the subsequent release of the [[phosphate]] group causes the \"power stroke,\" in which the \"lever arm\" or \"neck\" region of the heavy chain is dragged forward. Since the power stroke always moves the lever arm by the same angle, the length of the lever arm determines the displacement of the cargo relative to the actin filament.   A longer lever arm will cause the cargo to traverse a greater distance even though the lever arm undergoes the same angular displacement – just as a person with longer legs can move farther with each individual step.  The velocity of a myosin motor depends upon the rate at which it passes through a complete kinetic cycle of ATP binding to the release of ADP.\n\n===Myosin classes===\n\n====Myosin I====\nMyosin I, a ubiquitous cellular protein, functions  as monomer and functions in [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] transport.<ref>{{cite web| first = Sutherland | last = Macive | name-list-format = vanc |title=Myosin I |url=http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/Myosin%20I.htm |date=June 4, 2003 |access-date=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070602100321/http://www.bms.ed.ac.uk/research/others/smaciver/Myosin%20I.htm |archive-date=June 2, 2007 |df= }}</ref> It has step size of 10&nbsp;nm and has been implicated as being responsible for the adaptation response of the stereocilia in the inner ear.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Batters C, Arthur CP, Lin A, Porter J, Geeves MA, Milligan RA, Molloy JE, Coluccio LM | title = Myo1c is designed for the adaptation response in the inner ear | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 7 | pages = 1433–40 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15014434 | pmc = 391074 | doi = 10.1038/sj.emboj.7600169 }}</ref>\n\n====Myosin II====\n[[File:Sarcomere.svg|thumb|350px|[[Sliding filament model]] of muscle contraction.]]\nMyosin II (also known as conventional myosin) is the myosin type responsible for producing [[muscle contraction]] in [[muscle cell]]s in most animal cell types.

MLCs contain two Ca<sup>2+</sup> - binding EF-hand motifs. MLCs isoforms  modulate the Ca<sup>2+</sup>of force transduction and cross-bridge kinetics.  \n\nMyosin light chains (MLCs) can be broadly classified into two groups:  \n\n* Essential or alkali MLC (MLC1 or ELC),   \n\n* Regulatory MLC (MLC2 or RLC).  \n\nEssential and regulatory MLCs have molecular masses of 22 and 19 kDa, respectively. Structurally, MLC2 contains a serine residue that is lacking in MLC1. The presence of this amino acids allows the regulation of the conformational changes (from compacted to an elongated form) by a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated phosphorylation mechanism. MLC1, in contrast with MLC2, has a N-terminal sequence able to bind actin, contributing to force production.  \n\nMLCs are structurally and functionally distinct from myosin heavy chains (MHCs). Nevertheless, the association of MLCs with the neck region of MHCs is necessary for the assembly of the macromolecular complexes that result in the functional motor protein, myosin. The interaction of MLCs with the α-helical neck region of MHC molecule stabilizes the complex .   \n\n== Genes in mammalians ==\nTo this day, eight genes encoding for MLCs in mammalians have been described; several isoforms have also been characterized.

Four transcript variants that produce four isoforms of the calcium/calmodulin dependent enzyme have been identified as well as two transcripts that produce two isoforms of telokin. The two transcrips that produce the two telokin isoforms are the following:\n\n; Isoform 7: This variant encodes the shorter isoform of kinase related protein, telokin. The first exon corresponds to intron 30 and there mainder of the transcript corresponds to the last two exons of the gene. It is shorter than variant 8 by one codon at the splicing junction between the first two exons. It is made by 153 aa.

It does, however, contain two cysteine amino acid residues (Cys63 and Cys115) that are situated at structurally identical positions to those forming the disulfide linkage in the immunoglobulin constant domain.\n;Secondary structure: Telokin contains 154 amino acid residues, 103 of which were visible in the electron density map. Telokin  and  the  C-terminal  domain  of MLCK  show amino acid sequence similarity to several quite unrelated muscle proteins such as [[titin]] or [[Protein C|C-protein]].<ref name=\"Sobieszek_1997\" /> The overall molecular fold of telokin consists of seven strands of antiparallel beta-pleated sheet that wrap around to form a barrel. There is also an extended tail of eight amino acid residues at the N terminus that does not participate in [[Beta sheet|beta-sheet]] formation. The [[Beta barrel|beta-barrel]] can be simply envisioned as two layers of beta-sheet, nearly parallel to one another, with one layer containing four and the other three beta-strands.\n;Domains: Telokin has a particular domain called Ig-like I-type (Immunoglobulin like intermediate type) with a length of 92 residues between 42 and 133. At the beginning it was thought that this domain was Ig- like C2-type but some studies determined that its structure shares characteristics from V-set and C2-set and that is why the a I-type was invented. These kind of domains mediates T-cell adhesion via its ectodomain, and signal transduction.[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/1tlk?europe_pmc_bio_extredirect_Protein_Structures=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe-srv/view/entry/1tlk/summary]\n\n== Tissue distribution ==\n\nKRP presence in different tissues has been assessed by immunoblots using anti-KRP [[Antibody|antibodies]], and by analyses of its mRNA in Northern blot.<ref name=\"Shirinsky_18993\"/><ref name=\"Gallagher_Herring_1991\"/><ref name=\"Collinge_1992\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Collinge M, Matrisian PE, Zimmer WE, Shattuck RL, Lukas TJ, Van Eldik LJ, Watterson DM | title = Structure and expression of a calcium-binding protein gene contained within a calmodulin-regulated protein kinase gene | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 2359–71 | date = May 1992 | pmid = 1373815 | pmc = 364408 | doi =  10.1128/mcb.12.5.2359}}</ref> KRP is an abundant smooth muscles-pecific protein.

First, telokin stabilizes myosin filaments  in the presence of [[ATPase|ATP]]. Second, telokin can modulate the level of myosin light chain phosphorylation. In this latter role, multiple mechanisms have been suggested. One hypothesis is that light chain phosphorylation is diminished by the direct competition of KRP and [[Myosin light-chain kinase|MLCK]] for myosin, resulting in a loss of contraction.<ref name=\"Shirinsky_18993\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shirinsky VP, Vorotnikov AV, Birukov KG, Nanaev AK, Collinge M, Lukas TJ, Sellers JR, Watterson DM | title = A kinase-related protein stabilizes unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin minifilaments in the presence of ATP | journal = J.

However,  When telokin was phosphorylated by [[Myosin light-chain kinase|MLCK]], the telokin-induced inhibition of myosin phosphorylation was removed,  which  indicates  the  existence  of  a  telokin-dependent modulatory pathway in smooth-muscle regulation. In this part we must say that the [[phosphorylation]] of telokin can be enhanced by the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and calmodulin.\n\nKinase-related protein (telokin) binds to dephosphorylated smooth myosin near the junction between the rod and the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] head region (S-I). This interaction is prevented by [[Myosin light-chain kinase|MLCK]]-catalysed [[phosphorylation]] of myosin and conversely, the rate of myosin [[phosphorylation]] is in turn inhibited by KRP in vitro.<ref name=\"Shirinsky_18993\" /> As a consequence of this, in vivo KRP might slow down the rate of myosin phosphorylation by [[Myosin light-chain kinase|myosin light chain kinase]] (MLCK) and, therefore, tension development. When the intracellular Ca2+ level is decreasing, the KRP can also accelerate muscle relaxation by lowering the ratio of phosphorylated to phosphorylated myosin.  KRP is also an important structural regulator of myosin filaments. [[Smooth muscle tissue|Smooth muscle myosin]], under physiological conditions in vitro, can adapt two relatively and different stable conformations. When the myosin is in the extended conformation, it is active and able to combine with other myosin molecules to form thick filaments which are fundamental for effective contraction. Upon [[ATPase|ATP]] binding, the rod part of unphosphorylated myosin molecule folds into thirds, so that the head –rod junction is brought close to the middle of the rod and stabilized there, presumable by interacting with both the 20 KDa light chains and the neck region. This interaction is prevented by the MLCK-dependent light chain [[phosphorylation]], resulting in the unfolding of myosin monomers and their rapid [[polymerization]] into filaments.\n\nThe binding of KRP to the neck region folded, [[ATPase|ATP]]-bound dephosphorylated myosin also promotes unfolding and filament formation, thus looking like light chain phosphorylation.  This could be a physiologically significant phenomenon considering the high concentration of [[ATPase|ATP]] always present in smooth muscle cells. Thus, Kinase-related protein may have a very important role in relaxed smooth muscle by keeping dephosphorylated [[myosin]] in the filamentous state ready for the next rapid contractile response. Experiments aimed at testing this hypothesis indicated that under appropriate conditions a small excess of KRP is enough to form an [[Equimolar counterdiffusion|equimolar]] complex with smooth muscle myosin and to cause its complete polymerization in the presence of [[ATPase|ATP]]. Experiments where it has been tested this hypothesis, indicated that in appropriated conditions, a small excess of KRP is enough to form an equimolar complex with smooth muscle myosin and in the presence of [[ATPase|ATP]], cause its complete [[polymerization]].<ref name=\"Vorotnikov_1997\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Vorotnikov AV | title = Kinase-related protein: a smooth muscle myosin-binding protein | journal = Int.

If the organism moves towards the stimulus the taxis is positive, while if it moves away the taxis is negative. For example, flagellate [[protozoa]]ns of the genus ''[[Euglena]]'' move towards a light source. This reaction or behaviour is called ''positive phototaxis'', since phototaxis refers to a response to light and the organism is moving towards the stimulus.\n\nMany types of taxis have been identified, including:\n* ''aerotaxis'' (stimulation by [[oxygen]])\n* ''anemotaxis'' (by [[wind]])\n* ''barotaxis'' (by [[pressure]])\n* ''[[chemotaxis]]'' (by [[chemical]]s)\n* ''[[durotaxis]]'' (by [[stiffness]])\n* ''electrotaxis'' or ''galvanotaxis'' (by [[electric current]])\n* ''[[gravitaxis]]'' (by [[gravity]])\n* ''hydrotaxis'' (by [[moisture]])\n* ''[[magnetotaxis]]'' (by [[magnetic field]])\n* ''[[phototaxis]]'' (by [[light]])\n* ''[[rheotaxis]]'' (by [[fluid flow]])\n* ''[[thermotaxis]]'' (by changes in [[temperature]])\n* ''thigmotaxis'' (by [[Somatosensory system|physical contact]])\n\nDepending on the type of [[sensory organ]]s present, a taxis can be classified as a ''klinotaxis'', where an organism continuously samples the environment to determine the direction of a stimulus; a ''tropotaxis'', where bilateral sense organs are used to determine the stimulus direction; and a ''telotaxis'', where a single organ suffices to establish the orientation of stimulus.\n\n== Examples ==\n<!--Alphabetical:-->\n\n* Aerotaxis is the response of an organism to variation in oxygen concentration, and is mainly found in aerobic bacteria.<ref name=Martin1983>{{Cite book|editor=Martin, E.A.|year=1983|title=Macmillan Dictionary of Life Sciences| edition=2nd| page=362 |place=London |publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=0-333-34867-2|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref>\n* Anemotaxis is the response of an organism to wind.

A concentration gradient of chemicals developed in a fluid phase guides the vectorial movement of responder cells or organisms. Inducers of locomotion towards increasing steps of concentrations are considered as [[chemoattractant]]s, while [[chemorepellent]]s result moving off the chemical. Chemotaxis is described in [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] and [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells, but signalling mechanisms (receptors, intracellular signaling) and effectors are significantly different.\n* [[Durotaxis]] is the directional movement of a cell along a stiffness gradient.\n* Electrotaxis (or galvanotaxis) is the directional movement of motile cells along the vector of an [[electric field]]. It has been suggested that by detecting and orienting themselves toward the electric fields, cells can move towards damages or wounds to repair them. It also is suggested that such a movement may contribute to directional growth of cells and tissues during development and regeneration. This notion is based on the existence of measurable electric fields that naturally occur during wound healing, development and regeneration; and cells in cultures respond to applied electric fields by directional cell migration – electrotaxis&nbsp;/ galvanotaxis.\n* Energy taxis is the orientation of bacteria towards conditions of optimal metabolic activity by sensing the internal energetic conditions of cell. Therefore, in contrast to chemotaxis (taxis towards or away from a specific extracellular compound), energy taxis responds on an intracellular stimulus (e.g. [[proton motive force]], activity of [[NADH dehydrogenase|NDH- 1]]) and requires metabolic activity.<ref>Schweinitzer T, Josenhans C.

Many [[phytoflagellate]]s, e.g. ''[[Euglena]]'', and the [[chloroplast]]s of higher plants positively phototactic, moving towards a light source.<ref name=Martin1983/> Two types of positive phototaxis are observed in prokaryotes: scotophototaxis is observable as the movement of a bacterium out of the area illuminated by a microscope, when entering darkness signals the cell to reverse direction and reenter the light; a second type of positive phototaxis is true phototaxis, which is a directed movement up a gradient to an increasing amount of light.\n* [[Rheotaxis]] is a response to a [[Fluid dynamics|current]] in a fluid. Positive rheotaxis is shown by fish turning to face against the current. In a flowing stream, this behaviour leads them to hold their position in a stream rather than being swept downstream. Some fish will exhibit negative rheotaxis where they will avoid currents.\n* [[Thermotaxis]] is a migration along a gradient of temperature.

The cells for reception are located all over the body, particularly towards the anterior side. The organisms detect the [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] by turning their head sideways and compare the intensity. When the intensity of stimuli is balanced equally from all sides then the organisms move in a straight line. The movement of [[Calliphoridae|blowfly]] and [[butterfly]] [[larva]]e clearly demonstrates klinotaxis.\n* ''Tropotaxis'' is displayed by [[organism]]s with paired receptor cells. When the stimuli coming from a source are balanced equally the organisms show movement. Because of this, animals are able to move sideways, unlike klinotaxis where the organisms can move only in a straight line. The movement of [[Grayling (butterfly)|grayling butterflies]] and [[fish louse|fish lice]] clearly demonstrates tropotaxis.\n* ''Telotaxis'' requires paired receptors. The movement occurs along the direction where the intensity of the stimuli is stronger. Telotaxis is clearly seen in the movement of [[bee]]s when they leave their [[Beehive|hive]] to look for food. They balance the stimuli from the sun as well as from [[flower]]s but land on the flower whose stimulus is most intense for them.\n* ''Menotaxis'' describes organisms' maintenance of a constant [[Orientation (geometry)|angular orientation]]. A clear demonstration is shown by bees returning to their hive at night and the movement of ants with respect to the sun.\n* ''Mnemotaxis'' is the use of [[memory]] to follow trails that organisms have left when travelling to or from their home.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Animal locomotion]]\n* [[Haptotaxis]]\n* [[Mechanotaxis]]\n* [[Optomotor response]]\n* [[Tropism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.olfacts.nl/repL/JIP88.pdf Host-plant finding by insects: orientation, sensory input and search patterns]\n\n{{Taxes (Biology)}}\n\n[[Category:Taxes (biology)| ]]\n[[Category:Cell biology]]"

Modification of endogenous chemotactic ability of these microorganisms by pharmaceutical agents can decrease or inhibit the ratio of infections or spreading of infectious diseases.\nApart from infections, there are some other diseases wherein impaired chemotaxis is the primary etiological factor, as in [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], where giant intracellular vesicles inhibit normal migration of cells.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ '''Chemotaxis in diseases'''{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n!

This difference in rigidity is a result of the qualitative and quantitative biochemical properties of the ECM or in other words, the concentration and categories of the various macromolecules that form the ECM meshwork. Though the ECM is composed of many intracellularly-synthesized components - including a number of [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs) and fibrous [[proteins]] such as [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], [[collagen]], and [[elastin]] - it is the latter two fibers that are most influential in defining the mechanical properties of the ECM.\n\nCollagen is the fibrous [[protein]] that gives the ECM its [[tensile strength]], or rigidity.

Magnetosomes contain crystals - often magnetite (Fe3O4). Some extremophile bacteria from sulfurous environments have been isolated with greigite (an iron-sulfide compound Fe3S4) <ref name=\"five\" />. These crystals are contained within a bilayer membrane called the magnetosome membrane which is embedded with specific proteins. There are many different shapes of crystals however, crystal shape is usually consistent within a bacterial species <ref name=\"three\" />. Most common arrangement of magnetosomes is in chains which allows a maximum [[magnetic dipole]] moment to be created <ref name=\"one\" />. Within bacteria, there can be many chains of magnetosomes of different lengths that tend to align along the long axis of bacterial cell <ref name=\"two\" />. The dipole moment created from the chains of magnetosomes allows the bacteria to align with the magnetic field as they move <ref name=\"one\" />. \n\nBy orienting towards the Earth's poles, marine bacteria are able to direct their movement downwards, towards the anaerobic/micro aerobic sediments. In the northern hemisphere, north seeking bacteria move downwards while in the southern hemisphere, south seeking bacteria dominate and move downwards. It was originally thought by scientists that south seeking bacteria would move upwards in the north hemisphere, towards very high concentrations of oxygen, and will be negatively selected for so that north seeking bacteria dominate in the northern hemisphere and vice versa. However, south seeking bacteria have been found in the northern hemisphere. Also, magnetic bacteria, both north and south seeking, are found even at the Earth's magnetic equator, where the field is directed horizontally.

This looks like a change from positive to negative phototaxis (see video left), but the larvae also swim down if UV-light comes non-directionally from the side.

Positive phototaxis (swimming to the light from the surface) and positive gravitaxis (swimming to the center of gravity) are induced by different ranges of wavelengths and cancel out each other at a certain ratio of wavelengths.<ref name=\"Veraszto2018\" /> Since the wavelengths compositions change in water with depth: Short (UV, violet) and long (red) wavelengths are lost first,<ref name=Guehmann2015 /> phototaxis and gravitaxis form a ratio-chromatic [[depth gauge]], which allows the larvae to determine their depth by the color of the surrounding water.

      "text": "{{more inline|date=December 2014}}\nIn mathematics, '''differential inclusions''' are a generalization of the concept of [[ordinary differential equation]] of the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\\in F(t,x(t)), </math>\n\nwhere ''F'' is a [[multivalued function|multivalued map]], i.e. ''F''(''t'', ''x'') is a ''set'' rather than a single point in <math>\\scriptstyle{\\mathbb R}^d</math>.  Differential inclusions arise in many situations including [[differential variational inequality|differential variational inequalities]], [[projected dynamical system]]s, dynamic [[Coulomb friction]] problems and [[fuzzy set]] arithmetic.\n\nFor example, the basic rule for Coulomb friction is that the friction force has magnitude ''μN'' in the direction opposite to the direction of slip, where ''N'' is the normal force and ''μ'' is a constant (the friction coefficient). However, if the slip is zero, the friction force can be ''any'' force in the correct plane with magnitude smaller than or equal to ''μN''  Thus, writing the friction force as a function of position and velocity leads to a set-valued function.\n\n==Theory==\n\nExistence theory usually assumes that ''F''(''t'',&nbsp;''x'') is an [[hemicontinuous|upper hemicontinuous]] function of ''x'', measurable in ''t'', and that ''F''(''t'',&nbsp;''x'') is a closed, convex set for all ''t'' and ''x''. \nExistence of solutions for the initial value problem\n\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\\in F(t,x(t)), \\quad x(t_0)=x_0</math>\n\nfor a sufficiently small time interval [''t''<sub>0</sub>,&nbsp;''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''ε''), ''ε''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 then follows.\nGlobal existence can be shown provided ''F'' does not allow \"blow-up\" (<math>\\scriptstyle \\Vert x(t)\\Vert\\,\\to\\,\\infty</math> as <math>\\scriptstyle t\\,\\to\\, t^*</math> for a finite <math>\\scriptstyle t^*</math>).\n\nExistence theory for differential inclusions with non-convex ''F''(''t'',&nbsp;''x'') is an active area of research.\n\nUniqueness of solutions usually requires other conditions.  \nFor example, suppose <math>F(t,x)</math> satisfies a [[Lipschitz continuity#One-sided Lipschitz|one-sided Lipschitz condition]]:\n\n:<math>(x_1-x_2)^T(F(t,x_1)-F(t,x_2))\\leq C\\Vert x_1-x_2\\Vert^2</math>\n\nfor some ''C'' for all ''x''<sub>1</sub> and ''x''<sub>2</sub>.  Then the initial value problem\n\n:<math>\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)\\in F(t,x(t)), \\quad x(t_0)=x_0</math>\n\nhas a unique solution.\n\nThis is closely related to the theory of '''maximal monotone operators''', as developed by Minty and [[Haïm Brezis]].\n\n[[Aleksei Fedorovich Filippov|Filippov]]'s theory only allows for discontinuities in the derivative <math>\\frac{dx}{dt}(t)</math>, but allows no discontinuities in the state, i.e. <math>x(t)</math> need be continuous. [[Michelle Schatzman|Schatzman]] and later [[Jean-Jacques Moreau|Moreau]] (who gave it the currently accepted name) extended the notion to ''measure differential inclusion'' (MDI) in which the inclusion is evaluated by taking the [[limit from above]] for <math>x(t)</math>.<ref name=\"Stewart2011\">{{cite book|author=David E.

An important contribution has been made by A. F. Filippov, who studied regularizations of discontinuous equations.

In particular, the so-called [[mountain pass theorem]] he established with [[Paul Rabinowitz]] is nowadays a classical tool in the context of nonlinear analysis problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Caccioppoli prize citation|url=http://umi.dm.unibo.it/caccioppoli/vincitori-en.html#1982|publisher=Italian Mathematical Union|accessdate=June 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Mountain Pass Theorem|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uGWaffeFbroC&printsec=frontcover&dq=mountain+pass+Youssef+Jabri|publisher=Cambridge|accessdate=June 2, 2013|isbn=9781139440813|date=2003-09-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Dual variational methods in critical point theory and applications|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022123673900517|journal=Journal of Functional Analysis|accessdate=June 2, 2013|doi=10.1016/0022-1236(73)90051-7|volume=14|issue=4|pages=349–381|year=1973|last1=Ambrosetti|first1=Antonio|last2=Rabinowitz|first2=Paul H.}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\nAmbrosetti has been awarded the [[Caccioppoli Prize|Caccioppoli prize]] in 1982, and the [[Amerio Prize]] by the Istituto Lombardo Accademia di Scienze e Lettere in 2008.

His first interest was [[linguistics]], then he studied physics with [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Helmholtz]], but experimental work did not attract him, so he decided on mathematics in 1878. The years 1878–1881 were spent studying under [[Elwin Christoffel]] and [[Theodor Reye]] at Strasbourg, [[Hermann Schwarz]] at Göttingen, and particularly [[Karl Weierstrass]] in Berlin.<ref>Cooke, Roger and Rickey, V.

Part III.'', page 30, [[American Mathematical Society]], {{ISBN|0-8218-0130-9}}</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1888 he landed in [[Hoboken, NJ]], searching for a job in the United States: he succeeded in finding a position in 1889 at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and then at the then newly founded [[Clark University]].<ref name=\"bliss1\">According to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=480}}.</ref> In 1892 Bolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] and worked there up to 1910 when, after becoming unhappy in the United States as a consequence of the death of his friend [[Heinrich Maschke]] in 1908, he and his wife returned to [[Freiburg]] in Germany. The events of [[World War I]] greatly affected Bolza and, after 1914, he stopped his research in mathematics. He became interested in religious psychology, languages (particularly [[Sanskrit]]), and Indian religions. He published the book ''Glaubenlose Religion'' (religion without belief) in 1930 under the pseudonym F. H. Marneck. However, later in his life he returned to do research in mathematics, lecturing at [[University of Freiburg]] from 1929 up to his retirement in 1933.\n\n===Academic career===\nHe completed his doctoral studies, after eight years of study and many changes of direction, in 1886, from the [[Georg-August-Universität Göttingen]]. He wrote his thesis, titled ''Über die Reduction hyperelliptischer Integrale erster Ordnung und erster Gattung auf elliptische, insbesondere über die Reduction durch eine Transformation vierten Grades'' (translated as ''On reduction of hyperelliptic integrals of first order and first kind to elliptic integrals, especially on reduction by transformation of fourth degree''<ref>See the full text of his thesis {{harv|Bolza|1886}}.</ref>) under the supervision of [[Felix Klein]].\n\nIn 1889 Bolza worked at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where [[Simon Newcomb]] gave him a temporary short-term appointment \"[[Reader (academic rank)|reader in mathematics]]\", then he obtained a position as an [[associate professor]] at [[Clark University]].<ref name=\"bliss1\"/> While at Clark, Bolza published the important paper ''On the theory of substitution groups and its application to algebraic equations'' in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]]. In 1892 Bolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] and worked there up to 1910, when he decided to return to [[Freiburg]] in Germany: he was appointed there as honorary professor,<ref>Precisely \"''Ordentlicher Honorar Professor''\", according to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=481}}.</ref> while the University Chicago awarded him the title of \"''non-resident professor of mathematics''\" which he retained for the rest of his life.<ref>According to {{harvtxt|Bliss|1944|p=481}}.</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Research activity===\nBolza published ''The elliptic s-functions considered as a special case of the hyperelliptic s-functions'' in 1900 which related to work he had been studying for his doctorate under Klein. However, he worked on the calculus of variations from 1901. Papers which appeared in the [[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] over the next few years were: ''New proof of a theorem of Osgood's in the calculus of variations'' (1901); ''Proof of the sufficiency of Jacobi's condition for a permanent sign of the second variation in the so-called isoperimetric problems'' (1902); ''Weierstrass' theorem and Kneser's theorem on transversals for the most general case of an extremum of a simple definite integral'' (1906); and ''Existence proof for a field of extremals tangent to a given curve'' (1907). His text ''Lectures on the Calculus of Variations'' published by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in 1904,<ref>See reference {{harv|Bolza|1904}}.</ref> became a classic in its field and was republished several times: the augmented German edition of the same work<ref>See reference {{harv|Bolza|1909}}.</ref> was considered by his former student [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]] \"''a classic, indispensable to every scholar in the field, and much wider in its scope than his earlier book''\".<ref>See {{harv|Bliss|1944|p=484}}.</ref>\n\nImmediately after his return to Germany Bolza continued teaching and research, in particular on function theory, integral equations and the calculus of variations. Two papers of 1913 and 1914 are particularly important. The first ''Problem mit gemischten Bedingungen und variablen Endpunkten'' formulated a new type of variational problem now called \"''the Bolza problem of Bolza''\" after him and the second studied variations for an integral problem involving inequalities. This latter work was to become important in control theory. Bolza returned to Chicago for part of 1913 giving lecturers during the summer on function theory and integral equations.\n\n===Teaching activity===\nBolza joined the [[University of Chicago]] in 1892. Between 1892 and 1910 the mathematics department was outstandingly successful with thirty-nine students graduating with doctorates (nine of them students of Bolza). These included [[Leonard Dickson]], who was the first to be awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics by the University of Chicago, [[Gilbert Bliss]], [[Oswald Veblen]], [[Robert Lee Moore]], [[George D.

He was a close associate of [[David H. Bailey (mathematician)|David H. Bailey]], and they have been prominent public advocates of [[experimental mathematics]]. Indeed, Borwein is arguably the father of the field known as experimental mathematics.\n\n==Contributions== \nBorwein's interests spanned [[pure mathematics]] (analysis), [[applied mathematics]] (optimization), [[computational mathematics]] (numerical and computational analysis), and high performance computing. He authored ten books (most recently [http://www.expmath.info several on Experimental Mathematics] and a [[monograph]]  on [https://web.archive.org/web/20100922081636/http://projects.cs.dal.ca/ddrive/ConvexFunctions/ convex functions], and over 400 refereed articles. He was a co-founder (1995) of a software company [http://www.mathresources.com  MathResources], consulting and producing interactive software primarily for school and university mathematics. For almost ten years before his death, Borwein was completely unaffiliated with MathResources.\n\nBorwein was also an expert on the number [[pi]] and especially its [http://numbers.computation.free.fr/Constants/Pi/pi.html computation].\n\n==Education and career==\nBorwein was born in [[St. Andrews]], Scotland in 1951, and received his B.A. (Honours Math) from [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1971, and his [[D.Phil.]] from [[Oxford University]] in 1974 as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] at [[Jesus College, Oxford|Jesus College]].\n\nPrior to joining [[Simon Fraser University]] in 1993, he worked at [[Dalhousie University]] (1974&ndash;91), [[Carnegie-Mellon]] (1980&ndash;82) and the [[University of Waterloo]] (1991&ndash;93).\nHe was Shrum Professor of Science (1993&ndash;2003) and a [[Canada Research Chair]] in Information Technology (2001&ndash;08) at [[Simon Fraser University]], where he was founding Director of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and developed the [[Inverse Symbolic Calculator]] together with his brother and [[Simon Plouffe]]. In 2004, he (re-)joined the Faculty of Computer Science at [[Dalhousie University]] as a Canada Research Chair in Distributed and Collaborative Research, cross-appointed in Mathematics, while preserving an adjunct appointment at Simon Fraser.\n \n==Service==\nBorwein was Governor at large of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] (2004&ndash;07), was president of the [[Canadian Mathematical Society]] (2000&ndash;02) and chair of (the Canadian National Science Library) NRC-[[CISTI]] Advisory Board (2000&ndash;2003). He served as chair of various of [[NATO]]'s scientific programs. He was also Chair of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the [http://www.amsi.org.au Australian Mathematical Sciences Institute] (AMSI). He chaired the Canadian HPC consortium, now [https://www.computecanada.ca/ Compute Canada]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} and the [[International Mathematical Union]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20050826082649/http://www.ceic.math.ca/ Committee on Electronic Information and Communications] (2002&ndash;2008).\n\n==Recognition==\nHe has received various awards including the [[Chauvenet Prize]] (1993), Fellowship in the [[Royal Society of Canada]] (1994), Fellowship in the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (2002), an honorary degree from [[Limoges]] (1999), and foreign membership in the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] (2003).

He made significant contributions to the [[real analysis|theory of functions of a real variable]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]]. His work also includes important results in [[conformal mapping|conformal representations]] and in the theory of boundary correspondence. In 1909, Carathéodory pioneered the ''Axiomatic Formulation of Thermodynamics'' along a purely geometrical approach.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Caratheodory Constantin and Stephanos.JPG|left|thumb|180px|Constantin Caratheodory with his father.]]\n\nConstantin Carathéodory was born in [[Berlin]] to [[Greeks|Greek]] parents and grew up in [[Brussels]]. His father Stephanos, a lawyer,  served as the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] ambassador to [[Belgium]], [[St. Petersburg]] and Berlin. His mother, Despina, née Petrokokkinos, was from the island of [[Chios]]. The Carathéodory family, originally from [[Bosnochori]] or [[Vyssa]], was well established and respected in [[Constantinople]], and its members held many important governmental positions.\n\nThe Carathéodory family spent 1874–75 in Constantinople (now Istanbul), where Constantin's paternal grandfather lived, while his father Stephanos was on leave. Then in 1875 they went to Brussels when Stephanos was appointed there as Ottoman Ambassador. In Brussels, Constantin's younger sister Julia was born. The year 1879 was a tragic one for the family since Constantin's paternal grandfather died in that year, but much more tragically, Constantin's mother Despina died of [[pneumonia]] in [[Cannes]]. Constantin's maternal grandmother took on the task of bringing up Constantin and Julia in his father's home in Belgium. They employed a German maid who taught the children to speak German. Constantin was already bilingual in French and Greek by this time.\n\nConstantin began his formal schooling at a private school in Vanderstock in 1881. He left after two years and then spent time with his father on a visit to Berlin, and also spent the winters of 1883–84 and 1884–85 on the [[Italian Riviera]]. Back in Brussels in 1885 he attended a grammar school for a year where he first began to become interested in mathematics. In 1886, he entered the high school Athénée Royal d'Ixelles and studied there until his graduation in 1891. Twice during his time at this school Constantin won a prize as the best mathematics student in Belgium.\n\n[[Image:Caratheodory family.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) pictured sitting with his father, brother in law and sister, Carlsbad 1898]]\n\nAt this stage Carathéodory began training as a military engineer. He attended the École Militaire de Belgique from October 1891 to May 1895 and he also studied at the École d'Application from 1893 to 1896. In 1897 [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a war broke out]] between Ottoman Empire and Greece. This put Carathéodory in a difficult position since he sided with the Greeks, yet his father served the government of the Ottoman Empire. Since he was a trained engineer he was offered a job in the British colonial service. This job took him to Egypt where he worked on the construction of the [[Assiut]] dam until April 1900. During periods when construction work had to stop due to floods, he studied mathematics from some textbooks he had with him, such as [[Camille Jordan|Jordan's]] ''Cours d'Analyse'' and Salmon's text on the analytic geometry of [[conic sections]]. He also visited the [[Pyramid of Cheops|Cheops pyramid]] and made measurements which he wrote up and published in 1901<ref>Brussells 1901 (Hayez);Ges. math. Schr. V. 273-281</ref>. He also published a book on Egypt in the same year which contained a wealth of information on the history and geography of the country. <ref>H Aigyptos, Syllogos Ophelimon Biblion, no 14, 118 pp Athens 1901, 1928, New York 1920</ref>\n\n== Studies and university career ==\nCarathéodory studied engineering in [[Belgium]] at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], where he was considered a charismatic and brilliant student.\n\n===University career===\n\n* 1900  Studies at [[University of Berlin]].\n* 1902  Completed graduation at [[University of Göttingen]] (1904 Ph.D, 1905 Habilitation)\n* 1908  Dozent at [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]\n* 1909  Ordinary Professor at [[University of Hannover|Hannover Technical High School]].\n* 1910  Ordinary Professor at [[Wrocław University of Technology|Breslau Technical High School]].\n* 1913  Professor following Klein at [[University of Göttingen]].\n* 1919  Professor at [[University of Berlin]]\n* 1919  Elected to [[Prussian Academy of Science]].\n* 1920  University Dean at [[Ionian University of Smyrna]] (later, [[University of the Aegean]]).\n* 1922  Professor at [[University of Athens]].\n* 1922  Professor at [[Athens Polytechnic]].\n* 1924  Professor following Lindemann at [[University of Munich]].\n* 1938  Retirement from Professorship. Continued working from Bavarian Academy of Science\n\n===Doctoral students===\nCarathéodory had about 20 doctoral students among these being [[Hans Rademacher]], known for his work on analysis and number theory, and [[Paul Finsler]] known for his creation of [[Finsler space]].\n\n===Academic contacts in Germany===\nCarathéodory's contacts in Germany were many and included such famous names as: [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein|Klein]], [[Einstein]], [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz|Schwarz]], [[Lipót Fejér|Fejér]]. During the difficult period of World War II his close associates at the Bavarian Academy of Sciences were Perron and Tietze.\n\n===Academic contacts in Greece===\nWhile in Germany Carathéodory retained numerous links with the Greek academic world about which detailed information may be found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at Gŏttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carathéodory helped the Greek topologist [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]] take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carathéodory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.<ref>J P Christianidis & N Kastanis: ''In memoriam Evangelos S Stamatis (1898–1990) Historia Mathematica 19 (1992) 99-105''</ref>\n\n== Works ==\n[[File:Caratheodorys theorem example.png|thumb|200px|An illustration of [[Carathéodory's theorem (convex hull)]] for a square in '''R'''<sup>2</sup>.]]\n[[Image:Caratheodory and Fejér.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory (left) with Hungarian mathematician [[Lipót Fejér]] (1880–1959) (standing to the right).]]\n\n===Calculus of variations===\nIn his doctoral dissertation Carathéodory originated his method based on the use of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation]] to construct a field of extremals. The ideas are closely related to light propagation in optics. The method became known as ''the royal road to the calculus of variations''.<ref>H. Boerner, ''Carathéodory und die Variationsrechnung'', in A Panayotopolos (ed.), Proceedings of C. Carathéodory International Symposium, September 1973, Athens (Athens, 1974), 80–90.</ref> More recently the same idea has been taken into the theory of [[optimal control]].<ref>[[Richard Bellman|Bellman]] for his ''Dynamic programming'' in its continuous-time form used Carathéodory's work in the form of the [[Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation]]. [[Rudolf E. Kálmán|Kálmán]] also explicitly used Carathéodory's formulation in his initial papers on optimal control. See e.g. R. E. Kalman: ''Contributions to the theory of optimal control''. Boletin de la Sociedad Matematica Mexicana 1960</ref> The method can also be extended to multiple integrals.\n\n===Real analysis===\nHe proved an [[Carathéodory's existence theorem|existence theorem]] for the  solution to ordinary differential equations under mild regularity conditions.\n\n===Theory of measure===\nHe is credited with the [[Carathéodory extension theorem]] which is fundamental to modern measure theory. Later Carathéodory extended the theory from sets to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.\n\n===Theory of functions of a complex variable===\nHe greatly extended the theory of [[conformal transformation]]<ref>A. Shields: ''Carathéodory and Conformal Mapping'' Math. Intelligencer vol.10(1), 1988</ref> proving his [[Carathéodory's theorem (conformal mapping)|theorem]] about the extension of conformal mapping to the boundary of Jordan domains.  In studying boundary correspondence he originated the theory of [[prime end]]s.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nIn 1909, Carathéodory published a pioneering work \"Investigations on the Foundations of Thermodynamics\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Carathéodory|first=Constantin|title=Untersuchungen ueber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik|trans-title=Examination of the foundations of Thermodynamics| journal=[[Mathematische Annalen]]|volume=67|issue=3|year=1909|pages=355–386|doi=10.1007/bf01450409|translator-last=Delphinich|translator-first=D. H.|url=http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/caratheodory_-_thermodynamics.pdf}}</ref> in which he formulated the [[Laws of Thermodynamics]] axiomatically. It has been said{{according to whom|date=January 2014}} that he was using only mechanical concepts and the theory of [[Johann Friedrich Pfaff|Pfaff']]<nowiki/>s differential forms. But in reality he also relied heavily on the concept of an [[adiabatic process]]. The physical meaning of the term adiabatic rests on the concepts of [[heat]] and [[temperature]]. Thus, in Bailyn's survey of thermodynamics, Carathéodory's approach is called \"mechanical\", as distinct from \"thermodynamic\".<ref>Bailyn, M. (1994). ''A Survey of Thermodynamics'', American Institute of Physics, Woodbury NY, {{isbn|0-88318-797-3}}.</ref> Carathéodory's \"first axiomatically rigid foundation of thermodynamics\" was acclaimed by [[Max Born]]<ref>Max Born: ''The Born–Einstein Letters'', MacMillan 1971</ref> but criticized by [[Max Planck]].<ref>[http://web.ist.utl.pt/ist12219/data/68.pdf Constantin Carathéodory and the axiomatic thermodynamics]'' by Lionello Pogliani and Mario N. Berberan-Santos</ref>\n\nIn his theory he simplified the basic concepts, for instance ''heat'' is not an essential concept but a derived one. He formulated the axiomatic principle of irreversibility in thermodynamics stating that inaccessibility of states is related to the existence of entropy, where temperature is the integration function. The [[Second Law of Thermodynamics]] was expressed via the following axiom: \"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\" In this connexion he coined the term [[adiabatic accessibility]].<ref>adiabatic accessibility = [[:de:Adiabatische Erreichbarkeit|adiabatische Erreichbarkeit]]; see also Elliott H. Lieb, Jakob Yngvason: [http://de.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9708200 ''The Physics and Mathematics of the Second Law of Thermodynamics''], Phys. Rep. 310, 1–96 (1999) and Elliott H. Lieb, (editors: B.

In 1920 Carathéodory was appointed Dean of the University and took a major part in establishing the institution, touring Europe to buy books and equipment. The university however never actually admitted students due to the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|War in Asia Minor]] which ended in the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]]. Carathéodory managed to save books from the library and was only rescued at the last moment by a journalist who took him by rowing boat to the battleship Naxos which was standing by.<ref name=\"Constantin Carathéodory: His life and work\">{{cite web|url=http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Caratheodori-24grammata.com_.pdf |title=Constantin Carathéodory: His life and work(Essay)|publisher=National Technical University of Athens |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222123424/http://www.24grammata.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Caratheodori-24grammata.com_.pdf |archivedate=2017-12-22}}\"''His daughter Mrs Despina Rodopoulou – Carathéodory referred to this period: “He stayed to save anything he could: library, machines etc which were shipped in different ships hoping that one day they will arrive in Athens. My father stayed until the last moment. George Horton, consul of U.S.A. in Smyrni wrote a book... which was translated in Greek. In this book Horton notes: “One of the last Greek I saw on the streets of Smyrna before the entry of the Turks was Professor Carathéodory, president of the doomed University. With him departed the incarnation of Greek genious of culture and civilization on Orient.” ''\"</ref> Carathéodory brought to Athens some of the university library and stayed in Athens, teaching at the university and technical school until 1924.\n\nIn 1924 Carathéodory was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Munich, and held this position until retirement in 1938. He later worked from the Bavarian Academy of Sciences until his death in 1950.\n\nThe new Greek University in the broader area of the Southeast Mediterranean region, as originally envisioned by Carathéodory, finally materialised with the establishment of the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Brief History of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki\">{{cite web|url=https://www.auth.gr/en/history|title=Brief History|publisher=Aristotle University of Thessaloniki|accessdate=2012-12-02}}</ref>\n\n== Linguistic talent ==\nCarathéodory excelled at languages, much like many members of his family did. [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[French language|French]] were his first languages, and he mastered [[German language|German]] with such perfection, that his writings composed in the German language are stylistic masterworks.<ref>Denker, Forscher und Entdecker: eine Geschichte der Bayerischen Akademie\n By Dietmar Willoweit p.263</ref> Carathéodory also spoke and wrote [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and the [[ancient languages]] without any effort. Such an impressive linguistic arsenal enabled him to communicate and exchange ideas directly with other mathematicians during his numerous travels, and greatly extend his fields of knowledge.\n\nMuch more than that, Carathéodory was a treasured conversation partner for his fellow professors in the Munich Department of Philosophy. The well-respected, German [[philology|philologist]], professor of ancient languages Kurt von Fritz praised Carathéodory, saying that from him one could learn an endless amount about the old and new Greece, the old Greek language, and Hellenic mathematics. Fritz had numerous philosophical discussions with Carathéodory.\n\nThe Greek language was spoken exclusively in Carathéodory's house – his son Stephanos and daughter Despina went to a German high school, but they obtained daily additional instruction in Greek language and culture from a Greek priest. At home, they were not allowed to speak any other language.\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[Image:Caratheodory constantin.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Constantin Caratheodory at a mature age.]]\n\nIn 2002, in recognition of his achievements, the University of Munich named one of the largest lecture rooms in the mathematical institute the Constantin-Carathéodory Lecture Hall.\n<ref>[http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~fmwus/download/ausgabe07.pdf Constantin Carathéodory-Hörsaal], mathe-lmu, Nr. 7/2002, Hrsg.

He was honored for solving, in 1930, the [[Plateau problem|problem of Plateau]], which asks whether a minimal surface exists for a given boundary. The problem, open since 1760 when [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] raised it, is part of the [[calculus of variations]] and is also known as the ''[[soap bubble]] problem''. Douglas also made significant contributions to the [[inverse problem for Lagrangian mechanics|inverse problem of the calculus of variations]]. The [[American Mathematical Society]] awarded him the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] in 1943.\n\nDouglas later became a full professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY), where he taught until his death. At the time CCNY only offered undergraduate degrees and Professor Douglas taught the advanced calculus course.

The left-hand pane displays four sets, which are displayed in a two-by-two array. Each of the sets contains exactly two points, which are displayed in red. In each set, the two points are joined by a pink line-segment, which is the convex hull of the original set. Each set has exactly one point that is indicated with a plus-symbol. In the top row of the two-by-two array, the plus-symbol lies in the interior of the line segment; in the bottom row, the plus-symbol coincides with one of the red-points. This completes the description of the left-hand pane of the diagram. The right-hand pane displays the Minkowski sum of the sets, which is the union of the sums having exactly one point from each summand-set; for the displayed sets, the sixteen sums are distinct points, which are displayed in red: The right-hand red sum-points are the sums of the left-hand red summand-points. The convex hull of the sixteen red-points is shaded in pink. In the pink interior of the right-hand sumset lies exactly one plus-symbol, which is the (unique) sum of the plus-symbols from the right-hand side. Comparing the left array and the right pane, one confirms that the right-hand plus-symbol is indeed the sum of the four plus-symbols from the left-hand sets, precisely two points from the original non-convex summand-sets and two points from the convex hulls of the remaining summand-sets.|\n|Ivar Ekeland applied the [[Shapley–Folkman lemma]] to explain Claude Lemarechal's success with [[Lagrangian relaxation]] on non-convex minimization problems. This lemma concerns the [[Minkowski addition]] of four sets. The point (+) in the [[convex hull]] of the Minkowski sum of the four [[convex set|non-convex set]]s (''right'') is the sum of four points (+) from the (left-hand) sets—two points in two non-convex sets plus two points in the convex hulls of two sets.  The convex hulls are shaded pink. The original sets each have exactly two points (shown in red).]]\nEkeland explained the success of methods of convex minimization on large problems that appeared to be non-convex.  In many optimization problems, the [[optimization (mathematics)#objective function|objective function]]&nbsp;f are ''separable'', that is, the sum of ''many'' summand-functions each with its own argument:\n\n: <math> f(x) = f(x_1,\\dots,x_N) = \\sum_n f_n(x_n). </math>\n\nFor example, problems of [[linear programming|linear optimization]] are separable. For a separable problem, we consider an optimal solution\n\n: <math>x_\\min = (x_1,\\dots,x_N)_\\min</math>\n\nwith the minimum value&nbsp;{{nowrap|''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>).}}  For a separable problem, we consider an optimal solution  <big>(</big>''x''<sub>min</sub>,&nbsp;''f''(''x''<sub>min</sub>)<big>)</big>\nto the \"''convexified problem''\", where convex hulls are taken of the graphs of  the summand functions. Such an optimal solution is the [[limit of a sequence]] of points in the convexified problem\n\n: <math> (x_j, f(x_j)) \\in \\mathrm{Conv}(\\mathrm{Graph}(f_n)). \\,  </math><ref name=\"Ekeland76\"/><ref>\n\nThe [[limit of a sequence]] is a member of the [[closure (topology)|closure of the original set]], which is the smallest [[closed set]] that contains the original set.

The main novelty is in the fact that, for the first time, the regularity of minimizers is obtained using directly the minimality properties without appealing to [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the functionals, which in general is not supposed to exist in the cases considered. His work with [[Giuseppe Modica]] on the local higher integrability properties of solutions to elliptic systems has had an influence on the development of partial regularity theory.<ref>M.

He calculated the optimal distance between cars on ice, depending on thickness of ice and temperature of the air. In December 1941 and January 1942, Kantorovich personally walked between cars driving on the ice of Lake Ladoga, on the [[Road of Life]], to ensure the cars did not sink. However, many cars with food for survivors of the siege were destroyed by the [[Germans|German]] air-bombings. In 1948 Kantorovich was  assigned to the atomic project of the USSR.

His analysis proposed the [[Kantorovich metric]], which is used in [[probability theory]], in the theory of the [[Weak convergence of measures#Weak convergence of measures|weak convergence]] of [[probability measure]]s.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Kantorovich (Petrov-Vodkin).jpg|Portrait by [[Petrov-Vodkin]]. 1938.\nImage:Leonid Kantorovich 1976.jpg|1976\nFile:Espionage den04 40.png|Original CIA file on Kantorovich, seized from the former US Embassy in Tehran.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Russian mathematicians]]\n* [[List of economists]]\n* [[Shadow price]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Makarov | first1 = V. | year = 1987 | title = Kantorovich, Leonid Vitaliyevich | url = | journal = [[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics]] | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 14–15 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Kantorovich | first1 = L.V. | year = 1939 | title = Mathematical Methods of Organizing and Planning Production | journal = Management Science | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 366–422 | jstor=2627082}}\n* Kantorovich, L.V.

He has mainly worked on regularity aspects of the Calculus of Variations, solving a few longstanding questions about the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of the singular sets of minimisers of vectorial integral functionals and the boundary singularities of solutions to [[Elliptic partial differential equation|nonlinear elliptic systems]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Regularity of minima: an invitation to the Dark Side of the Calculus of Variations|url=http://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/134645/AplMat_51-2006-4_4.pdf|publisher=Applications of Mathematics|accessdate=May 6, 2013}}</ref> This connects to the work of authors as [[Frederick J. Almgren, Jr.|Almgren]], [[Ennio de Giorgi|De Giorgi]], [[Charles B. Morrey, Jr.|Morrey]], [[Enrico Giusti|Giusti]], who proved theorems asserting regularity of solutions outside a singular set (i.e. a closed subset of [[Null set|null measure]]) both in [[geometric measure theory]] and for variational systems of partial differential equations. These are indeed called partial regularity results and one of the main issues is to establish whether the dimension of the singular set is strictly less than the ambient dimension. This question has found a positive answer for general integral functionals, thanks to the work of Kristensen and Mingione, who have also given explicit estimates for the dimension of the singular sets of minimisers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The singular set of minima of integral functionals|journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis|volume=180|issue=3|pages=331–398|doi=10.1007/s00205-005-0402-5|year=2006|last1=Kristensen|first1=Jan|last2=Mingione|first2=Giuseppe}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=The singular set of Lipschitzian minima of multiple integrals|journal=Archive for Rational Mechanics and Analysis|volume=184|issue=2|pages=341–369|doi=10.1007/s00205-006-0036-2|year=2007|last1=Kristensen|first1=Jan|last2=Mingione|first2=Giuseppe}}</ref> Subsequently, Mingione has worked on nonlinear [[potential theory]] obtaining potential estimates for solutions to nonlinear elliptic and [[Parabolic partial differential equation|parabolic equations]].

The [[Morse–Palais lemma]], one of the key results in Morse theory, is named after him, as is the [[Thue–Morse sequence]], an infinite binary sequence with many applications. In 1933 he was awarded the [[Bôcher Memorial Prize]] for his work in mathematical analysis.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Waterville, Maine]] to Ella Phoebe Marston and Howard Calvin Morse in 1892. He received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Colby College]] (also in Waterville) in 1914. At [[Harvard University]], he received both his [[master's degree]] in 1915 and his [[Ph.D.]] in 1917.\n\nHe taught at Harvard, [[Brown University|Brown]], and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] Universities before accepting a position in 1935 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], where he remained until his retirement in 1962.\n\nHe spent most of his career on a single subject, titled Morse Theory, a branch of [[differential topology]].

He was a professor of mathematics at the University of Washington from 1962 until his death.\n\n==Biography==\nPhelps wrote his dissertation on [[reflexive space|subreflexive]] [[Banach space]]s under the supervision of [[Victor Klee]] in 1958 at the University of Washington.<ref name=\"MGP\" >{{MathGenealogy|id=28156}}</ref> Phelps was appointed to a position at Washington in 1962.<ref>[http://www.math.washington.edu/People/fac_individ.php?mathid=phelps University of Washington description of Phelps]</ref>\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]].<ref>[http://www.ams.org/profession/fellows-list List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society], retrieved 2013-05-05.</ref>\n\nHe was a convinced atheist.<ref>http://experimentalmath.info/blog/2013/02/in-memoriam-robert-r-phelps/</ref>\n \n==Research==\nWith [[Errett Bishop]], Phelps proved the [[Bishop–Phelps theorem]], one of the most important results in functional analysis, with applications to  [[operator theory]], to [[harmonic analysis]], to [[Choquet theory]], and to [[calculus of variations|variational analysis]]. In one field of its application, [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization theory]], [[Ivar Ekeland]] began his survey of [[variational principle]]s with this tribute: <blockquote>''The central result''. The grandfather of it all is the celebrated 1961 theorem of Bishop and Phelps ... that the set of continuous linear functionals on a Banach space ''E'' which attain their maximum on a prescribed closed convex bounded subset ''X''⊂''E'' is norm-dense in ''E''*. The crux of the proof lies in introducing a certain convex cone in ''E'', associating with it a partial ordering, and applying to the latter a transfinite induction argument (Zorn's lemma).<ref>{{harvtxt|Ekeland|1979|p=443}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPhelps has written several advanced monographs, which have been republished. His 1966 ''Lectures on Choquet theory'' was the first book to explain [[Choquet theory|the theory of integral representations]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Mathematical Reviews|last=Lacey|first=H.

In its preface, Phelps advised readers of the prerequisite \"background in functional analysis\": \"the main rule is the separation theorem (a.k.a. [also known as] the Hahn–Banach theorem): Like the standard advice given in mountaineering classes (concerning the all-important bowline for tying oneself into the end of the climbing rope), you should be able to employ it using only one hand while standing blindfolded in a cold shower.\"<ref>Page iii of the first (1989) edition of {{harvtxt|Phelps|1991}}.</ref> Phelps has been an avid rock-climber and mountaineer. Following the trailblazing research of [[Edgar Asplund|Asplund]] and [[R. Tyrrell Rockafellar|Rockafellar]], Phelps hammered into place the [[piton]]s, linked the [[carabiner]]s, and threaded the [[top roping|top rope]] by which novices have [[top roping|ascended]] from the frozen tundras of [[locally convex topological vector space|topological vector space]]s to the [[Shangri-La]] of [[Banach space]] theory.<!-- The prose is purple, but consider: Phelps climbs rocks, and refers to the Hahn Banach theorem as the \"bowline\" of functional analysis! --> His [[University College, London]] (UCL) lectures on the ''Differentiability of convex functions on Banach spaces'' (1977–1978) were \"widely distributed\".  Some of Phelps's results and exposition were developed in two books,<ref name=\"Nashed \"/> Bourgin's ''Geometric aspects of convex sets with the Radon-Nikodým property'' (1983) and  Giles's ''Convex analysis with application in the differentiation of convex functions'' (1982).<ref name=\"Bourgin\"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Giles|first=John R.|title=Convex analysis with application in the differentiation of convex functions|series=Research Notes in Mathematics|volume=58|publisher=Pitman (Advanced Publishing Program)|location=Boston, Mass.-London|year=1982|pages=x+278|isbn=0-273-08537-9|mr=650456|ref=harv}}</ref>  Phelps avoided repeating the results previously reported in Bourgin and Giles when he published his own ''Convex functions, monotone operators and differentiability'' (1989), which reported new results and streamlined proofs of earlier results.<ref name=\"Nashed\">{{harvtxt|Nashed|1990}}</ref> Now, the study of differentiability is a central concern in nonlinear functional analysis.<ref>[[Joram Lindenstrauss|Lindenstrauss, Joram]] and Benyamini, Yoav.

His doctoral dissertation was on the [[calculus of variations]] (in 1910, at the [[University of Vienna]]).\n\n== Life ==\nRadon<ref>Brigitte Bukovics: ''Biography of Johann Radon'', in: 75 Years of Radon Transform, S. Gindikin and P. Michor, eds., International Press Incorporated (1994), pp. 13–18, {{ISBN|1-57146-008-X}}</ref> was born in Tetschen, [[Bohemia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], now [[Děčín]], [[Czech Republic]]. He received his doctoral degree at the [[University of Vienna]] in 1910. He spent the winter semester 1910/11 at the [[University of Göttingen]], then he was an assistant at the [[German Technical University in Brno]], and from 1912 to 1919 at the [[Technical University of Vienna]]. In 1913/14, he passed his [[habilitation]] at the University of Vienna. Due to his near-sightedness, he was exempt from the draft during wartime.\n\nIn 1919, he was called to become [[Academic_ranks_in_Germany#Main_positions|Professor extraordinarius]] at the newly founded [[University of Hamburg]]; in 1922, he became ''[[Academic_ranks_in_Germany#Main_positions|Professor ordinarius]]'' at the [[University of Greifswald]], and in 1925 at the [[University of Erlangen]]. Then he was ''[[Academic_ranks_in_Germany#Main_positions|Ordinarius]]'' at the [[University of Breslau]] from 1928 to 1945.\n\nAfter a short stay at the [[University of Innsbruck]] he became ''Ordinarius'' at the Institute of Mathematics of the [[University of Vienna]] on 1 October 1946. In 1954/55, he was rector of the University of Vienna.\n\nIn 1939, Radon became corresponding member of the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]], and in 1947, he became a member. From 1952 to 1956, he was Secretary of the Class of Mathematics and Science of this Academy. From 1948 to 1950, he was president of the Austrian Mathematical Society.\n\nJohann Radon married Maria Rigele, a secondary school teacher, in 1916. They had three sons who died young or very young. Their daughter Brigitte, born in 1924, obtained a Ph.D. in mathematics at the [[University of Innsbruck]] and married the Austrian mathematician Erich Bukovics in 1950. Brigitte lives in Vienna.\n\nRadon, as Curt C. Christian described him in 1987 at the occasion of the unveiling of his brass bust at the [[University of Vienna]], was a friendly, good-natured man, highly esteemed by  students and colleagues alike, a noble personality. He did make the impression of a quiet scholar, but he was also sociable and willing to celebrate. He loved music, and he played music with friends at home, being an excellent violinist himself, and a good singer. His love for classical literature lasted through all his life.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] founded an Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics and named it after Johann Radon (see External link below).\n\n== Achievements ==\n\nRadon is known for a number of lasting contributions, including:\n* his part in the [[Radon–Nikodym theorem]];\n* the [[Radon measure]] concept of [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]] as [[linear functional]];\n* the [[Radon transform]], in [[integral geometry]], based on integration over [[hyperplane]]s — with application to [[tomography]] for [[3D scanner|scanner]]s (see [[tomographic reconstruction]]);\n* [[Radon's theorem]], that ''d''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 points in ''d'' dimensions may always be partitioned into two subsets with intersecting [[convex hull]]s\n* the [[Radon–Hurwitz number]]s.\n* He is possibly the first to make use of the so-called [[Radon–Riesz property]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Radon}}\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=23830}}\n* [http://www.ricam.oeaw.ac.at/ Johann Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics (RICAM)]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Radon, Johann}}\n[[Category:1887 births]]\n[[Category:1956 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Děčín]]\n[[Category:Austrian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:University of Greifswald faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Vienna alumni]]\n[[Category:Vienna University of Technology faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Hamburg faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Erlangen-Nuremberg faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Breslau faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Innsbruck faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Vienna faculty]]\n[[Category:Rectors of universities in Austria]]\n[[Category:Variational analysts]]\n[[Category:Functional analysts]]\n[[Category:Austro-Hungarian mathematicians]]"

He was the son of [[William Henry Young]] and [[Grace Chisholm Young]], both prominent mathematicians. He moved to the US in 1949 but never sought American citizenship.\n\nThe concept of [[Young measure]] is named after him: he also introduced the concept of the [[generalized curve]]<ref>{{harv|Young|1937}}.</ref> and a concept of generalized surface<ref>{{harv|Young|1951}}.</ref> which later evolved in the concept of [[varifold]].<ref>In his commemorative papers describing the research of Almgren, {{harvs|txt|first1=Brian|last1=White|author1-link= Brian White (mathematician)|year=1997|year2=1998|loc1=p.1452, footnote 1|loc2=p.682, footnote 1}} writes that these are \"''essentially the same class of surfaces''\".

Examples of classes of functions with a rich structure are, in addition to the convex functions, the [[subharmonic function]]s and the [[plurisubharmonic function]]s. Geometrically, these classes of functions correspond to convex domains and pseudoconvex domains, but there are also other types of domains, for instance lineally convex domains which can be generalized using [[convex analysis]]. A great deal is already known about these domains, but there remain some fascinating, unsolved problems. This theme is mainly theoretical, but there are computational aspects of the domains studied, and these computational aspects are certainly worthy of further study.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Convex analysis]]\n\n\n{{geometry-stub}}"

[[Point (geometry)|Points]] where concavity changes (between concave and [[convex function|convex]]) are [[inflection point]]s.\n\n3. If {{mvar|f}} is twice-[[Differentiable function|differentiable]], then {{mvar|f}} is concave [[if and only if]] {{mvar|f &prime;&prime;}} is [[non-positive]] (or, informally, if the \"[[acceleration]]\" is non-positive). If its second derivative is [[negative numbers|negative]] then it is strictly concave, but the opposite is not true, as shown by {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = &minus;''x''<sup>4</sup>}}.\n\n4. If {{mvar|f}} is concave and differentiable, then it is bounded above by its first-order [[Taylor approximation]]:<ref name=Varian/>{{rp|489}}\n:<math>f(y) \\leq f(x) + f'(x)[y-x]</math>\n\n5. A [[Lebesgue measurable function]] on an interval {{math|'''C'''}} is concave [[if and only if]] it is midpoint concave, that is, for any {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{math|'''C'''}}\n:<math>f\\left( \\frac{x+y}2 \\right) \\ge \\frac{f(x) + f(y)}2</math>\n\n6. If a function {{mvar|f}} is concave, and {{math|''f''(0) ≥ 0}}, then {{mvar|f}} is [[subadditivity|subadditive]] on <math>[0,\\infty)</math>. Proof:\n* Since {{mvar|f}} is concave and {{math|1 ≥ t ≥ 0}}, letting {{math|1=''y'' = 0}} we have <math>f(tx) = f(tx+(1-t)\\cdot 0) \\ge t f(x)+(1-t)f(0) \\ge t f(x).</math>\n* For <math>a,b\\in[0,\\infty)</math>:\n:<math>f(a) + f(b) = f \\left((a+b) \\frac{a}{a+b} \\right) + f \\left((a+b) \\frac{b}{a+b} \\right)\n\\ge \\frac{a}{a+b} f(a+b) + \\frac{b}{a+b} f(a+b) = f(a+b)</math>\n\n===Functions of ''n'' variables===\n1. A function {{mvar|f}} is concave over a convex set [[if and only if]] the function {{mvar|−f}}  is a [[convex function]] over the set.\n\n2. The sum of two concave functions is itself concave and so is the pointwise minimum of two concave functions, i.e. the set of concave functions on a given domain form a [[semifield]].\n\n3. Near a [[local maximum]] in the interior of the domain of a function, the function must be concave; as a partial converse, if the derivative of a strictly concave function is zero at some point, then that point is a local maximum.\n\n4. Any [[local maximum]] of a concave function is also a [[global maximum]].  A ''strictly'' concave function will have at most one global maximum.\n\n==Examples==\n* The functions <math>f(x)=-x^2</math> and <math>g(x)=\\sqrt{x}</math> are concave on their domains, as their second derivatives <math>f''(x) = -2</math> and <math>g''(x) = -\\frac{1}{4 x^{3/2}}</math> are always negative.\n* The [[logarithm]] function <math>f(x) = \\log{x}</math> is concave on its domain <math>(0,\\infty)</math>, as its derivative <math>\\frac{1}{x}</math> is a strictly decreasing function.\n* Any [[affine function]] <math>f(x)=ax+b</math> is both concave and convex, but neither strictly-concave nor strictly-convex.\n* The [[sine]] function is concave on the interval <math>[0, \\pi]</math>.\n* The function <math>f(B) = \\log |B|</math>, where <math>|B|</math> is the [[determinant]] of a [[nonnegative-definite matrix]] ''B'', is concave.<ref name=\"Cover 1988\">{{cite journal |authorlink=Thomas M.

They are especially important in the study of [[optimization]] problems where they are distinguished by a number of convenient properties. For instance, a (strictly) convex function on an open set has no more than one minimum. Even in infinite-dimensional spaces, under suitable additional hypotheses, convex functions continue to satisfy such properties and as a result, they are the most well-understood functionals in the [[calculus of variations]]. In [[probability theory]], a convex function applied to the [[expected value]] of a [[random variable]] is always less than or equal to the expected value of the convex function of the random variable.  This result, known as [[Jensen's inequality]], underlies many important inequalities (including, for instance, the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means|arithmetic&ndash;geometric mean inequality]] and [[Hölder's inequality]]).\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>X</math> be a [[convex set]] in a real [[vector space]] and let <math>f: X \\rightarrow \\text{R}</math> be a function.\n\n* {{mvar|f}} is called '''convex''' if:\n\n::<math>\\forall x_1, x_2 \\in X, \\forall t \\in [0, 1]: \\qquad f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2)\\leq t f(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)</math>\n\n* {{mvar|f}} is called '''strictly convex''' if:\n\n::<math>\\forall x_1 \\neq x_2 \\in X, \\forall t \\in (0, 1): \\qquad f(tx_1+(1-t)x_2) < t f(x_1)+(1-t)f(x_2)</math>\n\n*A function {{mvar|f}} is said to be (strictly) [[concave function|concave]] if {{math|−''f''}} is (strictly) convex.\n\n== Properties ==\n===Functions of one variable===\n\n* Suppose <math>f</math> is a function of one [[real number|real]] variable defined on an interval, and let\n::<math> R(x_1,x_2) = \\frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2}</math>\n:(note that {{math|''R''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}} is the slope of the purple line in the above drawing;  note also that the function ''R'' is [[Symmetric function|symmetric]] in (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)). <math>f</math> is convex if and only if {{math|''R''(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>)}} is [[monotonically non-decreasing]] in ''x''<sub>1</sub>, for every fixed ''x''<sub>2</sub> (or vice versa).

Visually, a twice differentiable convex function \"curves up\", without any bends the other way ([[inflection point]]s). If its second derivative is positive at all points then the function is strictly convex, but the [[Theorem#Converse|converse]] does not hold.

A third definition<ref name=\"nesterov\"/> for a strongly convex function, with parameter ''m'', is that, for all ''x'', ''y'' in the domain and <math>t\\in [0,1],</math>\n\n:<math>f(tx+(1-t)y) \\le t f(x)+(1-t)f(y) - \\frac{1}{2} m t(1-t) \\|x-y\\|_2^2</math>\n\nNotice that this definition approaches the definition for strict convexity as ''m'' → 0, and is identical to the definition of a convex function when ''m'' = 0. Despite this, functions exist that are strictly convex but are not strongly convex for any ''m'' > 0 (see example below).\n\nIf the function <math>f</math> is twice continuously differentiable, then it is strongly convex with parameter ''m'' if and only if <math>\\nabla^2 f(x) \\succeq mI</math> for all ''x'' in the domain, where ''I'' is the identity and <math>\\nabla^2f</math> is the [[Hessian matrix]], and the inequality <math>\\succeq</math> means that <math>\\nabla^2 f(x) - mI</math> is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive semi-definite]]. This is equivalent to requiring that the minimum [[eigenvalue]] of <math>\\nabla^2 f(x)</math> be at least ''m'' for all ''x''. If the domain is just the real line, then <math>\\nabla^2 f(x)</math> is just the second derivative <math>f''(x),</math> so the condition becomes <math>f''(x) \\ge m</math>. If ''m'' = 0, then this means the Hessian is positive semidefinite (or if the domain is the real line, it means that <math>f''(x) \\ge 0</math>), which implies the function is convex, and perhaps strictly convex, but not strongly convex.\n\nAssuming still that the function is twice continuously differentiable, one can show that the lower bound of <math>\\nabla^2 f(x)</math> implies that it is strongly convex.

The intersection of all the convex sets that contain a given subset {{mvar|A}} of Euclidean space is called the [[convex hull]] of {{mvar|A}}.

      "text": "{{Unsolved|mathematics|Does a Danzer set with bounded density or bounded separation exist?}}\n[[File:Danzer set.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Construction of a two-dimensional Danzer set with growth rate <math>O(n^2\\log n)</math> from overlaid rectangular grids of aspect ratio 1:1, 1:9, 1:81, etc.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''Danzer set''' is a set of points that touches every [[convex body]] of unit volume. [[Ludwig Danzer]] asked whether it is possible for such a set to have bounded [[Delone set|density]].{{r|cfg|dan}} Several variations of this problem remain unsolved.\n\n==Density==\nOne way to define the problem more formally is to consider the growth rate of a set <math>S</math> in <math>d</math>-dimensional Euclidean space, defined as the function that maps a real number <math>r</math> to the number of points of <math>S</math> that are within distance <math>r</math> of the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Danzer's question is whether it is possible for a Danzer set to have growth rate <math>O(r^d)</math>, the growth rate of well-spaced point sets like the [[integer lattice]] (which is not a Danzer set).{{r|cfg}}\n\nIt is possible to construct a Danzer set of growth rate that is within a polylogarithmic factor of <math>O(r^d)</math>. For instance, overlaying rectangular grids whose cells have constant volume but differing [[aspect ratio]]s can achieve a growth rate of <math>O(n^d\\log^{d-1}n)</math>.{{r|bw}}\nConstructions for Danzer sets are known with a somewhat faster growth rate, <math>O(r^d \\log r)</math>, but the answer to Danzer's question remains unknown.{{r|sw}}\n\n==Bounded coverage==\nAnother variation of the problem, posed by [[Timothy Gowers]], asks whether there exists a Danzer set <math>S</math> for which there is a finite bound <math>C</math> on the number of points of intersection between <math>S</math> and any convex body of unit volume.{{r|g}} This version has been solved: it is impossible for a Danzer set with this property to exist.{{r|ssw}}\n\n==Separation==\nA third variation of the problem, still unsolved, is '''Conway's dead fly problem'''. [[John Horton Conway]] recalls that, as a child, he slept in a room with wallpaper whose flower pattern resembled an array of dead flies, and that he would try to find convex regions that did not have a dead fly in them.{{r|r}}\nIn Conway's formulation, the question is whether there exists a Danzer set in which the points of the set (the dead flies) are separated at a bounded distance from each other. Such a set would necessarily also have an upper bound on the distance from each point of the plane to a dead fly (in order to touch all circles of unit area), so it would form a [[Delone set]], a set with both lower and upper bounds on the spacing of the points. It would also necessarily have growth rate <math>O(r^d)</math>, so if it exists then it would also solve the original version of Danzer's problem. Conway has offered a $1000 prize for a solution to his problem,{{r|r|c}} as part of a set of problems also including [[Conway's 99-graph problem]], the analysis of [[sylver coinage]], and the [[Thrackle|thrackle conjecture]].{{r|c}}\n\n==Additional properties==\nIt is also possible to restrict the classes of point sets that may be Danzer sets in other ways than by their densities. In particular, they cannot be the union of finitely many [[Lattice (group)|lattices]],{{r|bw}} they cannot be generated by choosing a point in each tile of a [[substitution tiling]] (in the same position for each tile of the same type), and they cannot be generated by the [[Aperiodic tiling#Cut-and-project method|cut-and-project method]] for constructing [[aperiodic tiling]]s. Therefore, the vertices of the [[pinwheel tiling]] and [[Penrose tiling]] are not Danzer sets.{{r|sw}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Heilbronn triangle problem]], on sets of points that do not form triangles of small area\n*[[Minkowski's theorem]], that every unit-volume closed convex body that is centrally symmetric around the origin contains a nonzero point of the half-integer lattice\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=bw>{{citation\n | last1 = Bambah | first1 = R.
