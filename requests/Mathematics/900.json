      "text": "{{Other|Cartan's theorem (disambiguation){{!}}Cartan's theorem|Dieudonné's theorem}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Cartan–Dieudonné theorem''', named after [[Élie Cartan]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]], establishes that every [[orthogonal transformation]] in an ''n''-dimensional [[symmetric bilinear space]] can be described as the [[function composition|composition]] of at most ''n'' [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s.\n\nThe notion of a symmetric bilinear space is a generalization of [[Euclidean space]] whose structure is defined by a [[symmetric bilinear form]] (which need not be [[Positive-definite bilinear form|positive definite]], so is not necessarily an [[inner product]] – for instance, a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] is also a symmetric bilinear space). The orthogonal transformations in the space are those [[linear map#Endomorphisms and automorphisms|automorphisms]] which preserve the value of the bilinear form between every pair of vectors; in Euclidean space, this corresponds to preserving distances and angles. These orthogonal transformations form a group under composition, the [[orthogonal group]].\n\nFor example, in the two dimensional [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] plane, every orthogonal transformation is either a reflection across a line through the origin or a [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] about the origin (which can be written as the composition of two reflections). Any arbitrary composition of such rotations and reflections can be rewritten as a composition of no more than 2 reflections. Similarly, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, every orthogonal transformation can be described as a single reflection, a rotation (2 reflections), or an [[improper rotation]] (3 reflections). In four-dimensions, [[double rotation]]s are added that represent 4 reflections.\n\n== Formal statement ==\nLet {{nowrap|(''V'', ''b'')}} be an ''n''-dimensional, [[degenerate form|non-degenerate]] symmetric bilinear space over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] with [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] not equal to 2.

In the case of subgroups of the complex general linear group the theorem was first proved by {{harvs|txt=yes|first=G. C. |last=Shephard |author1-link=Geoffrey Colin Shephard|first2=J.

An element ''s'' of  ''GL''(''V'') is called a '''pseudoreflection''' if it fixes a codimension 1 subspace of ''V'' and is not the [[identity transformation]] ''I'', or equivalently, if the [[kernel (linear operator)|kernel]] Ker (''s'' &minus; ''I'') has [[codimension]] one in ''V''. Assume that the order of ''G'' is relatively prime to the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' (the so-called non-modular case). Then the following properties are equivalent:<ref>See, e.g.: Bourbaki, ''Lie'', chap.

Shephard and Todd derived a full classification of such groups.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* Let ''V'' be one-dimensional. Then any finite group faithfully acting on ''V'' is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of the field ''K'', and hence a [[cyclic group]]. It follows that ''G'' consists of roots of unity of order dividing ''n'', where ''n'' is its order, so ''G'' is generated by pseudoreflections. In this case, ''K''[''V''] = ''K''[''x''] is the polynomial ring in one variable and the algebra of invariants of ''G'' is the subalgebra generated by ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>, hence it is a polynomial algebra.\n* Let ''V'' = ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> be the standard ''n''-dimensional vector space and ''G'' be the [[symmetric group]] ''S''<sub>''n''</sub> acting by permutations of the elements of the standard basis. The symmetric group is generated by transpositions (''ij''), which act by reflections on ''V''. On the other hand, by the main theorem of [[symmetric function]]s, the algebra of invariants is the polynomial algebra generated by the elementary symmetric functions ''e''<sub>1</sub>, … ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n* Let ''V'' = ''K''<sup>''2''</sup> and ''G'' be the cyclic group of order 2 acting by ±''I''. In this case, ''G'' is not generated by pseudoreflections, since the nonidentity element ''s'' of ''G'' acts without fixed points, so that dim Ker (''s'' &minus; ''I'') = 0. On the other hand, the algebra of invariants is the subalgebra of ''K''[''V''] = ''K''[''x'', ''y''] generated by the homogeneous elements ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''xy'', and ''y''<sup>2</sup> of degree 2. This subalgebra is not a polynomial algebra because of the relation ''x''<sup>2</sup>''y''<sup>2</sup> = (''xy'')<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{harvtxt|Broer|2007}} gave an extension of the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem to positive characteristic.\n\nThere has been much work on the question of when a reductive algebraic group acting on a vector\nspace has a polynomial ring of invariants. In the case when the algebraic group is simple all cases when the invariant ring is polynomial have been classified by {{harvtxt|Schwarz|1978}}\n\nIn general, the ring of invariants of a finite group acting linearly on a complex vector space is [[Cohen-Macaulay]], so it is a finite rank free module over a polynomial subring.\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation | title=Éléments de mathématiques&nbsp;: Groupes et algèbres de Lie | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas }} (English translation: {{citation | title=Elements of Mathematics: Lie Groups and Lie Algebras | last=Bourbaki | first=Nicolas }})\n*{{citation|title=On Chevalley-Shephard-Todd's theorem in positive characteristic\n|first=Abraham |last=Broer|arxiv=0709.0715|year=2007|publisher=[]|bibcode=2007arXiv0709.0715B}}\n* {{citation | authorlink=Claude Chevalley |first=Claude |last= Chevalley | title=Invariants of finite groups generated by reflections | journal=Amer.

Now let <math>H</math> be an arbitrary closed subgroup of <math>G</math>. Our goal is to show that <math>H</math> is a smooth embedded submanifold of <math>G</math>. Our first step is to identify something that could be the Lie algebra of <math>H</math>, that is, the tangent space of <math>H</math> at the identity. The challenge is that <math>H</math> is not assumed to have any smoothness and therefore it is not clear how one may define its tangent space. To proceed, we define the \"Lie algebra\" <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> of <math>H</math> by the formula\n:<math>\\mathfrak{h}=\\{ X\\mid e^{tX}\\in H,\\,\\,\\forall t\\in\\mathbb{R}\\}. </math>\n\nIt is not difficult to show that <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a Lie subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.20</ref> In particular, <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a subspace of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, which we might hope could be the tangent space of <math>H</math> at the identity. For this idea to work, however, we need to know that <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is big enough to capture some interesting information about <math>H</math>. If, for example, <math>H</math> were some large subgroup of <math>G</math> but <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> turned out to be zero, <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> would not be helpful to us.\n\nThe key step, then, is to show that <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> actually captures all the elements of <math>H</math> that are sufficiently close to the identity. That is to say, we need to show that the following critical lemma holds:\n:'''Lemma''': Take a small neighborhood <math>U</math> of the origin in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> such that the exponential map sends <math>U</math> diffeomorphically onto some neighborhood <math>V</math> of the identity in <math>G</math>, and let <math>\\log:V\\rightarrow U</math> be the inverse of the exponential map. Then there is some smaller neighborhood <math>W\\subset V</math> such that if <math>h</math> belongs to <math>W\\cap H</math>, then <math>\\log(h)</math> belongs to <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42</ref> \n\nOnce this has been established, one can use [[exponential coordinates]] on <math>W</math>, that is, writing each <math>g\\in W</math> (not necessarily in <math>H</math>) as <math>g=e^X</math> for <math>X=\\log(g)</math>. In these coordinates, the lemma says that <math>X</math> corresponds to a point in <math>H</math> precisely if <math>X</math> belongs to <math>\\mathfrak{h}\\subset\\mathfrak{g}</math>. That is to say, in exponential coordinates near the identity, <math>H</math> looks like <math>\\mathfrak{h}\\subset\\mathfrak{g}</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is just a subspace of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, this means that <math>\\mathfrak{h}\\subset\\mathfrak{g}</math> is just like <math>\\mathbb{R}^k\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, with <math>k=\\dim(\\mathfrak{h})</math> and <math>n=\\dim(\\mathfrak{g})</math>. Thus, we have exhibited a \"[[slice coordinate system]]\" in which <math>H\\subset G</math> looks locally like <math>\\mathbb{R}^k\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n</math>, which is the condition for an embedded submanifold.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2003}} Chapter 5</ref>\n\nIt is worth noting that Rossmann shows that for ''any'' subgroup <math>H</math> of <math>G</math> (not necessarily closed), the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> of <math>H</math> is a Lie subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} Chapter 2, Proposition 1 and Corollary 7</ref> Rossmann then goes on to introduce coordinates<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} Section 2.3</ref> on <math>H</math> that make the identity component of <math>H</math> into a Lie group. It is important to note, however, that the topology on <math>H</math> coming from these coordinates is not the subset topology. That it so say, the identity component of <math>H</math> is an immersed submanifold of <math>G</math> but not an embedded submanifold.\n\nIn particular, the lemma stated above does not hold if <math>H</math> is not closed.\n\n==Example of a non-closed subgroup==\n[[File:Torus.png|thumb|193px|right|The torus {{math|''G''}}. Imagine a bent [[helix]] laid out on the surface picturing {{math|''H''}}. If {{math|''a'' {{=}} {{frac|''p''|''q''}}}} in lowest terms, the helix will close up on itself at {{math|(1, 1)}} after {{math|''p''}} rotations in {{math|''φ''}} and ''q'' rotations in {{math|''θ''}}. If {{math|''a''}} is irrational, the helix winds indefinitely.]]\nFor an example of a subgroup that is not an embedded Lie subgroup, consider the [[torus]] and an \"[[irrational winding of a torus|irrational winding of the torus]]\".\n:<math>G = \\mathbb{T}^2 = \\left\\{\\left .\\left(\\begin{matrix}e^{2\\pi i\\theta} & 0\\\\0 & e^{2\\pi i\\phi} \\end{matrix}\\right)\\right| \\theta, \\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\},</math>\nand its subgroup\n:<math>H = \\left\\{\\left .\\left(\\begin{matrix}e^{2\\pi i\\theta} & 0\\\\0 & e^{2\\pi ia\\theta}\\end{matrix}\\right) \\right| \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\} \\text{with Lie algebra } \\mathfrak{h} =  \\left\\{\\left .\\left(\\begin{matrix} i\\theta & 0\\\\0 & ia\\theta\\end{matrix}\\right)\\right| \\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}\\right\\},</math>\nwith {{math|''a''}} irrational. Then {{math|''H''}} is [[Dense set|dense]] in {{math|''G''}} and hence not closed.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2003}} Example 7.3</ref> In the [[Subspace topology|relative topology]], a small open subset of {{math|''H''}} is composed of infinitely many almost parallel line segments on the surface of the torus. This means that {{math|''H''}} is not [[locally path connected]]. In the group topology, the small open sets are ''single'' line segments on the surface of the torus and {{math|''H''}} ''is'' locally path connected.\n\nThe example shows that for some groups {{math|''H''}} one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood {{math|''U''}} in the relative topology {{math|''τ''<sub>r</sub>}} of the identity that are exponentials of elements of {{math|'''h'''}}, yet they cannot be connected to the identity with a path staying in {{math|''U''}}.<ref name=\"Rossmann 2002\">{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} See comment to Corollary 5, Section 2.2.</ref> The group {{math|(''H'', ''τ''<sub>r</sub>)}} is not a Lie group. While the map {{math|exp:'''h''' → (''H'', ''τ''<sub>r</sub>)}} is an analytic bijection, its inverse is not continuous. That is, if {{math|''U'' ⊂ '''h'''}} corresponds to a small open interval {{math|−''ε'' < ''θ'' < ''ε''}}, there is no open {{math|''V'' ⊂ (''H'', ''τ''<sub>r</sub>)}} with {{math|log(''V'') ⊂ ''U''}} due to the appearance of the sets {{math|''V''}}. However, with the group topology {{math|''τ''<sub>g</sub>}}, {{math|(''H'', ''τ''<sub>g</sub>)}} is a Lie group. With this topology the injection {{math|ι:(''H'', ''τ''<sub>g</sub>) → ''G''}} is an analytic [[Injective function|injective]] immersion, but not a [[homeomorphism]], hence not an embedding. There are also examples of groups {{math|''H''}} for which one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood (in the relative topology) of the identity that are ''not'' exponentials of elements of {{math|'''h'''}}.<ref name=\"Rossmann 2002\"/> For closed subgroups this is not the case as the proof below of the theorem shows.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Lie groups}}\nBecause of the conclusion of the theorem, some authors chose to ''define'' '''linear Lie groups''' or '''matrix Lie groups''' as closed subgroups of {{math|GL(''n'', ℝ)}} or {{math|GL(''n'', ℂ)}}.<ref>E.g. {{harvnb|Hall|2015}}. See definition in Chapter 1.</ref> In this setting, one proves that every element of the group sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of an element of the Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.42</ref> (The proof is practically identical to the proof of the closed subgroup theorem presented below.) It follows every closed subgroup is an ''embedded'' submanifold of {{math|GL(''n'', ℂ)}}<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.45</ref>\n\nThe '''homogeneous space construction theorem''' states\n:If {{math|''H'' ⊂ ''G''}} is a ''closed Lie subgroup'', then {{math|''G''/''H''}}, the left coset space, has a unique [[real-analytic manifold]] structure such that the quotient map {{math|{{pi}}:''G'' → ''G''/''H''}} is an analytic [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]]. The left action given by {{math|''g''<sub>1</sub> ⋅ (''g''<sub>2</sub>H) {{=}} (''g''<sub>1</sub>''g''<sub>2</sub>)''H''}} turns {{math|''G''/''H''}} into a [[homogeneous space|homogeneous {{math|''G''}}-space]].\n\nThe closed subgroup theorem now simplifies the hypotheses considerably, a priori widening the class of homogeneous spaces. Every closed subgroup yields a homogeneous space.\n\nIn a similar way, the closed subgroup theorem simplifies the hypothesis in the following theorem.\n:If {{math|''X''}} is a set with [[transitive group action]] and the [[isotropy group]] or '''stabilizer''' of a point {{math|''x'' ∈ ''X''}} is a closed Lie subgroup, then {{math|''X''}} has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the action is smooth.\n\n==Conditions for being closed==\nA few sufficient conditions for {{math|''H'' ⊂ ''G''}} being closed, hence an embedded Lie group, is given below.\n*All [[classical group]]s are closed in {{math|GL(''F'', ''n'')}}, where {{math|''F'' {{=}} ℝ, ℂ}}, or {{math|ℍ}}, the [[quaternion]]s.\n*A subgroup that is ''locally closed'' is closed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rossmann|2002}} Problem 1.

If {{math|''H'' ⊂ ''G''}} with {{math|''G''}} closed in {{math|GL(''n'',ℝ)}}, then {{math|''H''}} is closed in {{math|GL(''n'', ℝ)}}, so the specialization to {{math|GL(''n'', ℝ)}} instead of arbitrary {{math|''G'' ⊂ GL(''n'', ℝ)}} matters little.\n\n===Proof of the key lemma===\nWe begin by establishing the key lemma stated in the \"overview\" section above.\n\nEndow {{math|'''g'''}} with the [[Hilbert–Schmidt inner product]] {{math|(''X'', ''Y'') → Tr(''X<sup>t</sup>Y'')}}, and let {{math|'''h'''}} be the Lie algebra of {{math|''H''}} defined as {{math|'''h''' {{=}} {''X'' ∈ ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ) {{=}} '''g'''{{!}}''e''<sup>''tX''</sup> ∈ ''H'' ∀''t'' ∈ ℝ}}}. Let {{math|'''s''' {{=}} {''S'' ∈ '''g'''{{!}} (''S'', ''T'') {{=}} 0 ∀''T'' ∈ '''h'''}}}, the [[orthogonal complement]] of {{math|'''h'''}}. Then {{math|'''g'''}} decomposes as the [[direct sum]] {{math|'''g''' {{=}} '''s''' ⊕ '''h'''}}, so each {{math|''X'' ∈ '''g'''}} is uniquely expressed as {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''S'' + ''T''}} with {{math|''S'' ∈ '''s''', ''T'' ∈ '''h'''}}.\n\nDefine a map {{math|Φ : '''g''' → GL(''n'', ℝ)}} by {{math|(''S'', ''T'') ↦ ''e''<sup>''S''</sup>''e''<sup>''T''</sup>}}. Expand the exponentials,\n:<math>\\Phi(S,T) = e^{tS}e^{tT} = (I + tS + O(t^2))(I + tT + O(t^2)) = I + tS + tT + O(t^2),</math>\nand the [[pushforward (differential)|pushforward]] or '''differential''' at {{math|0}}, {{math|Φ<sub>∗</sub>(''S'', ''T'') {{=}} {{frac|d|d''t''}}Φ(''tS'', ''tT''){{!}}<sub>t {{=}} 0</sub>}} is seen to be {{math|''S'' + ''T''}}, i.e. {{math|Φ<sub>∗</sub> {{=}} Id}}, the identity. The hypothesis of the [[inverse function theorem]] is satisfied with {{math|Φ}} analytic, and thus there are open sets {{math|''U''<sub>1</sub> ⊂ '''g''', ''V''<sub>1</sub> ⊂ GL(''n'', ℝ)}} with {{math|0 ∈ ''U''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''I'' ∈ ''V''<sub>1</sub>}} such that {{math|Φ}} is a [[real-analytic]] bijection from {{math|''U''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>}} with analytic inverse. It remains to show that {{math|''U''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>}} contain open sets {{math|''U''}} and {{math|''V''}} such that the conclusion of the theorem holds.\n\nConsider a [[Countable set|countable]] [[neighborhood basis]] {{math|Β}} at {{math|0 ∈ '''g'''}}, linearly ordered by reverse inclusion with {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub> ⊂ ''U''<sub>1</sub>}}.<ref>For this one can choose open balls, {{math|''Β'' {{=}} {''B''<sub>''k''</sub>{{!}} diam(''B''<sub>''k''</sub>) {{=}} {{frac|1|(''k'' + ''m'')}}, ''k'' ∈ ℕ} }} for some  large enough {{math|''m''}} such that {{math|''B''<sub>1</sub> ⊂ ''U''<sub>1</sub>}}. Here the metric obtained from the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is used.</ref> Suppose for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that for all {{math|''i''}}, {{math|''e''<sup>''Φ''(''B''<sub>''i''</sub>)</sup> ∩ ''H''}} contains an element {{math|''h''<sub>''i''</sub>}} that is ''not'' on the form {{math|''h''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''e''<sup>T<sub>''i''</sub></sup>,''T''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ '''h'''}}. Then, since {{math|Φ}} is a bijection on the {{math|''B''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, there is a unique sequence {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''S''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}}, with {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ '''s'''}} and {{math|''T''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ '''h'''}} such that {{math|''X''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>}} converging to {{math|0}} because {{math|Β}} is a neighborhood basis, with {{math|''e''<sup>''S''<sub>''i''</sub></sup>e<sup>''T''<sub>''i''</sub></sup> {{=}} ''h''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Since {{math|''e''<sup>''T''<sub>''i''</sub></sup> ∈ ''H''}} and {{math|''h''<sub>''i''</sub> ∈ ''H''}}, {{math|''e''<sup>S<sub>''i''</sub></sup> ∈ ''H''}} as well.\n\nNormalize the sequence in {{math|'''s'''}}, {{math|''Y''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} {{fraction|''S''<sub>''i''</sub>|{{!}}{{!}}''S''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}}}}}}. It takes its values in the unit sphere in {{math|'''s'''}} and since it is [[compact space|compact]], there is a convergent subsequence converging to {{math|''Y'' ∈ '''s'''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Willard|1970}} By problem 17G, '''s''' is sequentially compact, meaning every sequence has a convergent subsequence.</ref> The index {{math|''i''}} henceforth refers to this subsequence. It will be shown that {{math|''e''<sup>''tY''</sup> ∈ ''H'', ∀''t'' ∈ ℝ}}. Fix {{math|''t''}} and choose a sequence {{math|''m''<sub>''i''</sub>}} of integers such that {{math|''m''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}}''S''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}} → ''t''}} as {{math|''i'' → ∞}}. For example, {{math|''m''<sub>''i''</sub>}} such that {{math|''m''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}}''S''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}} ≤ ''t'' ≤ (''m''<sub>''i''</sub> + 1){{!}}{{!}}''S''<sub>''i''</sub>{{!}}{{!}}}} will do, as {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub>}} → 0. Then\n:<math>(e^{S_i})^{m_i} = e^{m_iS_i} = e^{m_i\\|S_i\\| Y_i} \\rightarrow e^{t Y}.</math>\n\nSince {{math|''H''}} is a group, the left hand side is in {{math|''H''}} for all {{math|''i''}}. Since {{math|''H''}} is closed, {{math|''e''<sup>''tY''</sup> ∈ ''H'', ∀''t''}},<ref>{{harvnb|Willard|1979}} Corollary 10.5.</ref> hence {{math|''Y'' ∈ '''h'''}}. This is a contradiction. Hence, for some {{math|''i''}} the sets {{math|''U'' {{=}} Β<sub>''i''</sub>}} and {{math|''V'' {{=}} Φ(Β<sub>''i''</sub>)}} satisfy {{math|''e''<sup>(''U'' ∩ '''h''')</sup> {{=}} ''H'' ∩ ''V''}} and the exponential restricted to the open set {{math|(''U'' ∩ '''h''') ⊂ '''h'''}} is in analytic bijection with the open set {{math|Φ(''U'') ∩ ''H'' ⊂ ''H''}}. This proves the lemma.\n\n===Proof of the theorem===\nFor {{math|''j'' ≥ ''i''}}, the image in {{math|''H''}} of {{math|''B''<sub>''j''</sub>}} under {{math|Φ}} form a neighborhood basis at {{math|I}}. This is, by the way it is constructed, a neighborhood basis both in the group topology and the [[relative topology]]. Since multiplication in {{math|''G''}} is analytic, the left and right translates of this neighborhood basis by a group element {{math|''g'' ∈ ''G''}} gives a neighborhood basis at {{math|''g''}}. These bases restricted to {{math|''H''}} gives neighborhood bases at all {{math|''h'' ∈ ''H''}}. The topology generated by these bases is the relative topology. The conclusion is that the relative topology is the same as the group topology.\n\nNext, construct coordinate charts on {{math|''H''}}. First define {{math|φ<sub>1</sub>:e<sup>(''U'')</sup> ⊂ ''G'' → '''g''', ''g'' ↦ log(''g'')}}. This is an analytic bijection with analytic inverse. Furthermore, if {{math|''h'' ∈ ''H''}}, then {{math|φ<sub>1</sub>(''h'') ∈ '''h'''}}. By fixing a basis for {{math|'''g''' {{=}} '''h''' ⊕ '''s'''}} and identifying {{math|'''g'''}} with {{math|ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>}}, then in these coordinates {{math|φ<sub>1</sub>(''h'') {{=}} (x<sub>1</sub>(''h''), …, x<sub>m</sub>(''h''), 0, …, 0)}}, where {{math|''m''}} is the dimension of {{math|'''h'''}}. This shows that {{math|(e<sup>''U''</sup>, φ<sub>1</sub>)}} is a slice chart. By translating the charts obtained from the countable neighborhood basis used above one obtains slice charts around every point in {{math|''H''}}. This shows that {{math|''H''}} is an embedded submanifold of {{math|''G''}}.\n\nMoreover, multiplication {{math|''m''}}, and inversion {{math|''i''}} in {{math|''H''}} are analytic since these operations are analytic in {{math|''G''}} and restriction to a submanifold  (embedded or immersed) with the relative topology again yield analytic operations {{math|''m'':''H'' × ''H'' → ''G''}} and {{math|''i'':''H'' × ''H'' → ''G''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2003}} Proposition 8.22.</ref> But since {{math|''H''}} is embedded, {{math|''m'':''H'' × ''H'' → ''H''}} and {{math|''i'':''H'' × ''H'' → ''H''}} are analytic as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Lee|2003}} Corollary 8.25.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Inverse function theorem]]\n*[[Lie correspondence]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|title=John von Neumann 1903–1957|first=S.|last=Bochner|authorlink=Salomon Bochner|journal=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1958|pages=438–456|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/von-neumann-john.pdf}}.

(Equicharacteristic means that the local ring and its residue field have the same characteristic, and is equivalent to the local ring containing a field.)\n*Any complete regular Noetherian local ring that is not equicharacteristic but is unramified is uniquely determined by its residue field and its dimension. \n*Any complete Noetherian local ring is the image of a complete regular Noetherian local ring.\n\n==Statement==\nThe most commonly used case of Cohen's theorem is when the complete Noetherian local ring contains some field. In this case Cohen's structure theorem states that the ring is of the form ''k''[[''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>]]/(''I'') for some ideal ''I'', where ''k'' is its residue class field.\n\nIn the unequal characteristic case when the complete Noetherian local ring does not contain a field, Cohen's structure theorem states that the local ring is a quotient of a formal power series ring in a finite number of variables over a [[Cohen ring]] with the same residue field as the local ring. A Cohen ring is a field or a complete characteristic zero [[discrete valuation ring]] whose maximal ideal is generated by a prime number ''p'' (equal to the characteristic of the residue field).\n\nIn both cases, the hardest part of Cohen's proof is to show that the complete Noetherian local ring contains a '''coefficient ring''' (or '''coefficient field'''), meaning a complete discrete valuation ring (or field) with the same residue field as the local ring.\n\nAll this material is developed carefully in the Stacks Project {{Cite web|url=http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0323 |title=Stacks Project — Tag 0323 |website=stacks.math.columbia.edu|access-date=2018-08-13}}.\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Cohen | first1=I.

      "text": "In the branch of [[abstract algebra]] called [[ring theory]], the '''double centralizer theorem''' can refer to any one of several similar results. These results concern the [[centralizer and normalizer|centralizer of a subring]] ''S'' of a ring ''R'', denoted '''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>(''S'') in this article. It is always the case that '''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>(''S'')) contains ''S'', and a double centralizer theorem gives conditions on ''R'' and ''S'' that guarantee that '''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>(''S'')) is ''equal'' to ''S''.\n\n==Statements of the theorem==\n\n===Motivation===\nThe centralizer of a subring ''S'' of ''R'' given by\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{C}_R(S)=\\{r\\in R \\mid rs=sr \\text{ for all } s\\in S\\}.\\,</math>\n\nClearly '''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>(''S''))&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''S'', but it is not always the case that one can say the two sets are equal. The double centralizer theorems give conditions under which one can conclude that equality occurs.\n\nThere is another special case of interest. Let ''M'' be a right ''R'' module and give ''M'' the natural left ''E''-module structure, where ''E'' is End(''M''), the ring of endomorphisms of the abelian group ''M''. Every map ''m''<sub>''r''</sub> given by ''m''<sub>''r''</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''xr'' creates an additive endomorphism of ''M'', that is, an element of ''E''. The map ''r''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''m''<sub>''r''</sub> is a ring homomorphism of ''R'' into the ring ''E'', and we denote the image of ''R'' inside of ''E'' by ''R''<sub>''M''</sub>. It can be checked that the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this canonical map is the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] Ann(''M''<sub>''R''</sub>). Therefore, by an [[Isomorphism theorem#First isomorphism theorem 2|isomorphism theorem]] for rings, ''R''<sub>''M''</sub> is isomorphic to the quotient ring ''R''/Ann(''M''<sub>''R''</sub>). Clearly when ''M'' is a [[faithful module]], ''R'' and ''R''<sub>''M''</sub> are isomorphic rings.\n\nSo now ''E'' is a ring with ''R''<sub>''M''</sub> as a subring, and '''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>(''R''<sub>''M''</sub>) may be formed. By definition one can check that '''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>(''R''<sub>''M''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;End(''M''<sub>''R''</sub>), the ring of ''R'' module endomorphisms of ''M''. Thus if it occurs that '''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>(''R''<sub>''M''</sub>))&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R''<sub>''M''</sub>, this is the same thing as saying '''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>(End(''M''<sub>''R''</sub>))&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R''<sub>''M''</sub>.\n\n===Central simple algebras===\nPerhaps the most common version is the version for [[central simple algebra]]s, as it appears in {{harv|Knapp|2007|loc=p.115}}:\n\n'''Theorem''': If ''A'' is a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a field ''F'' and ''B'' is a simple subalgebra of ''A'', then '''C'''<sub>''A''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''A''</sub>(''B''))&nbsp;=&nbsp;''B'', and moreover the dimensions satisfy\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{dim}_F(B)\\cdot\\mathrm{dim}_F(\\mathrm{C}_A(B))=\\mathrm{dim}_F(A).\\,</math>\n\n===Artinian rings===\nThe following generalized version for [[Artinian ring]]s (which include finite-dimensional algebras) appears in {{harv|Isaacs|2009|loc=p.187}}. Given a [[simple module|simple]] ''R'' module ''U''<sub>''R''</sub>, we will borrow notation from the above motivation section including ''R''<sub>''U''</sub> and ''E''=End(''U''). Additionally, we will write ''D''=End(''U''<sub>''R''</sub>) for the subring of ''E'' consisting of ''R''-homomorphisms. By [[Schur's lemma]], ''D'' is a [[division ring]].\n\n'''Theorem''': Let ''R'' be a right Artinian ring with a simple right module ''U''<sub>''R''</sub>, and let ''R''<sub>''U''</sub>, ''D'' and ''E'' be given as in the previous paragraph. Then\n:<math>R_U=\\mathrm{C}_E(\\mathrm{C}_E(R_U))\\,</math>.\n\n;Remarks:\n* In this version, the rings are chosen with the intent of proving the [[Jacobson density theorem]]. Notice that it only concludes that a particular subring has the centralizer property, in contrast to the central simple algebra version.\n* Since algebras are normally defined over commutative rings, and all the involved rings above may be noncommutative, it's clear that algebras are not necessarily involved.\n* If ''U'' is additionally a [[faithful module]], so that ''R'' is a right [[primitive ring]], then ''R''<sub>''U''</sub> is ring isomorphic to ''R''.\n\n===Polynomial identity rings===\nIn {{harv|Rowen|1980|loc=p.154}}, a version is given for [[polynomial identity ring]]s. The notation Z(''R'') will be used to denote the [[center of a ring]] ''R''.\n\n'''Theorem''': If ''R'' is a [[simple ring|simple]] polynomial identity ring, and ''A'' is a simple Z(''R'') subalgebra of ''R'', then '''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''R''</sub>(''A''))&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''.\n\n;Remarks\n* This version can be considered to be \"between\" the central simple algebra version and the Artinian ring version. This is because simple polynomial identity rings are Artinian,<ref>They are full matrix rings over polynomial identity division rings, according to {{harvtxt|Rowen|1980|page=151}}</ref> but unlike the Artinian version, the conclusion still refers to all central simple subrings of ''R''.\n\n===von Neumann Algebras===\nThe [[Von Neumann bicommutant theorem]] states that a *-subalgebra ''A'' of the algebra of [[bounded operators]] ''B''(''H'')  on a [[Hilbert space]] ''H'' is a [[von Neumann algebra]] (i.e. is [[weak operator topology|weakly closed]]) if and only if ''A'' = C<sub>''B''(''H'')</sub>C<sub>''B''(''H'')</sub>(A).\n\n==Double centralizer property==\n{{main|Balanced module}}\n\nA module ''M'' is said to have the ''[[balanced module|double centralizer property]]'' or to be a ''[[balanced module]]'' if '''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>('''C'''<sub>''E''</sub>(''R''<sub>''M''</sub>))&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R''<sub>''M''</sub>, where ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;End(''M'') and ''R''<sub>''M''</sub> are as given in the motivation section. In this terminology, the Artinian ring version of the double centralizer theorem states that simple right modules for right Artinian rings are balanced modules.\n\n==Notes==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation |last=Isaacs|first= I.

Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.\n\n==Proof==\nFirst, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:\n<math> 1_\\circ = 1_\\circ \\circ 1_\\circ\n               = (1_{\\otimes} \\otimes 1_\\circ) \\circ (1_\\circ \\otimes 1_\\otimes)\n               = (1_\\otimes \\circ 1_\\circ) \\otimes (1_\\circ \\circ 1_\\otimes)\n               = 1_\\otimes \\otimes 1_\\otimes\n               = 1_\\otimes</math>.\n \nNow, let <math>a,b \\in X</math>.\nThen <math>a \\circ b = (1 \\otimes a) \\circ (b \\otimes 1)\n                     = (1 \\circ b) \\otimes (a \\circ 1)\n                     = b \\otimes a\n                     = (b \\circ 1) \\otimes (1 \\circ a)\n                     = (b \\otimes 1) \\circ (1 \\otimes a)\n                     = b \\circ a</math>. This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.\n\nFor associativity, <math>(a \\otimes b) \\otimes c = (a \\otimes b) \\otimes (1 \\otimes c) = (a \\otimes 1) \\otimes (b \\otimes c) = a \\otimes (b \\otimes c)</math>.\n\n== Remarks ==\nIf the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on <math>X</math>, and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that <math>\\otimes</math> is a monoid homomorphism <math>(X,\\circ)\\times(X,\\circ)\\to(X,\\circ)</math> (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If <math>X</math> is a [[monoid object]] in the [[category of monoids]], then <math>X</math> is in fact a commutative monoid.\n\nIt is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a triviality result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of [[groupoid]]s turns out to be equivalent to the notion of [[crossed module]]. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. \n\nMore generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the [[interchange law]] in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) [[double category]] is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written <math>\\circ, \\otimes</math> then the interchange law reads \n:<math> (a \\circ b) \\otimes (c \\circ d) = (a \\otimes c) \\circ (b \\otimes d)</math>\nwhenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. \n\nThe history in relation to [[homotopy group]]s is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian [[fundamental group]] was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian [[Homology (mathematics)|homology groups]] could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group [[Abelianisation|made abelian]]. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. \n\nIn 1932, [[Eduard Čech]] submitted a paper on higher [[Homotopy group|homotopy groups]] to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zurich. However, [[Pavel Alexandrov|Pavel Alexandroff]] and [[Heinz Hopf]] quickly proved these groups were abelian for <math>n > 1</math>, and on these grounds persuaded Cech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the ''Proceedings''. It is said that [[Witold Hurewicz]] attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935.{{cn|date=May 2013}} Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage.{{cn|date=May 2013}} \n\nCubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed  for filtered spaces in the book ''[http://pages.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html Nonabelian algebraic topology]'' cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the [[Seifert–van Kampen theorem|Seifert-van Kampen theorem]], without using [[singular homology]] or simplicial approximation.\n\n==References==\n*[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week89.html John Baez: Eckmann–Hilton principle (week 89)]\n*[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week100.html John Baez: Eckmann–Hilton principle (week 100)]\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Eckmann | first1 = B.\n | last2 = Hilton | first2 = P.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], the '''Frobenius theorem''', proved by [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]] in 1877, characterizes the [[finite-dimensional]] [[Associative algebra|associative]] [[division algebra]]s over the [[real number]]s.  According to the theorem, every such algebra is [[isomorphic]] to one of the following:\n* {{math|'''R'''}} (the real numbers)\n* {{math|'''C'''}} (the [[complex number]]s)\n* {{math|'''H'''}} (the [[quaternions]]).\nThese algebras have real dimension {{math|1, 2}}, and {{math|4}}, respectively.  Of these three algebras, {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}} are [[commutative]], but {{math|'''H'''}} is not.\n\n==Proof==\nThe main ingredients for the following proof are the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] and the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]].\n\n===Introducing some notation===\n* Let {{math|''D''}} be the division algebra in question.\n* We identify the real multiples of {{math|1}} with {{math|'''R'''}}.\n* When we write {{math|''a'' ≤ 0}} for an element {{mvar|a}} of {{mvar|D}}, we tacitly assume that {{mvar|a}} is contained in {{math|'''R'''}}.\n* We can consider {{mvar|D}} as a finite-dimensional {{math|'''R'''}}-[[vector space]]. Any element {{mvar|d}} of {{mvar|D}} defines an [[endomorphism]] of {{mvar|D}} by left-multiplication, we identify {{mvar|d}} with that endomorphism. Therefore, we can speak about the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of {{mvar|d}}, and its [[characteristic polynomial|characteristic]] and [[Minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal]] [[polynomial]]s.\n* For any {{mvar|z}} in {{math|'''C'''}} define the following real quadratic polynomial:\n::<math>Q(z; x) = x^2 - 2\\operatorname{Re}(z)x + |z|^2 = (x-z)(x-\\overline{z}) \\in \\mathbf{R}[x].</math>\n:Note that if {{math|''z'' ∈ '''C''' ∖ '''R'''}} then {{math|''Q''(''z''; ''x'')}} is irreducible over {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===The claim===\nThe key to the argument is the following\n\n:'''Claim.''' The set {{mvar|V}} of all elements {{mvar|a}} of {{mvar|D}} such that {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0}} is a vector subspace of {{mvar|D}} of [[codimension]] {{math|1}}. Moreover {{math|''D'' {{=}} '''R''' ⊕ ''V''}} as {{math|'''R'''}}-vector spaces, which implies that {{mvar|V}} generates {{mvar|D}} as an algebra.\n\n'''Proof of Claim:''' Let {{mvar|m}} be the dimension of {{mvar|D}} as an {{math|'''R'''}}-vector space, and pick {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|D}} with characteristic polynomial {{math|''p''(''x'')}}. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write\n\n:<math> p(x)= (x-t_1)\\cdots(x-t_r) (x-z_1)(x - \\overline{z_1}) \\cdots (x-z_s)(x - \\overline{z_s}), \\qquad t_i \\in \\mathbf{R}, \\quad z_j \\in \\mathbf{C} \\backslash \\mathbf{R}.</math>\n\nWe can rewrite {{math|''p''(''x'')}} in terms of the polynomials {{math|''Q''(''z''; ''x'')}}:\n\n:<math> p(x)= (x-t_1)\\cdots(x-t_r) Q(z_1; x) \\cdots Q(z_s; x).</math>\n\nSince {{math|''z<sub>j</sub>'' ∈ '''C'''\\'''R'''}}, the polynomials {{math|''Q''(''z<sub>j</sub>''; ''x'')}} are all [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}. By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, {{math|''p''(''a'') {{=}} 0}} and because {{mvar|D}} is a division algebra, it follows that either {{math|''a'' − ''t<sub>i</sub>'' {{=}} 0}} for some {{mvar|i}} or that {{math|''Q''(''z<sub>j</sub>''; ''a'') {{=}} 0}} for some {{mvar|j}}. The first case implies that {{mvar|a}} is real. In the second case, it follows that {{math|''Q''(''z<sub>j</sub>''; ''x'')}} is the minimal polynomial of {{mvar|a}}. Because {{math|''p''(''x'')}} has the same complex roots as the minimal polynomial and because it is real it follows that\n\n:<math> p(x)= Q(z_j; x)^k = \\left (x^2 - 2\\operatorname{Re}(z_j) x + |z_j|^2 \\right )^k </math>\n\nSince {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is the characteristic polynomial of {{mvar|a}} the coefficient of {{math|''x''<sup>2''k''−1</sup>}} in {{math|''p''(''x'')}} is {{math|tr(''a'')}} up to a sign. Therefore, we read from the above equation we have: {{math|tr(''a'') {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|Re(''z<sub>j</sub>'') {{=}} 0}}, in other words {{math|tr(''a'') {{=}} 0}} if and only if {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} −{{!}}''z<sub>j</sub>''{{!}}<sup>2</sup> < 0}}.\n\nSo {{mvar|V}} is the subset of all {{mvar|a}} with {{math|tr(''a'') {{=}} 0}}. In particular, it is a vector subspace. Moreover, {{mvar|V}} has codimension {{math|1}} since it is the kernel of a non-zero linear form, and note that {{mvar|D}} is the direct sum of {{math|'''R'''}} and {{mvar|V}} as vector spaces.\n\n===The finish===\nFor {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|V}} define {{math|''B''(''a'', ''b'') {{=}} (−''ab'' − ''ba'')/2}}. Because of the identity {{math|(''a'' + ''b'')<sup>2</sup> − ''a''<sup>2</sup> − ''b''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''ab'' + ''ba''}}, it follows that {{math|''B''(''a'', ''b'')}} is real. Furthermore, since {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> ≤ 0}}, we have: {{math|''B''(''a'', ''a'') > 0}} for {{math|''a'' ≠ 0}}. Thus {{mvar|B}} is a [[definite bilinear form|positive definite]] [[symmetric bilinear form]], in other words, an [[inner product]] on {{mvar|V}}.\n\nLet {{mvar|W}} be a subspace of {{mvar|V}} that generates {{mvar|D}} as an algebra and which is minimal with respect to this property. Let {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e<sub>n</sub>''}} be an [[orthonormal basis]] of {{mvar|W}} with respect to {{math|''B''}}. Then orthonormality implies that:\n\n:<math>e_i^2 =-1, \\quad e_i e_j = - e_j e_i.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, then {{mvar|D}} is [[isomorphic]] to {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n'' {{=}} 1}}, then {{mvar|D}} is generated by {{math|1}} and {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>}} subject to the relation {{math|''e''{{su|b=1|p=2}} {{=}} −1}}. Hence it is isomorphic to {{math|'''C'''}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n'' {{=}} 2}}, it has been shown above that {{mvar|D}} is generated by {{math|1, ''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>}} subject to the relations \n:<math>e_1^2 = e_2^2 =-1, \\quad e_1 e_2 = - e_2 e_1, \\quad (e_1 e_2)(e_1 e_2) =-1.</math>\nThese are precisely the relations for {{math|'''H'''}}.\n\nIf {{math|''n'' > 2}}, then {{mvar|D}} cannot be a division algebra.  Assume that {{math|''n'' > 2}}. Let {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>''e<sub>n</sub>''}}. It is easy to see that {{math|''u''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} (this only works if {{math|''n'' > 2}}). If {{mvar|D}} were a division algebra, {{math|0 {{=}} ''u''<sup>2</sup> − 1 {{=}} (''u'' − 1)(''u'' + 1)}} implies {{math|''u'' {{=}} ±1}}, which in turn means: {{math|''e<sub>n</sub>'' {{=}} ∓''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>}} and so {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''−1</sub>}} generate {{mvar|D}}. This contradicts the minimality of {{mvar|W}}.\n\n==Remarks and related results==\n*The fact that {{mvar|D}} is generated by {{math|''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e<sub>n</sub>''}} subject to the above relations means that {{mvar|D}} is the [[Clifford algebra]] of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. The last step shows that the only real Clifford algebras which are division algebras are {{math|Cℓ<sup>0</sup>, Cℓ<sup>1</sup>}} and {{math|Cℓ<sup>2</sup>}}.\n*As a consequence, the only [[commutative]] division algebras are {{math|'''R'''}} and {{math|'''C'''}}. Also note that {{math|'''H'''}} is not a {{math|'''C'''}}-algebra. If it were, then the center of {{math|'''H'''}} has to contain {{math|'''C'''}}, but the center of {{math|'''H'''}} is {{math|'''R'''}}. Therefore, the only finite-dimensional division algebra over {{math|'''C'''}} is {{math|'''C'''}} itself.\n* This theorem is closely related to [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]], which states that the only real [[normed division algebra]]s are {{math|'''R''', '''C''', '''H'''}}, and the (non-associative) algebra [[octonions|{{math|'''O'''}}]].\n* '''Pontryagin variant.''' If {{mvar|D}} is a [[connected space|connected]], [[locally compact space|locally compact]] division [[topological ring|ring]], then {{math|''D'' {{=}} '''R''', '''C'''}}, or {{math|'''H'''}}.\n\n==References==\n* Ray E.

It characterizes certain abelian categories (the [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]]) as [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotients]] of [[module categories]].\n\nThere are several generalizations and variations of the Gabriel–Popescu theorem, given by {{harvtxt|Kuhn|1994}} (for an [[AB5 category]] with a set of [[Generator (category theory)|generators]]), {{harvtxt|Lowen|2004}}, {{harvtxt|Porta|2010}} (for [[triangulated categories]]).\n\n==Theorem==\nLet ''A'' be a [[Grothendieck category]] (an [[AB5 category]] with a generator), ''G'' a generator of ''A'' and ''R'' be the [[endomorphism ring|ring of endomorphisms]] of ''G''; also, let ''S'' be the\n[[functor]] from ''A'' to Mod-''R'' (the category of right ''R''-modules) defined by ''S''(''X'') = Hom(''G'',''X'').

They are due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]].\n\nGeneric flatness states that if ''Y'' is an integral locally noetherian scheme, {{nowrap|''u'' : ''X'' &rarr; ''Y''}} is a finite type morphism of schemes, and ''F'' is a coherent ''O''<sub>''X''</sub>-module, then there is a non-empty open subset ''U'' of ''Y'' such that the restriction of ''F'' to ''u''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''U'') is flat over ''U''.<ref>EGA IV<sub>2</sub>, Théorème 6.9.1</ref>\n\nBecause ''Y'' is integral, ''U'' is a dense open subset of ''Y''.

Generic freeness states that if ''A'' is a [[noetherian ring|noetherian]] [[integral domain]], ''B'' is a finite type ''A''-algebra, and ''M'' is a finite type ''B''-module, then there exists a non-zero element ''f'' of ''A'' such that ''M''<sub>''f''</sub> is a free ''A''<sub>''f''</sub>-module.<ref>EGA IV<sub>2</sub>, Lemme 6.9.2</ref> Generic freeness can be extended to the graded situation: If ''B'' is graded by the natural numbers, ''A'' acts in degree zero, and ''M'' is a graded ''B''-module, then ''f'' may be chosen such that each graded component of ''M''<sub>''f''</sub> is free.<ref>Eisenbud, Theorem 14.4</ref>\n\nGeneric freeness is proved using Grothendieck's technique of [[dévissage]].

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''Goldie's theorem''' is a basic structural result in [[ring theory]], proved by [[Alfred Goldie]] during the 1950s. What is now termed a right '''Goldie ring''' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' that has finite [[uniform dimension]] (=\"finite rank\") as a right module over itself, and satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]] on right [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]]s of subsets of ''R''. \n\nGoldie's theorem states that the [[semiprime ring|semiprime]] right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a [[semisimple ring|semisimple]] [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] right [[classical ring of quotients]].  The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].\n\nIn particular, Goldie's theorem applies to semiprime right [[Noetherian ring]]s, since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on ''all'' right ideals. This is sufficient to guarantee that a right-Noetherian ring is right Goldie.  The converse does not hold: every right [[Ore domain]] is a right Goldie domain, and hence so is every commutative [[integral domain]].\n\nA consequence of Goldie's theorem, again due to Goldie, is that every semiprime [[principal right ideal ring]] is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of [[prime ring|prime]] principal right ideal rings.  Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a [[matrix ring]] over a right Ore domain.\n\n==Sketch of the proof==\nThis is a sketch of the characterization mentioned in the introduction.

      "text": "{{short description|Polynomial rings are Noetherian rings}}\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically [[commutative algebra]], '''Hilbert's basis theorem''' says that a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[Noetherian ring]] is Noetherian.\n\n==Statement==\n\nIf <math>R</math> is a ring, let <math>R[X]</math> denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate <math>X</math> over <math>R</math>. [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] proved that if <math>R</math> is \"not too large\", in the sense that if <math>R</math> is Noetherian, the same must be true for <math>R[X]</math>. Formally,\n\n<blockquote>'''Hilbert's Basis Theorem.''' If <math>R</math> is a Noetherian ring, then <math>R[X]</math> is a Noetherian ring.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>'''Corollary.''' If <math>R</math> is a Noetherian ring, then <math>R[X_1,\\dotsc,X_n]</math> is a Noetherian ring.</blockquote>\n\nThis can be translated into [[algebraic geometry]] as follows: every [[algebraic set]] over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=David Hilbert|last=Hilbert|year=1890}} proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.\n\nHilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using [[mathematical induction]]; his method does not give an [[algorithm]] to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]].\n\n==Proof==\n:'''Theorem.''' If <math>R</math> is a left (resp. right) [[Noetherian ring]], then the [[polynomial ring]] <math>R[X]</math> is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.\n\n'''Remark.''' We will give two proofs, in both only the \"left\" case is considered; the proof for the right case is similar.\n\n===First Proof===\n\nSuppose <math>\\mathfrak a \\subseteq R[X]</math> is a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the [[axiom of dependent choice]]) there is a sequence <math>\\{ f_0, f_1, \\ldots \\}</math> of polynomials such that if <math>\\mathfrak b_n</math> is the left ideal generated by <math>f_0, \\ldots, f_{n-1}</math> then <math>f_n \\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak b_n</math> is of minimal degree. It is clear that <math>\\{\\deg(f_0), \\deg(f_1), \\ldots \\}</math> is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let <math>a_n</math> be the leading coefficient of <math>f_n</math> and let <math>\\mathfrak{b}</math> be the left ideal in <math>R</math> generated by <math>a_0,a_1,\\ldots</math>. Since <math>R</math> is Noetherian the chain of ideals\n\n:<math>(a_0)\\subset(a_0,a_1)\\subset(a_0,a_1,a_2) \\subset \\cdots</math>\n\nmust terminate. Thus <math>\\mathfrak b = (a_0,\\ldots ,a_{N-1})</math> for some integer <math>N</math>. So in particular,\n\n:<math>a_N=\\sum_{i<N} u_{i}a_{i}, \\qquad u_i \\in R.</math>\n\nNow consider\n\n:<math>g = \\sum_{i<N}u_{i}X^{\\deg(f_{N})-\\deg(f_{i})}f_{i},</math>\n\nwhose leading term is equal to that of <math>f_N</math>; moreover, <math>g\\in\\mathfrak b_N</math>. However, <math>f_N \\notin \\mathfrak b_N</math>, which means that <math>f_N - g \\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak b_N</math> has degree less than <math>f_N</math>, contradicting the minimality.\n\n===Second Proof=== \nLet <math>\\mathfrak a \\subseteq R[X]</math> be a left-ideal. Let <math>\\mathfrak b</math> be the set of leading coefficients of members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>. This is obviously a left-ideal over <math>R</math>, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>; say <math>f_0,\\ldots, f_{N-1}</math>. Let <math>d</math> be the maximum of the set <math>\\{\\deg(f_0),\\ldots, \\deg(f_{N-1})\\}</math>, and let <math>\\mathfrak b_k</math> be the set of leading coefficients of members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>, whose degree is <math>{}\\le k</math>. As before, the <math>\\mathfrak b_k</math> are left-ideals over <math>R</math>, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of <math>\\mathfrak a</math>, say\n\n:<math>f^{(k)}_{0}, \\ldots, f^{(k)}_{N^{(k)}-1}</math>\n\nwith degrees <math>{}\\le k</math>. Now let <math>\\mathfrak a^*\\subseteq R[X]</math> be the left-ideal generated by:\n\n:<math>\\left \\{f_{i},f^{(k)}_{j} \\ : \\ i<N,j<N^{(k)},k<d \\right \\}.</math>\n\nWe have <math>\\mathfrak a^*\\subseteq\\mathfrak a</math> and claim also <math>\\mathfrak a\\subseteq\\mathfrak a^*</math>. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let <math>h\\in \\mathfrak a \\setminus \\mathfrak a^*</math> be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by <math>a</math>.\n\n:'''Case 1:''' <math>\\deg(h)\\ge d</math>. Regardless of this condition, we have <math>a\\in \\mathfrak b</math>, so is a left-linear combination\n\n::<math>a=\\sum_j u_j a_j</math>\n\n:of the coefficients of the <math>f_j</math>. Consider\n\n::<math>h_0 \\triangleq\\sum_{j}u_{j}X^{\\deg(h)-\\deg(f_{j})}f_{j},</math>\n\n:which has the same leading term as <math>h</math>; moreover <math>h_0 \\in \\mathfrak a^*</math> while <math>h\\notin\\mathfrak a^*</math>. Therefore <math>h - h_0 \\in \\mathfrak a\\setminus\\mathfrak a^*</math> and <math>\\deg(h - h_0) < \\deg(h)</math>, which contradicts minimality.\n\n:'''Case 2:''' <math>\\deg(h) = k < d</math>. Then <math>a\\in\\mathfrak b_k</math> so is a left-linear combination\n\n::<math>a=\\sum_j u_j a^{(k)}_j</math>\n\n:of the leading coefficients of the <math>f^{(k)}_j</math>. Considering\n\n::<math>h_0 \\triangleq\\sum_j u_j X^{\\deg(h)-\\deg(f^{(k)}_{j})}f^{(k)}_{j},</math>\n\n:we yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1.\n\nThus our claim holds, and <math>\\mathfrak a = \\mathfrak a^*</math> which is finitely generated.\n\nNote that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of <math>X</math> multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.\n\n== Applications ==\nLet <math>R</math> be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.\n\n#By induction we see that <math>R[X_0,\\dotsc,X_{n-1}]</math> will also be Noetherian. \n#Since any [[affine variety]] over <math>R^n</math> (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal <math>\\mathfrak a\\subset R[X_0, \\dotsc, X_{n-1}]</math> and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many [[hypersurface]]s. \n#If <math>A</math> is a finitely-generated <math>R</math>-algebra, then we know that <math>A \\simeq R[X_0, \\dotsc, X_{n-1}] / \\mathfrak a</math>, where <math>\\mathfrak a</math> is an ideal.

As the relations form a module, one may consider the relations between the relations; Hilbert's syzygy theorem asserts that, if one continues in this way, starting with a module over a polynomial ring in {{math|''n''}} indeterminates over a field, one eventually finds a [[zero module]] of relations, after at most {{math|''n''}} steps.\n\nHilbert's syzygy theorem is now considered to be an early result of [[homological algebra]]. It is the starting point of the use of homological methods in [[commutative algebra]] and algebraic geometry.\n\n==History==\nThe syzygy theorem first appeared in Hilbert's seminal paper \"Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen\" (1890).<ref>D. Hilbert, Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen, Mathematische Annalen 36, 473–530.</ref> The paper is split into five parts: part I proves Hilbert's basis theorem over a field, while part II proves it over the integers. Part III contains the syzygy theorem (Theorem III), which is used in part IV to discuss the Hilbert polynomial. The last part, part V, proves finite generation of certain [[Invariant theory|rings of invariants]]. Incidentally part III also contains a special case of the [[Hilbert–Burch theorem]].\n\n==Syzygies (relations)==\nOriginally, Hilbert defined syzygies for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[polynomial ring]]s, but the concept generalizes trivially to (left) [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over any [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].\n\nGiven a [[generating set of a module|generating set]] <math>g_1, \\ldots, g_k</math> of a module {{math|''M''}} over a ring {{math|''R''}}, a '''relation''' or first '''syzygy''' between the generators is a {{math|''k''}}-tuple <math>(a_1, \\ldots, a_k)</math> of elements of {{math|''R''}} such that<ref>The theory is presented for [[finitely generated module]]s, but extends easily to arbitrary modules.</ref>\n:<math>a_1g_1 + \\cdots + a_kg_k =0.</math>\nLet <math>L_0</math> be the [[free module]] with basis <math>(G_1, \\ldots, G_k),</math> the relation <math>(a_1, \\ldots, a_k)</math> may be identified with the element \n:<math>a_1G_1 + \\cdots + a_kG_k,</math>\nand the relations form the [[kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] <math>R_1</math> of the [[linear map]] <math>L_0 \\to M</math> defined by <math>G_i \\mapsto g_i.</math> In other words, one has an [[exact sequence]]\n:<math>0 \\to R_1 \\to L_0 \\to M \\to 0.</math>\n\nThis first syzygy module <math>R_1</math> depends on the choice of a generating set, but, if <math>S_1</math> is the module which is obtained with another generating set, there exist two free modules <math>F_1</math> and <math>F_2</math> such that \n:<math>R_1 \\oplus F_1 \\cong S_1 \\oplus F_2</math>\nwhere <math>\\oplus</math> denote the [[direct sum of modules]].\n\nThe ''second syzygy'' module is the module of the relations between generators of the first syzygy module. By continuing in this way, one may define the ''{{math|k}}th syzygy module'' for every positive integer {{math|''k''}}.\n\nIf the {{math|''k''}}th syzygy module is free for some {{math|''k''}}, then by taking a basis as a generating set, the next syzygy module (and every subsequent one) is the [[zero module]]. If one does not take a bases as generating sets, then all subsequent syzygy modules are free.\n\nLet {{math|''n''}} be the smallest integer, if any, such that the {{math|''n''}}th syzygy module of a module {{math|''M''}} is free or [[projective module|projective]]. The above property of invariance, up to the sum direct with free modules, implies that {{math|''n''}} does not depend on the choice of generating sets. The [[projective dimension]] of {{math|''M''}} is this integer, if it exists, or {{math|∞}} if not. This is equivalent with the existence of an exact sequence\n:<math>0 \\longrightarrow R_n \\longrightarrow L_{n-1} \\longrightarrow \\cdots \\longrightarrow L_0 \\longrightarrow M \\longrightarrow 0,</math>\nwhere the modules <math>L_i</math> are free and <math>R_n</math> is projective. It can be shown that one may always choose the generating sets for <math>R_n</math> being free, that is for the above exact sequence to be a [[free resolution]].\n\n== Statement ==\nHilbert's syzygy theorem states that, if {{math|''M''}} is a finitely generated module over a [[polynomial ring]] <math>k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math> in {{math|''n''}} [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}}, then the {{math|''n''}}th syzygy module of {{math|''M''}} is always a [[free module]].\n\nIn modern language, this implies that the [[projective dimension]] of {{math|''M''}} is at most {{math|''n''}}, and thus that there exists a [[free resolution]] \n:<math>0 \\longrightarrow L_k \\longrightarrow L_{k-1} \\longrightarrow \\cdots \\longrightarrow L_0 \\longrightarrow M \\longrightarrow 0</math>\nof length {{math|''k'' ≤ ''n''}}.\n\nThis upper bound on the projective dimension is sharp, that is, there are modules of projective dimension exactly {{math|''n''}}. The standard example is the field {{math|''k''}}, which may be considered as a <math>k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math>-module by setting <math>x_i c=0</math> for every {{math|''i''}} and every {{math|''c'' ∈ ''k''}}. For this module, the {{math|''n''}}th syzygy module is free, but not the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}th one (for a proof, see {{slink||Koszul complex}}, below).\n\nThe theorem is also true for modules that are not finitely generated. As the [[global dimension]] of a ring is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules, Hilbert's syzygy theorem may be restated as: ''the global dimension of <math>k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math> is {{math|n}}''.\n\n=== Low dimension ===\n\nIn the case of zero indeterminates, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is simply the fact that every [[vector space]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]].\n\nIn the case of a single indeterminate, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is an instance of the theorem asserting that over a [[principal ideal ring]], every submodule of a free module is itself free.\n\n== Koszul complex ==\n\nThe [[Koszul complex]], also called \"complex of exterior algebra\", allows, in some cases, an explicit description of all syzygy modules.\n\nLet <math>g_1, \\ldots, g_k</math> be a generating system of an ideal {{math|''I''}} in a polynomial ring <math>R=k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math>, and let <math>L_1</math> be a [[free module]] of basis <math>G_1, \\ldots, G_k.</math> The [[exterior algebra]] of <math>L_1</math> is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]\n:<math>\\Lambda(L_1)=\\bigoplus_{t=0}^k L_t,</math>\nwhere <math>L_t</math> is the free module, which has, as a basis, the [[exterior product]]s\n:<math>G_{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge G_{i_t},</math>\nsuch that <math>i_1< i_2<\\cdots <i_t.</math> In particular, one has <math>L_0=R</math> (because of the definition of the [[empty product]]), the two definitions of <math>L_1</math> coincide, and <math>L_t=0</math> for {{math|''t'' > ''k''}}. For every positive {{math|''t''}}, one may define a linear map <math>L_t\\to L_{t-1}</math> by\n\n:<math>G_{i_1} \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge G_{i_t} \\mapsto \\sum_{j=1}^t (-1)^{j+1}g_{i_j}G_{i_1}\\wedge \\cdots\\wedge \\widehat{G}_{i_j} \\wedge \\cdots\\wedge G_{i_t}, </math>\nwhere the hat means that the factor is omitted. A straightforward computation shows that the composition of two consecutive such maps is zero, and thus that one has a [[chain complex|complex]]\n:<math>0\\to L_t \\to L_{t-1} \\to \\cdots \\to L_1 \\to L_0 \\to R/I.</math>\n\nThis is the ''Koszul complex''. In general the Koszul complex is not an [[exact sequence]], but ''it is an exact sequence if one works with a polynomial ring'' <math>R=k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math> ''and an ideal generated by a [[regular sequence]] of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s.''\n\nIn particular, the sequence <math>x_1,\\ldots,x_n</math> is regular, and the Koszul complex is thus a projective resolution of <math></math><math>k=R/\\langle x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\rangle.</math> In this case, the {{math|''n''}}th syzygy module is free of dimension one (generated by the product of all <math>G_i</math>); the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}th syzygy module is thus the quotient of a free module of dimension {{math|''n''}} by the submodule generated by <math>(x_1, -x_2, \\ldots, \\pm x_n).</math> This quotient may not be a [[projective module]], as otherwise, there would exist polynomials <math>p_i</math> such that <math>p_1x_1 + \\cdots +p_nx_n=1,</math> which is impossible (substituting the <math>x_i</math> by 0 in the latter equality provides {{math|1=1 = 0}}). This proves that the projective dimension of <math>k=R/\\langle x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\rangle</math> is exactly {{math|''n''}}.\n\nThe same proof applies for proving that the projective dimension of <math>k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n]/\\langle g_1, \\ldots, g_t\\rangle</math> is exactly {{math|''t''}} if the <math>g_i</math> form a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.\n\n==Computation==\nAt Hilbert's time, there were no method available for computing syzygies. It was only known that an [[algorithm]] may be deduced from any upper bound of the [[total degree|degree]] of the generators of the module of syzygies. In fact, the coefficients of the syzygies are unknown polynomials. If the degree of these polynomials is bounded, the number of their [[monomial]]s is also bounded.  Expressing that one has a syzygy provides a [[system of linear equations]] whose unknowns are the coefficients of these monomials. Therefore, any algorithm for linear systems implies an algorithm for syzygies, as soon as a bound of the degrees is known.\n\nThe first bound for syzygies (as well as for [[ideal membership problem]]) was given in 1926 by [[Grete Hermann]]:<ref>Grete Hermann: ''Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale. Unter Benutzung nachgelassener Sätze von K. Hentzelt'', Mathematische Annalen, Volume 95, Number 1, 736-788, {{doi|10.1007/BF01206635}} ([http://www.springerlink.com/content/uh1638th08671441/ abstract] in German language) — ''The question of finitely many steps in polynomial ideal theory'' [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=307342 (review and English-language translation)]</ref> Let {{math|''M''}} a submodule of a free module {{math|''L''}} of dimension {{math|''t''}} over <math>k[x_1, \\ldots, x_n];</math> if the coefficients over a basis of {{math|''L''}} of a generating system of {{math|''M''}} have a total degree at most {{math|''d''}}, then there is a constant {{math|''c''}} such that the degrees occurring in a generating system of the first syzygy module is at most <math>(td)^{2^{cn}}.</math> The same bound applies for testing the membership to {{math|''M''}} of an element of {{math|''L''}}.<ref>G. Hermann claimed {{math|1=''c'' = 1}}, but did not prove this.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are examples where a [[double exponential function|double exponential]] degree necessarily occurs. However such examples are extremely rare, and this sets the question of an algorithm that is efficient when the output is not too large. At the present time, the best algorithms for computing syzygies are [[Gröbner basis]] algorithms. They allow the computation of the first syzygy module, and also, with almost no extra cost, all syzygies modules.\n\n==Syzygies and regularity==\nOne might wonder which ring-theoretic property of <math>A=k[x_1,\\ldots,x_n]</math> causes the Hilbert syzygy theorem to hold. It turns out that \nthis is [[Regular ring|regularity]], which is an algebraic formulation of the fact that affine {{math|''n''}}-space is a variety without [[Singularity (mathematics)|singularities]]. In fact the following generalization holds: Let <math>A</math> be a Noetherian ring. Then <math>A</math> has finite global dimension if and only if <math>A</math> is regular and the Krull dimension of <math>A</math> is finite; in that case the global dimension of <math>A</math> is equal to the Krull dimension. This result may be proven using [[Regular local ring#Origin of basic notions|Serre's theorem on regular local rings]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Quillen–Suslin theorem]]\n* [[Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [[David Eisenbud]], ''Commutative algebra.

      "text": "In the branch of [[abstract algebra]] called [[ring theory]], the '''Akizuki–Hopkins–Levitzki theorem''' connects the [[descending chain condition]] and [[ascending chain condition]] in [[Module (mathematics)|modules]] over semiprimary rings.  A ring ''R'' (with&nbsp;1) is called '''semiprimary''' if ''R''/''J''(''R'') is [[semisimple algebra|semisimple]] and ''J''(''R'') is a [[nilpotent ideal]], where ''J''(''R'') denotes the [[Jacobson radical]].  The theorem states that if ''R'' is a semiprimary ring and ''M'' is an ''R'' module, the three module conditions [[noetherian module|Noetherian]], [[artinian module|Artinian]] and \"has a [[composition series]]\" are equivalent.  Without the semiprimary condition, the only true implication is that if ''M'' has a composition series, then ''M'' is both Noetherian and Artinian.\n\nThe theorem takes its current form from a paper by Charles Hopkins and a paper by [[Jacob Levitzki]], both in 1939.  For this reason it is often cited as the '''Hopkins–Levitzki theorem'''.  However [[Yasuo Akizuki]] is sometimes included since he proved the result<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Akizuki|first=Yasuo|date=1935|title=Teilerkettensatz und Vielfachensatz|journal=Proc. Phys.-Math.

The analogous statement for left Artinian rings holds as well. This is not true in general for Artinian modules, because there are [[Artinian module#Relation to the Noetherian condition|examples of Artinian modules which are not Noetherian]].   \n   \nAnother direct corollary is that if ''R'' is right Artinian, then ''R'' is left Artinian if and only if it is left Noetherian.\n\n== Sketch of proof ==\nHere is the proof of the following: Let ''R'' be a semiprimary ring and ''M'' a left ''R''-module. If ''M'' is either Artinian or Noetherian, then ''M'' has a composition series.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|2003|loc=Theorem 5.3.9}}</ref> (The converse of this is true over any ring.)\n\nLet ''J'' be the radical of ''R''. Set <math>F_i = J^{i-1}M/J^iM</math>. The ''R'' module <math>F_i</math> may then be viewed as an <math>R/J</math>-module because ''J'' is contained in the [[annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of <math>F_i</math>. Each <math>F_i</math> is a [[semisimple module|semisimple]] <math>R/J</math>-module, because <math>R/J</math> is a semisimple ring. Furthermore, since ''J'' is nilpotent, only finitely many of the <math>F_i</math> are nonzero. If ''M'' is Artinian (or Noetherian), then <math>F_i</math> has a finite composition series.  Stacking the composition series from the <math>F_i</math> end to end, we obtain a composition series for ''M''.\n\n==In Grothendieck categories==\nSeveral generalizations and extensions of the theorem exist.

There are moreover natural inclusions {{math|'''R''' ⊂ '''C''' ⊂ '''H'''}}.\n\nAnalysing such an inclusion leads to the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]], formalized by [[Abraham Adrian Albert|A.A. Albert]]. Let {{mvar|A}} be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and {{mvar|B}} a proper unital subalgebra, so a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra in its own right. Pick a [[unit vector]] {{mvar|j}} in {{mvar|A}} orthogonal to {{mvar|B}}. Since {{math|1=(''j'', 1) = 0}}, it follows that {{math|1=''j''* = −''j''}} and hence {{math|1=''j''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}. Let {{mvar|C}} be subalgebra generated by {{mvar|B}} and {{mvar|j}}. It is unital and is again a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra. It satisfies the following [[Cayley–Dickson construction|'''Cayley–Dickson multiplication laws''']]:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{C=B\\oplus Bj, \\,\\,\\, (a+bj)^*=a^* - bj, \\,\\,\\, (a+bj)(c+dj)=(ac -d^*b) +(bc^*+da)j.}</math>\n\nTo check this note that {{mvar|B}} and {{math|''B j''}} are orthogonal, since {{mvar|j}} is orthogonal to {{mvar|B}}. If {{mvar|a}} is in {{mvar|B}}, then {{math|1=''j a'' = ''a''* ''j''}}, since by orthogonal {{math|1=0 = 2 (''j'', ''a''*) = ''j a'' − ''a''* ''j''}}. The formula for the involution follows. To show that {{math|''B'' ⊕ ''B j''}} is closed under multiplication note that {{math|1=''Bj'' = ''j B''}}.

Taking {{math|1='''O''' = '''H''' ⊕ '''H'''}} with the product and inner product above gives a noncommutative nonassociative algebra generated by {{math|1='''J''' = (0, 1)}}. This recovers the usual definition of the [[octonion]]s or [[Cayley number]]s. If {{mvar|A}} is a Euclidean algebra, it must contain {{math|'''R'''}}. If it is strictly larger than {{math|'''R'''}}, the argument above shows that it contains {{math|'''C'''}}. If it is larger than {{math|'''C'''}}, it contains {{math|'''H'''}}. If it is larger still, it must contain {{math|'''O'''}}. But there the process must stop, because {{math|'''O'''}} is not associative. In fact {{math|'''H'''}} is not commutative and {{math|1=''a''(''b j'') = (''b a'') ''j'' ≠ (''a b'')''j''}} in {{math|1='''O'''}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=81–86}}</ref>\n\n'''{{smallcaps|Theorem.}}''' The only Euclidean Hurwitz algebras are the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions.\n\n==Other proofs==\nThe proofs of {{harvtxt|Lee|1948}} and {{harvtxt|Chevalley|1954}} use [[Clifford algebra]]s to show that the dimension {{mvar|N}} of {{mvar|A}} must be 1, 2, 4 or 8. In fact the operators {{math|''L''(''a'')}} with {{math|1=(''a'', 1) = 0}} satisfy {{math|1=''L''(''a'')<sup>2</sup> = −‖ ''a'' ‖<sup>2</sup>}} and so form a real Clifford algebra. If {{mvar|a}} is a unit vector, then {{math|''L''(''a'')}} is skew-adjoint with square {{math|−''I''}}. So {{mvar|N}} must be [[even number|even]].  The real Clifford algebra and its [[complexification]] act on the complexification of {{mvar|A}}, an {{mvar|N}}-dimensional complex space. Since {{mvar|N}} is even, {{math|''N'' − 1}} is odd, so the Clifford algebra has exactly two complex [[irreducible representation]]s of dimension {{math|2<sup>''N''/2 − 1</sup>}}. So this [[power of 2]] must divide {{mvar|N}}. It is easy to see that this implies {{mvar|N}} can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8.\n\nThe proof of {{harvtxt|Eckmann|1954}} uses the representation theory of finite groups, or the projective representation theory of elementary Abelian 2-groups, known to be equivalent to the representation theory of real Clifford algebras. Indeed, taking an orthonormal basis {{math|''e''<sub>''i''</sub>}} of the orthogonal complement of 1 gives rise to operators {{math|1=''U''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''L''(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>)}}\nsatisfying\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{U_i^2=-I,\\,\\,\\, U_iU_j=-U_jU_i \\,\\, (i\\ne j).}</math>\n\nThis is a [[projective representation]] of a direct product of {{math|''N'' − 1}} groups of order 2. ({{mvar|N}} is assumed to be greater than 1.) The operators {{math|''U''<sub>''i''</sub>}} by construction are skew-symmetric and orthogonal. In fact Eckmann constructed operators of this type in a slightly different but equivalent way. It is in fact the method originally followed in {{harvtxt|Hurwitz|1923}}.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Hurwitz|1923|p=11}}\n*{{harvnb|Herstein|1968|pp=141–144}}</ref> Assume that there is a composition law for two forms\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(x_1^2 + \\cdots +x_N^2)(y_1^2 + \\cdots + y_N^2) =z_1^2 + \\cdots + z_N^2,}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''z''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is bilinear in {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}}. Thus\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{z_i=\\sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij}(x)y_j}</math>\n\nwhere the matrix {{math|1=''T''(''x'') = (''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>)}} is linear in {{mvar|x}}. The relations above are equivalent to\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{T(x)T(x)^t=x_1^2 +\\cdots + x_N^2.}</math>\n\nWriting\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{T(x)=T_1x_1 + \\cdots + T_Nx_N,}</math>\n\nthe relations become\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{T_iT^t_j+T_jT_i^t =2\\delta_{ij}I.}</math>\n\nNow set {{math|1=''V''<sub>''i''</sub> = (''T''<sub>''N''</sub>)<sup>''t''</sup> ''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}}. Thus {{math|1=''V''<sub>''N''</sub> = ''I''}} and the {{math|''V''<sub>1</sub>, ... , ''V''<sub>''N'' − 1</sub>}} are skew-adjoint, orthogonal satisfying exactly the same relations as the {{math|''U''<sub>''i''</sub>}}'s:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{V_i^2=-I,\\,\\,\\, V_iV_j=-V_jV_i \\,\\, (i\\ne j).}</math>\n\nSince {{math|''V''<sub>''i''</sub>}} is an orthogonal matrix with square {{math|−''I''}} on a real vector space, {{mvar|N}} is even.\n\nLet {{mvar|G}} be the finite group generated by elements {{math|''v''<sub>''i''</sub>}} such that\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{v_i^2=\\varepsilon,\\,\\,\\, v_iv_j=\\varepsilon v_jv_i \\,\\, (i\\ne j),}</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|ε}} is central of order 2. The commutator subgroup {{math|[''G'', ''G'']}} is just formed of 1 and {{mvar|ε}}. If {{mvar|N}} is odd this coincides with the center while if {{mvar|N}} is even the center has order 4 with extra elements {{math|1=γ = ''v''<sub>1</sub> ... ''v''<sub>''N'' − 1</sub>}} and {{math|''ε'' γ}}. If {{mvar|g}} in {{mvar|G}} is not in the center its conjugacy class is exactly {{mvar|g}} and {{math|''ε g''}}. Thus there are\n{{math|2<sup>''N'' − 1 </sup> + 1}} conjugacy classes for {{mvar|N}} odd and {{math|2<sup>''N'' − 1 </sup> + 2}} for {{mvar|N}} even. {{mvar|G}} has {{math|1={{!}} {{mvar|G}} / [''G'', ''G''] {{!}} = 2<sup>''N'' − 1</sup>}} 1-dimensional complex representations. The total number of irreducible complex representations is the number of conjugacy classes. So since {{mvar|N}} is even, there are two further irreducible complex representations. Since the sum of the squares of the dimensions equals {{math|{{!}} ''G'' {{!}}}} and the dimensions divide {{math|{{!}} ''G'' {{!}}}}, the two irreducibles must have dimension {{math|2<sup>(''N'' − 2)/2</sup>}}. When {{mvar|N}} is even, there are two and their dimension must divide the order of the group, so is a power of two, so they must both have dimension {{math|2<sup>(''N'' − 2)/2</sup>}}. The space on which the {{math|''V''<sub>''i''</sub>}}'s act can be complexified. It will have complex dimension {{mvar|N}}. It breaks up into some of complex irreducible representations of {{mvar|G}}, all having dimension {{math|2<sup>(''N'' − 2)/2</sup>}}. In particular this dimension is {{math|≤ ''N''}}, so {{mvar|N}} is less than or equal to 8. If {{math|1=''N'' = 6}}, the dimension is 4, which does not divide 6. So ''N'' can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8.\n\n==Applications to Jordan algebras==\nLet {{mvar|A}} be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and let {{math|''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} be the algebra of {{mvar|n}}-by-{{mvar|n}} matrices over {{mvar|A}}. It is a unital nonassociative algebra with an involution given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{(x_{ij})^*=(x_{ji}^*).}</math>\n\nThe trace {{math|Tr(''X'')}} is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of {{mvar|X}} and the real-valued trace by\n{{math|1=Tr<sub>'''R'''</sub>(''X'') = Re Tr(''X'')}}. The real-valued trace satisfies:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathbf{R}} XY = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathbf{R}} YX, \\qquad \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathbf{R}} (XY)Z = \\operatorname{Tr}_{\\mathbf{R}} X(YZ). </math>\n\nThese are immediate consequences of the known identities for {{math|1=''n'' = 1}}.\n\nIn {{mvar|A}} define the ''[[associator]]'' by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[a,b,c]=a(bc) - (ab)c.}</math>\n\nIt is trilinear and vanishes identically if {{mvar|A}} is associative. Since {{mvar|A}} is an alternating algebra\n{{math|1=[''a'', ''a'', ''b''] = 0}} and {{math|1=[''b'', ''a'', ''a''] = 0}}. Polarizing it follows that the associator is antisymmetric in its three entries. Note also that {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} or {{mvar|c}} lie in {{math|'''R'''}} then the {{math|1=[''a'', ''b'', ''c''] = 0}}. This implies that {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub>(''A'')}} has certain commutation properties. In fact if {{mvar|X}} is a matrix in {{math|''M''<sub>3</sub>(''A'')}} with real entries on the diagonal then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[X,X^2]=aI,}</math>\n\nwith {{mvar|a}} in {{mvar|A}}. In fact if {{math|1=''Y'' = [''X'', ''X''<sup>2</sup>]}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{y_{ij}=\\sum_{k,\\ell} [x_{ik},x_{k\\ell},x_{\\ell j}].}</math>\n\nSince the diagonal entries of {{mvar|X}} are real, the off diagonal entries of {{mvar|Y}} vanish. Each diagonal\nentry of {{mvar|Y}} is a sum of two associators involving only off diagonal terms of {{mvar|X}}. Since the associators are invariant under cyclic permutations, the diagonal entries of {{mvar|Y}} are all equal.\n\nLet {{math|''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} be the space of self-adjoint elements in {{math|''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} with product {{math|1=''X''∘''Y'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}(''X Y'' + ''Y X'')}} and inner product {{math|1=(''X'', ''Y'') = Tr<sub>'''R'''</sub>(''X Y'')}}.\n\n'''{{smallcaps|Theorem.}}''' {{math|''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} is a [[Euclidean Jordan algebra]] if {{mvar|A}} is associative (the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions) and {{math|1=''n'' ≥ 3}} or if {{mvar|A}} is nonassociative (the octonions) and {{math|1=''n'' = 3}}.\n\nThe [[exceptional object|exceptional]] Jordan algebra {{math|''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''')}} is called the '''[[Albert algebra]]''' after [[Abraham Adrian Albert|A.A. Albert]].\n\nTo check that {{math|''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} satisfies the axioms for a Euclidean Jordan algebra, note that the real trace defines a symmetric bilinear form with {{math|1=(''X'', ''X'') = ∑ ‖ ''x''<sub>''ij''</sub> ‖<sup>2</sup>}}. So it is an inner product. It satisfies the associativity property {{math|1=(''Z''∘''X'', ''Y'') = (''X'', ''Z''∘''Y'')}} because of the properties of the real trace. The main axiom to check is the Jordan condition for the operators {{math|''L''(''X'')}} defined by {{math|1=''L''(''X'')''Y'' = ''X''∘''Y''}}:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{[L(X),L(X^2)]=0.}</math>\n\nThis is easy to check when {{mvar|A}} is associative, since {{math|''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} is an associative algebra so a Jordan algebra with {{math|1=''X''∘''Y'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}(''X Y'' + ''Y X'')}}. When {{math|1=''A'' = '''O'''}} and {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} a special argument is required, one of the shortest being due to {{harvtxt|Freudenthal|1951}}.<ref>\nSee:\n*{{harvnb|Faraut|Koranyi|1994|pp=88–91}}\n*{{harvnb|Postnikov|1986}}</ref>\n\nIn fact if {{mvar|T}} is in {{math|''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''')}} with {{math|1=Tr ''T'' = 0}}, then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{D(X) = TX -XT}</math>\n\ndefines a skew-adjoint derivation of {{math|''H''<sub>3</sub>('''O''')}}. Indeed,\n\n: <math> \\operatorname{Tr}(T(X(X^2)) -T(X^2(X)))=\\operatorname{Tr} T(aI) = \\operatorname{Tr}(T)a=0, </math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math> (D(X),X^2)=0. </math>\n\nPolarizing yields:\n\n:<math> (D(X),Y\\circ Z)+(D(Y),Z\\circ X)+ (D(Z),X\\circ Y)=0. </math>\n\nSetting {{math|1=''Z'' = 1}}, shows that {{mvar|D}} is skew-adjoint. The derivation property {{math|1=''D''(''X''∘''Y'') = ''D''(''X'')∘''Y'' + ''X''∘''D''(''Y'')}} follows by this and the associativity property of the inner product in the identity above.\n\nWith {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|n}} as in the statement of the theorem, let {{mvar|K}} be the group of automorphisms of {{math|1=''E'' = ''H''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} leaving invariant the inner product. It is a closed subgroup of {{math|1=[[orthogonal group|O]](''E'')}} so a compact Lie group. Its Lie algebra consists of skew-adjoint derivations. {{harvtxt|Freudenthal|1951}} showed that given {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|E}} there is an automorphism {{mvar|k}} in {{mvar|K}} such that {{math|''k''(''X'')}} is a diagonal matrix. (By self-adjointness the diagonal entries will be real.) Freudenthal's diagonalization theorem immediately implies the Jordan condition, since Jordan products by real diagonal matrices commute on {{math|''M''<sub>''n''</sub>(''A'')}} for any non-associative algebra {{mvar|A}}.\n\nTo prove the diagonalization theorem, take {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|E}}. By compactness {{mvar|k}} can be chosen in {{mvar|K}} minimizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the off-diagonal terms of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}. Since {{mvar|K}} preserves the sums of all the squares, this is equivalent to maximizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the diagonal terms of {{math|''k''(''X'')}}. Replacing {{mvar|X}} by {{math|''k X''}}, it can be assumed that the maximum is attained at {{mvar|X}}. Since the [[symmetric group]] {{math|''S''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, acting by permuting the coordinates, lies in {{mvar|K}}, if {{mvar|X}} is not diagonal, it can be supposed that {{math|''x''<sub>12</sub>}} and its adjoint {{math|''x''<sub>21</sub>}} are non-zero. Let {{mvar|T}} be the skew-adjoint matrix with {{math|(2, 1)}} entry {{mvar|a}}, {{math|(1, 2)}} entry {{math|−''a''*}} and 0 elsewhere and let {{mvar|D}} be the derivation ad {{mvar|T}} of {{mvar|E}}. Let {{math|1=''k''<sub>''t''</sub> = exp ''tD''}} in {{mvar|K}}. Then only the first two diagonal entries in {{math|1=''X''(''t'') = ''k''<sub>''t''</sub>''X''}} differ from those of {{mvar|X}}. The diagonal entries are real. The derivative of {{math|''x''<sub>11</sub>(''t'')}} at {{math|1=''t'' = 0}} is the {{math|(1, 1)}} coordinate of {{math|[''T'', ''X'']}}, i.e. {{math|1=''a''* ''x''<sub>21</sub> + ''x''<sub>12</sub> ''a'' = 2(''x''<sub>21</sub>, ''a'')}}. This derivative is non-zero if {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>21</sub>}}. On the other hand, the group {{math|''k''<sub>''t''</sub>}} preserves the real-valued trace. Since it can only change {{math|1=''x''<sub>11</sub>}} and {{math|1=''x''<sub>22</sub>}}, it preserves their sum. However, on the line {{math|1=''x'' + ''y'' = }}constant, {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}} has no local maximum (only a global minimum), a contradiction. Hence {{mvar|X}} must be diagonal.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Multiplicative quadratic form]]\n* [[Radon–Hurwitz number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Albert|first= A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically non-commutative [[ring theory]], [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]], and [[module theory]], the '''Jacobson density theorem''' is a theorem concerning [[simple module]]s over a ring {{mvar|R}}.<ref>Isaacs, p. 184</ref>\n\nThe theorem can be applied to show that any [[primitive ring]] can be viewed as a \"dense\" subring of the ring of [[linear transformation]]s of a vector space.<ref>Such rings of linear transformations are also known as [[full linear ring]]s.</ref><ref name=\"Isaacs187\">Isaacs, Corollary 13.16, p. 187</ref> This theorem first appeared in the literature in 1945, in the famous paper \"Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions\" by [[Nathan Jacobson]].<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1990204 Jacobson, Nathan \"Structure Theory of Simple Rings Without Finiteness Assumptions\"]</ref> This can be viewed as a kind of generalization of the [[Artin-Wedderburn theorem]]'s conclusion about the structure of [[simple ring|simple]] [[Artinian ring]]s.\n\n==Motivation and formal statement==\nLet {{mvar|R}} be a ring and let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module. If {{mvar|u}} is a non-zero element of {{mvar|U}}, {{math|''u'' • ''R'' {{=}} ''U''}} (where {{math|''u'' • ''R''}} is the cyclic submodule of {{mvar|U}} generated by {{mvar|u}}). Therefore, if {{mvar|u, v}} are non-zero elements of {{mvar|U}}, there is an element of {{mvar|R}} that induces an [[endomorphism]] of {{mvar|U}} transforming {{mvar|u}} to {{mvar|v}}. The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>n</sub>'')}} and {{math|(''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y<sub>n</sub>'')}} separately, so that there is an element of {{mvar|R}} with the property that {{math|''x<sub>i</sub>'' • ''r'' {{=}} ''y<sub>i</sub>''}} for all {{mvar|i}}. If {{mvar|D}} is the set of all {{mvar|R}}-module endomorphisms of {{mvar|U}}, then [[Schur's lemma]] asserts that {{mvar|D}} is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} are linearly independent over {{mvar|D}}.\n\nWith the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way:\n\n:'''The Jacobson Density Theorem.''' Let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module, {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U<sub>R</sub>'')}}, and {{math|''X'' ⊂ ''U''}} a finite and {{mvar|D}}-linearly independent set. If {{mvar|A}} is a {{mvar|D}}-linear transformation on {{mvar|U}} then there exists {{math|''r'' ∈ ''R''}} such that {{math|''A''(''x'') {{=}} ''x'' • ''r''}} for all {{mvar|x}} in {{mvar|X}}.<ref>Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185</ref>\n\n==Proof==\nIn the Jacobson density theorem, the right {{mvar|R}}-module {{mvar|U}} is simultaneously viewed as a left {{mvar|D}}-module where {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U<sub>R</sub>'')}}, in the natural way: {{math|''g'' • ''u'' {{=}} ''g''(''u'')}}. It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on {{mvar|U}}.<ref>Incidentally it is also a {{math|''D''-''R''}} [[bimodule]] structure.</ref> As noted before, Schur's lemma proves {{mvar|D}} is a division ring if {{mvar|U}} is simple, and so {{mvar|U}} is a vector space over {{mvar|D}}.\n\nThe proof also relies on the following theorem proven in {{harv|Isaacs|1993}} p.&nbsp;185:\n\n:'''Theorem.''' Let {{mvar|U}} be a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module, {{math|''D'' {{=}} End(''U<sub>R</sub>'')}}, and {{math|''X'' ⊂ ''U''}} a finite set. Write {{math|''I'' {{=}} ann<sub>''R''</sub>(''X'')}} for the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] of {{mvar|X}} in {{mvar|R}}. Let {{mvar|u}} be in {{mvar|U}} with {{math|''u'' • ''I'' {{=}} 0}}. Then {{mvar|u}} is in {{mvar|XD}}; the {{mvar|D}}-[[linear span|span]] of {{mvar|X}}.\n\n===Proof of the Jacobson density theorem=== \nWe use [[mathematical induction|induction]] on {{math|{{!}}''X''{{!}}}}. If {{mvar|X}} is empty, then the theorem is vacuously true and the base case for induction is verified.\n\nAssume {{mvar|X}} is non-empty, let {{mvar|x}} be an element of {{mvar|X}} and write {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''X''&thinsp;\\{''x''}.}} If {{mvar|A}} is any {{mvar|D}}-linear transformation on {{mvar|U}}, by the induction hypothesis there exists {{math|''s'' ∈ ''R''}} such that {{math|''A''(''y'') {{=}} ''y'' • ''s''}} for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}}. Write {{math|''I'' {{=}} ann<sub>''R''</sub>(''Y'')}}. It is easily seen that {{math|''x'' • ''I''}} is a submodule of {{mvar|U}}. If {{math|''x'' • ''I'' {{=}} 0}}, then the previous theorem implies that {{mvar|x}} would be in the {{mvar|D}}-span of {{mvar|Y}}, contradicting the {{mvar|D}}-linear independence of {{mvar|X}}, therefore {{math|''x'' • ''I'' ≠ 0}}. Since {{mvar|U}} is simple, we have: {{math|''x'' • ''I'' {{=}} ''U''}}. Since {{math|''A''(''x'') − ''x'' • ''s'' ∈ ''U'' {{=}} ''x'' • ''I''}}, there exists {{mvar|i}} in {{mvar|I}} such that {{math|''x'' • ''i'' {{=}} ''A''(''x'') − ''x'' • ''s''}}.\n\nDefine {{math|''r'' {{=}} ''s'' + ''i''}} and observe that for all {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|Y}} we have:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\ny \\cdot r &= y \\cdot(s + i) \\\\\n&= y \\cdot s + y \\cdot i \\\\\n&= y \\cdot s && (\\text{since } i\\in \\text{ann}_R(Y)) \\\\\n&= A(y)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNow we do the same calculation for {{mvar|x}}:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx \\cdot r &= x \\cdot (s + i) \\\\\n&= x \\cdot s + x \\cdot i \\\\\n&= x \\cdot s + \\left ( A(x) - x \\cdot s \\right )\\\\\n&= A(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nTherefore, {{math|''A''(''z'') {{=}} ''z'' • ''r''}} for all {{mvar|z}} in {{mvar|X}}, as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets {{mvar|X}} of any size.\n\n==Topological characterization==\nA ring {{mvar|R}} is said to '''act densely''' on a simple right {{mvar|R}}-module {{mvar|U}} if it satisfies the conclusion of the Jacobson density theorem.<ref>Herstein, Definition, p. 40</ref> There is a topological reason for describing {{mvar|R}} as \"dense\". Firstly, {{mvar|R}} can be identified with a subring of {{math|End(''<sub>D</sub>U'')}} by identifying each element of {{mvar|R}} with the {{mvar|D}} linear transformation it induces by right multiplication. If {{mvar|U}} is given the [[discrete topology]], and if {{mvar|U<sup>U</sup>}} is given the [[product topology]], and {{math|End(''<sub>D</sub>U'')}} is viewed as a subspace of {{mvar|U<sup>U</sup>}} and is given the [[subspace topology]], then {{mvar|R}} acts densely on {{mvar|U}} if and only if {{mvar|R}} is [[dense set]] in {{math|End(''<sub>D</sub>U'')}} with this topology.<ref>It turns out this topology is the same as the [[compact-open topology]] in this case. Herstein, p. 41 uses this description.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings.<ref>Herstein, p. 41</ref> Notably, the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]]'s conclusion about the structure of [[simple ring|simple]] right [[Artinian ring]]s is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left [[primitive ring]]s as dense subrings of the ring of {{mvar|D}}-linear transformations on some {{mvar|D}}-vector space {{mvar|U}}, where {{mvar|D}} is a division ring.<ref name=\"Isaacs187\"/>\n\n==Relations to other results==\nThis result is related to the [[Von Neumann bicommutant theorem]], which states that, for a *-algebra {{mvar|A}} of operators on a [[Hilbert space]] {{mvar|H}}, the double commutant {{mvar|A′′}} can be approximated by {{mvar|A}} on any given finite set of vectors.

      "text": "In [[commutative algebra]], '''Krull's principal ideal theorem''', named after [[Wolfgang Krull]] (1899–1971),  gives a bound on the [[height (ring theory)|height]] of a [[principal ideal]] in a commutative [[Noetherian ring]].  The theorem is sometimes referred to by its German name, ''Krulls Hauptidealsatz'' (''[[Satz (disambiguation)|Satz]]'' meaning \"proposition\" or \"theorem\").\n\nFormally, if ''R'' is a Noetherian ring and ''I'' is a principal, proper ideal of ''R'', then ''I'' has height at most one.\n\nThis theorem can be generalized to [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s that are not principal, and the result is often called '''Krull's height theorem'''.  This says that if ''R'' is a Noetherian ring and ''I'' is a proper ideal generated by ''n'' elements of ''R'', then ''I'' has height at most ''n''.\n\nThe principal ideal theorem and the generalization, the height theorem, both follow from the [[fundamental theorem of dimension theory (algebra)|fundamental theorem of dimension theory]] in commutative algebra (see also below for the direct proofs). Bourbaki's ''[[Éléments de mathématique|Commutative Algebra]]'' gives a direct proof. Kaplansky's ''Commutative ring'' includes a proof due to [[David Rees (mathematician)|David Rees]].\n\n== Proofs ==\n=== Proof of the principal ideal theorem ===\nLet <math>A</math> be a Noetherian ring, ''x'' an element of it and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> a minimal prime over ''x''. Replacing ''A'' by the localization <math>A_\\mathfrak{p}</math>, we can assume <math>A</math> is local with the maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Let <math>\\mathfrak{q} \\subsetneq \\mathfrak{p}</math> be a strictly smaller prime ideal and let <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} = \\mathfrak{q}^n A_{\\mathfrak{q}} \\cap A</math>, which is a <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math>-[[primary ideal]] called the ''n''-th [[symbolic power (mathematics)|symbolic power]] of <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math>. It forms a descending chain of ideals <math>A \\supset \\mathfrak{q} \\supset \\mathfrak{q}^{(2)} \\supset \\mathfrak{q}^{(3)} \\supset \\cdots</math>. Thus, there is the descending chain of ideals <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} + (x)/(x)</math> in the ring <math>\\overline{A} = A/(x)</math>. Now, the radical <math>\\sqrt{(x)}</math> is the intersection of all minimal prime ideals containg <math>x</math>; <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is among them. But <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is a unique maximal ideal and thus <math>\\sqrt{(x)} = \\mathfrak{p}</math>. Since <math>(x)</math> contains some power of its radical, it follows that <math>\\overline{A}</math> is an Artinian ring and thus the chain <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} + (x)/(x)</math> stabilizes and so there is some ''n'' such that <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} + (x) = \\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)} + (x)</math>. It implies:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} = \\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)} + x \\, \\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}</math>,\n\nfrom the fact <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}</math> is <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math>-primary (if <math>y</math> is in <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}</math>, then <math>y = z + ax</math> with <math>z \\in \\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)}</math> and <math>a \\in A</math>. Since <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is minimal over <math>x</math>, <math>x \\not\\in \\mathfrak{q}</math> and so <math>ax \\in \\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}</math> implies <math>a</math> is in <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}</math>.) Now, quotienting out both sides by   <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)}</math>  yields <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}/\\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)} = (x)\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)}/\\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)}</math>. Then, by [[Nakayama's lemma]], letting <math>I = (x)</math>, we get that both sides are zero and  <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{(n)} = \\mathfrak{q}^{(n+1)}</math>, thus <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{n} A_{\\mathfrak{q}} = \\mathfrak{q}^{n+1} A_{\\mathfrak{q}}</math>. Using Nakayama's lemma again, <math>\\mathfrak{q}^{n} A_{\\mathfrak{q}} = 0</math> and <math>A_{\\mathfrak{q}}</math> is an Artinian ring; thus, the height of <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> is zero. <math>\\square</math>\n\n=== Proof of the height theorem ===\nKrull’s height theorem can be proved as a consequence of the principal ideal theorem by induction on the number of elements. Let <math>x_1, \\dots, x_n</math> be elements in <math>A</math>, <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> a minimal prime over <math>(x_1, \\dots, x_n)</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{q} \\subsetneq \\mathfrak{p}</math> a prime ideal such that there is no prime strictly between them. Replacing <math>A</math> by the localization <math>A_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> we can assume <math>(A, \\mathfrak{p})</math> is a local ring; note we then have <math>\\mathfrak{p} = \\sqrt{(x_1, \\dots, x_n)}</math>. By minimality, <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> cannot contain all the <math>x_i</math>; relabeling the subscripts, say, <math>x_1 \\not\\in \\mathfrak{q}</math>. Since every prime ideal containing <math>\\mathfrak{q} + (x_1)</math> is between <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>, <math>\\sqrt{\\mathfrak{q} + (x_1)} = \\mathfrak{p}</math> and thus we can write for each <math>i \\ge 2</math>,\n:<math>x_i^{r_i} = y_i + a_i x_1</math>\nwith <math>y_i \\in \\mathfrak{q}</math> and <math>a_i \\in A</math>. Now we consider the ring <math>\\overline{A} = A/(y_2, \\dots, y_n)</math> and the corresponding chain <math>\\overline{\\mathfrak{q}} \\subset \\overline{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> in it. If <math>\\overline{\\mathfrak{r}}</math> is a minimal prime over <math>\\overline{x_1}</math>, then <math>\\mathfrak{r}</math> contains <math>x_1, x_2^{r_2}, \\dots, x_n^{r_n}</math> and thus <math>\\mathfrak{r} = \\mathfrak{p}</math>; that is to say, <math>\\overline{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> is a minimal prime over <math>\\overline{x_1}</math> and so, by Krull’s principal ideal theorem, <math>\\overline{\\mathfrak{q}}</math> is a minimal prime (over zero); <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> is a minimal prime over <math>(y_2, \\dots, y_n)</math>. By inductive hypothesis, <math>\\operatorname{ht}(\\mathfrak{q}) \\le n-1</math> and thus <math>\\operatorname{ht}(\\mathfrak{p}) \\le n</math>. <math>\\square</math>\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Matsumura | first1=Hideyuki | title=Commutative Algebra | publisher=Benjamin | location=New York | year=1970}}, see in particular section (12.I), p. 77\n*http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~hochster/615W10/supDim.pdf\n\n[[Category:Commutative algebra]]\n[[Category:Ideals]]\n[[Category:Theorems in abstract algebra]]"

      "text": "{{Context|date=October 2009}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''Lie's third theorem''' states that every finite-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] ''g'' over the real numbers is associated to a [[Lie group]] ''G''. The theorem is part of the [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]].\n\nHistorically, the third theorem referred to a different but related result. The two preceding theorems of [[Sophus Lie]], restated in modern language, relate to the [[infinitesimal transformation]]s of a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on a [[smooth manifold]]. The third theorem on the list stated the [[Jacobi identity]] for the infinitesimal transformations of a  [[local Lie group]]. Conversely, in the presence of a Lie algebra of [[vector field]]s, integration gives a ''local'' [[Lie group action]]. The result now known as the third theorem provides an intrinsic and global converse to the original theorem.\n\n== Cartan's theorem ==\nThe equivalence between the category of simply connected real Lie groups and finite-dimensional real Lie algebras is called usually (in the literature of the second half of 20th century) Cartan's or Cartan-Lie theorem as it is proved by [[Élie Cartan]] whereas S. Lie has proved earlier just the infinitesimal version (local solvability of Maurer-Cartan equations (see [[Maurer-Cartan form]]) or the equivalence between the category of finite-dimensional Lie algebras and the category of local Lie groups).\n\nLie listed his results as three direct and three converse theorems. The infinitesimal variant of Cartan's theorem was essentially Lie's third converse theorem. In an influential book<ref>[[Jean-Pierre Serre]] (1992)[1965] ''Lie Algebras and Lie Groups: 1964 Lectures Given at Harvard University'', page 152, Springer {{ISBN|978-3-540-55008-2}}</ref> [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] called it the '''third theorem of Lie'''. The name is historically somewhat misleading, but often used in connection to generalizations.\n\nSerre provided two proofs in his book: one based on [[Ado's theorem]] and another recounting the proof by Élie Cartan.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lie group integrator]]\n* [[Lie theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* {{Citation | last=Cartan | first = Élie | authorlink = Élie Cartan | title = La théorie des groupes finis et continus et l'''Analysis Situs'' | year = 1930 | periodical = Mémorial Sc.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], more specifically [[abstract algebra]] and [[commutative algebra]], '''Nakayama's lemma''' &mdash; also known as the '''Krull–Azumaya theorem'''<ref name=\"Nagata\">{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A.2}}</ref> &mdash; governs the interaction between the [[Jacobson radical]] of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (typically a [[commutative ring]]) and its [[finitely-generated module|finitely generated]] [[Module (mathematics)|modules]].  Informally, the lemma immediately gives a precise sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring behave like [[vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. It is an important tool in [[algebraic geometry]], because it allows local data on [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], in the form of modules over [[local ring]]s, to be studied pointwise as vector spaces over the residue field of the ring.\n\nThe lemma is named after the Japanese mathematician [[Tadashi Nakayama (mathematician)|Tadashi Nakayama]] and introduced in its present form in {{harvtxt|Nakayama|1951}}, although it was first discovered in the special case of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in a commutative ring by [[Wolfgang Krull]] and then in general by [[Goro Azumaya]] ([[#CITEREFAzumaya1951|1951]]).<ref>{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A.2}}; {{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|p=8}}</ref> In the commutative case, the lemma is a simple consequence of a generalized form of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], an observation made by [[Michael Atiyah]] ([[#CITEREFAtiyahMacdonald1969|1969]]).  The special case of the noncommutative version of the lemma for right ideals appears in [[Nathan Jacobson]] ([[#CITEREFJacobson1945|1945]]), and so the noncommutative Nakayama lemma is sometimes known as the '''Jacobson–Azumaya theorem'''.<ref name=\"Nagata\" /> The latter has various applications in the theory of [[Jacobson radical]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Corollary 13.13, p. 184}}</ref>\n\n==Statement==\nLet ''R'' be a [[commutative ring]] with identity 1.

Statement 4 then implies that a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of ''M''/''mM'' lifts to a minimal set of generators of ''M''.  Conversely, every minimal set of generators of ''M'' is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an [[invertible matrix]] with entries in the ring.\n\nIn this form, Nakayama's lemma takes on concrete geometrical significance.  Local rings arise in geometry as the [[germ (mathematics)|germ]]s of functions at a point.  Finitely generated modules over local rings arise quite often as germs of [[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of [[vector bundle]]s.  Working at the level of germs rather than points, the notion of finite-dimensional vector bundle gives way to that of a [[coherent sheaf]].  Informally, Nakayama's lemma says that one can still regard a coherent sheaf as coming from a vector bundle in some sense.  More precisely, let ''F'' be a coherent sheaf of '''O'''<sub>''X''</sub>-modules over an arbitrary [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X''.  The [[stalk (mathematics)|stalk]] of ''F'' at a point ''p''&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''X'', denoted by ''F''<sub>''p''</sub>, is a module over the local ring '''O'''<sub>''p''</sub>.  The fibre of ''F'' at ''p'' is the vector space ''F''(''p'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''F<sub>p</sub>''/''m<sub>p</sub>F<sub>p</sub>'' where ''m''<sub>''p''</sub> is the maximal ideal of '''O'''<sub>''p''</sub>.  Nakayama's lemma implies that a basis of the fibre ''F''(''p'') lifts to a minimal set of generators of ''F''<sub>''p''</sub>. That is:\n* Any basis of the fiber of a coherent sheaf ''F'' at a point comes from a minimal basis of local sections.\n\n===Going up and going down===\n{{main|Going up and going down}}\nThe '''going up theorem''' is essentially a corollary of Nakayama's lemma.<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1993|loc=§4.4}}</ref>  It asserts:\n\n* Let ''R''&nbsp;&sub;&nbsp;''S'' be an [[integral extension]] of commutative rings, and ''P'' a [[prime ideal]] of ''R''.  Then there is a prime ideal ''Q'' in ''S'' such that ''Q''&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''.  Moreover, ''Q'' can be chosen to contain any prime ''Q''<sub>1</sub> of ''S'' such that ''Q''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&cap;&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;&sub;&nbsp;''P''.\n\n===Module epimorphisms===\nNakayama's lemma makes precise one sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring are like vector spaces over a field.  The following consequence of Nakayama's lemma gives another way in which this is true:\n\n*If ''M'' is a finitely generated ''R''-module and ''&fnof;''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;''M'' is a surjective endomorphism, then ''&fnof;'' is an isomorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|loc=Theorem 2.4}}</ref>\n\nOver a local ring, one can say more about module epimorphisms:<ref name=\"Griffiths\">{{harvnb|Griffiths|Harris|1994|p=681}}</ref>\n\n*Suppose that ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal ''m'', and ''M'', ''N'' are finitely generated ''R''-modules.  If &phi;&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;''N'' is an ''R''-linear map such that the quotient &phi;<sub>''m''</sub>&nbsp;:&nbsp;''M''/''mM''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;''N''/''mN'' is surjective, then &phi; is surjective.\n\n===Homological versions===\nNakayama's lemma also has several versions in [[homological algebra]].  The above statement about epimorphisms can be used to show:<ref name=\"Griffiths\" />\n\n* Let ''M'' be a finitely generated module over a local ring.  Then ''M'' is [[projective module|projective]] if and only if it is [[free module|free]].\nA geometrical and global counterpart to this is the [[Serre–Swan theorem]], relating projective modules and coherent sheaves.\n\nMore generally, one has<ref>{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1993|loc=Corollary 19.5}}</ref>\n* Let ''R'' be a local ring and ''M'' a finitely generated module over ''R''.  Then the [[projective dimension]] of ''M'' over ''R'' is equal to the length of every minimal [[free resolution]] of ''M''.  Moreover, the projective dimension is equal to the global dimension of ''M'', which is by definition the smallest integer ''i''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;0 such that\n::<math>\\operatorname{Tor}_{i+1}^R(k,M) = 0.</math>\n:Here ''k'' is the residue field of ''R'' and Tor is the [[tor functor]].\n\n==Proof==\nA standard proof of the Nakayama lemma uses the following technique due to {{harvtxt|Atiyah|Macdonald|1969}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1989|p=7}}: \"A standard technique applicable to finite ''A''-modules is the 'determinant trick'...\"  See also the proof contained in {{harvtxt|Eisenbud|1995|loc=§4.1}}.</ref>\n* Let ''M'' be an ''R''-module generated by ''n'' elements, and &phi;:&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;''M'' an ''R''-linear map.  If there is an ideal ''I'' of ''R'' such that &phi;(''M'')&nbsp;&sub;&nbsp;''IM'', then there is a [[monic polynomial]]\n::<math>p(x) = x^n + p_1x^{n-1}+\\cdots + p_n</math>\n:with ''p''<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''I''<sup>''k''</sup>, such that\n::<math>p(\\varphi)=0</math>\n:as an endomorphism of ''M''.\n\nThis assertion is precisely a generalized version of the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]], and the proof proceeds along the same lines.  On the generators ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''M'', one has a relation of the form\n:<math>\\varphi(x_i) = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij}x_j</math>\nwhere ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;&isin;&nbsp;''I''.  Thus\n:<math>\\sum_{j=1}^n\\left(\\varphi\\delta_{ij} - a_{ij}\\right)x_j = 0.</math>\nThe required result follows by multiplying by the [[Cofactor (linear algebra)#Adjugate|adjugate]] of the matrix (&phi;&delta;<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>) and invoking [[Cramer's rule]].  One finds then det(&phi;&delta;<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, so the required polynomial is\n:<math>p(t) = \\det(t\\delta_{ij}-a_{ij}).</math>\n\nTo prove Nakayama's lemma from the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, assume that ''IM''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''M'' and take &phi; to be the identity on ''M''.  Then define a polynomial ''p''(''x'') as above.  Then\n:<math>r=p(1) = 1+p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_n</math>\nhas the required property.\n\n==Noncommutative case==\nA version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative [[unital ring]]s ''R''.  The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the '''Jacobson–Azumaya theorem'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Nagata|1962|loc=§A2}}</ref>\n\nLet J(''R'') be the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''R''. If ''U'' is a right module over a ring, ''R'', and ''I'' is a right ideal in ''R'', then define ''U'''''·'''''I'' to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form ''u'''''·'''''i'', where '''·''' is simply the action of ''R'' on ''U''. Necessarily, ''U'''''·'''''I'' is a submodule of ''U''.\n\nIf ''V'' is a [[maximal submodule]] of ''U'', then ''U''/''V'' is [[Simple module|simple]].  So ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is necessarily a subset of ''V'', by the definition of J(''R'') and the fact that ''U''/''V'' is simple.<ref>{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|p= 182}}</ref> Thus, if ''U'' contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is a proper submodule of ''U''. However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules ''U'' over ''R'', for ''U'' need not contain any maximal submodules.<ref>{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|p=183}}</ref> Naturally, if ''U'' is a [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] module, this holds. If ''R'' is Noetherian, and ''U'' is [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]], then ''U'' is a Noetherian module over ''R'', and the conclusion is satisfied.<ref>{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Theorem 12.19, p. 172}}</ref> Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that ''U'' is finitely generated as an ''R''-module (and no finiteness assumption on ''R''), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma.<ref name=\"Isaacs\">{{harvnb|Isaacs|1993|loc=Theorem 13.11, p. 183}}</ref>\n\nPrecisely, one has:\n:'''Nakayama's lemma''': Let ''U'' be a [[Finitely generated module|finitely generated]] right module over a (unital) ring ''R''.  If ''U'' is a non-zero module, then ''U'''''·'''J(''R'') is a proper submodule of ''U''.<ref name=\"Isaacs\" />\n\n===Proof===\nLet <math>X</math> be a finite subset of <math>U</math>, minimal with respect to the property that it generates <math>U</math>.

Therefore, we have\n\n<math>u=\\sum_{s=1}^{m}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i r_{i,s} \\right)j_s = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\left(\\sum_{s=1}^{m}r_{i,s}j_s\\right)</math>.\n\nSince <math>\\operatorname J(R)</math> is a (two-sided) ideal in <math>R</math>, we have <math>\\sum_{s=1}^{m}r_{i,s}j_s \\in \\operatorname J(R)</math> for every <math>i\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math>, and thus this becomes\n\n:<math>u= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i k_i</math> for some <math>k_i\\in \\operatorname J(R)</math>, <math>i=1,\\dots,n</math>.\n\nPutting <math>u=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i</math> and applying distributivity, we obtain\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) = 0</math>.\n\nChoose some <math>j\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}</math>. If the right ideal <math>(1-k_j) R</math> were proper, then it would be contained in a maximal right ideal <math>M\\neq R</math> and both <math>1-k_j</math> and <math>k_j</math> would belong to <math>M</math>, leading to a contradiction (note that <math>\\operatorname J(R)\\subseteq M</math> by the definition of the Jacobson radical). Thus <math>(1-k_j)R=R</math> and <math>1-k_j</math> has a right inverse <math>(1-k_j)^{-1}</math> in <math>R</math>. We have\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = 0</math>.\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\neq j} x_i (1 - k_i) (1 - k_j)^{-1} = -x_j</math>.\n\nThus <math>x_j</math> is a linear combination of the elements from <math>X\\setminus\\{x_j\\}</math>.

      "text": "{{For|the Poincaré–Birkhoff fixed-point theorem|Poincaré–Birkhoff theorem}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], in the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s, the '''Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem''' (or '''PBW theorem''') is a result giving an explicit description of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a Lie algebra. It is named after [[Henri Poincaré]], [[Garrett Birkhoff]], and [[Ernst Witt]].\n\nThe terms ''PBW type theorem'' and ''PBW theorem'' may also refer to various analogues of the original theorem, comparing a [[filtered algebra]] to its associated graded algebra, in particular in the area of [[quantum groups]].\n\n== Statement of the theorem ==\n\nRecall that any [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] has a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]; this is a set ''S'' such that any element of ''V'' is a unique (finite) [[linear combination]] of elements of ''S''.  In the formulation of Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem we consider bases of which the elements are [[total order|totally ordered]] by some relation which we denote ≤.\n\nIf ''L'' is a Lie algebra over a field '''K''',  let ''h'' denote the canonical '''K'''-[[linear transformation|linear map]] from ''L'' into the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''U''(''L'').\n\n'''Theorem'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 9.9</ref> Let ''L'' be a Lie algebra over  '''K''' and ''X'' a totally ordered basis of ''L''. A  ''canonical monomial'' over ''X'' is a finite sequence  (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>   ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) of elements of ''X'' which is non-decreasing in the order ≤, that is, ''x''<sub>1</sub> ≤''x''<sub>2</sub> ≤  ... ≤ ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>. Extend ''h'' to all canonical monomials as follows: If (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a canonical monomial, let \n:<math> h(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) = h(x_1) \\cdot h(x_2) \\cdots h(x_n). </math>\nThen ''h'' is [[injective]] on the set of canonical monomials and its range is a basis of the '''K'''-vector space ''U''(''L'').\n\nStated somewhat differently, consider ''Y'' = ''h''(''X''). ''Y'' is totally ordered by the induced ordering from ''X''. The set of monomials\n\n:<math> y_1^{k_1} y_2^{k_2} \\cdots y_\\ell^{k_\\ell} </math>\n\nwhere ''y''<sub>1</sub> <''y''<sub>2</sub> < ... < ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> are elements of ''Y'', and the exponents are ''non-negative'', together with the multiplicative unit 1, form a basis for ''U''(''L'').  Note that the unit element 1 corresponds to the empty canonical monomial. The theorem then asserts that these monomials form a basis for ''U''(''L'') as a vector space. It is easy to see that these monomials span ''U''(''L''); the content of the theorem is that they are linearly independent.\n\nThe multiplicative structure of ''U''(''L'') is determined by the [[structure constants]] in the basis ''X'', that is, the coefficients <math>c_{u,v}^x</math> such that\n\n:<math> [u,v] = \\sum_{x \\in X} c_{u,v}^x\\; x. </math>\n\nThis relation allows one to reduce any product of ''y'''s to a linear combination of canonical monomials: The structure constants determine ''y<sub>i</sub>y<sub>j</sub> &ndash; y<sub>j</sub>y<sub>i</sub>'', i.e. what to do in order to change the order of two elements of ''Y'' in a product. This fact, modulo an inductive argument on the degree of (non-canonical) monomials, shows one can always achieve products where the factors are ordered in a non-decreasing fashion.\n\nThe Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem can be interpreted as saying that the end result of this reduction is ''unique'' and does not depend on the order in which one swaps adjacent elements.\n\n'''Corollary'''. If ''L'' is a Lie algebra over a field, the canonical map ''L'' → ''U''(''L'') is injective.  In particular, any Lie algebra over a field is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra.\n\n== More general contexts ==\n\nAlready at its earliest stages, it was known that '''K''' could be replaced by any commutative ring, provided that ''L'' is a free '''K'''-module, i.e., has a basis as above.\n\nTo extend to the case when ''L'' is no longer a free '''K'''-module, one needs to make a reformulation that does not use bases. This involves replacing the space of monomials in some basis with the [[symmetric algebra]], ''S''(''L''), on ''L''.\n\nIn the case that '''K''' contains the field of rational numbers, one can consider the natural map from ''S''(''L'') to ''U''(''L''), sending a monomial <math> v_1 v_2 \\cdots v_n</math>. for <math>v_i \\in L</math>, to the element \n:<math>\\frac{1}{n!} \\sum_{\\sigma \\in S_n} v_{\\sigma(1)} v_{\\sigma(2)} \\cdots v_{\\sigma(n)}.</math>\nThen, one has the theorem that this map is an isomorphism of '''K'''-modules.\n\nStill more generally and naturally, one can consider ''U''(''L'') as a [[filtered algebra]], equipped with the filtration given by specifying that <math> v_1 v_2 \\cdots v_n</math> lies in filtered degree <math>\\leq n</math>.  The map ''L'' → ''U''(''L'')  of '''K'''-modules canonically extends to a map ''T''(''L'') → ''U''(''L'') of algebras, where ''T''(''L'') is the [[tensor algebra]] on ''L'' (for example, by the universal property of tensor algebras), and this is a filtered map equipping ''T''(''L'') with the filtration putting ''L'' in degree one (actually, ''T''(''L'') is graded).  Then, passing to the associated graded, one gets a canonical morphism ''T''(''L'') → gr''U''(''L''), which kills the elements ''vw'' - ''wv'' for ''v, w'' ∈ ''L'', and hence descends to a canonical morphism ''S''(''L'') → gr''U''(''L'').  Then, the (graded) PBW theorem can be reformulated as the statement that, under certain hypotheses, this final morphism is an isomorphism ''of commutative algebras''.\n\nThis is not true for all '''K''' and ''L'' (see, for example, the last section of Cohn's 1961 paper), but is true in many cases. These include the aforementioned ones, where either ''L'' is a free '''K'''-module (hence whenever '''K''' is a field), or '''K''' contains the field of rational numbers.  More generally, the PBW theorem as formulated above extends to cases such as where  (1) ''L'' is a flat '''K'''-module, (2) ''L'' is [[Torsion-free abelian group|torsion-free]] as an [[abelian group]], (3) ''L'' is a direct sum of cyclic modules (or all its localizations at prime ideals of '''K''' have this property), or (4) '''K''' is a [[Dedekind domain]].  See, for example, the 1969 paper by Higgins for these statements.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in some of these cases, one also obtains the stronger statement that the canonical morphism ''S''(''L'') → gr''U''(''L'') lifts to a '''K'''-module isomorphism ''S''(''L'') → ''U''(''L''), without taking associated graded.  This is true in the first cases mentioned, where ''L'' is a free '''K'''-module, or '''K''' contains the field of rational numbers, using the construction outlined here (in fact, the result is a [[coalgebra]] isomorphism, and not merely a '''K'''-module isomorphism, equipping both ''S''(''L'') and ''U''(''L'') with their natural coalgebra structures such that <math>\\Delta(v) = v \\otimes 1 + 1 \\otimes v</math> for ''v'' ∈ ''L'').  This stronger statement, however, might not extend to all of the cases in the previous paragraph.\n\n== History of the theorem ==\n\nIn four papers from the 1880s by [[Alfredo Capelli]] proved, in different terminology, what is now known as the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem in the case of <math>L=\\mathfrak{gl}_n,</math>, the [[General linear group|General linear Lie algebra]]; while Poincaré later stated it more generally in 1900.<ref name=Borelp6>Borel, p.6</ref> [[Armand Borel]] says that these results of Capelli were ''\"completely forgotten for almost a century\"'', and he does not suggest that Poincaré was aware of Capelli's result.<ref name=Borelp6/>\n\nTon-That and Tran <ref name=\"See Ton-That and Tran 1999\">See Ton-That and Tran 1999.</ref> have investigated the history of the theorem. They have found out that the majority of the sources before Bourbaki's 1960 book call it Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Following this old tradition, Fofanova<ref>See Fofanova 2001.</ref> in her encyclopaedic entry says that Poincaré obtained the first variant of the theorem. She further says that the theorem was subsequently completely demonstrated by Witt and Birkhoff. It appears that pre-Bourbaki sources were not familiar with Poincaré's paper.\n\nBirkhoff <ref>See Birkhoff 1937.</ref> and Witt <ref>See Witt 1937.</ref> do not mention Poincaré's work in their 1937 papers. [[Henri Cartan|Cartan]] and [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] <ref>See Cartan and Eilenberg 1956.</ref> call the theorem ''Poincaré-Witt Theorem'' and attribute the complete proof to Witt. [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]<ref>See Bourbaki 1960.</ref> were the first to use all three names in their 1960 book. [[Anthony Knapp|Knapp]] presents a clear illustration of the shifting tradition. In his 1986 book<ref>See Knapp 1986.</ref> he calls it ''Birkhoff-Witt Theorem'', while in his later 1996 book<ref>See Knapp 1996.</ref> he switches to ''Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem''.\n\nIt is not clear whether Poincaré's result was complete. Ton-That and Tran<ref name=\"See Ton-That and Tran 1999\"/> conclude that ''\"Poincaré had discovered and completely demonstrated this theorem at least thirty-seven years before Witt and Birkhoff\"''. On the other hand, they point out that ''\"Poincaré makes several statements without bothering to prove them\"''. Their own proofs of all the steps are rather long according to their admission. Borel states that Poincaré \"''more or less proved the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem''\" in 1900.<ref name=Borelp6/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{ cite journal\n | first = Garrett\n | last = Birkhoff\n | title = Representability of Lie algebras and Lie groups by matrices\n | journal = Annals of Mathematics\n | volume = 38\n | number = 2\n |date=April 1937\n | pages = 526–532\n | jstor = 1968569\n | doi=10.2307/1968569\n}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Borel|first1=Armand|title=Essays in the History of Lie groups and algebraic groups|date=2001|publisher=American mathematical society and London mathematical society|volume=History of Mathematics, Vol. 21|isbn=978-0821802885}}\n*{{cite book\n | first = Nicolas\n | last = Bourbaki\n | series = Éléments de mathématique\n | title = Groupes et algèbres de Lie\n | chapter = Chapitre 1: Algèbres de Lie\n | publisher = Hermann\n | location = Paris\n | year = 1960\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | first1 = Henri\n | last1 = Cartan\n | first2 = Samuel\n | last2 = Eilenberg\n | title = Homological Algebra\n | publisher = Princeton University Press\n | series = Princeton Mathematical Series (PMS)\n | volume = 19\n | year = 1956\n | isbn = 978-0-691-04991-5\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n | first = P.M.\n | last = Cohn\n | title = A remark on the Birkhoff-Witt theorem\n | journal = J.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Lasker–Noether theorem''' states that every [[Noetherian ring]] is a '''Lasker ring''', which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called '''primary decomposition''', of finitely many ''[[primary ideal]]s'' (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of [[prime ideal]]s).  The theorem was first proven by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emanuel Lasker|first=Emanuel|last= Lasker|year= 1905}} for the special case of [[polynomial ring]]s and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Emmy Noether|first=Emmy |last=Noether|year= 1921}}.\n\nThe Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], and more generally the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in [[algebraic geometry]], by asserting that every [[algebraic set]] may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of [[irreducible component]]s.\n\nIt has a straightforward extension to [[Module (mathematics)|modules]] stating that every submodule of a [[finitely generated module]] over a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary submodules. This contains the case for rings as a special case, considering the ring as a module over itself, so that ideals are submodules. This also generalizes the primary decomposition form of the [[structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain]], and for the special case of polynomial rings over a field, it generalizes the decomposition of an algebraic set into a finite union of (irreducible) varieties.\n\nThe first algorithm for computing primary decompositions for polynomial rings over a field of characteristic 0<ref group=\"Note\">Primary decomposition requires testing irreducibility of polynomials, which is not always algorithmically possible in nonzero characteristic.</ref> was published by Noether's student {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Grete Hermann|first=Grete |last=Hermann|year= 1926|pg=89}}.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Ciliberto|editor1-first=Ciro|editor2-last=Hirzebruch|editor2-first=Friedrich|editor3-last=Miranda|editor3-first=Rick|editor4-last=Teicher|editor4-first=Mina|editor4-link= Mina Teicher |title=Applications of Algebraic Geometry to Coding Theory, Physics and Computation|date=2001|publisher=Springer Netherlands|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-010-1011-5|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402000041|language=en}}</ref>{{better source|reason=Source secondary and may be contradicted in primary; compare w/ poster on Talk Page|date=July 2018}} The decomposition does not hold in general for non-commutative Noetherian rings. Noether gave an example of a non-commutative Noetherian ring with a right ideal that is not an intersection of primary ideals.\n\n==Definitions==\nWrite ''R'' for a commutative ring, and ''M'' and ''N'' for modules over it.\n\n* A '''[[zero divisor]]''' of a module ''M'' is an element ''x'' of ''R'' such that ''xm''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for some non-zero ''m'' in ''M''.\n*An element ''x'' of ''R'' is called '''nilpotent in ''M''''' if ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>''M''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for some positive integer ''n''.\n*A module ''M'' is called '''[[associated prime|coprimary]]''' if every zero divisor of ''M'' is nilpotent in ''M''. For example, groups of prime power order and free abelian groups are coprimary modules over the ring of integers. \n*A submodule ''M'' of a module ''N'' is called a '''primary submodule''' if ''N''/''M'' is coprimary. \n*An ideal ''I'' is called '''[[primary ideal|primary]]''' if it is a primary submodule of ''R''. This is equivalent to saying that if ''ab'' is in ''I'' then either ''a'' is in ''I'' or ''b''<sup>''n''</sup> is in ''I'' for some ''n'', and to the condition that every zero-divisor of the ring ''R''/''I'' is nilpotent. \n*A submodule ''M'' of a module ''N'' is called '''irreducible''' if it is not an intersection of two strictly larger submodules.\n*An '''[[associated prime]]''' of a module ''M'' is a prime ideal that is the annihilator of some element of ''M''.\n\n==Statement==\n\nThe Lasker–Noether theorem for modules states every submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary submodules. For the special case of ideals it states that every ideal of a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary ideals.\n\nAn equivalent statement is: every finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is contained in a finite product of coprimary modules.\n\nThe Lasker–Noether theorem follows immediately from the following three facts:\n*Any submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is an intersection of a finite number of irreducible submodules. \n*If ''M'' is an irreducible submodule of a finitely generated module ''N'' over a Noetherian ring then ''N''/''M'' has only one associated prime ideal. \n*A finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is coprimary if and only if it has at most one associated prime.\n\nA proof in a somewhat different flavor is given below.\n\n==Primary decomposition of ideals==\n\nLet ''R'' be a Noetherian commutative ring, and ''I'' an ideal in ''R''. Then ''I'' has an irredundant primary decomposition into primary ideals.\n\n:<math>I = Q_1 \\cap \\cdots \\cap Q_n\\ </math>\n\nIrredundancy means:\n\n*Removing any of the <math>Q_i</math> changes the intersection, i.e., \n:<math>Q_1 \\cap \\dots \\cap \\widehat{Q_i} \\cap \\dots \\cap Q_n \\nsubseteq Q_i</math>\n\nfor all ''i'', where the hat denotes omission.\n\n*The [[associated prime ideal]]s <math>\\sqrt{Q_i}</math> are distinct.\n\nMoreover, this decomposition is unique in the following sense: the set of associated prime ideals is unique, and the primary ideal above every minimal prime in this set is also unique. However, primary ideals which are associated with non-minimal prime ideals are in general not unique.\n\nIn the case of the ring of integers <math>\\mathbb Z</math>, the Lasker–Noether theorem is equivalent to the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]]. If an integer ''n'' has prime factorization <math>n = \\pm p_1^{d_1} \\cdots p_r^{d_r}</math>, then the primary decomposition of the ideal <math>\\langle n \\rangle</math> generated by {{math|''n''}} in <math>\\mathbb Z</math>, is\n\n:<math>\\langle n\\rangle = \\langle p_1^{d_1} \\rangle \\cap \\cdots \\cap \\langle p_r^{d_r}\\rangle.</math>\n\nSimilarly, in a [[unique factorization domain]], if an element has a prime factorization <math>f = u p_1^{d_1} \\cdots p_r^{d_r},</math> where {{math|''u''}} is a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], then the primary decomposition of the [[principal ideal]] generated by {{math|''f''}} is \n:<math>\\langle f\\rangle = \\langle p_1^{d_1} \\rangle \\cap \\cdots \\cap \\langle p_r^{d_r}\\rangle.</math>\n\n===Examples===\nThe examples of the section are designed for illustrating some properties of primary decompositions, which may appear as surprising or counter-intuitive. All examples are ideals in a [[polynomial ring]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''k''}}.\n\n====Intersection vs. product====\nThe primary decomposition in <math>k[x,y,z]</math> of the ideal <math>I=\\langle x,yz \\rangle</math> is\n:<math>I = \\langle x,yz \\rangle = \\langle x,y \\rangle \\cap \\langle x,z \\rangle.</math>\n\nBecause of the generator of degree one, {{math|''I''}} is not the product of two larger ideals. A similar example is given, in two indeterminates by\n:<math>I = \\langle x,y(y+1) \\rangle = \\langle x,y \\rangle \\cap \\langle x,y+1 \\rangle.</math>\n\n====Primary vs. prime power====\nIn <math>k[x,y]</math>, the ideal <math>\\langle x,y^2 \\rangle</math> is a primary ideal that has <math>\\langle x,y \\rangle</math> as associated prime. It is not a power of its associated prime.\n\n====Non-uniqueness and non-minimal associated prime ====\n\nFor every positive integer {{math|''n''}}, a primary decomposition in <math>k[x,y]</math> of the ideal <math>I=\\langle x^2, xy \\rangle</math> is\n:<math>I = \\langle x^2,xy \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle \\cap \\langle x^2, xy, y^n \\rangle.</math>\n\nThe associated primes are \n:<math>\\langle x \\rangle \\subset \\langle x,y \\rangle.</math>\n \n====Non-associated prime between two associated primes====\nIn <math>k[x,y,z],</math> the ideal <math>I=\\langle x^2, xy, xz \\rangle</math> has the (non-unique) primary decomposition\n:<math>I = \\langle x^2,xy, xz \\rangle = \\langle x \\rangle \\cap \\langle x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz \\rangle.</math>\nThe associated prime ideals are <math>\\langle x \\rangle \\subset \\langle x,y,z \\rangle,</math> and <math>\\langle x, y \\rangle</math> is a non associated prime ideal such that\n:<math>\\langle x \\rangle \\subset \\langle x,y \\rangle \\subset \\langle x,y,z \\rangle.</math>\n====A complicated example====\nUnless for very simple examples, a primary decomposition may be hard to compute and may have a very complicated output. The following example has been designed for providing such a complicated output, and, nevertheless, being accessible to hand-written computation.\n\nLet\n:<math>\n\\begin {align}\nP&=a_0x^m + a_1x^{m-1}y +\\cdots +a_my^m \\\\\nQ&=b_0x^n + b_1x^{n-1}y +\\cdots +b_ny^n\n\\end {align}</math>\nbe two [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, whose coefficients <math>a_1, \\ldots, a_m, b_0, \\ldots, b_n</math> are polynomials in other indeterminates <math>z_1, \\ldots, z_h</math> over a field {{math|''k''}}. That is, {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} belong to <math>R=k[x,y,z_1, \\ldots, z_h],</math> and it is in this ring that a primary decomposition of the ideal <math>I=\\langle P,Q\\rangle</math> is searched. For computing the primary decomposition, we suppose first that 1 is a [[Polynomial greatest common divisor|greatest common divisor]] of {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}}.\n\nThis condition implies that {{math|''I''}} has no primary component of [[height (ring theory)|height]] one. As {{math|''I''}} is generated by two elements, this implies that it is a [[complete intersection]] (more precisely, it defines an [[algebraic set]], which is a complete intersection), and thus all primary components have height two. Therefore, the associated primes of {{math|''I''}} are exactly the primes ideals of height two that contain {{math|''I''}}.\n\nIt follows that <math>\\langle x,y\\rangle</math> is an associated prime of {{math|''I''}}.\n\nLet <math>D\\in k[z_1, \\ldots, z_h]</math> be the [[Resultant#Homogeneous resultant|homogeneous resultant]] in {{math|''x'', ''y''}} of {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}}. As the greatest common divisor of {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} is a constant, the resultant {{math|''D''}} is not zero, and resultant theory implies that {{math|''I''}} contains all products of {{math|''D''}} by a [[monomial]] in {{math|''x'', ''y''}} of degree {{math|''m'' + ''n'' – 1}}. As <math>D\\not\\in \\langle x,y\\rangle,</math> all these monomials belong to the primary component contained in <math>\\langle x,y\\rangle.</math> This primary component contains {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}}, and the behavior of primary decompositions under [[localization of a ring|localization]] shows that this primary component is \n:<math>\\{t|\\exists e, D^et \\in I\\}.</math>\n\nIn short, we have a primary component, with the very simple associated prime <math>\\langle x,y\\rangle,</math> such all its generating sets involve all indeterminates.\n\nThe other primary component contains {{math|''D''}}. One may prove that if {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} are sufficiently [[generic property|generic]] (for example if the coefficients of {{math|''P''}} and {{math|''Q''}} are distinct indeterminates), then there is only another primary component, which is a prime ideal, and is generated by {{math|''P''}}, {{math|''Q''}} and {{math|''D''}}.\n\n== Geometric interpretation ==\nIn [[algebraic geometry]], an [[affine algebraic set]] {{math|''V''(''I'')}} is defined as the set of the common [[zero of a function|zeros]] of an ideal {{math|''I''}} of a [[polynomial ring]] <math>R=k[x_1,\\ldots, x_n].</math>\n\nAn irredundant primary decomposition\n:<math>I=Q_1\\cap\\cdots\\cap Q_r</math>\nof {{math|''I''}} defines a decomposition of {{math|''V''(''I'')}} into a union of algebraic sets {{math|''V''(''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>)}}, which are irreducible, as not being the union of two smaller algebraic sets.\n\nIf <math>P_i</math> is the [[associated prime]] of <math>Q_i</math>, then <math>V(P_i)=V(Q_i),</math> and Lasker–Noether theorem shows that {{math|''V''(''I'')}} has a unique irredundant decomposition into irreducible [[algebraic varieties]]\n:<math>V(I)=\\bigcup V(P_i),</math> \nwhere the union is restricted to minimal associated primes. These minimal associated primes are the primary components of the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of {{math|''I''}}. For this reason, the primary decomposition of the radical of {{math|''I''}} is sometimes called the ''prime decomposition'' of {{math|''I''}}.\n\nThe components of a primary decomposition (as well as of the algebraic set decomposition) corresponding to minimal primes are said ''isolated'', and the others are said ''embedded''.\n\nFor the decomposition of algebraic varieties, only the minimal primes are interesting, but in [[intersection theory]], and, more generally in [[scheme theory]], the complete primary decomposition has a geometric meaning.\n\n== Proof ==\nNowadays, it is common to do primary decomposition within the theory of [[associated prime]]s. The proof below is in the spirit of this approach.<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Theorem 11}}</ref>\n\nLet ''M'' be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring ''R'' and ''N'' a submodule. To show ''N'' admits a primary decomposition, by replacing ''M'' by <math>M/N</math>, it is enough to show that when <math>N = 0</math>. Now,\n:<math>0 = \\cap Q_i \\iff \\emptyset = \\operatorname{Ass}(\\cap Q_i) = \\cap \\operatorname{Ass}(Q_i)</math>\nwhere <math>Q_i</math> are primary submodules of ''M''. In other words, 0 has a primary decomposition if, for each associated prime ''P'' of ''M'', there is a primary submodule ''Q'' such that <math>P \\not\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(Q)</math>. Now, consider the set <math>\\{ N \\subseteq M | P \\not\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(N) \\}</math> (which is nonempty since zero is in it). The set has a maximal element ''Q'' since ''M'' is a Noetherian module. If ''Q'' is not ''P''-primary, say, <math>P' \\ne P</math> is associated with <math>M/Q</math>, then <math>R/P' \\simeq Q'/Q</math> for some submodule ''Q<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', contradicting the maximality. (Note: <math>P \\not\\in \\operatorname{Ass}(Q) \\subset \\operatorname{Ass}(Q')</math>.) Thus, ''Q'' is primary and the proof is complete.\n\nRemark: The same proof shows that if ''R'', ''M'', ''N'' are all graded, then <math>Q_i</math> in the decomposition may be taken to be graded as well.\n\n==Minimal decompositions and uniqueness==\n\nIn this section, all modules will be finitely generated over a Noetherian ring ''R''.\n\nA primary decomposition of a submodule ''M'' of a module ''N'' is called '''minimal''' if it has the smallest possible number of primary modules. For minimal decompositions, the primes of the primary modules are uniquely determined: they are the associated primes of ''N''/''M''. Moreover, the primary submodules associated to the '''minimal''' or '''[[associated prime|isolated]]''' associated primes (those not containing any other associated primes) are also unique. However the primary submodules associated to the non-minimal associated primes (called '''[[embedded prime]]s''' for geometric reasons) need not be unique.\n\nExample: Let ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''[''x'',&nbsp;''y''] for some field ''k'', and let ''M'' be the ideal (''xy'',&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>). Then ''M'' has two different minimal primary decompositions\n''M'' = (''y'') &cap; (''x'', ''y''<sup>2</sup>) = (''y'') &cap; (''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y'',&nbsp;''y''<sup>2</sup>).\nThe minimal prime is (''y'') and the embedded prime is (''x'',&nbsp;''y'').\n\n== Non-Noetherian case ==\nThe next theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ring to have primary decompositions for its ideals.\n{{math_theorem|math_statement=Let ''R'' be a commutative ring. Then the following are equivalent.\n# Every ideal in ''R'' has a primary decomposition.\n# ''R'' has the following properties:\n#*(L1) For every proper ideal ''I'' and a prime ideal ''P'', there exists an ''x'' in ''R'' - ''P'' such that (''I'' : ''x'') is the pre-image of ''I'' ''R''<sub>''P''</sub> under the localization map ''R'' → ''R''<sub>''P''</sub>.\n#*(L2) For every ideal ''I'', the set of all pre-images of ''I'' ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''R'' under the localization map ''R'' → ''S''<sup>−1</sup>''R'', ''S'' running over all multiplicatively closed subsets of ''R'', is finite.}}\n\nThe proof is given at Chapter 4 of Atiyah–MacDonald as a series of exercises.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969}}</ref>\n\nThere is the following uniqueness theorem for an ideal having a primary decomposition.\n\n{{math_theorem|Let ''R'' be a commutative ring and ''I'' an ideal. Suppose ''I'' has a minimal primary decomposition <math>I = \\cap_1^r Q_i</math> (note: \"minimal\" implies <math>\\sqrt{Q_i}</math> are distinct.) Then\n# The set <math>E = \\left \\{ \\sqrt{Q_i} | 1 \\le i \\le r \\right \\}</math> is the set of all prime ideals in the set <math>\\left\\{ \\sqrt{(I : x)} | x \\in R \\right\\}</math>.\n# The set of minimal elements of ''E'' is the same as the set of [[minimal prime ideal]]s over ''I''. Moreover, the primary ideal corresponding to a minimal prime ''P'' is the pre-image of ''I'' ''R''<sub>''P''</sub> and thus is uniquely determined by ''I''.}}\n\nNow, for any commutative ring ''R'',  an ideal ''I'' and a minimal prime ''P'' over ''I'', the pre-image of ''I'' ''R''<sub>''P''</sub> under the localization map is the smallest ''P''-primary ideal containing ''I''.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch. 4. Exercise 11}}</ref> Thus, in the setting of preceding theorem, the primary ideal ''Q'' corresponding to a minimal prime ''P'' is also the smallest ''P''-primary ideal containing ''I'' and is called the ''P''-primary component of ''I''.\n\nFor example, if the power ''P''<sup>''n''</sup> of a prime ''P'' has a primary decomposition, then its ''P''-primary component is the ''n''-th [[symbolic power of a prime ideal|symbolic power]] of ''P''.\n\n==Additive theory of ideals==\n\nThis result is the first in an area now known as the additive theory of ideals, which studies the ways of representing an ideal as the intersection of a special class of ideals. The decision on the \"special class\", e.g., primary ideals, is a problem in itself. In the case of non-commutative rings, the class of [[tertiary ideal]]s is a useful substitute for the class of primary ideals.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[[Michael Atiyah|M.

      "text": "In [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], the '''primitive element theorem''' or '''Artin's theorem on primitive elements''' is a result characterizing the finite degree [[field extension]]s that possess a '''primitive element''', or [[simple extension]]s. It says that a finite extension is simple if and only if there are only finitely many intermediate fields. In particular, finite [[separable extension|separable]] extensions are simple.\n\n== Terminology ==\nLet <math>E/F</math> be a ''[[field extension]]''. An element <math>\\alpha\\in E</math> is a ''primitive element'' for <math>E/F</math> when\n<math>E=F(\\alpha).</math>\n\nIf there exists such a primitive element, then <math>E/F</math> is referred to as a ''[[simple extension]]''. \nIf the [[field extension]] is of finite degree <math>n = [E:F]</math>, then every element ''x'' of ''E'' can be written in the form\n\n:<math>x=f_{n-1}{\\alpha}^{n-1}+\\cdots+f_1{\\alpha}+f_0,</math>\n\nwhere <math>f_i\\in F</math> for all ''i'', and <math>\\alpha\\in E</math> is fixed.

From the time of Galois, the role of primitive elements had been to represent a [[splitting field]] as generated by a single element. This (arbitrary) choice of such an element was bypassed in Artin's treatment.<ref>Israel Kleiner, ''A History of Abstract Algebra'' (2007), p. 64.</ref> At the same time, considerations of construction of such an element receded: the theorem becomes an [[existence theorem]].\n\nThe following theorem of Artin then takes the place of the classical ''primitive element theorem''.\n\n;Theorem\n\nLet <math>E/F</math> be a finite degree [[field extension]]. Then <math>E=F(\\alpha)</math> for some element <math>\\alpha\\in E</math> if and only if there exist only finitely many intermediate fields ''K'' with <math>E\\supseteq K\\supseteq F</math>.\n\nA corollary to the theorem is then the primitive element theorem in the more traditional sense (where separability was usually tacitly assumed):\n\n;Corollary\n\nLet <math>E/F</math> be a finite degree [[separable extension]]. Then <math>E=F(\\alpha)</math> for some <math>\\alpha\\in E</math>.\n\nThe corollary applies to [[algebraic number field]]s, i.e. finite extensions of the rational numbers '''Q''', since '''Q''' has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0 and therefore every extension over '''Q''' is separable.\n\n==Counterexamples==\n\nFor non-separable extensions, necessarily in [[characteristic p]] with ''p'' a prime number, then at least when the degree [''L''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''K''] is ''p'', ''L''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''K'' has a primitive element, because there are no intermediate subfields. When [''L''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''K''] = ''p''<sup>2</sup>, there may not be a primitive element (and therefore there are infinitely many intermediate fields). This happens, for example if ''K'' is\n\n:''F<sub>p</sub>''(''T'',&nbsp;''U''),\n\nthe field of rational functions in two indeterminates ''T'' and ''U'' over the [[finite field]] with ''p'' elements, and ''L'' is obtained from ''K'' by adjoining a ''p''-th root of ''T'', and of ''U''. In fact one can see that for any &alpha; in ''L'', the element ''&alpha;''<sup>''p''</sup> lies in ''K'', but a primitive element must have degree ''p''<sup>2</sup> over ''K''.\n\n==Constructive results==\n\nGenerally, the set of all primitive elements for a finite separable extension ''L''&nbsp;/&nbsp;''K'' is the complement of a finite collection of proper ''K''-subspaces of&nbsp;''L'', namely the intermediate fields. This statement says nothing for the case of [[finite field]]s, for which there is a computational theory dedicated to finding a generator of the [[multiplicative group]] of the field (a [[cyclic group]]), which is ''a fortiori'' a primitive element. Where ''K'' is infinite, a [[pigeonhole principle]] proof technique considers the linear subspace generated by two elements and proves that there are only finitely many linear combinations\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\alpha + c \\beta\\ </math>\n\nwith ''c'' in ''K'', that fail to generate the subfield containing both elements. This is almost immediate as a way of showing how Artin's result implies the classical result, and a bound for the number of exceptional ''c'' in terms of the number of intermediate fields results (this number being something that can be bounded itself by Galois theory and ''a priori''). Therefore, in this case trial-and-error is a possible practical method to find primitive elements. See the Example.\n\n== Example ==\nIt is not, for example, immediately obvious that if one adjoins to the field <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> of [[rational number]]s roots of both [[polynomial]]s\n\n:<math>x^2 - 2\\ </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>x^2 - 3,\\ </math>\n\nsay <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> respectively, to get a field ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;<math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2},\\sqrt{3})</math> of [[Degree of a field extension|degree]] 4 over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>, that the extension is simple and there exists a primitive element &gamma; in ''K'' so that ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;<math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)</math>. One can in fact check that with\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{3} </math>\n\nthe powers &gamma;<sup>&nbsp;''i''</sup> for 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;''i''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 can be written out as [[linear combination]]s of 1, <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, <math>\\sqrt{3}</math>, and <math>\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}=\\sqrt{6}</math> with integer coefficients. Taking these as a [[system of linear equations]], or by factoring, one can solve for <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> and <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> over <math>\\mathbb{Q}(\\gamma)</math> (one gets, for instance, <math>\\sqrt{2} = \\scriptstyle\\frac{\\gamma^3-9\\gamma}2</math>), which implies that this choice of &gamma; is indeed a primitive element in this example. A simpler argument, assuming the knowledge of all the subfields as given by [[Galois theory]], is to note the independence of 1, <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>, <math>\\sqrt{3}</math>, and <math>\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}</math> over the rationals; this shows that the subfield generated by &gamma; cannot be that generated by <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> or <math>\\sqrt{3}</math> or <math>\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{3}</math>, exhausting all the subfields of degree 2. Therefore, it must be the whole field.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Primitive element (finite field)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/ft.html J.

It states that every finitely generated [[projective module]] over a [[polynomial ring]] is [[free module|free]].\n\nGeometrically, finitely generated projective modules over the ring <math>R[x_1,\\dots,x_n]</math> correspond to [[vector bundle]]s over [[affine space]] <math>\\mathbb{A}^n_R</math>, where free modules correspond to trivial vector bundles.

[[Jean-Pierre Serre]], in his 1955 paper [[List of important publications in mathematics#Faisceaux Algébriques Cohérents|''Faisceaux algébriques cohérents'']], remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: \"It is not known whether there exist projective ''A''-modules of finite type which are not free.\"<ref>\"On ignore s'il existe des A-modules projectifs de type fini qui ne soient pas libres.\"  Serre, ''FAC'', p. 243.</ref>  Here <math>A</math> is a [[polynomial ring]] over a field, that is, <math>A</math> = <math>k[x_1,\\dots,x_n]</math>.\n\nTo Serre's dismay, this problem quickly became known as Serre's conjecture.  (Serre wrote, \"I objected as often as I could [to the name].\"<ref>Lam, p. 1</ref>)  The statement does not immediately follow from the proofs given in the topological or holomorphic case. These cases only guarantee that there is a continuous or holomorphic trivialization, not an algebraic trivialization. Serre made some progress towards a solution in 1957 when he proved that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring over a field was [[stably free]], meaning that after forming its direct sum with a finitely generated free module, it became free.  The problem remained open until 1976, when [[Daniel Quillen]] and [[Andrei Suslin]] independently proved the result. Quillen was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1978 in part for his proof of the Serre conjecture. [[Leonid Vaseršteĭn]] later gave a simpler and much shorter proof of the theorem which can be found in Serge Lang's ''Algebra''.\n\nA generalization relating projective modules over regular Noetherian rings ''A'' and their polynomial rings is known as the [[Bass–Quillen conjecture]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n | last = Serre\n | first = Jean-Pierre\n | authorlink = Jean-Pierre Serre\n |date=March 1955\n | title = Faisceaux algébriques cohérents\n | journal = [[Annals of Mathematics]] |series = Second Series\n | volume = 61\n | pages = 197–278\n | doi = 10.2307/1969915\n | jstor = 1969915\n | issue = 2 \n | mr = 0068874\n}}\n*{{Citation\n | last = Serre\n | first = Jean-Pierre\n | authorlink = Jean-Pierre Serre\n | year = 1958\n | chapter = Modules projectifs et espaces fibrés à fibre vectorielle\n | title = Séminaire P.

Item 2 is much deeper.\n\nFor an integral domain, the criterion is due to Krull. The general case is due to Serre.\n\n== Proof ==\n\n===Sufficiency===\n(After EGA IV. Theorem 5.8.6.)\n\nSuppose ''A'' satisfies ''S''<sub>2</sub> and ''R''<sub>1</sub>. Then ''A'' in particular satisfies ''S''<sub>1</sub> and ''R''<sub>0</sub>; hence, it is reduced. If <math>\\mathfrak{p}_i, \\, 1 \\le i \\le r</math> are the minimal prime ideals of ''A'', then the [[total ring of fractions]] ''K'' of ''A'' is the direct product of the residue fields <math>\\kappa(\\mathfrak{p}_i) = Q(A/\\mathfrak{p}_i)</math>: see [[total ring of fractions#Total ring of fractions of a reduced ring|total ring of fractions of a reduced ring]]. That means we can write <math>1 = e_1 + \\dots + e_r</math> where <math>e_i</math> are idempotents in <math>\\kappa(\\mathfrak{p}_i)</math> and such that <math>e_i e_j = 0, \\, i \\ne j</math>. Now, if ''A'' is integrally closed in ''K'', then each <math>e_i</math> is integral over ''A'' and so is in ''A''; consequently, ''A'' is a direct product of integrally closed domains ''Ae''<sub>''i''</sub>'s and we are done. Thus, it is enough to show that ''A'' is integrally closed in ''K''.\n\nFor this end, suppose\n:<math>(f/g)^n + a_1 (f/g)^{n-1} + \\dots + a_n = 0</math>\nwhere all ''f'', ''g'', ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are in ''A'' and ''g'' is moreover a non-zerodivisor. We want to show:\n:<math>f \\in gA</math>.\nNow, the condition ''S''<sub>2</sub> says that <math>gA</math> is [[unmixed theorem|unmixed]] of height one; i.e., each [[associated prime]]s <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> of <math>A/gA</math> has height one. By the condition ''R''<sub>1</sub>, the localization <math>A_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> is integrally closed and so <math>\\phi(f) \\in \\phi(g)A_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math>, where <math>\\phi: A \\to A_{\\mathfrak{p}}</math> is the localization map, since the integral equation persists after localization. If <math>gA = \\cap_i \\mathfrak{q}_i</math> is the [[primary decomposition]], then, for any ''i'', the radical of <math>\\mathfrak{q}_i</math> is an associated prime <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> of <math>A/gA</math> and so <math>f \\in \\phi^{-1}(\\mathfrak{q}_i A_{\\mathfrak{p}}) = \\mathfrak{q}_i</math>; the equality here is because <math>\\mathfrak{q}_i</math> is a <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>-[[primary ideal]]. Hence, the assertion holds.\n\n===Necessity===\nSuppose ''A'' is a [[normal ring]]. For ''S''<sub>2</sub>, let <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> be an associated prime of <math>A/fA</math> for a non-zerodivisor ''f''; we need to show it has height one. Replacing ''A'' by a localization, we can assume ''A'' is a local ring with maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. By definition, there is an element ''g'' in ''A'' such that <math>\\mathfrak{p} = \\{ x \\in A | xg \\equiv 0 \\text{ mod }fA \\}</math> and <math>g \\not\\in fA</math>. Put ''y'' = ''g''/''f'' in the total ring of fractions. If <math>y \\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathfrak{p}</math>, then <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is a faithful <math>A[y]</math>-module and is a finitely generated ''A''-module; consequently, <math>y</math> is integral over ''A'' and thus in ''A'', a contradiction. Hence, <math>y \\mathfrak{p} = A</math> or <math>\\mathfrak{p} = f/g A</math>, which implies <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> has height one ([[Krull's principal ideal theorem]]).\n\nFor ''R''<sub>1</sub>, we argue in the same way: let <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> be a prime ideal of height one. Localizing at <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> we assume <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is a maximal ideal and the similar argument as above shows that <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> is in fact principal. Thus, ''A'' is a regular local ring. <math>\\square</math>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{EGA | book=IV-2}}\n*H.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_theorem_for_finitely_generated_modules_over_a_principal_ideal_domain",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the field of [[abstract algebra]], the '''structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain''' is a generalization of the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]] and roughly states that finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain can be uniquely decomposed in much the same way that integers have a [[prime factorization]].  The result provides a simple framework to understand various canonical form results for square matrices over fields.\n\n==Statement==\n\nWhen a vector space over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' has a finite generating set, then one may extract from it a [[basis (vector space)|basis]] consisting of a finite number ''n'' of vectors, and the space is therefore isomorphic to ''F<sup>n</sup>''. The corresponding statement with the ''F'' generalized to a [[principal ideal domain]] ''R'' is no longer true, since a basis for a [[finitely generated module]] over ''R'' might not exist. However such a module is still isomorphic to a quotient of some module ''R<sup>n</sup>'' with ''n'' finite (to see this it suffices to construct the morphism that sends the elements of the canonical basis of ''R<sup>n</sup>'' to the generators of the module, and take the quotient by its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]].) By changing the choice of generating set, one can in fact describe the module as the quotient of some ''R<sup>n</sup>'' by a particularly simple submodule, and this is the structure theorem.\n\nThe structure theorem for [[finitely generated module]]s over a [[principal ideal domain]] usually appears in the following two forms.\n\n===Invariant factor decomposition===\nFor every finitely generated module {{math|''M''}} over a principal ideal domain {{math|''R''}}, there is a unique decreasing sequence of proper ideals <math>(d_1)\\supseteq(d_2)\\supseteq\\cdots\\supseteq(d_n)</math> such that {{math|''M''}} is isomorphic to the sum of cyclic modules:\n:<math>M\\cong\\bigoplus_i R/(d_i) = R/(d_1)\\oplus R/(d_2)\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus R/(d_n).</math>\nThe generators <math>d_i</math> of the ideals are unique up to multiplication by a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]], and are called [[invariant factor]]s of ''M''. Since the ideals should be proper, these factors must not themselves be invertible (this avoids trivial factors in the sum), and the inclusion of the ideals means one has divisibility <math>d_1\\mid d_2\\mid\\cdots\\mid d_n</math>. The free part is visible in the part of the decomposition corresponding to  factors <math>d_i = 0</math>. Such factors, if any, occur at the end of the sequence.\n\nWhile the direct sum is uniquely determined by {{math|''M''}}, the isomorphism giving the decomposition itself is ''not unique'' in general. For instance if {{math|''R''}} is actually a field, then all occurring ideals must be zero, and one obtains the decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces; the number of such factors is fixed, namely the dimension of the space, but there is in a lot of freedom for choosing the subspaces themselves (if {{math|dim ''M'' &gt; 1}}).\n\nThe nonzero <math>d_i</math> elements, together with the number of <math>d_i</math> which are zero, form a [[complete set of invariants]] for the module. Explicitly, this means that any two modules sharing the same set of invariants are necessarily isomorphic. \n\nSome prefer to write the free part of ''M'' separately:\n:<math>R^f \\oplus \\bigoplus_i R/(d_i)  = R^f \\oplus R/(d_1)\\oplus R/(d_2)\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus R/(d_{n-f})</math>\nwhere the visible <math>d_i</math> are nonzero, and ''f'' is the number of <math>d_i</math>'s in the original sequence which are 0.\n\n===Primary decomposition===\n:Every [[finitely generated module]] ''M'' over a [[principal ideal domain]] ''R'' is isomorphic to one of the form\n::<math>\\bigoplus_i R/(q_i)</math>\n:where <math>(q_i) \\neq R</math> and the <math>(q_i)</math> are [[primary ideal]]s. The <math>q_i</math> are unique (up to multiplication by units). \n\nThe elements <math>q_i</math> are called the ''elementary divisors'' of ''M''. In a PID, nonzero primary ideals are powers of primes, and so <math>(q_i)=(p_i^{r_i}) = (p_i)^{r_i}</math>. When <math>q_i=0</math>, the resulting indecomposable module is <math>R</math> itself, and this is inside the part of ''M'' that is a free module.\n\nThe summands <math>R/(q_i)</math> are [[indecomposable module|indecomposable]], so the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, and thus every finitely generated module over a PID is a [[indecomposable module|completely decomposable module]]. Since PID's are Noetherian rings, this can be seen as a manifestation of the [[Lasker-Noether theorem]].\n\nAs before, it is possible to write the free part (where <math>q_i=0</math>) separately and express ''M'' as:\n:<math>R^f \\oplus(\\bigoplus_i R/(q_i))</math>\nwhere the visible <math>q_i </math> are nonzero.\n\n==Proofs==\nOne proof proceeds as follows:\n* Every [[finitely generated module]] over a PID is also [[finitely presented module|finitely presented]] because a PID is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], an even stronger condition than [[coherent ring|coherence]].\n* Take a presentation, which is a map <math>R^r \\to R^g</math> (relations to generators), and put it in [[Smith normal form]].\nThis yields the invariant factor decomposition, and the diagonal entries of Smith normal form are the invariant factors.\n\nAnother outline of a proof:\n* Denote by ''tM'' the [[torsion submodule]] of M. Then ''M''/''tM'' is a finitely generated [[torsion-free module|torsion free]] module, and such a module over a commutative PID is a [[free module]] of finite rank, so it is isomorphic to <math>R^n</math> for a positive integer ''n''. This free module can be embedded as a submodule ''F'' of ''M'', such that the embedding splits (is a right inverse of) the projection map; it suffices to lift each of the generators of ''F'' into ''M''. As a consequence <math>M= tM\\oplus F</math>.\n* For a prime ''p'' in ''R'' we can then speak of <math>N_p= \\{m\\in tM\\mid \\exists i,  mp^i=0\\}</math> for each prime ''p''.  This is a submodule of ''tM'', and it turns out that each ''N''<sub>''p''</sub> is a direct sum of cyclic modules, and that ''tM'' is a direct sum of ''N''<sub>''p''</sub> for a finite number of distinct primes ''p''.\n* Putting the previous two steps together, ''M'' is decomposed into cyclic modules of the indicated types.\n<!--\n(commented out because it is a bit misleading and contains errors) * A finitely generated module is [[projection (mathematics)|projective]] if and only if it is [[localization of a module|locally]] [[free module|free]].\n* PIDs are [[Dedekind domains]], i.e., they are [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]] and their [[Localization of a ring|localizations]] are [[discrete valuation ring]]s (DVRs).\n* Torsion free modules over DVRs are free. Hence, torsion free modules over PIDs are projective.\n* ''M/tM'' is torsion free, hence projective. Thus, ''M'' can be written as a direct sum of its torsion part and a projective part (in fact a free part), though not uniquely.\n*:That is, there is always a [[short exact sequence]] <math>0 \\to tM \\to M \\to M/tM \\to 0,</math> as the torsion part of a module is a submodule. By projectivity of <math>M/tM,</math> this has a splitting (a map <math>M/tM \\to M</math> such that <math>M/tM \\to M \\to M/tM</math> is the identity).\n* If ''M'' is projective, so is a direct summand of a free module ''F = M + N''. One proves that ''N'' is locally 0, and hence is 0. Therefore, ''M'' is free.\n* If ''M'' is torsion, it is the quotient of a free module. Using the ideas of the previous part, one proves it is a quotient by a free submodule, which must have rank equal to the original module. That is, torsion modules are finitely presented. Now use [[Smith normal form]].\n-->\n==Corollaries==\nThis includes the classification of [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s as a special case, where <math>R = K</math>. Since fields have no non-trivial ideals, every finitely generated vector space is free.\n\nTaking <math>R=\\mathbb{Z}</math> yields the [[fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups]].\n\nLet ''T'' be a linear operator on a  [[finite-dimensional vector space]] ''V'' over ''K''. Taking <math>R=K[T]</math>, the algebra of polynomials with coefficients in ''K'' evaluated at ''T'', yields structure information about ''T''. ''V'' can be viewed as a finitely generated module over <math>K[T]</math>. The last invariant factor is the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]], and the product of invariant factors is the [[characteristic polynomial]]. Combined with a standard matrix form for <math>K[T]/p(T)</math>, this yields various [[canonical form]]s:\n* [[invariant factors]] + [[companion matrix]] yields [[Frobenius normal form]] (aka, [[rational canonical form]])\n* [[primary decomposition]] + [[companion matrix]] yields [[primary rational canonical form]]\n* [[primary decomposition]] + [[Jordan block]]s yields [[Jordan canonical form]] (this latter only holds over an [[algebraically closed field]])\n\n==Uniqueness==\nWhile the invariants (rank, invariant factors, and elementary divisors) are unique, the isomorphism between ''M'' and its [[canonical form]] is not unique, and does not even preserve the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] decomposition. This follows because there are non-trivial automorphisms of these modules which do not preserve the summands.\n\nHowever, one has a canonical torsion submodule ''T'', and similar canonical submodules corresponding to each (distinct) invariant factor, which yield a canonical sequence:\n:<math>0 < \\cdots < T < M.</math>\nCompare [[composition series]] in [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]].\n\nFor instance, if <math>M \\approx \\mathbf{Z} \\oplus \\mathbf{Z}/2</math>, and <math>(1,0), (0,1)</math> is one basis, then\n<math>(1,1), (0,1)</math> is another basis, and the change of basis matrix <math>\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\\\0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}</math> does not preserve the summand <math>\\mathbf{Z}</math>. However, it does preserve the <math>\\mathbf{Z}/2</math> summand, as this is the torsion submodule (equivalently here, the 2-torsion elements).\n\n==Generalizations==\n===Groups===\nThe [[Jordan–Hölder theorem]] is a more general result for finite groups (or modules over an arbitrary ring). In this generality, one obtains a [[composition series]], rather than a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]].\n\nThe [[Krull–Schmidt theorem]] and related results give conditions under which a module has something like a primary decomposition, a decomposition as a direct sum of [[indecomposable module]]s in which the summands are unique up to order.\n\n===Primary decomposition===\nThe primary decomposition generalizes to finitely generated modules over commutative [[Noetherian ring]]s, and this result is called the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]].\n\n===Indecomposable modules===\nBy contrast, unique decomposition into ''indecomposable'' submodules does not generalize as far, and the failure is measured by the [[ideal class group]], which vanishes for PIDs.\n\nFor rings that are not principal ideal domains, unique decomposition need not even hold for modules over a ring generated by two elements. For the ring R&nbsp;=&nbsp;Z[√−5], both the module R and its submodule M generated by 2 and 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;√−5 are indecomposable. While R is not isomorphic to M, R&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;R is isomorphic to M&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;M; thus the images of the M summands give indecomposable submodules L<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;L<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;<&nbsp;R&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;R which give a different decomposition of R&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;R. The failure of uniquely factorizing R&nbsp;⊕&nbsp;R into a direct sum of indecomposable modules is directly related (via the ideal class group) to the failure of the unique factorization of elements of R into irreducible elements of&nbsp;R.\n\nHowever, over a [[Dedekind domain]] the ideal class group is the only obstruction, and the structure theorem generalizes to [[Dedekind domain#Finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain|finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain]] with minor modifications. There is still a unique torsion part, with a torsionfree complement (unique up to isomorphism), but a torsionfree module over a Dedekind domain is no longer necessarily free. Torsionfree modules over a Dedekind domain are determined (up to isomorphism) by rank and [[Steinitz class]] (which takes value in the ideal class group), and the decomposition into a direct sum of copies of R (rank one free modules) is replaced by a direct sum into rank one [[projective module]]s: the individual summands are not uniquely determined, but the Steinitz class (of the sum) is.\n\n===Non-finitely generated modules===\nSimilarly for modules that are not finitely generated, one cannot expect such a nice decomposition: even the number of factors may vary.  There are '''Z'''-submodules of '''Q'''<sup>4</sup> which are simultaneously direct sums of two indecomposable modules and direct sums of three indecomposable modules, showing the analogue of the primary decomposition cannot hold for infinitely generated modules, even over the integers, '''Z'''.\n\nAnother issue that arises with non-finitely generated modules is that there are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring '''Z''' of integers. Then '''Q''' is a torsion-free '''Z'''-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the [[Baer–Specker group]], the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which [[large cardinal]]s exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Dummit | first1=David S. | last2=Foote | first2=Richard M. | title=Abstract algebra | publisher=Wiley | location=New York | edition=3rd | isbn=978-0-471-43334-7 |mr=2286236 | year=2004}}\n*{{Citation | last=Hungerford | first1=Thomas W. | author1-link=Thomas W.

In other words, for [[finite ring]]s, there is no distinction between domains, [[skew-field]]s and fields.\n\nThe [[Artin–Zorn theorem]] generalizes the theorem to [[alternative ring]]s: every finite alternative division ring is a field.<ref>{{cite book | last=Shult | first=Ernest E. | title=Points and lines.

Another proof was given by [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]] shortly after Wedderburn's original proof, and Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. However, as noted in {{Harv|Parshall|1983}}, Wedderburn's first proof was incorrect – it had a gap – and his subsequent proofs appeared only after he had read Dickson's correct proof. On this basis, Parshall argues that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.\n\nA simplified version of the proof was later given by [[Ernst Witt]].<ref name=\"Lam-2001-p204\"/> Witt's proof is sketched below. Alternatively, the theorem is a consequence of the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]] by the following argument.<ref>Theorem 4.1 in Ch. IV of Milne, class field theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html</ref> Let ''D'' be a finite [[division algebra]] with [[Center (ring theory)|center]] ''k''. Let [''D'' : ''k''] = ''n''<sup>2</sup> and ''q'' denote the cardinality of ''k''. Every maximal subfield of ''D'' has ''q<sup>n</sup>'' elements; so they are isomorphic and thus are conjugate by Skolem–Noether. But a finite group (the multiplicative group of ''D'' in our case) cannot be a union of conjugates of a proper subgroup; hence, ''n'' = 1.\n\nA later \"[[Group theory|group-theoretic]]\" proof was given by [[Theodore Kaczynski]].<ref>{{cite journal |jstor = 2312328|title = Another Proof of Wedderburn's Theorem |first = T.J. |last = Kaczynski |journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] |volume=71 |issue=6 |pages=652-653 |date = June–July 1964}} (Jstor link, requires login)</ref>  This proof, Kaczynski's first published piece of mathematical writing, was a short, two-page note which also acknowledged the earlier historical proofs.\n\n== Relationship to the Brauer group of a finite field ==\nThe theorem is essentially equivalent to saying that the [[Brauer group]] of a finite field is trivial. In fact, this characterization immediately yields a proof of the theorem as follows: let ''k'' be a finite field. Since the [[Herbrand quotient]] vanishes by finiteness, <math>\\operatorname{Br}(k) = H^2(k^{\\text{al}}/k)</math> coincides with <math>H^1(k^{\\text{al}}/k)</math>, which in turn vanishes by [[Hilbert's theorem 90|Hilbert 90]].\n\n== Proof ==\nLet ''A''  be a finite domain. For each nonzero ''x'' in ''A'', the two maps\n:<math>a \\mapsto ax, a \\mapsto xa: A \\to A</math>\nare injective by the [[cancellation property]], and thus, surjective by counting. It follows from the elementary group theory<ref>e.g., Exercise 1.9 in Milne, group theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/GT.pdf</ref>  that the nonzero elements of ''A'' form a group under multiplication. Thus, ''A'' is a [[Division ring|skew-field]].\n\nTo prove that every finite skew-field is a field, we use strong induction on the size of the skew-field. Thus, let ''A'' be a skew-field, and assume that all skew-fields that are proper subsets of ''A'' are fields. Since the [[Center (ring theory)|center]] ''Z''(''A'') of ''A''  is a field,  ''A'' is a vector space over ''Z''(''A'') with finite dimension ''n''.  Our objective is then to show ''n'' = 1. If ''q'' is the order of ''Z''(''A''), then ''A'' has order ''q<sup>n</sup>''. Note that because ''Z''(''A'') contains the distinct elements 0 and 1, q>1. For each ''x'' in ''A'' that is not in the center, the [[Centralizer and normalizer|centralizer]] ''Z<sub>x</sub>'' of ''x'' is clearly a skew-field and thus a field, by the induction hypothesis, and because ''Z<sub>x</sub>'' can be viewed as a vector space over ''Z''(''A'') and ''A'' can be viewed as a vector space over ''Z<sub>x</sub>'', we have that ''Z<sub>x</sub>'' has order ''q<sup>d</sup>'' where ''d'' divides ''n'' and is less than ''n''. Viewing ''Z''(''A'')*, ''A*'', and the ''Z*<sub>x</sub>''   as groups under multiplication, we can write the [[Conjugacy class#Conjugacy class equation|class equation]]\n:<math>q^n - 1 = q - 1 + \\sum {q^n - 1 \\over q^d - 1}</math>\nwhere the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes not contained within ''Z''(''A'')*, and the ''d'' are defined so that for each conjugacy class, the order of ''Z*<sub>x</sub>'' for any ''x'' in the class is ''q<sup>d</sup>''-1. ''q<sup>n</sup>''−1 and ''q<sup>d</sup>''−1 both admit [[polynomial factorization]] in terms of [[cyclotomic polynomials]]\n:<math>\\Phi_f(q)</math>.\n\nIn the polynomial identities\n:<math>x^n-1 = \\prod_{m|n} \\Phi_m(x)</math> and <math>x^d-1 = \\prod_{m|d} \\Phi_m(x)</math>,\n\nwe set ''x'' = ''q''. Because each ''d'' is a proper divisor of ''n'',\n:<math>\\Phi_n(q)</math> divides both ''q<sup>n</sup>''−1 and each <math>{q^n - 1 \\over q^d - 1}</math>,\n\nso by the above class equation <math>\\Phi_n(q)</math> must divide ''q''−1, and therefore\n:<math>|\\Phi_n(q)| \\leq q-1</math>.\n\nTo see that this forces ''n'' to be 1, we will show\n:<math>|\\Phi_n(q)| > q-1</math>\n\nfor ''n'' > 1 using factorization over the complex numbers. In the polynomial identity\n:<math>\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod (x - \\zeta)</math>,\n\nwhere ζ runs over the primitive ''n''-th roots of unity, set ''x'' to be ''q'' and then take absolute values\n:<math>|\\Phi_n(q)| = \\prod |q - \\zeta|</math>.\n\nFor ''n'' > 1, we see that for each primitive ''n''-th root of unity ζ,\n:<math>|q-\\zeta| > |q-1|</math>\n\nbecause of the location of ''q'', 1, and ζ in the complex plane. Thus\n:<math>|\\Phi_n(q)| > q-1</math>.\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal | last = Parshall | first = K.

      "text": "In [[algebra]], '''Zariski's lemma''', proved by {{harvs|txt|first=Oscar|last= Zariski|authorlink=Oscar Zariski|year=1947}}, states that, if a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}} is [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] as an [[associative algebra]] over another field {{math|''k''}}, then {{math|''K''}} is a [[finite field extension]] of {{math|''k''}} (that is, it is also finitely generated as a [[vector space]]).\n\nAn important application of the lemma is a proof of the weak form of [[Hilbert's nullstellensatz]]:<ref>{{harvnb|Milne|loc=Theorem 2.6}}</ref> if ''I'' is a proper [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of <math>k[t_1, ..., t_n]</math> (''k'' [[algebraically closed field]]), then ''I'' has a zero; i.e., there is a point ''x'' in <math>k^n</math> such that <math>f(x) = 0</math> for all ''f'' in ''I''. (Proof: replacing ''I'' by a [[maximal ideal]] <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math>, we can assume <math>I = \\mathfrak{m}</math> is maximal. Let <math>A = k[t_1, ..., t_n]</math> and <math>\\phi: A \\to A / \\mathfrak{m}</math> be the natural surjection.

In general, a ring ''R'' is a [[Jacobson ring]] if and only if every finitely generated ''R''-algebra that is a field is finite over ''R''.<ref name=Jacobson>{{harvnb|Atiyah-MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch 5. Exercise 25}}</ref> Thus, the lemma follows from the fact that a field is a Jacobson ring.\n\n== Proof ==\nTwo direct proofs, one of which is due to Zariski, are given in Atiyah–MacDonald.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch 5. Exercise 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah–MacDonald|1969|loc=Proposition 7.9}}</ref> For Zariski's original proof, see the original paper.<ref>http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183510605</ref> Another direct proof in the language of [[Jacobson ring]]s is given below. The lemma is also a consequence of the [[Noether normalization lemma]]. Indeed, by the normalization lemma, ''K'' is a [[finitely generated module|finite module]] over the polynomial ring <math>k[x_1, \\ldots , x_d]</math> where <math>x_1, \\ldots , x_d</math> are elements of ''K'' that are algebraically independent over ''k''. But since ''K'' has Krull dimension zero and since an [[integral ring extension]] (e.g., a finite ring extension) preserves Krull dimensions, the polynomial ring must have dimension zero; i.e., <math>d=0</math>.\n\nThe following characterization of a Jacobson ring contains Zariski's lemma as a special case. Recall that a ring is a Jacobson ring if every prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. (When ''A'' is a field, ''A'' is a Jacobson ring and the theorem below is precisely Zariski's lemma.)\n\n{{math_theorem|math_statement=<ref name=Jacobson /> Let ''A'' be a ring. Then the following are equivalent.\n# ''A'' is a Jacobson ring.\n# Every finitely generated ''A''-algebra ''B'' that is a field is finite over ''A''.}}\nProof: 2. <math>\\Rightarrow</math> 1.: Let <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> be a prime ideal of ''A'' and set <math>B = A/\\mathfrak{p}</math>. We need to show the [[Jacobson radical]] of ''B'' is zero. For that end, let ''f'' be a nonzero element of ''B''. Let <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> be a maximal ideal of the localization <math>B[f^{-1}]</math>. Then <math>B[f^{-1}]/\\mathfrak{m}</math> is a field that is a finitely generated ''A''-algebra and so is finite over ''A'' by assumption; thus it is finite over <math>B = A/\\mathfrak{p}</math> and so is finite over the subring <math>B/\\mathfrak{q}</math> where <math>\\mathfrak{q} = \\mathfrak{m} \\cap B</math>. By integrality, <math>\\mathfrak{q}</math> is a maximal ideal not containing ''f''.\n\n1. <math>\\Rightarrow</math> 2.: Since a factor ring of a Jacobson ring is Jacobson, we can assume ''B'' contains ''A'' as a subring. Then the assertion is a consequence of the next algebraic fact:\n\n:(*) Let <math>B \\supset A</math> be integral domains such that ''B'' is finitely generated as ''A''-algebra. Then there exists a nonzero ''a'' in ''A'' such that every ring homomorphism <math>\\phi: A \\to K</math>, ''K'' an algebraically closed field, with <math>\\phi(a) \\ne 0</math> extends to <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}: B \\to K</math>.\n\nIndeed, choose a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> of ''A'' not containing ''a''. Writing ''K'' for some algebraic closure of <math>A/\\mathfrak{m}</math>, the canonical map <math>\\phi: A \\to A/\\mathfrak{m} \\hookrightarrow K</math> extends to <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}: B \\to K</math>. Since ''B'' is a field, <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}</math> is injective and so ''B'' is algebraic (thus finite algebraic) over <math>A/\\mathfrak{m}</math>.  We now prove (*). If ''B'' contains an element that is transcendental over ''A'', then it contains a polynomial ring over ''A'' to which ''φ'' extends (without a requirement on ''a'') and so we can assume ''B'' is algebraic over ''A'' (by Zorn's lemma, say). Let <math>x_1, \\dots, x_r</math> be the generators of ''B'' as ''A''-algebra. Then each <math>x_i</math> satisfies the relation\n:<math>a_{i0}x_i^n + a_{i1}x_i^{n-1} + \\dots + a_{in} = 0, \\, \\, a_{ij} \\in A</math>\nwhere ''n'' depends on ''i'' and <math>a_{i0} \\ne 0</math>. Set <math>a = a_{10}a_{20} \\dots a_{r0}</math>. Then <math>B[a^{-1}]</math> is integral over <math>A[a^{-1}]</math>. Now given <math>\\phi: A \\to K</math>, we first extend it to <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}: A[a^{-1}] \\to K</math> by setting <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}(a^{-1}) = \\phi(a)^{-1}</math>. Next, let <math>\\mathfrak{m} = \\operatorname{ker}\\widetilde{\\phi}</math>. By integrality, <math>\\mathfrak{m} = \\mathfrak{n} \\cap A[a^{-1}]</math> for some maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{n}</math> of <math>B[a^{-1}]</math>. Then <math>\\widetilde{\\phi}: A[a^{-1}] \\to A[a^{-1}]/\\mathfrak{m} \\to K</math> extends to <math>B[a^{-1}] \\to B[a^{-1}]/\\mathfrak{n} \\to K</math>.

A consequence is that the complex torus is algebraic if and only if there is a positive definite Hermitian form whose imaginary part is integral on ''U''×''U''.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|authorlink=Paul Émile Appell|first=P.|last=Appell|title=Sur les functiones périodiques de deux variables|journal=J. de math Sér IV|volume=7|pages=157–219|year=1891|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k107455z.image.f159.langFR}}\n*{{citation|first=G.|last=Humbert|title=Théorie générale des surfaces hyperelliptiques|journal=J. de math Sér IV|volume=9|pages=29–170, 361–475|year=1893|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k107457q.image.f29.langFR}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Lefschetz | first1=Solomon | title=On Certain Numerical Invariants of Algebraic Varieties with Application to Abelian Varieties | jstor=1988897 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1921 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=22 | issue=3 | pages=327–406 | doi=10.2307/1988897}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Lefschetz | first1=Solomon | title=On Certain Numerical Invariants of Algebraic Varieties with Application to Abelian Varieties | jstor=1988964 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | year=1921 | journal=[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9947 | volume=22 | issue=4 | pages= 407–482 | doi=10.2307/1988964}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Mumford | first1=David | author1-link=David Mumford | title=Abelian varieties | origyear=1970 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Studies in Mathematics | isbn=978-81-85931-86-9 | oclc=138290 | mr=0282985 | year=2008 | volume=5}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Appell-Humbert theorem}}\n[[Category:Abelian varieties]]\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]\n[[Category:Theorems in complex geometry]]"

Let <math>B' = B \\otimes_A A'</math>. In this situation, given a ''B''-module ''M'', there is an isomorphism (of ''A' ''-modules):\n\n:<math>(M \\otimes_B B')_{A'} \\cong (M_A) \\otimes_A A'.</math>\n\nHere the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e., <math>M_A</math> is ''M'', but regarded as an ''A''-module.\nIndeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing \n\n:<math>M \\otimes_B B' = M \\otimes_B B \\otimes_A A' \\cong M \\otimes_A A'.</math>\n\nThus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism.\nThe base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.\n\n== Definition of the base change map ==\n{{Images of sheaves}}\nThe base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following ''base change map''\n\n:<math>g^*(R^r f_* \\mathcal{F}) \\to R^r f'_*(g'^*\\mathcal{F})</math>\n\nis an isomorphism, where\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl} X' & \\stackrel{g'}\\to & X \\\\\nf' \\downarrow & & \\downarrow f \\\\\nS' & \\stackrel g \\to & S\\\\ \\end{array}</math>\n\nare continuous maps between topological spaces that form a [[Cartesian square (category theory)|Cartesian square]] and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is a sheaf on ''X''.<ref>\nThe roles of <math>X</math> and <math>S'</math> are symmetric, and in some contexts (especially smooth base change) the more familiar formulation is the other one (dealing instead with the map <math>f^* R^i g_* \\mathcal G \\rightarrow R^i g'_* f'^* \\mathcal G</math> for <math>\\mathcal G</math> a sheaf on <math>S'</math>). For consistency, the results in this article below are all stated for the '''same''' situation, namely the map <math>g^* R^i f_* \\mathcal F \\rightarrow R^i f'_* g'^* \\mathcal F</math>; but readers should be sure to check this against their expectations.</ref> Here <math>R^i f_* \\mathcal F</math> denotes the [[higher direct image]] of <math>\\mathcal F</math> under ''f'', i.e., the [[derived functor]] of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor <math>f_*</math>.\n\nThis map exists without any assumptions on the maps ''f'' and ''g''. It is constructed as follows: since <math>g'^*</math> is [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]] to <math>g'_*</math>, there is a natural map (called unit map)\n:<math>\\operatorname{id} \\to g'_* \\circ g'^*</math>\nand so \n\n:<math>R^r f_* \\to R^r f_* \\circ g'_* \\circ g'^*.</math>\n\nThe [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]] then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:\n\n:<math>R^r f_* \\circ g'_* \\circ g'^* \\to R^r(f \\circ g')_* \\circ g'^* = R^r(g \\circ f')_* \\circ g'^* \\to g_* \\circ R^r f'_* \\circ g'^*.</math>\n\nCombining this with the above yields\n\n:<math>R^r f_* \\to g_* \\circ R^r f'_* \\circ g'^*.</math>\n\nUsing the adjointness of <math>g^*</math> and <math>g_*</math> finally yields the desired map.\n\nThe above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the affine schemes <math>X = \\operatorname{Spec} (B), S = \\operatorname{Spec} (A), S' = \\operatorname{Spec} (A')</math> and, consequently, <math>X' = \\operatorname{Spec} (B')</math>, and the [[quasi-coherent sheaf]] <math>\\mathcal F := \\tilde M</math> associated to the ''B''-module ''M''.\n\nIt is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all <math>R^r f_*</math> at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the [[derived category]] of sheaves on ''S':''\n\n:<math>g^* Rf_* (\\mathcal{F}) \\to Rf'_*(g'^*\\mathcal{F})</math>\n\nwhere <math>Rf_*</math> denotes the (total) derived functor of <math>f_*</math>.\n\n== General topology ==\n===Proper base change===\nIf ''X'' is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological space]], ''S'' is a [[locally compact space|locally compact]] Hausdorff space and ''f'' is universally closed (i.e., <math>X \\times_S T \\to T</math> is a [[closed map]] for any continuous map <math>T \\to S</math>), then\nthe base change map\n\n:<math>g^* R^r f_* \\mathcal F \\to R^r f'_* g'^* \\mathcal F</math>\n\nis an isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Theorem 17.3}}</ref> Indeed, we have: for <math>s \\in S</math>,\n\n:<math>(R^r f_* \\mathcal{F})_s = \\varinjlim H^r(U, \\mathcal{F}) = H^r(X_s, \\mathcal{F}), \\quad X_s = f^{-1}(s)</math>\n\nand so for <math>s = g(t)</math>\n\n:<math>g^* (R^r f_* \\mathcal{F})_t = H^r(X_s, \\mathcal{F}) = H^r(X'_t, g'^* \\mathcal{F}) = R^r f'_* (g'^* \\mathcal{F})_t.</math>\n\nTo encode all individual higher derived functors of <math>f_*</math> into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map\n\n:<math>g^* Rf_* \\mathcal F \\to Rf'_* g'^* \\mathcal F</math>\n\nis a [[quasi-isomorphism]].\n\nThe assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by {{harvtxt|Schnürer|Soergel|2016}}.\n\n{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009}} has extended the above theorem to [[non-abelian cohomology|non-abelian sheaf cohomology]], i.e., sheaves taking values in [[simplicial set]]s (as opposed to abelian groups).<ref>{{harvtxt|Lurie|2009|loc=Theorem 7.3.1.16}}</ref>\n\n===Direct image with compact support===\nIf the map ''f'' is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) :\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\emptyset & \\stackrel {g'} \\to & \\mathbb C \\setminus \\{0\\} \\\\\nf' \\downarrow & & \\downarrow f \\\\\n\\{0\\} & \\stackrel g \\to & \\mathbb C\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nOne the one hand <math>f'_* g'^* \\mathcal F</math> is always zero, but if <math>\\mathcal F</math> is a [[local system]] on <math>\\mathbb C \\setminus \\{0\\}</math> corresponding to a [[Group representation|representation]] of the [[fundamental group]] <math>\\pi_1(X)</math> (which is isomorphic to '''Z'''), then <math>g^* f_* \\mathcal F</math> can be computed as the [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s of the [[monodromy]] action of <math>\\pi_1(X, x)</math> on the [[stalk (sheaf)|stalk]] <math>\\mathcal F_x</math> (for any <math>x \\ne 0</math>), which need not vanish.\n\nTo obtain a base-change result, the functor <math>f_*</math> (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the [[direct image with compact support]] <math>Rf_!</math>. For example, if <math>f: X \\to S</math> is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example, <math>Rf_! \\mathcal F</math> is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by\n\n:<math>(Rf_! \\mathcal F)_s = \\begin{cases} \\mathcal F_s & s \\in X, \\\\ 0 & s \\notin X. \\end{cases} </math>\n\nIn general, there is a map <math>Rf_! \\mathcal F \\to Rf_* \\mathcal F</math>, which is a quasi-isomorphism if ''f'' is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism<ref>{{harvtxt|Iversen|1986}}, the four spaces are assumed to be [[locally compact]] and of finite dimension.</ref>\n\n:<math>g^* Rf_! \\mathcal F \\to Rf'_! g'^* \\mathcal F.</math>\n\n==Base change for quasi-coherent sheaves==\n\n===Proper base change===\n''Proper base change theorems'' for [[quasi-coherent sheaf|quasi-coherent sheaves]] apply in the following situation: <math>f: X \\to S</math> is a [[proper morphism]] between [[noetherian scheme]]s, and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> is a [[coherent sheaf]] which is [[flat morphism|flat]] over ''S'' (i.e., <math>\\mathcal F_x</math> is [[flat module|flat]] over <math>\\mathcal O_{S, f(x)}</math>).

However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the [[Grothendieck spectral sequence]].\n\n===Base change in derived algebraic geometry===\n[[Derived algebraic geometry]] provides a means to drop the flatness assumption, provided that the pullback <math>X'</math> is replaced by the [[homotopy pullback]]. In the easiest case when ''X'', ''S'', and <math>S'</math> are affine (with the notation as above), the homotopy pullback is given by the [[derived functor|derived]] tensor product\n:<math>X' = \\operatorname{Spec} (B' \\otimes^L_B A)</math>\nThen, assuming that the schemes (or, more generally, derived schemes) involved are quasi-compact and quasi-separated, the natural transformation\n:<math>L g^* R f_* \\mathcal{F} \\to Rf'_* Lg'^* \\mathcal{F}</math>\nis a [[quasi-isomorphism]] for any quasi-coherent sheaf, or more generally a [[chain complex|complex]] of quasi-coherent sheaves.<ref>{{harvtxt|Toën|2012|loc=Proposition 1.4}}</ref>\nThe afore-mentioned flat base change result is in fact a special case since for ''g'' flat the homotopy pullback (which is locally given by a derived tensor product) agrees with the ordinary pullback (locally given by the underived tensor product), and since the pullback along the flat maps ''g'' and ''g' ''are automatically derived (i.e., <math>Lg^* = g^*</math>). The auxiliary assumptions related to the Tor-independence or Tor-amplitude in the preceding base change theorem also become unnecessary.\n\nIn the above form, base change has been extended by {{harvtxt|Ben-Zvi|Francis|Nadler|2010}} to the situation where ''X'', ''S'', and ''S' ''are (possibly derived) [[stack (mathematics)|stack]]s, provided that the map ''f'' is a perfect map (which includes the case that ''f'' is a quasi-compact, quasi-separated map of schemes, but also includes more general stacks, such as the [[classifying stack]] ''BG'' of an [[algebraic group]] in characteristic zero).\n\n===Variants and applications===\nProper base change also holds in the context of [[complex manifolds]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Grauert|1960}}</ref>\nThe [[theorem on formal functions]] is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a [[completion (metric space)|completion]] operation.\n\nThe [[see-saw principle]] and the [[theorem of the cube]], which are foundational facts in the theory of [[abelian varieties]], are a consequence of proper base change.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mumford|2008}}</ref>\n\nA base-change also holds for [[D-modules]]: if ''X'', ''S'', ''X','' and ''S' ''are smooth varieties (but ''f'' and ''g'' need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism\n:<math>g^\\dagger \\int_f \\mathcal F \\to \\int_{f'} g'^\\dagger \\mathcal F,</math>\nwhere <math>-^\\dagger</math> and <math>\\int</math> denote the inverse and direct image functors for ''D''-modules.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hotta|Takeuchi|Tanisaki|2008|loc=Theorem 1.7.3}}</ref>\n\n==Base change for étale sheaves==\nFor [[étale sheaf|étale torsion sheaves]] <math>\\mathcal F</math>, there are two base change results referred to as ''proper'' and ''smooth base change'', respectively: base change holds if <math>f: X \\rightarrow S</math> is [[proper morphism|proper]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XII}}, {{harvtxt|Milne|1980|loc=section VI.2}}</ref> It also holds if ''g'' is [[smooth morphism|smooth]], provided that ''f'' is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of <math>\\mathcal F</math> is prime to the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the [[residue field]]s of ''X''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Artin|Grothendieck|Verdier|1972|loc=Exposé XVI}}</ref>\n\nClosely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let ''X'' be a variety over a [[separably closed field]] and <math>\\mathcal{F}</math> a [[constructible sheaf]] on <math>X_\\text{et}</math>. Then <math>H^r(X, \\mathcal{F})</math> are finite in each of the following cases:\n*''X'' is complete, or \n*<math>\\mathcal{F}</math> has no ''p''-torsion, where ''p'' is the characteristic of ''k''.\n\nUnder additional assumptions, {{harvtxt|Deninger|1988}} extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.\n\n===Applications===\nIn close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an [[open immersion]] ''f'', \n:<math>g^* f_* \\mathcal F \\to f'_* g'^* \\mathcal F</math>\nis not usually an isomorphism.<ref>{{harvtxt|Milne|2012|loc=Example 8.5}}</ref> Instead the [[extension by zero]] functor <math>f_!</math> satisfies an isomorphism\n:<math>g^* f_! \\mathcal F \\to f'_! g^* \\mathcal F.</math>\nThis fact and the proper base change suggest to define the ''direct image functor with compact support'' for a map ''f'' by\n:<math>Rf_! := Rp_* j_!</math>\nwhere <math>f = p \\circ j</math> is a ''compactification'' of ''f'', i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map.\nThe proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification.\nMoreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for <math>g_*</math> vs. <math>Rf_!</math> does hold for non-proper maps ''f''.\n\nFor the structural map <math>f: X \\to S = \\operatorname{Spec} k</math> of a scheme over a field ''k'', the individual cohomologies of <math>Rf_!

(The series may diverge in general.) The formula states: for a smooth algebraic stack ''X'' of finite type over a finite field <math>\\mathbf{F}_q</math> and the [[arithmetic Frobenius|\"arithmetic\" Frobenius]] <math>\\phi^{-1}: X \\to X</math>, i.e., the inverse of the usual geometric Frobenius <math>\\phi</math> in Grothendieck's formula,<ref>To define Frobenius <math>\\phi</math> on a stack ''X'', let <math>\\phi: \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q} \\to \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q}, x \\mapsto x^q</math>. Then we have <math>id \\times \\phi: X \\times_{\\mathbf{F}_q} \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q} \\to X \\times_{\\mathbf{F}_q} \\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q}</math>, which is the Frobenius on ''X'', also denoted by <math>\\phi</math>.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Behrend|2003|loc=Corollary 6.4.10}}</ref>\n:<math>\\# X (\\mathbf{F}_q) = q^{\\operatorname{dim}X} \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} (-1)^i \\operatorname{tr}(\\phi^{-1}; H^i(X, \\mathbb{Q}_l)).</math>\n\nHere, it is crucial that the [[cohomology of a stack]] is with respect to the [[smooth topology]] (not etale).\n\nWhen ''X'' is a variety, the smooth cohomology is the same as etale one and, via the [[Poincaré duality]], this is equivalent to Grothendieck's trace formula. (But the proof of Behrend's trace formula relies on Grothendieck's formula, so this does not subsume Grothendieck's.)\n\n== Simple example ==\nConsider <math>B \\mathbb{G}_m = [\\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbf{F}_q/\\mathbb{G}_m]</math>, the [[classifying stack]] of the multiplicative group scheme (that is, <math>\\mathbb{G}_m(R) = R^\\times</math>). By definition, <math>B \\mathbb G_m(\\mathbf{F}_q)</math> is the category of [[torsor|principal]] <math>\\mathbb{G}_m</math>-bundles over <math>\\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbf{F}_q</math>, which has only one isomorphism class (since all such bundles are trivial by [[Lang's theorem]]). Its group of automorphisms is <math>\\mathbb{G}_m</math>, which means that the number of <math>\\mathbf{F}_q</math>-isomorphisms is <math>\\#\\mathbb{G}_m(\\mathbf{F}_q) = \\#\\mathbf{F}_q^\\times = q-1</math>.\n\nOn the other hand, we may compute the ''l''-adic cohomology of <math>B\\mathbb{G}_m </math> directly. We remark that in the topological setting, we have <math>B\\mathbb{C}^\\times \\cong \\mathbb{CP}^\\infty</math> (where <math>B\\mathbb C^\\times</math> now denotes the usual classifying space of a topological group), whose rational cohomology ring is a polynomial ring in one generator ([[Borel's theorem]]), but we shall not use this directly. If we wish to stay in the world of algebraic geometry, we may instead \"approximate\" <math>B\\mathbb{G}_m </math> by projective spaces of larger and larger dimension. Thus  we consider the map <math>B\\mathbb{G}_m \\to \\mathbb{P}^N</math> induced by the <math>\\mathbb{G}_m</math>-bundle corresponding to <math>\\mathcal O(1)</math>. This map induces an isomorphism in cohomology in degrees up to ''2N''. Thus the even (resp. odd) Betti numbers of <math>B \\mathbb{G}_m</math> are 1 (resp. 0), and the ''l''-adic Galois representation on the ''(2n)''th cohomology group is the ''n''th power of the cyclotomic character. The second part is a consequence of the fact that the cohomology of <math>\\mathbb P^N </math> is generated by algebraic cycle classes. This shows that\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\ge 0} (-1)^i \\operatorname{tr}(\\phi^{-1}; H^i(B\\mathbb G_m, \\mathbb{Q}_l)) =  1 + 1 / q + 1/q^2 + \\cdots = {q \\over {q-1}}.</math>\nNote that <math>\\dim B \\mathbb{G}_m = \\dim \\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbf{F}_q - \\dim \\mathbb{G}_m = -1</math>. Multiplying by <math>q^{-1}</math>, one obtains the predicted equality.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite journal |last=Shenghao |first=Sun |arxiv=1008.3689 |title=L-series of Artin stacks over finite fields |year=2011 |version= |doi=10.2140/ant.2012.6.47 |volume=6 |journal=Algebra & Number Theory |pages=47–122}}\n\n[[Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry]]"

      "text": "{{short description|Number of intersection points of two algebraic curves in terms of their degrees}}\n{{About|Bézout's theorem in algebraic geometry|Bézout's theorem in arithmetic|Bézout's identity}}\n{{distinguish|Little Bézout's theorem}}\n'''Bézout's theorem''' is a statement in [[algebraic geometry]] concerning the number of common points, or intersection points, of two plane [[algebraic curve]]s which do not share a common component (that is, which do not have infinitely many common points). The theorem states that the number of common points of two such curves is at most equal to the product of their [[degree of a polynomial|degree]]s, and equality holds if one counts [[points at infinity]] and points with complex coordinates (or more generally, coordinates from the [[algebraic closure]] of the ground field), and if each point is counted with its [[intersection number|intersection multiplicity]]. It is named after [[Étienne Bézout]].\n\n'''Bézout's theorem''' refers also to the generalization to higher dimensions: Let there be ''n'' [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in {{math|''n''+1}} variables, of degrees <math>d_1, \\ldots, d_n</math>, that define ''n'' [[hypersurface]]s in the [[projective space]] of dimension ''n''. If the number of intersection points of the hypersurfaces is finite over an algebraic closure of the ground field, then this number is <math>d_1 \\cdots d_n,</math> if the points are counted with their multiplicity.\nAs in the case of two variables, in the case of affine hypersurfaces, and when not counting multiplicities nor non-real points, this theorem provides only an upper bound of the number of points, which is often reached. This is often referred to as '''Bézout's bound'''.\n\nBézout's theorem is fundamental in [[computer algebra]] and effective [[algebraic geometry]], by showing that most problems have a [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] that is at least exponential in the number of variables. It follows that in these areas, the best complexity that may be hoped for will occur in algorithms that have a complexity which is polynomial in Bézout's bound.\n\n==Rigorous statement==\nSuppose that ''X'' and ''Y'' are two plane [[projective plane|projective]] curves defined over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' that do not have a common component (this condition means that  ''X'' and ''Y'' are defined by polynomials, whose [[polynomial greatest common divisor]] is a constant; in particular, it holds for a pair of \"generic\" curves). Then the total number of intersection points of ''X'' and ''Y'' with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]] ''E'' which contains ''F'', counted with their [[intersection number|multiplicities]], is equal to the product of the degrees of ''X'' and ''Y''.\n\nThe generalization in higher dimension may be stated as:\n\nLet ''n'' [[projective variety|projective hypersurface]]s be given in a [[projective space]] of dimension ''n'' over an algebraic closed field, which are defined by ''n'' [[homogeneous polynomial]]s in ''n'' + 1 variables, of degrees <math>d_1, \\ldots,d_n.</math> Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product <math>d_1 \\cdots d_n.</math> If the hypersurfaces are irreducible and in relative [[general position]], then there are <math>d_1 \\cdots d_n</math> intersection points, all with multiplicity 1.\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem. In particular, it may be deduced by applying iteratively the following generalization: if ''V'' is a [[projective algebraic set]] of dimension <math>\\delta</math> and [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] <math>d_1</math>, and ''H'' is a hypersurface (defined by a polynomial) of degree <math>d_2</math>, that does not contain any [[irreducible component]] of ''V'', then the intersection of ''V'' and ''H'' has dimension <math>\\delta-1</math> and degree <math>d_1d_2.</math> For a (sketched) proof using the [[Hilbert series]] see [[Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial#Degree of a projective variety and Bézout's theorem]].\n\nBézout's theorem has been further generalized as the so-called [[multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem]].\n\n==History==\nBezout's theorem was essentially stated by [[Isaac Newton]] in his proof of [[Newton's theorem about ovals|lemma 28]] of volume 1 of his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' in 1687, where he claims that two curves have a number of intersection points given by the product of their degrees.   The theorem was later published in 1779 in [[Étienne Bézout]]'s ''Théorie générale des équations algébriques''. Bézout, who did not have at his disposal modern algebraic notation for equations in several variables, gave a proof based on manipulations with cumbersome algebraic expressions. From the modern point of view, Bézout's treatment was rather heuristic, since he did not formulate the precise conditions for the theorem to hold. This led to a sentiment, expressed by certain authors, that his proof was neither correct nor the first proof to be given.<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Frances Kirwan | last=Kirwan | first=Frances | title=Complex Algebraic Curves | publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=United Kingdom | year=1992 | isbn=0-521-42353-8}}</ref>\n\n==Intersection multiplicity==\n{{further|Intersection number}}\nThe most delicate part of Bézout's theorem and its generalization to the case of ''k'' algebraic hypersurfaces in ''k''-dimensional [[projective space]] is the procedure of assigning the proper intersection multiplicities. If ''P'' is a common point of two plane algebraic curves ''X'' and ''Y'' that is a non-singular point of both of them and, moreover, the [[tangent line]]s to ''X'' and ''Y'' at ''P'' are distinct then the intersection multiplicity is one. This corresponds to the case of \"transversal intersection\". If the curves ''X'' and ''Y'' have a common tangent at ''P'' then the multiplicity is at least two. See [[intersection number]] for the definition in general.\n\n==Examples==\n*Two distinct non-parallel lines (in the same plane) always meet in exactly one point. Two parallel lines intersect at a unique point that lies at infinity. To see how this works algebraically, in projective space, the lines <math>x+2y=3</math> and <math>x+2y=5</math> are represented by the homogeneous equations <math>x+2y-3z=0</math> and <math>x+2y-5z=0</math>.  Solving, we get <math>x= -2y</math> and <math>z=0</math>, corresponding to the point (-2:1:0) in homogeneous coordinates.  As the ''z''-coordinate is 0, this point lies on the line at infinity.\n*The special case where one of the curves is a line can be derived from the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. In this case the theorem states that an algebraic curve of degree ''n'' intersects a given line in ''n'' points, counting the multiplicities. For example, the parabola defined by   <math>y - x^2 = 0</math>  has degree 2; the line <math>y-ax=0</math> has degree 1, and they meet in exactly two points when ''a'' ≠ 0 and touch at the origin (intersect with multiplicity two) when ''a'' = 0.\n* Two [[conic section]]s generally intersect in four points, some of which may coincide. To properly account for all intersection points, it may be necessary to allow complex coordinates and include the points on the infinite line in the projective plane. For example:\n\n:*Two circles never intersect in more than two points in the plane, while Bézout's theorem predicts four.  The discrepancy comes from the fact that every circle passes through the same two complex points on the line at infinity. Writing the circle\n:::<math>(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 = r^2</math>\n::in [[homogeneous coordinates]], we get\n:::<math>(x-az)^2+(y-bz)^2 - r^2z^2 = 0,</math>\n::from which it is clear that the two points (1:''i'':0) and (1:-''i'':0) lie on every circle.  When two circles don't meet at all in the real plane, the two other intersections have non-zero imaginary parts, or if they are concentric then they meet at exactly the two points on the line at infinity with an intersection multiplicity of two.\n:*Any conic should meet the line at infinity at two points according to the theorem.

The original form states:\n\n:Assume that two cubics {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} in the projective plane meet in nine (different) points, as they do in general over an [[algebraically closed field]]. Then every cubic that passes through any eight of the points also passes through the ninth point.\n\nA more intrinsic form of the Cayley–Bacharach theorem reads as follows:\n\n:Every cubic curve {{math|''C''<sub>1</sub>}} on an [[algebraically closed field]] that passes through a given set of eight points {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} also passes through a certain (fixed) ninth point {{math|''P''<sub>9</sub>}}, counting multiplicities.\n\nA related result on conics was first proved by the French geometer [[Michel Chasles]] and later generalized to cubics by [[Arthur Cayley]] and {{harvs|txt|last=Isaak Bacharach|authorlink=Isaak Bacharach|year=1886}}.\n\n== Details ==\nIf seven of the points {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} lie on a [[conic]], then the ninth point can be chosen on that conic, since {{mvar|C}} will always contain the whole conic on account of [[Bézout's theorem]]. In other cases, we have the following.\n\n:If no seven points out of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} are co-conic, then the [[vector space]] of cubic homogeneous polynomials that vanish on (the [[affine cone]]s of) {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} (with multiplicity for double points) has [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] two.\n\nIn that case, every cubic through {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} also passes through the intersection of any two different cubics through {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}}, which has at least nine points (over the [[algebraic closure]]) on account of [[Bézout's theorem]]. These points cannot be covered by {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} only, which gives us {{math|''P''<sub>9</sub>}}.\n\nSince degenerate conics are a union of at most two lines, there are always four out of seven points on a degenerate conic that are collinear. Consequently:\n\n:If no seven points out of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} lie on a non-degenerate conic, and no four points out of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} lie on a line, then the [[vector space]] of cubic [[homogeneous polynomial]]s that vanish on (the affine cones of) {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} has [[dimension (vector space)|dimension]] two.\n\nOn the other hand, assume {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ''P''<sub>2</sub>, ''P''<sub>3</sub>, ''P''<sub>4</sub>}} are collinear and no seven points out of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} are co-conic. Then no five points of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} and no three points of {{math|''P''<sub>5</sub>, ''P''<sub>6</sub>, ''P''<sub>7</sub>, ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} are collinear. Since {{mvar|C}} will always contain the whole line through {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ''P''<sub>2</sub>, ''P''<sub>3</sub>, ''P''<sub>4</sub>}} on account of [[Bézout's theorem]], the vector space of cubic homogeneous polynomials that vanish on (the affine cones of) {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''P''<sub>8</sub>}} is isomorphic to the vector space of [[quadratic form|quadratic homogeneous polynomials]] that vanish (the affine cones of) {{math|''P''<sub>5</sub>, ''P''<sub>6</sub>, ''P''<sub>7</sub>, ''P''<sub>8</sub>}}, which has dimension two.\n\nAlthough the sets of conditions for both ''dimension two'' results are different, they are both strictly ''weaker'' than full general positions: three points are allowed to be collinear, and six points are allowed to lie on a conic (in general two points determine a line and [[five points determine a conic]]). For the Cayley&ndash;Bacharach theorem, it is necessary to have a family of cubics passing through the nine points, rather than a single one.\n\nAccording to [[Bézout's theorem]], two different cubic curves over an [[algebraically closed field]] which have no common irreducible component meet in exactly nine points (counted with multiplicity). The Cayley&ndash;Bacharach theorem thus asserts that the last point of intersection of any two members in the family of curves does not move if eight intersection points (without seven co-conic ones) are already prescribed.\n\n== Applications ==\nA special case is [[Pascal's theorem]], in which case the two cubics in question are all degenerate: given six points on a conic (a hexagon), consider the lines obtained by extending opposite sides – this yields two cubics of three lines each, which intersect in 9 points – the 6 points on the conic, and 3 others. These 3 additional points lie on a line, as the conic plus the line through any two of the points is a cubic passing through 8 of the points.\n\nA second application is [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]], similar to the above, but the six points are on two lines instead of on a conic.\n\nFinally, a third case is found on the associativity of the group of [[Elliptic curve#Associativity|elliptic curves]]. Let a first cubic contain the three lines BC, O(A+B) and A(B+C); and a second cubic containing the three lines AB, O(B+C) and C(A+B). The following eight points are common to both cubics: A, B, C, A+B, -A-B, B+C, -B-C, O. Hence their ninth points must be the same -A-(B+C)=-(A+B)-C, giving the associativity.\n\n== Dimension counting ==\nOne can understand the Cayley–Bacharach theorem, and why it arises for degree 3, by [[dimension counting]]. Simply stated, nine points determine a cubic, but in general define a ''unique'' cubic. Thus if the nine points lie on more than one cubic, equivalently on the intersection of two cubics (as {{math|3 × 3 {{=}} 9}}), they are not in [[general position]] – they are [[overdetermined system|overdetermined]] by one dimension – and thus cubics passing through them satisfying one additional constraint, as reflected in the \"eight implies nine\" property. The general phenomenon is called '''''superabundance'''''; see [[Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces]].\n\n=== Details ===\nFormally, first recall that given two curves of degree {{mvar|d}}, they define a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]] (one-parameter [[linear system]]) of degree {{mvar|d}} curves by taking projective linear combinations of the defining equations; this corresponds to two points determining a projective line in the [[parameter space]] of curves, which is simply projective space.\n\nThe Cayley–Bacharach theorem arises for high degree because the number of intersection points of two curves of degree {{mvar|d}}, namely {{math|''d''<sup>&thinsp;2</sup>}} (by [[Bézout's theorem]]), grows faster than the number of points needed to define a curve of degree {{mvar|d}}, which is given by\n\n:<math>\\frac{(d+1)(d+2)}{2} - 1 = \\frac{d^2 + 3d}{2}.</math>\n\nThese first agree for {{math|''d'' {{=}} 3}}, which is why the Cayley–Bacharach theorem occurs for cubics, and for higher degree {{math|''d''<sup>&thinsp;2</sup>}} is greater, hence the higher degree generalizations.\n\nIn detail, the number of points required to determine a curve of degree {{mvar|d}} is the number of [[monomial]]s of degree {{mvar|d}}, minus 1 from projectivization. For the first few {{mvar|d}} these yield:\n* {{math|''d'' {{=}} 1:}} 2 and 1: two points determine a line, two lines intersect in a point,\n* {{math|''d'' {{=}} 2:}} 5 and 4: [[five points determine a conic]], two conics intersect in four points,\n* {{math|''d'' {{=}} 3:}} 9 and 9: nine points determine a cubic, two cubics intersect in nine points,\n* {{math|''d'' {{=}} 4:}} 14 and 16.\nThus these first agree for 3, and the number of intersections is larger when {{math|''d'' > 3}}.\n\nThe meaning of this is that the 9 points of intersection of two cubics are in special position with respect to cubics, a fortiori for higher degree, but ''unlike'' for lower degree: two lines intersect in a point, which is trivially in general linear position, and two quadratics intersect in four points, which (assuming the quadratics are irreducible so no three points are collinear) are in general quadratic position because five points determine a quadratic, and any four points (in general linear position) have a pencil of quadratics through them, since the system is underdetermined. For cubics, nine points determine a cubic, but in general they determine a ''unique'' cubic – thus having two different cubics pass through them (and thus a pencil) is special – the solution space is one dimension higher than expected, and thus the solutions satisfy an additional constraint, namely the \"8 implies 9\" property.\n\nMore concretely, because the [[vector space]] of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s {{math|''P''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} of degree three in three variables {{math|''x'', ''y'', ''z''}} has dimension {{math|10}}, the system of cubic curves passing through eight (different) points is parametrized by a vector space of dimension {{math|≥ 2}} (the vanishing of the polynomial at one point imposes a single linear condition). It can be shown that the dimension is ''exactly'' two if no four of the points are collinear and no seven points lie on a conic.

      "text": "{{distinguish|text=[[Chow's theorem (disambiguation)|Chow's theorem]]}}\n'''Chow's lemma''', named after [[Wei-Liang Chow]], is one of the foundational results in [[algebraic geometry]]. It roughly says that a [[proper morphism]] is fairly close to being a [[projective morphism]]. More precisely, a version of it states the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|loc=Ch II. Exercise 4.10}}</ref>\n\n:If <math>X</math> is a scheme that is proper over a [[Noetherian scheme|noetherian]] base <math>S</math>, then there exists a [[projective variety|projective]] <math>S</math>-scheme <math>X'</math> and a surjective <math>S</math>-morphism <math>f: X' \\to X</math> that induces an isomorphism <math>f^{-1}(U) \\simeq U</math> for some dense open <math>U\\subseteq X.</math>\n\n== Proof ==\nThe proof here is a standard one (cf. {{harvnb|EGA II|loc=5.6.1}}).\n\nIt is easy to reduce to the case when <math>X</math> is irreducible, as follows. <math>X</math> is noetherian since it is of finite type over a noetherian base. Then it's also topologically noetherian, and consists of a finite number of irreducible components <math> X_i </math>, which are each proper over <math>S</math> (because they're closed immersions in the scheme <math>X</math> which is proper over <math>S</math>). If, within each of these irreducible components, there exists a dense open <math>U_i \\subset X_i</math>, then we can take \n\n:<math>U := \\bigsqcup \\left (U_i \\setminus \\bigcup\\nolimits_{i \\neq j} X_j \\right).</math>\n\nIt is not hard to see that each of the disjoint pieces are dense in their respective <math>X_i</math>, so the full set <math>U</math> is dense in <math>X</math>. In addition, it's clear that we can similarly find a morphism <math>g</math> which satisfies the density condition. \n\nHaving reduced the problem, we now assume <math>X</math> is irreducible. We recall that it must also be noetherian. Thus, we can find a finite open affine cover \n\n:<math>X = \\bigcup_{i=1}^n U_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>U_i</math> are quasi-projective over <math>S.</math> There are open immersions over <math>S, \\phi_i: U_i \\to P_i</math> into some projective <math>S</math>-schemes <math>P_i.</math> Set <math>U = \\cap U_i.</math> Then <math>U</math> is nonempty since <math>X</math> is irreducible. Let\n\n:<math>\\phi: U \\to P = P_1 \\times_S \\cdots \\times_S P_n</math>\n\nbe given by <math>\\phi_i</math> restricted to <math>U</math> over <math>S</math>. Let\n\n:<math>\\psi : U \\to X \\times_S P.</math>\n\nbe given by <math>U \\hookrightarrow X</math> and <math>\\phi</math> over <math>S</math>. <math>\\psi</math> is then an immersion; thus, it factors as a closed immersion followed by an open immersion <math>X' \\to X \\times_S P</math>. Let <math>f : X' \\to X</math> be the immersion followed by the projection. We claim <math>f</math> induces <math>f^{-1}(U) \\simeq U</math>; for that, it is enough to show <math>f^{-1}(U) = \\psi(U)</math>. But this means that <math>\\psi(U)</math> is closed in <math>U \\times_S P.</math> <math>\\psi</math> factorizes as \n\n:<math>U \\overset{\\Gamma_\\phi} \\longrightarrow U \\times_S P \\to X \\times_S P.</math>\n\n<math>P</math> is separated over <math>S</math> and so the graph morphism <math>\\Gamma_\\phi</math> is a closed immersion. This proves our contention.\n\nIt remains to show <math>X'</math> is projective over <math>S</math>. Let <math>g: X' \\to P</math> be the closed immersion followed by the projection. Showing that <math>g</math> is a [[closed immersion]] shows <math>X'</math> is projective over <math>S</math>. This can be checked locally. Identifying <math>U_i</math> with its image in <math>P_i</math> we suppress <math>\\phi_i</math> from our notation.\n\nLet <math>V_i = p_i^{-1}(U_i)</math> where <math>p_i : P \\to P_i</math>. We claim <math>g^{-1}(V_i)</math> are an open cover of <math>X'</math>. This would follow from <math>f^{-1}(U_i) \\subset g^{-1}(V_i)</math> as sets. This in turn follows from <math>f = p_i \\circ g</math> on <math>U_i</math> as functions on the underlying topological space. Thus it is enough to show that for each <math>i</math> the map <math>g: g^{-1}(V_i) \\to V_i</math>, denoted by <math>h</math>, is a closed immersion (since the property of being a closed immersion is local on the base).\n\nFix <math>i.</math> and let <math>Z</math> be the graph of \n\n:<math>u: V_i \\overset{p_i} \\longrightarrow U_i \\hookrightarrow X.</math>\n\nIt is a closed subscheme of <math>X \\times_S V_i</math> since <math>X</math> is separated over <math>S</math>. Let \n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nq_1 : X \\times_S P \\to X \\\\ \nq_2 : X \\times_S P \\to P\n\\end{align}</math> \n\nbe the projections. We claim that <math>h</math> factors through <math>Z</math>, which would imply <math>h</math> is a closed immersion. But for <math>w: U' \\to V_i</math> we have:\n\n:<math>v = \\Gamma_u \\circ w \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad q_1 \\circ v = u \\circ q_2 \\circ v \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad q_1 \\circ \\psi = u \\circ q_2 \\circ \\psi \\quad\\Longleftrightarrow\\quad q_1 \\circ \\psi = u \\circ \\phi.</math>\n\nThe last equality holds and thus there is <math>w</math> that satisfies the first equality. This proves our claim.<math>\\square</math>\n\n== Additional statements ==\nIn the statement of Chow's lemma, if <math>X</math> is reduced, irreducible, or integral, we can assume that the same holds for <math>X'</math>. If both <math>X</math> and <math>X'</math> are irreducible, then <math>f: X' \\to X</math> is a [[Birational geometry|birational]] morphism.

Functions in this sense have a divisor of zeros and poles, counted with [[Multiplicity (mathematics)|multiplicity]]; a divisor ''D'' is here of interest as a set of constraints on functions, insisting that poles at given points are ''only as bad'' as the positive coefficients in ''D'' indicate, and that zeros at points in ''D'' with a negative coefficient have ''at least'' that multiplicity. The dimension of the vector space\n\n:<math>L(D)</math>\n\nof such functions is finite, and denoted <math>\\ell(D)</math>. Conventionally the [[linear system of divisors]] attached to ''D'' is then attributed dimension <math>r(D) = \\ell(D)-1</math>, which is the dimension of the [[projective space]] parametrizing it.\n\nThe other significant invariant of ''D'' is its degree, ''d'', which is the sum of all its coefficients.\n\nA divisor is called ''[[special divisor|special]]'' if ''ℓ''(''K''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''D'') &gt; 0, where ''K'' is the [[canonical divisor]].<ref>Hartshorne p.296</ref>\n\nIn this notation, '''Clifford's theorem''' is the statement that for an effective [[special divisor]] ''D'',\n\n:<math>\\ell(D)- 1 \\le d/2</math>,\n\ntogether with the information that the case of equality here is only for ''D'' zero or canonical, or ''C'' a [[hyperelliptic curve]] and ''D'' linearly equivalent to an integral multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor.\n\nThe '''Clifford index''' of ''C'' is then defined as the minimum value of the ''d'' &minus; 2''r''(''D''), taken over all special divisors (that are not canonical or trivial).  Clifford's theorem is then the statement that this is non-negative. The Clifford index for a ''generic'' curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' is the [[floor function]] of\n\n:<math>\\frac{g-1}{2}.</math>\n\nThe Clifford index measures how far the curve is from being hyperelliptic.  It may be thought of as a refinement of the [[gonality]]: in many cases the Clifford index is equal to the gonality minus 2.<ref name=Eis178>Eisenbud (2005) p.178</ref>\n\n==Green's Conjecture==\n\nA conjecture of [[Mark Lee Green|Mark Green]] states that the Clifford index for a curve over the complex numbers that is not hyperelliptic should be determined by the extent to which ''C'' as [[canonical curve]] has linear syzygies. In detail, the invariant ''a''(''C'') is determined by the minimal [[free resolution]] of the [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] of ''C'' in its canonical embedding, as the largest index ''i'' for which the [[graded Betti number]] β<sub>''i'', ''i'' + 2</sub> is zero. Green and [[Robert Lazarsfeld]] showed that ''a''(''C'') + 1 is a lower bound for the Clifford index, and '''Green's conjecture''' is that equality always holds.

      "text": "In mathematics, the '''ELSV formula''', named after its four authors [[Torsten Ekedahl]], [[Sergei Lando]], [[Michael Shapiro (mathematician)|Michael Shapiro]], [[Alek Vainshtein]], is an equality between a [[Hurwitz number]] (counting [[ramified covering]]s of the sphere) and an integral over the [[moduli of algebraic curves|moduli space of stable curves]].\n\nSeveral fundamental results in the [[intersection theory]] of moduli spaces of curves can be deduced from the ELSV formula, including the [[Witten conjecture]], the [[Virasoro conjecture|Virasoro constraints]], and the [[Lambda g conjecture|<math>\\lambda_g</math>-conjecture]].\n\nIt is generalized by the [[Gopakumar–Mariño–Vafa formula]].\n\n== The formula ==\nDefine the ''Hurwitz number''\n\n:<math> h_{g; k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math>\n\nas the number of ramified coverings of the complex projective line ([[Riemann sphere]], <math>\\mathbb{P}^1(\\C))</math> that are connected curves of genus ''g'', with ''n'' numbered preimages of the [[point at infinity]] having multiplicities <math>k_1, \\dots, k_n</math> and ''m'' more simple [[branch point]]s. Here if a covering has a nontrivial automorphism group ''G'' it should be counted with weight <math>1/|G|</math>.\n\nThe ELSV formula then reads\n\n: <math>h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} = \\dfrac{m!}{\\#\\text{Aut}(k_1 , \\ldots , k_n)} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{k_i^{k_i}}{k_i!} \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}} \\frac{c(E^*)}{(1-k_1\\psi_1) \\cdots (1-k_n \\psi_n)}.</math>\n\nHere the notation is as follows:\n\n* <math>g\\ge 0</math> is a nonnegative integer;\n* <math>n\\ge 1</math> is a positive integer;\n* <math>k_1, \\dots, k_n</math> are positive integers;\n* <math>\\#\\operatorname{Aut}(k_1 , \\ldots , k_n)</math> is the number of automorphisms of the ''n''-tuple <math>(k_1 , \\ldots , k_n);</math>\n* <math> m = \\sum k_i + n + 2g-2; </math>\n* <math> \\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} </math> is the [[moduli space]] of [[stable curve]]s of genus ''g''  with ''n'' marked points;\n* ''E'' is the [[Hodge vector bundle]] and ''c(E*)'' the total [[Chern class]] of its dual vector bundle;\n* ''ψ''<sub>''i''</sub> is the first Chern class of the cotangent line bundle to the ''i''-th marked point.\n\nThe numbers\n\n:<math> h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math>\n\nin the left-hand side have a combinatorial definition and satisfy properties that can be proved combinatorially. Each of these properties translates into a statement on the  integrals on the right-hand side of the ELSV formula {{Harv|Kazarian|2009}}.\n\n== The Hurwitz numbers ==\nThe Hurwitz numbers\n\n:<math> h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math>\n\nalso have a definition in purely algebraic terms. With ''K'' = ''k''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''k''<sub>''n''</sub> and ''m'' = ''K'' + ''n'' + 2''g'' − 2, let τ<sub>1</sub>, ..., τ<sub>''m''</sub> be transpositions in the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''K''</sub> and σ a permutation with ''n'' numbered cycles of lengths ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub>. Then\n\n:<math> ( \\tau_1 , \\dots, \\tau_m, \\sigma) </math>\n\nis a transitive factorization of identity of type (''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub>) if the product\n\n:<math> \\tau_1 \\cdots \\tau_m \\sigma </math>\n\nequals the identity permutation and the group generated by\n\n:<math>\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_m</math>\n\nis [[transitive group|transitive]].\n\n'''Definition.''' <math> h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math> is the number of transitive factorization of identity of type (''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub>) divided by ''K''<nowiki>!</nowiki>.\n\n'''Example A.''' The number <math> h_{g;k} </math> is 1/''k''<nowiki>!</nowiki> times the number of lists of transpositions <math>(\\tau_1, \\dots, \\tau_{k+2g-1})</math> whose product is a ''k''-cycle. In other words, <math>h_{g;k}</math> is 1/''k'' times the number of factorizations of a given ''k''-cycle into a product of ''k'' + 2''g'' − 1 transpositions.\n\nThe equivalence between the two definitions of Hurwitz numbers (counting ramified coverings of the sphere, or counting transitive factorizations) is established by describing a ramified covering by its [[monodromy]]. More precisely: choose a base point on the sphere, number its preimages from 1 to ''K'' (this introduces a factor of ''K''<nowiki>!</nowiki>, which explains the division by it), and consider the monodromies of the covering about the branch point. This leads to a transitive factorization.\n\n== The integral over the moduli space ==\n[[Moduli of algebraic curves|'''The moduli space''' <math>{\\overline {\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n}</math>]] is a smooth [[algebraic stack|Deligne–Mumford stack]] of (complex) dimension 3''g'' − 3 + ''n''. (Heuristically this behaves much like complex manifold, except that integrals of characteristic classes that are integers for manifolds are rational numbers for Deligne–Mumford stacks.)\n\n'''The [[Hodge bundle]]''' ''E'' is the rank ''g'' vector bundle over the moduli space <math>{\\overline {\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n}</math> whose fiber over a curve (''C'', ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) with ''n'' marked points is the space of [[abelian differential]]s on ''C''. Its Chern classes are denoted by\n\n:<math>\\lambda_j = c_j(E) \\in H^{2j}({\\overline {\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n},\\mathbf{Q}). </math>\n\nWe have\n\n:<math> c(E^*) = 1 - \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 - \\cdots+ (-1)^g \\lambda_g. </math>\n\n'''The ψ-classes.''' Introduce line bundles <math>\\mathcal{L}_1, \\ldots, \\mathcal{L}_n</math> over <math>{\\overline {\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n}</math>. The fiber of <math>\\mathcal{L}_i</math> over a curve (''C'', ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) is the cotangent line to ''C'' at ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>. The first Chern class of <math>\\mathcal{L}_i</math> is denoted by\n\n:<math>\\psi_i = c_1(\\mathcal{L}_i) \\in H^2({\\overline {\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n},\\mathbf{Q}).</math>\n\n'''The integrand.''' The fraction <math> 1/(1-k_i \\psi_i) </math> is interpreted as <math> 1 + k_i \\psi_i + k_i^2 \\psi_i^2 + \\cdots </math>, where the sum can be cut at degree 3''g'' − 3 + ''n'' (the dimension of the moduli space). Thus the integrand is a product of ''n'' + 1 factors. We expand this product, extract from it the part of degree 3''g'' − 3 + ''n'' and integrate it over the moduli space.\n\n'''The integral as a polynomial.''' It follows that the integral\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}} \\frac{c(E^*)}{(1-k_1\\psi_1) \\cdots (1-k_n \\psi_n)} </math>\n\nis a symmetric polynomial in variables ''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub>, whose monomials have degrees between 3''g'' − 3 + ''n'' and 2''g'' − 3 + ''n''. The coefficient of the monomial <math> k_1^{d_1} \\cdots k_n^{d_n} </math> equals\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}} (-1)^j \\lambda_j \\psi_1^{d_1} \\cdots \\psi_n^{d_n}, </math>\n\nwhere \n\n:<math>j = 3g-3-n - \\sum d_i.</math>\n\n'''Remark.''' The polynomiality of the numbers\n\n:<math> \\frac{h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n}}{m!} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{k_i!}{k_i^{k_i}}</math>\n\nwas first conjectured by I. P. Goulden and D. M. Jackson. No proof independent from the ELSV formula is known.\n\n'''Example B.''' Let ''g'' = ''n'' = 1. Then\n\n:<math>\\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}} \\frac{c(E^*)}{(1-k_1\\psi_1) \\cdots (1-k_n \\psi_n)} = \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\frac{1-\\lambda_1}{1-k_1\\psi_1} = \\left[\\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\psi_1 \\right] k_1 - \\left[ \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\lambda_1\\right].</math>\n\n== Example ==\nLet ''n'' = ''g'' = 1.  To simplify the notation, denote ''k''<sub>1</sub> by ''k''. We have ''m'' = ''K'' + ''n'' + 2''g'' − 2 = ''k'' + 1.\n\nAccording to Example B, the ELSV formula in this case reads\n\n:<math>h_{1;k} = (k+1)!\\frac{k^k}{k!} \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\frac{1-\\lambda_1}{1-k\\psi_1} = (k+1) k^k \\left\\{ \\left[ \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\psi_1\\right] k - \\left[ \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\lambda_1 \\right]\\right\\}.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, according to Example A, the Hurwitz number ''h''<sub>1, ''k''</sub> equals 1/''k'' times the number of ways to decompose a ''k''-cycle in the symmetric group ''S''<sub>''k''</sub> into a product of ''k'' + 1 transpositions. In particular, ''h''<sub>1, 1</sub> = 0 (since there are no transpositions in ''S''<sub>1</sub>), while ''h''<sub>1, 2</sub> = 1/2 (since there is a unique factorization of the transposition (1 2) in ''S''<sub>2</sub> into a product of three transpositions).\n\nPlugging these two values into the ELSV formula we find\n\n:<math> \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\psi_1 = \\int_{\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{1,1}} \\lambda_1= \\frac1{24}.</math>\n\nFrom which we deduce\n\n:<math>h_{1;k} = \\frac{(k^2-1) k^k}{24}.</math>\n\n== History ==\nThe ELSV formula was announced by {{Harvtxt|Ekedahl|Lando|Shapiro|Vainshtein|1999}}, but with an erroneous sign. {{Harvtxt|Fantechi|Pandharipande|2002}} proved it for ''k''<sub>1</sub> = ... = ''k''<sub>''n''</sub> = 1 (with the corrected sign). {{Harvtxt|Graber|Vakil|2003}} proved the formula in full generality using the localization techniques. The proof announced by the four initial authors followed {{Harv|Ekedahl|Lando|Shapiro|Vainshtein|2001}}. Now that the space of stable maps to the projective line relative to a point has been constructed by {{Harvtxt|Li|2001}}, a proof can be obtained immediately by applying the virtual localization to this space.\n\n{{Harvtxt|Kazarian|2009}}, building on preceding work of several people, gave a unified way to deduce most known results in the intersection theory of <math> {\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}}_{g,n} </math> from the ELSV formula.\n\n== Idea of proof ==\nLet <math> \\mathcal{M}_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math> be the space of stable maps ''f'' from a genus ''g'' curve to '''P'''<sup>1</sup>('''C''') such that ''f'' has exactly ''n'' poles of orders <math> k_1, \\dots, k_n </math>.\n\nThe ''branching morphism'' ''br'' or the ''Lyashko–Looijenga map'' assigns to <math> f \\in \\mathcal{M}_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math> the unordered set of its ''m'' branch points in '''C''' with multiplicities taken into account. Actually, this definition only works if ''f'' is a smooth map. But it has a natural extension to the space of stable maps. For instance, the value of ''f'' on a node is considered a double branch point, as can be seen by looking at the family of curves ''C<sub>t</sub>'' given by the equation ''xy'' = ''t'' and the family of maps ''f''<sub>''t''</sub>(''x'', ''y'') = ''x'' + ''y''. As ''t'' → 0, two branch points of ''f''<sub>''t''</sub> tend towards the value of ''f''<sub>0</sub> at the node of ''C''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nThe branching morphism is of finite degree, but has infinite fibers. Our aim is now to compute its degree in two different ways.\n\nThe first way is to count the preimages of a generic point in the image. In other words, we count the ramified coverings of '''P'''<sup>1</sup>('''C''') with a branch point of type (''k''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''k''<sub>''n''</sub>) at ∞ and ''m'' more fixed simple branch points. This is precisely the Hurwitz number <math> h_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math>.\n\nThe second way to find the degree of ''br'' is to look at the preimage of the most degenerate point, namely, to put all ''m'' branch points together at 0 in '''C'''.\n\nThe preimage of this point in <math>\\mathcal{M}_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n}</math> is an infinite fiber of ''br'' isomorphic to the moduli space <math>\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} </math>. Indeed, given a stable curve with ''n'' marked points we send this curve to 0 in '''P'''<sup>1</sup>('''C''') and attach to its marked points ''n'' rational components on which the stable map has the form <math> z \\mapsto z^{k_1}, \\dots, z \\mapsto z^{k_n} </math>. Thus we obtain all stable maps in <math> \\mathcal{M}_{g;k_1, \\dots, k_n} </math> unramified outside 0 and ∞. Standard methods of algebraic geometry allow one to find the degree of a map by looking at an infinite fiber and its normal bundle. The result is expressed as an integral of certain characteristic classes over the infinite fiber. In our case this integral happens to be equal to the right-hand side of the ELSV formula.\n\nThus the ELSV formula expresses the equality between two ways to compute the degree of the branching morphism.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]] on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |arxiv=math/9902104 |first=T. |last=Ekedahl |first2=S. |last2=Lando |first3=M. |last3=Shapiro |first4=A. |last4=Vainshtein |title=On Hurwitz numbers and Hodge integrals |journal=Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences |volume=328 |issue=12 |year=1999 |pages=1175–1180 |doi=10.1016/S0764-4442(99)80435-2 |bibcode=1999CRASM.328.1175E }}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |first=T. |last=Ekedahl |first2=S. |last2=Lando |first3=M. |last3=Shapiro |first4=A. |last4=Vainshtein |arxiv=math/0004096 |title=Hurwitz numbers and intersections on moduli spaces of curves |journal=Invent.

In 1983 it was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gerd Faltings|first=Gerd|last=Faltings|year1=1983|year2=1984}}, and is now known as '''Faltings's theorem'''. The conjecture was later generalized by replacing '''Q''' by any [[number field]].\n\n==Background==\nLet ''C'' be a [[non-singular]] algebraic curve of [[genus (mathematics)|genus]] ''g'' over '''Q'''. Then the set of rational points on ''C'' may be determined as follows:\n\n* Case ''g'' = 0: no points or infinitely many; ''C'' is handled as a [[conic section]].\n* Case ''g'' = 1: no points, or ''C'' is an [[elliptic curve]] and its rational points form a [[finitely generated abelian group]] (''Mordell's Theorem'', later generalized to the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]]). Moreover, [[Mazur's torsion theorem]] restricts the structure of the torsion subgroup.\n* Case ''g'' > 1: according to the Mordell conjecture, now Faltings's theorem, ''C'' has only a finite number of rational points.\n\n==Proofs==\n{{harvs|txt|last=Shafarevich|authorlink=Igor Shafarevich|year=1963}} posed a finiteness conjecture that asserted that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of abelian varieties of fixed dimension and fixed polarization degree over a fixed number field with [[good reduction]] outside a given finite set of [[place (mathematics)|place]]s. {{harvs|txt|last=Parshin|authorlink=Aleksei Parshin|year=1968}} showed that the Mordell conjecture would hold if the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture was true using Parshin's trick, which gives an embedding of a curve into the [[Siegel modular variety]].\n\n{{harvs|txt|last=Faltings|authorlink=Gerd Faltings|year=1983}} proved the Shafarevich finiteness conjecture using a known reduction to a case of the [[Tate conjecture]], and a number of tools from [[algebraic geometry]], including the theory of [[Néron model]]s.\n\n===Later proofs===\nA proof based on [[diophantine approximation]] was given by {{harvs|txt|last=Vojta|authorlink=Paul Vojta|year=1991}}. A more elementary variant of Vojta's proof was given by {{harvs|txt|last1=Bombieri|author1-link=Enrico Bombieri|year=1990}}.\n\n==Consequences==\nFaltings's 1983 paper had as consequences a number of statements which had previously been conjectured:\n\n* The ''Mordell conjecture'' that a curve of genus greater than 1 over a number field has only finitely many rational points;\n* The ''Isogeny theorem'' that [[abelian varieties]] with isomorphic [[Tate module]]s (as '''Q'''<sub>''ℓ''</sub>-modules with Galois action) are [[Isogeny|isogenous]].\n\nA sample application of Faltings's theorem is to a weak form of [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]: for any fixed ''n'' > 4 there are at most finitely many primitive integer solutions to ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''c''<sup>''n''</sup>, since for such ''n'' the curve ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 has genus greater than 1.\n\n==Generalizations==\nBecause of the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]], Faltings's theorem can be reformulated as a statement about the intersection of a curve ''C'' with a finitely generated subgroup Γ of an abelian variety ''A''. Generalizing by replacing ''C'' by an arbitrary subvariety of ''A'' and Γ by an arbitrary finite-rank subgroup of ''A'' leads to the [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]], which was proved by {{harvs|txt|last=Faltings|year1=1991|year2=1994}}.\n\nAnother higher-dimensional generalization of Faltings's theorem is the [[Glossary of arithmetic and diophantine geometry#B|Bombieri–Lang conjecture]] that if ''X'' is a [[pseudo-canonical variety]] (i.e., a variety of general type) over a number field ''k'', then ''X''(''k'') is not [[Zariski topology|Zariski]] [[dense set|dense]] in ''X''. Even more general conjectures have been put forth by [[Paul Vojta]].\n\nThe Mordell conjecture for function fields was proved by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yuri Ivanovich Manin|last=Manin|year=1963}} and by {{harvs|txt|last=Grauert|authorlink=Hans Grauert|year=1965}}.

There are several generalizations: the Frobenius endomorphism can be replaced by a more general endomorphism, in which case the points over a finite field are replaced by its fixed points, and there is also a more general version for a [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] over the variety, where the cohomology groups are replaced by cohomology with coefficients in the sheaf.\n\nThe Grothendieck trace formula is an analogue in algebraic geometry of the [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] in [[algebraic topology]].\n\nOne application of the Grothendieck trace formula is to express the [[Hasse–Weil zeta function|zeta function]] of a variety over a finite field, or more generally the [[L-function|L-series]] of a sheaf, as a sum over traces of Frobenius on cohomology groups.

      "text": "[[File:Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch.jpg|thumb|Grothendieck's comment on the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]]\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic geometry]], the '''Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem''' is a far-reaching result on [[coherent cohomology]]. It is a generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], about [[complex manifold]]s, which is itself a generalisation of the classical [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] for [[line bundle]]s on [[compact Riemann surface]]s.\n\nRiemann–Roch type theorems relate [[Euler characteristic]]s of the [[cohomology]] of a [[vector bundle]] with their [[topological degree]]s, or more generally their characteristic classes in (co)homology or algebraic analogues thereof. The classical Riemann–Roch theorem does this for curves and line bundles, whereas the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem generalises this to vector bundles over manifolds. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem sets both theorems in a relative situation of a [[morphism]] between two manifolds (or more general [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]) and changes the theorem from a statement about a single bundle, to one applying to [[chain complex]]es of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]].\n\nThe theorem has been very influential, not least for the development of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]. Conversely, [[complex analysis|complex analytic]] analogues of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem can be proved using the index theorem for families. [[Alexander Grothendieck]] gave a first proof in a 1957 manuscript, later published.<ref>A. Grothendieck. Classes de faisceaux et théorème de Riemann-Roch (1957). Published in SGA 6, Springer-Verlag (1971), 20-71.</ref> [[Armand Borel]] and [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] wrote up and published Grothendieck's proof in 1958.<ref>A. Borel and J.-P. Serre. Bull. Soc. Math. France 86 (1958), 97-136.</ref> Later, Grothendieck and his collaborators simplified and generalized the proof.<ref>SGA 6, Springer-Verlag (1971).</ref>\n\n==Formulation==\nLet ''X'' be a [[smooth scheme|smooth]] [[quasi-projective scheme]] over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. Under these assumptions, the [[Grothendieck group]]\n\n:<math>K_0(X)\\,</math>\n\nof [[bounded complex]]es of [[coherent sheaf|coherent sheaves]] is canonically isomorphic to the Grothendieck group of bounded complexes of finite-rank vector bundles. Using this isomorphism, consider the [[Chern character]] (a rational combination of [[Chern classes]]) as a [[functor]]ial transformation\n\n:<math>\\mbox{ch} \\colon K_0(X) \\to A(X, {\\mathbb Q}),</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>A_d(X,{\\mathbb Q})\\,</math>\n\nis the [[Chow ring|Chow group]] of cycles on ''X'' of dimension ''d'' modulo [[Chow ring#Rational equivalence|rational equivalence]], [[tensor product|tensor]]ed with the [[rational number]]s. In case ''X'' is defined over the [[complex number]]s, the latter group maps to the topological [[cohomology group]]\n\n:<math>H^{2 \\mathrm{dim}(X) - 2d}(X, {\\mathbb Q}).</math>\n\nNow consider a [[proper morphism]]\n\n:<math>f \\colon X \\to Y\\,</math>\n\nbetween smooth quasi-projective schemes and a bounded complex of sheaves <math>{\\mathcal F^\\bull}</math> on <math>X.</math>\n\nThe '''Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem''' relates the pushforward map\n\n:<math>f_{\\mbox{!}} = \\sum (-1)^i R^i f_* \\colon K_0(X) \\to K_0(Y)</math>\n\nand the pushforward\n\n:<math>f_* \\colon A(X) \\to A(Y),\\,</math>\n\nby the formula\n\n:<math> \\mbox{ch}(f_{\\mbox{!}}{\\mathcal F}^\\bull)\\mbox{td}(Y) = f_* (\\mbox{ch}({\\mathcal F}^\\bull) \\mbox{td}(X) ). </math>\n \nHere td(''X'') is the [[Todd genus]] of (the [[tangent bundle]] of) ''X''. Thus the theorem gives a precise measure for the lack of commutativity of taking the push forwards in the above senses and the Chern character and shows that the needed correction factors depend on ''X'' and ''Y'' only. In fact, since the Todd genus is functorial and multiplicative in [[exact sequence]]s, we can rewrite the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula as\n\n:<math> \\mbox{ch}(f_{\\mbox{!}}{\\mathcal F}^\\bull) = f_* (\\mbox{ch}({\\mathcal F}^\\bull) \\mbox{td}(T_f) ),</math>\n\nwhere ''T''<sub>''f''</sub> is the relative tangent sheaf of ''f'', defined as the element ''TX'' − ''f''<sup>*</sup>''TY'' in ''K''<sub>0</sub>(''X''). For example, when ''f'' is a [[smooth morphism]], ''T''<sub>''f''</sub> is simply a vector bundle, known as the tangent bundle along the fibers of ''f''.\n\nUsing [[A1 homotopy theory|'''A'''<sup>1</sup>-homotopy theory]], the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem has been extended by {{harvtxt|Navarro|Navarro|2017}} to the situation where ''f'' is a [[proper map]] between two smooth schemes.\n\n==Generalising and specialising==\n\nGeneralisations of the theorem can be made to the non-smooth case by considering an appropriate generalisation of the combination ch(&mdash;)td(''X'') and to the non-proper case by considering [[cohomology with compact support]]. \n  \nThe [[arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem]] extends the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem to [[arithmetic scheme]]s.\n\nThe [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] is (essentially) the special case where ''Y'' is a point and the field is the field of complex numbers.\n\nThe version of Riemann-Roch theorem for oriented cohomology theories was proven by I. Panin and A.

It was made public at the initial [[Bonn Arbeitstagung]], in 1957. Serre and [[Armand Borel]] subsequently organized a seminar at Princeton to understand it. The final published paper was in effect the Borel–Serre exposition.\n\nThe significance of Grothendieck's approach rests on several points.  First, Grothendieck changed the statement itself: the theorem was, at the time, understood to be a theorem about a [[algebraic variety|variety]], whereas Grothendieck saw it as a theorem about a morphism between varieties. By finding the right generalization, the proof became simpler while the conclusion became more general. In short, Grothendieck applied a strong [[category theory|categorical]] approach to a hard piece of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].  Moreover, Grothendieck introduced [[Algebraic K-theory|K-groups]], as discussed above, which paved the way for [[algebraic K-theory]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Kawasaki's Riemann–Roch formula]]<!-- subsumed in the Riemann-Roch for algebraic stacks -->\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n | last = Berthelot\n | first = Pierre\n | authorlink = Pierre Berthelot (mathematician) |editor=[[Alexandre Grothendieck]] |editor2=[[Luc Illusie]]\n | title = Séminaire de Géométrie Algébrique du Bois Marie - 1966-67 - Théorie des intersections et théorème de Riemann-Roch - (SGA 6) (Lecture notes in mathematics '''225''')\n | year = 1971\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]\n | location = Berlin; New York\n | language = French\n | pages = xii+700\n | nopp = true\n |doi=10.1007/BFb0066283\n |isbn= 978-3-540-05647-8\n}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | last2=Serre | first2=Jean-Pierre | author2-link=Jean-Pierre Serre | title=Le théorème de Riemann–Roch | mr=0116022 | year=1958 | journal=Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France | volume=86 | pages=97–136 | issn=0037-9484 | language=French }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Fulton | first1=William | author1-link=William Fulton (mathematician) | title=Intersection theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=3-540-62046-X | mr=1644323 | year=1998 | zbl=0885.14002 | edition=2nd | series=Ergebnisse der Mathematik und ihrer Grenzgebiete. 3.

      "title": "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_Nullstellensatz",
      "text": "'''Hilbert's Nullstellensatz''' (German for \"theorem of zeros,\" or more literally, \"zero-locus-theorem\"—see ''[[wikt:Satz|Satz]]'') is a theorem that establishes a fundamental relationship between [[geometry]] and [[algebra]]. This relationship is the basis of [[algebraic geometry]], a branch of [[mathematics]]. It relates [[algebraic set]]s to [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] in [[polynomial ring]]s over [[algebraically closed field]]s. This relationship was discovered by [[David Hilbert]] who proved the Nullstellensatz and several other important related theorems named after him (like [[Hilbert's basis theorem]]).\n\n== Formulation ==\nLet ''k'' be a field (such as the [[rational number]]s) and ''K'' be an algebraically closed field extension (such as the [[complex number]]s), consider the [[polynomial ring]] <math>k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]</math> and let ''I'' be an [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in this ring. The [[algebraic set]] V(''I'') defined by this ideal consists of all ''n''-tuples '''x''' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>,...,''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''K<sup>n</sup>'' such that ''f''('''x''') = 0 for all ''f'' in ''I''. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz states that if ''p'' is some polynomial in <math>k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]</math> that vanishes on the algebraic set V(''I''), i.e. ''p''('''x''') = 0 for all '''x''' in ''V''(''I''), then there exists a [[natural number]] ''r'' such that ''p''<sup>''r''</sup> is in ''I''.\n\nAn immediate corollary is the \"weak Nullstellensatz\": The ideal <math>I \\subset k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n]</math> contains 1 if and only if the polynomials in ''I'' do not have any common zeros in ''K<sup>n</sup>''. It may also be formulated as follows: if ''I'' is a proper ideal in <math>k[X_1, \\ldots, X_n],</math> then V(''I'') cannot be [[empty set|empty]], i.e. there exists a common zero for all the polynomials in the ideal in every algebraically closed extension of ''k''. This is the reason for the name of the theorem, which can be proved easily from the 'weak' form using the [[Rabinowitsch trick]]. The assumption of considering common zeros in an algebraically closed field is essential here; for example, the elements of the proper ideal (''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1) in <math>\\R[X]</math> do not have a common zero in <math>\\R.</math>\n\nWith the notation common in algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz can also be formulated as\n\n:<math>\\hbox{I}(\\hbox{V}(J))=\\sqrt{J}</math>\n\nfor every ideal ''J''. Here, <math>\\sqrt{J}</math> denotes the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of ''J'' and I(''U'') is the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on the set ''U''.\n\nIn this way, we obtain an order-reversing [[bijective]] correspondence between the algebraic sets in ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> and the [[radical ideal]]s of <math>K[X_1, \\ldots, X_n].</math> In fact, more generally, one has a [[Galois connection]] between subsets of the space and subsets of the algebra, where \"[[Zariski closure]]\" and \"radical of the ideal generated\" are the [[closure operator]]s.\n\nAs a particular example, consider a point <math>P = (a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in K^n</math>. Then <math>I(P) = (X_1 - a_1, \\ldots, X_n - a_n)</math>. More generally,\n\n:<math>\\sqrt{I} = \\bigcap_{(a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in V(I)}  (X_1 - a_1, \\dots, X_n - a_n).</math>\n\nConversely, every [[maximal ideal]] of the polynomial ring <math>K[X_1,\\ldots,X_n]</math> (note that <math>K</math> is algebraically closed) is of the form <math>(X_1 - a_1, \\ldots, X_n - a_n)</math> for some <math>a_1,\\ldots,a_n \\in K</math>.\n\nAs another example, an algebraic subset ''W'' in ''K''<sup>''n''</sup> is irreducible (in the Zariski topology) if and only if <math>I(W)</math> is a prime ideal.\n\n== Proof and generalization ==\nThere are many known proofs of the theorem. One proof <!-- due to Zariski? --> uses [[Zariski's lemma]], which asserts that, if a field is [[finitely generated algebra|finitely generated]] as an [[associative algebra]] over a field ''k'', then it is a [[finite field extension]] of ''k'' (that is, it is also finitely generated as a [[vector space]]). Here is a sketch of this proof.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah-MacDonald|1969|loc=Ch. 7}}</ref>\n\nLet <math>A = k[t_1, \\ldots, t_n]</math> (''k'' algebraically closed field), ''I'' an ideal of ''A'' and ''V'' the common zeros of ''I'' in <math>k^n</math>. Clearly, <math>\\sqrt{I} \\subseteq I(V)</math>. Let <math>f \\not\\in \\sqrt{I}</math>. Then <math>f \\not\\in \\mathfrak{p}</math> for some prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}\\supseteq I</math> in ''A''. Let <math>R = (A/\\mathfrak{p}) [f^{-1}]</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> a maximal ideal in <math>R</math>. By Zariski's lemma, <math>R/\\mathfrak{m}</math> is a finite extension of ''k''; thus, is ''k'' since ''k'' is algebraically closed. Let <math>x_i</math> be the images of <math>t_i</math> under the natural map <math>A \\to k</math>. It follows that <math>x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in V</math> and <math>f(x) \\ne 0</math>.\n\nThe Nullstellensatz will also follow trivially once one systematically developed the theory of a [[Jacobson ring]], a ring in which a radical ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. Let <math>R</math> be a Jacobson ring. If <math>S</math> is a finitely generated [[associative algebra|''R''-algebra]], then <math>S</math> is a Jacobson ring. Further, if <math>\\mathfrak{n}\\subset S</math> is a maximal ideal, then <math>\\mathfrak{m} := \\mathfrak{n} \\cap R</math> is a maximal ideal of R, and <math>S/\\mathfrak{n}</math> is a finite extension field of <math>R/\\mathfrak{m}</math>.\n\nAnother generalization states that a faithfully flat morphism of schemes <math>f: Y \\to X</math> locally of finite type with ''X'' quasi-compact has a ''quasi-section'', i.e. there exists <math>X'</math> affine and faithfully flat and quasi-finite over ''X'' together with an ''X''-morphism <math>X' \\to Y</math>\n\n== Effective Nullstellensatz ==\nIn all of its variants, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz asserts that some polynomial {{mvar|g}} belongs or not to an ideal generated, say, by {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f<sub>k</sub>''}}; we have {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f<sup>&thinsp;r</sup>''}} in the strong version, {{math|''g'' {{=}} 1}} in the weak form. This means the existence or the non-existence of polynomials {{math|''g''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''g<sub>k</sub>''}} such that {{math|''g'' {{=}} ''f''<sub>1</sub>''g''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''f<sub>k</sub>g<sub>k</sub>''}}. The usual proofs of the Nullstellensatz are not constructive, non-effective, in the sense that they do not give any way to compute the {{math|''g<sub>i</sub>''}}.\n\nIt is thus a rather natural question to ask if there is an effective way to compute the {{math|''g<sub>i</sub>''}} (and the exponent {{mvar|r}} in the strong form) or to prove that they do not exist. To solve this problem, it suffices to provide an upper bound on the total degree of the {{math|''g<sub>i</sub>''}}: such a bound reduces the problem to a finite [[system of linear equations]] that may be solved by usual [[linear algebra]] techniques. Any such upper bound is called an '''effective Nullstellensatz'''.\n\nA related problem is the '''ideal membership problem''', which consists in testing if a polynomial belongs to an ideal. For this problem also, a solution is provided by an upper bound on the degree of the {{math|''g<sub>i</sub>''}}. A general solution of the ideal membership problem provides an effective Nullstellensatz, at least for the weak form.\n\nIn 1925, [[Grete Hermann]] gave an upper bound for ideal membership problem that is doubly exponential in the number of variables. In 1982 Mayr and Meyer gave an example where the {{math|''g<sub>i</sub>''}} have a degree that is at least double exponential, showing that every general upper bound for the ideal membership problem is doubly exponential in the number of variables.  \n\nSince most mathematicians at the time assumed the effective Nullstellensatz was at least as hard as ideal membership, few mathematicians sought a bound better than double-exponential.  In 1987, however, [[W. Dale Brownawell]] gave an upper bound for the effective Nullstellensatz that is simply exponential in the number of variables.<ref>{{citation|last=Brownawell|first=W. Dale|title=Bounds for the degrees in the Nullstellensatz|journal=[[Ann. of Math.]]|volume=126|year=1987|issue=3|pages=577–591|mr=0916719|doi=10.2307/1971361}}</ref>  Brownawell's proof relied on analytic techniques valid only in characteristic 0, but, one year later, [[János Kollár]] gave a purely algebraic proof, valid in any characteristic, of a slightly better bound.\n\nIn the case of the weak Nullstellensatz, Kollár's bound is the following:<ref>{{citation| first=János| last=Kollár| title=Sharp Effective Nullstellensatz|journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]| volume = 1| issue=4|year=1988|pages=963–975|url=http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/MISC/BIBLIOTECA/trunk/Kollar/kollarnullstellen.pdf| doi=10.2307/1990996 | mr=0944576}}</ref>\n\n:Let {{math|''f''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''f<sub>s</sub>''}} be polynomials in {{math|''n'' ≥ 2}} variables, of total degree {{math|''d''<sub>1</sub> ≥ ... ≥ ''d<sub>s</sub>''}}.

To do that, we introduce some notations. Let <math>R = k[t_0, \\ldots, t_n].</math> The homogeneous ideal, \n\n:<math>R_+ = \\bigoplus_{d \\geqslant 1} R_d</math> \n\nis called the ''maximal homogeneous ideal'' (see also [[irrelevant ideal]]). As in the affine case, we let: for a subset <math>S \\subseteq \\mathbb{P}^n</math> and a homogeneous ideal ''I'' of ''R'',\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{I}_{\\mathbb{P}^n}(S) &= \\{ f \\in R_+ \\mid f = 0 \\text{ on } S \\}, \\\\\n\\operatorname{V}_{\\mathbb{P}^n}(I) &= \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{P}^n \\mid f(x) = 0 \\text{ for all } f \\in I \\}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy <math>f = 0 \\text{ on } S</math> we mean: for every homogeneous coordinates <math>(a_0 : \\cdots : a_n)</math> of a point of ''S'' we have <math>f(a_0,\\ldots, a_n)=0</math>. This implies that the homogeneous components of ''f'' are also zero on ''S'' and thus that <math>\\operatorname{I}_{\\mathbb{P}^n}(S)</math> is a homogeneous ideal.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem''', named after [[Friedrich Hirzebruch]], [[Bernhard Riemann]], and [[Gustav Roch]], is Hirzebruch's 1954 result contributing to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem|Riemann–Roch problem]] for complex [[algebraic varieties]] of all dimensions. It was the first successful generalisation of the classical [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] on [[Riemann surface]]s to all higher dimensions, and paved the way to the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] proved about three years later.\n\n==Statement of Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem==\nThe  Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem applies to any holomorphic [[vector bundle]] ''E'' on a [[compact space|compact]] [[complex manifold]] ''X'', to calculate the [[holomorphic Euler characteristic]] of ''E'' in [[sheaf cohomology]], namely the alternating sum\n\n:<math> \\chi(X,E) = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\dim_{\\Complex} X} (-1)^{i} \\dim_{\\Complex} H^{i}(X,E) </math>\n\nof the dimensions as complex vector spaces.\n\nHirzebruch's theorem states that &chi;(''X'', ''E'') is computable in terms of the [[Chern class]]es ''C<sub>j</sub>''(''E'') of ''E'', and the [[Todd polynomial]]s ''T<sub>j</sub>'' in the Chern classes of the holomorphic [[tangent bundle]] of ''X''. These all lie in the [[cohomology ring]] of ''X''; by use of the [[fundamental class]] (or, in other words, integration over ''X'') we can obtain numbers from classes in <math>H^{2n}(X).</math> The Hirzebruch formula asserts that\n\n:<math> \\chi(X,E) = \\sum \\operatorname{ch}_{n-j}(E) \\frac{T_{j}}{j!} </math>\n\ntaken over all relevant ''j'' (so 0 &le; ''j'' &le; ''n''), using the [[Chern character]] ch(''E'') in cohomology. In other words, the cross products are formed in the cohomology ring of all the 'matching' degrees that add up to 2''n'', where to 'massage' the ''C<sub>j</sub>''(''E'') a formal manipulation is done, setting\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ch}(E) = \\sum \\exp(x_{i}) </math>\n\nand the total Chern class\n\n:<math> C(E) = \\sum C_{j}(E) = \\prod (1 + x_{i}).</math>\n\nFormulated differently the theorem gives the equality\n\n:<math> \\chi(X,E) = \\int_X \\operatorname{ch}(E) \\operatorname{td}(X)</math>\n\nwhere ''td(X)'' is the [[Todd class]] of the tangent bundle of ''X''.\n\nSignificant special cases are when ''E'' is a complex [[line bundle]], and when ''X'' is an [[algebraic surface]] ('''Noether's formula'''). Weil's Riemann–Roch theorem for vector bundles on curves, and the Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic surfaces (see below), are included in its scope. The formula also expresses in a precise way the vague notion that the [[Todd class]]es are in some sense reciprocals of [[characteristic class]]es.\n\n==Riemann Roch theorem for curves==\nFor curves, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the classical [[Riemann–Roch theorem]]. To see this, recall that for each [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]] ''D'' on a curve there is an [[invertible sheaf]] O(''D'') (which corresponds to a line bundle) such that the [[linear systems of divisors|linear system]] of ''D'' is more or less the space of sections of O(''D''). For curves the Todd class is <math>1+c_1(T(X))/2,</math> and the Chern character of a sheaf O(''D'') is just 1+''c''<sub>1</sub>(O(''D'')), so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that\n\n: <math>h^0(\\mathcal{O}(D)) - h^1(\\mathcal{O}(D)) = c_1(\\mathcal{O}(D)) +c_1(T(X))/2\\ \\ \\ </math> (integrated over ''X'').\n\nBut ''h''<sup>0</sup>(O(''D'')) is just ''l''(''D''), the dimension of the linear system of ''D'', and by [[Serre duality]] ''h''<sup>1</sup>(O(''D'')) = ''h''<sup>0</sup>(O(''K''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''D'')) = ''l''(''K''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''D'') where ''K'' is the [[canonical divisor]]. Moreover, ''c''<sub>1</sub>(O(''D'')) integrated over ''X'' is the degree of ''D'', and ''c''<sub>1</sub>(''T''(''X'')) integrated over ''X'' is the Euler class 2&nbsp;−&nbsp;2''g'' of the curve ''X'', where ''g'' is the genus. So we get the classical Riemann Roch theorem\n\n: <math>\\ell(D)-\\ell(K-D) = \\text{deg}(D)+1-g.</math>\n\nFor vector bundles ''V'', the Chern character is rank(''V'') + ''c''<sub>1</sub>(''V''), so we get Weil's Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles over curves:\n\n: <math>h^0(V) - h^1(V) = c_1(V) + \\operatorname{rank}(V)(1-g).</math>\n\n==Riemann Roch theorem for surfaces==\n{{main|Riemann-Roch theorem for surfaces}}\nFor surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the [[Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces]]\n\n: <math>\\chi(D) = \\chi(\\mathcal{O}) + ((D.D)-(D.K))/2.</math>\n\ncombined with the Noether formula.\n\nIf we want, we can use Serre duality to express ''h''<sup>2</sup>(O(''D'')) as ''h''<sup>0</sup>(O(''K''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''D'')), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the ''h''<sup>1</sup>(O(''D'')) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).\n\n==Asymptotic Riemann-Roch==\n\nLet ''D'' be an ample Cartier divisor on an irreducible projective variety ''X'' of dimension ''n''.

A group for which the maximum is achieved is called a '''Hurwitz group''', and the corresponding Riemann surface a '''[[Hurwitz surface]]'''.

It manifests itself in many diverse situations and on several levels. In the context of compact Riemann surfaces ''X'', via the Riemann [[uniformization theorem]], this can be seen as a distinction between the surfaces of different topologies:\n* ''X'' a [[Riemann sphere|sphere]], a compact Riemann surface of [[genus (topology)|genus]] zero with ''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0;\n* ''X'' a flat [[torus]], or an [[elliptic curve]], a Riemann surface of genus one with  ''K''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0;\n* and ''X'' a [[Riemann surface#Hyperbolic Riemann surfaces|hyperbolic surface]], which has genus greater than one and ''K''&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.\n\nWhile in the first two cases the surface ''X'' admits infinitely many conformal automorphisms (in fact, the conformal [[automorphism group]] is a complex [[Lie group]] of dimension three for a sphere and of dimension one for a torus), a hyperbolic Riemann surface only admits a discrete set of automorphisms. Hurwitz's theorem claims that in fact more is true: it provides a uniform bound on the order of the automorphism group as a function of the genus and characterizes those Riemann surfaces for which the bound is [[Mathematical jargon#sharp|sharp]].\n\n==Statement and proof==\n\n'''Theorem''': Let <math>X</math> be a smooth connected Riemann surface of genus <math>g \\ge 2</math>. Then its automorphism group <math>\\mathrm{Aut}(X)</math> has size at most <math>84(g-1)</math>\n\n''Proof:'' Assume for now that <math>G = \\mathrm{Aut}(X)</math> is finite (we'll prove this at the end).\n* Consider the quotient map <math>X \\to X/G</math>. Since <math>G</math> acts by holomorphic functions, the quotient is locally of the form <math>z \\to z^n</math> and the quotient  <math>X/G</math> is a smooth Riemann surface. The quotient map <math>X \\to X/G</math> is a branched cover, and we will see below that the ramification points correspond to the orbits that have a non trivial stabiliser. Let <math>g_0</math> be the genus of <math>X/G</math>.\n* By the [[Riemann-Hurwitz formula]],\n::<math> 2g-2 \\ = \\ |G| \\cdot \\left( 2g_0-2 + \\sum_{i = 1}^k \\left(1-\\frac{1}{e_i}\\right)\\right) </math>\n:where the sum is over the <math>k</math> ramification points <math>p_i \\in X/G</math> for the quotient map<math> X \\to X/G</math>. The ramification index <math>e_i</math> at <math>p_i</math> is just the order of the stabiliser group, since <math>e_i f_i= \\mathrm{deg}(X/\\, X/G)</math> where <math>f_i</math> the number of pre-images of <math>p_i</math> (the number of points in the orbit), and <math>\\mathrm{deg}(X/\\, X/G) = |G|</math>. By definition of ramification points, <math>e_i \\ge 2</math> for all <math>k</math> ramification indices. \n\nNow call the righthand side <math>|G| R</math> and note that since <math>g \\ge 2 </math> we must have <math>R>0</math>.

Since <math>\\mathrm{fix}(\\phi)</math> is a closed complex sub variety of positive dimension and <math>X</math> is a smooth connected curve (i.e. <math>\\dim_{\\mathbf C}(X) = 1</math>), we must have <math>\\mathrm{fix}(\\phi) = X</math>.

The conformal mappings of the surface correspond to orientation-preserving automorphisms of the hyperbolic plane. By the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]], the area of the surface is\n\n: A(''X'') = &minus; 2π &chi;(''X'') = 4π(''g'' &minus; 1).\n\nIn order to make the automorphism group ''G'' of ''X'' as large as possible, we want the area of its [[fundamental domain]] ''D'' for this action to be as small as possible. If the fundamental domain is a triangle with the vertex angles π/p, π/q and π/r, defining a [[tessellation|tiling]] of the hyperbolic plane, then ''p'', ''q'', and ''r'' are integers greater than one, and the area is \n \n: A(''D'') = π(1 &minus; 1/''p'' &minus; 1/''q'' &minus; 1/''r'').\n\nThus we are asking for integers which make the expression\n\n:1 &minus; 1/''p'' &minus; 1/''q'' &minus; 1/''r''\n\nstrictly positive and as small as possible. This minimal value is 1/42, and\n\n:1 &minus; 1/2 &minus; 1/3 &minus; 1/7 = 1/42\n\ngives a unique (up to permutation) triple of such integers. This would indicate that the order |''G''| of the automorphism group is bounded by\n\n: A(''X'')/A(''D'') &nbsp;&le;&nbsp; 168(''g'' &minus; 1).\n\nHowever, a more delicate reasoning shows that this is an overestimate by the factor of two, because the group ''G'' can contain orientation-reversing transformations. For the orientation-preserving conformal automorphisms the bound is  84(''g'' &minus; 1).\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:3-7 kisrhombille.svg|thumb|Hurwitz groups and surfaces are constructed based on the tiling of the hyperbolic plane by the (2,3,7) [[Schwarz triangle]].]]\nTo obtain an example of a Hurwitz group, let us start with a (2,3,7)-tiling of the hyperbolic plane. Its full symmetry group is the full [[(2,3,7) triangle group]] generated by the reflections across the sides of a single fundamental triangle with the angles π/2, π/3 and π/7. Since a reflection flips the triangle and changes the orientation, we can join the triangles in pairs and obtain an orientation-preserving tiling polygon.\nA Hurwitz surface is obtained by 'closing up' a part of this infinite tiling of the hyperbolic plane to a compact Riemann surface of genus ''g''. This will necessarily involve exactly 84(''g'' &minus; 1) double triangle tiles.\n\nThe following two [[regular tiling]]s have the desired symmetry group; the rotational group corresponds to rotation about an edge, a vertex, and a face, while the full symmetry group would also include a reflection. Note that the polygons in the tiling are not fundamental domains – the tiling by (2,3,7) triangles refines both of these and is not regular.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|[[File:Heptagonal tiling.svg|100px]]<br>[[order-3 heptagonal tiling]]\n|[[File:Order-7 triangular tiling.svg|100px]]<br>[[order-7 triangular tiling]]\n|}\n[[Wythoff construction]]s yields further [[uniform tiling]]s, yielding [[Order-3 heptagonal tiling#Wythoff constructions from heptagonal and triangular tilings|eight uniform tilings]], including the two regular ones given here. These all descend to Hurwitz surfaces, yielding tilings of the surfaces (triangulation, tiling by heptagons, etc.).\n\nFrom the arguments above it can be inferred that a Hurwitz group ''G'' is characterized by the property that it is a finite quotient of the group with two generators ''a'' and ''b'' and three relations\n\n:<math>a^2 = b^3 = (ab)^7 = 1,\\,</math>\n\nthus ''G'' is a finite group generated by two elements of orders two and three, whose product is of order seven. More precisely, any Hurwitz surface, that is, a hyperbolic surface that realizes the maximum order of the automorphism group for the surfaces of a given genus, can be obtained by the construction given. \nThis is the last part of the theorem of Hurwitz.\n\n== Examples of Hurwitz groups and surfaces ==\n[[File:Small cubicuboctahedron.png|thumb|The [[small cubicuboctahedron]] is a polyhedral immersion of the tiling of the [[Klein quartic]] by 56 triangles, meeting at 24 vertices.<ref>{{Harv|Richter}} Note each face in the polyhedron consist of multiple faces in the tiling – two triangular faces constitute a square face and so forth, as per [http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/images/mathieu/hypercolors.jpg this explanatory image].</ref>]]\n\nThe smallest Hurwitz group is the projective special linear group [[PSL(2,7)]], of order 168, and the corresponding curve is the [[Klein quartic|Klein quartic curve]].  This group is also isomorphic to [[PSL(2,7)|PSL(3,2)]].\n\nNext is the [[Macbeath surface|Macbeath curve]], with automorphism group PSL(2,8) of order 504. Many more finite simple groups are Hurwitz groups; for instance all but 64 of the [[alternating group]]s are Hurwitz groups, the largest non-Hurwitz example being of degree 167. The smallest alternating group that is a Hurwitz group is A<sub>15</sub>.\n\nMost [[projective special linear group]]s of large rank are Hurwitz groups, {{harv|Lucchini|Tamburini|Wilson|2000}}. For lower ranks, fewer such groups are Hurwitz.  For ''n''<sub>''p''</sub> the order of ''p'' modulo 7, one has that PSL(2,''q'') is Hurwitz if and only if either ''q''=7 or ''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''<sub>''p''</sub></sup>.  Indeed, PSL(3,''q'') is Hurwitz if and only if ''q'' = 2, PSL(4,''q'') is never Hurwitz, and PSL(5,''q'') is Hurwitz if and only if ''q'' = 7<sup>4</sup> or ''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''<sub>''p''</sub></sup>, {{harv|Tamburini|Vsemirnov|2006}}.\n\nSimilarly, many [[group of Lie type|groups of Lie type]] are Hurwitz.  The finite [[classical group]]s of large rank are Hurwitz, {{harv|Lucchini|Tamburini|1999}}.  The [[exceptional Lie group]]s of type G2 and the [[Ree group]]s of type 2G2 are nearly always Hurwitz, {{harv|Malle|1990}}.  Other families of exceptional and twisted Lie groups of low rank are shown to be Hurwitz in {{harv|Malle|1995}}.\n\nThere are 12 [[sporadic groups]] that can be generated as Hurwitz groups: the [[Janko group]]s J<sub>1</sub>, J<sub>2</sub> and J<sub>4</sub>, the [[Fischer group]]s Fi<sub>22</sub> and Fi'<sub>24</sub>, the [[Rudvalis group]], the [[Held group]], the [[Thompson group (finite)|Thompson group]], the [[Harada–Norton group]], the third [[Conway group]] Co<sub>3</sub>, the [[Lyons group]], and  the [[Monster group|Monster]], {{harv|Wilson|2001}}.\n\n==Automorphism groups in low genus==\n\nThe largest ''|Aut(X)|'' can get for a Riemann surface ''X'' of genus ''g'' is shown below, for ''2≤g≤10'', along with a surface ''X<sub>0</sub>'' with ''|Aut(X<sub>0</sub>)|'' maximal. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! genus ''g'' !!

The algebraic Kodaira–Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem is the following statement:\n: If ''k'' is a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero, ''X'' is a [[smooth morphism|smooth]] and [[projective morphism|projective]] ''k''-[[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] of dimension ''d'', and ''L'' is an ample invertible sheaf on ''X'', then \n:::<math> H^q(X,L\\otimes\\Omega^p_{X/k}) = 0 \\text{ for } p+q>d, \\text{ and}</math>\n:::<math> H^q(X,L^{\\otimes-1}\\otimes\\Omega^p_{X/k}) = 0 \\text{ for } p+q<d,</math>\n: where the Ω<sup>p</sup> denote the [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of relative (algebraic) [[differential forms]] (see [[Kähler differential]]). \n{{harvtxt|Raynaud|1978}} showed that this result does not always hold  over fields of characteristic ''p'' > 0, and in particular fails for [[Raynaud surface]]s.\n\nUntil 1987 the only known proof in characteristic zero was however based on the complex analytic proof and the [[GAGA]] comparison theorems. However, in 1987 [[Pierre Deligne]] and [[Luc Illusie]] gave a purely algebraic proof of the vanishing theorem in {{harv|Deligne|Illusie|1987}}. Their proof is based on showing that the [[Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence]] for [[algebraic de Rham cohomology]] degenerates in degree&nbsp;1. This is shown by lifting a corresponding more specific result from characteristic ''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0 — the positive-characteristic result does not hold without limitations but can be lifted to provide the full result.\n\n==Consequences and applications==\nHistorically, the [[Kodaira embedding theorem]] was derived with the help of the vanishing theorem. With application of Serre duality, the vanishing of various sheaf cohomology groups (usually related to the canonical line bundle) of curves and surfaces help with the classification of complex manifolds, e.g. [[Enriques–Kodaira classification]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem]]\n* [[Mumford vanishing theorem]]\n* [[Ramanujam vanishing theorem]]\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation\n  | last = Deligne\n  | first = Pierre\n  | last2 = Illusie\n  | first2 = Luc\n  | title = Relèvements modulo p<sup>2</sup> et décomposition du complexe de de Rham\n  | journal = Inventiones Mathematicae\n  | volume = 89\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 247–270\n  | year = 1987\n  | doi = 10.1007/BF01389078 }}\n*{{Citation | url = http://www.uni-due.de/%7Emat903/books/esvibuch.pdf|last1=Esnault | first1=Hélène | last2=Viehweg | first2=Eckart | title=Lectures on vanishing theorems | publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag | series=DMV Seminar | isbn=978-3-7643-2822-1 |mr=1193913 | year=1992 | volume=20}}\n*[[Phillip Griffiths]] and [[Joe Harris (mathematician)|Joseph Harris]], ''Principles of Algebraic Geometry''\n*{{Citation | last=Kodaira | first=Kunihiko | title=On a differential-geometric method in the theory of analytic stacks | journal=Proc.

Note that the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this map (i.e., <math>G = G(\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q}) \\to G(\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q})</math>) is precisely <math>G(\\mathbf{F}_q)</math>.\n\nThe theorem implies that <math>H^1(\\mathbf{F}_q, G) = H_{\\mathrm{\\acute{e}t}}^1(\\operatorname{Spec}\\mathbf{F}_q, G)</math> &nbsp;\nvanishes,<ref>This is \"unwinding definition\". Here, <math>H^1(\\mathbf{F}_q, G) = H^1(\\operatorname{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q}/\\mathbf{F}_q), G(\\overline{\\mathbf{F}_q}))</math> is [[Galois cohomology]]; cf. Milne, Class field theory.</ref>  and, consequently, any [[torsor (algebraic geometry)|''G''-bundle]] on <math>\\operatorname{Spec} \\mathbf{F}_q</math> is isomorphic to the trivial one. Also, the theorem plays a basic role in the theory of [[finite groups of Lie type]].\n\nIt is not necessary that ''G'' is affine. Thus, the theorem also applies to [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]] (e.g., [[elliptic curve]]s.) In fact, this application was Lang's initial motivation. If ''G'' is affine, the Frobenius <math>\\sigma</math> may be replaced by any surjective map with finitely many fixed points (see below for the precise statement.)\n\nThe proof (given below) actually goes through for any <math>\\sigma</math> that induces a [[nilpotent operator]] on the Lie algebra of ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Springer|1998|loc=Exercise 4.4.18.}}</ref>\n\n== The Lang–Steinberg theorem ==\n{{harvs|txt|last=Steinberg|year=1968|authorlink=Robert Steinberg}} gave a useful improvement to the theorem.\n\nSuppose that ''F'' is an endomorphism of an algebraic group ''G''. The '''Lang map''' is the map from ''G'' to ''G'' taking ''g'' to ''g''<sup>−1</sup>''F''(''g'').\n\nThe '''Lang–Steinberg theorem''' states<ref>{{harvnb|Steinberg|1968|loc=Theorem 10.1}}</ref> that if ''F'' is surjective and has a finite number of fixed points, and ''G'' is a connected affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field,  then the Lang map is surjective.\n\n== Proof of Lang's theorem ==\nDefine:\n:<math>f_a: G \\to G, \\quad f_a(x) = x^{-1}a\\sigma(x).</math>\nThen (identifying the tangent space at ''a'' with the tangent space at the identity element) we have:\n:<math>(d f_a)_e = d(h \\circ (x \\mapsto (x^{-1}, a, \\sigma(x))))_e = dh_{(e, a, e)} \\circ (-1, 0, d\\sigma_e) = -1 + d \\sigma_e</math>&nbsp;\nwhere <math>h(x, y, z) = xyz</math>. It follows <math>(d f_a)_e</math> is bijective since the differential of the Frobenius <math>\\sigma</math> vanishes. Since <math>f_a(bx) = f_{f_a(b)}(x)</math>, we also see that <math>(df_a)_b</math> is bijective for any ''b''.<ref>This implies that <math>f_a</math> is [[étale morphism|étale]].</ref> Let ''X'' be the closure of the image of <math>f_1</math>. The [[smooth point]]s of ''X'' form an open dense subset; thus, there is some ''b'' in ''G'' such that <math>f_1(b)</math> is a smooth point of ''X''. Since the tangent space to ''X'' at <math>f_1(b)</math> and the tangent space to ''G'' at ''b'' have the same dimension, it follows that ''X'' and ''G'' have the same dimension, since ''G'' is smooth. Since ''G'' is connected, the image of <math>f_1</math> then contains an open dense subset ''U'' of ''G''. Now, given an arbitrary element ''a'' in ''G'', by the same reasoning, the image of <math>f_a</math> contains an open dense subset ''V'' of ''G''. The intersection <math>U \\cap V</math> is then nonempty but then this implies ''a'' is in the image of <math>f_1</math>.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*T.A.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefschetz_hyperplane_theorem",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic topology]], the '''Lefschetz hyperplane theorem''' is a precise statement of certain relations between the shape of an [[algebraic variety]] and the shape of its subvarieties. More precisely, the theorem says that for a variety ''X'' embedded in [[projective space]] and a [[hyperplane section]] ''Y'', the [[homology (mathematics)|homology]], [[cohomology]], and [[homotopy group]]s of ''X'' determine those of ''Y''. A result of this kind was first stated by [[Solomon Lefschetz]] for homology groups of complex algebraic varieties. Similar results have since been found for homotopy groups, in positive characteristic, and in other homology and cohomology theories.\n\nA far-reaching generalization of the hard Lefschetz theorem is given by the [[decomposition theorem]].\n\n== The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for complex projective varieties ==\nLet ''X'' be an ''n''-dimensional complex projective algebraic variety in '''CP'''<sup>''N''</sup>, and let ''Y'' be a hyperplane section of ''X'' such that {{nowrap begin}}''U'' = ''X'' ∖ ''Y''{{nowrap end}} is smooth. The Lefschetz theorem refers to any of the following statements:<ref>{{Harvnb|Milnor|1969|loc = Theorem 7.3 and Corollary 7.4}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Voisin|2003|loc = Theorem 1.23}}</ref>\n# The natural map {{nowrap begin}}''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(''Y'', '''Z''') → ''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(''X'', '''Z'''){{nowrap end}} in singular homology is an isomorphism for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' &lt; ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}} and is surjective for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' = ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}}.\n# The natural map {{nowrap begin}}''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') → ''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(''Y'', '''Z'''){{nowrap end}} in singular cohomology is an isomorphism for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' &lt; ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}} and is injective for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' = ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}}.\n# The natural map {{nowrap begin}}π<sub>''k''</sub>(''Y'', '''Z''') → π<sub>''k''</sub>(''X'', '''Z'''){{nowrap end}} is an isomorphism for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' &lt; ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}} and is surjective for {{nowrap begin}}''k'' = ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}}.\nUsing a [[long exact sequence]], one can show that each of these statements is equivalent to a vanishing theorem for certain relative topological invariants. In order, these are:\n# The relative singular homology groups {{nowrap begin}}''H''<sub>''k''</sub>(''X'', ''Y'', '''Z'''){{nowrap end}} are zero for <math>k \\leq n-1</math>.\n# The relative singular cohomology groups {{nowrap begin}}''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(''X'', ''Y'', '''Z'''){{nowrap end}} are zero for <math>k \\leq n-1</math>.\n# The relative homotopy groups {{nowrap begin}}π<sub>''k''</sub>(''X'', ''Y''){{nowrap end}} are zero for <math>k \\leq n-1</math>.\n\n=== Lefschetz's proof ===\n[[Solomon Lefschetz]]<ref>{{harvnb|Lefschetz|1924}}</ref> used his idea of a [[Lefschetz pencil]] to prove the theorem. Rather than considering the hyperplane section ''Y'' alone, he put it into a family of hyperplane sections ''Y''<sub>''t''</sub>, where {{nowrap begin}}''Y'' = ''Y''<sub>0</sub>{{nowrap end}}. Because a generic hyperplane section is smooth, all but a finite number of ''Y''<sub>''t''</sub> are smooth varieties. After removing these points from the ''t''-plane and making an additional finite number of slits, the resulting family of hyperplane sections is topologically trivial. That is, it is a product of a generic ''Y''<sub>''t''</sub> with an open subset of the ''t''-plane. ''X'', therefore, can be understood if one understands how hyperplane sections are identified across the slits and at the singular points. Away from the singular points, the identification can be described inductively. At the singular points, the [[Morse lemma]] implies that there is a choice of coordinate system for ''X'' of a particularly simple form. This coordinate system can be used to prove the theorem directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Griffiths|Spencer|Whitehead|1992}}</ref>\n\n=== Andreotti and Frankel's proof ===\n[[Aldo Andreotti]] and [[Theodore Frankel]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Andreotti|Frankel|1959}}</ref> recognized that Lefschetz's theorem could be recast using [[Morse theory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Milnor|1969|p=39}}</ref> Here the parameter ''t'' plays the role of a Morse function. The basic tool in this approach is the [[Andreotti–Frankel theorem]], which states that a complex [[affine variety]] of complex dimension ''n'' (and thus real dimension 2''n'') has the homotopy type of a [[CW-complex]] of (real) dimension ''n''. This implies that the [[relative homology]] groups of ''Y'' in ''X'' are trivial in degree less than ''n''. The long exact sequence of relative homology then gives the theorem.\n\n=== Thom's and Bott's proofs ===\nNeither Lefschetz's proof nor Andreotti and Frankel's proof directly imply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homotopy groups. An approach that does was found by [[René Thom]] no later than 1957 and was simplified and published by [[Raoul Bott]] in 1959.<ref>{{harvnb|Bott|1959}}</ref> Thom and Bott interpret ''Y'' as the vanishing locus in ''X'' of a section of a line bundle. An application of Morse theory to this section implies  that ''X'' can be constructed from ''Y'' by adjoining cells of dimension ''n'' or more. From this, it follows that the relative homology and homotopy groups of ''Y'' in ''X'' are concentrated in degrees ''n'' and higher, which yields the theorem.\n\n=== Kodaira and Spencer's proof for Hodge groups ===\n[[Kunihiko Kodaira]] and [[Donald C. Spencer]] found that under certain restrictions, it is possible to prove a Lefschetz-type theorem for the Hodge groups ''H''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>. Specifically, assume that ''Y'' is smooth and that the line bundle <math>\\mathcal{O}_X(Y)</math> is ample. Then the restriction map {{nowrap begin}}''H''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>(''X'') → ''H''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>(''Y''){{nowrap end}} is an isomorphism if {{nowrap|''p'' + ''q'' &lt; n &minus; 1}} and is injective if {{nowrap begin}}''p'' + ''q'' = ''n'' &minus; 1{{nowrap end}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazarsfeld|2004|loc = Example 3.1.24}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Voisin|2003|loc = Theorem 1.29}}</ref> By Hodge theory, these cohomology groups are equal to the sheaf cohomology groups <math>H^q(X, \\textstyle\\bigwedge^p\\Omega_X)</math> and <math>H^q(Y, \\textstyle\\bigwedge^p\\Omega_Y)</math>.  Therefore, the theorem follows from applying the [[Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem]] to <math>H^q(X, \\textstyle\\bigwedge^p\\Omega_X|_Y)</math> and using a long exact sequence.\n\nCombining this proof with the [[universal coefficient theorem]] nearly yields the usual Lefschetz theorem for cohomology with coefficients in any field of characteristic zero. It is, however, slightly weaker because of the additional assumptions on ''Y''.\n\n=== Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible sheaves ===\n[[Michael Artin]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]] found a generalization of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to the case where the coefficients of the cohomology lie not in a field but instead in a [[constructible sheaf]]. They prove that for a constructible sheaf ''F'' on an affine variety ''U'', the cohomology groups <math>H^k(U,F)</math> vanish whenever <math>k>n</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazarsfeld|2004|loc=Theorem 3.1.13}}</ref>\n\n== The Lefschetz theorem in other cohomology theories ==\nThe motivation behind Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible sheaves was to give a proof that could be adapted to the setting of étale and <math>\\ell</math>-adic cohomology. Up to some restrictions on the constructible sheaf, the Lefschetz theorem remains true for constructible sheaves in positive characteristic.\n\nThe theorem can also be generalized to [[intersection homology]]. In this setting, the theorem holds for highly singular spaces.\n\nA Lefschetz-type theorem also holds for [[Picard group]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazarsfeld|2004|loc = Example 3.1.25}}</ref>\n\n==Hard Lefschetz theorem==\n{{See also| Lefschetz manifold}}\n\nLet ''X'' be a ''n''-dimensional non-singular complex projective variety in <math>\\mathbb{CP}^N</math>.\nThen in the [[cohomology ring]] of ''X'', the ''k''-fold product with the [[cohomology class]] of a hyperplane gives an isomorphism between <math>H^{n - k}(X)</math> and <math>H^{n + k}(X)</math>.\n\nThis is the '''hard Lefschetz theorem''', christened in French by Grothendieck more colloquially as the ''Théorème de Lefschetz vache''.<ref>{{harvnb|Beauville|}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sabbah|2001}}</ref>  It immediately implies the injectivity part of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nThe hard Lefschetz theorem in fact holds for '''any compact [[Kähler manifold]]''', with the isomorphism in de Rham cohomology given by multiplication by a power of the class of the Kähler form. It can fail for non-Kähler manifolds: for example, [[Hopf surface]]s have vanishing second cohomology groups, so there is no analogue of the second cohomology class of a hyperplane section.\n\nThe hard Lefschetz theorem was proven for [[étale cohomology|<math>\\ell</math>-adic cohomology]] of smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic by {{harvs|txt|last=Deligne|first=Pierre|authorlink=Pierre Deligne|year=1980}}.\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Andreotti | first1=Aldo | authorlink1=Aldo Andreotti | last2=Frankel | first2=Theodore | authorlink2=Theodore Frankel | title=The Lefschetz theorem on hyperplane sections |mr=0177422 | year=1959 | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | issn=0003-486X | volume=69 | pages=713–717 | doi=10.2307/1970034}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Beauville | first1=Arnaud | authorlink=Arnaud Beauville | title=The Hodge Conjecture | citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.2423 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Bott | first1=Raoul | author1-link=Raoul Bott | title=On a theorem of Lefschetz | url=http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS/Repository/1.0/Disseminate?view=body&id=pdf_1&handle=euclid.mmj/1028998225 | accessdate=2010-01-30 |mr=0215323 | year=1959 | journal=[[Michigan Mathematical Journal]] | volume=6 | issue=3 | pages=211–216 | doi=10.1307/mmj/1028998225}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Deligne | first1=Pierre | author1-link=Pierre Deligne | title=La conjecture de Weil.

By [[Hodge theory]], the [[de Rham cohomology]] group ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''C''') decomposes as a direct sum {{nowrap|''H''<sup>0,2</sup>(''X'') &oplus; ''H''<sup>1,1</sup>(''X'') &oplus; ''H''<sup>2,0</sup>(''X'')}}, and it can be proven that the image of ''c''<sub>1</sub> lies in ''H''<sup>1,1</sup>(''X''). The theorem says that the map to {{nowrap|''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') &cap; ''H''<sup>1,1</sup>(''X'')}} is surjective.\n\nIn the special case where ''X'' is a [[projective variety]], holomorphic line bundles are in bijection with linear equivalences class of [[divisor (algebraic geometry)|divisor]]s, and given a divisor ''D'' on ''X'' with associated line bundle ''O(D)'', the class ''c''<sub>1</sub>(''O(D)'') is Poincaré dual to the homology class given by ''D''. Thus, this establishes the usual formulation of the Hodge conjecture for divisors in projective varieties.\n\n== Proof using normal functions ==\nLefschetz's original proof<ref>{{Harvnb|Lefschetz|1924}}</ref> worked on projective surfaces and used normal functions, which were introduced by Poincaré. Suppose that ''C''<sub>''t''</sub> is a pencil of curves on ''X''. Each of these curves has a [[Jacobian variety]] ''JC''<sub>''t''</sub> (if a curve is singular, there is an appropriate generalized Jacobian variety). These can be assembled into a family <math>\\mathcal{J}</math>, the Jacobian of the pencil, which comes with a projection map π to the base ''T'' of the pencil. A '''normal function''' is a (holomorphic) section of π.\n\nFix an embedding of ''X'' in '''P'''<sup>''N''</sup>, and choose a pencil of curves ''C''<sub>''t''</sub> on ''X''.  For a fixed curve Γ on ''X'', the intersection of Γ and ''C''<sub>''t''</sub> is a divisor {{nowrap|''p''<sub>1</sub>(''t'') + ... + ''p''<sub>''d''</sub>(''t'')}} on ''C''<sub>''t''</sub>, where ''d'' is the degree of ''X''. Fix a base point ''p''<sub>0</sub> of the pencil.  Then the divisor {{nowrap|''p''<sub>1</sub>(''t'') + ... + ''p''<sub>''d''</sub>(''t'') &minus; ''dp''<sub>0</sub>}} is a divisor of degree zero, and consequently it determines a class ν<sub>Γ</sub>(''t'') in the Jacobian ''JC''<sub>''t''</sub> for all ''t''. The map from ''t'' to ν<sub>Γ</sub>(''t'') is a normal function. \n\n[[Henri Poincaré]] proved that for a general pencil of curves, all normal functions arose as ν<sub>Γ</sub>(''t'') for some choice of Γ. Lefschetz proved that any normal function determined a class in ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') and that the class of ν<sub>Γ</sub> is the fundamental class of Γ. Furthermore, he proved that a class in ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') is the class of a normal function if and only if it lies in ''H''<sup>1,1</sup>. Together with Poincaré's existence theorem, this proves the theorem on (1,1)-classes.\n\n== Proof using sheaf cohomology ==\nBecause ''X'' is a complex manifold, it admits an [[exponential sheaf sequence]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|Harris|1994|p=37}}</ref>\n:<math>0 \\to \\underline{\\mathbf{Z}} \\stackrel{2\\pi i}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathcal{O}_X \\stackrel{\\operatorname{exp}}{\\longrightarrow} \\mathcal{O}_X^\\times \\to 0.</math>\nTaking sheaf cohomology of this exact sequence gives maps\n:<math>H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^\\times) \\stackrel{c_1}{\\to} H^2(X, \\mathbf{Z}) \\stackrel{i_*}{\\to} H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X).</math>\nThe group {{nowrap|Pic ''X''}} of [[line bundle]]s on ''X'' is isomorphic to <math>H^1(X, \\mathcal{O}_X^\\times)</math>. The first Chern class map is ''c''<sub>1</sub> by definition, so it suffices to show that ''i''<sub>*</sub> is zero.\n\nBecause ''X'' is Kähler, [[Hodge theory]] implies that <math>H^2(X, \\mathcal{O}_X) \\cong H^{0,2}(X)</math>. However, ''i''<sub>*</sub> factors through the map from ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') to ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''C'''), and on ''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''C'''), ''i''<sub>*</sub> is the restriction of the projection onto ''H''<sup>0,2</sup>(''X''). It follows that it is zero on {{nowrap|''H''<sup>2</sup>(''X'', '''Z''') &cap; ''H''<sup>1,1</sup>(''X'')}}, and consequently that the cycle class map is surjective.<ref>{{Harvnb|Griffiths|Harris|1994|pp=163&ndash;164}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Griffiths | first1=Phillip | author1-link=Phillip Griffiths | last2=Harris | first2=Joseph | author2-link=Joe Harris (mathematician) | title=Principles of algebraic geometry | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=978-0-471-05059-9 |mr=1288523 | year=1994 | doi=10.1002/9781118032527}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Lefschetz | first1=Solomon | title=L'Analysis situs et la géométrie algébrique | publisher=Gauthier-Villars | language=French | series=Collection de Monographies publiée sous la Direction de M.

[[Andrew Wiles]] proved the modularity theorem for [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, which was enough to imply [[Fermat's last theorem]]. Later, [[Christophe Breuil]], [[Brian Conrad]], [[Fred Diamond]] and [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]] extended Wiles' techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001.\n\n==Statement==\nThe [[theorem]] states that any [[elliptic curve]] over '''Q''' can be obtained via a [[rational map]] with [[integer]] [[coefficient]]s from the [[classical modular curve]] <math>X_0(N)</math> for some integer ''N''; this is a curve with integer coefficients with an explicit definition. This mapping is called a modular parametrization of level ''N''.  If ''N'' is the smallest integer for which such a parametrization can be found (which by the modularity theorem itself is now known to be a number called the ''[[conductor of an elliptic curve|conductor]]''), then the parametrization may be defined in terms of a mapping generated by a particular kind of modular form of weight two and level ''N'', a normalized [[newform]] with integer ''q''-expansion, followed if need be by an [[Elliptic curve#Isogeny|isogeny]].\n\nThe modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement: to an elliptic curve ''E'' over '''Q''' we may attach a corresponding [[L-series of an elliptic curve|L-series]]. The ''L''-series is a [[Dirichlet series]], commonly written\n\n:<math>L(E, s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_n}{n^s}.</math>\n\nThe [[generating function]] of the coefficients <math>a_n</math> is then\n\n:<math>f(E, q) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n q^n.</math>\n\nIf we make the substitution\n\n:<math>q = e^{2 \\pi i \\tau}</math>\n\nwe see that we have written the [[Fourier series|Fourier expansion]] of a function <math>f(E, \\tau)</math> of the complex variable ''τ'', so the coefficients of the ''q''-series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of <math>f</math>. The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a [[cusp form]] of weight two and level ''N'' and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all [[Hecke operator]]s); this is the '''Hasse–Weil conjecture''', which follows from the modularity theorem.\n\nSome  modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to  [[holomorphic differential]]s for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible [[Abelian varieties]], corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher-dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is [[Elliptic curve#Isogeny|isogenous]] to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it).\n\n==History==\n{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Yutaka  Taniyama|last=Taniyama|first=Yutaka|year=1956}} stated a preliminary (slightly incorrect) version of the conjecture  at the 1955 international symposium on algebraic number theory in [[Tokyo]] and [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]].  [[Goro Shimura]] and Taniyama worked on improving its rigor until 1957.   {{harvs|txt|authorlink=André Weil|last=Weil|first=André|year= 1967}} rediscovered the conjecture, and showed that it would follow from the (conjectured) functional equations for some twisted L-series of the elliptic curve; this was the first serious evidence that the conjecture might be true.  Weil also showed that the conductor of the elliptic curve should be the level of the corresponding modular form. The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture became a part of the [[Langlands program]].\n\nThe conjecture attracted considerable interest when {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Gerhard Frey|last=Frey|first=Gerhard|year=1986}} suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. He did this by attempting to show that any counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would imply the existence of at least one non-modular elliptic curve. This argument was completed when {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre|last=Serre|first=Jean-Pierre|year=1987}} identified a missing link (now known as the [[epsilon conjecture]] or Ribet's theorem) in Frey's original work, followed two years later by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Ken Ribet|last=Ribet|first=Ken|year=1990}}'s completion of a proof of the epsilon conjecture.\n\nEven after gaining serious attention, the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult to prove or perhaps even inaccessible to proof {{harv|Singh|1997|pp=203–205, 223, 226}}. For example, Wiles' ex-supervisor [[John H. Coates|John Coates]] states that it seemed \"impossible to actually prove\", and Ken Ribet considered himself \"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\".\n\n{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Andrew Wiles|last=Wiles|year=1995}}, with some help from [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], proved  the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for all [[semistable elliptic curve]]s, which he used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and the full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by {{harvtxt|Diamond|1996}}, {{harvtxt|Conrad|Diamond|Taylor|1999}}, and {{harvtxt|Breuil|Conrad|Diamond|Taylor|2001}} who, building on Wiles' work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. \n{{further|Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem}}\n\nOnce fully proven, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.\n\nSeveral theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem follow from the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two [[coprime]] ''n''-th powers, ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3. (The case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;3 was already known by [[Euler]].)\n\n==Generalizations==\nThe modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to [[Robert Langlands]]. The [[Langlands program]] seeks to attach an [[automorphic form]] or [[automorphic representation]] (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a [[number field]].  Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved.
