      "text": "In mathematics, the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem, named after Élie Cartan and Jean Dieudonné, establishes that every orthogonal transformation in an n-dimensional symmetric bilinear space can be described as the composition of at most n reflections.\n\nThe notion of a symmetric bilinear space is a generalization of Euclidean space whose structure is defined by a symmetric bilinear form (which need not be positive definite, so is not necessarily an inner product – for instance, a pseudo-Euclidean space is also a symmetric bilinear space). The orthogonal transformations in the space are those automorphisms which preserve the value of the bilinear form between every pair of vectors; in Euclidean space, this corresponds to preserving distances and angles. These orthogonal transformations form a group under composition, the orthogonal group.\n\nFor example, in the two dimensional Euclidean plane, every orthogonal transformation is either a reflection across a line through the origin or a rotation about the origin (which can be written as the composition of two reflections). Any arbitrary composition of such rotations and reflections can be rewritten as a composition of no more than 2 reflections. Similarly, in three-dimensional Euclidean space, every orthogonal transformation can be described as a single reflection, a rotation (2 reflections), or an improper rotation (3 reflections). In four-dimensions, double rotations are added that represent 4 reflections.\n\n Formal statement \nLet  be an n-dimensional, non-degenerate symmetric bilinear space over a field with characteristic not equal to 2.

      "text": "In mathematics, the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem in invariant theory of finite groups states that the ring of invariants of a finite group acting on a complex vector space is a polynomial ring if and only if the group is generated by pseudoreflections. In the case of subgroups of the complex general linear group the theorem was first proved by  who gave a case-by-case proof.  soon afterwards gave a uniform proof. It has been extended to finite linear groups over an arbitrary field in the non-modular case by Jean-Pierre Serre.\n\n Statement of the theorem \n\nLet V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field K and let G be a finite subgroup of the general linear group GL(V). An element s of  GL(V) is called a pseudoreflection if it fixes a codimension 1 subspace of V and is not the identity transformation I, or equivalently, if the kernel Ker (s − I) has codimension one in V. Assume that the order of G is relatively prime to the characteristic of K (the so-called non-modular case). Then the following properties are equivalent:See, e.g.: Bourbaki, Lie, chap. V, §5, nº5, theorem 4 for equivalence of (A), (B) and (C); page 26 of  for equivalence of (A) and (B′); pages 6–18 of   for equivalence of (C) and (C′)  for a proof of (B′)⇒(A).\n\n (A) The group G is generated by pseudoreflections.\n (B) The algebra of invariants K[V]G is a (free) polynomial algebra.\n (B′) The algebra of invariants K[V]G is a regular ring.\n (C) The algebra K[V] is a free module over K[V]G.\n (C′) The algebra K[V] is a projective module over K[V]G.\n\nIn the case when the field K is the field C of complex numbers, the first condition is usually stated as \"G is a complex reflection group\". Shephard and Todd derived a full classification of such groups.\n\n Examples \n\n Let V be one-dimensional. Then any finite group faithfully acting on V is a subgroup of the multiplicative group of the field K, and hence a cyclic group. It follows that G consists of roots of unity of order dividing n, where n is its order, so G is generated by pseudoreflections. In this case, K[V] = K[x] is the polynomial ring in one variable and the algebra of invariants of G is the subalgebra generated by xn, hence it is a polynomial algebra.\n Let V = Kn be the standard n-dimensional vector space and G be the symmetric group Sn acting by permutations of the elements of the standard basis. The symmetric group is generated by transpositions (ij), which act by reflections on V. On the other hand, by the main theorem of symmetric functions, the algebra of invariants is the polynomial algebra generated by the elementary symmetric functions e1, … en.\n Let V = K2 and G be the cyclic group of order 2 acting by ±I. In this case, G is not generated by pseudoreflections, since the nonidentity element s of G acts without fixed points, so that dim Ker (s − I) = 0. On the other hand, the algebra of invariants is the subalgebra of K[V] = K[x, y] generated by the homogeneous elements x2, xy, and y2 of degree 2. This subalgebra is not a polynomial algebra because of the relation x2y2 = (xy)2.\n\nGeneralizations\n gave an extension of the Chevalley–Shephard–Todd theorem to positive characteristic.\n\nThere has been much work on the question of when a reductive algebraic group acting on a vector\nspace has a polynomial ring of invariants.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-subgroup_theorem",
      "text": "In mathematics, the closed-subgroup theorem (sometimes referred to as Cartan's theorem) is a theorem in the theory of Lie groups. It states that if  is a closed subgroup of a Lie group , then  is an embedded Lie group with the smooth structure (and hence the group topology) agreeing with the embedding. Theorem 20.10. Lee states and proves this theorem in all generality. Theorem 1, Section 2.7 Rossmann states the theorem for linear groups. The statement is that there is an open subset  such that  is an analytic bijection onto an open neighborhood of  in . For linear groups, Hall proves a similar result in Corollary 3.45.\nOne of several results known as Cartan's theorem, it was first published in 1930 by Élie Cartan, See § 26. who was inspired by John von Neumann's 1929 proof of a special case for groups of linear transformations.; .\n\n Overview\nLet  be a Lie group with Lie algebra . Now let  be an arbitrary closed subgroup of . Our goal is to show that  is a smooth embedded submanifold of . Our first step is to identify something that could be the Lie algebra of , that is, the tangent space of  at the identity. The challenge is that  is not assumed to have any smoothness and therefore it is not clear how one may define its tangent space. To proceed, we define the \"Lie algebra\"  of  by the formula\n\nIt is not difficult to show that  is a Lie subalgebra of . Theorem 3.20 In particular,  is a subspace of , which we might hope could be the tangent space of  at the identity. For this idea to work, however, we need to know that  is big enough to capture some interesting information about . If, for example,  were some large subgroup of  but  turned out to be zero,  would not be helpful to us.\n\nThe key step, then, is to show that  actually captures all the elements of  that are sufficiently close to the identity. That is to say, we need to show that the following critical lemma holds:\nLemma: Take a small neighborhood  of the origin in  such that the exponential map sends  diffeomorphically onto some neighborhood  of the identity in , and let  be the inverse of the exponential map. Then there is some smaller neighborhood  such that if  belongs to , then  belongs to . Theorem 3.42 \n\nOnce this has been established, one can use exponential coordinates on , that is, writing each  (not necessarily in ) as  for . In these coordinates, the lemma says that  corresponds to a point in  precisely if  belongs to . That is to say, in exponential coordinates near the identity,  looks like . Since  is just a subspace of , this means that  is just like , with  and . Thus, we have exhibited a \"slice coordinate system\" in which  looks locally like , which is the condition for an embedded submanifold. Chapter 5\n\nIt is worth noting that Rossmann shows that for any subgroup  of  (not necessarily closed), the Lie algebra  of  is a Lie subalgebra of . Chapter 2, Proposition 1 and Corollary 7 Rossmann then goes on to introduce coordinates Section 2.3 on  that make the identity component of  into a Lie group. It is important to note, however, that the topology on  coming from these coordinates is not the subset topology. That it so say, the identity component of  is an immersed submanifold of  but not an embedded submanifold.\n\nIn particular, the lemma stated above does not hold if  is not closed.\n\nExample of a non-closed subgroup\nthumb|193px|right|The torus . Imagine a bent helix laid out on the surface picturing . If  in lowest terms, the helix will close up on itself at  after  rotations in  and q rotations in . If  is irrational, the helix winds indefinitely.\nFor an example of a subgroup that is not an embedded Lie subgroup, consider the torus and an \"irrational winding of the torus\".\n\nand its subgroup\n\nwith  irrational. Then  is dense in  and hence not closed. Example 7.3 In the relative topology, a small open subset of  is composed of infinitely many almost parallel line segments on the surface of the torus. This means that  is not locally path connected. In the group topology, the small open sets are single line segments on the surface of the torus and  is locally path connected.\n\nThe example shows that for some groups  one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood  in the relative topology  of the identity that are exponentials of elements of , yet they cannot be connected to the identity with a path staying in . See comment to Corollary 5, Section 2.2. The group  is not a Lie group. While the map  is an analytic bijection, its inverse is not continuous. That is, if  corresponds to a small open interval , there is no open  with  due to the appearance of the sets . However, with the group topology ,  is a Lie group. With this topology the injection  is an analytic injective immersion, but not a homeomorphism, hence not an embedding. There are also examples of groups  for which one can find points in an arbitrarily small neighborhood (in the relative topology) of the identity that are not exponentials of elements of . For closed subgroups this is not the case as the proof below of the theorem shows.\n\n Applications \n\nBecause of the conclusion of the theorem, some authors chose to define linear Lie groups or matrix Lie groups as closed subgroups of  or .E.g. . See definition in Chapter 1. In this setting, one proves that every element of the group sufficiently close to the identity is the exponential of an element of the Lie algebra. Theorem 3.42 (The proof is practically identical to the proof of the closed subgroup theorem presented below.) It follows every closed subgroup is an embedded submanifold of  Corollary 3.45\n\nThe homogeneous space construction theorem states\nIf  is a closed Lie subgroup, then , the left coset space, has a unique real-analytic manifold structure such that the quotient map  is an analytic submersion. The left action given by  turns  into a homogeneous -space.\n\nThe closed subgroup theorem now simplifies the hypotheses considerably, a priori widening the class of homogeneous spaces. Every closed subgroup yields a homogeneous space.\n\nIn a similar way, the closed subgroup theorem simplifies the hypothesis in the following theorem.\nIf  is a set with transitive group action and the isotropy group or stabilizer of a point  is a closed Lie subgroup, then  has a unique smooth manifold structure such that the action is smooth.\n\nConditions for being closed\nA few sufficient conditions for  being closed, hence an embedded Lie group, is given below.\nAll classical groups are closed in , where , or , the quaternions.\nA subgroup that is locally closed is closed. Problem 1. Section 2.7 A subgroup is locally closed if every point has a neighborhood in  such that  is closed in .\nIf }, where  is a compact group and  is a closed set, then  is closed. Problem 3. Section 2.7\nIf  is a Lie subalgebra such that for no , then , the group generated by , is closed in . Problem 4. Section 2.7\nIf , then the one-parameter subgroup generated by  is not closed if and only if  is similar over  to a diagonal matrix with two entries of irrational ratio. Problem 5. Section 2.7\nLet  be a Lie subalgebra. If there is a simply connected compact group K with  isomorphic to , then  is closed in .  The result follows from Theorem 5.6\nIf G is simply connected and  is an ideal, then the connected Lie subgroup with Lie algebra  is closed.  Exercise 14 in Chapter 3\n\n Converse \n\nAn embedded Lie subgroup  is closed Corollary 15.30. so a subgroup is an embedded Lie subgroup if and only if it is closed. Equivalently,  is an embedded Lie subgroup if and only if its group topology equals its relative topology. Problem 2. Section 2.7.\n\n Proof \n\n193px|thumb|right|John von Neumann in 1929 proved the theorem in the case of matrix groups as given here. He was prominent in many areas, including quantum mechanics, set theory and the foundations of mathematics.\nThe proof is given for matrix groups with  for concreteness and relative simplicity, since matrices and their exponential mapping are easier concepts than in the general case. Historically, this case was proven first, by John von Neumann in 1929, and inspired Cartan to prove the full closed subgroup theorem in 1930. The proof for general  is formally identical,See for instance  Chapter 21 except that elements of the Lie algebra are left invariant vector fields on  and the exponential mapping is the time one flow of the vector field. If  with  closed in , then  is closed in , so the specialization to  instead of arbitrary  matters little.\n\nProof of the key lemma\nWe begin by establishing the key lemma stated in the \"overview\" section above.\n\nEndow  with the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product , and let  be the Lie algebra of  defined as }. Let }, the orthogonal complement of . Then  decomposes as the direct sum , so each  is uniquely expressed as  with .\n\nDefine a map  by . Expand the exponentials,\n\nand the pushforward or differential at ,  is seen to be , i.e. , the identity. The hypothesis of the inverse function theorem is satisfied with  analytic, and thus there are open sets  with  and  such that  is a real-analytic bijection from  to  with analytic inverse. It remains to show that  and  contain open sets  and  such that the conclusion of the theorem holds.\n\nConsider a countable neighborhood basis  at , linearly ordered by reverse inclusion with .For this one can choose open balls,  for some  large enough  such that . Here the metric obtained from the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product is used. Suppose for the purpose of obtaining a contradiction that for all ,  contains an element  that is not on the form . Then, since  is a bijection on the , there is a unique sequence , with  and  such that  converging to  because  is a neighborhood basis, with . Since  and ,  as well.\n\nNormalize the sequence in , . It takes its values in the unit sphere in  and since it is compact, there is a convergent subsequence converging to . By problem 17G, s is sequentially compact, meaning every sequence has a convergent subsequence. The index  henceforth refers to this subsequence. It will be shown that . Fix  and choose a sequence  of integers such that  as . For example,  such that  will do, as  → 0. Then\n\nSince  is a group, the left hand side is in  for all . Since  is closed, , Corollary 10.5. hence . This is a contradiction. Hence, for some  the sets  and  satisfy  and the exponential restricted to the open set  is in analytic bijection with the open set . This proves the lemma.\n\nProof of the theorem\nFor , the image in  of  under  form a neighborhood basis at . This is, by the way it is constructed, a neighborhood basis both in the group topology and the relative topology. Since multiplication in  is analytic, the left and right translates of this neighborhood basis by a group element  gives a neighborhood basis at . These bases restricted to  gives neighborhood bases at all . The topology generated by these bases is the relative topology. The conclusion is that the relative topology is the same as the group topology.\n\nNext, construct coordinate charts on . First define . This is an analytic bijection with analytic inverse. Furthermore, if , then . By fixing a basis for  and identifying  with , then in these coordinates , where  is the dimension of . This shows that  is a slice chart. By translating the charts obtained from the countable neighborhood basis used above one obtains slice charts around every point in . This shows that  is an embedded submanifold of .\n\nMoreover, multiplication , and inversion  in  are analytic since these operations are analytic in  and restriction to a submanifold  (embedded or immersed) with the relative topology again yield analytic operations  and .

      "text": "In the branch of abstract algebra called ring theory, the double centralizer theorem can refer to any one of several similar results. These results concern the centralizer of a subring S of a ring R, denoted CR(S) in this article. It is always the case that CR(CR(S)) contains S, and a double centralizer theorem gives conditions on R and S that guarantee that CR(CR(S)) is equal to S.\n\nStatements of the theorem\n\nMotivation\nThe centralizer of a subring S of R given by\n\nClearly CR(CR(S)) ⊇ S, but it is not always the case that one can say the two sets are equal. The double centralizer theorems give conditions under which one can conclude that equality occurs.\n\nThere is another special case of interest. Let M be a right R module and give M the natural left E-module structure, where E is End(M), the ring of endomorphisms of the abelian group M. Every map mr given by mr(x) = xr creates an additive endomorphism of M, that is, an element of E. The map r → mr is a ring homomorphism of R into the ring E, and we denote the image of R inside of E by RM. It can be checked that the kernel of this canonical map is the annihilator Ann(MR). Therefore, by an isomorphism theorem for rings, RM is isomorphic to the quotient ring R/Ann(MR). Clearly when M is a faithful module, R and RM are isomorphic rings.\n\nSo now E is a ring with RM as a subring, and CE(RM) may be formed. By definition one can check that CE(RM) = End(MR), the ring of R module endomorphisms of M. Thus if it occurs that CE(CE(RM)) = RM, this is the same thing as saying CE(End(MR)) = RM.\n\nCentral simple algebras\nPerhaps the most common version is the version for central simple algebras, as it appears in :\n\nTheorem: If A is a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over a field F and B is a simple subalgebra of A, then CA(CA(B)) = B, and moreover the dimensions satisfy\n\nArtinian rings\nThe following generalized version for Artinian rings (which include finite-dimensional algebras) appears in . Given a simple R module UR, we will borrow notation from the above motivation section including RU and E=End(U).

Then\n.\n\nRemarks\n In this version, the rings are chosen with the intent of proving the Jacobson density theorem. Notice that it only concludes that a particular subring has the centralizer property, in contrast to the central simple algebra version.\n Since algebras are normally defined over commutative rings, and all the involved rings above may be noncommutative, it's clear that algebras are not necessarily involved.\n If U is additionally a faithful module, so that R is a right primitive ring, then RU is ring isomorphic to R.\n\nPolynomial identity rings\nIn , a version is given for polynomial identity rings. The notation Z(R) will be used to denote the center of a ring R.\n\nTheorem: If R is a simple polynomial identity ring, and A is a simple Z(R) subalgebra of R, then CR(CR(A)) = A.\n\nRemarks\n This version can be considered to be \"between\" the central simple algebra version and the Artinian ring version.

      "text": "In mathematics, the Eckmann–Hilton argument (or Eckmann–Hilton principle or Eckmann–Hilton theorem) is an argument about two monoid structures on a set where one is a homomorphism for the other. Given this, the structures can be shown to coincide, and the resulting monoid demonstrated to be commutative. This can then be used to prove the commutativity of the higher homotopy groups. The principle is named after Beno Eckmann and Peter Hilton, who used it in a 1962 paper.\n\nThe Eckmann–Hilton result\nLet  be a set equipped with two binary operations, which we will write  and , and suppose:\n\n  and  are both unital.\n  for all  .\n\nThen  and  are the same and in fact commutative and associative.\n\nRemarks\nThe operations  and  are often referred to as multiplications, but this might imply they are associative, a property which is not required for the proof. In fact, associativity follows. Likewise, we do not have to require that the two operations have the same neutral element; this is a consequence.\n\nProof\nFirst, observe that the units of the two operations coincide:\n.\n \nNow, let .\nThen . This establishes that the two operations coincide and are commutative.\n\nFor associativity, .\n\n Remarks \nIf the operations are associative, each one defines the structure of a monoid on , and the conditions above are equivalent to the more abstract condition that  is a monoid homomorphism  (or vice versa). An even more abstract way of stating the theorem is: If  is a monoid object in the category of monoids, then  is in fact a commutative monoid.\n\nIt is important that a similar argument does NOT give such a triviality result in the case of monoid objects in the categories of small categories or of groupoids. Instead the notion of group object in the category of groupoids turns out to be equivalent to the notion of crossed module. This leads to the idea of using multiple groupoid objects in homotopy theory. \n\nMore generally, the Eckmann–Hilton argument is a special case of the use of the interchange law in the theory of (strict) double and multiple categories. A (strict) double category is a set, or class, equipped with two category structures, each of which is a morphism for the other structure. If the compositions in the two category structures are written  then the interchange law reads \n\nwhenever both sides are defined. For an example of its use, and some discussion, see the paper of Higgins referenced below. The interchange law implies that a double category contains a family of abelian monoids. \n\nThe history in relation to homotopy groups is interesting. The workers in topology of the early 20th century were aware that the nonabelian fundamental group was of use in geometry and analysis; that abelian homology groups could be defined in all dimensions; and that for a connected space, the first homology group was the fundamental group made abelian. So there was a desire to generalise the nonabelian fundamental group to all dimensions. \n\nIn 1932, Eduard Čech submitted a paper on higher homotopy groups to the International Congress of Mathematics at Zurich. However, Pavel Alexandroff and Heinz Hopf quickly proved these groups were abelian for , and on these grounds persuaded Cech to withdraw his paper, so that only a small paragraph appeared in the Proceedings. It is said that Witold Hurewicz attended this conference, and his first work on higher homotopy groups appeared in 1935. Thus the dreams of the early topologists have long been regarded as a mirage. \n\nCubical higher homotopy groupoids are constructed  for filtered spaces in the book Nonabelian algebraic topology cited below, which develops basic algebraic topology, including higher analogues to the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, without using singular homology or simplicial approximation.\n\nReferences\nJohn Baez: Eckmann–Hilton principle (week 89)\nJohn Baez: Eckmann–Hilton principle (week 100)\n.\n .\n.\n.\n\n Murray Bremner and  Sara Madariaga.

In fact, Ap2 ⊆ Bq2 is a faithfully flat extension of rings since the inclusion map Ap2 → Bq2 is a local homomorphism. Therefore, the induced map on spectra Spec(Bq2) → Spec(Ap2) is surjective and there exists a prime ideal of Bq2 that contracts to the prime ideal p1Ap2 of Ap2.

What is now termed a right Goldie ring is a ring R that has finite uniform dimension (=\"finite rank\") as a right module over itself, and satisfies the ascending chain condition on right annihilators of subsets of R. \n\nGoldie's theorem states that the semiprime right Goldie rings are precisely those that have a semisimple Artinian right classical ring of quotients.  The structure of this ring of quotients is then completely determined by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem.\n\nIn particular, Goldie's theorem applies to semiprime right Noetherian rings, since by definition right Noetherian rings have the ascending chain condition on all right ideals. This is sufficient to guarantee that a right-Noetherian ring is right Goldie.  The converse does not hold: every right Ore domain is a right Goldie domain, and hence so is every commutative integral domain.\n\nA consequence of Goldie's theorem, again due to Goldie, is that every semiprime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a finite direct sum of prime principal right ideal rings.  Every prime principal right ideal ring is isomorphic to a matrix ring over a right Ore domain.\n\nSketch of the proof\nThis is a sketch of the characterization mentioned in the introduction.

Also from the previous observations, Qr is a semisimple ring. Thus R is a right order in Qr.\n If R is a right order in a semisimple ring Q, then it is semiprime right Goldie:\nAny right order in a Noetherian ring (such as Q) is right Goldie.\nAny right order in a Noetherian semiprime ring (such as Q) is itself semiprime.\nThus, R is semiprime right Goldie.\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n PlanetMath page on Goldie's theorem\n PlanetMath page on Goldie ring\n\nCategory:Ring theory\nCategory:Theorems in abstract algebra"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_syzygy_theorem",
      "text": "In mathematics, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is one of the three fundamental theorems about polynomial rings over fields, first proved by David Hilbert in 1890, which were introduced for solving important open questions in invariant theory, and are at the basis of modern algebraic geometry. The two other theorems are Hilbert's basis theorem that asserts that all ideals of polynomial rings over a field are finitely generated, and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which establishes a bijective correspondence between affine algebraic varieties and prime ideals of polynomial rings.\n\nHilbert's syzygy theorem concern the relations, or  syzygies in Hilbert's terminology, between the generators of an ideal, or, more generally, a module. As the relations form a module, one may consider the relations between the relations; Hilbert's syzygy theorem asserts that, if one continues in this way, starting with a module over a polynomial ring in  indeterminates over a field, one eventually finds a zero module of relations, after at most  steps.\n\nHilbert's syzygy theorem is now considered to be an early result of homological algebra. It is the starting point of the use of homological methods in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.\n\nHistory\nThe syzygy theorem first appeared in Hilbert's seminal paper \"Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen\" (1890).D. Hilbert, Über die Theorie der algebraischen Formen, Mathematische Annalen 36, 473–530. The paper is split into five parts: part I proves Hilbert's basis theorem over a field, while part II proves it over the integers. Part III contains the syzygy theorem (Theorem III), which is used in part IV to discuss the Hilbert polynomial. The last part, part V, proves finite generation of certain rings of invariants. Incidentally part III also contains a special case of the Hilbert–Burch theorem.\n\nSyzygies (relations)\nOriginally, Hilbert defined syzygies for ideals in polynomial rings, but the concept generalizes trivially to (left) modules over any ring.\n\nGiven a generating set  of a module  over a ring , a relation or first syzygy between the generators is a -tuple  of elements of  such thatThe theory is presented for finitely generated modules, but extends easily to arbitrary modules.\n\nLet  be the free module with basis  the relation  may be identified with the element \n\nand the relations form the kernel  of the linear map  defined by  In other words, one has an exact sequence\n\nThis first syzygy module  depends on the choice of a generating set, but, if  is the module which is obtained with another generating set, there exist two free modules  and  such that \n\nwhere  denote the direct sum of modules.\n\nThe second syzygy module is the module of the relations between generators of the first syzygy module. By continuing in this way, one may define the th syzygy module for every positive integer .\n\nIf the th syzygy module is free for some , then by taking a basis as a generating set, the next syzygy module (and every subsequent one) is the zero module. If one does not take a bases as generating sets, then all subsequent syzygy modules are free.\n\nLet  be the smallest integer, if any, such that the th syzygy module of a module  is free or projective. The above property of invariance, up to the sum direct with free modules, implies that  does not depend on the choice of generating sets. The projective dimension of  is this integer, if it exists, or  if not. This is equivalent with the existence of an exact sequence\n\nwhere the modules  are free and  is projective. It can be shown that one may always choose the generating sets for  being free, that is for the above exact sequence to be a free resolution.\n\n Statement \nHilbert's syzygy theorem states that, if  is a finitely generated module over a polynomial ring  in  indeterminates over a field , then the th syzygy module of  is always a free module.\n\nIn modern language, this implies that the projective dimension of  is at most , and thus that there exists a free resolution \n\nof length .\n\nThis upper bound on the projective dimension is sharp, that is, there are modules of projective dimension exactly . The standard example is the field , which may be considered as a -module by setting  for every  and every . For this module, the th syzygy module is free, but not the th one (for a proof, see , below).\n\nThe theorem is also true for modules that are not finitely generated. As the global dimension of a ring is the supremum of the projective dimensions of all modules, Hilbert's syzygy theorem may be restated as: the global dimension of  is .\n\n Low dimension \n\nIn the case of zero indeterminates, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is simply the fact that every vector space has a basis.\n\nIn the case of a single indeterminate, Hilbert's syzygy theorem is an instance of the theorem asserting that over a principal ideal ring, every submodule of a free module is itself free.\n\n Koszul complex \n\nThe Koszul complex, also called \"complex of exterior algebra\", allows, in some cases, an explicit description of all syzygy modules.\n\nLet  be a generating system of an ideal  in a polynomial ring , and let  be a free module of basis  The exterior algebra of  is the direct sum\n\nwhere  is the free module, which has, as a basis, the exterior products\n\nsuch that  In particular, one has  (because of the definition of the empty product), the two definitions of  coincide, and  for . For every positive , one may define a linear map  by\n\nwhere the hat means that the factor is omitted. A straightforward computation shows that the composition of two consecutive such maps is zero, and thus that one has a complex\n\nThis is the Koszul complex. In general the Koszul complex is not an exact sequence, but it is an exact sequence if one works with a polynomial ring  and an ideal generated by a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.\n\nIn particular, the sequence  is regular, and the Koszul complex is thus a projective resolution of  In this case, the th syzygy module is free of dimension one (generated by the product of all ); the th syzygy module is thus the quotient of a free module of dimension  by the submodule generated by  This quotient may not be a projective module, as otherwise, there would exist polynomials  such that  which is impossible (substituting the  by 0 in the latter equality provides ). This proves that the projective dimension of  is exactly .\n\nThe same proof applies for proving that the projective dimension of  is exactly  if the  form a regular sequence of homogeneous polynomials.\n\nComputation\nAt Hilbert's time, there were no method available for computing syzygies. It was only known that an algorithm may be deduced from any upper bound of the degree of the generators of the module of syzygies. In fact, the coefficients of the syzygies are unknown polynomials. If the degree of these polynomials is bounded, the number of their monomials is also bounded.  Expressing that one has a syzygy provides a system of linear equations whose unknowns are the coefficients of these monomials. Therefore, any algorithm for linear systems implies an algorithm for syzygies, as soon as a bound of the degrees is known.\n\nThe first bound for syzygies (as well as for ideal membership problem) was given in 1926 by Grete Hermann:Grete Hermann: Die Frage der endlich vielen Schritte in der Theorie der Polynomideale. Unter Benutzung nachgelassener Sätze von K. Hentzelt, Mathematische Annalen, Volume 95, Number 1, 736-788,  (abstract in German language) — The question of finitely many steps in polynomial ideal theory (review and English-language translation) Let  a submodule of a free module  of dimension  over  if the coefficients over a basis of  of a generating system of  have a total degree at most , then there is a constant  such that the degrees occurring in a generating system of the first syzygy module is at most  The same bound applies for testing the membership to  of an element of .G. Hermann claimed , but did not prove this.\n\nOn the other hand, there are examples where a double exponential degree necessarily occurs. However such examples are extremely rare, and this sets the question of an algorithm that is efficient when the output is not too large. At the present time, the best algorithms for computing syzygies are Gröbner basis algorithms. They allow the computation of the first syzygy module, and also, with almost no extra cost, all syzygies modules.\n\nSyzygies and regularity\nOne might wonder which ring-theoretic property of  causes the Hilbert syzygy theorem to hold. It turns out that \nthis is regularity, which is an algebraic formulation of the fact that affine -space is a variety without singularities.

      "text": "In the branch of abstract algebra called ring theory, the Akizuki–Hopkins–Levitzki theorem connects the descending chain condition and ascending chain condition in modules over semiprimary rings.  A ring R (with 1) is called semiprimary if R/J(R) is semisimple and J(R) is a nilpotent ideal, where J(R) denotes the Jacobson radical.  The theorem states that if R is a semiprimary ring and M is an R module, the three module conditions Noetherian, Artinian and \"has a composition series\" are equivalent.  Without the semiprimary condition, the only true implication is that if M has a composition series, then M is both Noetherian and Artinian.\n\nThe theorem takes its current form from a paper by Charles Hopkins and a paper by Jacob Levitzki, both in 1939.  For this reason it is often cited as the Hopkins–Levitzki theorem.  However Yasuo Akizuki is sometimes included since he proved the result for commutative rings a few years earlier .\n\nSince it is known that right Artinian rings are semiprimary, a direct corollary of the theorem is: a right Artinian ring is also right Noetherian. The analogous statement for left Artinian rings holds as well. This is not true in general for Artinian modules, because there are examples of Artinian modules which are not Noetherian.   \n   \nAnother direct corollary is that if R is right Artinian, then R is left Artinian if and only if it is left Noetherian.\n\n Sketch of proof \nHere is the proof of the following: Let R be a semiprimary ring and M a left R-module. If M is either Artinian or Noetherian, then M has a composition series. (The converse of this is true over any ring.)\n\nLet J be the radical of R. Set . The R module  may then be viewed as an -module because J is contained in the annihilator of . Each  is a semisimple -module, because  is a semisimple ring. Furthermore, since J is nilpotent, only finitely many of the  are nonzero. If M is Artinian (or Noetherian), then  has a finite composition series.  Stacking the composition series from the  end to end, we obtain a composition series for M.\n\nIn Grothendieck categories\nSeveral generalizations and extensions of the theorem exist. One concerns Grothendieck categories: If G is a Grothendieck category with an artinian generator, then every artinian object in G is noetherian.\n\n See also \n Artinian module\n Noetherian module\n Composition series\n\nReferences\n\n Charles Hopkins (1939) Rings with minimal condition for left ideals, Ann. of Math.

      "text": "In mathematics, Hurwitz's theorem is a theorem of Adolf Hurwitz (1859–1919), published posthumously in 1923, solving the Hurwitz problem for finite-dimensional unital real non-associative algebras endowed with a positive-definite quadratic form. The theorem states that if the quadratic form defines a homomorphism into the positive real numbers on the non-zero part of the algebra, then the algebra must be isomorphic to the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions, or the octonions. Such algebras, sometimes called Hurwitz algebras, are examples of composition algebras.\n\nThe theory of composition algebras has subsequently been generalized to arbitrary quadratic forms and arbitrary fields.See: Hurwitz's theorem implies that multiplicative formulas for sums of squares can only occur in 1, 2, 4 and 8 dimensions, a result originally proved by Hurwitz in 1898. It is a special case of the Hurwitz problem, solved also in . Subsequent proofs of the restrictions on the dimension have been given by  using the representation theory of finite groups and by   and  using Clifford algebras. Hurwitz's theorem has been applied in algebraic topology to problems on vector fields on spheres and the homotopy groups of the classical groupsSee: and in quantum mechanics to the classification of simple Jordan algebras.\n\nEuclidean Hurwitz algebras\n\nDefinition\nA Hurwitz algebra or composition algebra is a finite-dimensional not necessarily associative algebra  with identity endowed with a nondegenerate quadratic form  such that . If the underlying coefficient field is the reals and  is positive-definite, so that  is an inner product, then  is called a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra.\n\nIf  is a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and  is in , define the involution and right and left multiplication operators by\n\nEvidently the involution has period two and preserves the inner product and norm. These operators have the following properties:\n\n the involution is an antiautomorphism, i.e. \n \n , , so that the involution on the algebra corresponds to taking adjoints\n  if \n \n , , so that  is an alternative algebra.\n\nThese properties are proved starting from the polarized version of the identity :\n\nSetting  or  yields  and .\n\nHence .\n\nSimilarly .\n\nHence , so that .\n\nBy the polarized identity  so . Applied to 1 this gives . Replacing  by  gives the other identity.\n\nSubstituting the formula for  in  gives .\n\nClassification\nIt is routine to check that the real numbers , the complex numbers  and the quaternions  are examples of associative Euclidean Hurwitz algebras with their standard norms and involutions. There are moreover natural inclusions .\n\nAnalysing such an inclusion leads to the Cayley–Dickson construction, formalized by A.A. Albert. Let  be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and  a proper unital subalgebra, so a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra in its own right. Pick a unit vector  in  orthogonal to . Since , it follows that  and hence . Let  be subalgebra generated by  and . It is unital and is again a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra. It satisfies the following Cayley–Dickson multiplication laws:\n\nTo check this note that  and  are orthogonal, since  is orthogonal to . If  is in , then , since by orthogonal . The formula for the involution follows. To show that  is closed under multiplication note that . Since  is orthogonal to 1, .\n\n  since  so that, for  in , .\n  taking adjoints above.\n  since  = 0, so that, for  in , .\n\nImposing the multiplicativity of the norm on  for  and  gives:\n\nwhich leads to\n\nHence , so that  must be associative.\n\nThis analysis applies to the inclusion of  in  and  in . Taking  with the product and inner product above gives a noncommutative nonassociative algebra generated by . This recovers the usual definition of the octonions or Cayley numbers. If  is a Euclidean algebra, it must contain . If it is strictly larger than , the argument above shows that it contains . If it is larger than , it contains . If it is larger still, it must contain . But there the process must stop, because  is not associative. In fact  is not commutative and  in .\n\n The only Euclidean Hurwitz algebras are the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions.\n\nOther proofs\nThe proofs of  and  use Clifford algebras to show that the dimension  of  must be 1, 2, 4 or 8. In fact the operators  with  satisfy  and so form a real Clifford algebra. If  is a unit vector, then  is skew-adjoint with square . So  must be even.  The real Clifford algebra and its complexification act on the complexification of , an -dimensional complex space. Since  is even,  is odd, so the Clifford algebra has exactly two complex irreducible representations of dimension . So this power of 2 must divide . It is easy to see that this implies  can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8.\n\nThe proof of  uses the representation theory of finite groups, or the projective representation theory of elementary Abelian 2-groups, known to be equivalent to the representation theory of real Clifford algebras. Indeed, taking an orthonormal basis  of the orthogonal complement of 1 gives rise to operators \nsatisfying\n\nThis is a projective representation of a direct product of  groups of order 2. ( is assumed to be greater than 1.) The operators  by construction are skew-symmetric and orthogonal. In fact Eckmann constructed operators of this type in a slightly different but equivalent way. It is in fact the method originally followed in .See: Assume that there is a composition law for two forms\n\nwhere  is bilinear in  and . Thus\n\nwhere the matrix  is linear in . The relations above are equivalent to\n\nWriting\n\nthe relations become\n\nNow set . Thus  and the  are skew-adjoint, orthogonal satisfying exactly the same relations as the 's:\n\nSince  is an orthogonal matrix with square  on a real vector space,  is even.\n\nLet  be the finite group generated by elements  such that\n\nwhere  is central of order 2. The commutator subgroup  is just formed of 1 and . If  is odd this coincides with the center while if  is even the center has order 4 with extra elements  and . If  in  is not in the center its conjugacy class is exactly  and . Thus there are\n conjugacy classes for  odd and  for  even.  has  1-dimensional complex representations. The total number of irreducible complex representations is the number of conjugacy classes. So since  is even, there are two further irreducible complex representations. Since the sum of the squares of the dimensions equals  and the dimensions divide , the two irreducibles must have dimension . When  is even, there are two and their dimension must divide the order of the group, so is a power of two, so they must both have dimension . The space on which the 's act can be complexified. It will have complex dimension . It breaks up into some of complex irreducible representations of , all having dimension . In particular this dimension is , so  is less than or equal to 8. If , the dimension is 4, which does not divide 6. So N can only be 1, 2, 4 or 8.\n\nApplications to Jordan algebras\nLet  be a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra and let  be the algebra of -by- matrices over . It is a unital nonassociative algebra with an involution given by\n\nThe trace  is defined as the sum of the diagonal elements of  and the real-valued trace by\n. The real-valued trace satisfies:\n\nThese are immediate consequences of the known identities for .\n\nIn  define the associator by\n\nIt is trilinear and vanishes identically if  is associative. Since  is an alternating algebra\n and . Polarizing it follows that the associator is antisymmetric in its three entries. Note also that ,  or  lie in  then the . This implies that  has certain commutation properties. In fact if  is a matrix in  with real entries on the diagonal then\n\nwith  in . In fact if , then\n\nSince the diagonal entries of  are real, the off diagonal entries of  vanish. Each diagonal\nentry of  is a sum of two associators involving only off diagonal terms of . Since the associators are invariant under cyclic permutations, the diagonal entries of  are all equal.\n\nLet  be the space of self-adjoint elements in  with product  and inner product .\n\n  is a Euclidean Jordan algebra if  is associative (the real numbers, complex numbers or quaternions) and  or if  is nonassociative (the octonions) and .\n\nThe exceptional Jordan algebra  is called the Albert algebra after A.A. Albert.\n\nTo check that  satisfies the axioms for a Euclidean Jordan algebra, note that the real trace defines a symmetric bilinear form with . So it is an inner product. It satisfies the associativity property  because of the properties of the real trace. The main axiom to check is the Jordan condition for the operators  defined by :\n\nThis is easy to check when  is associative, since  is an associative algebra so a Jordan algebra with . When  and  a special argument is required, one of the shortest being due to .See:\n\nIn fact if  is in  with , then\n\ndefines a skew-adjoint derivation of . Indeed,\n\n \n\nso that\n\nPolarizing yields:\n\nSetting , shows that  is skew-adjoint. The derivation property  follows by this and the associativity property of the inner product in the identity above.\n\nWith  and  as in the statement of the theorem, let  be the group of automorphisms of  leaving invariant the inner product. It is a closed subgroup of  so a compact Lie group. Its Lie algebra consists of skew-adjoint derivations.  showed that given  in  there is an automorphism  in  such that  is a diagonal matrix. (By self-adjointness the diagonal entries will be real.) Freudenthal's diagonalization theorem immediately implies the Jordan condition, since Jordan products by real diagonal matrices commute on  for any non-associative algebra .\n\nTo prove the diagonalization theorem, take  in . By compactness  can be chosen in  minimizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the off-diagonal terms of . Since  preserves the sums of all the squares, this is equivalent to maximizing the sums of the squares of the norms of the diagonal terms of . Replacing  by , it can be assumed that the maximum is attained at . Since the symmetric group , acting by permuting the coordinates, lies in , if  is not diagonal, it can be supposed that  and its adjoint  are non-zero. Let  be the skew-adjoint matrix with  entry ,  entry  and 0 elsewhere and let  be the derivation ad  of . Let  in . Then only the first two diagonal entries in  differ from those of . The diagonal entries are real. The derivative of  at  is the  coordinate of , i.e. . This derivative is non-zero if . On the other hand, the group  preserves the real-valued trace. Since it can only change  and , it preserves their sum. However, on the line constant,  has no local maximum (only a global minimum), a contradiction. Hence  must be diagonal.\n\nSee also\n\n Multiplicative quadratic form\n Radon–Hurwitz number\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n\n (reprint of 1951 article)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\nFurther reading\n\n \n\n Max Koecher & Reinhold Remmert (1990) \"Composition Algebras.

If  is a non-zero element of ,  (where  is the cyclic submodule of  generated by ). Therefore, if  are non-zero elements of , there is an element of  that induces an endomorphism of  transforming  to . The natural question now is whether this can be generalized to arbitrary (finite) tuples of elements. More precisely, find necessary and sufficient conditions on the tuple  and  separately, so that there is an element of  with the property that  for all . If  is the set of all -module endomorphisms of , then Schur's lemma asserts that  is a division ring, and the Jacobson density theorem answers the question on tuples in the affirmative, provided that the  are linearly independent over .\n\nWith the above in mind, the theorem may be stated this way:\n\nThe Jacobson Density Theorem. Let  be a simple right -module, , and  a finite and -linearly independent set. If  is a -linear transformation on  then there exists  such that  for all  in .Isaacs, Theorem 13.14, p. 185\n\nProof\nIn the Jacobson density theorem, the right -module  is simultaneously viewed as a left -module where , in the natural way: . It can be verified that this is indeed a left module structure on .Incidentally it is also a  bimodule structure. As noted before, Schur's lemma proves  is a division ring if  is simple, and so  is a vector space over .\n\nThe proof also relies on the following theorem proven in  p. 185:\n\nTheorem. Let  be a simple right -module, , and  a finite set. Write  for the annihilator of  in . Let  be in  with .

Write . It is easily seen that  is a submodule of . If , then the previous theorem implies that  would be in the -span of , contradicting the -linear independence of , therefore . Since  is simple, we have: . Since , there exists  in  such that .\n\nDefine  and observe that for all  in  we have:\n\nNow we do the same calculation for :\n\nTherefore,  for all  in , as desired. This completes the inductive step of the proof. It follows now from mathematical induction that the theorem is true for finite sets  of any size.\n\nTopological characterization\nA ring  is said to act densely on a simple right -module  if it satisfies the conclusion of the Jacobson density theorem.Herstein, Definition, p. 40 There is a topological reason for describing  as \"dense\". Firstly,  can be identified with a subring of  by identifying each element of  with the  linear transformation it induces by right multiplication. If  is given the discrete topology, and if  is given the product topology, and  is viewed as a subspace of  and is given the subspace topology, then  acts densely on  if and only if  is dense set in  with this topology.It turns out this topology is the same as the compact-open topology in this case. Herstein, p. 41 uses this description.\n\nConsequences\nThe Jacobson density theorem has various important consequences in the structure theory of rings.Herstein, p. 41 Notably, the Artin–Wedderburn theorem's conclusion about the structure of simple right Artinian rings is recovered. The Jacobson density theorem also characterizes right or left primitive rings as dense subrings of the ring of -linear transformations on some -vector space , where  is a division ring.\n\nRelations to other results\nThis result is related to the Von Neumann bicommutant theorem, which states that, for a *-algebra  of operators on a Hilbert space , the double commutant  can be approximated by  on any given finite set of vectors.

This says that if R is a Noetherian ring and I is a proper ideal generated by n elements of R, then I has height at most n.\n\nThe principal ideal theorem and the generalization, the height theorem, both follow from the fundamental theorem of dimension theory in commutative algebra (see also below for the direct proofs).

      "text": "In mathematics, more specifically abstract algebra and commutative algebra, Nakayama's lemma — also known as the Krull–Azumaya theorem — governs the interaction between the Jacobson radical of a ring (typically a commutative ring) and its finitely generated modules.  Informally, the lemma immediately gives a precise sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring behave like vector spaces over a field. It is an important tool in algebraic geometry, because it allows local data on algebraic varieties, in the form of modules over local rings, to be studied pointwise as vector spaces over the residue field of the ring.\n\nThe lemma is named after the Japanese mathematician Tadashi Nakayama and introduced in its present form in , although it was first discovered in the special case of ideals in a commutative ring by Wolfgang Krull and then in general by Goro Azumaya (1951).;  In the commutative case, the lemma is a simple consequence of a generalized form of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, an observation made by Michael Atiyah (1969).  The special case of the noncommutative version of the lemma for right ideals appears in Nathan Jacobson (1945), and so the noncommutative Nakayama lemma is sometimes known as the Jacobson–Azumaya theorem. The latter has various applications in the theory of Jacobson radicals.\n\nStatement\nLet R be a commutative ring with identity 1.  The following is Nakayama's lemma, as stated in :\n\nStatement 1:  Let I be an ideal in R, and M a finitely-generated module over R.  If IM = M, then there exists an r ∈ R with r ≡ 1 (mod I), such that rM = 0.\n\nThis is proven below.\n\nThe following corollary is also known as Nakayama's lemma, and it is in this form that it most often appears.; \n\nStatement 2: If M is a finitely-generated module over R, J(R) is the Jacobson radical of R, and J(R)M = M, then M = 0.\nProof: r − 1 (with r as above) is in the Jacobson radical so  r is invertible.\n\nMore generally, one has\n\nStatement 3: If M is a finitely-generated module over R, N is a submodule of M, and M = N + J(R)M, then M = N.\nProof: Apply Statement 2 to M/N.\n\nThe following result manifests Nakayama's lemma in terms of generators.\n\nStatement 4: If M is a finitely-generated module over R and the images of elements m1,...,mn of M in M / J(R)M generate M / J(R)M as an R-module, then m1,...,mn also generate M as an R-module.\nProof: Apply Statement 3 to N = ΣiRmi.\n\nIf one assumes instead that R is complete and M is separated with respect to the I-adic topology for an ideal I in R, this last statement holds with I in place of J(R) and without assuming in advance that M is finitely generated.  Here separatedness means that the I-adic topology satisfies the T1 separation axiom, and is equivalent to \n\nConsequences\n\nLocal rings\nIn the special case of a finitely generated module M over a local ring R with maximal ideal m, the quotient M/mM is a vector space over the field R/m.  Statement 4 then implies that a basis of M/mM lifts to a minimal set of generators of M.  Conversely, every minimal set of generators of M is obtained in this way, and any two such sets of generators are related by an invertible matrix with entries in the ring.\n\nIn this form, Nakayama's lemma takes on concrete geometrical significance.  Local rings arise in geometry as the germs of functions at a point.  Finitely generated modules over local rings arise quite often as germs of sections of vector bundles.  Working at the level of germs rather than points, the notion of finite-dimensional vector bundle gives way to that of a coherent sheaf.  Informally, Nakayama's lemma says that one can still regard a coherent sheaf as coming from a vector bundle in some sense.  More precisely, let F be a coherent sheaf of OX-modules over an arbitrary scheme X.  The stalk of F at a point p ∈ X, denoted by Fp, is a module over the local ring Op.  The fibre of F at p is the vector space F(p) = Fp/mpFp where mp is the maximal ideal of Op.  Nakayama's lemma implies that a basis of the fibre F(p) lifts to a minimal set of generators of Fp. That is:\n Any basis of the fiber of a coherent sheaf F at a point comes from a minimal basis of local sections.\n\nGoing up and going down\n\nThe going up theorem is essentially a corollary of Nakayama's lemma.  It asserts:\n\n Let R ⊂ S be an integral extension of commutative rings, and P a prime ideal of R.  Then there is a prime ideal Q in S such that Q ∩ R = P.  Moreover, Q can be chosen to contain any prime Q1 of S such that Q1 ∩ R ⊂ P.\n\nModule epimorphisms\nNakayama's lemma makes precise one sense in which finitely generated modules over a commutative ring are like vector spaces over a field.  The following consequence of Nakayama's lemma gives another way in which this is true:\n\nIf M is a finitely generated R-module and ƒ : M → M is a surjective endomorphism, then ƒ is an isomorphism.\n\nOver a local ring, one can say more about module epimorphisms:\n\nSuppose that R is a local ring with maximal ideal m, and M, N are finitely generated R-modules.  If φ : M → N is an R-linear map such that the quotient φm : M/mM → N/mN is surjective, then φ is surjective.\n\nHomological versions\nNakayama's lemma also has several versions in homological algebra.  The above statement about epimorphisms can be used to show:\n\n Let M be a finitely generated module over a local ring.  Then M is projective if and only if it is free.\nA geometrical and global counterpart to this is the Serre–Swan theorem, relating projective modules and coherent sheaves.\n\nMore generally, one has\n Let R be a local ring and M a finitely generated module over R.  Then the projective dimension of M over R is equal to the length of every minimal free resolution of M.  Moreover, the projective dimension is equal to the global dimension of M, which is by definition the smallest integer i ≥ 0 such that\n\nHere k is the residue field of R and Tor is the tor functor.\n\nProof\nA standard proof of the Nakayama lemma uses the following technique due to .: \"A standard technique applicable to finite A-modules is the 'determinant trick'...\"  See also the proof contained in .\n Let M be an R-module generated by n elements, and φ: M → M an R-linear map.  If there is an ideal I of R such that φ(M) ⊂ IM, then there is a monic polynomial\n\nwith pk ∈ Ik, such that\n\nas an endomorphism of M.\n\nThis assertion is precisely a generalized version of the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, and the proof proceeds along the same lines.  On the generators xi of M, one has a relation of the form\n\nwhere aij ∈ I.  Thus\n\nThe required result follows by multiplying by the adjugate of the matrix (φδij − aij) and invoking Cramer's rule.  One finds then det(φδij − aij) = 0, so the required polynomial is\n\nTo prove Nakayama's lemma from the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, assume that IM = M and take φ to be the identity on M.  Then define a polynomial p(x) as above.  Then\n\nhas the required property.\n\nNoncommutative case\nA version of the lemma holds for right modules over non-commutative unital rings R.  The resulting theorem is sometimes known as the Jacobson–Azumaya theorem.\n\nLet J(R) be the Jacobson radical of R. If U is a right module over a ring, R, and I is a right ideal in R, then define U·I to be the set of all (finite) sums of elements of the form u·i, where · is simply the action of R on U. Necessarily, U·I is a submodule of U.\n\nIf V is a maximal submodule of U, then U/V is simple.  So U·J(R) is necessarily a subset of V, by the definition of J(R) and the fact that U/V is simple. Thus, if U contains at least one (proper) maximal submodule, U·J(R) is a proper submodule of U. However, this need not hold for arbitrary modules U over R, for U need not contain any maximal submodules. Naturally, if U is a Noetherian module, this holds. If R is Noetherian, and U is finitely generated, then U is a Noetherian module over R, and the conclusion is satisfied. Somewhat remarkable is that the weaker assumption, namely that U is finitely generated as an R-module (and no finiteness assumption on R), is sufficient to guarantee the conclusion. This is essentially the statement of Nakayama's lemma.\n\nPrecisely, one has:\nNakayama's lemma: Let U be a finitely generated right module over a (unital) ring R.  If U is a non-zero module, then U·J(R) is a proper submodule of U.\n\nProof\nLet  be a finite subset of , minimal with respect to the property that it generates . Since  is non-zero, this set  is nonempty. Denote every element of  by  for . Since  generates ,.\n\nSuppose , to obtain a contradiction. Then every element can be expressed as a finite combination  for some .\n\nEach  can be further decomposed as  for some . Therefore, we have\n\n.\n\nSince  is a (two-sided) ideal in , we have  for every , and thus this becomes\n\n for some , .\n\nPutting  and applying distributivity, we obtain\n\n.\n\nChoose some . If the right ideal  were proper, then it would be contained in a maximal right ideal  and both  and  would belong to , leading to a contradiction (note that  by the definition of the Jacobson radical). Thus  and  has a right inverse  in . We have\n\n.\n\nTherefore,\n\n.\n\nThus  is a linear combination of the elements from . This contradicts the minimality of  and establishes the result.; \n\nGraded version\n\nThere is also a graded version of Nakayama's lemma. Let R be a ring that is graded by the ordered semigroup of non-negative integers, and let  denote the ideal generated by positively graded elements. Then if M is a graded module over R for which  for i sufficiently negative (in particular, if M is finitely generated and R does not contain elements of negative degree) such that , then . Of particular importance is the case that R is a polynomial ring with the standard grading, and M is a finitely generated module.\n\nThe proof is much easier than in the ungraded case: taking i to be the least integer such that , we see that  does not appear in , so either , or such an i does not exist, i.e., .\n\nSee also\n\n Module theory\n Serre–Swan theorem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n.\n.\n\n.\n \n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nCategory:Theorems in abstract algebra\nCategory:Algebraic geometry\nCategory:Commutative algebra\nCategory:Lemmas"

      "text": "In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, in the theory of Lie algebras, the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem (or PBW theorem) is a result giving an explicit description of the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra. It is named after Henri Poincaré, Garrett Birkhoff, and Ernst Witt.\n\nThe terms PBW type theorem and PBW theorem may also refer to various analogues of the original theorem, comparing a filtered algebra to its associated graded algebra, in particular in the area of quantum groups.\n\n Statement of the theorem \n\nRecall that any vector space V over a field has a basis; this is a set S such that any element of V is a unique (finite) linear combination of elements of S.  In the formulation of Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem we consider bases of which the elements are totally ordered by some relation which we denote ≤.\n\nIf L is a Lie algebra over a field K,  let h denote the canonical K-linear map from L into the universal enveloping algebra U(L).\n\nTheorem. Theorem 9.9 Let L be a Lie algebra over  K and X a totally ordered basis of L. A  canonical monomial over X is a finite sequence  (x1, x2   ..., xn) of elements of X which is non-decreasing in the order ≤, that is, x1 ≤x2 ≤  ... ≤ xn. Extend h to all canonical monomials as follows: If (x1, x2, ..., xn) is a canonical monomial, let \n\nThen h is injective on the set of canonical monomials and its range is a basis of the K-vector space U(L).\n\nStated somewhat differently, consider Y = h(X). Y is totally ordered by the induced ordering from X. The set of monomials\n\nwhere y1 <y2 < ... < yn are elements of Y, and the exponents are non-negative, together with the multiplicative unit 1, form a basis for U(L).  Note that the unit element 1 corresponds to the empty canonical monomial. The theorem then asserts that these monomials form a basis for U(L) as a vector space. It is easy to see that these monomials span U(L); the content of the theorem is that they are linearly independent.\n\nThe multiplicative structure of U(L) is determined by the structure constants in the basis X, that is, the coefficients  such that\n\nThis relation allows one to reduce any product of ys to a linear combination of canonical monomials: The structure constants determine yiyj – yjyi, i.e. what to do in order to change the order of two elements of Y in a product. This fact, modulo an inductive argument on the degree of (non-canonical) monomials, shows one can always achieve products where the factors are ordered in a non-decreasing fashion.\n\nThe Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem can be interpreted as saying that the end result of this reduction is unique and does not depend on the order in which one swaps adjacent elements.Corollary. If L is a Lie algebra over a field, the canonical map L → U(L) is injective.  In particular, any Lie algebra over a field is isomorphic to a Lie subalgebra of an associative algebra.\n\n More general contexts \n\nAlready at its earliest stages, it was known that K could be replaced by any commutative ring, provided that L is a free K-module, i.e., has a basis as above.\n\nTo extend to the case when L is no longer a free K-module, one needs to make a reformulation that does not use bases. This involves replacing the space of monomials in some basis with the symmetric algebra, S(L), on L.\n\nIn the case that K contains the field of rational numbers, one can consider the natural map from S(L) to U(L), sending a monomial . for , to the element \n\nThen, one has the theorem that this map is an isomorphism of K-modules.\n\nStill more generally and naturally, one can consider U(L) as a filtered algebra, equipped with the filtration given by specifying that  lies in filtered degree .  The map L → U(L)  of K-modules canonically extends to a map T(L) → U(L) of algebras, where T(L) is the tensor algebra on L (for example, by the universal property of tensor algebras), and this is a filtered map equipping T(L) with the filtration putting L in degree one (actually, T(L) is graded).  Then, passing to the associated graded, one gets a canonical morphism T(L) → grU(L), which kills the elements vw - wv for v, w ∈ L, and hence descends to a canonical morphism S(L) → grU(L).  Then, the (graded) PBW theorem can be reformulated as the statement that, under certain hypotheses, this final morphism is an isomorphism of commutative algebras.\n\nThis is not true for all K and L (see, for example, the last section of Cohn's 1961 paper), but is true in many cases. These include the aforementioned ones, where either L is a free K-module (hence whenever K is a field), or K contains the field of rational numbers.  More generally, the PBW theorem as formulated above extends to cases such as where  (1) L is a flat K-module, (2) L is torsion-free as an abelian group, (3) L is a direct sum of cyclic modules (or all its localizations at prime ideals of K have this property), or (4) K is a Dedekind domain.  See, for example, the 1969 paper by Higgins for these statements.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that, in some of these cases, one also obtains the stronger statement that the canonical morphism S(L) → grU(L) lifts to a K-module isomorphism S(L) → U(L), without taking associated graded.  This is true in the first cases mentioned, where L is a free K-module, or K contains the field of rational numbers, using the construction outlined here (in fact, the result is a coalgebra isomorphism, and not merely a K'''-module isomorphism, equipping both S(L) and U(L) with their natural coalgebra structures such that  for v ∈ L).  This stronger statement, however, might not extend to all of the cases in the previous paragraph.\n\n History of the theorem \n\nIn four papers from the 1880s by Alfredo Capelli proved, in different terminology, what is now known as the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem in the case of , the General linear Lie algebra; while Poincaré later stated it more generally in 1900.Borel, p.6 Armand Borel says that these results of Capelli were \"completely forgotten for almost a century\", and he does not suggest that Poincaré was aware of Capelli's result.\n\nTon-That and Tran See Ton-That and Tran 1999. have investigated the history of the theorem. They have found out that the majority of the sources before Bourbaki's 1960 book call it Birkhoff-Witt theorem. Following this old tradition, FofanovaSee Fofanova 2001. in her encyclopaedic entry says that Poincaré obtained the first variant of the theorem. She further says that the theorem was subsequently completely demonstrated by Witt and Birkhoff. It appears that pre-Bourbaki sources were not familiar with Poincaré's paper.\n\nBirkhoff See Birkhoff 1937. and Witt See Witt 1937. do not mention Poincaré's work in their 1937 papers. Cartan and Eilenberg See Cartan and Eilenberg 1956. call the theorem Poincaré-Witt Theorem and attribute the complete proof to Witt. BourbakiSee Bourbaki 1960. were the first to use all three names in their 1960 book. Knapp presents a clear illustration of the shifting tradition. In his 1986 bookSee Knapp 1986. he calls it Birkhoff-Witt Theorem, while in his later 1996 bookSee Knapp 1996. he switches to Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem.\n\nIt is not clear whether Poincaré's result was complete. Ton-That and Tran conclude that \"Poincaré had discovered and completely demonstrated this theorem at least thirty-seven years before Witt and Birkhoff\". On the other hand, they point out that \"Poincaré makes several statements without bothering to prove them\". Their own proofs of all the steps are rather long according to their admission. Borel states that Poincaré \"more or less proved the Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt theorem''\" in 1900.\n\nNotes\n\n References \n\n Also available at http://www.numdam.org/article/RHM_1999__5_2_249_0.pdf\n\nCategory:Lie algebras\nCategory:Theorems in abstract algebra"

      "text": "In mathematics, the Lasker–Noether theorem states that every Noetherian ring is a Lasker ring, which means that every ideal can be decomposed as an intersection, called primary decomposition, of finitely many primary ideals (which are related to, but not quite the same as, powers of prime ideals).  The theorem was first proven by  for the special case of polynomial rings and convergent power series rings, and was proven in its full generality by .\n\nThe Lasker–Noether theorem is an extension of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, and more generally the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem plays an important role in algebraic geometry, by asserting that every algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of irreducible components.\n\nIt has a straightforward extension to modules stating that every submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary submodules. This contains the case for rings as a special case, considering the ring as a module over itself, so that ideals are submodules. This also generalizes the primary decomposition form of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, and for the special case of polynomial rings over a field, it generalizes the decomposition of an algebraic set into a finite union of (irreducible) varieties.\n\nThe first algorithm for computing primary decompositions for polynomial rings over a field of characteristic 0Primary decomposition requires testing irreducibility of polynomials, which is not always algorithmically possible in nonzero characteristic. was published by Noether's student .

For example, groups of prime power order and free abelian groups are coprimary modules over the ring of integers. \nA submodule M of a module N is called a primary submodule if N/M is coprimary. \nAn ideal I is called primary if it is a primary submodule of R.

For the special case of ideals it states that every ideal of a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of primary ideals.\n\nAn equivalent statement is: every finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is contained in a finite product of coprimary modules.\n\nThe Lasker–Noether theorem follows immediately from the following three facts:\nAny submodule of a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is an intersection of a finite number of irreducible submodules. \nIf M is an irreducible submodule of a finitely generated module N over a Noetherian ring then N/M has only one associated prime ideal. \nA finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring is coprimary if and only if it has at most one associated prime.\n\nA proof in a somewhat different flavor is given below.\n\nPrimary decomposition of ideals\n\nLet R be a Noetherian commutative ring, and I an ideal in R.

However, primary ideals which are associated with non-minimal prime ideals are in general not unique.\n\nIn the case of the ring of integers , the Lasker–Noether theorem is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.

For this reason, the primary decomposition of the radical of  is sometimes called the prime decomposition of .\n\nThe components of a primary decomposition (as well as of the algebraic set decomposition) corresponding to minimal primes are said isolated, and the others are said embedded.\n\nFor the decomposition of algebraic varieties, only the minimal primes are interesting, but in intersection theory, and, more generally in scheme theory, the complete primary decomposition has a geometric meaning.\n\n Proof \nNowadays, it is common to do primary decomposition within the theory of associated primes. The proof below is in the spirit of this approach.\n\nLet M be a finitely generated module over a Noetherian ring R and N a submodule. To show N admits a primary decomposition, by replacing M by , it is enough to show that when . Now,\n\nwhere  are primary submodules of M. In other words, 0 has a primary decomposition if, for each associated prime P of M, there is a primary submodule Q such that . Now, consider the set  (which is nonempty since zero is in it). The set has a maximal element Q since M is a Noetherian module. If Q is not P-primary, say,  is associated with , then  for some submodule Q', contradicting the maximality. (Note: .) Thus, Q is primary and the proof is complete.\n\nRemark: The same proof shows that if R, M, N are all graded, then  in the decomposition may be taken to be graded as well.\n\nMinimal decompositions and uniqueness\n\nIn this section, all modules will be finitely generated over a Noetherian ring R.\n\nA primary decomposition of a submodule M of a module N is called minimal if it has the smallest possible number of primary modules. For minimal decompositions, the primes of the primary modules are uniquely determined: they are the associated primes of N/M. Moreover, the primary submodules associated to the minimal or isolated associated primes (those not containing any other associated primes) are also unique. However the primary submodules associated to the non-minimal associated primes (called embedded primes for geometric reasons) need not be unique.\n\nExample: Let N = R = k[x, y] for some field k, and let M be the ideal (xy, y2). Then M has two different minimal primary decompositions\nM = (y) ∩ (x, y2) = (y) ∩ (x + y, y2).\nThe minimal prime is (y) and the embedded prime is (x, y).\n\n Non-Noetherian case \nThe next theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a ring to have primary decompositions for its ideals.\n\nThe proof is given at Chapter 4 of Atiyah–MacDonald as a series of exercises.\n\nThere is the following uniqueness theorem for an ideal having a primary decomposition.\n\nNow, for any commutative ring R,  an ideal I and a minimal prime P over I, the pre-image of I RP under the localization map is the smallest P-primary ideal containing I. Thus, in the setting of preceding theorem, the primary ideal Q corresponding to a minimal prime P is also the smallest P-primary ideal containing I and is called the P-primary component of I.\n\nFor example, if the power Pn of a prime P has a primary decomposition, then its P-primary component is the n-th symbolic power of P.\n\nAdditive theory of ideals\n\nThis result is the first in an area now known as the additive theory of ideals, which studies the ways of representing an ideal as the intersection of a special class of ideals. The decision on the \"special class\", e.g., primary ideals, is a problem in itself. In the case of non-commutative rings, the class of tertiary ideals is a useful substitute for the class of primary ideals.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nM. Atiyah, I.G.

From the time of Galois, the role of primitive elements had been to represent a splitting field as generated by a single element. This (arbitrary) choice of such an element was bypassed in Artin's treatment.Israel Kleiner, A History of Abstract Algebra (2007), p. 64. At the same time, considerations of construction of such an element receded: the theorem becomes an existence theorem.\n\nThe following theorem of Artin then takes the place of the classical primitive element theorem.\n\nTheorem\n\nLet  be a finite degree field extension. Then  for some element  if and only if there exist only finitely many intermediate fields K with .\n\nA corollary to the theorem is then the primitive element theorem in the more traditional sense (where separability was usually tacitly assumed):\n\nCorollary\n\nLet  be a finite degree separable extension. Then  for some .\n\nThe corollary applies to algebraic number fields, i.e. finite extensions of the rational numbers Q, since Q has characteristic 0 and therefore every extension over Q is separable.\n\nCounterexamples\n\nFor non-separable extensions, necessarily in characteristic p with p a prime number, then at least when the degree [L : K] is p, L / K has a primitive element, because there are no intermediate subfields. When [L : K] = p2, there may not be a primitive element (and therefore there are infinitely many intermediate fields). This happens, for example if K is\n\nFp(T, U),\n\nthe field of rational functions in two indeterminates T and U over the finite field with p elements, and L is obtained from K by adjoining a p-th root of T, and of U. In fact one can see that for any α in L, the element αp lies in K, but a primitive element must have degree p2 over K.\n\nConstructive results\n\nGenerally, the set of all primitive elements for a finite separable extension L / K is the complement of a finite collection of proper K-subspaces of L, namely the intermediate fields. This statement says nothing for the case of finite fields, for which there is a computational theory dedicated to finding a generator of the multiplicative group of the field (a cyclic group), which is a fortiori a primitive element. Where K is infinite, a pigeonhole principle proof technique considers the linear subspace generated by two elements and proves that there are only finitely many linear combinations\n\nwith c in K, that fail to generate the subfield containing both elements. This is almost immediate as a way of showing how Artin's result implies the classical result, and a bound for the number of exceptional c in terms of the number of intermediate fields results (this number being something that can be bounded itself by Galois theory and a priori). Therefore, in this case trial-and-error is a possible practical method to find primitive elements. See the Example.\n\n Example \nIt is not, for example, immediately obvious that if one adjoins to the field  of rational numbers roots of both polynomials\n\nand\n\nsay  and  respectively, to get a field K =  of degree 4 over , that the extension is simple and there exists a primitive element γ in K so that K = . One can in fact check that with\n\nthe powers γ i for 0 ≤ i ≤ 3 can be written out as linear combinations of 1, , , and  with integer coefficients. Taking these as a system of linear equations, or by factoring, one can solve for  and  over  (one gets, for instance, ), which implies that this choice of γ is indeed a primitive element in this example. A simpler argument, assuming the knowledge of all the subfields as given by Galois theory, is to note the independence of 1, , , and  over the rationals; this shows that the subfield generated by γ cannot be that generated by  or  or , exhausting all the subfields of degree 2. Therefore, it must be the whole field.\n\n See also \n Primitive element (finite field)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n J.

It states that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring is free.\n\nGeometrically, finitely generated projective modules over the ring  correspond to vector bundles over affine space , where free modules correspond to trivial vector bundles. This correspondence is given by the 'globalisation' or 'twiddlification' functor, sending  (cite Hartshorne II.5, page 110).  Affine space is topologically contractible, so it admits no non-trivial topological vector bundles.  A simple argument using the exponential exact sequence and the d-bar Poincaré lemma shows that it also admits no non-trivial holomorphic vector bundles.  Jean-Pierre Serre, in his 1955 paper Faisceaux algébriques cohérents, remarked that the corresponding question was not known for algebraic vector bundles: \"It is not known whether there exist projective A-modules of finite type which are not free.\"\"On ignore s'il existe des A-modules projectifs de type fini qui ne soient pas libres.\"  Serre, FAC, p. 243.

(Serre wrote, \"I objected as often as I could [to the name].\"Lam, p. 1)  The statement does not immediately follow from the proofs given in the topological or holomorphic case. These cases only guarantee that there is a continuous or holomorphic trivialization, not an algebraic trivialization. Serre made some progress towards a solution in 1957 when he proved that every finitely generated projective module over a polynomial ring over a field was stably free, meaning that after forming its direct sum with a finitely generated free module, it became free.  The problem remained open until 1976, when Daniel Quillen and Andrei Suslin independently proved the result.

Item 2 is much deeper.\n\nFor an integral domain, the criterion is due to Krull. The general case is due to Serre.\n\n Proof \n\nSufficiency\n(After EGA IV. Theorem 5.8.6.)\n\nSuppose A satisfies S2 and R1. Then A in particular satisfies S1 and R0; hence, it is reduced. If  are the minimal prime ideals of A, then the total ring of fractions K of A is the direct product of the residue fields : see total ring of fractions of a reduced ring. That means we can write  where  are idempotents in  and such that . Now, if A is integrally closed in K, then each  is integral over A and so is in A; consequently, A is a direct product of integrally closed domains Aei's and we are done. Thus, it is enough to show that A is integrally closed in K.\n\nFor this end, suppose\n\nwhere all f, g, ai's are in A and g is moreover a non-zerodivisor. We want to show:\n.\nNow, the condition S2 says that  is unmixed of height one; i.e., each associated primes  of  has height one. By the condition R1, the localization  is integrally closed and so , where  is the localization map, since the integral equation persists after localization. If  is the primary decomposition, then, for any i, the radical of  is an associated prime  of  and so ; the equality here is because  is a -primary ideal. Hence, the assertion holds.\n\nNecessity\nSuppose A is a normal ring. For S2, let  be an associated prime of  for a non-zerodivisor f; we need to show it has height one. Replacing A by a localization, we can assume A is a local ring with maximal ideal . By definition, there is an element g in A such that  and . Put y = g/f in the total ring of fractions. If , then  is a faithful -module and is a finitely generated A-module; consequently,  is integral over A and thus in A, a contradiction. Hence,  or , which implies  has height one (Krull's principal ideal theorem).\n\nFor R1, we argue in the same way: let  be a prime ideal of height one. Localizing at  we assume  is a maximal ideal and the similar argument as above shows that  is in fact principal. Thus, A is a regular local ring. \n\n Notes \n\n References \n\nH.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_theorem_for_finitely_generated_modules_over_a_principal_ideal_domain",
      "text": "In mathematics, in the field of abstract algebra, the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups and roughly states that finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain can be uniquely decomposed in much the same way that integers have a prime factorization.  The result provides a simple framework to understand various canonical form results for square matrices over fields.\n\nStatement\n\nWhen a vector space over a field F has a finite generating set, then one may extract from it a basis consisting of a finite number n of vectors, and the space is therefore isomorphic to Fn. The corresponding statement with the F generalized to a principal ideal domain R is no longer true, since a basis for a finitely generated module over R might not exist. However such a module is still isomorphic to a quotient of some module Rn with n finite (to see this it suffices to construct the morphism that sends the elements of the canonical basis of Rn to the generators of the module, and take the quotient by its kernel.) By changing the choice of generating set, one can in fact describe the module as the quotient of some Rn by a particularly simple submodule, and this is the structure theorem.\n\nThe structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain usually appears in the following two forms.\n\nInvariant factor decomposition\nFor every finitely generated module  over a principal ideal domain , there is a unique decreasing sequence of proper ideals  such that  is isomorphic to the sum of cyclic modules:\n\nThe generators  of the ideals are unique up to multiplication by a unit, and are called invariant factors of M. Since the ideals should be proper, these factors must not themselves be invertible (this avoids trivial factors in the sum), and the inclusion of the ideals means one has divisibility . The free part is visible in the part of the decomposition corresponding to  factors . Such factors, if any, occur at the end of the sequence.\n\nWhile the direct sum is uniquely determined by , the isomorphism giving the decomposition itself is not unique in general. For instance if  is actually a field, then all occurring ideals must be zero, and one obtains the decomposition of a finite dimensional vector space into a direct sum of one-dimensional subspaces; the number of such factors is fixed, namely the dimension of the space, but there is in a lot of freedom for choosing the subspaces themselves (if ).\n\nThe nonzero  elements, together with the number of  which are zero, form a complete set of invariants for the module. Explicitly, this means that any two modules sharing the same set of invariants are necessarily isomorphic. \n\nSome prefer to write the free part of M separately:\n\nwhere the visible  are nonzero, and f is the number of 's in the original sequence which are 0.\n\nPrimary decomposition\nEvery finitely generated module M over a principal ideal domain R is isomorphic to one of the form\n\nwhere  and the  are primary ideals. The  are unique (up to multiplication by units). \n\nThe elements  are called the elementary divisors of M. In a PID, nonzero primary ideals are powers of primes, and so . When , the resulting indecomposable module is  itself, and this is inside the part of M that is a free module.\n\nThe summands  are indecomposable, so the primary decomposition is a decomposition into indecomposable modules, and thus every finitely generated module over a PID is a completely decomposable module. Since PID's are Noetherian rings, this can be seen as a manifestation of the Lasker-Noether theorem.\n\nAs before, it is possible to write the free part (where ) separately and express M as:\n\nwhere the visible  are nonzero.\n\nProofs\nOne proof proceeds as follows:\n Every finitely generated module over a PID is also finitely presented because a PID is Noetherian, an even stronger condition than coherence.\n Take a presentation, which is a map  (relations to generators), and put it in Smith normal form.\nThis yields the invariant factor decomposition, and the diagonal entries of Smith normal form are the invariant factors.\n\nAnother outline of a proof:\n Denote by tM the torsion submodule of M. Then M/tM is a finitely generated torsion free module, and such a module over a commutative PID is a free module of finite rank, so it is isomorphic to  for a positive integer n. This free module can be embedded as a submodule F of M, such that the embedding splits (is a right inverse of) the projection map; it suffices to lift each of the generators of F into M. As a consequence .\n For a prime p in R we can then speak of  for each prime p.  This is a submodule of tM, and it turns out that each Np is a direct sum of cyclic modules, and that tM is a direct sum of Np for a finite number of distinct primes p.\n Putting the previous two steps together, M is decomposed into cyclic modules of the indicated types.\n\nCorollaries\nThis includes the classification of finite-dimensional vector spaces as a special case, where . Since fields have no non-trivial ideals, every finitely generated vector space is free.\n\nTaking  yields the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.\n\nLet T be a linear operator on a  finite-dimensional vector space V over K. Taking , the algebra of polynomials with coefficients in K evaluated at T, yields structure information about T. V can be viewed as a finitely generated module over . The last invariant factor is the minimal polynomial, and the product of invariant factors is the characteristic polynomial. Combined with a standard matrix form for , this yields various canonical forms:\n invariant factors + companion matrix yields Frobenius normal form (aka, rational canonical form)\n primary decomposition + companion matrix yields primary rational canonical form\n primary decomposition + Jordan blocks yields Jordan canonical form (this latter only holds over an algebraically closed field)\n\nUniqueness\nWhile the invariants (rank, invariant factors, and elementary divisors) are unique, the isomorphism between M and its canonical form is not unique, and does not even preserve the direct sum decomposition. This follows because there are non-trivial automorphisms of these modules which do not preserve the summands.\n\nHowever, one has a canonical torsion submodule T, and similar canonical submodules corresponding to each (distinct) invariant factor, which yield a canonical sequence:\n\nCompare composition series in Jordan–Hölder theorem.\n\nFor instance, if , and  is one basis, then\n is another basis, and the change of basis matrix  does not preserve the summand . However, it does preserve the  summand, as this is the torsion submodule (equivalently here, the 2-torsion elements).\n\nGeneralizations\nGroups\nThe Jordan–Hölder theorem is a more general result for finite groups (or modules over an arbitrary ring). In this generality, one obtains a composition series, rather than a direct sum.\n\nThe Krull–Schmidt theorem and related results give conditions under which a module has something like a primary decomposition, a decomposition as a direct sum of indecomposable modules in which the summands are unique up to order.\n\nPrimary decomposition\nThe primary decomposition generalizes to finitely generated modules over commutative Noetherian rings, and this result is called the Lasker–Noether theorem.\n\nIndecomposable modules\nBy contrast, unique decomposition into indecomposable submodules does not generalize as far, and the failure is measured by the ideal class group, which vanishes for PIDs.\n\nFor rings that are not principal ideal domains, unique decomposition need not even hold for modules over a ring generated by two elements. For the ring R = Z[√−5], both the module R and its submodule M generated by 2 and 1 + √−5 are indecomposable. While R is not isomorphic to M, R ⊕ R is isomorphic to M ⊕ M; thus the images of the M summands give indecomposable submodules L1, L2 < R ⊕ R which give a different decomposition of R ⊕ R. The failure of uniquely factorizing R ⊕ R into a direct sum of indecomposable modules is directly related (via the ideal class group) to the failure of the unique factorization of elements of R into irreducible elements of R.\n\nHowever, over a Dedekind domain the ideal class group is the only obstruction, and the structure theorem generalizes to finitely generated modules over a Dedekind domain with minor modifications. There is still a unique torsion part, with a torsionfree complement (unique up to isomorphism), but a torsionfree module over a Dedekind domain is no longer necessarily free. Torsionfree modules over a Dedekind domain are determined (up to isomorphism) by rank and Steinitz class (which takes value in the ideal class group), and the decomposition into a direct sum of copies of R (rank one free modules) is replaced by a direct sum into rank one projective modules: the individual summands are not uniquely determined, but the Steinitz class (of the sum) is.\n\nNon-finitely generated modules\nSimilarly for modules that are not finitely generated, one cannot expect such a nice decomposition: even the number of factors may vary.  There are Z-submodules of Q4 which are simultaneously direct sums of two indecomposable modules and direct sums of three indecomposable modules, showing the analogue of the primary decomposition cannot hold for infinitely generated modules, even over the integers, Z.\n\nAnother issue that arises with non-finitely generated modules is that there are torsion-free modules which are not free. For instance, consider the ring Z of integers. Then Q is a torsion-free Z-module which is not free. Another classical example of such a module is the Baer–Specker group, the group of all sequences of integers under termwise addition. In general, the question of which infinitely generated torsion-free abelian groups are free depends on which large cardinals exist. A consequence is that any structure theorem for infinitely generated modules depends on a choice of set theory axioms and may be invalid under a different choice.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Theorems in abstract algebra\nCategory:Module theory\n\nde:Hauptidealring#Moduln über Hauptidealringen"

In other words, for finite rings, there is no distinction between domains, skew-fields and fields.\n\nThe Artin–Zorn theorem generalizes the theorem to alternative rings: every finite alternative division ring is a field.\n\n History \nThe original proof was given by Joseph Wedderburn in 1905,Lam (2001), [ p. 204] who went on to prove it two other ways. Another proof was given by Leonard Eugene Dickson shortly after Wedderburn's original proof, and Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. However, as noted in , Wedderburn's first proof was incorrect – it had a gap – and his subsequent proofs appeared only after he had read Dickson's correct proof. On this basis, Parshall argues that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.\n\nA simplified version of the proof was later given by Ernst Witt. Witt's proof is sketched below. Alternatively, the theorem is a consequence of the Skolem–Noether theorem by the following argument.Theorem 4.1 in Ch. IV of Milne, class field theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/cft.html Let D be a finite division algebra with center k. Let [D : k] = n2 and q denote the cardinality of k. Every maximal subfield of D has qn elements; so they are isomorphic and thus are conjugate by Skolem–Noether. But a finite group (the multiplicative group of D in our case) cannot be a union of conjugates of a proper subgroup; hence, n = 1.\n\nA later \"group-theoretic\" proof was given by Theodore Kaczynski. (Jstor link, requires login)  This proof, Kaczynski's first published piece of mathematical writing, was a short, two-page note which also acknowledged the earlier historical proofs.\n\n Relationship to the Brauer group of a finite field \nThe theorem is essentially equivalent to saying that the Brauer group of a finite field is trivial. In fact, this characterization immediately yields a proof of the theorem as follows: let k be a finite field. Since the Herbrand quotient vanishes by finiteness,  coincides with , which in turn vanishes by Hilbert 90.\n\n Proof \nLet A  be a finite domain. For each nonzero x in A, the two maps\n\nare injective by the cancellation property, and thus, surjective by counting. It follows from the elementary group theorye.g., Exercise 1.9 in Milne, group theory, http://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/GT.pdf  that the nonzero elements of A form a group under multiplication. Thus, A is a skew-field.\n\nTo prove that every finite skew-field is a field, we use strong induction on the size of the skew-field. Thus, let A be a skew-field, and assume that all skew-fields that are proper subsets of A are fields. Since the center Z(A) of A  is a field,  A is a vector space over Z(A) with finite dimension n.  Our objective is then to show n = 1. If q is the order of Z(A), then A has order qn. Note that because Z(A) contains the distinct elements 0 and 1, q>1. For each x in A that is not in the center, the centralizer Zx of x is clearly a skew-field and thus a field, by the induction hypothesis, and because Zx can be viewed as a vector space over Z(A) and A can be viewed as a vector space over Zx, we have that Zx has order qd where d divides n and is less than n. Viewing Z(A)*, A*, and the Z*x   as groups under multiplication, we can write the class equation\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the conjugacy classes not contained within Z(A)*, and the d are defined so that for each conjugacy class, the order of Z*x for any x in the class is qd-1. qn−1 and qd−1 both admit polynomial factorization in terms of cyclotomic polynomials\n.\n\nIn the polynomial identities\n and ,\n\nwe set x = q. Because each d is a proper divisor of n,\n divides both qn−1 and each ,\n\nso by the above class equation  must divide q−1, and therefore\n.\n\nTo see that this forces n to be 1, we will show\n\nfor n > 1 using factorization over the complex numbers.

      "text": "In algebra, Zariski's lemma, proved by , states that, if a field  is finitely generated as an associative algebra over another field , then  is a finite field extension of  (that is, it is also finitely generated as a vector space).\n\nAn important application of the lemma is a proof of the weak form of Hilbert's nullstellensatz: if I is a proper ideal of  (k algebraically closed field), then I has a zero; i.e., there is a point x in  such that  for all f in I. (Proof: replacing I by a maximal ideal , we can assume  is maximal. Let  and  be the natural surjection. Since k is algebraically closed, by the lemma,  and then for any ,\n;\nthat is to say,  is a zero of .)\n\nThe lemma may also be understood from the following perspective. In general, a ring R is a Jacobson ring if and only if every finitely generated R-algebra that is a field is finite over R. Thus, the lemma follows from the fact that a field is a Jacobson ring.\n\n Proof \nTwo direct proofs, one of which is due to Zariski, are given in Atiyah–MacDonald. For Zariski's original proof, see the original paper.http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183510605 Another direct proof in the language of Jacobson rings is given below. The lemma is also a consequence of the Noether normalization lemma. Indeed, by the normalization lemma, K is a finite module over the polynomial ring  where  are elements of K that are algebraically independent over k. But since K has Krull dimension zero and since an integral ring extension (e.g., a finite ring extension) preserves Krull dimensions, the polynomial ring must have dimension zero; i.e., .\n\nThe following characterization of a Jacobson ring contains Zariski's lemma as a special case. Recall that a ring is a Jacobson ring if every prime ideal is an intersection of maximal ideals. (When A is a field, A is a Jacobson ring and the theorem below is precisely Zariski's lemma.)\n\nProof: 2.  1.: Let  be a prime ideal of A and set . We need to show the Jacobson radical of B is zero. For that end, let f be a nonzero element of B. Let  be a maximal ideal of the localization . Then  is a field that is a finitely generated A-algebra and so is finite over A by assumption; thus it is finite over  and so is finite over the subring  where . By integrality,  is a maximal ideal not containing f.\n\n1.  2.: Since a factor ring of a Jacobson ring is Jacobson, we can assume B contains A as a subring. Then the assertion is a consequence of the next algebraic fact:\n\n(*) Let  be integral domains such that B is finitely generated as A-algebra. Then there exists a nonzero a in A such that every ring homomorphism , K an algebraically closed field, with  extends to .\n\nIndeed, choose a maximal ideal  of A not containing a. Writing K for some algebraic closure of , the canonical map  extends to . Since B is a field,  is injective and so B is algebraic (thus finite algebraic) over .  We now prove (*). If B contains an element that is transcendental over A, then it contains a polynomial ring over A to which φ extends (without a requirement on a) and so we can assume B is algebraic over A (by Zorn's lemma, say). Let  be the generators of B as A-algebra. Then each  satisfies the relation\n\nwhere n depends on i and . Set . Then  is integral over . Now given , we first extend it to  by setting . Next, let .

Let . In this situation, given a B-module M, there is an isomorphism (of A' -modules):\n\nHere the subscript indicates the forgetful functor, i.e.,  is M, but regarded as an A-module.\nIndeed, such an isomorphism is obtained by observing \n\nThus, the two operations, namely forgetful functors and tensor products commute in the sense of the above isomorphism.\nThe base change theorems discussed below are statements of a similar kind.\n\n Definition of the base change map \n\nThe base change theorems presented below all assert that (for different types of sheaves, and under various assumptions on the maps involved), that the following base change map\n\nis an isomorphism, where\n\nare continuous maps between topological spaces that form a Cartesian square and  is a sheaf on X.The roles of  and  are symmetric, and in some contexts (especially smooth base change) the more familiar formulation is the other one (dealing instead with the map  for  a sheaf on ). For consistency, the results in this article below are all stated for the same situation, namely the map ; but readers should be sure to check this against their expectations. Here  denotes the higher direct image of  under f, i.e., the derived functor of the direct image (also known as pushforward) functor .\n\nThis map exists without any assumptions on the maps f and g. It is constructed as follows: since  is left adjoint to , there is a natural map (called unit map)\n\nand so \n\nThe Grothendieck spectral sequence then gives the first map and the last map (they are edge maps) in:\n\nCombining this with the above yields\n\nUsing the adjointness of  and  finally yields the desired map.\n\nThe above-mentioned introductory example is a special case of this, namely for the affine schemes  and, consequently, , and the quasi-coherent sheaf  associated to the B-module M.\n\nIt is conceptually convenient to organize the above base change maps, which only involve only a single higher direct image functor, into one which encodes all  at a time. In fact, similar arguments as above yield a map in the derived category of sheaves on S':\n\nwhere  denotes the (total) derived functor of .\n\n General topology \nProper base change\nIf X is a Hausdorff topological space, S is a locally compact Hausdorff space and f is universally closed (i.e.,  is a closed map for any continuous map ), then\nthe base change map\n\nis an isomorphism. Indeed, we have: for ,\n\nand so for \n\nTo encode all individual higher derived functors of  into one entity, the above statement may equivalently be rephrased by saying that the base change map\n\nis a quasi-isomorphism.\n\nThe assumptions that the involved spaces be Hausdorff have been weakened by .\n\n has extended the above theorem to non-abelian sheaf cohomology, i.e., sheaves taking values in simplicial sets (as opposed to abelian groups).\n\nDirect image with compact support\nIf the map f is not closed, the base change map need not be an isomorphism, as the following example shows (the maps are the standard inclusions) :\n\nOne the one hand  is always zero, but if  is a local system on  corresponding to a representation of the fundamental group  (which is isomorphic to Z), then  can be computed as the invariants of the monodromy action of  on the stalk  (for any ), which need not vanish.\n\nTo obtain a base-change result, the functor  (or its derived functor) has to be replaced by the direct image with compact support . For example, if  is the inclusion of an open subset, such as in the above example,  is the extension by zero, i.e., its stalks are given by\n\nIn general, there is a map , which is a quasi-isomorphism if f is proper, but not in general. The proper base change theorem mentioned above has the following generalization: there is a quasi-isomorphism, the four spaces are assumed to be locally compact and of finite dimension.\n\nBase change for quasi-coherent sheaves\n\nProper base change\nProper base change theorems for quasi-coherent sheaves apply in the following situation:  is a proper morphism between noetherian schemes, and  is a coherent sheaf which is flat over S (i.e.,  is flat over ). In this situation, the following statements hold:, , \n \"Semicontinuity theorem\":\n For each , the function  is upper semicontinuous.\n The function  is locally constant, where  denotes the Euler characteristic.\n If S is reduced and connected, then for each  the following are equivalent\n is constant.\n  is locally free and the natural map\n\nis an isomorphism for all .\nFurthermore, if these conditions hold, then the natural map\n\nis an isomorphism for all .\n If, for some p,  for all , then the natural map\n\nis an isomorphism for all .\n\nAs the stalk of the sheaf  is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under f, this statement is paraphrased by saying that \"cohomology commutes with base extension\".\n\nThese statements are proved using the following fact, where in addition to the above assumptions : there is a finite complex  of finitely generated projective A-modules and a natural isomorphism of functors\n\non the category of -algebras.\n\nFlat base change\nThe base change map\n\nis an isomorphism for a quasi-coherent sheaf  (on ), provided that the map  is flat (together with a number of technical conditions: f needs to be a separated morphism of finite type, the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).\n\nFlat base change in the derived category\nA far reaching extension of flat base change is possible when considering the base change map\n\nin the derived category of sheaves on S', similarly as mentioned above. Here  is the (total) derived functor of the pullback of -modules (because  involves a tensor product,  is not exact when  is not flat and therefore is not equal to its derived functor ).\nThis map is a quasi-isomorphism provided that the following conditions are satisfied:\n  is quasi-compact and  is quasi-compact and quasi-separated,\n  is an object in , the bounded derived category of -modules, and its cohomology sheaves are quasi-coherent (for example,  could be a bounded complex of quasi-coherent sheaves)\n  and  are Tor-independent over , meaning that if  and  satisfy , then for all integers ,\n.\n One of the following conditions is satisfied:\n  has finite flat amplitude relative to , meaning that it is quasi-isomorphic in  to a complex  such that  is -flat for all  outside some bounded interval ; equivalently, there exists an interval  such that for any complex  in , one has  for all  outside ; or\n  has finite Tor-dimension, meaning that  has finite flat amplitude relative to .\n\nOne advantage of this formulation is that the flatness hypothesis has been weakened.  However, making concrete computations of the cohomology of the left- and right-hand sides now requires the Grothendieck spectral sequence.\n\nBase change in derived algebraic geometry\nDerived algebraic geometry provides a means to drop the flatness assumption, provided that the pullback  is replaced by the homotopy pullback. In the easiest case when X, S, and  are affine (with the notation as above), the homotopy pullback is given by the derived tensor product\n\nThen, assuming that the schemes (or, more generally, derived schemes) involved are quasi-compact and quasi-separated, the natural transformation\n\nis a quasi-isomorphism for any quasi-coherent sheaf, or more generally a complex of quasi-coherent sheaves.\nThe afore-mentioned flat base change result is in fact a special case since for g flat the homotopy pullback (which is locally given by a derived tensor product) agrees with the ordinary pullback (locally given by the underived tensor product), and since the pullback along the flat maps g and g' are automatically derived (i.e., ). The auxiliary assumptions related to the Tor-independence or Tor-amplitude in the preceding base change theorem also become unnecessary.\n\nIn the above form, base change has been extended by  to the situation where X, S, and S' are (possibly derived) stacks, provided that the map f is a perfect map (which includes the case that f is a quasi-compact, quasi-separated map of schemes, but also includes more general stacks, such as the classifying stack BG of an algebraic group in characteristic zero).\n\nVariants and applications\nProper base change also holds in the context of complex manifolds.\nThe theorem on formal functions is a variant of the proper base change, where the pullback is replaced by a completion operation.\n\nThe see-saw principle and the theorem of the cube, which are foundational facts in the theory of abelian varieties, are a consequence of proper base change.\n\nA base-change also holds for D-modules: if X, S, X', and S' are smooth varieties (but f and g need not be flat or proper etc.), there is a quasi-isomorphism\n\nwhere  and  denote the inverse and direct image functors for D-modules.\n\nBase change for étale sheaves\nFor étale torsion sheaves , there are two base change results referred to as proper and smooth base change, respectively: base change holds if  is proper.,  It also holds if g is smooth, provided that f is quasi-compact and provided that the torsion of  is prime to the characteristic of the residue fields of X.\n\nClosely related to proper base change is the following fact (the two theorems are usually proved simultaneously): let X be a variety over a separably closed field and  a constructible sheaf on . Then  are finite in each of the following cases:\nX is complete, or \n has no p-torsion, where p is the characteristic of k.\n\nUnder additional assumptions,  extended the proper base change theorem to non-torsion étale sheaves.\n\nApplications\nIn close analogy to the topological situation mentioned above, the base change map for an open immersion f, \n\nis not usually an isomorphism. Instead the extension by zero functor  satisfies an isomorphism\n\nThis fact and the proper base change suggest to define the direct image functor with compact support for a map f by\n\nwhere  is a compactification of f, i.e., a factorization into an open immersion followed by a proper map.\nThe proper base change theorem is needed to show that this is well-defined, i.e., independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of the compactification.\nMoreover, again in analogy to the case of sheaves on a topological space, a base change formula for  vs.  does hold for non-proper maps f.\n\nFor the structural map  of a scheme over a field k, the individual cohomologies of , denoted by  referred to as cohomology with compact support.

      "text": "Bézout's theorem is a statement in algebraic geometry concerning the number of common points, or intersection points, of two plane algebraic curves which do not share a common component (that is, which do not have infinitely many common points). The theorem states that the number of common points of two such curves is at most equal to the product of their degrees, and equality holds if one counts points at infinity and points with complex coordinates (or more generally, coordinates from the algebraic closure of the ground field), and if each point is counted with its intersection multiplicity. It is named after Étienne Bézout.\n\nBézout's theorem refers also to the generalization to higher dimensions: Let there be n homogeneous polynomials in  variables, of degrees , that define n hypersurfaces in the projective space of dimension n. If the number of intersection points of the hypersurfaces is finite over an algebraic closure of the ground field, then this number is  if the points are counted with their multiplicity.\nAs in the case of two variables, in the case of affine hypersurfaces, and when not counting multiplicities nor non-real points, this theorem provides only an upper bound of the number of points, which is often reached. This is often referred to as Bézout's bound.\n\nBézout's theorem is fundamental in computer algebra and effective algebraic geometry, by showing that most problems have a computational complexity that is at least exponential in the number of variables. It follows that in these areas, the best complexity that may be hoped for will occur in algorithms that have a complexity which is polynomial in Bézout's bound.\n\nRigorous statement\nSuppose that X and Y are two plane projective curves defined over a field F that do not have a common component (this condition means that  X and Y are defined by polynomials, whose polynomial greatest common divisor is a constant; in particular, it holds for a pair of \"generic\" curves). Then the total number of intersection points of X and Y with coordinates in an algebraically closed field E which contains F, counted with their multiplicities, is equal to the product of the degrees of X and Y.\n\nThe generalization in higher dimension may be stated as:\n\nLet n projective hypersurfaces be given in a projective space of dimension n over an algebraic closed field, which are defined by n homogeneous polynomials in n + 1 variables, of degrees  Then either the number of intersection points is infinite, or the number of intersection points, counted with multiplicity, is equal to the product  If the hypersurfaces are irreducible and in relative general position, then there are  intersection points, all with multiplicity 1.\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem. In particular, it may be deduced by applying iteratively the following generalization: if V is a projective algebraic set of dimension  and degree , and H is a hypersurface (defined by a polynomial) of degree , that does not contain any irreducible component of V, then the intersection of V and H has dimension  and degree  For a (sketched) proof using the Hilbert series see Hilbert series and Hilbert polynomial#Degree of a projective variety and Bézout's theorem.\n\nBézout's theorem has been further generalized as the so-called multi-homogeneous Bézout theorem.\n\nHistory\nBezout's theorem was essentially stated by Isaac Newton in his proof of lemma 28 of volume 1 of his Principia in 1687, where he claims that two curves have a number of intersection points given by the product of their degrees.   The theorem was later published in 1779 in Étienne Bézout's Théorie générale des équations algébriques. Bézout, who did not have at his disposal modern algebraic notation for equations in several variables, gave a proof based on manipulations with cumbersome algebraic expressions. From the modern point of view, Bézout's treatment was rather heuristic, since he did not formulate the precise conditions for the theorem to hold. This led to a sentiment, expressed by certain authors, that his proof was neither correct nor the first proof to be given.\n\nIntersection multiplicity\n\nThe most delicate part of Bézout's theorem and its generalization to the case of k algebraic hypersurfaces in k-dimensional projective space is the procedure of assigning the proper intersection multiplicities. If P is a common point of two plane algebraic curves X and Y that is a non-singular point of both of them and, moreover, the tangent lines to X and Y at P are distinct then the intersection multiplicity is one. This corresponds to the case of \"transversal intersection\". If the curves X and Y have a common tangent at P then the multiplicity is at least two. See intersection number for the definition in general.\n\nExamples\nTwo distinct non-parallel lines (in the same plane) always meet in exactly one point. Two parallel lines intersect at a unique point that lies at infinity. To see how this works algebraically, in projective space, the lines  and  are represented by the homogeneous equations  and .  Solving, we get  and , corresponding to the point (-2:1:0) in homogeneous coordinates.  As the z-coordinate is 0, this point lies on the line at infinity.\nThe special case where one of the curves is a line can be derived from the fundamental theorem of algebra. In this case the theorem states that an algebraic curve of degree n intersects a given line in n points, counting the multiplicities. For example, the parabola defined by     has degree 2; the line  has degree 1, and they meet in exactly two points when a ≠ 0 and touch at the origin (intersect with multiplicity two) when a = 0.\n Two conic sections generally intersect in four points, some of which may coincide. To properly account for all intersection points, it may be necessary to allow complex coordinates and include the points on the infinite line in the projective plane. For example:\n\nTwo circles never intersect in more than two points in the plane, while Bézout's theorem predicts four.  The discrepancy comes from the fact that every circle passes through the same two complex points on the line at infinity. Writing the circle\n\nin homogeneous coordinates, we get\n\nfrom which it is clear that the two points (1:i:0) and (1:-i:0) lie on every circle.  When two circles don't meet at all in the real plane, the two other intersections have non-zero imaginary parts, or if they are concentric then they meet at exactly the two points on the line at infinity with an intersection multiplicity of two.\nAny conic should meet the line at infinity at two points according to the theorem. A hyperbola meets it at two real points corresponding to the two directions of the asymptotes.  An ellipse meets it at two complex points which are conjugate to one another---in the case of a circle, the points (1:i:0) and (1:-i:0).  A parabola meets it at only one point, but it is a point of tangency and therefore counts twice.\nThe following pictures show examples in which the circle x2+y2-1=0 meets another ellipse in fewer intersection points because at least one of them has multiplicity greater than 1:\ntwo intersections of multiplicity 2an intersection of multiplicity 3an intersection of multiplicity 4245px245px245px\n\nSketch of proof\n\nWrite the equations for X and Y in homogeneous coordinates as\n\nwhere ai and bi are homogeneous polynomials of degree i in x and y. The points of intersection of X and Y correspond to the solutions of the system of equations. Form the Sylvester matrix; in the case m=4, n=3 this is\n\nThe determinant |S| of S, which is also called the resultant of the two polynomials, is 0 exactly when the two equations have a common solution in z. The terms of |S|, for example (a0)n(bn)m, all have degree mn, so |S| is a homogeneous polynomial of degree mn in x and y (recall that ai and bi are themselves polynomials). By the fundamental theorem of algebra, this can be factored into mn linear factors so there are mn solutions to the system of equations. The linear factors correspond to the lines that join the origin to the points of intersection of the curves.Follows Plane Algebraic Curves by Harold Hilton  (Oxford 1920) p. 10\n\nSee also\nAF+BG theorem\nBKK theorem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n Alternative translation of earlier (2nd) edition of Newton's Principia.\n (generalization of theorem) http://mathoverflow.net/questions/42127/generalization-of-bezouts-theorem\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Bezout's Theorem at MathPages\n\nCategory:Theorems in plane geometry\nCategory:Incidence geometry\nCategory:Intersection theory\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry"

      "text": "300px|thumb|Image for 9-points theorem, special case, when both  and  are unions of 3 lines\nIn mathematics, the Cayley–Bacharach theorem is a statement about cubic curves (plane curves of degree three) in the projective plane . The original form states:\n\nAssume that two cubics  and  in the projective plane meet in nine (different) points, as they do in general over an algebraically closed field. Then every cubic that passes through any eight of the points also passes through the ninth point.\n\nA more intrinsic form of the Cayley–Bacharach theorem reads as follows:\n\nEvery cubic curve  on an algebraically closed field that passes through a given set of eight points  also passes through a certain (fixed) ninth point , counting multiplicities.\n\nA related result on conics was first proved by the French geometer Michel Chasles and later generalized to cubics by Arthur Cayley and .\n\n Details \nIf seven of the points  lie on a conic, then the ninth point can be chosen on that conic, since  will always contain the whole conic on account of Bézout's theorem. In other cases, we have the following.\n\nIf no seven points out of  are co-conic, then the vector space of cubic homogeneous polynomials that vanish on (the affine cones of)  (with multiplicity for double points) has dimension two.\n\nIn that case, every cubic through  also passes through the intersection of any two different cubics through , which has at least nine points (over the algebraic closure) on account of Bézout's theorem. These points cannot be covered by  only, which gives us .\n\nSince degenerate conics are a union of at most two lines, there are always four out of seven points on a degenerate conic that are collinear. Consequently:\n\nIf no seven points out of  lie on a non-degenerate conic, and no four points out of  lie on a line, then the vector space of cubic homogeneous polynomials that vanish on (the affine cones of)  has dimension two.\n\nOn the other hand, assume  are collinear and no seven points out of  are co-conic. Then no five points of  and no three points of  are collinear. Since  will always contain the whole line through  on account of Bézout's theorem, the vector space of cubic homogeneous polynomials that vanish on (the affine cones of)  is isomorphic to the vector space of quadratic homogeneous polynomials that vanish (the affine cones of) , which has dimension two.\n\nAlthough the sets of conditions for both dimension two results are different, they are both strictly weaker than full general positions: three points are allowed to be collinear, and six points are allowed to lie on a conic (in general two points determine a line and five points determine a conic). For the Cayley–Bacharach theorem, it is necessary to have a family of cubics passing through the nine points, rather than a single one.\n\nAccording to Bézout's theorem, two different cubic curves over an algebraically closed field which have no common irreducible component meet in exactly nine points (counted with multiplicity). The Cayley–Bacharach theorem thus asserts that the last point of intersection of any two members in the family of curves does not move if eight intersection points (without seven co-conic ones) are already prescribed.\n\n Applications \nA special case is Pascal's theorem, in which case the two cubics in question are all degenerate: given six points on a conic (a hexagon), consider the lines obtained by extending opposite sides – this yields two cubics of three lines each, which intersect in 9 points – the 6 points on the conic, and 3 others. These 3 additional points lie on a line, as the conic plus the line through any two of the points is a cubic passing through 8 of the points.\n\nA second application is Pappus's hexagon theorem, similar to the above, but the six points are on two lines instead of on a conic.\n\nFinally, a third case is found on the associativity of the group of elliptic curves. Let a first cubic contain the three lines BC, O(A+B) and A(B+C); and a second cubic containing the three lines AB, O(B+C) and C(A+B). The following eight points are common to both cubics: A, B, C, A+B, -A-B, B+C, -B-C, O. Hence their ninth points must be the same -A-(B+C)=-(A+B)-C, giving the associativity.\n\n Dimension counting \nOne can understand the Cayley–Bacharach theorem, and why it arises for degree 3, by dimension counting. Simply stated, nine points determine a cubic, but in general define a unique cubic. Thus if the nine points lie on more than one cubic, equivalently on the intersection of two cubics (as ), they are not in general position – they are overdetermined by one dimension – and thus cubics passing through them satisfying one additional constraint, as reflected in the \"eight implies nine\" property. The general phenomenon is called superabundance; see Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces.\n\n Details \nFormally, first recall that given two curves of degree , they define a pencil (one-parameter linear system) of degree  curves by taking projective linear combinations of the defining equations; this corresponds to two points determining a projective line in the parameter space of curves, which is simply projective space.\n\nThe Cayley–Bacharach theorem arises for high degree because the number of intersection points of two curves of degree , namely  (by Bézout's theorem), grows faster than the number of points needed to define a curve of degree , which is given by\n\nThese first agree for , which is why the Cayley–Bacharach theorem occurs for cubics, and for higher degree  is greater, hence the higher degree generalizations.\n\nIn detail, the number of points required to determine a curve of degree  is the number of monomials of degree , minus 1 from projectivization. For the first few  these yield:\n  2 and 1: two points determine a line, two lines intersect in a point,\n  5 and 4: five points determine a conic, two conics intersect in four points,\n  9 and 9: nine points determine a cubic, two cubics intersect in nine points,\n  14 and 16.\nThus these first agree for 3, and the number of intersections is larger when .\n\nThe meaning of this is that the 9 points of intersection of two cubics are in special position with respect to cubics, a fortiori for higher degree, but unlike for lower degree: two lines intersect in a point, which is trivially in general linear position, and two quadratics intersect in four points, which (assuming the quadratics are irreducible so no three points are collinear) are in general quadratic position because five points determine a quadratic, and any four points (in general linear position) have a pencil of quadratics through them, since the system is underdetermined. For cubics, nine points determine a cubic, but in general they determine a unique cubic – thus having two different cubics pass through them (and thus a pencil) is special – the solution space is one dimension higher than expected, and thus the solutions satisfy an additional constraint, namely the \"8 implies 9\" property.\n\nMore concretely, because the vector space of homogeneous polynomials  of degree three in three variables  has dimension , the system of cubic curves passing through eight (different) points is parametrized by a vector space of dimension  (the vanishing of the polynomial at one point imposes a single linear condition). It can be shown that the dimension is exactly two if no four of the points are collinear and no seven points lie on a conic. The Cayley–Bacharach theorem can be deduced from this fact .\n\nReferences\n\n Michel Chasles, Traité des sections coniques, Gauthier-Villars, Paris, 1885.\n\n \n Edward D. Davis, Anthony V.

      "text": "In mathematics, the ELSV formula, named after its four authors Torsten Ekedahl, Sergei Lando, Michael Shapiro, Alek Vainshtein, is an equality between a Hurwitz number (counting ramified coverings of the sphere) and an integral over the moduli space of stable curves.\n\nSeveral fundamental results in the intersection theory of moduli spaces of curves can be deduced from the ELSV formula, including the Witten conjecture, the Virasoro constraints, and the -conjecture.\n\nIt is generalized by the Gopakumar–Mariño–Vafa formula.\n\n The formula \nDefine the Hurwitz number\n\nas the number of ramified coverings of the complex projective line (Riemann sphere,  that are connected curves of genus g, with n numbered preimages of the point at infinity having multiplicities  and m more simple branch points. Here if a covering has a nontrivial automorphism group G it should be counted with weight .\n\nThe ELSV formula then reads\n\n \n\nHere the notation is as follows:\n\n  is a nonnegative integer;\n  is a positive integer;\n  are positive integers;\n  is the number of automorphisms of the n-tuple \n \n  is the moduli space of stable curves of genus g  with n marked points;\n E is the Hodge vector bundle and c(E*) the total Chern class of its dual vector bundle;\n ψi is the first Chern class of the cotangent line bundle to the i-th marked point.\n\nThe numbers\n\nin the left-hand side have a combinatorial definition and satisfy properties that can be proved combinatorially. Each of these properties translates into a statement on the  integrals on the right-hand side of the ELSV formula .\n\n The Hurwitz numbers \nThe Hurwitz numbers\n\nalso have a definition in purely algebraic terms. With K = k1 + ... + kn and m = K + n + 2g − 2, let τ1, ..., τm be transpositions in the symmetric group SK and σ a permutation with n numbered cycles of lengths k1, ..., kn. Then\n\nis a transitive factorization of identity of type (k1, ..., kn) if the product\n\nequals the identity permutation and the group generated by\n\nis transitive.\n\nDefinition.  is the number of transitive factorization of identity of type (k1, ..., kn) divided by K!.\n\nExample A. The number  is 1/k! times the number of lists of transpositions  whose product is a k-cycle. In other words,  is 1/k times the number of factorizations of a given k-cycle into a product of k + 2g − 1 transpositions.\n\nThe equivalence between the two definitions of Hurwitz numbers (counting ramified coverings of the sphere, or counting transitive factorizations) is established by describing a ramified covering by its monodromy. More precisely: choose a base point on the sphere, number its preimages from 1 to K (this introduces a factor of K!, which explains the division by it), and consider the monodromies of the covering about the branch point. This leads to a transitive factorization.\n\n The integral over the moduli space \nThe moduli space  is a smooth Deligne–Mumford stack of (complex) dimension 3g − 3 + n. (Heuristically this behaves much like complex manifold, except that integrals of characteristic classes that are integers for manifolds are rational numbers for Deligne–Mumford stacks.)\n\nThe Hodge bundle E is the rank g vector bundle over the moduli space  whose fiber over a curve (C, x1, ..., xn) with n marked points is the space of abelian differentials on C. Its Chern classes are denoted by\n\nWe have\n\nThe ψ-classes. Introduce line bundles  over . The fiber of  over a curve (C, x1, ..., xn) is the cotangent line to C at xi. The first Chern class of  is denoted by\n\nThe integrand. The fraction  is interpreted as , where the sum can be cut at degree 3g − 3 + n (the dimension of the moduli space). Thus the integrand is a product of n + 1 factors. We expand this product, extract from it the part of degree 3g − 3 + n and integrate it over the moduli space.\n\nThe integral as a polynomial. It follows that the integral\n\nis a symmetric polynomial in variables k1, ..., kn, whose monomials have degrees between 3g − 3 + n and 2g − 3 + n. The coefficient of the monomial  equals\n\nwhere \n\nRemark. The polynomiality of the numbers\n\nwas first conjectured by I. P. Goulden and D. M. Jackson. No proof independent from the ELSV formula is known.\n\nExample B. Let g = n = 1. Then\n\n Example \nLet n = g = 1.  To simplify the notation, denote k1 by k. We have m = K + n + 2g − 2 = k + 1.\n\nAccording to Example B, the ELSV formula in this case reads\n\nOn the other hand, according to Example A, the Hurwitz number h1, k equals 1/k times the number of ways to decompose a k-cycle in the symmetric group Sk into a product of k + 1 transpositions. In particular, h1, 1 = 0 (since there are no transpositions in S1), while h1, 2 = 1/2 (since there is a unique factorization of the transposition (1 2) in S2 into a product of three transpositions).\n\nPlugging these two values into the ELSV formula we find\n\nFrom which we deduce\n\n History \nThe ELSV formula was announced by , but with an erroneous sign.  proved it for k1 = ... = kn = 1 (with the corrected sign).  proved the formula in full generality using the localization techniques. The proof announced by the four initial authors followed . Now that the space of stable maps to the projective line relative to a point has been constructed by , a proof can be obtained immediately by applying the virtual localization to this space.\n\n, building on preceding work of several people, gave a unified way to deduce most known results in the intersection theory of  from the ELSV formula.\n\n Idea of proof \nLet  be the space of stable maps f from a genus g curve to P1(C) such that f has exactly n poles of orders .\n\nThe branching morphism br or the Lyashko–Looijenga map assigns to  the unordered set of its m branch points in C with multiplicities taken into account. Actually, this definition only works if f is a smooth map. But it has a natural extension to the space of stable maps. For instance, the value of f on a node is considered a double branch point, as can be seen by looking at the family of curves Ct given by the equation xy = t and the family of maps ft(x, y) = x + y. As t → 0, two branch points of ft tend towards the value of f0 at the node of C0.\n\nThe branching morphism is of finite degree, but has infinite fibers. Our aim is now to compute its degree in two different ways.\n\nThe first way is to count the preimages of a generic point in the image. In other words, we count the ramified coverings of P1(C) with a branch point of type (k1, ..., kn) at ∞ and m more fixed simple branch points. This is precisely the Hurwitz number .\n\nThe second way to find the degree of br is to look at the preimage of the most degenerate point, namely, to put all m branch points together at 0 in C.\n\nThe preimage of this point in  is an infinite fiber of br isomorphic to the moduli space . Indeed, given a stable curve with n marked points we send this curve to 0 in P1(C) and attach to its marked points n rational components on which the stable map has the form . Thus we obtain all stable maps in  unramified outside 0 and ∞. Standard methods of algebraic geometry allow one to find the degree of a map by looking at an infinite fiber and its normal bundle. The result is expressed as an integral of certain characteristic classes over the infinite fiber. In our case this integral happens to be equal to the right-hand side of the ELSV formula.\n\nThus the ELSV formula expresses the equality between two ways to compute the degree of the branching morphism.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Algebraic curves\nCategory:Moduli theory\nCategory:Permutations\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry"

      "text": "thumb|Grothendieck's comment on the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem\nIn mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry, the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem is a far-reaching result on coherent cohomology. It is a generalisation of the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem, about complex manifolds, which is itself a generalisation of the classical Riemann–Roch theorem for line bundles on compact Riemann surfaces.\n\nRiemann–Roch type theorems relate Euler characteristics of the cohomology of a vector bundle with their topological degrees, or more generally their characteristic classes in (co)homology or algebraic analogues thereof. The classical Riemann–Roch theorem does this for curves and line bundles, whereas the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem generalises this to vector bundles over manifolds. The Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem sets both theorems in a relative situation of a morphism between two manifolds (or more general schemes) and changes the theorem from a statement about a single bundle, to one applying to chain complexes of sheaves.\n\nThe theorem has been very influential, not least for the development of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. Conversely, complex analytic analogues of the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem can be proved using the index theorem for families. Alexander Grothendieck gave a first proof in a 1957 manuscript, later published.A. Grothendieck. Classes de faisceaux et théorème de Riemann-Roch (1957). Published in SGA 6, Springer-Verlag (1971), 20-71. Armand Borel and Jean-Pierre Serre wrote up and published Grothendieck's proof in 1958.A. Borel and J.-P. Serre. Bull. Soc. Math. France 86 (1958), 97-136. Later, Grothendieck and his collaborators simplified and generalized the proof.SGA 6, Springer-Verlag (1971).\n\nFormulation\nLet X be a smooth quasi-projective scheme over a field. Under these assumptions, the Grothendieck group\n\nof bounded complexes of coherent sheaves is canonically isomorphic to the Grothendieck group of bounded complexes of finite-rank vector bundles. Using this isomorphism, consider the Chern character (a rational combination of Chern classes) as a functorial transformation\n\nwhere\n\nis the Chow group of cycles on X of dimension d modulo rational equivalence, tensored with the rational numbers. In case X is defined over the complex numbers, the latter group maps to the topological cohomology group\n\nNow consider a proper morphism\n\nbetween smooth quasi-projective schemes and a bounded complex of sheaves  on \n\nThe Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem relates the pushforward map\n\nand the pushforward\n\nby the formula\n\n \nHere td(X) is the Todd genus of (the tangent bundle of) X. Thus the theorem gives a precise measure for the lack of commutativity of taking the push forwards in the above senses and the Chern character and shows that the needed correction factors depend on X and Y only. In fact, since the Todd genus is functorial and multiplicative in exact sequences, we can rewrite the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch formula as\n\nwhere Tf is the relative tangent sheaf of f, defined as the element TX − f*TY in K0(X). For example, when f is a smooth morphism, Tf is simply a vector bundle, known as the tangent bundle along the fibers of f.\n\nUsing A1-homotopy theory, the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem has been extended by  to the situation where f is a proper map between two smooth schemes.\n\nGeneralising and specialising\n\nGeneralisations of the theorem can be made to the non-smooth case by considering an appropriate generalisation of the combination ch(—)td(X) and to the non-proper case by considering cohomology with compact support. \n  \nThe arithmetic Riemann–Roch theorem extends the Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem to arithmetic schemes.\n\nThe Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is (essentially) the special case where Y is a point and the field is the field of complex numbers.\n\nThe version of Riemann-Roch theorem for oriented cohomology theories was proven by I. Panin and A. Smirnov. It is concerned with multiplicative operations between algebraic oriented cohomology theories (like Algebraic cobordism). The Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch is a particular case of it, and the Chern character comes up naturally in that setting., see 4.2.10 and 4.2.11\n\n History \n\nAlexander Grothendieck's version of the Riemann–Roch theorem was originally conveyed in a letter to Jean-Pierre Serre around 1956–7. It was made public at the initial Bonn Arbeitstagung, in 1957. Serre and Armand Borel subsequently organized a seminar at Princeton to understand it. The final published paper was in effect the Borel–Serre exposition.\n\nThe significance of Grothendieck's approach rests on several points.  First, Grothendieck changed the statement itself: the theorem was, at the time, understood to be a theorem about a variety, whereas Grothendieck saw it as a theorem about a morphism between varieties. By finding the right generalization, the proof became simpler while the conclusion became more general. In short, Grothendieck applied a strong categorical approach to a hard piece of analysis.  Moreover, Grothendieck introduced K-groups, as discussed above, which paved the way for algebraic K-theory.\n\n See also \nKawasaki's Riemann–Roch formula\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n The Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch Theorem\n The thread \"how does one understand GRR?

      "text": "Hilbert's Nullstellensatz (German for \"theorem of zeros,\" or more literally, \"zero-locus-theorem\"—see Satz) is a theorem that establishes a fundamental relationship between geometry and algebra. This relationship is the basis of algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics. It relates algebraic sets to ideals in polynomial rings over algebraically closed fields. This relationship was discovered by David Hilbert who proved the Nullstellensatz and several other important related theorems named after him (like Hilbert's basis theorem).\n\n Formulation \nLet k be a field (such as the rational numbers) and K be an algebraically closed field extension (such as the complex numbers), consider the polynomial ring  and let I be an ideal in this ring. The algebraic set V(I) defined by this ideal consists of all n-tuples x = (x1,...,xn) in Kn such that f(x) = 0 for all f in I. Hilbert's Nullstellensatz states that if p is some polynomial in  that vanishes on the algebraic set V(I), i.e. p(x) = 0 for all x in V(I), then there exists a natural number r such that pr is in I.\n\nAn immediate corollary is the \"weak Nullstellensatz\": The ideal  contains 1 if and only if the polynomials in I do not have any common zeros in Kn. It may also be formulated as follows: if I is a proper ideal in  then V(I) cannot be empty, i.e. there exists a common zero for all the polynomials in the ideal in every algebraically closed extension of k. This is the reason for the name of the theorem, which can be proved easily from the 'weak' form using the Rabinowitsch trick. The assumption of considering common zeros in an algebraically closed field is essential here; for example, the elements of the proper ideal (X2 + 1) in  do not have a common zero in \n\nWith the notation common in algebraic geometry, the Nullstellensatz can also be formulated as\n\nfor every ideal J. Here,  denotes the radical of J and I(U) is the ideal of all polynomials that vanish on the set U.\n\nIn this way, we obtain an order-reversing bijective correspondence between the algebraic sets in Kn and the radical ideals of  In fact, more generally, one has a Galois connection between subsets of the space and subsets of the algebra, where \"Zariski closure\" and \"radical of the ideal generated\" are the closure operators.\n\nAs a particular example, consider a point . Then . More generally,\n\nConversely, every maximal ideal of the polynomial ring  (note that  is algebraically closed) is of the form  for some .\n\nAs another example, an algebraic subset W in Kn is irreducible (in the Zariski topology) if and only if  is a prime ideal.\n\n Proof and generalization \nThere are many known proofs of the theorem. One proof  uses Zariski's lemma, which asserts that, if a field is finitely generated as an associative algebra over a field k, then it is a finite field extension of k (that is, it is also finitely generated as a vector space). Here is a sketch of this proof.\n\nLet  (k algebraically closed field), I an ideal of A and V the common zeros of I in . Clearly, . Let . Then  for some prime ideal  in A.

This means the existence or the non-existence of polynomials  such that .

To solve this problem, it suffices to provide an upper bound on the total degree of the : such a bound reduces the problem to a finite system of linear equations that may be solved by usual linear algebra techniques. Any such upper bound is called an effective Nullstellensatz.\n\nA related problem is the ideal membership problem, which consists in testing if a polynomial belongs to an ideal. For this problem also, a solution is provided by an upper bound on the degree of the . A general solution of the ideal membership problem provides an effective Nullstellensatz, at least for the weak form.\n\nIn 1925, Grete Hermann gave an upper bound for ideal membership problem that is doubly exponential in the number of variables. In 1982 Mayr and Meyer gave an example where the  have a degree that is at least double exponential, showing that every general upper bound for the ideal membership problem is doubly exponential in the number of variables.  \n\nSince most mathematicians at the time assumed the effective Nullstellensatz was at least as hard as ideal membership, few mathematicians sought a bound better than double-exponential.  In 1987, however, W. Dale Brownawell gave an upper bound for the effective Nullstellensatz that is simply exponential in the number of variables.  Brownawell's proof relied on analytic techniques valid only in characteristic 0, but, one year later, János Kollár gave a purely algebraic proof, valid in any characteristic, of a slightly better bound.\n\nIn the case of the weak Nullstellensatz, Kollár's bound is the following:\n\nLet  be polynomials in  variables, of total degree .

These all lie in the cohomology ring of X; by use of the fundamental class (or, in other words, integration over X) we can obtain numbers from classes in  The Hirzebruch formula asserts that\n\ntaken over all relevant j (so 0 ≤ j ≤ n), using the Chern character ch(E) in cohomology. In other words, the cross products are formed in the cohomology ring of all the 'matching' degrees that add up to 2n, where to 'massage' the Cj(E) a formal manipulation is done, setting\n\nand the total Chern class\n\nFormulated differently the theorem gives the equality\n\nwhere td(X) is the Todd class of the tangent bundle of X.\n\nSignificant special cases are when E is a complex line bundle, and when X is an algebraic surface (Noether's formula). Weil's Riemann–Roch theorem for vector bundles on curves, and the Riemann–Roch theorem for algebraic surfaces (see below), are included in its scope. The formula also expresses in a precise way the vague notion that the Todd classes are in some sense reciprocals of characteristic classes.\n\nRiemann Roch theorem for curves\nFor curves, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the classical Riemann–Roch theorem. To see this, recall that for each divisor D on a curve there is an invertible sheaf O(D) (which corresponds to a line bundle) such that the linear system of D is more or less the space of sections of O(D). For curves the Todd class is  and the Chern character of a sheaf O(D) is just 1+c1(O(D)), so the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem states that\n\n  (integrated over X).\n\nBut h0(O(D)) is just l(D), the dimension of the linear system of D, and by Serre duality h1(O(D)) = h0(O(K − D)) = l(K − D) where K is the canonical divisor. Moreover, c1(O(D)) integrated over X is the degree of D, and c1(T(X)) integrated over X is the Euler class 2 − 2g of the curve X, where g is the genus. So we get the classical Riemann Roch theorem\n\n \n\nFor vector bundles V, the Chern character is rank(V) + c1(V), so we get Weil's Riemann Roch theorem for vector bundles over curves:\n\n \n\nRiemann Roch theorem for surfaces\n\nFor surfaces, the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem is essentially the Riemann–Roch theorem for surfaces\n\n \n\ncombined with the Noether formula.\n\nIf we want, we can use Serre duality to express h2(O(D)) as h0(O(K − D)), but unlike the case of curves there is in general no easy way to write the h1(O(D)) term in a form not involving sheaf cohomology (although in practice it often vanishes).\n\nAsymptotic Riemann-Roch\n\nLet D be an ample Cartier divisor on an irreducible projective variety X of dimension n.

A group for which the maximum is achieved is called a Hurwitz group, and the corresponding Riemann surface a Hurwitz surface. Because compact Riemann surfaces are synonymous with non-singular complex projective algebraic curves, a Hurwitz surface can also be called a Hurwitz curve.Technically speaking, there is an equivalence of categories between the category of compact Riemann surfaces with the orientation-preserving conformal maps and the category of non-singular complex projective algebraic curves with the algebraic morphisms. The theorem is named after Adolf Hurwitz, who proved it in .\n\nHurwitz's bound also holds for algebraic curves over a field of characteristic 0, and over fields of positive characteristic p>0 for groups whose order is coprime to p, but can fail over fields of positive characteristic p>0 when p divides the group order. For example,  the double cover of the projective line y2 = xp −x branched at all points defined over the prime field has genus g=(p−1)/2 but is acted  on by the group SL2(p) of  order p3−p.\n\n Interpretation in terms of hyperbolicity \n\nOne of the fundamental themes in differential geometry is a trichotomy between the Riemannian manifolds of positive, zero, and negative curvature K. It manifests itself in many diverse situations and on several levels. In the context of compact Riemann surfaces X, via the Riemann uniformization theorem, this can be seen as a distinction between the surfaces of different topologies:\n X a sphere, a compact Riemann surface of genus zero with K > 0;\n X a flat torus, or an elliptic curve, a Riemann surface of genus one with  K = 0;\n and X a hyperbolic surface, which has genus greater than one and K < 0.\n\nWhile in the first two cases the surface X admits infinitely many conformal automorphisms (in fact, the conformal automorphism group is a complex Lie group of dimension three for a sphere and of dimension one for a torus), a hyperbolic Riemann surface only admits a discrete set of automorphisms. Hurwitz's theorem claims that in fact more is true: it provides a uniform bound on the order of the automorphism group as a function of the genus and characterizes those Riemann surfaces for which the bound is sharp.\n\nStatement and proof\n\nTheorem: Let  be a smooth connected Riemann surface of genus . Then its automorphism group  has size at most \n\nProof: Assume for now that  is finite (we'll prove this at the end).\n Consider the quotient map . Since  acts by holomorphic functions, the quotient is locally of the form  and the quotient   is a smooth Riemann surface. The quotient map  is a branched cover, and we will see below that the ramification points correspond to the orbits that have a non trivial stabiliser. Let  be the genus of .\n By the Riemann-Hurwitz formula,\n\nwhere the sum is over the  ramification points  for the quotient map. The ramification index  at  is just the order of the stabiliser group, since  where  the number of pre-images of  (the number of points in the orbit), and . By definition of ramification points,  for all  ramification indices. \n\nNow call the righthand side  and note that since  we must have . Rearranging the equation we find:\n If  then , and \n If , then   and  so that , \n If , then  and\n if  then , so that \n if  then , so that ,\n if  then write . We may assume . \n if  then  so that ,\n if  then \n if  then  so that ,\n if  then  so that .\nIn conclusion, .\n\nTo show that  is finite, note that  acts on the cohomology  preserving the Hodge decomposition and the lattice .\nIn particular, its action on  gives a homomorphism  with discrete image .\nIn addition, the image  preserves the natural non degenerate Hermitian inner product  on . In particular the image  is contained in the unitary group  which is compact. Thus the image  is not just discrete, but finite.  \n It remains to prove that  has finite kernel. In fact, we will prove  is injective. Assume  acts as the identity on . If  is finite, then by the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, \n .\nThis is a contradiction, and so  is infinite. Since  is a closed complex sub variety of positive dimension and  is a smooth connected curve (i.e. ), we must have . Thus  is the identity, and we conclude that  is injective and  is finite.\nQ.E.D.\n\nCorollary of the proof: A Riemann surface  of genus  has  automorphisms if and only if  is a branched cover  with three ramification points, of indices 2,3 and 7.\n\n The idea of another proof and construction of the Hurwitz surfaces \n\nBy the uniformization theorem, any hyperbolic surface  X – i.e., the Gaussian curvature of  X  is equal to negative one at every point – is covered by the hyperbolic plane. The conformal mappings of the surface correspond to orientation-preserving automorphisms of the hyperbolic plane. By the Gauss–Bonnet theorem, the area of the surface is\n\n A(X) = − 2π χ(X) = 4π(g − 1).\n\nIn order to make the automorphism group G of X as large as possible, we want the area of its fundamental domain D for this action to be as small as possible. If the fundamental domain is a triangle with the vertex angles π/p, π/q and π/r, defining a tiling of the hyperbolic plane, then p, q, and r are integers greater than one, and the area is \n \n A(D) = π(1 − 1/p − 1/q − 1/r).\n\nThus we are asking for integers which make the expression\n\n1 − 1/p − 1/q − 1/r\n\nstrictly positive and as small as possible. This minimal value is 1/42, and\n\n1 − 1/2 − 1/3 − 1/7 = 1/42\n\ngives a unique (up to permutation) triple of such integers. This would indicate that the order |G| of the automorphism group is bounded by\n\n A(X)/A(D)  ≤  168(g − 1).\n\nHowever, a more delicate reasoning shows that this is an overestimate by the factor of two, because the group G can contain orientation-reversing transformations. For the orientation-preserving conformal automorphisms the bound is  84(g − 1).\n\n Construction \nthumb|Hurwitz groups and surfaces are constructed based on the tiling of the hyperbolic plane by the (2,3,7) Schwarz triangle.\nTo obtain an example of a Hurwitz group, let us start with a (2,3,7)-tiling of the hyperbolic plane. Its full symmetry group is the full (2,3,7) triangle group generated by the reflections across the sides of a single fundamental triangle with the angles π/2, π/3 and π/7. Since a reflection flips the triangle and changes the orientation, we can join the triangles in pairs and obtain an orientation-preserving tiling polygon.\nA Hurwitz surface is obtained by 'closing up' a part of this infinite tiling of the hyperbolic plane to a compact Riemann surface of genus g. This will necessarily involve exactly 84(g − 1) double triangle tiles.\n\nThe following two regular tilings have the desired symmetry group; the rotational group corresponds to rotation about an edge, a vertex, and a face, while the full symmetry group would also include a reflection. Note that the polygons in the tiling are not fundamental domains – the tiling by (2,3,7) triangles refines both of these and is not regular.\n100pxorder-3 heptagonal tiling100pxorder-7 triangular tiling\nWythoff constructions yields further uniform tilings, yielding eight uniform tilings, including the two regular ones given here. These all descend to Hurwitz surfaces, yielding tilings of the surfaces (triangulation, tiling by heptagons, etc.).\n\nFrom the arguments above it can be inferred that a Hurwitz group G is characterized by the property that it is a finite quotient of the group with two generators a and b and three relations\n\nthus G is a finite group generated by two elements of orders two and three, whose product is of order seven. More precisely, any Hurwitz surface, that is, a hyperbolic surface that realizes the maximum order of the automorphism group for the surfaces of a given genus, can be obtained by the construction given. \nThis is the last part of the theorem of Hurwitz.\n\n Examples of Hurwitz groups and surfaces \nthumb|The small cubicuboctahedron is a polyhedral immersion of the tiling of the Klein quartic by 56 triangles, meeting at 24 vertices. Note each face in the polyhedron consist of multiple faces in the tiling – two triangular faces constitute a square face and so forth, as per this explanatory image.\n\nThe smallest Hurwitz group is the projective special linear group PSL(2,7), of order 168, and the corresponding curve is the Klein quartic curve.  This group is also isomorphic to PSL(3,2).\n\nNext is the Macbeath curve, with automorphism group PSL(2,8) of order 504. Many more finite simple groups are Hurwitz groups; for instance all but 64 of the alternating groups are Hurwitz groups, the largest non-Hurwitz example being of degree 167. The smallest alternating group that is a Hurwitz group is A15.\n\nMost projective special linear groups of large rank are Hurwitz groups, . For lower ranks, fewer such groups are Hurwitz.  For np the order of p modulo 7, one has that PSL(2,q) is Hurwitz if and only if either q=7 or q = pnp.  Indeed, PSL(3,q) is Hurwitz if and only if q = 2, PSL(4,q) is never Hurwitz, and PSL(5,q) is Hurwitz if and only if q = 74 or q = pnp, .\n\nSimilarly, many groups of Lie type are Hurwitz.  The finite classical groups of large rank are Hurwitz, .  The exceptional Lie groups of type G2 and the Ree groups of type 2G2 are nearly always Hurwitz, .  Other families of exceptional and twisted Lie groups of low rank are shown to be Hurwitz in .\n\nThere are 12 sporadic groups that can be generated as Hurwitz groups: the Janko groups J1, J2 and J4, the Fischer groups Fi22 and Fi'24, the Rudvalis group, the Held group, the Thompson group, the Harada–Norton group, the third Conway group Co3, the Lyons group, and  the Monster, .\n\nAutomorphism groups in low genus\n\nThe largest |Aut(X)| can get for a Riemann surface X of genus g is shown below, for 2≤g≤10, along with a surface X0 with |Aut(X0)| maximal. \n genus g   Largest possible Aut(X)  X0  Aut(X0) 2 48  Bolza curve GL2(3) 3  168 (Hurwitz bound)Klein quartic  PSL2(7) 4120  Bring curve  S5  5  192   6  150   7  504 (Hurwitz bound)Macbeath curve PSL2(8) 8 336    9  320   10 432   11 240   \nIn this range, there only exists a Hurwitz curve in genus g=3 and g=7.\n\nSee also\n(2,3,7) triangle group\n\n Notes \n\nReferences\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry\nCategory:Riemann surfaces\nCategory:Theorems in group theory\nCategory:Theorems in complex geometry"

      "text": "In mathematics, the Kodaira vanishing theorem is a basic result of complex manifold theory and complex algebraic geometry, describing general conditions under which sheaf cohomology groups with indices q > 0 are automatically zero. The implications for the group with index q = 0 is usually that its dimension — the number of independent global sections — coincides with a holomorphic Euler characteristic that can be computed using the Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem.\n\n The complex analytic case \nThe statement of Kunihiko Kodaira's result is that if M is a compact Kähler manifold of complex dimension n, L any holomorphic line bundle on M that is positive, and KM is the canonical line bundle, then\n\nfor q > 0. Here  stands for the tensor product of line bundles. By means of Serre duality, one also obtains the vanishing of  for q < n.  There is a generalisation, the Kodaira–Nakano vanishing theorem, in which , where Ωn(L) denotes the sheaf of holomorphic (n,0)-forms on M with values on L, is replaced by Ωr(L), the sheaf of holomorphic (r,0)-forms with values on L. Then the cohomology group Hq(M, Ωr(L)) vanishes whenever q + r > n.\n\n The algebraic case \nThe Kodaira vanishing theorem can be formulated within the language of algebraic geometry without any reference to transcendental methods such as Kähler metrics. Positivity of the line bundle L translates into the corresponding invertible sheaf being ample (i.e., some tensor power gives a projective embedding). The algebraic Kodaira–Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem is the following statement:\n If k is a field of characteristic zero, X is a smooth and projective k-scheme of dimension d, and L is an ample invertible sheaf on X, then \n\n where the Ωp denote the sheaves of relative (algebraic) differential forms (see Kähler differential). \n showed that this result does not always hold  over fields of characteristic p > 0, and in particular fails for Raynaud surfaces.\n\nUntil 1987 the only known proof in characteristic zero was however based on the complex analytic proof and the GAGA comparison theorems. However, in 1987 Pierre Deligne and Luc Illusie gave a purely algebraic proof of the vanishing theorem in . Their proof is based on showing that the Hodge–de Rham spectral sequence for algebraic de Rham cohomology degenerates in degree 1. This is shown by lifting a corresponding more specific result from characteristic p > 0 — the positive-characteristic result does not hold without limitations but can be lifted to provide the full result.\n\nConsequences and applications\nHistorically, the Kodaira embedding theorem was derived with the help of the vanishing theorem. With application of Serre duality, the vanishing of various sheaf cohomology groups (usually related to the canonical line bundle) of curves and surfaces help with the classification of complex manifolds, e.g. Enriques–Kodaira classification.\n\nSee also\n Kawamata–Viehweg vanishing theorem\n Mumford vanishing theorem\n Ramanujam vanishing theorem\n\nReferences\n \n\nPhillip Griffiths and Joseph Harris, Principles of Algebraic Geometry\n\nCategory:Theorems in complex geometry\nCategory:Topological methods of algebraic geometry\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry"

      "text": "In mathematics, specifically in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology, the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem is a precise statement of certain relations between the shape of an algebraic variety and the shape of its subvarieties. More precisely, the theorem says that for a variety X embedded in projective space and a hyperplane section Y, the homology, cohomology, and homotopy groups of X determine those of Y. A result of this kind was first stated by Solomon Lefschetz for homology groups of complex algebraic varieties. Similar results have since been found for homotopy groups, in positive characteristic, and in other homology and cohomology theories.\n\nA far-reaching generalization of the hard Lefschetz theorem is given by the decomposition theorem.\n\n The Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for complex projective varieties \nLet X be an n-dimensional complex projective algebraic variety in CPN, and let Y be a hyperplane section of X such that U = X ∖ Y is smooth. The Lefschetz theorem refers to any of the following statements:\n The natural map Hk(Y, Z) → Hk(X, Z) in singular homology is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is surjective for k = n − 1.\n The natural map Hk(X, Z) → Hk(Y, Z) in singular cohomology is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is injective for k = n − 1.\n The natural map πk(Y, Z) → πk(X, Z) is an isomorphism for k < n − 1 and is surjective for k = n − 1.\nUsing a long exact sequence, one can show that each of these statements is equivalent to a vanishing theorem for certain relative topological invariants. In order, these are:\n The relative singular homology groups Hk(X, Y, Z) are zero for .\n The relative singular cohomology groups Hk(X, Y, Z) are zero for .\n The relative homotopy groups πk(X, Y) are zero for .\n\n Lefschetz's proof \nSolomon Lefschetz used his idea of a Lefschetz pencil to prove the theorem. Rather than considering the hyperplane section Y alone, he put it into a family of hyperplane sections Yt, where Y = Y0. Because a generic hyperplane section is smooth, all but a finite number of Yt are smooth varieties. After removing these points from the t-plane and making an additional finite number of slits, the resulting family of hyperplane sections is topologically trivial. That is, it is a product of a generic Yt with an open subset of the t-plane. X, therefore, can be understood if one understands how hyperplane sections are identified across the slits and at the singular points. Away from the singular points, the identification can be described inductively. At the singular points, the Morse lemma implies that there is a choice of coordinate system for X of a particularly simple form. This coordinate system can be used to prove the theorem directly.\n\n Andreotti and Frankel's proof \nAldo Andreotti and Theodore Frankel recognized that Lefschetz's theorem could be recast using Morse theory. Here the parameter t plays the role of a Morse function. The basic tool in this approach is the Andreotti–Frankel theorem, which states that a complex affine variety of complex dimension n (and thus real dimension 2n) has the homotopy type of a CW-complex of (real) dimension n. This implies that the relative homology groups of Y in X are trivial in degree less than n. The long exact sequence of relative homology then gives the theorem.\n\n Thom's and Bott's proofs \nNeither Lefschetz's proof nor Andreotti and Frankel's proof directly imply the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem for homotopy groups. An approach that does was found by René Thom no later than 1957 and was simplified and published by Raoul Bott in 1959. Thom and Bott interpret Y as the vanishing locus in X of a section of a line bundle. An application of Morse theory to this section implies  that X can be constructed from Y by adjoining cells of dimension n or more. From this, it follows that the relative homology and homotopy groups of Y in X are concentrated in degrees n and higher, which yields the theorem.\n\n Kodaira and Spencer's proof for Hodge groups \nKunihiko Kodaira and Donald C. Spencer found that under certain restrictions, it is possible to prove a Lefschetz-type theorem for the Hodge groups Hp,q. Specifically, assume that Y is smooth and that the line bundle  is ample. Then the restriction map Hp,q(X) → Hp,q(Y) is an isomorphism if  and is injective if p + q = n − 1. By Hodge theory, these cohomology groups are equal to the sheaf cohomology groups  and .  Therefore, the theorem follows from applying the Akizuki–Nakano vanishing theorem to  and using a long exact sequence.\n\nCombining this proof with the universal coefficient theorem nearly yields the usual Lefschetz theorem for cohomology with coefficients in any field of characteristic zero. It is, however, slightly weaker because of the additional assumptions on Y.\n\n Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible sheaves \nMichael Artin and Alexander Grothendieck found a generalization of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem to the case where the coefficients of the cohomology lie not in a field but instead in a constructible sheaf. They prove that for a constructible sheaf F on an affine variety U, the cohomology groups  vanish whenever .\n\n The Lefschetz theorem in other cohomology theories \nThe motivation behind Artin and Grothendieck's proof for constructible sheaves was to give a proof that could be adapted to the setting of étale and -adic cohomology. Up to some restrictions on the constructible sheaf, the Lefschetz theorem remains true for constructible sheaves in positive characteristic.\n\nThe theorem can also be generalized to intersection homology. In this setting, the theorem holds for highly singular spaces.\n\nA Lefschetz-type theorem also holds for Picard groups.\n\nHard Lefschetz theorem\n\nLet X be a n-dimensional non-singular complex projective variety in .\nThen in the cohomology ring of X, the k-fold product with the cohomology class of a hyperplane gives an isomorphism between  and .\n\nThis is the hard Lefschetz theorem, christened in French by Grothendieck more colloquially as the Théorème de Lefschetz vache.  It immediately implies the injectivity part of the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem.\n\nThe hard Lefschetz theorem in fact holds for any compact Kähler manifold, with the isomorphism in de Rham cohomology given by multiplication by a power of the class of the Kähler form. It can fail for non-Kähler manifolds: for example, Hopf surfaces have vanishing second cohomology groups, so there is no analogue of the second cohomology class of a hyperplane section.\n\nThe hard Lefschetz theorem was proven for -adic cohomology of smooth projective varieties over algebraically closed fields of positive characteristic by .\n\n References \n\n Bibliography \n \n \n \n\n \n \n  Reprinted in \n \n \n \n\nCategory:Topological methods of algebraic geometry\nCategory:Morse theory\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic topology"

The first Chern class c1 gives a map from holomorphic line bundles to . By Hodge theory, the de Rham cohomology group H2(X, C) decomposes as a direct sum , and it can be proven that the image of c1 lies in H1,1(X).

Thus, this establishes the usual formulation of the Hodge conjecture for divisors in projective varieties.\n\n Proof using normal functions \nLefschetz's original proof worked on projective surfaces and used normal functions, which were introduced by Poincaré. Suppose that Ct is a pencil of curves on X. Each of these curves has a Jacobian variety JCt (if a curve is singular, there is an appropriate generalized Jacobian variety). These can be assembled into a family , the Jacobian of the pencil, which comes with a projection map π to the base T of the pencil. A normal function is a (holomorphic) section of π.\n\nFix an embedding of X in PN, and choose a pencil of curves Ct on X.  For a fixed curve Γ on X, the intersection of Γ and Ct is a divisor  on Ct, where d is the degree of X. Fix a base point p0 of the pencil.  Then the divisor  is a divisor of degree zero, and consequently it determines a class νΓ(t) in the Jacobian JCt for all t. The map from t to νΓ(t) is a normal function. \n\nHenri Poincaré proved that for a general pencil of curves, all normal functions arose as νΓ(t) for some choice of Γ. Lefschetz proved that any normal function determined a class in H2(X, Z) and that the class of νΓ is the fundamental class of Γ. Furthermore, he proved that a class in H2(X, Z) is the class of a normal function if and only if it lies in H1,1. Together with Poincaré's existence theorem, this proves the theorem on (1,1)-classes.\n\n Proof using sheaf cohomology \nBecause X is a complex manifold, it admits an exponential sheaf sequence\n\nTaking sheaf cohomology of this exact sequence gives maps\n\nThe group  of line bundles on X is isomorphic to . The first Chern class map is c1 by definition, so it suffices to show that i* is zero.\n\nBecause X is Kähler, Hodge theory implies that . However, i* factors through the map from H2(X, Z) to H2(X, C), and on H2(X, C), i* is the restriction of the projection onto H0,2(X). It follows that it is zero on , and consequently that the cycle class map is surjective.\n\n References \n\n Bibliography \n \n  Reprinted in \n\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry"

      "text": "In mathematics, the modularity theorem (formerly called the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture) states that elliptic curves over the field of rational numbers are related to  modular forms.  Andrew Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which was enough to imply Fermat's last theorem. Later, Christophe Breuil, Brian Conrad, Fred Diamond and Richard Taylor extended Wiles' techniques to prove the full modularity theorem in 2001.\n\nStatement\nThe theorem states that any elliptic curve over Q can be obtained via a rational map with integer coefficients from the classical modular curve  for some integer N; this is a curve with integer coefficients with an explicit definition. This mapping is called a modular parametrization of level N.  If N is the smallest integer for which such a parametrization can be found (which by the modularity theorem itself is now known to be a number called the conductor), then the parametrization may be defined in terms of a mapping generated by a particular kind of modular form of weight two and level N, a normalized newform with integer q-expansion, followed if need be by an isogeny.\n\nThe modularity theorem implies a closely related analytic statement: to an elliptic curve E over Q we may attach a corresponding L-series. The L-series is a Dirichlet series, commonly written\n\nThe generating function of the coefficients  is then\n\nIf we make the substitution\n\nwe see that we have written the Fourier expansion of a function  of the complex variable τ, so the coefficients of the q-series are also thought of as the Fourier coefficients of . The function obtained in this way is, remarkably, a cusp form of weight two and level N and is also an eigenform (an eigenvector of all Hecke operators); this is the Hasse–Weil conjecture, which follows from the modularity theorem.\n\nSome  modular forms of weight two, in turn, correspond to  holomorphic differentials for an elliptic curve. The Jacobian of the modular curve can (up to isogeny) be written as a product of irreducible Abelian varieties, corresponding to Hecke eigenforms of weight 2. The 1-dimensional factors are elliptic curves (there can also be higher-dimensional factors, so not all Hecke eigenforms correspond to rational elliptic curves). The curve obtained by finding the corresponding cusp form, and then constructing a curve from it, is isogenous to the original curve (but not, in general, isomorphic to it).\n\nHistory\n stated a preliminary (slightly incorrect) version of the conjecture  at the 1955 international symposium on algebraic number theory in Tokyo and Nikkō.  Goro Shimura and Taniyama worked on improving its rigor until 1957.    rediscovered the conjecture, and showed that it would follow from the (conjectured) functional equations for some twisted L-series of the elliptic curve; this was the first serious evidence that the conjecture might be true.  Weil also showed that the conductor of the elliptic curve should be the level of the corresponding modular form. The Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture became a part of the Langlands program.\n\nThe conjecture attracted considerable interest when  suggested that the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture implies Fermat's Last Theorem. He did this by attempting to show that any counterexample to Fermat's Last Theorem would imply the existence of at least one non-modular elliptic curve. This argument was completed when  identified a missing link (now known as the epsilon conjecture or Ribet's theorem) in Frey's original work, followed two years later by 's completion of a proof of the epsilon conjecture.\n\nEven after gaining serious attention, the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was seen by contemporary mathematicians as extraordinarily difficult to prove or perhaps even inaccessible to proof . For example, Wiles' ex-supervisor John Coates states that it seemed \"impossible to actually prove\", and Ken Ribet considered himself \"one of the vast majority of people who believed [it] was completely inaccessible\".\n\n, with some help from Richard Taylor, proved  the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture for all semistable elliptic curves, which he used to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, and the full Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture was finally proved by , , and  who, building on Wiles' work, incrementally chipped away at the remaining cases until the full result was proved. \n\nOnce fully proven, the conjecture became known as the modularity theorem.\n\nSeveral theorems in number theory similar to Fermat's Last Theorem follow from the modularity theorem. For example: no cube can be written as a sum of two coprime n-th powers, n ≥ 3. (The case n = 3 was already known by Euler.)\n\nGeneralizations\nThe modularity theorem is a special case of more general conjectures due to Robert Langlands. The Langlands program seeks to attach an automorphic form or automorphic representation (a suitable generalization of a modular form) to more general objects of arithmetic algebraic geometry, such as to every elliptic curve over a number field.  Most cases of these extended conjectures have not yet been proved. However,  proved that elliptic curves defined over real quadratic fields are modular.\n\n References \n\nContains a gentle introduction to the theorem and an outline of the proof.\n\n Discusses the Taniyama–Shimura–Weil conjecture 3 years before it was proven for infinitely many cases.\n\n English translation in \n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nCategory:Algebraic curves\nCategory:Riemann surfaces\nCategory:Modular forms\nCategory:Theorems in number theory\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry\nCategory:Conjectures that have been proved\nCategory:1995 in mathematics"

      "text": "In mathematics, the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion states that if A is an elliptic curve or abelian variety  over a local field K and ℓ is a prime  not dividing the characteristic of the residue field of K then A has good reduction if and only if the ℓ-adic Tate module Tℓ of A is unramified.  introduced the criterion for elliptic curves.  used the results of  to extend it to abelian varieties,\nand named the criterion after Ogg, Néron and Igor Shafarevich (commenting that Ogg's result seems to have been known to Shafarevich).\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Abelian varieties\nCategory:Elliptic curves\nCategory:Theorems in algebraic geometry"
