      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''congruence lattice problem''' asks whether every algebraic [[distributive lattice]] is [[isomorphic]] to the [[congruence lattice]] of some other lattice. The problem was posed by [[Robert P. Dilworth]], and for many years it was one of the most famous and long-standing open problems in [[lattice theory]]; it had a deep impact on the development of lattice theory itself. The conjecture that every distributive lattice is a congruence lattice is true for all distributive lattices with at most [[Aleph number|ℵ<sub>1</sub>]] [[compact element]]s, but F. Wehrung provided a counterexample for distributive lattices with ℵ<sub>2</sub> compact elements using a construction based on [[Kuratowski's free set theorem]].\n\n==Preliminaries==\nWe denote by Con ''A'' the congruence lattice of an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] ''A'', that is, the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] of all [[Congruence relation|congruences]] of ''A'' under inclusion.\n\nThe following is a [[Universal algebra|universal-algebraic]] triviality. It says that for a congruence, being finitely generated is a lattice-theoretical property.\n\n'''Lemma.'''\nA congruence of an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] ''A'' is finitely generated if and only if it is a [[compact element]] of Con ''A''.\n\nAs every congruence of an algebra is the join of the finitely generated congruences below it (e.g., every [[Module (mathematics)|submodule]] of a [[module (mathematics)|module]] is the union of all its finitely generated submodules), we obtain the following result, first published by Birkhoff and Frink in 1948.\n\n'''Theorem (Birkhoff and Frink 1948).'''\nThe congruence lattice Con ''A'' of any algebra ''A'' is an [[compact element|algebraic lattice]].\n\nWhile congruences of lattices lose something in comparison to [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]] (they cannot be identified with [[subset]]s of the universe), they also have a property unique among all the other structures encountered yet.\n\n'''Theorem (Funayama and Nakayama 1942).'''\nThe congruence lattice of any lattice is [[Distributive lattice|distributive]].\n\nThis says that α ∧ (β ∨ γ) = (α ∧ β) ∨ (α ∧ γ), for any congruences α, β, and γ of a given lattice. The analogue of this result fails, for instance, for modules, as <math>A\\cap(B+C)\\neq(A\\cap B)+(A\\cap C)</math>, as a rule, for [[Module (mathematics)|submodules]] ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' of a given [[Module (mathematics)|module]].\n\nSoon after this result, [[Robert P. Dilworth|Dilworth]] proved the following result. He did not publish the result but it appears as an exercise credited to him in Birkhoff 1948. The first published proof is in Grätzer and Schmidt 1962.\n\n'''Theorem (Dilworth ≈1940, Grätzer and Schmidt 1962).'''\nEvery finite distributive lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some finite lattice.\n\nIt is important to observe that the solution lattice found in Grätzer and Schmidt's proof is ''sectionally complemented'', that is, it has a least element (true for any finite lattice) and for all elements ''a'' ≤ ''b'' there exists an element ''x'' with ''a'' ∨ ''x'' = ''b'' and ''a'' ∧ ''x'' = ''0''. It is also in that paper that CLP is first stated in published form, although it seems that the earliest attempts at CLP were made by Dilworth himself. Congruence lattices of finite lattices have been given an enormous amount of attention, for which a reference is Grätzer's 2005 monograph.\n\n----\n\n'''The congruence lattice problem (CLP):'''\nIs every distributive algebraic lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some lattice?\n\n----\n\nThe problem CLP has been one of the most intriguing and longest-standing open problems of lattice theory. Some related results of universal algebra are the following.\n\n'''Theorem (Grätzer and Schmidt 1963).'''\nEvery algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra.\n\nThe lattice Sub ''V'' of all subspaces of a [[vector space]] ''V'' is certainly an algebraic lattice. As the next result shows, these algebraic lattices are difficult to represent.\n\n'''Theorem (Freese, Lampe, and Taylor 1979).'''\nLet ''V'' be an infinite-dimensional vector space over an [[uncountable]] [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''F''. Then Con ''A'' isomorphic to Sub ''V'' implies that ''A'' has at least card ''F'' operations, for any algebra ''A''.\n\nAs ''V'' is infinite-dimensional, the largest element (''unit'') of Sub ''V'' is not compact. However innocuous it sounds, the compact unit assumption is essential in the statement of the result above, as demonstrated by the following result.\n\n'''Theorem (Lampe 1982).'''\nEvery algebraic lattice with compact unit is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some [[Magma (algebra)|groupoid]].\n\n==Semilattice formulation of CLP==\nThe congruence lattice Con ''A'' of an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] ''A'' is an [[Compact element|algebraic lattice]]. The (∨,0)-[[semilattice]] of [[compact element]]s of Con ''A'' is denoted by Con<sub>c</sub> ''A'', and it is sometimes called the ''congruence semilattice'' of ''A''. Then Con ''A'' is isomorphic to the [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal lattice]] of Con<sub>c</sub> ''A''. By using the classical [[Equivalence of categories|equivalence]] between the category of all (∨,0)-semilattices and the category of all algebraic lattices (with suitable definitions of [[morphisms]]), as it is outlined [[Semilattice|here]], we obtain the following semilattice-theoretical formulation of CLP.\n\n----\n\n'''Semilattice-theoretical formulation of CLP:'''\nIs every [[Distributivity (order theory)|distributive]] (∨,0)-semilattice isomorphic to the congruence semilattice of some lattice?\n\n----\n\nSay that a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is ''representable'', if it is isomorphic to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for some lattice ''L''. So CLP asks whether every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is representable.\n\nMany investigations around this problem involve ''diagrams'' of semilattices or of algebras. A most useful folklore result about these is the following.\n\n'''Theorem.'''\nThe functor Con<sub>c</sub>, defined on all algebras of a given [[signature (logic)|signature]], to all (∨,0)-semilattices, [[Limit (category theory)|preserves direct limits]].\n\n==Schmidt's approach via distributive join-homomorphisms==\nWe say that a (∨,0)-semilattice satisfies ''Schmidt's Condition'', if it is isomorphic to the quotient of a [[generalized Boolean semilattice]] ''B'' under some [[Distributive homomorphism|distributive join-congruence]] of ''B''. One of the deepest results about representability of (∨,0)-semilattices is the following.\n\n'''Theorem (Schmidt 1968).'''\nAny (∨,0)-semilattice satisfying Schmidt's Condition is representable.\n\nThis raised the following problem, stated in the same paper.\n\n----\n\n'''Problem 1 (Schmidt 1968).'''\nDoes any (∨,0)-semilattice satisfiy Schmidt's Condition?\n\n----\n\nPartial positive answers are the following.\n\n'''Theorem (Schmidt 1981).'''\nEvery distributive ''lattice'' with zero satisfies Schmidt's Condition; thus it is representable.\n\nThis result has been improved further as follows, ''via'' a very long and technical proof, using forcing and Boolean-valued models.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 2003).'''\nEvery [[direct limit]] of a countable sequence of distributive ''lattices'' with zero and (∨,0)-homomorphisms is representable.\n\nOther important representability results are related to the [[cardinality]] of the semilattice. The following result was prepared for publication by Dobbertin after Huhn's passing away in 1985. The two corresponding papers were published in 1989.\n\n'''Theorem (Huhn 1985).''' Every distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality at most ℵ<sub>1</sub> satisfies Schmidt's Condition. Thus it is representable.\n\nBy using different methods, Dobbertin got the following result.\n\n'''Theorem (Dobbertin 1986).'''\nEvery distributive (∨,0)-semilattice in which every principal [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal]] is at most [[countable]] is representable.\n\n----\n'''Problem 2 (Dobbertin 1983).''' Is every [[Refinement monoid|conical refinement monoid measurable]]?\n----\n\n==Pudlák's approach; lifting diagrams of (∨,0)-semilattices==\nThe approach of CLP suggested by Pudlák in his 1985 paper is different. It is based on the following result, Fact 4, p.&nbsp;100 in Pudlák's 1985 paper, obtained earlier by Ju.L. Ershov as the main theorem in Section 3 of the Introduction of his 1977 monograph.\n\n'''Theorem (Ershov 1977, Pudlák 1985).'''\nEvery distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is the directed union of its finite distributive (∨,0)-subsemilattices.\n\nThis means that every finite subset in a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice ''S'' is contained in some finite ''distributive'' (∨,0)-subsemilattice of ''S''. Now we are trying to represent a given distributive (∨,0)-semilattice ''S'' as Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for some lattice ''L''. Writing ''S'' as a directed union <math>S=\\bigcup(S_i\\mid i\\in I)</math> of finite distributive (∨,0)-subsemilattices, we are ''hoping'' to represent each ''S<sub>i</sub>'' as the congruence lattice of a lattice ''L<sub>i</sub>'' with lattice homomorphisms ''f<sub>i</sub><sup>j</sup> : L<sub>i</sub>→ L<sub>j</sub>'', for ''i ≤ j'' in ''I'', such that the diagram <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> of all ''S<sub>i</sub>'' with all inclusion maps ''S<sub>i</sub>→S<sub>j</sub>'', for ''i ≤ j'' in ''I'', is [[Equivalence of categories|naturally equivalent]] to <math>(\\mathrm{Con_c}\\,L_i,\\mathrm{Con_c}\\,f_i^j\\mid i\\leq j\\text{ in }I)</math>, we say that the diagram <math>(L_i,f_i^j\\mid i\\leq j\\text{ in }I)</math> lifts <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> (with respect to the Con<sub>c</sub> functor). If this can be done, then, as we have seen that the Con<sub>c</sub> functor preserves direct limits, the direct limit <math>L=\\varinjlim_{i\\in I}L_i</math> satisfies <math>{\\rm Con_c}\\,L\\cong S</math>.\n\nWhile the problem whether this could be done in general remained open for about 20 years, Pudlák could prove it for distributive ''lattices'' with zero, thus extending one of Schmidt's results by providing a ''functorial'' solution.\n\n'''Theorem (Pudlák 1985).'''\nThere exists a direct limits preserving functor Φ, from the category of all distributive lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings to the category of all lattices with zero and 0-lattice embeddings, such that Con<sub>c</sub>Φ is [[Equivalence of categories|naturally equivalent]] to the identity. Furthermore, Φ(''S'') is a finite [[Lattice (order)|atomistic lattice]], for any finite distributive (∨,0)-semilattice ''S''.\n\nThis result is improved further, by an even far more complex construction, to ''locally finite, sectionally complemented modular lattices'' by Růžička in 2004 and 2006.\n\nPudlák asked in 1985 whether his result above could be extended to the whole category of distributive (∨,0)-semilattices with (∨,0)-embeddings. The problem remained open until it was recently solved in the negative by Tůma and Wehrung.\n\n'''Theorem (Tůma and Wehrung 2006).'''\nThere exists a [[Diagram (category theory)|diagram]] ''D'' of finite Boolean (∨,0)-semilattices and (∨,0,1)-embeddings, indexed by a finite partially ordered set, that cannot be lifted, with respect to the Con<sub>c</sub> functor, by any diagram of lattices and lattice homomorphisms.\n\nIn particular, this implies immediately that CLP has no ''functorial'' solution.\nFurthermore, it follows from deep 1998 results of universal algebra by Kearnes and Szendrei in so-called ''commutator theory of varieties'' that the result above can be extended from the variety of all lattices to any variety <math>\\mathcal{V}</math> such that all Con ''A'', for <math>A\\in\\mathcal{V}</math>, satisfy a fixed nontrivial identity in the signature (∨,∧) (in short, ''with a nontrivial congruence identity'').\n\nWe should also mention that many attempts at CLP were also based on the following result, first proved by Bulman-Fleming and McDowell in 1978 by using a categorical 1974 result of Shannon, see also Goodearl and Wehrung in 2001 for a direct argument.\n\n'''Theorem (Bulman-Fleming and McDowell 1978).'''\nEvery distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is a direct limit of finite [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]] (∨,0)-semilattices and (∨,0)-homomorphisms.\n\nIt should be observed that while the transition homomorphisms used in the Ershov-Pudlák Theorem are (∨,0)-embeddings, the transition homomorphisms used in the result above are not necessarily one-to-one, for example when one tries to represent the three-element chain. Practically this does not cause much trouble, and makes it possible to prove the following results.\n\n'''Theorem.'''\nEvery distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality at most ℵ<sub>1</sub> is isomorphic to\n\n(1) Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for some locally finite, relatively complemented modular lattice ''L'' (Tůma 1998 and Grätzer, Lakser, and Wehrung 2000).\n\n(2) The semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of some (not necessarily unital) von Neumann regular ring (Wehrung 2000).\n\n(3) Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for some sectionally complemented modular lattice ''L'' (Wehrung 2000).\n\n(4) The semilattice of finitely generated [[normal subgroup]]s of some [[locally finite group]] (Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung 2006).\n\n(5) The submodule lattice of some right module over a (non-commutative) ring (Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung 2006).\n\n==Congruence lattices of lattices and nonstable K-theory of von Neumann regular rings==\nWe recall that for a (unital, associative) [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', we denote by ''V(R)'' the (conical, commutative) monoid of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective right ''R''-modules, see [[Refinement monoid|here]] for more details. Recall that if ''R'' is von [[Von Neumann regular ring|Neumann regular]], then ''V(R)'' is a [[refinement monoid]]. Denote by Id<sub>c</sub> ''R'' the (∨,0)-semilattice of finitely generated [[Ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideals]] of ''R''. We denote by ''L(R)'' the lattice of all principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring ''R''. It is well known that ''L(R)'' is a [[Complemented lattice|complemented]] [[modular lattice]].\n\nThe following result was observed by Wehrung, building on earlier works mainly by Jónsson and Goodearl.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 1999).'''\nLet ''R'' be a von Neumann regular ring. Then the (∨,0)-semilattices Id<sub>c</sub> ''R'' and Con<sub>c</sub> ''L(R)'' are both isomorphic to the [[maximal semilattice quotient]] of ''V(R)''.\n\nBergman proves in a well-known unpublished note from 1986 that any at most countable distributive (∨,0)-semilattice is isomorphic to Id<sub>c</sub> ''R'', for some [[Refinement monoid|locally matricial]] ring ''R'' (over any given field). This result is extended to semilattices of cardinality at most ℵ<sub>1</sub> in 2000 by Wehrung, by keeping only the regularity of ''R'' (the ring constructed by the proof is not locally matricial). The question whether ''R'' could be taken locally matricial in the ℵ<sub>1</sub> case remained open for a while, until it was disproved by Wehrung in 2004. Translating back to the lattice world by using the theorem above and using a lattice-theoretical analogue of the ''V(R)'' construction, called the ''dimension monoid'', introduced by Wehrung in 1998, yields the following result.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 2004).'''\nThere exists a distributive (∨,0,1)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ<sub>1</sub> that is not isomorphic to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for any modular lattice ''L'' every finitely generated sublattice of which has finite length.\n\n----\n'''Problem 3 (Goodearl 1991).''' Is the positive cone of any [[Refinement monoid|dimension group]] with [[Monoid|order-unit]] isomorphic to ''V(R)'', for some von Neumann regular ring ''R''?\n----\n\n==A first application of Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem==\nThe abovementioned Problem 1 (Schmidt), Problem 2 (Dobbertin), and Problem 3 (Goodearl) were solved simultaneously in the negative in 1998.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 1998).'''\nThere exists a [[Refinement monoid|dimension vector space]] ''G'' over the rationals with [[Monoid|order-unit]] whose positive cone ''G''<sup>+</sup> is not isomorphic to ''V(R)'', for any von Neumann regular ring ''R'', and is not [[Refinement monoid|measurable]] in Dobbertin's sense. Furthermore, the [[maximal semilattice quotient]] of ''G''<sup>+</sup> does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. Furthermore, ''G'' can be taken of any given cardinality greater than or equal to ℵ<sub>2</sub>.\n\nIt follows from the previously mentioned works of Schmidt, Huhn, Dobbertin, Goodearl, and Handelman that the ℵ<sub>2</sub> bound is optimal in all three negative results above.\n\nAs the ℵ<sub>2</sub> bound suggests, infinite combinatorics are involved. The principle used is [[Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem]], first published in 1951. Only the case ''n=2'' is used here.\n\nThe semilattice part of the result above is achieved ''via'' an infinitary semilattice-theoretical statement URP (''Uniform Refinement Property''). If we want to disprove Schmidt's problem, the idea is (1) to prove that any generalized Boolean semilattice satisfies URP (which is easy), (2) that URP is preserved under homomorphic image under a weakly distributive homomorphism (which is also easy), and (3) that there exists a distributive (∨,0)-semilattice of cardinality ℵ<sub>2</sub> that does not satisfy URP (which is difficult, and uses Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem).\n\nSchematically, the construction in the theorem above can be described as follows. For a set Ω, we consider the partially ordered vector space ''E(Ω)'' defined by generators 1 and ''a<sub>i,x</sub>'', for ''i<2'' and ''x'' in Ω, and relations ''a<sub>0,x</sub>+a<sub>1,x</sub>=1'', ''a<sub>0,x</sub> ≥ 0'', and ''a<sub>1,x</sub> ≥ 0'', for any ''x'' in Ω. By using a Skolemization of the theory of dimension groups, we can embed ''E(Ω)'' functorially into a [[Refinement monoid|dimension vector space]] ''F(Ω)''. The vector space counterexample of the theorem above is ''G=F(Ω)'', for any set Ω with at least ℵ<sub>2</sub> elements.\n\nThis counterexample has been modified subsequently by Ploščica and Tůma to a direct semilattice construction. For a (∨,0)-semilattice, the larger semilattice ''R(S)'' is the (∨,0)-semilattice freely generated by new elements ''t(a,b,c)'', for ''a, b, c'' in ''S'' such that ''c ≤ a ∨ b'', subjected to the only relations ''c=t(a,b,c) ∨ t(b,a,c)'' and ''t(a,b,c) ≤ a''. Iterating this construction gives the ''free distributive extension'' <math>D(S)=\\bigcup(R^n(S)\\mid n<\\omega)</math> of ''S''. Now, for a set Ω, let ''L(Ω)'' be the (∨,0)-semilattice defined by generators 1 and ''a<sub>i,x</sub>'', for ''i<2'' and ''x'' in Ω, and relations ''a<sub>0,x</sub> ∨ a<sub>1,x</sub>=1'', for any ''x'' in Ω. Finally, put ''G(Ω)=D(L(Ω))''.\n\nIn most related works, the following ''uniform refinement property'' is used. It is a modification of the one introduced by Wehrung in 1998 and 1999.\n\n'''Definition (Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung 1998).'''\nLet ''e'' be an element in a (∨,0)-semilattice ''S''. We say that the ''weak uniform refinement property'' WURP holds at ''e'', if for all families <math>(a_i)_{i\\in I}</math> and <math>(b_i)_{i\\in I}</math> of elements in ''S'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub> ∨ b<sub>i</sub>=e'' for all ''i'' in ''I'', there exists a family <math>(c_{i,j}\\mid (i,j)\\in I\\times I)</math> of elements of ''S'' such that the relations\n\n• ''c<sub>i,j</sub> ≤ a<sub>i</sub>,b<sub>j</sub>'',\n\n• ''c<sub>i,j</sub> ∨ a<sub>j</sub> ∨ b<sub>i</sub>=e'',\n\n• ''c<sub>i,k</sub> ≤ c<sub>i,j</sub>∨ c<sub>j,k</sub>''\n\nhold for all ''i, j, k'' in ''I''. We say that ''S'' satisfies WURP, if WURP holds at every element of ''S''.\n\nBy building on Wehrung's abovementioned work on dimension vector spaces, Ploščica and Tůma proved that WURP does not hold in ''G(Ω)'', for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ<sub>2</sub>. Hence ''G(Ω)'' does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. It is to be noted that all negative representation results mentioned here always make use of some ''uniform refinement property'', including the first one about dimension vector spaces.\n\nHowever, the semilattices used in these negative results are relatively complicated. The following result, proved by Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung in 1998, is more striking, because it shows examples of ''representable'' semilattices that do not satisfy Schmidt's Condition. We denote by F<sub>'''V'''</sub>(Ω) the free lattice on Ω in '''V''', for any variety '''V''' of lattices.\n\n'''Theorem (Ploščica, Tůma, and Wehrung 1998).'''\nThe semilattice Con<sub>c</sub> F<sub>'''V'''</sub>(Ω) does not satisfy WURP, for any set Ω of cardinality at least ℵ<sub>2</sub> and any non-distributive variety '''V''' of lattices. Consequently, Con<sub>c</sub> F<sub>'''V'''</sub>(Ω) does not satisfy Schmidt's Condition.\n\nIt is proved by Tůma and Wehrung in 2001 that Con<sub>c</sub> F<sub>'''V'''</sub>(Ω) is not isomorphic to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'', for any lattice ''L'' with [[congruence-permutable algebra|permutable congruences]]. By using a slight weakening of WURP, this result is extended to arbitrary [[Universal algebra|algebras]] with permutable congruences by Růžička, Tůma, and Wehrung in 2006. Hence, for example, if Ω has at least ℵ<sub>2</sub> elements, then Con<sub>c</sub> F<sub>'''V'''</sub>(Ω) is not isomorphic to the normal subgroup lattice of any group, or the submodule lattice of any module.\n\n==Solving CLP: the Erosion Lemma==\nThe following recent theorem solves CLP.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 2007).'''\nThe semilattice ''G(Ω)'' is not isomorphic to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'' for any lattice ''L'', whenever the set Ω has at least ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub> elements.\n\nHence, the counterexample to CLP had been known for nearly ten years, it is just that nobody knew why it worked! All the results prior to the theorem above made use of some form of permutability of congruences. The difficulty was to find enough structure in congruence lattices of non-congruence-permutable lattices.\n\nWe shall denote by ε the `parity function' on the natural numbers, that is, ε(''n'')=''n'' mod 2, for any natural number ''n''.\n\nWe let ''L'' be an [[Universal algebra|algebra]] possessing a structure of semilattice (''L'',∨) such that every congruence of ''L'' is also a congruence for the operation ∨ . We put\n:<math> U\\vee V=\\{u\\vee v \\mid (u,v)\\in U\\times V\\},\\quad\n \\text{for all }U,V\\subseteq L,\n</math>\nand we denote by Con<sub>c</sub><sup>''U''</sup> ''L'' the (∨,0)-subsemilattice of Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'' generated by all principal congruences Θ(''u'',''v'') ( = least congruence of ''L'' that identifies ''u'' and ''v''), where (''u'',''v'') belongs to ''U'' ×''U''. We put Θ<sup>+</sup>(''u'',''v'')=Θ(''u ∨ v'',''v''), for all ''u, v'' in ''L''.br />\n\n'''The Erosion Lemma (Wehrung 2007).'''\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub> in ''L'' and let <math>Z=\\{z_0,z_1,\\dots,z_n\\}</math>, for a positive integer ''n'', be a finite subset of ''L'' with <math>\\bigvee_{i<n}z_i\\leq z_n</math>. Put\n:<math>\\alpha_j=\\bigvee(\\Theta_L(z_i,z_{i+1})\\mid i<n,\\ \\varepsilon(i)=j),\\text{ for all }j<2.</math>\nThen there are congruences <math>\\theta_j\\in\\mathrm{Con_c}^{\\{x_j\\}\\vee Z}L</math>, for ''j<2'', such that\n:<math> z_0\\vee x_0\\vee x_1\\equiv z_n\\vee x_0\\vee x_1\n \\pmod{\\theta_0\\vee\\theta_1}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\n \\theta_j\\subseteq\\alpha_j\\cap\\Theta_L^+(z_n,x_j),\\text{ for all }j<2.\n </math>\n\n(Observe the faint formal similarity with [[Resolution (logic)|first-order resolution]] in mathematical logic. Could this analogy be pushed further?)\n\nThe proof of the theorem above runs by setting a ''structure'' theorem for congruence lattices of semilattices—namely, the Erosion Lemma, against ''non-structure'' theorems for free distributive extensions ''G(Ω)'', the main one being called the ''Evaporation Lemma''. While the latter are technically difficult, they are, in some sense, predictable. Quite to the contrary, the proof of the Erosion Lemma is elementary and easy, so it is probably the strangeness of its statement that explains that it has been hidden for so long.\n\nMore is, in fact, proved in the theorem above: ''For any algebra L with a congruence-compatible structure of join-semilattice with unit and for any set Ω with at least ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub> elements, there is no weakly distributive homomorphism μ: Con<sub>c</sub> L → G(Ω) containing 1 in its range''. In particular, CLP was, after all, not a problem of lattice theory, but rather of [[universal algebra]]—even more specifically, [[Semilattice|''semilattice theory'']]! These results can also be translated in terms of a ''uniform refinement property'', denoted by CLR in Wehrung's paper presenting the solution of CLP, which is noticeably more complicated than WURP.\n\nFinally, the cardinality bound ℵ<sub>ω+1</sub> has been improved to the optimal bound ℵ<sub>2</sub> by Růžička.\n\n'''Theorem (Růžička 2008).'''\nThe semilattice ''G(Ω)'' is not isomorphic to Con<sub>c</sub> ''L'' for any lattice ''L'', whenever the set Ω has at least ℵ<sub>2</sub> elements.\n\nRůžička's proof follows the main lines of Wehrung's proof, except that it introduces an enhancement of [[Kuratowski's Free Set Theorem]], called there ''existence of free trees'', which it uses in the final argument involving the Erosion Lemma.\n\n==A positive representation result for distributive semilattices==\nThe proof of the negative solution for CLP shows that the problem of representing distributive semilattices by compact congruences of lattices already appears for congruence lattices of ''semilattices''. The question whether the structure of [[partially ordered set]] would cause similar problems is answered by the following result.\n\n'''Theorem (Wehrung 2008).''' For any distributive (∨,0)-semilattice ''S'', there are a (∧,0)-semilattice ''P'' and a map μ : ''P'' × ''P'' → ''S'' such that the following conditions hold:\n\n(1) ''x'' ≤ ''y'' implies that μ(''x'',''y'')=0, for all ''x'', ''y'' in ''P''.\n\n(2) μ(''x'',''z'') ≤ μ(''x'',''y'') ∨ μ(''y'',''z''), for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in ''P''.\n\n(3) For all ''x'' ≥ ''y'' in ''P'' and all α, β in ''S'' such that μ(''x'',''y'') ≤ α ∨ β, there are a positive integer ''n'' and elements ''x''=''z''<sub>0</sub> ≥ ''z''<sub>1</sub> ≥ ... ≥ ''z''<sub>2''n''</sub>=''y'' such that μ(''z''<sub>i</sub>'',''z''<sub>i+1</sub>'') ≤ α (resp., μ(''z''<sub>i</sub>'',''z''<sub>i+1</sub>'') ≤ β) whenever ''i'' < 2''n'' is even (resp., odd).\n\n(4) ''S'' is generated, as a join-semilattice, by all the elements of the form μ(''x'',0), for ''x'' in ''P''.\n\nFurthermore, if ''S'' has a largest element, then ''P'' can be assumed to be a lattice with a largest element.\n\nIt is not hard to verify that conditions (1)–(4) above imply the distributivity of ''S'', so the result above gives a ''characterization'' of distributivity for (∨,0)-semilattices.\n\n==References==\n*G.M.

      "text": "{{Refimprove|date=May 2011}}\nIn [[mathematics]],  a '''distributive lattice''' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] in which the operations of [[join and meet]] [[distributivity|distribute]] over each other. The prototypical examples of such structures are collections of sets for which the lattice operations can be given by set [[union (set theory)|union]] and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]. Indeed, these lattices of sets describe the scenery completely: every distributive lattice is&mdash;up to [[order isomorphism|isomorphism]]&mdash;given as such a lattice of sets.\n\n==Definition==\nAs in the case of arbitrary lattices, one can choose to consider a distributive lattice ''L'' either as a structure of [[order theory]] or of [[universal algebra]]. Both views and their mutual correspondence are discussed in the article on [[lattice (order)|lattices]]. In the present situation, the algebraic description appears to be more convenient:\n\nA lattice (''L'',∨,∧) is '''distributive''' if the following additional identity holds for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''L'':\n\n: ''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∨ ''z'') = (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∨ (''x'' ∧ ''z'').\n\nViewing lattices as partially ordered sets, this says that the meet operation [[Limit-preserving function (order theory)|preserves]] non-empty finite joins. It is a basic fact of lattice theory that the above condition is equivalent to its [[duality (order theory)|dual]]:<ref>{{cite book| author=Garrett Birkhoff| title=Lattice Theory| year=1967| volume=25| publisher=Am. Math. Soc.| series=Colloquium Publications}}; here: §5-6, p.8-12</ref>\n\n: ''x'' ∨ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') = (''x'' ∨ ''y'') ∧ (''x'' ∨ ''z'') &nbsp; for all ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' in ''L''.<ref>For individual elements ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', e.g. the first equation may be violated, but the second may hold; see the N<sub>5</sub> picture for an example.</ref>\n\nIn every lattice, defining ''p''≤''q'' as usual to mean ''p''∧''q''=''p'', the inequality ''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∨ ''z'') ≥ (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∨ (''x'' ∧ ''z'') holds as well as its dual inequality ''x'' ∨ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') ≤ (''x'' ∨ ''y'') ∧ (''x'' ∨ ''z''). A lattice is distributive if one of the converse inequalities holds, too.\nMore information on the relationship of this condition to other distributivity conditions of order theory can be found in the article on [[distributivity (order theory)]].\n\n== Morphisms ==\n\nA morphism of distributive lattices is just a lattice homomorphism as given in the article on [[lattice (order)|lattices]], i.e. a function that is compatible with the two lattice operations. Because such a morphism of lattices preserves the lattice structure, it will consequently also preserve the distributivity (and thus be a morphism of distributive lattices).\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Young's lattice.svg|thumb|[[Young's lattice]]]]\nDistributive lattices are ubiquitous but also rather specific structures. As already mentioned the main example for distributive lattices are lattices of sets, where join and meet are given by the usual set-theoretic operations. Further examples include:\n\n* The [[Lindenbaum–Tarski algebra|Lindenbaum algebra]] of most [[logic]]s that support [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] and [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] is a distributive lattice, i.e. \"and\" distributes over \"or\" and vice versa.\n* Every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a distributive lattice.\n* Every [[Heyting algebra]] is a distributive lattice. Especially this includes all [[complete Heyting algebra|locales]] and hence all [[open set]] lattices of [[topological space]]s. Also note that Heyting algebras can be viewed as Lindenbaum algebras of [[intuitionistic logic]], which makes them a special case of the first example.\n* Every [[Total order|totally ordered set]] is a distributive lattice with max as join and min as meet.\n* The [[natural number]]s form a (conditionally complete) distributive lattice by taking the [[greatest common divisor]] as meet and the [[least common multiple]] as join. This lattice also has a least element, namely 1, which therefore serves as the identity element for joins.\n* Given a positive integer ''n'', the set of all positive [[divisor]]s of ''n'' forms a distributive lattice, again with the greatest common divisor as meet and the least common multiple as join. This is a Boolean algebra if and only if ''n'' is [[Square-free integer|square-free]].\n* A [[Riesz space|lattice-ordered vector space]] is a distributive lattice.\n*[[Young's lattice]] given by the inclusion ordering of [[Young diagram#Diagrams|Young diagrams]] representing [[Partition (number theory)|integer partitions]] is a distributive lattice.\n\nEarly in the development of the lattice theory [[Charles S. Peirce]] believed that all lattices are distributive, that is, distributivity follows from the rest of the lattice axioms.<ref name=\"Fisch.Kloesel.Peirce.1989\">{{citation\n | first1 = Charles S. | last1 = Peirce | authorlink1 = Charles Sanders Peirce\n | first2 = M.

A lattice is distributive if and only if none of its sublattices is isomorphic to ''M''<sub>3</sub> or&nbsp;''N''<sub>5</sub>; a sublattice is a subset that is closed under the meet and join operations of the original lattice. Note that this is not the same as being a subset that is a lattice under the original order (but possibly with different join and meet operations). Further characterizations derive from the representation theory in the next section.\n\nFinally distributivity entails several other pleasant properties. For example, an element of a distributive lattice is [[Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|meet-prime]] if and only if it is [[Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|meet-irreducible]], though the latter is in general a weaker property. By duality, the same is true for [[Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|join-prime]] and [[Lattice (order)#Important lattice-theoretic notions|join-irreducible]] elements.<ref>See [[Birkhoff's representation theorem#The partial order of join-irreducibles]].</ref> If a lattice is distributive, its [[covering relation]] forms a [[median graph]].<ref>{{citation\n | first1 = Garrett | last1 = Birkhoff | authorlink1 = Garrett Birkhoff\n | first2 = S.

That set union and intersection are indeed distributive in the above sense is an elementary fact. The other direction is less trivial, in that it requires the representation theorems stated below. The important insight from this characterization is that the identities (equations) that hold in all distributive lattices are exactly the ones that hold in all lattices of sets in the above sense.\n\n[[Birkhoff's representation theorem]] for distributive lattices states that every ''finite'' distributive lattice is isomorphic to the lattice of [[Upper set|lower set]]s of the [[Partially ordered set|poset]] of its join-prime (equivalently: join-irreducible) elements. This establishes a [[bijection]] (up to [[isomorphism]]) between the class of all finite posets and the class of all finite distributive lattices. This bijection can be extended to a [[equivalence of categories|duality of categories]] between homomorphisms of finite distributive lattices and [[Monotonic function|monotone function]]s of finite posets. Generalizing this result to infinite lattices, however, requires adding further structure.\n\nAnother early representation theorem is now known as [[Stone's representation theorem for distributive lattices]] (the name honors [[Marshall Harvey Stone]], who first proved it). It characterizes distributive lattices as the lattices of [[Compact space|compact]] [[open set|open]] sets of certain [[topological space]]s. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Stone's famous [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|representation theorem for Boolean algebras]] and as a specialization of the general setting of [[Stone duality]].\n\nA further important representation was established by [[Hilary Priestley]] in her [[Priestley's representation theorem for distributive lattice|representation theorem for distributive lattices]]. In this formulation, a distributive lattice is used to construct a topological space with an additional partial order on its points, yielding a (completely order-separated) ''ordered [[Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras|Stone space]]'' (or ''[[Priestley space]]''). The original lattice is recovered as the collection of [[clopen set|clopen]] lower sets of this space.\n\nAs a consequence of Stone's and Priestley's theorems, one easily sees that any distributive lattice is really isomorphic to a lattice of sets. However, the proofs of both statements require the [[Boolean prime ideal theorem]], a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]].\n\n== Free distributive lattices ==\n[[File:Monotone Boolean functions.svg|thumb|360px|Free distributive lattices on zero, one, two, and three generators. The elements labeled \"0\" and \"1\" are the empty join and meet, and the element labeled \"majority\" is (''x'' ∧ ''y'') ∨ (''x'' ∧ ''z'') ∨ (''y'' ∧ ''z'') = (''x'' ∨ ''y'') ∧ (''x'' ∨ ''z'') ∧ (''y'' ∨ ''z'').]]\n\nThe [[free object|free]] distributive lattice over a set of generators ''G'' can be constructed much more easily than a general free lattice. The first observation is that, using the laws of distributivity, every term formed by the binary operations <math>\\lor</math> and <math>\\land</math> on a set of generators can be transformed into the following equivalent ''normal form'':\n\n:<math>M_1 \\lor M_2 \\lor \\cdots \\lor M_n,</math>\n\nwhere <math>M_i</math> are finite meets of elements of ''G''. Moreover, since both meet and join are [[associative]], [[Commutativity|commutative]] and [[Idempotence|idempotent]], one can ignore duplicates and order, and represent a join of meets like the one above as a set of sets:\n\n:<math>\\{N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_n\\},</math>\n\nwhere the <math>N_i</math> are finite subsets of ''G''. However, it is still possible that two such terms denote the same element of the distributive lattice. This occurs when there are indices ''j'' and ''k'' such that <math>N_j</math> is a subset of <math>N_k.</math> In this case the meet of <math>N_k</math> will be below the meet of <math>N_j,</math> and hence one can safely remove the ''redundant'' set <math>N_k</math> without changing the interpretation of the whole term. Consequently, a set of finite subsets of ''G'' will be called ''irredundant'' whenever all of its elements <math>N_i</math> are mutually incomparable (with respect to the subset ordering); that is, when it forms an [[Sperner family|antichain of finite sets]].\n\nNow the free distributive lattice over a set of generators ''G'' is defined on the set of all finite irredundant sets of finite subsets of ''G''. The join of two finite irredundant sets is obtained from their union by removing all redundant sets. Likewise the meet of two sets ''S'' and ''T'' is the irredundant version of <math>\\{N \\cup M | N \\in S, M \\in T\\}.</math> The verification that this structure is a distributive lattice with the required [[universal property]] is routine.\n\nThe number of elements in free distributive lattices with ''n'' generators is given by the [[Dedekind number]]s. These numbers grow rapidly, and are known only for ''n''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;8; they are\n:2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 {{OEIS|id=A000372}}.\nThe numbers above count the number of elements in free distributive lattices in which the lattice operations are joins and meets of finite sets of elements, including the empty set.

See image at right for an example. \n* A partition ''p'' [[Covering relation|cover]]s a partition ''q'' if and only if ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> + 1, ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> = ''q''<sub>''k''</sub> &minus; 1, ''p''<sub>''j''</sub> = ''q''<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''j'' &ne; ''i'',''k'' and either (1) ''k'' = ''i'' + 1 or (2) ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''q''<sub>''k''</sub> (Brylawski, Prop. 2.3). Starting from the [[Young diagram]] of ''q'',  the Young diagram of ''p'' is obtained from it by first removing the last box of row ''k'' and then appending it either to the end of the immediately preceding row ''k'' &minus; 1, or to the end of row ''i'' < ''k'' if the rows ''i'' through ''k'' of the Young diagram of ''q'' all have the same length.\n* Every partition ''p'' has a [[Partition (number theory)#Ferrers diagram|conjugate]] (or dual) partition ''p''&prime;, whose Young diagram is the transpose of the Young diagram of ''p''. This operation reverses the dominance ordering:\n:: <math>p\\trianglelefteq q </math> if and only if <math>q^{\\prime}\\trianglelefteq p^{\\prime}.</math>\n* The dominance ordering determines the inclusions between the [[Zariski closure]]s of the conjugacy classes of [[nilpotent orbit#Poset structure|nilpotent matrices]].\n\n== Lattice structure ==\n\nPartitions of ''n'' form a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] under the dominance ordering, denoted ''L''<sub>''n''</sub>, and the operation of conjugation is an [[Antihomomorphism|antiautomorphism]] of this lattice. To explicitly describe the lattice operations, for each partition ''p'' consider the '''associated (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-tuple''':\n\n: <math> \\hat{p}=(0, p_1, p_1+p_2, \\ldots, p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_n). </math>\n\nThe partition ''p'' can be recovered from its associated (''n''+1)-tuple by applying the step 1 [[finite difference|difference]], <math>p_i=\\hat{p}_i-\\hat{p}_{i-1}.</math> Moreover, the (''n''+1)-tuples associated to partitions of ''n'' are characterized among all integer sequences of length ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 by the following three properties:\n\n* Nondecreasing, <math>\\hat{p}_i\\leq \\hat{p}_{i+1};</math>\n* Concave, <math>2\\hat{p}_i\\geq \\hat{p}_{i-1}+\\hat{p}_{i+1};</math>\n* The initial term is 0 and the final term is ''n'', <math>\\hat{p}_0=0, \\hat{p}_n=n.</math>\n\nBy the definition of the dominance ordering, partition ''p'' precedes partition ''q'' if and only if the associated (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-tuple of ''p'' is term-by-term less than or equal to the associated (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-tuple of ''q''. If ''p'', ''q'', ''r'' are partitions then <math>r\\trianglelefteq p, r\\trianglelefteq q</math> if and only if <math>\\hat{r}\\leq\\hat{p}, \\hat{r}\\leq\\hat{q}.</math> The componentwise minimum of two nondecreasing concave integer sequences is also nondecreasing and concave. Therefore, for any two partitions of ''n'', ''p'' and ''q'', their [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] is the partition of ''n'' whose associated (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-tuple has components <math>\\operatorname{min}(\\hat{p}_i,\\hat{q}_i).</math> The natural idea to use a similar formula for the [[join (mathematics)|join]] ''fails'', because the componentwise maximum of two concave sequences need not be concave. For example, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;6, the partitions [3,1,1,1] and [2,2,2] have associated sequences (0,3,4,5,6,6,6) and (0,2,4,6,6,6,6), whose componentwise maximum (0,3,4,6,6,6,6) does not correspond to any partition. To show that any two partitions of ''n'' have a join, one uses the conjugation antiautomorphism: the join of ''p'' and ''q'' is the conjugate partition of the meet of ''p''&prime; and ''q''&prime;:\n\n: <math> p\\lor q=(p^{\\prime} \\land q^{\\prime})^{\\prime}. </math>\n\nFor the two partitions ''p'' and ''q'' in the preceding example, their conjugate partitions are [4,1,1] and [3,3] with meet [3,2,1], which is self-conjugate; therefore, the join of ''p'' and ''q'' is [3,2,1].\n\nThomas Brylawski has determined many invariants of the lattice ''L''<sub>''n''</sub>, such as the minimal height and the maximal covering number, and classified the [[Partially ordered set#Interval|interval]]s of small length. While ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> is not [[distributive lattice|distributive]] for ''n''&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;7, it shares some properties with distributive lattices: for example, its [[Möbius function (combinatorics)|Möbius function]] takes on only values 0, 1, &minus;1.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n<!-- These utility of these generalizations should be explained, or the section removed fro lack of notability -->\n[[File:Tableaux dominance.svg|thumb|right|200px| The dominance order on Young tableaux for the partition&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;4&nbsp;+&nbsp;2]]\nPartitions of ''n'' can be graphically represented by [[Young diagram]]s on ''n'' boxes.\nStandard [[Young tableaux]] are certain ways to fill Young diagrams with numbers, and a partial order on them (sometimes called the ''dominance order on Young tableaux'') can be defined in terms of the dominance order on the Young diagrams. For a Young tableau ''T'' to dominate another Young tableau ''S'', the shape of ''T'' must dominate that of ''S'' as a partition, and moreover the same must hold whenever ''T'' and ''S'' are first truncated to their sub-tableaux containing entries up to a given value ''k'', for each choice of ''k''.\n\nSimilarly, there is a dominance order on the set of standard Young bitableaux, which plays a role in the theory of ''standard monomials''.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Young's lattice]]\n* [[Majorization]]\n\n== References ==\n\n* [[Ian G.

      "text": "{{short description|Method of deriving an ontology}}\n{{Expand German|Formale Begriffsanalyse|date=February 2012}}\n'''Formal concept analysis''' ('''FCA''') is a [[Principle|principled way]] of deriving a ''concept hierarchy'' or formal [[Ontology (computer science)|ontology]] from a collection of [[Mathematical object|objects]] and their [[Property (philosophy)|properties]]. Each concept in the hierarchy represents the objects sharing some set of properties; and each sub-concept in the hierarchy represents a [[subset]] of the objects (as well as a superset of the properties) in the concepts above it. The term was introduced by [[Rudolf Wille]] in 1981, and builds on the mathematical theory of [[lattice theory|lattices]] and [[order theory|ordered sets]] that was developed by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and others in the 1930s.\n\nFormal concept analysis finds practical application in fields including [[data mining]], [[text mining]], [[machine learning]], [[knowledge management]], [[semantic web]], [[software development]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].\n\n== Overview and history ==\nThe original motivation of formal concept analysis was the search for real-world meaning of mathematical [[order theory]]. One such possibility of very general nature is that data tables can be transformed into algebraic structures called ''complete lattices'', and that these can be utilized for data visualization and interpretation. A data table that represents a [[heterogeneous relation]] between objects and attributes, tabulating pairs of the form \"object ''g'' has attribute ''m''\", is considered as a basic data type. It is referred to as a ''formal context''. In this theory, a ''formal concept'' is defined to be a pair (''A'', ''B''), where ''A'' is a set of objects (called the ''extent'') and ''B'' is a set of attributes (the ''intent'') such that\n\n* the extent ''A'' consists of all objects that share the attributes in ''B'', and [[dual (math)|dually]]\n* the intent ''B'' consists of all attributes shared by the objects in ''A''.\n\nIn this way, formal concept analysis formalizes the [[semantics|semantic]] notions of [[Extension (semantics)|extension]] and [[intension]].\n\nThe formal concepts of any formal context can—as explained below—be [[partially ordered set|ordered]] in a hierarchy called more formally the context's \"concept lattice.\" The concept lattice can be graphically visualized as a \"line diagram\", which then may be helpful for understanding the data. Often however these lattices get too large for visualization. Then the mathematical theory of formal concept analysis may be helpful, e.g., for decomposing the lattice into smaller pieces without information loss, or for embedding it into another structure which is easier to interpret.\n\nThe theory in its present form goes back to the early 1980s and a research group led by [[Rudolf Wille]], [[:de:Bernhard Ganter|Bernhard Ganter]] and Peter Burmeister at the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt]]. Its basic mathematical definitions, however, were already introduced in the 1930s by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] as part of general lattice theory. Other previous approaches to the same idea arose from various French research groups, but the Darmstadt group normalised the field and systematically worked out both its mathematical theory and its philosophical foundations. The latter refer in particular to [[Charles S. Peirce]], but also to the ''[[Port-Royal Logic]]''.\n\n== Motivation and philosophical background ==\nIn his article \"Restructuring Lattice Theory\" (1982),<ref name=\"restructuring\">Rudolf Wille, \"Restructuring lattice theory: An approach based on hierarchies of concepts\".

Accordingly, ''puddle'' has exactly the characteristics ''temporary, stagnant'' and ''natural''.\n\nThe original formal context can be reconstructed from the labelled diagram, as well as the formal concepts. The extent of a concept consists of those objects from which an ascending path leads to the circle representing the concept. The intent consists of those attributes to which there is an ascending path from that concept circle (in the diagram). In this diagram the concept immediately to the left of the label ''reservoir'' has the intent ''stagnant'' and ''natural'' and the extent ''puddle, maar, lake, pond, tarn, pool, lagoon,'' and ''sea''.\n\n== Formal contexts and concepts ==\nA formal context is a triple ''K'' = (''G'', ''M'', ''I''), where ''G'' is a set of ''objects'', ''M'' is a set of ''attributes'', and ''I'' &sube; ''G'' &times; ''M'' is a binary relation called ''incidence'' that expresses which objects ''have'' which attributes.<ref name=\"GW\" /> For subsets ''A'' &sube; ''G'' of objects and subsets ''B'' &sube; ''M'' of attributes, one defines two ''derivation operators'' as follows:\n\n''A''' = {''m'' &isin; ''M'' | ''(g,m)'' &isin; ''I'' for all ''g'' &isin; ''A''}, and dually\n\n''B''' = {''g'' &isin; ''G'' | ''(g,m)'' &isin; ''I'' for all ''m'' &isin; ''B''}.\n\nApplying either derivation operator and then the other constitutes two [[closure operator]]s:\n\n''A'' &nbsp; ↦ &nbsp;''A''\" = (''A''')' &nbsp; for ''A'' &sube; G &nbsp; (extent closure), and\n\n''B'' &nbsp; ↦ &nbsp;''B''\" = (''B''')' &nbsp; for ''B'' &sube; M &nbsp; (intent closure).\n\nThe derivation operators define a [[Galois connection]] between sets of objects and of attributes. This is why in French a concept lattice is sometimes called a ''treillis de Galois'' (Galois lattice).\n\nWith these derivation operators, Wille gave an elegant definition of a formal concept:\n<!--With these derivation operators, it is possible to restate the definition of the term \"formal concept\" more rigorously:-->\na pair (''A'',''B'') is a ''formal concept'' of a context (''G'', ''M'', ''I'') provided that:\n\n''A'' &sube; ''G'', &nbsp; ''B'' &sube; ''M'', &nbsp; ''A''&prime; = ''B'', &nbsp; and &nbsp;''B''&prime; = ''A''.\n\nEquivalently and more intuitively, (''A'',''B'') is a formal concept precisely when:\n* every object in ''A'' has every attribute in ''B'',\n* for every object in ''G'' that is not in ''A'', there is some attribute in ''B'' that the object does not have,\n* for every attribute in ''M'' that is not in ''B'', there is some object in ''A'' that does not have that attribute.\n\nFor computing purposes, a formal context may be naturally represented as a [[(0,1)-matrix]] ''K'' in which the rows correspond to the objects, the columns correspond to the attributes, and each entry ''k''<sub>''i'',''j''</sub> equals to 1 if \"object ''i'' has attribute ''j''.\" In this matrix representation, each formal concept corresponds to a [[maximal element|maximal]] submatrix (not necessarily contiguous) all of whose elements equal 1. It is however misleading to consider a formal context as ''boolean'', because the negated incidence (\"object ''g'' does '''not''' have attribute ''m''\") is not concept forming in the same way as defined above. For this reason, the values 1 and 0 or TRUE and FALSE are usually avoided when representing formal contexts, and a symbol like <math>\\times</math> is used to express incidence.\n\n== Concept lattice of a formal context ==\nThe concepts (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''i''</sub>) of a context ''K'' can be [[Partial order|(partially) ordered]] by the inclusion of extents, or, equivalently, by the dual inclusion of intents. An order ≤ on the concepts is defined as follows: for any two concepts (''A''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''1''</sub>) and (''A''<sub>''2''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''2''</sub>) of ''K'', we say that (''A''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''1''</sub>) ≤ (''A''<sub>''2''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''2''</sub>) precisely when ''A''<sub>''1''</sub> ⊆ ''A''<sub>''2''</sub>. Equivalently, (''A''<sub>''1''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''1''</sub>) ≤ (''A''<sub>''2''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''2''</sub>) whenever ''B''<sub>''1''</sub> ⊇ ''B''<sub>''2''</sub>.\n\nIn this order, every set of formal concepts has a [[join and meet|greatest common subconcept]], or meet. Its extent consists of those objects that are common to all extents of the set. [[dual (math)|Dually]], every set of formal concepts has a ''least common superconcept'', the intent of which comprises all attributes which all objects of that set of concepts have.\n\nThese meet and join operations satisfy the axioms defining a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]], in fact a [[complete lattice]]. Conversely, it can be shown that every complete lattice is the concept lattice of some formal context (up to isomorphism).\n\n== Attribute values and negation ==\nReal-world data is often given in the form of an object-attribute table, where the attributes have \"values\". Formal concept analysis handles such data by transforming them into the basic type of a (\"one-valued\") formal context. The method is called ''conceptual scaling''.\n\nThe negation of an attribute ''m'' is an attribute &not;''m'', the extent of which is just the complement of the extent of ''m'', i.e., with (&not;''m'')' = G&nbsp;\\&nbsp;m'. It is in general ''not'' assumed that negated attributes are available for concept formation. But pairs of attributes which are negations of each other often naturally occur, for example in contexts derived from conceptual scaling.\n\nFor possible negations of formal concepts see the section [[#concept algebra|concept algebras]] below.\n\n== Implications ==\nAn ''[[Implication (information science)|implication]]'' ''A &rarr; B'' relates two sets ''A'' and ''B'' of attributes and expresses that every object possessing each attribute from ''A'' also has each attribute from ''B''. When (''G'',''M'',''I'') is a formal context and ''A'', ''B'' are subsets of the set ''M'' of attributes (i.e., ''A,B &sube; M''), then the implication ''A &rarr; B'' ''is valid'' if ''A&prime; &sube; B&prime;''. For each finite formal context, the set of all valid implications has a ''canonical basis'',<ref>Guigues, J.L. and Duquenne, V. ''Familles minimales d'implications informatives résultant d'un tableau de données binaires.'' Mathématiques et Sciences Humaines 95 (1986): 5–18.</ref> an irredundant set of implications from which all valid implications can be derived by the natural inference ([[Armstrong axioms|Armstrong rules]]). This is used in ''attribute exploration'', a knowledge acquisition method based on implications.<ref name=\"GanterObiedkov\"> Ganter, Bernhard and Obiedkov, Sergei (2016) ''Conceptual Exploration''. Springer, {{ISBN|978-3-662-49290-1}}</ref>\n\n== Arrow relations ==\nFormal concept analysis has elaborate mathematical foundations,<ref name=\"GW\" /> making the field versatile. As a basic example we mention the ''arrow relations'', which are simple and easy to compute, but very useful. They are defined as follows: For ''g'' &isin; ''G'' and ''m'' &isin; ''M'' let\n\n''g'' ↗ ''m'' &nbsp;⇔&nbsp; ''(g, m)'' &notin; ''I'' and if ''m'&sube;n' '' and ''m' ≠ n' '', then ''(g, n)'' &isin; ''I'',\n\nand dually\n\n''g'' ↙ ''m'' &nbsp;⇔&nbsp; ''(g, m)'' &notin; ''I'' and if ''g'&sube;h' '' and ''g' ≠ h' '', then ''(h, m)'' &isin; ''I''.\n\nSince only non-incident object-attribute pairs can be related, these relations can conveniently be recorded in the table representing a formal context. Many lattice properties can be read off from the arrow relations, including distributivity and several of its generalizations. They also reveal structural information and can be used for determining, e.g., the congruence relations of the lattice.\n\n== Extensions of the theory ==\n* '''Triadic concept analysis''' replaces the binary incidence relation between objects and attributes by a ternary relation between objects, attributes, and conditions. An incidence ''(g,m,c)'' then expresses that ''the object g has the attribute m under the condition c''. Although ''triadic concepts'' can be defined in analogy to the formal concepts above, the theory of the ''trilattices'' formed by them is much less developed than that of concept lattices, and seems to be difficult.<ref>Wille R. \"The basic theorem of triadic concept analysis\".

However, since the concept lattice is complete one can consider the join (''A'', ''B'')<sup>Δ</sup> of all concepts (''C'', ''D'') that satisfy ''C''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''G''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A''; or dually the meet (''A'', ''B'')<sup>𝛁</sup> of all concepts satisfying ''D''&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B''. These two operations are known as ''weak negation'' and ''weak opposition'', respectively. This can be expressed in terms of the ''derivation operators''. Weak negation can be written as (''A'', ''B'')<sup>Δ</sup> = ((''G''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A'')<nowiki>''</nowiki>, (''G''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''A'')'), and weak opposition can be written as (''A'', ''B'')<sup>𝛁</sup> = ((''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B'')', (''M''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;''B'')<nowiki>''</nowiki>). The concept lattice equipped with the two additional operations Δ and 𝛁 is known as the ''concept algebra'' of a context. Concept algebras generalize [[power set]]s. Weak negation on a concept lattice ''L'' is a ''weak complementation'', i.e. an [[order-reversing]] map Δ:&nbsp;''L''&nbsp;→&nbsp;''L'' which satisfies the axioms ''x''<sup>ΔΔ</sup>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''x'' and (''x''⋀''y'')&nbsp;⋁&nbsp;(''x''⋀''y''<sup>Δ</sup>)&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''. Weak composition is a dual weak complementation. A (bounded) lattice such as a concept algebra, which is equipped with a weak complementation and a dual weak complementation, is called a ''weakly dicomplemented lattice''. Weakly dicomplemented lattices generalize distributive [[orthocomplemented lattice]]s, i.e. [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Wille |first=Rudolf |year=2000 |contribution=Boolean Concept Logic |editor1-last=Ganter |editor1-first=B. |editor2-last=Mineau |editor2-first=G.

The formal concepts then correspond to the maximal [[biclique]]s in that graph. The mathematical and algorithmic results of formal concept analysis may thus be used for the theory of maximal bicliques. The notion of [[bipartite dimension]] (of the complemented bipartite graph) translates<ref name=\"GW\" /> to that of ''Ferrers dimension'' (of the formal context) and of [[order dimension]] (of the concept lattice) and has applications e.g. for Boolean matrix factorization.<ref>Belohlavek, Radim, and Vychodil, Vilem.

For example, in gene expression data, it is known that genes (objects) may share a common behavior for a subset of biological situations (attributes) only: one should accordingly produce local patterns to characterize biological processes, the latter should possibly overlap, since a gene may be involved in several processes. The same remark applies for recommender systems where one is interested in local patterns characterizing groups of users that strongly share almost the same tastes for a subset of items.<ref name=\"AdomTuzh\">Adomavicius C., Tuzhilin A.

Such a pair can be represented as an inclusion-maximal rectangle in the numerical table, modulo rows and columns permutations. In<ref name=\"KayMinBicl\" /> it was shown that biclusters of similar values correspond to triconcepts of a triadic context where the third dimension is given by a scale that represents numerical attribute values by binary attributes.\n\nThis fact can be generalized to ''n''-dimensional case, where ''n''-dimensional clusters of similar values in ''n''-dimensional data are represented by ''n+1''-dimensional concepts.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], in the area of [[order theory]], a '''free lattice''' is the [[free object]] corresponding to a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]. As free objects, they have the [[universal property]].\n\n==Formal definition==\nAny set ''X'' may be used to generate the '''free [[semilattice]]''' ''FX''. The free semilattice is defined to consist of all of the finite subsets of ''X'', with the semilattice operation given by ordinary [[set union]].  The free semilattice has the [[universal property]]. The [[universal morphism]] is (''FX'',η), where η is the unit map η:''X''→''FX'' which takes ''x''∈''X'' to the [[singleton set]] {''x''}. The universal property is then as follows: given any map ''f'':''X''→''L'' from ''X'' to some arbitrary semilattice ''L'', there exists a unique semilattice homomorphism <math>\\tilde{f}:FX\\to L</math> such that <math>f=\\tilde{f}\\circ\\eta</math>. The map <math>\\tilde{f}</math> may be explicitly written down; it is given by\n:<math>S\\in FX \\mapsto\\bigvee\\left\\{f(s)\\vert s\\in S\\right\\}</math>\nHere, <math>\\bigvee</math> denotes the semilattice operation in ''L''. This construction may be promoted from semilattices to '''lattices'''{{clarify|reason=Give the construction of a free lattice explicitly. If it consists in using finite subsets of X with union and intersection, it will produce a distributive lattice. In that case, no homomorphism into a non-distributive lattice can exist.|date=September 2013}}; by construction the map <math>\\tilde{f}</math> will have the same properties as the lattice.\n\nThe symbol ''F'' is then a [[functor]] from the [[category of sets]] to the category of lattices and lattice homomorphisms. The functor ''F'' is [[adjoint functors|left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]] from lattices to their underlying sets. The free lattice is a [[free object]].\n\n==Word problem==\n\n{| style=\"float:right; border: 1px solid #808080\"\n|+ Example computation of ''x''∧''z'' ~ ''x''∧''z''∧(''x''∨''y'')\n|-\n|\n{| style=\" border: 1px solid #808080\"\n|-\n|\n| \n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z''∧(''x''∨''y'') || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''∧''z''\n|-\n| by 5.\n| since\n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''∧''z''\n|-\n| by 1.\n| since\n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || = || ''x''∧''z''\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| &nbsp;\n|}\n| \n{| style=\" border: 1px solid #808080\"\n|-\n|\n|\n| align=\"right\"| ''x''∧''z'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''∧''z''∧(''x''∨''y'')\n|-\n| by 7.\n| since \n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''∧''z''\n| and \n|\n|\n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''∨''y''\n|-\n| by 1.\n| since\n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || = || ''x''∧''z''\n|\n| by 6.\n| since \n| align=\"right\"|''x''∧''z'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''\n|-\n|\n|\n|  ||   ||\n|\n| by 5.\n| since \n| align=\"right\"|''x'' || ≤<sub>~</sub> || ''x''\n|-\n|\n|\n|  ||   ||\n|\n| by 1.\n| since \n| align=\"right\"|''x'' || = || ''x''\n|}\n|}\n\nThe [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] for free lattices has some interesting aspects. Consider the case of bounded lattices, i.e. algebraic structures with the two binary operations ∨ and ∧ and the two constants ([[nullary operation]]s) 0 and 1. The set of all well-formed [[term (logic)|expressions]] that can be formulated using these operations on elements from a given set of generators ''X'' will be called '''W'''(''X''). This set of words contains many expressions that turn out to denote equal values in every lattice. For example, if ''a'' is some element of ''X'', then ''a''∨1 = 1 and ''a''∧1 =''a''. The '''word problem''' for free bounded lattices is the problem of determining which of these elements of '''W'''(''X'') denote the same element in the free bounded lattice ''FX'', and hence in every bounded lattice.\n\nThe word problem may be resolved as follows. A relation ≤<sub>~</sub> on '''W'''(''X'') may be defined [[mathematical induction|inductively]] by setting ''w'' ≤<sub>~</sub> ''v'' [[if and only if]] one of the following holds:\n# &nbsp; ''w'' = ''v'' (this can be restricted to the case where ''w'' and ''v'' are elements of ''X''),\n# &nbsp; ''w'' = 0,\n# &nbsp; ''v'' = 1,\n# &nbsp; ''w'' = ''w''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''w''<sub>2</sub> and both ''w''<sub>1</sub>≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' and ''w''<sub>2</sub>≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' hold,\n# &nbsp; ''w'' = ''w''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''w''<sub>2</sub> and either ''w''<sub>1</sub>≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' or ''w''<sub>2</sub>≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' holds,\n# &nbsp; ''v'' = ''v''<sub>1</sub> ∨ ''v''<sub>2</sub> and either ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v''<sub>1</sub> or ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v''<sub>2</sub> holds,\n# &nbsp; ''v'' = ''v''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''v''<sub>2</sub> and both ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v''<sub>1</sub> and ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v''<sub>2</sub> hold.\n\nThis defines a [[preorder]] ≤<sub>~</sub> on '''W'''(''X''), so an [[equivalence relation]] can be defined by ''w''~''v'' when ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' and ''v''≤<sub>~</sub>''w''. One may then show that the [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]] [[Quotient set|quotient space]] '''W'''(''X'')/~ is the free bounded lattice ''FX''.<ref>[[Philip M. Whitman]], [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1969001 \"Free Lattices\"], ''[[Ann.  Math.]]'' '''42''' (1941) pp. 325–329</ref><ref>Philip M. Whitman, [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1968883 \"Free Lattices II\"], ''Ann.  Math.'' '''43''' (1941) pp. 104–115</ref> The [[equivalence class]]es of '''W'''(''X'')/~ are the sets of all words ''w'' and ''v'' with ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' and ''v''≤<sub>~</sub>''w''. Two well-formed words ''v'' and ''w'' in '''W'''(''X'') denote the same value in every bounded lattice if and only if ''w''≤<sub>~</sub>''v'' and ''v''≤<sub>~</sub>''w''; the latter conditions can be effectively decided using the above inductive definition. The table shows an example computation to show that the words ''x''∧''z'' and ''x''∧''z''∧(''x''∨''y'') denote the same value in every bounded lattice. The case of lattices that are not bounded is treated similarly, omitting rules 2. and 3. in the above construction.\n\nThe solution of the word problem on free lattices has several interesting corollaries. One is that the free lattice of a three-element set of generators is infinite. In fact, one can even show that every free lattice on three generators contains a sublattice which is free for a set of four generators. By [[mathematical induction|induction]], this eventually yields a sublattice free on [[countable|countably]] many generators.<ref>L.A. Skornjakov, ''Elements of Lattice Theory'' (1977) Adam Hilger Ltd. ''(see pp.77-78)''</ref> This property is reminiscent of [[SQ-universality]] in [[group (mathematics)|groups]].\n\nThe proof that the free lattice in three generators is infinite proceeds by inductively defining \n\n:''p''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''x'' ∨ (''y'' ∧ (''z'' ∨ (''x'' ∧ (''y'' ∨ (''z'' ∧ ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>)))))\n\nwhere ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are the three generators, and ''p''<sub>0</sub>=''x''. One then shows, using the inductive relations of the word problem, that ''p''<sub>''n''+1</sub> is strictly greater<ref>that is, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> ≤<sub>~</sub> ''p''<sub>''n''+1</sub>, but not ''p''<sub>''n''+1</sub> ≤<sub>~</sub> ''p''<sub>''n''</sub></ref>\nthan ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>, and therefore all infinitely many words ''p''<sub>''n''</sub> evaluate to different values in the free lattice ''FX''.\n\n==The complete free lattice==\nAnother corollary is that the [[complete free lattice]] (on three or more generators) \"does not exist\", in the sense that it is instead a [[proper class]]. The proof of this follows from the word problem as well. To define a [[complete lattice]] in terms of relations, it does not suffice to use the [[finitary relation]]s of [[meet and join]]; one must also have [[infinitary relation]]s defining the meet and join of infinite subsets. For example, the infinitary relation corresponding to \"join\" may be defined as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{sup}_N:(f:N\\to FX)</math>\n\nHere, ''f'' is a map from the elements of a [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] ''N'' to ''FX''; the operator <math>\\operatorname{sup}_N</math> denotes the supremum, in that it takes the image of ''f'' to its join. This is, of course, identical to \"join\" when ''N'' is a finite number; the point of this definition is to define join as a relation, even when ''N'' is an infinite cardinal.\n\nThe axioms of the pre-ordering of the word problem may be adjoined by the two infinitary operators corresponding to meet and join. After doing so, one then extends the definition of <math>p_n</math> to an [[ordinal number|ordinally]] indexed <math>p_\\alpha</math> given by\n\n:<math>p_\\alpha = \\operatorname{sup}\\{p_\\beta \\vert \\beta<\\alpha \\}</math>\n\nwhen <math>\\alpha</math> is a [[limit ordinal]]. Then, as before, one may show that <math>p_{\\alpha+1}</math> is strictly greater than <math>p_\\alpha</math>. Thus, there are at least as many elements in the complete free lattice as there are ordinals, and thus, the complete free lattice cannot exist as a set, and must therefore be a proper class.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n* Peter T.

      "title": "Heyting algebra",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Heyting algebra''' is a [[Lattice (order)#Bounded lattice|bounded lattice]] (with join and meet operations written ∨ and ∧ and with least element 0 and greatest element 1) equipped with a binary operation ''a'' → ''b'' of ''implication'' such that ''c'' ∧ ''a'' ≤ ''b'' is equivalent to ''c'' ≤ ''a'' → ''b''. From a logical standpoint, ''A'' → ''B'' is by this definition the weakest proposition for which [[modus ponens]], the inference rule ''A'' → ''B'', ''A'' ⊢ ''B'', is sound.  Equivalently a Heyting algebra is a [[residuated lattice]] whose monoid operation is ∧; yet another definition is as a [[posetal category|posetal]] [[cartesian closed category]] with all finite sums.  Like [[Boolean algebra]]s, Heyting algebras form a [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]] axiomatizable with finitely many equations. Heyting algebras were introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Arend Heyting|first=Arend|last= Heyting|year=1930}} to formalize [[intuitionistic logic]].\n\nAs lattices, Heyting algebras are [[distributive lattice|distributive]].  Every [[Boolean algebra]] is a Heyting algebra when ''a'' → ''b'' is defined as usual as ¬''a'' ∨ ''b'', as is every [[Completeness (order theory)|complete]] [[distributive lattice]] satisfying a one-sided [[Distributivity (order theory)#Distributivity laws for complete lattices|infinite distributive law]] when ''a'' → ''b'' is taken to be the [[supremum]] of the set of all ''c'' for which ''a'' ∧ ''c'' ≤ ''b''.  The [[open set]]s of a [[topological space]] form such a lattice, and therefore a (complete) Heyting algebra.  In the finite case every nonempty distributive lattice, in particular every nonempty finite [[Total order#Chains|chain]], is automatically complete and completely distributive, and hence a Heyting algebra.\n\nIt follows from the definition that 1 ≤ 0 → ''a'', corresponding to the intuition that any proposition ''a'' is implied by a contradiction 0.  Although the negation operation ¬''a'' is not part of the definition, it is definable as ''a'' → 0.  The definition implies that ''a'' ∧ ¬''a'' = 0, making the intuitive content of ¬''a'' the proposition that to assume ''a'' would lead to a contradiction, from which any other proposition would then follow.  It can further be shown that ''a'' ≤ ¬¬''a'', although the converse, ¬¬''a'' ≤ ''a'', is not true in general, that is, [[double negation elimination]] does not hold in general in a Heyting algebra.\n\nHeyting algebras generalize Boolean algebras in the sense that a Heyting algebra satisfying ''a'' ∨ ¬''a'' = 1 ([[excluded middle]]), equivalently ¬¬''a'' = ''a'' ([[double negation elimination]]), is a Boolean algebra. Those elements of a Heyting algebra H of the form ¬''a'' comprise a Boolean lattice, but in general this is not a [[subalgebra]] of H (see [[Heyting algebra#Regular and complemented elements|below]]).\n\nHeyting algebras serve as the algebraic models of propositional [[intuitionistic logic]] in the same way [[Boolean algebra]]s model propositional [[classical logic]].  [[Complete Heyting algebra]]s are a central object of study in [[pointless topology]].  The internal logic of an [[elementary topos]] is based on the Heyting algebra of [[subobject]]s of the [[terminal object]] 1 ordered by inclusion, equivalently the morphisms from 1 to the [[subobject classifier]] Ω.\n\nEvery Heyting algebra whose set of non-greatest elements has a greatest element (and forms another Heyting algebra) is [[Subdirectly irreducible algebra|subdirectly irreducible]], whence every Heyting algebra can be made an [[Subdirectly irreducible algebra|SI]] by adjoining a new greatest element.  It follows that even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory.  Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra.  This is in sharp contrast to Boolean algebras, whose only SI is the two-element one, which on its own therefore suffices for all counterexamples to non-laws of Boolean algebra, the basis for the simple [[truth table]] decision method.  Nevertheless, it is decidable whether an equation holds of all Heyting algebras.<ref name=\"Kripke63\">Kripke, S. A.: 1965, ‘Semantical analysis of intuitionistic logic I’. In: J. N. Crossley and M.

We write 1 and 0 for the largest and the smallest element of ''H'', respectively.\n\nIn any Heyting algebra, one defines the '''[[pseudo-complement]]''' ¬''a'' of any element ''a'' by setting  ¬''a'' = (''a''→0). By definition, <math>a\\wedge \\lnot a = 0</math>, and ¬''a'' is the largest element having this property. However, it is not in general true that <math>a\\vee\\lnot a=1</math>, thus ¬ is only a pseudo-complement, not a true [[complement (set theory)|complement]], as would be the case in a Boolean algebra.\n\nA '''[[complete Heyting algebra]]''' is a Heyting algebra that is a [[complete lattice]].\n\nA '''subalgebra''' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' is a subset ''H''<sub>1</sub> of ''H'' containing 0 and 1 and closed under the operations ∧, ∨ and →. It follows that it is also closed under ¬. A subalgebra is made into a Heyting algebra by the induced operations.\n\n==Alternative definitions==\n===Category-theoretic definition===\nA Heyting algebra <math>H</math> is a bounded lattice that has all [[exponential object]]s.\n\nThe lattice <math>H</math> is regarded as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] where \nmeet, <math>\\wedge</math>, is the [[product (category theory)|product]]. The exponential condition means that for any objects <math>Y</math> and <math>Z</math> in <math>H</math> an exponential <math>Z^Y</math> uniquely exists as an object in <math>H</math>.\n\nA Heyting implication (often written using <math>\\Rightarrow</math> or <math>\\multimap</math> to avoid confusions such as the use of <math>\\to</math> to indicate a [[functor]]) is just an exponential: <math>Y \\Rightarrow Z</math> is an alternative notation for <math>Z^Y</math>. From the definition of exponentials we have that implication (<math>\\Rightarrow : H \\times H \\to H</math>) is [[right adjoint]] to meet (<math>\\wedge : H \\times H \\to H</math>). This adjunction can be written as <math>(- \\wedge Y) \\dashv (Y \\Rightarrow -)</math> or more fully as:\n<math display=\"block\">(- \\wedge Y): H \\stackrel {\\longrightarrow} {\\underset {\\longleftarrow}{\\top}} H: (Y \\Rightarrow -)</math>\n\n===Lattice-theoretic definitions===\nAn equivalent definition of Heyting algebras can be given by considering the mappings:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f_a \\colon H \\to H \\\\ f_a(x)=a\\wedge x \\end{cases}</math>\n\nfor some fixed ''a'' in ''H''. A bounded lattice ''H'' is a Heyting algebra [[if and only if]] every mapping ''f<sub>a</sub>'' is the lower adjoint of a monotone [[Galois connection]]. In this case the respective upper adjoint ''g<sub>a</sub>'' is given by ''g<sub>a</sub>''(''x'') = ''a''→''x'', where → is defined as above.\n\nYet another definition is as a [[residuated lattice]] whose monoid operation is ∧. The monoid unit must then be the top element 1. Commutativity of this monoid implies that the two residuals coincide as ''a''→''b''.\n\n===Bounded lattice with an implication operation===\nGiven a bounded lattice ''A'' with largest and smallest elements 1 and 0, and a binary operation →, these together form a Heyting algebra if and only if the following hold:\n#<math>a\\to a = 1</math>\n#<math>a\\wedge(a\\to b)=a\\wedge b</math>\n#<math>b\\wedge(a\\to b)= b</math>\n#<math>a\\to (b\\wedge c)= (a\\to b)\\wedge (a\\to c)</math>\nwhere 4 is the distributive law for →.\n\n===Characterization using the axioms of intuitionistic logic===\nThis characterization of Heyting algebras makes the proof of the basic facts concerning the relationship between intuitionist propositional calculus and Heyting algebras immediate. (For these facts, see the sections \"[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]\" and \"[[#Universal constructions|Universal constructions]]\".) One should think of the element <math>\\top</math> as meaning, intuitively, \"provably true.\" Compare with the axioms at [[Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization]] ).\n\nGiven a set ''A'' with three binary operations →, ∧ and ∨, and two distinguished elements <math>\\bot</math> and <math>\\top</math>, then ''A'' is a Heyting algebra for these operations (and the relation ≤ defined by the condition that <math>a \\le b</math> when ''a''→''b'' = <math>\\top</math>) if and only if the following conditions hold for any elements ''x'', ''y'' and ''z'' of ''A'':\n\n#<math>\\mbox{If } x \\le y  \\mbox{ and } y \\le x  \\mbox{ then } x = y ,</math>\n#<math>\\mbox{If } \\top \\le y , \\mbox{ then } y = \\top ,</math>\n#<math>x \\le y \\to x  ,</math>\n#<math> x \\to (y \\to z) \\le (x \\to y) \\to (x \\to z)  ,</math>\n#<math> x \\land y \\le x  ,</math>\n#<math> x \\land y \\le y ,</math>\n#<math> x \\le y \\to (x \\land y)  ,</math>\n#<math> x \\le x \\lor y ,</math>\n#<math> y \\le x \\lor y  ,</math>\n#<math> x \\to z \\le (y \\to z) \\to (x \\lor y \\to z)  ,</math>\n#<math> \\bot \\le x  .</math>\nFinally, we define ¬''x'' to be ''x''→ <math>\\bot</math>.\n\nCondition 1 says that equivalent formulas should be identified. Condition&nbsp;2 says that provably true formulas are closed under [[modus ponens]]. Conditions&nbsp;3 and 4 are ''then'' conditions. Conditions&nbsp;5, 6 and 7 are ''and'' conditions. Conditions&nbsp;8, 9 and 10 are ''or'' conditions. Condition&nbsp;11 is a ''false'' condition.\n\nOf course, if a different set of axioms were chosen for logic, we could modify ours accordingly.\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Rieger-Nishimura.svg|thumb|right|280px|The [[free object|free]] Heyting algebra over one generator (aka Rieger–Nishimura lattice)]]\n\n<ul>\n<li> Every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] is a Heyting algebra, with ''p''→''q'' given by ¬''p''∨''q''.\n<li> Every [[total order|totally ordered set]] that is a bounded lattice is also a Heyting algebra, where ''p''→''q'' is equal to ''q'' when ''p''>''q'', and 1 otherwise.\n<li> The simplest Heyting algebra that is not already a Boolean algebra is the totally ordered set {0, ½, 1} with → defined as above, yielding the operations:\n{|\n|-style=\"vertical-align:bottom\"\n|\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <math>a \\land b</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''a''|''b''}}\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|}\n</div>\n| width=\"30\" | &nbsp;\n|\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ <math>a \\lor b</math>\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''a''|''b''}}\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|}\n</div>\n| width=\"30\" | &nbsp;\n|\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ {{nobold|{{math|''a''→''b''}}}}\n|-\n! {{diagonal split header|''a''|''b''}}\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| bgcolor=\"white\" width=\"30\" align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|}\n</div>\n| width=\"30\" | &nbsp;\n|\n<div>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| width=\"50\" align=\"center\" | ''a''\n| width=\"50\" align=\"center\" | ¬''a''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 0\n| align=\"center\" | 1\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | ½\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" | 1\n| align=\"center\" | 0\n|}\n</div>\n|}\nIn this example, that {{math|size=100%|1= ½&or;¬½ = ½&or;(½ &rarr; 0) = ½&or;0 = ½}} falsifies the law of excluded middle.\n\n<li> Every [[topology]] provides a complete Heyting algebra in the form of its [[open set]] lattice.

In practice, one frequently uses the [[deduction theorem]] in such proofs.\n\nSince for any ''a'' and ''b'' in a Heyting algebra ''H'' we have <math>a \\le b</math> if and only if ''a''→''b'' = 1, it follows from {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} that whenever a formula ''F''→''G'' is provably true, we have <math>F(a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n) \\le G(a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n)</math> for any Heyting algebra ''H'', and any elements <math>a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n \\in H</math>. (It follows from the deduction theorem that ''F''→''G'' is provable [from nothing] if and only if ''G'' is provable from ''F'', that is, if ''G'' is a provable consequence of ''F''.) In particular, if ''F'' and ''G'' are provably equivalent, then <math>F(a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n) = G(a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n)</math>, since ≤ is an order relation.\n\n1 ⇒ 2 can be proved by examining the logical axioms of the system of proof and verifying that their value is 1 in any Heyting algebra, and then verifying that the application of the rules of inference to expressions with value 1 in a Heyting algebra results in expressions with value 1. For example, let us choose the system of proof having [[modus ponens]] as its sole rule of inference, and whose axioms are the Hilbert-style ones given at [[Intuitionistic logic#Axiomatization]]. Then the facts to be verified follow immediately from the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras given above.\n\n1 ⇒ 2 also provides a method for proving that certain propositional formulas, though [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]] in classical logic, ''cannot'' be proved in intuitionist propositional logic. In order to prove that some formula <math>F(A_1, A_2,\\ldots, A_n)</math> is not provable, it is enough to exhibit a Heyting algebra ''H'' and elements <math>a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n \\in H</math> such that <math>F(a_1, a_2,\\ldots, a_n) \\ne 1</math>.\n\nIf one wishes to avoid mention of logic, then in practice it becomes necessary to prove as a lemma a version of the deduction theorem valid for Heyting algebras: for any elements ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'', we have <math>(a \\land b) \\to c = a \\to (b \\to c)</math>.\n\nFor more on the metaimplication 2 ⇒ 1, see the section \"[[#Universal constructions|Universal constructions]]\" below.\n\n===Distributivity===\nHeyting algebras are always [[distributivity (order theory)|distributive]]. Specifically, we always have the identities\n#<math>a \\wedge (b \\vee c) = (a \\wedge b) \\vee (a \\wedge c)</math>\n#<math>a \\vee (b \\wedge c) = (a \\vee b) \\wedge (a \\vee c)</math>\n\nThe distributive law is sometimes stated as an axiom, but in fact it follows from the existence of relative pseudo-complements. The reason is that, being the lower adjoint of a [[Galois connection]], <math>\\wedge</math> [[limit-preserving function (order theory)|preserves]] all existing [[suprema]]. Distributivity in turn is just the preservation of binary suprema by <math>\\wedge</math>.\n\nBy a similar argument, the following [[infinite distributive law]] holds in any complete Heyting algebra:\n\n:<math>x\\wedge\\bigvee Y = \\bigvee \\{x\\wedge y \\mid y \\in Y\\}</math>\n\nfor any element ''x'' in ''H'' and any subset ''Y'' of ''H''. Conversely, any complete lattice satisfying the above infinite distributive law is a complete Heyting algebra, with\n:<math>a\\to b=\\bigvee\\{c\\mid a\\land c\\le b\\}</math>\nbeing its relative pseudo-complement operation.\n\n===Regular and complemented elements===\nAn element ''x'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' is called '''regular''' if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:\n#''x'' =  ¬¬''x''.\n#''x'' =  ¬''y'' for some ''y'' in ''H''.\nThe equivalence of these conditions can be restated simply as the identity ¬¬¬''x'' = ¬''x'', valid for all ''x'' in ''H''.\n\nElements ''x'' and ''y'' of a Heyting algebra ''H'' are called '''complements''' to each other if ''x''∧''y'' = 0 and ''x''∨''y'' = 1. If it exists, any such ''y'' is unique and must in fact be equal to ¬''x''. We call an element ''x'' '''complemented''' if it admits a complement. It is true that ''if'' ''x'' is complemented, then so is ¬''x'', and then ''x'' and ¬''x'' are complements to each other. However, confusingly, even if ''x'' is not complemented, ¬''x'' may nonetheless have a complement (not equal to ''x''). In any Heyting algebra, the elements 0 and 1 are complements to each other. For instance, it is possible that ¬''x'' is 0 for every ''x'' different from 0, and 1 if ''x'' = 0, in which case 0 and 1 are the only regular elements.\n\nAny complemented element of a Heyting algebra is regular, though the converse is not true in general. In particular, 0 and 1 are always regular.\n\nFor any Heyting algebra ''H'', the following conditions are equivalent:\n# ''H'' is a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]];\n# every ''x'' in ''H'' is regular;<ref>Rutherford (1965), Th.26.2 p.78.</ref>\n# every ''x'' in ''H'' is complemented.<ref>Rutherford (1965), Th.26.1 p.78.</ref>\nIn this case, the element {{nowrap|1=''a''→''b''}} is equal to {{nowrap|1=¬''a'' ∨ ''b''.}}\n\nThe regular (resp. complemented) elements of any Heyting algebra ''H'' constitute a Boolean algebra ''H''<sub>reg</sub> (resp. ''H''<sub>comp</sub>), in which the operations ∧, ¬ and →, as well as the constants 0 and 1, coincide with those of ''H''. In the case of ''H''<sub>comp</sub>, the operation ∨ is also the same, hence ''H''<sub>comp</sub> is a subalgebra of ''H''. In general however, ''H''<sub>reg</sub> will not be a subalgebra of ''H'', because its join operation ∨<sub>reg</sub> may be differ from ∨. For {{nowrap|1=''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''H''<sub>reg</sub>,}} we have {{nowrap|1=''x'' ∨<sub>reg</sub> ''y'' = ¬(¬''x'' ∧ ¬''y'').}} See below for necessary and sufficient conditions in order for ∨<sub>reg</sub> to coincide with ∨.\n\n===The De Morgan laws in a Heyting algebra===\nOne of the two [[De Morgan laws]] is satisfied in every Heyting algebra, namely\n\n:<math>\\forall x,y \\in H: \\qquad \\lnot(x \\vee y)=\\lnot x \\wedge \\lnot y.</math>\n\nHowever, the other De Morgan law does not always hold. We have instead a weak de Morgan law:\n\n:<math>\\forall x,y \\in H: \\qquad \\lnot(x \\wedge y)= \\lnot \\lnot (\\lnot x \\vee \\lnot y).</math>\n\nThe following statements are equivalent for all Heyting algebras ''H'':\n#''H'' satisfies both De Morgan laws,\n#<math>\\lnot(x \\wedge y)=\\lnot x \\vee \\lnot y \\mbox{ for all } x, y \\in H,</math>\n#<math>\\lnot(x \\wedge y)=\\lnot x \\vee \\lnot y \\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\in H,</math>\n#<math>\\lnot\\lnot (x \\vee y) = \\lnot\\lnot x \\vee \\lnot\\lnot y \\mbox{ for all } x, y \\in H,</math>\n#<math>\\lnot\\lnot (x \\vee y) = x \\vee y \\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\in H,</math>\n#<math>\\lnot(\\lnot x \\wedge \\lnot y) = x \\vee y \\mbox{ for all regular } x, y \\in H,</math>\n#<math>\\lnot x \\vee \\lnot\\lnot x = 1 \\mbox{ for all } x \\in H.</math>\nCondition 2 is the other De Morgan law. Condition 6 says that the join operation ∨<sub>reg</sub> on the Boolean algebra ''H''<sub>reg</sub> of regular elements of ''H'' coincides with the operation ∨ of ''H''. Condition 7 states that every regular element is complemented, i.e., ''H''<sub>reg</sub> = ''H''<sub>comp</sub>.\n\nWe prove the equivalence. Clearly the metaimplications {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2,}} {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 3}} and {{nowrap|4 ⇒ 5}} are trivial. Furthermore, {{nowrap|3 ⇔ 4}} and {{nowrap|5 ⇔ 6}} result simply from the first De Morgan law and the definition of regular elements. We show that {{nowrap|6 ⇒ 7}} by taking ¬''x'' and ¬¬''x'' in place of ''x'' and ''y'' in 6 and using the identity {{nowrap|''a'' &and; ¬''a'' {{=}} 0.}} Notice that {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 1}} follows from the first De Morgan law, and {{nowrap|7 ⇒ 6}} results from the fact that the join operation  ∨ on the subalgebra ''H''<sub>comp</sub> is just the restriction of ∨ to ''H''<sub>comp</sub>, taking into account the characterizations we have given of conditions 6 and 7. The metaimplication {{nowrap|5 ⇒ 2}} is a trivial consequence of the weak De Morgan law, taking ¬''x'' and ¬''y'' in place of ''x'' and ''y'' in 5.\n\nHeyting algebras satisfying the above properties are related to [[Intermediate logic|De Morgan logic]] in the same way Heyting algebras in general are related to intuitionist logic.\n\n==Heyting algebra morphisms==\n\n===Definition===\nGiven two Heyting algebras ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> and a mapping {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub> → ''H''<sub>2</sub>,}} we say that ''ƒ'' is a '''[[morphism]]''' of Heyting algebras if, for any elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''H''<sub>1</sub>, we have:\n#<math>f(0) = 0,</math>\n#<math> f(x \\land y) = f(x) \\land f(y),</math>\n#<math> f(x \\lor y) = f(x) \\lor f(y),</math>\n#<math>f(x \\to y) = f(x) \\to f(y),</math>\n\nIt follows from condition 4 (or 2 alone, or 3 alone) that ''f'' is an increasing function, that is, that {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') &le; ''f''(''y'')}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''x'' &le; ''y''}}.\n\nAssume ''H''<sub>1</sub> and ''H''<sub>2</sub> are structures with operations →, ∧, ∨ (and possibly ¬) and constants 0 and 1, and ''f'' is a surjective mapping from ''H''<sub>1</sub> to ''H''<sub>2</sub> with properties 1 through 5 (or 1 through 6) above. Then if ''H''<sub>1</sub> is a Heyting algebra, so too is ''H''<sub>2</sub>. This follows from the characterization of Heyting algebras as bounded lattices (thought of as algebraic structures rather than partially ordered sets) with an operation → satisfying certain identities.\n\n===Properties===\nThe identity map {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''}} from any Heyting algebra to itself is a morphism, and the composite {{nowrap|1=''g'' ∘ ''f''}} of any two morphisms ''f'' and ''g'' is a morphism. Hence Heyting algebras form a [[Category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n===Examples===\nGiven a Heyting algebra ''H'' and any subalgebra ''H''<sub>1</sub>, the inclusion mapping {{nowrap|1=''i'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub> → ''H''}} is a morphism.\n\nFor any Heyting algebra ''H'', the map {{nowrap|1=''x'' ↦ ¬¬''x''}} defines a morphism from ''H'' onto the Boolean algebra of its regular elements ''H''<sub>reg</sub>. This is ''not'' in general a morphism from ''H'' to itself, since the join operation of ''H''<sub>reg</sub> may be different from that of ''H''.\n\n==Quotients==\nLet ''H'' be a Heyting algebra, and let {{nowrap|1=''F'' &sube; ''H''.}} We call ''F'' a '''filter''' on ''H'' if it satisfies the following properties:\n#<math>1 \\in F,</math>\n#<math> \\mbox{If } x,y \\in F \\mbox{ then } x \\land y \\in F,</math>\n#<math> \\mbox{If } x \\in F, \\ y \\in H, \\ \\mbox{and } x \\le y \\mbox{ then } y \\in F.</math>\n\nThe intersection of any set of filters on ''H'' is again a filter. Therefore, given any subset ''S'' of ''H'' there is a smallest filter containing ''S''. We call it the filter '''generated''' by ''S''. If ''S'' is empty, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = {1}.}} Otherwise, ''F'' is equal to the set of ''x'' in ''H'' such that there exist {{nowrap|1=''y''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>, &hellip;, ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> ∈ ''S''}} with {{nowrap|1=''y''<sub>1</sub> ∧ ''y''<sub>2</sub> ∧ &hellip; ∧ ''y''<sub>''n''</sub> &le; ''x''.}}\n\nIf ''H'' is a Heyting algebra and ''F'' is a filter on ''H'', we define a relation ∼ on ''H'' as follows: we write {{nowrap|1=''x'' &sim; ''y''}} whenever {{nowrap|1=''x'' → ''y''}} and {{nowrap|1=''y'' → ''x''}} both belong to ''F''. Then ∼ is an [[equivalence relation]]; we write {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} for the [[quotient set]]. There is a unique Heyting algebra structure on {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} such that the canonical surjection {{nowrap|1=''p''<sub>''F''</sub> : ''H'' → ''H''/''F''}} becomes a Heyting algebra morphism. We call the Heyting algebra {{nowrap|1=''H''/''F''}} the '''quotient''' of ''H'' by ''F''.\n\nLet ''S'' be a subset of a Heyting algebra ''H'' and let ''F'' be the filter generated by ''S''. Then ''H''/''F'' satisfies the following universal property:\n:Given any morphism of Heyting algebras {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H'' → ''H′''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}} for every {{nowrap|1=''y'' ∈ ''S'',}} ''f'' factors uniquely through the canonical surjection {{nowrap|1=''p''<sub>''F''</sub> : ''H'' → ''H''/''F''.}} That is, there is a unique morphism {{nowrap|1=''f′'' : ''H''/''F'' → ''H′''}} satisfying {{nowrap|1=''f′p''<sub>''F''</sub> = ''f''.}} The morphism ''f′'' is said to be ''induced'' by ''f''.\n\nLet {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub> → ''H''<sub>2</sub>}} be a morphism of Heyting algebras. The '''kernel''' of ''f'', written ker ''f'', is the set {{nowrap|1=''f''<sup>−1</sup>[{1}].}} It is a filter on ''H''<sub>1</sub>. (Care should be taken because this definition, if applied to a morphism of Boolean algebras, is dual to what would be called the kernel of the morphism viewed as a morphism of rings.) By the foregoing, ''f'' induces a morphism {{nowrap|1=''f′'' : ''H''<sub>1</sub>/(ker ''f'') → ''H''<sub>2</sub>.}} It is an isomorphism of {{nowrap|1=''H''<sub>1</sub>/(ker ''f'')}} onto the subalgebra ''f''[''H''<sub>1</sub>] of ''H''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n==Universal constructions==\n\n===Heyting algebra of propositional formulas in ''n'' variables up to intuitionist equivalence===\nThe metaimplication {{nowrap|2 ⇒ 1}} in the section \"[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]\" is proved by showing that the result of the following construction is itself a Heyting algebra:\n#Consider the set ''L'' of propositional formulas in the variables ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ''A''<sub>2</sub>,..., ''A''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n# Endow ''L'' with a preorder ≼ by defining ''F''≼''G'' if ''G'' is an (intuitionist) [[logical consequence]] of ''F'', that is, if ''G'' is provable from ''F''. It is immediate that ≼ is a preorder.\n# Consider the equivalence relation ''F''∼''G'' induced by the preorder F≼G. (It is defined by ''F''∼''G'' if and only if ''F''≼''G'' and ''G''≼''F''. In fact, ∼ is the relation of (intuitionist) logical equivalence.)\n# Let ''H''<sub>0</sub> be the quotient set ''L''/∼. This will be the desired Heyting algebra.\n# We write [''F''] for the equivalence class of a formula ''F''. Operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ are defined in an obvious way on ''L''. Verify that given formulas ''F'' and ''G'', the equivalence classes [''F''→''G''], [''F''∧''G''], [''F''∨''G''] and [¬''F''] depend only on [''F''] and [''G'']. This defines operations →, ∧, ∨ and ¬ on the quotient set ''H''<sub>0</sub>=''L''/∼. Further define 1 to be the class of provably true statements, and set 0=[⊥].\n# Verify that ''H''<sub>0</sub>, together with these operations, is a Heyting algebra. We do this using the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras. ''H''<sub>0</sub> satisfies conditions THEN-1 through FALSE because all formulas of the given forms are axioms of intuitionist logic. MODUS-PONENS follows from the fact that if a formula ⊤→''F'' is provably true, where ⊤ is provably true, then ''F'' is provably true (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens). Finally, EQUIV results from the fact that if ''F''→''G'' and ''G''→''F'' are both provably true, then ''F'' and ''G'' are provable from each other (by application of the rule of inference modus ponens), hence [''F'']=[''G''].\n\nAs always under the axiom-like definition of Heyting algebras, we define ≤ on ''H''<sub>0</sub> by the condition that ''x''≤''y'' if and only if ''x''→''y''=1. Since, by the [[deduction theorem]], a formula ''F''→''G'' is provably true if and only if ''G'' is provable from ''F'', it follows that [''F'']≤[''G''] if and only if  F≼G. In other words, ≤ is the order relation on ''L''/∼ induced by the preorder ≼ on ''L''.\n\n===Free Heyting algebra on an arbitrary set of generators===\nIn fact, the preceding construction can be carried out for any set of variables {''A''<sub>''i''</sub> : ''i''∈''I''} (possibly infinite). One obtains in this way the ''free'' Heyting algebra on the variables {''A''<sub>''i''</sub>}, which we will again denote by ''H''<sub>0</sub>. It is free in the sense that given any Heyting algebra ''H'' given together with a family of its elements 〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>: ''i''∈''I'' 〉, there is a unique morphism ''f'':''H''<sub>0</sub>→''H'' satisfying ''f''([''A''<sub>''i''</sub>])=''a''<sub>''i''</sub>. The uniqueness of ''f'' is not difficult to see, and its existence results essentially from the metaimplication {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} of the section \"[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]\" above, in the form of its corollary that whenever ''F'' and ''G'' are provably equivalent formulas, ''F''(〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉)=''G''(〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉) for any family of elements 〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉in ''H''.\n\n===Heyting algebra of formulas equivalent with respect to a theory ''T''===\nGiven a set of formulas ''T'' in the variables {''A''<sub>''i''</sub>}, viewed as axioms, the same construction could have been carried out with respect to a relation ''F''≼''G'' defined on ''L'' to mean that ''G'' is a provable consequence of ''F'' and the set of axioms ''T''. Let us denote by ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> the Heyting algebra so obtained. Then ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> satisfies the same universal property as ''H''<sub>0</sub> above, but with respect to Heyting algebras ''H'' and families of elements 〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉 satisfying the property that ''J''(〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉)=1 for any axiom ''J''(〈''A''<sub>''i''</sub>〉) in ''T''. (Let us note that ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>, taken with the family of its elements 〈[''A''<sub>''i''</sub>]〉, itself satisfies this property.) The existence and uniqueness of the morphism is proved the same way as for ''H''<sub>0</sub>, except that one must modify the metaimplication {{nowrap|1 ⇒ 2}} in \"[[#Provable identities|Provable identities]]\" so that 1 reads \"provably true ''from T'',\" and 2 reads \"any elements ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>,..., ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> in ''H'' ''satisfying the formulas of T''.\"\n\nThe Heyting algebra ''H''<sub>''T''</sub> that we have just defined can be viewed as a quotient of the free Heyting algebra ''H''<sub>0</sub> on the same set of variables, by applying the universal property of ''H''<sub>0</sub> with respect to ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>, and the family of its elements 〈[''A''<sub>''i''</sub>]〉.\n\nEvery Heyting algebra is isomorphic to one of the form ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>. To see this, let ''H'' be any Heyting algebra, and let 〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>: ''i''∈I〉 be a family of elements generating ''H'' (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set ''T'' of formulas ''J''(〈''A''<sub>''i''</sub>〉) in the variables 〈''A''<sub>''i''</sub>: ''i''∈I〉 such that ''J''(〈''a''<sub>''i''</sub>〉)=1. Then we obtain a morphism ''f'':''H''<sub>''T''</sub>→''H'' by the universal property of ''H''<sub>''T''</sub>, which is clearly surjective. It is not difficult to show that ''f'' is injective.\n\n===Comparison to Lindenbaum algebras===\nThe constructions we have just given play an entirely analogous role with respect to Heyting algebras to that of [[Lindenbaum algebra]]s with respect to [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]]. In fact, The Lindenbaum algebra ''B''<sub>''T''</sub> in the variables {''A''<sub>''i''</sub>} with respect to the axioms ''T'' is just our ''H''<sub>''T''∪''T''<sub>1</sub></sub>, where ''T''<sub>1</sub> is the set of all formulas of the form ¬¬''F''→''F'', since the additional axioms of ''T''<sub>1</sub> are the only ones that need to be added in order to make all classical tautologies provable.\n\n==Heyting algebras as applied to intuitionistic logic==\nIf one interprets the axioms of the intuitionistic propositional logic as terms of a Heyting algebra, then they will evaluate to the largest element, 1, in ''any'' Heyting algebra under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. For instance, (''P''∧''Q'')→''P'' is, by definition of the pseudo-complement, the largest element ''x'' such that <math>P \\land Q \\land x \\le P</math>. This inequation is satisfied for any ''x'', so the largest such ''x'' is 1.\n\nFurthermore, the rule of [[modus ponens]] allows us to derive the formula ''Q'' from the formulas ''P'' and ''P''→''Q''. But in any Heyting algebra, if ''P'' has the value 1, and ''P''→''Q'' has the value 1, then it means that <math>P \\land 1 \\le Q</math>, and so <math>1 \\land 1 \\le Q</math>; it can only be that ''Q'' has the value 1.\n\nThis means that if a formula is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms by way of the rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to ''P'' and 0 to ''Q'', then the value of Peirce's law ((''P''→''Q'')→''P'')→''P'' is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See [[Curry&ndash;Howard isomorphism]] for the general context of what this implies in [[type theory]].\n\nThe converse can be proven as well: if a formula always has the value 1, then it is deducible from the laws of intuitionistic logic, so the ''intuitionistically valid'' formulas are exactly those that always have a value of 1. This is similar to the notion that ''classically valid'' formulas are those formulas that have a value of 1 in the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] under any possible assignment of true and false to the formula's variables &mdash; that is, they are formulas which are tautologies in the usual truth-table sense. A Heyting algebra, from the logical standpoint, is then a generalization of the usual system of truth values, and its largest element 1 is analogous to 'true'. The usual two-valued logic system is a special case of a Heyting algebra, and the smallest non-trivial one, in which the only elements of the algebra are 1 (true) and 0 (false).\n\n==Decision problems==\nThe problem of whether a given equation holds in every Heyting algebra was shown to be decidable by S. Kripke in 1965.<ref name=\"Kripke63\" /> The precise [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]] of the problem was established by R.

In Supplementary Proceeding of International Conference on Formal concept analysis (ICFCA'10), 2010</ref> is a [[formal concept analysis]] software tool for the construction, visualization and manipulation of concept [[Lattice (order)|lattices]]. It allows the generation of formal concepts and association rules as well as the transformation of formal contexts via apposition, subposition, reduction and object/attribute generalization, and the manipulation of concept lattices via approximation, projection and selection. Lattice Miner allows also the drawing of nested line diagrams.\n\n== Introduction ==\n\n[[Formal concept analysis]] (FCA) is a branch of applied mathematics based on the formalization of concept and concept hierarchy and mainly used as a framework for conceptual clustering and rule mining.<ref>Bernhard Ganter and Rudolf Wille.

Coron: A framework for levelwise itemset mining algorithms. In Supplementary Proceedings of the Third International Conf. on Formal Concept Analysis (ICFCA’05), Lens, pages 110–113, 2005.</ref> A main issue in the development of FCA tools is to visualize large concept lattices and provide efficient mechanisms to highlight patterns (e.g., concepts, associations) that could be relevant to the user. The initial objective of the FCA tool called Lattice Miner <ref>Geneviève Roberge. Visualisation des résultats de la fouille des données dans les treillis des\nconcepts. Master’s thesis, Université du Québec en Outaouais, 2007.</ref> was to focus on visualization mechanisms for the representation of concept lattices, including nested line diagrams. Later on, many other interesting features were integrated into the tool.\n\n==Functional architecture of Lattice Miner==\n[[File:LatticeMiner Architecture.JPG|thumb|Lattice Miner Architecture]]\nLattice Miner is a Java-based platform whose functions are articulated around a core. The Lattice Miner core provides all low-level operations and structures for the representation and manipulation of contexts, lattices and association rules. Mainly, the core of Lattice Miner consists of three modules: context, concept and association rule modules. The user interface offers a context editor and concept lattice manipulator to assist the user in a set of tasks. The architecture of Lattice Miner is open and modular enough to allow the integration of new features and facilities in each one of its components.\n\n===Context module===\n[[File:LatticeMiner Figure-1.JPG|thumb|Figure 1]]\nThe context module offers all the basic operations and structures to manipulate binary and valued contexts as well as context decomposition to produce nested line diagrams. Basic context operations include apposition, subposition, generalization, clarification, reduction as well as the complementary context computation. The module provides also the arrow relations (for context reduction and decomposition) [2]. The tool has an input LMB format and recognizes the binary format SLF found in [http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~galicia/ Galicia] and the format CEX produced by [http://sourceforge.net/projects/conexp/ ConExp].\n\n===Concept module===\n[[File:LatticeMiner Figure-2.JPG|thumb|Figure 2]]\nThe main function of the concept module is to generate the concepts of the current\nbinary context and construct the corresponding lattice and nested structure (see Figures 2 and 3). It provides the user with basic operators such as projection,selection, and exact search as well as advanced features like pair approximation.Some known algorithms are included in this module such as Bordat’s procedure, Godin’s algorithm and NextClosure algorithm.<ref>Bernhard Ganter. Two basic algorithms in concept analysis. Preprint 831, Technische Hochschule Darmstadt, June 1984.</ref> The approximation feature implemented in Lattice Miner is based on the\nfollowing idea: given a pair (X,Y) where X ⊆ G, and Y ⊆ M, is there a set of\nformal concepts (Ai,Bi) which are “close to” (X,Y)? To answer this question, The tool starts to identify the type of couple that the pair (X,Y) represents.<ref>Rokia Missaoui, L´eonard Kwuida, Mohamed Quafafou, and Jean Vaillancourt. Algebraic\noperators for querying pattern bases. CoRR, abs/0902.4042, 2009. Also published in the\nSupplementary proceedings of ICFCA’2009, pp. 1&ndash;17, Darmstadt, Germany, May 2009.</ref> It can be a formal concept, a protoconcept, a semiconcept or a preconcept. In the last case, the approximation\nis given by the interval [(X\",X′),(Y′,Y\")] and highlighted in the line diagram.\n\n===Association rule module===\n\nThis module includes procedures for computing the (stem) Guigues&ndash;Duquenne base using NextClosure algorithm [3], as well as the generic and informative bases. Implications with negation can be obtained using the apposition of a context and its complementary. This module embeds also procedures for the computation of a non-redundant family C of implications and the closure of a set Y of attributes for the given implication set C.\n\n===User interface===\n\nThe initial objective of Lattice Miner was to focus on lattice drawing and visualization\neither as a flat or nested structure by taking into account the cognitive process of human beings and known principles for [[Hasse diagram|lattice drawing]] (e.g., reducing the number of edge intersections, ensuring diagram symmetry). Some well-known visualization techniques were implemented such as focus & context and fisheye view. The basic idea behind focus & context visualization paradigm is to allow a viewer to see key (important) objects in full detail in the foreground (focus) while at the same time an overview of all the surrounding information (context) remains available in the background. Lattice Miner translates the focus & context paradigm into clear and blurred elements while the size of nodes and the intensity of their color were used to indicate their importance. Various forms of highlighting, labelling and animation are also provided.\n[[File:LatticeMiner Figure-3.JPG|thumb|Figure 3]]\nIn order to better handle the display of large lattices, nested line diagrams are offered in the tool. Figure 3 shows the third level of the nested line diagram corresponding to the binary context of Figure 1 where three levels of nesting are defined. Each one of the inner nodes of this diagram represents a combination of attributes from the previous two (outer) levels. Real inner concepts (see the node on the left hand-side of the diagram) are identified by colored nodes while\nvoid elements are in grey color. Each node of levels 1 and 2 can be expanded to exhibit its internal line diagram. Both flat and nested diagrams can be saved as an image. Simple (flat) lattices can also be saved as an XML format file.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* http://www.upriss.org.uk/fca/fca.html\n* http://w3.uqo.ca/icfca10/\n* http://sourceforge.net/projects/lattice-miner/\n\n[[Category:Semantic Web]]\n[[Category:Lattice theory]]\n[[Category:Data mining and machine learning software]]"

      "text": "[[File:Dih4 subgroups (cycle graphs).svg|thumb|400px|[[Hasse diagram]] of the lattice of subgroups of the [[dihedral group]] [[Dihedral group of order 8|Dih<sub>4</sub>]], with the subgroups represented by their [[Cycle graph (algebra)|cycle graphs]]]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''lattice of subgroups''' of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] <math>G</math> is the [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] whose elements are the [[subgroup]]s of <math>G</math>, with the [[partial order]] [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] being [[set inclusion]].\nIn this lattice, the join of two subgroups is the subgroup [[generating set of a group|generated]] by their [[union (set theory)|union]], and the meet of two subgroups is their [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]].\n\n== Example ==\n\nThe [[dihedral group]] [[Dihedral group of order 8|Dih<sub>4</sub>]] has ten subgroups, counting itself and the [[Trivial group|trivial subgroup]]. Five of the eight group elements generate subgroups of order two, and the other two non-identity elements both generate the same [[cyclic group|cyclic]] subgroup of order four. In addition, there are two subgroups of the form [[Klein four-group|Z<sub>2</sub> &times; Z<sub>2</sub>]], generated by pairs of order-two elements. The lattice formed by these ten subgroups is shown in the illustration.\n\nThis example also shows that the lattice of all subgroups of a group is not a [[modular lattice]] in general. Indeed, this particular lattice contains the forbidden \"pentagon\" ''N''<sub>5</sub> as a [[sublattice]].\n\n== Properties ==\nFor any ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' subgroups of a group with ''A'' ≤ ''C'' (''A'' subgroup of ''C'') then ''AB'' ∩ ''C'' = ''A(B ∩ C)''; the multiplication here is the [[product of subgroups]]. This property has been called the ''modular property of groups'' {{harv|Aschbacher|2000}} or ''([[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]'s) modular law'' ({{harvnb|Robinson|1996}}, {{harvnb|Cohn|2000}}). Since for two normal subgroups the product is actually the smallest subgroup containing the two, the normal subgroups form a [[modular lattice]].\n\nThe [[Lattice theorem]] establishes a [[Galois connection]] between the lattice of subgroups of a group and that of its quotients.\n\nThe [[Zassenhaus lemma]] gives an isomorphism between certain combinations of quotients and products in the lattice of subgroups.\n\nIn general, there is no restriction on the shape of the lattice of subgroups, in the sense that every lattice is isomorphic to a sublattice of the subgroup lattice of some group. Furthermore, every [[finite set|finite]] lattice is isomorphic to a sublattice of the subgroup lattice of some [[finite group]] {{harv|Schmidt|1994|p=9}}.\n\n== Characteristic lattices ==\nSubgroups with certain properties form lattices, but other properties do not.\n\n* [[Normal subgroup]]s always form a modular lattice. In fact, the essential property that guarantees that the lattice is modular is that subgroups commute with each other, i.e. that they are [[quasinormal subgroup]]s.\n* [[nilpotent group|Nilpotent]] normal subgroups form a lattice, which is (part of) the content of [[Fitting's theorem]].\n* In general, for any Fitting class ''F'', both the [[subnormal subgroup|subnormal]] ''F''-subgroups  and the normal ''F''-subgroups form lattices.  This includes the above with ''F'' the class of nilpotent groups, as well as other examples such as ''F'' the class of [[solvable group]]s.  A class of groups is called a Fitting class if it is closed under isomorphism, subnormal subgroups, and products of subnormal subgroups.\n* [[Center (group)|Central]] subgroups form a lattice.\n\nHowever, neither finite subgroups nor torsion subgroups form a lattice: for instance, the [[free product]] <math>\\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z} * \\mathbf{Z}/2\\mathbf{Z}</math> is generated by two torsion elements, but is infinite and contains elements of infinite order.\n\nThe fact that normal subgroups form a modular lattice is a particular case of a more general result, namely that in any [[Maltsev variety]] (of which groups are an example), the [[congruence lattice|lattice of congruences]] is modular {{harv|Kearnes|Kiss|2013}}.\n\n== Characterizing groups by their subgroup lattices ==\nLattice theoretic information about the lattice of subgroups can sometimes be used to infer information about the original group, an idea that goes back to the work of {{harvs|first=Øystein|last=Ore|authorlink=Øystein Ore|year=1937|year2=1938|txt}}. For instance, as Ore proved, a group is [[Locally cyclic group|locally cyclic]] if and only if its lattice of subgroups is [[Distributive lattice|distributive]]. If additionally the lattice satisfies the [[ascending chain condition]], then the group is cyclic.\n\nThe groups whose lattice of subgroups is a [[complemented lattice]] are called [[complemented group]]s {{harv|Zacher|1953}}, and the groups whose lattice of subgroups are [[modular lattice]]s are called [[Iwasawa group]]s or modular groups {{harv|Iwasawa|1941}}. Lattice-theoretic characterizations of this type also exist for [[solvable group]]s and [[perfect group]]s {{harv|Suzuki|1951}}.\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|first=M.|last=Aschbacher|title=Finite Group Theory|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-78675-1|page=6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal\n  | title = The significance of the system of subgroups for the structure of the group\n  | last= Baer|first=Reinhold\n  | journal = [[American Journal of Mathematics]]\n  | volume = 61\n  | issue = 1\n  | year = 1939\n  | pages = 1–44\n  | doi = 10.2307/2371383\n  | jstor = 2371383\n  | publisher = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n  | ref = harv}}\n*{{cite book|first=Paul Moritz|last=Cohn|title=Classic algebra|year=2000|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-87731-8|page=248|ref=harv}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Iwasawa | first1=Kenkiti | title=Über die endlichen Gruppen und die Verbände ihrer Untergruppen |mr=0005721 | year=1941 | journal=J.

      "text": "In [[computer security]], '''lattice-based access control''' ('''LBAC''') is a complex [[access control]] model based on the interaction between any combination of '''objects''' (such as resources, computers, and applications) and '''subjects''' (such as individuals, groups or organizations).  \n\nIn this type of label-based [[mandatory access control]] model, a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is used to define the levels of security that an object may have and that a subject may have access to.  The subject is only allowed to access an object if the security level of the subject is greater than or equal to that of the object.  \n\nMathematically, the security level access may also be expressed in terms of the lattice (a [[partial order]] set) where each object and subject have a greatest lower bound (meet) and least upper bound (join) of access rights.  For example, if two subjects ''A'' and ''B'' need access to an object, the security level is defined as the meet of the levels of ''A'' and ''B''.  In another example, if two objects ''X'' and ''Y'' are combined, they form another object ''Z'', which is assigned the security level formed by the join of the levels of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nLBAC is also known as a label-based access control (or ''rule-based access control'') restriction as opposed to [[role-based access control]] (RBAC).\n\nLattice based access control models were first formally defined by [[Dorothy E. Denning|Denning]] (1976); see also Sandhu (1993).\n\n== See also ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Access control list]]\n* [[Attribute-based access control]] (ABAC)\n* [[Bell-La Padula model]]\n* [[Biba Model]]\n* [[Capability-based security]]\n* [[Computer security model]]\n* [[Context-based access control]] (CBAC)\n* [[Discretionary access control]] (DAC)\n* [[Graph-based access control]] (GBAC)\n* [[Location-based authentication]]\n* [[Mandatory access control]] (MAC)\n* [[Organisation-based access control]] (OrBAC)\n* [[Risk-based authentication]]\n* [[Role-based access control]] (RBAC)\n* [[RSBAC|Rule-set-based access control (RSBAC)]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite journal\n  | author = Denning, Dorothy E.\n  | authorlink = Dorothy E.

If the union of the three paths is itself a path, the median ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') is equal to one of ''a'', ''b'', or ''c'', whichever of these three vertices is between the other two in the path.  If the subtree formed by the union of the three paths is not a path, the median of the three vertices is the central degree-three node of the subtree.\n\nAdditional examples of median graphs are provided by the [[grid graph]]s.  In a grid graph, the coordinates of the median ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') can be found as the median of the coordinates of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''.  Conversely, it turns out that, in every median graph, one may label the vertices by points in an [[integer lattice]] in such a way that medians can be calculated coordinatewise in this way.<ref>This follows immediately from the characterization of median graphs as retracts of hypercubes, described below.</ref>\n\n[[File:Squaregraph.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|A [[squaregraph]].]]\n[[Squaregraph]]s, planar graphs in which all interior faces are quadrilaterals and all interior vertices have four or more incident edges, are another subclass of the median graphs.<ref>{{harvtxt|Soltan|Zambitskii|Prisăcaru|1973}}; {{harvtxt|Chepoi|Dragan|Vaxès|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Chepoi|Fanciullini|Vaxès|2004}}.</ref>  A [[polyomino]] is a special case of a squaregraph and therefore also forms a median graph.{{sfnp|Klavžar|Škrekovski|2000}}\n\nThe [[simplex graph]] κ(''G'') of an arbitrary undirected graph ''G'' has a vertex for every [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] (complete subgraph) of ''G''; two vertex of κ(''G'') are linked by an edge if the corresponding cliques differ by one vertex  of ''G'' .  The simplex graph is always a median graph, in which the median of a given triple of cliques may be formed by using the [[majority function|majority rule]] to determine which vertices of the cliques to include.<ref>{{harvtxt|Barthélemy|Leclerc|Monjardet|1986}}, page 200.</ref>\n\nNo [[cycle graph]] of length other than four can be a median graph. Every such cycle has three vertices ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' such that the three shortest paths wrap all the way around the cycle without having a common intersection.  For such a triple of vertices, there can be no median.\n\n==Equivalent definitions==\nIn an arbitrary graph, for each two vertices ''a'' and ''b'', the minimal number of edges between them is called their ''[[Distance (graph theory)|distance]]'', denoted by ''d''(''x'',''y''). The ''interval'' of vertices that lie on shortest paths between ''a'' and ''b'' is defined as\n:''I''(''a'',''b'') = {''v'' | ''d''(''a'',''b'') = ''d(a,v)'' + ''d(v,b)''}. \nA median graph is defined by the property that, for every three vertices ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', these intervals intersect in a single point:\n:For all ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', |''I''(''a'',''b'') ∩ ''I''(''a'',''c'') ∩ ''I''(''b'',''c'')| = 1.\n\nEquivalently, for every three vertices ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' one can find a vertex ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') such that the [[Weights (graph theory)#Weighted graphs and networks|unweighted]] distances in the graph satisfy the equalities\n*''d''(''a'',''b'') = ''d''(''a'',''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'')) + ''d''(''m''(''a'',''b'',''c''),''b'')\n*''d''(''a'',''c'') = ''d''(''a'',''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'')) + ''d''(''m''(''a'',''b'',''c''),''c'')\n*''d''(''b'',''c'') = ''d''(''b'',''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'')) + ''d''(''m''(''a'',''b'',''c''),''c'')\nand ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') is the only vertex for which this is true.\n\nIt is also possible to define median graphs as the solution sets of [[2-satisfiability]] problems, as the retracts of [[Hypercube graph|hypercubes]], as the graphs of finite [[median algebra]]s, as the Buneman graphs of Helly split systems, and as the graphs of windex 2; see the sections below.\n\n==Distributive lattices and median algebras==\n[[File:Distributive lattice example.svg|thumb|upright|The graph of a distributive lattice, drawn as a [[Hasse diagram]].]]\n\nIn [[lattice theory]], the graph of a [[finite set|finite]] [[Lattice (order)|lattice]] has a vertex for each lattice element and an edge for each pair of elements in the [[covering relation]] of the lattice.  Lattices are commonly presented visually via [[Hasse diagram]]s, which are [[graph drawing|drawing]]s of graphs of lattices.

For every two vertices ''a'' and ''b'' of this graph, the interval ''I''(''a'',''b'') defined in lattice-theoretic terms above consists of the vertices on shortest paths from ''a'' to ''b'', and thus coincides with the graph-theoretic intervals defined earlier.  For every three lattice elements ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') is the unique intersection of the three intervals ''I''(''a'',''b''), ''I''(''a'',''c''), and ''I''(''b'',''c'').<ref>{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|Kiss|1947}}, Theorem 2.</ref>  Therefore, the graph of an arbitrary finite distributive lattice is a median graph.  Conversely, if a median graph ''G'' contains two vertices 0 and 1 such that every other vertex lies on a shortest path between the two (equivalently, ''m''(0,''a'',1) = ''a'' for all ''a''), then we may define a distributive lattice in which ''a'' ∧ ''b'' = ''m''(''a'',0,''b'') and ''a'' ∨ ''b'' = ''m''(''a'',1,''b''), and ''G'' will be the graph of this lattice.<ref>{{harvtxt|Birkhoff|Kiss|1947}}, p. 751.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Duffus|Rival|1983}} characterize graphs of distributive lattices directly as diameter-preserving retracts of hypercubes.  More generally, every median graph gives rise to a ternary operation ''m'' satisfying idempotence, commutativity, and distributivity, but possibly without the identity elements of a distributive lattice.  Every ternary operation on a finite set that satisfies these three properties (but that does not necessarily have 0 and 1 elements) gives rise in the same way to a median graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Avann|1961}}.</ref>\n\n==Convex sets and Helly families==\nIn a median graph, a set ''S'' of vertices is said to be [[Convex subgraph|convex]] if, for every two vertices ''a'' and ''b'' belonging to ''S'', the whole interval ''I''(''a'',''b'') is a subset of ''S''.  Equivalently, given the two definitions of intervals above, ''S'' is convex if it contains every shortest path between two of its vertices, or if it contains the median of every set of three points at least two of which are from ''S''.  Observe that the intersection of every pair of convex sets is itself convex.<ref>{{harvtxt|Knuth|2008}} calls such a set an ''ideal'', but a convex set in the graph of a distributive lattice is not the same thing as an [[Ideal (order theory)|ideal of the lattice]].</ref>\n\nThe convex sets in a median graph have the [[Helly property]]: if ''F'' is an arbitrary family of pairwise-intersecting convex sets, then all sets in ''F'' have a common intersection.<ref>{{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|2000}}, Theorem 2.40, p. 77.</ref>  For, if ''F'' has only three convex sets ''S'', ''T'', and ''U'' in it, with ''a'' in the intersection of the pair ''S'' and ''T'', ''b'' in the intersection of the pair ''T'' and ''U'', and ''c'' in the intersection of the pair ''S'' and ''U'', then every shortest path from ''a'' to ''b'' must lie within ''T'' by convexity, and similarly every shortest path between the other two pairs of vertices must lie within the other two sets; but ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'') belongs to paths between all three pairs of vertices, so it lies within all three sets, and forms part of their common intersection.  If ''F'' has more than three convex sets in it, the result follows by induction on the number of sets, for one may replace an arbitrary pair of sets in ''F'' by their intersection, using the result for triples of sets to show that the replaced family is still pairwise intersecting.\n\nA particularly important family of convex sets in a median graph, playing a role similar to that of [[Half-space (geometry)|halfspace]]s in Euclidean space, are the sets\n:''W<sub>uv</sub>'' = {''w'' | ''d''(''w'',''u'') &lt; ''d''(''w'',''v'')}\ndefined for each edge ''uv'' of the graph.  In words, ''W<sub>uv</sub>'' consists of the vertices closer to ''u'' than to ''v'', or equivalently the vertices ''w'' such that some shortest path from ''v'' to ''w'' goes through ''u''.  \nTo show that ''W<sub>uv</sub>'' is convex, let ''w''<sub>1</sub>''w''<sub>2</sub>...''w''<sub>''k''</sub> be an arbitrary shortest path that starts and ends within ''W<sub>uv</sub>''; then ''w''<sub>2</sub> must also lie within ''W<sub>uv</sub>'', for otherwise the two points ''m''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''(''u'',''w''<sub>1</sub>,''w''<sub>''k''</sub>) and ''m''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''(''m''<sub>1</sub>,''w''<sub>2</sub>...''w''<sub>''k''</sub>) could be shown (by considering the possible distances between the vertices) to be distinct medians of ''u'', ''w''<sub>1</sub>, and ''w''<sub>''k''</sub>, contradicting the definition of a median graph which requires medians to be unique.  Thus, each successive vertex on a shortest path between two vertices of ''W<sub>uv</sub>'' also lies within ''W<sub>uv</sub>'', so ''W<sub>uv</sub>'' contains all shortest paths between its nodes, one of the definitions of convexity.\n\nThe Helly property for the sets ''W<sub>uv</sub>'' plays a key role in the characterization of median graphs as the solution of 2-satisfiability instances, below.\n\n==2-satisfiability==\nMedian graphs have a close connection to the solution sets of [[2-satisfiability]] problems that can be used both to characterize these graphs and to relate them to adjacency-preserving maps of hypercubes.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bandelt|Chepoi|2008}}, Proposition 2.5, p.8; {{harvtxt|Chung|Graham|Saks|1989}};  {{harvtxt|Feder|1995}}; {{harvtxt|Knuth|2008}}, Theorem S, p. 72.</ref>\n\nA 2-satisfiability instance consists of a collection of [[Boolean variable]]s and a collection of ''clauses'', [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] on certain pairs of variables requiring those two variables to avoid certain combinations of values.  Usually such problems are expressed in [[conjunctive normal form]], in which each clause is expressed as a [[disjunction]] and the whole set of constraints is expressed as a [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] of clauses, such as\n:<math>(x_{11} \\lor x_{12}) \\land (x_{21} \\lor x_{22}) \\land \\cdots \\land (x_{n1} \\lor x_{n2}) \\land \\cdots.</math>  \nA solution to such an instance is an assignment of [[truth value]]s to the variables that satisfies all the clauses, or equivalently that causes the conjunctive normal form expression for the instance to become true when the variable values are substituted into it.  The family of all solutions has a natural structure as a median algebra, where the median of three solutions is formed by choosing each truth value to be the [[majority function]] of the values in the three solutions; it is straightforward to verify that this median solution cannot violate any of the clauses.  Thus, these solutions form a median graph, in which the neighbor of each solution is formed by negating a set of variables that are all constrained to be equal or unequal to each other.\n\nConversely, every median graph ''G'' may be represented in this way as the solution set to a 2-satisfiability instance.  To find such a representation, create a 2-satisfiability instance in which each variable describes the orientation of one of the edges in the graph (an assignment of a direction to the edge causing the graph to become [[directed graph|directed]] rather than undirected) and each constraint allows two edges to share a pair of orientations only when there exists a vertex ''v'' such that both orientations lie along shortest paths from other vertices to ''v''.  Each vertex ''v'' of ''G'' corresponds to a solution to this 2-satisfiability instance in which all edges are directed towards ''v''.  Each\nsolution to the instance must come from some vertex ''v'' in this way, where ''v'' is the common intersection of the sets ''W<sub>uw</sub>'' for edges directed from ''w'' to ''u''; this common intersection exists due to the Helly property of the sets ''W<sub>uw</sub>''.  Therefore, the solutions to this 2-satisfiability instance correspond one-for-one with the vertices of ''G''.\n\n==Retracts of hypercubes==\n[[File:Cube retraction.svg|thumb|Retraction of a cube onto a six-vertex subgraph.]]\nA ''retraction'' of a graph ''G'' is an adjacency-preserving map from ''G'' to one of its subgraphs.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hell|1976}}.</ref>  More precisely, it is [[graph homomorphism]] φ from ''G'' to itself such that φ(''v'') = ''v'' for each vertex ''v'' in the subgraph φ(G).  The image of the retraction is called a ''retract'' of ''G''.  \nRetractions are examples of [[metric map]]s: the distance between φ(''v'') and φ(''w''), for every ''v'' and ''w'', is at most equal to the distance between ''v'' and ''w'', and is equal whenever ''v'' and ''w'' both belong to φ(''G'').  Therefore, a retract must be an ''isometric subgraph'' of ''G'': distances in the retract equal those in ''G''.\n\nIf ''G'' is a median graph, and ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are an arbitrary three vertices of a retract φ(''G''), then φ(''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'')) must be a median of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', and so must equal ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'').  Therefore, φ(''G'') contains medians of all triples of its vertices, and must also be a median graph.  In other words, the family of median graphs is [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the retraction operation.<ref>{{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|2000}}, Proposition 1.33, p. 27.</ref>\n\nA [[hypercube graph]], in which the vertices correspond to all possible ''k''-bit [[bitvector]]s and in which two vertices are adjacent when the corresponding bitvectors differ in only a single bit, is a special case of a ''k''-dimensional grid graph and is therefore a median graph.  The median of three bitvectors ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' may be calculated by computing, in each bit position, the [[majority function]] of the bits of ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''.  Since median graphs are closed under retraction, and include the hypercubes, every retract of a hypercube is a median graph.\n\nConversely, every median graph must be the retract of a hypercube.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bandelt|1984}}; {{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|2000}}, Theorem 2.39, p.76; {{harvtxt|Knuth|2008}}, p. 74.</ref>  This may be seen from the connection, described above, between median graphs and 2-satisfiability: let ''G'' be the graph of solutions to a 2-satisfiability instance; without loss of generality this instance can be formulated in such a way that no two variables are always equal or always unequal in every solution.  Then the space of all truth assignments to the variables of this instance forms a hypercube.  For each clause, formed as the disjunction of two variables or their complements, in the 2-satisfiability instance, one can form a retraction of the hypercube in which truth assignments violating this clause are mapped to truth assignments in which both variables satisfy the clause, without changing the other variables in the truth assignment.  The composition of the retractions formed in this way for each of the clauses gives a retraction of the hypercube onto the solution space of the instance, and therefore gives a representation of ''G'' as the retract of a hypercube.  In particular, median graphs are isometric subgraphs of hypercubes, and are therefore [[partial cube]]s.  However, not all partial cubes are median graphs; for instance, a six-vertex [[cycle graph]] is a partial cube but is not a median graph.\n\nAs {{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|2000}} describe, an isometric embedding of a median graph into a hypercube may be constructed in time O(''m''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n''), where ''n'' and ''m'' are the numbers of vertices and edges of the graph respectively.<ref>The technique, which culminates in Lemma 7.10 on p.218 of Imrich and Klavžar, consists of applying an algorithm of {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}} to list all 4-cycles in the graph ''G'', forming an undirected graph having as its vertices the edges of ''G'' and having as its edges the opposite sides of a 4-cycle, and using the connected components of this derived graph to form hypercube coordinates.  An equivalent algorithm is {{harvtxt|Knuth|2008}}, Algorithm H, p. 69.</ref>\n\n==Triangle-free graphs and recognition algorithms==\n[[File:Median from triangle-free.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Converting a triangle-free graph into a median graph.]]\nThe problems of testing whether a graph is a median graph, and whether a graph is [[triangle-free graph|triangle-free]], both had been well studied when {{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|Mulder|1999}} observed that, in some sense, they are computationally equivalent.<ref>For previous median graph recognition algorithms, see {{harvtxt|Jha|Slutzki|1992}}, {{harvtxt|Imrich|Klavžar|1998}}, and {{harvtxt|Hagauer|Imrich|Klavžar|1999}}.  For triangle detection algorithms, see {{harvtxt|Itai|Rodeh|1978}}, {{harvtxt|Chiba|Nishizeki|1985}}, and {{harvtxt|Alon|Yuster|Zwick|1995}}.</ref>  Therefore, the best known time bound for testing whether a graph is triangle-free, O(''m''<sup>1.41</sup>),<ref>{{harvtxt|Alon|Yuster|Zwick|1995}}, based on [[Coppersmith–Winograd algorithm|fast matrix multiplication]].  Here ''m'' is the number of edges in the graph, and the [[big O notation]] hides a large constant factor; the best practical algorithms for triangle detection take time O(''m''<sup>3/2</sup>).  For median graph recognition, the time bound can be expressed either in terms of ''m'' or ''n'' (the number of vertices), as ''m'' = O(''n'' log ''n'').</ref> applies as well to testing whether a graph is a median graph, and any improvement in median graph testing algorithms would also lead to an improvement in algorithms for detecting triangles in graphs.\n\nIn one direction, suppose one is given as input a graph ''G'', and must test whether ''G'' is triangle-free.  From ''G'', construct a new graph ''H'' having as vertices each set of zero, one, or two adjacent vertices of ''G''.  Two such sets are adjacent in ''H'' when they differ by exactly one vertex.  An equivalent description of ''H'' is that it is formed by splitting each edge of ''G'' into a path of two edges, and adding a new vertex connected to all the original vertices of ''G''.  This graph ''H'' is by construction a partial cube, but it is a median graph only when ''G'' is triangle-free: if ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' form a triangle in ''G'', then {''a'',''b''}, {''a'',''c''}, and {''b'',''c''} have no median in ''H'', for such a median would have to correspond to the set {''a'',''b'',''c''}, but sets of three or more vertices of ''G'' do not form vertices in ''H''.  Therefore, ''G'' is triangle-free if and only if ''H'' is a median graph.  In the case that ''G'' is triangle-free, ''H'' is its [[simplex graph]].  An algorithm to test efficiently whether ''H'' is a median graph could by this construction also be used to test whether ''G'' is triangle-free.  This transformation preserves the computational complexity of the problem, for the size of ''H'' is proportional to that of ''G''.\n\nThe reduction in the other direction, from triangle detection to median graph testing, is more involved and depends on the previous median graph recognition algorithm of {{harvtxt|Hagauer|Imrich|Klavžar|1999}}, which tests several necessary conditions for median graphs in near-linear time.  The key new step involves using a [[breadth first search]] to partition the graph's vertices into levels according to their distances from some arbitrarily chosen root vertex, forming a graph from each level in which two vertices are adjacent if they share a common neighbor in the previous level, and searching for triangles in these graphs.  The median of any such triangle must be a common neighbor of the three triangle vertices; if this common neighbor does not exist, the graph is not a median graph.  If all triangles found in this way have medians, and the previous algorithm finds that the graph satisfies all the other conditions for being a median graph, then it must actually be a median graph.  This algorithm requires, not just the ability to test whether a triangle exists, but a list of all triangles in the level graph.  In arbitrary graphs, listing all triangles sometimes requires Ω(''m''<sup>3/2</sup>) time, as some graphs have that many triangles, however Hagauer et al. show that the number of triangles arising in the level graphs of their reduction is near-linear, allowing the Alon et al. fast matrix multiplication based technique for finding triangles to be used.\n\n==Evolutionary trees, Buneman graphs, and Helly split systems==\n[[File:Buneman graph.svg|thumb|upright=1.8|The Buneman graph for five types of mouse.]]\n[[Phylogeny]] is the inference of [[evolutionary tree]]s from observed characteristics of [[species]]; such a tree must place the species at distinct vertices, and may have additional ''latent vertices'', but the latent vertices are required to have three or more incident edges and must also be labeled with characteristics.  A characteristic is ''binary'' when it has only two possible values, and a set of species and their characteristics exhibit [[perfect phylogeny]] when there exists an evolutionary tree in which the vertices (species and latent vertices) labeled with any particular characteristic value form a contiguous subtree.  If a tree with perfect phylogeny is not possible, it is often desired to find one exhibiting [[maximum parsimony]], or equivalently, minimizing the number of times the endpoints of a tree edge have different values for one of the characteristics, summed over all edges and all characteristics.\n\n{{harvtxt|Buneman|1971}} described a method for inferring perfect phylogenies for binary characteristics, when they exist.  His method generalizes naturally to the construction of a median graph for any set of species and binary characteristics, which has been called the ''median network'' or ''Buneman graph''<ref>{{harvtxt|Mulder|Schrijver|1979}} described a version of this method for systems of characteristics not requiring any latent vertices, and {{harvtxt|Barthélémy|1989}} gives the full construction.  The Buneman graph name is given in {{harvtxt|Dress|Hendy|Huber|Moulton|1997}} and {{harvtxt|Dress|Huber|Moulton|1997}}.</ref> and is a type of [[phylogenetic network]].  Every maximum parsimony evolutionary tree embeds into the Buneman graph, in the sense that tree edges follow paths in the graph and the number of characteristic value changes on the tree edge is the same as the number in the corresponding path.  The Buneman graph will be a tree if and only if a perfect phylogeny exists; this happens when there are no two incompatible characteristics for which all four combinations of characteristic values are observed.\n\nTo form the Buneman graph for a set of species and characteristics, first, eliminate redundant species that are indistinguishable from some other species and redundant characteristics that are always the same as some other characteristic.  Then, form a latent vertex for every combination of characteristic values such that every two of the values exist in some known species.  In the example shown, there are small brown tailless mice, small silver tailless mice, small brown tailed mice, large brown tailed mice, and large silver tailed mice; the Buneman graph method would form a latent vertex corresponding to an unknown species of small silver tailed mice, because every pairwise combination (small and silver, small and tailed, and silver and tailed) is observed in some other known species.  However, the method would not infer the existence of large brown tailless mice, because no mice are known to have both the large and tailless traits.  Once the latent vertices are determined, form an edge between every pair of species or latent vertices that differ in a single characteristic.\n\nOne can equivalently describe a collection of binary characteristics as a ''split system'', a [[family of sets]] having the property that the [[complement set]] of each set in the family is also in the family.  This split system has a set for each characteristic value, consisting of the species that have that value.  When the latent vertices are included, the resulting split system has the [[Helly property]]: every pairwise intersecting subfamily has a common intersection.  In some sense median graphs are characterized as coming from Helly split systems: the pairs (''W<sub>uv</sub>'', ''W<sub>vu</sub>'') defined for each edge ''uv'' of a median graph form a Helly split system, so if one applies the Buneman graph construction to this system no latent vertices will be needed and the result will be the same as the starting graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mulder|Schrijver|1979}}.</ref>\n\n{{harvtxt|Bandelt|Forster|Sykes|Richards|1995}} and {{harvtxt|Bandelt|Macaulay|Richards|2000}} describe techniques for simplified hand calculation of the Buneman graph, and use this construction to visualize human genetic relationships.\n\n==Additional properties==\n[[File:Graph-Cartesian-product.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Cartesian product of graphs]] forms a median graph from two smaller median graphs.]]\n*The [[Cartesian product of graphs|Cartesian product]] of every two median graphs is another median graph.  Medians in the product graph may be computed by independently finding the medians in the two factors, just as medians in grid graphs may be computed by independently finding the median in each linear dimension.\n*The ''windex'' of a graph measures the amount of [[Look-ahead (backtracking)|lookahead]] needed to optimally solve a problem in which one is given a sequence of graph vertices ''s<sub>i</sub>'', and must find as output another sequence of vertices ''t<sub>i</sub>'' minimizing the sum of the distances {{math|''d''(''s<sub>i</sub>, t<sub>i</sub>'')}} and {{math|''d''(''t''<sub>''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>, ''t<sub>i</sub>'')}}.  Median graphs are exactly the graphs that have ''windex'' 2.  In a median graph, the optimal choice is to set {{math|1=''t<sub>i</sub>'' = ''m''(''t''<sub>''i''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>, ''s<sub>i</sub>'', ''s''<sub>''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sub>)}}.<ref name=\"cgs\"/>\n*The property of having a unique median is also called the ''unique Steiner point property''.<ref name=\"cgs\"/>  An optimal [[Steiner tree]] for three vertices ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in a median graph may be found as the union of three shortest paths, from ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' to ''m''(''a'',''b'',''c'').  {{harvtxt|Bandelt|Barthélémy|1984}} study more generally the problem of finding the vertex [[Geometric median|minimizing the sum of distances]] to each of a given set of vertices, and show that it has a unique solution for any odd number of vertices in a median graph.  They also show that this median of a set ''S'' of vertices in a median graph satisfies the [[Condorcet criterion]] for the winner of an [[election]]: compared to any other vertex, it is closer to a majority of the vertices in ''S''.\n*As with partial cubes more generally, every median graph with ''n'' vertices has at most (''n''/2) log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' edges.  However, the number of edges cannot be too small: {{harvtxt|Klavžar|Mulder|Škrekovski|1998}} prove that in every median graph the inequality {{math|2''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;2}} holds, where ''m'' is the number of edges and ''k'' is the dimension of the hypercube that the graph is a retract of.  This inequality is an equality if and only if the median graph contains no cubes.  This is a consequence of another identity for median graphs: the [[Euler characteristic]] Σ (-1)<sup>dim(''Q'')</sup> is always equal to one, where the sum is taken over all hypercube subgraphs ''Q'' of the given median graph.<ref>{{harvtxt|Škrekovski|2001}}.</ref>\n*The only [[regular graph|regular]] median graphs are the hypercubes.<ref>{{harvtxt|Mulder|1980}}.</ref>\n*Every median graph is a [[modular graph]].

As with all finite 2-dimensional lattices, its [[Hasse diagram]] is an [[st-planar graph|''st''-planar graph]].]]\n\nIn the branch of mathematics called [[order theory]], a '''modular lattice''' is a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] that satisfies the following self-[[duality (order theory)|dual]] condition:\n;'''Modular law''':{{Math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} implies {{Math|1=''a'' ∨ (''x'' ∧ ''b'') = (''a'' ∨ ''x'') ∧ ''b''}},\n\nwhere &nbsp;≤&nbsp; is the [[partial order]], and &nbsp;∨&nbsp; and &nbsp;∧&nbsp;(called [[join and meet]] respectively) are the operations of the lattice.  This phrasing emphasizes an interpretation in terms of projection onto the sublattice {{Math|[''a'', ''b'']}}, a fact known as the '''[[diamond isomorphism theorem]]'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/a/443947/40167|title=Why are modular lattices important?|website=Mathematics Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-09-17}}</ref>  An alternative phrasing, exchanging the roles of {{Mvar|x}} and {{Mvar|a}}, instead emphasizes that modular lattices form a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] in the sense of [[universal algebra]].\n\nModular lattices arise naturally in [[algebra]] and in many other areas of mathematics.  In these scenarios, modularity is an abstraction of the [[Second isomorphism theorem|2<sup>nd</sup> Isomorphism Theorem]].  For example, the subspaces of a [[vector space]] (and more generally the submodules of a [[module over a ring]]) form a modular lattice.\n\nIn a not necessarily modular lattice, there may still be elements {{Mvar|b}} for which the modular law holds in connection with arbitrary elements {{Mvar|x}} and {{Mvar|a}} (for {{Math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}}). Such an element is called a '''modular element'''. Even more generally, the modular law may hold for any {{Mvar|a}} and a fixed pair {{Math|(''x'', ''b'')}}. Such a pair is called a '''modular pair''', and there are various generalizations of modularity related to this notion and to [[semimodular lattice|semimodularity]].\n\nModular lattices are sometimes called '''Dedekind lattices''' after [[Richard Dedekind]], who discovered the modular identity in [[#History|several motivating examples]].\n\n==Introduction==\nThe modular law can be seen as a restricted [[associativity|associative law]] that connects the two lattice operations similarly to the way in which the associative law λ(μ''x'') = (λμ)''x'' for vector spaces connects multiplication in the field and scalar multiplication.\n\nThe restriction {{Math|''a'' ≤ ''b''}} is clearly necessary, since it follows from {{Math|1=''a'' ∨ (''x'' ∧ ''b'') = (''a'' ∨ ''x'') ∧ ''b''}}.  In other words, no lattice with more than one element satisfies the unrestricted consequent of the modular law.\n\nExchanging the roles of {{Mvar|a}} and {{Mvar|x}}, it is easy to see that {{Math|''x'' ≤ ''b''}} implies {{Math|1=''x'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = (''x'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ ''b''}} in every lattice. Therefore, the modular law can also be stated as\n\n;'''Modular law (variant)''': ''x'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''x'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') ≥ (''x'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ ''b''.\n\nBy substituting ''x'' with ''x'' ∧ ''b'', the modular law can be expressed as an equation that is required to hold unconditionally, as follows:\n;'''Modular identity''': (''x'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = [(''x'' ∧ ''b'') ∨ ''a''] ∧ ''b''.\nThis shows that, using terminology from [[universal algebra]], the modular lattices form a subvariety of the [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] of lattices. Therefore, all homomorphic images, [[sublattice]]s and direct products of modular lattices are again modular.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Smallest nonmodular lattice 2.svg|thumb|''N''<sub>5</sub>, the smallest non-modular lattice: {{nowrap|''x''∨(''a''∧''b'')}} = ''x''∨0 = ''x'' ≠ ''b'' = 1∧''b'' ={{nowrap|(''x''∨''a'')∧''b''}}.]]\nThe lattice of submodules of a [[module over a ring]] is modular.  As a special case, the lattice of subgroups of an [[abelian group]] is modular.\n\nThe lattice of [[normal subgroup]]s of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] is modular.  But in general the [[lattice of subgroups|lattice of all subgroups]] of a group is not modular.  For an example, the lattice of subgroups of the dihedral group of order 8 is not modular.\n\nThe smallest non-modular lattice is the \"pentagon\" lattice ''N''<sub>5</sub> consisting of five elements 0, 1, ''x'', ''a'', ''b'' such that 0 < ''x'' < ''b'' < 1, 0 < ''a'' < 1, and ''a'' is not comparable to ''x'' or to ''b''. For this lattice,\n:''x'' ∨ (''a'' ∧ ''b'') = ''x'' ∨ 0 = ''x'' < ''b'' = 1 ∧ ''b'' = (''x'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ ''b''\nholds, contradicting the modular law.

Then using absorption and modular identity:\n\n: ''c'' = (''c''∧''b'') ∨ ''c'' = (''a''∧''b'') ∨ ''c'' = ''a'' ∧ (''b''∨''c'') = ''a'' ∧ (''b''∨''a'') = ''a''\n\nFor the other direction, let the implication of the theorem hold in G. Let ''a'',''b'',''c'' be any elements in G, such that ''c'' ≤ ''a''. Let ''x'' = (''a''∧''b'') ∨ ''c'', ''y'' = ''a'' ∧ (''b''∨''c''). From the modular inequality immediately follows that ''x'' ≤ ''y''. If we show that ''x''∧''b'' = ''y''∧''b'', ''x''∨''b'' = ''y''∨''b'', then using the assumption ''x'' = ''y'' must hold. The rest of the proof is routine manipulation with infima, suprema and inequalities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Diamond isomorphism theorem ==\n\nFor any two elements ''a'',''b'' of a modular lattice, one can consider the intervals [''a'' ∧ ''b'', ''b''] and [''a'', ''a'' ∨ ''b'']. They are connected by order-preserving maps\n::φ: [''a'' ∧ ''b'', ''b''] → [''a'', ''a'' ∨ ''b''] and\n::ψ: [''a'', ''a'' ∨ ''b''] → [''a'' ∧ ''b'', ''b'']\nthat are defined by φ(''x'') = ''x'' ∨ ''a'' and ψ(''y'') = ''y'' ∧ ''b''.\n\n<gallery heights=\"180px\" widths=\"225px\">\nImage:Modular_pair.svg|In a modular lattice, the maps φ and ψ indicated by the arrows are mutually inverse isomorphisms.\nImage:Not a modular pair.svg|Failure of the diamond isomorphism theorem in a non-modular lattice.\n</gallery>\n\nThe composition ψφ is an order-preserving map from the interval [''a'' ∧ ''b'', ''b''] to itself which also satisfies the inequality ψ(φ(''x'')) = (''x'' ∨ ''a'') ∧ ''b'' ≥ ''x''. The example shows that this inequality can be strict in general. In a modular lattice, however, equality holds. Since the dual of a modular lattice is again modular, φψ is also the identity on [''a'', ''a'' ∨ ''b''], and therefore the two maps φ and ψ are isomorphisms between these two intervals. This result is sometimes called the '''diamond isomorphism theorem''' for modular lattices. A lattice is modular if and only if the diamond isomorphism theorem holds for every pair of elements.\n\nThe diamond isomorphism theorem for modular lattices is analogous to the second [[isomorphism theorem]] in algebra, and it is a generalization of the [[lattice theorem]].\n\n==Modular pairs and related notions==\n[[Image:Centred hexagon lattice D2.svg|thumb|right|The centred hexagon lattice ''S''<sub>7</sub>, also known as ''D''<sub>2</sub>, is M-symmetric but not modular.]]\nIn any lattice, a '''modular pair''' is a pair (''a,&nbsp;b'') of elements such that for all ''x'' satisfying ''a''&nbsp;∧&nbsp;''b'' ≤ ''x''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''b'', we have (''x''&nbsp;∨&nbsp;''a'')&nbsp;∧&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'', i.e. if one half of the diamond isomorphism theorem holds for the pair.<ref>The [[French language|French]] term for modular pair is ''couple modulaire''. A pair (''a,&nbsp;b'') is called a ''paire modulaire'' in French if both (''a,&nbsp;b'') and (''b,&nbsp;a'') are modular pairs.</ref> An element ''b'' of a lattice is called a '''(right) modular element''' if (''a,&nbsp;b'') is a modular pair for all elements ''a''.\n\nA lattice with the property that if (''a,&nbsp;b'') is a modular pair, then (''b,&nbsp;a'') is also a modular pair is called an '''M-symmetric lattice'''.<ref>Some authors, e.g. Fofanova (2001), refer to such lattices as ''semimodular lattices''. Since every M-symmetric lattice is [[semimodular lattice|semimodular]] and the converse holds for lattices of finite length, this can only lead to confusion for infinite lattices.</ref> Since a lattice is modular if and only if all pairs of elements are modular, clearly every modular lattice is M-symmetric. In the lattice ''N''<sub>5</sub> described above, the pair (''b,&nbsp;a'') is modular, but the pair (''a,&nbsp;b'') is not. Therefore, ''N''<sub>5</sub> is not M-symmetric. The centred hexagon lattice ''S''<sub>7</sub> is M-symmetric but not modular. Since ''N''<sub>5</sub> is a sublattice of ''S''<sub>7</sub>, it follows that the M-symmetric lattices do not form a subvariety of the variety of lattices.\n\nM-symmetry is not a self-dual notion. A '''dual modular pair''' is a pair which is modular in the [[duality (order theory)|dual]] lattice, and a lattice is called dually M-symmetric or '''M<sup>*</sup>-symmetric''' if its dual is M-symmetric. It can be shown that a finite lattice is modular if and only if it is M-symmetric and M<sup>*</sup>-symmetric. The same equivalence holds for infinite lattices which satisfy the [[ascending chain condition]] (or the descending chain condition).\n\nSeveral less important notions are also closely related. A lattice is '''cross-symmetric''' if for every modular pair (''a,&nbsp;b'') the pair (''b,&nbsp;a'') is dually modular. Cross-symmetry implies M-symmetry but not M<sup>*</sup>-symmetry. Therefore, cross-symmetry is not equivalent to dual cross-symmetry. A lattice with a least element 0 is '''⊥-symmetric''' if for every modular pair (''a,&nbsp;b'') satisfying ''a''&nbsp;∧&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 the pair (''b,&nbsp;a'') is also modular.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Free modular lattice with 3 generators (x,y,z).gif|thumb|Free modular lattice generated by three elements {x,y,z}]]\nThe definition of modularity is due to [[Richard Dedekind]], who published most of the relevant papers after his retirement.\nIn a paper published in 1894{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} he studied lattices, which he called ''dual groups'' ({{lang-de|Dualgruppen}}) as part of his \"algebra of [[Module (mathematics)|modules]]\" and observed that ideals satisfy what we now call the modular law. He also observed that for lattices in general, the modular law is equivalent to its dual.\n\nIn another paper in 1897, Dedekind studied the lattice of divisors with gcd and lcm as operations, so that the lattice order is given by divisibility.<ref name=\"Dedekind.1897\">{{Citation | contribution-url=http://digisrv-1.biblio.etc.tu-bs.de:8080/docportal/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/DocPortal_derivate_00006737/V.C.1596.pdf | last1=Dedekind | first1=Richard | author1-link=Richard Dedekind | contribution=Über Zerlegungen von Zahlen durch ihre grössten gemeinsamen Theiler | title=Festschrift der Herzogl.

While the term ''skew lattice'' can be used to refer to any non-commutative generalization of a lattice, since 1989 it has been used primarily as follows.\n\n==Definition==\nA '''skew lattice''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' equipped with two [[associative]], [[idempotent]]  [[binary operation]]s <math>\\wedge</math> and <math>\\vee</math>, called ''meet'' and ''join'', that validate the following dual pair of absorption laws\n\n<center><math>x\\wedge (x\\vee y) = x = (y\\vee x)\\wedge x </math>,</center>\n\n<center><math> x\\vee (x\\wedge y) = x = (y\\wedge x)\\vee x </math>.</center>\n\nGiven that <math>\\vee </math> and <math>\\wedge </math> are associative and idempotent, these identities are equivalent to validating the following dual pair of statements:\n\n<center><math>x\\vee y= x</math> if <math>x\\wedge y=y</math>,</center>\n\n<center><math>x\\wedge y=x</math> if <math>x\\vee y=y</math>.<ref name=\"Leech, J 1989\">Leech, J, Skew lattices in rings, Algebra Universalis, 26(1989), 48-72.</ref> </center>\n\n==Historical background==\nFor over 60 years, noncommutative variations of lattices have been studied with differing motivations.  For some the motivation has been an interest in the conceptual boundaries of [[lattice theory]]; for others it was a search for noncommutative forms of [[Mathematical logic|logic]] and [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]]; and for others it has been the behavior of [[idempotent]]s in [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]].  A ''noncommutative lattice'', generally speaking, is an [[Algebraic structure|algebra]] <math>(S; \\wedge, \\vee)</math> where <math>\\wedge </math> and <math>\\vee </math> are [[Associative operation|associative]], [[idempotent]] [[Binary operation|binary]] [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]] connected by [[Absorption Identities|absorption identities]] guaranteeing that <math>\\wedge </math> in some way dualizes <math>\\vee </math>. The precise identities chosen depends upon the underlying motivation, with differing choices producing distinct [[Variety (universal algebra)|varieties of algebras]].  \n\n[[Pascual Jordan]], motivated by questions in [[quantum logic]], initiated a study of ''noncommutative lattices'' in his 1949 paper, ''Über Nichtkommutative Verbände'',<ref name=\"JO49\">Jordan, P. Uber Nichtkommutative Verbände, Arch. Math. 2 (1949), 56–59.</ref> choosing the absorption identities\n\n<center><math>x\\wedge (y\\vee x) = x = (x\\wedge y)\\vee x.</math></center>\n\nHe referred to those algebras satisfying them as ''Schrägverbände''.  By varying or augmenting these identities, Jordan and others obtained a number of varieties of noncommutative lattices.\nBeginning with Jonathan Leech's 1989 paper, ''Skew lattices in rings'',<ref name=\"LE89\">Leech, J, Skew lattices in rings, Algebra Universalis, 26(1989), 48-72</ref> skew lattices as defined above have been the primary objects of study.  This was aided by previous results about [[Band (mathematics)|band]]s. This was especially the case for many of the basic properties.\n\n==Basic properties==\n'''Natural partial order and natural quasiorder'''\n\nIn a skew lattice <math>S</math>, the natural [[partial order]] is defined by <math>y\\leq x</math> if <math>x \\wedge y = y = y \\wedge x</math>, or dually, <math>x \\vee y = x = y \\vee x</math>. The natural [[preorder]] on <math>S</math> is given by <math>y \\preceq x</math> if <math>y \\wedge x\\wedge y = y</math> or dually <math>x \\vee y \\vee x = x</math>. While <math>\\leq</math> and <math>\\preceq</math> agree on lattices, <math>\\leq</math> properly refines <math>\\preceq</math> in the noncommutative case. The induced natural [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]] <math>D</math> is defined by <math>xDy</math> if <math>x \\preceq y \\preceq x</math>, that is, <math>x \\wedge y \\wedge x = x </math>\nand <math>y \\wedge x \\wedge y = y</math> or dually, <math>x \\vee y \\vee x = x</math> and <math>y \\vee x \\vee y = y</math>. The blocks of the partition <math>S/D</math> are\nlattice ordered by <math>A > B</math> if <math>a \\in A</math> and <math>b \\in B</math> exist such that <math>a > b</math>. This permits us to draw [[Hasse diagram]]s of skew lattices such as the following pair:\n\n<center>[[File:Skew diag.png]]</center>\n\nE.g., in the diagram on the left above, that <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are <math>D</math> related is expressed by the dashed\nsegment. The slanted lines reveal the natural partial order between elements of the distinct <math>D</math>-classes. The elements <math>1</math>, <math>c</math> and <math>0</math> form the singleton <math>D</math>-classes.\n\n'''Rectangular Skew Lattices'''\n\nSkew lattices consisting of a single <math>D</math>-class are called '''rectangular'''. They are characterized by the equivalent identities: <math>x \\wedge y \\wedge x = x</math>, <math>y \\vee x \\vee y = y</math> and <math>x \\vee y = y \\wedge x</math>. Rectangular skew lattices are isomorphic to skew lattices having the following construction (and conversely): given nonempty\nsets <math>L</math> and <math>R</math>, on <math>L \\times R</math> define <math>(x, y) \\vee (z , w ) = (z , y)</math> and <math>(x, y) \\wedge (z , w ) = (x, w )</math>. The <math>D</math>-class partition of a skew lattice <math>S</math>, as indicated in the above diagrams, is the unique partition of <math>S</math> into its maximal rectangular subalgebras, Moreover, <math>D</math> is a congruence with the induced quotient algebra <math>S/ D</math> being the maximal lattice image of <math>S</math> , thus making every skew lattice <math>S</math> a lattice of rectangular subalgebras. This is the Clifford–McLean Theorem for skew lattices, first given for bands separately by [[Alfred H. Clifford|Clifford]] and McLean. It is also known as ''the First Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices''.\n\n'''Right (left) handed skew lattices and the Kimura factorization'''\n\nA skew lattice is right-handed if it satisfies the identity <math>x\\wedge y \\wedge x = y \\wedge x</math> or dually, <math>x \\vee y \\vee x = x \\vee y</math>.\nThese identities essentially assert that <math>x \\wedge y = y</math> and <math>x \\vee y = x</math> in each <math>D</math>-class. Every skew lattice <math>S</math> has a unique maximal right-handed image <math>S/ L</math> where the congruence <math>L</math> is defined by <math>xLy</math> if both <math>x \\wedge y = x</math> and <math>y \\wedge x = y </math> (or dually, <math>x \\vee y = y</math> and <math>y \\vee x = x</math>). Likewise a skew lattice is left-handed if <math>x \\wedge y = x</math> and <math>x \\vee y = y</math> in each <math>D</math>-class. Again the maximal left-handed image of a skew lattice <math>S</math> is the image <math>S/ R</math> where the congruence <math>R</math> is defined in dual fashion to <math>L</math>. Many examples of skew lattices are either right or left-handed. In the lattice of congruences, <math>R \\vee L = D</math> and <math>R \\cap L</math> is the identity congruence <math>\\Delta </math>. The induced epimorphism <math>S\\rightarrow S/D</math> factors through both induced epimorphisms <math>S \\rightarrow S/L</math> and <math>S \\rightarrow S/R</math>. Setting <math>T = S/D</math>, the homomorphism <math>k : S \\rightarrow S/L \\times S/R</math> defined by <math>k(x) = (L_x, R_x)</math>, induces an isomorphism <math>k* : S\\sim S/ L \\times _T S/R</math>. This is the Kimura factorization of <math>S</math> into a fibred product of its maximal right and left-handed images.\n\n<center>[[File:Skew pullback.png]]</center>\n\nLike the Clifford–McLean Theorem, Kimura factorization (or the ''Second Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices'') was first given for regular bands (that satisfy the middle absorption\nidentity, <math>xyxzx = xyzx</math> ). Indeed, both <math>\\wedge </math> and <math>\\vee </math> are regular band operations. The above symbols <math>D</math>, <math>R</math> and <math>L</math> come, of course, from basic semigroup theory.<ref name=\"LE89\"/><ref name=\"LE96\">Leech, J, Recent developments in the theory of skew lattices, [[Semigroup Forum]], 52(1996), 7-24.</ref><ref name=\"LE05\">Leech, J, Magic squares, finite planes and simple quasilattices, Ars Combinatoria 77(2005), 75-96.</ref><ref name=\"LE93\">Leech, J, The geometry of skew lattices, [[Semigroup Forum]], 52(1993), 7-24.</ref><ref name=\"LE92\">Leech, J, Normal skew lattices, [[Semigroup Forum]], 44(1992), 1-8.</ref><ref name=\"KA07\">Cvetko-Vah, K, Internal decompositions of skew lattices, Communications in Algebra, 35 (2007), 243-247</ref><ref name=\"CV06B\">Cvetko-Vah, K, A new proof of Spinks’ Theorem, [[Semigroup Forum]] 73 (2006), 267-272.</ref><ref name=\"LA02\">Laslo, G and Leech, J, Green’s relations on noncommutative lattices, Acta Sci.

Rectangular skew lattices, left-handed and right-handed skew lattices all form subvarieties that are central to the basic structure theory of skew lattices. Here are several\nmore.\n\n'''Symmetric Skew Lattices'''\n\nA skew lattice S is symmetric if for any <math>x, y \\in S</math> , <math>x \\wedge y = y \\wedge x</math> if <math>x \\vee y = y \\vee x</math>. Occurrences of commutation are thus unambiguous for such skew lattices, with subsets of pairwise commuting elements generating commutative subalgebras, i.e., sublattices. (This is not true for skew lattices in general.) Equational bases for this subvariety, first given by Spinks<ref name=\"SP98\">Spinks, M, Automated deduction in non-commutative lattice theory, Tech. Report 3/98, Monash U,  GSCIT, 1998</ref> are:\n<math>x \\vee y \\vee (x \\wedge y) = (y \\wedge x) \\vee y \\vee x</math> and <math>x \\wedge y \\wedge (x \\vee y) = (y \\vee x) \\wedge y \\wedge x</math>.\nA '''lattice section''' of a skew lattice <math>S</math> is a sublattice <math>T</math> of <math>S</math> meeting each <math>D</math>-class of <math>S</math> at a single element. <math>T</math> is thus an internal copy of the lattice <math>S/ D</math> with the composition <math>T \\subset S \\rightarrow S/D</math> being an isomorphism. All symmetric skew lattices for which |S/D| \\leq \\aleph_0, admit a lattice section.<ref name=\"LA02\"/> Symmetric or not, having a lattice section <math>T</math> guarantees that <math>S</math> also has internal copies of <math>S/ L</math> and <math>S/ R</math> given respectively by <math>T [R] = \\bigcup_{t\\in T} R_t</math> and <math>T [L] = \\bigcup_{t\\in T}  L_t</math>, where <math>R_t</math> and <math>Lt</math> are the <math>R</math> and <math>L</math> congruence classes of <math>t</math> in <math>T</math> . Thus <math>T [ R] \\subset S \\rightarrow S/L</math> and <math>T [L] \\subset S \\rightarrow S/R</math> are isomorphisms.<ref name=\"KA07\"/> This leads to a commuting diagram of embedding dualizing the preceding Kimura diagram.\n\n<center>[[File:Skew lsection.png]]</center>\n\n'''Cancellative Skew Lattices'''\n\nA skew lattice is cancellative if <math>x \\vee y = x \\vee z</math> and <math>x \\wedge y = x \\wedge z</math> implies <math>y = z</math> and likewise <math>x \\vee z = y \\vee z</math> and <math>x \\wedge z = y \\wedge z</math> implies <math>x = y</math>. Cancellatice skew lattices are symmetric and can be shown to form a variety. Unlike lattices, they need not be distributive, and conversely.\n\n'''Distributive Skew Lattices'''\n\nDistributive skew lattices are determined by the identities:\n<math>x \\wedge (y \\vee z ) \\wedge x = (x \\wedge y \\wedge x) \\vee (x \\wedge z \\wedge x)</math>  (D1)\n<math>x \\vee (y \\wedge z ) \\vee x = (x \\vee y \\vee x) \\wedge (x \\vee z \\vee x).</math> (D'1)\n\nUnlike lattices, (D1) and (D'1) are not equivalent in general for skew lattices, but they are for symmetric skew lattices.<ref name=\"CV06B\"/><ref>Spinks, M, Automated deduction in non-commutative lattice theory, Tech. Report 3/98, Monash University, Gippsland School of Computing and Information Technology, June 1998</ref><ref name=\"SP00\"/> The condition (D1) can be strengthened to <math>x \\wedge (y \\vee z ) \\wedge w = (x \\wedge y \\wedge w) \\vee (x \\wedge z \\wedge w) </math> (D2) in which case (D'1) is a consequence. A skew lattice <math>S</math> satisfies both (D2) and its dual, <math>x \\vee (y \\wedge z ) \\vee w = (x \\vee y \\vee w) \\wedge (x \\vee z \\vee w)</math>, if and only if it factors as the product of a distributive lattice and a rectangular skew lattice. In this latter case (D2) can be strengthened to <math>x \\wedge (y \\vee z ) = (x \\wedge y) \\vee (x \\wedge z )</math> and <math>(y \\vee z ) \\wedge w = (y \\wedge w) \\vee (z \\wedge w)</math>. (D3)\nOn its own, (D3) is equivalent to (D2) when symmetry is added.<ref name=\"LE89\"/> We thus have six subvarieties of skew lattices determined respectively by (D1), (D2), (D3) and their duals.\n\n'''Normal Skew Lattices'''\n\nAs seen above, <math>\\wedge </math> and <math>\\vee </math> satisfy the identity <math>xyxzx = xyzx</math>. Bands satisfying the stronger identity, <math>xyzx = xzyx</math>, are called normal. A skew lattice is normal skew if it satisfies\n\n<math>x \\wedge y \\wedge z \\wedge x = x \\wedge z \\wedge y \\wedge x. (N) </math>\n\nFor each element a in a normal skew lattice <math>S</math>, the set <math>a \\wedge S \\wedge a</math> defined by { <math>a \\wedge x \\wedge a | x \\in S </math>} or equivalently {<math> x \\in S | x\\leq a </math>} is a sublattice of <math>S</math>, and conversely. (Thus normal skew lattices have also been called local lattices.) When both <math>\\wedge</math> and <math>\\vee</math> are normal, <math>S</math> splits isomorphically into a product <math>T \\times D</math> of a lattice <math>T</math> and a rectangular skew lattice <math>D</math>, and conversely. Thus both normal skew lattices and split skew lattices form varieties. Returning to distribution, <math>(D2) = (D1) + (N)</math> so that <math>(D2)</math> characterizes the variety of distributive, normal skew lattices, and (D3) characterizes the variety of symmetric, distributive, normal skew lattices.\n\n'''Categorical Skew Lattices'''\n\nA skew lattice is categorical if nonempty composites of coset bijections are coset bijections. Categorical skew lattices form a variety. Skew lattices in rings and normal skew lattices are examples\nof algebras on this variety.<ref name=\"LE96\"/> Let <math>a > b > c</math> with <math>a \\in A</math>, <math>b \\in B</math> and <math>c \\in C</math>, <math>\\varphi</math> be the coset bijection from <math>A</math> to <math>B</math> taking <math>a</math> to <math>b</math>, <math>\\psi</math> be the coset bijection from <math>B</math> to <math>C</math> taking <math>b</math> to <math>c</math> and finally <math>\\chi</math> be the coset bijection from <math>A</math> to <math>C</math> taking <math>a</math> to <math>c</math>. A skew lattice <math>S</math> is categorical if one always has the equality <math>\\psi \\circ \\varphi = \\chi</math>, i.e. , if the\ncomposite partial bijection <math>\\psi \\circ \\varphi</math> if nonempty is a coset bijection from a <math>C</math> -coset of <math>A</math> to an <math>A</math>-coset\nof <math>C</math> .

(0)\n\nA Boolean skew lattice is a symmetric, distributive normal skew lattice with 0, <math>(S ; \\vee, \\wedge, 0)</math>, such that <math>a \\wedge S \\wedge a</math> is a Boolean lattice for each <math>a \\in S </math>. Given such skew lattice S, a difference operator \\ is defined by x\\ y = <math>x - x \\wedge y \\wedge x</math> where the latter is evaluated in the Boolean lattice <math>x \\wedge S \\wedge x</math>.<ref name=\"Leech, J 1989\"/> In the presence of (D3) and (0), \\ is characterized by the identities:\n<math>y \\wedge x/y = 0 = x/y \\wedge y</math> and <math>(x \\wedge y \\wedge x) \\vee x/y = x = x/y \\vee (x \\wedge y \\wedge x). (S B)</math>\nOne thus has a variety of skew Boolean algebras <math>(S ; \\vee, \\wedge, /, 0)</math> characterized by identities (D3), (0) and (S B). A primitive skew Boolean algebra consists of 0 and a single non-0 D-class. Thus it is the result of adjoining a 0 to a rectangular skew lattice D via (0) with <math>x/y = x</math>, if <math>y = 0</math>\nand <math>0</math> otherwise. Every skew Boolean algebra is a subdirect product of primitive algebras. Skew Boolean algebras play an important role in the study of discriminator varieties and other generalizations in universal algebra of Boolean behavior.\n<ref name=\"BI76\">Bignall, R.

For all <math>x, y \\in A</math> set <math>x \\wedge y = xy</math> and <math>x \\vee y = x + y - xy </math>.\n\nClearly <math>\\wedge </math> but also <math>\\vee </math> is [[associative]]. If a subset <math>S \\subseteq E(A)</math> is closed under <math>\\wedge </math> and <math>\\vee </math>, then <math>(S, \\wedge, \\vee)</math> is a distributive, cancellative skew lattice. To find such skew lattices in <math>E(A)</math> one looks at bands in <math>E(A)</math>, especially the ones that are maximal with respect to some constraint. In fact, every multiplicative band in <math>()</math> that is maximal with respect to being right regular (= ) is also closed under <math>\\vee </math> and so forms a right-handed skew lattice. In general, every right regular band in <math>E(A)</math> generates a right-handed skew lattice in <math>E(A)</math>. Dual remarks also hold for left regular bands (bands satisfying the identity <math>xyx = xy</math>) in <math>E(A)</math>. Maximal regular bands need not to be closed under <math>\\vee </math> as defined; counterexamples are easily found using multiplicative rectangular bands. These cases are closed, however, under the cubic variant of <math>\\vee </math> defined by <math>x \\nabla y = x + y + yx - xyx - yxy </math> since in these cases <math>x \\nabla y</math> reduces to <math>yx</math> to give the dual rectangular band. By replacing the condition of regularity by normality <math>(xyz w = xz yw)</math>, every maximal normal multiplicative band <math>S</math> in <math>E(A)</math> is also closed under <math>\\nabla</math> with <math>(S ; \\wedge, \\vee, /, 0)</math>, where <math>x/y = x - xyx</math>, forms a Boolean skew lattice. When <math>E(A)</math> itself is closed under multiplication, then it is a normal band and thus forms a Boolean skew lattice. In fact, any skew Boolean algebra can be embedded into such an algebra.<ref name=\"CV05A\">Cvetko-Vah, K, Skew lattices in matrix rings, Algebra Universalis 53 (2005), 471-479.</ref> When A has a multiplicative identity <math>1</math>, the condition that <math>E(A)</math> is multiplicatively closed is well-known to imply that <math>E(A)</math> forms a Boolean algebra.

Given such a skew lattice <math>S</math> with <math>D</math>-classes <math>A > B</math> in <math>S/D</math>, then for any <math>a \\in A</math> and <math>b \\in B</math>, the subsets\n\n<math>A \\wedge b \\wedge A =</math>{<math>u \\wedge b \\wedge u : u \\in A</math>} <math>\\subseteq B</math>   and   <math>B \\vee a \\vee B =</math> {<math>v \\vee a \\vee v : v \\in B</math>} <math>\\subseteq A</math>\n\nare called, respectively, ''cosets of A in B'' and ''cosets of B in A''.  These cosets partition B and A with <math>b \\in A\\wedge b\\wedge A</math> and <math>a \\in B\\wedge a\\wedge B</math>.  Cosets are always rectangular subalgebras in their <math>D</math>-classes.  What is more, the partial order <math>\\geq </math> induces a coset bijection <math>\\varphi : B \\vee a \\vee B \\rightarrow A \\wedge b \\wedge A</math> defined by:\n\n<math>\\phi (x) = y</math>  iff  <math>x > y</math>, for <math>x \\in B \\vee a \\vee B</math> and <math>y \\in A \\wedge b \\wedge A</math>.\n\nCollectively, coset bijections describe <math>\\geq </math> between the subsets <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>.  They also determine <math>\\vee </math> and <math>\\wedge</math> for pairs of elements from distinct <math>D</math>-classes.  Indeed, given <math>a \\in A</math> and <math>b \\in B</math>, let <math>\\varphi </math> be the\ncost bijection between the cosets <math>B\\vee a\\vee B</math> in <math>A</math> and <math>A \\wedge b \\wedge A</math> in <math>B</math>.  Then:\n\n<math>a\\vee b = a\\vee \\varphi -1(b), b\\vee a = \\varphi -1(b)\\vee a</math>  and <math> a\\wedge b = \\varphi(a)\\wedge b , b\\wedge a = b\\wedge \\varphi (a)</math>.\n\nIn general, given <math>a, c \\in A</math> and <math>b, d \\in B</math> with <math>a > b</math> and <math>c > d</math>, then <math>a, c</math> belong to a common <math>B</math>- coset in <math>A</math> and <math>b, d</math> belong to a common <math>A</math>-coset in <math>B</math> if and only if <math>a > b // c > d</math>.  Thus each coset bijection is, in some sense, a maximal collection of mutually parallel pairs <math>a > b</math>.\n\nEvery primitive skew lattice <math>S</math> factors as the fibred product of its maximal left and right- handed primitive images <math>S/R \\times_2 S/L</math>.  Right-handed primitive skew lattices are constructed as follows.  Let <math>A = \\cup _i A_i</math> and <math>B = \\cup _j B_j</math> be partitions of disjoint nonempty sets <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, where all <math>A_i</math> and <math>B_j</math> share a common size.  For each pair <math>i, j</math> pick a fixed bijection <math>\\varphi_i,j</math> from <math>A_i</math> onto <math>B_j</math>.  On <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> separately set <math>x\\wedge y = y</math> and <math>x\\vee y = x</math>; but given <math>a \\in A</math> and <math>b \\in B</math>, set\n\n<math>a \\vee b = a, b \\vee a = a', a \\wedge b = b</math> and <math>b \\wedge a = b' </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\varphi_{i,j}(a') = b</math> and <math>\\varphi_{i,j}(a) = b'</math> with <math>a'</math> belonging to the cell <math>A_i</math> of <math>a</math> and <math>b'</math> belonging to the cell <math>B_j</math> of <math>b</math>.  The various <math>\\varphi i,j</math> are the coset bijections.  This is illustrated in the following partial Hasse diagram where <math>|A_i| = |B_j| = 2</math> and the arrows indicate the <math>\\varphi_{i,j}</math> -outputs and <math>\\geq </math> from <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>.\n\n<center>[[File:Skew primitive.png]]</center>\n\nOne constructs left-handed primitive skew lattices in dual fashion.  All right [left] handed primitive skew lattices can be constructed in this fashion.<ref name=\"LE89\"/>\n\n==The coset structure of skew lattices==\nA nonrectangular skew lattice <math>S</math> is covered by its maximal primitive skew lattices: given comparable <math>D</math>-classes <math>A > B</math> in <math>S/D</math>, <math>A \\cup B</math> forms a maximal primitive subalgebra of <math>S</math> and every <math>D</math>-class in <math>S</math> lies in such a subalgebra.  The coset structures on these primitive subalgebras combine to determine the outcomes <math>x\\vee y</math> and <math>x\\wedge y</math> at least when <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are comparable under <math>\\preceq </math>.  It turns out that <math>x\\vee y</math> and <math>x\\wedge y</math> are determined in general by cosets and their bijections, although in\na slightly less direct manner than the <math>\\preceq </math>-comparable case.  In particular, given two incomparable D-classes A and B with join D-class J and meet D-class <math>M</math> in <math>S/D</math>, interesting connections arise between the two coset decompositions of J (or M) with respect to A and B.<ref name=\"LE96\"/>\n\n<center>[[File:Skew diamond.png]]</center>\n\nThus a skew lattice may be viewed as a coset atlas of rectangular skew lattices placed on the vertices of a lattice and coset bijections between them, the latter seen as partial isomorphisms\nbetween the rectangular algebras with each coset bijection determining a corresponding pair of cosets.  This perspective gives, in essence, the Hasse diagram of the skew lattice, which is easily\ndrawn in cases of relatively small order.  (See the diagrams in Section 3 above.) Given a chain of D-classes <math>A > B > C</math> in <math>S/D</math>, one has three sets of coset bijections: from A to B, from B to C and from A to C.  In general, given coset bijections <math>\\varphi: A \\rightarrow B</math> and <math>\\psi: B \\rightarrow C</math>, the composition of partial bijections <math>\\psi \\varphi </math> could be empty.  If it is not, then a unique coset bijection <math>\\chi: A \\rightarrow C </math> exists such that <math>\\psi \\varphi \\subseteq \\chi </math>.  (Again, <math>\\chi </math> is a bijection between a pair of cosets in <math>A</math> and <math>C</math>.)  This inclusion can be strict.  It is always an equality (given <math>\\psi \\varphi \\neq \\empty </math>) on a given skew lattice S precisely when S is categorical.  In this case, by including the identity maps on each rectangular D-class and adjoining empty bijections between properly comparable D-classes, one has a category of rectangular algebras and coset bijections between them.   The simple examples in Section 3 are categorical.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Semigroup|Semigroup Theory]]\n*[[Lattice theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Skew Lattice}}\n[[Category:Lattice theory]]\n[[Category:Semigroup theory]]"

Each grouping describes a different order in which the objects may be combined by a [[binary operation]]; in the Tamari lattice, one grouping is ordered before another if the second grouping may be obtained from the first by only rightward applications of the [[associativity|associative law]] (''xy'')''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''(''yz''). For instance, applying this law with ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'', ''y''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''bc'', and ''z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''d'' gives the expansion (''a''(''bc''))''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''((''bc'')''d''), so in the ordering of the Tamari lattice (''a''(''bc''))''d''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''((''bc'')''d'').\n\nIn this partial order, any two groupings ''g''<sub>1</sub> and ''g''<sub>2</sub> have a greatest common predecessor, the ''meet'' ''g''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;∧&nbsp;''g''<sub>2</sub>, and a least common successor, the ''join'' ''g''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;∨&nbsp;''g''<sub>2</sub>. Thus, the Tamari lattice has the structure of a [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]. The [[Hasse diagram]] of this lattice is [[Graph isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[skeleton (topology)|graph of vertices and edges]] of an [[associahedron]]. The number of elements in a Tamari lattice for a sequence of ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 objects is the ''n''th [[Catalan number]] C<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThe Tamari lattice can also be described in several other equivalent ways:\n*It is the poset of sequences of ''n'' integers ''a''<sub>1</sub>,&nbsp;...,&nbsp;''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ordered coordinatewise,  such that ''i''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''n''  and if ''i''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''<sub>''i''</sub> then ''a''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''a''<sub>''i''</sub> {{harv|Huang|Tamari|1972}}.\n*It is the poset of [[binary tree]]s with ''n'' leaves, ordered by [[tree rotation]] operations.\n*It is the poset of [[tree (graph theory)|ordered forests]], in which one forest is earlier than another in the partial order if, for every ''j'', the ''j''th node in a [[preorder]] traversal of the first forest has at least as many descendants as the ''j''th node in a preorder traversal of the second forest {{harv|Knuth|2005}}.\n*It is the poset of [[Triangulation (geometry)|triangulations]] of a convex ''n''-gon, ordered by flip operations that substitute one diagonal of the polygon for another.\n\n==Notation==\nThe Tamari lattice of the [[Catalan number|C<sub>''n''</sub>]] groupings of ''n''+1 objects is called T<sub>''n''</sub>, but the corresponding [[associahedron]] is called K<sub>''n''+1</sub>.\n\nIn ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' T<sub>4</sub> is called the ''Tamari lattice of order 4'' and its Hasse diagram K<sub>5</sub> the ''associahedron of order 4''.\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last = Chapoton | first = F.\n | year = 2005\n | mr = 2264942\n | journal = [[Séminaire Lotharingien de Combinatoire]]\n | title = Sur le nombre d'intervalles dans les treillis de Tamari\n | language = French\n | volume = 55\n | bibcode = 2006math......2368C\n | pages = 2368\n | arxiv = math/0602368\n | issue = 55}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Csar | first1 = Sebastian A.\n | last2 = Sengupta | first2 = Rik\n | last3 = Suksompong | first3 = Warut\n | mr = 3265974\n | issue = 3\n | journal = [[Order_(journal)|Order]]\n | pages = 337–363\n | title = On a Subposet of the Tamari Lattice \n | volume = 31\n | year = 2014\n | doi = 10.1007/s11083-013-9305-5| arxiv = 1108.5690}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Early | first = Edward\n | mr = 2061375\n | issue = 1\n | journal = Annals of Combinatorics\n | pages = 37–43\n | title = Chain lengths in the Tamari lattice\n | volume = 8\n | year = 2004\n | doi = 10.1007/s00026-004-0203-9}}.\n*{{citation\n | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9800(67)80024-3\n | last1 = Friedman | first1 = Haya | authorlink = Haya Freedman\n | last2 = Tamari | first2 = Dov | author2-link = Dov Tamari (mathematician)\n | language = French\n | mr = 0238984\n | journal = Journal of Combinatorial Theory\n | pages = 215–242\n | issue = 3\n | title = Problèmes d'associativité: Une structure de treillis finis induite par une loi demi-associative\n | volume = 2\n | year = 1967}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Geyer | first = Winfried\n | mr = 1298967\n | issue = 1–3\n | journal = [[Discrete Mathematics (journal)|Discrete Mathematics]] \n | pages = 99–122\n | title = On Tamari lattices\n | volume = 133\n | year = 1994\n | doi = 10.1016/0012-365X(94)90019-1}}.\n*{{citation\n | last1 = Huang | first1 = Samuel\n | last2 = Tamari | first2 = Dov | author2-link = Dov Tamari (mathematician)\n | mr = 0306064\n | journal = Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A\n | pages = 7–13\n | title = Problems of associativity: A simple proof for the lattice property of systems ordered by a semi-associative law\n | volume = 13\n | year = 1972\n | doi = 10.1016/0097-3165(72)90003-9}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Knuth | first = Donald E. | author-link = Donald Knuth\n | contribution = Draft of Section 7.2.1.6: Generating All Trees\n | title = [[The Art of Computer Programming]]\n | volume = IV\n | contribution-url = http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc4a.ps.gz\n | page = 34\n | year = 2005}}.\n*{{citation\n | last = Tamari | first = Dov | author-link = Dov Tamari (mathematician)\n | mr = 0146227\n | journal = Nieuw Archief voor Wiskunde, Ser. 3\n | pages = 131–146\n | title = The algebra of bracketings and their enumeration\n | volume = 10\n | year = 1962}}.\n\n[[Category:Lattice theory]]"

Euler's Tonnetz, pictured at left, shows the triadic relationships of the perfect fifth and the major third: at the top of the image is the note F, and to the left underneath is C (a perfect fifth above F), and to the right is A (a major third above F). The space was rediscovered in 1858 by Ernst Naumann, and was disseminated in an 1866 treatise of [[Arthur von Oettingen]]. Oettingen and the influential musicologist [[Hugo Riemann]] (not to be confused with the mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]) explored the capacity of the space to chart harmonic motion between chords and modulation between keys. Similar understandings of the ''Tonnetz'' appeared in the work of many late-19th century German music theorists.<ref name=\"cohnintro\">{{cite journal\n|last1=Cohn|first1=Richard\n|title=Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and a Historical Perspective\n|journal=Journal of Music Theory|year=1998|volume=42|issue=2 Autumn|pages=167–180|ref=harv|jstor=843871|doi=10.2307/843871\n}}</ref>\n\nOettingen and Riemann both conceived of the relationships in the chart being defined through [[just intonation]], which uses pure intervals. One can extend out one of the horizontal rows of the Tonnetz indefinitely, to form a never-ending sequence of perfect fifths: F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B#-Fx-Cx-Gx- (etc.) Starting with F, after 12 perfect fifths, one reaches E#. Perfect fifths in just intonation are slightly larger than the compromised fifths used in [[equal temperament]] tuning systems more common in the present. This means that when one stacks 12 fifths starting from F, the E# we arrive at will not be seven octaves above the F we started with. Oettingen and Riemann's ''Tonnetz'' thus extended on infinitely in every direction without actually repeating any pitches.\n\nThe appeal of the ''Tonnetz'' to 19th-century German theorists was that it allows spatial representations of tonal distance and tonal relationships. For example, looking at the dark blue A minor triad in the graphic at the beginning of the article, its parallel major triad (A-C#-E) is the triangle right below, sharing the vertices A and E. The relative major of A minor, C major (C-E-G) is the upper-right adjacent triangle, sharing the C and the E vertices. The dominant triad of A minor, E major (E-G#-B) is diagonally across the E vertex, and shares no other vertices. One important point is that every shared vertex between a pair of triangles is a shared pitch between chords - the more shared vertices, the more shared pitches the chord will have. This provides a visualization of the principle of parsimonious voice-leading, in which motions between chords are considered smoother when fewer pitches change. This principle is especially important in analyzing the music of late-19th century composers like Wagner, who frequently avoided traditional tonal relationships. <ref name=\"cohnintro\"></ref>\n\n==Twentieth-century reinterpretation==\n{{main|Neo-Riemannian theory}}\n[[Image:PLR on tonnetz.png|thumb|right|Neo-Riemannian music theory's PLR operations applied to a minor chord&nbsp;Q.]]\n\nRecent research by [[Neo-Riemannian theory|Neo-Riemannian]] music theorists [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, and others, have revived the ''Tonnetz'' to further explore properties of pitch structures. <ref name=\"cohnintro\"></ref> Modern music theorists generally construct the ''Tonnetz'' using [[equal temperament]],<ref name=\"cohnintro\"></ref> and using pitch-classes, which make no distinction between octave transpositions of a pitch. Under equal temperament, the never-ending series of ascending fifths mentioned earlier becomes a cycle. Neo-Riemannian theorists typically assume enharmonic equivalence (in other words, Ab&nbsp;=&nbsp;G#), and so the two-dimensional plane of the 19th-century ''Tonnetz'' cycles in on itself in two different directions, and is mathematically [[isomorphic]] to a [[torus]]. Theorists have studied the structure of this new cyclical version using mathematical [[group theory]]{{citation needed|reason=Which theorists?|date=March 2016}}.\n\nNeo-Riemannian theorists have also used the ''Tonnetz'' to visualize non-tonal triadic relationships. For example, the diagonal going up and to the left from C in the diagram at the beginning of the article forms a division of the octave in three [[major third]]s: C-Ab-E-C (the E is actually an Fb, and the final C a Dbb). Richard Cohn argues that while a sequence of triads built on these three pitches (C major, Ab major, and E major) cannot be adequately described using traditional concepts of functional harmony, this cycle has smooth voice leading and other important group properties which can be easily observed on the ''Tonnetz''. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Richard|title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions|journal=Music Analysis|date=March 1996|volume=15|issue=1|pages=9–40|doi=10.2307/854168|jstor=854168}}</ref>\n\n==Similarities to other graphical systems==\nThe [[harmonic table note layout]] is a recently{{when|date=May 2012}} developed musical interface that uses a note layout topologically equivalent to the Tonnetz.\n\nA ''Tonnetz'' of the [[syntonic temperament]] can be derived from a given [[isomorphic keyboard]] by connecting lines of successive [[perfect fifth]]s, lines of successive [[major third]]s, and lines of successive [[minor third]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Milne|first1=A.|last2=Sethares|first2=W.

      "text": "{{unsolved|mathematics|If any two sets in some finite family of sets have a union that also belongs to the family, must some element belong to at least half of the sets in the family?}}\nIn [[combinatorial mathematics]], the '''union-closed sets conjecture''' is an elementary problem, posed by [[Péter Frankl]] in 1979 and still open. A [[family of sets]] is said to be ''union-closed'' if the union of any two sets from the family remains in the family. The conjecture states: <blockquote> For every finite union-closed family of finite sets, other than the family containing only the [[empty set]], there exists an element that belongs to at least half of the sets in the family.</blockquote>\n\n==Equivalent forms==\nIf ''F'' is a union-closed family of sets, the family of [[complement set]]s to sets in ''F'' is closed under intersection, and an element that belongs to at least half of the sets of ''F'' belongs to at most half of the complement sets. Thus, an equivalent form of the conjecture (the form in which it was originally stated) is that, for any intersection-closed family of sets that contains more than one set, there exists an element that belongs to at most half of the sets in the family.\n\nAlthough stated above in terms of families of sets, Frankl's conjecture has also been formulated and studied as a question in [[lattice theory]]. A [[lattice (order)|lattice]] is a [[partially ordered set]] in which for two elements ''x'' and ''y'' there is a unique greatest element less than or equal to both of them (the ''meet'' of ''x'' and ''y'') and a unique least element greater than or equal to both of them (the ''join'' of ''x'' and ''y''). The family of all subsets of a set ''S'', ordered by set inclusion, forms a lattice in which the meet is represented by the set-theoretic intersection and the join is represented by the set-theoretic union; a lattice formed in this way is called a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean lattice]].\nThe lattice-theoretic version of Frankl's conjecture is that in any finite [[lattice (order)|lattice]] there exists an element ''x'' that is not the join of any two smaller elements, and such that the number of elements greater than or equal to ''x'' totals at most half the lattice, with equality only if the lattice is a Boolean lattice. As {{harvtxt|Abe|2000}} shows, this statement about lattices is equivalent to the Frankl conjecture for union-closed sets: each lattice can be translated into a union-closed set family, and each union-closed set family can be translated into a lattice, such that the truth of the Frankl conjecture for the translated object implies the truth of the conjecture for the original object. This lattice-theoretic version of the conjecture is known to be true for several natural subclasses of lattices<ref>{{harvtxt|Abe|2000}}; {{harvtxt|Poonen|1992}}; {{harvtxt|Reinhold|2000}}</ref> but remains open in the general case.\n\nAnother equivalent formulation of the union-closed sets conjecture uses [[graph theory]]. In an [[undirected graph]], an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] is a set of vertices no two of which are adjacent to each other; an independent set is [[maximal independent set|maximal]] if it is not a subset of a larger independent set. In any graph, the \"heavy\" vertices that appear in more than half of the maximal independent sets must themselves form an independent set, so there always exists at least one non-heavy vertex, a vertex that appears in at most half of the maximal independent sets. The graph formulation of the union-closed sets conjecture states that every finite non-empty graph contains two adjacent non-heavy vertices. It is automatically true when the graph contains an odd cycle, because the independent set of all heavy vertices cannot cover all the edges of the cycle. Therefore, the more interesting case of the conjecture is for [[bipartite graph]]s, which have no odd cycles. Another equivalent formulation of the conjecture is that, in every bipartite graph, there exist two vertices, one on each side of the bipartition, such that each of these two vertices belongs to at most half of the graph's maximal independent sets. This conjecture is known to hold for [[chordal bipartite graph]]s, bipartite [[series-parallel graph]]s, and bipartite graphs of maximum [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] three.{{sfnp|Bruhn|Charbit|Schaudt|Telle|2015}}\n\n==Families known to satisfy the conjecture==\nThe conjecture has been proven for many special cases of union-closed set families. In particular, it is known to be true for\n* families of at most 46 sets.{{sfnp|Roberts|Simpson|2010}}\n* families of sets whose union has at most 11 elements.<ref>{{harvtxt|Bošnjak|Marković|2008}}, improving previous bounds by {{harvtxt|Morris|2006}}, {{harvtxt|Lo Faro|1994}} and others.</ref>\n* families of sets in which the smallest set has one or two elements.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sarvate|Renaud|1989}}, since rediscovered by several other authors. If a one-element or two-element set ''S'' exists, some element of ''S'' belongs to at least half the sets in the family, but the same property does not hold for three-element sets, due to counterexamples of Sarvate, Renaud, and [[Ronald Graham]].</ref>\n* families of at least <math>(\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\varepsilon)2^n</math> subsets of an <math>n</math>-element set, for some constant <math>\\varepsilon>0</math>.{{sfnp|Karpas|2017}}\n\n==History==\n[[Péter Frankl]] stated the conjecture, in terms of intersection-closed set families, in 1979, and so the conjecture is usually credited to him and sometimes called the '''Frankl conjecture'''.

He went to college at the [[California Institute of Technology]], receiving his baccalaureate in 1936 and continuing there for his graduate studies. Dilworth's graduate advisor was [[Morgan Ward]], a student of [[Eric Temple Bell]], who was also on the Caltech faculty at the time. On receiving his Ph.D. in 1939, Dilworth took an instructorship at [[Yale University]]. While at Yale, he met and married his wife, Miriam White, with whom he eventually had two sons. He returned to Caltech as a faculty member in 1943, and spent the remainder of his academic career there. \nDilworth advised 17 Ph.D. students and {{As of|2010|lc=on}} has 373 academic descendants listed at the [[Mathematics Genealogy Project]], many through his student [[Juris Hartmanis]], a noted [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theorist]]. Other notable mathematicians advised by Dilworth include [[Curtis Greene]] and [[Alfred W. Hales]].\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n*{{citation\n | editor1-last = Bogart | editor1-first = Kenneth P.\n | editor2-last = Freese | editor2-first = Ralph\n | editor3-last = Kung | editor3-first = Joseph P.

In 1924, the University of Oslo awarded him the Ph.D. for a thesis titled ''Zur Theorie der algebraischen Körper'', supervised by [[Thoralf Skolem]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=11890|website=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=9 April 2018|title= Øystein Ore}}</ref>. Ore also studied at [[Göttingen University]], where he learned [[Emmy Noether]]'s new approach to [[abstract algebra]]. He was also a fellow at the [[Mittag-Leffler]] Institute in [[Sweden]], and spent some time at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1925, he was appointed research assistant at the University of Oslo.\n\n[[Yale University]]’s [[James Pierpont (mathematician)|James Pierpont]] went to Europe in 1926 to recruit research mathematicians. In 1927, Yale hired Ore as an assistant professor of mathematics, promoted him to associate professor in 1928, then to full professor in 1929. In 1931, he became a [[Sterling Professor]] (Yale's highest academic rank), a position he held until he retired in 1968.\n\nOre gave an [[American Mathematical Society]] Colloquium lecture in 1941 and was a [[list of International Congresses of Mathematicians Plenary and Invited Speakers|plenary speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1936 in Oslo. He was also elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Oslo Academy of Science]]. He was a founder of the [[Econometric Society]].\n\nOre visited Norway nearly every summer. During [[World War II]], he was active in the \"American Relief for Norway\" and \"Free Norway\" movements. In gratitude for the services rendered to his native country during the war, he was decorated in 1947 with the [[Order of St. Olav]].\n\nIn 1930, Ore married Gudrun Lundevall. They had two children. Ore had a passion for painting and sculpture, collected ancient maps, and spoke several languages.\n\n==Work==\nOre is known for his work in [[ring theory]], [[Galois connections]], and most of all, [[graph theory]].\n\nHis early work was on [[algebraic number field]]s, how to decompose the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by a [[prime number]] into [[prime ideal]]s. He then worked on [[noncommutative ring]]s, proving his celebrated theorem on embedding a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]] into a [[division ring]]. He then examined [[polynomial ring]]s over [[skew field]]s, and attempted to extend his work on factorisation to non-commutative rings. The [[Ore condition]], which (if true) allows a ring of fractions to be defined, and the [[Ore extension]], a non-commutative analogue of rings of polynomials, are part of this work. In more elementary number theory, [[Ore's harmonic number]]s are the numbers whose divisors have an integer harmonic mean. \n\nAs a teacher, Ore is notable for teaching mathematics to two doctoral students who would make  contributions to science and mathematics, [[Grace Hopper]], who would eventually become a [[United States]] [[rear admiral]] and [[computer scientist]], who was a pioneer in the development of the first [[computer]]s, and [[Marshall Hall, Jr.]], an American mathematician who did important research in [[group theory]] and [[combinatorics]].\n\nIn 1930 the ''Collected Works of Richard Dedekind'' were published in three volumes, jointly edited by Ore and [[Emmy Noether]]. He then turned his attention to [[lattice theory]] becoming, together with [[Garrett Birkhoff]], one of the two founders of American expertise in the subject. Ore's early work on lattice theory led him to the study of [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] and [[Closure operator|closure relation]]s, [[Galois connection]]s, and finally to [[graph theory]], which occupied him to the end of his life. He wrote two books on the subject, one on the theory of graphs and another on their applications. Within graph theory, Ore's theorem is one of several results proving that sufficiently [[dense graph]]s contain [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s.\n\nOre had a lively interest in the [[history of mathematics]], and was an unusually able author of books for laypeople, such as his biographies of [[Cardano]] and [[Niels Henrik Abel]].\n\n==Books by Ore==\n* ''Les Corps Algébriques et la Théorie des Idéaux'' (1934)\n* ''L'Algèbre Abstraite'' (1936)\n* ''[https://archive.org/stream/NumberTheoryItsHistory/Ore-NumberTheoryItsHistory#page/n3/mode/2up Number Theory and its History]'' (1948)\n* ''Cardano, the Gambling Scholar'' (Princeton University Press, 1953)\n* ''Niels Henrik Abel, Mathematician Extraordinary'' (U. of Minnesota Press, 1957)\n* ''Theory of Graphs'' (1962)\n* ''Graphs and Their Uses'' (1963)\n* ''The Four-Color Problem'' (1967)\n* ''Invitation to Number Theory'' (1969)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Ore}}.

He was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for thirty years. Today he is appreciated largely for his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, [[scientific method]]ology, [[semiotics]], and for his founding of [[pragmatism]].\n\nAn innovator in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research [[methodology]], and various sciences, Peirce considered himself, first and foremost, a [[logic]]ian. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed much of that which is now called [[epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. He saw logic as the formal branch of [[semiotics]], of which he is a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among [[logical positivists]] and proponents of [[philosophy of language]] that dominated 20th century Western philosophy. Additionally, he defined the concept of [[abductive reasoning]], as well as rigorously formulated [[mathematical induction]] and [[deductive reasoning]]. As early as 1886 he saw that [[logic gate|logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits]].

Peirce'' (1976), edited by mathematician [[Carolyn Eisele]].\n\n;Nature of mathematics\n\nPeirce agreed with [[Auguste Comte]] in regarding mathematics as more basic than philosophy and the special sciences (of nature and mind). Peirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|classified]] mathematics into three subareas: (1) mathematics of logic, (2) discrete series, and (3) pseudo-continua (as he called them, including the [[real numbers]]) and continua. Influenced by his father [[Benjamin Peirce|Benjamin]], Peirce argued that mathematics studies purely hypothetical objects and is not just the science of quantity but is more broadly the science which draws necessary conclusions; that mathematics aids logic, not vice versa; and that logic itself is part of philosophy and is the science ''about'' drawing conclusions necessary and otherwise.<ref>Peirce (1898), \"The Logic of Mathematics in Relation to Education\" in ''Educational Review'' v. 15, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/educationalrevie15newyuoft#page/209/mode/1up 209–16] (via ''Internet Archive'').

In computer science, the [[relational model]] for [[database]]s was developed with Peircean ideas in work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who was a doctoral student<ref>Avery, John (2003) ''Information theory and evolution'', p. 167; also Mitchell, Melanie, \"[http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mm/MMScientificAncestry.html My Scientific Ancestry]\".</ref> of [[Arthur W.

Putnam found that mathematicians and logicians learned about the logic of quantifiers through the independent work of Peirce and Mitchell, particularly through Peirce's \"On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation\"<ref name=CSP1885/> (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day, and cited by [[Peano]] and Schröder, among others, who ignored Frege. They also adopted and modified Peirce's notations, typographical variants of those now used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their overlapping achievements in logic, [[philosophy of language]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].\n\nPeirce's work on formal logic had admirers besides [[Ernst Schröder]]:\n* Philosophical algebraist [[William Kingdon Clifford]]<ref>Beil, Ralph G. and Ketner, Kenneth (2003), \"Peirce, Clifford, and Quantum Theory\", ''International Journal of Theoretical Physics'' v. 42, n. 9, pp. 1957–72.</ref> and logician [[William Ernest Johnson]], both British;\n* The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including [[Alfred Tarski]];\n* [[Arthur Prior]], who praised and studied Peirce's logical work in a 1964 paper<ref name=SP2/> and in ''Formal Logic'' (saying on page 4 that Peirce \"perhaps had a keener eye for essentials than any other logician before or since\").\n\nA philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings and, along with Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in Hilary Putnam (1982);<ref name=Putnam /> the Introduction in Nathan Houser ''et al.''

Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].<ref>Peirce condemned the use of \"certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]\" (''The Essential Peirce'', 2:108–09) even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used a bit of [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology (''Writings of Charles S.

(See [[Stephen Stigler]]'s historical books and [[Ian Hacking]] 1990<ref name=Hacking/>).\n\n==Philosophy==\n{{quote|It is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce's career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircean studies.|Max Fisch 1964, p. 486.<ref name=SP2/>}}\n\nPeirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[mathematics]], [[logic]], philosophy, statistics, [[astronomy]],<ref name=SP2/> [[metrology]],<ref name=metr/> [[geodesy]], [[experimental psychology]],<ref name=psych/> economics,<ref name=econom/> [[linguistics]],<ref name=ling/> and the [[history and philosophy of science]]. This work has enjoyed renewed interest and approval, a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.\n\nPeirce's philosophy includes (see below in related sections) a pervasive three-category system, belief that truth is immutable and is both independent from actual opinion ([[fallibilism]]) and discoverable (no radical skepticism), logic as formal semiotic on signs, on arguments, and on inquiry's ways—including philosophical [[pragmatism]] (which he founded), [[#Critical common-sensism|critical common-sensism]], and [[scientific method]]—and, in metaphysics: [[Philosophical realism|Scholastic realism]], e.g. [[John Duns Scotus]], belief in God, freedom, and at least an attenuated immortality, [[objective idealism]], and belief in the reality of continuity and of absolute chance, mechanical necessity, and creative love.  In his work, fallibilism and pragmatism may seem to work somewhat like [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in others' work.  However, for Peirce, fallibilism is balanced by an [[Pragmatism#antiskep|anti-skepticism]] and is a basis for belief in the reality of absolute chance and of continuity,<ref name=FCE>Peirce (1897) \"Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution\", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.141–75 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), placed by the ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', editors directly after \"F.R.L.\" (1899, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.135–40).</ref> and pragmatism commits one to anti-[[nominalist]] belief in the reality of the general (CP 5.453–57).\n\nFor Peirce, First Philosophy, which he also called cenoscopy, is less basic than mathematics and more basic than the special sciences (of nature and mind). It studies positive phenomena in general, phenomena available to any person at any waking moment, and does not settle questions by resorting to special experiences.<ref name=phil>Peirce (1903), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.180–202 and (1906) \"The Basis of Pragmaticism\", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:372–73, see \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] such philosophy into (1) phenomenology (which he also called phaneroscopy or categorics), (2) normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.\n\n===Theory of categories===\n{{Main|Categories (Peirce)}}\n\nOn May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled \"On a New List of Categories\" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce developed in response to reading [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[G. W. F. Hegel]], categories that Peirce applied throughout his work for the rest of his life.<ref name=Burch/> Peirce scholars generally regard the \"New List\" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's \"architectonic\", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern that one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How To Make Our Ideas Clear]]\" (1878 paper foundational to pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.\n\n\"On a New List of Categories\" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.<ref>See in \"Firstness\", \"Secondness\", and \"Thirdness\" in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S.

He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] logic into: (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology, on how signs can be meaningful and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative or [[universal rhetoric]], or methodeutic,<ref name=rhetoric/> the philosophical theory of inquiry, including pragmatism.\n\n====Presuppositions of logic====\nIn his \"F.R.L.\" [First Rule of Logic] (1899), Peirce states that the first, and \"in one sense, the sole\", rule of reason is that, ''to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.<ref name=\"FRL\"/> So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in research practices and the shaping of theories:\n:...there follows one [[corollary]] which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:\n<center>Do not block the way of inquiry.</center>\nPeirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that \"the one unpardonable offence\" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which \"metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted\". Peirce in many writings holds that [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|logic precedes metaphysics]] (ontological, religious, and physical).\n\nPeirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute theoretical certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and [[synechism]]).<ref name=FCE/>\n\nThe First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that truth and the real do not depend on yours or my opinion of them but do depend on representational relation and consist in the destined end in investigation taken far enough ([[#defs|see below]]).

All knowledge of the internal world comes by hypothetical reasoning from known external facts.\n# No power of Intuition (cognition without logical determination by previous cognitions). No cognitive stage is absolutely first in a process. All mental action has the form of inference.\n# No power of thinking without signs. A cognition must be interpreted in a subsequent cognition in order to be a cognition at all.\n# No conception of the absolutely incognizable.\n(The above sense of the term \"intuition\" is almost Kant's, said Peirce. It differs from the current looser sense that encompasses instinctive or anyway half-conscious inference.)\n\nPeirce argued that those incapacities imply the reality of the general and of the continuous, the validity of the modes of reasoning,<ref name=GVLL/> and the falsity of philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]] ([[#Against Cartesianism|see below]]).\n\nPeirce rejected the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself<ref name=SCFI /> and later said that to \"dismiss make-believes\" is a prerequisite for pragmatism.<ref>Peirce (1905), \"What Pragmatism Is\", ''The Monist'', v.

''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/whatis/whatpragis.htm Eprint].</ref>\n\n====Logic as formal semiotic====\nPeirce sought, through his wide-ranging studies through the decades, formal philosophical ways to articulate thought's processes, and also to explain the workings of science. These inextricably entangled questions of a dynamics of inquiry rooted in nature and nurture led him to develop his semiotic with very broadened conceptions of signs and inference, and, as its culmination, a theory of inquiry for the task of saying 'how science works' and devising research methods. This would be logic by the medieval definition taught for centuries: art of arts, science of sciences, having the way to the principles of all methods.<ref name=ars/> Influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, in such ''loci'' as: the basic terminology of [[psychology]] in ''[[On the Soul]]''; the founding description of [[sign relation]]s in ''[[On Interpretation]]''; and the differentiation of [[inference]] into three modes that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'', as well as inference by [[analogy]] (called ''paradeigma'' by Aristotle), which Peirce regarded as involving the other three modes.\n\nPeirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time when he devised his system of three categories. He called it both ''[[semiotic]]'' and ''semeiotic''. Both are current in singular and plural. He based it on the conception of a triadic [[sign relation]], and defined ''[[semiosis]]'' as \"action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs\".<ref>Peirce 1907, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.484. Reprinted, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:411 in \"Pragmatism\" (398–433).</ref> As to signs in thought, Peirce emphasized the reverse: \"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.\"<ref name=QFM/>\n\nPeirce held that all thought is in signs, issuing in and from interpretation, where ''sign'' is the word for the broadest variety of conceivable semblances, diagrams, metaphors, symptoms, signals, designations, symbols, texts, even mental concepts and ideas, all as determinations of a mind or ''quasi-mind'', that which at least functions like a mind, as in the work of crystals or bees<ref>See \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-mind]\" in ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref>—the focus is on sign action in general rather than on psychology, linguistics, or social studies (fields which he also pursued).\n\nInquiry is a kind of inference process, a manner of thinking and semiosis. Global divisions of ways for phenomena to stand as signs, and the subsumption of inquiry and thinking within inference as a sign process, enable the study of inquiry on semiotics' three levels:\n\n# Conditions for meaningfulness. Study of significatory elements and combinations, their grammar.\n# Validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various separate modes.\n# Conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.\n\nPeirce uses examples often from common experience, but defines and discusses such things as assertion and interpretation in terms of philosophical logic. In a formal vein, Peirce said:\n\n{{quote|''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word \"formal\" in the definition is also defined.<ref>Peirce, \"Carnegie Application\", ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, p. 54.</ref>}}\n\n===Signs===\n{{Main|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce}} {{See also|Representation (arts)#Peirce and representation|Sign (semiotics)#Triadic signs}}\n:''A list of noted writings by Peirce on signs and sign relations is at [[Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce#References and further reading|Semiotic theory of Charles Sanders Peirce § References and further reading]].''\n\n====Sign relation====\nPeirce's theory of signs is known to be one of the most complex semiotic theories due to its generalistic claim. Anything is a sign—not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not. The roles are but three; a sign of an object leads to one or more interpretants, and, as signs, they lead to further interpretants.\n\n''Extension × intension = information.'' Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.<ref>Peirce (1867), \"Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension\" (CP 2.391–426), ([http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'', 2:70–86]).</ref> For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies.\n\n''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object—the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object—an object determines a sign to determine an interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing the object. The object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience<ref name=collateral>See pp. 404–09 in \"Pragmatism\" in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2. Ten quotes on collateral experience from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive.

Peirce used the word \"determine\" not in a strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of \"specializes\", ''bestimmt'',<ref name=determined>Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492.</ref> involving variable amount, like an influence.<ref name=Marty>See \"[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/76defeng.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]\", collected by Robert Marty (U. of Perpignan, France).</ref> Peirce came to define representation and interpretation in terms of (triadic) determination.<ref>Peirce, A Letter to Lady Welby (1908), ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', pp. 80–81: {{quote|I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of \"upon a person\" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.}}</ref> The object determines the sign to determine another sign—the interpretant—to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.<ref name=Marty/>\n\n====Semiotic elements====\nPeirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):\n# A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'')<ref>''Representamen'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɛ|p|r|ɪ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ə|n}} {{respell|REP|ri|zen|TAY|mən}}) was adopted ([[wikt:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory, in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word \"sign\". He eventually stopped using \"representamen\". See ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:272–73 and ''[[#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'' p. 193, quotes in \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> represents, in the broadest possible sense of \"represents\". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial—a cloud might be a sign of rain for instance, or ruins the sign of ancient civilization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Eco|first=Umberto|title=Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language|year=1984|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington & Indianapolis|isbn=978-0253203984|page=15}}</ref> As Peirce sometimes put it (he defined ''sign'' at least 76 times<ref name=Marty/>), the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant. A sign represents its object in some respect, which respect is the sign's ''ground''.<ref name=ground/>\n# An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as [[Prince Hamlet]].<ref name=fictive>Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:492–502. Fictional object, 498. Object as universe of discourse, 492. See \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.<ref name=fictive/> For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded \"as on bedrock\".<ref>See \"Immediate Object\", etc., at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].</ref>\n# An ''[[interpretant]]'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is a sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect, an interpretation, human or otherwise. An interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's \"predecessor\" (the interpreted sign) as a sign of the same object. An interpretant either (i) is ''immediate'' to a sign and is a kind of quality or possibility such as a word's usual meaning, or (ii) is a ''dynamic'' interpretant, such as a state of agitation, or (iii) is a ''final'' or ''normal'' interpretant, a sum of the lessons which a sufficiently considered sign ''would'' have as effects on practice, and with which an actual interpretant may at most coincide.\nSome of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. To know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object, experience outside of, and collateral to, that sign or sign system. In that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.<ref name=collateral/>\n\n====Classes of signs====\nAmong Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. The first typology depends on the sign itself, the second on how the sign stands for its denoted object, and the third on how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Also, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]: (1) quality of feeling, (2) reaction, resistance, and (3) representation, mediation.<ref name=9signs/>\n\nI. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''):<ref name=terms>On the varying terminology, look up in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''].</ref> This typology classifies every sign according to the sign's own phenomenological category—the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a \"First\"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a \"Second\"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a \"Third\".\n\nII. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, classifies every sign according to the category of the sign's way of denoting its object—the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by factual connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.\n\nIII. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,''<ref name=terms/> and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology classifies every sign according to the category which the interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting its object—the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.\n{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}}\nEvery sign belongs to one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications are absent, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.\n\n===Modes of inference===\n{{Main|Inquiry}}\nBorrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of [[inference]]—''[[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|induction]]''—in his \"critique of arguments\" or \"logic proper\". Peirce also called abduction \"retroduction\", \"presumption\", and, earliest of all, \"hypothesis\". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to an explanatory hypothesis. He sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the categorical [[Syllogism#Barbara (AAA-1)|syllogism Barbara (AAA)]], for example in \"Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis\" (1878).<ref>''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 13, pp. 470–82, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=u8sWAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA472 472] or [[s:Popular Science Monthly/Volume 13/August 1878/Illustrations of the Logic of Science VI|the book at Wikisource]]. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.619–44 [623]</ref> He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (Barbara's major premise), the ''case'' (Barbara's minor premise), and the ''result'' (Barbara's conclusion):\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\nDeduction.\n\n''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n''Case:'' These beans are beans from this bag. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Result:'' These beans are white.\n{{col-break|gap=1%}}\nInduction.\n\n''Case:'' These beans are &#91;randomly selected&#93; from this bag. <br>\n''Result:'' These beans are white. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.\n{{col-break|gap=1%}}\nHypothesis (Abduction).\n\n''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>\n''Result:'' These beans [oddly] are white. <br>\n<math>\\therefore</math> ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.\n{{col-end}}\n\nPeirce 1883 in \"A Theory of Probable Inference\" (''[[#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') equated hypothetical inference with the induction of characters of objects (as he had done in effect before<ref name=SCFI/>). Eventually dissatisfied, by 1900 he distinguished them once and for all and also wrote that he now took the syllogistic forms and the doctrine of logical extension and comprehension as being less basic than he had thought. In 1903 he presented the following logical form for abductive inference:<ref>See, under \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce'', the following quotes:\n* On correction of \"A Theory of Probable Inference\", see quotes from \"Minute Logic\", ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, ''Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science'' v. 2, pp. 1031–32.\n* On new logical form for abduction, see quote from Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism, 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.188–89.\nSee also Santaella, Lucia (1997) \"The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction\", 6th Congress of the [[IASS]].

Induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis; abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts. \"Deduction proves that something ''must'' be; Induction shows that something ''actually is'' operative; Abduction merely suggests that something ''may be''.\"<ref>\"Lectures on Pragmatism\", 1903, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.171.</ref> Peirce did not remain quite convinced that one logical form covers all abduction.<ref>A Letter to J. H. Kehler (dated 1911), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 3, pp. 203–04, see in \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/retroduction.html Retroduction]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S. Peirce''.</ref> In his [[methodeutic]] or theory of inquiry (see below), he portrayed abduction as an economic initiative to further inference and study, and portrayed all three modes as clarified by their coordination in essential roles in inquiry: hypothetical explanation, deductive prediction, inductive testing.\n\n===Pragmatism===\n{{Main|Pragmaticism|Pragmatic maxim|Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce}}\n<div class=infobox style=\"padding:5px;font-size:94%;width:auto\">Some noted articles and lectures\n* [[s:Author:Charles Sanders Peirce#Articles in The Popular Science Monthly Project|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]] (1877–1878): <br>inquiry, pragmatism, statistics, inference\n# The Fixation of Belief (1877)\n# How to Make Our Ideas Clear (1878)\n# The Doctrine of Chances (1878)\n# The Probability of Induction (1878)\n# The Order of Nature (1878)\n# Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis (1878)\n* The Harvard lectures on pragmatism (1903)\n* What Pragmatism Is (1905)\n* Issues of Pragmaticism (1905)\n* Pragmatism (1907 MS in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2)</div> Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, which he called ''[[pragmatism]]'' and, later, ''[[pragmaticism]]'', is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called ''[[pragmatic maxim]]''. Here is one of his more [[Pragmatic maxim#2|emphatic reiterations]] of it:\n\n{{quote|Consider what effects that might ''conceivably'' have practical bearings you ''conceive'' the objects of your ''conception'' to have. Then, your ''conception'' of those effects is the whole of your ''conception'' of the object.}}\n\nAs a movement, pragmatism began in the early 1870s in discussions among Peirce, [[William James]], and others in [[the Metaphysical Club]]. James among others regarded some articles by Peirce such as \"[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]\" (1877) and especially \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]\" (1878) as foundational to [[pragmatism]].<ref>James, William (1897), ''The Will to Believe'', see p. 124.</ref> Peirce (CP 5.11–12), like James (''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', 1907), saw pragmatism as embodying familiar attitudes, in philosophy and elsewhere, elaborated into a new deliberate method for fruitful thinking about problems. Peirce differed from James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.\n\nIn 1905 Peirce coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] \"for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition\", saying that \"all went happily\" with James's and [[F.C.S. Schiller]]'s variant uses of the old name \"pragmatism\" and that he coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in \"literary journals, where it gets abused\". Yet he cited as causes, in a 1906 manuscript, his differences with James and Schiller and, in a 1908 publication, his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.<ref>See [[Pragmaticism#Pragmaticism's name]] for discussion and references.</ref>\n\nPragmatism begins with the idea that belief is that on which one is prepared to act. Peirce's pragmatism is a method of clarification of conceptions of objects. It equates any conception of an object to a conception of that object's effects to a general extent of the effects' conceivable implications for informed practice. It is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions occasioned, for example, by distinctions that make (sometimes needed) formal yet not practical differences. He formulated both pragmatism and statistical principles as aspects of scientific logic, in his \"Illustrations of the Logic of Science\" series of articles. In the second one, \"[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]\", Peirce discussed three grades of clearness of conception:\n# Clearness of a conception familiar and readily used, even if unanalyzed and undeveloped.\n# Clearness of a conception in virtue of clearness of its parts, in virtue of which logicians called an idea \"distinct\", that is, clarified by analysis of just what makes it applicable. Elsewhere, echoing Kant, Peirce called a likewise distinct definition \"nominal\" (CP 5.553).\n# Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable practical implications of the object's conceived effects, such as fosters fruitful reasoning, especially on difficult problems. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]].\n\nBy way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addressed conceptions about truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade (the \"nominal\" grade), he defined truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any actual, definite [[Community of inquiry|community of inquirers]] think. After that needful but confined step, next in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic, practice-oriented grade) he defined truth as that opinion which ''would'' be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research taken far enough, such that the real does depend on that ideal final opinion—a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-run validity of the rule of induction.<ref name=Induction>\"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\", in Peirce (1878 April), \"The Probability of Induction\", p.

Peirce'', 3:290–305, ''The Essential Peirce'', 1:155–69, elsewhere.</ref> Peirce argued that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability.\n\nPeirce said that a conception's meaning consists in \"[[Pragmatic maxim#2|all general modes of rational conduct]]\" implied by \"acceptance\" of the conception—that is, if one were to accept, first of all, the conception as true, then what could one conceive to be consequent general modes of rational conduct by all who accept the conception as true?—the whole of such consequent general modes is the whole meaning. His pragmatism does not equate a conception's meaning, its intellectual purport, with the conceived benefit or cost of the conception itself, like a meme (or, say, propaganda), outside the perspective of its being true, nor, since a conception is general, is its meaning equated with any definite set of actual consequences or upshots corroborating or undermining the conception or its worth. His pragmatism also bears no resemblance to \"vulgar\" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage.

Also important: ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 5.497–525.</ref> treated by Peirce as a consequence of his pragmatism, is his combination of [[Scottish School of Common Sense|Thomas Reid's common-sense philosophy]] with a [[fallibilism]] that recognizes that propositions of our more or less vague common sense now indubitable may later come into question, for example because of transformations of our world through science. It includes efforts to work up in tests genuine doubts for a core group of common indubitables that vary slowly if at all.\n\n=====Rival methods of inquiry=====\nIn \"[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]\" (1877), Peirce described inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubt born of surprise, disagreement, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. That let Peirce frame scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal, quarrelsome, or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless. Peirce sketched '''four methods''' of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:\n# The method of '''tenacity''' (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. The method goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion seems as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can be brilliant but tend to be transitory.\n# The method of '''authority''' – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lasting, but it cannot regulate people thoroughly enough to withstand doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn about other societies present and past.\n# The method of the '''''a priori''''' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of \"what is agreeable to reason\". Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.\n# The method of '''science''' – wherein inquiry supposes that the real is discoverable but independent of particular opinion, such that, unlike in the other methods, inquiry can, by its own account, go wrong ([[fallibilism]]), not only right, and thus purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.\n\nPeirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,<ref>Peirce, \"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life\", Lecture 1 of the 1898 Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 1.616–48 in part and ''[[#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]'', 105–22, reprinted in ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:27–41.</ref> which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's \"first rule\"<ref name=FRL/> is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry. [[Scientific method]] excels over the others finally by being deliberately designed to arrive—eventually—at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential conduct correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.\n\n=====Scientific method=====\nInsofar as clarification by pragmatic reflection suits explanatory hypotheses and fosters predictions and testing, pragmatism points beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives: [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]''; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.\n\nBased on his critique of three [[#Modes of inference|modes of argument]] and different from either [[foundationalism]] or [[coherentism]], Peirce's approach seeks to justify claims by a three-phase dynamic of inquiry:\n\n# Active, [[Abductive reasoning|abductive]] genesis of theory, with no prior assurance of truth;\n# Deductive application of the contingent theory so as to clarify its practical implications;\n# Inductive testing and evaluation of the utility of the provisional theory in anticipation of future experience, in both senses: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''.\n\nThereby, Peirce devised an approach to inquiry far more solid than the flatter image of inductive generalization ''simpliciter'', which is a mere re-labeling of phenomenological patterns. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.\n\nA theory that succeeds better than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth used by scientists.\n\nPeirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of inquiry from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.\n\nAbduction, deduction, and induction make incomplete sense in isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way of thinking about conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, in the struggle to move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components.\n\nPeirce's outline of the scientific method in §III–IV of \"A Neglected Argument\"<ref name=NA>Peirce (1908), \"[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]\", published in large part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90–112. Reprinted with an unpublished part, ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 6.452–85, ''Selected Writings'' pp. 358–79, ''The Essential Peirce'', 2:434–50, ''Peirce on Signs'' 260–78.</ref> is summarized below (except as otherwise noted). There he also reviewed plausibility and inductive precision (issues of [[#Modes of inference|critique of arguments]]).\n\n1. '''Abductive''' (or retroductive) phase. Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicated phenomenon. The modicum of success in our guesses far exceeds that of random luck, and seems born of attunement to nature by developed or inherent instincts, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense of the \"facile and natural\", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from \"logical simplicity\".<ref>See also Nubiola, Jaime (2004), \"[http://www.unav.es/users/LumeNaturale.html Il Lume Naturale: Abduction and God]\", ''Semiotiche'' I/2, 91–102.</ref> Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and it has no substitute in expediting us toward new truths.<ref>Peirce (c. 1906), \"PAP (Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmatism)\" (MS 293), ''[[#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'' v. 4, pp. 319–20, first quote under \"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]\" at ''Commens Digital Companion to C.S.

Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}</ref> The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if not costly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be selected for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, or incomplexity.<ref>Peirce, C. S., \"On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents\", ''The Essential Peirce'', 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, see 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}</ref> One can discover only that which would be revealed through their sufficient experience anyway, and so the point is to expedite it; economy of research demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.<ref name=econ/>\n\n2. '''Deductive''' phase. Two stages:\n:i. Explication. Not clearly premised, but a deductive analysis of the hypothesis so as to render its parts as clear as possible.\n:ii. Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of consequences of the hypothesis as predictions about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, Theorematic.\n\n3. '''Inductive''' phase. Evaluation of the hypothesis, inferring from observational or experimental tests of its deduced consequences. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real \"is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead\";<ref name=Induction/> in other words, anything excluding such a process would never be real. Induction involving the ongoing accumulation of evidence follows \"a method which, sufficiently persisted in\", will \"diminish the error below any predesignate degree\". Three stages:\n:i. Classification. Not clearly premised, but an inductive classing of objects of experience under general ideas.\n:ii. Probation: direct Inductive Argumentation. Crude or Gradual in procedure. Crude Induction, founded on experience in one mass (CP 2.759), presumes that future experience on a question will not differ utterly from all past experience (CP 2.756). Gradual Induction makes a new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test, and is Qualitative or Quantitative. Qualitative Gradual Induction depends on estimating the relative evident weights of the various qualities of the subject class under investigation (CP 2.759; see also ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 7.114–20). Quantitative Gradual Induction depends on how often, in a fair sample of instances of ''S'', ''S'' is found actually accompanied by ''P'' that was predicted for ''S'' (CP 2.758). It depends on measurements, or statistics, or counting.\n:iii. Sentential Induction. \"...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result\".\n\n=====Against Cartesianism=====\nPeirce drew on the methodological implications of the [[#Four incapacities|four incapacities]]—no genuine introspection, no intuition in the sense of non-inferential cognition, no thought but in signs, and no conception of the absolutely incognizable—to attack philosophical [[René Descartes|Cartesianism]], of which he said that:<ref name=SCFI />\n\n1. \"It teaches that philosophy must begin in universal doubt\" – when, instead, we start with preconceptions, \"prejudices [...] which it does not occur to us ''can'' be questioned\", though we may find reason to question them later. \"Let us not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts.\"\n\n2. \"It teaches that the ultimate test of certainty is...in the individual consciousness\" – when, instead, in science a theory stays on probation till agreement is reached, then it has no actual doubters left. No lone individual can reasonably hope to fulfill philosophy's multi-generational dream. When \"candid and disciplined minds\" continue to disagree on a theoretical issue, even the theory's author should feel doubts about it.\n\n3. It trusts to \"a single thread of inference depending often upon inconspicuous premisses\" – when, instead, philosophy should, \"like the successful sciences\", proceed only from tangible, scrutinizable premisses and trust not to any one argument but instead to \"the multitude and variety of its arguments\" as forming, not a chain at least as weak as its weakest link, but \"a cable whose fibers\", soever \"slender, are sufficiently numerous and intimately connected\".\n\n4. It renders many facts \"absolutely inexplicable, unless to say that 'God makes them so' is to be regarded as an explanation\"<ref>Peirce believed in God. See section [[#Philosophy: metaphysics]].</ref> – when, instead, philosophy should avoid being \"unidealistic\",<ref>However, Peirce disagreed with Hegelian [[absolute idealism]]. See for example ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', 8.131.</ref> misbelieving that something real can defy or evade all possible ideas, and supposing, inevitably, \"some absolutely inexplicable, unanalyzable ultimate\", which explanatory surmise explains nothing and so is inadmissible.\n\n==Philosophy: metaphysics==\n<div class=infobox style=\"padding:5px;font-size:94%;width:auto\">Some noted articles\n* The ''Monist'' Metaphysical Series (1891–1893)\n** The Architecture of Theories (1891)\n** The Doctrine of Necessity Examined (1892)\n** The Law of Mind (1892)\n** Man's Glassy Essence (1892)\n** Evolutionary Love (1893)\n* Immortality in the Light of Synechism (1893 MS)</div>\nPeirce [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|divided]] metaphysics into (1) ontology or general metaphysics, (2) [[wikt:psychical|psychical]] or religious metaphysics, and (3) physical metaphysics.\n\n'''Ontology.'''

Peirce also argued that the will is free<ref>See his [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#MMS|\"The Doctrine of Necessity Examined\" (1892) and \"Reply to the Necessitarians\" (1893)]], to both of which editor [[Paul Carus]] responded.</ref> and (see [[Synechism]]) that there is at least an attenuated kind of immortality.\n\n'''Physical metaphysics.'''

His research career involved [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], and [[philosophy]]. His work on [[automata theory]] earned him the [[ACM Turing Award]] in 1976, while his collaborative work with [[Christopher Strachey]] in the 1970s laid the foundations of modern approaches to the [[semantics of programming languages]]. He has worked also on [[modal logic]], [[topology]], and [[category theory]].\n\n==Early career==\nHe received his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in Mathematics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1954. He wrote his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. thesis]] on ''Convergent Sequences of Complete Theories'' under the supervision of [[Alonzo Church]] while at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and defended his thesis in 1958. [[Solomon Feferman]] (2005) writes of this period:\n\n{{quote|''Scott began his studies in logic at Berkeley in the early 50s while still an undergraduate.  His unusual abilities were soon recognized and he quickly moved on to graduate classes and seminars with [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]] and became part of the group that surrounded him, including me and [[Richard Montague]]; so it was at that time that we became friends.  Scott was clearly in line to do a Ph. D. with Tarski, but they had a falling out for reasons explained in our biography.<ref>Feferman & Feferman 2004.</ref>  Upset by that, Scott left for Princeton where he finished with a Ph. D. under Alonzo Church.  But it was not long before the relationship between them was mended to the point that Tarski could say to him, \"I hope I can call you my student.\"''}}\n\nAfter completing his Ph.D. studies, he moved to the [[University of Chicago]], working as an instructor there until 1960.  In 1959, he published a joint paper with [[Michael O. Rabin]], a colleague from Princeton, titled ''Finite Automata and Their Decision Problem'' (Scott and Rabin 1959) which introduced the idea of nondeterministic machines to [[automata theory]]. This work led to the joint bestowal of the [[Turing Award]] on the two, for the introduction of this fundamental concept of [[computational complexity theory]].\n\n==University of California, Berkeley, 1960–1963==\nScott took up a post as Assistant Professor of Mathematics, back at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and involved himself with classical issues in [[mathematical logic]], especially [[set theory]] and Tarskian [[model theory]].\n\nDuring this period he started supervising Ph.D. students, such as James Halpern (''Contributions to the Study of the Independence of the Axiom of Choice'') and [[Edgar Lopez-Escobar]] (''Infinitely Long Formulas with Countable Quantifier Degrees'').\n\n===Modal and tense logic===\nScott also began working on [[modal logic]] in this period, beginning a collaboration with [[John Lemmon]], who moved to [[Claremont, California]], in 1963.  Scott was especially interested in [[Arthur Prior]]'s approach to [[tense logic]] and the connection to the treatment of time in natural-language semantics, and began collaborating with [[Richard Montague]] (Copeland 2004), whom he had known from his days as an undergraduate at Berkeley.  Later, Scott and Montague independently discovered an important generalisation of [[Kripke semantics]] for modal and tense logic, called [[Scott-Montague semantics]] (Scott 1970).\n\nJohn Lemmon and Scott began work on a modal-logic textbook that was interrupted by Lemmon's death in 1966.  Scott circulated the incomplete monograph amongst colleagues, introducing a number of important techniques in the semantics of model theory, most importantly presenting a refinement of ''canonical model'' that became standard, and introducing the technique of constructing models through ''filtrations'', both of which are core concepts in modern Kripke semantics (Blackburn, de Rijke, and Venema, 2001).  Scott eventually published the work as ''An Introduction to Modal Logic'' (Lemmon & Scott, 1977).\n\n==Stanford, Amsterdam and Princeton, 1963–1972==\nFollowing an initial observation of [[Robert Solovay]], Scott formulated the concept of [[Boolean-valued model]], as Solovay and [[Petr Vopěnka]] did likewise at around the same time. In 1967 Scott published a paper, ''A Proof of the Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis'', in which he used Boolean-valued models to provide an alternate analysis of the independence of the [[continuum hypothesis]] to that provided by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]]. This work led to the award of the [[Leroy P. Steele Prize]] in 1972.\n\n==Oxford University, 1972–1981==\nScott took up a post as Professor of Mathematical Logic on the Philosophy faculty of [[Oxford University]] in 1972. He was member of [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]] while at Oxford and is now an Honorary Fellow of the college.\n\n===Semantics of programming languages===\nThis period saw Scott working with [[Christopher Strachey]], and the two\nmanaged, despite administrative pressures,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} to do work on providing a mathematical foundation for the semantics of programming languages, the work for which Scott is best known{{opinion|date=January 2016}}. Together, their work constitutes the Scott–Strachey approach to [[denotational semantics]]; it constitutes one of the pieces of work in [[theoretical computer science]] and can perhaps{{According to whom|date=May 2017}} be regarded as founding one of the schools of [[computer science]]. One of Scott's contributions is his formulation of [[domain theory]], allowing programs involving recursive functions and looping-control constructs to be given denotational semantics. Additionally, he provided a foundation for the understanding of infinitary and continuous information through domain theory and his theory of [[Scott information system|information systems]].\n\nScott's work of this period led to the bestowal of:\n* The 1990 [[Harold Pender Award]] for his ''application of concepts from logic and algebra to the development of mathematical semantics of programming languages'';\n* The 1997 [[Rolf Schock Prize]] in logic and philosophy from the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] for ''his conceptually oriented logical works, especially the creation of domain theory, which has made it possible to extend Tarski's semantic paradigm to programming languages as well as to construct models of Curry's combinatory logic and Church's calculus of lambda conversion''; and\n* The 2001 [[Bolzano Prize]] for Merit in the Mathematical Sciences by the [[Czech Academy of Sciences]]\n* The 2007 [[EATCS]] Award for his contribution to theoretical computer science.\n\n==Carnegie Mellon University, 1981–2003==\nAt [[Carnegie Mellon University]], Scott proposed the theory of [[equilogical spaces]] as a successor theory to domain theory; among its many advantages, the category of equilogical spaces is a [[cartesian closed category]], whereas the category of domains<ref>Where here Dana Scott counts the category of domains to be the category whose objects are pointed directed-[[complete partial order]]s (DCPOs), and whose morphisms are the strict, [[Scott-continuous]] functions</ref> is not. In 1994, he was inducted as a [[Fellow]] of the [[Association for Computing Machinery]].

Skolem attended secondary school in [[Kristiania]] (later renamed [[Oslo]]), passing the university entrance examinations in 1905. He then entered [[Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet]] to study mathematics, also taking courses in [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[zoology]] and [[botany]].\n\nIn 1909, he began working as an assistant to the physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]], known for bombarding magnetized spheres with [[electron]]s and obtaining [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]-like effects; thus Skolem's first publications were physics papers written jointly with Birkeland. In 1913, Skolem passed the state examinations with distinction, and completed a dissertation titled ''Investigations on the Algebra of Logic''. He also traveled with Birkeland to the Sudan to observe the [[zodiacal light]]. He spent the winter semester of 1915 at the [[University of Göttingen]], at the time the leading research center in [[mathematical logic]], [[metamathematics]], and [[abstract algebra]], fields in which Skolem eventually excelled. In 1916 he was appointed a research fellow at Det Kongelige Frederiks Universitet. In 1918, he became a Docent in Mathematics and was elected to the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].\n\nSkolem did not at first formally enroll as a Ph.D. candidate, believing that the Ph.D. was unnecessary in Norway. He later changed his mind and submitted a thesis in 1926, titled ''Some theorems about integral solutions to certain algebraic equations and inequalities''. His notional thesis advisor was [[Axel Thue]], even though Thue had died in 1922.\n\nIn 1927, he married Edith Wilhelmine Hasvold.\n\nSkolem continued to teach at Det kongelige Frederiks Universitet (renamed the [[University of Oslo]] in 1939) until 1930 when he became a Research Associate in [[Chr. Michelsen Institute]] in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]. This senior post allowed Skolem to conduct research free of administrative and teaching duties. However, the position also required that he reside in Bergen, a city which then lacked a university and hence had no research library, so that he was unable to keep abreast of the mathematical literature. In 1938, he returned to Oslo to assume the Professorship of Mathematics at the university. There he taught the graduate courses in algebra and number theory, and only occasionally on mathematical logic. Skolem's Ph.D. student [[Øystein Ore]] went on to a career in the USA.\n\nSkolem served as president of the Norwegian Mathematical Society, and edited the ''Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift'' (\"The Norwegian Mathematical Journal\") for many years. He was also the founding editor of ''Mathematica Scandinavica''.\n\nAfter his 1957 retirement, he made several trips to the United States, speaking and teaching at universities there. He remained intellectually active until his sudden and unexpected death.\n\nFor more on Skolem's academic life, see Fenstad (1970).\n\n== Mathematics ==\nSkolem published around 180 papers on [[Diophantine equations]], [[group theory]], [[lattice theory]], and most of all, [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]]. He mostly published in Norwegian journals with limited international circulation, so that his results were occasionally rediscovered by others. An example is the [[Skolem–Noether theorem]], characterizing the [[automorphisms]] of simple algebras. Skolem published a proof in 1927, but [[Emmy Noether]] independently rediscovered it a few years later.\n\nSkolem was among the first to write on [[lattice (order)|lattice]]s. In 1912, he was the first to describe a free [[distributive lattice]] generated by ''n'' elements. In 1919, he showed that every [[implicative lattice]] (now also called a [[Skolem lattice]]) is distributive and, as a partial converse, that every finite distributive lattice is implicative. After these results were rediscovered by others, Skolem published a 1936 paper in German, \"Über gewisse 'Verbände' oder 'Lattices'\", surveying his earlier work in lattice theory.\n\nSkolem was a pioneer [[model theory|model theorist]]. In 1920, he greatly simplified the proof of a theorem [[Leopold Löwenheim]] first proved in 1915, resulting in the [[Löwenheim–Skolem theorem]], which states that if a countable first-order theory has an infinite model, then it has a countable model. His 1920 proof employed the [[axiom of choice]], but he later (1922 and 1928) gave proofs using [[Kőnig's lemma]] in place of that axiom. It is notable that Skolem, like Löwenheim, wrote on mathematical logic and set theory employing the notation of his fellow pioneering model theorists [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Ernst Schröder]], including ∏, ∑ as variable-binding quantifiers, in contrast to the notations of [[Peano]], [[Principia Mathematica]], and ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]''. Skolem (1934) pioneered the construction of [[Non-standard model of arithmetic|non-standard models of arithmetic]] and set theory.\n\nSkolem (1922) refined Zermelo's axioms for set theory by replacing Zermelo's vague notion of a \"definite\" property with any property that can be coded in [[first-order logic]]. The resulting axiom is now part of the standard axioms of set theory. Skolem also pointed out that a consequence of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem is what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]]: If Zermelo's axioms are consistent, then they must be satisfiable within a countable domain, even though they prove the existence of uncountable sets.\n\n== Completeness ==\nThe [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]] is an easy corollary of results Skolem proved in the early 1920s and discussed in Skolem (1928), but he failed to note this fact, perhaps because mathematicians and logicians did not become fully aware of completeness as a fundamental metamathematical problem until the 1928 first edition of Hilbert and Ackermann's ''[[Principles of Mathematical Logic]]'' clearly articulated it. In any event, [[Kurt Gödel]] first proved this completeness in 1930.\n\nSkolem distrusted the completed [[Infinity|infinite]] and was one of the founders of [[finitism]] in mathematics. Skolem (1923) sets out his [[primitive recursive arithmetic]], a very early contribution to the theory of [[computable function]]s, as a means of avoiding the so-called paradoxes of the infinite. Here he developed the arithmetic of the natural numbers by first defining objects by [[primitive recursion]], then devising another system to prove properties of the objects defined by the first system. These two systems enabled him to define [[prime number]]s and to set out a considerable amount of number theory. If the first of these systems can be considered as a programming language for defining objects, and the second as a programming logic for proving properties about the objects, Skolem can be seen as an unwitting pioneer of theoretical computer science.\n\nIn 1929, [[Presburger arithmetic|Presburger]] proved that [[Peano arithmetic]] without multiplication was [[consistent]], complete, and [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]. The following year, Skolem proved that the same was true of Peano arithmetic without addition, a system named [[Skolem arithmetic]] in his honor. [[Gödel]]'s famous 1931 result is that Peano arithmetic itself (with both addition and multiplication) is [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompletable]] and hence ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' undecidable.\n\n[[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] praised Skolem's work as follows:\n<blockquote>\"Skolem tends to treat general problems by concrete examples. He often seemed to present proofs in the same order as he came to discover them. This results in a fresh informality as well as a certain inconclusiveness. Many of his papers strike one as progress reports. Yet his ideas are often pregnant and potentially capable of wide application. He was very much a 'free spirit': he did not belong to any school, he did not found a school of his own, he did not usually make heavy use of known results... he was very much an innovator and most of his papers can be read and understood by those without much specialized knowledge. It seems quite likely that if he were young today, logic... would not have appealed to him.\" (Skolem 1970: 17-18)</blockquote>\n\nFor more on Skolem's accomplishments, see Hao Wang (1970).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Logic}}\n*[[Leopold Löwenheim]]\n*[[Model theory]]\n*[[Skolem normal form]]\n*[[Skolem's paradox]]\n*[[Skolem problem]]\n*[[Skolem sequence]]\n*[[Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary===\n* {{cite journal | url=http://matwbn.icm.edu.pl/ksiazki/fm/fm23/fm23115.pdf | author=Thoralf Skolem | title=Über die Nicht-charakterisierbarkeit der Zahlenreihe mittels endlich oder abzählbar unendlich vieler Aussagen mit ausschließlich Zahlenvariablen | language=German | journal=[[Fundamenta Mathematicae]] | volume=23 | number=1 | pages=150&mdash;161 | month= | year=1934 }} \n*Skolem, T.

Each turn of the spiral represents one power of &omega;]]\nIn [[set theory]], an '''ordinal number''', or '''ordinal''', is one generalization of the concept of a [[natural number]] that is used to describe a way to arrange a collection of objects in order, one after another.  Any finite collection of objects can be put in order just by the process of counting: labeling the objects with distinct natural numbers.  Ordinal numbers are thus the \"labels\" needed to arrange collections of objects in order.\n\nAn ordinal number is used to describe the [[order type]] of a [[well ordering|well-ordered]] set (though this does not work for a well-ordered [[proper class]]). A well-ordered set is a set with a relation > such that\n; [[Trichotomy (mathematics)|Trichotomy]]: For any elements ''x'' and ''y'', exactly one of these statements is true{{bulleted list\n| ''x'' > ''y''\n| ''y'' {{=}} ''x''\n| ''y'' > ''x''\n}}\n; [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: For any elements ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', if ''x'' > ''y'' and ''y'' > ''z'', then ''x'' > ''z''\n; [[Well-founded relation|Well-foundedness]]: Every non-empty subset has a least element, that is, it has an element ''x'' such that there is no other element ''y'' in the subset where ''x'' > ''y''\n\nTwo well-ordered sets have the same order type if and only if there is a [[bijection]] from one set to the other that converts the relation in the first set to the relation in the second set.\n\nWhereas ordinals are useful for ''ordering'' the objects in a collection, they are distinct from [[cardinal number]]s, which are useful for saying how many objects are in a collection. Although the distinction between ordinals and cardinals is not always apparent in finite sets (one can go from one to the other just by counting labels), different [[infinite set|infinite]] ordinals can describe the same cardinal.  Like other kinds of numbers, ordinals can be [[ordinal arithmetic|added, multiplied, and exponentiated]], although the addition and multiplication are not commutative.\n\nOrdinals were introduced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1883<ref>Thorough introductions are given by {{harv|Levy|1979}} and {{harv|Jech|2003}}.</ref> to accommodate infinite sequences and to classify [[Derived set (mathematics)|derived sets]], which he had previously introduced in 1872 while studying the uniqueness of [[trigonometric series]].<ref>{{citation\n | last = Hallett | first = Michael\n | doi = 10.1093/bjps/30.1.1\n | issue = 1\n | journal = The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science\n | mr = 532548\n | pages = 1–25\n | title = Towards a theory of mathematical research programmes.

When restricted to finite sets these two concepts coincide, there is only one way to put a finite set into a linear sequence, [[up to]] [[isomorphism]].  When dealing with infinite sets one has to distinguish between the notion of size, which leads to [[cardinal number]]s, and the notion of position, which is generalized by the ordinal numbers described here.  This is because while any set has only one size (its [[cardinality]]), there are many nonisomorphic [[well-ordering]]s of any infinite set, as explained below.\n\nWhereas the notion of cardinal number is associated with a set with no particular structure on it, the ordinals are intimately linked with the special kind of sets that are called [[well-order]]ed (so intimately linked, in fact, that some mathematicians make no distinction between the two concepts). A well-ordered set is a [[totally ordered]] set (given any two elements one defines a smaller and a larger one in a coherent way) in which there is no infinite ''decreasing'' sequence (however, there may be infinite increasing sequences); equivalently, every non-empty subset of the set has a least element. Ordinals may be used to label the elements of any given well-ordered set (the smallest element being labelled 0, the one after that 1, the next one 2, \"and so on\") and to measure the \"length\" of the whole set by the least ordinal that is not a label for an element of the set.  This \"length\" is called the ''order type'' of the set.\n\nAny ordinal is defined by the set of ordinals that precede it: in fact, the most common definition of ordinals ''identifies'' each ordinal ''as'' the set of ordinals that precede it.  For example, the ordinal 42 is the order type of the ordinals less than it, i.e., the ordinals from 0 (the smallest of all ordinals) to 41 (the immediate predecessor of 42), and it is generally identified as the set {{mset|0,1,2,…,41}}.  Conversely, any set ''S'' of ordinals that is downward-closed &mdash; meaning that for any ordinal α in ''S'' and any ordinal β < α, β is also in ''S'' &mdash; is (or can be identified with) an ordinal.\n\nThere are infinite ordinals as well: the smallest infinite ordinal is '''ω''', which is the order type of the natural numbers (finite ordinals) and that can even be identified with the ''set'' of natural numbers (indeed, the set of natural numbers is well-ordered—as is any set of ordinals—and since it is downward closed it can be identified with the ordinal associated with it, which is exactly how ω is defined).\n\n[[File:Ordinal ww.svg|thumb|right|256px|A graphical \"matchstick\" representation of the ordinal ω². Each stick corresponds to an ordinal of the form ω·''m''+''n'' where ''m'' and ''n'' are natural numbers.]]\n\nPerhaps a clearer intuition of ordinals can be formed by examining a first few of them: as mentioned above, they start with the natural numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, …  After ''all'' natural numbers comes the first infinite ordinal, ω, and after that come ω+1, ω+2, ω+3, and so on.  (Exactly what addition means will be defined later on: just consider them as names.)  After all of these come ω·2 (which is ω+ω), ω·2+1, ω·2+2, and so on, then ω·3, and then later on ω·4.  Now the set of ordinals formed in this way (the ω·''m''+''n'', where ''m'' and ''n'' are natural numbers) must itself have an ordinal associated with it: and that is ω<sup>2</sup>.  Further on, there will be ω<sup>3</sup>, then ω<sup>4</sup>, and so on, and ω<sup>ω</sup>, then ω<sup>ω<sup>ω</sup></sup>, then later ω<sup>ω<sup>ω<sup>ω</sup></sup></sup>, and even later ε<sub>0</sub> ([[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon nought]]) (to give a few examples of relatively small—countable—ordinals).  This can be continued indefinitely far (\"indefinitely far\" is exactly what ordinals are good at: every time one says \"and so on\" when enumerating ordinals, it defines a larger ordinal). The smallest [[uncountable set|uncountable]] ordinal is the set of all countable ordinals, expressed as [[First uncountable ordinal|ω<sub>1</sub>]].\n\n== Definitions ==\n\n=== Well-ordered sets ===\n\nIn a [[well-order]]ed set, every non-empty subset contains a distinct smallest element.  Given the [[axiom of dependent choice]], this is equivalent to just saying that the set is [[totally ordered]] and there is no infinite decreasing sequence, something perhaps easier to visualize. In practice, the importance of well-ordering is justified by the possibility of applying [[transfinite induction]], which says, essentially, that any property that passes on from the predecessors of an element to that element itself must be true of all elements (of the given well-ordered set).  If the states of a computation (computer program or game) can be well-ordered in such a way that each step is followed by a \"lower\" step, then the computation will terminate.\n\nIt is inappropriate to distinguish between two well-ordered sets if they only differ in the \"labeling of their elements\", or more formally: if the elements of the first set can be paired off with the elements of the second set such that if one element is smaller than another in the first set, then the partner of the first element is smaller than the partner of the second element in the second set, and vice versa.  Such a one-to-one correspondence is called an [[order isomorphism]] and the two well-ordered sets are said to be order-isomorphic, or ''similar'' (obviously this is an [[equivalence relation]]).  Provided there exists an order isomorphism between two well-ordered sets, the order isomorphism is unique: this makes it quite justifiable to consider the two sets as essentially identical, and to seek a \"canonical\" representative of the isomorphism type (class).  This is exactly what the ordinals provide, and it also provides a canonical labeling of the elements of any well-ordered set.  Formally, if a [[partial order]] < is defined on the set ''S'', and a partial order <' is defined on the set ''S' '', then the [[partially ordered set|poset]]s (''S'',<) and (''S' '',<') are [[order isomorphic]] if there is a [[bijection]] ''f'' that preserves the ordering. That is, ''f''(''a'') <' ''f''(''b'') if and only if ''a'' < ''b''. Every ''well-ordered'' set (''S'',<) is order isomorphic to the set of ordinals less than one specific ordinal number [the order type of (''S'',<)] under their natural ordering.\n\nEssentially, an ordinal is intended to be defined as an isomorphism class of well-ordered sets: that is, as an [[equivalence class]] for the [[equivalence relation]] of \"being order-isomorphic\".  There is a technical difficulty involved, however, in the fact that the equivalence class is too large to be a set in the usual [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] (ZF) formalization of set theory.  But this is not a serious difficulty.  The ordinal can be said to be the ''[[order type]]'' of any set in the class.\n\n=== Definition of an ordinal as an equivalence class ===\n\nThe original definition of ordinal numbers, found for example in the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', defines the order type of a well-ordering as the set of all well-orderings similar (order-isomorphic) to that well-ordering: in other words, an ordinal number is genuinely an equivalence class of well-ordered sets.  This definition must be abandoned in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] and related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because these equivalence classes are too large to form a set.  However, this definition still can be used in [[type theory]] and in Quine's axiomatic set theory [[New Foundations]] and related systems (where it affords a rather surprising alternative solution to the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] of the largest ordinal).\n\n=== Von Neumann definition of ordinals ===\n{{Main|Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers}}\n{{Also|Zermelo ordinals}}\n{| class=\"infobox\"\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center\" | First few von Neumann ordinals\n|-\n| 0\n| = {{mset| }}\n| = ∅\n|-\n| 1\n| = {{mset| 0 }}\n| = {{mset|∅}}\n|-\n| 2\n| = {{mset| 0, 1 }}\n| = {{mset| ∅, {{mset|∅}} }}\n|-\n| 3\n| = {{mset| 0, 1, 2 }}\n| = {{mset| ∅, {{mset|∅}} , {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}} }}\n|-\n| 4\n| = {{mset| 0, 1, 2, 3 }}\n| = {{mset| ∅, {{mset|∅}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}, {{mset|∅, {{mset|∅}}}}}} }}\n|}\nRather than defining an ordinal as an ''equivalence class'' of well-ordered sets, it will be defined as a particular well-ordered set that (canonically) represents the class.  Thus, an ordinal number will be a well-ordered set; and every well-ordered set will be order-isomorphic to exactly one ordinal number.\n\nThe standard definition, suggested by [[John von Neumann]] and now called definition of [[von Neumann ordinals]], is: \"each ordinal is the well-ordered set of all smaller ordinals.\" In symbols, λ = [0,λ).<ref name=\"von Neumann1923pp199-208\">{{Harvnb|von Neumann|1923}}</ref><ref>{{harv|Levy|1979|page=52}} attributes the idea to unpublished work of Zermelo in 1916 and several papers by von Neumann the 1920s.</ref> Formally:\n\n:A set ''S'' is an ordinal [[if and only if]] ''S'' is [[strict order|strictly]] well-ordered with respect to set membership and every element of ''S'' is also a subset of ''S''.\n\nThe natural numbers are thus ordinals by this definition. For instance, 2 is an element of 4 = {{mset|0, 1, 2, 3}}, and 2 is equal to {{mset|0, 1}} and so it is a subset of {{mset|0, 1, 2, 3}}.\n\nIt can be shown by [[transfinite induction]] that every well-ordered set is order-isomorphic to exactly one of these ordinals, that is, there is an order preserving [[bijective function]] between them.\n\nFurthermore, the elements of every ordinal are ordinals themselves. Given two ordinals ''S'' and ''T'', ''S'' is an element of ''T'' if and only if ''S'' is a [[proper subset]] of ''T''. Moreover, either ''S'' is an element of ''T'', or ''T'' is an element of ''S'', or they are equal. So every set of ordinals is [[total order|totally ordered]]. Further, every set of ordinals is well-ordered. This generalizes the fact that every set of natural numbers is well-ordered.\n\nConsequently, every ordinal ''S'' is a set having as elements precisely the ordinals smaller than ''S''. For example, every set of ordinals has a [[supremum]], the ordinal obtained by taking the union of all the ordinals in the set. This union exists regardless of the set's size, by the [[axiom of union]].\n\nThe class of all ordinals is not a set. If it were a set, one could show that it was an ordinal and thus a member of itself, which would contradict its ''strict'' ordering by membership. This is the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. The class of all ordinals is variously called \"Ord\", \"ON\", or \"∞\".\n\nAn ordinal is [[finite set|finite]] if and only if the opposite order is also well-ordered, which is the case if and only if each of its subsets has a [[maximum]].\n\n=== Other definitions ===\n\nThere are other modern formulations of the definition of ordinal. For example, assuming the [[axiom of regularity]], the following are equivalent for a set ''x'':\n*''x'' is an ordinal,\n*''x'' is a [[transitive set]], and set membership is [[trichotomy (mathematics)|trichotomous]] on ''x'',\n*''x'' is a transitive set [[total order|totally ordered]] by set inclusion,\n*''x'' is a transitive set of transitive sets.\nThese definitions cannot be used in [[non-well-founded set theory|non-well-founded set theories]]. In set theories with [[urelement]]s, one has to further make sure that the definition excludes urelements from appearing in ordinals.\n\n==Transfinite sequence==\nIf α is a [[limit ordinal]] and ''X'' is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of ''X'' is a function from α to ''X''.  This concept, a '''transfinite sequence''' or '''ordinal-indexed sequence''', is a generalization of the concept of a [[sequence]]. An ordinary sequence corresponds to the case α = ω.\n\n== Transfinite induction ==\n{{main article|Transfinite induction}}\n\nTransfinite induction holds in any [[well-order]]ed set, but it is so important in relation to ordinals that it is worth restating here.\n\n: Any property that passes from the set of ordinals smaller than a given ordinal α to α itself, is true of all ordinals.\n\nThat is, if ''P''(α) is true whenever ''P''(β) is true for all {{nowrap|β < α}}, then ''P''(α) is true for ''all'' α.  Or, more practically: in order to prove a property ''P'' for all ordinals α, one can assume that it is already known for all smaller {{nowrap|β < α}}.\n\n=== Transfinite recursion ===\n\nTransfinite induction can be used not only to prove things, but also to define them. Such a definition is normally said to be by [[transfinite recursion]] – the proof that the result is well-defined uses transfinite induction. Let ''F'' denote a (class) function ''F'' to be defined on the ordinals. The idea now is that, in defining ''F''(α) for an unspecified ordinal α, one may assume that ''F''(β) is already defined for all {{nowrap|β < α}} and thus give a formula for ''F''(α) in terms of these ''F''(β). It then follows by transfinite induction that there is one and only one function satisfying the recursion formula up to and including α.\n\nHere is an example of definition by transfinite recursion on the ordinals (more will be given later): define function ''F'' by letting ''F''(α) be the smallest ordinal not in the set {{nowrap|{{mset|''F''(β) | β < α}}}}, that is, the set consisting of all ''F''(β) for {{nowrap|β < α}}. This definition assumes the ''F''(β) known in the very process of defining ''F''; this apparent vicious circle is exactly what definition by transfinite recursion permits. In fact, ''F''(0) makes sense since there is no ordinal {{nowrap|β < 0}}, and the set {{nowrap|{{mset|''F''(β) | β < 0}}}} is empty. So ''F''(0) is equal to 0 (the smallest ordinal of all). Now that ''F''(0) is known, the definition applied to ''F''(1) makes sense (it is the smallest ordinal not in the singleton set {{nowrap|1={{mset|''F''(0)}} = {{mset|0}}}}), and so on (the ''and so on'' is exactly transfinite induction). It turns out that this example is not very exciting, since provably {{nowrap|1=''F''(α) = α}} for all ordinals α, which can be shown, precisely, by transfinite induction.\n\n=== Successor and limit ordinals ===\nAny nonzero ordinal has the minimum element, zero. It may or may not have a maximum element. For example, 42 has maximum 41 and ω+6 has maximum ω+5. On the other hand, ω does not have a maximum since there is no largest natural number. If an ordinal has a maximum α, then it is the next ordinal after α, and it is called a ''[[successor ordinal]]'', namely the successor of α, written α+1.  In the von Neumann definition of ordinals, the successor of α is <math>\\alpha\\cup\\{\\alpha\\}</math> since its elements are those of α and α itself.<ref name=\"von Neumann1923pp199-208\" />\n\nA nonzero ordinal that is ''not'' a successor is called a ''[[limit ordinal]]''.  One justification for this term is that a limit ordinal is the [[limit point|limit]] in a topological sense of all smaller ordinals (under the [[order topology]]).\n\nWhen <math>\\langle \\alpha_{\\iota} | \\iota < \\gamma \\rangle</math> is an ordinal-indexed sequence, indexed by a limit γ and the sequence is ''increasing'', i.e. <math>\\alpha_{\\iota} < \\alpha_{\\rho}\\!</math> whenever <math>\\iota < \\rho,\\!</math> its ''limit'' is defined as the least upper bound of the set <math>\\{ \\alpha_{\\iota} | \\iota < \\gamma \\},\\!</math> that is, the smallest ordinal (it always exists) greater than any term of the sequence.  In this sense, a limit ordinal is the limit of all smaller ordinals (indexed by itself). Put more directly, it is the supremum of the set of smaller ordinals.\n\nAnother way of defining a limit ordinal is to say that α is a limit ordinal if and only if:\n\n: There is an ordinal less than α and whenever ζ is an ordinal less than α, then there exists an ordinal ξ such that ζ&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;ξ&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;α.\n\nSo in the following sequence:\n\n: 0, 1, 2, …, ω, ω+1\n\nω is a limit ordinal because for any smaller ordinal (in this example, a natural number) there is another ordinal (natural number) larger than it, but still less than ω.\n\nThus, every ordinal is either zero, or a successor (of a well-defined predecessor), or a limit.  This distinction is important, because many definitions by transfinite induction rely upon it.  Very often, when defining a function ''F'' by transfinite induction on all ordinals, one defines ''F''(0), and ''F''(α+1) assuming ''F''(α) is defined, and then, for limit ordinals δ one defines ''F''(δ) as the limit of the ''F''(β) for all β<δ (either in the sense of ordinal limits, as previously explained, or for some other notion of limit if ''F'' does not take ordinal values).  Thus, the interesting step in the definition is the successor step, not the limit ordinals.  Such functions (especially for ''F'' nondecreasing and taking ordinal values) are called continuous.  Ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation are continuous as functions of their second argument.\n\n=== Indexing classes of ordinals ===\n\nAny well-ordered set is similar (order-isomorphic) to a unique ordinal number <math>\\alpha</math>; in other words, its elements can be indexed in increasing fashion by the ordinals less than <math>\\alpha</math>.  This applies, in particular, to any set of ordinals: any set of ordinals is naturally indexed by the ordinals less than some <math>\\alpha</math>.  The same holds, with a slight modification, for ''classes'' of ordinals (a collection of ordinals, possibly too large to form a set, defined by some property): any class of ordinals can be indexed by ordinals (and, when the class is unbounded in the class of all ordinals, this puts it in class-bijection with the class of all ordinals).  So the <math>\\gamma</math>-th element in the class (with the convention that the \"0-th\" is the smallest, the \"1-st\" is the next smallest, and so on) can be freely spoken of.  Formally, the definition is by transfinite induction: the <math>\\gamma</math>-th element of the class is defined (provided it has already been defined for all <math>\\beta<\\gamma</math>), as the smallest element greater than the <math>\\beta</math>-th element for all <math>\\beta<\\gamma</math>.\n\nThis could be applied, for example, to the class of limit ordinals: the <math>\\gamma</math>-th ordinal, which is either a limit or zero is <math>\\omega\\cdot\\gamma</math> (see [[ordinal arithmetic]] for the definition of multiplication of ordinals).  Similarly, one can consider ''[[additively indecomposable ordinal]]s'' (meaning a nonzero ordinal that is not the sum of two strictly smaller ordinals): the <math>\\gamma</math>-th additively indecomposable ordinal is indexed as <math>\\omega^\\gamma</math>.  The technique of indexing classes of ordinals is often useful in the context of fixed points: for example, the <math>\\gamma</math>-th ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> such that <math>\\omega^\\alpha = \\alpha</math> is written <math>\\varepsilon_\\gamma</math>. These are called the \"[[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon numbers]]\".\n\n=== Closed unbounded sets and classes ===\n\nA class <math>C</math> of ordinals is said to be '''unbounded''', or '''cofinal''', when given any ordinal <math>\\alpha</math>, there is a <math>\\beta</math> in <math>C</math> such that <math>\\alpha < \\beta</math> (then the class must be a proper class, i.e., it cannot be a set).  It is said to be '''closed''' when the limit of a sequence of ordinals in the class is again in the class: or, equivalently, when the indexing (class-)function <math>F</math> is continuous in the sense that, for <math>\\delta</math> a limit ordinal, <math>F(\\delta)</math> (the <math>\\delta</math>-th ordinal in the class) is the limit of all <math>F(\\gamma)</math> for <math>\\gamma < \\delta</math>; this is also the same as being closed, in the [[topological space|topological]] sense, for the [[order topology]] (to avoid talking of topology on proper classes, one can demand that the intersection of the class with any given ordinal is closed for the order topology on that ordinal, this is again equivalent).\n\nOf particular importance are those classes of ordinals that are [[club set|closed and unbounded]], sometimes called '''clubs'''.  For example, the class of all limit ordinals is closed and unbounded: this translates the fact that there is always a limit ordinal greater than a given ordinal, and that a limit of limit ordinals is a limit ordinal (a fortunate fact if the terminology is to make any sense at all!).  The class of additively indecomposable ordinals, or the class of <math>\\varepsilon_\\cdot</math> ordinals, or the class of [[#Ordinals and cardinals|cardinals]], are all closed unbounded; the set of [[#Cofinality|regular]] cardinals, however, is unbounded but not closed, and any finite set of ordinals is closed but not unbounded.\n\nA class is stationary if it has a nonempty intersection with every closed unbounded class.  All superclasses of closed unbounded classes are stationary, and stationary classes are unbounded, but there are stationary classes that are not closed and stationary classes that have no closed unbounded subclass (such as the class of all limit ordinals with countable cofinality).  Since the intersection of two closed unbounded classes is closed and unbounded, the intersection of a stationary class and a closed unbounded class is stationary.  But the intersection of two stationary classes may be empty, e.g. the class of ordinals with cofinality ω with the class of ordinals with uncountable cofinality.\n\nRather than formulating these definitions for (proper) classes of ordinals, one can formulate them for sets of ordinals below a given ordinal <math>\\alpha</math>:  A subset of a limit ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> is said to be unbounded (or cofinal) under <math>\\alpha</math> provided any ordinal less than <math>\\alpha</math> is less than some ordinal in the set.  More generally, one can call a subset of any ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> cofinal in <math>\\alpha</math> provided every ordinal less than <math>\\alpha</math> is less than ''or equal to'' some ordinal in the set. The subset is said to be closed under <math>\\alpha</math> provided it is closed for the order topology ''in'' <math>\\alpha</math>, i.e. a limit of ordinals in the set is either in the set or equal to <math>\\alpha</math> itself.\n\n== Arithmetic of ordinals ==\n{{main article|Ordinal arithmetic}}\n\nThere are three usual operations on ordinals: addition, multiplication, and (ordinal) exponentiation.  Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set that represents the operation or by using transfinite recursion.  The [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] provides a standardized way of writing ordinals.  It uniquely represents each ordinal as a finite sum of ordinal powers of ω. However, this cannot form the basis of a universal ordinal notation due to such self-referential representations as ε<sub>0</sub> = ω<sup>ε<sub>0</sub></sup>. The so-called \"natural\" arithmetical operations retain commutativity at the expense of continuity.\n\nInterpreted as [[nimber]]s, ordinals are also subject to nimber arithmetic operations.\n\n== Ordinals and cardinals ==\n\n=== Initial ordinal of a cardinal ===\n\nEach ordinal associates with one [[cardinal number|cardinal]], its cardinality. If there is a bijection between two ordinals (e.g. {{nowrap|ω {{=}} 1 + ω}} and {{nowrap|ω + 1 > ω}}), then they associate with the same cardinal. Any well-ordered set having an ordinal as its order-type has the same cardinality as that ordinal. The least ordinal associated with a given cardinal is called the ''initial ordinal'' of that cardinal. Every finite ordinal (natural number) is initial, and no other ordinal associates with its cardinal. But most infinite ordinals are not initial, as many infinite ordinals associate with the same cardinal. The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered, i.e. that every cardinal has an initial ordinal. In theories with the axiom of choice, the cardinal number of any set has an initial ordinal, and one may employ the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]] as the cardinal's representation. In set theories without the axiom of choice, a cardinal may be represented by the set of sets with that cardinality having minimal rank (see [[Scott's trick]]).\n\nThe α-th infinite initial ordinal is written <math>\\omega_\\alpha</math>, it is always a limit ordinal. Its cardinality is written <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math>.  For example, the cardinality of ω<sub>0</sub> = ω is <math>\\aleph_0</math>, which is also the cardinality of ω<sup>2</sup> or ε<sub>0</sub> (all are countable ordinals).  So ω can be identified with <math>\\aleph_0</math>, except that the notation <math>\\aleph_0</math> is used when writing cardinals, and ω when writing ordinals (this is important since, for example, <math>\\aleph_0^2</math> = <math>\\aleph_0</math> whereas <math>\\omega^2 > \\omega</math>).  Also, <math>\\omega_1</math> is the smallest uncountable ordinal (to see that it exists, consider the set of equivalence classes of well-orderings of the natural numbers: each such well-ordering defines a countable ordinal, and <math>\\omega_1</math> is the order type of that set), <math>\\omega_2</math> is the smallest ordinal whose cardinality is greater than <math>\\aleph_1</math>, and so on, and <math>\\omega_\\omega</math> is the limit of the <math>\\omega_n</math> for natural numbers ''n'' (any limit of cardinals is a cardinal, so this limit is indeed the first cardinal after all the <math>\\omega_n</math>).\n\n=== Cofinality ===\n\nThe [[cofinality]] of an ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> is the smallest ordinal <math>\\delta</math> that is the order type of a [[cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] subset of <math>\\alpha</math>.  Notice that a number of authors define cofinality or use it only for limit ordinals.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other well-ordered set is the cofinality of the order type of that set.\n\nThus for a limit ordinal, there exists a <math>\\delta</math>-indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit <math>\\alpha</math>.  For example, the cofinality of ω² is ω, because the sequence ω·''m'' (where ''m'' ranges over the natural numbers) tends to ω²; but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality ω.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality ω as does <math>\\omega_\\omega</math> or an uncountable cofinality.\n\nThe cofinality of 0 is 0.  And the cofinality of any successor ordinal is 1.  The cofinality of any limit ordinal is at least <math>\\omega</math>.\n\nAn ordinal that is equal to its cofinality is called regular and it is always an initial ordinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial even if it is not regular, which it usually is not.  If the Axiom of Choice, then <math>\\omega_{\\alpha+1}</math> is regular for each α.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega_1</math>, and <math>\\omega_2</math> are regular, whereas 2, 3, <math>\\omega_\\omega</math>, and ω<sub>ω·2</sub> are initial ordinals that are not regular.\n\nThe cofinality of any ordinal ''α'' is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of ''α'' is the same as the cofinality of ''α''.  So the cofinality operation is [[idempotent]].\n\n== Some \"large\" countable ordinals ==\n{{details|Large countable ordinal}}\n\nAs mentioned above (see [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]]) the ordinal ε<sub>0</sub>, which is the smallest satisfying the equation <math>\\omega^\\alpha = \\alpha</math>, so it is the limit of the sequence 0, 1, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>, etc.  Many ordinals can be defined in such a manner as fixed points of certain ordinal functions (the <math>\\iota</math>-th ordinal such that <math>\\omega^\\alpha = \\alpha</math> is called <math>\\varepsilon_\\iota</math>, then one could go on trying to find the <math>\\iota</math>-th ordinal such that <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha = \\alpha</math>, \"and so on\", but all the subtlety lies in the \"and so on\").  One could try to do this systematically, but no matter what system is used to define and construct ordinals, there is always an ordinal that lies just above all the ordinals constructed by the system.  Perhaps the most important ordinal that limits a system of construction in this manner is the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math> (despite the <math>\\omega_1</math> in the name, this ordinal is countable), which is the smallest ordinal that cannot in any way be represented by a [[computable function]] (this can be made rigorous, of course).  Considerably large ordinals can be defined below <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math>, however, which measure the \"proof-theoretic strength\" of certain [[formal system]]s (for example, <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> measures the strength of [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]).  Large countable ordinals can also be defined above the Church-Kleene ordinal, which are of interest in various parts of logic.{{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n== Topology and ordinals ==\n{{details|Order topology}}\nAny ordinal number can be made into a [[topological space]] by endowing it with the [[order topology]]; this topology is [[discrete topology|discrete]] if and only if the ordinal is a countable cardinal, i.e. at most ω. A subset of ω&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 is open in the order topology if and only if either it is [[cofinite]] or it does not contain ω as an element.\n\nSee the [[Order topology#Topology and ordinals|Topology and ordinals]] section of the \"Order topology\" article.\n\n==Downward closed sets of ordinals==\nA set is [[downward closed]] if anything less than an element of the set is also in the set. If a set of ordinals is downward closed, then that set is an ordinal—the least ordinal not in the set. <!-- Suppose a property is such that if is true for an ordinal it is true for all smaller ones. This means that it holds for a [[downward closed]] set of ordinals, which is itself an ordinal. Thus the smallest ordinal that does not have the property is the set of ordinals that has the property. -->\n\nExamples:\n*The set of ordinals less than 3 is 3 = {{mset| 0, 1, 2 }}, the smallest ordinal not less than 3.\n*The set of finite ordinals is infinite, the smallest infinite ordinal: ω.\n*The set of countable ordinals is uncountable, the smallest uncountable ordinal: ω<sub>1</sub>.\n\n== History ==\nThe transfinite ordinal numbers, which first appeared in 1883,<ref>Cantor 1883. English translation: {{harvnb|Ewald|1996|pages=881&ndash;920}}</ref> originated in Cantor's work with [[Derived set (mathematics)|derived set]]s. If ''P'' is a set of real numbers, the derived set ''P' '' is the set of [[limit point]]s of ''P''. In 1872, Cantor generated the sets ''P''<sup>(''n'')</sup> by applying the derived set operation ''n'' times to ''P''. In 1880, he pointed out that these sets form the sequence ''P'&nbsp;''⊇&nbsp;···&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(''n'')</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;···, and he continued the derivation process by defining ''P''<sup>(∞)</sup> as the intersection of these sets. Then he iterated the derived set operation and intersections to extend his sequence of sets into the infinite: ''P''<sup>(∞)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(∞&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(∞&nbsp;+&nbsp;2)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;··· ⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(2∞)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;···&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;''P''<sup>(∞<sup>2</sup>)</sup>&nbsp;⊇&nbsp;···.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferreirós|1995|pages=34&ndash;35}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pages=159, 204–5}}</ref> The superscripts containing ∞ are just indices defined by the derivation process.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|page=269}}</ref>\n\nCantor used these sets in the theorems: (1) If ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅ for some index α, then ''P' '' is countable; (2) Conversely, if ''P' '' is countable, then there is an index α such that ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅. These theorems are proved by partitioning ''P' '' into [[pairwise disjoint]] sets: ''P'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''P'&nbsp;''∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(2)</sup>)&nbsp;∪&nbsp;(''P''<sup>(2)</sup>&nbsp;∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(3)</sup>)&nbsp;∪&nbsp;··· ∪&nbsp;(''P''<sup>(∞)</sup>&nbsp;∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(∞&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>)&nbsp;∪&nbsp;···&nbsp;∪&nbsp;''P''<sup>(α)</sup>. For β&nbsp;<&nbsp;α: since ''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup> contains the limit points of ''P''<sup>(β)</sup>, the sets ''P''<sup>(β)</sup>&nbsp;∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup> have no limit points. Hence, they are [[discrete set]]s, so they are countable. Proof of first theorem: If ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅ for some index α, then ''P' '' is the countable union of countable sets. Therefore, ''P' '' is countable.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferreirós|1995|pages=35&ndash;36}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós 2007|page=207}}</ref>\n\nThe second theorem requires proving the existence of an α such that ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅. To prove this, Cantor considered the set of all α having countably many predecessors. To define this set, he defined the transfinite ordinal numbers and transformed the infinite indices into ordinals by replacing ∞ with ω, the first transfinite ordinal number. Cantor called the set of finite ordinals the first '''number class'''. The second number class is the set of ordinals whose predecessors form a countably infinite set. The set of all α having countably many predecessors—that is, the set of countable ordinals—is the union of these two number classes. Cantor proved that the cardinality of the second number class is the first uncountable cardinality.<ref>{{harvnb|Ferreirós|1995|pages=36&ndash;37}}; {{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|page=271}}</ref>\n\nCantor's second theorem becomes: If ''P' '' is countable, then there is a countable ordinal α such that ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅. Its proof uses [[proof by contradiction]]. Let ''P' '' be countable, and assume there is no such α. This assumption produces two cases.\n{{plainlist|indent=1}}\n* Case 1: ''P''<sup>(β)</sup>&nbsp;∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup> is non-empty for all countable β. Since there are uncountably many of these pairwise disjoint sets, their union is uncountable. This union is a subset of ''P''', so ''P' '' is uncountable.\n* Case 2: ''P''<sup>(β)</sup>&nbsp;∖&nbsp;''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup> is empty for some countable β. Since ''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''P''<sup>(β)</sup>, this implies ''P''<sup>(β&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''P''<sup>(β)</sup>. Thus, ''P''<sup>(β)</sup> is a [[derived set (mathematics)#Properties|perfect set]], so it is uncountable.<ref>{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|page=111}}</ref> Since ''P''<sup>(β)</sup>&nbsp;⊆&nbsp;''P''', the set ''P' '' is uncountable.\n{{endplainlist}}\nIn both cases, ''P' '' is uncountable, which contradicts ''P' '' being countable. Therefore, there is a countable ordinal α such that ''P''<sup>(α)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;∅. Cantor's work with derived sets and ordinal numbers led to the [[Cantor-Bendixson theorem]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ferreirós|2007|pages=207–8}}</ref>\n\nUsing successors, limits, and cardinality, Cantor generated an unbounded sequence of ordinal numbers and number classes.<ref>{{harvnb|Dauben|1979|pages=97&ndash;98}}</ref> The (α&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th number class is the set of ordinals whose predecessors form a set of the same cardinality as the α-th number class. The cardinality of the (α&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-th number class is the cardinality immediately following that of the α-th number class.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallett|1986|pages=61&ndash;62}}</ref> For a limit ordinal α, the α-th number class is the union of the β-th number classes for β&nbsp;<&nbsp;α.<ref>{{harvnb|Tait|1997|page=5 footnote}}</ref> Its cardinality is the limit of the cardinalities of these number classes.\n\nIf ''n'' is finite, the ''n''-th number class has cardinality <math>\\aleph_{n-1}</math>. If α&nbsp;≥&nbsp;ω, the α-th number class has cardinality <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math>.<ref>The first number class has cardinality <math>\\aleph_0</math>. [[Mathematical induction]] proves that the ''n''-th number class has cardinality <math>\\aleph_{n-1}</math>. Since the ω-th number class is the union of the ''n''-th number classes, its cardinality is <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math>, the limit of the <math>\\aleph_{n-1}</math>. [[#Transfinite induction|Transfinite induction]] proves that if α&nbsp;≥&nbsp;ω, the α-th number class has cardinality <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math>.</ref> Therefore, the cardinalities of the number classes correspond one-to-one with the [[aleph number]]s. Also, the α-th number class consists of ordinals different from those in the preceding number classes if and only if α is a non-limit ordinal. Therefore, the non-limit number classes partition the ordinals into pairwise disjoint sets.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Counting]]\n*[[Order topology#Ordinal space|Ordinal space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last = Cantor | first = Georg | authorlink = Georg Cantor | title = Ueber unendliche, lineare Punktmannichfaltigkeiten. 5. |  url = http://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/dms/load/img/?PPN=PPN235181684_0021&DMDID=DMDLOG_0051 | journal = [[Mathematische Annalen]] | volume = 21 | number = 4 | pages = 545&ndash;591 | year = 1883 | doi = 10.1007/bf01446819}}.

      "text": "In [[set theory]], a field of [[mathematics]], the '''Burali-Forti paradox''' demonstrates that constructing \"the set of all [[ordinal number]]s\" leads to a contradiction and therefore shows an [[antinomy]] in a system that allows its construction. It is named after [[Cesare Burali-Forti]], who in 1897 published a paper proving a theorem which, unknown to him, contradicted a previously proved result by Cantor. [[Bertrand Russell]] subsequently noticed the contradiction, and when he published it in his 1903 book ''Principles of Mathematics'', he stated that it had been suggested to him by Burali-Forti's paper, with the result that it came to be known by Burali-Forti's name.\n\n==Stated in terms of von Neumann ordinals==\n\nWe will prove this by reductio ad absurdum.\n\n# Let <math>\\Omega</math> be a set that contains all ordinal numbers.\n# <math>\\Omega</math> is [[Transitive set|transitive]] because for every element <math>x</math> of <math>\\Omega</math> (which is an ordinal number and can be any ordinal number) and every element <math>y</math> of <math>x</math> (i.e. under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, for every ordinal number <math>y < x</math>), we have that <math>y</math> is an element of <math>\\Omega</math> because any ordinal number contains only ordinal numbers, by the definition of this ordinal construction.\n# <math>\\Omega</math> is well ordered by the membership relation because all its elements are also well ordered by this relation.\n# So, by steps 2 and 3, we have that <math>\\Omega</math> is an ordinal class and also, by step 1, an ordinal number, because all ordinal classes that are sets are also ordinal numbers.\n# This implies that <math>\\Omega</math> is an element of <math>\\Omega</math>.\n# Under the definition of Von Neumann ordinals, <math>\\Omega < \\Omega</math> is the same as <math>\\Omega</math> being an element of <math>\\Omega</math>. This latter statement is proven by step 5.\n# But we have that no ordinal class is less than itself, including <math>\\Omega</math> because of step 4 (<math>\\Omega</math> is an ordinal class), i.e. <math>\\lnot (\\Omega < \\Omega)</math>.\n\nWe've deduced two contradictory propositions (<math>\\Omega < \\Omega</math> and <math>\\lnot (\\Omega < \\Omega)</math>) from the sethood of <math>\\Omega</math> and, therefore, disproved that <math>\\Omega</math> is a set.\n\n==Stated more generally==\n\nThe version of the paradox above is anachronistic, because it presupposes the definition of the ordinals due to [[John von Neumann]], under which each ordinal is the set of all preceding ordinals, which was not known at the time the paradox was framed by Burali-Forti.\nHere is an account with fewer presuppositions:  suppose that we associate with each [[well-ordering]]\nan object called its [[order type]] in an unspecified way (the order types are the ordinal numbers).  The order types (ordinal numbers) themselves are well-ordered in a natural way,\nand this well-ordering must have an order type <math>\\Omega</math>.  It is easily shown in\n[[naive set theory|naïve set theory]] (and remains true in [[ZFC]] but not in [[New Foundations]]) that the order\ntype of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed <math>\\alpha</math> is <math>\\alpha</math> itself.\nSo the order\ntype of all ordinal numbers less than  <math>\\Omega</math> is <math>\\Omega</math> itself.  But\nthis means that <math>\\Omega</math>, being the order type of a proper initial segment of the ordinals,  is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals,\nbut the latter is <math>\\Omega</math> itself by definition.  This is a contradiction.\n\nIf we use the von Neumann definition, under which each ordinal is identified as the set of all preceding ordinals, the paradox is unavoidable:  the offending proposition that the order type of all ordinal numbers less than a fixed <math>\\alpha</math> is <math>\\alpha</math> itself must be true.  The collection of von Neumann ordinals, like the collection in the [[Russell paradox]], cannot be a set in any set theory with classical logic.  But the collection of order types in New Foundations (defined as equivalence classes of well-orderings under similarity) is actually a set, and the paradox is avoided because the order type of the ordinals less than <math>\\Omega</math>\nturns out not to be <math>\\Omega</math>.\n\n==Resolutions of the paradox==\n\nModern [[axiomatic set theory|axioms for formal set theory]] such as ZF and ZFC circumvent this antinomy by not allowing the construction of sets using [[unrestricted comprehension|terms like \"all sets with the property <math>P</math>\"]], as is possible in [[naive set theory]] and as is possible with [[Gottlob Frege]]'s axioms - specifically Basic Law V - in the \"Grundgesetze der Arithmetik.\" Quine's system [[New Foundations]] (NF) uses a [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|different solution]]. {{harvs|txt|last=Rosser|year=1942}} showed that in the original version of Quine's system \"Mathematical Logic\" (ML), an extension of New Foundations, it is possible to derive the Burali-Forti paradox, showing that this system was contradictory.  Quine's revision of ML following Rosser's discovery does not suffer from this defect, and indeed was subsequently proved equiconsistent with NF by [[Hao_Wang_(academic)|Hao Wang]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{citation|first=Cesare|last=Burali-Forti|title= Una questione sui numeri transfiniti|journal=[[Rendiconti del Circolo Matematico di Palermo]]|volume=11|pages=154–164|year=1897|doi=10.1007/BF03015911}}\n* [[Irving Copi]] (1958) \"The Burali-Forti Paradox\", [[Philosophy of Science (journal)|Philosophy of Science]] 25(4): 281-286, {{doi|10.1086/287617}}\n* {{citation|journal=[[Historia Mathematica]]|volume= 8|issue= 3|year= 1981|pages= 319–350|title=Burali-Forti's paradox: A reappraisal of its origins|first=Gregory H|last= Moore|first2= Alejandro |last2=Garciadiego\n|doi=10.1016/0315-0860(81)90070-7}}\n* {{citation|mr=0006327 |last=Rosser|first= Barkley|title=The Burali-Forti paradox|journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]|volume= 7|issue=1|year=1942|pages= 1–17|doi=10.2307/2267550|jstor=2267550}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]: \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/paradoxes-contemporary-logic/ Paradoxes and Contemporary Logic]\"—by Andrea Cantini.\n\n[[Category:Ordinal numbers]]\n[[Category:Paradoxes of naive set theory]]"

The name ''club'' is a contraction of \"closed and unbounded\".\n\n== Formal definition ==\nFormally, if <math>\\kappa</math> is a limit ordinal, then a set <math>C\\subseteq\\kappa</math> is ''closed'' in <math>\\kappa</math> [[if and only if]] for every <math>\\alpha<\\kappa</math>, if <math>\\sup(C\\cap \\alpha)=\\alpha\\ne0</math>, then <math>\\alpha\\in C</math>.  Thus, if the [[Limit of a sequence|limit of some sequence]] from <math>C</math> is less than <math>\\kappa</math>, then the limit is also in <math>C</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\kappa</math> is a limit ordinal and <math>C\\subseteq\\kappa</math> then <math>C</math> is '''unbounded''' in <math>\\kappa</math> if for any <math>\\alpha<\\kappa</math>, there is some <math>\\beta\\in C</math> such that <math>\\alpha<\\beta</math>.\n\nIf a set is both closed and unbounded, then it is a '''club set'''. Closed [[proper class]]es are also of interest (every proper class of ordinals is unbounded in the class of all ordinals).\n\nFor example, the set of all [[countable]] limit ordinals is a club set with respect to the [[first uncountable ordinal]]; but it is not a club set with respect to any higher limit ordinal, since it is neither closed nor unbounded.\nThe set of all limit ordinals <math>\\alpha<\\kappa</math> is closed unbounded in <math>\\kappa   </math>  (<math>\\kappa   </math> regular).   In fact a  club set is nothing else but the range of   a [[normal function]]  (i.e. increasing and continuous).\n\nMore generally, if <math>X</math> is a nonempty set and <math>\\lambda</math> is a cardinal, then <math>C\\subseteq[X]^\\lambda</math> is ''club'' if every union of a subset of <math>C</math> is in <math>C</math> and every subset of <math>X</math> of cardinality less than <math>\\lambda</math> is contained in some element of <math>C</math> (see [[stationary set]]).\n\n== The closed unbounded filter ==\nLet <math>\\kappa \\,</math> be a limit ordinal of uncountable [[cofinality]] <math>\\lambda \\,.</math> For some <math>\\alpha < \\lambda \\,</math>, let <math>\\langle C_\\xi : \\xi < \\alpha\\rangle \\,</math> be a sequence of closed unbounded subsets of <math>\\kappa \\,.</math> Then <math>\\bigcap_{\\xi < \\alpha} C_\\xi \\,</math> is also closed unbounded. To see this, one can note that an intersection of closed sets is always closed, so we just need to show that this intersection is unbounded. So fix any <math>\\beta_0 < \\kappa \\,,</math> and for each ''n''<&omega; choose from each <math>C_\\xi \\,</math> an element <math>\\beta_{n+1}^\\xi > \\beta_{n} \\,,</math> which is possible because each is unbounded. Since this is a collection of fewer than <math>\\lambda \\,</math> ordinals, all less than <math>\\kappa \\,,</math> their least upper bound must also be less than <math>\\kappa \\,,</math> so we can call it <math>\\beta_{n+1} \\,.</math> This process generates a countable sequence <math>\\beta_0,\\beta_1,\\beta_2,\\dots \\,.</math> The limit of this sequence must in fact also be the limit of the sequence <math>\\beta_0^\\xi,\\beta_1^\\xi,\\beta_2^\\xi,\\dots \\,,</math> and since each <math>C_\\xi \\,</math> is closed and <math>\\lambda \\,</math> is uncountable, this limit must be in each <math>C_\\xi \\,,</math> and therefore this limit is an element of the intersection that is above <math>\\beta_0 \\,,</math> which shows that the intersection is unbounded. QED.\n\nFrom this, it can be seen that if <math>\\kappa \\,</math> is a regular cardinal, then <math>\\{S \\subset \\kappa : \\exists C \\subset S \\text{ such that } C \\text{ is closed unbounded in } \\kappa\\} \\,</math> is a non-principal <math>\\kappa \\,</math>-complete [[filter (mathematics)|filter]] on <math>\\kappa \\,.</math>\n\nIf <math>\\kappa \\,</math> is a regular cardinal then club sets are also closed under [[diagonal intersection]].\n\nIn fact, if <math>\\kappa \\,</math> is regular and <math>\\mathcal{F} \\,</math> is any filter on <math>\\kappa \\,,</math> closed under diagonal intersection, containing all sets of the form <math>\\{\\xi < \\kappa : \\xi \\geq \\alpha\\} \\,</math> for <math>\\alpha < \\kappa \\,,</math> then <math>\\mathcal{F} \\,</math> must include all club sets.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Club filter]]\n*[[Stationary set]]\n*[[Clubsuit]]\n\n==References==\n* Jech, Thomas, 2003.

Consequently, they are not reachable from 0 via a finite series of applications of the chosen exponential map and of \"weaker\" operations like addition and multiplication.  The original epsilon numbers were introduced by [[Georg Cantor]] in the context of [[ordinal arithmetic]]; they are the [[ordinal numbers]] ε that satisfy the [[equation]]\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon = \\omega^\\varepsilon, \\, </math>\n\nin which ω is the smallest infinite ordinal.  \n\nThe least such ordinal is '''''ε''<sub>0</sub>''' (pronounced '''epsilon nought''' or '''epsilon zero'''), which can be viewed as the \"limit\" obtained by [[transfinite recursion]] from a sequence of smaller limit ordinals:\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_0 = \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^{\\cdot^{\\cdot^\\cdot}}}} = \\sup \\{ \\omega, \\omega^{\\omega}, \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega}}, \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}}, \\dots \\}</math>\n\nLarger ordinal fixed points of the exponential map are indexed by ordinal subscripts, resulting in <math>\\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2,\\ldots,\\varepsilon_\\omega, \\varepsilon_{\\omega+1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_0}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_1}, \\ldots, \\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_{\\cdot_{\\cdot_{\\cdot}}}}},\\ldots</math>.  The ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> is still [[countable]], as is any epsilon number whose index is countable (there exist uncountable ordinals, and uncountable epsilon numbers whose index is an uncountable ordinal).\n\nThe smallest epsilon number ε<sub>0</sub> appears in many [[mathematical induction|induction]] proofs, because for many purposes, [[transfinite induction]] is only required up to ε<sub>0</sub> (as in [[Gentzen's consistency proof]] and the proof of [[Goodstein's theorem]]).  Its use by [[Gentzen]] to prove the consistency of [[Peano arithmetic]], along with [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]], show that Peano arithmetic cannot prove the [[Well-founded relation|well-foundedness]] of this ordering (it is in fact the least ordinal with this property, and as such, in proof-theoretic [[ordinal analysis]], is used as a measure of the strength of the theory of Peano arithmetic).\n\nMany larger epsilon numbers can be defined using the [[Veblen function]].\n\nA more general class of epsilon numbers has been identified by [[John Horton Conway]] and [[Donald Knuth]] in the [[surreal number]] system, consisting of all surreals that are fixed points of the base ω exponential map ''x'' → ω<sup>''x''</sup>.\n\n{{harvtxt|Hessenberg|1906}} defined gamma numbers (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal]]) to be numbers γ>0 such that α+γ=γ whenever α<γ, and delta numbers (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable]]) to be numbers δ>1 such that  αδ=δ whenever 0<α<δ, and epsilon numbers to be numbers ε>2 such that  α<sup>ε</sup>=ε whenever 1<α<ε.

When <math>\\alpha = \\omega</math>, these fixed points are precisely the ordinal epsilon numbers.  The smallest of these, ε₀, is the supremum of the sequence\n:<math>0, \\omega^0 = 1, \\omega^1 = \\omega, \\omega^\\omega, \\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}, \\ldots, \\omega \\uparrow \\uparrow k, \\ldots</math>\n\nin which every element is the image of its predecessor under the mapping <math>\\beta \\mapsto \\omega^\\beta</math>.  (The general term is given using [[Knuth's up-arrow notation]]; the <math>\\uparrow \\uparrow</math> operator is equivalent to [[tetration]].)  Just as ω<sup>ω</sup> is defined as the supremum of { ω<sup>''k''</sup> } for natural numbers ''k'', the smallest ordinal epsilon number ε₀ may also be denoted <math>\\omega \\uparrow \\uparrow \\omega</math>; this notation is much less common than ε₀.\n\nThe next epsilon number after <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> is\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_1 = \\sup\\{\\varepsilon_0 + 1, \\omega^{\\varepsilon_0 + 1}, \\omega^{\\omega^{\\varepsilon_0 + 1}}, \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^{\\varepsilon_0 + 1}}}, \\dots\\},</math>\n\nin which the sequence is again constructed by repeated base ω exponentiation but starts at <math>\\varepsilon_0 + 1</math> instead of at 0.

The number <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> is the supremum of the set of epsilon numbers <math>\\{ \\varepsilon_\\beta, \\beta < \\alpha \\}</math>.  The first such number is <math>\\varepsilon_\\omega</math>.  Whether or not the index α is a limit ordinal, <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> is a fixed point not only of base ω exponentiation but also of base γ exponentiation for all ordinals <math>1 < \\gamma < \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math>.\n\nSince the epsilon numbers are an unbounded subclass of the ordinal numbers, they are enumerated using the ordinal numbers themselves.  For any ordinal number <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> is the least epsilon number (fixed point of the exponential map) not already in the set <math>\\{ \\varepsilon_\\beta, \\beta < \\alpha \\}</math>. It might appear that this is the non-constructive equivalent of the constructive definition using iterated exponentiation; but the two definitions are equally non-constructive at steps indexed by limit ordinals, which represent transfinite recursion of a higher order than taking the supremum of an exponential series.\n\nThe following facts about epsilon numbers are very straightforward to prove:\n* Although it is quite a large number, <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> is still [[countable]], being a countable union of countable ordinals; in fact, <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> is countable if and only if <math>\\alpha</math> is countable.\n* The union (or supremum) of any nonempty set of epsilon numbers is an epsilon number; so for instance\n::<math>\\varepsilon_\\omega = \\sup\\{\\varepsilon_0, \\varepsilon_1, \\varepsilon_2, \\ldots\\}</math>\n: is an epsilon number.  Thus, the mapping <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> is a normal function.\n* The [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal]] of any [[uncountable set|uncountable]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] is an epsilon number.\n::<math>\\alpha \\ge 1 \\Rightarrow \\varepsilon_{\\omega_{\\alpha}} = \\omega_{\\alpha} \\,.</math>\n\n== Representation of <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> by rooted trees ==\n\nAny epsilon number ε has [[Cantor normal form]] <math>\\varepsilon =\\omega ^{\\varepsilon }</math>, which means that the Cantor normal form is not very useful for epsilon numbers. The ordinals less than ε<sub>0</sub>, however, can be usefully described by their Cantor normal forms, which leads to a representation of ε<sub>0</sub> as the ordered set of all [[Tree (graph theory)#Rooted tree|finite rooted trees]], as follows.  Any ordinal <math>\\alpha<\\epsilon_0</math> has Cantor normal form <math>\\alpha=\\omega^{\\beta_1}+\\omega^{\\beta_2}+\\cdots+\\omega^{\\beta_k}</math> where ''k'' is a natural number and <math>\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k</math>  are ordinals with <math>\\alpha>\\beta_1\\geq\\cdots\\geq\\beta_k</math>, uniquely determined by <math>\\alpha</math>. Each of the ordinals <math>\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k</math> in turn has a similar Cantor normal form. We obtain the finite rooted tree representing α by joining the roots of the trees representing <math>\\beta_1,\\ldots,\\beta_k</math> to a new root. (This has the consequence that the number 0 is represented by a single root while the number <math>1=\\omega^0</math> is represented by a tree containing a root and a single leaf.) An order on the set of finite rooted trees is defined recursively: we first order the subtrees joined to the root in decreasing order, and then use [[Lexicographical order|lexicographic order]] on these ordered sequences of subtrees. In this way the set of all finite rooted trees becomes a [[Well-order|well-ordered set]] which is order-isomorphic to ε<sub>0</sub>.\n\n==Veblen hierarchy==\n{{Main|Veblen function}}\nThe fixed points of the \"epsilon mapping\" <math>x \\mapsto \\varepsilon_x</math> form a normal function, whose fixed points form a normal function, whose …; this is known as the [[Veblen function|Veblen hierarchy]] (the Veblen functions with base φ<sub>0</sub>(α)&nbsp;=&nbsp;ω<sup>α</sup>).  In the notation of the Veblen hierarchy, the epsilon mapping is φ<sub>1</sub>, and its fixed points are enumerated by φ<sub>2</sub>.\n\nContinuing in this vein, one can define maps φ<sub>α</sub> for progressively larger ordinals α (including, by this rarefied form of transfinite recursion, limit ordinals), with progressively larger least fixed points φ<sub>α+1</sub>(0).  The least ordinal not reachable from 0 by this procedure—i. e., the least ordinal α for which φ<sub>α</sub>(0)=α, or equivalently the first fixed point of the map <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\varphi_\\alpha(0)</math>—is the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] Γ<sub>0</sub>.  In a set theory where such an ordinal can be proven to exist, one has a map Γ that enumerates the fixed points Γ<sub>0</sub>, Γ<sub>1</sub>, Γ<sub>2</sub>, ... of <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\varphi_\\alpha(0)</math>; these are all still epsilon numbers, as they lie in the image of φ<sub>β</sub> for every β ≤ Γ<sub>0</sub>, including of the map φ<sub>1</sub> that enumerates epsilon numbers.\n\n== Surreal ε numbers ==\n\nIn ''[[On Numbers and Games]]'', the classic exposition on [[surreal number]]s, [[John Horton Conway]] provided a number of examples of concepts that had natural extensions from the ordinals to the surreals.  One such function is the [[surreal number#Powers of ω|<math>\\omega</math>-map]] <math>n \\mapsto \\omega^n</math>; this mapping generalises naturally to include all surreal numbers in its [[domain of a function|domain]], which in turn provides a natural generalisation of the [[ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] for surreal numbers.\n\nIt is natural to consider any fixed point of this expanded map to be an epsilon number, whether or not it happens to be strictly an ordinal number.  Some examples of non-ordinal epsilon numbers are\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_{-1} = \\{0, 1, \\omega, \\omega^\\omega, \\ldots \\mid \\varepsilon_0 - 1, \\omega^{\\varepsilon_0 - 1}, \\ldots\\}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\{\\varepsilon_0 + 1, \\omega^{\\varepsilon_0 + 1}, \\ldots \\mid \\varepsilon_1 - 1, \\omega^{\\varepsilon_1 - 1}, \\ldots\\}.</math>\n\nThere is a natural way to define <math>\\varepsilon_n</math> for every surreal number ''n'', and the map remains order-preserving.  Conway goes on to define a broader class of \"irreducible\" surreal numbers that includes the epsilon numbers as a particularly-interesting subclass.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ordinal arithmetic]]\n*[[Large countable ordinal]]\n\n==References==\n* J.H.

It is the [[supremum]] (least upper bound) of all countable ordinals. The elements of ω<sub>1</sub> are the countable ordinals, of which there are uncountably many.\n\nLike any ordinal number (in von Neumann's approach), ω<sub>1</sub> is a [[well-order|well-ordered set]], with [[set membership]] (\"&isin;\") serving as the order relation. ω<sub>1</sub> is a [[limit ordinal]], i.e. there is no ordinal α with α&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;ω<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set ω<sub>1</sub> is the first uncountable [[cardinal number]], ℵ<sub>1</sub> ([[aleph-one]]).

      "text": "The '''fixed-point lemma for normal functions''' is a basic result in [[axiomatic set theory]] stating that any [[normal function]] has arbitrarily large [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s (Levy 1979: p.&nbsp;117). It was first proved by [[Oswald Veblen]] in 1908.\n\n== Background and formal statement ==\nA [[normal function]] is a [[proper class|class]] function ''f'' from the class Ord of [[ordinal numbers]] to itself such that:\n* ''f'' is '''strictly increasing''': ''f''(α) < f(β) whenever α < β.\n* ''f'' is '''continuous''': for every limit ordinal λ (i.e. λ is neither zero nor a successor), ''f''(λ) = sup { f(α) : α < λ }.\nIt can be shown that if ''f'' is normal then ''f'' commutes with [[supremum|suprema]]; for any nonempty set ''A'' of ordinals,\n:''f''(sup ''A'') = sup {''f''(&alpha;) : &alpha; ∈ ''A'' }.\nIndeed, if sup ''A'' is a successor ordinal then sup ''A'' is an element of ''A'' and the equality follows from the increasing property of ''f''. If sup ''A'' is a limit ordinal then the equality follows from the continuous property of ''f''.\n\nA '''fixed point''' of a normal function is an ordinal β such that ''f''(β) = β.\n\nThe fixed point lemma states that the class of fixed points of any normal function is nonempty and in fact is unbounded: given any ordinal α, there exists an ordinal β such that β ≥ α and ''f''(β) = β.\n\nThe continuity of the normal function implies the class of fixed points is closed (the supremum of any subset of the class of fixed points is again a fixed point). Thus the fixed point lemma is equivalent to the statement that the fixed points of a normal function form a [[club set|closed and unbounded]] class.\n\n== Proof ==\nThe first step of the proof is to verify that ''f''(γ) ≥ γ for all ordinals γ and that ''f'' commutes with suprema. Given these results, inductively define an increasing sequence &lt;α<sub>''n''</sub>&gt; (''n'' &lt; ω) by setting α<sub>0</sub> = α, and α<sub>''n''+1</sub> = ''f''(α<sub>''n''</sub>) for ''n'' ∈ ω. Let β = sup {α<sub>''n''</sub> : ''n'' ∈ ω}, so β ≥ α. Moreover, because ''f'' commutes with suprema,  \n:''f''(β) = ''f''(sup {α<sub>''n''</sub> : ''n'' &lt; ω}) \n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = sup {''f''(α<sub>''n''</sub>) : ''n'' &lt; ω} \n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = sup {α<sub>''n''+1</sub> : ''n'' &lt; ω} \n:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = β.\nThe last equality follows from the fact that the sequence &lt;α<sub>''n''</sub>&gt; increases.  <math> \\square </math>\n\nAs an aside, it can be demonstrated that the β found in this way is the smallest fixed point greater than or equal to α.\n\n== Example application ==\nThe function ''f'' : Ord → Ord, ''f''(α) = ω<sub>α</sub> is normal (see [[initial ordinal]]). Thus, there exists an ordinal θ such that θ = ω<sub>θ</sub>. In fact, the lemma shows that there is a closed, unbounded class of such θ.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | author = Levy, A.\n | title = Basic Set Theory\n | year = 1979\n | publisher = Springer\n | id= Republished, Dover, 2002. \n | isbn = 978-0-387-08417-6}}\n*{{cite journal\n | author= Veblen, O.\n | authorlink = Oswald Veblen\n | title = Continuous increasing functions of finite and transfinite ordinals\n | journal = Trans.

It contains [[ordinal notation]]s for every [[recursive ordinal]], that is, ordinals below [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], <math>\\omega_1^{CK}</math>. Since <math>\\omega_1^{CK}</math> is the first ordinal not representable in a computable system of ordinal notations the elements of <math>\\mathcal{O}</math> can be regarded as the canonical ordinal notations. \n\nKleene (1938) described a system of notation for all recursive ordinals (those less than the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]]). It uses a subset of the [[natural number]]s instead of finite strings of symbols. Unfortunately, there is in general no [[computable function|effective]] way to tell whether some natural number represents an ordinal, or whether two numbers represent the same ordinal. However, one can effectively find notations which represent the ordinal sum, product, and power (see [[ordinal arithmetic]]) of any two given notations in Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>; and given any notation for an ordinal, there is a [[recursively enumerable set]] of notations which contains one element for each smaller ordinal and is effectively ordered.\n\n== Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math> ==\n\nThe basic idea of Kleene's system of ordinal notations is to build up ordinals in an effective manner.

Since there are only countably many recursive functions, the ordinal <math>\\omega^{CK}_1</math> is evidently countable.\n* The ordinals with a notation in Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math> are exactly the [[recursive ordinal]]s. (The fact that every recursive ordinal has a notation follows from the closure of this system of ordinal notations under successor and effective limits.)\n* <math> <_\\mathcal{O} </math> is not [[Recursively enumerable set|recursively enumerable]], but there is a recursively enumerable relation which agrees with <math> <_\\mathcal{O} </math> precisely on members of <math>\\mathcal{O} </math>.\n* For any notation <math> p </math>, the set <math>\\lbrace q \\mid q <_{\\mathcal{O}} p \\rbrace </math> of notations below <math> p </math> is recursively enumerable.

It follows by remarks above that every element <math> p </math> of <math> \\mathcal{O} </math> determines a non-maximal path <math> \\mathcal{P} </math>; and every non-maximal path is so determined.\n* There are <math> 2^{\\aleph_0} </math> maximal paths through <math> \\mathcal{O} </math>; since they are maximal, they are non-r.e.\n* In fact, there are <math> 2^{\\aleph_0} </math> maximal paths ''within'' <math> \\mathcal{O} </math> of length <math> \\omega^2 </math>. (Crossley, Schütte)\n* For every non-zero ordinal <math> \\lambda < \\omega_1^{CK} </math>, there are <math> 2^{\\aleph_0} </math> maximal paths within <math> \\mathcal{O} </math> of length <math> \\omega^2 \\cdot \\lambda </math>. (Aczel)\n* Further, if <math> \\mathcal{P} </math> is a path whose length is ''not'' a multiple of <math> \\omega^2 </math> then <math> \\mathcal{P} </math> is not maximal. (Aczel)\n* For each r.e. degree <math> d </math>, there is a member <math> e_d </math> of <math> \\mathcal{O} </math> such that the path <math> \\mathcal{P} =  \\lbrace p \\mid p <_{\\mathcal{O}} e_d \\rbrace </math> has many-one degree <math> d </math>. In fact, for each recursive ordinal <math> \\alpha \\geq \\omega^2 </math>, a notation <math> e_d </math> exists with <math> |e_d| = \\alpha </math>. (Jockusch)\n* There exist <math> \\aleph_0 </math> paths through <math> \\mathcal{O} </math> which are <math>\\Pi_1^1 </math>. Given a progression of recursively enumerable theories based on iterating Uniform Reflection, each such path is incomplete with respect to the set of true <math> \\Pi_1^0 </math> sentences.

      "text": "{{main|Ordinal number}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2019}}\nIn the mathematical discipline of [[set theory]], there are many ways of describing specific [[countable set|countable]] [[ordinal number|ordinals]]. The smallest ones can be usefully and non-circularly expressed in terms of their [[Cantor normal form]]s. Beyond that, many ordinals of relevance to [[proof theory]] still have [[computable function|computable]] [[ordinal notation]]s. However, it is not possible to decide effectively whether a given putative ordinal notation is a notation or not (for reasons somewhat analogous to the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]]); various more-concrete ways of defining ordinals that definitely have notations are available.\n\nSince there are only countably many notations, all ordinals with notations are exhausted well below the [[first uncountable ordinal|first uncountable ordinal ω<sub>1</sub>]]; their [[supremum]] is called '''''Church–Kleene ω<sub>1</sub>''''' or ω<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup> (not to be confused with the first uncountable ordinal, ω<sub>1</sub>), described [[#The Church–Kleene ordinal|below]]. Ordinal numbers below ω<sub>1</sub><sup>CK</sup> are the '''recursive''' ordinals (see [[#Generalities on recursive ordinals|below]]). Countable ordinals larger than this may still be defined, but do not have notations.\n\nDue to the focus on countable ordinals, [[ordinal arithmetic]] is used throughout, except where otherwise noted.  The ordinals described here are not as large as the ones described in [[large cardinals]], but they are large among those that have constructive notations (descriptions).  Larger and larger ordinals can be defined, but they become more and more difficult to describe.\n\n== Generalities on recursive ordinals ==\n{{Main|Recursive ordinal}}\n\n=== Ordinal notations ===\n\n{{Main|Ordinal notation}}\n\n[[Recursive ordinal]]s (or computable ordinals) are certain countable ordinals: loosely speaking those represented by a [[computable function]].  There are several equivalent definitions of this: the simplest is to say that a computable ordinal is the order-type of some recursive (i.e., computable) well-ordering of the natural numbers; so, essentially, an ordinal is recursive when we can present the set of smaller ordinals in such a way that a computer ([[Turing machine]], say) can manipulate them (and, essentially, compare them).\n\n<!-- Consider the following as a sort of stub for a yet-to-be-written article on \"ordinal notations\"... -->\nA different definition uses [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s system of [[ordinal notation]]s. Briefly, an ordinal notation is either the name zero (describing the ordinal 0), or the successor of an ordinal notation (describing the successor of the ordinal described by that notation), or a Turing machine (computable function) that produces an increasing sequence of ordinal notations (that describe the ordinal that is the limit of the sequence), and ordinal notations are (partially) ordered so as to make the successor of ''o'' greater than ''o'' and to make the limit greater than any term of the sequence (this order is computable; however, the set '''O''' of ordinal notations itself is highly non-recursive, owing to the impossibility of deciding whether a given Turing machine does indeed produce a sequence of notations); a recursive ordinal is then an ordinal described by some ordinal notation.\n\nAny ordinal smaller than a recursive ordinal is itself recursive, so the set of all recursive ordinals forms a certain (countable) ordinal, the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]] (see below).\n\nIt is tempting to forget about ordinal notations, and only speak of the recursive ordinals themselves: and some statements are made about recursive ordinals which, in fact, concern the notations for these ordinals.  This leads to difficulties, however, as even the smallest infinite ordinal, ω, has many notations, some of which cannot be proved to be equivalent to the obvious notation (the limit of the simplest program that enumerates all natural numbers).\n\n=== Relationship to systems of arithmetic ===\n\nThere is a relation between computable ordinals and certain [[formal system]]s (containing [[arithmetic]], that is, at least a reasonable fragment of [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]).\n\nCertain computable ordinals are so large that while they can be given by a certain ordinal notation ''o'', a given formal system might not be sufficiently powerful to show that ''o'' is, indeed, an ordinal notation: the system does not show transfinite induction for such large ordinals.\n\nFor example, the usual [[First-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano axioms]] do not prove transfinite induction for (or beyond) ε<sub>0</sub>: while the ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> can easily be arithmetically described (it is countable), the Peano axioms are not strong enough to show that it is indeed an ordinal; in fact, transfinite induction on ε<sub>0</sub> proves the consistency of Peano's axioms (a theorem by [[Gerhard Gentzen|Gentzen]]), so by [[Gödel's second incompleteness theorem]], Peano's axioms cannot formalize that reasoning.  (This is at the basis of the [[Kirby–Paris theorem]] on [[Goodstein's theorem|Goodstein sequences]].)  We say that ε<sub>0</sub> measures the [[proof-theoretic strength]] of Peano's axioms.\n\nBut we can do this for systems far beyond Peano's axioms.  For example, the proof-theoretic strength of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] is the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]], and, in fact, merely adding to Peano's axioms the axioms that state the well-ordering of all ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal is sufficient to obtain all arithmetical consequences of Kripke–Platek set theory.\n\n== Specific recursive ordinals ==\n\n=== Predicative definitions and the Veblen hierarchy ===\n{{main|Veblen function}}\nWe have already mentioned (see  [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]]) the ordinal [[epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε<sub>0</sub>]], which is the smallest satisfying the equation <math>\\omega^\\alpha = \\alpha</math>, so it is the limit of the sequence 0, 1, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>, etc.  The next ordinal satisfying this equation is called ε<sub>1</sub>: it is the limit of the sequence\n\n:<math>\\varepsilon_0+1, \\qquad \\omega^{\\varepsilon_0+1}=\\varepsilon_0\\cdot\\omega,\\qquad\\omega^{\\omega^{\\varepsilon_0+1}}=(\\varepsilon_0)^\\omega,\\qquad\\text{etc.}</math>\n\nMore generally, the <math>\\iota</math>-th ordinal such that <math>\\omega^\\alpha = \\alpha</math> is called <math>\\varepsilon_\\iota</math>.  We could define <math>\\zeta_0</math> as the smallest ordinal such that <math>\\varepsilon_\\alpha=\\alpha</math>, but since the Greek alphabet does not have transfinitely many letters it is better to use a more robust notation: define ordinals <math>\\varphi_\\gamma(\\beta)</math> by transfinite induction as follows: let <math>\\varphi_0(\\beta) = \\omega^\\beta</math> and let <math>\\varphi_{\\gamma+1}(\\beta)</math> be the <math>\\beta</math>-th fixed point of <math>\\varphi_\\gamma</math> (i.e., the <math>\\beta</math>-th ordinal such that <math>\\varphi_\\gamma(\\alpha)=\\alpha</math>; so for example, <math>\\varphi_1(\\beta) = \\varepsilon_\\beta</math>), and when <math>\\delta</math> is a limit ordinal, define <math>\\varphi_\\delta(\\alpha)</math> as the <math>\\alpha</math>-th common fixed point of the <math>\\varphi_\\gamma</math> for all <math>\\gamma<\\delta</math>.  This family of functions is known as the '''[[Veblen hierarchy]]'''  (there are inessential variations in the definition, such as letting, for <math>\\delta</math> a limit ordinal, <math>\\varphi_\\delta(\\alpha)</math> be the limit of the <math>\\varphi_\\gamma(\\alpha)</math> for <math>\\gamma<\\delta</math>: this essentially just shifts the indices by 1, which is harmless). <math>\\varphi_\\gamma</math> is called the <math>\\gamma^{th}</math> '''[[Veblen function]]''' (to the base <math>\\omega</math>).\n\nOrdering: <math>\\varphi_\\alpha(\\beta) < \\varphi_\\gamma(\\delta)</math> if and only if either (<math>\\alpha = \\gamma</math> and <math>\\beta < \\delta</math>) or (<math>\\alpha < \\gamma</math> and <math>\\beta < \\varphi_\\gamma(\\delta)</math>) or (<math>\\alpha > \\gamma</math> and <math>\\varphi_\\alpha(\\beta) < \\delta</math>).\n\n=== The Feferman–Schütte ordinal and beyond ===\n\nThe smallest ordinal such that <math>\\varphi_\\alpha(0) = \\alpha</math> is known as the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]] and generally written <math>\\Gamma_0</math>.  It can be described as the set of all ordinals that can be written as finite expressions, starting from zero, using only the Veblen hierarchy and addition.  The Feferman–Schütte ordinal is important because, in a sense that is complicated to make precise, it is the smallest (infinite) ordinal that cannot be (“[[impredicative|predicatively]]”) described using smaller ordinals.  It measures the strength of such systems as “[[Reverse mathematics#Arithmetical transfinite recursion ATR0|arithmetical transfinite recursion]]”.\n\nMore generally, Γ<sub>α</sub> enumerates the ordinals that cannot be obtained from smaller ordinals using addition and the Veblen functions.\n\nIt is, of course, possible to describe ordinals beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.  One could continue to seek fixed points in more and more complicated manner: enumerate the fixed points of <math>\\alpha\\mapsto\\Gamma_\\alpha</math>, then enumerate the fixed points of ''that'', and so on, and then look for the first ordinal α such that α is obtained in α steps of this process, and continue diagonalizing in this ''ad hoc'' manner.  This leads to the definition of the “[[small Veblen ordinal|small]]” and “[[large Veblen ordinal|large]]” Veblen ordinals.\n\n=== Impredicative ordinals ===\n{{main|Ordinal collapsing function}}\n\nTo go far beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, one needs to introduce new methods.  Unfortunately there is not yet any standard way to do this: every author in the subject seems to have invented their own system of notation, and it is quite hard to translate between the different systems. The first such system was introduced by Bachmann in 1950 (in an ''ad hoc'' manner), and different extensions and variations of it were described by Buchholz, Takeuti (ordinal diagrams), Feferman (θ systems), Aczel, Bridge, Schütte, and Pohlers. However most systems use the same basic idea, of constructing new countable ordinals by using the existence of certain uncountable ordinals.  Here is an example of such a definition, described in much greater detail in the article on [[ordinal collapsing function]]:\n*ψ(α) is defined to be the smallest ordinal that cannot be constructed by starting with 0, 1, ω and Ω, and repeatedly applying addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and ψ to previously constructed ordinals (except that ψ can only be applied to arguments  less than α, to ensure that it is well defined).\nHere Ω = ω<sub>1</sub> is the first uncountable ordinal. It is put in because otherwise the function ψ gets \"stuck\" at the smallest ordinal σ such that ε<sub>σ</sub>=σ: in particular ψ(α)=σ for any ordinal α satisfying σ≤α≤Ω. However the fact that we included Ω allows us to get past this point: ψ(Ω+1) is greater than σ. The key property of Ω that we used is that it is greater than any ordinal produced by ψ.\n\nTo construct still larger ordinals, we can extend the definition of ψ by throwing in  more ways of constructing uncountable ordinals. There are several ways to do this, described to some extent in the article on [[ordinal collapsing function]].\n\nThe '''[[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]''' (sometimes just called the '''Howard ordinal''', ψ(ε<sub>Ω+1</sub>) with the notation above) is an important one, because it describes the proof-theoretic strength of [[Kripke–Platek set theory]].  Indeed, the main importance of these large ordinals, and the reason to describe them, is their relation to certain formal systems as explained above.  However, such powerful formal systems as full [[second-order arithmetic]], let alone [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], seem beyond reach for the moment.\n\n=== &ldquo;Unrecursable&rdquo; recursive ordinals ===\n\nBy dropping the requirement of having a useful description, even larger recursive countable ordinals can be obtained as the ordinals measuring the strengths of various strong theories; roughly speaking, these ordinals are the smallest ordinals that the theories cannot prove are well ordered. By taking stronger and stronger theories such as [[second-order arithmetic]], [[Zermelo set theory]], [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], or Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with various [[large cardinal]] axioms, one gets some extremely large recursive ordinals.  (Strictly speaking it is not known that all of these really are ordinals: by construction, the ordinal strength of a theory can only be proved to be an ordinal from an even stronger theory.  So for the large cardinal axioms this becomes quite unclear.)\n\n== Beyond recursive ordinals ==\n\n<!-- This section should be much expanded, perhaps made into a separate article, because the present view is unbalanced: most of the article deals with recursive ordinals, and other large countable ordinals seem to be a kind of afterthought. -->\n\n=== The Church–Kleene ordinal ===\n\nThe set of [[recursive ordinal]]s is an ordinal that is the smallest ordinal that ''cannot'' be described in a recursive way. (It is not the order type of any recursive well-ordering of the integers.) That ordinal is a countable ordinal called the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math>. Thus, <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math> is the smallest non-recursive ordinal, and there is no hope of precisely “describing” any ordinals from this point on&mdash;we can only ''define'' them. But it is still far less than the first uncountable ordinal, <math>\\omega_1</math>. However, as its symbol suggests, it behaves in many ways rather like <math>\\omega_1</math>. {{such as?|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== Admissible ordinals ===\n{{main|Admissible ordinal}}\n\nThe Church–Kleene ordinal is again related to [[Kripke–Platek set theory]], but now in a different way: whereas the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (described [[#Impredicative ordinals|above]]) was the smallest ordinal for which KP does not prove transfinite induction, the Church–Kleene ordinal is the smallest α such that the construction of the [[Constructible universe|Gödel universe]], ''L'', up to stage α, yields a model <math>L_\\alpha</math> of KP. Such ordinals are called '''admissible''', thus <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math> is the smallest admissible ordinal (beyond ω in case the axiom of infinity is not included in KP).\n\nBy a theorem of [[Gerald Sacks|Sacks]], the countable admissible ordinals are exactly those constructed in a manner similar to the Church–Kleene ordinal but for Turing machines with [[Oracle machine|oracles]].  One sometimes writes <math>\\omega_\\alpha^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math> for the <math>\\alpha</math>-th ordinal that is either admissible or a limit of admissible.\n\n=== Beyond admissible ordinals ===\n\nAn ordinal that is both admissible and a limit of admissibles, or equivalently such that <math>\\alpha</math> is the <math>\\alpha</math>-th admissible ordinal, is called ''recursively inaccessible''.  There exists a theory of large ordinals in this manner that is highly parallel to that of (small) [[large cardinal property|large cardinals]].  For example, we can define recursively ''Mahlo ordinals'': these are the <math>\\alpha</math> such that every <math>\\alpha</math>-recursive closed unbounded subset of <math>\\alpha</math> contains an admissible ordinal (a recursive analog of the definition of a [[Mahlo cardinal]]).  But note that we are still talking about possibly countable ordinals here. (While the existence of inaccessible or Mahlo cardinals cannot be proved in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], that of recursively inaccessible or recursively Mahlo ordinals is a theorem of ZFC: in fact, any [[regular cardinal]] is recursively Mahlo and more, but even if we limit ourselves to countable ordinals, ZFC proves the existence of recursively Mahlo ordinals.  They are, however, beyond the reach of Kripke–Platek set theory.)\n\nAn admissible ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> is called ''nonprojectible'' if there is no total <math>\\alpha</math>-recursive injective function mapping <math>\\alpha</math> into a smaller ordinal.  (This is trivially true for regular cardinals; however, we are mainly interested in countable ordinals.)  Being nonprojectible is a much stronger condition than being admissible, recursively inaccessible, or even recursively Mahlo.  It is equivalent to the statement that the [[Constructible universe|Gödel universe]], ''L'', up to stage α, yields a model <math>L_\\alpha</math> of KP + <math>\\Sigma_1</math>-separation.\n\n=== &ldquo;Unprovable&rdquo; ordinals ===\n\nWe can imagine even larger ordinals that are still countable. For example, if [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] has a [[transitive model]] (a hypothesis stronger than the mere hypothesis of consistency, and implied by the existence of an inaccessible cardinal), then there exists a countable <math>\\alpha</math> such that <math>L_\\alpha</math> is a model of ZFC.  Such ordinals are beyond the strength of ZFC in the sense that it cannot (by construction) prove their existence.\n\nEven larger countable ordinals, called the ''[[stable ordinal]]s'', can be defined by indescribability conditions or as those <math>\\alpha</math> such that <math>L_\\alpha</math> is a [[elementary equivalence|1-elementary submodel]] of ''L''; the existence of these ordinals can be proved in ZFC,<ref>Barwise (1976), theorem 7.2.</ref> and they are closely related to the [[nonprojectible ordinal]]s.\n\n== A pseudo-well-ordering ==\n\nWithin the [[Kleene's O|scheme of notations of Kleene]] some represent ordinals and some do not. One can define a recursive total ordering that is a subset of the Kleene notations and has an initial segment which is well-ordered with order-type <math>\\omega_1^{\\mathrm{CK}}</math>. Every recursively enumerable (or even hyperarithmetic) nonempty subset of this total ordering has a least element.  So it resembles a well-ordering in some respects.  For example, one can define the arithmetic operations on it.  Yet it is not possible to effectively determine exactly where the initial well-ordered part ends and the part lacking a least element begins.\n\nFor an example of a recursive pseudowellordering, let S be [[Reverse_mathematics#Arithmetical_transfinite_recursion_ATR0|ATR<sub>0</sub>]] or another recursively axiomatizable theory that has an ω-model but no hyperarithmetical ω-models, and (if needed) conservatively extend S with [[Skolem function]]s.  Let T be the tree of (essentially) finite partial ω-models of S: A sequence of natural numbers <math>x_1,x_2,...,x_n</math> is in T iff S plus ∃m φ(m) ⇒ φ(x<sub>⌈φ⌉</sub>) (for the first n formulas φ with one numeric free variable; ⌈φ⌉ is the Gödel number) has no inconsistency proof shorter than n.  Then the [[Kleene–Brouwer order]] of T is a recursive pseudowellordering.\n\n==References==\n\nMost books describing large countable ordinals are on proof theory, and unfortunately tend to be out of print.\n\n===On recursive ordinals===\n* [[Wolfram Pohlers]], ''Proof theory'', Springer 1989 {{isbn|0-387-51842-8}} (for Veblen hierarchy and some impredicative ordinals).

Each turn of the spiral represents one power of &omega;. Limit ordinals are those that are non-zero and have no predecessor, such as &omega; or &omega;<sup>2</sup> ]]\n\nIn [[set theory]], a '''limit ordinal''' is an [[ordinal number]] that is neither zero nor a [[successor ordinal]]. Alternatively, an ordinal λ is a limit ordinal if and only if there is an ordinal less than λ, and whenever β is an ordinal less than λ, then there exists an ordinal γ such that β < γ < λ. Every ordinal number is either zero, or a successor ordinal, or a limit ordinal.\n\nFor example, [[ω (ordinal number)|ω]], the smallest ordinal greater than every [[natural number]] is a limit ordinal because for any smaller ordinal (i.e., for any natural number) ''n'' we can find another natural number larger than it (e.g. ''n''+1), but still less than ω.\n\nUsing the [[Von Neumann definition of ordinals]], every ordinal is the [[well-ordered set]] of all smaller ordinals. The union of a nonempty set of ordinals that has no [[greatest element]] is then always a limit ordinal. Using [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]], every infinite [[cardinal number]] is also a limit ordinal.\n\n==Alternative definitions==\nVarious other ways to define limit ordinals are:\n*It is equal to the [[supremum]] of all the ordinals below it, but is not zero.  (Compare with a successor ordinal: the set of ordinals below it has a maximum, so the supremum is this maximum, the previous ordinal.)\n*It is not zero and has no maximum element.\n*It can be written in the form ωα for α > 0. That is, in the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] there is no finite number as last term, and the ordinal is nonzero.\n*It is a [[limit point]] of the class of ordinal numbers, with respect to the [[order topology]]. (The other ordinals are [[isolated point]]s.)\n\nSome contention exists on whether or not 0 should be classified as a limit ordinal, as it does not have an immediate predecessor; \nsome textbooks include 0 in the class of limit ordinals<ref>for example, Thomas Jech, ''Set Theory''. Third Millennium edition. Springer.</ref> while others exclude it.<ref>for example, Kenneth Kunen, ''Set Theory. An introduction to independence proofs''. North-Holland.</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nBecause the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of ordinal numbers is [[well-order]]ed, there is a smallest infinite limit ordinal; denoted by ω (omega). The ordinal ω is also the smallest infinite ordinal (disregarding ''limit''), as it is the [[least upper bound]] of the [[natural numbers]]. Hence ω represents the [[order type]] of the natural numbers. The next limit ordinal above the first is ω + ω = ω·2, which generalizes to ω·''n'' for any natural number ''n''. Taking the [[union (set theory)|union]] (the [[supremum]] operation on any [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of ordinals) of all the ω·n, we get ω·ω = ω<sup>2</sup>, which generalizes to ω<sup>''n''</sup> for any natural number ''n''. This process can be further iterated as follows to produce:\n\n:<math>\\omega^3, \\omega^4, \\ldots, \\omega^\\omega, \\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}, \\ldots, \\epsilon_0 = \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^{~\\cdot^{~\\cdot^{~\\cdot}}}}}, \\ldots</math>\n\nIn general, all of these recursive definitions via multiplication, exponentiation, repeated exponentiation, etc. yield limit ordinals. All of the ordinals discussed so far are still [[countable]] ordinals. However, there is no [[recursively enumerable]] scheme for [[ordinal notation|systematically naming]] all ordinals less than the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]], which is a countable ordinal.\n\nBeyond the countable, the [[first uncountable ordinal]] is usually denoted ω<sub>1</sub>.  It is also a limit ordinal.\n\nContinuing, one can obtain the following (all of which are now increasing in cardinality):\n\n:<math>\\omega_2, \\omega_3, \\ldots, \\omega_\\omega, \\omega_{\\omega + 1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{\\omega_\\omega},\\ldots</math>\n\nIn general, we always get a limit ordinal when taking the union of a nonempty set of ordinals that has no [[maximum]] element.\n\nThe ordinals of the form ω²α, for α > 0, are limits of limits, etc.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe classes of successor ordinals and limit ordinals (of various [[cofinality|cofinalities]]) as well as zero exhaust the entire class of ordinals, so these cases are often used in proofs by [[transfinite induction]] or definitions by [[transfinite recursion]]. Limit ordinals represent a sort of \"turning point\" in such procedures, in which one must use limiting operations such as taking the union over all preceding ordinals.  In principle, one could do anything at limit ordinals, but taking the union is [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] in the order topology and this is usually desirable.\n\nIf we use the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]], every infinite [[cardinal number]] is also a limit ordinal (and this is a fitting observation, as ''cardinal'' derives from the Latin ''cardo'' meaning ''hinge'' or ''turning point''): the proof of this fact is done by simply showing that every infinite successor ordinal is [[equinumerous]] to a limit ordinal via the [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel|Hotel Infinity]] argument.\n\nCardinal numbers have their own notion of successorship and limit (everything getting upgraded to a higher level).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Ordinal arithmetic]]\n*[[Limit cardinal]]\n*[[Fundamental sequence (ordinals)]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Georg Cantor|Cantor, G.]], (1897), ''Beitrage zur Begrundung der transfiniten Mengenlehre.

      "text": "{{short description|Isomorphism type of ordered sets}}\n{{distinguish|text=[[Ordered type system|ordered types]]}}\nIn [[mathematics]], especially in [[set theory]], two [[ordered set]]s {{mvar|X}} and {{mvar|Y}} are said to have the same '''order type''' if they are [[order isomorphic]], that is, if there exists a [[bijection]] (each element matches exactly one in the other set) <math>f\\colon X \\to Y</math> such that both {{mvar|f}} and its inverse are [[Monotonic#Monotonicity in order theory|monotonic]] (preserving orders of elements). In the special case when {{mvar|X}} is [[totally ordered]], monotonicity of {{mvar|f}} implies monotonicity of its inverse.\n\nFor example, the set of integers and the set of even integers have the same order type, because the mapping <math>n\\mapsto 2n</math> is a bijection that preserves the order.  But the set of integers and the set of rational numbers (with the standard ordering) do not have the same order type, because even though the sets are of the same [[Cardinality|size]] (they are both [[Countable set|countably infinite]]), there is no order-preserving bijective mapping between them.  To these two order types we may add two more: the set of positive integers (which has a least element), and that of negative integers (which has a greatest element).  The open interval {{math|(0, 1)}} of rationals is order isomorphic to the rationals (since, for example, <math>f(x) = \\tfrac{2x - 1}{1 - \\vert {2x - 1} \\vert}</math> is a strictly increasing bijection from the former to the latter); the rationals contained in the half-closed intervals [0,1) and (0,1], and the closed interval [0,1], are three additional order type examples.\n\nSince order-equivalence is an [[equivalence relation]], it partitions the class of all ordered sets into equivalence classes.\n\n==Order type of well-orderings==\nEvery [[well-ordered set]] is order-equivalent to exactly one [[ordinal number (mathematics)|ordinal number]]. The ordinal numbers are taken to be the [[canonical form|canonical representatives]] of their classes, and so the order type of a well-ordered set is usually identified with the corresponding ordinal. For example, the order type of the natural numbers is [[ω (ordinal number)|{{mvar|ω}}]].\n\nThe order type of a well-ordered set {{mvar|V}} is sometimes expressed as {{math|ord(''V'')}}.<ref>[http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/ordinals.htm Ordinal Numbers and Their Arithmetic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nFor example, consider the set {{mvar|V}} of [[even ordinal]]s less than {{math|''ω'' &sdot; 2 + 7}}:\n\n:<math>V = \\{0,2,4,\\ldots;\\omega,\\omega + 2,\\omega + 4,\\ldots;\\omega\\cdot 2,\\omega\\cdot 2 + 2, \\omega\\cdot 2 + 4, \\omega\\cdot 2 + 6\\}.</math>\n\nIts order type is:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ord}(V) = \\omega\\cdot 2 + 4 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots; \\omega, \\omega+1, \\omega+2, \\ldots; \\omega\\cdot 2, \\omega\\cdot 2 + 1, \\omega\\cdot 2 + 2, \\omega\\cdot 2 + 3\\},</math>\n\nbecause there are 2 separate lists of counting and 4 in sequence at the end.\n\n==Rational numbers==\nAny countable totally ordered set can be mapped injectively into the rational numbers in an order-preserving way.\nAny [[dense order|dense]] countable totally ordered set with no highest and no lowest element can be mapped bijectively onto the rational numbers in an order-preserving way.\n\n== Notation ==\n\nThe order type of the [[Rational number|rationals]] is usually denoted <math>\\eta</math>.

      "text": "In the mathematical field of [[set theory]], '''ordinal arithmetic''' describes the three usual operations on [[ordinal number]]s: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit [[well-order|well-ordered set]] which represents the operation or by using [[transfinite recursion]]. Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals. In addition to these usual ordinal operations, there are also the [[#Natural operations|\"natural\" arithmetic of ordinals]] and the [[#Nimber arithmetic|nimber operations]].\n\n== Addition ==\n\nThe union of two disjoint well-ordered sets ''S'' and ''T'' can be well-ordered.  The [[order-type]] of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of ''S'' and ''T''.  If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace ''S'' by {0} × ''S'' and ''T'' by {1} × ''T''.  This way, the well-ordered set ''S'' is written \"to the left\" of the well-ordered set ''T'', meaning one defines an order on ''S'' <math>\\cup</math> ''T'' in which every element of ''S'' is smaller than every element of ''T''. The sets ''S'' and ''T'' themselves keep the ordering they already have. This addition of the order-types is [[associative]] and generalizes the addition of [[natural numbers]].\n\nThe first transfinite ordinal is ω, the set of all natural numbers.\nFor example, the ordinal ω + ω is obtained by two copies of the natural numbers ordered in the usual fashion and the second copy completely to the right of the first. Writing 0' < 1' < 2' < ... for the second copy, ω + ω looks like\n:0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2' < ...\nThis is different from ω because in ω only 0 does not have a direct predecessor while in ω + ω the two elements 0 and 0' do not have direct predecessors.\nAs another example, here are 3 + ω and ω + 3:\n:0 < 1 < 2 < 0' < 1' < 2' < ...\n:0 < 1 < 2 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2'\nAfter relabeling, the former just looks like ω itself, i.e. 3 + ω = ω, while the latter does not: {{nowrap|ω + 3}} is not equal to ω since {{nowrap|ω + 3}} has a largest element (namely, 2') and ω does not (even if ω and {{nowrap|ω + 3}} are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this addition is not [[commutative]]. In fact it is quite rare for α+β to be equal to β+α: this happens if and only if α=γ''m'', β=γ''n'' for some ordinal γ and natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. From this it follows that \"α commutes with β\" is an equivalence relation on the set of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\nHowever, addition is still associative; one can see for example that (ω + 4) + ω = ω + (4 + ω) = ω + ω.\n\nThe definition of addition can also be given [[Transfinite induction|inductively]] (the following induction is on ''β''):\n* ''α'' + 0 = ''α'',\n* ''α'' + (''β'' + 1) = (''α'' + ''β'') + 1 (here, \"+ 1\" denotes the ''[[Successor ordinal|successor]]'' of an ordinal),\n* and if ''β'' is a [[limit ordinal]] then ''α'' + ''β'' is the limit of the ''α'' + ''δ'' for all ''δ'' &lt; ''β''.\n\nUsing this definition, ω + 3 can be seen to be a [[successor ordinal]] (it is the successor of ω + 2), whereas 3 + ω is a [[limit ordinal]], namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just ω.\n\nZero is an additive identity ''α'' + 0 = 0 + ''α'' = ''α''.\n\nAddition is associative (''α'' + ''β'') + ''γ'' = ''α'' + (''β'' + ''γ'').\n\nAddition is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument:\n:<math>\\alpha < \\beta \\Rightarrow \\gamma + \\alpha < \\gamma + \\beta</math>\nbut the analogous relation does not hold for the left argument; instead we only have:\n:<math>\\alpha < \\beta \\Rightarrow \\alpha+\\gamma \\le \\beta+\\gamma</math>\n\nOrdinal addition is [[left-cancellative]]: if ''α'' + ''β'' = ''α'' + ''γ'', then ''β'' = ''γ''. Furthermore, one can define [[left division|left subtraction]] for ordinals ''β'' ≤ ''α'': there is a unique ''γ'' such that ''α'' = ''β'' + ''γ''.\nOn the other hand, right cancellation does not work:\n:<math>3+\\omega = 0+\\omega = \\omega</math> but <math>3 \\neq 0</math>\nNor does right subtraction, even when ''β'' ≤ ''α'': for example, there does not exist any ''γ'' such that ''γ'' + 42 = ω.\n\nIf the ordinals less than α are closed under addition and contain 0 then α is occasionally called a γ-number (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal]]). These are exactly the ordinals of the form ω<sup>β</sup>.\n\n== Multiplication ==\n\nThe [[Cartesian product]], ''S×T'', of two well-ordered sets ''S'' and ''T'' can be well-ordered by a variant of [[lexicographical order]] that puts the least significant position first.  Effectively, each element of ''T'' is replaced by a disjoint copy of ''S''. The order-type of the Cartesian product is the ordinal which results from multiplying the order-types of ''S'' and ''T''.  Again, this operation is associative and generalizes the multiplication of natural numbers.\n\nHere is ω·2:\n:0<sub>0</sub> < 1<sub>0</sub> < 2<sub>0</sub> < 3<sub>0</sub> < ... < 0<sub>1</sub> < 1<sub>1</sub> < 2<sub>1</sub> < 3<sub>1</sub> < ...\nwhich has the same order type as ω + ω. In contrast, 2·ω looks like this:\n:0<sub>0</sub> < 1<sub>0</sub> < 0<sub>1</sub> < 1<sub>1</sub> < 0<sub>2</sub> < 1<sub>2</sub> < 0<sub>3</sub> < 1<sub>3</sub> < ...\nand after relabeling, this looks just like ω.\nThus, ω·2 = ω+ω ≠ ω = 2·ω, showing that multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. More generally, a natural number greater than 1 never commutes with any infinite ordinal, and two infinite ordinals α, β commute if and only if α<sup>''m''</sup> = β<sup>''n''</sup> for some positive natural numbers ''m'' and ''n''. The relation \"α commutes with β\" is an equivalence relation on the ordinals greater than 1, and all equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\n[[Distributivity]] partially holds for ordinal arithmetic: ''R''(''S''+''T'') = ''RS''+''RT''. However, the other distributive law (''T''+''U'')''R'' = ''TR''+''UR'' is ''not'' generally true: (1+1)·ω = 2·ω = ω while 1·ω+1·ω = ω+ω which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left [[near-semiring]], but do ''not'' form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]].\n\nThe definition of multiplication can also be given inductively (the following induction is on ''β''):\n* ''α''·0 = 0,\n* ''α''·(''β''+1) = (''α''·''β'')+''α'',\n* and if ''β'' is a limit ordinal then ''α''·''β'' is the limit of the ''α''·''δ'' for ''δ'' &lt; ''β''.\n\nThe main properties of the product are:\n*''α''·0 = 0·''α'' = 0.\n*One (1) is a multiplicative identity ''α''·1 = 1·''α'' = ''α''.\n*Multiplication is associative (''α''·''β'')·''γ'' = ''α''·(''β''·''γ'').\n*Multiplication is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: (''α'' < ''β'' and ''γ'' > 0) <math>\\Rightarrow</math> ''γ''·''α'' < ''γ''·''β''\n*Multiplication is ''not'' strictly increasing in the left argument, for example, 1 < 2 but 1·ω = 2·ω = ω. However, it is (non-strictly) increasing, i.e. ''α'' ≤ ''β'' <math>\\Rightarrow</math> ''α''·''γ'' ≤ ''β''·''γ''.\n*There is a [[left-cancellative|left cancellation]] law:  If ''α'' > 0 and ''α''·''β'' = ''α''·''γ'', then ''β'' = ''γ''.\n*Right cancellation does not work, e.g. 1·ω = 2·ω = ω, but 1 and 2 are different.\n*''α''·''β'' = 0 <math>\\Rightarrow</math> ''α'' = 0 or ''β'' = 0.\n*Distributive law on the left: ''α''·(''β''+''γ'') = ''α''·''β''+''α''·''γ''\n*No distributive law on the right: e.g. (ω+1)·2 = ω+1+ω+1 = ω+ω+1 = ω·2+1 which is not ω·2+2.\n*[[Left division]] with [[remainder]]: for all ''α'' and ''β'', if ''β'' > 0, then there are unique ''γ'' and ''δ'' such that ''α'' = ''β''·''γ''+''δ'' and ''δ'' < ''β''. (This does not however mean the ordinals are a [[Euclidean domain]], since they are not even a ring, and the Euclidean \"norm\" is ordinal-valued.)\n*Right division does not work: there is no ''α'' such that ''α''·ω ≤ ω<sup>ω</sup> ≤ (''α''+1)·ω.\n\nA δ-number (see [[additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable]]) is an ordinal greater than 1 such that αδ=δ whenever 0<α<δ. These consist of the ordinal 2 and the ordinals of the form ω<sup>ω<sup>β</sup></sup>.\n\n== Exponentiation ==\n\nThe definition of ordinal [[exponentiation]] for finite exponents is straightforward. If the exponent is a finite number, the power is the result of iterated multiplication. For instance, ω<sup>2</sup> = ω·ω using the operation of ordinal multiplication. Note that ω·ω can be defined using the set of functions from 2 = {0,1} to ω = {0,1,2,...}, ordered [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] with the least significant position first:\n:(0,0) < (1,0) < (2,0) < (3,0) < ... < (0,1) < (1,1) < (2,1) < (3,1) < ... < (0,2) < (1,2) < (2,2) < ...\nHere for brevity, we have replaced the function {(0,''k''), (1,''m'')} by the [[ordered pair]] (''k'', ''m'').\n\nSimilarly, for any finite exponent ''n'', <math>\\omega^n</math> can be defined using the set of functions from ''n'' (the domain) to the natural numbers (the range). These functions can be abbreviated as [[tuple|''n''-tuples]] of natural numbers.\n\nBut for infinite exponents, the definition may not be obvious. A limit ordinal, such as ω<sup>ω</sup>, is the supremum of all smaller ordinals. It might seem natural to define ω<sup>ω</sup> using the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. However, we find that any [[absoluteness (mathematical logic)|absolutely]] defined ordering on this set is not well-ordered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} To deal with this issue we can use the variant lexicographical ordering again. We restrict the set to sequences which are nonzero for only a finite number of arguments. This is naturally motivated as the limit of the finite powers of the base (similar to the concept of [[coproduct]] in algebra). This can also be thought of as the [[infinite union]] <math>\\bigcup_{n<\\omega}\\omega^n</math>.\n\nEach of those sequences corresponds to an ordinal less than <math>\\omega^\\omega</math> such as <math>\\omega^{n_1} c_1 + \\omega^{n_2} c_2 + \\cdots + \\omega^{n_k} c_k</math> and <math>\\omega^\\omega</math> is the supremum of all those smaller ordinals.\n\nThe lexicographical order on this set is a well ordering that resembles the ordering of natural numbers written in decimal notation, except with digit positions reversed, and with arbitrary natural numbers instead of just the digits 0–9:\n\n:(0,0,0,...) < (1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,0,0,...) < ... <\n:(0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,1,0,0,0,...) < ... <\n:(0,2,0,0,0,...) < (1,2,0,0,0,...) < (2,2,0,0,0,...)\n:: < ... <\n:(0,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,1,0,0,0,...)\n:: < ...\n\nIn general, any ordinal ''α'' can be raised to the power of another ordinal ''β'' in the same way to get ''α''<sup>''β''</sup>.\n\nIt is easiest to explain this using [[Ordinal number#Von Neumann definition of ordinals|Von Neumann's definition of an ordinal as the set of all smaller ordinals]]. Then, to construct a set of order type ''α''<sup>''β''</sup> consider all functions from ''β'' to ''α'' such that only a finite number of elements of the domain ''β'' map to a non zero element of ''α'' (essentially, we consider the functions with finite [[Support (mathematics)|support]]).  The order is lexicographic with the least significant position first. We find\n* 1<sup>ω</sup> = 1,\n* 2<sup>ω</sup> = ω,\n* 2<sup>ω+1</sup> = ω·2 = ω+ω.\n\nThe definition of exponentiation can also be given inductively (the following induction is on ''β'', the exponent):\n* ''α''<sup>0</sup> = 1,\n* ''α''<sup>''β''+1</sup> = (''α''<sup>''β''</sup>)·''α'', and\n* if ''β'' is a limit ordinal, then ''α''<sup>''β''</sup> is the limit of the ''α''<sup>''δ''</sup> for all ''δ'' &lt; ''β''.\n\nProperties of ordinal exponentiation:\n*''α''<sup>0</sup> = 1.\n*If 0 < ''α'', then 0<sup>''α''</sup> = 0.\n*1<sup>''α''</sup> = 1.\n*''α''<sup>1</sup> = ''α''.\n*''α''<sup>''β''</sup>·''α''<sup>''γ''</sup> = ''α''<sup>''β'' + ''γ''</sup>.\n* (''α''<sup>''β''</sup>)<sup>''γ''</sup> = ''α''<sup>''β''·''γ''</sup>.\n*There are ''α'', ''β'', and ''γ'' for which (''α''·''β'')<sup>''γ''</sup> ≠ ''α''<sup>''γ''</sup>·''β''<sup>''γ''</sup>. For instance, (ω·2)<sup>2</sup> = ω·2·ω·2 = ω<sup>2</sup>·2 ≠ ω<sup>2</sup>·4.\n*Ordinal exponentiation is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: If ''γ'' > 1 and ''α'' < ''β'', then ''γ''<sup>''α''</sup> < ''γ''<sup>''β''</sup>.\n*If ''α'' < ''β'', then ''α''<sup>''γ''</sup> ≤ ''β''<sup>''γ''</sup>. Note, for instance, that 2 < 3 and yet 2<sup>ω</sup> = 3<sup>ω</sup> = ω.\n*If ''α'' > 1 and ''α''<sup>''β''</sup> = ''α''<sup>''γ''</sup>, then ''β'' = ''γ''. If ''α'' =  1 or ''α'' =  0 this is not the case.\n*For all ''α'' and ''β'', if ''β'' > 1 and ''α'' > 0 then there exist unique ''γ'', ''δ'', and ''ρ'' such that ''α'' = ''β''<sup>''γ''</sup>·''δ'' + ''ρ'' such that 0 < ''δ'' < ''β'' and ''ρ'' < ''β''<sup>''γ''</sup>.\n\nWhile the same notation is used for ordinal exponentiation and [[cardinal exponentiation]], ordinal exponentiation is quite different from cardinal exponentiation. For example, with ordinal exponentiation <math>2^\\omega = \\omega</math>, but for <math>\\aleph_0</math>([[aleph naught]], the [[cardinality]] of <math>\\omega</math>), <math>2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0</math>. Here, <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is the cardinality of the set of all functions from the set of all natural numbers to a set with two elements. (This is the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the set of all natural numbers and is equal to <math>\\mathfrak c</math>, the [[cardinality of the continuum]].) To avoid confusing ordinal exponentiation with cardinal exponentiation, one can use symbols for ordinals (e.g. ω) in the former and symbols for cardinals (e.g. <math>\\aleph_0</math>) in the latter.\n\nJacobsthal showed that the only solutions of α<sup>β</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;β<sup>α</sup> with α&nbsp;≤&nbsp;β are given by α&nbsp;=&nbsp;β, or α&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 and β&nbsp;=&nbsp;4, or α is any limit ordinal and β&nbsp;=&nbsp;εα where ε is an [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε-number]] larger than α.<ref>Ernst Jacobsthal, Vertauschbarkeit transfiniter Ordnungszahlen, Mathematische Annalen, Bd 64 (1907), 475-488.

This decomposition of ''α'' is called the '''Cantor normal form''' of ''α'', and can be considered the base-ω [[positional numeral system]].  The highest exponent <math>\\beta_1</math> is called the degree of <math>\\alpha</math>, and satisfies <math>\\beta_1\\le\\alpha</math>. The equality <math>\\beta_1=\\alpha</math> applies if and only if <math>\\alpha=\\omega^\\alpha</math>. In that case Cantor normal form does not express the ordinal in terms of smaller ones; this can happen as explained below.\n\nA minor variation of Cantor normal form, which is usually slightly easier to work with, is to set all the numbers ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> equal to 1 and allow the exponents to be equal. In other words, every ordinal number α can be uniquely written as <math>\\omega^{\\beta_1}  + \\omega^{\\beta_2} + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\beta_k}</math>, where ''k'' is a natural number,  and <math>\\beta_1 \\ge \\beta_2 \\ge \\ldots \\ge \\beta_k \\ge 0</math> are ordinal numbers.\n\nAnother variation of the Cantor normal form is the \"base δ expansion\", where ω is replaced by any ordinal δ>1, and the numbers ''c''<sub>''i''</sub> are positive ordinals less than δ.\n\nThe Cantor normal form allows us to uniquely express&mdash;and order&mdash;the ordinals ''α'' that are built from the natural numbers by a finite number of arithmetical operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation base-<math>\\omega</math>: in other words, assuming <math>\\beta_1<\\alpha</math> in the Cantor normal form, we can also express the exponents <math>\\beta_i</math> in Cantor normal form, and making the same assumption for the <math>\\beta_i</math> as for α and so on recursively, we get a system of notation for these ordinals (for example, \n:<math>\\omega^{\\left( \\omega^{\\left( \\omega^7\\cdot6+\\omega+42 \\right)}\\cdot1729+\\omega^9+88 \\right)}\\cdot3+\\omega^{\\left( \\omega^\\omega \\right)}\\cdot5+65537</math>\n\ndenotes an ordinal).\n\nThe ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> ([[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|epsilon nought]]) is the set of ordinal values &alpha; of the finite-length arithmetical expressions of Cantor normal form that are hereditarily non-trivial where non-trivial means &beta;<sub>1</sub><&alpha; when 0<&alpha;. It is the smallest ordinal that does not have a finite arithmetical expression in terms of ω, and the smallest ordinal such that <math>\\varepsilon_0 = \\omega^{\\varepsilon_0}</math>, i.e. in Cantor normal form the exponent is not smaller than the ordinal itself. It is the limit of the sequence \n:<math>0, \\, 1=\\omega^0, \\, \\omega=\\omega^1, \\, \\omega^\\omega, \\, \\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}, \\, \\ldots \\,.</math>\n\nThe ordinal ε<sub>0</sub> is important for various reasons in arithmetic (essentially because it measures the [[proof-theoretic strength]] of the [[First-order logic|first-order]] [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]]: that is, Peano's axioms can show transfinite induction up to any ordinal less than ε<sub>0</sub> but not up to ε<sub>0</sub> itself).\n\nThe Cantor normal form also allows us to compute sums and products of ordinals: to compute the sum, for example, one need merely know that\n:<math>\\omega^{\\beta} c+\\omega^{\\beta'} c' = \\omega^{\\beta'}c' \\,,</math>\n\nif <math>\\beta'>\\beta</math> (if <math>\\beta'=\\beta</math> one can apply the distributive law on the left and rewrite this as <math>\\omega^{\\beta} (c+c')</math>, and if <math>\\beta'<\\beta</math> the expression is already in Cantor normal form); and to compute products, the essential facts are that when <math>0 < \\alpha = \\omega^{\\beta_1} c_1 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\beta_k}c_k</math> is in Cantor normal form and <math>0 < \\beta' </math>, then \n:<math>\\alpha\\omega^{\\beta'} = \\omega^{\\beta_1 + \\beta'} \\,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\\alpha n = \\omega^{\\beta_1} c_1 n + \\omega^{\\beta_2} c_2 + \\cdots + \\omega^{\\beta_k}c_k \\,,</math>\n\nif n is a non-zero natural number.\n\nTo compare two ordinals written in Cantor normal form, first compare <math>\\beta_1</math>, then <math>c_1</math>, then <math>\\beta_2</math>, then <math>c_2</math>, etc..  At the first difference, the ordinal that has the larger component is the larger ordinal.  If they are the same until one terminates before the other, then the one that terminates first is smaller.\n\n==Factorization into primes==\n\n[[Ernst Jacobsthal]] showed that the ordinals satisfy a form of the unique factorization theorem: every nonzero ordinal can be written as a product of a finite number of prime ordinals. This factorization into prime ordinals is in general not unique, but there is a \"minimal\" factorization into primes that is unique up to changing the order of finite prime factors {{harv|Sierpiński|1958}}.\n\nA prime ordinal is an ordinal greater than 1 that cannot be written as a product of two smaller ordinals. Some of the first primes are 2, 3, 5, ... , ω, ω+1, ω<sup>2</sup>+1, ω<sup>3</sup>+1, ..., ω<sup>ω</sup>, ω<sup>ω</sup>+1, ω<sup>ω+1</sup>+1, ... There are three sorts of prime ordinals:\n*The finite primes 2, 3, 5, ...\n*The ordinals of the form ω<sup>ω<sup>α</sup></sup> for any ordinal α. These are the prime ordinals that are limits, and are the [[delta number]]s.\n*The ordinals of the form ω<sup>α</sup>+1 for any ordinal α>0. These are the infinite successor primes, and are the successors of [[Additively indecomposable ordinal|gamma number]]s, the additively indecomposable ordinals.\n\nFactorization into primes is not unique: for example, 2×3=3×2, 2×ω=ω, (ω+1)×ω=ω×ω and ω×ω<sup>ω</sup> = ω<sup>ω</sup>. However, there is a unique factorization into primes satisfying the following additional conditions:\n*Every limit prime occurs before every successor prime\n*If two consecutive primes of the prime factorization are both limits or both finite, then the second one is at most the first one.\n\nThis prime factorization can easily be read off using the Cantor normal form as follows:\n*First write the ordinal as a product αβ where α is the smallest power of ω in the Cantor normal form and β is a successor.\n*If α=ω<sup>γ</sup> then writing γ in Cantor normal form gives an expansion of α as a product of limit primes.\n*Now look at the Cantor normal form of β. If β = ω<sup>λ</sup>m + ω<sup>μ</sup>''n''+ smaller terms then β = (ω<sup>μ</sup>''n''+ smaller terms)(ω<sup>λ−μ</sup> + 1)''m'' is a product of a smaller ordinal and a prime and an integer ''m''. Repeating this and factorizing the integers into primes gives the prime factorization of β.\n\nSo the factorization of the Cantor normal form ordinal\n:<math>\\omega^{\\alpha_1}n_1+\\cdots +\\omega^{\\alpha_k}n_k</math> (with <math>\\alpha_1>\\cdots>\\alpha_k</math>) \ninto a minimal product of infinite primes and integers is\n:<math>\\omega^{\\omega^{\\beta_1}}\\cdots\\omega^{\\omega^{\\beta_m}}n_k(\\omega^{\\alpha_{k-1}-\\alpha_k}+1)n_{k-1}\\cdots n_2(\\omega^{\\alpha_{1}-\\alpha_2}+1)n_1</math>\nwhere each ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> should be replaced by its factorization into a non-increasing sequence of finite primes and\n:<math>\\alpha_k=\\omega^{\\beta_1}+\\cdots +\\omega^{\\beta_m}</math> with <math>\\beta_1\\ge\\cdots\\ge\\beta_m</math>.\n\n==Large countable ordinals==\n\nAs discussed above, the Cantor Normal Form of ordinals below <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> can be expressed in an alphabet containing only the function symbols for addition, multiplication and exponentiation, as well as constant symbols for each natural number and for <math>\\omega</math>. We can do away with the infinitely many numerals by using just the constant symbol 0 and the operation of successor, <math>S</math> (for example, the integer 4 may be expressed as <math>S(S(S(S(0))))</math>). This describes an ''[[ordinal notation]]'': a system for naming ordinals over a finite alphabet. This particular system of ordinal notation is called the collection of ''arithmetical'' ordinal expressions, and can express all ordinals below <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, but cannot express <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>. There are other ordinal notations capable of capturing ordinals well past <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, but because there are only countably many strings over any finite alphabet, for any given ordinal notation there will be ordinals below <math>\\omega_1</math> (the [[first uncountable ordinal]]) that are not expressible. Such ordinals are known as [[large countable ordinal]]s.\n\nThe operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all examples of [[primitive recursive ordinal function]]s, and more general primitive recursive ordinal functions can be used to describe larger ordinals.\n\n== Natural operations ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Surreal number]] -->\n\nThe '''natural sum'''  and '''natural product''' operations on ordinals  were defined in 1906 by [[Gerhard Hessenberg]], and are sometimes called the  '''Hessenberg sum''' (or product) {{harv|Sierpinski|1958}}.  These are the same as the addition and multiplication (restricted to ordinals) of John Conway's [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[surreal numbers]]. They have the advantage that they are associative and commutative, and natural product distributes over natural sum.  The cost of making these operations commutative is that they lose the continuity in the right argument which is a property of the ordinary sum and product.  The natural sum of α and β is often denoted by  α⊕β or α#β, and the natural product by α⊗β or α⨳β.\n\nThe natural operations come up in the theory of [[Well-quasi-ordering|well partial orders]]; given two well partial orders ''S'' and ''T'', of types (maximum linearizations) ''o''(''S'') and ''o''(''T''), the type of the disjoint union is ''o''(''S'')⊕''o''(''T''), while the type of the direct product is ''o''(''S'')⊗''o''(''T'').<ref>D. H. J. De Jongh and R. Parikh, Well-partial orderings and hierarchies, Indag. Math. 39 (1977), 195–206. Available [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1385725877900671 here]</ref>  One may take this relation as a definition of the natural operations by choosing ''S'' and ''T'' to be ordinals α and β; so α⊕β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the disjoint union (as a partial order) of α and β; while α⊗β is the maximum order type of a total order extending the direct product (as a partial order) of α and β.<ref>Philip W. Carruth, Arithmetic of ordinals with applications to the theory of ordered Abelian groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1942), 262–271. See Theorem 1.

If they are both subsets of some ordered abelian group, then their sum has order type at most α⊗β.\n\nWe can also define the natural sum of ''α'' and ''β'' inductively (by simultaneous induction on ''α'' and ''β'') as the smallest ordinal greater than the natural sum of ''α'' and ''γ'' for all ''γ'' &lt; ''β'' and of ''γ'' and ''β'' for all ''γ'' &lt; ''α''.  There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write down and we shall not do so (see the article on [[surreal numbers]] for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals).\n\nThe natural sum is associative and commutative.  It is always greater or equal to the usual sum, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural sum of ω and 1 is ω+1 (the usual sum), but this is also the natural sum of 1 and ω.  The natural product is associative and commutative and distributes over the natural sum.  It is always greater or equal to the usual product, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural product of ω and 2 is ω·2 (the usual product), but this is also the natural product of 2 and ω.\n\nYet another way to define the natural sum and product of two ordinals α and β is to use the Cantor normal form: one can find a sequence of ordinals \nγ<sub>1</sub> &gt; … &gt; γ<sub>n</sub> \nand two sequences (''k''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''k''<sub>n</sub>) and \n(''j''<sub>1</sub>, …, ''j''<sub>n</sub>) of natural numbers (including zero, but satisfying \n''k''<sub>''i''</sub> + ''j''<sub>''i''</sub> &gt; 0 for all ''i'') such that \n:<math>\\alpha = \\omega^{\\gamma_1}\\cdot k_1 + \\cdots +\\omega^{\\gamma_n}\\cdot k_n</math>\n:<math>\\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_1}\\cdot j_1 + \\cdots +\\omega^{\\gamma_n}\\cdot j_n</math>\nand defines \n:<math>\\alpha \\#\\beta = \\omega^{\\gamma_1}\\cdot (k_1+j_1) + \\cdots +\\omega^{\\gamma_n}\\cdot (k_n+j_n).</math>\n\nUnder natural addition, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the free abelian group with basis the gamma numbers ω<sup>α</sup> that have non-negative integer coefficients.  Under natural addition and multiplication, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the (commutative) polynomial ring generated by the delta numbers ω<sup>ω<sup>α</sup></sup> that have non-negative integer coefficients.\nThe ordinals do not have unique factorization into primes under the natural product. While the full polynomial ring does have unique factorization, the subset of polynomials with non-negative coefficients does not: for example, if ''x'' is any delta number, then\n:<math>x^5+x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x+1)(x^4+x^2+1)=(x^2+x+1)(x^3+1)</math>\nhas two incompatible expressions as a natural product of polynomials with non-negative coefficients that cannot be decomposed further.\n\n==Nimber arithmetic==\n{{main|Nimber}}\nThere are arithmetic operations on ordinals by virtue of the one-to-one correspondence between ordinals and [[nimber]]s.  Three common operations on nimbers are nimber addition, nimber multiplication, and [[Mex (mathematics)|minimum excludance (mex)]].  Nimber addition is a generalization of the [[Bitwise operation#XOR|bitwise exclusive or]] operation on natural numbers.  The {{math|mex}} of a set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal ''not'' present in the set.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Jech, Thomas, 2003.

      "text": "In [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]], an '''ordinal collapsing function''' (or '''projection function''') is a technique for defining ([[Ordinal notation|notations]] for) certain [[Recursive ordinal|recursive]] [[large countable ordinal]]s, whose principle is to give names to certain ordinals much larger than the one being defined, perhaps even [[Large cardinal property|large cardinals]] (though they can be replaced with [[Large countable ordinal#Beyond admissible ordinals|recursively large ordinals]] at the cost of extra technical difficulty), and then “collapse” them down to a system of notations for the sought-after ordinal.  For this reason, ordinal collapsing functions are described as an [[Impredicativity|impredicative]] manner of naming ordinals.\n\nThe details of the definition of ordinal collapsing functions vary, and get more complicated as greater ordinals are being defined, but the typical idea is that whenever the notation system “runs out of fuel” and cannot name a certain ordinal, a much larger ordinal is brought “from above” to give a name to that critical point.  An example of how this works will be detailed below, for an ordinal collapsing function defining the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]] (i.e., defining a system of notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\nThe use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is inextricably intertwined with the theory of [[ordinal analysis]], since the large countable ordinals defined and denoted by a given collapse are used to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of certain [[formal system]]s, typically<ref name=\"Rathjen-survey\">Rathjen, 1995 (Bull.

More on the relation between this example and Buchholz's system will be said [[#Going beyond the Bachmann–Howard ordinal|below]].\n\n=== Definition ===\nLet <math>\\Omega</math> stand for the [[first uncountable ordinal]] <math>\\omega_1</math>, or, in fact, any ordinal which is (an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number and) guaranteed to be greater than all the [[countable ordinal]]s which will be constructed (for example, the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]] is adequate for our purposes; but we will work with <math>\\omega_1</math> because it allows the convenient use of the word ''countable'' in the definitions).\n\nWe define a function <math>\\psi</math> (which will be [[Monotonic function|non-decreasing]] and [[Continuous function|continuous]]), taking an arbitrary ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> to a countable ordinal <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math>, recursively on <math>\\alpha</math>, as follows:\n\n:Assume <math>\\psi(\\beta)</math> has been defined for all <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math>, and we wish to define <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math>.\n\n:Let <math>C(\\alpha)</math> be the set of ordinals generated starting from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\Omega</math> by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal [[Ordinal arithmetic|addition, multiplication and exponentiation]] and the function <math>\\psi\\upharpoonright_\\alpha</math>, i.e., the restriction of <math>\\psi</math> to ordinals <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math>.  (Formally, we define <math>C(\\alpha)_0 = \\{0,1,\\omega,\\Omega\\}</math> and inductively <math>C(\\alpha)_{n+1} = C(\\alpha)_n \\cup \\{\\beta_1+\\beta_2,\\beta_1\\beta_2,{\\beta_1}^{\\beta_2}: \\beta_1,\\beta_2\\in C(\\alpha)_n\\} \\cup \\{\\psi(\\beta): \\beta\\in C(\\alpha)_n \\land \\beta<\\alpha\\}</math> for all natural numbers <math>n</math> and we let <math>C(\\alpha)</math> be the union of the <math>C(\\alpha)_n</math> for all <math>n</math>.)\n\n:Then <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is defined as the smallest ordinal not belonging to <math>C(\\alpha)</math>.\n\nIn a more concise (although more obscure) way:\n:<math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\Omega</math> using sums, products, exponentials, and the <math>\\psi</math> function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than <math>\\alpha</math>).\n\nHere is an attempt to explain the motivation for the definition of <math>\\psi</math> in intuitive terms: since the usual operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are not sufficient to designate ordinals very far, we attempt to systematically create new names for ordinals by taking the first one which does not have a name yet, and whenever we run out of names, rather than invent them in an ''ad hoc'' fashion or using [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal schemes]], we seek them in the ordinals far beyond the ones we are constructing (beyond <math>\\Omega</math>, that is); so we give names to uncountable ordinals and, since in the end the list of names is necessarily countable, <math>\\psi</math> will “collapse” them to countable ordinals.\n\n=== Computation of values of <math>\\psi</math> ===\nTo clarify how the function <math>\\psi</math> is able to produce notations for certain ordinals, we now compute its first values.\n\n==== Predicative start ====\nFirst consider <math>C(0)</math>.  It contains ordinals <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega+1</math>, <math>\\omega+2</math>, <math>\\omega2</math>, <math>\\omega3</math>, <math>\\omega^2</math>, <math>\\omega^3</math>, <math>\\omega^\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math> and so on.  It also contains such ordinals as <math>\\Omega</math>, <math>\\Omega+1</math>, <math>\\Omega\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega^\\Omega</math>.  The first ordinal which it does not contain is [[Epsilon nought|<math>\\varepsilon_0</math>]] (which is the limit of <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math> and so on &mdash; less than <math>\\Omega</math> by assumption).  The upper bound of the ordinals it contains is <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math> (the limit of <math>\\Omega</math>, <math>\\Omega^\\Omega</math>, <math>\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\Omega}</math> and so on), but that is not so important.  This shows that <math>\\psi(0) = \\varepsilon_0</math>.\n\nSimilarly, <math>C(1)</math> contains the ordinals which can be formed from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math> and this time also <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, using addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  This contains all the ordinals up to <math>\\varepsilon_1</math> but not the latter, so <math>\\psi(1) = \\varepsilon_1</math>.  In this manner, we prove that <math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> inductively on <math>\\alpha</math>: the proof works, however, only as long as <math>\\alpha<\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math>.  We therefore have:\n\n:<math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\varepsilon_\\alpha = \\phi_1(\\alpha)</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\leq\\zeta_0</math>, where <math>\\zeta_0 = \\phi_2(0)</math> is the smallest fixed point of <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math>.\n\n(Here, the <math>\\phi</math> functions are the [[Veblen function]]s defined starting with <math>\\phi_1(\\alpha) = \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math>.)\n\nNow <math>\\psi(\\zeta_0) = \\zeta_0</math> but <math>\\psi(\\zeta_0+1)</math> is no larger, since <math>\\zeta_0</math> cannot be constructed using finite applications of <math>\\phi_1\\colon \\alpha\\mapsto\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> and thus never belongs to a <math>C(\\alpha)</math> set for <math>\\alpha\\leq\\Omega</math>, and the function <math>\\psi</math> remains “stuck” at <math>\\zeta_0</math> for some time:\n\n:<math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\zeta_0</math> for all <math>\\zeta_0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\Omega</math>.\n\n==== First impredicative values ====\nAgain, <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math>.  However, when we come to computing <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math>, something has changed: since <math>\\Omega</math> was (“artificially”) added to all the <math>C(\\alpha)</math>, we are permitted to take the value <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math> in the process.  So <math>C(\\Omega+1)</math> contains all ordinals which can be built from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math>, the <math>\\phi_1\\colon\\alpha\\mapsto\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> function ''up to <math>\\zeta_0</math>'' and this time also <math>\\zeta_0</math> itself, using addition, multiplication and exponentiation.  The smallest ordinal not in <math>C(\\Omega+1)</math> is <math>\\varepsilon_{\\zeta_0+1}</math> (the smallest <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number after <math>\\zeta_0</math>).\n\nWe say that the definition <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math> and the next values of the function <math>\\psi</math> such as <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1) = \\varepsilon_{\\zeta_0+1}</math> are [[Impredicativity|impredicative]] because they use ordinals (here, <math>\\Omega</math>) greater than the ones which are being defined (here, <math>\\zeta_0</math>).\n\n==== Values of <math>\\psi</math> up to the Feferman–Schütte ordinal ====\nThe fact that <math>\\psi(\\Omega+\\alpha) = \\varepsilon_{\\zeta_0+\\alpha}</math> remains true for all <math>\\alpha \\leq \\zeta_1 = \\phi_2(1)</math> (note, in particular, that <math>\\psi(\\Omega+\\zeta_0) = \\varepsilon_{\\zeta_0 2}</math>: but since now the ordinal <math>\\zeta_0</math> has been constructed there is nothing to prevent from going beyond this).  However, at <math>\\zeta_1 = \\phi_2(1)</math> (the first fixed point of <math>\\alpha\\mapsto \\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> beyond <math>\\zeta_0</math>), the construction stops again, because <math>\\zeta_1</math> cannot be constructed from smaller ordinals and <math>\\zeta_0</math> by finitely applying the <math>\\varepsilon</math> function.  So we have <math>\\psi(\\Omega 2) = \\zeta_1</math>.\n\nThe same reasoning shows that <math>\\psi(\\Omega(1+\\alpha)) = \\phi_2(\\alpha)</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\leq\\phi_3(0)</math>, where <math>\\phi_2</math> enumerates the fixed points of <math>\\phi_1\\colon\\alpha\\mapsto\\varepsilon_\\alpha</math> and <math>\\phi_3(0)</math> is the first fixed point of <math>\\phi_2</math>.  We then have <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2) = \\phi_3(0)</math>.\n\nAgain, we can see that <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\alpha) = \\phi_{1+\\alpha}(0)</math> for some time: this remains true until the first fixed point <math>\\Gamma_0</math> of <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\phi_\\alpha(0)</math>, which is the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]].  Thus, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega) = \\Gamma_0</math> is the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.\n\n==== Beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal ====\nWe have <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega+\\Omega^\\alpha)  = \\phi_{\\Gamma_0+\\alpha}(0)</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\leq\\Gamma_1</math> where <math>\\Gamma_1</math> is the next fixed point of <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\phi_\\alpha(0)</math>.  So, if <math>\\alpha\\mapsto\\Gamma_\\alpha</math> enumerates the fixed points in question (which can also be noted <math>\\phi(1,0,\\alpha)</math> using the many-valued Veblen functions) we have <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega(1+\\alpha)) = \\Gamma_\\alpha</math>, until the first fixed point <math>\\phi(1,1,0)</math> of the <math>\\alpha\\mapsto\\Gamma_\\alpha</math> itself, which will be <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega+1})</math> (and the first fixed point <math>\\phi(2,0,0)</math> of the <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\phi(1,\\alpha,0)</math> functions will be <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega2})</math>).  In this manner:\n* <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2})</math> is the [[Ackermann ordinal]] (the range of the notation <math>\\phi(\\alpha,\\beta,\\gamma)</math> defined predicatively),\n* <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\omega})</math> is the [[small Veblen ordinal|&ldquo;small&rdquo; Veblen ordinal]] (the range of the notations <math>\\phi(\\ldots)</math> predicatively using finitely many variables),\n* <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\Omega})</math> is the [[large Veblen ordinal|&ldquo;large&rdquo; Veblen ordinal]] (the range of the notations <math>\\phi(\\ldots)</math> predicatively using transfinitely-but-predicatively-many variables),\n* the limit <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})</math> of <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\Omega})</math>, etc., is the [[Bachmann–Howard ordinal]]: after this our function <math>\\psi</math> is constant, and we can go no further with the definition we have given.\n\n=== Ordinal notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal ===\nWe now explain more systematically how the <math>\\psi</math> function defines notations for ordinals up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.\n\n==== A note about base representations ====\nRecall that if <math>\\delta</math> is an ordinal which is a power of <math>\\omega</math> (for example <math>\\omega</math> itself, or <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, or <math>\\Omega</math>), any ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> can be uniquely expressed in the form <math>\\delta^{\\beta_1}\\gamma_1 + \\ldots + \\delta^{\\beta_k}\\gamma_k</math>, where <math>k</math> is a natural number, <math>\\gamma_1,\\ldots,\\gamma_k</math> are non-zero ordinals less than <math>\\delta</math>, and <math>\\beta_1 > \\beta_2 > \\cdots > \\beta_k</math> are ordinal numbers (we allow <math>\\beta_k=0</math>).  This “base <math>\\delta</math> representation” is an obvious generalization of the [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] (which is the case <math>\\delta=\\omega</math>).  Of course, it may quite well be that the expression is uninteresting, i.e., <math>\\alpha = \\delta^\\alpha</math>, but in any other case the <math>\\beta_i</math> must all be less than <math>\\alpha</math>; it may also be the case that the expression is trivial (i.e., <math>\\alpha<\\delta</math>, in which case <math>k\\leq 1</math> and <math>\\gamma_1 = \\alpha</math>).\n\nIf <math>\\alpha</math> is an ordinal less than <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>, then its base <math>\\Omega</math> representation has coefficients <math>\\gamma_i<\\Omega</math> (by definition) and exponents <math>\\beta_i<\\alpha</math> (because of the assumption <math>\\alpha < \\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>): hence one can rewrite these exponents in base <math>\\Omega</math> and repeat the operation until the process terminates (any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite).  We call the resulting expression the ''iterated base <math>\\Omega</math> representation'' of <math>\\alpha</math> and the various coefficients involved (including as exponents) the ''pieces'' of the representation (they are all <math><\\Omega</math>), or, for short, the <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces of <math>\\alpha</math>.\n\n==== Some properties of <math>\\psi</math> ====\n* The function <math>\\psi</math> is non-decreasing and continuous (this is more or less obvious from its definition).\n* If <math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\psi(\\beta)</math> with <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math> then necessarily <math>C(\\alpha) = C(\\beta)</math>.  Indeed, no ordinal <math>\\beta'</math> with <math>\\beta\\leq\\beta'<\\alpha</math> can belong to <math>C(\\alpha)</math> (otherwise its image by <math>\\psi</math>, which is <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> would belong to <math>C(\\alpha)</math> &mdash; impossible); so <math>C(\\beta)</math> is closed by everything under which <math>C(\\alpha)</math> is the closure, so they are equal.\n* Any value <math>\\gamma=\\psi(\\alpha)</math> taken by <math>\\psi</math> is an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number (i.e., a fixed point of <math>\\beta\\mapsto\\omega^\\beta</math>).  Indeed, if it were not, then by writing it in [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]], it could be expressed using sums, products and exponentiation from elements less than it, hence in <math>C(\\alpha)</math>, so it would be in <math>C(\\alpha)</math>, a contradiction.\n* Lemma: Assume <math>\\delta</math> is an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number and <math>\\alpha</math> an ordinal such that <math>\\psi(\\beta)<\\delta</math> for all <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math>: then the <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces (defined [[#A note about base representations|above]]) of any element of <math>C(\\alpha)</math> are less than <math>\\delta</math>.  Indeed, let <math>C'</math> be the set of ordinals all of whose <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces are  less than <math>\\delta</math>.  Then <math>C'</math> is closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation (because <math>\\delta</math> is an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number, so ordinals less than it are closed under addition, multiplication and exponentiation).  And <math>C'</math> also contains every <math>\\psi(\\beta)</math> for <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math> by assumption, and it  contains <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math>.  So <math>C'\\supseteq C(\\alpha)</math>, which was to be shown.\n* Under the hypothesis of the previous lemma, <math>\\psi(\\alpha) \\leq \\delta</math> (indeed, the lemma shows that <math>\\delta \\not\\in C(\\alpha)</math>).\n* Any <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number less than some element in the range of <math>\\psi</math> is itself in the range of <math>\\psi</math> (that is, <math>\\psi</math> omits no <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number).  Indeed: if <math>\\delta</math> is an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number not greater than the range of <math>\\psi</math>, let <math>\\alpha</math> be the least upper bound of the <math>\\beta</math> such that <math>\\psi(\\beta)<\\delta</math>: then by the above we have <math>\\psi(\\alpha)\\leq\\delta</math>, but <math>\\psi(\\alpha)<\\delta</math> would contradict the fact that <math>\\alpha</math> is the ''least'' upper bound &mdash; so <math>\\psi(\\alpha)=\\delta</math>.\n* Whenever <math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\delta</math>, the set <math>C(\\alpha)</math> consists exactly of those ordinals <math>\\gamma</math> (less than <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>) all of whose <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces are less than <math>\\delta</math>.  Indeed, we know that all ordinals less than <math>\\delta</math>, hence all ordinals (less than <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>) whose <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces are less than <math>\\delta</math>, are in <math>C(\\alpha)</math>.  Conversely, if we assume <math>\\psi(\\beta) < \\delta</math> for all <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math> (in other words if <math>\\alpha</math> is the least possible with <math>\\psi(\\alpha)=\\delta</math>), the lemma gives the desired property.  On the other hand, if <math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\psi(\\beta)</math> for some <math>\\beta<\\alpha</math>, then we have already remarked <math>C(\\alpha) = C(\\beta)</math> and we can replace <math>\\alpha</math> by the least possible with <math>\\psi(\\alpha)=\\delta</math>.\n\n==== The ordinal notation ====\nUsing the facts above, we can define a (canonical) ordinal notation for every <math>\\gamma</math> less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  We do this by induction on <math>\\gamma</math>.\n\nIf <math>\\gamma</math> is less than <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, we use the iterated Cantor normal form of <math>\\gamma</math>.  Otherwise, there exists a largest <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number <math>\\delta</math> less or equal to <math>\\gamma</math> (this is because the set of <math>\\varepsilon</math>-numbers is closed): if <math>\\delta<\\gamma</math> then by induction we have defined a notation for <math>\\delta</math> and the base <math>\\delta</math> representation of <math>\\gamma</math> gives one for <math>\\gamma</math>, so we are finished.\n\nIt remains to deal with the case where <math>\\gamma=\\delta</math> is an <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number: we have argued that, in this case, we can write <math>\\delta = \\psi(\\alpha)</math> for some (possibly uncountable) ordinal <math>\\alpha<\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>: let <math>\\alpha</math> be the ''greatest'' possible such ordinal (which exists since <math>\\psi</math> is continuous).  We use the iterated base <math>\\Omega</math> representation of <math>\\alpha</math>: it remains to show that every piece of this representation is less than <math>\\delta</math> (so we have already defined a notation for it).  If this is ''not'' the case then, by the properties we have shown, <math>C(\\alpha)</math> does not contain <math>\\alpha</math>; but then <math>C(\\alpha+1)=C(\\alpha)</math> (they are closed under the same operations, since the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\alpha</math> can never be taken), so <math>\\psi(\\alpha+1)=\\psi(\\alpha)=\\delta</math>, contradicting the maximality of <math>\\alpha</math>.\n\n'''Note''': Actually, we have defined canonical notations not just for ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal but also for certain uncountable ordinals, namely those whose <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces are less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (viz.: write them in iterated base <math>\\Omega</math> representation and use the canonical representation for every piece).  This canonical notation is used for arguments of the <math>\\psi</math> function (which may be uncountable).\n\n==== Examples ====\nFor ordinals less than <math>\\varepsilon_0 = \\psi(0)</math>, the canonical ordinal notation defined coincides with the iterated Cantor normal form (by definition).\n\nFor ordinals less than <math>\\varepsilon_1 = \\psi(1)</math>, the notation coincides with iterated base <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> notation (the pieces being themselves written in iterated Cantor normal form): e.g., <math>\\omega^{\\omega^{\\varepsilon_0+\\omega}}</math> will be written <math>{\\varepsilon_0}^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>, or, more accurately, <math>\\psi(0)^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>.  For ordinals less than <math>\\varepsilon_2 = \\psi(2)</math>, we similarly write in iterated base <math>\\varepsilon_1</math> and then write the pieces in iterated base <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> (and write the pieces of ''that'' in iterated Cantor normal form): so <math>\\omega^{\\omega^{\\varepsilon_1+\\varepsilon_0+1}}</math> is written <math>{\\varepsilon_1}^{\\varepsilon_0\\omega}</math>, or, more accurately, <math>\\psi(1)^{\\psi(0)\\,\\omega}</math>.  Thus, up to <math>\\zeta_0 = \\psi(\\Omega)</math>, we always use the largest possible <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number base which gives a non-trivial representation.\n\nBeyond this, we may need to express ordinals beyond <math>\\Omega</math>: this is always done in iterated <math>\\Omega</math>-base, and the pieces themselves need to be expressed using the largest possible <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number base which gives a non-trivial representation.\n\nNote that while <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})</math> is equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, this is not a “canonical notation” in the sense we have defined (canonical notations are defined only for ordinals ''less'' than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\n==== Conditions for canonicalness ====\nThe notations thus defined have the property that whenever they nest <math>\\psi</math> functions, the arguments of the “inner” <math>\\psi</math> function are always less than those of the “outer” one (this is a consequence of the fact that the <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces of <math>\\alpha</math>, where <math>\\alpha</math> is the largest possible such that <math>\\psi(\\alpha)=\\delta</math> for some <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number <math>\\delta</math>, are all less than <math>\\delta</math>, as we have shown above).  For example, <math>\\psi(\\psi(\\Omega)+1)</math> does not occur as a notation: it is a well-defined expression (and it is equal to <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math> since <math>\\psi</math> is constant between <math>\\zeta_0</math> and <math>\\Omega</math>), but it is not a notation produced by the inductive algorithm we have outlined.\n\nCanonicalness can be checked recursively: an expression is canonical if and only if it is either the iterated Cantor normal form of an ordinal less than <math>\\varepsilon_0</math>, or an iterated base <math>\\delta</math> representation all of whose pieces are canonical, for some <math>\\delta=\\psi(\\alpha)</math> where <math>\\alpha</math> is itself written in iterated base <math>\\Omega</math> representation all of whose pieces are canonical and less than <math>\\delta</math>.  The order is checked by lexicographic verification at all levels (keeping in mind that <math>\\Omega</math> is greater than any expression obtained by <math>\\psi</math>, and for canonical values the greater <math>\\psi</math> always trumps the lesser or even arbitrary sums, products and exponentials of the lesser).\n\nFor example, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\omega+1}\\,\\psi(\\Omega) + \\psi(\\Omega^\\omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega^2)}42)^{\\psi(1729)\\,\\omega}</math> is a canonical notation for an ordinal which is less than the Feferman–Schütte ordinal: it can be written using the Veblen functions as <math>\\phi_1(\\phi_{\\omega+1}(\\phi_2(0)) + \\phi_\\omega(0)^{\\phi_3(0)}42)^{\\phi_1(1729)\\,\\omega}</math>.\n\nConcerning the order, one might point out that <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega)</math> (the Feferman–Schütte ordinal) is much more than <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(\\Omega)}) = \\phi_{\\phi_2(0)}(0)</math> (because <math>\\Omega</math> is greater than <math>\\psi</math> of anything), and <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(\\Omega)}) = \\phi_{\\phi_2(0)}(0)</math> is itself much more than <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega)} = \\phi_2(0)^{\\phi_2(0)}</math> (because <math>\\Omega^{\\psi(\\Omega)}</math> is greater than <math>\\Omega</math>, so any sum-product-or-exponential expression involving <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math> and smaller value will remain less than <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega)</math>).  In fact, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega)}</math> is already less than <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math>.\n\n=== Standard sequences for ordinal notations ===\n{{main|Fundamental sequence (ordinals)}}\nTo witness the fact that we have defined notations for ordinals below the Bachmann–Howard ordinal (which are all of countable [[cofinality]]), we might define standard sequences converging to any one of them (provided it is a limit ordinal, of course).  Actually we will define canonical sequences for certain uncountable ordinals, too, namely the uncountable ordinals of ''countable'' cofinality (if we are to hope to define a sequence converging to them…) which are representable (that is, all of whose <math>\\Omega</math>-pieces are less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).\n\nThe following rules are more or less obvious, except for the last:\n* First, get rid of the (iterated) base <math>\\delta</math> representations: to define a standard sequence converging to <math>\\alpha = \\delta^{\\beta_1}\\gamma_1 + \\cdots + \\delta^{\\beta_k}\\gamma_k</math>, where <math>\\delta</math> is either <math>\\omega</math> or <math>\\psi(\\cdots)</math> (or <math>\\Omega</math>, but see below):\n** if <math>k</math> is zero then <math>\\alpha=0</math> and there is nothing to be done;\n** if <math>\\beta_k</math> is zero and <math>\\gamma_k</math> is successor, then <math>\\alpha</math> is successor and there is nothing to be done;\n** if <math>\\gamma_k</math> is limit, take the standard sequence converging to <math>\\gamma_k</math> and replace <math>\\gamma_k</math> in the expression by the elements of that sequence;\n** if <math>\\gamma_k</math> is successor and <math>\\beta_k</math> is limit, rewrite the last term <math>\\delta^{\\beta_k}\\gamma_k</math> as <math>\\delta^{\\beta_k}(\\gamma_k-1) + \\delta^{\\beta_k}</math> and replace the exponent <math>\\beta_k</math> in the last term by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it;\n** if <math>\\gamma_k</math> is successor and <math>\\beta_k</math> is also, rewrite the last term <math>\\delta^{\\beta_k}\\gamma_k</math> as <math>\\delta^{\\beta_k}(\\gamma_k-1) + \\delta^{\\beta_k-1}\\delta</math> and replace the last <math>\\delta</math> in this expression by the elements of the fundamental sequence converging to it.\n* If <math>\\delta</math> is <math>\\omega</math>, then take the obvious <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>2</math>, <math>3</math>… as the fundamental sequence for <math>\\delta</math>.\n* If <math>\\delta = \\psi(0)</math> then take as fundamental sequence for <math>\\delta</math> the sequence <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>…\n* If <math>\\delta = \\psi(\\alpha+1)</math> then take as fundamental sequence for <math>\\delta</math> the sequence <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\alpha)^{\\psi(\\alpha)}</math>, <math>\\psi(\\alpha)^{\\psi(\\alpha)^{\\psi(\\alpha)}}</math>…\n* If <math>\\delta = \\psi(\\alpha)</math> where <math>\\alpha</math> is a limit ordinal of ''countable'' cofinality, define the standard sequence for <math>\\delta</math> to be obtained by applying <math>\\psi</math> to the standard sequence for <math>\\alpha</math> (recall that <math>\\psi</math> is continuous and increasing, here).\n* It remains to handle the case where <math>\\delta = \\psi(\\alpha)</math> with <math>\\alpha</math> an ordinal of ''uncountable'' cofinality (e.g., <math>\\Omega</math> itself).  Obviously it doesn't make sense to define a sequence converging to <math>\\alpha</math> in this case; however, what we can define is a sequence converging to some <math>\\rho<\\alpha</math> with countable cofinality and such that <math>\\psi</math> is constant between <math>\\rho</math> and <math>\\alpha</math>.  This <math>\\rho</math> will be the first fixed point of a certain (continuous and non-decreasing) function <math>\\xi\\mapsto h(\\psi(\\xi))</math>.  To find it, apply the same rules (from the base <math>\\Omega</math> representation of <math>\\alpha</math>) as to find the canonical sequence of <math>\\alpha</math>, except that whenever a sequence converging to <math>\\Omega</math> is called for (something which cannot exist), replace the <math>\\Omega</math> in question, in the expression of <math>\\alpha = h(\\Omega)</math>, by a <math>\\psi(\\xi)</math> (where <math>\\xi</math> is a variable) and perform a repeated iteration (starting from <math>0</math>, say) of the function <math>\\xi\\mapsto h(\\psi(\\xi))</math>: this gives a sequence <math>0</math>, <math>h(\\psi(0))</math>, <math>h(\\psi(h(\\psi(0))))</math>… tending to <math>\\rho</math>, and the canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\alpha) = \\psi(\\rho)</math> is <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(h(\\psi(0)))</math>, <math>\\psi(h(\\psi(h(\\psi(0)))))</math>… If we let the <math>n</math>th element (starting at <math>0</math>) of the fundamental sequence for <math>\\delta</math> be denoted as <math>\\delta[n]</math>, then we can state this more clearly using recursion. Using this notation, we can see that <math>\\delta[0] = \\psi(0)</math> quite easily. We can define the rest of the sequence using recursion: <math>\\delta[n] = \\psi(h(\\delta[n-1]))</math>. (The examples below should make this clearer.)\n\nHere are some examples for the last (and most interesting) case:\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\psi(0))</math>, <math>\\psi(\\psi(\\psi(0)))</math>…  This indeed converges to <math>\\rho = \\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math> after which <math>\\psi</math> is constant until <math>\\Omega</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega 2)</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+\\psi(0))</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+\\psi(\\Omega+\\psi(0)))</math>…  This indeed converges to the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\rho = \\Omega + \\psi(\\Omega 2) = \\Omega + \\zeta_1</math> after which <math>\\psi</math> is constant until <math>\\Omega 2</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2)</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega\\psi(0))</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega\\psi(\\Omega\\psi(0)))</math>…  This converges to the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\rho = \\Omega \\psi(\\Omega^2)</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2 3 + \\Omega)</math> is <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2 3 + \\psi(0))</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2 3 + \\psi(\\Omega^2 3 + \\psi(0)))</math>…  This converges to the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\rho = \\Omega^2 3 + \\psi(\\Omega^2 3 + \\Omega)</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega)</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(0)})</math>,

2+\\Omega^{\\psi(0)})})</math>…  This converges to the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\rho = \\Omega^\\Omega 2 + \\Omega^{\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega 3)}</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega+1})</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega \\psi(0))</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega \\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega \\psi(0)))</math>…  This converges to the value of <math>\\psi</math> at <math>\\rho = \\Omega^\\Omega \\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega+1})</math>.\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2+\\Omega 3})</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2+\\Omega 2+\\psi(0)})</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2+\\Omega 2+\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2+\\Omega 2+\\psi(0)})})</math>…\n\nHere are some examples of the other cases:\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\omega^2</math> is: <math>0</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega 2</math>, <math>\\omega 3</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\omega^\\omega)</math> is: <math>\\psi(1)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\omega^2)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\omega^3)</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^\\omega</math> is: <math>1</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^2</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^3</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math> is: <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega)}</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega)^{\\psi(\\Omega)}}</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega+\\omega)</math> is: <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+2)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+3)</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega\\omega)</math> is: <math>\\psi(0)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega 2)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega 3)</math>…\n* The canonical sequence for

from the fundamental sequence for <math>\\psi(0)</math>).\n* The canonical sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(\\Omega)})</math> is: <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(0)})</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(\\psi(0))})</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\psi(\\psi(\\psi(0)))})</math>… (this is derived from the fundamental sequence for <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, which was given above).\n\nEven though the Bachmann–Howard ordinal <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})</math> itself has no canonical notation, it is also useful to define a canonical sequence for it: this is <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\Omega)</math>, <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\Omega})</math>…\n\n=== A terminating process ===\nStart with any ordinal less than or equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, and repeat the following process so long as it is not zero:\n* if the ordinal is a successor, subtract one (that is, replace it with its predecessor),\n* if it is a limit, replace it by some element of the canonical sequence defined for it.\nThen it is true that this process always terminates (as any decreasing sequence of ordinals is finite); however, like (but even more so than for) the [[Goodstein's theorem|hydra game]]:\n# it can take a ''very'' long time to terminate,\n# the proof of termination may be out of reach of certain weak systems of arithmetic.\n\nTo give some flavor of what the process feels like, here are some steps of it: starting from <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\omega})</math> (the small Veblen ordinal), we might go down to <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^3})</math>, from there down to <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\psi(0)})</math>, then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^\\omega})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^3})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^2 7})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 (\\omega^2 6 + \\omega)})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 (\\omega^2 6 + 1)})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^2 6 + \\Omega \\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^2 6 + \\Omega \\psi(0)})})</math> then <math>\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^2 6 + \\Omega \\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^2 \\omega^2 6 + \\Omega \\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}})})</math> and so on.  It appears as though the expressions are getting more and more complicated whereas, in fact, the ordinals always decrease.\n\nConcerning the first statement, one could introduce, for any ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> less or equal to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})</math>, the integer function <math>f_\\alpha(n)</math> which counts the number of steps of the process before termination if one always selects the <math>n</math>'th element from the canonical sequence (this function satisfies the identity <math>f_\\alpha(n) = f_{\\alpha[n]}(n) + 1</math>).  Then <math>f_\\alpha</math> can be a very fast growing function: already <math>f_{\\omega^\\omega}(n)</math> is essentially <math>n^n</math>, the function <math>f_{\\psi(\\Omega^\\omega)}(n)</math> is comparable with the [[Ackermann function]] <math>A(n,n)</math>, and <math>f_{\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})}(n)</math> is comparable with the [[Goodstein's theorem|Goodstein function]]. If we instead make a function that satisfies the identity <math>g_\\alpha(n) = g_{\\alpha[n]}(n+1) + 1</math>, so the index of the function increases it is applied, then we create a much faster growing function: <math>g_{\\psi(0)}(n)</math> is already comparable to the Goodstein function, and <math>g_{\\psi(\\Omega^{\\Omega^\\omega \\omega})}(n)</math> is comparable to the [[Kruskal's tree theorem|TREE]] function.\n\nConcerning the second statement, a precise version is given by [[ordinal analysis]]: for example, [[Kripke–Platek set theory]] can prove<ref name=\"Rathjen-slides-part3\">Rathjen, 2005 (Fischbachau slides)</ref> that the process terminates for any given <math>\\alpha</math> less than the Bachmann–Howard ordinal, but it cannot do this uniformly, i.e., it cannot prove the termination starting from the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  Some theories like [[Peano arithmetic]] are limited by much smaller ordinals (<math>\\varepsilon_0</math> in the case of Peano arithmetic).\n\n== Variations on the example ==\n\n=== Making the function ''less'' powerful ===\nIt is instructive (although not exactly useful) to make <math>\\psi</math> less powerful.\n\nIf we alter the definition of <math>\\psi</math> above to omit exponentiation from the repertoire from which <math>C(\\alpha)</math> is constructed, then we get <math>\\psi(0) = \\omega^\\omega</math> (as this is the smallest ordinal which cannot be constructed from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math> and <math>\\omega</math> using addition and multiplication only), then <math>\\psi(1) = \\omega^{\\omega^2}</math> and similarly <math>\\psi(\\omega) = \\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}</math>, <math>\\psi(\\psi(0)) = \\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega^\\omega}}</math> until we come to a fixed point which is then our <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\varepsilon_0</math>.  We then have <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1) = {\\varepsilon_0}^\\omega</math> and so on until <math>\\psi(\\Omega 2) = \\varepsilon_1</math>.  Since multiplication of <math>\\Omega</math>'s is permitted, we can still form <math>\\psi(\\Omega^2) = \\phi_2(0)</math> and <math>\\psi(\\Omega^3) = \\phi_3(0)</math> and so on, but our construction ends there as there is no way to get at or beyond <math>\\Omega^\\omega</math>: so the range of this weakened system of notation is <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\omega) = \\phi_\\omega(0)</math> (the value of <math>\\psi(\\Omega^\\omega)</math> is the same in our weaker system as in our original system, except that now we cannot go beyond it).  This does not even go as far as the Feferman–Schütte ordinal.\n\nIf we alter the definition of <math>\\psi</math> yet some more to allow only addition as a primitive for construction, we get <math>\\psi(0) = \\omega^2</math> and <math>\\psi(1) = \\omega^3</math> and so on until <math>\\psi(\\psi(0)) = \\omega^{\\omega^2}</math> and still <math>\\psi(\\Omega) = \\varepsilon_0</math>.  This time, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1) = \\varepsilon_0 \\omega</math> and so on until <math>\\psi(\\Omega 2) = \\varepsilon_1</math> and similarly <math>\\psi(\\Omega 3) = \\varepsilon_2</math>.  But this time we can go no further: since we can only add <math>\\Omega</math>'s, the range of our system is <math>\\psi(\\Omega\\omega) = \\varepsilon_\\omega = \\phi_1(\\omega)</math>.\n\nIn both cases, we find that the limitation on the weakened <math>\\psi</math> function comes not so much from the operations allowed on the ''countable'' ordinals as on the ''uncountable'' ordinals we allow ourselves to denote.\n\n=== Going beyond the Bachmann–Howard ordinal ===\nWe know that <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1})</math> is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  The reason why <math>\\psi(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}+1)</math> is no larger, with our definitions, is that there is no notation for <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math> (it does not belong to <math>C(\\alpha)</math> for any <math>\\alpha</math>, it is always the least upper bound of it).  One could try to add the <math>\\varepsilon</math> function (or the Veblen functions of so-many-variables) to the allowed primitives beyond addition, multiplication and exponentiation, but that does not get us very far.  To create more systematic notations for countable ordinals, we need more systematic notations for uncountable ordinals: we cannot use the <math>\\psi</math> function itself because it only yields countable ordinals (e.g., <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math> is, <math>\\varepsilon_{\\phi_2(0)+1}</math>, certainly not <math>\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>), so the idea is to mimic its definition as follows:\n\n:Let <math>\\psi_1(\\alpha)</math> be the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from all countable ordinals, <math>\\Omega</math> and <math>\\Omega_2</math> using sums, products, exponentials, and the <math>\\psi_1</math> function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than <math>\\alpha</math>).\n\nHere, <math>\\Omega_2</math> is a new ordinal guaranteed to be greater than all the ordinals which will be constructed using <math>\\psi_1</math>: again, letting <math>\\Omega = \\omega_1</math> and <math>\\Omega_2 = \\omega_2</math> works.\n\nFor example, <math>\\psi_1(0) = \\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}</math>, and more generally <math>\\psi_1(\\alpha) = \\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1+\\alpha}</math> for all countable ordinals and even beyond (<math>\\psi_1(\\Omega) = \\varepsilon_{\\Omega 2}</math> and <math>\\psi_1(\\psi_1(0)) = \\varepsilon_{\\varepsilon_{\\Omega+1}}</math>): this holds up to the first fixed point <math>\\zeta_{\\Omega+1}</math> beyond <math>\\Omega</math> of the <math>\\xi\\mapsto\\varepsilon_\\xi</math> function, which is the limit of <math>\\psi_1(0)</math>, <math>\\psi_1(\\psi_1(0))</math> and so forth.  Beyond this, we have <math>\\psi_1(\\alpha) = \\zeta_{\\Omega+1}</math> and this remains true until <math>\\Omega_2</math>: exactly as was the case for <math>\\psi(\\Omega)</math>, we have <math>\\psi_1(\\Omega_2) = \\zeta_{\\Omega+1}</math> and <math>\\psi_1(\\Omega_2+1) = \\varepsilon_{\\zeta_{\\Omega+1}+1}</math>.\n\nThe <math>\\psi_1</math> function gives us a system of notations (''assuming'' we can somehow write down all countable ordinals!) for the uncountable ordinals below <math>\\psi_1(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_2+1})</math>, which is the limit of <math>\\psi_1(\\Omega_2)</math>, <math>\\psi_1({\\Omega_2}^{\\Omega_2})</math> and so forth.\n\nNow we can reinject these notations in the original <math>\\psi</math> function, modified as follows:\n:<math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math> and <math>\\Omega_2</math> using sums, products, exponentials, the <math>\\psi_1</math> function, and the <math>\\psi</math> function itself (to previously constructed ordinals less than <math>\\alpha</math>).\n\nThis modified function <math>\\psi</math> coincides with the previous one up to (and including) <math>\\psi(\\psi_1(0))</math> &mdash; which is the Bachmann–Howard ordinal.  But now we can get beyond this, and <math>\\psi(\\psi_1(0)+1)</math> is <math>\\varepsilon_{\\psi(\\psi_1(0))+1}</math> (the next <math>\\varepsilon</math>-number after the Bachmann–Howard ordinal).  We have made our system ''doubly'' impredicative: to create notations for countable ordinals we use notations for certain ordinals between <math>\\Omega</math> and <math>\\Omega_2</math> which are themselves defined using certain ordinals beyond <math>\\Omega_2</math>.\n\nA variation on this scheme, which makes little difference when using just two (or finitely many) collapsing functions, but becomes important for infinitely many of them, is to define\n:<math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is the smallest ordinal which cannot be expressed from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math> and <math>\\Omega_2</math> using sums, products, exponentials, and the <math>\\psi_1</math> and <math>\\psi</math> function (to previously constructed ordinals less than <math>\\alpha</math>).\ni.e., allow the use of <math>\\psi_1</math> only for arguments less than <math>\\alpha</math> itself.  With this definition, we must write <math>\\psi(\\Omega_2)</math> instead of <math>\\psi(\\psi_1(\\Omega_2))</math> (although it is still also equal to <math>\\psi(\\psi_1(\\Omega_2)) = \\psi(\\zeta_{\\Omega+1})</math>, of course, but it is now constant until <math>\\Omega_2</math>).  This change is inessential because, intuitively speaking, the <math>\\psi_1</math> function collapses the nameable ordinals beyond <math>\\Omega_2</math> below the latter so it matters little whether <math>\\psi</math> is invoked directly on the ordinals beyond <math>\\Omega_2</math> or on their image by <math>\\psi_1</math>.  But it makes it possible to define <math>\\psi</math> and <math>\\psi_1</math> by ''simultaneous'' (rather than “downward”) induction, and this is important if we are to use infinitely many collapsing functions.\n\nIndeed, there is no reason to stop at two levels: using <math>\\omega+1</math> new cardinals in this way, <math>\\Omega_1,\\Omega_2,\\ldots,\\Omega_\\omega</math>, we get a system essentially equivalent to that introduced by Buchholz,<ref name=\"Buchholz\"/> the inessential difference being that since Buchholz uses <math>\\omega+1</math> ordinals from the start, he does not need to allow multiplication or exponentiation; also, Buchholz does not introduce the numbers <math>1</math> or <math>\\omega</math> in the system as they will also be produced by the <math>\\psi</math> functions: this makes the entire scheme much more elegant and more concise to define, albeit more difficult to understand.  This system is also sensibly equivalent to the earlier (and much more difficult to grasp) “ordinal diagrams” of Takeuti<ref>Takeuti, 1967 (Ann. Math.)</ref> and <math>\\theta</math> functions of Feferman: their range is the same (<math>\\psi_0(\\varepsilon_{\\Omega_\\omega+1})</math>, which could be called the Takeuti-Feferman–Buchholz ordinal, and which describes the [[ordinal analysis|strength]] of [[Second-order arithmetic#Stronger systems|<math>\\Pi^1_1</math>-comprehension]] plus [[bar induction]]).\n\n=== A \"normal\" variant ===\nMost definitions of ordinal collapsing functions found in the recent literature differ from the ones we have given in one technical but important way which makes them technically more convenient although intuitively less transparent.  We now explain this.\n\nThe following definition (by induction on <math>\\alpha</math>) is completely equivalent to that of the function <math>\\psi</math> [[#Definition|above]]:\n\n:Let <math>C(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> be the set of ordinals generated starting from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math> and all ordinals less than <math>\\beta</math> by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function <math>\\psi\\upharpoonright_\\alpha</math>.  Then <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is defined as the smallest ordinal <math>\\rho</math> such that <math>C(\\alpha,\\rho) \\cap \\Omega = \\rho</math>.\n\n(This is equivalent, because if <math>\\sigma</math> is the smallest ordinal not in <math>C(\\alpha,0)</math>, which is how we originally defined <math>\\psi(\\alpha)</math>, then it is also the smallest ordinal not in <math>C(\\alpha,0) = C(\\alpha,\\sigma)</math>, and furthermore the properties we described of <math>\\psi</math> imply that no ordinal between <math>\\sigma</math> inclusive and <math>\\Omega</math> exclusive belongs to <math>C(\\alpha,\\sigma)</math>.)\n\nWe can now make a change to the definition which makes it subtly different:\n\n:Let <math>\\tilde C(\\alpha,\\beta)</math> be the set of ordinals generated starting from <math>0</math>, <math>1</math>, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\Omega</math> and all ordinals less than <math>\\beta</math> by recursively applying the following functions: ordinal addition, multiplication and exponentiation, and the function <math>\\tilde\\psi\\upharpoonright_\\alpha</math>.  Then <math>\\tilde\\psi(\\alpha)</math> is defined as the smallest ordinal <math>\\rho</math> such that <math>\\tilde C(\\alpha,\\rho) \\cap \\Omega = \\rho</math> and <math>\\alpha \\in \\tilde C(\\alpha,\\rho)</math>.\n\nThe first values of <math>\\tilde\\psi</math> coincide with those of <math>\\psi</math>: namely, for all <math>\\alpha<\\zeta_0</math> where <math>\\zeta_0 = \\varphi_2(0)</math>, we have <math>\\tilde\\psi(\\alpha) = \\psi(\\alpha)</math> because the additional clause <math>\\alpha \\in \\tilde C(\\alpha,\\rho)</math> is always satisfied.  But at this point the functions start to differ: while the function <math>\\psi</math> gets “stuck” at <math>\\zeta_0</math> for all <math>\\zeta_0 \\leq \\alpha \\leq \\Omega</math>, the function <math>\\tilde\\psi</math> satisfies <math>\\tilde\\psi(\\zeta_0) = \\varepsilon_{\\zeta_0+1}</math> because the new condition <math>\\alpha \\in \\tilde C(\\alpha,\\rho)</math> imposes <math>\\tilde\\psi(\\zeta_0) > \\zeta_0</math>.  On the other hand, we still have <math>\\tilde\\psi(\\Omega) = \\zeta_0</math> (because <math>\\Omega \\in C(\\alpha,\\rho)</math> for all <math>\\rho</math> so the extra condition does not come in play).  Note in particular that <math>\\tilde\\psi</math>, unlike <math>\\psi</math>, is not monotonic, nor is it continuous.\n\nDespite these changes, the <math>\\tilde\\psi</math> function also defines a system of ordinal notations up to the Bachmann–Howard ordinal: the notations, and the conditions for canonicalness, are slightly different (for example, <math>\\psi(\\Omega+1+\\alpha) = \\tilde\\psi(\\tilde\\psi(\\Omega)+\\alpha)</math> for all <math>\\alpha</math> less than the common value <math>\\psi(\\Omega2) = \\tilde\\psi(\\Omega+1)</math>).\n\n== Collapsing large cardinals ==\nAs noted in the introduction, the use and definition of ordinal collapsing functions is strongly connected with the theory of [[ordinal analysis]], so the collapse of this or that large cardinal must be mentioned simultaneously with the theory for which it provides a proof-theoretic analysis.\n\n* Gerhard Jäger and Wolfram Pohlers<ref>Jäger & Pohlers, 1983 (Bayer. Akad. Wiss. Math.-Natur. Kl. Sitzungsber.)</ref> described the collapse of an [[inaccessible cardinal]] to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by the recursive inaccessibility of the class of ordinals ('''KPi'''), which is also proof-theoretically equivalent<ref name=\"Rathjen-survey\"/> to <math>\\Delta^1_2</math>-comprehension plus [[bar induction]].  Roughly speaking, this collapse can be obtained by adding the <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\Omega_\\alpha</math> function itself to the list of constructions to which the <math>C(\\cdot)</math> collapsing system applies.\n* Michael Rathjen<ref>Rathjen, 1991 (Arch. Math. Logic)</ref> then described the collapse of a [[Mahlo cardinal]] to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by the recursive mahloness of the class of ordinals ('''KPM''').\n* Rathjen<ref>Rathjen, 1994 (Ann. Pure Appl. Logic)</ref> later described the collapse of a [[weakly compact cardinal]] to describe the ordinal-theoretic strength of Kripke–Platek set theory augmented by certain [[reflection principle]]s (concentrating on the case of <math>\\Pi_3</math>-reflection).  Very roughly speaking, this proceeds by introducing the first cardinal <math>\\Xi(\\alpha)</math> which is <math>\\alpha</math>-hyper-Mahlo and adding the <math>\\alpha \\mapsto \\Xi(\\alpha)</math> function itself to the collapsing system.\n* Rathjen has begun{{When|date=October 2018}}<ref>Rathjen, 2005 (Arch. Math. Logic)</ref> the investigation of the collapse of yet larger cardinals, with the ultimate goal of achieving an ordinal analysis of <math>\\Pi^1_2</math>-comprehension (which is proof-theoretically equivalent to the augmentation of Kripke–Platek by <math>\\Sigma_1</math>-separation).\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal | last=Takeuti | first=Gaisi | authorlink=Gaisi Takeuti | title=Consistency proofs of subsystems of classical analysis | journal=Annals of Mathematics | volume=86 | year=1967 | pages=299&ndash;348 | doi=10.2307/1970691 | issue=2 | jstor=1970691 }}\n* {{cite journal | last=Jäger | first=Gerhard |author2=Pohlers, Wolfram | title=Eine beweistheoretische Untersuchung von (<math>\\Delta^1_2</math>-CA)+(BI) und verwandter Systeme | journal=Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_notation",
      "text": "In [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]], an '''ordinal notation''' is a partial function from the set of all finite sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet to a countable set of [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and a [[Gödel numbering]] is a function from the set of well-formed formulae (a well-formed formula is a finite sequence of symbols on which the ordinal notation function is defined) of some formal language to the natural numbers. This associates each wff with a unique natural number, called its Gödel number. If a Gödel numbering is fixed, then the subset relation on the ordinals induces an ordering on well-formed formulae which in turn induces a well-ordering on the subset of natural numbers. A '''recursive ordinal notation''' must satisfy the following two additional properties:\n\n# the subset of natural numbers is a [[recursive set]]\n# the induced well-ordering on the subset of natural numbers is a recursive relation\n\nThere are many such schemes of ordinal notations, including schemes by [[Wilhelm Ackermann]], [[Heinz Bachmann]], Wilfried Buchholz, [[Georg Cantor]], [[Solomon Feferman]], Gerhard Jäger, Isles, Pfeiffer,   Wolfram Pohlers, [[Kurt Schütte]], [[Gaisi Takeuti]] (called '''ordinal diagrams'''),  [[Oswald Veblen]]. [[Stephen Cole Kleene]] has a system of notations, called [[Kleene's O]], which includes ordinal notations but it is not as well behaved as the other systems described here.\n\nUsually one proceeds by defining several functions from ordinals to ordinals and representing each such function by a symbol. In many systems, such as Veblen's well known system, the functions are normal functions, that is, they are strictly increasing and continuous in at least one of their arguments, and increasing in other arguments. Another desirable property for such functions is that the value of the function is greater than each of its arguments, so that an ordinal is always being described in terms of smaller ordinals. There are several such desirable properties. Unfortunately, no one system can have all of them since they contradict each other.\n\n==A simplified example using a pairing function==\nAs usual, we must start off with a constant symbol for zero, \"0\", which we may consider to be a function of [[arity]] zero. This is necessary because there are no smaller ordinals in terms of which zero can be described.  The most obvious next step would be to define a unary function, \"S\", which takes an ordinal to the smallest ordinal greater than it; in other words, S is the successor function. In combination with zero, successor allows one to name any natural number.\n\nThe third function might be defined as one that maps each ordinal to the smallest ordinal that cannot yet be described with the above two functions and previous values of this function. This would map β to ω&middot;β except when β is a fixed point of that function plus a finite number in which case one uses ω&middot;(β+1).\n\nThe fourth function would map α to ω<sup>ω</sup>&middot;α except when α is a fixed point of that plus a finite number in which case one uses ω<sup>ω</sup>&middot;(α+1).\n\n===&xi;-notation===\n\nOne could continue in this way, but it would give us an infinite number of functions. So instead let us merge the unary functions into a binary function. By [[transfinite recursion]] on α, we can use transfinite recursion on β to define ξ(α,β) = the smallest ordinal γ such that α < γ and β < γ and γ is not the value of ξ for any smaller α or for the same α with a smaller β.\n\nThus, define ξ-notations as follows:\n*\"0\" is a ξ-notation for zero.\n*If \"A\" and \"B\" are replaced by ξ-notations for &alpha; and &beta; in \"ξAB\", then the result is a ξ-notation for ξ(α,β).\n*There are no other ξ-notations.\n\nξ is defined for all pairs of ordinals and is one-to-one.  It always gives values larger than its arguments and its [[Range (mathematics)|range]] is all ordinals other than 0 and the epsilon numbers (ε=ω<sup>ε</sup>).\n\nξ(α,β)<ξ(γ,δ) if and only if either (α=γ and β<δ) or (α<γ and β<ξ(γ,δ)) or (α>γ and ξ(α,β)≤δ).\n\nWith this definition, the first few &xi;-notations are:\n:\"0\" for 0. \"ξ00\" for 1. \"ξ0ξ00\" for ξ(0,1)=2. \"ξξ000\" for ξ(1,0)=ω. \"ξ0ξ0ξ00\" for 3. \"ξ0ξξ000\" for ω+1. \"ξξ00ξ00\" for ω&middot;2. \"ξξ0ξ000\" for ω<sup>ω</sup>. \"ξξξ0000\" for <math>\\omega^{\\omega^{\\omega}}.</math>\n\nIn general, ξ(0,β) = β+1. While ξ(1+α,β) = ω<sup>ω<sup>α</sup></sup>&middot;(β+k) for k = 0 or 1 or 2 depending on special situations:<br>\nk = 2 if α is an epsilon number and β is finite.<br>\nOtherwise, k = 1 if β is a multiple of ω<sup>ω<sup>α+1</sup></sup> plus a finite number.<br>\nOtherwise, k = 0.\n\nThe ξ-notations can be used to name any ordinal less than &epsilon;<sub>0</sub> with an alphabet of only two symbols (\"0\" and \"ξ\"). If these notations are extended by adding functions that enumerate epsilon numbers, then they will be able to name any ordinal less than the first epsilon number that cannot be named by the added functions. This last property, adding symbols within an initial segment of the ordinals gives names within that segment, is called repleteness (after [[Solomon Feferman]]).\n\n==Systems of ordinal notation==\nThere are many different systems for ordinal notation introduced by various authors. It is often quite hard to convert between the different systems.\n\n===Cantor===\n{{main|Cantor normal form}}\n\"Exponential polynomials\" in 0 and &omega; gives a system of ordinal notation for ordinals less than [[epsilon zero]]. There are many equivalent ways to write these; instead of exponential polynomials, one can use rooted trees, or nested parentheses, or the system described above.\n\n===Veblen===\n{{main|Veblen function}}\nThe 2-variable Veblen functions {{harv|Veblen|1908}} can be used to give a system of ordinal notation for ordinals less than the [[Feferman-Schutte ordinal]]. The Veblen functions in a finite or transfinite number of variables give systems of ordinal notations for ordinals less than the small and large [[Veblen ordinal (disambiguation)|Veblen ordinal]]s.\n\n===Ackermann===\n{{harvtxt|Ackermann|1951}} described a system of ordinal notation rather weaker than the system described earlier by Veblen. The limit of his system is sometimes called the [[Ackermann ordinal]].\n\n===Bachmann===\n{{harvtxt|Bachmann|1950}} introduced the key idea of using uncountable ordinals to produce new countable ordinals. His original system was rather cumbersome to use as it required choosing a special sequence converging to each ordinal. Later systems of notation introduced by Feferman and others avoided this complication.\n\n===Takeuti (ordinal diagrams)===\n{{harvtxt|Takeuti|1987}} described a very powerful system of ordinal notation called \"ordinal diagrams\", which is hard to understand but was later simplified by Feferman.\n\n===Feferman's &theta; functions===\nFeferman introduced theta functions, described in {{harvtxt|Buchholz|1986}} as follows. \nThe function for an ordinal &alpha;, &theta;<sub>&alpha;</sub> is a function from ordinals to ordinals. \nOften &theta;<sub>&alpha;</sub>(&beta;) is written as &theta;&alpha;&beta;. The set ''C''(&alpha;,&beta;) is defined by induction on &alpha; to be the set of ordinals that can be generated from 0, [[First uncountable ordinal|&omega;<sub>1</sub>]], &omega;<sub>2</sub>, ..., &omega;<sub>&omega;</sub>, together with the ordinals less than &beta; by the operations of ordinal addition and the functions &theta;<sub>&xi;</sub> for &xi;<&alpha;. And the function &theta;<sub>&gamma;</sub> is defined to be the function enumerating the ordinals &delta; with &delta;&notin;''C''(&gamma;,&delta;).\n\n===Buchholz===\n{{main|Ordinal collapsing function}}\n{{harvtxt|Buchholz|1986}} described the following system of ordinal notation as a simplification of Feferman's theta functions. Define:\n*&Omega;<sub>&xi;</sub> = &omega;<sub>&xi;</sub> if &xi; > 0, &Omega;<sub>0</sub> = 1\nThe  functions &psi;<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;) for &alpha; an ordinal, ''v'' an ordinal at most &omega;, are defined by induction on &alpha; as follows: \n*&psi;<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;) is the smallest ordinal not in ''C''<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;)\nwhere ''C''<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;)  is the smallest set such that \n*''C''<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;) contains all ordinals less than &Omega;<sub>''v''</sub> \n*''C''<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;) is closed under ordinal addition\n*''C''<sub>''v''</sub>(&alpha;) is closed under the functions &psi;<sub>''u''</sub> (for ''u''&le;&omega;) applied to arguments less than &alpha;.\n\nThis system has about the same strength as Fefermans system, as <math>\\theta\\epsilon_{\\Omega_v+1}0 = \\psi_0(\\epsilon_{\\Omega_v+1})</math> for ''v''&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;&omega;.\n\n===Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>===\n{{main|Kleene's O}}\n{{harvtxt|Kleene|1938}} described a system of notation for all recursive ordinals (those less than the [[Church–Kleene ordinal]]). It uses a subset of the [[natural number]]s instead of finite strings of symbols. Unfortunately, unlike the other systems described above there is in general no [[computable function|effective]] way to tell whether some natural number represents an ordinal, or whether two numbers represent the same ordinal. However, one can effectively find notations that represent the ordinal sum, product, and power (see [[ordinal arithmetic]]) of any two given notations in Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math>; and given any notation for an ordinal, there is a [[recursively enumerable set]] of notations that contains one element for each smaller ordinal and is effectively ordered. Kleene's <math>\\mathcal{O}</math> denotes a canonical (and very non-computable) set of notations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Large countable ordinals]]\n*[[Ordinal arithmetic]]\n*[[Ordinal analysis]]\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n|last=Ackermann|first= Wilhelm\n|title=Konstruktiver Aufbau eines Abschnitts der zweiten Cantorschen Zahlenklasse\n|journal=Math.

The primitive recursive ordinal functions are the same as the primitive recursive set functions that map ordinals to ordinals.\n\nOne can also add more initial functions to obtain a larger class of functions.

      "text": "In [[set theory]], a '''regular cardinal''' is a  [[cardinal number]] that is equal to its own [[cofinality]]. So, crudely speaking, a regular cardinal is one that cannot be broken into a smaller collection of smaller parts.\n\nIf the [[axiom of choice]] holds (so that any cardinal number can be [[well-order]]ed), an infinite cardinal <math>\\kappa</math> is regular if and only if it cannot be expressed as the [[cardinal sum]] of a set of [[cardinality]] less than <math>\\kappa</math>, the elements of which are cardinals less than <math>\\kappa</math>. The situation is slightly more complicated in contexts where the [[axiom of choice]] might fail as in that case not all cardinals are necessarily the cardinalities of well-ordered sets. In that case, the above definition is restricted to well-orderable cardinals only.\n\nAn infinite ordinal <math>\\alpha</math> is a '''regular ordinal''' if it is a [[limit ordinal]] which is not the limit of a set of smaller ordinals which set has [[order type]] less than <math>\\alpha</math>. A regular ordinal is always an [[initial ordinal]], though some initial ordinals are not regular, e.g., <math>\\omega_\\omega</math> (see the example below).\n\nInfinite well-ordered cardinals that are not regular are called '''singular cardinals'''. Finite cardinal numbers are typically not called regular or singular.\n__NOTOC__\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe ordinals less than <math>\\omega</math> are finite. A finite sequence of finite ordinals always has a finite maximum, so <math>\\omega</math> cannot be the limit of any sequence of type less than <math>\\omega</math> whose elements are ordinals less than <math>\\omega</math>, and is therefore a regular ordinal. <math>\\aleph_0</math> ([[aleph-null]]) is a regular cardinal because its initial ordinal, <math>\\omega</math>, is regular. It can also be seen directly to be regular, as the cardinal sum of a finite number of finite cardinal numbers is itself finite.\n\n<math>\\omega+1</math> is the [[successor ordinal|next ordinal number]] greater than <math>\\omega</math>. It is singular, since it is not a limit ordinal. <math>\\omega+\\omega</math> is the next limit ordinal after <math>\\omega</math>. It can be written as the limit of the sequence <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega+1</math>, <math>\\omega+2</math>, <math>\\omega+3</math>, and so on. This sequence has order type <math>\\omega</math>, so <math>\\omega+\\omega</math> is the limit of a sequence of type less than <math>\\omega+\\omega</math> whose elements are ordinals less than <math>\\omega+\\omega</math>; therefore it is singular.\n\n<math>\\aleph_1</math> is the [[successor cardinal|next cardinal number]] greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math>, so the cardinals less than <math>\\aleph_1</math> are [[countable set|countable]] (finite or denumerable). Assuming the axiom of choice, the union of a countable set of countable sets is itself countable. So <math>\\aleph_1</math> cannot be written as the sum of a countable set of countable cardinal numbers, and is regular.\n\n<math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> is the next cardinal number after the sequence <math>\\aleph_0</math>, <math>\\aleph_1</math>, <math>\\aleph_2</math>, <math>\\aleph_3</math>, and so on. Its initial ordinal <math>\\omega_\\omega</math> is the limit of the sequence <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega_1</math>, <math>\\omega_2</math>, <math>\\omega_3</math>, and so on, which has order type <math>\\omega</math>, so <math>\\omega_\\omega</math> is singular, and so is <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math>. Assuming the axiom of choice, <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> is the first infinite cardinal which is singular (the first infinite ''ordinal'' which is singular is <math>\\omega+1</math>). Proving the existence of singular cardinals requires the [[axiom schema of replacement|axiom of replacement]], and in fact the inability to prove the existence of <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> in [[Zermelo set theory]] is what led [[Adolf Abraham Halevi Fraenkel|Fraenkel]] to postulate this axiom.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Maddy | first = Penelope | authorlink = Penelope Maddy\n | doi = 10.2307/2274520\n | jstor = 2274520\n | issue = 2\n | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]]\n | mr = 947855\n | pages = 481–511\n | quote =  Early hints of the Axiom of Replacement can be found in Cantor's letter to Dedekind [1899] and in Mirimanoff [1917]\n | title = Believing the axioms.

They cannot be proved to exist within ZFC, though their existence is not known to be inconsistent with ZFC. Their existence is sometimes taken as an additional axiom.  Inaccessible cardinals are necessarily [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of the [[aleph number|aleph function]], though not all fixed points are regular.  For instance, the first fixed point is the limit of the <math>\\omega</math>-sequence <math>\\aleph_0, \\aleph_{\\aleph_0}, \\aleph_{\\aleph_{\\aleph_0}}, ...</math> and is therefore singular.\n\nIf the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then every [[successor cardinal]] is regular.  Thus the regularity or singularity of most aleph numbers can be checked depending on whether the cardinal is a successor cardinal or a limit cardinal.  Some cardinal numbers cannot be proven to be equal to any particular aleph, for instance the [[cardinality of the continuum]], whose value in ZFC may be any uncountable cardinal of uncountable cofinality (see [[Easton's theorem]]). The [[continuum hypothesis]] postulates that the cardinality of the continuum is equal to <math>\\aleph_1</math> which is regular.\n\nWithout the axiom of choice, there would be cardinal numbers which were not well-orderable. Moreover, the cardinal sum of an arbitrary collection could not be defined. Therefore, only the [[aleph number]]s can meaningfully be called regular or singular cardinals. Furthermore, a successor aleph need not be regular. For instance, the union of a countable set of countable sets need not be countable. It is consistent with [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] that <math>\\omega_1</math> be the limit of a countable sequence of countable ordinals as well as the set of real numbers is countable union of countable sets. Furthermore, it is consistent with ZF that every aleph bigger than <math>\\aleph_0</math> is singular (a result proved by [[Moti Gitik]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Inaccessible cardinal]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{aut|[[Herbert Enderton|Herbert B.

Then <math>S\\subset\\kappa</math> is stationary in <math>\\kappa</math> if and only if <math>\\kappa\\setminus S</math> is bounded in <math>\\kappa</math>. In particular, if the cofinality of <math>\\kappa</math> is <math>\\omega=\\aleph_0</math>, then any two stationary subsets of <math>\\kappa</math> have stationary intersection.\n\nThis is no longer the case if the cofinality of <math>\\kappa</math> is uncountable. In fact, suppose <math>\\kappa</math> is [[regular cardinal|regular]] and <math>S\\subset\\kappa</math> is stationary. Then <math>S</math> can be partitioned into <math>\\kappa</math> many disjoint stationary sets. This result is due to [[Robert M. Solovay|Solovay]]. If <math>\\kappa</math> is a [[successor cardinal]], this result is due to [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] and is easily shown by means of what is called an '''Ulam matrix'''.\n\n[[Harvey Friedman|H. Friedman]] has shown that for every countable successor ordinal <math>\\beta</math>, every stationary subset of <math>\\omega_1</math> contains a closed subset of order type <math>\\beta</math> (Friedman).\n\n==Jech's notion==\nThere is also a notion of stationary subset of <math>[X]^\\lambda</math>, for <math>\\lambda</math> a cardinal and <math>X</math> a set such that <math>|X|\\ge\\lambda</math>, where <math>[X]^\\lambda</math> is the set of subsets of <math>X</math> of cardinality <math>\\lambda</math>: <math>[X]^\\lambda=\\{Y\\subset X:|Y|=\\lambda\\}</math>. This notion is due to [[Thomas Jech]]. As before, <math>S\\subset[X]^\\lambda</math> is stationary if and only if it meets every club, where a club subset of <math>[X]^\\lambda</math> is a set unbounded under <math>\\subset</math> and closed under union of chains of length at most <math>\\lambda</math>. These notions are in general different, although for <math>X=\\omega_1</math> and <math>\\lambda=\\aleph_0</math> they coincide in the sense that <math>S\\subset[\\omega_1]^\\omega</math> is stationary if and only if <math>S\\cap\\omega_1</math> is stationary in <math>\\omega_1</math>.\n\nThe appropriate version of Fodor's lemma also holds for this notion.\n\n==Generalized notion==\nThere is yet a third notion, model theoretic in nature and sometimes referred to as '''generalized''' stationarity. This notion is probably due to [[Menachem Magidor|Magidor]], [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]] and has also been used prominently by [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]].\n\nNow let <math>X</math> be a nonempty set. A set <math>C\\subset{\\mathcal P}(X)</math> is club (closed and unbounded) if and only if there is a function <math>F:[X]^{<\\omega}\\to X</math> such that <math>C=\\{z:F[[z]^{<\\omega}]\\subset z\\}</math>. Here, <math>[y]^{<\\omega}</math> is the collection of finite subsets of <math>y</math>.\n\n<math>S\\subset{\\mathcal P}(X)</math> is stationary in <math>{\\mathcal P}(X)</math> if and only if it meets every club subset of <math>{\\mathcal P}(X)</math>.\n\nTo see the connection with model theory, notice that if <math>M</math> is a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] with [[Universe (mathematics)|universe]] <math>X</math> in a countable language and <math>F</math> is a [[Skolem function]] for <math>M</math>, then a stationary <math>S</math> must contain an elementary substructure of <math>M</math>.

Instead, Turing investigated the possibility of resolving the Godelian incompleteness condition using Cantor’s method of infinites. This condition can be stated thus- in all systems with finite sets of axioms, an exclusive-or condition applies to expressive power and provability; ie one can have power and no proof, or proof and no power, but not both.\n\nThe thesis is an exploration of formal mathematical systems after [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]].  Gödel showed for that any formal system S powerful enough to represent arithmetic, there is a theorem G which is true but the system is unable to prove.  G could be added as an additional axiom to the system in place of a proof.  However this would create a new system S' with its own unprovable true theorem G', and so on.

Then transfinite induction tells us that P is true for all ordinals.\n\nUsually the proof is broken down into three cases:\n\n* '''Zero case:''' Prove that P(0) is true.\n* '''Successor case:''' Prove that for any [[successor ordinal]] α+1, P(α+1) follows from P(α) (and, if necessary, P(β) for all β < α).\n* '''Limit case:''' Prove that for any [[limit ordinal]] λ, P(λ) follows from [P(β) for all β < λ].\n\nAll three cases are identical except for the type of ordinal considered.  They do not formally need to be considered separately, but in practice the proofs are typically so different as to require separate presentations. Zero is sometimes considered a [[limit ordinal]] and then may sometimes be treated in proofs in the same case as limit ordinals.\n\n==Transfinite recursion==\n'''Transfinite recursion''' is similar to transfinite induction; however, instead of proving that something holds for all ordinal numbers, we construct a sequence of objects, one for each ordinal.\n\nAs an example, a basis for a (possibly infinite-dimensional) vector space can be created by choosing a vector <math>v_0</math> and for each ordinal α choosing a vector that is not in the span of the vectors <math>\\{v_{\\beta}\\mid\\beta<\\alpha\\}</math>. This process stops when no vector can be chosen.\n\nMore formally, we can state the Transfinite Recursion Theorem as follows:\n\n* '''Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 1)'''. Given a class function<ref>A class function is a rule (specifically, a logical formula) assigning each element in the lefthand class to an element in the righthand class. It is not a [[function (mathematics)|function]] because its domain and codomain are not sets.</ref> ''G'': ''V'' → ''V'' (where ''V'' is the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all sets), there exists a unique [[transfinite sequence]] ''F'': Ord → ''V'' (where Ord is the class of all ordinals) such that\n:''F''(α) = ''G''(''F'' <math>\\upharpoonright</math> α) for all ordinals α, where <math>\\upharpoonright</math> denotes the restriction of ''F'''s domain to ordinals < α.\n\nAs in the case of induction, we may treat different types of ordinals separately: another formulation of transfinite recursion is the following:\n\n* '''Transfinite Recursion Theorem (version 2)'''. Given a set ''g''<sub>1</sub>, and class functions ''G''<sub>2</sub>, ''G''<sub>3</sub>, there exists a unique function ''F'': Ord → ''V'' such that\n* ''F''(0) = ''g''<sub>1</sub>,\n* ''F''(α + 1) = ''G''<sub>2</sub>(''F''(α)), for all α ∈ Ord,\n* ''F''(λ) = ''G''<sub>3</sub>(''F'' <math>\\upharpoonright</math> λ), for all limit λ ≠ 0.\n\nNote that we require the domains of ''G''<sub>2</sub>, ''G''<sub>3</sub> to be broad enough to make the above properties meaningful.  The uniqueness of the sequence satisfying these properties can be proved using transfinite induction.\n\nMore generally, one can define objects by transfinite recursion on any [[well-founded relation]] ''R''. (''R'' need not even be a set; it can be a [[proper class]], provided it is a [[binary relation#Relations over a set|set-like]] relation; that is, for any ''x'', the collection of all ''y'' such that ''y R x'' must be a set.)\n\n==Relationship to the axiom of choice==\nProofs or constructions using induction and recursion often use the [[axiom of choice]] to produce a well-ordered relation that can be treated by transfinite induction. However, if the relation in question is already well-ordered, one can often use transfinite induction without invoking the axiom of choice.<ref>In fact, the domain of the relation does not even need to be a set. It can be a proper class, provided that the relation ''R'' is set-like: for any ''x'', the collection of all ''y'' such that ''y''&nbsp;''R''&nbsp;''x'' must be a set.</ref> For example, many results about [[Borel sets]] are proved by transfinite induction on the ordinal rank of the set; these ranks are already well-ordered, so the axiom of choice is not needed to well-order them.\n\nThe following construction of the [[Vitali set]] shows one way that the axiom of choice can be used in a proof by transfinite induction:\n: First, [[well-order]] the [[real number]]s (this is where the axiom of choice enters via the [[well-ordering theorem]]), giving a sequence <math> \\langle r_{\\alpha} | \\alpha < \\beta \\rangle </math>, where &beta; is an ordinal with the [[cardinality of the continuum]].  Let ''v''<sub>0</sub> equal ''r''<sub>0</sub>.  Then let ''v''<sub>1</sub> equal ''r''<sub>α<sub>1</sub></sub>, where α<sub>1</sub> is least such that ''r''<sub>α<sub>1</sub></sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''v''<sub>0</sub> is not a [[rational number]].  Continue; at each step use the least real from the ''r'' sequence that does not have a rational difference with any element thus far constructed in the ''v'' sequence.  Continue until all the reals in the ''r'' sequence are exhausted.  The final ''v'' sequence will enumerate the Vitali set.\nThe above argument uses the axiom of choice in an essential way at the very beginning, in order to well-order the reals. After that step, the axiom of choice is not used again.\n\nOther uses of the axiom of choice are more subtle. For example, a construction by transfinite recursion frequently will not specify a ''unique'' value for ''A''<sub>α+1</sub>, given the sequence up to α, but will specify only a ''condition'' that ''A''<sub>α+1</sub> must satisfy, and argue that there is at least one set satisfying this condition. If it is not possible to define a unique example of such a set at each stage, then it may be necessary to invoke (some form of) the axiom of choice to select one such at each step.  For inductions and recursions of [[countable set|countable]] length, the weaker [[axiom of dependent choice]] is sufficient. Because there are models of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] of interest to set theorists that satisfy the axiom of dependent choice but not the full axiom of choice, the knowledge that a particular proof only requires dependent choice can be useful.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mathematical induction]]\n* [[Epsilon-induction|∈-induction]]\n* [[Transfinite number]]\n* [[Well-founded relation#Induction and recursion|Well-founded induction]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citation|last=Suppes|first=Patrick|authorlink=Patrick Suppes|year=1972|title=Axiomatic set theory|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|isbn=0-486-61630-4|chapter=Section 7.1}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{MathWorld |title=Transfinite Induction |id=TransfiniteInduction |author=[[Jonathan Emerson|Emerson, Jonathan]], [[Mark Lezama|Lezama, Mark]] and [[Eric W.

      "text": "{{short description|Number that is larger than all finite numbers}}\n'''Transfinite numbers''' are numbers that are \"[[Infinity|infinite]]\" in the sense that they are larger than all [[finite set|finite]] numbers, yet not necessarily [[absolutely infinite]]. The term ''transfinite'' was coined by [[Georg Cantor]], who wished to avoid some of the implications of the word ''infinite'' in connection with these objects, which were, nevertheless, not ''finite''. Few contemporary writers share these qualms; it is now accepted usage to refer to transfinite [[cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] as \"infinite\". However, the term \"transfinite\" also remains in use.\n\n==Definition==\nAny finite number can be used in at least two ways: as an ordinal and as a cardinal.  Cardinal numbers specify the size of sets (e.g., a bag of five marbles), whereas ordinal numbers specify the order of a member within an ordered set (e.g., \"the third man from the left\" or \"the twenty-seventh day of January\").  When extended to transfinite numbers, these two concepts become distinct.  A transfinite cardinal number is used to describe the size of an infinitely large set, while a transfinite ordinal is used to describe the location within an infinitely large set that's ordered.  The most notable ordinal and cardinal numbers are, respectively:\n\n* [[Ordinal number#Ordinals extend the natural numbers|ω]] (omega) is defined as the lowest transfinite ordinal number and is the [[order type]] of the [[natural number]]s under their usual linear ordering.\n* [[Aleph-naught]], <math>\\aleph_0,</math> is defined as the first transfinite cardinal number and is the [[cardinality]] of the [[infinite set]] of the natural numbers. If the [[axiom of choice]] holds, the next higher cardinal number is [[aleph-one]], <math>\\aleph_1.</math> If not, there may be other cardinals which are incomparable with aleph-one and larger than aleph-naught. But in any case, there are no cardinals between aleph-naught and aleph-one.\n\nThe [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there are no intermediate cardinal numbers between aleph-null and the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (the set of [[real number]]s): that is to say, aleph-one is the cardinality of the set of real numbers. (If [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC) is consistent, then neither the continuum hypothesis nor its negation can be proven from ZFC.)\n\nSome authors, including P. Suppes and J. Rubin, use the term ''transfinite cardinal'' to refer to the cardinality of a [[Dedekind-infinite set]], in contexts where this may not be equivalent to \"infinite cardinal\"; that is, in contexts where the [[axiom of countable choice]] is not assumed or is not known to hold. Given this definition, the following are all equivalent:\n* <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> is a transfinite cardinal. That is, there is a Dedekind infinite set ''A'' such that the cardinality of ''A'' is <math>\\mathfrak {m}.</math>\n* <math>\\mathfrak{m} + 1 = \\mathfrak{m}.</math>\n* <math>\\aleph_0 \\leq \\mathfrak{m}.</math>\n* There is a cardinal <math>\\mathfrak{n}</math> such that <math>\\aleph_0 + \\mathfrak{n} = \\mathfrak{m}.</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|transfinite}}\n{{div col|colwidth=20em|small=yes}}\n*[[Absolutely infinite]]\n*[[Aleph number]]\n*[[Beth number]]\n*[[Georg Cantor]]\n*[[Cardinal number]]\n*[[Inaccessible cardinal]]\n*[[Infinity plus one]]\n*[[Infinitesimal]]\n*[[Large cardinal]]\n*[[Large countable ordinal]]\n*[[Limit ordinal]]\n*[[Mahlo cardinal]]\n*[[Measurable cardinal]]\n*[[Ordinal arithmetic]]\n*[[Ordinal number]]\n*[[Transfinite induction]]\n*[[Infinite-valued logic]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n*Levy, Azriel, 2002 (1978) ''Basic Set Theory''.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''Veblen functions''' are a hierarchy of [[normal function]]s ([[continuous function (set theory)|continuous]] [[strictly increasing function|strictly increasing]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s from [[ordinal number|ordinal]]s to ordinals), introduced by [[Oswald Veblen]] in {{harvtxt|Veblen|1908}}. If φ<sub>0</sub> is any normal function, then for any non-zero ordinal α, φ<sub>α</sub> is the function enumerating the common [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s of φ<sub>β</sub> for β<α. These functions are all normal.\n\n== The Veblen hierarchy ==\nIn the special case when  φ<sub>0</sub>(α)=ω<sup>α</sup>\nthis family of functions is known as the '''Veblen hierarchy'''. \nThe function φ<sub>1</sub> is the same as the ε function: φ<sub>1</sub>(α)= ε<sub>α</sub>.

If one has fundamental sequences for α and all smaller limit ordinals, then one can create an explicit constructive bijection between ω and α, (i.e. one not using the axiom of choice). Here we will describe fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy of ordinals. The image of ''n'' under the fundamental sequence for α will be indicated by α[''n''].\n\nA variation of [[Ordinal arithmetic#Cantor normal form|Cantor normal form]] used in connection with the Veblen hierarchy is &mdash; every nonzero ordinal number α can be uniquely written as <math>\\alpha = \\varphi_{\\beta_1}(\\gamma_1) + \\varphi_{\\beta_2}(\\gamma_2) + \\cdots + \\varphi_{\\beta_k}(\\gamma_k)</math>, where ''k''>0 is a natural number and each term after the first is less than or equal to the previous term, <math>\\varphi_{\\beta_m}(\\gamma_m) \\geq \\varphi_{\\beta_{m+1}}(\\gamma_{m+1}) \\,,</math> and each <math>\\gamma_m < \\varphi_{\\beta_m}(\\gamma_m) \\,.</math> If a fundamental sequence can be provided for the last term, then that term can be replaced by such a sequence to get <math>\\alpha [n] = \\varphi_{\\beta_1}(\\gamma_1) + \\cdots + \\varphi_{\\beta_{k-1}}(\\gamma_{k-1}) + (\\varphi_{\\beta_k}(\\gamma_k) [n]) \\,.</math>\n\nFor any β, if γ is a limit with <math>\\gamma < \\varphi_{\\beta} (\\gamma) \\,,</math> then let <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\gamma) [n] = \\varphi_{\\beta}(\\gamma [n]) \\,.</math>\n\nNo such sequence can be provided for <math>\\varphi_0(0)</math> = ω<sup>0</sup> = 1 because it does not have cofinality ω.\n\nFor <math>\\varphi_0(\\gamma+1) = \\omega ^{\\gamma+1} = \\omega^ \\gamma \\cdot \\omega \\,,</math> we choose <math>\\varphi_0(\\gamma+1) [n] = \\varphi_0(\\gamma) \\cdot n  = \\omega^{\\gamma} \\cdot n \\,.</math>\n\nFor <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(0) \\,,</math> we use <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(0) [0] = 0 </math> and <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(0) [n+1] = \\varphi_{\\beta}(\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(0) [n]) \\,,</math> i.e. 0, <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(0)</math>, <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\varphi_{\\beta}(0))</math>, etc..\n\nFor <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma+1)</math>, we use <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma+1) [0] = \\varphi_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma)+1 </math> and <math>\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma+1) [n+1] = \\varphi_{\\beta} (\\varphi_{\\beta+1}(\\gamma+1) [n]) \\,.</math>\n\nNow suppose that β is a limit:\n\nIf <math>\\beta < \\varphi_{\\beta}(0)</math>, then let <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(0) [n] = \\varphi_{\\beta [n]}(0) \\,.</math>\n\nFor <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\gamma+1)</math>, use <math>\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\gamma+1) [n] = \\varphi_{\\beta [n]}(\\varphi_{\\beta}(\\gamma)+1) \\,.</math>\n\nOtherwise, the ordinal cannot be described in terms of smaller ordinals using <math>\\varphi</math> and this scheme does not apply to it.\n\n===The &Gamma; function===\nThe function Γ enumerates the ordinals α such that φ<sub>α</sub>(0) = α. \nΓ<sub>0</sub> is the [[Feferman–Schütte ordinal]], i.e. it is the smallest α such that φ<sub>α</sub>(0) = α.\n\nFor Γ<sub>0</sub>, a fundamental sequence could be chosen to be <math>\\Gamma_0 [0] = 0 </math> and <math>\\Gamma_0 [n+1] = \\varphi_{\\Gamma_0 [n]} (0) \\,.</math>\n\nFor Γ<sub>β+1</sub>, let <math>\\Gamma_{\\beta+1} [0] = \\Gamma_{\\beta} + 1 </math> and <math>\\Gamma_{\\beta+1} [n+1] = \\varphi_{\\Gamma_{\\beta+1} [n]} (0) \\,.</math>\n\nFor Γ<sub>β</sub> where <math>\\beta < \\Gamma_{\\beta} </math> is a limit, let <math>\\Gamma_{\\beta} [n] = \\Gamma_{\\beta [n]} \\,.</math>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Finitely many variables===\nTo build the Veblen function of a finite number of arguments (finitary Veblen function), let the binary function <math>\\varphi(\\alpha, \\gamma)</math> be <math>\\varphi_\\alpha(\\gamma)</math> as defined above.\n\nLet <math>z</math> be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma-separated zeros <math>0,0,...,0</math> and <math>s</math> be an empty string or a string consisting of one or more comma-separated ordinals <math>\\alpha _{1},\\alpha _{2},...,\\alpha _{n}</math> with <math>\\alpha _{1}>0</math>.

Notice that if such a sequence of ordinals is chosen from those less than an uncountable [[regular cardinal]] κ, then the sequence may be encoded as a single ordinal less than κ<sup>κ</sup>. So one is defining a function φ from κ<sup>κ</sup> into κ.\n\nThe definition can be given as follows: let <u>α</u> be a transfinite sequence of ordinals (i.e., an ordinal function with finite support) ''which ends in zero'' (i.e., such that α₀=0), and let <u>α</u><nowiki>[</nowiki>0↦γ<nowiki>]</nowiki> denote the same function where the final 0 has been replaced by γ.  Then γ↦φ(<u>α</u><nowiki>[</nowiki>0↦γ<nowiki>]</nowiki>) is defined as the function enumerating the common fixed points of all functions ξ↦φ(<u>β</u>) where <u>β</u> ranges over all sequences which are obtained by decreasing the smallest-indexed nonzero value of <u>α</u> and replacing some smaller-indexed value with the indeterminate ξ (i.e., <u>β</u>=<u>α</u><nowiki>[</nowiki>ι₀↦ζ,ι↦ξ<nowiki>]</nowiki> meaning that for the smallest index ι₀ such that α<sub>ι₀</sub> is nonzero the latter has been replaced by some value ζ&lt;α<sub>ι₀</sub> and that for some smaller index ι&lt;ι₀, the value α<sub>ι</sub>=0 has been replaced with ξ).\n\nFor example, if <u>α</u>=(ω↦1) denotes the transfinite sequence with value 1 at ω and 0 everywhere else, then φ(ω↦1) is the smallest fixed point of all the functions ξ↦φ(ξ,0,…,0) with finitely many final zeroes (it is also the limit of the φ(1,0,…,0) with finitely many zeroes, the small Veblen ordinal).\n\nThe smallest ordinal α such that α is greater than φ applied to any function with support in α (i.e., which cannot be reached “from below” using the Veblen function of transfinitely many variables) is sometimes known as the [[Large Veblen ordinal|“large” Veblen ordinal]].\n\n==References==\n* Hilbert Levitz, ''[http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~levitz/ords.ps Transfinite Ordinals and Their Notations: For The Uninitiated]'', expository article (8 pages, in [[PostScript]])\n*{{citation|last=Pohlers|first=Wolfram |title=Proof theory|mr=1026933 |series= Lecture Notes in Mathematics|volume= 1407|publisher= Springer-Verlag|place= Berlin|year= 1989|isbn= 978-3-540-51842-6|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-46825-7}}\n*{{citation|mr=0505313|last= Schütte|first= Kurt |title=Proof theory|series= Grundlehren der Mathematischen Wissenschaften|volume= 225|publisher= Springer-Verlag|place= Berlin-New York|year= 1977|pages= xii+299 | isbn= 978-3-540-07911-8}}\n*{{citation|mr=0882549|last= Takeuti|first= Gaisi |title=Proof theory|edition= Second |series= Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics|volume= 81|publisher= North-Holland Publishing Co.|place= Amsterdam|year=1987| isbn= 978-0-444-87943-1}}\n*{{citation |last=Smorynski |first=C. |year=1982 |title=The varieties of arboreal experience |journal=Math.

With the full [[axiom of choice]], every set is well-orderable, so every set has a cardinal; we order the cardinals using the inherited ordering from the ordinal numbers. This is readily found to coincide with the ordering via ≤<sub>''c''</sub>. This is a well-ordering of cardinal numbers.\n\n== Initial ordinal of a cardinal ==\nEach ordinal has an associated [[Cardinal number|cardinal]], its cardinality, obtained by simply forgetting the order.  Any well-ordered set having that ordinal as its [[order type]] has the same cardinality.  The smallest ordinal having a given cardinal as its cardinality is called the initial ordinal of that cardinal.  Every finite ordinal (natural number) is initial, but most infinite ordinals are not initial.  The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that every set can be well-ordered, i.e. that every cardinal has an initial ordinal.  In this case, it is traditional to identify the cardinal number with its initial ordinal, and we say that the initial ordinal ''is'' a cardinal.\n\nThe α-th infinite initial ordinal is written <math>\\omega_\\alpha</math>.  Its cardinality is written ℵ<sub>α</sub> (the α-th [[aleph number]]). For example, the cardinality of ω<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;ω is ℵ<sub>0</sub>, which is also the cardinality of ω<sup>2</sup>, ω<sup>ω</sup>, and [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε<sub>0</sub>]] (all are countable ordinals).  So we identify ω<sub>α</sub> with ℵ<sub>α</sub>, except that the notation ℵ<sub>α</sub> is used for writing cardinals, and ω<sub>α</sub> for writing ordinals. This is important because [[cardinal number#Cardinal arithmetic|arithmetic on cardinals]] is different from [[ordinal arithmetic|arithmetic on ordinals]], for example ℵ<sub>α</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;ℵ<sub>α</sub> whereas ω<sub>α</sub><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;>&nbsp;ω<sub>α</sub>. Also, ω<sub>1</sub> is the smallest uncountable ordinal (to see that it exists, consider the set of equivalence classes of well-orderings of the natural numbers; each such well-ordering defines a countable ordinal, and ω<sub>1</sub> is the order type of that set), ω<sub>2</sub> is the smallest ordinal whose cardinality is greater than ℵ<sub>1</sub>, and so on, and ω<sub>ω</sub> is the limit of ω<sub>''n''</sub> for natural numbers ''n'' (any limit of cardinals is a cardinal, so this limit is indeed the first cardinal after all the ω<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\nInfinite initial ordinals are limit ordinals. Using [[ordinal arithmetic]], α < ω<sub>β</sub> implies α+ω<sub>β</sub> = ω<sub>β</sub>, and 1 ≤ α < ω<sub>β</sub> implies α·ω<sub>β</sub> = ω<sub>β</sub>, and 2 ≤ α < ω<sub>β</sub> implies α<sup>ω<sub>β</sub></sup> = ω<sub>β</sub>. Using the [[Veblen function|Veblen hierarchy]], β ≠ 0 and α < ω<sub>β</sub> imply <math>\\varphi_{\\alpha}(\\omega_{\\beta}) = \\omega_{\\beta} \\,</math> and &Gamma;<sub>ω<sub>β</sub></sub> = ω<sub>β</sub>. Indeed, one can go far beyond this. So as an ordinal, an infinite initial ordinal is an extremely strong kind of limit.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Aleph number]]\n\n== References ==\n* Y.N.

Under zero-based numbering, the initial element is sometimes termed the [[0 (number)|''zeroth'']] element{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}, rather than the ''first'' element; ''zeroth'' is a [[word coinage|coined]] [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal number]] corresponding to the number [[zero]]. In some cases, an object or value that does not (originally) belong to a given sequence, but which could be naturally placed before its initial element, may be termed the zeroth element. There is not wide agreement regarding the correctness of using zero as an ordinal (nor regarding the use of the term ''zeroth'') as it creates ambiguity for all subsequent elements of the sequence when lacking context.\n\nNumbering sequences starting at 0 is quite common in mathematics notation, in particular in [[combinatorics]], though programming languages for mathematics usually index from 1. In [[computer science]], [[Array data structure|array]] indices usually start at 0 in modern programming languages, so computer programmers might use ''zeroth'' in situations where others might use ''first'', and so forth. In some mathematical contexts, zero-based numbering can be used without confusion, when ordinal forms have well established meaning with an obvious candidate to come before ''first''; for instance a ''zeroth derivative'' of a function is the function itself, obtained by [[derivative|differentiating]] zero times. Such usage corresponds to naming an element not properly belonging to the sequence but preceding it: the zeroth derivative is not really a derivative at all. However, just as the ''first derivative'' precedes the ''second derivative'', so also does the ''zeroth derivative'' (or the original function itself) precede the ''first derivative''.\n\n== Computer programming ==\n\n=== Origin ===\n[[Martin Richards (computer scientist)|Martin Richards]], creator of the [[BCPL]] language (a precursor of [[C (programming language)|C]]), designed arrays initiating at 0 as the natural position to start accessing the array contents in the language, since the value of a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] ''p'' used as an address accesses the position ''p'' + 0 in memory.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/bcpl.pdf |title=The BCPL Reference Manual |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |author=Martin Richards |year=1967 |page=11}}</ref><ref name=\"mikehoye\">{{cite web |url=http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/ |title=Citation Needed |accessdate=28 January 2014 |author=Mike Hoye}}</ref> Canadian systems analyst Mike Hoye asked Richards the reasons for choosing that convention. BCPL was first compiled for the [[IBM 7094]]; the language introduced no [[indirection lookup]]s at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]], so the indirection optimization provided by these arrays was used at compile time.<ref name=\"mikehoye\"/> The optimization was nevertheless important, as batch processes in the system could be interrupted at any time to calculate [[Velocity prediction program#Sailing Yacht Handicapping|yacht handicapping]] for the president of [[IBM]]'s racing yacht.<ref name=\"mikehoye\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multicians.org/thvv/7094.html |title=The IBM 7094 and CTSS |date=1995 |accessdate=28 January 2014 |author=Tom Van Vleck}}</ref>\n\n[[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] later wrote a pertinent note ''Why numbering should start at zero''<ref name=\"dijkstra\"/> in 1982, analyzing the possible designs of array indices by enclosing them in a chained inequality, combining sharp and standard inequalities to four possibilities, demonstrating that to his conviction zero-based arrays are best represented by non-overlapping index ranges, which start at zero, alluding to [[Interval (mathematics)#Terminology|open, half-open and closed intervals]] as with the real numbers. Dijkstra's criteria for preferring this convention are in detail that it represents empty sequences in a more natural way (''a'' ≤ ''i'' < ''a'' ?) than closed \"intervals\" (''a'' ≤ ''i'' ≤ (''a''−1) ?), and that with half-open \"intervals\" of naturals, the length of a sub-sequence equals the upper minus the lower bound (''a'' ≤ ''i'' < ''b'' gives (''b''−''a'') possible values for ''i'', with ''a'', ''b'', ''i'' all naturals).\n\n=== {{Anchor|OFFSET}}Usage in programming languages ===\nThis usage follows from design choices embedded in many influential [[programming language]]s, including [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Lisp programming language|Lisp]]. In these three, sequence types (C arrays, Java arrays and lists, and Lisp lists and vectors) are indexed beginning with the zero subscript. Particularly in C, where arrays are closely tied to [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] arithmetic, this makes for a simpler implementation: the subscript refers to an offset from the starting position of an array, so the first element has an offset of zero.\n\nReferencing memory by an address and an offset is represented directly in [[computer hardware]] on virtually all computer architectures, so this design detail in C makes compilation easier, at the cost of some human factors. In this context using \"zeroth\" as an ordinal is not strictly correct, but a widespread habit in this profession. Other programming languages, such as [[Fortran]] or [[COBOL]], have array subscripts starting with one, because they were meant as [[high-level programming language]]s, and as such they had to have a correspondence to the usual [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numbers]] which predate the [[0|invention of the zero]] by a long time.\n\n[[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] allows the range of an array to be of any ordinal type (including enumerated types. [[APL_(programming_language)|APL]] allows changing between 0 or 1 origin during runtime programatically as the programmers finds convenient. Some recent languages, such as [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] and [[Visual Basic]], have adopted the same convention for the same reason.\n\nZero is the lowest unsigned integer value, one of the most fundamental types in programming and hardware design. In computer science, [[0 (number)|zero]] is thus often used as the base case for many kinds of numerical [[recursion]]. Proofs and other sorts of mathematical reasoning in computer science often begin with zero. For these reasons, in computer science it is not unusual to number from zero rather than one.\n\nHackers and computer scientists often like to call the first chapter of a publication \"Chapter 0\", especially if it is of an introductory nature. One of the classic instances was in the First Edition of [[The C Programming Language (book)|K&amp;R]]. In recent years this trait has also been observed among many [[pure mathematics|pure mathematicians]], where many constructions are defined to be numbered from 0.\n\nIf an array is used to represent a cycle, it is convenient to obtain the index with a [[modulo operator|modulo function]], which can result in zero.\n\n===Numerical properties===\nWith zero-based numbering, a range can be expressed as the half-open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]], [0,''n''), as opposed to the closed interval, [1,''n'']. Empty ranges, which often occur in algorithms, are tricky to express with a closed interval without resorting to obtuse conventions like [1,0]. Because of this property, zero-based indexing potentially reduces [[Off-by-one error|off-by-one]] and [[fencepost error]]s.<ref name=\"dijkstra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD08xx/EWD831.html |title=Why numbering should start at zero (EWD 831) |last=Dijkstra |first=Edsger Wybe |authorlink=Edsger W. Dijkstra |date=May 2, 2008 |work=E. W. Dijkstra Archive |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |accessdate=2011-03-16}}</ref> On the other hand, the repeat count ''n'' is calculated in advance, making the use of counting from 0 to ''n''−1 (inclusive) less intuitive. Some authors prefer one-based indexing as it corresponds more closely to how entities are indexed in other contexts.<ref>Programming Microsoft® Visual C#® 2005 by Donis Marshall</ref>\n\nAnother property of this convention is in the use of [[modular arithmetic]] as implemented in modern computers. Usually, the [[modulo operation|modulo function]] maps any integer modulo ''N'' to one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|''N'' − 1}}, where {{nowrap|''N'' ≥ 1}}. Because of this, many formulas in algorithms (such as that for calculating hash table indices) can be elegantly expressed in code using the modulo operation when array indices start at zero.\n\nPointer operations can also be expressed more elegantly on a zero-based index due to the underlying address/offset logic mentioned above. To illustrate, suppose ''a'' is the [[memory address]] of the first element of an array, and ''i'' is the index of the desired element. To compute the address of the desired element, if the index numbers count from 1, the desired address is computed by this expression:\n\n:''a'' + ''s'' × (''i'' − 1)\n\nwhere ''s'' is the size of each element. In contrast, if the index numbers count from 0, the expression becomes:\n\n:''a'' + ''s'' × ''i''\n\nThis simpler expression is more efficient to compute at [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]].\n\nHowever, a language wishing to index arrays from 1 could adopt the convention that every array address is represented by ''a''′&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a''&nbsp;–&nbsp;''s''; that is, rather than using the address of the first array element, such a language would use the address of a fictitious element located immediately before the first actual element. The indexing expression for a 1-based index would then be:\n\n:''a''′ + ''s'' × ''i''\n\nHence, the efficiency benefit at run time of zero-based indexing is not inherent, but is an artifact of the decision to represent an array with the address of its first element rather than the address of the fictitious zeroth element.  However, the address of that fictitious element could very well be the address of some other item in memory not related to the array.\n\nSuperficially, the fictitious element doesn't scale well to multidimensional arrays. Indexing multidimensional arrays from zero makes a naive (contiguous) conversion to a linear address space (systematically varying one index after the other) look simpler than when indexing from one. For instance, when mapping the three-dimensional array {{nowrap|A[P][N][M]}} to a linear array L[M⋅N⋅P], both with M⋅N⋅P elements, the index ''r'' in the linear array to access a specific element with {{nowrap|L[''r''] {{=}} A[''z''][''y''][''x'']}} in zero-based indexing, i.e. [0 ≤ ''x'' < P], [0 ≤ ''y'' < N], [0 ≤ ''z'' < M], and [0 ≤ ''r'' < M⋅N⋅P], is calculated by {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''z''⋅M⋅N + ''y''⋅M + ''x''}}. Organizing all arrays with 1-based indices ([1 ≤ ''x′'' ≤ P], [1 ≤ ''y′'' ≤ N], [1 ≤ ''z′'' ≤ M], [1 ≤ r′ ≤ M⋅N⋅P]), and assuming an analogous arrangement of the elements, gives {{nowrap|''r′'' {{=}} (''z′'' &minus; 1)⋅M⋅N + (''y′'' &minus; 1)⋅M + (''x′'' &minus; 0)}} to access the same element, which arguably looks more complicated. Of course, {{nowrap|''r''' {{=}} ''r'' + 1,}} since [{{nowrap|''z'' {{=}} ''z′'' – 1],}} [{{nowrap|''y'' {{=}} ''y′'' – 1],}} and [{{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''x′'' – 1].}} A simple and everyday life example is [[positional notation]] which the invention of the zero made possible. In positional notation, tens, hundreds, thousands and all other digits start with zero, only units start at one.<ref>{{cite AV media | url=https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-1st-grade-math/cc-1st-place-value | title= Math 1st Grade / Place Value / Number grid | quote=Youtube title: Number grid / Counting / Early Math / Khan Academy | publisher=Khan Academy | author = Sal Khan | access-date = July 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n<table><tr><td>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ ''Zero''-based indices\n|-\n!x \\ y !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! .. !! x = x′ - 1 !! .. !! 8 !! 9 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 0\n| ''0''0 || ''0''1 || ''0''2 || || || || ''0''8 || ''0''9 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| 10 || 11 || 12 || || || || 18 || 19 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| 20 || 21 || 22 || || || || 28 || 29 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ..\n|  ||  ||  || || || || ||  \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | y = y′ - 1\n|  ||  ||  || || y.M + x || || ||  \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ..\n|  ||  ||  || || || || ||  \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 8\n| 80 || 81 || 82 || || || || 88 || 89 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 9\n| 90 || 91 || 92 || || || || 98 || 99\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align: center;\"| The table content represents the index r\n|}\n<td>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ ''One''-based indices\n|-\n! x′ \\ y′ !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! .. !! x′ = x + 1 !! .. !! 9 !! 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1\n| ''0''1 || ''0''2 || ''0''3 || || || ||  ''0''9 || 10\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2\n| 11 || 12 || 13 || || || || 19 || 20\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3\n|  21 || 22 || 23 || || || || 29 || 30 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ..\n|  ||  ||  || || || || || \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | y′ = y + 1\n|  ||  ||  || ||  (y′-1).M + x′ || || || \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ..\n|  ||  ||  || || || || || \n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 9\n| 81 || 82 || 83 || || || || 89 || 90\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 10\n| 91 || 92 || 93 || || || || 99 || 100\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" style=\"text-align: center;\"| The table content represents the index r′\n|}\n</table>\n\n\nThis situation can lead to some confusion in terminology. In a zero-based indexing scheme, the first element is \"element number zero\"; likewise, the twelfth element is \"element number eleven\". Therefore, an analogy from the ordinal numbers to the quantity of objects numbered appears; the highest index of ''n'' objects will be {{nowrap|''n'' − 1}} and it refers to the ''n''th element. For this reason, the first element is sometimes referred to as the [[array data structure|zeroth]] element, in an attempt to avoid confusion.\n\n== Science ==\n\nIn [[mathematics]], many sequences of numbers or of [[polynomials]] are indexed by nonnegative integers, for example the [[Bernoulli numbers]] and the [[Bell numbers]].\n\nThe ''[[zeroth law of thermodynamics]]'' was formulated after the first, second, and third laws, but considered more fundamental, thus its name.\n\nIn biology, an organism is said to have zero order intentionality if it shows \"no intention of anything at all\".

Under those systems, the year [[1 BC]] is followed by [[AD 1]].  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year 1 BC)  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year 1 BC) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.\n\nIn many countries, the [[Storey#European scheme 2|ground floor]] in buildings is considered as floor number 0 rather than as the \"1st Floor\", the naming convention usually found in the United States of America. This makes a consistent set with underground floors marked with negative numbers.\n\nWhile the ordinal of 0 mostly finds use in communities directly connected to mathematics, physics, and computer science, there are also instances in classical music. The composer [[Anton Bruckner]] regarded his early ''Symphony in D minor'' to be unworthy of including in the canon of his works, and he wrote 'gilt nicht' on the score and a circle with a crossbar, intending it to mean \"invalid\". But posthumously, this work came to be known as [[Symphony No. 0 (Bruckner)|''Symphony No. 0 in D minor'']], even though it was actually written after [[Symphony No. 1 (Bruckner)|''Symphony No. 1 in C minor'']]. There is an even earlier ''Symphony in F minor'' of Bruckner's that is sometimes called [[Symphony No. 00 (Bruckner)|''No. 00'']]. The Russian composer [[Alfred Schnittke]] also wrote a [[Symphony No. 0 (Schnittke)|Symphony No. 0]].\n\nIn some universities, including Oxford and Cambridge, \"week 0\" or occasionally \"noughth week\" refers to the week before the first week of lectures in a term. In Australia, some universities refer to this as \"O Week\", which serves as a pun on \"[[orientation week]]\". As a parallel, the introductory weeks at university educations in [[Sweden]] are generally called \"nollning\" (zeroing).\n\nThe [[United States Air Force]] starts basic training each Wednesday, and the first week (of eight) is considered to begin with the following Sunday.  The four days before that Sunday are often referred to as \"Zero Week.\"\n\n[[24-hour clock]]s and the international standard [[ISO 8601]] use 0 to denote the first (zeroth) hour of the day.\n\n[[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] in London, [[Haymarket railway station|Edinburgh Haymarket]], and stations in [[Uppsala]], [[Yonago]], [[Stockport railway station|Stockport]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] have a [[Railway platform|platform]] 0.\n\n[[Robert Crumb]]'s drawings for the first issue of ''[[Zap Comix]]'' were stolen, so he drew a whole new issue which was published as issue 1.  Later he re-inked his photocopies of the stolen artwork and published it as issue 0.\n\nThe [[Brussels ring]] road in Belgium is numbered R0. It was built after the ring road around [[Antwerp]], but Brussels (being the capital city) was deemed deserving of a more basic number. Similarly the (unfinished) orbital motorway around [[Budapest]] in Hungary is called [[M0 motorway|M0]].\n\nZero is sometimes used [[House numbering| in street addresses]], especially in schemes where even numbers are one side of the street and odd numbers on the other. A case in point is the landmark [[Christ Church (Cambridge, Massachusetts)| Christ Church Cambridge]] on [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]'s [[Harvard Square]], whose address is 0 Garden Street.\n\nIn Formula One, when a defending world champion does not compete in the following season, the number 1 is not assigned to any driver, but one driver of the world champion team will carry the number 0, and the other, number 2. This did happen both in 1993 and 1994 with Damon Hill carrying the number 0 in both seasons, as defending champion Nigel Mansell quit after 1992, and defending champion Alain Prost quit after 1993.\n\nA chronological prequel of a series may be numbered as 0, such as ''[[Ring 0: Birthday]]'' or ''[[Zork Zero]]''.\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] number certain classes of rolling stock from zero, for example, [[SBB-CFF-FFS Re 460|Re 460]] 000 to 118.\n\nIn the realm of fiction, [[Isaac Asimov]] eventually added a Zeroth Law to his [[Three Laws of Robotics]], essentially making them four laws.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Zeroth order approximation]]\n*[[Off-by-one error]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n;General\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n[[Category:Ordinal numbers]]\n[[Category:0 (number)]]"

The cardinality of a [[finite set]] is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The ''[[transfinite number|transfinite]]'' cardinal numbers describe the sizes of [[infinite set]]s.\n\nCardinality is defined in terms of [[bijective function]]s. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to [[Georg Cantor]] shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of [[real number]]s is greater than the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. It is also possible for a [[proper subset]] of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.\n\nThere is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:\n:<math>0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n, \\ldots ; \\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\ldots, \\aleph_{\\alpha}, \\ldots.\\ </math>\nThis sequence starts with the [[natural number]]s including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the [[aleph number]]s (infinite cardinals of [[well-ordering|well-ordered sets]]). The aleph numbers are indexed by [[ordinal number]]s.  Under the assumption of the [[axiom of choice]], this [[transfinite sequence]] includes every cardinal number.  If one [[axiom of choice#Independence|rejects]] that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.\n\n[[Cardinality]] is studied for its own sake as part of [[set theory]]. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including [[model theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[mathematical analysis]]. In [[category theory]], the cardinal numbers form a [[Skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]] of the [[category of sets]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by [[Georg Cantor]], the originator of [[set theory]], in 1874–1884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets; e.g. the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not ''equal'', but have the ''same cardinality'', namely three (this is established by the existence of a [[bijection]], i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between the two sets; e.g. {1→4, 2→5, 3→6}).\n\nCantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets;<ref>{{harvnb|Dauben|1990|loc=pg. 54}}</ref> e.g. the set of natural numbers '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Thus, all sets having a bijection with '''N''' he called [[Countable set|denumerable (countably infinite) sets]] and they all have the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called <math>\\aleph_0</math>, [[Aleph number|aleph-null]]. He called the cardinal numbers of these infinite sets [[transfinite cardinal numbers]].\n\nCantor proved that any [[Bounded set|unbounded subset]] of '''N''' has the same cardinality as '''N''', even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is denumerable; this implies that the set of all [[rational number]]s is also denumerable, since every rational can be represented by a pair of integers. He later proved that the set of all real [[algebraic number]]s is also denumerable. Each real algebraic number ''z'' may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is a solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>''), ''a<sub>i</sub>'' ∈ '''Z''' together with a pair of rationals (''b''<sub>0</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>) such that ''z'' is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>'') that lies in the interval (''b''<sub>0</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>).\n\nIn his 1874 paper \"[[On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers]]\", Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of '''N'''. His proof used an argument with [[nested intervals]], but in an 1891 paper he proved the same result using his ingenious but simpler [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the [[cardinality of the continuum]] and Cantor used the symbol <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> for it.\n\nCantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (<math>\\aleph_0</math>, aleph-null), and that for every cardinal number there is a next-larger cardinal\n\n:<math>(\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\aleph_3, \\ldots).</math>\n\nHis [[continuum hypothesis]] is the proposition that <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> is the same as <math>\\aleph_1</math>. This hypothesis has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the standard assumptions.\n\n== Motivation ==\nIn informal use, a '''cardinal number''' is what is normally referred to as a ''[[counting number]]'', provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, .... They may be identified with the [[natural numbers]] beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the [[finite set|finite]] cardinal numbers.  Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.\n\nMore formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence.  For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size, e.g. 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence <'a','b','c','d',...>, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements.  However, when dealing with [[infinite set]]s it is essential to distinguish between the two — the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to [[ordinal numbers]], while the size aspect is generalized by the '''cardinal numbers''' described here.\n\nThe intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or \"bigness\" of a set without reference to the kind of members which it has.  For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has.  In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more subtle notions.\n\nA set ''Y'' is at least as big as a set ''X'' if there is an [[injective function|injective]] [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] from the elements of ''X'' to the elements of ''Y''. An injective mapping identifies each element of the set ''X'' with a unique element of the set ''Y''. This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets ''X'' = {1,2,3} and ''Y'' = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size we would observe that there is a mapping:\n: 1 → a\n: 2 → b\n: 3 → c\nwhich is injective, and hence conclude that ''Y'' has cardinality greater than or equal to ''X''. Note the element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily an injective and [[onto]] mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.\n\nWe can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] ''X'' and ''Y'' are said to have the same '''cardinality''' if there exists a [[bijection]] between ''X'' and ''Y''.  By the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem|Schroeder–Bernstein theorem]], this is equivalent to there being ''both'' an injective mapping from ''X'' to ''Y'' ''and'' an injective mapping from ''Y'' to ''X''. We then write |''X''| = |''Y''|. The cardinal number of ''X'' itself is often defined as the least ordinal ''a'' with |''a''| = |''X''|.  This is called the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]]; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as ''some'' ordinal; this statement is the [[well-ordering principle]]. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.\n\nThe classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].  Suppose you are an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives.  It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant.  We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:\n: 1 → 2\n: 2 → 3\n: 3 → 4\n: ...\n: ''n'' → ''n'' + 1\n: ...\nIn this way we can see that the set {1,2,3,...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4,...} since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown.  This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality; in this case {2,3,4,...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3,...}.\n\nWhen considering these large objects, we might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets.  It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object \"one greater than infinity\" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.\n\nIt can be proved that the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is greater than that of the natural numbers just described.  This can be visualized using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]];\nclassic questions of cardinality (for instance the [[continuum hypothesis]]) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals.  In more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.\n\nSince cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use.  Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as '''equipotence''', '''equipollence''', or '''equinumerosity'''. It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, '''equipotent''', '''equipollent''', or '''equinumerous'''.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nFormally, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the cardinality of a set ''X'' is the least [[ordinal number]] α such that there is a bijection between ''X'' and α.  This definition is known as the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]].  If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different.  The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set ''X'' (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and [[Principia Mathematica]]) is as the class ''[X]'' of all sets that are equinumerous with ''X''. This does not work in [[ZFC]] or other related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because if ''X'' is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for ''X ≠ ∅'' there is an injection from the universe into ''[X]'' by mapping a set ''m'' to ''{m} × X'' and so by the [[axiom of limitation of size]], ''[X]'' is a proper class. The definition does work however in [[type theory]] and in [[New Foundations]] and related systems.  However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with ''X'' that have the least [[rank (set theory)|rank]], then it will work (this is a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deiser|first1=Oliver|title=On the Development of the Notion of a Cardinal Number|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|doi=10.1080/01445340903545904 |volume=31|issue=2|pages=123–143|date=May 2010}}</ref>  it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\n\nFormally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |''X''| ≤ |''Y''| means that there exists an [[injective]] function from ''X'' to ''Y''. The [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] states that if |''X''| ≤ |''Y''| and |''Y''| ≤ |''X''| then |''X''| = |''Y''|. The [[axiom of choice]] is equivalent to the statement that given two sets ''X'' and ''Y'', either |''X''| ≤ |''Y''| or |''Y''| ≤ |''X''|.<ref name=\"Enderton\">Enderton, Herbert. \"Elements of Set Theory\", Academic Press Inc., 1977. {{ISBN|0-12-238440-7}}</ref><ref>{{citation | author=[[Friedrich M.

The [[finite set|finite]] cardinals are just the [[natural numbers]], i.e., a set ''X'' is finite if and only if |''X''| = |''n''| = ''n'' for some natural number ''n''.  Any other set is [[infinite set|infinite]].  Assuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal <math>\\aleph_0</math> ([[aleph null]] or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the [[Hebrew alphabet]], represented <math>\\aleph</math>) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e. that any infinite set has a subset of cardinality <math>\\aleph_0.</math>  The next larger cardinal is denoted by <math>\\aleph_1</math> and so on. For every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] α there is a cardinal number <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha},</math> and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.\n\n== Cardinal arithmetic ==\nWe can define [[arithmetic]] operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers.  It can be shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.\n\n=== Successor cardinal ===\n{{Details|Successor cardinal}}\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, then every cardinal κ has a successor κ<sup>+</sup> > κ, and there are no cardinals between κ and its successor.  (Without the axiom of choice, using [[Hartogs number|Hartogs' theorem]], it can be shown that, for any cardinal number κ, there is a minimal cardinal κ<sup>+</sup>, such that <!-- κ<sup>+</sup> ࣞ κ.<ref group=notes>The symbol is the [[Unicode]] symbol for not less than or equal to.</ref>--><math>\\kappa^+\\nleq\\kappa. </math>)  For finite cardinals, the successor is simply κ + 1.  For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the [[successor ordinal]].\n\n=== Cardinal addition ===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], addition is given by the [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.  If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality, e.g., replace ''X'' by ''X''×{0} and ''Y'' by ''Y''×{1}.\n:<math>|X| + |Y| = | X \\cup Y|.</math>\n\nZero is an additive identity ''κ'' + 0 = 0 + ''κ'' = ''κ''.\n\nAddition is [[associative]] (''κ'' + ''μ'') + ''ν'' = ''κ'' + (''μ'' + ''ν'').\n\nAddition is [[commutative]] ''κ'' + ''μ'' = ''μ'' + ''κ''.\n\nAddition is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n:<math>(\\kappa \\le \\mu) \\rightarrow ((\\kappa + \\nu \\le \\mu + \\nu) \\mbox{ and } (\\nu + \\kappa \\le \\nu + \\mu)).</math>\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy.  If either κ or μ is infinite, then\n:<math>\\kappa + \\mu = \\max\\{\\kappa, \\mu\\}\\,.</math>\n\n==== Subtraction ====\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal σ and a cardinal μ, there exists a cardinal κ such that μ + κ = σ if and only if μ ≤ σ. It will be unique (and equal to σ) if and only if μ < σ.\n\n=== Cardinal multiplication ===\nThe product of cardinals comes from the [[cartesian product]].\n:<math>|X|\\cdot|Y| = |X \\times Y|</math>\n\n''κ''·0 = 0·''κ'' = 0.\n\n''κ''·''μ'' = 0 → (''κ'' = 0 or ''μ'' = 0).\n\nOne is a multiplicative identity ''κ''·1 = 1·''κ'' = ''κ''.\n\nMultiplication is associative (''κ''·''μ'')·''ν'' = ''κ''·(''μ''·''ν'').\n\nMultiplication is [[commutative]] ''κ''·''μ'' = ''μ''·''κ''.\n\nMultiplication is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n''κ'' ≤ ''μ'' → (''κ''·''ν'' ≤ ''μ''·''ν'' and ''ν''·''κ'' ≤ ''ν''·''μ'').\n\nMultiplication [[distributivity|distributes]] over addition:\n''κ''·(''μ'' + ''ν'') = ''κ''·''μ'' + ''κ''·''ν'' and\n(''μ'' + ''ν'')·''κ'' = ''μ''·''κ'' + ''ν''·''κ''.\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, multiplication of infinite cardinal numbers is also easy.

It will be unique (and equal to ''π'') if and only if μ < ''π''.\n\n=== Cardinal exponentiation ===\nExponentiation is given by\n:<math>|X|^{|Y|} = \\left|X^Y\\right|,</math>\nwhere ''X<sup>Y</sup>'' is the set of all [[function (mathematics)|functions]] from ''Y'' to ''X''.\n\n:κ<sup>0</sup> = 1  (in particular 0<sup>0</sup> = 1), see [[empty function]].\n:If 1 ≤ μ, then 0<sup>μ</sup> = 0.\n:1<sup>μ</sup> = 1.\n:κ<sup>1</sup> = κ.\n:κ<sup>μ + ν</sup> = ''κ''<sup>''μ''</sup>·''κ''<sup>''ν''</sup>.\n:κ<sup>μ · ν</sup> = (''κ''<sup>''μ''</sup>)<sup>''ν''</sup>.\n:(''κ''·''μ'')<sup>''ν''</sup> = ''κ''<sup>''ν''</sup>·''μ''<sup>''ν''</sup>.\nExponentiation is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n:(1 ≤ ''ν'' and ''κ'' ≤ ''μ'') → (''ν''<sup>''κ''</sup> ≤ ''ν''<sup>''μ''</sup>) and\n:(''κ'' ≤ ''μ'') → (''κ''<sup>''ν''</sup> ≤ ''μ''<sup>''ν''</sup>).\n\nNote that 2<sup>|''X''|</sup> is the cardinality of the [[power set]] of the set ''X'' and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that 2<sup>|''X''|</sup> > |''X''| for any set ''X''. This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal ''κ'', we can always find a larger cardinal 2<sup>κ</sup>). In fact, the [[class (set theory)|class]] of cardinals is a [[proper class]].  (This proof fails in some set theories, notably [[New Foundations]].)\n\nAll the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:\n\n:If ''κ'' and ''μ'' are both finite and greater than 1, and ''ν'' is infinite, then ''κ''<sup>''ν''</sup> = ''μ''<sup>''ν''</sup>.\n:If ''κ'' is infinite and ''μ'' is finite and non-zero, then ''κ''<sup>''μ''</sup> = ''κ''.\n\nIf 2 ≤ κ and 1 ≤ μ and at least one of them is infinite, then:\n:Max (κ, 2<sup>μ</sup>) ≤ κ<sup>μ</sup> ≤ Max (2<sup>κ</sup>, 2<sup>μ</sup>).\n\nUsing [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]], one can prove κ < κ<sup>cf(κ)</sup> and κ < cf(2<sup>κ</sup>) for any infinite cardinal κ, where cf(κ) is the [[cofinality]] of κ.\n\n==== Roots ====\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 0, the cardinal ν satisfying <math>\\nu^\\mu = \\kappa</math> will be κ.\n\n==== Logarithms ====\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal κ and a finite cardinal μ greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal λ satisfying <math>\\mu^\\lambda = \\kappa</math>.

Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of [[cardinal invariant]]s of [[topological space]]s, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.<ref>Robert A.

That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.\n\nThe relation of having the same cardinality is called [[equinumerosity]], and this is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all sets. The [[equivalence class]] of a set ''A'' under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as ''A''. There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\":\n\n#The cardinality of a set ''A'' is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity.\n#A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal in that class]]. This is usually taken as the definition of [[cardinal number]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].\n\nAssuming [[Axiom of choice|AC]], the cardinalities of the [[infinite set]]s are denoted\n:<math>\\aleph_0 < \\aleph_1 < \\aleph_2 < \\ldots . </math>\nFor each [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha + 1}</math> is the least cardinal number greater than <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math>.\n\nThe cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is denoted [[aleph number|aleph-null]] (<math>\\aleph_0</math>), while the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is denoted by \"<math>\\mathfrak c</math>\" (a lowercase [[fraktur (script)|fraktur script]] \"c\"), and is also referred to as the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Cantor showed, using the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], that <math>{\\mathfrak c} >\\aleph_0</math>. We can show that <math>\\mathfrak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>, this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] says that <math>\\aleph_1 = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>, i.e. <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is the smallest cardinal number bigger than <math>\\aleph_0</math>, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.\nThe continuum hypothesis is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice|ZFC]], a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent).

Thus we can make the following definitions:\n\n*Any set ''X'' with cardinality less than that of the [[natural number]]s, or | ''X'' | < | '''N''' |, is said to be a [[finite set]].\n*Any set ''X'' that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers, or | ''X'' | = | '''N''' | = <math>\\aleph_0</math>, is said to be a [[countably infinite]] set.\n*Any set ''X'' with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or | ''X'' | > | '''N''' |, for example | '''R''' | = <math>\\mathfrak c </math> > | '''N''' |, is said to be  [[uncountable set|uncountable]].\n\n==Infinite sets==\nOur intuition gained from [[finite set]]s breaks down when dealing with [[infinite set]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].\nIndeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed that (according to his bijection-based definition of size) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (<math>\\aleph_0</math>).\n\n===Cardinality of the continuum===\n{{main article|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (<math>\\mathfrak{c}</math>) is greater than that of the natural numbers (<math>\\aleph_0</math>); that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than natural numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that <math>\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\beth_1</math> (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]) satisfies:\n:<math>2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0</math>\n:(see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).\n\nThe [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,\n:<math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1</math>\n\nHowever, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[ZFC]] [[axiomatic set theory]], if ZFC is consistent.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist [[proper subset]]s and [[proper superset]]s of an infinite set ''S'' that have the same size as ''S'', although ''S'' contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of ''S'' contain elements that are not included in it.\n\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent function]], which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (−½π, ½π) and '''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]).\n\nThe second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain [[Space-filling curve#Proof that a square and its side contain the same number of points|such a proof]].\n\nCantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> exist (see his [[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|generalized diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]). They include, for instance:\n\n:* the set of all subsets of '''R''', i.e., the [[power set]] of '''R''', written ''P''('''R''') or 2<sup>'''R'''</sup>\n:* the set '''R'''<sup>'''R'''</sup> of all functions from '''R''' to '''R'''\n\nBoth have cardinality\n:<math>2^\\mathfrak {c} = \\beth_2 > \\mathfrak c </math>\n:(see [[Beth number#Beth two|Beth two]]).\n\nThe [[Cardinality of the continuum#Cardinal equalities|cardinal equalities]] <math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\mathfrak{c},</math> <math>\\mathfrak c^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak c,</math> and <math>\\mathfrak c ^{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\mathfrak c}</math> can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^2 = 2^{2\\times{\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c},</math>\n:<math>\\mathfrak c^{\\aleph_0} = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{{\\aleph_0}\\times{\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c},</math>\n:<math> \\mathfrak c ^{\\mathfrak c} = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\mathfrak c\\times\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\mathfrak c}.</math>\n\n==Examples and properties==\n* If ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and ''Y'' = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then | ''X'' | = | ''Y'' | because { (''a'', apples), (''b'', oranges), (''c'', peaches)} is a bijection between the sets ''X'' and ''Y''. The cardinality of each of ''X'' and ''Y'' is 3.\n* If | ''X'' | &lt; | ''Y'' |, then there exists ''Z'' such that | ''X'' | = | ''Z'' | and ''Z'' ⊆ ''Y''.\n*If | ''X'' | ≤ | ''Y'' | and | ''Y'' | ≤ | ''X'' |, then | ''X'' | = | ''Y'' |.

Alephs measure the sizes of sets; infinity, on the other hand, is commonly defined as an extreme [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the [[real number line]] (applied to a [[function (mathematics)|function]] or [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] that \"[[divergent series|diverges]] to infinity\" or \"increases without bound\"), or an extreme point of the [[extended real number line]].\n\n=={{anchor|Aleph-null}}Aleph-naught==\n<math>\\aleph_0</math> (aleph-naught, also aleph-zero or the German term Aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an [[transfinite number|infinite cardinal]]. The set of all finite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], called '''ω''' or '''ω<sub>0</sub>''' (where ω is the lowercase Greek letter [[omega]]), has cardinality <math>\\aleph_0</math>. A set has cardinality <math>\\aleph_0</math> if and only if it is [[countably infinite]], that is, there is a [[bijection]] (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are\n\n* the set of all [[square number]]s, the set of all [[cubic number]]s, the set of all [[fourth power]]s, ...\n* the set of all [[perfect power]]s, the set of all [[prime power]]s, \n* the set of all [[even number]]s, the set of all [[odd number]]s,\n* the set of all [[prime number]]s, the set of all [[composite number]]s, \n* the set of all [[integer]]s, \n* the set of all [[rational number]]s, \n* the set of all [[constructible number]]s (in the geometric sense),\n* the set of all [[algebraic number]]s, \n* the set of all [[computable number]]s, \n* the set of all [[definable number]]s, \n* the set of all binary [[string (computer science)|string]]s of finite length, and \n* the set of all finite [[subset]]s of any given countably infinite set.\n\nThese infinite ordinals: ω, ω+1, ω·2, ω<sup>2</sup>, ω<sup>ω</sup> and [[Epsilon numbers (mathematics)|ε<sub>0</sub>]] are among the countably infinite sets.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Jech | first1=Thomas | title=Set Theory | publisher= [[Springer-Verlag]]| location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer Monographs in Mathematics | year=2003}}</ref> For example, the sequence (with [[ordinality]] ω·2) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers\n\n:{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...}\n\nis an ordering of the set (with cardinality <math>\\aleph_0</math>) of positive integers.\n\nIf the [[axiom of countable choice]] (a weaker version of the [[axiom of choice]]) holds, then <math>\\aleph_0</math> is smaller than any other infinite cardinal.\n\n==Aleph-one==\n{{Redirect|Aleph One}}\n<math>\\aleph_1</math> is the cardinality of the set of all countable [[ordinal number]]s, called '''ω<sub>1</sub>''' or sometimes '''Ω'''. This '''ω<sub>1</sub>''' is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an [[uncountable set]]. Therefore,  <math>\\aleph_1</math> is distinct from <math>\\aleph_0</math>.  The definition of <math>\\aleph_1</math> implies (in ZF, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] ''without'' the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between <math>\\aleph_0</math> and <math>\\aleph_1</math>. If the [[axiom of choice]] is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is [[totally ordered]], and thus <math>\\aleph_1</math> is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. Using the axiom of choice we can show one of the most useful properties of the set '''ω<sub>1</sub>''': any countable subset of '''ω<sub>1</sub>''' has an upper bound in '''ω<sub>1</sub>'''.  (This follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable, one of the most common applications of the axiom of choice.)  This fact is analogous to the situation in <math>\\aleph_0</math>: every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and [[Union (set theory)#Finite unions|finite unions]] of finite sets are finite.\n\n'''ω<sub>1</sub>''' is actually a useful concept, if somewhat exotic-sounding. An example application is \"closing\" with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]] generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.&nbsp;g. [[Borel hierarchy]]). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of \"generation\" in algebra ([[vector space]]s, [[group theory|group]]s, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations—sums, products, and the like. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via [[transfinite induction]], a set by \"throwing in\" all possible countable unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of '''ω<sub>1</sub>'''.\n\nEvery uncountable [[coanalytic]] subset of a [[Polish space]] <math>X</math> has\ncardinality <math>\\aleph_1</math> or <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math>.{{cn|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Continuum hypothesis==\n{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}\n{{see also|Beth number}}\nThe [[cardinality]] of the set of [[real number]]s ([[cardinality of the continuum]]) is <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math>.

CH is independent of ZFC: it can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is [[consistency|consistent]]). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940 when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC.  That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] in 1963 when he showed, conversely, that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC by the (then novel) method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]]. <ref name=WolframCH />\n\n==Aleph-ω==\nConventionally the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted ω, and the cardinal number <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> is the least upper bound of\n{{block indent|<math>\\left\\{\\,\\aleph_n : n\\in\\left\\{\\,0,1,2,\\dots\\,\\right\\}\\,\\right\\}</math>}}\namong alephs.\n\nAleph-ω is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ''not'' to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all [[real number]]s; for any positive integer ''n'' we can consistently assume that <math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_n</math>, and moreover it is possible to assume <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is as large as we like. We are only forced to avoid setting it to certain special cardinals with [[cofinality]] <math>\\aleph_0</math>, meaning there is an unbounded function from <math>\\aleph_0</math> to it (see [[Easton's theorem]]).\n\n==Aleph-α for general α==\nTo define <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math> for arbitrary ordinal number <math>\\alpha</math>, we must define the [[successor cardinal|successor cardinal operation]], which assigns to any cardinal number ρ the next larger [[well-order]]ed cardinal ρ{{sup|+}} (if the [[axiom of choice]] holds, this is the next larger cardinal).\n\nWe can then define the aleph numbers as follows:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\aleph_{0} = \\omega</math>}}\n{{block indent|<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha+1} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}^+</math>}}\n\nand for λ, an infinite [[limit ordinal]],\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\aleph_{\\lambda} = \\bigcup_{\\beta < \\lambda} \\aleph_\\beta.</math>}}\n\nThe α-th infinite [[initial ordinal]] is written <math>\\omega_\\alpha</math>.

Thus <math>\\lambda \\geq \\kappa </math> and consequently <math>\\lambda = \\kappa </math> which makes it a fixed point.\n\n==Role of axiom of choice==\n\nThe cardinality of any infinite [[ordinal number]] is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its [[initial ordinal]]. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is [[equinumerous]] with an ordinal and is thus [[Well-order|well-orderable]].\n\nEach [[finite set]] is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality.\n\nThe assumption that the cardinality of each [[infinite set]] is an aleph number is equivalent over ZF to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]]. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers.\n\nWhen cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of [[Scott's trick]] is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define card(''S'') to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as ''S'' of minimum possible rank. This has the property that card(''S'') = card(''T'') if and only if ''S'' and ''T'' have the same cardinality. (The set card(''S'') does not have the same cardinality of ''S'' in general, but all its elements do.)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Regular cardinal]]\n* [[Ordinal number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|mr=0095787 \n|last=Sierpiński|first= Wacław\n|title=Cardinal and ordinal numbers. \n|series=Polska Akademia Nauk Monografie Matematyczne|volume= 34 |publisher=Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe|place= Warsaw |year=1958}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{springer|title=Aleph-zero|id=p/a011280|ref=none}}\n* {{MathWorld | urlname=Aleph-0 | title=Aleph-0}}\n\n<!-- [[he:אלף 0]]  - this article is about aleph 0 specifically, not about aleph numbers.

For the example above, this yields:\n:{|\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>1</sub> || = || (<u>'''0'''</u>, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 0, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>2</sub> || = || (1, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || 1, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>3</sub> || = || (0, || 1, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || 1, || 0, || 1, || 0, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>4</sub> || = || (1, || 0, || 1, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || 1, || 0, || 1, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>5</sub> || = || (1, || 1, || 0, || 1, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || 1, || 1, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>6</sub> || = || (0, || 0, || 1, || 1, || 0, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || 1, || ...)\n|-\n| ''s''<sub>7</sub> || = || (1, || 0, || 0, || 0, || 1, || 0, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || ...)\n|-\n| ...\n|-\n|\n|-\n| ''s'' || = || (<u>'''1'''</u>, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || <u>'''0'''</u>, || <u>'''1'''</u>, || ...)\n|}\nBy construction, ''s'' differs from each ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>, since their ''n''<sup>th</sup> digits differ (highlighted in the example).\nHence, ''s'' cannot occur in the enumeration.\n\nBased on this theorem, Cantor then uses a [[proof by contradiction]] to show that:\n:The set ''T'' is uncountable.\nThe proof starts by assuming that ''T'' is [[countable set#Definition|countable]].\nThen all its elements can be written as an enumeration ''s''<sub>1</sub>, ''s''<sub>2</sub>, ... , ''s''<sub>''n''</sub>, ... .\nApplying the previous theorem to this enumeration produces a sequence ''s'' not belonging to the enumeration. However, this contradicts ''s'' being an element of ''T'' and therefore belonging to the enumeration. This contradiction implies that the original assumption is false. Therefore, ''T'' is uncountable.\n\n=== Interpretation ===\nThe interpretation of Cantor's result will depend upon one's view of mathematics. To [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivists]], the argument shows no more than that there is no [[bijection]] between the natural numbers and ''T''. It does not rule out the possibility that the latter are [[subcountable]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the context of [[classical mathematics]], this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, there are actually ''more'' infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Real numbers ===\nThe uncountability of the [[real number]]s was already established by [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]], but it also follows from the above result. To prove this, an [[injective function|injection]] will be constructed from the set ''T'' of infinite binary strings to the set '''R''' of real numbers. Since ''T'' is uncountable, the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of this function, which is a subset of '''R''', is uncountable. Therefore, '''R''' is uncountable. Also, by using a method of construction devised by Cantor, a [[bijection]] will be constructed between ''T'' and '''R'''. Therefore, ''T'' and '''R''' have the same cardinality, which is called the \"[[cardinality of the continuum]]\" and is usually denoted by <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> or <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math>.\n\nAn injection from ''T'' to '''R'''  is given by mapping strings in ''T'' to decimals, such as mapping ''t''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0111... to the decimal 0.0111.... This function, defined by {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''}}, is an injection because it maps different strings to different numbers.\n\nConstructing a bijection between ''T'' and '''R''' is slightly more complicated.\nInstead of mapping 0111... to the decimal 0.0111..., it can be mapped to the [[radix|base]] ''b'' number: 0.0111...<sub>''b''</sub>. This leads to the family of functions: {{nowrap|''f''<sub>''b''</sub>{{space|hair}}(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''<sub>''b''</sub>}}. The functions {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>''b''</sub>(''t'')}} are injections, except for {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>2</sub>(''t'')}}. This function will be modified to produce a bijection between ''T'' and '''R'''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

He used it to construct a bijection between the [[closed interval]] [0, 1] and the [[irrational number|irrational]]s in the [[open interval]] (0,&nbsp;1). He first removed a [[countably infinite]] subset from each of these sets so that there is a bijection between the remaining uncountable sets. Since there is a bijection between the countably infinite subsets that have been removed, combining the two bijections produces a bijection between the original sets.<ref>See page 254 of {{Citation|author=Georg Cantor|title=Ein Beitrag zur Mannigfaltigkeitslehre|url=http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PID=GDZPPN002156806|volume=84|pages=242&ndash;258|journal=Journal für die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik|year=1878}}. This proof is discussed in {{Citation|author=Joseph Dauben|title=Georg Cantor: His Mathematics and Philosophy of the Infinite|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1979|isbn=0-674-34871-0}}, pp. 61&ndash;62, 65. On page 65, Dauben proves a result that is stronger than Cantor's. He lets \"''φ<sub>ν</sub>'' denote any sequence of rationals in [0,&nbsp;1].\" Cantor lets ''φ<sub>ν</sub>'' denote a sequence [[Enumeration|enumerating]] the rationals in [0,&nbsp;1], which is the kind of sequence needed for his construction of a bijection between [0,&nbsp;1] and the irrationals in (0,&nbsp;1).</ref>\n\nCantor's method can be used to modify the function {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>2</sub>(''t'') {{=}} 0.''t''<sub>2</sub>}} to produce a bijection from ''T'' to (0,&nbsp;1). Because some numbers have two binary expansions, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>2</sub>(''t'')}} is not even [[injective function|injective]]. For example, {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>2</sub>(1000…) {{=}}}} 0.1000...<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= 1/2 and {{nowrap|''f''{{space|hair}}<sub>2</sub>(0111…) {{=}}}} 0.0111...<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|[[Infinite series|1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + …]] {{=}}}} 1/2, so both 1000... and 0111... map to the same number, 1/2.\n\nTo modify {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub>{{space|hair}}(''t'')}}, observe that it is a bijection except for a countably infinite subset of (0,&nbsp;1) and a countably infinite subset of ''T''. It is not a bijection for the numbers in (0,&nbsp;1) that have two [[binary expansion]]s. These are called [[dyadic rational|dyadic]] numbers and have the form {{nowrap|''m''{{space|hair}}/{{space|hair}}2<sup>''n''</sup>}} where ''m'' is an odd integer and ''n'' is a natural number. Put these numbers in the sequence: ''r''&nbsp;= (1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8, 7/8,&nbsp;...). Also, {{nowrap|''f''<sub>2</sub>{{space|hair}}(''t'')}} is not a bijection to (0,&nbsp;1) for the strings in ''T'' appearing after the [[binary point]] in the binary expansions of 0, 1, and the numbers in sequence ''r''. Put these eventually-constant strings in the sequence: ''s''&nbsp;= ({{color|#808080|000}}..., {{color|#808080|111}}..., 1{{color|#808080|000}}..., 0{{color|#808080|111}}..., 01{{color|#808080|000}}..., 00{{color|#808080|111}}..., 11{{color|#808080|000}}..., 10{{color|#808080|111}}...,&nbsp;...). Define the bijection ''g''(''t'') from ''T'' to (0,&nbsp;1): If ''t'' is the ''n''<sup>th</sup> string in sequence ''s'', let ''g''(''t'') be the ''n''<sup>th</sup> number in sequence ''r''{{space|hair}}; otherwise, ''g''(''t'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.''t''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nTo construct a bijection from ''T'' to '''R''', start with the [[trigonometric functions|tangent function]] tan(''x''), which is a bijection from (−π/2,&nbsp;π/2) to '''R''' (see the figure shown on the right). Next observe that the [[linear function]] ''h''(''x'')&nbsp;= {{nowrap|π''x'' – π/2}} is a bijection from (0,&nbsp;1) to (−π/2,&nbsp;π/2) (see the figure shown on the left). The [[function composition|composite function]] tan(''h''(''x''))&nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''x'' – π/2)}} is a bijection from (0,&nbsp;1) to '''R'''. Composing this function with ''g''(''t'') produces the function tan(''h''(''g''(''t'')))&nbsp;= {{nowrap|tan(π''g''(''t'') – π/2)}}, which is a bijection from ''T'' to '''R'''.\n|}\n\n== General sets ==\n[[File:Diagonal argument powerset svg.svg|thumb|250px|Illustration of the generalized diagonal argument: The set ''T'' = {''n''∈ℕ: ''n''∉''f''(''n'')} at the bottom cannot occur anywhere in the range of ''f'':[[natural number|ℕ]]→[[power set|'''''P''''']](ℕ). The example mapping ''f'' happens to correspond to the example enumeration ''s'' in the [[#Lead|above]] picture.]]\nA generalized form of the diagonal argument was used by Cantor to prove [[Cantor's theorem]]: for every [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'', the [[power set]] of ''S''—that is, the set of all [[subset]]s of ''S'' (here written as '''''P'''''(''S''))—has a larger cardinality than ''S'' itself. This proof proceeds as follows:\n\nLet ''f'' be any [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from ''S'' to '''''P'''''(''S'').  It suffices to prove ''f'' cannot be [[surjective]]. That means that some member ''T'' of '''''P'''''(''S''), i.e. some subset of ''S'', is not in the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of ''f''.  As a candidate consider the set:\n\n:''T'' = { ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }.\n\nFor every ''s'' in ''S'', either ''s'' is in ''T'' or not. If ''s'' is in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is not in ''f''(''s''), so ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''). On the other hand,  if ''s'' is not in ''T'', then by definition of ''T'', ''s'' is in ''f''(''s''), so again ''T'' is not equal to ''f''(''s''); cf. picture.\nFor a more complete account of this proof, see [[Cantor's theorem]].\n\n===Consequences===\nThis result implies that the notion of the [[set of all sets]] is an inconsistent notion.  If ''S'' were the set of all sets then '''''P'''''(''S'') would at the same time be bigger than ''S'' and a subset of ''S''.\n\n[[Russell's Paradox]] has shown us that [[naive set theory]], based on an [[unrestricted comprehension]] scheme, is contradictory.  Note that there is a similarity between the construction of ''T'' and the set in Russell's paradox. Therefore, depending on how we modify the axiom scheme of comprehension in order to avoid Russell's paradox, arguments such as the non-existence of a set of all sets may or may not remain valid.\n\nThe diagonal argument shows that the set of real numbers is \"bigger\" than the set of natural numbers (and therefore, the integers and rationals as well). Therefore, we can ask if there is a set whose [[cardinality]] is \"between\" that of the integers and that of the reals. This question leads to the famous [[continuum hypothesis]]. Similarly, the question of whether there exists a set whose cardinality is between |''S''| and |'''''P'''''(''S'')| for some infinite ''S'' leads to the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]].\n\nAnalogues of the diagonal argument are widely used in mathematics to prove the existence or nonexistence of certain objects.  For example, the conventional proof of the unsolvability of the [[halting problem]] is essentially a diagonal argument.  Also, diagonalization was originally used to show the existence of arbitrarily hard [[complexity classes]] and played a key role in early attempts to prove [[P versus NP|P does not equal NP]].\n\n===Version for Quine's New Foundations===\nThe above proof fails for [[W. V. Quine]]'s \"[[New Foundations]]\" set theory (NF). In NF, the [[unrestricted comprehension|naive axiom scheme of comprehension]] is modified to avoid the paradoxes by introducing a kind of \"local\" [[type theory]].  In this axiom scheme,\n\n:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''(''s'') }\n\nis ''not'' a set — i.e., does not satisfy the axiom scheme.  On the other hand, we might try to create a modified diagonal argument by noticing that\n\n:{ ''s'' ∈ ''S'': ''s'' ∉ ''f''({''s''}) }\n\n''is'' a set in NF.  In which case, if '''''P'''''<sub>1</sub>(''S'') is the set of one-element subsets of ''S'' and ''f'' is a proposed bijection from '''''P'''''<sub>1</sub>(''S'') to '''''P'''''(''S''), one is able to use [[proof by contradiction]] to prove that |'''''P'''''<sub>1</sub>(''S'')| &lt; |'''''P'''''(''S'')|.\n\nThe proof follows by the fact that if ''f'' were indeed a map ''onto'' '''''P'''''(''S''), then we could find ''r'' in ''S'', such that  ''f''({''r''}) coincides with the modified diagonal set, above.  We would conclude that if ''r'' is not in ''f''({''r''}), then ''r'' is in ''f''({''r''}) and vice versa.\n\nIt is ''not'' possible to put '''''P'''''<sub>1</sub>(''S'') in a one-to-one relation with ''S'', as the two have different types, and so any function so defined would violate the typing rules for the comprehension scheme.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]\n*[[Controversy over Cantor's theory]]\n*[[Diagonal lemma]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath371.htm Cantor's Diagonal Proof] at MathPages\n*{{MathWorld |title=Cantor Diagonal Method |id=CantorDiagonalMethod }}\n\n{{Set theory}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cantor's Diagonal Argument}}\n[[Category:Set theory]]\n[[Category:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics]]\n[[Category:Mathematical proofs]]\n[[Category:Infinity]]\n[[Category:Arguments]]\n[[Category:Cardinal numbers]]\n[[Category:Georg Cantor]]"

      "text": "In [[set theory]], '''Cantor's paradox''' is a statement derivable from the [[theorem]] that there is no greatest [[cardinal number]], so that the collection of \"infinite sizes\" is itself infinite. The difficulty is handled in axiomatic set theory by declaring that this collection is not a set but a [[proper class]]; in [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] it follows from this and the [[axiom of limitation of size]] that this proper class must be in [[bijection]] with the class of all sets. Thus, not only are there infinitely many infinities, but this infinity is larger than any of the infinities it enumerates.\n\nThis [[paradox]] is named for [[Georg Cantor]], who is often credited with first identifying it in 1899 (or between 1895 and 1897). Like a number of \"paradoxes\" it is not actually contradictory but merely indicative of a mistaken intuition, in this case about the nature of infinity and the notion of a set. Put another way, it '''is''' paradoxical within the confines of [[naïve set theory]] and therefore demonstrates that a careless axiomatization of this theory is inconsistent.\n\n==Statements and proofs==\nIn order to state the paradox it is necessary to understand that the cardinal numbers admit an [[ordered set|ordering]], so that one can speak about one being greater or less than another. Then Cantor's paradox is:\n\n:'''Theorem:''' There is no greatest cardinal number.\n\nThis fact is a direct consequence of [[Cantor's theorem]] on the cardinality of the [[power set]] of a set.\n\n:'''Proof:''' Assume the contrary, and let ''C'' be the largest cardinal number. Then (in the [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] formulation of cardinality) ''C'' is a set and therefore has a power set 2<sup>''C''</sup> which, by Cantor's theorem, has cardinality strictly larger than ''C''. Demonstrating a cardinality (namely that of 2<sup>''C''</sup>) larger than ''C'', which was assumed to be the greatest cardinal number, falsifies the definition of C. This contradiction establishes that such a cardinal cannot exist.\n\nAnother consequence of [[Cantor's theorem]] is that the cardinal numbers constitute a [[proper class]]. That is, they cannot all be collected together as elements of a single set. Here is a somewhat more general result.\n\n:'''Theorem:''' If ''S'' is any set then ''S'' cannot contain elements of all cardinalities. In fact, there is a strict upper bound on the cardinalities of the elements of ''S''.\n\n:'''Proof:''' Let ''S'' be a set, and let ''T'' be the union of the elements of ''S''. Then every element of ''S'' is a subset of ''T'', and hence is of cardinality less than or equal to the cardinality of ''T''. [[Cantor's theorem]] then implies that every element of ''S'' is of cardinality strictly less than the cardinality of 2<sup>''T''</sup>.\n\n==Discussion and consequences==\nSince the cardinal numbers are well-ordered by indexing with the [[ordinal numbers]] (see [[Cardinal number#Formal definition|Cardinal number, formal definition]]), this also establishes that there is no greatest ordinal number; conversely, the latter statement implies Cantor's paradox.  By applying this indexing to the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] we obtain another proof that the cardinal numbers are a [[proper class]] rather than a set, and (at least in [[ZFC]] or in [[von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]]) it follows from this that there is a bijection between the class of cardinals and the class of all sets.  Since every set is a subset of this latter class, and every cardinality is the cardinality of a set (by definition!) this intuitively means that the \"cardinality\" of the collection of cardinals is greater than the cardinality of any set: it is more infinite than any true infinity.  This is the paradoxical nature of Cantor's \"paradox\".\n\n==Historical notes==\nWhile Cantor is usually credited with first identifying this property of cardinal sets, some mathematicians award this distinction to [[Bertrand Russell]], who defined a similar theorem in 1899 or 1901.\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n    | author=Anellis, I.H.\n    | title=\"The first Russell paradox,\" Perspectives on the History of Mathematical Logic\n    | editor=Drucker, Thomas\n    | publisher=Birkäuser Boston\n    | location=Cambridge, Mass.\n    | year=1991\n    | pages=33–46}}\n* {{cite journal\n    |author1=Moore, G.H.  |author2=Garciadiego, A.\n    | title=Burali-Forti's paradox: a reappraisal of its origins\n    | journal=Historia Math\n    | volume=8\n    | pages=319–350\n    | doi=10.1016/0315-0860(81)90070-7\n    | year=1981\n    | issue=3}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.71.3986 An Historical Account of Set-Theoretic Antinomies Caused by the Axiom of Abstraction]: report by Justin T.

For [[finite set]]s, Cantor's theorem can be seen to be true by simple [[enumeration]] of the number of subsets. Counting the empty subset, a set with <math>n</math> members has <math>2^n</math> subsets, so that if <math>{\\rm card}(A) = n,</math> then <math>{\\rm card}(\\mathcal{P}(A)) = 2^n</math>, and the theorem holds because <math>2^n > n</math> is true for all [[non-negative integers]].\n\nMuch more significant is Cantor's discovery of an argument that is applicable to any set, which showed that the theorem holds for [[infinite set|infinite]] sets, countable or uncountable, as well as finite ones.  As a particularly important consequence, the power set of the set of [[natural number]]s, a [[countably infinite]] set with cardinality ℵ<sub>0</sub> = card(ℕ), is [[uncountable set|uncountably infinite]] and has the same size as the set of real numbers, a cardinality often referred to as the [[cardinality of the continuum]]: 𝔠 = card(ℝ) = card(𝒫(ℕ)).  The relationship between these cardinal numbers is often expressed symbolically by the equality <math>\\mathfrak{c}=2^{\\aleph_0}</math>.\n\nThe theorem is named for [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]], who first stated and proved it at the end of the 19th century.  Cantor's theorem had immediate and important consequences for the philosophy of mathematics.  For instance, by iteratively taking the power set of an infinite set and applying Cantor's theorem, we obtain an endless hierarchy of infinite cardinals, each strictly larger than the one before it.  Consequently, the theorem implies that there is no largest cardinal number (colloquially, \"there's no largest infinity\").\n\n==Proof==\nCantor's argument is elegant and remarkably simple.  The complete proof is presented below, with detailed explanations to follow.\n\n{{quotebox|quote=<p>'''Theorem (Cantor).''' Let <math>f</math> be a map from set <math>A</math> to its power set <math>\\mathcal{P}(A)</math>.  Then <math>f:A\\to\\mathcal{P}(A)</math> is not surjective.  As a consequence, <math>\\mathrm{card}(A)<\\mathrm{card}(\\mathcal{P}(A))</math> holds for any set <math>A</math>.</p>\n<p>'''Proof:''' Consider the set <math> B=\\{x \\in A \\, | \\, x \\notin f(x)\\}</math>.  Suppose to the contrary that <math>f</math> is [[surjective]].  Then there exists <math>\\xi\\in A</math> such that <math>f(\\xi)=B</math>.  But by construction, <math>\\xi\\in B \\iff \\xi\\notin f(\\xi)= B </math>. This is a contradiction.  Thus, <math>f</math> cannot be surjective.  On the other hand, <math>g:A\\to\\mathcal{P}(A)</math> defined by <math>x\\mapsto\\{x\\}</math> is an injective map.  Consequently, we must have <math>\\mathrm{card}(A)<\\mathrm{card}(\\mathcal{P}(A))</math>.<math>\\ \\blacksquare</math></p>|qalign=left}}\n\nBy definition of cardinality, we have card(''X'') < card(''Y'') for any two sets ''X'' and ''Y'' if and only if there is an [[injective function]] but no [[Bijective Function|bijective function]] from ''X'' to ''Y''.  It suffices to show that there is no surjection from ''X'' to ''Y''.  This is the heart of Cantor's theorem: there is no surjective function from any set ''A'' to its power set.  To establish this, it is enough to show that no function ''f'' that maps elements in ''A'' to subsets of ''A'' can reach every possible subset, i.e., we just need to demonstrate the existence of a subset of ''A'' that is not equal to ''f''(''x'') for any ''x'' ∈ ''A''. (Recall that each ''f''(''x'') is a subset of ''A''.)  Such a subset is given by the following construction, sometimes called the ''Cantor diagonal set'' of ''f'':<ref name=\"Dasgupta2013\">{{cite book|author=Abhijit Dasgupta|title=Set Theory: With an Introduction to Real Point Sets|year=2013|publisher=[[Springer Science & Business Media]]|isbn=978-1-4614-8854-5|pages=362–363}}</ref><ref name=\"Paulson1992\">{{cite book|author=Lawrence Paulson|title=Set Theory as a Computational Logic |url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-271.pdf|year=1992|publisher=University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory|page=14}}</ref>\n\n:<math>B=\\{x\\in A\\,|\\,x\\not\\in f(x)\\}.</math>\n\nThis means, by definition, that for all ''x'' in ''A'', ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''B'' if and only if ''x''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''f''(''x''). For all ''x'' the sets ''B'' and ''f''(''x'') cannot be the same because ''B'' was constructed from elements of ''A'' whose images (under ''f'') did not include themselves. More specifically, consider any ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''A'', then either ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''f''(''x'') or ''x''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''f''(''x''). In the former case, ''f''(''x'') cannot equal ''B'' because ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''f''(''x'') by assumption and ''x''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''B'' by the construction of ''B''. In the latter case, ''f''(''x'') cannot equal ''B'' because ''x''&nbsp;∉&nbsp;''f''(''x'') by assumption and ''x''&nbsp;∈&nbsp;''B'' by the construction of ''B''.\n\nEquivalently, and slightly more formally, we just proved that the existence of ξ ∈ ''A'' such that ''f''(ξ) = ''B'' implies the following [[contradiction]]:\n\n:<math>\\begin{aligned}\\xi \\in f(\\xi) &\\iff \\xi \\in B && \\text{(by assumption that }f(\\xi)=B\\text{)}; \\\\\n\\xi\\in B &\\iff \\xi\\notin f(\\xi) && \\text{(by definition of }B\\text{)}.\\end{aligned}</math>\n\nTherefore, by [[reductio ad absurdum]], the assumption must be false.<ref name=\"Priest2002\"/> Thus there is no ξ ∈ ''A'' such that ''f''(ξ) = ''B''; in other words, ''B'' is not in the image of ''f'' and ''f'' does not map to every element of the power set of ''A'', i.e., ''f'' is not surjective (onto).\n\nFinally, to complete the proof, we need to exhibit an injective function from ''A'' to its power set.  Finding such a function is trivial: just map ''x'' to the singleton set {''x''}.  The argument is now complete, and we have established the strict inequality for any set ''A'' that card(''A'') < card(𝒫(''A'')).\n\nAnother way to think of the proof is that ''B'', empty or non-empty, is always in the power set of ''A''. For ''f'' to be [[Surjective function|onto]], some element of ''A'' must map to ''B''. But that leads to a contradiction: no element of ''B'' can map to ''B'' because that would contradict the criterion of membership in ''B'', thus the element mapping to ''B'' must not be an element of ''B'' meaning that it satisfies the criterion for membership in ''B'', another contradiction. So the assumption that an element of ''A'' maps to ''B'' must be false; and ''f'' cannot be onto.\n\nBecause of the double occurrence of ''x'' in the expression \"''x'' ∉ ''f''(''x'')\", this is a [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. For a countable (or finite) set, the argument of the proof given above can be illustrated by constructing a table in which each row is labelled by a unique ''x'' from ''A'' = {''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...}, in this order. ''A'' is assumed to admit a [[Total order|linear order]] so that such table can be constructed. Each column of the table is labelled by a unique ''y'' from the [[power set]] of ''A''; the columns are ordered by the argument to ''f'', i.e. the column labels are ''f''(''x''<sub>1</sub>), ''f''(''x''<sub>2</sub>), ..., in this order. The intersection of each row ''x'' and column ''y'' records a true/false bit whether ''x'' ∈ ''y''. Given the order chosen for the row and column labels, the main diagonal ''D'' of this table thus records whether  ''x'' ∈ ''f''(''x'') for all ''x'' in ''A''. The set ''B'' constructed in the previous paragraphs coincides with the row labels for the subset of entries on this main diagonal ''D'' where the table records that ''x'' ∈ ''f''(''x'') is false.<ref name=\"Priest2002\">{{cite book|author=Graham Priest|title=Beyond the Limits of Thought|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-925405-7|pages=118–119}}<!--note that the page numbers differ between the OUP and CUP editions of Priest's book!--></ref> Each column records the values of the [[indicator function]] of the set corresponding to the column. The indicator function of ''B'' coincides with the [[logical negation|logically negated]] (true ↔ false) entries of the main diagonal. Thus the indicator function of ''B'' does not agree with any column in at least one entry. Consequently, no column represents ''B''.\n\nFor a finite set, the proof can also be illustrated using a more prosaic presentation known as the [[barber paradox]].<ref name=\"Howson1990\">{{cite book|author=Albert Geoffrey Howson|title=The Popularization of Mathematics|year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-40319-1|page=197}}</ref>\n\nDespite the simplicity of the above proof, it is rather difficult for an [[automated theorem prover]] to produce it. The main difficulty lies in an automated discovery of the Cantor diagonal set. [[Lawrence Paulson]] noted in 1992 that [[Otter (theorem prover)|Otter]] could not do it, whereas [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]] could, albeit with a certain amount of direction in terms of tactics that might perhaps be considered cheating.<ref name=\"Paulson1992\"/>\n\n==A detailed explanation of the proof when ''X'' is countably infinite==\nTo understand the proof, let's examine it for the specific case when ''X'' is [[countably infinite]]. [[Without loss of generality]], we may take ''X'' = '''ℕ''' = {1, 2, 3,...}, the set of [[natural number]]s.\n\nSuppose that ℕ is [[equinumerous]] with its [[power set]] 𝒫('''ℕ'''). Let us see a sample of what 𝒫('''ℕ''') looks like:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N})=\\{\\varnothing,\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 2, 3\\}, \\{4\\}, \\{1, 5\\}, \\{3, 4, 6\\}, \\{2, 4, 6,\\dots\\},\\dots\\}.</math>\n\n𝒫('''ℕ''') contains infinite subsets of '''ℕ''', e.g. the set of all even numbers {2, 4, 6,...}, as well as the [[empty set]].\n\nNow that we have an idea of what the elements of 𝒫('''ℕ''') look like, let us attempt to pair off each [[element (math)|element]] of '''ℕ''' with each element of 𝒫('''ℕ''') to show that these infinite sets are equinumerous. In other words, we will attempt to pair off each element of '''ℕ''' with an element from the infinite set 𝒫('''ℕ'''), so that no element from either infinite set remains unpaired. Such an attempt to pair elements would look like this:\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{N}\\begin{Bmatrix} 1 & \\longleftrightarrow & \\{4, 5\\}\\\\ 2 & \\longleftrightarrow & \\{1, 2, 3\\} \\\\ 3 & \\longleftrightarrow & \\{4, 5, 6\\} \\\\ 4 & \\longleftrightarrow & \\{1, 3, 5\\} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\end{Bmatrix}\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbb{N}).</math>\n\nGiven such a pairing, some natural numbers are paired with [[subset]]s that contain the very same number. For instance, in our example the number 2 is paired with the subset {1, 2, 3}, which contains 2 as a member. Let us call such numbers ''selfish''. Other natural numbers are paired with [[subset]]s that do not contain them. For instance, in our example the number 1 is paired with the subset {4, 5}, which does not contain the number 1. Call these numbers ''non-selfish''. Likewise, 3 and 4 are non-selfish.\n\nUsing this idea, let us build a special set of natural numbers. This set will provide the [[proof by contradiction|contradiction]] we seek. Let ''D'' be the set of ''all'' non-selfish natural numbers. By definition, the [[power set]] 𝒫('''ℕ''') contains all sets of natural numbers, and so it contains this set ''D'' as an element. If the mapping is bijective, ''D'' must be paired off with some natural number, say ''d''. However, this causes a problem. If ''d'' is in ''D'', then ''d'' is selfish because it is in the corresponding set, contradicting the definition of \"D\". If ''d'' is not in ''D'', then it is non-selfish and should instead be a member of ''D''. Therefore, no such element ''d'' which maps to ''D'' can exist.\n\nSince there is no natural number which can be paired with ''D'', we have contradicted our original supposition, that there is a [[bijection]] between '''ℕ''' and 𝒫('''ℕ''').\n\nNote that the set ''D'' may be empty. This would mean that every natural number ''x'' maps to a set of natural numbers that contains ''x''. Then, every number maps to a nonempty set and no number maps to the empty set. But the empty set is a member of 𝒫('''ℕ'''), so the mapping still does not cover 𝒫('''ℕ''').\n\nThrough this [[proof by contradiction]] we have proven that the [[cardinality]] of '''ℕ''' and 𝒫('''ℕ''') cannot be equal. We also know that the [[cardinality]] of 𝒫('''ℕ''') cannot be less than the [[cardinality]] of '''ℕ''' because 𝒫('''ℕ''') contains all [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]]s, by definition, and these singletons form a \"copy\" of '''ℕ''' inside of 𝒫('''ℕ'''). Therefore, only one possibility remains, and that is that the [[cardinality]] of 𝒫('''ℕ''') is strictly greater than the [[cardinality]] of '''ℕ''', proving Cantor's theorem.\n\n==Related paradoxes==\nCantor's theorem and its proof are closely related to two [[paradoxes of set theory]].\n\n[[Cantor's paradox]] is the name given to a contradiction following from Cantor's theorem together with the assumption that there is a set containing all sets, the [[universal set]] <math>V</math>. In order to distinguish this paradox from the next one discussed below, it is important to note what this contradiction is. By Cantor's theorem <math>|\\wp(X)| > |X|</math> for any set <math>X</math>. On the other hand, all elements of <math>\\wp(V)</math> are sets, and thus contained in <math>V</math>, therefore <math>|\\wp(V)| \\leqslant |V|</math>.<ref name=\"Dasgupta2013\"/>\n\nAnother paradox can be derived from the proof of Cantor's theorem by instantiating the function ''f'' with the [[identity function]]; this turns Cantor's diagonal set into what is sometimes called the ''Russell set'' of a given set ''A'':<ref name=\"Dasgupta2013\"/>\n\n:<math>R_A=\\left\\{\\,x\\in A : x\\not\\in x\\,\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe proof of Cantor's theorem is straightforwardly adapted to show that assuming a set of all sets ''U'' exists, then considering its Russell set ''R''<sub>''U''</sub> leads to the contradiction:\n\n:<math>R_U \\in R_U \\iff R_U \\notin R_U.</math>\n \nThis argument is known as [[Russell's paradox]].<ref name=\"Dasgupta2013\"/> As a point of subtlety, the version of Russell's paradox we have presented here is actually a theorem of [[Zermelo]];<ref name=\"Ebbinghaus2007\"/> we can conclude from the contradiction obtained that we must reject the hypothesis that ''R''<sub>''U''</sub>∈''U'', thus disproving the existence of a set containing all sets. This was possible because we have used [[Axiom schema of specification|restricted comprehension]] (as featured in [[ZFC]]) in the definition of ''R''<sub>''A''</sub> above, which in turn entailed that\n\n:<math>R_U \\in R_U \\iff (R_U \\in U \\wedge R_U \\notin R_U). </math>\n\nHad we used [[unrestricted comprehension]] (as in [[Frege]]'s system for instance) by defining the Russell set simply as <math>R=\\left\\{\\,x : x\\not\\in x\\,\\right\\}</math>, then the axiom system itself would have entailed the contradiction, with no further hypotheses needed.<ref name=\"Ebbinghaus2007\">{{cite book|author=Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus|title=Ernst Zermelo: An Approach to His Life and Work|year=2007|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-49553-6|pages=86–87}}</ref>\n\nDespite the syntactical similarities between the Russell set (in either variant) and the Cantor diagonal set, [[Alonzo Church]] emphasized that Russell's paradox is independent of considerations of cardinality and its underlying notions like one-to-one correspondence.<ref>Church, A.

The version of this argument he gave in that paper was phrased in terms of indicator functions on a set rather than subsets of a set. He showed that if ''f'' is a function defined on ''X'' whose values are 2-valued functions on ''X'', then the 2-valued function ''G''(''x'') = 1 &minus; ''f''(''x'')(''x'') is not in the range of ''f''.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] has a very similar proof in ''[[Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903, section 348), where he shows that there are more [[propositional function]]s than objects.  \"For suppose a correlation of all objects and some propositional functions to have been affected, and let phi-''x'' be the correlate of ''x''. Then \"not-phi-''x''(''x''),\" i.e. \"phi-''x'' does not hold of ''x''\" is a propositional function not contained in this correlation; for it is true or false of ''x'' according as phi-''x'' is false or true of ''x'', and therefore it differs from phi-''x'' for every value of ''x''.\"  He attributes the idea behind the proof to Cantor.\n\n[[Ernst Zermelo]] has a theorem (which he calls \"Cantor's Theorem\") that is identical to the form above in the paper that became the foundation of modern set theory (\"Untersuchungen über die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre I\"), published in 1908.

It is not a true partial ordering because [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetry]] need not hold: if both <math>A \\leq_c B</math> and <math>B \\leq_c A</math>, it is true by the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] that <math>A =_c B</math> i.e. ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous, but they do not have to be literally equal (see [[isomorphism]]). That at least one of <math>A \\leq_c B</math> and <math>B \\leq_c A</math> holds turns out to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]].\n\nNevertheless, most of the ''interesting'' results on cardinality and its arithmetic can be expressed merely with =<sub>c</sub>.\n\nThe goal of a '''cardinal assignment''' is to assign to every set ''A'' a specific, unique set that is only dependent on the cardinality of ''A''. This is in accordance with [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s original vision of a cardinals: to take a set and abstract its elements into canonical \"units\" and collect these units into another set, such that the only thing special about this set is its size. These would be totally ordered by the relation <math>\\leq_c</math> and =<sub>c</sub> would be true equality. As Y. N. Moschovakis says, however, this is mostly an exercise in mathematical elegance, and you don't gain much unless you are \"allergic to subscripts.\" However, there are various valuable applications of \"real\" cardinal numbers in various [[model theory|models]] of set theory.\n\nIn modern set theory, we usually use the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment]], which uses the theory of ordinal numbers and the full power of the axioms of [[Axiom of choice|choice]] and [[Axiom of replacement|replacement]]. Cardinal assignments do need the full axiom of choice, if we want a decent cardinal arithmetic and an assignment for ''all'' sets.\n\n== Cardinal assignment without the axiom of choice ==\n\nFormally, assuming the axiom of choice, the cardinality of a set ''X'' is the least ordinal α such that there is a bijection between ''X'' and α.  This definition is known as the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]].  If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different.  The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set ''X'' (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and [[Principia Mathematica]]) is as the set of all sets that are equinumerous with ''X'':  this does not work in [[ZFC]] or other related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because this collection is too large to be a set, but it does work in [[type theory]] and in [[New Foundations]] and related systems.  However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with ''X'' that have the least [[rank (set theory)|rank]], then it will work (this is a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]:  it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\n\n==References==\n*Moschovakis, Yiannis N.

      "text": "{{short description|set theory concept}}\nIn the mathematical discipline of [[set theory]], a '''cardinal characteristic of the continuum''' is an infinite [[cardinal number]] that may consistently lie strictly between [[Aleph null|<math>\\aleph_0</math>]] (the [[cardinality]] of the set of [[natural number]]s), and the [[cardinality of the continuum]], that is, the cardinality of the set <math>\\mathbb R</math> of all [[real number]]s.  The latter cardinal is denoted <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> or <math>\\mathfrak c</math>. A variety of such cardinal characteristics arise naturally, and much work has been done in determining what relations between them are provable, and constructing models of set theory for various [[consistency|consistent]] configurations of them.\n\n== Background ==\n\n[[Cantor's diagonal argument]] shows that <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is strictly greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math>, but it does not specify whether it is the ''least'' cardinal greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> (that is, <math>\\aleph_1</math>). Indeed the assumption that <math>\\mathfrak c=\\aleph_1</math> is the well-known [[Continuum Hypothesis]], which was shown to be independent of the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for set theory by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].  If the Continuum Hypothesis fails and so <math>\\mathfrak c</math> is at least <math>\\aleph_2</math>, natural questions arise about the cardinals strictly between <math>\\aleph_0</math> and <math>\\mathfrak c</math>, for example regarding Lebesgue measurability.  By considering the least cardinal with some property, one may get a definition for an uncountable cardinal that is consistently less than <math>\\mathfrak c</math>.  Generally one only considers definitions for cardinals that  are provably greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math> and at most <math>\\mathfrak c</math> as cardinal characteristics of the continuum, so if the Continuum Hypothesis holds they are all equal to <math>\\aleph_1</math>.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nAs is standard in set theory, we denote by <math>\\omega</math> the least infinite [[Ordinal number|ordinal]], which has cardinality <math>\\aleph_0</math>; it may be identified with the set of all natural numbers.\n\nA number of cardinal characteristics naturally arise as [[Cardinal function|cardinal invariants]] for [[Ideal (set theory)|ideals]] which are closely connected with the structure of the reals, such as the ideal of [[Null set#Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue null sets]] and the ideal of [[meagre set]]s.\n\n=== non(N) ===\n\nThe cardinal characteristic non(<math>\\mathcal N</math>) is the least cardinality of a [[non-measurable set]]; equivalently, it is the least cardinality of a set that is not a [[Null set#Lebesgue measure|Lebesgue null set]].\n\n===Bounding number <math>\\mathfrak b</math> and dominating number <math>\\mathfrak d</math>===\n\nWe denote by <math>\\omega^\\omega</math> the set of functions from <math>\\omega</math> to <math>\\omega</math>. For any two functions <math>f:\\omega\\to\\omega</math> and <math>g:\\omega\\to\\omega</math> we denote by <math>f\\leq^*g</math> the statement that for all but finitely many <math>n\\in\\omega, f(n)\\leq g(n)</math>. The ''[[bounding number]]'' <math>\\mathfrak b</math> is the least cardinality of an unbounded set in this relation, that is, <math>\\mathfrak b = \\min(\\{|F| : F\\subseteq\\omega^\\omega\\land\\forall f:\\omega\\to\\omega\\exists g\\in F(g\\nleq^*f)\\}).</math>\n\nThe ''[[dominating number]]'' <math>\\mathfrak d</math> is the least cardinality of a set of functions from <math>\\omega</math> to <math>\\omega</math> such that every such function is dominated by (that is, <math>\\leq^*</math>) a member of that set, that is,\n<math>\\mathfrak d = \\min(\\{|F| : F\\subseteq\\omega^\\omega\\land\\forall f:\\omega\\to\\omega\\exists g\\in F(f\\leq^*g)\\}).</math>\n\nClearly any such dominating set <math>F</math> is unbounded, so <math>\\mathfrak b</math> is at most <math>\\mathfrak d</math>, and a diagonalisation argument shows that <math>\\mathfrak b>\\aleph_0</math>. Of course if <math>\\mathfrak c=\\aleph_1</math> this implies that <math>\\mathfrak b=\\mathfrak d=\\aleph_1</math>, but Hechler<ref>Stephen Hechler.

That is, <math>\\mathfrak r = \\min(\\{|R| : R\\subseteq[\\omega]^\\omega\\land\\forall a\\in[\\omega]^\\omega\\exists b\\in R(|b\\cap a|<\\aleph_0\\lor|b\\setminus a|<\\aleph_0)\\}).</math>\n\n===Ultrafilter number <math>\\mathfrak u</math>===\n\nThe ultrafilter number <math>\\mathfrak u</math> is defined to be the least cardinality of a [[Filter base#Filter on a set|filter base]] of a non-principal [[ultrafilter]] on <math>\\omega</math>.

A ''maximal almost disjoint'' (mad) family of subsets of <math>\\omega</math> is thus an almost disjoint family <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>\nsuch that for every subset <math>X</math> of <math>\\omega</math> not in <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>, there is a set <math>A\\in\\mathcal{A}</math> such that <math>A</math> and <math>X</math> are not almost disjoint\n(that is, their intersection is infinite).

      "text": "In [[set theory]], the '''cardinality of the continuum''' is the [[cardinality]] or \"size\" of the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[real numbers]] <math>\\mathbb R</math>, sometimes called the [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]]. It is an [[Infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number]] and is denoted by <math>|\\mathbb R|</math> or <math>\\mathfrak c</math> (a lowercase [[fraktur (script)|fraktur script]] \"c\").\n\nThe real numbers <math>\\mathbb R</math> are more numerous than the [[natural numbers]] <math>\\mathbb N</math>. Moreover, <math>\\mathbb R</math> has the same number of elements as the [[power set]] of <math>\\mathbb N</math>. Symbolically, if the cardinality of <math>\\mathbb N</math> is denoted as [[aleph number#Aleph-naught|<math>\\aleph_0</math>]], the cardinality of the continuum is\n{{block indent|<math>\\mathfrak c = 2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0 \\,. </math>}}\nThis was proven by [[Georg Cantor]] in his [[Cantor's first uncountability proof|1874 uncountability proof]], part of his groundbreaking study of different infinities; the inequality was later stated more simply in his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. Cantor defined cardinality in terms of [[bijective function]]s: two sets have the same cardinality if and only if there exists a bijective function between them.\n\nBetween any two real numbers ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b'', no matter how close they are to each other, there are always infinitely many other real numbers, and Cantor showed that they are as many as those contained in the whole set of real numbers. In other words, the [[open interval]] (''a'',''b'') is [[equinumerous]] with <math>\\mathbb R.</math> This is also true for several other infinite sets, such as any ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] <math>\\mathbb R^n</math> (see [[space filling curve]]). That is,\n{{block indent|<math>|(a,b)| = |\\mathbb R| = |\\mathbb R^n|.</math>}}\n\nThe smallest infinite cardinal number is <math>\\aleph_0</math> ([[aleph number#Aleph-naught|aleph-null]]). The second smallest is <math>\\aleph_1</math> ([[aleph number#Aleph-one|aleph-one]]). The [[continuum hypothesis]], which asserts that there are no sets whose cardinality is strictly between <math>\\aleph_0</math> and {{nowrap|<math>\\mathfrak c</math>,}} implies that <math>\\mathfrak c = \\aleph_1</math>.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Uncountability===\n[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the concept of [[cardinality]] to compare the sizes of infinite sets. He famously showed that the set of real numbers is [[uncountably infinite]]; i.e. <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math> is strictly greater than the cardinality of the [[natural numbers]], <math>\\aleph_0</math>:\n{{block indent|<math>\\aleph_0 < \\mathfrak c.</math>}}\nIn other words, there are strictly more real numbers than there are integers. Cantor proved this statement in several different ways. See [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]].\n\n===Cardinal equalities===\nA variation on Cantor's diagonal argument can be used to prove [[Cantor's theorem]] which states that the cardinality of any set is strictly less than that of its [[power set]], i.e. <math>|A| < 2^{|A|}</math>, and so the power set <math>\\wp(\\mathbb N)</math> of the [[natural number]]s <math>\\mathbb N</math> is uncountable. In fact, it can be shown{{citation_needed|date=September 2017}} that the cardinality of <math>\\wp(\\mathbb N)</math> is equal to <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math>:\n#Define a map <math>f:\\mathbb R\\to\\wp(\\mathbb Q)</math> from the reals to the power set of the [[rationals]], <math>\\mathbb Q</math> by sending each real number <math>x</math> to the set <math>\\{q \\in \\mathbb{Q}: q \\leq x\\}</math> of all rationals less than or equal to <math>x</math> (with the reals viewed as [[Dedekind cut]]s, this is nothing other than the [[inclusion map]] in the set of sets of rationals). This map is [[Injective function|injective]] since the rationals are [[Dense set|dense]] in '''R'''. Since the rationals are countable we have that <math>\\mathfrak c \\le 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>.\n#Let <math>\\{0,2\\}^{\\mathbb N}</math> be the set of infinite [[sequence]]s with values in set <math>\\{0,2\\}</math>. This set has cardinality <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> (the natural [[bijection]] between the set of binary sequences and <math>\\wp(\\mathbb N)</math> is given by the [[indicator function]]). Now associate to each such sequence <math>(a_i)_{i\\in\\mathbb N}</math> the unique real number in the [[unit interval|interval]] <math>[0,1]</math> with the [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]]-expansion given by the digits <math>a_1,a_2,\\dotsc</math>, i.e., <math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i3^{-i}</math>, the <math>i</math>-th digit after the fractional point is <math>a_i</math> with respect to base <math>3</math>. The image of this map is called the [[Cantor set]]. It is not hard to see that this map is injective, for by avoiding points with the digit 1 in their ternary expansion we avoid conflicts created by the fact that the ternary-expansion of a real number is not unique. We then have that <math>2^{\\aleph_0} \\le \\mathfrak c</math>.\nBy the [[Cantor–Bernstein–Schroeder theorem]] we conclude that\n{{block indent|<math>\\mathfrak c = |\\wp(\\mathbb{N})| = 2^{\\aleph_0}.</math>}}\n\nThe cardinal equality <math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\mathfrak{c}</math> can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:\n{{block indent|<math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = (2^{\\aleph_0})^2 = 2^{2\\times{\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c}.</math>}}\n\nBy using the rules of cardinal arithmetic one can also show that\n{{block indent|<math>\\mathfrak c^{\\aleph_0} = {\\aleph_0}^{\\aleph_0} = n^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak c^n = \\aleph_0 \\mathfrak c = n \\mathfrak c = \\mathfrak c,</math>}}\nwhere ''n'' is any finite cardinal ≥ 2, and\n{{block indent|<math> \\mathfrak c ^{\\mathfrak c}  =  (2^{\\aleph_0})^{\\mathfrak c}  = 2^{\\mathfrak c\\times\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\mathfrak c},</math>}}\nwhere <math>2 ^{\\mathfrak c}</math> is the cardinality of the power set of '''R''', and <math>2 ^{\\mathfrak c} > \\mathfrak c </math>.\n\n===Alternative explanation for <math>{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>===\nEvery real number has at least one infinite [[decimal expansion]].  For example,\n{{block indent|1=1/2 = 0.50000...}}\n{{block indent|1=1/3 = 0.33333...}}\n{{block indent|1=π = 3.14159....}}\n(This is true even when the expansion repeats as in the first two examples.)\nIn any given case, the number of digits is [[countable set|countable]] since they can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with the set of natural numbers <math>\\mathbb{N}</math>. This fact makes it sensible to talk about (for example) the first, the one-hundredth, or the millionth digit of π. Since the natural numbers have cardinality <math>\\aleph_0,</math> each real number has <math>\\aleph_0</math> digits in its expansion.\n\nSince each real number can be broken into an integer part and a decimal fraction, we get\n{{block indent|<math>{\\mathfrak c} \\leq \\aleph_0 \\cdot 10^{\\aleph_0} \\leq 2^{\\aleph_0} \\cdot {(2^4)}^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0 + 4 \\cdot \\aleph_0} = 2^{\\aleph_0} </math>}}\n\nsince\n{{block indent|<math>\\aleph_0 + 4 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0 \\,.</math>}}\n\nOn the other hand, if we map <math>2 = \\{0, 1\\}</math> to <math>\\{3, 7\\}</math> and consider that decimal fractions containing only 3 or 7 are only a part of the real numbers, then we get\n{{block indent|<math>2^{\\aleph_0} \\leq {\\mathfrak c} \\,.</math>}}\n\nand thus\n{{block indent|<math>{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} \\,.</math>}}\n\n==Beth numbers==\n{{main|Beth number}}\nThe sequence of beth numbers is defined by setting <math>\\beth_0 = \\aleph_0</math> and <math>\\beth_{k+1} = 2^{\\beth_k}</math>. So <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math> is the second beth number, '''beth-one''':\n{{block indent|<math>\\mathfrak c = \\beth_1.</math>}}\nThe third beth number, '''beth-two''', is the cardinality of the power set of '''R''' (i.e. the set of all subsets of the [[real line]]):\n{{block indent|<math>2^\\mathfrak c = \\beth_2.</math>}}\n\n==The continuum hypothesis==\n{{main|Continuum hypothesis}}\n\nThe famous continuum hypothesis asserts that <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math> is also the second [[aleph number]]  <math>\\aleph_1</math>. In other words, the continuum hypothesis states that there is no set <math>A</math> whose cardinality lies strictly between <math>\\aleph_0</math> and <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math>\n{{block indent|<math>\\nexists A \\quad:\\quad \\aleph_0 < |A| < \\mathfrak c.</math>}}\nThis statement is now known to be independent of the axioms of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the axiom of choice (ZFC). That is, both the hypothesis and its negation are consistent with these axioms. In fact, for every nonzero [[natural number]] ''n'', the equality <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math> = <math>\\aleph_n</math> is independent of ZFC (the case <math>n=1</math> is the continuum hypothesis). The same is true for most other alephs, although in some cases equality can be ruled out by [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]] on the grounds of [[cofinality]], e.g.,  <math>\\mathfrak{c}\\neq\\aleph_\\omega.</math> In particular,  <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> could be either <math>\\aleph_1</math> or  <math>\\aleph_{\\omega_1}</math>, where <math>\\omega_1</math> is the [[first uncountable ordinal]], so it could be either a [[successor cardinal]] or a [[limit cardinal]], and either a [[regular cardinal]] or a [[singular cardinal]].\n\n==Sets with cardinality of the continuum==\n\nA great many sets studied in mathematics have cardinality equal to <math>{\\mathfrak c}</math>. Some common examples are the following:\n\n{{unordered list\n|the [[real number]]s <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>\n|any ([[Degeneracy (mathematics)|nondegenerate]]) closed or open [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> (such as the [[unit interval]] <math>[0,1]</math>)\n\nFor instance, for all <math>a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}</math> such that <math>a < b</math> we can define the bijection\n{{block indent|<math>\\begin{align}\n f\\colon \\mathbb{R} &\\to (a,b)\\\\\n x &\\mapsto \\frac{\\arctan x + \\frac{\\pi}{2}}{\\pi}\\cdot(b - a) + a\n\\end{align}</math>}}\nNow we show the cardinality of an infinite interval. For all <math>a \\in \\mathbb{R}</math> we can define the bijection\n{{block indent|<math>\\begin{align}\n f\\colon \\mathbb{R} &\\to (a,\\infty)\\\\\n x &\\mapsto \\begin{cases}\n\\arctan x + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + a & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\\nx + \\frac{\\pi}{2} + a & \\mbox{if } x \\ge 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>}}\nand similarly for all <math>b \\in \\mathbb{R}</math>\n{{block indent|<math>\\begin{align}\n f\\colon \\mathbb{R} &\\to (-\\infty,b)\\\\\n x &\\mapsto \\begin{cases}\nx - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + b & \\mbox{if } x < 0 \\\\\n\\arctan x - \\frac{\\pi}{2} + b & \\mbox{if } x \\ge 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\end{align}</math>}}\n|the [[irrational number]]s\n|the [[transcendental numbers]]\n\nWe note that the set of real [[algebraic number]]s is countably infinite (assign to each formula its [[Gödel numbering|Gödel number]].) So the cardinality of the real algebraic numbers is <math>\\aleph_0</math>. Furthermore, the real algebraic numbers and the real transcendental numbers are disjoint sets whose union is <math>\\mathbb R</math>.

All these cardinals are greater than or equal to <math>\\aleph_1</math>, the smallest uncountable cardinal, and they are bounded above by <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math>, the [[cardinality of the continuum]].

      "text": "{{About|the hypothesis in set theory|the assumption in fluid mechanics|Fluid mechanics}}\n{{short description|proposition in mathematical logic}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''continuum hypothesis''' (abbreviated '''CH''') is a hypothesis about the possible sizes of [[infinite set]]s. It states:\n{{quote|There is no set whose [[cardinality]] is strictly between that of the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s.}}\n\nThe continuum hypothesis was advanced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1878, and\nestablishing its truth or falsehood is the first of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's 23&nbsp;problems]] presented in 1900. Τhe answer to this problem is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC set theory]] (that is, Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]] included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], complementing earlier work by [[Kurt Gödel]] in 1940.\n\nThe name of the hypothesis comes from the term ''[[continuum (set theory)|the continuum]]'' for the real numbers.\n\n==History==\nCantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain {{harv|Dauben|1990}}. It became the first on David Hilbert's [[Hilbert's problems|list of important open questions]] that was presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the year 1900 in Paris. [[Axiomatic set theory]] was at that point not yet formulated. \n[[Kurt Gödel]] proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory.  The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis – i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set – was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].\n\n==Cardinality of infinite sets==\n{{Main|Cardinal number}}\n\nTwo sets are said to have the same ''[[cardinality]]'' or ''[[cardinal number]]'' if there exists a [[bijection]] (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets ''S'' and ''T'' to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to \"pair off\" elements of ''S'' with elements of ''T'' in such a fashion that every element of ''S'' is paired off with exactly one element of ''T'' and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.\n\nWith infinite sets such as the set of [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers.  However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are [[infinite set|infinite]].  It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (''cardinality'') as the set of integers: they are both [[countable set]]s.\n\nCantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of [[integer]]s is strictly smaller than that of the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, ''S'', of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into ''S''. Using the fact that the real numbers are [[equinumerous]] with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set <math>S</math> for which <math> \\aleph_0 < |S| < 2^{\\aleph_0}. </math>\n\nAssuming the [[axiom of choice]], [[aleph numbers|there is a smallest cardinal number <math>\\aleph_1</math> greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math>]], and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality <math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1. </math>\n\nThere is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the '''generalized continuum hypothesis''' ('''GCH''') which says that for every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] &alpha;, <math>2^{\\aleph_\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}.</math> That is, GCH asserts that the cardinality of the [[power set]] of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.\n\n==Independence from ZFC==\n\nThe independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) follows from combined work of [[Kurt Gödel]]  and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].\n\n{{harvtxt|Gödel|1940}} showed that CH cannot be disproved from ZF, even if the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) is adopted (making ZFC). Gödel's proof shows that CH and AC both hold in the [[constructible universe]] L, an [[inner model]] of ZF set theory, assuming only the axioms of ZF.  The existence of an inner model of ZF  in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are [[consistent]] with ZF, provided ZF itself is consistent. The latter condition cannot be proved in ZF itself, due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]], but is widely believed to be true and can be proved in stronger set theories.\n\nCohen ([[#{{harvid|Cohen|1963}}|1963]], [[#{{harvid|Cohen|1964}}|1964]]) showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof.  To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which has become a standard tool in set theory.  Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1966 for his proof.\n\nThe independence proof just described shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known ''[[large cardinal axiom]]s'' in the context of ZFC. ({{harvtxt|Feferman|1999}})   Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]]. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if <math>\\kappa</math> is a cardinal of uncountable [[cofinality]], then there is a forcing extension in which <math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa</math>. However, per König's theorem, it is not consistent to assume <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> or <math>\\aleph_{\\omega_1+\\omega}</math> or any cardinal with cofinality <math>\\omega</math>.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], point set [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. As a result of its independence, many substantial [[conjecture]]s in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.\n\nThe independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible.  However, Gödel and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see {{harvs|last=Woodin|year=2001a|year2=2001b|txt}} and {{harvtxt|Koellner|2011a}} for an overview of the current research status.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]], which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate [[Gödel numbering]] scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.\n\n==Arguments for and against the continuum hypothesis==\nGödel believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo–Fraenkel]] axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets.  Gödel was a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|platonist]] and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] {{harv|Goodman|1979}}, also tended towards rejecting CH.\n\nHistorically, mathematicians who favored a \"rich\" and \"large\" [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets were against CH, while those favoring a \"neat\" and \"controllable\" universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the [[axiom of constructibility]], which implies CH. More recently, [[Matthew Foreman]] has pointed out that [[ontological maximalism]] can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with \"more\" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&nbsp;500).\n\nAnother viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by [[Skolem]], even before Gödel's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]], and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the [[axiom of constructibility]] does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&nbsp;171).\n\nAt least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry]], a statement about [[probability|probabilities]]. Freiling believes this axiom is \"intuitively true\" but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by [[W. Hugh Woodin]] has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.\n\n[[Solomon Feferman]] (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem.  He proposes a theory of \"definiteness\" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts [[classical logic]] for bounded quantifiers but uses [[intuitionistic logic]] for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition <math>\\phi</math> is mathematically \"definite\" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove <math>(\\phi \\lor \\neg\\phi)</math>.  He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. [[Peter Koellner]] (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.\n\n[[Joel David Hamkins]] proposes a [[Multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]] approach to set theory and argues that \"the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.\" (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, [[Saharon Shelah]] wrote that he does \"not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC.\" (Shelah 2003).\n\n==The generalized continuum hypothesis==<!-- This section is linked from [[Forcing (mathematics)]] -->\nThe ''generalized continuum hypothesis'' (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set ''S'' and that of the [[power set]] of ''S'', then it either has the same cardinality as the set ''S'' or the same cardinality as the power set of ''S''. That is, for any [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] <math>\\lambda</math> there is no cardinal <math>\\kappa</math> such that <math>\\lambda <\\kappa <2^{\\lambda}.</math> GCH is equivalent to:\n:<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha+1}=2^{\\aleph_\\alpha}</math> for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] <math>\\alpha.</math>  (occasionally called '''Cantor's aleph hypothesis''')\nThe [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: <math>\\aleph_\\alpha=\\beth_\\alpha</math> for every ordinal <math>\\alpha.</math>\n\nThis is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. It was first suggested by {{harvs|txt|last=Jourdain|authorlink=Philip Jourdain|year=1905}}. (For the early history of GCH, see {{harvs|txt|last=Moore|year=2011}}).\n\nLike CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wacław Sierpiński|Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) (and therefore the negation of the [[axiom of determinacy]], AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpiński showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some [[Aleph number]], and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than <math>2^{\\aleph_0+n}</math> which is  smaller than its own [[Hartogs number]]—this uses the equality <math>2^{\\aleph_0+n}\\, = \\,2\\cdot\\,2^{\\aleph_0+n} </math>; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).\n\n[[Kurt Gödel]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC.

      "text": "{{Redirect|Countable|the linguistic concept|Count noun|the political media company|Countable (app)}}\n{{distinguish|text= [[recursively enumerable set|(recursively) enumerable sets]]}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''countable set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] with the same [[cardinality]] ([[cardinal number|number]] of elements) as some [[subset]] of the set of [[natural number]]s. A countable set is either a [[finite set]] or a '''countably infinite''' set. Whether finite or infinite, the elements of a countable set can always be counted one at a time and, although the counting may never finish, every element of the set is associated with a unique natural number.\n\nSome authors use countable set to mean ''countably infinite'' alone.<ref name=\"Rudin\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Rudin|1976|loc=Chapter 2}}</ref> To avoid this ambiguity, the term ''at most countable'' may be used when finite sets are included and ''countably infinite'', ''enumerable'',<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kamke|1950|page=2}}</ref> or ''denumerable''<ref name=\"Lang\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lang|1993|loc=&sect;2 of Chapter I}}</ref> otherwise.\n\n[[Georg Cantor]] introduced the term ''countable set'', contrasting sets that are countable with those that are ''[[uncountable set|uncountable]]'' (i.e., ''nonenumerable'' or ''nondenumerable''<ref name=\"Apostol\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Apostol|1969|loc=Chapter 13.19}}</ref>). Today, countable sets form the foundation of a branch of mathematics called ''[[discrete mathematics]]''.\n\n==Definition==\nA set {{mvar|S}} is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] {{mvar|f}} from {{mvar|S}} to the [[natural numbers]] {{math|1='''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}}}.<ref>Since there is an obvious [[bijection]] between {{math|'''N'''}} and {{math|1='''N'''* = {1, 2, 3, ...}}}, it makes no difference whether one considers 0  a natural number or not. In any case, this article follows [[ISO 31-11]] and the standard convention in [[mathematical logic]], which takes 0 as a natural number.</ref>\n\nIf such an  {{mvar|f}} can be found that is also [[surjective function|surjective]] (and therefore [[bijection|bijective]]), then {{mvar|S}} is called ''countably [[infinite set|infinite]].''\n\nIn other words, a set is ''countably infinite'' if it has [[One-one correspondence|one-to-one correspondence]] with the natural number set, {{math|'''N'''}}.\n\nAs noted above, this terminology is not universal. Some authors use countable to mean what is here called ''countably infinite,'' and do not include finite sets.\n\nAlternative (equivalent) formulations of the definition in terms of a [[bijective]] function or a [[surjective]] function can also be given. See below.\n\n==History==\nIn 1874, in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], Cantor proved that the set of [[real number]]s is uncountable, thus showing that not all infinite sets are countable.<ref>{{citation|title=Roads to Infinity: The Mathematics of Truth and Proof|first=John C.|last=Stillwell|authorlink=John Stillwell|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781439865507|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XvPRBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|quote=Cantor's discovery of uncountable sets in 1874 was one of the most unexpected events in the history of mathematics. Before 1874, infinity was not even considered a legitimate mathematical subject by most people, so the need to distinguish between countable and uncountable infinities could not have been imagined.}}</ref> In 1878, he used one-to-one correspondences to define and compare cardinalities.<ref>Cantor 1878, p.&nbsp;242.</ref> In 1883, he extended the natural numbers with his infinite [[ordinal number|ordinals]], and used sets of ordinals to produce an infinity of sets having different infinite cardinalities.<ref>Ferreirós 2007, pp. 268, 272&ndash;273.</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nA ''[[Set (mathematics)|set]]'' is a collection of ''elements'', and may be described in many ways. One way is simply to list all of its elements; for example, the set consisting of the integers 3, 4, and 5 may be denoted {3, 4, 5}. This is only effective for small sets, however; for larger sets, this would be time-consuming and error-prone. Instead of listing every single element, sometimes an ellipsis (\"...\") is used, if the writer believes that the reader can easily guess what is missing; for example, {1, 2, 3, ..., 100} presumably denotes the set of [[integer]]s from 1 to 100. Even in this case, however, it is still ''possible'' to list all the elements, because the set is ''finite''.\n\nSome sets are ''infinite''; these sets have more than ''n'' elements for any integer ''n''. For example, the set of natural numbers, denotable by {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, has infinitely many elements, and we cannot use any normal number to give its size. Nonetheless, it turns out that infinite sets do have a well-defined notion of size (or more properly, of ''cardinality'', which is the technical term for the number of elements in a set), and not all infinite sets have the same cardinality.\n\n[[File:Aplicación 2 inyectiva sobreyectiva02.svg|thumb|x100px|Bijective mapping from integer to even numbers]]\nTo understand what this means, we first examine what it ''does not'' mean. For example, there are infinitely many odd integers, infinitely many even integers, and (hence) infinitely many integers overall. However, it turns out that the number of even integers, which is the same as the number of odd integers, is also the same as the number of integers overall. This is because we arrange things such that for every integer, there is a distinct even integer: ... −2→−4, −1→−2, 0→0, 1→2, 2→4, ...; or, more generally, ''n''→2''n'', see picture. What we have done here is arranged the integers and the even integers into a ''one-to-one correspondence'' (or ''[[bijection]]''), which is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that maps between two sets such that each element of each set corresponds to a single element in the other set.\n\nHowever, not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. For example, [[Georg Cantor]] (who introduced this concept) demonstrated that the real numbers cannot be put into one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (non-negative integers), and therefore that the set of real numbers has a greater cardinality than the set of natural numbers.\n\nA set is ''countable'' if: (1) it is finite, or (2) it has the same cardinality (size) as the set of natural numbers. Equivalently, a set is ''countable'' if it has the same cardinality as some [[subset]] of the set of natural numbers. Otherwise, it is ''uncountable''.\n\n==Formal overview without details==\nBy definition a set ''S'' is ''countable'' if there exists an [[injective function]] ''f'' : ''S'' → '''N''' from ''S'' to the [[natural numbers]] '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.\n\nIt might seem natural to divide the sets into different classes: put all the sets containing one element together; all the sets containing two elements together; ...; finally, put together all infinite sets and consider them as having the same size.\nThis view is not tenable, however, under the natural definition of size.\n\nTo elaborate this we need the concept of a [[bijection]]. Although a \"bijection\" seems a more advanced concept than a number, the usual development of mathematics in terms of set theory defines functions before numbers, as they are based on much simpler sets. This is where the concept of a bijection comes in: define the correspondence\n\n:''a'' ↔ 1, ''b'' ↔ 2, ''c'' ↔ 3\n\nSince every element of {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} is paired with ''precisely one'' element of {1, 2, 3}, ''and'' vice versa, this defines a bijection.\n\nWe now generalize this situation and ''define'' two sets as of the same size if (and only if) there is a bijection between them. For all finite sets this gives us the usual definition of \"the same size\". What does it tell us about the size of infinite sets?\n\nConsider the sets ''A'' = {1, 2, 3, ... }, the set of positive [[integer]]s and ''B'' = {2, 4, 6, ... }, the set of even positive integers. We claim that, under our definition, these sets have the same size, and that therefore ''B'' is countably infinite. Recall that to prove this we need to exhibit a bijection between them. But this is easy, using ''n'' ↔ 2''n'', so that\n:1 ↔ 2, 2 ↔ 4, 3 ↔ 6, 4 ↔ 8, ....\n\nAs in the earlier example, every element of A has been paired off with precisely one element of B, and vice versa. Hence they have the same size. This is an example of a set of the same size as one of its proper subsets, which is impossible for finite sets.\n\nLikewise, the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is countably infinite, as can be seen by following a path like the one in the picture: [[File:Pairing natural.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Cantor pairing function]] assigns one natural number to each pair of natural numbers]] The resulting mapping is like this:\n:0 ↔ (0,0), 1 ↔ (1,0), 2 ↔ (0,1), 3 ↔ (2,0), 4 ↔ (1,1), 5 ↔ (0,2), 6 ↔ (3,0) ....\nThis mapping covers all such ordered pairs.\n\nIf each pair is treated as the [[numerator]] and [[denominator]] of a [[vulgar fraction]], then for every positive fraction, we can come up with a distinct number corresponding to it. This representation includes also the natural numbers, since every natural number is also a fraction ''N''/1. So we can conclude that there are exactly as many positive rational numbers as there are positive integers. This is true also for all rational numbers, as can be seen below.\n\n'''Theorem:''' The [[Cartesian product]] of finitely many countable sets is countable.\n\nThis form of triangular [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] [[recursion|recursively]] generalizes to [[vector space|vectors]] of finitely many natural numbers by repeatedly mapping the first two elements to a natural number. For example, (0,2,3) maps to (5,3), which maps to 39.\n\nSometimes more than one mapping is useful: the set to be shown to be countably infinite is mapped onto another set, then this other set is mapped onto to the natural numbers. For example, the positive [[rational number]]s can easily be mapped to (a subset of) the pairs of natural numbers because ''p''/''q ''maps to (''p'', ''q'').\n\nWhat about infinite subsets of countably infinite sets? Do these have fewer elements than '''N'''?\n\n'''Theorem:''' Every subset of a countable set is countable. In particular, every infinite subset of a countably infinite set is countably infinite.\n\nFor example, the set of [[prime number]]s is countable, by mapping the ''n''-th prime number to ''n'':\n*2 maps to 1\n*3 maps to 2\n*5 maps to 3\n*7 maps to 4\n*11 maps to 5\n*13 maps to 6\n*17 maps to 7\n*19 maps to 8\n*23 maps to 9\n*...\n\nWhat about sets being naturally \"larger than\" '''N'''? For instance, '''Z''' the set of all [[integer]]s or '''Q''', the set of all [[rational number]]s, which intuitively may seem much bigger than '''N'''. But looks can be deceiving, for we assert:\n\n'''Theorem:''' '''Z''' (the set of all integers) and '''Q''' (the set of all rational numbers) are countable.\n\nIn a similar manner, the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Kamke|1950|pages=3–4}}</ref>\n\nThese facts follow easily from a result that many individuals find non-intuitive.\n\n'''Theorem:''' Any finite [[union (set theory)|union]] of countable sets is countable. \n<!--\n'''Q''' can be defined as the set of all fractions ''a''/''b'' where ''a'' and ''b'' are integers and ''b'' > 0.

Explicitly, this means that there is a [[bijective function]] from ''A'' onto some proper subset ''B'' of ''A''. A set is '''Dedekind-finite''' if it is not Dedekind-infinite.

In the early twentieth century, [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], today the most commonly used form of [[axiomatic set theory]], was proposed as an [[axiomatic system]] to formulate a [[theory of sets]] free of paradoxes such as [[Russell's paradox]]. Using the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the originally highly controversial [[axiom of choice]] included ('''ZFC''') one can show that a set is Dedekind-finite if and only if it is [[finite set|finite]] in the sense of having a finite number of elements. However, there exists a model of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice ('''ZF''') in which there exists an infinite, Dedekind-finite set, showing that the axioms of '''ZF''' are not strong enough to prove that every set that is Dedekind-finite has a finite number of elements.<ref name=\"herrlich\">{{cite book |title=Axiom of Choice |last=Herrlich | first=Horst |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1876 |isbn=978-3540309895}}</ref><ref name=\"moore\"/> There are [[finite set#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness|definitions of finiteness and infiniteness of sets]] besides the one given by Dedekind that do not depend on the axiom of choice.\n\nA vaguely related notion is that of a '''Dedekind-finite ring'''.  A ring is said to be a Dedekind-finite ring if {{nowrap|1=''ab'' = 1}} implies {{nowrap|1=''ba'' = 1}} for any two ring elements ''a'' and ''b''.  These rings have also been called '''directly finite''' rings.\n\n==Comparison with the usual definition of infinite set==\nThis definition of \"[[infinite set]]\" should be compared with the usual definition: a set ''A'' is [[finite set|infinite]] when it cannot be put in bijection with a finite [[ordinal number|ordinal]], namely a set of the form {{nowrap|{0, 1, 2, ..., ''n''&minus;1}{{null}}}} for some natural number ''n'' – an infinite set is one that is literally \"not finite\", in the sense of bijection.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, most [[mathematician]]s simply assumed that a set is infinite [[iff|if and only if]] it is Dedekind-infinite. However, this equivalence cannot be proved with the [[axiomatic set theory|axioms]] of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) (usually denoted \"'''ZF'''\"). The full strength of AC is not needed to prove the equivalence; in fact, the equivalence of the two definitions is [[strictly]] weaker than the [[axiom of countable choice]] (CC). (See the references below.)\n\n==Dedekind-infinite sets in ZF==\nThe following conditions are equivalent in '''ZF'''. In particular, note that all these conditions can be proved to be equivalent without using the AC.\n\n*''A'' is '''Dedekind-infinite'''.\n*There is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} that is [[injective function|injective]] but not [[surjective function|surjective]].\n*There is an injective function {{nowrap|''f'' : '''N''' → ''A''}}, where '''N''' denotes the set of all [[natural number]]s.\n*''A'' has a [[countable set|countably infinite]] subset.\n\nEvery Dedekind-infinite set ''A'' also satisfies the following condition:\n*There is a function {{nowrap|1=''f'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} that is surjective but not injective.\nThis is sometimes written as \"''A'' is '''dually Dedekind-infinite'''\".\nIt  is not provable (in '''ZF''' without the AC) that dual Dedekind-infinity implies that ''A'' is Dedekind-infinite. (For example, if ''B'' is an infinite but Dedekind-finite set, and ''A'' is the set of finite [[injective|one-to-one]] [[sequences]] from ''B'', then  \"drop the last element\" is a surjective but not injective function from ''A'' to ''A'', yet ''A'' is Dedekind finite.)\n\nIt can be proved in ZF that every dually Dedekind infinite set satisfies the following (equivalent) conditions:\n*There exists a surjective map from ''A'' onto a countably infinite set.\n*The powerset of ''A'' is Dedekind infinite\n(Sets satisfying these properties are sometimes called '''weakly Dedekind infinite'''.)\n\nIt can be shown in ZF that weakly Dedekind infinite sets are infinite.\n\nZF also shows that every well-ordered infinite set is Dedekind infinite.\n\n==History==\nThe term is named after the German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who first explicitly introduced the definition. It is notable that this definition was the first definition of \"infinite\" that did not rely on the definition of the [[natural number]]s (unless one follows Poincaré and regards the notion of number as prior to even the notion of set). Although such a definition was known to [[Bernard Bolzano]], he was prevented from publishing his work in any but the most obscure journals by the terms of his political exile from the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] in 1819. Moreover, Bolzano's definition was more accurately a relation that held between two infinite sets, rather than a definition of an infinite set ''per se''.\n\nFor a long time, many mathematicians did not even entertain the thought that there might be a distinction between the notions of infinite set and Dedekind-infinite set. In fact, the distinction was not really realised until after [[Ernst Zermelo]] formulated the AC explicitly. The existence of infinite, Dedekind-finite sets was studied by [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in 1912; these sets were at first called ''mediate cardinals'' or ''Dedekind cardinals''.\n\nWith the general acceptance of the axiom of choice among the mathematical community, these issues relating to infinite and Dedekind-infinite sets have become less central to most mathematicians. However, the study of Dedekind-infinite sets played an important role in the attempt to clarify the boundary between the finite and the infinite, and also an important role in the history of the AC.\n\n==Relation to the axiom of choice==\nSince every infinite well-ordered set is Dedekind-infinite, and since the AC is equivalent to the [[well-ordering theorem]] stating that every set can be well-ordered, clearly the general AC implies that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite. However, the equivalence of the two definitions is much weaker than the full strength of AC.\n\nIn particular, there exists a model of '''ZF''' in which there exists an infinite set with no [[countable set|countably infinite]] subset. Hence, in this model, there exists an infinite, Dedekind-finite set. By the above, such a set cannot be well-ordered in this model.\n\nIf we assume the axiom CC (i. e., AC<sub>ω</sub>), then it follows that every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite. However, the equivalence of these two definitions is in fact strictly weaker than even the CC. Explicitly, there exists a model of '''ZF''' in which every infinite set is Dedekind-infinite, yet the CC fails (assuming consistency of '''ZF''').\n\n==Proof of equivalence to infinity, assuming axiom of countable choice==\nThat every Dedekind-infinite set is infinite can be easily proven in ZF: every finite set has by definition a bijection with some finite ordinal ''n'', and one can prove by induction on ''n'' that this is not Dedekind-infinite.\n\nBy using the [[axiom of countable choice]] (denotation: axiom CC) one can prove the converse, namely that every infinite set ''X'' is Dedekind-infinite, as follows: \n\nFirst, define a function over the natural numbers (that is, over the finite ordinals) {{nowrap|''f'' : '''N''' → Power(Power(''X''))}}, so that for every natural number ''n'', ''f''(''n'') is the set of finite subsets of ''X'' of size ''n'' (i.e. that have a bijection with the finite ordinal ''n''). ''f''(''n'') is never empty, or otherwise ''X'' would be finite (as can be proven by induction on ''n'').\n\nThe [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of f is the countable set {{nowrap|{''f''(''n'') {{!}} ''n'' ∈ '''N'''},}} whose members are themselves infinite (and possibly uncountable) sets. By using the axiom of countable choice we may choose one member from each of these sets, and this member is itself a finite subset of ''X''. More precisely, according to the axiom of countable choice, a (countable) set exists, {{nowrap|1=''G'' = {''g''(''n'') {{!}} ''n'' ∈ '''N'''},}} so that for every natural number ''n'', ''g''(''n'') is a member of ''f''(''n'') and is therefore a finite subset of ''X'' of size ''n''.\n\nNow, we define ''U'' as the union of the members of ''G''. ''U'' is an infinite countable subset of ''X'', and a bijection from the natural numbers to ''U'', {{nowrap|''h'' : '''N''' → ''U''}}, can be easily defined. We may now define a bijection {{nowrap|''B'' : ''X'' → ''X'' ∖ ''h''(0)}} that takes every member not in ''U'' to itself, and takes ''h''(''n'') for every natural number to {{nowrap|''h''(''n'' + 1)}}. Hence, ''X'' is Dedekind-infinite, and we are done.\n\n==Generalizations==\nExpressed in category-theoretical terms, a set ''A'' is Dedekind-finite if in the category of sets, every monomorphism {{nowrap|''f'' : ''A'' → ''A''}} is an isomorphism. A [[von Neumann regular ring]] ''R'' has the analogous property in the category of (left or right) ''R''-modules if and only if in ''R'', {{nowrap|1=''xy'' = 1}} implies {{nowrap|1=''yx'' = 1}}. More generally, a ''Dedekind-finite ring'' is any ring that satisfies the latter condition. Beware that a ring may be Dedekind-finite even if its underlying set is Dedekind-infinite, e.g. the integers.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Faith, Carl Clifton.

Condition 1 is a well known property of cardinality, while condition 2 follows from [[König's theorem (set theory)|König's theorem]].\n\nIn Easton's model the powersets of [[singular cardinal]]s have the smallest possible cardinality compatible with the conditions that 2<sup>κ</sup> has cofinality greater than κ and is a non-decreasing function of κ.\n\n== No extension to singular cardinals ==\n\n{{harvtxt|Silver|1975}} proved that a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality cannot be the smallest cardinal for which the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]] fails. This shows that Easton's theorem cannot be extended to the class of all cardinals.\nThe program of [[PCF theory]] gives results on the possible values of\n<math>2^\\lambda</math> for singular cardinals <math>\\lambda</math>. PCF theory shows that the values of the [[continuum function]] on singular cardinals are strongly influenced by the values on smaller cardinals, whereas Easton's theorem shows that the values of the continuum function on [[regular cardinal]]s are only weakly influenced by the values on smaller cardinals.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Singular cardinal hypothesis]]\n* [[Aleph number]]\n* [[Beth number]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|authorlink=William Bigelow Easton|first= W.|last= Easton|title= Powers of regular cardinals|journal=Ann.

[[Georg Cantor]], the inventor of [[set theory]], showed in 1874 that there is more than one kind of infinity, specifically that the collection of all [[natural number]]s and the collection of all [[real number]]s, while both infinite, are not equinumerous (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]). In a controversial 1878 paper, Cantor explicitly defined the notion of \"power\" of sets and used it to prove that the set of all natural numbers and the set of all [[rational numbers]] are equinumerous (an example of the situation where a [[proper subset]] of an infinite set is equinumerous to the original set), and that the [[Cartesian product]] of even a [[countably infinite]] number of copies of the real numbers is equinumerous to a single copy of the real numbers.\n\n[[Cantor's theorem]] from 1891 implies that no set is equinumerous to its own [[power set]] (the set of all its subsets).<ref name=\"suppes\"/> This allows the definition of greater and greater infinite sets starting from a single infinite set.\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, then the [[cardinal number]] of a set may be regarded as the least [[ordinal number]] of that cardinality (see [[initial ordinal]]).

Within the framework of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, [[binary relation|relations]] are by definition restricted to sets (a binary relation on a set ''A'' is a [[subset]] of the [[Cartesian product]] {{nowrap|''A'' × ''A''}}), and there is no [[set of all sets]] in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, instead of defining the cardinality of a set as the equivalence class of all sets equinumerous to it one tries to assign a representative set to each equivalence class ([[cardinal assignment]]). In some other systems of axiomatic set theory, e.g. [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] and [[Morse–Kelley set theory]], relations are extended to [[class (mathematics)|classes]].\n\nA set ''A'' is said to have cardinality smaller than or equal to the cardinality of a set ''B'' if there exists a [[one-to-one function]] (an injection) from ''A'' into ''B''. This is denoted {{nowrap begin}}|''A''| ≤ |''B''|.{{nowrap end}} If ''A'' and ''B'' are not equinumerous, then the cardinality of ''A'' is said to be strictly smaller than the cardinality of ''B''.

By Cantor's theorem, the cardinality of each set in this sequence strictly exceeds the cardinality of the set preceding it, leading to greater and greater infinite sets.\n\nCantor's work was harshly criticized by some of his contemporaries, e.g. by [[Leopold Kronecker]], who strongly adhered to a [[finitism|finitist]]<ref name=\"tiles\">{{cite book |last=Tiles |first=Mary |authorlink=Mary Tiles |title=The Philosophy of Set Theory: An Historical Introduction to Cantor's Paradise |year=2004 |origyear=Originally published by Basil Blackwell Ltd. in 1989 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0486435206}}</ref> [[philosophy of mathematics]] and rejected the idea that numbers can form an actual, completed totality (an [[actual infinity]]). However, Cantor's ideas were defended by others, e.g. by [[Richard Dedekind]], and ultimately were largely accepted, strongly supported by [[David Hilbert]]. See [[Controversy over Cantor's theory]].\n\nWithin the framework of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], the [[axiom of power set]] guarantees the existence of the power set of any given set. Furthermore, the [[axiom of infinity]] guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. There are [[alternative set theory|alternative set theories]], e.g. \"[[general set theory]]\" (GST), [[Kripke–Platek set theory]], and [[pocket set theory]] (PST), that deliberately omit the axiom of power set and the axiom of infinity and do not allow the definition of the infinite hierarchy of infinites proposed by Cantor.\n\nThe cardinalities corresponding to the sets '''N''', ''P''('''N'''), ''P''(''P''('''N''')), {{nowrap|''P''(''P''(''P''('''N'''))), …}} are the [[beth number]]s <math>\\beth_0</math>, <math>\\beth_1</math>, <math>\\beth_2</math>, {{nowrap|<math>\\beth_3</math>, …,}} with the first beth number <math>\\beth_0</math> being equal to <math>\\aleph_0</math> ([[aleph naught]]), the cardinality of any countably infinite set, and the second beth number <math>\\beth_1</math> being equal to <math>\\mathfrak c</math>, the [[cardinality of the continuum]].\n\n== Dedekind-infinite sets ==\nSometimes a set is equinumerous to some of its [[proper subset]]s, e.g. the set of [[natural number]]s is equinumerous to the set of even natural numbers.

The [[axiom]]s of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] without the axiom of choice (ZF) are not strong enough to prove that every [[infinite set]] is Dedekind-infinite, but the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the [[axiom of countable choice]] ({{nowrap|ZF + AC<sub>ω</sub>}}) are strong enough.<ref name=\"herrlich\">{{cite book |title=Axiom of Choice |last=Herrlich | first=Horst |year=2006 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics 1876 |isbn=978-3540309895}}</ref> Other definitions of finiteness and infiniteness of sets do not require the axiom of choice for this.<ref name=\"suppes\"/>\n\n== Compatibility with set operations ==\nEquinumerosity is compatible with the [[basic set operations]] in a way that allows the definition of [[cardinal arithmetic]].<ref name=\"suppes\"/> Specifically, equinumerosity is compatible with [[disjoint union]]s: Given four sets ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'' with ''A'' and ''C'' on the one hand and ''B'' and ''D'' on the other hand [[pairwise disjoint]] and with {{nowrap|''A'' ~ ''B''}} and {{nowrap|''C'' ~ ''D''}} then {{nowrap|''A'' ∪ ''C'' ~ ''B'' ∪ ''D''.}} This is used to justify the definition of [[cardinal addition]].\n\nFurthermore, equinumerosity is compatible with [[cartesian product]]s:\n* If {{nowrap|''A'' ~ ''B''}} and {{nowrap|''C'' ~ ''D''}} then {{nowrap|''A'' × ''C'' ~ ''B'' × ''D''.}}\n* ''A'' × ''B'' ~ ''B'' × ''A''\n* (''A'' × ''B'') × ''C'' ~ ''A'' × (''B'' × ''C'')\nThese properties are used to justify [[cardinal multiplication]].\n\nExponentiation:\n* If ''A'' ~ ''B'' and ''C'' ~ ''D'' then {{nowrap|''A''<sup>''C''</sup> ~ ''B''<sup>''D''</sup>.}} (Here ''X''<sup>''Y''</sup> denotes the set of all functions from ''Y'' to ''X''.)\n* ''A''<sup>''B'' ∪ ''C''</sup> ~ ''A''<sup>''B''</sup> × ''A''<sup>''C''</sup> for disjoint ''B'' and ''C''.\n* (''A'' × ''B'')<sup>''C''</sup> ~ ''A''<sup>''C''</sup> × ''B''<sup>''C''</sup>\n* (''A''<sup>''B''</sup>)<sup>''C''</sup> ~ ''A''<sup>''B''×''C''</sup>\nThese properties are used to justify [[cardinal exponentiation]].\n\nFurthermore, the [[power set]] of a given set ''A'' (the set of all [[subset]]s of ''A'') is equinumerous to the set 2<sup>''A''</sup>, the set of all functions from the set ''A'' to a set containing exactly two elements.\n\n== Categorial definition ==\nIn [[category of sets|Set]], the [[category (category theory)|category]] of all sets with [[function (mathematics)|function]]s as morphisms, an [[isomorphism]] between two sets is precisely a bijection, and two sets are equinumerous precisely if they are isomorphic in this category.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Combinatorial class]]\n* [[Hume's principle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Basic concepts in infinite set theory]]\n[[Category:Cardinal numbers]]\n\n[[de:Mächtigkeit (Mathematik)#Gleichmächtigkeit, Mächtigkeit]]"

The number of elements of a finite set is a [[natural number]] (a [[non-negative]] [[integer]]) and is called the [[cardinality]] of the set. A set that is not finite is called '''[[infinite set|infinite]]'''. For example, the set of all positive integers is infinite:\n:<math>\\{1,2,3,\\ldots\\}.</math>\nFinite sets are particularly important in [[combinatorics]], the mathematical study of [[counting]].

As a consequence, there cannot exist a [[bijection]] between a finite set ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S''.  Any set with this property is called [[Dedekind-finite]].  Using the standard [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]] axioms for [[set theory]], every Dedekind-finite set is also finite, but this implication cannot be proved in ZF (Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms without the [[axiom of choice]]) alone.  \nThe [[axiom of countable choice]], a weak version of the axiom of choice, is sufficient to prove this equivalence.\n\nAny injective function between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also a [[surjective function]] (a surjection). Similarly, any surjection between two finite sets of the same cardinality is also an injection.\n\nThe [[union (set theory)|union]] of two finite sets is finite, with\n:<math>|S\\cup T| \\le |S| + |T|.</math>\nIn fact:\n:<math>|S\\cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S\\cap T|.</math>\nMore generally, the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of any finite number of finite sets is finite.  The [[Cartesian product]] of finite sets is also finite, with:\n:<math>|S\\times T| = |S|\\times|T|.</math>\nSimilarly, the Cartesian product of finitely many finite sets is finite. A finite set with ''n'' elements has 2{{sup|''n''}} distinct subsets.  That is, the\n[[power set]] of a finite set is finite, with cardinality 2{{sup|''n''}}.\n\nAny subset of a finite set is finite. The set of values of a function when applied to elements of a finite set is finite.\n\nAll finite sets are [[countable]], but not all countable sets are finite.

Thus the distinction between the finite and the infinite lies at the core of set theory. Certain foundationalists, the [[Finitism|strict finitists]], reject the existence of infinite sets and thus recommend a mathematics based solely on finite sets. Mainstream mathematicians consider strict finitism too confining, but acknowledge its relative consistency: the universe of [[hereditarily finite set]]s constitutes a model of [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] with the [[axiom of infinity]] replaced by its negation.\n\nEven for those mathematicians who embrace infinite sets, in certain important contexts, the formal distinction between the finite and the infinite can remain a delicate matter.   The difficulty stems from [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]]. One can interpret the theory of hereditarily finite sets within [[Peano arithmetic]] (and certainly also vice versa), so the incompleteness of the theory of Peano arithmetic implies that of the theory of hereditarily finite sets. In particular, there exists a plethora of so-called [[non-standard models]] of both theories. A seeming paradox is that there are non-standard models of the theory of hereditarily finite sets which contain infinite sets, but these infinite sets look finite from within the model. (This can happen when the model lacks the sets or functions necessary to witness the infinitude of these sets.) On account of the incompleteness theorems, no first-order predicate, nor even any recursive scheme of first-order predicates, can characterize the standard part of all such models.  So, at least from the point of view of first-order logic, one can only hope to describe finiteness approximately.\n\nMore generally, informal notions like set, and particularly finite set, may receive interpretations across a range of [[formal system]]s varying in their axiomatics and logical apparatus. The best known axiomatic set theories include Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC), [[Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory]] (NBG), [[Non-well-founded set theory]], [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[Type theory]] and all the theories of their various models. One may also choose among classical first-order logic, various higher-order logics and [[intuitionistic logic]].\n\nA [[formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] might see the meaning{{fact|date=April 2017}}<!--sure that formalists might attribute meanings to mathematical notions???--> of ''set'' varying from system to system. Some kinds of [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonist]]s might view particular formal systems as approximating an underlying reality.\n\n== Set-theoretic definitions of finiteness ==\n<!--Linked from [[#Necessary and sufficient conditions for finiteness]] above-->\n\nIn contexts where the notion of [[natural number]] sits logically prior to any notion of set, one can define a set ''S'' as finite if ''S'' admits a [[bijection]] to some set of [[natural numbers]] of the form <math>\\{x \\, | \\, x<n\\}</math>. Mathematicians more typically choose to ground notions of number in [[set theory]], for example they might model natural numbers by the order types of finite [[well-ordered]] sets. Such an approach requires a structural definition of finiteness that does not depend on natural numbers.\n\nVarious properties that single out the finite sets among all sets in the theory ZFC turn out logically inequivalent in weaker systems such as ZF or intuitionistic set theories. Two definitions feature prominently in the literature, one due to [[Richard Dedekind]], the other to [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]]. (Kuratowski's is the definition used above.)\n\nA set ''S'' is called [[Dedekind infinite]] if there exists an injective, non-surjective function <math>f:S \\rightarrow S</math>. Such a function exhibits a bijection between ''S'' and a proper subset of ''S'', namely the image of ''f''.  Given a Dedekind infinite set ''S'', a function ''f'', and an element ''x'' that is not in the image of ''f'', we can form an infinite sequence of distinct elements of ''S'', namely <math>x,f(x),f(f(x)),...</math>. Conversely, given a sequence in ''S'' consisting of distinct elements <math>x_1, x_2, x_3, ...</math>, we can define a function ''f'' such that on elements in the sequence <math>f(x_i) = x_{i+1}</math> and ''f'' behaves like the identity function otherwise.  Thus Dedekind infinite sets contain subsets that correspond bijectively with the natural numbers. Dedekind finite naturally means that every injective self-map is also surjective.\n\n{{anchor|Kuratowski finite}} Kuratowski finiteness is defined as follows. Given any set ''S'', the binary operation of union endows the [[powerset]] ''P''(''S'') with the structure of a [[semilattice]].  Writing ''K''(''S'') for the sub-semilattice generated by the [[empty set]] and the singletons, call set ''S'' Kuratowski finite if ''S'' itself belongs to ''K''(''S'').<ref>The original paper by {{harvnb|Kuratowski|1920}} defined a set ''S'' to be finite when\n: ''P''(''S'')∖{∅} = ⋂{''X'' ∈ ''P''(''P''(''S'')∖{∅}); (∀''x''∈''S'', {''x''}∈''X'') and (∀''A'',''B''∈''X'', ''A''∪''B''∈''X'')}.\nIn other words, ''S'' is finite when the set of all non-empty subsets of ''S'' is equal to the intersection of all classes ''X'' which satisfy:\n* all elements of ''X'' are non-empty subsets of ''S'',\n* the set {''x''} is an element of ''X'' for all ''x'' in ''S'',\n* ''X'' is closed under pairwise unions.\nKuratowski showed that this is equivalent to the numerical definition of a finite set.</ref> Intuitively, ''K''(''S'') consists of the finite subsets of ''S''. Crucially, one does not need induction, recursion or a definition of natural numbers to define ''generated by'' since one may obtain ''K''(''S'') simply by taking the intersection of all sub-semilattices containing the empty set and the [[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]].\n\nReaders unfamiliar with semilattices and other notions of abstract algebra may prefer an entirely elementary formulation. Kuratowski finite means ''S'' lies in the set ''K''(''S''), constructed as follows. Write ''M'' for the set of all subsets ''X'' of ''P''(''S'') such that:\n* ''X'' contains the empty set;\n* For every set ''T'' in ''P''(''S''), if ''X'' contains ''T'' then ''X'' also contains the union of ''T'' with any singleton.\nThen ''K''(''S'') may be defined as the intersection of ''M''.\n\nIn ZF, Kuratowski finite implies Dedekind finite, but not vice versa. In the parlance of a popular pedagogical formulation, when the axiom of choice fails badly, one may have an infinite family of socks with no way to choose one sock from more than finitely many of the pairs. That would make the set of such socks Dedekind finite: there can be no infinite sequence of socks, because such a sequence would allow a choice of one sock for infinitely many pairs by choosing the first sock in the sequence. However, Kuratowski finiteness would fail for the same set of socks.\n\n=== Other concepts of finiteness ===\n\nIn ZF set theory without the axiom of choice, the following concepts of finiteness for a set ''S'' are distinct. They are arranged in strictly decreasing order of strength, i.e. if a set ''S'' meets a criterion in the list then it meets all of the following criteria. In the absence of the axiom of choice the reverse implications are all unprovable, but if the axiom of choice is assumed then all of these concepts are equivalent.<ref>This list of 8 finiteness concepts is presented with this numbering scheme by both {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|pp=278–280}}, and {{harvnb|Lévy|1958|pp=2–3}}, although the details of the presentation of the definitions differ in some respects which do not affect the meanings of the concepts.</ref> (Note that none of these definitions need the set of finite ordinal numbers to be defined first; they are all pure \"set-theoretic\" definitions in terms of the equality and membership relations, not involving ω.)\n\n* '''I-finite'''. Every non-empty set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element. (This is equivalent to requiring the existence of a ⊆-minimal element. It is also equivalent to the standard numerical concept of finiteness.)\n* '''Ia-finite'''. For every partition of ''S'' into two sets, at least one of the two sets is I-finite.\n* '''II-finite'''. Every non-empty ⊆-monotone set of subsets of ''S'' has a ⊆-maximal element.\n* '''III-finite'''. The power set ''P''(''S'') is Dedekind finite.\n* '''IV-finite'''. ''S'' is Dedekind finite.\n* '''V-finite'''.  ∣''S''∣ = 0 or 2⋅∣''S''∣ > ∣''S''|.\n* '''VI-finite'''. ∣''S''∣ = 0 or ∣''S''∣ = 1 or ∣''S''∣<sup>2</sup> > ∣''S''∣.\n* '''VII-finite'''. ''S'' is I-finite or not well-orderable.\n\nThe forward implications (from strong to weak) are theorems within ZF. Counter-examples to the reverse implications (from weak to strong) are found using [[model theory]].<ref>{{harvnb|Lévy|1958}} found counter-examples to each of the reverse implications in Mostowski models. Lévy attributes most of the results to earlier papers by Mostowski and Lindenbaum.</ref>\n\nMost of these finiteness definitions and their names are attributed to {{harvnb|Tarski|1954}} by {{harvnb|Howard|Rubin|1998|p=278}}. However, definitions I, II, III, IV and V were presented in {{harvnb|Tarski|1924|pp=49, 93}}, together with proofs (or references to proofs) for the forward implications. At that time, model theory was not sufficiently advanced to find the counter-examples.\n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[FinSet]]\n*[[Ordinal number]]\n*[[Peano arithmetic]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{ citation | first1 = Tom M. | last1 = Apostol | year = 1974 | lccn = 72011473 | title = Mathematical Analysis | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | location = Menlo Park }}\n* {{ citation | last1 = Cohn | first1 = Paul Moritz, F.R.S. | title = Universal Algebra | location = Dordrecht | publisher = [[D.

It was shown by [[Friedrich Hartogs]] in 1915, from [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]] alone (that is, without using the [[axiom of choice]]), that there is a least [[well-ordered]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] greater than a given well-ordered cardinal.\n\nTo define the Hartogs number of a set it is not necessary that the set be well-orderable: If ''X'' is any set, then the Hartogs number of ''X'' is the least [[ordinal number|ordinal]] α such that there is no [[Injective function|injection]] from α into ''X''. If ''X'' cannot be well-ordered, then we can no longer say that this α is the least well-ordered cardinal ''greater'' than the cardinality of ''X'', but it remains the least well-ordered cardinal ''not less than or equal to'' the cardinality of ''X''.  The [[map (mathematics)|map]] taking ''X'' to α is sometimes called '''Hartogs's function'''.\n\n==Proof==\nGiven some basic theorems of set theory, the proof is simple.  Let \n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\{\\beta \\in \\textrm{Ord} \\mid \\exists i: \\beta \\hookrightarrow X\\}</math>\n\nbe the [[Class (set theory)|class]] of all [[ordinal number]]s ''β'' for which an [[injective function]] exists from ''β''  into ''X''.\n\nFirst, we verify that ''α'' is a set.\n#''X'' &times; ''X'' is a set, as can be seen in [[axiom of power set#Consequences|axiom of power set]].\n# The [[power set]] of ''X'' &times; ''X'' is a set, by the [[axiom of power set]].\n# The class ''W'' of all [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] well-orderings of subsets of ''X'' is a definable subclass of the preceding set, so it is a set by the [[axiom schema of separation]].\n# The class of all [[order type]]s of well-orderings in ''W'' is a set by the [[axiom schema of replacement]], as\n#::([[Domain (mathematics)|Domain]](''w''), ''w'') <math>\\cong</math> (''β'', ≤)\n#:can be described by a simple formula.\n\nBut this last set is exactly ''α''.\n\nNow because a [[transitive set]] of ordinals is again an ordinal, ''α'' is an ordinal.  Furthermore, there is no injection from ''α'' into ''X'', because if there were, then we would get the contradiction that ''α'' ∈ ''α''.  And finally, ''α'' is the least such ordinal with no injection into ''X''.  This is true because, since ''α'' is an ordinal,  for any ''β'' < ''α'', ''β'' ∈ ''α'' so there is an injection from ''β'' into ''X''.\n\n==Historic remark==\n\nNote that, in 1915, Hartogs could use neither von Neumann-ordinals nor the Replacement Axiom,\nand so his result is one of Zermelo set theory and looks rather different from\nthe above modern exposition.\nInstead, he considered the set of isomorphism classes of well-ordered subsets of ''X''\nand the relation in which the class of ''A'' precedes that of ''B'' if ''A'' is isomorphic with\na proper initial segment of ''B''.\nHartogs showed this to be a well-ordering greater than any well-ordered subset of ''X''.\n(This must have been historically the first genuine construction of an uncountable well-ordering.)\nHowever, the main purpose of his contribution was to show that Trichotomy for cardinal numbers\nimplies the (then 11 year old) Well-ordering Theorem (and, hence, the Axiom of Choice).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Successor cardinal]]\n*[[Aleph number]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite journal\n  | last = Hartogs\n  | first = Fritz\n  | author-link = \n  | title = Über das Problem der Wohlordnung\n  | journal = [[Mathematische Annalen]]\n  | language = German\n  | volume = 76\n  | pages =438&ndash;443\n  | year = 1915\n  | url = http://www.digizeitschriften.de/dms/img/?PPN=GDZPPN002266105\n  | doi = 10.1007/BF01458215\n  | id = \n  | jfm = 45.0125.01\n  | issue = 4\n  \n}}\n* {{cite book|authorlink=Thomas Jech|author=Jech, Thomas|title=Set theory, third millennium edition (revised and expanded)|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=3-540-44085-2}}\n* {{cite web | title=Axiomatic set theory | work=Course Notes | author=Charles Morgan | publisher=University of Bristol | url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucahcjm/ast/ast_notes_4.pdf | accessdate =2010-04-10 }}\n\n[[Category:Set theory]]\n[[Category:Cardinal numbers]]"

      "text": "\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2011}}\n\nIn [[set theory]], an '''infinite set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is not a [[finite set]].  [[Infinity|Infinite]] sets may be [[countable set|countable]] or [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. Some examples are:\n* the set of all [[integer]]s, {..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}, is a countably infinite set; and\n* the set of all [[real number]]s is an uncountably infinite set.\n\n==Properties==\nThe set of [[natural numbers]] (whose existence is postulated by the [[axiom of infinity]]) is infinite. It is the only set that is directly required by the [[axiom]]s to be infinite. The existence of any other infinite set can be proved in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] (ZFC) only by showing that it follows from the existence of the natural numbers.\n\nA set is infinite if and only if for every natural number the set has a [[subset]] whose [[cardinality]] is that natural number.\n\nIf the [[axiom of choice]] holds, then a set is infinite if and only if it includes a countable infinite subset.\n\nIf a [[set of sets]] is infinite or contains an infinite element, then its union is infinite. The power set of an infinite set is infinite. Any [[subset|superset]] of an infinite set is infinite. If an infinite set is partitioned into finitely many subsets, then at least one of them must be infinite. Any set which can be mapped onto an infinite set is infinite. The [[Cartesian product]] of an infinite set and a nonempty set is infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite number of sets each containing at least two elements is either empty or infinite; if the axiom of choice holds, then it is infinite.\n\nIf an infinite set is a [[well-ordered set]], then it must have a nonempty subset that has no greatest element.\n\nIn ZF, a set is infinite if and only if the [[power set]] of its power set is a [[Dedekind-infinite set]], having a proper subset [[equinumerous]] to itself.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Boolos | first = George\n | contribution = The advantages of honest toil over theft\n | mr = 1373892\n | pages = 27–44\n | publisher = Oxford Univ.
