      "text": "{{for|the exponential map from a subset of the tangent space of a Riemannian manifold to the manifold|Exponential map (Riemannian geometry)}}\n{{Lie groups |Algebras}}\nIn the theory of [[Lie group]]s, the '''exponential map''' is a map from the [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of a Lie group <math>G</math> to the group, which allows one to recapture the local group structure from the Lie algebra. The existence of the exponential map is one of the primary reasons that Lie algebras are a useful tool for studying Lie groups.\n\nThe ordinary [[exponential function]] of mathematical analysis is a special case of the exponential map when <math>G</math> is the multiplicative group of [[positive real numbers]] (whose Lie algebra is the additive group of all real numbers). The exponential map of a Lie group satisfies many properties analogous to those of the ordinary exponential function, however, it also differs in many important respects.\n\n==Definitions==\n\nLet <math>G</math> be a [[Lie group]] and <math>\\mathfrak g</math> be its [[Lie algebra]] (thought of as the [[tangent space]] to the [[identity element]] of <math>G</math>). The '''exponential map''' is a map\n:<math>\\exp\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to G</math>\nwhich can be defined in several different ways. The typical modern definition is this:\n:'''Definition''': The exponential of <math>X\\in\\mathfrak g</math>  is given by <math>\\exp(X) = \\gamma(1)</math> where\n::<math>\\gamma\\colon \\mathbb R \\to G</math>\n:is the unique [[one-parameter subgroup]] of <math>G</math> whose [[tangent vector]] at the identity is equal to <math>X</math>. \nIt follows easily from the [[chain rule]] that <math>\\exp(tX) = \\gamma(t)</math>. The map <math>\\gamma</math> may be constructed as the [[integral curve]] of either the right- or left-invariant [[vector field]] associated with <math>X</math>. That the integral curve exists for all real parameters follows by right- or left-translating the solution near zero.\n\nWe have a more concrete definition in the case of a [[matrix Lie group]]. The exponential map coincides with the [[matrix exponential]] and is given by the ordinary series expansion:\n::<math>\\exp (X) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty\\frac{X^k}{k!} = I + X + \\frac{1}{2}X^2 + \\frac{1}{6}X^3 + \\cdots</math>,\nwhere <math>I</math> is the [[identity matrix]]. Thus, in the setting of matrix Lie groups, the exponential map is the restriction of the matrix exponential to the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> of <math>G</math>.\n\n===Comparison with Riemannian exponential map===\nIf ''G'' is compact, it has a Riemannian metric invariant under left ''and'' right translations, and the Lie-theoretic exponential map for ''G'' coincides with the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map of this Riemannian metric]]. \n\nFor a general ''G'', there will not exist a Riemannian metric invariant under both left and right translations. Although there is always a Riemannian metric invariant under, say, left translations, the exponential map in the sense of Riemannian geometry for a left-invariant metric will ''not'' in general agree with the exponential map in the Lie group sense. That is to say, if ''G'' is a Lie group equipped with a left- but not right-invariant metric, the geodesics through the identity will not be one-parameter subgroups of ''G'' {{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}.\n\n===Other definitions===\nOther equivalent definitions of the Lie-group exponential are as follows:\n*It is the exponential map of a canonical left-invariant [[affine connection]] on ''G'', such that [[parallel transport]] is given by left translation. That is, <math>\\exp(X) = \\gamma(1)</math> where <math>\\gamma</math> is the unique [[geodesic]] with the initial point at the identity element and the initial velocity ''X'' (thought of as a tangent vector).\n*It is the exponential map of a canonical right-invariant affine connection on ''G''. This is usually different from the canonical left-invariant connection, but both connections have the same geodesics (orbits of 1-parameter subgroups acting by left or right multiplication) so give the same exponential map.\n*The [[Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence]] also gives the definition: for ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, <math>t \\mapsto \\exp(tX)</math> is the unique Lie group homomorphism corresponding to the Lie algebra homomorphism <math>t \\mapsto tX.</math> (note: <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(\\mathbb{R}) = \\mathbb{R}</math>.) <!--cite also Bourbaki's definition. -->\n\n==Examples==\n\n* The [[unit circle]] centered at 0 in the [[complex plane]] is a Lie group (called the [[circle group]]) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the imaginary line in the complex plane, <math>\\{it:t\\in\\mathbb R\\}.</math> The exponential map for this Lie group is given by\n*: <math>it \\mapsto \\exp(it) = e^{it} = \\cos(t) + i\\sin(t),\\,</math>\n: that is, the same formula as the ordinary [[complex exponential]].\n* In the [[quaternions]] <math>\\mathbb H</math>, the set of [[versor|quaternions of unit length]] form a Lie group (isomorphic to the special unitary group {{math|''SU''(2)}}) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the space of purely imaginary quaternions, <math>\\{it+ju + kv :t, u, v\\in\\mathbb R\\}.</math> The exponential map for this Lie group is given by\n*: <math>\\mathbf{w} := (it+ju+kv) \\mapsto \\exp(it+ju+kv) = \\cos(|\\mathbf{w}|)1 + \\sin(|\\mathbf{w}|)\\frac{\\mathbf{w}}{|\\mathbf{w}|}.\\,</math>\n: This map takes the 2-sphere of radius {{mvar|R}} inside the purely imaginary [[quaternion]]s to <math>\\{s\\in S^3 \\subset \\mathbf{H}: \\operatorname{Re}(s) = \\cos(R)\\} </math>, a 2-sphere of radius <math>\\sin(R)</math> (cf. [[Pauli matrices#Exponential of a Pauli vector|Exponential of a Pauli vector]]). Compare this to the first example above.\n*Let ''V'' be a finite dimensional real vector space and view it as a Lie group under the operation of vector addition. Then <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(V) = V</math> via the identification of ''V'' with its tangent space at 0, and the exponential map\n::<math>\\operatorname{exp}: \\operatorname{Lie}(V) = V \\to V</math>\n:is the identity map, that is, <math>\\exp(v)=v</math>.\n* In the [[split-complex number]] plane <math>z = x + y \\jmath , \\quad \\jmath^2 = +1,</math> the imaginary line <math>\\lbrace \\jmath t : t \\in \\mathbb R \\rbrace</math> forms the Lie algebra of the [[unit hyperbola]] group <math>\\lbrace \\cosh t + \\jmath \\ \\sinh t : t \\in \\mathbb R \\rbrace</math> since the exponential map is given by\n*:<math>\\jmath t \\mapsto \\exp(\\jmath t) = \\cosh t + \\jmath \\ \\sinh t.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n===Elementary properties of the exponential===\nFor all <math>X\\in\\mathfrak g</math>, the map <math>\\gamma(t) = \\exp(tX)</math> is the unique [[one-parameter subgroup]] of <math>G</math> whose [[tangent vector]] at the identity is <math>X</math>. It follows that:\n*<math>\\exp((t+s)X) = \\exp (tX)\\exp (sX)\\,</math>\n*<math>\\exp(-X) =\\exp (X)^{-1}.\\,</math>\nMore generally:\n*<math>\\exp(X+Y)=\\exp(X)\\exp(Y),\\quad\\text{if }[X,Y]=0</math>.\nIt is important to emphasize that the preceding identity does not hold in general; the assumption that <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> commute is important.\n\nThe image of the exponential map always lies in the [[identity component]] of <math>G</math>.\n\n===The exponential near the identity===\nThe exponential map <math>\\exp\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to G</math> is a [[smooth map]]. Its [[pushforward (differential)|derivative]] at zero, <math>\\exp_{*}\\colon \\mathfrak g \\to \\mathfrak g</math>, is the identity map (with the usual identifications). \n\nIt follows from the inverse function theorem that the exponential map, therefore, restricts to a [[diffeomorphism]] from some neighborhood of 0 in <math>\\mathfrak g</math> to a neighborhood of 1 in <math>G</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.44</ref>\n\nIt is then not difficult to show that if ''G'' is connected, every element ''g'' of ''G'' is a ''product'' of exponentials of elements of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.47</ref>\n:<math>g=\\exp(X_1)\\exp(X_2)\\cdots\\exp(X_n),\\quad X_j\\in\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\nGlobally, the exponential map is not necessarily surjective. Furthermore, the exponential map may not be a local diffeomorphism at all points. For example, the exponential map from <math>\\mathfrak so</math>(3) to [[Rotation group SO(3)|SO(3)]] is not a local diffeomorphism; see also [[cut locus (Riemannian manifold)|cut locus]] on this failure. See [[Derivative of the exponential map|derivative of the exponential map]] for more information.\n\n===Surjectivity of the exponential===\nThe exponential map is surjective in the following cases: \n*''G'' is connected and compact,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 11.10</ref>\n*''G'' is connected and nilpotent, and \n*<math>G = GL_n(\\mathbb{C})</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Exercises 2.9 and 2.10</ref>\nFor groups not satisfying any of the above conditions, the exponential map may or may not be surjective.\n\nThe image of the exponential map of the connected but non-compact group ''SL''<sub>2</sub>('''R''') is not the whole group. Its image consists of '''C'''-diagonalizable matrices with eigenvalues either positive or with modulus 1, and of non-diagonalizable matrices with a repeated eigenvalue 1, and the matrix <math>-I</math>. (Thus, the image excludes matrices with real, negative eigenvalues, other than <math>-I</math>.)<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Exercise 3.22</ref>\n\n===Exponential map and homomorphisms===\nLet <math>\\phi\\colon G \\to H</math> be a Lie group homomorphism and let <math>\\phi_{*}</math> be its [[pushforward (differential)|derivative]] at the identity. Then the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 3.28</ref>\n[[Image:ExponentialMap-01.png|center]]\n\nIn particular, when applied to the [[adjoint representation of a Lie group|adjoint action]] of a Lie group <math>G</math>, since <math>\\operatorname{Ad}_* = \\operatorname{ad}</math>, we have the useful identity<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 3.35</ref>\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}_{\\exp X}(Y)=\\exp(\\mathrm{ad}_X)(Y)=Y+[X,Y]+\\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y]]+\\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y]]]+\\cdots</math>.\n\n== Logarithmic coordinates ==\nGiven a Lie group <math>G</math> with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, each choice of a basis <math>X_1, \\dots, X_n</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> determines a coordinate system near the identity element ''e'' for ''G'', as follows. By the [[inverse function theorem]], the exponential map <math>\\operatorname{exp} : N \\overset{\\sim}\\to U</math> is a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood <math>N \\subset \\mathfrak{g} \\simeq \\mathbb{R}^n</math> of the origin to a neighborhood <math>U</math> of <math>e \\in G</math>. Its inverse:\n:<math>\\log: U \\overset{\\sim}\\to N \\subset \\mathbb{R}^n</math>\nis then a coordinate system on ''U''. It is called by various names such as logarithmic coordinates, exponential coordinates or normal coordinates. See [[Closed-subgroup theorem#Overview]] for an example of how they are used in applications.\n\n'''Remark''': The open cover <math>\\{ U g | g \\in G \\}</math> gives a structure of a [[real-analytic manifold]] to ''G'' such that the group operation <math>(g, h) \\mapsto gh^{-1}</math> is real-analytic.<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi|Nomizu|loc=pg. 43.}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of exponential topics]]\n*[[Derivative of the exponential map]]\n*[[Matrix exponential]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n* {{springer|title=Exponential mapping|id=p/e036930}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Helgason | first1=Sigurdur | title=Differential geometry, Lie groups, and symmetric spaces | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-2848-9 | mr=1834454 | year=2001 | volume=34}}.\n* {{citation | last1=Kobayashi |first1=Shoshichi |last2=Nomizu |first2=Katsumi | title = [[Foundations of Differential Geometry]] |volume=Vol. 1 | publisher=Wiley-Interscience | year=1996 |edition=New |isbn=0-471-15733-3}}.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Exponential Map}}\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [[Pauli matrices]] for [[SU(2)]] to [[SU(3)]], which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [[quark model]]. Gell-Mann's generalization further [[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction|extends to general SU(''n'')]]. For their connection to the [[Root system|standard basis]] of Lie algebras, see  the [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for SU(3)#Standard basis|Weyl–Cartan  basis]].\n\n===Trace orthonormality===\n\nIn mathematics, orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity (1).  Gell-Mann matrices, however, are normalized to a value of 2.  Thus, the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the pairwise product results in the ortho-normalization condition\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{tr}(\\lambda_i \\lambda_j) = 2\\delta_{ij},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta_{ij}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nThis is so the embedded Pauli matrices corresponding to the  three embedded subalgebras of ''SU''(2) are conventionally normalized. In this three-dimensional matrix representation,  the [[Cartan subalgebra]] is the set of linear combinations (with real coefficients) of the two matrices <math>\\lambda_3</math> and <math>\\lambda_8</math>, which commute with each other.\n\nThere are three independent [[SU(2)]] subalgebras:\n\n*<math>\\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3\\}</math>\n*<math>\\{\\lambda_4, \\lambda_5, x\\},</math> and\n*<math>\\{\\lambda_6, \\lambda_7, y\\},</math>\nwhere the {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are linear combinations of <math>\\lambda_3</math> and <math>\\lambda_8</math>. The  SU(2) Casimirs of these subalgebras mutually commute.\n\nHowever, any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield SU(2) subalgebras. There is an uncountable number of such transformations.\n\n===Commutation relations===\n\nThe 8 infinitesimal generators of the [[Lie algebra]] are indexed by {{mvar|i}} satisfy the [[commutation relation]]s<ref name=\"gellmann17\">{{cite web |last1=Haber |first1=Howard |title=Properties of the Gell-Mann matrices |url=http://scipp.ucsc.edu/~haber/ph251/gellmann17.pdf |website=Physics 251 Group Theory and Modern Physics |publisher=U.C.

      "text": "{{orphan|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe [[Whitehead product]] is a mathematical construction introduced in {{harvtxt|Whitehead|1941}}. It has been a useful tool in determining the properties of spaces. The mathematical notion of space includes every shape that exists in our 3-dimensional world such as curves, surfaces, and solid figures. Since spaces are often presented by formulas, it is usually not possible to visually determine their geometric properties. Some of these properties are connectedness (is the space in one or several pieces), the number of holes the space has, the knottedness of the space, and so on.  Spaces are then studied by assigning algebraic constructions to them. This is similar to what is done in high school [[analytic geometry]] whereby to certain curves in the plane (geometric objects) are assigned equations (algebraic constructions). The most common algebraic constructions are [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. These are sets such that any two members of the set can be combined to yield a third member of the set (subject to certain restrictions). In [[homotopy theory]], one assigns a group to each space X and positive integer p called the pth [[homotopy group]] of X. These groups have been studied extensively and give information about the properties of the space X. There are then operations among these groups (the Whitehead product) which provide additional information about the spaces. This has been very important in the study of homotopy groups.\n\nSeveral generalisations of the Whitehead product appear in {{harv|Blakers|Massey|(1953)}} and elsewhere, but the most far-reaching one deals with homotopy sets, that is, homotopy classes of maps from one space to another. The generalised Whitehead product assigns to an element α in the homotopy set [ΣA, X] and an element β in the homotopy set [ΣB, X], an element [α, β] in the homotopy set [Σ(A ∧ B), X], where A, B, and X are spaces, Σ is the [[suspension (topology)]], and ∧ is the [[smash product]]. This was introduced by  {{harvtxt|Cohen|1957}} and {{harvtxt|Hilton|1965}} and later studied in detail by {{harvtxt|Arkowitz|1962}}, (see also {{harvtxt|Baues|1989}}, p.&nbsp;157). It is a generalization of the Whitehead product and \nprovides a useful technique in the investigation of homotopy sets.\n\nThe relevant [[Mathematics Subject Classification|MSC]] code is: 55Q15, Whitehead products and generalizations.\n\n==Definition==\nLet α ∈ [ΣA, X] and β ∈ [ΣB, X] and consider elements α(Σπ<sub>A</sub>) and β(Σπ<sub>B</sub>) ∈ [Σ(A × B), X], where π<sub>A</sub> and π<sub>B</sub> are the homotopy classes of the projection maps. The commutator c(α, β)=(α(Σπ<sub>A</sub>), β(Σπ<sub>B</sub>)) in the group [Σ(A × B), X] is trivial when restricted to [Σ(A ∨ B), X], where ∨ denotes [[wedge sum]]. The '''generalised Whitehead product''' is then defined as the unique element [α, β] ∈ [Σ(A ∧ B), X] such that [α, β](Σq) = c(α, β), where q : A × B → A ∧ B the quotient map.\n\n==Properties==\nNaturality: f<sub>∗</sub>[α, β] = [f<sub>∗</sub>(α), f<sub>∗</sub>(β)], if f : X → Y is a map.\n\nAll [α, β] = 0, if X is an [[H-space]].\n\nE[α, β] = 0, where E : [Σ(A ∧ B), X] → [Σ<sup>2</sup> (A ∧ B), ΣX] is the suspension homomorphism.\n\nBi-additivity, if A and B are suspensions.\n\nA form of anti-commutativity.\n\nAn appropriate Jacobi identity for α and β as above and γ ∈ [ΣC, X], if A,\nB, and C are suspensions.\n\nSee {{harvtxt|Arkowitz|1962}} for full statements of these results and proofs.\n\n==Applications==\nThe product ΣA × ΣB has the homotopy type of the [[mapping cone (topology)|mapping cone]] of [ι<sub>ΣA</sub>, ι<sub>ΣB</sub>] ∈ [Σ(A ∧ B), ΣA ∨ ΣB] ({{harvtxt|Arkowitz|1962}}).\n\nWhitehead products for homotopy groups with coefficients are obtained by\ntaking A and B to be Moore spaces ({{harvtxt|Hilton|1965}}, pp.&nbsp;110&ndash;114)\n\nThere is a weak homotopy equivalence between a wedge of suspensions of\nfinitely many spaces and an infinite product of suspensions of various smash products of the spaces according to the Milnor-Hilton theorem. The map is defined by generalised Whitehead products {{harv|Baues|Quintero|(2001)}}.\n\n==Related results==\nIf Y is a group-like H-space, then a product [A, Y] × [B, Y] → [A ∧ B, Y]\nis defined in analogy with the generalised Whitehead product. This is the generalized Samelson product denoted <σ, τ> for σ ∈ [A, Y] and τ ∈ [B, Y] {{harv|Arkowitz|1963}}. If λ<sub>U,V</sub> : [U, ΩV] → [ΣU, V] is the adjoint isomorphism, where Ω is the [[loop space]] functor, then λ<sub>A∧B,X</sub><σ, τ>= [λ<sub>A,X </sub>(σ), λ<sub>B,X </sub>(τ)] for Y = ΩX.\n\nAn [[Eckmann–Hilton duality|Eckmann–Hilton dual]] of the generalised Whitehead product can be defined as follows. Let A♭B be the homotopy fiber of the inclusion j : A ∨ B → A × B, that is, the space of paths in A × B which begin in A ∨ B and end at the base point and let γ ∈ [X, ΩA] and δ ∈ [X, ΩB]. For (Ωι<sub>A</sub>)γ and (Ωι<sub>B</sub>)δ in [X, Ω(A ∨ B)], let d(γ, δ) ∈ [X, Ω(A ∨ B)] be their commutator. Since (Ωj) d(γ, δ) is trivial, there is a unique element {γ, δ} ∈ [X, Ω(A♭B)] such that (Ωp){γ, δ} = d(γ, δ), where p : A♭B → A ∨ B projects a path onto its initial point. For an application of this, let K(π, n) denote an [[Eilenberg-MacLane space]] and identify [X, K(π, n)] with the cohomology group H<sup>n</sup>(X; π). If A = K(G, p) and B = K(G′, q), then there is a map θ : A♭B → K(G ⊗ G', p+q+1) such that (Ωθ){γ, δ} = γ ∪ δ, the cup product in H<sup>p+q</sup>(X; G ⊗ G′). For details, see ({{harv|Arkowitz|1962}}, pp.&nbsp;19&ndash;22) and {{harv|Arkowitz|1964}}.\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|first=M.|last=Arkowitz|authorlink=|title=The generalized Whitehead product|journal=[[Pacific J.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''generalized Kac–Moody algebra''' is a [[Lie algebra]] that is similar to a [[Kac–Moody algebra]], except that it is allowed to have imaginary [[Simple root (root system)|simple root]]s. \nGeneralized Kac–Moody algebras are also sometimes called '''GKM algebras''', '''Borcherds–Kac–Moody algebras''', '''BKM algebras''', or '''Borcherds algebras'''. The best known example is the [[monster Lie algebra]].\n\n== Motivation ==\nFinite-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s have the following properties:\n* They have a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form (,).\n* They have a grading such that the degree zero piece (the [[Cartan subalgebra]]) is abelian.\n* They have a (Cartan) [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''w''.\n* (''a'', ''w(a)'') is positive if ''a'' is nonzero.\n\nFor example, for the algebras of ''n'' by ''n'' matrices of trace zero, the bilinear form is (''a'', ''b'') = Trace(''ab''), the Cartan involution is given by minus the transpose, and the grading can be given by \"distance from the diagonal\" so that the Cartan subalgebra is the diagonal elements.\n\nConversely one can try to find all Lie algebras with these properties (and satisfying a few other technical conditions). The answer is that one gets sums of finite-dimensional and [[affine Lie algebra]]s.\n\nThe [[monster Lie algebra]] satisfies a slightly weaker version of the conditions above: \n(''a'', ''w(a)'') is positive if ''a'' is nonzero and has ''nonzero degree'', but may be negative when ''a'' has degree zero. The Lie algebras satisfying these weaker conditions are more or less generalized Kac–Moody algebras.\nThey are essentially the same as algebras given by certain generators and relations (described below).\n\nInformally, generalized Kac–Moody algebras are the Lie algebras that behave like finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras. In particular they have a [[Weyl group]], [[Weyl character formula]], [[Cartan subalgebra]], roots, weights, and so on.\n\n== Definition ==\nA symmetrized [[Cartan matrix]] is a (possibly infinite) square matrix with entries <math>c_{ij}</math> such that\n* <math>c_{ij}=c_{ji}\\ </math>\n* <math>c_{ij}\\le 0\\ </math> if <math>i\\ne j\\ </math>\n* <math>2c_{ij}/c_{ii}\\ </math> is an integer if <math>c_{ii}>0.\\ </math>\n\nThe universal generalized Kac–Moody algebra with given symmetrized Cartan matrix is defined by [[Generator matrix|generator]]s <math>e_i</math> and <math>f_i</math> and <math>h_i</math>  and relations \n* <math>[e_i,f_j] = h_i\\ </math> if <math>i =j</math>, 0 otherwise\n* <math>[h_i,e_j]= c_{ij}e_j\\ </math>, <math>[h_i,f_j]=-c_{ij}f_j\\ </math>\n* <math>[e_i,[e_i,\\ldots,[e_i,e_j]]]= [f_i,[f_i,\\ldots,[f_i,f_j]]] = 0\\ </math> for <math>1-2c_{ij}/c_{ii}\\ </math> applications of <math>e_i\\ </math> or <math>f_i\\ </math> if <math>c_{ii}>0\\ </math>\n* <math>[e_i,e_j] = [f_i,f_j] = 0 \\    </math> if <math> c_{ij} = 0.\\ </math>\n\nThese differ from the relations of a (symmetrizable) [[Kac–Moody algebra]] mainly by allowing the diagonal entries of the Cartan matrix to be non-positive. \nIn other words, we allow simple roots to be imaginary, whereas in a Kac–Moody algebra simple roots are always real.\n\nA generalized Kac–Moody algebra is obtained from a universal one by changing the Cartan matrix, by the operations of killing something in the center, or taking a [[Group extension#Central extension|central extension]], or adding [[outer derivation]]s.\n\nSome authors give a more general definition by removing the condition that the Cartan matrix should be symmetric. Not much is known about these non-symmetrizable generalized Kac–Moody algebras, and there seem to be no interesting examples.\n\nIt is also possible to extend the definition to superalgebras.\n\n== Structure ==\nA generalized Kac–Moody algebra can be graded by giving ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> degree 1, ''f''<sub>''i''</sub> degree -1, and ''h''<sub>''i''</sub> degree 0.\n\nThe degree zero piece is an abelian subalgebra spanned by the elements ''h<sub>i</sub>'' and is called the '''Cartan subalgebra'''.\n<!-- todo: roots, weights, weyl vector/group/character formula-->\n\n== Properties ==\nMost properties of generalized Kac–Moody algebras are straightforward extensions of the usual properties of (symmetrizable) Kac–Moody algebras.\n\n* A generalized Kac–Moody algebra has an invariant [[symmetric bilinear form]] such that <math>(e_i,f_i)=1</math>.\n* There is a [[Weyl character formula|character formula]] for [[highest weight module]]s, similar to the [[Weyl–Kac character formula]] for [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s except that it has correction terms for the imaginary simple roots.\n\n==Examples==\nMost generalized Kac–Moody algebras are thought not to have distinguishing features. The interesting ones are of three types:\n* Finite-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s.\n* [[Affine Kac–Moody algebra]]s\n* Algebras with [[Lorentzian algebra|Lorentzian Cartan subalgebra]] whose denominator function is an [[automorphic form]] of singular weight.\n\nThere appear to be only a finite number of examples of the third type.\nTwo examples are the [[monster Lie algebra]], acted on by the [[monster group]] and used in the [[monstrous moonshine]] conjectures, and the [[fake monster Lie algebra]]. There are similar examples associated to some of the other [[sporadic simple group]]s.\n\nIt is possible to find many examples of generalized Kac–Moody algebras using the following principle: anything that looks like a generalized Kac–Moody algebra is a generalized Kac–Moody algebra. More precisely, if a Lie algebra is graded by a Lorentzian lattice and has an invariant bilinear form and satisfies a few other easily checked technical conditions, then it is a generalized Kac–Moody algebra. \nIn particular one can use vertex algebras to construct a Lie algebra from any [[even lattice]].\nIf the lattice is positive definite it gives a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra, if it is positive semidefinite it gives an affine Lie algebra, and if it is Lorentzian it gives an algebra satisfying the conditions above that is therefore a generalized Kac–Moody algebra. When the lattice is the even 26 dimensional unimodular Lorentzian lattice the construction gives the fake monster Lie algebra; all other Lorentzian lattices seem to give uninteresting algebras.\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book |title=Infinite dimensional Lie algebras |authorlink=Victor Kac | last=Kac |first=Victor G. |coauthors= |year=1994 |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-521-46693-8 |pages= |url= }}\n*{{cite book |title=Infinite dimensional Lie algebras |last=Wakimoto |first=Minoru |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=American Mathematical Society |location=Providence, Rhode Island |isbn=0-8218-2654-9 |pages= |url= }}\n*{{cite book |title=Automorphic Forms and Lie Superalgebras |last=Ray |first=Urmie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=1-4020-5009-7 |pages= |url= }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Generalized Kac-Moody algebra}}\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''graded Lie algebra''' is a [[Lie algebra]] endowed with a [[graded vector space|gradation]] which is compatible with the [[Commutator|Lie bracket]].  In other words, a graded Lie algebra is a Lie algebra which is also a nonassociative graded algebra under the bracket operation.  A choice of [[Cartan decomposition]] endows any [[semisimple Lie algebra]] with the structure of a graded Lie algebra.  Any [[parabolic Lie algebra]] is also a graded Lie algebra.\n\nA '''graded Lie superalgebra'''<ref>The \"super\" prefix for this is not entirely standard, and some authors may opt to omit it entirely in favor of calling a graded Lie superalgebra just a ''graded Lie algebra''.  This dodge is not entirely without warrant, since graded Lie superalgebras may have nothing to do with the algebras of [[supersymmetry]].  They are only super insofar as they carry a '''Z'''/2'''Z''' gradation.  This gradation occurs naturally, and not because of any underlying superspaces.  Thus in the sense of [[category theory]], they are properly regarded as ordinary non-super objects.</ref>  extends the notion of a graded Lie algebra in such a way that the Lie bracket is no longer assumed to be necessarily [[anticommutative]].  These arise in the study of [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]s on [[graded algebra]]s, in the [[deformation theory]] of [[Murray Gerstenhaber|M. Gerstenhaber]], [[Kunihiko Kodaira]], and [[D. C. Spencer]], and in the theory of [[Lie derivative]]s.\n\nA '''supergraded Lie superalgebra'''<ref>In connection with [[supersymmetry]], these are often called just ''graded Lie superalgebras'', but this conflicts with the previous definition in this article.</ref> is a further generalization of this notion to the category of [[superalgebra]]s in which a graded Lie superalgebra is endowed with an additional super '''Z'''/2'''Z'''-gradation.  These arise when one forms a graded Lie superalgebra in a classical (non-supersymmetric) setting, and then tensorizes to obtain the [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] analog.<ref>Thus supergraded Lie superalgebras carry a ''pair'' of '''Z'''/2'''Z'''-gradations: one of which is supersymmetric, and the other is classical.  [[Pierre Deligne]] calls the supersymmetric one the ''super gradation'', and the classical one the ''cohomological gradation''.  These two gradations must be compatible, and there is often disagreement as to how they should be regarded.  See [http://www.math.ias.edu/QFT/fall/bern-appen1.ps Deligne's discussion] of this difficulty.</ref>\n\nStill greater generalizations are possible to Lie algebras over a class of [[braided monoidal category|braided monoidal categories]] equipped with a [[coproduct]] and some notion of a gradation compatible with the braiding in the category.  For hints in this direction, see [[Lie algebra#Category theoretic definition]].\n\n== Graded Lie algebras ==\nIn its most basic form, a graded Lie algebra is an ordinary Lie algebra <math>{\\mathfrak g}</math>, together with a gradation of vector spaces:\n:<math>{\\mathfrak g}=\\bigoplus_{i\\in{\\mathbb Z}} {\\mathfrak g}_i</math>  (1)\nsuch that the Lie bracket respects this gradation:\n:<math>[{\\mathfrak g}_i,{\\mathfrak g}_j]\\subseteq {\\mathfrak g}_{i+j}.</math>  (2)\nThe [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a graded Lie algebra inherits the grading.\n\n=== Examples ===\n\n==== sl(2) ====\nFor example, the Lie algebra sl(2) of [[trace-free]] 2×2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] is graded by the generators:\n:<math>\nX=\\left(\\begin{matrix}0&1\\\\0&0\\end{matrix}\\right),\\quad Y=\\left(\\begin{matrix}0&0\\\\1&0\\end{matrix}\\right),\n</math> and\n:<math>\nH=\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{matrix}\\right).\n</math>\nThese satisfy the relations {{nowrap|1=[''X'',''Y''] = ''H''}}, {{nowrap|1=[''H'',''X''] = 2''X''}}, {{nowrap|1=[''H'',''Y''] = −2''Y''}}.  Hence with {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>−1</sub> = span(''X'')}}, {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>0</sub> = span(''H'')}}, and {{nowrap|1=''g''<sub>1</sub> = span(''Y'')}},\nthe decomposition {{nowrap|1=sl(2) = ''g''<sub>−1</sub> + ''g''<sub>0</sub> + ''g''<sub>1</sub>}} presents sl(2) as a graded Lie algebra.\n\n==== Free Lie algebra ====\n{{main|Free Lie algebra}}\nThe [[free Lie algebra]] on a set ''X'' naturally has a grading, given by the minimum number of terms needed to generate the group element. This arises for example as the associated graded Lie algebra to the [[lower central series]] of a [[free group]].\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nIf Γ is any [[commutative monoid]], then the notion of a '''Γ-graded Lie algebra''' generalizes that of an ordinary ('''Z'''-) graded Lie algebra so that the defining relations (1) and (2) hold with the integers '''Z''' replaced by Γ.  In particular, any semisimple Lie algebra is graded by the root spaces of its [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].\n\n== Graded Lie superalgebras ==\nA '''graded Lie superalgebra''' over a field ''k'' (not of [[characteristic of a field|characteristic]] 2) consists of a [[graded vector space]] ''E'' over ''k'', along with a [[bilinear form|bilinear]] '''bracket''' operation\n::<math>[-,-] : E\\otimes_k E\\rightarrow E</math>\nsuch that the following axioms are satisfied.\n:*[-,-] respects the gradation of ''E'':\n::<math>[E_i,E_j]\\subseteq E_{i+j}</math>.\n:*(''Symmetry'') If ''x'' ∈ ''E''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''y'' ∈ ''E''<sub>''j''</sub>, then\n::<math>[x,y]=-(-1)^{ij}\\,[y,x]</math>\n:*(''Jacobi identity'')  If ''x'' ∈ ''E''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''y'' ∈ ''E''<sub>''j''</sub>, and ''z'' ∈ ''E''<sub>''k''</sub>, then\n::<math>(-1)^{ik}[x,[y,z]]+(-1)^{ij}[y,[z,x]]+(-1)^{jk}[z,[x,y]]=0</math>.\n::(If ''k'' has characteristic 3, then the Jacobi identity must be supplemented with the condition <math>[x,[x,x]] = 0</math> for all ''x'' in ''E''<sub>odd</sub>.)\n\nNote, for instance, that when ''E'' carries the trivial gradation, a graded Lie superalgebra over ''k'' is just an ordinary Lie algebra.  When the gradation of ''E'' is concentrated in even degrees, one recovers the definition of a ('''Z'''-)graded Lie algebra.\n\n=== Examples and Applications ===\nThe most basic example of a graded Lie superalgebra occurs in the study of derivations of graded algebras.  If ''A'' is a [[graded algebra|graded ''k''-algebra]] with gradation\n:<math>A=\\bigoplus_{i\\in{\\mathbb Z}} A_i</math>,\nthen a graded ''k''-derivation ''d'' on ''A'' of degree ''l'' is defined by\n#''dx'' = 0  for ''x'' ∈ ''k'',\n#''d'' : ''A''<sub>i</sub> → ''A''<sub>''i''+''l''</sub>, and\n#''d''(''xy'') = (''dx'')''y'' + (−1)<sup>''il''</sup>''x''(''dy'') for ''x'' ∈ ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>.\nThe space of all graded derivations of degree ''l'' is denoted by Der<sub>''l''</sub>(''A''), and the direct sum of these spaces\n:<math>\\hbox{Der}(A)=\\bigoplus_l \\hbox{Der}_l(A)</math>\ncarries the structure of an ''A''-module.  This generalizes the notion of a derivation of commutative algebras to the graded category.\n\nOn Der(''A''), one can define a bracket via:\n:[''d'', ''δ''] = ''dδ'' − (−1)<sup>''ij''</sup>''δd'', for ''d'' ∈ Der<sub>''i''</sub>(''A'') and ''δ'' ∈ Der<sub>''j''</sub>(''A'').\nEquipped with this structure, Der(''A'') inherits the structure of a graded Lie superalgebra over ''k''.\n\n'''Further examples:'''\n* The [[Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket]] is an example of a graded Lie algebra arising naturally in the study of [[connection (mathematics)|connections]] in [[differential geometry]].\n* The [[Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket]] arises in connection with the deformations of Lie algebras.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe notion of a graded Lie superalgebra can be generalized so that their grading is not just the integers.  Specifically, a '''signed semiring''' consists of a pair {{nowrap|(Γ, ''ε'')}} where Γ is a [[semiring]] and {{nowrap|''ε'' : Γ → '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}} is a [[homomorphism]] of additive groups.  Then a graded Lie supalgebra over a signed semiring consists of a vector space ''E'' graded with respect to the additive structure on Γ, and a bilinear bracket [-,-] which respects the grading on ''E'' and in addition satisfies:\n# <math>[x,y] = - (-1)^{\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ x)\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ y)}[y,x]</math> for all [[homogeneous element]]s ''x'' and ''y'', and\n# <math>(-1)^{\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ x)\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ z)}[x,[y,z]] + (-1)^{\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ y)\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ x)}[y,[z,x]] + (-1)^{\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ z)\\epsilon(\\hbox{deg}\\ y)}[z,[x,y]]=0.</math>\n\n'''Further examples:'''\n*A [[Lie superalgebra]] is a graded Lie superalgebra over the signed semiring {{nowrap|('''Z'''/2'''Z''', ''ε'')}}, where ''ε'' is the identity endomorphism for the additive structure on the ring '''Z'''/2'''Z'''.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* Nijenhuis, A., and Richardson, R.

      "text": "{{distinguish|Lie group}}\n{{group theory sidebar|Finite}}\nIn [[mathematics]], specifically in [[group theory]], the phrase '''group of Lie type''' usually refers to [[finite groups]] that are closely related to the group of [[rational point]]s of a [[Reductive group|reductive]] [[linear algebraic group]] with values in a [[finite field]]. The phrase \"group of Lie type\" does not have a widely accepted precise definition,<ref>[http://mathoverflow.net/questions/136880/definition-of-finite-group-of-lie-type mathoverflow - Definition of “finite group of Lie type”?]</ref> but the important collection of finite [[Simple group|simple]] groups of Lie type does have a precise definition, and they make up most of the groups in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\nThe name \"groups of Lie type\" is due to the close relationship with the (infinite) [[Lie groups]], since a [[compact Lie group]] may be viewed as the rational points of a reductive linear algebraic group over the field of [[real numbers]]. {{harvtxt|Dieudonné|1971}} and {{harvtxt|Carter|1989}} are standard references for groups of Lie type.\n\n==Classical groups==\n{{Main|Classical group}}\n\nAn initial approach to this question was the definition and detailed study of the so-called '''classical groups''' over finite and other [[field (mathematics)|fields]] by {{harvtxt|Jordan|1870}}. These groups were studied by [[L. E. Dickson]] and  [[Jean Dieudonné]]. [[Emil Artin]] investigated the orders of such groups, with a view to classifying cases of coincidence.\n\nA classical group is, roughly speaking, a [[special linear group|special linear]],  [[orthogonal group|orthogonal]], [[symplectic group|symplectic]], or [[unitary group]]. There are several minor variations of these, given by taking [[derived subgroup]]s or [[center of a group|central]] [[quotient group|quotient]]s, the latter yielding [[projective linear group]]s. They can be constructed over finite fields (or any other field) in much the same way that they are constructed over the real numbers.  They correspond to the series A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub>,<sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>, <sup>2</sup>D<sub>''n''</sub> of Chevalley and Steinberg groups.\n\n==Chevalley groups==\nChevalley groups can be thought of as Lie groups over finite fields. The theory was clarified by the theory of [[algebraic group]]s, and the work of {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Claude Chevalley|last=Chevalley|year=1955}} on Lie algebras, by means of which the ''Chevalley group'' concept was isolated. Chevalley constructed a [[Chevalley basis]] (a sort of integral form but over finite fields) for all the complex [[simple Lie algebra]]s (or rather of their [[universal enveloping algebra]]s), which can be used to define the corresponding algebraic groups over the integers. In particular, he could take their points with values in any finite field. For the Lie algebras A<sub>''n''</sub>, B<sub>''n''</sub>, C<sub>''n''</sub>, D<sub>''n''</sub> this gave well known classical groups, but his construction also gave groups associated to the exceptional Lie algebras E<sub>6</sub>, E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, and G<sub>2</sub>. The ones of type G<sub>2</sub> (sometimes called '''Dickson groups''') had already been constructed by {{harvtxt|Dickson|1905}}, and the ones of type E<sub>6</sub> by {{harvtxt|Dickson|1901}}.\n\n==Steinberg groups==\n{{main|³D₄}}\n{{main|²E₆}}\nChevalley's construction did not give all of the known classical groups: it omitted the unitary groups and the non-[[split orthogonal group]]s. {{harvtxt|Steinberg|1959}} found a modification of Chevalley's construction that gave these groups and  two new families <sup>3</sup>D<sub>4</sub>, <sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>, the second of which was discovered at about the same time from a different point of view  by {{harvtxt|Tits|1958}}. This construction generalizes the usual construction of the unitary group from the general linear group.\n\nThe unitary group arises as follows: the general linear group over the [[complex number]]s has a ''diagram automorphism'' given by reversing the [[Dynkin diagram]] A<sub>''n''</sub> (which corresponds to taking the transpose inverse), and a ''[[field automorphism]]'' given by taking [[complex conjugation]], which commute. The unitary group is the group of fixed points of the product of these two automorphisms.\n\nIn the same way, many Chevalley groups have diagram automorphisms induced by [[Dynkin diagram#Automorphisms|automorphisms of their Dynkin diagrams]], and field automorphisms induced by automorphisms of a finite field. Analogously to the unitary case, Steinberg constructed families of groups by taking fixed points of a product of a diagram and a field automorphism.\n\nThese gave:\n* the '''unitary groups''' <sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>, from the order 2 automorphism of A<sub>''n''</sub>;\n* further '''orthogonal groups''' <sup>2</sup>D<sub>''n''</sub>, from the order 2 automorphism of D<sub>''n''</sub>;\n* the new series [[²E₆|<sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>]], from the order 2 automorphism of E<sub>6</sub>;\n* the new series [[³D₄|<sup>3</sup>D<sub>4</sub>]], from the order 3 automorphism of D<sub>4</sub>.\nThe groups of type <sup>3</sup>D<sub>4</sub> have no analogue over the reals, as the complex numbers have no automorphism of order&nbsp;3.{{clarify|date=February 2014}} The symmetries of the D<sub>4</sub> diagram also give rise to [[triality]].\n\n==Suzuki–Ree groups==\n{{main|Suzuki groups|Ree group}}\n{{harvs|txt|authorlink=Michio Suzuki|last=Suzuki|year=1960}} found a new infinite series of groups that at first sight seemed unrelated to the known algebraic groups. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Rimhak Ree|last=Ree|year1=1960|year2=1961}} knew that the algebraic group B<sub>2</sub> had an \"extra\" automorphism in characteristic 2 whose square was the [[Frobenius automorphism]]. He found that if a finite field of characteristic 2 also has an automorphism whose square was the Frobenius map, then an analogue of Steinberg's construction gave the Suzuki groups. The fields with such an automorphism are those of order 2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>, and the corresponding groups are the Suzuki groups\n\n:<sup>2</sup>B<sub>2</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>) = Suz(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>).\n\n(Strictly speaking, the group Suz(2) is not counted as a Suzuki group as it is not simple: it is the [[Frobenius group]] of order 20.) Ree was able to find two new similar families\n\n:<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2<sup>2''n''+1</sup>)\n\nand\n\n:<sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>)\n\nof simple groups by using the fact that F<sub>4</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> have extra automorphisms in characteristic 2 and&nbsp;3. (Roughly speaking, in characteristic ''p'' one is allowed to ignore the arrow on bonds of multiplicity ''p'' in the Dynkin diagram when taking diagram automorphisms.) The smallest group <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2) of type <sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub> is not simple, but it has a simple subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2, called the '''[[Tits group]]''' (named after the mathematician [[Jacques Tits]]). The smallest group <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3) of type <sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub> is not simple, but it has a simple normal subgroup of index 3, isomorphic to A<sub>1</sub>(8). In the [[classification of finite simple groups]], the Ree groups\n\n:<sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3<sup>2''n''+1</sup>)\n\nare the ones whose structure is hardest to pin down explicitly. These groups also played a role in the discovery of the first modern sporadic group. They have involution centralizers of the form '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × PSL(2, ''q'') for ''q'' = 3<sup>''n''</sup>, and by investigating groups with an involution centralizer of the similar form '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × PSL(2, 5) Janko found the sporadic group&nbsp;[[Janko group|''J''<sub>1</sub>]].\n\nThe Suzuki groups are the only finite non-abelian simple groups with order not divisible by 3. They have order 2<sup>2(2''n''+1)</sup>(2<sup>2(2''n''+1)</sup> + 1)(2<sup>(2''n''+1)</sup> − 1).\n\n==Relations with finite simple groups==\nFinite groups of Lie type were among the first groups to be considered in mathematics, after [[cyclic group|cyclic]], [[symmetric group|symmetric]] and [[alternating group|alternating]] groups, with the [[projective special linear group]]s over prime finite fields, PSL(2, ''p'') being constructed by [[Évariste Galois]] in the 1830s. The systematic exploration of finite groups of Lie type started with [[Camille Jordan]]'s theorem that the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2, ''q'') is simple for ''q'' ≠ 2, 3. This theorem generalizes to projective groups of higher dimensions and gives an important infinite family PSL(''n'', ''q'') of [[finite simple groups]]. Other classical groups were studied by [[Leonard Dickson]] in the beginning of 20th century. In the 1950s [[Claude Chevalley]] realized that after an appropriate reformulation, many theorems about [[semisimple Lie group]]s admit analogues for algebraic groups over an arbitrary field ''k'', leading to construction of what are now called ''Chevalley groups''. Moreover, as in the case of compact simple Lie groups, the corresponding groups turned out to be almost simple as abstract groups (''Tits simplicity theorem''). Although it was known since 19th century that other finite simple groups exist (for example, [[Mathieu groups]]), gradually a belief formed that nearly all finite simple groups can be accounted for by appropriate extensions of Chevalley's construction, together with cyclic and alternating groups. Moreover, the exceptions, the [[sporadic groups]], share many properties with the finite groups of Lie type, and in particular, can be constructed and characterized based on their [[Building (mathematics)|''geometry'']] in the sense of Tits.\n\nThe belief has now become a theorem – the [[classification of finite simple groups]]. Inspection of the list of finite simple groups shows that groups of Lie type over a [[finite field]] include all the finite simple groups other than the cyclic groups, the alternating groups, the [[Tits group]], and the 26 [[sporadic simple group]]s.\n\n==Small groups of Lie type==\nIn general the finite group associated to an endomorphism of a simply connected simple algebraic group is the universal central extension of a simple group, so is [[Perfect group|perfect]] and has trivial [[Schur multiplier]]. However some of the smallest groups in the families above are either not perfect or have a Schur multiplier larger than \"expected\".\n\nCases where the group is not perfect include\n*A<sub>1</sub>(2) = SL(2, 2) Solvable of order 6 (the symmetric group on 3 points)\n*A<sub>1</sub>(3) = SL(2, 3) Solvable of order 24 (a double cover of the alternating group on 4 points)\n*<sup>2</sup>A<sub>2</sub>(4) Solvable\n*B<sub>2</sub>(2) Not perfect, but is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 6 points so its derived subgroup has index 2 and is simple of order 360.\n*<sup>2</sup>B<sub>2</sub>(2) = Suz(2) Solvable of order 20 (a Frobenius group)\n*<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2) Not perfect, but the derived group has index 2 and is the simple [[Tits group]].\n*G<sub>2</sub>(2) Not perfect, but the derived group has index 2 and is simple of order 6048.\n*<sup>2</sup>G<sub>2</sub>(3) Not perfect, but the derived group has index 3 and is the simple group of order 504.\n\nSome cases where the group is perfect but has a Schur multiplier that is larger than expected include:\n*A<sub>1</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*A<sub>1</sub>(9) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/3'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 6 instead of 2.\n*A<sub>2</sub>(2) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*A<sub>2</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/4'''Z''' × '''Z'''/4'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 48 instead of 3.\n*A<sub>3</sub>(2) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*B<sub>3</sub>(2) = C<sub>3</sub>(2) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*B<sub>3</sub>(3) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/3'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 6 instead of 2.\n*D<sub>4</sub>(2) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 4 instead of 1.\n*F<sub>4</sub>(2) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*G<sub>2</sub>(3) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/3'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 3 instead of 1.\n*G<sub>2</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*<sup>2</sup>A<sub>3</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 2 instead of 1.\n*<sup>2</sup>A<sub>3</sub>(9) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/3'''Z''' × '''Z'''/3'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 36 instead of 4.\n*<sup>2</sup>A<sub>5</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 12 instead of 3.\n*<sup>2</sup>E<sub>6</sub>(4) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 12 instead of 3.\n*<sup>2</sup>B<sub>2</sub>(8) The Schur multiplier has an extra '''Z'''/2'''Z''' × '''Z'''/2'''Z''', so the Schur multiplier of the simple group has order 4 instead of 1.\n\nThere is a bewildering number of \"accidental\" isomorphisms between various small groups of Lie type (and alternating groups). For example, the groups SL(2, 4), PSL(2, 5), and the alternating group on 5 points are all isomorphic.\n\nFor a complete list of these exceptions see the [[list of finite simple groups]]. Many of these special properties are related to certain sporadic simple groups.\n\nAlternating groups sometimes behave as if they were groups of Lie type over the [[field with one element]]. Some of the small alternating groups also have exceptional properties. The alternating groups usually have an [[outer automorphism group]] of order 2, but the alternating group on 6 points has an [[Automorphisms of the symmetric and alternating groups|outer automorphism group of order 4]]. Alternating groups usually have a Schur multiplier of order 2, but the ones on 6 or 7 points have a [[Alternating group#H2: Schur multipliers|Schur multiplier of order 6]].\n\n==Notation issues==\nUnfortunately there is no standard notation for the finite groups of Lie type, and the literature contains dozens of incompatible and confusing systems of notation for them.\n\n* The simple group PSL(''n'', ''q'') is not usually the same as the group PSL(''n'', '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>) of '''F'''<sub>''q''</sub>-valued points of the algebraic group PSL(''n''). The problem is that a surjective map of algebraic groups such as SL(''n'') → PSL(''n'') does not necessarily induce a surjective map of the corresponding groups with values in some (non algebraically closed) field. There are similar problems with the points of other algebraic groups with values in finite fields.\n* The groups of type A<sub>''n''−1</sub> are sometimes denoted by PSL(''n'', ''q'') (the projective special linear group) or by ''L''(''n'', ''q'').\n* The groups of type C<sub>''n''</sub> are sometimes denoted by Sp(2''n'', ''q'') (the symplectic group) or (confusingly) by Sp(''n'', ''q'').\n* The notation for groups of type D<sub>''n''</sub> (\"orthogonal\" groups) is particularly confusing. Some symbols used are O(''n'', ''q''), ''O''<sup>&minus;</sup>(''n'', ''q''), PSO(''n'', ''q''), Ω<sub>''n''</sub>(''q''), but there are so many conventions that it is not possible to say exactly what groups these correspond to without it being specified explicitly. The source of the problem is that the simple group is not the orthogonal group O, nor the [[projective special orthogonal group]] PSO, but rather a subgroup of PSO,<ref name=\"atlasxi\">[[ATLAS of Finite Groups|ATLAS]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=38fEMl2-Fp8C&dq=%22projective%20special%20orthogonal%20group%22&pg=PR11 p. xi]</ref> which accordingly does not have a classical notation. A particularly nasty trap is that some authors, such as the [[ATLAS of Finite Groups|ATLAS]], use O(''n'', ''q'') for a group that is '''not''' the orthogonal group, but the corresponding simple group. The notation Ω, PΩ was introduced by [[Jean Dieudonné]], though his definition is not simple for ''n'' ≤  4 and thus the same notation may be used for a slightly different group, which agrees in ''n'' ≥ 5 but not in lower dimension.<ref name=\"atlasxi\" />\n* For the Steinberg groups, some authors write <sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>) (and so on) for the group that other authors denote by <sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q''). The problem is that there are two fields involved, one of order ''q''<sup>2</sup>, and its fixed field of order ''q'', and people have different ideas on which should be included in the notation. The \"<sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q''<sup>2</sup>)\" convention is more logical and consistent, but the \"<sup>2</sup>A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q'')\" convention is far more common and is closer to the convention for [[algebraic group]]s.\n* Authors differ on whether groups such as A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q'') are the groups of points with values in the simple or the simply connected algebraic group. For example, A<sub>''n''</sub>(''q'') may mean either the special linear group SL(''n''+1, ''q'') or the projective special linear group PSL(''n''+1, ''q''). So <sup>2</sup>A<sub>2</sub>(4) may be any one of 4 different groups, depending on the author.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Deligne–Lusztig theory]]\n*[[Modular Lie algebra]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Carter | first1=Roger W. | author1-link=Roger Carter (mathematician) | title=Simple groups of Lie type | origyear=1972 | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | series=Wiley Classics Library | isbn=978-0-471-50683-6 | mr=0407163 | year=1989}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Chevalley | first1=Claude | title=Sur certains groupes simples | doi=10.2748/tmj/1178245104 | mr=0073602 | year=1955 | journal=The Tohoku Mathematical Journal.

      "text": "{{unreferenced|date=November 2018}}\nIn [[mathematics]], in particular [[abstract algebra]] and [[topology]], a '''homotopy Lie algebra''' (or '''<math>L_\\infty</math>-algebra''') is a generalisation of the concept of a [[differential graded Lie algebra]]. To be a little more specific, the [[Jacobi identity]] only holds up to homotopy. Therefore, a differential graded Lie algebra can be seen as a homotopy Lie algebra where the Jacobi identity holds on the nose.\n\nHomotopy Lie algebras have applications within mathematics and [[mathematical physics]]; they are linked, for instance, to the [[Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism]] much like differential graded Lie algebras are.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThere exists several different definitions of a homotopy Lie algebra, some particularly suited to certain situations more than others. The most traditional definition is via symmetric multi-linear maps, but there also exists a more succinct geometric definition using the language of [[formal geometry]]. Here the blanket assumption that the underlying field is of characteristic zero is made.\n\n===Geometric definition===\n\nA '''homotopy Lie algebra''' on a [[graded vector space]] <math>V = \\bigoplus V_i </math> is a continuous derivation of order <math> >1 </math> that squares to zero <math>m</math> on the formal manifold <math>\\hat{S}\\Sigma V^*</math>. Here <math>\\hat{S}</math> is the completed symmetric algebra, <math>\\Sigma</math> is the suspension of a graded vector space, and <math>V^*</math> denotes the linear dual. Typically one describes <math>(V,m)</math> as the homotopy Lie algebra and <math>\\hat{S}\\Sigma V^*</math> with the differential <math>m</math> as its representing commutative differential graded algebra.\n\nUsing this definition of a homotopy Lie algebra, one defines a morphism of homotopy Lie algebras <math>f\\colon(V,m_V)\\to (W,m_W)</math> as a morphism <math>f:\\hat{S}\\Sigma V^*\\to\\hat{S}\\Sigma W^*</math> of their representing commutative differential graded algebras that commutes with the vector field, i.e. <math>f \\circ m_V = m_W \\circ f </math>. Homotopy Lie algebras and their morphisms define a [[category (mathematics)|category]].\n\n===Definition via multi-linear maps===\n\nThe more traditional definition of a homotopy Lie algebra is through an infinite collection of symmetric multi-linear maps that is sometimes referred to as the definition via higher brackets. It should be stated that the two definitions are equivalent.\n\nA '''homotopy Lie algebra''' on a [[graded vector space]] <math>V = \\bigoplus V_i </math> is a collection of symmetric multi-linear maps <math>l_n \\colon V^{\\otimes n}\\to V</math> of degree <math>n-2</math>, sometimes called the <math>n</math>-ary bracket, for each <math>n\\in\\mathbb{N}</math>. Moreover, the maps <math>l_n</math> satisfy the generalised Jacobi identity:\n:<math> \\sum_{i+j=n+1} \\sum_{\\sigma\\in \\text{UnShuff}(i,n-i)}  \\chi (\\sigma ,v_1 ,\\dots ,v_n ) (-1)^{i(j-1)} l_j (l_i (v_{\\sigma (1)} , \\dots ,v_{\\sigma (i)}),v_{\\sigma (i+1)}, \\dots ,v_{\\sigma (n)})=0,</math>\nfor each n. Here the inner sum runs over <math>(i,j)</math>-unshuffles and <math>\\chi </math> is the signature of the permutation. The above formula have meaningful interpretations for low values of n; for instance, when <math>n=1</math> it is saying that <math>l_1</math> squares to zero (i.e., it is a differential on <math>V</math>), when <math>n=2</math> it is saying that <math>l_1</math> is a derivation of <math>l_2</math>, and when <math>n=3</math> it is saying that <math>l_2</math> satisfies the Jacobi identity up to an exact term of <math>l_3</math> (i.e. it holds up to homotopy). Notice that when the higher brackets <math>l_n</math> for <math>n\\geq 3</math> vanish, the definition of a [[differential graded Lie algebra]] on V is recovered.\n\nUsing the approach via multi-linear maps, a morphism of homotopy Lie algebras can be defined by a collection of symmetric multi-linear maps <math> f_n\\colon V^{\\otimes n} \\to W</math> which satisfy certain conditions.\n\n===Definition via operads===\n\nThere also exists a more abstract definition of a homotopy algebra using the theory of [[operads]]: that is, a homotopy Lie algebra is an [[algebra over an operad]] in the category of chain complexes over the <math>L_\\infty</math> operad.\n\n== (Quasi) isomorphisms and minimal models ==\n\nA morphism of homotopy Lie algebras is said to be a (quasi) isomorphism if its linear component <math>f\\colon V\\to W</math> is a (quasi) isomorphism where the differentials of <math>V</math> and <math>W</math> are just the linear components of <math>m_V</math> and <math>m_W</math>.\n\nAn important special class of homotopy Lie algebras are the so-called '''minimal''' homotopy Lie algebras. These are those where the linear component <math>l_1</math> vanishes. This means that any quasi isomorphism of minimal homotopy Lie algebras must be an isomorphism. Any homotopy Lie algebra is quasi-isomorphic to a minimal one, which must be unique up to isomorphism and it is therefore called its '''minimal model'''.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Differential graded algebra]]\n*[[Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism|BV formalism]]\n*[[Simplicial Lie algebra]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n[[Category:Differential algebra]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_convex_cone",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], an '''invariant convex cone''' is a closed [[convex cone]] in a [[Lie algebra]] of a  connected [[Lie group]] that is invariant under inner automorphisms. The study of such cones was initiated by [[Ernest Vinberg]] and [[Bertram Kostant]].\n\nFor a simple Lie algebra, the existence of an invariant convex cone forces the Lie algebra to have a Hermitian structure, i.e. the maximal compact subgroup has center isomorphic to the circle group. The invariant convex cone generated by a generator of the Lie algebra of the center is closed and is the minimal invariant convex cone (up to a sign). The dual cone with respect to the [[Killing form]] is the maximal invariant convex cone. Any intermediate cone is uniquely determined by its intersection with the Lie algebra of a [[maximal torus]] in a maximal compact subgroup. The intersection is invariant under the [[Weyl group]] of the maximal torus and the orbit of every point in the interior of the cone intersects the interior of the Weyl group invariant cone.\n\nFor the real [[symplectic group]], the maximal and minimal cone coincide, so there is only one invariant convex cone. When one is properly contained in the other, there is a continuum of intermediate invariant convex cones.\n\nInvariant convex cones arise in the analysis of holomorphic semigroups in the [[complexification (Lie group)|complexification]] of the Lie group, first studied by Grigori Olshanskii. They are naturally associated with [[Hermitian symmetric space]]s and their associated [[holomorphic discrete series]]. The semigroup is made up of those elements in the complexification which, when acting on the Hermitian symmetric space of compact type, leave invariant the bounded domain corresponding to the noncompact dual. The semigroup acts by [[contraction (operator theory)|contraction operators]] on the holomorphic discrete series; its interior acts by [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator]]s.  The unitary part of their [[polar decomposition]] is the operator corresponding to an element in the original real Lie group, while the positive part is the exponential of an imaginary multiple of the infinitesimal operator corresponding to an element in the maximal cone. A similar decomposition already occurs in the semigroup.\n\nThe [[oscillator semigroup]] of [[Roger Evans Howe|Roger Howe]] concerns the special case of this theory for the real symplectic group. Historically this has been one of the most important applications and has been generalized to infinite dimensions. This article treats in detail the example of the invariant convex cone for the symplectic group and its use in the study of the symplectic Olshanskii semigroup.\n\n==Invariant convex cone in symplectic Lie algebra==\nThe Lie algebra of the symplectic group on '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> has a unique invariant convex cone. It is self-dual.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Vinberg|1980}}\n*{{harvnb|Paneitz|1983}}\n</ref> The cone and its properties can be derived directly using the description of the symplectic Lie algebra provided by the [[Weyl calculus]] in [[quantum mechanics]].<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Howe|1988}}\n*{{harvnb|Folland|1989}}</ref> Let the variables in '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> be ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''y''<sub>''n''</sub>. Taking the standard inner product on  '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup>, the symplectic form corresponds to the matrix\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{J=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I \\\\ -I & 0\\end{pmatrix}.}</math>\n\nThe real polynomials on '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra under the [[Poisson bracket]]\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\{f,g\\}=\\sum_i {\\partial f\\over \\partial x_i}{\\partial g\\over \\partial y_i} -\n{\\partial f\\over \\partial y_i}{\\partial g\\over \\partial x_i}.}</math>\n\nThe polynomials of degree ≤ 2 form a finite-dimensional Lie algebra with center the constant polynomials. The homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 form a Lie subalgebra isomorphic to the symplectic Lie algebra. The symplectic group acts naturally on this subalgebra by reparametrization and this yields the [[adjoint representation]]. Homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 on the other hand are just symmetric bilinear forms on '''R'''<sub>2''n''</sub>. They therefore correspond to symmetric 2''n'' × 2''n'' matrices. The [[Killing form]] on the Lie algebra is proportional to the trace form Tr ''AB''. \nThe positive definite symmetric bilinear forms give an open invariant convex cone with closure the set ''P'' of positive semi-definite symmetric bilinear forms. Because the Killing form is the trace form, the cone ''P''  is self-dual.\n \nAny positive symmetric bilinear form defines a new inner product on '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup>. The symplectic from defines an invertible skew-adjoint operator ''T'' with respect to this inner product with –''T''<sup>2</sup> a positive operator. An orthonormal basis can be chose so that ''T'' has 2 × 2 skew-symmetric matrices down the diagonal. Scaling the orthonormal basis, it follows that there is a symplectic basis for '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> diagonalizing the original positive symmetric bilinear form. Thus every positive symmetric bilinear form lies in the orbit of a diagonal form under the symplectic group.\n\nIf ''C'' is any other invariant convex cone then it is invariant under the closed subgroup ''U'' of the symplectic group consisting of orthogonal transformations commuting with ''J''. Identifying '''R'''<sup>2''n''</sup> with the complex inner product space '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> using the complex structure ''J'', ''U'' can be identified with ''U''(''n''). Taking any non-zero point in ''C''. the average over ''U'' with respect to [[Haar measure]] lies in ''C'' and is non-zero. The corresponding quadratic form is a multiple of the standard inner product. Replacing ''C'' by –''C'' this multiple can be taken to be positive. There is a copy of SL(2,'''R''') in the symplectic group acting only on the variables ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and ''y''<sub>''i''</sub>. These operators can be used to transform\n{{math|1=(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (''y''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}} into\n{{math|1=''t''(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (2 – ''t'')(''y''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}} with 0 < ''t'' < 2. It follows that ''C'' contains the point {{math|1=(''x''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + (''y''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + ... + (''y''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}}. Applying diagonal scaling operators in the second and subsequent copies of SL(2,'''R'''), the cone ''C'' must contain the quadratic form  {{math|1=(''x''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}}. By invariance ''C'' must also contain the\nquadratic forms {{math|1=(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}} and {{math|1=(''y''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup>}}. By convexity it contains all diagonal positive symmetric bilinear forms. Since any positive symmetric bilinear form is in the orbit of a diagonal form, ''C'' contains the cone of non-negative symmetric bilinear forms. By duality the dual cone ''C''* is contained in ''P''. If ''C'' is a proper cone, the previous argument shows that ''C''* = ''P'' and hence that ''C'' = ''P''.\n\nThis argument shows that every positive definite symmetric form is in the orbit of a form with corresponding quadratic form\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{Q(x,y)=\\sum a_i (x_i^2+y_i^2),}</math>\n\nwith ''a''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0. This corresponds to a cone in the Lie algebra of the (diagonal) [[maximal torus]] of ''U''.\n\nSince every element of ''P'' is diagonalizable, the stabilizer of a positive element in the symplectic group is contained in a conjugate of ''U''. On the other hand, if ''K'' is another compact subgroup of the symplectic group, averaging over Haar measure shows that it leaves invariant a positive element of ''P''. Thus ''K'' is contained in a conjugate of ''U''. It follows that ''U'' is a [[maximal compact subgroup]] of the symplectic group and that any other such subgroup must be a conjugate of ''U''.\n\n==Decomposition in symplectic Olshanski semigroup==\nThe complex symplectic group acts by Möbius transformations on ''X'', the complex symmetric matrices with operator norm less than or equal to one. Representing an element as a 2 × 2 block matrix\n<math>h = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix}</math>, the action is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{h(z)=(az+b)(cz+d)^{-1}.}</math>\n\nThere is a period 2 automorphism σ of the complex symplectic group with fixed point subgroup the real symplectic group. Then ''x''<sup>+</sup> =  σ(x)^{-1} is an antiautomorphism of ''H'' which induces the inverse on the real symplectic group ''G''. If ''g'' is in the open Olshanski semigroup ''H'', let ''h'' = ''g''<sup>+</sup>''g''. By [[Brouwer's fixed point theorem]] applied to the compact convex set ''X'', ''g'' has a fixed point in ''X''. Since ''g'' carries ''X'' into its interior, the fixed point is an interior point. Since ''G'' acts transitively on the interior of ''X'', post-multiplying by an element of ''G'' if necessary, it can be assumed that ''h'' fixes 0. Since ''h''<sup>+</sup> = ''h'', it follows that ''b'' = ''c'' = 0. Conjugating by an element in ''K'' ⊂ SU(1,1), ''a'' and ''d'' can be diagonalized. It has positive eigenvalues, so there is a unique positive diagonal operator ''h''<sub>1</sub> with square ''h''. By uniqueness (''h''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>+</sup> =  ''h''<sub>1</sub>. Since ''h''<sub>1</sub> is diagonal, the theory for SU(1,1) and SL(2,'''C''') acting on the unit disk in '''C''' shows that ''h''<sub>1</sub> lies in exp ''C''. On the other hand, ''k'' = ''g'' (''h''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>−1</sup> satisfies ''k''<sup>+</sup>''k'' = 1 so that σ(''k'') = ''k''. Thus ''k'' lies in ''G'' and therefore, using the invariance of ''C'', ''H'' admits the decomposition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{H=G\\cdot \\exp(C) =\\exp(C)\\cdot G.}</math>\n\nIn fact there is a similar decomposition for the closed Olshanski symplectic semigroup:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\overline{H}=G\\cdot \\exp(\\overline{C}) =\\exp(\\overline{C})\\cdot G.}</math>\n\nMoreover, the map (''g'',''x'') ↦ ''g'' exp ''x'' is a homeomorphism.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Olshanskii|1981}}\n*{{harvnb|Hilgert|Neeb|1993|pp=197–199}}</ref>\n\nIn fact if ''X'' is in ''C'', it is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues. So that exp ''X'' has strictly positive eigenvalues. By continuity if ''X'' is in the closure of ''C'', it has real eigenvalues and exp ''X'' has strictly positive eigenvalues. Any invertible operator that is a limit of \nsuch exp ''X'' will also have strictly positive eigenvalues. By the [[holomorphic functional calculus]] the exponential map on the space of operators with real spectrum defines a homeomorphism onto the space of operators with strictly positive spectrum, with an analytic inverse given by the logarithm. It follows that \n<math>\\exp \\overline{C}</math> is closed in the complex symplectic group.\n\nIf ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> exp ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''h'', then exp 2''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''h''<sup>+</sup>''h''. Since  <math>\\exp \\overline{C}</math> is closed,  ''h''<sup>+</sup>''h'' = exp 2''X'' for some ''X'' and hence ''h'' exp –''X'' lies in ''G''. So the closure of\n<math>G \\exp \\overline{C}</math> is closed and coincides with <math>\\overline{H}</math>. Similarly if ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> exp ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''g'' exp ''X'', then exp 2 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to exp 2''X''. Hence ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''X''. But then\nexp ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to exp ''X'', so that ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''g''.\n\nThe use of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem can be avoided by applying more direct fixed-point theorems for holomorphic mappings, such as the [[Earle–Hamilton fixed point theorem]] and its variants.<ref>{{harvnb|Hervé|1963|pp=83–84}}</ref> In fact a Möbius transformation ''f'' taking {''z'': ||''z''|| < 1, ''z''<sup>''t''</sup> = ''z''} into a compact subset has a unique fixed point ''z''<sub>0</sub> with ''f''<sup>''n''</sup>(''z'') → ''z''<sub>0</sub> for any ''z''.\n\n''Uniqueness'' follows because, if ''f'' has a fixed point, after conjugating by an element of the real symplectic group, it can be assumed to be 0. Then ''f'' has the form ''f''(''z'') = ''az''(1 + ''cz'')<sup>−1</sup>''a''<sup>''t''</sup>, where ''c''<sup>''t''</sup> = ''c'', with iterates\n''f''<sup>''m''</sup>(''z'') = ''a''<sup>''m''</sup>''z''(1 + ''c''<sub>''m''</sub>''z'')<sup>−1</sup>(''a''<sup>''m''</sup>)<sup>''t''</sup> with ''c''<sub>''m''</sub> = ''c'' + ''a''<sup>''t''</sup>''ca'' + ⋅⋅⋅ + (''a''<sup>''m'' − 1</sup>)<sup>''t''</sup>''ca''<sup>''m'' − 1</sup>. Here ''a'' and ''c''<sub>''m''</sub> all have operator norm less than one. Thus for ||''z''|| ≤ ''r'' < 1, ''f''<sup>''m''</sup>(''z'') tends to 0 uniformly, so that in particular 0 is the unique fixed point and it is obtained by applying iterates of ''f''.\n\n''Existence'' of a fixed point for ''f'' follows by noting that is an increasing sequence ''n''<sub>''k''</sub> such that ''f''<sup>''n''<sub>''k''</sub></sup> and ''f''<sup>''n''<sub>2''k'' + 1</sub> − ''n''<sub>2''k''</sub></sup> are both uniformly convergent on compacta, to ''h'' and ''g'' respectively. This follows because real symplectic transformations ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> can be chosen so that ''h''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''g''<sub>''n''</sub> ∘ ''f''<sup>''n''</sup> fixes 0, with a subsequence of ''g''<sub>''n''</sub>'s convergent precisely when the corresponding subsequence of ''f''<sup>''n''</sup>(0) is convergent. Since the transformations ''h''<sub>''n''</sub> can be written as ''h''<sub>''n''</sub>(''z'') = ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''z''(1 + ''b''<sub>''n''</sub>''z'')<sup>−1</sup> (''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sup>''t''</sup>, convergent subsequences can be chosen.  By construction ''g'' ∘ ''h'' = ''h''. So points in the image of ''h'' are fixed by ''g''. Now ''g'' and ''h'' are either constant or have the form ''az''(1 + ''cz'')<sup>−1</sup>''a''<sup>''t''</sup> followed by a real symplectic transformation. Since the image of ''h'' is connected and a non-constant map has just one fixed point, the image of ''h'' is a single point ''z''<sub>0</sub>, fixed by ''g''. Since ''g'' commutes with ''f'',  ''f''(''z''<sub>0</sub>) is also fixed by ''g'' and hence ''f''(''z''<sub>0</sub>)= ''z''<sub>0</sub>, so that ''z''<sub>0</sub> is a fixed point of ''f''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hervé|1963|pp=83–84}}</ref>\n\n==Maximality of symplectic Olshanski semigroup==\nThe symplectic group acts transitively by Möbius transformations on the complex symmetric matrices with operator norm less than one. The open Olshanski semigroup consists of Möbius transformations in the complex symplectic group which take the space complex symmetric matrices of norm ≤ 1 into complex symmetric matrices of norm < 1. Its closure is a maximal proper semigroup in the complex symplectic group.\n\nIn two dimensions this follows from [[oscillator representation#Semigroups in SL(2,C)|a general argument]] of {{harvtxt|Lawson|1998}} which also applies in one dimension. Let ''G'' = SL(2,'''R''') act by Möbius transformations on the extended real line and let ''H'' be the open semigroup consisting of transformations carrying [–1,1] into (–1,1). Its closure <math>\\overline{H}</math> is the closed semigroup of transformations carrying [–1,1] into itself. Maximality of <math>\\overline{H}</math> is proved by first showing that any strictly larger semigroup ''S'' contains an element ''g'' sending |''t''| < 1 onto |''t''| > 1. In fact if ''x'' is in ''S'' but not in <math>\\overline{H}</math>, then there is an interval ''I''<sub>1</sub> in ''I'' = (–1,1) such that ''x'' ''I''<sub>1</sub> lies in [–1,1]<sup>''c''</sup>. Then for some ''h'' in ''H'', ''I''<sub>1</sub> = ''hI''. Similarly ''yxI''<sub>1</sub> = [–1,1]<sup>''c''</sup> for some ''y'' in ''H''. So ''g'' = ''yxh'' lies in ''S'' and sends ''I'' onto  [–1,1]<sup>''c''</sup>. It follows that ''g''<sup>2</sup> fixes ''I'', so that ''g''<sup>−1</sup> lies in ''S''. If ''z'' lies in ''H'' then ''z'' ''g'' ''I'' contains ''g'' ''I''. Hence ''g''<sup>−1</sup>''z''<sup>−1</sup> ''g'' lies in <math>\\overline{H}</math>. So ''z''<sup>−1</sup> lies in ''S'' and therefore ''S'' contains an open neighbourhood of ''1''.  Hence ''S'' = SL(2,'''R''').<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Lawson|1998}}\n*{{harvnb|Hilgert|Neeb|1993|pp=48–56}}\n</ref>\n\nMaximality can be deduced for the Olshanski symplectic semigroup in SL(2,'''C''') from the maximality of this semigroup in SL(2,'''R'''). It suffices to show that the closed semigroup contains SL(2,'''R'''), because the scaling transformations lie in the interior of the Olshanski symplectic semigroup. So if their inverses lie in the symplectic semigroup, it contains a neighbourhood of the identity and hence the whole of SL(2,'''C'''). If ''S'' is a semigroup properly containing the symplectic semigroup, it contains an element carrying the closed unit disk outside itself. Pre- and post-composing with elements of SU(1,1), it can be assumed that the element ''g'' of ''S'' carries 0 into ''r'' > 1. Precomposing with a scaling transformation, it can be assumed that ''g'' carries the closed unit disk onto a small neighbourhood of ''r''. Pre-composing with an element of SU(1,1), the inverse image of the real axis can be taken to be the diameter joining –1 and 1. But in that case, ''g'' must lie in SL(2,'''R'''). From the maximality result for semigroups in SL(2,'''R'''), ''S'' must contain SL(2,'''R''') and hence must be the whole of SL(2,'''C''').<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Lawson|1998}}\n*{{harvnb|Hilgert|Neeb|1993|pp=48–56}}\n</ref>\n\n[[Autonne–Takagi factorization]] states that for any complex symmetric matrix ''M'', there is a unitary matrix ''U'' such that ''UMU''<sup>''t''</sup> is diagonal.<ref>See for example {{harvnb|Siegel|1932|pp=12, 14–15}}</ref> If''S'' is a semigroup properly containing the closure of the Olshanki semigroup, then it contains an element ''g'' such that ''z'' = ''g''(0) with 1< ||''z''|| < ∞.\n\nIndeed, there is an embedding due to [[Harish-Chandra]] of the space of complex symmetric ''n'' by ''n'' matrices as a dense open subset of the compact Grassmannian of Langrangian subspaces of '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup>. Morevoer this embedding is equivariant for the action of the real symplectic group.<ref>{{harvnb|Mok|1989|pp=65–71}}</ref> In fact, with the standard complex inner product on '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup>, the Grassmannian of ''n''-dimensional subspaces has a continuous transitive action of SL(2''n'','''C''') and its maximal compact subpgroup SU(2''n''). It can be identified with the space of orthogonal rank ''n'' projections, a compact subspace of M<sub>2''n''</sub>('''C''').\nTaking coordinates (''z''<sub>1</sub>,...,''z''<sub>''n''</sub>,''w''<sub>1</sub>,...,''w''<sub>''n''</sub>) on '''C'''<sup>2''n''</sup>, the symplectic form is given by\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{B((z,w),(z^\\prime,w^\\prime))=\\sum z_iw_i^\\prime - w_iz_i^\\prime.}</math>\n\nAn ''n''-dimensional subspace ''U'' is called Lagrangian if ''B'' vanishes on ''U''. The Lagrangian subpaces form a closed subset of the Grassmannian on which the complex symplectic group and the unitary symplectic group act transitively. This is the Lagrangian Grassmannian. The subspace ''U''<sub>0</sub> formed of vectors with ''z''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 is Lagrangian. The set of Langrangian subspaces ''U'' for which the restriction of the orthogonal projection onto ''U''<sub>0</sub> is an isomorphism forms an open dense subset Ω of the Lagrangian Grassmannian. Any such subspace has a canonical basis whose column vectors form a 2''n'' by ''n'' matrix <math>\\begin{pmatrix} Z\\\\ I\\end{pmatrix}</math> where ''Z'' is a complex symmetric ''n'' by ''n'' matrix and ''I'' is the ''n'' by ''n'' identity matrix. Under this correspondence elements of the complex symplectic group, viewed as block matrices \n<math>g = \\begin{pmatrix} A & B \\\\ C & D\\end{pmatrix}</math> act as Möbius transformations,\n''g''(''Z'') = (''AZ'' + ''B'')(''CZ'' + ''D'')<sup>−1</sup>. The unit ball for the operator norm and its closure are left invariant under the corresponding real form of the symplectic group.\n\nIf an element ''g'' of the complex symplectic group does not lie in the closure of Olshanski semigroup, it must carry some point ''W'' of the open unit ball into the complement of its closure. If ''g''(''W'') does not lie in Ω then the image of a small ball about ''W'' must contain points with in Ω \nwith arbitrarily large operator norm. Precomposing ''g'' with a suitable element in ''G'', it follows that ''Z'' = ''g''(0) will have operator norm greater than 1. If ''g''(''W'') already lies in  Ω, it will also have operator norm greater than 1 and ''W'' can be then be taken to be 0 by precomposing with a suitable element of ''G''.\n\nPre-composing ''g'' with a scaling transformation and post-composing ''g'' with a unitary transformation, it can be assumed that ''g''(0) is a diagonal matrix with entries λ<sub>''i''</sub> ≥ 0  with ''r'' = λ<sub>1</sub> > 0 and that the image of the unit ball is contained in a small ball around this point. The entries λ<sub>''i''</sub> with ''i'' ≥ 2 can be separately scaled byelements of the Olshanki semigroup so that λ<sub>''i''</sub> < 1; and then they can be sent to 0 by elements of ''G'' lying in commuting copies of SU(1,1). So ''g''(0) is a diagonal matrix with entries ''r'', 0,...,0, where ''r'' > 1.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Oscillator representation]]\n*[[Symmetric cone]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first=G.

      "text": "{{Short description|property of some binary operations, such as the cross product and any ring's commutator}}\nIn [[mathematics]] the '''Jacobi identity''' is a property of a [[binary operation]] which describes how the order of evaluation (the placement of parentheses in a multiple product) affects the result of the operation. By contrast, for operations with the [[associativity|associative property]], any order of evaluation gives the same result (parentheses in a multiple product are not needed).  The identity is named after the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi]].  \n\nThe [[cross product]] <math>a\\times b</math> and the [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket operation]] <math>[a,b]</math> both satisfy the Jacobi identity. In [[analytical mechanics]], the Jacobi identity is satisfied by the [[Poisson bracket]]s. In [[quantum mechanics]], it is satisfied by operator [[Commutator#Ring theory|commutator]]s on a [[Hilbert space]] and, equivalently, in the [[phase space formulation]] of quantum mechanics by the [[Moyal bracket]].\n\n== Definition ==\nConsider a set '''A''' with two binary operations + and ''×'' ,  with an additive identity 0. This satisfies the Jacobi identity if:\n\n:<math>x \\times (y \\times z)  \\ +\\ y \\times (z \\times x) \\ +\\ z \\times (x \\times y)\\ =\\ 0 \\quad \\forall\\ {x,y,z}\\in A.</math>\n\nThe left side is the sum of all even permutations of ''x ×'' (''y ×'' ''z''): that is, we leave the parentheses fixed and interchange letters an even number of times.\n\n==Commutator bracket form==\nThe simplest example of a [[Lie algebra]] is constructed from the (associative) ring of <math>n\\times n</math> matrices, which may be thought of as infinitesimal motions of an ''n''-dimensional vector space. The × operation is the [[commutator]], which measures the failure of commutativity in matrix multiplication; instead of <math>X\\times Y</math>, one uses the Lie bracket notation:\n:<math>[X,Y]=XY-YX.</math>\n\nIn this notation, the Jacobi identity is:\n{{Equation box 1\n |indent =:\n |equation =<math>[X, [Y, Z] ] + [Y, [Z, X] ] + [Z, [X, Y] ] \\ =\\  0.</math>\n |cellpadding= 6\n |border\n |border colour = #0070BF\n |bgcolor=#FAFFFB\n|title=}}\nThis is easily checked by a computation. \n\nMore generally, suppose '''A''' is an associative algebra and ''V'' is a subspace of '''A''' which is closed under the bracked operation: <math>[X,Y]=XY-YX</math> belongs to ''V'' for all <math>X,Y\\in V</math>. Then the Jacobi identity continues to hold on ''V''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 3.3</ref> Thus, if a binary operation <math>[X,Y]</math> satisfies the Jacobi identity, we may say that it ''behaves as if'' it were given by <math>XY-YX</math> in some associative algebra, even if it is not actually defined that way.\n\nUsing the [[anticommutativity|antisymmetry property]] <math>[X,Y]=-[Y,X]</math>, the Jacobi identity can be rewritten as a modification of the [[associativity|associative property]]: \n\n:<math>[[X, Y], Z] = [X, [Y, Z]] - [Y, [X, Z]]~.</math>\n\nConsidering <math>[X,Z]</math> as the action of the infinitesimal motion ''X'' on ''Z'', this can be stated as: \n{{quote\n | The action of ''Y'' followed by ''X'' (operator <math>[X,[Y,\\cdot\\ ] ]</math>), minus the action of ''X'' followed by ''Y'' (operator <math>([Y,[X,\\cdot\\ ] ]</math>), is equal to the action of <math>[X,Y]</math>, (operator <math>[ [X,Y],\\cdot\\ ]</math>).\n|sign=|source=}}\n\nThere is also a plethora of [[Lie_superalgebra#Properties|graded Jacobi identities]] involving [[Commutator#Anticommutator|anticommutators]] <math>\\{X,Y\\}</math>, such as:\n\n:<math>\n[\\{X,Y\\},Z]+ [\\{Y,Z\\},X]+[\\{Z,X\\},Y] =0,\\qquad\n[\\{X,Y\\},Z]+ \\{[Z,Y],X\\}+\\{[Z,\nX],Y\\} =0.\n</math>\n{{see also|Lie bracket of vector fields|Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula}}\n\n==Adjoint form==\nThe majority of common examples of the Jacobi identity come from the bracket multiplication <math>[x,y]</math> on [[Lie Algebra|Lie algebras]] and [[Lie ring]]s. The Jacobi identity is written as:\n\n: <math>[x,[y,z]] + [z,[x,y]] + [y,[z,x]] = 0.</math>\n\nBecause the bracket multiplication is [[anticommutativity|antisymmetric]], the Jacobi identity admits two equivalent reformulations. Defining the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint operator]] <math>\\operatorname{ad}_x: y \\mapsto [x,y]</math>, the identity becomes:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_x[y,z]=[\\operatorname{ad}_xy,z]+[y,\\operatorname{ad}_xz].</math>\n\nThus, the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras states that the action of any element on the algebra is a [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]]. This form of the Jacobi identity is also used to define the notion of [[Leibniz algebra]].\n\nAnother rearrangement shows that the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the following identity between the operators of the adjoint representation:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}=[\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\operatorname{ad}_y].</math>\n\nHere the bracket on the left side is the operation of the original algebra, the bracket on the right is the commutator of the composition of operators, and the identity states that the <math>\\mathrm{ad}</math> map sending each element to its adjoint action is a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]].\n\n== Related identities ==\nThe [[Commutator#Identities (group theory)|Hall–Witt identity]] is the analogous identity for the [[commutator]] operation in a [[group (mathematics)|group]].\n\nThe following identitity follows from anticommutativity and Jacobi identity and holds in arbitrary Lie algebra:<ref>{{cite arXiv\n | first=Ilya |last=Alekseev | first2=Sergei O. |last2=Ivanov |arxiv=1604.05281\n | title       = Higher Jacobi Identities |date=18 April 2016\n }}</ref>\n\n: <math>[x,[y,[z,w]]] + [y,[x,[w,z]]] + [z,[w,[x,y]]] + [w,[z,[y,x]]] = 0.</math>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Structure constants]]\n* [[Super Jacobi identity]]\n* [[Three subgroups lemma]] (Hall–Witt identity)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{citation|first=Brian C.|last=Hall|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition= 2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}.\n\n== External links ==\n*{{MathWorld|JacobiIdentities|Jacobi Identities}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jacobi Identity}}\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Mathematical identities]]\n[[Category:Non-associative algebra]]"

      "text": "In mathematics, the '''Jordan–Chevalley decomposition''', named after [[Camille Jordan]] and [[Claude Chevalley]], expresses a [[linear operator]] as the sum of its commuting [[Semi-simple operator|semisimple]] part and its [[nilpotent]] parts. The multiplicative decomposition expresses an invertible operator as the product of its commuting semisimple and unipotent parts. The decomposition is important in the study of [[algebraic group]]s. The decomposition is easy to describe when the [[Jordan normal form]] of the operator is given, but it exists under weaker hypotheses than the existence of a Jordan normal form.\n\n== Decomposition of endomorphisms ==\n\nConsider linear operators on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] over a [[perfect field]]. An operator T is [[Semisimple operator|semisimple]] if every T-invariant subspace has a complementary T-invariant subspace (if the underlying field is [[algebraically closed]], this is the same as the requirement that the operator be [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]]). An operator ''x'' is ''nilpotent'' if some power ''x''<sup>''m''</sup> of it is the zero operator. An operator ''x'' is ''unipotent'' if ''x''&nbsp;−&nbsp;1 is nilpotent.\n\nNow, let ''x'' be any operator. A Jordan–Chevalley decomposition of ''x'' is an expression of it as a sum:\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>ss</sub> + ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>ss</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>n</sub> is nilpotent, and ''x''<sub>ss</sub> and ''x''<sub>n</sub> commute. If such a decomposition exists it is unique, and ''x''<sub>ss</sub> and ''x''<sub>n</sub> are in fact expressible as polynomials in ''x'', {{harv|Humphreys|1972|loc=Prop. 4.2, p. 17}}.\n\nIf ''x'' is an invertible operator, then a multiplicative Jordan–Chevalley decomposition expresses ''x'' as a product:\n:''x'' = ''x''<sub>ss</sub> · ''x''<sub>u</sub>,\nwhere ''x''<sub>ss</sub> is semisimple, ''x''<sub>u</sub> is unipotent, and ''x''<sub>ss</sub> and ''x''<sub>u</sub>  commute. Again, if such a decomposition exists it is unique, and ''x''<sub>ss</sub> and ''x''<sub>u</sub> are expressible as polynomials in ''x''.\n\nFor endomorphisms of a finite dimensional vector space whose characteristic polynomial splits into linear factors over the [[ground field]] (which always happens if that is an algebraically closed field), the Jordan–Chevalley decomposition exists and has a simple description in terms of the [[Jordan normal form]]. If ''x'' is in the Jordan normal form, then ''x''<sub>ss</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix on the same basis contains just the diagonal terms of ''x'', and ''x''<sub>n</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix on that basis contains just the off-diagonal terms; ''x''<sub>u</sub> is the endomorphism whose matrix is obtained from the Jordan normal form by dividing all entries of each Jordan block by its diagonal element.\n\n==Decomposition in a real semisimple Lie algebra==\nIn the formulation of Chevalley and [[George Mostow|Mostow]], the additive decomposition states that an element ''X'' in a real [[semisimple Lie algebra]] '''g''' with [[Iwasawa decomposition]] '''g''' = '''k''' ⊕ '''a''' ⊕ '''n'''   can be written as the sum of three commuting elements of the Lie algebra ''X'' = ''S'' + ''D'' + ''N'', with ''S'', ''D'' and ''N'' conjugate to elements in '''k''', '''a''' and '''n''' respectively. In general the terms in the Iwasawa decomposition do not commute.\n\n==Decomposition in a real semisimple Lie group==\nThe multiplicative decomposition states that if ''g'' is an element of the corresponding connected semisimple Lie group ''G'' with corresponding Iwasawa decomposition ''G'' = ''KAN'', then ''g'' can be written as the product of three commuting elements ''g'' = ''sdu'' with ''s'', ''d'' and ''u'' conjugate to elements of ''K'', ''A'' and ''N'' respectively. In general the terms in the Iwasawa decomposition ''g'' = ''kan'' do not commute.\n\n==Counterexample==\nIf the ground field is not [[perfect field|perfect]], then a Jordan–Chevalley decomposition may not exist. Example: Let ''p'' be a prime number, let ''k'' be imperfect of characteristic ''p'', and choose ''a'' in ''k'' that is not a ''p''th power.  Let ''V = k[x]/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)<sup>2</sup>'', and let ''T'' be the ''k''-linear operator given by multiplication by ''x'' on ''V''.  This has as its stable ''k''-linear subspaces precisely the ideals of ''V'' viewed as a ring.  Suppose ''T=S+N'' for commuting ''k''-linear operators ''S'' and ''N'' that are respectively semisimple (just over ''k'', which is weaker than semisimplicity over an algebraic closure of ''k'') and nilpotent.  Since ''S'' and ''N'' commute, they each commute with ''T=S+N'' and hence each acts ''k[x]''-linearly on ''V''.  Thus, each preserves the unique nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule ''J=(x<sup>p</sup>-a)V'' in ''V''.  But by semisimplicity of ''S'', there would have to be an ''S''-stable ''k''-linear complement to ''J''.  However, by ''k[x]''-linearity, ''S'' and ''N'' are each given by multiplication against the respective polynomials ''s = S(1)'' and ''n =N(1)'' whose induced effects on the quotient ''V/(x<sup>p</sup>-a)'' must be respectively ''x'' and ''0'' since this quotient is a field.  Hence, ''s = x + (x<sup>p</sup>-a)h(x)'' for some polynomial ''h(x)'' (which only matters modulo ''(x<sup>p</sup>-a)''), so it is easily seen{{dubious|date=July 2016}} that ''s'' generates ''V'' as a ''k''-algebra and thus the ''S''-stable ''k''-linear subspaces of ''V'' are precisely the ''k[x]''-submodules.  It follows that an ''S''-stable complement to ''J'' is also a ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V'', contradicting that ''J'' is the only nonzero proper ''k[x]''-submodule of ''V''.  Thus, there is no decomposition of ''T'' as a sum of commuting ''k''-linear operators that are respectively semisimple and nilpotent.\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|last=Chevalley|first= Claude|title= Théorie des groupes de Lie.

(The zero functional is not considered a root by convention.) The set of all roots of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is often denoted by <math>\\Delta</math> and sometimes by <math>R</math>. For a given root <math>\\lambda</math>, one denotes by <math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\lambda</math> the '''root space''' of <math>\\lambda</math>; that is,\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\lambda = \\{x\\in\\mathfrak{g}:\\forall h\\in\\mathfrak{h}, [h,x] = \\lambda(h)x\\}</math>.\n\nIt follows from the defining relations of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> that <math>e_i\\in\\mathfrak{g}_{\\alpha_i}</math> and <math>f_i\\in\\mathfrak{g}_{-\\alpha_i}</math>.

In order to classify Kac–Moody algebras, it is enough to consider the case of an ''indecomposable'' matrix ''C'', that is, assume that there is no decomposition of the set of indices ''I'' into a disjoint union of non-empty subsets ''I''<sub>1</sub> and ''I''<sub>2</sub> such that ''C''<sub>''ij''</sub> = 0 for all ''i'' in ''I''<sub>1</sub> and ''j'' in ''I''<sub>2</sub>. Any decomposition of the generalized Cartan matrix leads to the direct sum decomposition of the corresponding Kac–Moody algebra:\n\n: <math>\\mathfrak{g}(C) \\simeq \\mathfrak{g}\\left(C_1\\right) \\oplus \\mathfrak{g}\\left(C_2\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the two Kac–Moody algebras in the right hand side are associated with the submatrices of ''C'' corresponding to the index sets ''I''<sub>1</sub> and ''I''<sub>2</sub>.\n\nAn important subclass of Kac–Moody algebras corresponds to ''[[symmetrizable matrix|symmetrizable]]'' generalized Cartan matrices ''C'', which can be decomposed as ''DS'', where ''D'' is a [[diagonal matrix]] with positive integer entries and ''S'' is a [[symmetric matrix]]. Under the assumptions that ''C'' is symmetrizable and indecomposable, the Kac–Moody algebras are divided into three classes:\n\n*A [[positive definite matrix]] ''S'' gives rise to a finite-dimensional [[simple Lie algebra]].\n*A [[positive semidefinite matrix]] ''S'' gives rise to an infinite-dimensional Kac–Moody algebra of '''affine type''', or an [[affine Lie algebra]].\n*An [[indefinite matrix]] ''S'' gives rise to a Kac–Moody algebra of '''indefinite type'''.\n*Since the diagonal entries of ''C'' and ''S'' are positive, ''S'' cannot be [[negative definite matrix|negative definite]] or negative semidefinite.\n\nSymmetrizable indecomposable generalized Cartan matrices of finite and affine type have been completely classified. They correspond to [[Dynkin diagram]]s and [[affine Dynkin diagram]]s. Little is known about the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, although the groups corresponding to these Kac–Moody algebras were constructed over arbitrary fields by Jacques Tits.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tits |first=J. |title =Uniqueness and presentation of Kac–Moody groups over fields|journal=[[Journal of Algebra]] |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=542–573 |year=1987 |doi=10.1016/0021-8693(87)90214-6}}</ref>\n\nAmong the Kac–Moody algebras of indefinite type, most work has focused on those '''hyperbolic type''', for which the matrix ''S'' is indefinite, but for each proper subset of ''I'', the corresponding submatrix is positive definite or positive semidefinite.

The name ''\"Killing form\"'' first appeared in a paper of [[Armand Borel]] in 1951, but he stated in 2001 that he doesn't remember why he chose it. Borel admits that the name seems to be a [[misnomer]], and that it would be more correct to call it the ''\"Cartan form\"''.<ref name=Borelp5>Borel, p.5</ref> [[Wilhelm Killing]] had noted that the coefficients of the characteristic equation of a regular semisimple element of a Lie algebra is invariant under the adjoint group, from which it follows that the Killing form (i.e. the degree 2 coefficient) is invariant, but he did not make much use of this fact. A basic result Cartan made use of was [[Cartan's criterion]], which states that the Killing form is non-degenerate if and only if the Lie algebra is a [[Semisimple Lie algebra|direct sum of simple Lie algebras]].<ref name=Borelp5/>\n\n== Definition ==\n\nConsider a [[Lie algebra]] {{math|'''g'''}} over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] {{math|''K''}}. Every element {{math|''x''}} of {{math|'''g'''}} defines the [[adjoint endomorphism]] {{math|ad(''x'')}} (also written as {{math|ad<sub>''x''</sub>}}) of {{math|'''g'''}} with the help of the Lie bracket, as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}(x)(y) = [x, y].</math>\n\nNow, supposing {{math|'''g'''}} is of finite dimension, the [[trace of a matrix|trace]] of the composition of two such endomorphisms defines a [[symmetric bilinear form]]\n\n:<math>B(x, y) = \\operatorname{trace}(\\operatorname{ad}(x)\\operatorname{ad}(y)),</math>\n\nwith values in {{math|''K''}}, the '''Killing form''' on {{math|'''g'''}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n* The Killing form {{math|''B''}} is bilinear and symmetric. \n* The Killing form is an invariant form, in the sense that it has the 'associativity' property\n\n::<math>B([x, y], z) = B(x, [y, z]),</math>  \n: where [ , ] is the [[Lie algebra#Definition and first properties|Lie bracket]].\n\n* If {{math|'''g'''}} is a [[simple Lie algebra]] then any invariant symmetric bilinear form on {{math|'''g'''}} is a scalar multiple of the Killing form.\n* The Killing form is also invariant under [[automorphism]]s {{math|''s''}} of the algebra {{math|'''g'''}}, that is,\n\n::<math>B(s(x), s(y)) = B(x, y)</math>\n:for {{math|''s''}} in {{math|Aut('''g''')}}.\n\n* The [[Cartan criterion]] states that a Lie algebra is [[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] if and only if the Killing form is [[degenerate form|non-degenerate]].\n* The Killing form of a [[nilpotent Lie algebra]] is identically zero.\n* If {{math|''I'', ''J''}} are two [[ideal of a Lie algebra|ideals]] in a Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} with zero intersection, then {{math|''I''}} and {{math|''J''}} are [[orthogonal]] subspaces with respect to the Killing form.\n* The orthogonal complement with respect to {{math|''B''}} of an ideal is again an ideal.<ref>{{Fulton-Harris}} See page 207.</ref>\n* If a given Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} is a direct sum of its ideals {{math|''I''<sub>1</sub>,...,''I<sub>n</sub>''}}, then the Killing form of {{math|'''g'''}} is the direct sum of the Killing forms of the individual summands.\n\n== Matrix elements ==\n\nGiven a basis {{math|''e<sup>i</sup>''}} of the Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}}, the matrix elements of the Killing form are given by\n\n:<math>B^{ij}= \\mathrm{tr} (\\mathrm{ad}(e^i)\\circ \\mathrm{ad}(e^j)) / I_{ad}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''I''<sub>ad</sub>}} is the [[Dynkin index]] of the adjoint representation of {{math|'''g'''}}. Here\n\n:<math>\\left(\\textrm{ad}(e^i) \\circ \\textrm{ad}(e^j)\\right)(e^k)=  [e^i, [e^j, e^k]] = [e^i, {c^{jk}}_{m}e^m] = {c^{im}}_{n} {c^{jk}}_{m} e^n</math>\n\nin [[Einstein summation notation]], where the {{math|''c''<sup>''ij''</sup><sub>''k''</sub>}} are the [[Structure constants|structure coefficients]] of the Lie algebra. The index {{math|''k''}} functions as column index and the index {{math|''n''}} as row index in the matrix {{math|ad(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>)ad(''e''<sub>''j''</sub>)}}. Taking the trace amounts to putting {{math|''k'' {{=}} ''n''}} and summing, and so we can write\n\n:<math>B^{ij} = \\frac{1}{I_{{ad}}} {c^{im}}_{n} {c^{jn}}_{m}</math>\n\nThe Killing form is the simplest 2-[[tensor]] that can be formed from the structure constants.\n\nIn the above indexed definition, we are careful to distinguish upper and lower indices (''co-'' and ''contra-variant'' indices).  This is because, in many cases, the Killing form can be used as a metric tensor on a manifold, in which case the distinction becomes an important one for the transformation properties of tensors. When the Lie algebra is [[Semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] over a zero-characteristic field, its Killing form is nondegenerate, and hence can be used as a [[metric tensor]] to raise and lower indexes.  In this case, it is always possible to choose a basis for {{math|'''g'''}} such that the structure constants with all upper indices are [[antisymmetric tensor|completely antisymmetric]].\n\nThe Killing form for some Lie algebras {{math|'''g'''}} are (for {{math|''X'', ''Y''}} in {{math|'''g'''}} viewed in their fundamental n by n (2n by 2n) representations):\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{math|'''g'''}} || {{math|''B''(''X'', ''Y'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''gl'''(''n'', '''R''')}} || {{math|2''n'' tr(''XY'') − 2 tr(''X'')tr(''Y'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''sl'''(''n'', '''R''')}} || {{math|2''n'' tr(''XY'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''su'''(''n'')}} || {{math|2''n'' tr(''XY'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''so'''(''n'', '''R''')}} || {{math|(''n''−2) tr(''XY'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''so'''(''n'')}} || {{math|(''n''−2) tr(''XY'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''sp'''(''2n'', '''R''')}} || {{math|(2''n''+2) tr(''XY'')}}\n|-\n| {{math|'''sp'''(''2n'', '''C''')}} || {{math|(2''n''+2) tr(''XY'')}}\n|}\n\n== Connection with real forms ==\n{{main|Real form (Lie theory)}}\n\nSuppose that <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] over the field of real numbers <math>\\mathbb R</math>. By [[Cartan's criterion]], the Killing form is nondegenerate, and can be diagonalized in a suitable basis with the diagonal entries {{math|±1}}. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the number of positive entries is an invariant of the bilinear form, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the diagonalizing basis, and is called the '''index''' of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. This is a number between {{math|0}} and the dimension of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> which is an important invariant of the real Lie algebra. In particular, a real Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is called '''compact''' if the Killing form is [[negative definite]] (or negative semidefinite if the Lie algebra is not semisimple). Note that this is one of two inequivalent definitions commonly used for compactness of a Lie algebra; the other states that a Lie algebra is compact if it corresponds to a compact Lie group. The definition of compactness in terms of negative definiteness of the Killing form is more restrictive, since using this definition it can be shown that under the [[Lie correspondence]], [[compact Lie algebra]]s correspond to [[compact Lie group]]s.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak g_{\\mathbb C}</math> is a semisimple Lie algebra over the complex numbers, then there are several non-isomorphic real Lie algebras whose [[complexification]] is <math>\\mathfrak g_{\\mathbb C}</math>, which are called its '''real forms'''. It turns out that every complex semisimple Lie algebra admits a unique (up to isomorphism) compact real form <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. The real forms of a given complex semisimple Lie algebra are frequently labeled by the positive index of inertia of their Killing form.\n\nFor example, the complex [[special linear group|special linear algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak {sl}(2, \\mathbb C)</math> has two real forms, the real special linear algebra, denoted <math>\\mathfrak {sl}(2, \\mathbb R)</math>, and the [[special unitary group|special unitary algebra]], denoted <math>\\mathfrak {su}(2)</math>. The first one is noncompact, the so-called '''split real form''', and its Killing form has signature {{math|(2, 1)}}. The second one is the compact real form and its Killing form is negative definite, i.e. has signature {{math|(0, 3)}}. The corresponding Lie groups are the noncompact group <math>\\mathrm {SL}(2, \\mathbb R)</math> of {{math|2 × 2}} real matrices with the unit determinant and the special unitary group <math>\\mathrm {SU}(2)</math>, which is compact.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Casimir invariant]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book|last1=Borel|first1=Armand|title=Essays in the history of Lie groups and algebraic groups|date=2001|publisher=American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society|volume=History of Mathematics, Vol 21}}\n*[[Daniel Bump]], ''Lie Groups'' (2004), Graduate Texts In Mathematics, '''225''', Springer-Verlag. {{isbn|978-0-387-21154-1}} {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4614-8024-2}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Cartan | first1=Élie | title=Sur la structure des groupes de transformations finis et continus | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JY8LAAAAYAAJ | publisher=Nony | series=Thesis | year=1894}}\n*Jurgen Fuchs, ''Affine Lie Algebras and Quantum Groups'', (1992) Cambridge University Press. {{isbn|0-521-48412-X}}\n*{{Fulton-Harris}}\n*{{springer|title=Killing form|id=p/k055400}}\n\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "text": "In [[mathematical physics]] the '''Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations''' or '''KZ equations''' are a linear differential equations satisfied by the [[Correlation function (quantum field theory)|correlation functions]] of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory|two-dimensional conformal field theories]] associated with an [[affine Lie algebra]] at a fixed level. They form a system of [[Complex differential equation|complex]] [[partial differential equation]]s with [[regular singular point]]s satisfied by the ''N''-point functions of [[primary field]]s and can be derived using either the formalism of [[Lie algebra]]s or that of [[vertex algebra]]s. The structure of the genus zero part of the conformal field theory is encoded in the [[monodromy]] properties of these equations. In particular the braiding and fusion of the primary fields (or their associated representations) can be deduced from the properties  of the four-point functions, for which the equations reduce to a single matrix-valued first order complex [[ordinary differential equation]] of Fuchsian type. Originally the Russian physicists [[Vadim Knizhnik]] and [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]] deduced the theory for [[SU(2)]] using the classical formulas of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] for the [[connection coefficients]] of the [[hypergeometric differential equation]].\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_k</math> denote the affine Lie algebra with level {{mvar|k}} and dual [[Coxeter number]] {{mvar|h}}. Let {{mvar|v}} be a vector from a zero mode representation of <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_k</math> and <math>\\Phi(v,z)</math> the primary field associated with it. Let <math>t^a</math> be a basis of the underlying [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, <math>t^a_i</math> their representation on the primary field <math>\\Phi(v_i,z)</math> and {{mvar|η}} the [[Killing form]]. Then for <math>i,j=1,2,\\ldots,N</math> the '''Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations''' read\n\n: <math>\\left( (k+h)\\partial_{z_i} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{\\sum_{a,b} \\eta_{ab} t^a_i \\otimes t^b_j}{z_i-z_j} \\right) \\left \\langle \\Phi(v_N,z_N)\\dots\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\right \\rangle = 0. </math>\n\n==Informal derivation==\nThe Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations result from the existence of null vectors in the <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_k</math> module. This is quite similar to the case in [[minimal models]], where the existence of null vectors result in [[Two-dimensional_conformal_field_theory#BPZ_equations|BPZ differential equations]] for correlation functions. However, in CFTs based on the [[Virasoro algebra]], generic correlation functions and [[Virasoro conformal block|conformal blocks]] do not involve null vectors and do not obey nontrivial differential equations.\n\nThe null vectors of a <math>\\hat{\\mathfrak{g}}_k</math> module are of the form\n\n: <math> \\left( L_{-1} - \\frac{1}{2(k+h)} \\sum_{k \\in \\mathbf{Z}} \\sum_{a,b} \\eta_{ab} J^a_{-k}J^b_{k-1} \\right)v = 0,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|v}} is a highest weight vector and <math>J^a_k</math> the [[Noether's theorem|conserved current]] associated with the affine generator <math>t^a</math>. Since {{mvar|v}} is of highest weight, the action of most <math>J^a_k</math> on it vanish and only <math>J^a_{-1}J^b_{0}</math> remain. The operator-state correspondence then leads directly to the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations as given above.\n\n==Mathematical formulation==\n{{main article|Vertex algebra}}\n\nSince the treatment in {{harvtxt|Tsuchiya|Kanie|1988}}, the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equation has been formulated mathematically in the language of [[vertex algebra]]s due to {{harvtxt|Borcherds|1986}} and {{harvtxt|Frenkel|Lepowsky|Meurman|1988}}. This approach was popularized amongst theoretical physicists by {{harvtxt|Goddard|1988}} and amongst mathematicians by {{harvtxt|Kac|1996}}.\n\nThe vacuum representation ''H''<sub>0</sub> of an [[affine Kac–Moody algebra]] at a fixed level can be encoded in a [[vertex algebra]].\nThe derivation {{mvar|d}} acts as the energy operator ''L''<sub>0</sub> on ''H''<sub>0</sub>, which can be written as a direct sum of the non-negative integer eigenspaces of ''L''<sub>0</sub>, the zero energy space being generated by the vacuum vector  Ω. The eigenvalue of an eigenvector of ''L''<sub>0</sub> is called its energy. For every state ''a'' in ''L'' there is a vertex operator ''V''(''a'',''z'') which creates ''a'' from the vacuum vector Ω, in the sense that\n\n:<math>V(a,0)\\Omega = a.</math>\n\nThe vertex operators of energy 1 correspond to the generators of the affine algebra\n\n:<math> X(z)=\\sum X(n) z^{-n-1}</math>\n\nwhere ''X'' ranges over the elements of the underlying finite-dimensional simple complex Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThere is an energy 2 eigenvector {{math|''L''<sub>−2</sub>Ω}} which give the generators ''L''<sub>''n''</sub> of the [[Virasoro algebra]] associated to the Kac–Moody algebra by the ''Segal–Sugawara construction''\n\n:<math> T(z) = \\sum L_n z^{-n-2}.</math>\n\nIf ''a'' has energy {{mvar|α}}, then the corresponding vertex operator has the form\n\n:<math> V(a,z) = \\sum V(a,n)z^{-n-\\alpha}.</math>\n\nThe vertex operators satisfy\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dz} V(a,z) &= \\left [L_{-1},V(a,z) \\right ]= V \\left (L_{-1}a,z \\right ) \\\\ \n\\left [L_0,V(a,z) \\right ] &= \\left (z^{-1} \\frac{d}{dz} + \\alpha \\right )V(a,z)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nas well as the locality and associativity relations\n\n:<math>V(a,z)V(b,w) = V(b,w) V(a,z) = V(V(a,z-w)b,w).</math>\n\nThese last two relations are understood as analytic continuations: the inner products with finite energy vectors of the three expressions define the same polynomials in {{math|''z''<sup>±1</sup>, ''w''<sup>±1</sup>}} and {{math|(''z'' − ''w'')<sup>−1</sup>}} in the domains |''z''| < |''w''|, |''z''| > |''w''| and |''z'' – ''w''| < |''w''|. All the structural relations of the Kac–Moody and Virasoro algebra can be recovered from these relations, including the Segal–Sugawara construction.\n\nEvery other integral representation ''H<sub>i</sub>'' at the same level becomes a module for the vertex algebra, in the sense that for each ''a'' there is a vertex operator {{math|''V<sub>i</sub>''(''a'', ''z'')}} on ''H<sub>i</sub>'' such that\n\n:<math>V_i(a,z)V_i(b,w) = V_i(b,w) V_i(a,z)=V_i(V(a,z-w)b,w).</math>\n\nThe most general vertex operators at a given level are [[intertwining operator]]s {{math|Φ(''v'', ''z'')}} between representations ''H<sub>i</sub>'' and ''H''<sub>''j''</sub> where ''v'' lies in ''H''<sub>''k''</sub>. These operators can also be written as\n\n:<math> \\Phi(v,z)=\\sum \\Phi(v,n) z^{-n-\\delta}</math>\n\nbut δ can now be [[rational number]]s. Again these intertwining operators are characterized by properties\n\n:<math> V_j(a,z) \\Phi(v,w)= \\Phi(v,w) V_i(a,w) = \\Phi \\left (V_k(a,z-w)v,w \\right)</math>\n\nand relations with ''L''<sub>0</sub> and ''L''<sub>−1</sub> similar to those above.\n\nWhen ''v'' is in the lowest energy subspace for ''L''<sub>0</sub> on ''H<sub>k</sub>'', an irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the operator {{math|Φ(''v'', ''w'')}} is called a [[primary field]] of charge ''k''.\n\nGiven a chain of ''n'' primary fields starting and ending at ''H''<sub>0</sub>, their correlation or ''n''-point function is defined by\n\n:<math> \\left \\langle \\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\Phi(v_2,z_2) \\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle = \\left(\\Phi \\left (v_1,z_1 \\right ) \\Phi \\left (v_2,z_2 \\right ) \\cdots \\Phi \\left (v_n,z_n \\right ) \\Omega, \\Omega \\right ).</math>\n\nIn the physics literature the ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> are often suppressed and the primary field written Φ<sub>''i''</sub>(''z<sub>i</sub>''), with the understanding that it is labelled by the corresponding irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\n===Vertex algebra derivation===\nIf (''X''<sub>''s''</sub>) is an orthonormal basis of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> for the Killing form, the Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equations may be deduced by integrating the correlation function\n\n:<math>\\sum_s \\left \\langle X_s(w)X_s(z)\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle (w-z)^{-1}</math>\n\nfirst in the ''w'' variable around a small circle centred at ''z''; by Cauchy's theorem the result can be expressed as sum of integrals around ''n'' small circles centred at the ''z''<sub>''j''</sub>'s:\n\n:<math>{1\\over 2}(k+h) \\left \\langle T(z)\\Phi(v_1,z_1)\\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle = - \\sum_{j,s} \\left \\langle X_s(z)\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\cdots \\Phi(X_s v_j,z_j) \\Phi(X_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}.</math>\n\nIntegrating both sides in the ''z'' variable about a small circle centred on ''z<sub>i</sub>'' yields the ''i''<sup>th</sup> Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov equation.\n\n===Lie algebra derivation===\nIt is also possible to deduce the Knizhnik–Zamodchikov equations without explicit use of vertex algebras. The term{{math|Φ(''v<sub>i</sub>'', ''z<sub>i</sub>'')}} may be replaced in the correlation function by its commutator with ''L<sub>r</sub>'' where ''r'' = 0, ±1. The result can be expressed in terms of the derivative with respect to ''z<sub>i</sub>''. On the other hand, ''L<sub>r</sub>'' is also given by the Segal–Sugawara formula:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_0 &= (k+h)^{-1}\\sum_s\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}X_s(0)^2 + \\sum_{m>0} X_s(-m)X_s(m)\\right] \\\\\nL_{\\pm 1 } &=(k+h)^{-1} \\sum_s\\sum_{ m\\ge 0} X_s(-m\\pm 1)X_s(m)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAfter substituting these formulas for ''L<sub>r</sub>'', the resulting expressions can be simplified using the commutator formulas\n\n: <math> [X(m),\\Phi(a,n)]= \\Phi(Xa,m+n).</math>\n\n===Original derivation===\nThe original proof of {{harvtxt|Knizhnik|Zamolodchikov|1984}}, reproduced in {{harvtxt|Tsuchiya|Kanie|1988}}, uses a combination of both of the above methods. First note that for ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>\n\n:<math> \\left \\langle X(z)\\Phi(v_1,z_1) \\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle = \\sum_j \\left \\langle \\Phi(v_1,z_1)\\cdots \\Phi(Xv_j,z_j) \\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n) \\right \\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}.</math>\n\nHence\n\n:<math> \\sum_s \\langle X_s(z)\\Phi(z_1,v_1) \\cdots \\Phi(X_sv_i,z_i) \\cdots \\Phi(v_n,z_n)\\rangle = \\sum_j\\sum_s \\langle\\cdots \\Phi(X_s v_j, z_j) \\cdots \\Phi(X_s v_i,z_i) \\cdots\\rangle (z-z_j)^{-1}.</math>\n\nOn the other hand,\n\n:<math>\\sum_s X_s(z)\\Phi \\left (X_sv_i,z_i \\right ) = (z-z_i)^{-1} \\Phi \\left (\\sum_s X_s^2v_i,z_i \\right ) + (k+g){\\partial\\over \\partial z_i} \\Phi(v_i,z_i) +O(z-z_i)</math>\n\nso that\n\n:<math>(k+g)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i} \\Phi(v_i,z_i) = \\lim_{z\\to z_i} \\left[\\sum_s X_s(z)\\Phi \\left (X_sv_i,z_i \\right ) -(z-z_i)^{-1}\\Phi \\left (\\sum_s X_s^2 v_i,z_i \\right )\\right].</math>\n\nThe result follows by using this limit in the previous equality.\n\n== Monodromy representation of KZ equation ==\nIn [[two-dimensional conformal field theory|conformal field theory]] along the [[#definition|above definition]] the ''n''-point correlation function of the primary field satisfies KZ equation. In particular, for <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_2</math> and non negative integers ''k'' there are ''k + 1'' primary fields <math>\\Phi_j(z_j)</math> 's corresponding to [[spin representation|spin <sub>j</sub> representation]] ( ''j = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2,.., k/2''). The correlation function <math>\\Psi(z_1,\\dots,z_n)</math> of the primary fields <math>\\Phi_j(z_j)</math> 's for the representation <math>(\\rho,V_i)</math> takes values in the tensor product <math>V_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes V_n</math> and its KZ equation is\n:<math> (k+2)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z_i}\\Psi=\\sum_{i,j\\ne i}\\frac{\\Omega_{ij}}{z_i-z_j}\\Psi \\ ,</math>\nwhere <math>\\Omega_{ij}=\\sum_a\\rho_i(J^a)\\otimes\\rho_j(J_a)</math>  as the above [[#informal derivation|informal derivation]].\n\nThis ''n''-point correlation function can be analytically continued as multi-valued holomorphic function to the domain <math>X_n \\subset \\mathbb{C}^n</math> with <math>z_i\\ne z_j, i\\ne j</math> . Due to this analytic continuation the [[holonomy]] of KZ equation can be described by the [[braid group]] <math>B_n</math> introduced by [[Emil Artin]].{{harvtxt|Kohno|2002}} In general, A complex semi-simple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and its representations <math>(\\rho,V_i)</math> give the [[linear representation]] of braid group\n:<math>\\theta : B_n \\rightarrow V_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes V_n</math>\nas the holonomy of KZ equation. Oppositely, a KZ equation gives the linear representation of braid groups as its holonomy.\n\nThe action on <math>V_1\\otimes\\dots\\otimes V_n</math> by the analytic continuation of KZ equation is called '''monodromy representation of KZ equation'''. In particular, if all <math>V_i</math> 's have spin <sub>1/2</sub> representation then the linear representation obtained from KZ equation agrees with the representation constructed from [[operator algebra|operator algebra theory]] by [[Vaughan Jones]]. It is known that the monodromy representation of KZ equation with a general semi-simple Lie algebra agrees with the linear representation of braid group given by [[R-matrix]] of the corresponding [[quantum group]].\n\n==Applications==\n*[[Representation theory]] of [[affine Lie algebra]] and [[quantum groups]]\n*[[Braid groups]]\n*[[Topology]] of [[Arrangement of hyperplanes|hyperplane complements]]\n*[[Knot theory]] and [[3-fold]]s\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quantum KZ equations]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*{{cite journal|last=Baik|first=Jinho |author2=Deift, Percy |author3=Johansson, Kurt|title=On the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations|journal=J.

      "text": "In mathematics, '''Kostant's convexity theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Bertram|last=Kostant|year=1973|authorlink=Bertram Kostant}},  states that the projection of every [[coadjoint orbit]] of a connected [[compact Lie group]] into the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] is a [[convex set]]. It is a special case of a more general result for [[symmetric space]]s. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of {{harvtxt|Schur|1923}}, {{harvtxt|Horn|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Thompson|1972}} for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all ''n'' by ''n'' complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ<sub>1</sub>, ..., λ<sub>''n''</sub>) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.\n\nKostant used this to generalize the [[Golden–Thompson inequality]] to all compact groups.\n\n==Compact Lie groups==\nLet ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with [[maximal torus]] ''T'' and [[Weyl group]] ''W'' = ''N''<sub>''K''</sub>(''T'')/''T''. Let their Lie algebras be <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. Let ''P'' be the orthogonal projection of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> onto <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math> for some Ad-invariant inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. Then for ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>, ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the Weyl group.\n\n==Symmetric spaces==\nLet ''G'' be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with ''K'' a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the [[identity component]] of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus ''G''/''K'' is a [[symmetric space]] of compact type. Let  <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.  Let <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let ''Q'' be the orthogonal projection of <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> onto <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> for some Ad(''K'')-invariant inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Then for ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>, ''Q''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices the ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the [[restricted Weyl group]] (the normalizer of <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> in ''K'' modulo its centralizer).\n\nThe case of a compact Lie group is the special case where ''G'' = ''K'' × ''K'', ''K'' is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of ''G'' interchanging the two factors.\n\n==Proof for a compact Lie group==\nKostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1984}}. There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to {{harvtxt|Wildberger|1993}}: it is based on a generalization of the [[Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm]] to compact Lie groups.\n\nLet ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into ''K''. A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if  ''Y'' is in <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> and ''k'' varies in this image of SU(2), then ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') traces a straight line between ''P''(''Y'') and its reflection in the root α.  In particular the component in the α root space—its \"α off-diagonal coordinate\"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from ''P''(''Y'') to ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of ''Y''. Let ''m'' be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of ''K''/''T''. Starting from an arbitrary ''Y''<sub>1</sub> take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get ''Y''<sub>2</sub>. Continue in this way, to get a sequence (''Y''<sub>''n''</sub>). Then\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|P^\\perp(Y_{n+1})\\|^2\\le \\left({m-1\\over m}\\right)\\|P^\\perp(Y_n)\\|^2.}</math>\n\nThus ''P''<sup>⊥</sup>(''Y''<sub>''n''</sub>) tends to 0 and\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\|P(Y_{n+1}-Y_n)\\|\\le \\|P^\\perp(Y_n)\\|.}</math>\n\nHence ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''P''(''Y''<sub>''n''</sub>) is a Cauchy sequence, so  tends to ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>. Since ''Y''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''P''(''Y''<sub>''n''</sub>) ⊕ ''P''<sup>⊥</sup>(''Y''<sub>''n''</sub>), ''Y''<sub>''n''</sub> tends to ''X''. On the other hand, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> lies on the line segment joining ''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub> and its reflection in the root α. Thus ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by ''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub>. These convex polytopes are thus increasing as ''n'' increases and hence ''P''(''Y'') lies in the polytope for ''X''. This can be repeated for each ''Z'' in the ''K''-orbit of ''X''. The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of ''X'' and hence ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is contained in the convex polytope defined by ''W''(''X'').\n\nTo prove the opposite inclusion, take ''X'' to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points ''Y'' in the convex hull of ''W''(''X'') can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality ''X'' corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of ''K'' with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ.<ref>See:\n*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}\n*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}\n</ref>) Each part of the path from ''X'' to ''Y'' can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'').\n\n==Other proofs==\n{{harvtxt|Heckman|1982}} gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in {{harvtxt|Hilgert|Hofmann|Lawson|1989}}. For compact groups, {{harvtxt|Atiyah|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Guillemin|Sternberg|1982}} showed that if ''M'' is a [[symplectic manifold]] with a Hamiltonian action of a torus ''T'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>, then the image of the [[moment map]]\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{M\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{t}^*}</math>\n\nis a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' (the image is a finite set). Taking for ''M'' a coadjoint orbit of ''K'' in <math>\\mathfrak{k}^*</math>, the moment map for ''T'' is the composition\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{M\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{k}^*\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{t}^*.}</math>\n\nUsing the Ad-invariant inner product to identify <math>\\mathfrak{k}^*</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, the map becomes\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{Ad}(K)\\cdot X \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{t},}</math>\n\nthe restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{t}</math>, the fixed points of ''T'' in the orbit Ad(''K'')⋅''X'' are just the orbit under the Weyl group, ''W''(''X''). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices. {{harvtxt|Ziegler|1992}} gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.\n\n{{harvtxt|Duistermaat|1983}} showed that a generalization of the convexity properties of the moment map could be used to treat the more general case of symmetric spaces. Let τ be a smooth involution of ''M'' which takes the symplectic form ω to −ω and such that ''t'' ∘ τ = τ ∘ ''t''<sup>−1</sup>. Then ''M'' and the fixed point set of τ (assumed to be non-empty) have the same image under the moment map. To apply this, let ''T'' = exp <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math>, a torus in ''G''. If ''X'' is in <math>\\mathfrak{a}</math> as before the moment map yields the projection map\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{\\mathrm{Ad}(G)\\cdot X \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{a}.}</math>\n\nLet τ be the map τ(''Y'') =  − σ(''Y''). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad(''K'')⋅''X''. Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' on Ad(''G'')⋅''X'', i.e. the points ''w''(''X'') for ''w'' in ''W'' = N<sub>''K''</sub>(''T'')/C<sub>''K''</sub>(''T'').\n\n==Further directions==\nIn {{harvtxt|Kostant|1973}} the convexity theorem is deduced from a more general convexity theorem concerning the projection onto the  component ''A'' in the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] ''G'' = ''KAN'' of a real semisimple Lie group ''G''. The result discussed above for compact Lie groups  ''K'' corresponds to the special case when ''G'' is the [[complexification]] of ''K'': in this case the Lie algebra of ''A'' can be identified with <math> i \\mathfrak{t}</math>. The more general version of Kostant's theorem has also been generalized to semisimple symmetric spaces by {{harvtxt|van den Ban|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Kac|Peterson|1984}} gave a generalization for infinite-dimensional groups.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|last=Atiyah|first= M.

This can be done as follows. Its cohomology is the [[de Rham cohomology]] of the complex of [[differential form]]s on <math>G</math>. Using an averaging process, this complex can be replaced by the complex of [[equivariant differential form|left-invariant differential forms]]. The left-invariant forms, meanwhile, are determined by their values at the identity, so that the space of left-invariant differential forms can be identified with the [[exterior algebra]] of the Lie algebra, with a suitable differential.\n\nThe construction of this differential on an exterior algebra makes sense for any Lie algebra, so is used to define Lie algebra cohomology for all Lie algebras. More generally one uses a similar construction to define Lie algebra cohomology with coefficients in a module.\n\nIf <math>G</math> is a simply connected ''noncompact'' Lie group, the Lie algebra cohomology of the associated Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> does not necessarily reproduce the de Rham cohomology of <math>G</math>. The reason for this is that the passage from the complex of all differential forms to the complex of left-invariant differential forms uses an averaging process that only makes sense for compact groups.\n\n==Definition==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak g</math> be a Lie algebra over a commutative ring ''R'' with [[universal enveloping algebra]] <math>U\\mathfrak g</math>, and let ''M'' be a representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> (equivalently, a <math>U\\mathfrak g</math>-module). Considering ''R'' as a trivial representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, one defines the cohomology groups\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{H}^n(\\mathfrak{g}; M) := \\mathrm{Ext}^n_{U\\mathfrak{g}}(R, M)</math>\n\n(see [[Ext functor]] for the definition of Ext). Equivalently, these are the right [[derived functors]] of the left exact invariant submodule functor\n\n:<math>M \\mapsto M^{\\mathfrak{g}} := \\{ m \\in M \\mid xm = 0\\ \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, one can define Lie algebra homology as\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{H}_n(\\mathfrak{g}; M) := \\mathrm{Tor}_n^{U\\mathfrak{g}}(R, M)</math>\n\n(see [[Tor functor]] for the definition of Tor), which is equivalent to the left derived functors of the right exact [[coinvariant]]s functor\n\n:<math> M \\mapsto M_{\\mathfrak{g}} := M / \\mathfrak{g} M.</math>\n\nSome important basic results about the cohomology of Lie algebras include [[Whitehead's lemma (Lie algebras)|Whitehead's lemma]]s, [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility|Weyl's theorem]], and the [[Levi decomposition]] theorem.\n\n==Chevalley–Eilenberg complex==\n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a Lie algebra over a field <math>k</math>, with a left action on the <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-module <math>M</math>. The elements of the ''Chevalley–Eilenberg complex''\n: <math>\\mathrm{Hom}_k(\\Lambda^\\bullet\\mathfrak{g},M)</math>\nare called cochains from <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to <math>M</math>. A homogeneous <math>n</math>-cochain from <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to <math>M</math> is thus an alternating <math>k</math>-multilinear function <math>f\\colon\\Lambda^n\\mathfrak{g}\\to M</math>. The Chevalley–Eilenberg complex is canonically isomorphic to the tensor product <math>M \\otimes \\Lambda^{\\bullet}\\mathfrak{g}^*</math>, where <math>\\mathfrak{g}^*</math>denotes the dual vector space of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nThe Lie bracket <math>[\\cdot,\\cdot]\\colon \\Lambda^2 \\mathfrak{g} \\rightarrow \\mathfrak{g}</math> on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> induces a [[Transpose of a linear map|transpose]] application <math>d^{(1)}_{\\mathfrak{g}} \\colon \\mathfrak{g}^* \\rightarrow \\Lambda^2 \\mathfrak{g}^*</math> by duality. The latter is sufficient to define a derivation <math>d_{\\mathfrak{g}}</math> of the complex of cochains from <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to <math>k</math> by extending <math>d_{\\mathfrak{g}}^{(1)}</math>according to the graded Leibniz rule. It follows from the Jacobi identity that <math>d_{\\mathfrak{g}}</math> satisfies <math>d_{\\mathfrak{g}}^2 = 0</math> and is in fact a differential. In this setting, <math>k</math> is viewed as a trivial <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-module while <math>k \\sim \\Lambda^0\\mathfrak{g}^* \\subseteq \\mathrm{Ker}(d_{\\mathfrak{g}})</math> may be thought of as constants.\n\nIn general, let <math>\\gamma \\in \\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathrm{End}(M))</math> denote the left action of  <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on <math>M</math> and regard it as an application <math>d_\\gamma^{(0)} \\colon M \\rightarrow M \\otimes \\mathfrak{g}^*</math>. The Chevalley–Eilenberg differential <math>d</math> is then the unique derivation extending <math>d_\\gamma^{(0)}</math> and <math>d_{\\mathfrak{g}}^{(1)}</math> according to the [[Differential graded algebra|graded Leibniz rule]], the nilpotency condition <math>d^2 = 0</math> following from the Lie algebra homomorphism from <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to <math>\\mathrm{End}(M)</math> and the [[Jacobi identity]] in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nExplicitly, the differential of the <math>n</math>-cochain <math>f</math> is the <math>(n+1)</math>-cochain <math>df</math> given by:<ref>{{cite book|title=An introduction to homological algebra|last1=Weibel|first1=Charles A.|authorlink=Charles Weibel|date=1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=240}}</ref>\n\n<math>\\begin{align}\n  (d f)\\left(x_1, \\ldots, x_{n+1}\\right) =\n    &\\sum_i     (-1)^{i+1}x_i\\, f\\left(x_1, \\ldots, \\hat x_i, \\ldots, x_{n+1}\\right) + \\\\\n    &\\sum_{i<j} (-1)^{i+j}      f\\left(\\left[x_i, x_j\\right], x_1, \\ldots, \\hat x_i, \\ldots, \\hat x_j, \\ldots, x_{n+1}\\right)\\, ,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the caret signifies omitting that argument.\n\nWhen <math>G</math> is a real Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the Chevalley–Eilenberg complex may also be canonically identified with the space of left-invariant forms with values in <math>M</math>, denoted by <math>\\Omega^{\\bullet}(G,M)^G</math>. The Chevalley–Eilenberg differential may then be thought of as a restriction of the covariant derivative on the trivial [[fiber bundle]] <math>G \\times M \\rightarrow G</math>, equipped with the equivariant [[Connection (mathematics)|connection]] <math>\\tilde{\\gamma} \\in \\Omega^1(G,\\mathrm{End}(M))</math> associated with the left action <math>\\gamma \\in \\mathrm{Hom}(\\mathfrak{g}, \\mathrm{End}(M))</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on <math>M</math>. In the particular case where <math>M = k = \\mathbb{R}</math> is equipped with the trivial action of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the Chevalley–Eilenberg differential coincides with the restriction of the [[De Rham cohomology|de Rham differential]] on <math>\\Omega^{\\bullet}(G)</math> to the subspace of left-invariant differential forms.\n\n==Cohomology in small dimensions==\nThe zeroth cohomology group is (by definition) the invariants of the Lie algebra acting on the module:\n:<math>H^0(\\mathfrak{g}; M) =M^{\\mathfrak{g}} = \\{ m \\in M \\mid xm = 0\\ \\text{ for all } x \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\}.</math>\n\nThe first cohomology group is the space {{math|Der}} of derivations  modulo the space {{math|Ider}} of inner derivations\n:<math>H^1(\\mathfrak{g}; M) = \\mathrm{Der}(\\mathfrak{g}, M)/\\mathrm{Ider} (\\mathfrak{g}, M)\\, </math>,\nwhere a derivation is a map <math>d</math> from the Lie algebra to <math>M</math> such that\n:<math>d[x,y] = xdy-ydx~</math>\nand is called inner if it is given by \n:<math>dx = xa~</math>\nfor some <math>a</math> in <math>M</math>.\n\nThe second cohomology group \n:<math>H^2(\\mathfrak{g}; M)</math>\nis the space of equivalence classes of Lie algebra extensions\n:<math>0\\rightarrow M\\rightarrow \\mathfrak{h}\\rightarrow\\mathfrak{g}\\rightarrow 0</math>\nof the Lie algebra by the module <math>M</math>.\n\nSimilarly, any element of the cohomology group <math>H^{n+1}(\\mathfrak{g}; M)</math> gives an equivalence class of ways to extend the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> to a \"Lie <math>n</math>-algebra\" with <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> in grade zero and <math>M</math> in grade <math>n</math>.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Baez|first1=John C.|last2=Crans|first2=Alissa S.|authorlink1=John C.

      "text": "{{Lie groups}}\nIn the theory of [[Lie groups]], [[Lie algebra]]s and their [[Lie algebra representation|representation theory]], a '''Lie algebra extension''' {{math|'''e'''}} is an enlargement of a given Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} by another Lie algebra {{math|'''h'''}}. Extensions arise in several ways. There is the '''trivial extension''' obtained by taking a direct sum of two Lie algebras. Other types are the '''split extension''' and the '''central extension'''. Extensions may arise naturally, for instance, when forming a Lie algebra from [[Projective representation|projective group representations]]. Such a Lie algebra will contain [[central charge]]s.\n\nStarting with a [[Loop algebra|polynomial loop algebra]] over finite-dimensional [[Simple Lie group|simple]] Lie algebra and performing two extensions, a central extension and an extension by a derivation, one obtains a Lie algebra which is isomorphic with an untwisted affine [[Kac–Moody algebra]]. Using the centrally extended loop algebra one may construct a [[current algebra]] in two spacetime dimensions. The [[Virasoro algebra]] is the universal central extension of the [[Witt algebra]].<ref name=\"Bauerle_de_Kerf_1997\"/>\n\nCentral extensions are needed in physics, because the symmetry group of a quantized system usually is a central extension of the classical symmetry group, and in the same way the corresponding symmetry Lie algebra of the quantum system is, in general, a central extension of the classical symmetry algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Schottenloher|2008|loc=Introduction}}</ref> Kac–Moody algebras have been conjectured to be symmetry groups of a unified superstring theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Dolan|1995}} [http://www.ams.org/notices/199512/index.html The Beacon of Kac–Moody Symmetry for Physics.

A parenthetical link, ([[#Background material|background material]]), is provided where it might be beneficial.\n\n==History==\nDue to the [[Lie correspondence]], the theory, and consequently the history of Lie algebra extensions, is tightly linked to the theory and history of group extensions. A systematic study of group extensions was performed by the Austrian mathematician [[Otto Schreier]] in 1923 in his PhD. thesis and later published.<ref group=nb>\n[[Otto Schreier]] (1901 - 1929) was a pioneer in the theory of [[group extension|extension of groups]]. Along with his rich research papers, his lecture notes were posthumously published (edited by [[Emanuel Sperner]]) under the name ''Einführung in die analytische Geometrie und Algebra'' (Vol I 1931, Vol II 1935), later in 1951 translated to English in [https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Modern-Algebra-Matrix-Theory/dp/0486482200 Introduction to Modern Algebra and Matrix Theory]. See {{harvnb|MacTutor|2015}} for further reference.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schrier|1926}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Schrier|1925}}</ref> The problem posed for his thesis  by [[Otto Hölder]] was \"given two groups {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}}, find all groups {{mvar|E}} having a normal subgroup {{mvar|N}} isomorphic to {{mvar|G}} such that the factor group {{math|''E''/''N''}} is isomorphic to {{mvar|H}}\".\n\nLie algebra extensions are most interesting and useful for infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. In 1967, [[Victor Kac]] and [[Robert Moody]] independently generalized the notion of classical Lie algebras, resulting in a new theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras, now called [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Kac|1967E}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Moody|1967}}</ref> They generalize the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras and can often concretely be constructed as extensions.<ref name=Baurle_de_Kerf_19>{{harvnb|Bäuerle|de Kerf|1997|loc=Chapter 19}}</ref>\n\n==Notation and proofs==\nNotational abuse to be found below includes {{math|''e''<sup>''X''</sup>}} for the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] {{math|exp}} given an argument, writing {{mvar|g}} for the element {{math|(''g'', ''e''<sub>''H''</sub>)}} in a direct product {{math|''G'' × ''H''}} ({{math|''e''<sub>''H''</sub>}} is the identity in {{mvar|H}}), and analogously for Lie algebra direct sums (where also {{math|''g'' + ''h''}} and {{math|(''g'', ''h'')}} are used interchangeably). Likewise for semidirect products and semidirect sums. Canonical injections (both for groups and Lie algebras) are used for implicit identifications. Furthermore, if {{math|''G''}}, {{math|''H''}}, ..., are groups, then the default names for elements of {{math|''G''}}, {{math|''H''}}, ..., are {{math|''g''}}, {{math|''h''}}, ..., and their Lie algebras are {{math|'''g'''}}, {{math|'''h'''}}, ... . The default names for elements of {{math|'''g'''}}, {{math|'''h'''}}, ..., are {{math|''G''}}, {{math|''H''}}, ... (just like for the groups!), partly to save scarce alphabetical resources but mostly to have a uniform notation.\n\nLie algebras that are ingredients in an extension will, without comment, be taken to be over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]].\n\nThe [[summation convention]] applies, including sometimes when the indices involved are both upstairs or both downstairs.\n\n'''Caveat:''' Not all proofs and proof outlines below have universal validity. The main reason is that the Lie algebras are often infinite-dimensional, and then there may or may not be a Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra. Moreover, even if such a group exists, it may not have the \"usual\" properties, e.g. the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] might not exist, and if it does, it might not have all the \"usual\" properties. In such cases, it is questionable whether the group should be endowed with the \"Lie\" qualifier. The literature is not uniform. For the explicit examples, the relevant structures are supposedly in place.\n\n==Definition==\nLie algebra extensions are formalized in terms of short [[exact sequence]]s.<ref name=Bauerle_de_Kerf_1997>{{harvnb|Bäuerle|de Kerf|1997}}</ref> A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of length three,\n{{NumBlk|\n:|<math>\n \\mathfrak h \\; \\overset i \\hookrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak e \\; \\overset s \\twoheadrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak g,\n</math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\nsuch that {{mvar|i}} is a [[monomorphism]], {{mvar|s}} is an [[epimorphism]], and {{math|ker ''s'' {{=}} im ''i''}}. From these properties of exact sequences, it follows that (the image of) {{math|'''h'''}} is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in {{math|'''e'''}}.

Here the zeros on the ends represent the zero Lie algebra (containing the [[null vector]] {{math|∅}} only) and the maps are the obvious ones; {{math|''ί''}} maps {{math|∅}} to {{math|∅}} and {{math|''σ''}} maps all elements of {{math|'''g'''}} to {{math|∅}}. With this definition, it follows automatically that {{math|''i''}} is a monomorphism and {{math|''s''}} is an epimorphism.\n\nAn extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|'''h'''}} is not necessarily unique. Let {{math|'''e''', '''e<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''}} denote two extensions and let the primes below have the obvious interpretation.

Suppose {{math|'''e'''}} is a central extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|'''h'''}}. Let {{math|''l''}} be a linear map from {{math|'''g'''}} to {{math|'''e'''}} with the property that {{math|''s'' ∘ ''l'' {{=}} Id<sub>'''g'''</sub>}}, i.e. {{math|''l''}} is a '''section''' of {{math|''s''}}. Use this section to define {{math|''ε'': '''g''' × '''g''' → '''e'''}} by\n:<math>\n\\epsilon(G_1, G_2) = l([G_1, G_2]) - [l(G_1), l(G_2)], \\quad G_1, G_2 \\in \\mathfrak g.\n</math>\n[[File:Lie algebra extension figure 2.svg|center|200px]]\nThe map {{math|''ε''}} satisfies\n:<math>\n\\epsilon(G_1, [G_2, G_3]) + \\epsilon(G_2, [G_3, G_1]) + \\epsilon(G_3, [G_1, G_2]) = 0 \\in \\mathfrak e.\n</math>\nTo see this, use the definition of {{math|''ε''}} on the left hand side, then use the linearity of {{math|''l''}}. Use Jacobi identity on {{math|'''g'''}} to get rid of half of the six terms. Use the definition of {{math|''ε''}} again on terms {{math|''l''[''G''<sub>''i''</sub>,''G''<sub>''j''</sub>]}} sitting inside three Lie brackets, bilinearity of Lie brackets, and the Jacobi identity on {{math|'''e'''}}, and then finally use on the three remaining terms that {{math|Im ''ε'' ⊂ ker ''s''}} and that {{math|ker ''s'' ⊂ ''Z''('''e''')}} so that {{math|''ε''(''G''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''G''<sub>''j''</sub>)}} brackets to zero with everything.\nIt then follows that {{math|''φ'' {{=}} ''i''<sup>−1</sup> ∘ ε}} satisfies the corresponding relation, and if {{math|'''h'''}} in addition is one-dimensional, then {{math|''φ''}} is a 2-cocycle on {{math|'''g'''}} (via a trivial correspondence of {{math|'''h'''}} with the underlying field).\n\nA central extension\n:<math>\n 0 \\; \\overset \\iota \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak h \\; \\overset i \\hookrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak e \\; \\overset s \\twoheadrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak g \\; \\overset \\sigma \\twoheadrightarrow \\; 0\n</math>\nis '''universal''' if for every other central extension\n:<math>\n 0 \\; \\overset \\iota \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak h' \\; \\overset {i'} \\hookrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak e' \\; \\overset {s'} \\twoheadrightarrow \\; \\mathfrak g \\; \\overset \\sigma \\twoheadrightarrow \\; 0\n</math>\nthere exist ''unique'' homomorphisms <math> \\Phi : \\mathfrak e  \\to  \\mathfrak e'</math> and <math> \\Psi : \\mathfrak h  \\to  \\mathfrak h'</math> such that the diagram\n[[File:Lie algebra extension figure 3.svg|center|400px]]\ncommutes, i.e. {{math|''i''<nowiki>'</nowiki> ∘ Ψ {{=}} Φ ∘ ''i''}} and {{math|''s''<nowiki>'</nowiki> ∘ Φ {{=}} ''s''}}. By universality, it is easy to conclude that such universal central extensions are unique up to isomorphism.\n\n==Construction==\n\n===By direct sum===\nLet {{math|'''g''', '''h'''}} be Lie algebras over the same field {{math|''K''}}. Define\n:<math>\\mathfrak e = \\mathfrak h \\times \\mathfrak g,</math>\nand define addition pointwise on {{math|'''e'''}}. Scalar multiplication is defined by\n:<math>\\alpha(H, G) = (\\alpha H, \\alpha G), \\alpha \\in F, H \\in \\mathfrak h, G \\in \\mathfrak g.</math>\nWith these definitions, {{math|'''h''' × '''g''' ≡ '''h''' ⊕ '''g'''}} is a vector space over {{mvar|F}}.

Define further\n:<math>i:\\mathfrak h \\hookrightarrow \\mathfrak e; H \\mapsto (H, 0), \\quad s:\\mathfrak e \\twoheadrightarrow \\mathfrak g; (H, G) \\mapsto G.</math>\nIt is clear that {{EquationNote|(1)}} holds as an exact sequence. This extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|'''h'''}} is called a '''trivial extension'''. It is, of course, nothing else than the Lie algebra direct sum. By symmetry of definitions, {{math|'''e'''}} is an extension of {{math|'''h'''}} by {{math|'''g'''}} as well, but {{math|'''h''' ⊕ '''g''' ≠ '''g''' ⊕ '''h'''}}. It is clear from {{EquationNote|(3)}} that the subalgebra {{math|0 ⊕ '''g'''}} is an [[ideal (Lie algebra)]]. This property of the direct sum of Lie algebras is promoted to the definition of a trivial extension.\n\n===By semidirect sum===\nInspired by the construction of a semidirect product ([[#Semidirect product (groups)|background]]) of groups using a homomorphism {{math|''G'' → Aut(''H'')}}, one can make the corresponding construct for Lie algebras.\n\nIf {{math|''ψ'':'''g''' → der '''h'''}} is a Lie algebra homomorphism, then define a Lie bracket on {{math|'''e''' {{=}} '''h''' ⊕ '''g'''}} by\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>[(H , G), (H' , G')] = ([H , H']  + \\psi_G(H') - \\psi_{G'}(H), [G , G']),\\quad H,H' \\in \\mathfrak h, G, G' \\in \\mathfrak g.</math>|{{EquationRef|7}}}}\nWith this Lie bracket, the Lie algebra so obtained is denoted {{math|'''e'''{{=}} '''h''' ⊕<sub>S</sub> '''g'''}} and is called the '''semidirect sum''' of {{math|'''h'''}} and {{math|'''g'''}}.\n\nBy inspection of {{EquationNote|(7)}} one sees that {{math|0 ⊕ '''g'''}} is a subalgebra of {{math|'''e'''}} and {{math|'''h''' ⊕ 0}} is an ideal in {{math|'''e'''}}. Define {{math|''i'':'''h''' → '''e'''}} by {{math|''H'' ↦ ''H'' ⊕ 0}} and {{math|''s'':'''e''' → '''g'''}} by {{math|''H'' ⊕ ''G'' ↦ ''G'', ''H'' ∈ '''h''', ''G'' ∈ '''g'''}}. It is clear that {{math|ker ''s'' {{=}} im ''i''}}. Thus {{math|'''e'''}} is a Lie algebra extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|'''h'''}}.\n\nAs with the trivial extension, this property generalizes to the definition of a split extension.\n\n'''Example'''<br />\nLet {{mvar|G}} be the [[Lorentz group]] {{math|O(3, 1)}} and let {{math|T}} denote the [[translation group]] in 4 dimensions, isomorphic to {{math|(ℝ<sup>4</sup>, +)}}, and consider the multiplication rule of the [[Poincaré group]] {{math|P}}\n:<math>(a_2, \\Lambda_2)(a_1, \\Lambda_1) = (a_2 + \\Lambda_2a_1, \\Lambda_2\\Lambda_1), \\quad a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathrm T \\subset P, \\Lambda_1, \\Lambda_2 \\in \\mathrm O(3,1) \\subset \\mathrm P,</math>\n(where {{math|T}} and {{math|SO(3, 1)}} are identified with their images in {{math|P}}). From it follows immediately that, in the Poincaré group, {{math|(0, Λ)(''a'', ''I'')(0, Λ<sup>−1</sup>) {{=}} (Λ ''a'', ''I'') ∈ T ⊂ P}}. Thus every Lorentz transformation {{math|Λ}} corresponds to an automorphism {{math|Φ<sub>Λ</sub>}} of {{math|T}} with inverse {{math|Φ<sub>Λ<sup>−1</sup></sub>}} and {{math|Φ}} is clearly a homomorphism. Now define\n:<math>\\overline \\mathrm P = \\mathrm T \\otimes_S \\mathrm O(3, 1),</math>\nendowed with multiplication given by {{EquationNote|(4)}}. Unwinding the definitions one finds that the multiplication is the same as the multiplication one started with and it follows that {{math|{{overline|P}} {{=}} P}}. From {{EquationNote|(5')}} follows that {{math|Ψ<sub>Λ</sub> {{=}} Ad<sub>Λ</sub>}} and then from {{EquationNote|(6')}} it follows that {{math|''ψ''<sub>''λ''</sub> {{=}} ad<sub>''λ''</sub>. ''λ'' ∈ '''o'''(3, 1)}}.\n\n===By derivation===\nLet {{math|''δ''}} be a derivation ([[#Derivations|background]]) of {{math|'''h'''}} and denote by {{math|'''g'''}} the one-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by {{math|''δ''}}. Define the Lie bracket on {{math|'''e''' {{=}} '''g''' ⊕ '''h'''}} by<ref group=nb>To show that the [[Jacobi identity]] holds, one writes everything out, uses the fact that the underlying Lie algebras have a Lie product satisfying the Jacobi identity, and that {{math|''δ''[''X'', ''Y''] {{=}} [''δ''(''X''), ''Y''] + [''X'', ''δ''(''Y'')]}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Bäuerle|de Kerf|ten Kroode|1997|loc=Example 18.1.9}}</ref>\n\n:<math>[G_1 + H_1, G_2 + H_2] = [\\lambda\\delta + H_1, \\mu\\delta + H_2] = [H_1, H_2] + \\lambda \\delta(H_1) - \\mu \\delta(H_2).</math>\n\nIt is obvious from the definition of the bracket that {{math|'''h'''}} is and ideal in {{math|'''e'''}} in and that {{math|'''g'''}} is a subalgebra of {{math|'''e'''}}. Furthermore, {{math|'''g'''}} is complementary to {{math|'''h'''}} in {{math|'''e'''}}. Let {{math|''i'':'''h''' → '''e'''}} be given by {{math|''H'' ↦ (0, ''H'')}} and {{math|''s'':'''e''' → '''g'''}} by {{math|(''G'', ''H'') ↦ ''G''}}. It is clear that {{math|im ''i'' {{=}} ker ''s''}}. Thus {{math|'''e'''}} is a split extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|'''h'''}}. Such an extension is called '''extension by a derivation'''.\n\nIf {{math|''ψ'': '''g''' → der '''h'''}} is defined by {{math|''ψ''(''μδ'')(''H'') {{=}} ''μδ''(''H'')}}, then {{mvar|ψ}} is a Lie algebra homomorphism into {{math|der '''h'''}}. Hence this construction is a special case of a semidirect sum, for when starting from {{mvar|ψ}} and using the construction in the preceding section, the same Lie brackets result.\n\n===By 2-cocycle===\nIf {{math|''ε''}} is a 2-cocycle ([[#Cohomology|background]]) on a Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} and {{math|'''h'''}} is any one-dimensional vector space, let {{math|'''e''' {{=}} '''h''' ⊕  '''g'''}} (vector space direct sum) and define a Lie bracket on {{math|'''e'''}} by\n:<math>\n[\\mu H + G_1, \\nu H + G_2] = [G_1, G_2] + \\epsilon(G1, G2)H, \\quad \\mu, \\nu \\in F.\n</math>\n\nHere {{mvar|H}} is an arbitrary but fixed element of {{math|'''h'''}}. Antisymmetry follows from antisymmetry of the Lie bracket on {{math|'''g'''}} and antisymmetry of the 2-cocycle. The Jacobi identity follows from the corresponding properties of {{math|'''g'''}} and of {{math|''ε''}}. Thus {{math|'''e'''}} is a Lie algebra. Put {{math|''G''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} 0}} and it follows that {{math|''μH'' ∈ ''Z''('''e''')}}. Also, it follows with {{math|''i'': ''μH'' ↦ (''μH'', 0)}} and {{math|''s'': (''μH'', ''G'') ↦ ''G''}} that {{math|Im ''i'' {{=}} ker ''s'' {{=}} <nowiki>{</nowiki>(''μH'', 0):''μ'' ∈ ''F''<nowiki>}</nowiki> ⊂ Z('''e''')}}. Hence {{math|'''e'''}} is a central extension of {{math|'''g'''}} by {{math|''h''}}. It is called '''extension by a 2-cocycle'''.\n\n==Theorems==\nBelow follows some results regarding central extensions and 2-cocycles.<ref>{{harvnb|Bäurle|de Kerf|1990|loc=Chapter 18}}</ref>\n\n'''Theorem'''<ref name=Bauerle_de_Kerf_1997/><br />\nLet {{math|''φ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''φ''<sub>2</sub>}} be cohomologous 2-cocycles on a Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} and let {{math|'''e'''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|'''e'''<sub>2</sub>}} be respectively the central extensions constructed with these 2-cocycles.

Suppose {{math|''φ''}} is a 2-cocycle on {{math|'''g'''}}. The task is to use this 2-cocycle to manufacture a 1-cochain {{mvar|f}} such that {{math|''φ'' {{=}} ''δf''}}.\n\nThe first step is to for each {{math|''G''<sub>''G''<sub>1</sub></sub> ∈ '''g'''}} use {{mvar|φ}} to define a linear map {{math|''ρ''<sub>''G''<sub>1</sub></sub>:'''g''' → ''F''}}. But the linear maps are elements of {{math|'''g'''<sup>∗</sup>}}. This suffices to express {{mvar|φ}} in terms of {{math|''K''}}, using the isomorphism {{mvar|ν}}. Next, a linear map {{math|''d'':'''g''' → '''g'''}} is defined that turns out to be a derivation. Since all derivations are inner, one has {{math|''d'' {{=}} ad<sub>''G''<sub>''d''</sub></sub>}} for some {{math|''G''<sub>''d''</sub> ∈ '''g'''}}. An expression for {{mvar|φ}} in terms of {{math|''K''}} and {{math|''d''}} is obtained.

The answer is, by [[Lie's third theorem]] affirmative. But is there a ''central extension'' {{math|''E''}} of {{math|''G''}} with Lie algebra {{math|'''e'''}}? The answer to this question requires some machinery, and can be found in {{harvtxt|Tuynman|Wiegerinck|1987|loc=Theorem 5.4}}.\n\n==Applications==\nThe \"negative\" result of the preceding theorem indicates that one must, at least for semisimple Lie algebras, go to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras to find useful applications of central extensions. There are indeed such. Here will be presented affine Kac–Moody algebras and Virasoro algebras. These are extensions of polynomial loop-algebras and the Witt algebra respectively.\n\n===Polynomial loop-algebra===\nLet {{math|'''g'''}} be a polynomial loop algebra ([[#Loop algebra|background]]),\n:<math>\\mathfrak g = C[\\lambda, \\lambda^{-1}] \\otimes \\mathfrak g_0,</math>\nwhere {{math|'''g'''<sub>0</sub>}} is a complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. The goal is to find a central extension of this algebra. Two of the theorems apply. On the one hand, if there is a 2-cocycle on {{math|'''g'''}}, then a central extension may be defined. On the other hand, if this 2-cocycle is acting on the {{math|'''g'''<sub>0</sub>}} part (only), then the resulting extension is trivial. Moreover, derivations acting on {{math|'''g'''<sub>0</sub>}} (only) cannot be used for definition of a 2-cocycle either because these derivations are all inner and the same problem results. One therefore looks for derivations on {{math|''C''[''λ'', ''λ''<sup>−1</sup>]}}. One such set of derivations is \n:<math>d_k \\equiv \\lambda^{k+1}\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}, \\quad k \\in \\mathbb Z.</math>\n\nIn order to manufacture a non-degenerate bilinear associative antisymmetric form {{math|''L''}} on {{math|'''g'''}}, attention is focused first on restrictions on the arguments, with {{math|''m'', ''n''}} fixed. It is a theorem that ''every'' form satisfying the requirements is a multiple of the Killing form {{mvar|K}} on {{math|'''g'''<sub>0</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Bäurle|de Kerf|1997}} Corollary 22.2.9.</ref> This requires\n:<math>L(\\lambda^l \\otimes G_1, \\lambda^m \\otimes G_2) = \\gamma_{lm}K(G_1, G_2).</math>\nSymmetry of {{mvar|K}} implies\n:<math>\\gamma_{mn}=\\gamma_{nm},</math>\nand associativity yields\n:<math>\\gamma_{k+l,m}=\\gamma_{k,l+m}.</math>\nWith {{math|''l'' {{=}} 0}} one sees that {{math|''γ''<sub>''lm''</sub> {{=}} ''γ''<sub>0,''l''+''m''</sub>}}. This last condition implies the former. Using this fact, define {{math|''f''(''n'') {{=}} ''γ''<sub>0,''n''</sub>}}.

This roughly amounts to taking the position and the momentum of the string and promoting them to operators on the space of states of open strings. Since strings are extended objects, this results in a continuum of operators depending on the parameter {{mvar|σ}}.

These are calculated to satisfy\n:<math>[\\alpha_m^I, \\alpha_n^J] = m\\eta^{IJ}\\delta_{m+n,0}</math>\nThey are interpreted as [[creation and annihilation operators]] acting on Hilbert space, increasing or decreasing the quantum of their respective modes. If the index is negative, the operator is a creation operator, otherwise it is an annihilation operator. (If it is zero, it is proportional to the total momentum operator.) In view of the fact that the light cone plus and minus modes were expressed in terms of the transverse Virasoro modes, one must consider the commutation relations between the Virasoro operators. These were classically defined (then modes) as\n:<math>L_n = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{p \\in \\mathbb Z}\\alpha_{n-p}^I\\alpha_p^I.</math>\n\nSince, in the quantized theory, the alphas are operators, the ordering of the factors matter.

Moreover, the Virasoro operators enter into the definition of the Lorentz generators of the theory. It is perhaps the most important algebra in string theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Zwiebach|2004|p=227}}</ref> The consistency of the Lorentz generators, by the way, fixes the spacetime dimensionality to 26. While this theory presented here (for relative simplicity of exposition) is unphysical, or at the very least incomplete (it has, for instance, no fermions) the Virasoro algebra arises in the same way in the more viable [[superstring theory]] and [[M-theory]].\n\n===Group extension===\n{{main|Group extension}}\nA projective representation {{math|Π(''G'')}} of a Lie group {{mvar|''G''}} ([[#Projective representation|background]]) can be used to define a so-called [[group extension]] {{math|''G''<sub>ex</sub>}}.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, [[Wigner's theorem]] asserts that if {{math|''G''}} is a symmetry group, then it will be represented projectively on Hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operators.

The linear map {{math|''δ'':''C''<sup>1</sup>('''g''', ''F'') → ''Z''<sup>2</sup>('''g''', ''F'')}} is called the '''coboundary operator''' (here restricted to {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>('''g''', ''F'')}}).\n\n'''The second cohomology group'''<br>\nDenote the image of {{math|''C''<sup>1</sup>('''g''', ''F'')}} of {{mvar|δ}} by {{math|''B''<sup>2</sup>('''g''', ''F'')}}.

For this, see the main articles.\n\n===Structure constants===\n{{main|Structure constants}}\nLet {{math|''B''}} be a [[Hamel basis]] for {{math|'''g'''}}. Then each {{math|''G'' ∈ '''g'''}} has a unique expression as\n:<math>G = \\sum_{\\alpha \\in A}c_\\alpha G_\\alpha, \\quad c_\\alpha \\in F, G_\\alpha \\in B</math>\nfor some indexing set {{mvar|A}} of suitable size. In this expansion, only finitely many {{math|''c''<sub>''α''</sub>}} are nonzero. In the sequel it is (for simplicity) assumed that the basis is countable, and Latin letters are used for the indices and the indexing set can be taken to be {{math|ℕ<sup>∗</sup> {{=}} 1, 2, ...}}. One immediately has\n:<math>[G_i, G_j] = {C_{ij}}^k G_k</math>\nfor the basis elements, where the summation symbol has been rationalized away, the summation convention applies. The placement of the indices in the structure constants (up or down) is immaterial. The following theorem is useful:\n\n'''Theorem''':There is a basis such that the structure constants are antisymmetric in all indices if and only if the Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple compact Lie algebras and {{math|'''u'''(1)}} Lie algebras. This is the case if and only if there is a real positive definite metric {{mvar|''g''}} on {{math|'''g'''}} satisfying the invariance condition\n:<math>g_{\\alpha\\beta}{C^\\beta}_{\\gamma\\delta}=-g_{\\gamma\\beta}{C^\\beta}_{\\alpha\\delta}.</math>\nin any basis. This last condition is necessary on physical grounds for non-Abelian [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] in [[quantum field theory]]. Thus one can produce an infinite list of possible gauge theories using the Cartan catalog of simple Lie algebras on their compact form (i.e., {{math|'''sl'''(''n'', ℂ) → '''su'''(''n'')}}, etc. One such gauge theory is the {{math|U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3)}} gauge theory of the [[standard model]] with Lie algebra {{math|'''u'''(1) ⊕ '''su'''(2) ⊕ '''su'''(3)}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1996|loc=Appendix A, Ch 15.}}</ref>\n\n===Killing form===\n{{main|Killing form}}\nThe '''Killing form''' is a symmetric bilinear form on {{math|'''g'''}} defined by\n:<math>K(G_1, G_2) = \\mathrm{trace} (\\mathrm{ad}_{G_1}\\mathrm{ad}_{G_2}).</math>\nHere {{math|ad<sub>''G''</sub>}} is viewed as a matrix operating on the vector space {{math|'''g'''}}. The key fact needed is that if {{math|'''g'''}} is [[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]], then, by [[Cartan's criterion]], {{mvar|K}} is non-degenerate. In such a case {{mvar|K}} may be used to identify {{math|'''g'''}} and {{math|'''g'''<sup>∗</sup>}}. If {{math|''λ'' ∈ '''g'''<sup>∗</sup>}}, then there is a {{math|''ν''(''λ'') {{=}} ''G''<sub>''λ''</sub> ∈ '''g'''}} such that\n:<math>\\langle \\lambda, G \\rangle = K(G_\\lambda, G) \\quad \\forall G \\in \\mathfrak g.</math>\nThis is resembling [[Riesz representation theorem]] and the proof is virtually the same. The Killing form has the property\n:<math>K([G_1, G_2], G_3) = K(G_1, [G_2, G_3]), </math>\nwhich is referred to as associativity. By defining {{math|''g''<sub>''αβ''</sub> {{=}} ''K''[''G''<sub>''α''</sub>,''G''<sub>''β''</sub>]}} and expanding the inner brackets in terms of structure constants, one finds that the Killing form satisfies the invariance condition of above.\n\n===Loop algebra===\n{{main|Loop algebra|Loop group}}\nA [[loop group]] is taken as a group of smooth maps from the unit circle {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}} into a Lie group {{math|''G''}} with the group structure defined by the group structure on {{math|''G''}}. The Lie algebra of a loop group is then a vector space of mappings from {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}} into the Lie algebra {{math|'''g'''}} of {{math|''G''}}. Any subalgebra of such a Lie algebra is referred to as a '''loop algebra'''. Attention here is focused on '''polynomial loop algebras''' of the form\n:<math>\\{h: S^1 \\to \\mathfrak g|h(\\lambda) = \\sum \\lambda^n G_n, n \\in \\mathbb Z, \\lambda = e^{i\\theta} \\in S^1, G_n \\in \\mathfrak g\\}.</math>\n\n{{Hidden begin| titlestyle = color:green;background:lightgrey;|title='''Derivation of the Lie algebra'''}}\nTo see this, consider elements {{math|''H''(''λ'')}} near the identity in {{math|''G''}} for {{math|''H''}} in the loop group, expressed in a basis {{math|{G_k<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} for {{math|'''g'''}}\n:<math>\nH(\\lambda) = e^{h^k(\\lambda)G_k} = e_G + h^k(\\lambda)G_k + \\ldots ,\n</math>\nwhere the {{math|''h''<sup>''k''</sup>(''λ'')}} are real and small and the implicit sum is over the dimension {{math|''K''}} of {{math|'''g'''}}.\nNow write\n:<math>\nh^k(\\lambda) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\theta^k_{-n}\\lambda^n\n</math>\nto obtain\n:<math>\ne^{h^k(\\lambda)G_k} = 1_G + \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\theta^k_{-n}\\lambda^nG_k + \\ldots .\n</math>\nThus the functions\n:<math>\nh:S^1 \\to \\mathfrak g; h(\\lambda) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\sum_{k=1}^K\\theta^k_{-n}\\lambda^nG_k \\equiv \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty \\lambda^nG_n\n</math>\nconstitute the Lie algebra.\n{{Hidden end}}\n\nA little thought confirms that these are loops in {{math|'''g'''}} as {{mvar|θ}} goes from {{math|0}} to {{math|2''π''}}. The operations are the ones defined pointwise by the operations in {{math|'''g'''}}. This algebra is isomorphic with the algebra\n:<math>C[\\lambda, \\lambda^{-1}] \\otimes \\mathfrak g,</math>\nwhere {{math|C[''λ'', ''λ''<sup>−1</sup>]}} is the algebra of [[Laurent polynomial]]s,\n:<math>\\sum \\lambda^k G_k \\leftrightarrow \\sum \\lambda^k \\otimes G_k.</math>\nThe Lie bracket is\n:<math>[P(\\lambda) \\otimes G_1, Q(\\lambda) \\otimes G_2] = P(\\lambda)Q(\\lambda) \\otimes [G_1, G_2].</math>\nIn this latter view the elements can be considered as polynomials with (constant!) coefficients in {{math|'''g'''}}. In terms of a basis and structure constants,\n:<math>[\\lambda^m \\otimes G_i, \\lambda^n \\otimes G_j] = {C_{ij}}^k\\lambda^{m+n} \\otimes G_k.</math>\n\nIt is also common to have a different notation,\n:<math>\\lambda^m \\otimes G_i \\cong \\lambda^mG_i \\leftrightarrow T^m_i(\\lambda) \\equiv T^m_i,</math>\nwhere the omission of {{mvar|λ}} should be kept in mind to avoid confusion; the elements really are functions {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup> → '''g'''}}. The Lie bracket is then\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent = \n|title= \n|equation = :<math>[T^m_i, T^n_j] = {C_{ij}}^kT^{m+n}_k,</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|bgcolor=#F9FFF7}}\nwhich is recognizable as one of the commutation relations in an untwisted affine Kac–Moody algebra, to be introduced later, ''without'' the central term. With {{math|''m'' {{=}} ''n'' {{=}} 0}}, a subalgebra isomorphic to {{math|'''g'''}} is obtained. It generates (as seen by tracing backwards in the definitions) the set of constant maps from {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}} into {{mvar|G}}, which is obviously isomorphic with {{math|''G''}} when {{math|exp}} is onto (which is the case when {{mvar|G}} is compact. If {{math|''G''}} is compact, then a basis {{math|(''G''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} for {{math|'''g'''}} may be chosen such that the {{math|''G''<sub>''k''</sub>}} are skew-Hermitian. As a consequence, \n:<math>T_i^{n\\dagger} = (\\lambda^nG_i)^{\\dagger} = -\\lambda^{-n}G_i = -T_i^{-n}.</math>\nSuch a representation is called unitary because the representatives\n:<math>H(\\lambda) = e^{\\theta_{n}^k T_k^{-n}} \\in G</math>\nare unitary. Here, the minus on the lower index of {{mvar|T}} is conventional, the summation convention applies, and the {{mvar|λ}} is (by the definition) buried in the {{math|''T''}}s in the right hand side.\n\n===Current algebra (physics)===\nCurrent algebras arise in quantum field theories as a consequence of global [[gauge symmetry]]. [[Conserved current]]s occur in [[classical field theory|classical field theories]] whenever the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] respects a [[continuous symmetry]]. This is the content of [[Noether's theorem]]. Most (perhaps all) modern quantum field theories can be formulated in terns of classical Lagrangians (prior to quantization), so Noether's theorem applies in the quantum case as well. Upon quantization, the conserved currents are promoted to position dependent operators on Hilbert space. These operators are subject to commutation relations, generally forming an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra.

Such forms have important applications in the theory of [[connection (principal bundle)|connections]] on a [[principal bundle]] as well as in the theory of [[Cartan connection]]s.\n\n== Formal Definition ==\n\nA Lie algebra-valued differential ''k''-form on a manifold, <math>M</math>, is a smooth [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] of the [[fibre bundle|bundle]] <math> (\\mathfrak{g} \\times M) \\otimes \\wedge^k T^*M</math>, where <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a [[Lie algebra]], <math>T^*M</math> is the [[cotangent bundle]] of <math>M</math> and Λ<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the ''k''<sup>th</sup> [[Exterior algebra|exterior power]].\n\n== Wedge product ==\n\nSince every Lie algebra has a bilinear [[Lie_algebra#Definition_of_a_Lie_algebra|Lie bracket operation]], the wedge product of two Lie algebra-valued forms can be composed with the bracket operation to obtain another Lie algebra-valued form. This operation, denoted by <math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta]</math>, is given by: for <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued ''p''-form <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued ''q''-form <math>\\eta</math>\n:<math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta](v_1, \\cdots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \\over (p + q)!}\\sum_{\\sigma} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) [\\omega(v_{\\sigma(1)}, \\cdots, v_{\\sigma(p)}), \\eta(v_{\\sigma(p+1)}, \\cdots, v_{\\sigma(p+q)})]</math>\nwhere ''v''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are tangent vectors. The notation is meant to indicate both operations involved. For example, if <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\eta</math> are Lie algebra-valued one forms, then one has\n:<math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta](v_1,v_2) = {1 \\over 2} ([\\omega(v_1),\\eta(v_2)] - [\\omega(v_2),\\eta(v_1)]).</math>\n<!-- With this operation the set of all Lie algebra-valued forms on a manifold ''M'' becomes a [[graded Lie superalgebra]].-->\n\nThe operation <math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta]</math> can also be defined as the bilinear operation on <math>\\Omega(M, \\mathfrak{g})</math> satisfying\n:<math>[(g \\otimes \\alpha) \\wedge (h \\otimes \\beta)] = [g, h] \\otimes (\\alpha \\wedge \\beta)</math>\nfor all <math>g, h \\in \\mathfrak{g}</math> and <math>\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\Omega(M, \\mathbb R)</math>.\n\nSome authors have used the notation <math>[\\omega, \\eta]</math> instead of <math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta]</math>. The notation <math>[\\omega, \\eta]</math>, which resembles a [[Commutator#Ring theory|commutator]], is justified by the fact that if the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is a matrix algebra then <math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta]</math> is nothing but the [[graded commutator]] of <math>\\omega</math> and <math>\\eta</math>, i. e. if <math>\\omega \\in \\Omega^p(M, \\mathfrak g)</math> and <math>\\eta \\in \\Omega^q(M, \\mathfrak g)</math> then\n:<math>[\\omega\\wedge\\eta] = \\omega\\wedge\\eta - (-1)^{pq}\\eta\\wedge\\omega,</math>\nwhere <math>\\omega \\wedge \\eta,\\ \\eta \\wedge \\omega \\in \\Omega^{p+q}(M, \\mathfrak g)</math> are wedge products formed using the matrix multiplication on <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.\n\n== Operations ==\nLet <math>f: \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{h}</math> be a [[Lie algebra homomorphism]]. If φ is a <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued form on a manifold, then ''f''(φ) is an <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>-valued form on the same manifold obtained by applying ''f'' to the values of φ: <math>f(\\varphi)(v_1, \\dots, v_k) = f(\\varphi(v_1, \\dots, v_k))</math>.\n\nSimilarly, if ''f'' is a multilinear functional on <math>\\textstyle \\prod_1^k \\mathfrak{g}</math>, then one puts<ref>{{harvnb|Kobayashi–Nomizu|loc=Ch. XII, § 1.}}</ref>\n:<math>f(\\varphi_1, \\dots, \\varphi_k)(v_1, \\dots, v_q) = {1 \\over q!} \\sum_{\\sigma} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) f(\\varphi_1(v_{\\sigma(1)}, \\dots, v_{\\sigma(q_1)}), \\dots, \\varphi_k(v_{\\sigma(q - q_k + 1)}, \\dots, v_{\\sigma(q)}))</math>\nwhere ''q'' = ''q''<sub>1</sub> + … + ''q''<sub>''k''</sub> and φ<sub>''i''</sub> are <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued ''q''<sub>''i''</sub>-forms. Moreover, given a vector space ''V'', the same formula can be used to define the ''V''-valued form <math>f(\\varphi, \\eta)</math> when\n:<math>f: \\mathfrak{g} \\times V \\to V</math>\nis a multilinear map, φ is a <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued form and η is a ''V''-valued form. Note that, when\n:(*) ''f''([''x'', ''y''], ''z'') = ''f''(''x'', ''f''(''y'', ''z'')) - ''f''(''y'', ''f''(''x'', ''z'')),\ngiving ''f'' amounts to giving an action of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on ''V''; i.e., ''f'' determines the representation\n:<math>\\rho: \\mathfrak{g} \\to V, \\rho(x)y = f(x, y)</math>\nand, conversely, any representation ρ determines ''f'' with the condition (*). For example, if <math>f(x, y) = [x, y]</math> (the bracket of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>), then we recover the definition of <math>[\\cdot \\wedge \\cdot]</math> given above, with ρ = ad, the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]]. (Note the relation between ''f'' and ρ above is thus like the relation between a bracket and ad.) \n\nIn general, if ''α'' is a <math>\\mathfrak{gl}(V)</math>-valued ''p''-form and φ is a ''V''-valued ''q''-form, then one more commonly writes α⋅φ = ''f''(α, φ) when {{nowrap|''f''(''T'', ''x'') <nowiki>=</nowiki> ''T''<nowiki></nowiki>''x''.}} Explicitly,\n:<math>(\\alpha \\cdot \\phi)(v_1, \\dots, v_{p+q}) = {1 \\over (p+q)!} \\sum_{\\sigma} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) \\alpha(v_{\\sigma(1)}, \\dots, v_{\\sigma(p)}) \\phi(v_{\\sigma(p+1)}, \\dots, v_{\\sigma(p+q)}).</math>\nWith this notation, one has for example:\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}(\\alpha) \\cdot \\phi = [\\alpha \\wedge \\phi]</math>.\n\nExample: If ω is a <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-valued one-form (for example, a [[connection form]]), ρ a representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on a vector space ''V'' and φ a ''V''-valued zero-form, then\n:<math>\\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega]) \\cdot \\varphi = 2 \\rho(\\omega) \\cdot (\\rho(\\omega) \\cdot \\varphi).</math><ref>Since <math>\\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega])(v, w) = \\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega](v, w)) = \\rho([\\omega(v), \\omega(w)]) = \\rho(\\omega(v))\\rho(\\omega(w)) - \\rho(\\omega(w))\\rho(\\omega(v))</math>, we have that\n:<math>(\\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega]) \\cdot \\phi)(v, w) = {1 \\over 2} (\\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega])(v, w) \\phi - \\rho([\\omega \\wedge \\omega])(w, v) \\phi)</math>\nis <math>\\rho(\\omega(v))\\rho(\\omega(w))\\phi - \\rho(\\omega(w))\\rho(\\omega(v))\\phi = 2(\\rho(\\omega) \\cdot (\\rho(\\omega) \\cdot \\phi))(v, w).</math></ref>\n\n== Forms with values in an adjoint bundle ==\n{{see also|adjoint bundle}}\nLet ''P'' be a smooth principal bundle with structure group ''G'' and <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math>.

For example, the Lie algebroid <math>TM</math> comes from the pair groupoid whose objects are <math>M</math>, with one isomorphism between each pair of objects. Unfortunately, going back from a Lie algebroid to a Lie groupoid is not always possible,<ref>Marius Crainic, Rui L. Fernandes.

The anchor map is given by the Poisson bivector. This can be seen in a [[Lie bialgebroid]].\n\n== Lie algebroid associated to a Lie groupoid ==\nTo describe the construction let us fix some notation.  ''G'' is the space of morphisms of the Lie groupoid, ''M'' the space of objects, <math>e:M\\to G</math> the units and <math>t:G\\to M</math> the target map.\n\n<math>T^tG=\\bigcup_{p\\in M}T(t^{-1}(p))\\subset TG</math> the ''t''-fiber tangent space.  The Lie algebroid is now the vector bundle <math>A:=e^*T^tG</math>.  This inherits a bracket from ''G'', because we can identify the ''M''-sections into ''A'' with left-invariant vector fields on ''G''.  The anchor map then is obtained as the derivation of the source map\n<math>Ts:e^*T^tG \\rightarrow TM </math>. Further these sections act on the smooth functions of ''M'' by identifying these with left-invariant functions on ''G''.\n\nAs a more explicit example consider the Lie algebroid associated to the pair groupoid <math>G:=M\\times M</math>.  The target map is <math>t:G\\to M: (p,q)\\mapsto p</math> and the units <math>e:M\\to G: p\\mapsto (p,p)</math>.  The ''t''-fibers are <math>p\\times M</math> and therefore <math>T^tG=\\bigcup_{p\\in M}p\\times TM \\subset TM\\times TM</math>.  So the Lie algebroid is the vector bundle <math>A:=e^*T^tG=\\bigcup_{p\\in M} T_pM=TM</math>.  The extension of sections ''X'' into ''A'' to left-invariant vector fields on ''G'' is simply <math>\\tilde X(p,q)=0\\oplus X(q)</math> and the extension of a smooth function ''f'' from ''M'' to a left-invariant function on ''G'' is <math>\\tilde f(p,q)=f(q)</math>.  Therefore, the bracket on ''A'' is just the Lie bracket of tangent vector fields and the anchor map is just the identity.\n\nOf course you could do an analog construction with the source map and right-invariant vector fields/ functions.

Further, there is a pairing between vector fields and differential forms.\n\nHowever, the situation is subtler: the Lie bracket is not linear over the algebra of smooth functions <math>C^\\infty(M)</math> (the error is the [[Lie derivative]]), nor is the [[exterior derivative]]: <math>d(fg) = (df)g + f(dg) \\neq f(dg)</math> (it is a derivation, not linear over functions): they are not [[tensor]]s.

In this article, a Lie group refers to a real Lie group. For the complex and ''p''-adic cases, see [[complex Lie group]] and [[p-adic Lie group|''p''-adic Lie group]].\n\nIn this article, manifolds (in particular Lie groups) are assumed to be [[second countable]]; in particular, they have at most countably many connected components.\n\n== Basics ==\n===The Lie algebra of a Lie group===\nThere are various ways one can understand the construction of the [[Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group|Lie algebra of a Lie group]] ''G''. One approach uses left-invariant vector fields. A [[vector field#Vector_fields_on_manifolds|vector field]] ''X'' on ''G'' is said to be invariant under left translations if, for any ''g'', ''h'' in ''G'',\n:<math>(dl_g)_h(X_h) = X_{gh}</math>\nwhere <math>l_g: G \\to G, x \\mapsto gx</math> and <math>(dl_g)_h: T_h G \\to T_{gh} G</math> is the [[differential (mathematics)|differential]] of <math>l_g</math> between [[tangent space]]s. (In other words, it is [[f-related|<math>l_g</math>-related]] to itself for any ''g'' in ''G''.)\n\nLet <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> be the set of all left-translation-invariant vector fields on ''G''. It is a real vector space. Moreover, it is closed under [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]]; i.e., <math>[X, Y]</math> is left-translation-invariant if ''X'', ''Y'' are. Thus, <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is a Lie subalgebra of \nthe Lie algebra of all vector fields on ''G'' and is called the Lie algebra of ''G''. One can understand this more concretely by identifying the space of left-invariant vector fields with the tangent space at the identity, as follows: Given a left-invariant vector field, one can take its value at the identity, and given a tangent vector at the identity, one can extend it to a left-invariant vector field. Thus, the Lie algebra can be thought of as the tangent space at the identity and the bracket of ''X'' and ''Y'' in <math>T_e G</math> can be computed by extending them to left-invariant vector fields, taking the commutator of the vector fields, and then evaluating at the identity.\n\nThere is also another incarnation of <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> as the Lie algebra of primitive elements of the Hopf algebra of distributions on ''G'' with support at the identity element; for this, see [[#Related constructions]] below.\n\n===Matrix Lie groups===\nSuppose ''G'' is a closed subgroup of GL(n;'''C'''), and thus a Lie group, by the [[Closed_subgroup_theorem|closed subgroups theorem]]. Then the Lie algebra of ''G'' may be computed as\n:<math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G) = \\{ X \\in M(n;\\mathbb{C}) | \\operatorname{exp}(tX) \\in G \\text{ for all } t \\text{ in } \\mathbb{\\mathbb{R}} \\}.</math><ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|loc=Ch.

Also, if ''f'' is injective, then ''f'' is an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersion]] and so ''G'' is said to be an immersed (Lie) subgroup of ''H''. For example, <math>G/\\operatorname{ker}(f)</math> is an immersed subgroup of ''H''. If ''f'' is surjective, then ''f'' is a [[submersion (mathematics)|submersion]] and if, in addition, ''G'' is compact, then ''f'' is a [[principal bundle]] with the structure group its kernel.

If ''H'' is a Lie group, then any Lie group homomorphism <math>f: G \\to H</math> is uniquely determined by its differential <math>df</math>. Precisely, there is the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] <math>\\operatorname{exp}: \\operatorname{Lie}(G) \\to G</math> (and one for ''H'') such that <math>f(\\operatorname{exp}(X)) = \\operatorname{exp}(df(X))</math> and, since ''G'' is connected, this determines ''f'' uniquely.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 3.49</ref> In general, if ''U'' is a neighborhood of the identity element in a connected topological group ''G'', then <math>\\bigcup_{n > 0} U^n</math> coincides with ''G'', since the former is an open (hence closed) subgroup. Now, <math>\\operatorname{exp}: \\operatorname{Lie}(G) \\to G</math> defines a local homeomorphism from a neighborhood of the zero vector to the neighborhood of the identity element. For example, if ''G'' is the Lie group of invertible real square matrices of size ''n'' ([[general linear group]]), then <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is the Lie algebra of real square matrices of size ''n'' and <math>\\displaystyle \\exp(X) = e^X = \\sum_0^\\infty {X^j / j!}</math>.\n\n== The correspondence ==\nThe correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras includes the following three main results.\n*'''[[Lie's third theorem]]''': Every finite-dimensional real Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of some simply connected Lie group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.25</ref> \n*'''The homomorphisms theorem''': If <math>\\phi: \\operatorname{Lie}(G) \\to \\operatorname{Lie}(H)</math> is a Lie algebra homomorphism and if ''G'' is simply connected, then there exists a (unique) Lie group homomorphism <math>f: G \\to H</math> such that <math>\\phi = df</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.6</ref> \n*'''The subgroups–subalgebras theorem''': If ''G'' is a Lie group and <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a Lie subalgebra of <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math>, then there is a unique connected Lie subgroup (not necessarily closed) ''H'' of ''G'' with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.20</ref> \nIn the second part of the correspondence, the assumption that ''G'' is simply connected cannot be omitted. For example, the Lie algebras of SO(3) and SU(2) are isomorphic,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Example 3.27</ref> but there is no corresponding homomorphism of SO(3) into SU(2).<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 4.35</ref> Rather, the homomorphism goes from the simply connected group SU(2) to the non-simply connected group SO(3).<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 1.4</ref> If ''G'' and ''H'' are both simply connected and have isomorphic Lie algebras, the above result allows one to show that ''G'' and ''H'' are isomorphic.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 5.7</ref> One method to construct ''f'' is to use the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 5.7</ref>\n\n===Proof of Lie's third theorem===\nPerhaps the most elegant proof of the first result above uses [[Ado's theorem]], which says any finite-dimensional Lie algebra (over a field of any characteristic) is a Lie subalgebra of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math> of square matrices. The proof goes as follows: by Ado's theorem, we assume <math>\\mathfrak{g} \\subset \\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{R}) = \\operatorname{Lie}(GL_n(\\mathbb{R}))</math> is a Lie subalgebra. Let ''G'' be the subgroup of <math>GL_n(\\mathbb{R})</math> generated by <math>e^{\\mathfrak{g}}</math> and let <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> be a [[simply connected covering]] of ''G''; it is not hard to show that <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> is a Lie group and that the covering map is a Lie group homomorphism. Since <math>T_e \\widetilde{G} = T_e G = \\mathfrak{g}</math>, this completes the proof.\n\nExample: Each element ''X'' in the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> gives rise to the Lie algebra homomorphism\n:<math>\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathfrak{g}, \\, t \\mapsto tX.</math>\nBy Lie's third theorem, as <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(\\mathbb{R}) = T_0 \\mathbb{R} = \\mathbb{R}</math> and exp for it is the identity, this homomorphism is the differential of the Lie group homomorphism <math>\\mathbb{R} \\to H</math> for some immersed subgroup ''H'' of ''G''. This Lie group homomorphism, called the [[one-parameter subgroup]] generated by ''X'', is precisely the exponential map <math>t \\mapsto \\operatorname{exp}(tX)</math> and ''H'' its image. The preceding can be summarized to saying that there is a canonical bijective correspondence between <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and the set of one-parameter subgroups of ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 2.14</ref>\n\n===Proof of the homomorphisms theorem===\nOne approach to proving the second part of the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence (the homomorphisms theorem) is to use the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]], as in Section 5.7 of Hall's book.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}</ref> Specifically, given the Lie algebra homomorphism <math>\\phi</math> from <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> to <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(H)</math>, we may define <math>f: G \\to H</math> locally (i.e., in a neighborhood of the identity) by the formula \n:<math>f(e^X)=e^{\\phi(X)}</math>,\nwhere <math>e^X</math> is the exponential map for ''G'', which has an inverse defined near the identity. We now argue that ''f'' is a local homomorphism. Thus, given two elements near the identity <math>e^X</math> and <math>e^Y</math> (with ''X'' and ''Y'' small), we consider their product <math>e^Xe^Y</math>. According to the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula, we have <math>e^Xe^Y=e^Z</math>, where \n:<math>Z=X + Y + \\frac{1}{2}[X,Y] +\\frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]]+\\cdots</math>,\nwith <math>\\cdots</math> indicating other terms expressed as repeated commutators involving ''X'' and ''Y''. Thus, \n:<math>f(e^Xe^Y)=f(e^Z)=e^{\\phi(Z)}=e^{\\phi(X)+\\phi(Y) + \\frac{1}{2}[\\phi(X),\\phi(Y)] +\\frac{1}{12}[\\phi(X),[\\phi(X),\\phi(Y)]]+\\cdots},</math>\nbecause <math>\\phi</math> is a Lie algebra homomorphism. Using the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]] again, this time for the group ''H'', we see that this last expression becomes <math>e^{\\phi(X)}e^{\\phi(Y)}</math>, and therefore we have\n:<math>f(e^Xe^Y)=e^{\\phi(X)}e^{\\phi(Y)}=f(e^X)f(e^Y).</math>\nThus, ''f'' has the homomorphism property, at least when ''X'' and ''Y'' are sufficiently small. It is important to emphasize that this argument is only local, since the exponential map is only invertible in a small neighborhood of the identity in ''G'' and since the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula only holds if ''X'' and ''Y'' are small. Note also that we have not yet used the assumption that ''G'' is simply connected.\n\nThe next stage in the argument is to extend ''f'' from a local homomorphism to a global one. The extension is done by defining ''f'' it along a path and then using the simple connectedness of ''G'' to show that the definition is independent of the choice of path.\n\n== Lie group representations ==\nA special case of Lie correspondence is a correspondence between [[finite-dimensional representation]]s of a Lie group and representations of the associated Lie algebra.\n\nThe general linear group <math>GL_n(\\mathbb{C})</math> is a (real) [[Lie group]] and any Lie group homomorphism\n:<math>\\pi: G \\to GL_n(\\mathbb{C})</math>\nis called a representation of the Lie group ''G''.\nThe differential\n:<math>d\\pi: \\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\mathbb{C})</math>,\nis then a Lie algebra homomorphism called a [[Lie algebra representation]]. (The differential <math>d \\pi</math> is often simply denoted by <math>\\pi</math>.)\n\nThe homomorphisms theorem (mentioned above as part of the Lie group-Lie algebra correspondence) then says that if <math>G</math> is the simply connected Lie group whose Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, ''every'' representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> comes from a representation of ''G''. The assumption that ''G'' be simply connected is essential. Consider, for example, the rotation group [[Rotation_group_SO(3)|SO(3)]], which is not simply connected. There is one irreducible representation of the Lie algebra in each dimension, but only the odd-dimensional representations of the Lie algebra come from representations of the group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015|Section 4.7}}</ref> (This observation is related to the distinction between [[Spin_(physics)#Fermions_and_Bosons|integer spin and half-integer spin]] in quantum mechanics.) On the other hand, the group [[Special_unitary_group#n_.3D_2|SU(2)]] is simply connected with Lie algebra isomorphic to that of SO(3), so every representation of the Lie algebra of SO(3) does give rise to a [[Representation_theory_of_SU(2)|representation of SU(2)]]. \n\n===The adjoint representation===\nAn example of a Lie group representation is the [[adjoint representation]] of a Lie group ''G''; each element ''g'' in a Lie group ''G'' defines an automorphism of ''G'' by conjugation: <math>c_g(h) = ghg^{-1}</math>; the differential <math>d c_g</math> is then an automorphism of the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. This way, we get a representation <math>\\operatorname{Ad}: G \\to GL(\\mathfrak{g}), \\, g \\mapsto dc_g</math>, called the adjoint representation. The corresponding Lie algebra homomorphism <math>\\mathfrak{g} \\to \\mathfrak{gl}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is called the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and is denoted by <math>\\operatorname{ad}</math>. One can show <math>\\operatorname{ad}(X)(Y) = [X, Y]</math>, which in particular implies that the Lie bracket of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is determined by the [[group law]] on ''G''.\n\nBy Lie's third theorem, there exists a subgroup <math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> of <math>GL(\\mathfrak{g})</math> whose Lie algebra is <math>\\operatorname{ad}(\\mathfrak{g})</math>. (<math>\\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> is in general not a closed subgroup; only an immersed subgroup.) It is called the [[adjoint group]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|loc=Ch II, § 5}}</ref> If ''G'' is connected, it fits into the exact sequence:\n:<math>0 \\to Z(G) \\to G \\overset{\\operatorname{Ad}}\\to \\operatorname{Int}(\\mathfrak{g}) \\to 0</math>\nwhere <math>Z(G)</math> is the center of ''G''.

Since the Lie algebra of the center of ''G'' is the center of the Lie algebra of ''G'' (cf. the previous §), ''G'' is abelian if and only its Lie algebra is abelian.\n\nIf ''G'' is abelian, then the exponential map <math>\\operatorname{exp}: \\mathfrak{g} \\to G</math> is a surjective group homomorphism.<ref>It's surjective because <math>\\operatorname{exp}(\\mathfrak{g})^n = \\operatorname{exp}(\\mathfrak{g})</math> as <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is abelian.</ref> The kernel of it is a discrete group (since the dimension is zero) called the [[integer lattice (Lie group)|integer lattice]] of ''G'' and is denoted by <math>\\Gamma</math>. By the first isomorphism theorem, <math>\\operatorname{exp}</math> induces the isomorphism <math>\\mathfrak{g}/\\Gamma \\to G</math>.\n\nBy the [[rigidity argument]], the [[fundamental group]] <math>\\pi_1(G)</math> of a connected Lie group ''G'' is a central subgroup of a simply connected covering <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> of ''G''; in other words, ''G'' fits into the [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]]\n:<math>1 \\to \\pi_1(G) \\to \\widetilde{G} \\overset{p}\\to G \\to 1.</math>\nEquivalently, given a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and a simply connected Lie group  <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> whose Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, there is a one-to-one correspondence between quotients of <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> by discrete central subgroups and connected Lie groups having Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n<!--Let ''G'' be a compact connected Lie group. If <math>\\operatorname{Lie}(G)</math> is a [[Cartan subalgebra]], then ''G'' is a torus. -->\n\nFor the complex case, [[complex torus|complex tori]] are important; see [[complex Lie group]] for this topic.\n\n== Compact Lie groups ==\n{{main|Compact Lie group}}\n\nLet ''G'' be a connected Lie group with finite center. Then the following are equivalent.\n*''G'' is compact.\n*(Weyl) The simply connected covering <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> of ''G'' is compact.\n*The adjoint group <math>\\operatorname{Int}\\mathfrak{g}</math> is compact.\n*There exists an embedding <math>G \\hookrightarrow O(n, \\mathbb{R})</math> as a closed subgroup.\n*The [[Killing form]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is negative definite.\n*For each ''X'' in <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, <math>\\operatorname{ad}(X)</math> is [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]] and has zero or purely imaginary eigenvalues.\n*There exists an invariant inner product on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\nIt is important to emphasize that the equivalence of the preceding conditions holds only under the assumption that ''G'' has finite center. Thus, for example, if ''G'' is compact ''with finite center'', the universal cover <math>\\widetilde{G}</math> is also compact. Clearly, this conclusion does not hold if ''G'' has infinite center, e.g., if <math>G=S^1</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Lie superalgebra''' is a generalisation of a [[Lie algebra]] to include a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-[[graded algebra|grading]]. Lie superalgebras are important in [[theoretical physics]] where they are used to describe the mathematics of [[supersymmetry]]. In most of these theories, the ''even'' elements of the superalgebra correspond to [[boson]]s and ''odd'' elements to [[fermion]]s (but this is not always true; for example, the [[BRST supersymmetry]] is the other way around).\n\n==Definition<!--'Lie superbracket' and 'Supercommutator' redirect here-->==\nFormally, a Lie superalgebra is a nonassociative '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-[[graded algebra]], or ''[[superalgebra]]'', over a [[commutative ring]] (typically '''R''' or '''C''') whose product [·,&nbsp;·], called the '''Lie superbracket'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> or '''supercommutator'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, satisfies the two conditions (analogs of the usual [[Lie algebra]] axioms, with grading):\n\nSuper skew-symmetry:\n\n:<math>[x,y]=-(-1)^{|x| |y|}[y,x].\\ </math>\n\nThe super Jacobi identity:<ref>{{harvnb|Freund|1983|p=8}}</ref>\n\n:<math>(-1)^{|x||z|}[x, [y, z]] + (-1)^{|y||x|}[y, [z, x]] + (-1)^{|z||y|}[z, [x, y]] = 0, </math>\n\nwhere ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are pure in the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading. Here, |''x''| denotes the degree of ''x'' (either 0 or 1). The degree of [x,y] is the sum of degree of x and y modulo 2.\n\nOne also sometimes adds the axioms <math>[x,x]=0</math> for |''x''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (if 2 is invertible this follows automatically) and <math>[[x,x],x]=0</math> for |''x''|&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 (if 3 is invertible this follows automatically). When the ground ring is the integers or the Lie superalgebra is a free module, these conditions are equivalent to the condition that the [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] holds (and, in general, they are necessary conditions for the theorem to hold).\n\nJust as for Lie algebras, the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of the Lie superalgebra can be given a [[Hopf algebra]] structure.\n\nA [[graded Lie algebra]] (say, graded by '''Z''' or '''N''') that is anticommutative and Jacobi in the graded sense also has a <math>Z_2</math> grading (which is called \"rolling up\" the algebra into odd and even parts), but is not referred to as \"super\". See [[Graded Lie algebra#note-0|note at graded Lie algebra]] for discussion.\n\n== Properties ==\nLet <math>\\mathfrak g = \\mathfrak g_0 \\oplus \\mathfrak g_1</math> be a Lie superalgebra. By inspecting the Jacobi identity, one sees that there are eight cases depending on whether arguments are even or odd. These fall into four classes, indexed by the number of odd elements:<ref>{{harvnb|Varadarajan|2004|p=89}}</ref>\n\n# No odd elements. The statement is just that <math>\\mathfrak g_0</math> is an ordinary Lie algebra.\n# One odd element. Then <math>\\mathfrak g_1</math> is a <math>\\mathfrak g_0</math>-module for the action <math>\\mathrm{ad}_a: b \\rightarrow [a, b], \\quad a \\in \\mathfrak g_0, \\quad b, [a, b] \\in \\mathfrak g_1</math>.\n# Two odd elements. The Jacobi identity says that the bracket <math>\\mathfrak g_1 \\otimes \\mathfrak g_1 \\rightarrow \\mathfrak g_0</math> is a ''symmetric'' <math>\\mathfrak g_1</math>-map.\n# Three odd elements. For all <math>b \\in \\mathfrak g_1</math>, <math>[b,[b,b]] = 0</math>.\n\nThus the even subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak g_0</math> of a Lie superalgebra forms a (normal) Lie algebra as all the signs disappear, and the superbracket becomes a normal Lie bracket, while <math>\\mathfrak g_1</math> is a [[representation of a Lie algebra|linear representation]] of <math>\\mathfrak g_0</math>, and there exists a [[symmetric]] <math>\\mathfrak g_0</math>-[[equivariant]] [[linear map]] <math>\\{\\cdot,\\cdot\\}:\\mathfrak g_1\\otimes \\mathfrak g_1\\rightarrow \\mathfrak g_0</math> such that,\n\n:<math>[\\left\\{x, y\\right\\},z]+[\\left\\{y, z\\right\\},x]+[\\left\\{z, x\\right\\},y]=0, \\quad x,y, z \\in \\mathfrak g_1.</math>\n\nConditions (1)&ndash;(3) are linear and can all be understood in terms of ordinary Lie algebras. Condition (4) is nonlinear, and is the most difficult one to verify when constructing a Lie superalgebra starting from an ordinary Lie algebra (<math>\\mathfrak g_0</math>) and a representation (<math>\\mathfrak g_1</math>).\n\n==Involution==\nA '''<sup>∗</sup> Lie superalgebra''' is a complex Lie superalgebra equipped with an [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[antilinear]] map from itself to itself which respects the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub> grading and satisfies\n[''x'',''y'']<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''y''<sup>*</sup>,''x''<sup>*</sup>] for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the Lie superalgebra. (Some authors prefer the convention [''x'',''y'']<sup>*</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;(−1)<sup>|''x''||''y''|</sup>[''y''<sup>*</sup>,''x''<sup>*</sup>]; changing * to −* switches between the two conventions.) Its [[universal enveloping algebra]] would be an ordinary [[star-algebra|<sup>*</sup>-algebra]].\n\n==Examples==\nGiven any [[associative superalgebra]] <math>A</math> one can define the supercommutator on homogeneous elements by\n\n:<math>[x,y] = xy - (-1)^{|x||y|}yx\\ </math>\n\nand then extending by linearity to all elements. The algebra <math>A</math> together with the supercommutator then becomes a Lie superalgebra. The simplest example of this procedure is perhaps when <math>A</math> is the space of all linear functions <math>\\mathbf {End}(V)</math> of a super vector space <math>V</math> to itself. When <math>V = \\mathbb K^{p|q}</math>, this space is denoted by <math>M^{p|q}</math> or <math>M(p|q)</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Varadarajan|2004|p=87}}</ref> With the Lie bracket per above, the space is denoted <math>\\mathfrak {gl}(p|q)</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Varadarajan|2004|p=90}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Whitehead product]] on homotopy groups gives many examples of Lie superalgebras over the integers.\n\n==Classification==\n\nThe simple complex finite-dimensional Lie superalgebras were classified by [[Victor Kac]].\n\nThe basic classical compact Lie superalgebras (that are not Lie algebras) are: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/f380116p6858n46n/]\n\n'''SU(m/n)''' These are the superunitary Lie algebras which have invariants:\n\n:<math> z.\\overline{z}+iw.\\overline{w}</math>\n\nThis gives two orthosymplectic (see below) invariants if we take the m z variables and n w variables to be non-commutative and we take the real and imaginary parts.

It has dimension 17 and is a sub-algebra of OSp(9|8). The even part of the group is O(3)×O(3)×O(3). So the invariants are:\n\n:<math>A_\\mu A_\\mu+B_\\mu B_\\mu+C_\\mu C_\\mu +\\psi^{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}\\psi^{\\alpha' \\beta' \\gamma'}\\varepsilon_{\\alpha \\alpha'}\\varepsilon_{\\beta \\beta'}\\varepsilon_{\\gamma \\gamma'}</math>\n\n:<math> A_{\\{1} A_2 A_{3\\}} + B_{\\{1} B_2 B_{3\\}} + C_{\\{1} C_2 C_{3\\}} + A_\\mu \\Gamma^{\\alpha \\alpha'}_\\mu \\psi\\psi + B_\\mu \\Gamma^{\\beta \\beta'}_\\mu \\psi\\psi + C_\\mu \\Gamma^{\\gamma \\gamma'}_\\mu \\psi\\psi</math>\n\nfor particular constants <math>\\gamma</math>.\n\n'''F'''(4)\nThis exceptional Lie superalgebra has dimension 40 and is a sub-algebra of OSp(24|16).  The even part of the group is O(3)xSO(7) so three invariants are:\n\n:<math>B_{\\mu \\nu} + B_{\\nu \\mu} = 0 </math>\n:<math>A_\\mu A_\\mu + B_{\\mu \\nu}B_{\\mu \\nu} + \\psi_{\\{1}^\\alpha \\psi_{2\\}}^\\alpha</math>\n:<math>A_{\\{1} A_2 A_{3\\}} + B_{\\{\\mu \\nu} B_{\\nu \\tau} B_{\\tau \\mu\\}} + B_{\\mu \\nu} \\sigma_{\\mu \\nu}^{\\alpha \\beta} \\psi^\\alpha_k \\psi^\\beta_k + A_\\mu \\Gamma_\\mu^{\\alpha \\beta} \\psi^k_\\alpha \\psi^k_\\beta + (\\text{sym.})</math>\n\nThis group is related to the octonions by considering the 16 component spinors as two component octonion spinors and the gamma matrices acting on the upper indices as unit octonions.

The even part of the group is O(3)×G2. The invariants are similar to the above (it being a subalgebra of the ''F''(4)?) so the first invariant is:\n\n:<math>A_\\mu A_\\mu + C^\\mu_\\alpha C^\\mu_\\alpha + \\psi_{\\{1}^\\mu \\psi_{2\\}}^\\nu</math>\n\nThere are also two so-called '''strange''' series called '''p'''(''n'') and '''q'''(''n'').\n\n==Classification of infinite-dimensional simple linearly compact Lie superalgebras==\nThe classification consists of the 10 series '''W'''(''m'', ''n''), '''S'''(''m'', ''n'') ((m, n) ≠ (1, 1)), '''H(2m, n)''', '''K'''(2''m'' + 1, ''n''), '''HO(m, m)''' (''m'' ≥ 2), '''SHO'''(''m'', ''m'') (''m'' ≥ 3), '''KO'''(''m'', ''m'' + 1), '''SKO(m, m + 1; β)''' (''m'' ≥ 2), '''SHO'''&nbsp;∼&nbsp;(2''m'', 2''m''), '''SKO'''&nbsp;∼&nbsp;(2''m'' + 1, 2''m'' + 3) and the five exceptional algebras:\n\n::'''E(1, 6)''', '''E(5, 10)''', '''E(4, 4)''', '''E(3, 6)''', '''E(3, 8)'''\n\nThe last two are particularly interesting (according to Kac) because they have the standard model gauge group '''SU'''(3)×'''S'''U(2)×'''U'''(1) as their zero level algebra.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littelmann_path_model",
      "text": ":''For path models in statistics, see [[Path analysis (statistics)]].''\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''Littelmann path model''' is a [[combinatorics|combinatorial device]] due to [[Peter Littelmann]] for computing multiplicities ''without overcounting'' in the [[representation theory]] of symmetrisable [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s. Its most important application is to complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s or equivalently compact [[semisimple Lie group]]s, the case described in this article. Multiplicities in [[Weyl character formula|irreducible representations]], tensor products and [[branching rule]]s can be calculated using a [[graph theory|coloured directed graph]], with labels given by the [[root system|simple roots]] of the Lie algebra.\n\nDeveloped as a bridge between the theory of [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] arising from the work of [[Masaki Kashiwara|Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig|Lusztig]] on [[quantum group]]s and the [[standard monomial theory]] of [[C. S. Seshadri]] and Lakshmibai, Littelmann's path model associates to each irreducible representation a rational vector space with basis given by paths from the origin to a [[root lattice|weight]] as well as a pair of '''root operators''' acting on paths for each [[root lattice|simple root]]. This gives a direct way of recovering the algebraic and combinatorial structures previously discovered by Kashiwara and Lusztig using quantum groups.\n\n==Background and motivation==\nSome of the basic questions in the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras or compact semisimple Lie groups going back to [[Hermann Weyl]] include:<ref>{{harvnb|Weyl|1946}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1994}}</ref>\n\n* For a given [[dominant weight]] '''λ''', find the weight multiplicities in the [[Weyl character formula|irreducible representation]] ''L''(λ) with highest weight λ.\n* For two highest weights λ, μ, find the decomposition of their tensor product ''L''(λ) <math>\\otimes </math> ''L''(μ) into irreducible representations.\n* Suppose that <math>\\mathfrak{g}_1</math> is the [[Levi decomposition|Levi component]] of a [[parabolic subalgebra]] of a semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>. For a given dominant highest weight '''λ''', determine the [[branching rule]] for decomposing the restriction of ''L''('''λ''') to <math>\\mathfrak{g}_1</math>.<ref>Every complex semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the [[complexification]] of the Lie algebra of a compact connected simply connected semisimple Lie group. The subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}_1</math> corresponds to a maximal rank closed subgroup, i.e. one containing a maximal torus.</ref>\n\n(Note that the first problem, of weight multiplicities, is the special case of the third in which the parabolic subalgebra is a Borel subalgebra. Moreover, the Levi branching problem can be embedded in the tensor product problem as a certain limiting case.)\n\nAnswers to these questions were first provided by Hermann Weyl and [[Richard Brauer]] as consequences of [[Weyl character formula|explicit character formulas]],<ref>{{harvnb|Weyl|1946|p=230,312}}. The \"Brauer-Weyl rules\" for restriction to maximal rank subgroups and for tensor products were developed independently by Brauer (in his thesis on the representations of the orthogonal groups) and by Weyl (in his papers on representations of compact semisimple Lie groups).</ref> followed by later combinatorial formulas of [[Hans Freudenthal]], [[Robert Steinberg]] and [[Bertram Kostant]]; see {{harvtxt|Humphreys|1994}}. An unsatisfactory feature of these formulas is that they involved alternating sums for quantities that were known a priori to be non-negative. Littelmann's method expresses these multiplicities as sums of non-negative integers ''without overcounting''. His work generalizes classical results based on [[Young tableau]]x for the [[general linear group|general linear Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{gl}</math><sub>''n''</sub> or the [[special linear group|special linear Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{sl}</math><sub>''n''</sub>:<ref>{{harvnb|Littlewood|1950}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Macdonald|1979}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sundaram|1990}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|King|1990}}</ref>\n\n* [[Issai Schur]]'s result in his 1901 dissertation that the weight multiplicities could be counted in terms of column-strict Young tableaux (i.e. weakly increasing to the right along rows, and strictly increasing down columns).\n* The celebrated [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]] that describes both tensor product decompositions and branching from  <math>\\mathfrak{gl}</math><sub>''m''+''n''</sub> to  <math>\\mathfrak{gl}</math><sub>''m''</sub> <math>\\oplus</math>  <math>\\mathfrak{gl}</math><sub>''n''</sub> in terms of lattice permutations of skew tableaux.\n\nAttempts at finding similar algorithms without overcounting for the other classical Lie algebras had only been partially successful.<ref>Numerous authors have made contributions, including the physicist R. C. King, and the mathematicians S. Sundaram, [[I. M. Gelfand]], [[A. Zelevinsky]] and A. Berenstein. The surveys of {{harvtxt|King|1990}} and {{harvtxt|Sundaram|1990}} give variants of [[Young tableaux]] which can be used to compute weight multiplicities, branching rules and tensor products with fundamental representations for the remaining classical Lie algebras. {{harvtxt|Berenstein|Zelevinsky|2001}} discuss how their method using [[convex polytope]]s, proposed in 1988, is related to Littelmann paths and crystal bases.</ref>\n\nLittelmann's contribution was to give a unified combinatorial model that applied to all symmetrizable [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s and provided explicit subtraction-free combinatorial formulas for weight multiplicities, tensor product rules and [[branching rule]]s. He accomplished this by introducing the vector space ''V'' over '''Q''' generated by the [[weight lattice]] of a [[Cartan subalgebra]]; on the vector space of piecewise-linear paths in ''V'' connecting the origin to a weight, he defined a pair of ''root operators'' for each [[root lattice|simple root]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\nThe combinatorial data could be encoded in a coloured directed graph, with labels given by the simple roots.\n\nLittelmann's main motivation<ref>{{harvnb|Littelmann|2007}}</ref> was to reconcile two different aspects of representation theory:\n\n* The standard monomial theory of Lakshmibai and Seshadri arising from the geometry of [[Schubert variety|Schubert varieties]].\n*[[crystal basis|Crystal bases]] arising in the approach to [[quantum group]]s of  [[Masaki Kashiwara]] and [[George Lusztig]]. Kashiwara and Lusztig constructed canonical bases for representations of deformations of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> depending on a formal deformation parameter ''q''. In the degenerate case when ''q'' = 0, these yield [[crystal basis|crystal bases]] together with pairs of operators corresponding to simple roots; see {{harvtxt|Ariki|2002}}.\n\nAlthough differently defined, the crystal basis, its root operators and crystal graph were later shown to be equivalent to Littelmann's path model and graph; see {{harvtxt|Hong|Kang|2002|p=xv}}. In the case of complex semisimple Lie algebras, there is a simplified self-contained account in {{harvtxt|Littelmann|1997}} relying only on the properties of [[root system]]s; this approach is followed here.\n\n==Definitions==\nLet ''P'' be the [[weight lattice]] in the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] of the [[semisimple Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\nA '''Littelmann path''' is a piecewise-linear mapping\n\n:<math>\\pi:[0,1]\\cap \\mathbf{Q} \\rightarrow  P\\otimes_{\\mathbf{Z}}\\mathbf{Q}</math>\n\nsuch that π(0)&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and π(1) is a [[weight lattice|weight]].\n\nLet (''H''<sub> α</sub>) be the basis of  <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> consisting of \"coroot\" vectors, dual to basis of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>* formed by [[root system|simple roots]] (α). For fixed α and a path  π, the function <math>h(t)= (\\pi(t), H_\\alpha)</math> has a minimum value ''M''.\n\nDefine non-decreasing self-mappings ''l'' and ''r'' of [0,1] <math>\\cap</math> '''Q''' by\n\n:<math> l(t) = \\min_{t\\le s\\le 1} (1,h(s)-M),\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, r(t) = 1 - \\min_{0\\le s\\le t} (1,h(s)-M).</math>\n\nThus ''l''(''t'') = 0 until the last time that ''h''(''s'') = ''M'' and ''r''(''t'') = 1 after the first time that ''h''(''s'') = ''M''.\n\nDefine new paths π<sub>l</sub> and  π<sub>r</sub> by\n\n:<math>\\pi_r(t)= \\pi(t) + r(t) \\alpha,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\pi_l(t) = \\pi(t) - l(t)\\alpha</math>\n\nThe '''root operators''' ''e''<sub>α</sub> and ''f''<sub>α</sub> are defined on a basis vector [π] by\n\n* <math>\\displaystyle{ e_\\alpha [\\pi] = [\\pi_r]} </math> if ''r'' (0) = 0 and 0 otherwise;\n* <math> \\displaystyle{f_\\alpha [\\pi] = [\\pi_l]} </math> if ''l'' (1) = 1 and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe key feature here is that the paths form a basis for the root operators like that of a [[monomial representation]]: when a root operator is applied to the basis element for a path, the result is either 0 or the basis element for another path.\n\n==Properties==\nLet <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> be the algebra generated by the root operators. Let π(''t'') be a path lying wholly within the positive [[Weyl chamber]] defined by the simple roots. Using results on the path model of [[C. S. Seshadri]] and Lakshmibai, Littelmann showed that\n\n*the <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>-module generated by [π] depends only on π(1) = λ and has a '''Q'''-basis consisting of paths [σ];\n*the multiplicity of the weight μ in the integrable highest weight representation ''L''(λ) is the number of paths σ with σ(1) = μ.\n\nThere is also an action of the [[Weyl group]] on paths [π]. If α is a simple root and ''k'' = ''h''(1), with ''h'' as above, then the corresponding reflection ''s''<sub>α</sub> acts as follows:\n\n* ''s''<sub>α</sub> [π] = [π] if ''k'' = 0;\n* ''s''<sub>α</sub> [π]= ''f''<sub>α</sub><sup>''k''</sup> [π] if ''k'' > 0;\n* ''s''<sub>α</sub> [π]= ''e''<sub>α</sub><sup> – ''k''</sup> [π] if ''k'' < 0.\n\nIf π is a path lying wholly inside the positive Weyl chamber, the '''Littelmann graph''' <math>\\mathcal{G}_\\pi</math> is defined to be the coloured, directed graph having as vertices the non-zero paths obtained by successively applying the operators ''f''<sub>α</sub> to π. There is a directed arrow from one path to another labelled by the simple root α, if the target path is obtained from the source path by applying ''f''<sub>α</sub>.\n\n* The Littelmann graphs of two paths are isomorphic as coloured, directed graphs if and only if the paths have the same end point.\n\nThe Littelmann graph therefore only depends on λ.  Kashiwara and Joseph proved that it coincides with the \"crystal graph\" defined by Kashiwara in the theory of crystal bases.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Character formula===\n\nIf π(1) = λ, the multiplicity of the weight μ in ''L''(λ) is the number of  vertices σ in the Littelmann graph <math> \\mathcal{G}_\\pi </math> with σ(1) = μ.\n\n===Generalized Littlewood–Richardson rule===\n\nLet π and σ be paths in the positive Weyl chamber with π(1) = λ and σ(1) = μ.

      "title": "Magnus expansion",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_expansion",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the '''Magnus expansion''', named after [[Wilhelm Magnus]] (1907&ndash;1990), provides an exponential representation of the solution of a first order homogeneous [[linear differential equation]] for a [[linear operator]]. In particular it furnishes the fundamental matrix  of a system of linear [[ordinary differential equations]] of order {{mvar|n}} with varying coefficients. The exponent is aggregated as an infinite series whose terms involve multiple integrals and  nested commutators.\n\n== Magnus approach and its interpretation ==\n\nGiven the {{math|''n''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n''}} coefficient matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}}, one wishes to solve the [[initial value problem]] associated with the linear ordinary differential equation\n\n:<math>Y^{\\prime}(t)=A(t)Y(t),\\qquad\\qquad Y(t_0)=Y_{0}</math>\n \nfor the unknown {{mvar|n}}-dimensional vector function {{math|''Y''(''t'')}}.\n\nWhen ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the solution simply reads \n:<math>Y(t)= \\exp \\left( \\int_{t_0}^{t}A(s)\\,ds \\right) Y_{0}.</math>\n \nThis is still valid for ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1 if the matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}} satisfies {{math|''A''(''t''<sub>1</sub>) ''A''(''t''<sub>2</sub>) {{=}} ''A''(''t''<sub>2</sub>)  ''A''(''t''<sub>1</sub>)}} for any pair of values of ''t'', ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub>.  In particular, this is the case if the matrix {{mvar|A}} is independent of {{mvar|t}}. In the general case, however, the expression above is no longer the solution of the problem.\n \nThe approach introduced by Magnus, to solve the matrix initial value problem, is to express the solution by means of the exponential of a certain {{math|''n''&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;''n''}} matrix function  \n{{math|''Ω''(''t'', ''t''<sub>0</sub>)}}, \n:<math>  Y(t)=\\exp \\left( \\Omega (t,t_0)\\right) \\, Y_0  ~,</math>\nwhich is subsequently constructed as a [[Series (mathematics)|series]] expansion,\n::<math>\\Omega(t)=\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\Omega_{k}(t),</math>\nwhere, for simplicity, it is customary to write {{math|''Ω''(''t'')}} for  {{math|''Ω''(''t'', ''t''<sub>0</sub>)}} and to take ''t''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nMagnus appreciated that, since {{math|(<sup>''d''</sup>&frasl;<sub>''dt''</sub> ''e<sup>Ω</sup>'')  ''e<sup>−Ω</sup>'' {{=}} ''A''(''t'')}}, using a [[Derivative of the exponential map|Poincaré−Hausdorff]] matrix identity, he could relate the time-derivative of  {{mvar|Ω}} to the generating function of [[Bernoulli number#Generating function|Bernoulli numbers]] and \nthe [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint endomorphism]] of {{mvar|Ω}}, \n::<math>\\Omega ' = \\frac {\\operatorname{ad}_\\Omega}{\\exp(\\operatorname{ad}_\\Omega)-1}  ~        A~,</math>\nto solve for  {{mvar|Ω}}  recursively in terms of {{mvar|A}}, \"in a continuous analog of the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula|CBH expansion]]\", as outlined in a subsequent  section.\n\nThe equation above constitutes the '''Magnus expansion''' or '''Magnus series'''  for the solution of matrix linear initial value problem. The first four terms of this series read\n:<math>\n \\begin{align}\n  \\Omega_1(t) &= \\int_0^t A(t_1)\\,dt_1, \\\\\n  \\Omega_2(t) &= \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t dt_1 \\int_0^{t_1} dt_2\\ \\left[  A(t_1),A(t_2)\\right], \\\\\n  \\Omega_3(t) &= \\frac{1}{6} \\int_0^t dt_1 \\int_0^{t_1}d t_2 \\int_0^{t_2} dt_3\n                 \\Bigl(\\left[A(t_1),\\left[A(t_2),A(t_3)\\right]\\right]+\\left[A(t_3),\\left[  A(t_2),A(t_{1})\\right]\\right]\\Bigr), \\\\\n  \\Omega_4(t) &= \\frac{1}{12} \\int_0^t dt_1 \\int_0^{t_1}d t_2 \\int_0^{t_2} dt_3 \\int_0^{t_3} dt_4\n                 \\Bigl(\\left[\\left[\\left[A_1,A_2\\right],A_3\\right],A_4\\right] \\\\\n              &\\quad+\\left[A_1,\\left[\\left[A_2,A_3\\right],A_4\\right]\\right]\n                    +\\left[A_1,\\left[A_2,\\left[A_3,A_4\\right]\\right]\\right]\n                    +\\left[A_2,\\left[A_3,\\left[A_4,A_1\\right]\\right]\\right]\\Bigr)\n \\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere {{math|[''A'', ''B''] ≡ ''A'' ''B'' − ''B'' ''A''}} is the matrix [[commutator]] of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\nThese equations may be interpreted as follows:  {{math|''Ω''<sub>1</sub>(''t'')}} coincides exactly with the exponent in the scalar ({{mvar|n}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1) case, but this equation cannot give the whole solution. If one insists in having an exponential representation ([[Lie group]]), the exponent needs to be corrected. The rest of the Magnus series provides that correction systematically: {{mvar|Ω}}  or parts of it are in the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[Lie group]] on the solution.\n\nIn applications, one can rarely sum exactly the Magnus series and one has to truncate it to get approximate solutions. The main advantage of the Magnus proposal is that the truncated series very often shares important qualitative properties with the exact solution, at variance with other conventional [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]] theories. For instance, in [[classical mechanics]] the [[Symplectic geometry|symplectic]] character of the [[time evolution]] is preserved at every order of approximation. Similarly the [[unitary operator|unitary]] character of the time evolution operator in [[quantum mechanics]] is also preserved (in contrast, e.g., to the [[Dyson series]] solving the same problem).\n\n== Convergence of the expansion ==\n\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the convergence problem is the following: given a certain matrix {{math|''A''(''t'')}}, when can the exponent  {{math|''Ω''(''t'')}} be obtained as the sum of the Magnus series?\n\nA sufficient condition for this series to [[convergent series|converge]] for  {{math|''t'' ∈  [0,''T'')}} is \n:<math>   \\int_0^T \\|A(s)\\|_2 ds < \\pi</math>\nwhere <math> \\| \\cdot \\|_2</math> denotes a [[matrix norm]]. This result is generic, in the sense that one may construct specific matrices {{math|''A''(''t'')}}  for which the series diverges for any {{math|''t'' > ''T''}}.\n\n== Magnus generator ==\n\nA recursive procedure to generate all the terms in the Magnus expansion utilizes  the matrices {{math| ''S''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''k'')</sup>}}, defined recursively through\n:<math>S_{n}^{(j)} =\\sum_{m=1}^{n-j}\\left[ \\Omega_{m},S_{n-m}^{(j-1)}\\right],\\qquad\\qquad  2\\leq j\\leq n-1  </math>\n:<math>S_{n}^{(1)} =\\left[ \\Omega _{n-1},A \\right] ,\\qquad S_{n}^{(n-1)}= \\mathrm{ad} _{\\Omega _{1}}^{n-1} (A)  ~,</math>\nwhich then furnish\n:<math>\\Omega _{1} =\\int_{0}^{t}A (\\tau )d\\tau </math>\n:<math>\\Omega _{n} =\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\\frac{B_{j}}{j!}\\int_{0}^{t}S_{n}^{(j)}(\\tau)d\\tau ,\\qquad\\qquad n\\geq 2.  </math>\n\nHere, ad<sup>''k''</sup><sub>''Ω''</sub> is a shorthand for an iterated commutator, (see [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint endomorphism]]),\n:<math>\\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^0 A = A, \\qquad \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^{k+1} A = [ \\Omega, \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega}^k A ], </math>\nwhile {{math|''B''<sub>''j''</sub>}}  are the [[Bernoulli numbers]] with {{math|1=''B''<sub>1</sub> = −1/2}}.\n\nFinally, when this recursion is worked out explicitly, it is possible to express  {{math|''Ω''<sub>''n''</sub>(''t'')}}  as a linear combination of ''n''-fold integrals of ''n''−1  nested commutators involving {{mvar|n}} matrices {{mvar|A}},\n:<math>    \\Omega_n(t) =  \\sum_{j=1}^{n-1} \\frac{B_j}{j!} \\,\n    \\sum_{\n            k_1 + \\cdots + k_j = n-1 \\atop\n            k_1 \\ge 1, \\ldots, k_j \\ge 1}\n            \\, \\int_0^t \\,\n       \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega_{k_1}(\\tau )} \\,  \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega_{k_2}(\\tau )} \\cdots\n          \\, \\mathrm{ad}_{\\Omega_{k_j}(\\tau )} A(\\tau ) \\, d\\tau     \\qquad n \\ge 2,</math>\nan expression which becomes increasingly intricate with {{mvar|n}}.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSince the 1960s, the Magnus expansion has been successfully applied as a perturbative tool in numerous areas of physics and chemistry, from [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[molecular physics]] to [[nuclear magnetic resonance]]<ref>1.Haeberlen, U. & Waugh, J. S. Coherent Averaging Effects in Magnetic Resonance. Phys. Rev. 175, 453–467 (1968).</ref> and [[quantum electrodynamics]].

The functors involved in these equivalences are as follows: a Malcev group ''G'' is mapped to the completion (with respect to the [[augmentation ideal]]) of its [[group ring]] '''Q'''''G'', with inverse given by the group of ''grouplike elements'' of a Hopf algebra ''H'', essentially those elements 1 + ''x'' such that <math>\\Delta (x) = x \\otimes x</math>. From complete Hopf algebras to Malcev Lie algebras one gets by taking the (completion of) [[primitive element (coalgebra)|primitive element]]s, with inverse functor given by the completion of the [[universal enveloping algebra]].\n\nThis equivalence of categories was used by {{harvtxt|Goodwillie|1986}} to prove that, after tensoring with '''Q''', relative ''K''-theory K(''A'', ''I''), for a nilpotent ideal ''I'', is isomorphic to relative [[cyclic homology]] HC(''A'', ''I'').

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nijenhuis%E2%80%93Richardson_bracket",
      "text": "In [[mathematics]], the '''algebraic bracket''' or '''Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket''' is a [[graded Lie algebra]] structure on the space of [[exterior product|alternating multilinear forms]] of a [[vector space]] to itself, introduced by  [[A. Nijenhuis]] and  [[R. W. Richardson, Jr]] (1966, 1967). It is related to but not the same as the [[Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket]] and the [[Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket]].\n\n==Definition==\nThe primary motivation for introducing the bracket was to develop a uniform framework for discussing all possible [[Lie algebra]] structures on a vector space, and subsequently the [[deformation theory|deformations]] of these structures.  If ''V'' is a vector space and {{nowrap|''p'' ≥ −1}} is an integer, let \n:<math>\\operatorname{Alt}^p(V) = ({\\bigwedge}^{p+1} V^*)\\otimes V</math>\nbe the space of all skew-symmetric {{nowrap|(''p'' + 1)}}-multilinear mappings of ''V'' to itself.  The direct sum Alt(''V'') is a [[graded vector space]].  A '''Lie algebra''' structure on ''V'' is determined by a skew-symmetric bilinear map {{nowrap|''μ'' : ''V'' × ''V'' → ''V''}}.  That is to say, ''μ'' is an element of Alt<sup>1</sup>(''V'').  Furthermore, ''μ'' must obey the [[Jacobi identity]].  The  Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket supplies a systematic manner for expressing this identity in the form {{nowrap|1=[''μ'', ''μ''] = 0}}.\n\nIn detail, the bracket is a bilinear bracket operation defined on Alt(''V'') as follows.  On homogeneous elements {{nowrap|''P'' ∈ Alt<sup>''p''</sup>(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''Q'' ∈ Alt<sup>''q''</sup>(''V'')}}, the Nijenhuis–Richardson  bracket {{nowrap|[''P'', ''Q'']<sup>∧</sup> ∈ Alt<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>(''V'')}} is given by\n:<math>[P,Q]^\\land = i_P Q - (-1)^{pq}i_Q P .</math>\nHere the [[interior product]] ''i''<sub>''P''</sub>  is defined by\n:<math>(i_P Q)(X_0,X_1,\\ldots,X_{p+q}) = \\sum_{\\sigma\\in Sh_{q+1,p}}\\mathrm{sgn}(\\sigma) P(Q(X_{\\sigma(0)},X_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,X_{\\sigma(q)}),X_{{\\sigma(q+1)}},\\ldots,X_{{\\sigma(p+q)}})</math>\nwhere the sum is over all [[(p,q) shuffle|(''q+1'', ''p'')-shuffle]]s of the indices, i.e. permutations <math>\\sigma</math> of <math>\\{0,\\ldots,p+q\\}</math> such that <math>\\sigma(0) < \\cdots < \\sigma(q)</math> and <math>\\sigma(q+1) < \\cdots < \\sigma(p+q)</math>.\n\nOn non-homogeneous elements, the bracket is extended by bilinearity.\n\n==Derivations of the ring of forms==\nThe Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket can be defined on the vector valued forms Ω<sup>*</sup>(''M'', ''T''(''M'')) on a smooth manifold ''M''\nin a similar way. Vector valued forms act as derivations on the supercommutative ring Ω<sup>*</sup>(''M'') of forms on ''M''\nby taking ''K'' to the derivation ''i<sub>K</sub>'', and the Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket then corresponds to the commutator of two derivations. This identifies Ω<sup>*</sup>(''M'', ''T''(''M'')) with the algebra of derivations that vanish on smooth functions. Not all derivations are of this form; for the structure of the full ring of all derivations see the article [[Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket]].\n\nThe Nijenhuis–Richardson bracket and the Frölicher–Nijenhuis bracket both make Ω<sup>*</sup>(''M'', ''T''(''M'')) into a graded superalgebra, but have different degrees.\n\n==References==\n*Pierre Lecomte, Peter W.

      "text": "In mathematics, '''nilpotent orbits''' are generalizations of [[nilpotent]] [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that play an important role\nin [[representation theory]] of real and complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s and [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nAn element ''X'' of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] ''g'' is called '''nilpotent''' if its [[adjoint endomorphism]]\n\n: ''ad X'': ''g''&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;''g'',&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;''ad X''(''Y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;[''X'',''Y'']\n\nis nilpotent, that is, (''ad X'')<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for large enough ''n''. Equivalently, ''X'' is nilpotent if its [[characteristic polynomial]] ''p''<sub>''ad X''</sub>(''t'') is equal to ''t''<sup>dim ''g''</sup>.\n\nA semisimple [[Lie group]] or [[algebraic group]] ''G'' acts on its Lie algebra via the [[adjoint endomorphism|adjoint representation]], and the property of being nilpotent is invariant under this action. A '''nilpotent orbit''' is an orbit of the adjoint action such that any (equivalently, all) of its elements is (are) nilpotent.\n\n== Examples ==\nNilpotent <math>n\\times n</math> matrices with complex entries form the main motivating case for the general theory, corresponding to the complex [[general linear group]]. From the [[Jordan normal form]] of matrices we know that each nilpotent matrix is conjugate to a unique matrix with Jordan blocks of sizes <math>\\lambda_1\\geq \\lambda_2\\geq\\ldots\\geq\\lambda_r,</math> where <math>\\lambda</math> is a [[partition (number theory)|partition]] of ''n''. Thus in the case ''n''=2 there are two nilpotent orbits, the ''zero orbit'' consisting of the [[zero matrix]] and corresponding to the partition (''1'',''1'') and the ''principal orbit'' consisting of all non-zero matrices ''A'' with zero trace and determinant, \n: <math> A=\\begin{bmatrix}x & y\\\\ z & -x \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad (x,y,z)\\ne (0,0,0)\\quad{\\;}</math> with <math>x^2+yz=0,</math>\ncorresponding to the partition (''2''). Geometrically, this orbit is a two-dimensional complex quadratic [[cone (geometry)|cone]] in four-dimensional vector space of <math>2\\times 2</math> matrices minus its apex.\n\nThe complex [[special linear group]] is a subgroup of the general linear group with the same nilpotent orbits. However, if we replace the ''complex'' special linear group with the ''real'' special linear group, new nilpotent orbits may arise. In particular, for ''n''=2 there are now 3 nilpotent orbits: the zero orbit and two real half-cones (without the apex), corresponding to positive and negative values of <math>y-z</math> in the parametrization above.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Nilpotent orbits can be characterized as those orbits of the adjoint action whose [[Zariski closure]] contains 0. \n* Nilpotent orbits are finite in number.\n* The Zariski closure of a nilpotent orbit is a union of nilpotent orbits. \n* '''Jacobson–Morozov theorem''': over a field of [[characteristic zero]], any nilpotent element ''e'' can be included into an [[Sl2-triple|''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple]] {''e'',''h'',''f''} and all such triples are conjugate by ''Z''<sub>''G''</sub>(''e''), the [[centralizer]] of ''e'' in ''G''. Together with the representation theory of ''sl''<sub>2</sub>, this allows one to label nilpotent orbits by finite combinatorial data, giving rise to the ''Dynkin–Kostant classification'' of nilpotent orbits.\n\n== Poset structure ==\n\nNilpotent orbits form a [[partially ordered set]]: given two nilpotent orbits, ''O''<sub>1</sub> is less than or equal to ''O''<sub>2</sub> if ''O''<sub>1</sub> is contained in the Zariski closure of ''O''<sub>2</sub>. This poset has a unique minimal element, zero orbit, and unique  \nmaximal element, the ''regular nilpotent orbit'', but in general, it is not a [[graded poset]]. \nIf the ground field is [[algebraically closed]] then the zero orbit is [[covering relation|covered]] by a unique orbit, called the ''minimal orbit'', and the regular orbit covers a unique orbit, called the ''subregular orbit''.\n\nIn the case of the [[special linear group]] ''SL''<sub>''n''</sub>, the nilpotent orbits are parametrized by the [[partition (number theory)|partitions]] of ''n''. By a theorem of [[Murray Gerstenhaber|Gerstenhaber]], the ordering of the orbits corresponds to the [[dominance order]] on the partitions of ''n''. Moreover, if ''G'' is an [[classical group|isometry group of a bilinear form]], i.e. an orthogonal or symplectic subgroup of ''SL''<sub>''n''</sub>, then its nilpotent orbits are parametrized by partitions of ''n'' satisfying a certain parity condition and the corresponding poset structure is induced by the dominance order on all partitions (this is a nontrivial theorem, due to Gerstenhaber and Hesselink).\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Adjoint endomorphism|Adjoint representation]]\n\n== References ==\n*David Collingwood and  William McGovern.

      "text": "{{Lie groups |Physics}}\n\nThere is a natural connection between [[particle physics]] and [[representation theory]], as first noted in the 1930s by [[Eugene Wigner]].<ref>Wigner received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1963 \"for his contributions to the theory of the atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery and application of fundamental symmetry principles\"; see also [[Wigner's theorem]], [[Wigner's classification]].</ref> It links the properties of [[elementary particle]]s to the structure of [[Lie groups]] and [[Lie algebras]]. According to this connection, the different [[quantum state]]s of an elementary particle give rise to an [[irreducible representation]] of the [[Poincaré group]]. Moreover, the properties of the various particles, including their [[energy spectrum|spectra]], can be related to representations of Lie algebras, corresponding to \"approximate symmetries\" of the universe.\n\n== General picture ==\n===Symmetries of a quantum system===\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], any particular one-particle state is represented as a [[vector space|vector]] in a [[Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathcal H</math>. To help understand what types of particles can exist, it is important to classify the possibilities for <math>\\mathcal H</math> allowed by [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|symmetries]], and their properties. In a relativistic quantum system, for example, <math>G</math> might be the [[Poincaré group]], while for the hydrogen atom, <math>G</math> might be the [[rotation group SO(3)]]. The particle state is more precisely characterized by the associated [[projective Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>, also called [[Wigner's theorem#Rays and ray space|ray space]], since two vectors that differ by a nonzero scalar factor correspond to the same physical [[quantum state]] represented by a ''ray'' in Hilbert space, which is an [[equivalence class]] in <math>\\mathcal H</math> and, under the natural projection map <math>\\mathcal H \\rightarrow \\mathrm P \\mathcal H</math>, an element of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nLet <math>\\mathcal H</math> be a Hilbert space describing a particular quantum system and let <math>G</math> be a group of symmetries of the quantum system. By definition of a symmetry of a quantum system, there is a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. For each <math>g\\in G</math>, there is a corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. More specifically, if <math>g</math> is some symmetry of the system (say, rotation about the x-axis by 12°), then the corresponding transformation <math>V(g)</math> of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> is a map on ray space. For example, when rotating a ''stationary'' (zero momentum) spin-5 particle about its center, <math>g</math> is a rotation in 3D space (an element of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>), while <math>V(g)</math> is an operator whose domain and range are each the space of possible quantum states of this particle, in this example the projective space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> associated with an 11-dimensional complex Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H</math>.\n\nEach map <math>V(g)</math> preserves, by definition of symmetry, the [[Wigner's theorem#Symmetry transformations|ray product]] on <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> induced by the inner product on <math>\\mathcal H</math>; according to [[Wigner's theorem]], this transformation of <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math> comes from a unitary or anti-unitary transformation <math>U(g)</math> of <math>\\mathcal H</math>. Note, however, that the <math>U(g)</math> associated to a given <math>V(g)</math> is not unique, but only unique ''up to a phase factor''. The composition of the operators <math>U(g)</math> should, therefore, reflect the composition law in <math>G</math>, but only up to a phase factor:\n\n:<math>U(gh)=e^{i\\theta}U(g)U(h)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> will depend on <math>g</math> and <math>h</math>. Thus, the map sending <math>g</math> to <math>U(g)</math> is a [[projective representation|''projective unitary representation'']] of <math>G</math>, or possibly a mixture of unitary and anti-unitary, if <math>G</math> is disconnected. In practice, anti-unitary operators are always associated with [[T-symmetry|time-reversal symmetry]].\n\n===Ordinary versus projective representations===\n\nIt is important physically that in general <math>U(\\cdot)</math> does not have to be an ordinary representation of <math>G</math>; it may not be possible to choose the phase factors in the definition of <math>U(g)</math> to eliminate the phase factors in their composition law. An electron, for example, is a spin-one-half particle; its Hilbert space consists of wave functions on <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> with values in a two-dimensional spinor space. The action of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on the spinor space is only projective: It does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math>. There is, however, an associated ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\mathrm{SU(2)}</math> of <math>\\mathrm{SO(3)}</math> on spinor space. <ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 4.7</ref>\n\nFor many interesting classes of groups <math>G</math>, [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] tells us that every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of <math>G</math>. Actually, if <math>\\mathcal H</math> is finite dimensional, then regardless of the group <math>G</math>, every projective unitary representation of <math>G</math> comes from an ordinary unitary representation of <math>\\tilde{G}</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2013}} Theorem 16.47</ref> If <math>\\mathcal H</math> is infinite dimensional, then to obtain the desired conclusion, some algebraic assumptions must be made on <math>G</math> (see below). In this setting the result is a [[Projective_representation#Bargmann's_theorem_on_infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|theorem of Bargmann]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bargmann | first1 = V. | year = 1954 | title = On unitary ray representations of continuous groups | url = | journal = Ann. of Math. | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 1–46 | doi=10.2307/1969831}}</ref> Fortunately, the crucial case of the Poincaré group, Bargmann's theorem applies.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|1995}} Chapter 2, Appendix A and B.</ref> (See [[Wigner's classification]] of the representations of the universal cover of the Poincaré group.)\n\nThe requirement referred to above is that the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> does not admit a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension. This is the case if and only if the [[Lie algebra extension#second cohomology group|second cohomology group]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is trivial. In this case, it may still be true that the group admits a central extension by a ''discrete'' group. But extensions of <math>G</math> by a discrete group are nothing but a covers of <math>G</math>. For instance, the universal cover <math>\\tilde G</math> is related to <math>G</math> through the quotient <math>G \\approx \\tilde G/\\Gamma</math> with the central subgroup <math>\\Gamma</math> being the center of <math>\\tilde G</math> itself, isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of the covered group.\n\nThus, in favorable cases, the quantum system will carry a unitary representation of the universal cover <math>\\tilde{G}</math> of the symmetry group <math>G</math>. This is desirable because <math>\\mathcal H</math> is much easier to work with than the non-vector space <math>\\mathrm P\\mathcal H</math>. If the representations of <math>\\tilde{G}</math> can be classified, much more information about the possibilities and properties of <math>\\mathcal H</math> are available.\n\n===The Heisenberg case===\nAn example in which Bargmann's theorem does not apply comes from a quantum particle moving in <math>\\mathbb R^n</math>. The group of translational symmetries of the associated phase space, <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, is the commutative group <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. In the usual quantum mechanical picture, the <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> symmetry is not implement by a unitary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>. After all, in the quantum setting, translations in position space and translations in momentum space do not commute. This failure to commute reflects the failure of the position and momentum operators—which are the infinitesimal generators of translations in momentum space and position space, respectively—to commute. Nevertheless, translations in position space and translations in momentum space ''do'' commute up to a phase factor. Thus, we have a well-defined projective representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, but it does not come from an ordinary representation of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>, even though <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math> is simply connected. \n\nIn this case, to obtain an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the [[Heisenberg group]], which is a nontrivial one-dimensional central extension of <math>\\mathbb R^{2n}</math>.\n\n== Poincaré group ==\n{{main|Wigner's classification}}\n\nThe group of translations and [[Lorentz transformations]] form the [[Poincaré group]], and this group should be a symmetry of a relativistic quantum system (neglecting [[general relativity]] effects, or in other words, in [[flat space]]). [[Representation theory of the Poincaré group|Representations of the Poincaré group]] are in many cases characterized by a nonnegative [[mass]] and a half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] (see [[Wigner's classification]]); this can be thought of as the reason that particles have quantized spin. (Note that there are in fact other possible representations, such as [[tachyon]]s, [[infraparticle]]s, etc., which in some cases do not have quantized spin or fixed mass.)\n\n== Other symmetries ==\n[[File:Standard Model charges.svg|300px|right|thumb|The pattern of [[weak isospin]]s, [[weak hypercharge]]s, and [[color charge|color]] charges (weights) of all known elementary particles in the [[Standard Model]], rotated by the [[weak mixing angle]] to show electric charge roughly along the vertical.]]\n\nWhile the [[spacetime symmetries]] in the Poincaré group are particularly easy to visualize and believe, there are also other types of symmetries, called [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]]. One example is [[color charge|color]] [[SU(3)]], an exact symmetry corresponding to the continuous interchange of the three [[quark]] colors.\n\n==Lie algebras versus Lie groups==\nMany (but not all) symmetries or approximate symmetries form [[Lie groups]]. Rather than study the [[Representation theory#Lie groups|representation theory]] of these Lie groups, it is often preferable to study the closely related [[Representation theory#Lie algebras|representation theory]] of the corresponding Lie algebras, which are usually simpler to compute.\n\nNow, representations of the Lie algebra correspond to representations of the [[Covering group|universal cover]] of the original group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 5.7</ref> In the [[Projective_representation#Finite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations|finite-dimensional case]]—and the infinite-dimensional case, provided that [[Projective_representation#Infinite-dimensional_projective_unitary_representations:_Bargmann's_theorem|Bargmann's theorem]] applies—irreducible projective representations of the original group correspond to ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover. In those cases, computing at the Lie algebra level is appropriate. This is the case, notably, for studying the irreducible projective representations of the rotation group SO(3). These are in one-to-one correspondence with the ordinary representations of the [[Rotation_group_SO(3)#Connection_between_SO(3)_and_SU(2)|universal cover SU(2) of SO(3)]]. The representations of the SU(2) are then in one-to-one correspondence with the representations of its Lie algebra su(2), which is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3). \n\nThus, to summarize, the irreducible projective representations of SO(3) are in one-to-one correspondence with the irreducible ordinary representations of its Lie algebra so(3). The two-dimensional \"spin 1/2\" representation of the Lie algebra so(3), for example, does not correspond to an ordinary (single-valued) representation of the group SO(3). (This fact is the origin of statements to the effect that \"if you rotate the wave function of an electron by 360 degrees, you get the negative of the original wave function.\") Nevertheless, the spin 1/2 representation does give rise to a well-defined ''projective'' representation of SO(3), which is all that is required physically.\n\n== Approximate symmetries ==\nAlthough the above symmetries are believed to be exact, other symmetries are only approximate.\n\n===Hypothetical example===\nAs an example of what an approximate symmetry means, suppose an experimentalist lived inside an infinite [[ferromagnet]], with magnetization in some particular direction. The experimentalist in this situation would find not one but two distinct types of electrons: one with spin along the direction of the magnetization, with a slightly lower energy (and consequently, a lower mass), and one with spin anti-aligned, with a higher mass. Our usual [[SO(3)]] rotational symmetry, which ordinarily connects the spin-up electron with the spin-down electron, has in this hypothetical case become only an ''approximate'' symmetry, relating ''different types of particles'' to each other.\n\n===General definition===\nIn general, an approximate symmetry arises when there are very strong interactions that obey that symmetry, along with weaker interactions that do not. In the electron example above, the two \"types\" of electrons behave identically under the [[strong force|strong]] and [[weak force]]s, but differently under the [[electromagnetic force]].\n\n===Example: isospin symmetry===\n{{main|Isospin}}\nAn example from the real world is [[isospin|isospin symmetry]], an [[SU(2)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s and [[down quark]]s. This is an approximate symmetry: While up and down quarks are identical in how they interact under the [[strong force]], they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector space\n:<math>\\text{up quark} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad \\text{down quark} \\rightarrow \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nand the laws of physics are ''approximately'' invariant under applying a determinant-1 [[unitary transformation]] to this space:<ref name=Thomson>[http://www.hep.phy.cam.ac.uk/~thomson/partIIIparticles/handouts/Handout_7_2011.pdf Lecture notes by Prof. Mark Thomson]</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} \\mapsto A \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{where } A \\text{ is in } SU(2)</math>\nFor example, <math>A=\\begin{pmatrix} 0&1 \\\\ -1&0 \\end{pmatrix}</math> would turn all up quarks in the universe into down quarks and vice versa. Some examples help clarify the possible effects of these transformations:\n*When these unitary transformations are applied to a [[proton]], it can be transformed into a [[neutron]], or into a superposition of a proton and neutron, but not into any other particles. Therefore, the transformations move the proton around a two-dimensional space of quantum states. The proton and neutron are called an \"[[isospin multiplet|isospin doublet]]\", mathematically analogous to how a [[spin-½]] particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n*When these unitary transformations are applied to any of the three [[pion]]s ({{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Pion+}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Pion-}}), it can change any of the pions into any other, but not into any non-pion particle. Therefore, the transformations move the pions around a three-dimensional space of quantum states. The pions are called an \"[[isospin multiplet|isospin triplet]]\", mathematically analogous to how a spin-1 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n*These transformations have no effect at all on an [[electron]], because it contains neither up nor down quarks. The electron is called an isospin singlet, mathematically analogous to how a spin-0 particle behaves under ordinary rotation.\n\nIn general, particles form [[isospin multiplet]]s, which correspond to irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(2)]]. Particles in an isospin multiplet have very similar but not identical masses, because the up and down quarks are very similar but not identical.\n\n===Example: flavour symmetry===\n{{main|eightfold way (physics)}}\n\nIsospin symmetry can be generalized to [[flavour symmetry]], an [[SU(3)]] group corresponding to the similarity between [[up quark]]s, [[down quark]]s, and [[strange quark]]s.<ref name=Thomson/> This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions—in fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the strange quark's noticeably higher mass.\n\nNevertheless, particles can indeed be neatly divided into groups that form irreducible representations of the [[Special unitary group#Lie algebra|Lie algebra SU(3)]], as first noted by [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and independently by [[Yuval Ne'eman]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Charge (physics)]]\n*[[Representation theory]]:\n**[[Representation theory#Lie algebras|Of Lie algebras]]\n**[[Representation theory#Lie groups|Of Lie groups]]\n*[[Projective representation]]\n*[[Special unitary group]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*Coleman, Sidney (1985) ''Aspects of Symmetry: Selected Erice Lectures of Sidney Coleman''.

      "text": "{{Lie groups |Semi-simple}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the notion of a '''real form''' relates objects defined over the [[Field (algebra)|field]] of [[Real number|real]] and [[Complex number|complex]] numbers. A real [[Lie algebra]] ''g''<sub>0</sub> is called a real form of a complex Lie algebra ''g'' if ''g'' is the [[complexification]] of ''g''<sub>0</sub>:\n\n: <math> \\mathfrak{g}\\simeq\\mathfrak{g}_0\\otimes_{\\mathbb{R}}\\mathbb{C}. </math>\n\nThe notion of a real form can also be defined for complex [[Lie group]]s. Real forms of complex [[semisimple Lie group]]s and Lie algebras have been completely classified by [[Élie Cartan]].\n\n== Real forms for Lie groups and algebraic groups ==\n\nUsing the [[Lie correspondence|Lie correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras]], the notion of a real form can be defined for Lie groups. In the case of [[linear algebraic group]]s, the notions of complexification and real form have a natural description in the language of [[algebraic geometry]].\n\n== Classification ==\n{{main|List of simple Lie groups}}\n\nJust as complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s are classified by [[Dynkin diagram]]s, the real forms of a semisimple Lie algebra are classified by [[Satake diagram]]s, which are obtained from the Dynkin diagram of the complex form by labeling some vertices black (filled), and connecting some other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules.\n\nIt is a basic fact in the structure theory of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s that every such algebra has two special real forms: one is the '''compact real form''' and corresponds to a compact Lie group under the Lie correspondence (its Satake diagram has all vertices blackened), and the other is the '''split real form''' and corresponds to a Lie group that is as far as possible from being compact (its Satake diagram has no vertices blackened and no arrows). In the case of the complex [[special linear group]] ''SL''(''n'','''C'''), the compact real form is the [[special unitary group]] ''SU''(''n'') and the split real form is the real special linear group ''SL''(''n'','''R'''). The classification of real forms of semisimple Lie algebras was accomplished by [[Élie Cartan]] in the context of [[Riemannian symmetric space]]s. In general, there may be more than two real forms.\n\nSuppose that ''g''<sub>0</sub> is a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] over the field of real numbers. By [[Cartan's criterion]], the Killing form is nondegenerate, and can be diagonalized in a suitable basis with the diagonal entries +1 or −1. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the number of positive entries, or the positive index of intertia, is an invariant of the bilinear form, i.e. it does not depend on the choice of the diagonalizing basis. This is a number between 0 and the dimension of ''g'' which is an important invariant of the real Lie algebra, called its '''index'''.\n\n===Split real form===\n{{see also|Split Lie algebra}}\nA real form ''g''<sub>0</sub> of a complex semisimple Lie algebra ''g'' is said to be '''[[Split Lie algebra|split]]''', or '''normal''', if in each [[Cartan decomposition]] ''g''<sub>0</sub> = ''k''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&oplus;&nbsp;''p''<sub>0</sub>, the space ''p''<sub>0</sub> contains a maximal Abelian subalgebra of ''g''<sub>0</sub>, i.e. its [[Cartan subalgebra]]. [[Élie Cartan]] proved that every complex semisimple Lie algebra ''g'' has a split real form, which is unique up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Helgason|1978|page=426}}</ref> It has maximal index among all real forms.\n\nThe split form corresponds to the [[Satake diagram]] with no vertices blackened and no arrows.\n\n===Compact real form===\n{{see also|Compact Lie algebra}}\nA real Lie algebra ''g''<sub>0</sub> is called '''[[compact Lie algebra|compact]]''' if the [[Killing form]] is [[negative definite]], i.e. the index of ''g''<sub>0</sub> is zero. In this case ''g''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''k''<sub>0</sub> is a [[compact Lie algebra]]. It is known that under the [[Lie correspondence]], compact Lie algebras correspond to [[compact Lie group]]s.\n\nThe compact form corresponds to the [[Satake diagram]] with all vertices blackened.\n\n== Construction of the compact real form ==\n\nIn general, the construction of the compact real form uses structure theory of semisimple Lie algebras. For [[classical Lie algebra]]s there is a more explicit construction.\n\nLet ''g''<sub>0</sub> be a real Lie algebra of matrices over '''R''' that is closed under the transpose map,\n\n: <math> X\\to {X}^{t}.</math>\n\nThen ''g''<sub>0</sub> decomposes into the direct sum of its [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric part]] ''k''<sub>0</sub> and its [[symmetric matrix|symmetric part]] ''p''<sub>0</sub>, this is the '''Cartan decomposition''':\n\n: <math>\\mathfrak{g}_0=\\mathfrak{k}_0\\oplus\\mathfrak{p}_0. </math>\n\nThe complexification ''g'' of ''g''<sub>0</sub> decomposes into the direct sum of ''g''<sub>0</sub> and ''ig''<sub>0</sub>. The real vector space of matrices\n\n: <math>\\mathfrak{u}_0=\\mathfrak{k}_0\\oplus i\\mathfrak{p}_0 </math>\n\nis a subspace of the complex Lie algebra ''g'' that is closed under the commutators and consists of [[skew-Hermitian matrix|skew-hermitian matrices]]. It follows that ''u''<sub>0</sub> is a real Lie subalgebra of ''g'', that its Killing form is [[negative definite]] (making it a compact Lie algebra), and that the complexification of ''u''<sub>0</sub> is ''g''. Therefore, ''u''<sub>0</sub> is a compact form of ''g''.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Complexification (Lie group)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{citation |first=Sigurdur |last=Helgason |title=Differential geometry, Lie groups and symmetric spaces |year=1978 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-338460-5}}\n*{{citation |first=Anthony |last=Knapp |title=Lie Groups: Beyond an Introduction |series=Progress in Mathematics |volume=140 |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2004 |isbn=0-8176-4259-5}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Real Form (Lie Theory)}}\n[[Category:Lie groups]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''regular element''' of a [[Lie algebra]] or [[Lie group]] is an element whose centralizer has dimension as small as possible. In the specific case of ''n''x''n'' matrices over an algebraically closed field (such as the [[complex number]]s), an element ''M'' is regular if and only if its [[Jordan normal form]] contains a single Jordan block for each eigenvalue. In that case, the centralizer is the set of polynomials of degree less than ''n'' evaluated at the matrix ''M'', and therefore the centralizer has dimension ''n'' (but it is not necessarily an algebraic torus).\n\nIf the matrix ''M'' is diagonalisable, then it is regular if and only if there are ''n'' different eigenvalues. To see this, notice that ''M'' will commute with any matrix ''P'' that stabilises each of its eigenspaces. If there are ''n'' different eigenvalues, then this happens only if ''P'' is diagonalisable on a same basis as ''M'' is, and in fact ''P'' is a linear combination of the first ''n'' powers of ''M'' in this case, so that the centralizer is an [[algebraic torus]] of complex dimension ''n'' (and of dimension ''2n'' as a real manifold); since this is the smallest possible dimension of a centralizer in this case, such a matrix ''M'' is regular. However if there are equal eigenvalues, then the centralizer, which is the product of the general linear groups of the eigenspaces of ''M'', has strictly larger dimension, and ''M'' is not regular in this case.  \n\nFor a connected [[compact Lie group]] ''G'', and its Lie algebra ''g'', the regular elements can also be described explicitly. In ''g'' they form an open and dense subset. In ''G'', the regular elements also form an open dense subset; and if ''T'' is a [[maximal torus]] of ''G'', the elements ''t'' of ''T'' that are regular in ''G'' determine the regular elements of ''G'', which make up the union of the [[conjugacy class]]es in ''G'' of regular elements in ''T''.

The concept is fundamental in the theory of [[Lie group]]s and [[Lie algebra]]s, especially the classification and representation theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. Since Lie groups (and some analogues such as [[algebraic group]]s) and Lie algebras have become important in many parts of mathematics during the twentieth century, the apparently special nature of root systems belies the number of areas in which they are applied.  Further, the classification scheme for root systems, by [[Dynkin diagram]]s, occurs in parts of mathematics with no overt connection to Lie theory (such as [[singularity theory]]).  Finally, root systems are important for their own sake, as in [[spectral graph theory]].<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379502003774 | doi=10.1016/S0024-3795(02)00377-4 | volume=356 | title=Graphs with least eigenvalue −2; a historical survey and recent developments in maximal exceptional graphs | journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications | pages=189–210}}</ref>\n\n==Definitions and examples==\n[[File:Root system A2 with labels.png|right|thumb|250px|The six vectors of the root system ''A''<sub>2</sub>.]]\nAs a first example, consider the six vectors in 2-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], '''R'''<sup>2</sup>, as shown in the image at the right; call them '''roots'''.

We say that <math>\\alpha\\in\\mathfrak{h}^*</math> is a '''root''' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> relative to <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> if <math>\\alpha\\neq 0</math> and there exists some <math>X\\neq 0\\in\\mathfrak{g}</math> such that\n:<math>[H,X]=\\alpha(H)X</math>\nfor all <math>H\\in\\mathfrak{h}</math>. One can show<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.5</ref> that there is an inner product for which the set of roots forms a root system. The root system of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a fundamental tool for analyzing the structure of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and classifying its representations. (See the section below on Root systems and Lie theory.)\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a root system was originally introduced by [[Wilhelm Killing]] around 1889 (in German, ''Wurzelsystem''<ref>Killing (1889)</ref>).<ref>Bourbaki (1998), p. 270</ref> He used them in his attempt to classify all [[simple Lie algebra]]s over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[complex number]]s. Killing originally made a mistake in the classification, listing two exceptional rank 4 root systems, when in fact there is only one, now known as F<sub>4</sub>. Cartan later corrected this mistake, by showing Killing's two root systems were isomorphic.<ref>Coleman, p.34</ref>\n\nKilling investigated the structure of a Lie algebra <math>L</math>, by considering what is now called a [[Cartan subalgebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. Then he studied the roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]] <math>\\det (\\operatorname{ad}_L x - t)</math>, where <math>x \\in \\mathfrak{h}</math>. Here a ''root'' is considered as a function of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, or indeed as an element of the dual vector space <math>\\mathfrak{h}^*</math>. This set of roots form a root system inside <math>\\mathfrak{h}^*</math>, as defined above, where the inner product is the [[Killing form]].<ref>Bourbaki (1998), p.270</ref>\n\n==Elementary consequences of the root system axioms==\n[[Image:Integrality of root systems.svg|thumb|500px|right|The integrality condition for <math>\\langle\\beta, \\alpha \\rangle</math> is fulfilled only for ''&beta;'' on one of the vertical lines, while the integrality condition for <math>\\langle\\alpha, \\beta \\rangle</math> is fulfilled only for ''&beta;'' on one of the red circles. Any &beta; perpendicular to ''&alpha;'' (on the ''Y'' axis) trivially fulfills both with 0, but does not define an irreducible root system. <br>Modulo reflection, for a given ''&alpha;'' there are only 5 nontrivial possibilities for ''&beta;'', and 3 possible angles between ''&alpha;'' and ''&beta;'' in a set of simple roots. Subscript letters correspond to the series of root systems for which the given ''&beta;'' can serve as the first root and &alpha; as the second root (or in ''F<sub>4</sub>'' as the middle 2 roots).]]\n\n<!--\nThe integrality condition also means that the ratio of the lengths (magnitudes) of any two non-perpendicular roots cannot be 2 or greater, since otherwise either the projection of the shorter root onto the longer root will be less than half as long as the longer root, or the shorter root will be exactly half the longer root or its negative.\n-->\n\nThe cosine of the angle between two roots is constrained to be a [[Half-integer|half-integral]] multiple of a square root of an integer. This is because <math> \\langle \\beta, \\alpha \\rangle</math> and <math>\\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle</math> are both integers, by assumption, and\n\n: <math> \\langle \\beta, \\alpha \\rangle  \\langle \\alpha, \\beta \\rangle  = 2 \\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)} \\cdot 2 \\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)}{(\\beta,\\beta)} = 4 \\frac{(\\alpha,\\beta)^2}{\\vert \\alpha \\vert^2 \\vert \\beta \\vert^2} = 4 \\cos^2(\\theta) = (2\\cos(\\theta))^2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}.</math>\n\nSince <math>2\\cos(\\theta) \\in [-2,2]</math>, the only possible values for <math>\\cos(\\theta)</math> are <math>0, \\pm \\tfrac{1}{2}, \\pm\\tfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\pm\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}</math> and <math>\\pm\\tfrac{\\sqrt{4}}{2} = \\pm 1</math>, corresponding to angles of 90°, 60° or 120°, 45° or 135°, 30° or 150°, and 0° or 180°. Condition 2 says that no scalar multiples of ''α'' other than 1 and −1 can be roots, so 0 or 180°, which would correspond to 2''α'' or  −2''α'', are out. The diagram at right shows that an angle of 60° or 120° corresponds to roots of equal length, while an angle of 45° or 135° corresponds to a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt{2}</math> and an angle of 30° or 150° corresponds to a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt{3}</math>. \n\nIn summary, here are the only possibilities for each pair of roots.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.6</ref>\n*Angle of 90 degrees; in that case, the length ratio is unrestricted.\n*Angle of 60 or 120 degrees, with a length ratio of 1.\n*Angle of 45 or 135 degrees, with a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt 2</math>.\n*Angle of 30 or 150 degrees, with a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt 3</math>.\n\n==Positive roots and simple roots==\n[[File:Base_for_the_G2_root_system.png|thumb|right|The labeled roots are a set of positive roots for the <math>G_2</math> root system, with <math>\\alpha_1</math> and <math>\\alpha_2</math> being the simple roots]]\nGiven a root system <math>\\Phi</math> we can always choose (in many ways) a set of '''positive roots'''.

A set of positive roots may be constructed by choosing a hyperplane <math>V</math> not containing any root and setting <math>\\Phi^+</math> to be all the roots lying on a fixed side of <math>V</math>. Furthermore, every set of positive roots arises in this way.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorems 8.16 and 8.17</ref>\n\nAn element of <math>\\Phi^+</math> is called a '''simple root''' if it cannot be written as the sum of two elements of <math>\\Phi^+</math>. (The set of simple roots is also referred to as a '''base''' for <math>\\Phi</math>.)  The set <math>\\Delta</math> of simple roots is a basis of <math>E</math> with the following additional special properties:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 8.16</ref>\n*Every root <math>\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math> is a linear combination of elements of <math>\\Delta</math> with ''integer'' coefficients.\n*For each <math>\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math>, the coefficients in the previous point are either all non-negative or all non-positive. \n\nFor each root system <math>\\Phi</math> there are many different choices of the set of positive roots—or, equivalently, of the simple roots—but any two sets of positive roots differ by the action of the Weyl group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.28</ref>\n\n==Dual root system, coroots, and integral elements==\n{{see also|Langlands dual group}}\n===The dual root system===\nIf Φ is a root system in ''E'', the '''coroot''' α<sup>∨</sup> of a root α is defined by\n\n:<math>\\alpha^\\vee= {2\\over (\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\, \\alpha.</math>\n\nThe set of coroots also forms a root system Φ<sup>∨</sup> in ''E'', called the '''dual root system''' (or sometimes ''inverse root system'').\nBy definition,  α<sup>∨ ∨</sup> = α, so that Φ is the dual root system of Φ<sup>∨</sup>. The lattice in ''E'' spanned by  Φ<sup>∨</sup> is called the ''coroot lattice''. Both Φ and Φ<sup>∨</sup> have the same Weyl group ''W'' and, for ''s'' in ''W'',\n\n:<math> (s\\alpha)^\\vee= s(\\alpha^\\vee).</math>\n\nIf Δ is a set of simple roots for Φ, then Δ<sup>∨</sup> is a set of simple roots for Φ<sup>∨</sup>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.18</ref>\n\nIn the classification described below, the root systems of type <math>A_n</math> and <math>D_n</math> along with the exceptional root systems <math>E_6,E_7,E_8,F_4,G_2</math> are all self-dual, meaning that the dual root system is isomorphic to the original root system. By contrast, the <math>B_n</math> and <math>C_n</math> root systems are dual to one another, but not isomorphic (except when <math>n=2</math>).\n\n===Integral elements===\n{{see also|Weight (representation theory)#Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras}}\nA vector <math>\\lambda</math> in ''E'' is called '''integral'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 8.7</ref> if its inner product with each coroot is an integer:\n:<math>2\\frac{(\\lambda,\\alpha)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\in\\mathbb Z,\\quad\\alpha\\in\\Phi.</math>\nSince the set of <math>\\alpha^\\vee </math> with <math>\\alpha\\in\\Delta</math> forms a base for the dual root system, to verify that <math>\\lambda</math> is integral, it suffices to check the above condition for <math>\\alpha\\in\\Delta</math>. \n\nThe set of integral elements is called the '''weight lattice''' associated to the given root system. This term comes from the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras]], where the integral elements form the possible weights of finite-dimensional representations.\n\nThe definition of a root system guarantees that the roots themselves are integral elements. Thus, every integer linear combination of roots is also integral. In most cases, however, there will be integral elements that are not integer combinations of roots. That is to say, in general the weight lattice does not coincide with the root lattice.\n\n==Classification of root systems by Dynkin diagrams==\n{{see also|Dynkin diagram}}\n[[File:Finite Dynkin diagrams.svg|480px|thumb|Pictures of all the connected Dynkin diagrams]]\n\nA root system is irreducible if it can not be partitioned into the union of two proper subsets <math>\\Phi=\\Phi_1\\cup\\Phi_2</math>, such that <math>(\\alpha,\\beta)=0</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\in\\Phi_1</math> and <math>\\beta\\in\\Phi_2</math> .\n\nIrreducible root systems [[bijection|correspond]] to certain [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]], the '''[[Dynkin diagram]]s''' named after [[Eugene Dynkin]]. The classification of these graphs is a simple matter of [[combinatorics]], and induces a classification of irreducible root systems.\n\n===Constructing the Dynkin diagram===\n\nGiven a root system, select a set Δ of [[root system#Positive roots and simple roots|simple roots]] as in the preceding section. The vertices of the associated Dynkin diagram correspond to the roots in Δ.  Edges are drawn between vectors as follows, according to the angles. (Note that the angle between simple roots is always at least 90 degrees.)\n*No edge if the vectors are orthogonal,\n*An undirected single edge if they make an angle of 120 degrees,\n*A directed double edge if they make an angle of 135 degrees, and \n*A directed triple edge if they make an angle of 150 degrees.  \nThe term \"directed edge\" means that double and triple edges are marked with an arrow pointing toward the shorter vector. (Thinking of the arrow as a \"greater than\" sign makes it clear which way the arrow is supposed to point.) \n\nNote that by the elementary properties of roots noted above, the rules for creating the Dynkin diagram can also be described as follows. No edge if the roots are orthogonal; for nonorthogonal roots, a single, double, or triple edge according to whether the length ratio of the longer to shorter is 1, <math>\\sqrt 2</math>, <math>\\sqrt 3</math>. In the case of the <math>G_2</math> root system for example, there are two simple roots at an angle of 150 degrees (with a length ratio of <math>\\sqrt 3</math>). Thus, the Dynkin diagram has two vertices joined by a triple edge, with an arrow pointing from the vertex associated to the longer root to the other vertex. (In this case, the arrow is a bit redundant, since the diagram is equivalent whichever way the arrow goes.)\n\n===Classifying root systems===\nAlthough a given root system has more than one possible set of simple roots, the [[Weyl group]] acts transitively on such choices.<ref>This follows from {{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.23</ref> Consequently, the Dynkin diagram is independent of the choice of simple roots; it is determined by the root system itself. Conversely, given two root systems with the same Dynkin diagram, one can match up roots, starting with the roots in the base, and show that the systems are in fact the same.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.32</ref>\n\nThus the problem of classifying root systems reduces to the problem of classifying possible Dynkin diagrams. A root systems is irreducible if and only if its Dynkin diagrams is connected.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.23</ref> The possible connected diagrams are as indicated in the figure. The subscripts indicate the number of vertices in the diagram (and hence the rank of the corresponding irreducible root system).\n\nIf <math>\\Phi</math> is a root system, the Dynkin diagram for the dual root system <math>\\Phi^\\vee</math> is obtained from the Dynkin diagram of <math>\\Phi</math> by keeping all the same vertices and edges, but reversing the directions of all arrows. Thus, we can see from their Dynkin diagrams that <math>B_n</math> and <math>C_n</math> are dual to each other.\n\n==Weyl chambers and the Weyl group==\n{{see also|Coxeter group#Affine Coxeter groups}}\n[[File:Weyl_chambers_for_A2.png|thumb|right|The shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber for the base <math>\\{\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\}</math>]]\nIf <math>\\Phi\\subset E</math> is a root system, we may consider the hyperplane perpendicular to each root <math>\\alpha</math>. Recall that <math>\\sigma_\\alpha</math> denotes the reflection about the hyperplane and that the [[Weyl group]] is the group of transformations of <math>E</math> generated by all the <math>\\sigma_\\alpha</math>'s. The complement of the set of hyperplanes is disconnected, and each connected component is called a '''Weyl chamber'''. If we have fixed a particular set Δ of simple roots, we may define the '''fundamental Weyl chamber''' associated to Δ as the set of points <math>v\\in E</math> such that <math>(\\alpha,v)>0</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\in\\Delta</math>. \n\nSince the reflections <math>\\sigma_\\alpha,\\,\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math> preserve <math>\\Phi</math>, they also preserve the set of hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. Thus, each Weyl group element permutes the Weyl chambers.\n\nThe figure illustrates the case of the <math>A_2</math> root system. The \"hyperplanes\" (in this case, one dimensional) orthogonal to the roots are indicated by dashed lines. The six 60-degree sectors are the Weyl chambers and the shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to the indicated base.\n\nA basic general theorem about Weyl chambers is this:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Propositions 8.23 and 8.27</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': The Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. Thus, the order of the Weyl group is equal to the number of Weyl chambers.\nIn the <math>A_2</math> case, for example, the Weyl group has six elements and there are six Weyl chambers.\n\nA related result is this one:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.29</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': Fix a Weyl chamber <math>C</math>. Then for all <math>v\\in E</math>, the Weyl-orbit of <math>v</math> contains exactly one point in the closure <math>\\bar C</math> of <math>C</math>.\n\n==Root systems and Lie theory==\nIrreducible root systems classify a number of related objects in Lie theory, notably the following:\n*[[Simple Lie algebra|simple complex Lie algebras]] (see the discussion above on root systems arising from semisimple Lie algebras),\n*[[simply connected]] complex Lie groups which are simple modulo centers, and\n*[[simply connected]] [[compact group|compact Lie groups]] which are simple modulo centers.\nIn each case, the roots are non-zero [[weight (representation theory)|weight]]s of the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].\n\nWe now give a brief indication of how irreducible root systems classify simple Lie algebras over <math>\\mathbb C</math>, following the arguments in Humphreys.<ref>See various parts of Chapters III, IV, and V of {{harvnb|Humphreys|1972}}, culminating in Section 19 in Chapter V</ref> A preliminary result says that a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] is simple if and only if the associated root system is irreducible.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}}, Theorem 7.35</ref> We thus restrict attention to irreducible root systems and simple Lie algebras.\n\n*First, we must establish that for each simple algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> there is only one root system. This assertion follows from the result that the Cartan subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is unique up to automorphism,<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1972}}, Section 16</ref> from which it follows that any two Cartan subalgebras give isomorphic root systems. \n*Next, we need to show that for each irreducible root system, there can be at most one Lie algebra, that is, that the root system determines the Lie algebra up to isomorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1972}} Part (b) of Theorem 18.4</ref> \n*Finally, we must show that for each irreducible root system, there is an associated simple Lie algebra. This claim is obvious for the root systems of type A, B, C, and D, for which the associated Lie algebras are the classical algebras. It is then possible to analyze the exceptional algebras in a case-by-case fashion. Alternatively, one can develop a systematic procedure for building a Lie algebra from a root system, using [[Root_system_of_a_semi-simple_Lie_algebra#Serre.27s_relations:_Associating_a_semisimple_Lie_algebra_to_a_root_system|Serre's relations]].<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1972}} Section 18.3 and Theorem 18.4</ref>\n\nFor connections between the exceptional root systems and their Lie groups and Lie algebras see [[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], [[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]].\n\n==Properties of the irreducible root systems==\n{|border=1 cellpadding=4  align=\"right\" style=\"margin: 1em; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n!<math>\\Phi</math> || <math>|\\Phi|</math> || <math>|\\Phi^{<}|</math> || ''I'' || ''D'' || <math>|W|</math>\n|-\n|A<sub>''n''</sub> (''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;1) || ''n''(''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) || &nbsp; ||&nbsp; || ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 || (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)!\n|-\n|B<sub>''n''</sub> (''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2) || 2''n''<sup>2</sup> || 2''n''||  2  || 2 || 2<sup>''n''</sup> ''n''!\n|-\n|C<sub>''n''</sub> (''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;3) || 2''n''<sup>2</sup> || 2''n''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)||  2<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup>  || 2 || 2<sup>''n''</sup> ''n''!\n|-\n|D<sub>''n''</sub> (''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;4) || 2''n''(''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1) || &nbsp;||&nbsp; || 4 || 2<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup> ''n''!\n|-\n|[[E6 (mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]] || 72 || &nbsp; ||&nbsp;|| 3 || 51840\t\n|-\n|[[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] || 126 || &nbsp; ||&nbsp;|| 2 || 2903040\t\n|-\n|[[E8 (mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]] || 240 || &nbsp;||&nbsp; || 1 || 696729600\n|-\n|[[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]] || 48 || 24||  4  || 1 || 1152\n|-\n|[[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]] || 12 || 6 ||  3  || 1 || 12\n|}\n\nIrreducible root systems are named according to their corresponding connected Dynkin diagrams.

The subscript indicates the rank of the root system.\n\nIn an irreducible root system there can be at most two values for the length (''α'',&nbsp;''α'')<sup>1/2</sup>, corresponding to '''short''' and '''long''' roots. If all roots have the same length they are taken to be long by definition and the root system is said to be '''simply laced'''; this occurs in the cases A, D and E. Any two roots of the same length lie in the same orbit of the Weyl group.

Here the construction of a '''root system of a semisimple Lie algebra'''{{spaced ndash}}and, conversely, the construction of a semisimple Lie algebra from a reduced crystallographic root system{{spaced ndash}}are shown.\n\n==Associating a root system to a semisimple Lie algebra==\n\nLet <math>\\mathfrak g</math> be a complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]].  Let further <math>\\mathfrak h</math> be a [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|Cartan subalgebra]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.  Then <math>\\mathfrak h</math> acts on <math>\\mathfrak g</math> via simultaneously [[diagonalizable]] linear maps in the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].  For {{math|''λ''}} in <math>\\mathfrak h^*,</math> define the subspace <math>\\mathfrak g_\\lambda\\subset\\mathfrak g</math> by\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{g}_\\lambda := \\{X\\in\\mathfrak{g}: [H,X]=\\lambda(H)X\\text{ for all }H\\in\\mathfrak{h}\\}. </math>\n\nWe say that <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h^*</math> is a '''root''' if <math>\\lambda\\neq 0</math> and the subspace <math>\\mathfrak g_\\lambda</math> is nonzero. In this case <math>\\mathfrak g_\\lambda</math> is called the '''root space''' of {{math|''λ''}}. For each root <math>\\lambda</math>, the root space <math>\\mathfrak g_\\lambda</math> is one-dimensional.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 7.23</ref> Meanwhile, the definition of Cartan subalgebra guarantees that <math>\\mathfrak g_0=\\mathfrak h</math>. \n\nLet {{math|''R''}} be the set of all roots.  Since the elements of <math>\\mathfrak h</math> are simultaneously diagonalizable, we have\n\n:<math>\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{h}\\oplus\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in R}\\mathfrak{g}_\\lambda.</math>\n\nThe [[Cartan subalgebra]] <math>\\mathfrak h</math> inherits a nondegenerate bilinear form from the [[Killing form]] on <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. This form induces a form on <math>\\mathfrak h^*</math> and the restriction of that form to the real span of the roots is an inner product. One can show that with respect to this inner product {{math|''R''}} is a reduced crystallographic root system.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 7.30</ref>\n\n==Associating a semisimple Lie algebra to a root system==\n==={{Anchor|Serre's relations: Associating a semisimple Lie algebra to a root system|Serre's relations}}The relations===\nLet {{math|''E''}} be a [[Euclidean space]] and {{math|''R''}} a reduced crystallographic root system in {{math|''E''}}.  Let moreover {{math|Δ}} be a choice of [[root system#Positive roots and simple roots|simple roots]].  We define a complex Lie algebra over the generators\n\n:<math>H_\\lambda,X_\\lambda,Y_\\lambda\\text{ for }\\lambda\\in\\Delta</math>\n\nwith the Chevalley–Serre relations<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Section 18.1</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{align}[][H_\\lambda,H_\\mu] &=0 \\text{ for all }\\lambda,\\mu\\in\\Delta,\\\\\n\\left[H_\\lambda,X_\\mu\\right] &= C_{\\mu,\\lambda}X_\\mu,\\\\\n\\left[H_\\lambda,Y_\\mu\\right] &= -C_{\\mu,\\lambda}Y_\\mu,\\\\\n\\left[X_\\mu,Y_\\lambda\\right] &= \\delta_{\\mu\\lambda}H_\\mu,\\\\\n\\mathrm{ad}_{X_\\lambda}^{1-C_{\\mu,\\lambda}}(X_\\mu) &= 0\\text{ for }\\lambda\\ne\\mu,\\\\\n\\mathrm{ad}_{Y_\\lambda}^{1-C_{\\mu,\\lambda}}(Y_\\mu) &= 0\\text{ for }\\lambda\\ne\\mu.\\end{align}</math>\n\nHere <math>C_{\\lambda,\\mu}</math> is the coefficient of the [[Cartan matrix]], given by\n:<math>C_{\\lambda,\\mu}=2\\frac{(\\lambda,\\mu)}{(\\mu,\\mu)}</math>.\nNote that if <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> are in <math>\\Delta</math> with <math>\\lambda\\neq\\mu</math>, then <math>(\\lambda,\\mu)\\leq 0</math>, so that <math>C_{\\lambda,\\mu}</math> is a non-positive integer and <math>1-C_{\\lambda,\\mu}</math> is a positive integer.\n\n===Finding generators with these relations===\nNow, if we are ''given'' a semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> with root system <math>R</math>, it is not particularly difficult to find a set of generators for <math>\\mathfrak g</math> satisfying the above relations.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Proposition 18.1</ref> For each simple root <math>\\lambda\\in\\Delta</math>, we can find <math>X_\\lambda</math> in the root space <math>\\mathfrak g_\\lambda</math>, <math>Y_\\lambda</math> in the root space <math>\\mathfrak g_{-\\lambda}</math> and <math>H_\\lambda</math> in the Cartan subalgebra satisfying the standard <math>\\mathrm{sl}(2;\\mathbb C)</math> relations: <math>[H_\\lambda,X_\\lambda]=2X_\\lambda</math>, <math>[H_\\lambda,Y_\\lambda]=-2Y_\\lambda</math>, and <math>[X_\\lambda,Y_\\lambda]=H_\\lambda</math>. These will be our generators.\n\nNow, the element <math>H_\\lambda</math> is the ''coroot'' associated to <math>\\lambda</math>, which means that after we identify <math>\\mathfrak h</math> with its dual, we have <math>H_\\lambda=2\\lambda/(\\lambda,\\lambda).</math><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Equation (7.9)</ref> Then we have, for example,\n:<math>[H_\\lambda,X_\\mu]=(\\mu,H_\\lambda)X_\\mu=2\\frac{(\\mu,\\lambda)}{(\\lambda,\\lambda)}X_\\mu=C_{\\mu,\\lambda}X_\\mu.</math>\nThis sort of reasoning verifies the first four relations above. \n\nThe last two relations hold because <math>[X_\\lambda,X_\\mu]</math> belongs to the root space <math>\\mathfrak g_{\\lambda+\\mu}</math>, and more generally, <math>\\mathrm{ad}_{X_\\lambda}^{k}(X_\\mu)</math> belongs to <math>\\mathfrak g_{k\\lambda+\\mu}</math>. But, as we shall see momentarily, if <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\n\\mu</math> are simple roots, then <math>k\\lambda+\\mu</math> is not a root if <math>k=1-C_{\\mu,\\lambda}</math>, so that <math>\\mathrm{ad}_{X_\\lambda}^{k}(X_\\mu)</math> must be zero. To see that <math>k\\lambda+\\mu</math> is not a root, note that if <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> are distinct elements of <math>\\Delta</math>, then <math>-\\lambda+\\mu</math> cannot be a root, for this would violate one of the defining properties of a base—that the expansion of a root in terms of the base cannot have both positive and negative coefficients. But then if <math>s_\\lambda</math> is the reflection associated to <math>\\lambda</math>, we can easily calculate that \n:<math>s_\\lambda\\cdot(-\\lambda+\\mu)=\\lambda+\\mu-C_{\\mu,\\lambda}\\lambda=k\\lambda+\\mu</math>.\nThen since <math>-\\lambda+\\mu</math> is not a root, neither is <math>k\\lambda+\\mu</math>.\n\nNote that the elements <math>\\{X_\\lambda,Y_\\lambda,H_\\lambda\\},\\,\\lambda\\in\\Delta,</math> ''do not'' span <math>\\mathfrak g</math> as a vector space, because <math>\\lambda</math> does not range over all the positive roots, but only over the base. Nevertheless, these elements generate <math>\\mathfrak g</math> as a Lie algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Section 18.3</ref>\n\n===Serre's theorem===\nSerre's theorem asserts much more than just the existence of such generators for a given semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. First, the claim is that the above relations completely determine <math>\\mathfrak g</math>; that is, there are no other relations in <math>\\mathfrak g</math> besides ones that follow from these. Even more, however, Serre's theorem asserts that starting from an arbitrary root system—not assumed to come from a semisimple Lie algebra—we can use the above relations to ''define'' a Lie algebra, the Lie algebra is finite-dimensional and semisimple, and the root system of that Lie algebra is the root system <math>R</math> we started from.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Section 18.3</ref> \n\nA consequence of Serre's theorem is this: \n*Every (reduced, crystallographic) root system comes from a semisimple Lie algebra.\n\n== Application to the classification of semisimple Lie algebras ==\nThe preceding results help in the process of reducing the classification of semisimple Lie algebras to the task of classifying reduced crystallographic root systems, which is then done in terms of [[Dynkin diagram]]s. Although the above describes how to construct a root system from a Lie algebra and vice versa, there are still two things to prove before we can obtain a one-to-one correspondence. \n*First, we need to know that each Lie algebra gives only one root system (up to isomorphism). This is shown by proving that the Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is unique up to automorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Corollary 16.4</ref> It follows that all Cartan subalgebras of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> give isomorphic root systems.\n*Second, we must prove that each root system gives only one Lie algebra (up to isomorphism). That is, we must show that if two Lie algebras have isomorphic root systems, the Lie algebras are also isomorphic.<ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Theorem 14.2</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Semisimple Lie algebra]]\n*[[Root system]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{PlanetMath attribution |id=7338 |title=Root system underlying a semi-simple Lie algebra}}\n* {{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n*{{Citation|last=Humphreys|first=James|title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=9|publisher=Springer|year=1973}}\n* V.S.

      "text": "In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] study of [[Lie algebra]]s and [[Lie group]]s, a '''Satake diagram''' is a generalization of a [[Dynkin diagram]] introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Ichirô Satake|last=Satake|year=1960|loc=p.109}} whose configurations classify [[semisimple Lie algebra|simple]] Lie algebras over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real number]]s. The Satake diagrams associated to a Dynkin diagram classify [[real form (Lie theory)|real forms]] of the complex Lie algebra corresponding to the Dynkin diagram.\n\nMore generally, the '''Tits index''' or '''Satake–Tits diagram''' of a reductive [[algebraic group]] over a field is a generalization of the Satake diagram to arbitrary fields, introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Tits|authorlink=Jacques Tits|year=1966}}, that reduces the classification of reductive algebraic groups to that of [[Linear algebraic group#Examples|anisotropic]] [[Reductive group|reductive]] algebraic groups.\n\nSatake diagrams are not the same as [[Vogan diagram]]s of a Lie group, although they look similar.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nA Satake diagram is obtained from a Dynkin diagram by blackening some vertices, and connecting other vertices in pairs by arrows, according to certain rules.\n\nSuppose that ''G'' is an algebraic group defined over a field ''k'', such as the reals. We let ''S'' be a maximal split torus in ''G'', and take ''T'' to be a maximal torus containing ''S'' defined over the separable algebraic closure ''K'' of ''k''. Then ''G''(''K'') has a Dynkin diagram with respect to some choice of positive roots of ''T''. This Dynkin diagram has a natural action of the Galois group of ''K''/''k''. Also some of the simple roots vanish on ''S''. The '''Satake–Tits diagram''' is given by the Dynkin diagram ''D'', together with the action of the Galois group, with the simple roots vanishing on ''S'' colored black. In the case when ''k'' is the field of real numbers, the absolute Galois group has order 2, and its action on ''D'' is represented by drawing conjugate points of the Dynkin diagram near each other, and the Satake–Tits diagram is called a Satake diagram.\n\n== Examples ==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}\n* [[Compact Lie algebra]]s correspond to the Satake diagram with all vertices blackened.\n* [[Split Lie algebra]]s correspond to the Satake diagram with only white (i.e., non blackened) and unpaired vertices.\n* A table can be found at {{Harv|Onishchik|Vinberg|1994|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l8nJCNiIQAAC&pg=PA229 Table 4, pp. 229–230]}}.\n\n== Differences between Satake and Vogan diagrams ==\nBoth Satake and [[Vogan diagram]]s are used to classify semisimple Lie groups or algebras (or algebraic groups) over the reals and both consist of Dynkin diagrams enriched by blackening a subset of the nodes and connecting some pairs of vertices by arrows.  Satake diagrams, however, can be generalized to any field (see above) and fall under the general paradigm of [[Galois cohomology]], whereas Vogan diagrams are defined specifically over the reals.  Generally speaking, the structure of a real semisimple Lie algebra is encoded in a more transparent way in its Satake diagram, but Vogan diagrams are simpler to classify.\n\nThe essential difference is that the Satake diagram of a real semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with [[Cartan decomposition|Cartan involution]] ''θ'' and associated Cartan pair <math>\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{k} \\oplus \\mathfrak{p}</math> (the +1 and −1 eigenspaces of ''θ'') is defined by starting from a maximally noncompact ''θ''-stable [[Cartan subalgebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>, that is, one for which <math>\\theta(\\mathfrak{h})=\\mathfrak{h}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{h}\\cap\\mathfrak{k}</math> is as small as possible (in the presentation above, <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> appears as the Lie algebra of the maximal split torus ''S''), whereas Vogan diagrams are defined starting from a maximally compact ''θ''-stable Cartan subalgebra, that is, one for which <math>\\theta(\\mathfrak{h})=\\mathfrak{h}</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{h}\\cap\\mathfrak{k}</math> is as large as possible.\n\nThe unadorned Dynkin diagram (i.e., that with only white nodes and no arrows), when interpreted as a Satake diagram, represents the split real form of the Lie algebra, whereas it represents the compact form when interpreted as a Vogan diagram.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Relative root system]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Bump | first1=Daniel | title=Lie groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-21154-1 |mr=2062813 | year=2004 | volume=225 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-4094-3}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Helgason | first1=Sigurdur | title=Differential geometry, Lie groups, and symmetric spaces | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-2848-9 |mr=1834454 | year=2001 | volume=34 | doi=10.1090/gsm/034}}\n* {{Citation | title=Lie groups and Lie algebras III: structure of Lie groups and Lie algebras | first1=A.

      "text": "{{refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n{{Lie groups}}\n\nIn [[group theory]], a '''simple Lie group''' is a [[connected space|connected]] [[nonabelian group|non-abelian]] [[Lie group]] ''G'' which does not have nontrivial connected [[normal subgroups]].\n\nA '''simple Lie algebra''' is a non-abelian [[Lie algebra]] whose only [[Lie_algebra#Subalgebras,_ideals_and_homomorphisms|ideals]] are 0 and itself (or equivalently, a Lie algebra of dimension 2 or more, whose only ideals are 0 and itself).\n\nSimple Lie groups are a class of [[Lie groups]] which play a role in Lie group theory similar to that of [[simple group]]s in the theory of discrete groups. Essentially, simple Lie groups are connected Lie groups which cannot be decomposed as an extension of smaller connected Lie groups, and which are not [[Abelian group|commutative]]. \n\nTogether with the commutative Lie group of the real numbers, <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>, and that of the unit complex numbers, U(1), simple Lie groups give the atomic \"blocks\" that make up all (finite-dimensional) connected Lie groups via the operation of [[group extension]]. Many commonly encountered Lie groups are either simple or close to being simple: for example, the group SL(''n'') of ''n'' by ''n'' matrices with determinant equal to 1 is simple for all ''n''&nbsp;> 1.\n\nAn equivalent definition of a simple Lie group follows from the [[Lie correspondence]]: a connected Lie group is simple if its [[Lie algebra]] is simple. An important technical point is that\na simple Lie group may contain ''discrete'' normal subgroups, hence being a simple Lie group is different from being [[simple group|simple as an abstract group]].\n\nSimple Lie groups include many [[classical Lie group]]s, which provide a group-theoretic underpinning for [[spherical geometry]], [[projective geometry]] and related geometries in the sense of [[Felix Klein]]'s [[Erlangen program]]. It emerged in the course of [[list of simple Lie groups|classification]] of simple Lie groups that there exist also several [[exceptional object|exceptional]] possibilities not corresponding to any familiar geometry. These ''exceptional groups'' account for many special examples and configurations in other branches of mathematics, as well as contemporary [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==Simple complex Lie groups== \nAll (locally compact, connected) Lie groups are smooth [[manifolds]]. Mathematicians often study [[complex Lie group]]s, which are Lie groups with a [[Complex manifold|complex structure]] on the underlying manifold, which is required to be compatible with the group operations. A [[complex Lie group]] is called simple if it is connected as a topological space and its Lie algebra is simple as a complex Lie algebra. Note that the underlying Lie group may not be simple, although it will still be semisimple (see below).\n\n==Semisimple and reductive groups==\nIt is often useful to study slightly more general classes of Lie groups than simple groups, namely [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] or, more generally, [[Reductive group|reductive]] Lie groups. A connected Lie group is called semisimple if its Lie algebra is a [[semisimple lie algebra]], i.e. a direct sum of simple Lie algebras. It is called [[Reductive group|reductive]] if its Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple and trivial (one-dimensional) Lie algebras. Reductive groups occur naturally as symmetries of a number of mathematical objects in algebra, geometry, and physics. For example, the group <math>GL_n(\\mathbb{R})</math> of symmetries of an ''n''-dimensional real [[vector space]] (equivalently, the group of invertible matrices) is reductive.\n\n==Representation theory==\nA topological [[group homomorphism]] from a Lie group <math>G</math> to a matrix group is called a ''representation'' of <math>G</math>, and representations of simple Lie groups are the building blocks of the branch of mathematics called [[representation theory]]. Finite-dimensional representations of simple groups split into direct sums of [[irreducible representation]]s, which are classified by vectors in the [[Weight (representation theory)|weight lattice]] satisfying certain properties.\n\n==Classification of simple Lie groups==\n{{Main|List of simple Lie groups}}\n\n===Full classification===\nSimple Lie groups are fully classified. The classification is usually stated in several steps, namely:\n* [[Semisimple Lie algebra#Classification|Classification of simple complex Lie algebras]] The classification of simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers by [[Dynkin diagrams]].\n* [[Satake diagram|Classification of simple real Lie algebras]] Each simple complex Lie algebra has several [[Real form (Lie theory)|real forms]], classified by additional decorations of its Dynkin diagram called [[Satake diagram]]s, after [[Ichirô Satake]].\n* '''Classification of centerless simple Lie groups''' For every (real or complex) simple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, there is a unique \"centerless\" simple Lie group <math>G</math> whose Lie algebra is <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and which has trivial [[Center (group theory)|center]].\n* [[List of simple Lie groups|Classification of simple Lie groups]]\nOne can show that the [[fundamental group]] of any Lie group is a discrete [[Abelian group|commutative group]]. Given a (nontrivial) subgroup <math>K\\subset \\pi_1(G)</math> of the fundamental group of some Lie group <math>G</math>, one can use the theory of [[covering space]]s to construct a new group <math>\\tilde{G}^K</math> with <math>K</math> in its center. Now any (real or complex) Lie group can be obtained by applying this construction to centerless Lie groups. Note that real Lie groups obtained this way might not be real forms of any complex group. A very important example of such a real group is the [[metaplectic group]], which appears in infinite-dimensional representation theory and physics. When one takes for <math>K\\subset \\pi_1(G)</math> the full fundamental group, the resulting Lie group <math>\\tilde{G}^{K = \\pi_1(G)}</math> is the universal cover of the centerless Lie group <math>G</math>, and is simply connected. In particular, every (real or complex) Lie algebra also corresponds to a unique connected and [[Simply connected space|simply connected]] Lie group <math>\\tilde{G}</math> with that Lie algebra, called the \"simply connected Lie group\" associated to <math>\\mathfrak{g}.</math>\n\n===Compact Lie groups===\n{{Main|root system}}\nEvery simple Lie algebra has a unique real form whose corresponding centerless Lie group is [[Compact space|compact]]. It turns out that the simply connected Lie group in these cases is also compact. Compact Lie groups have a particularly tractable representation theory because of the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]]. Just like simple complex Lie algebras, centerless compact Lie groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams (first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] and [[Élie Cartan]]).\n\n[[File:Finite_Dynkin_diagrams.svg|Dynkin diagrams|480px]]\n\nFor the infinite (A, B, C, D) series of Dynkin diagrams, the simply connected compact Lie group associated to each Dynkin diagram can be explicitly described as a matrix group, with the corresponding centerless compact Lie group described as the quotient by a subgroup of scalar matrices.\n\n==== A series ====\nA<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ...\n\nA<sub>''r''</sub> has as its associated simply connected compact group the [[special unitary group]], [[Special unitary group|SU(''r'' + 1)]] and as its associated centerless compact group the projective unitary group [[Projective unitary group|PU(''r'' + 1)]].\n\n====B series====\nB<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>, ...\n\nB<sub>''r''</sub> has an associated centerless compact groups the odd [[special orthogonal group]]s, [[Special orthogonal group|SO(2''r'' + 1)]]. This group is not simply connected however: its universal (double) cover is the [[Spin group]].\n\n====C series====\nC<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>, ...\n\nC<sub>''r''</sub> has as its associated simply connected group the group of [[symplectic group|unitary symplectic matrices]], [[Symplectic group|Sp(''r'')]] and as its associated centerless group the Lie group PSp(''r'') = Sp(''r'')/{I, −I} of projective unitary symplectic matrices.\n\n====D series====\nD<sub>4</sub>, D<sub>5</sub>, ...\n\nD<sub>''r''</sub> has an associated compact group the even [[special orthogonal group]]s, [[Special orthogonal group|SO(2''r'')]] and as its associated centerless compact group the projective special orthogonal group PSO(2''r'') = SO(2''r'')/{I, −I}. As with the B series, SO(2''r'') is not simply connected; its universal cover is again the [[spin group]], but the latter again has a center (cf. its article).\n\nThe diagram D<sub>2</sub> is two isolated nodes, the same as A<sub>1</sub> &cup; A<sub>1</sub>, and this coincidence corresponds to the covering map homomorphism from SU(2) &times; SU(2) to SO(4) given by [[quaternion]] multiplication; see [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Pairs of unit quaternions as rotations in 4D space|quaternions and spatial rotation]]. Thus SO(4) is not a simple group.

      "text": "{{lowercase title}}\nIn the theory of [[Lie algebra]]s, an ''' ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple''' is a triple of elements of a Lie algebra that satisfy the commutation relations between the standard generators of the [[special linear group|special linear]] Lie algebra ''sl''<sub>2</sub>. This notion plays an important role in the theory of [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s, especially in regard to their [[nilpotent orbit]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\nElements {''e'',''h'',''f''} of a Lie algebra ''g'' form an ''' ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple''' if\n\n: <math> [h,e] = 2e, \\quad [h,f] = -2f, \\quad [e,f] = h. </math>\n\nThese commutation relations are satisfied by the generators\n\n: <math> h = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0\\\\\n0 & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \ne = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1\\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}, \\quad \nf = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0\\\\\n1 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nof the Lie algebra ''sl''<sub>2</sub> of 2 by 2 matrices with zero [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]]. It follows that ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triples in ''g'' are in a bijective correspondence with the Lie algebra [[homomorphism]]s from ''sl''<sub>2</sub> into ''g''.\n\nThe alternative notation for the elements of an ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple is {''H'', ''X'', ''Y''}, with ''H'' corresponding to ''h'', ''X'' corresponding to ''e'', and ''Y'' corresponding to ''f''.\n\n== Properties ==\n\nAssume that ''g'' is a finite dimensional Lie algebra over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[characteristic zero]].\nFrom the representation theory of the Lie algebra ''sl''<sub>2</sub>, one concludes that the Lie algebra ''g'' decomposes into a direct sum of finite-dimensional subspaces, each of which is isomorphic to ''V''<sub>j</sub>, the (''j'' + 1)-dimensional simple ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-module with [[highest weight]] ''j''. The element ''h'' of the ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple is semisimple, with the simple [[eigenvalue]]s ''j'', ''j'' &minus; 2, &hellip;, &minus;''j'' on a submodule of ''g'' isomorphic to ''V''<sub>j</sub> . The elements ''e'' and ''f'' move between different eigenspaces of ''h'', increasing the eigenvalue by 2 in case of ''e'' and decreasing it by 2 in case of ''f''. In particular, ''e'' and ''f'' are [[nilpotent orbit|nilpotent elements]] of the Lie algebra ''g''.\n\nConversely, the ''Jacobson–Morozov theorem'' states that any nilpotent element ''e'' of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] ''g'' can be included into an ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple {''e'',''h'',''f''}, and all such triples are conjugate under the action of the group ''Z''<sub>''G''</sub>(''e''), the [[centralizer]] of ''e'' in the adjoint Lie group ''G'' corresponding to the Lie algebra ''g''.\n\nThe semisimple element ''h'' of any ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple containing a given nilpotent element ''e'' of ''g'' is called a '''characteristic''' of ''e''.\n\nAn ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple defines a grading on ''g'' according to the eigenvalues of ''h'':\n\n: <math> g = \\bigoplus_{j\\in\\mathbb{Z}} g_j,\\quad [h, a]= ja {\\ \\ }\\textrm{ for } {\\ \\ } a\\in g_j.</math>\n\nThe ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple is called '''even''' if only even ''j'' occur in this decomposition, and '''odd''' otherwise.\n\nIf ''g'' is a semisimple Lie algebra, then ''g''<sub>0</sub> is a [[Semisimple Lie algebra|reductive]] Lie subalgebra of ''g'' (it is not semisimple in general). Moreover, the direct sum of the eigenspaces of ''h'' with non-negative eigenvalues is a [[parabolic subalgebra]] of ''g'' with the Levi component ''g''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nIf the elements of an ''sl''<sub>2</sub>-triple are [[regular element of a Lie algebra|regular]], then their span is called a [[principal subalgebra]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Affine Weyl group]]\n*[[Finite Coxeter group]]\n*[[Hasse diagram]]\n*[[Linear algebraic group]]\n*[[Nilpotent orbit]]\n*[[Root system]]\n*[[Special linear Lie algebra]]\n*[[Weyl group]]\n\n== References ==\n\n* A.

The structure constants <math>f^{abc} = \\epsilon^{abc}</math>, where <math>\\epsilon^{abc}</math> is the [[completely antisymmetric tensor]].]]\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''structure constants''' or '''structure coefficients''' of an [[algebra over a field]] are used to explicitly specify the product of two [[basis vector]]s in the algebra as a [[linear combination]]. Given the structure constants, the resulting product is [[bilinear map|bilinear]] and can be uniquely extended to all vectors in the vector space, thus uniquely determining the product for the algebra.\n\nStructure constants are used whenever an explicit form for the algebra must be given. Thus, they are frequently used when discussing [[Lie algebra]]s in [[physics]], as the basis vectors indicate specific directions in physical space, or correspond to specific [[particle physics|particles]]. Recall that Lie algebras are algebras over a field, with the bilinear product being given by the [[Lie bracket]] or [[commutator]].\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a set of [[basis vector]]s <math>\\{\\mathbf{e}_i\\}</math> for the underlying [[vector space]] of the algebra, the '''structure constants''' or '''structure coefficients''' <math>c_{ij}^{\\;k}</math> express the multiplication <math>\\cdot</math> of pairs of vectors as a [[linear combination]]:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_j = \\sum_{k} c_{ij}^{\\;\\;k} \\mathbf{e}_k</math>.\n\nThe upper and lower indices are frequently not distinguished, unless the algebra is endowed with some other structure that would require this (for example, a [[pseudo-Riemannian metric]], on the algebra of the [[indefinite orthogonal group]] so(''p'',''q'')).  That is, structure constants are often written with all-upper, or all-lower indexes. The distinction between upper and lower is then a convention, reminding the reader that lower indices behave like the components of a [[dual space|dual vector]], i.e. are [[covariant transformation|covariant]] under a [[change of basis]], while upper indices are [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]].\n\n== Example: Lie algebras ==\nFor a Lie algebra, the basis vectors are termed the [[Generator (mathematics)|generators]] of the algebra, and the product is given by the [[Lie bracket]]. That is, the algebra product <math>\\cdot</math> is ''defined'' to be the Lie bracket: for two vectors <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> in the algebra, the product is <math>A\\cdot B\\equiv [A,B].</math> In particular, the algebra product <math>\\cdot</math> ''must not'' be confused with a matrix product, and thus sometimes requires an alternate notation.\n\nThere is no particular need to distinguish the upper and lower indices in this case; they can be written all up or all down. In [[physics]], it is common to use the notation <math>T_i</math> for the generators, and <math>f_{ab}^{\\;\\;c}</math> or <math>f^{abc}</math> (ignoring the upper-lower distinction) for the structure constants. The Lie bracket of pairs of generators is a linear combination of generators from the set, i.e.\n\n:<math>[T_a, T_b] = \\sum_{c} f_{ab}^{\\;\\;c} T_c</math>.\n\nBy linear extension, the structure constants completely determine the Lie brackets of ''all'' elements of the Lie algebra.\n\nAll Lie algebras satisfy the [[Jacobi identity]]. For the basis vectors, it can be written as\n:<math>[T_a, [T_b,T_c]] + [T_b, [T_c, T_a]] + [T_c, [T_a, T_b]] = 0</math>\nand this leads directly to a corresponding identity in terms of the structure constants:\n\n:<math>f_{ad}^{\\;\\;e}f_{bc}^{\\;\\;d} + f_{bd}^{\\;\\;e}f_{ca}^{\\;\\;d} + f_{cd}^{\\;\\;e}f_{ab}^{\\;\\;d} = 0.</math>\n\nThe above, and the remainder of this article, make use of the [[Einstein summation convention]] for repeated indexes.\n\nThe structure constants play a role in  [[Lie algebra representation]]s, and in fact, give exactly the matrix elements of the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]].  The [[Killing form]] and the [[Casimir invariant]] also have a particularly simple form, when written in terms of the structure constants.\n\nThe structure constants often make an appearance in the approximation to the [[Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula]] for the product of two elements of a [[Lie group]]. For small elements <math>X, Y</math> of the Lie algebra, the structure of the Lie group near the identity element is given by <math>\\exp(X)\\exp(Y) \\approx \\exp(X + Y + \\tfrac{1}{2}[X,Y])</math>.  Note the factor of 1/2.\n\n== Lie algebra examples ==\n\n=== su(2) and so(3)===\n\nThe algebra su(2) of the [[special unitary group]] [[SU(2)]] is three-dimensional, with generators given by the [[Pauli matrices]] <math>\\sigma_i</math>. The generators of the group SU(2) satisfy the commutation relations (where <math>\\epsilon^{abc}</math> is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]):\n\n:<math>[\\sigma_a, \\sigma_b] = 2 i \\epsilon^{abc} \\sigma_c</math>\n\nwhere\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|<math>\\sigma_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|<math>\\sigma_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\\\ i & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|<math>\\sigma_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|}\n\nIn this case, the structure constants are <math>f^{abc} = 2 i \\epsilon^{abc}</math>.  Note that the constant ''2i'' can be absorbed into the definition of the basis vectors; thus, defining <math>t_a = -i\\sigma_a/2</math>, one can equally well write\n\n:<math>[t_a, t_b] = \\epsilon^{abc} t_c</math>\n\nDoing so emphasizes that the Lie algebra su(2) of the Lie group SU(2) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra so(3) of [[SO(3)]]. This brings the structure constants into line with those of the [[rotation group SO(3)]].  That is, the commutator for the [[angular momentum operator]]s are then commonly written as\n\n:<math>[L_i, L_j] = \\epsilon^{ijk} L_k</math>\n\nwhere\n:{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|<math>L_x = L_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|<math>L_y = L_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|<math>L_z = L_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n|}\nare written so as to obey the [[right hand rule]] for rotations in 3-dimensional space.\n\nThe difference of the factor of ''2i'' between these two sets of structure constants can be infuriating, as it involves some subtlety. Thus, for example, the two-dimensional complex vector space can be given a [[real structure]].

They are both Lie superalgebras whose even part is the Virasoro algebra: this Lie algebra has a basis consisting of a [[Center (algebra)|central element]] ''C'' and [[Lie algebra#Generators and dimension|generators]] ''L''<sub>''m''</sub> (for integer ''m'') satisfying\n\n<math>[ L_m , L_n ] = ( m - n ) L_{m+n} + \\frac{c}{12} m ( m^2 - 1 ) \\delta_{m+n,0} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta_{i,j}</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nThe odd part of the algebra has basis <math>G_r</math>, where <math>r</math> is either an integer (the Ramond case), or half an odd integer (the Neveu–Schwarz case). In both cases, <math>c</math> is central in the superalgebra, and the additional graded brackets are given by\n\n<math>[ L_m , G_r ] = \\left( \\frac{m}{2} - r \\right) G_{m+r} </math>\n\n<math>\\{ G_r , G_s \\} = 2 L_{r+s} + \\frac{c}{3} \\left( r^2 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) \\delta_{r+s,0} </math>\n\nNote that this last bracket is an [[anticommutator]], not a commutator, because both generators are odd.\n\nThe unitary [[highest weight representation]]s of these algebras have a classification analogous to that for the Virasoro algebra, with a continuum of representations together with an infinite discrete series.   The existence of these discrete series was conjectured by [[Daniel Friedan]], Zongan Qiu, and [[Stephen Shenker]] (1984).  It was proven by [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], Adrian Kent and [[David Olive]] (1986), using a supersymmetric generalisation of the [[coset construction]] or GKO construction.\n\n==Application to superstring theory<!--[[Ramond boundary condition]], [[Ramond boundary conditions]], [[Neveu–Schwarz boundary condition]], [[Neveu–Schwarz boundary conditions]], [[Neveu-Schwarz boundary condition]], and [[Neveu-Schwarz boundary conditions]] redirect here-->==\n\nIn superstring theory, the [[fermionic field]]s on the [[closed string]] may be either periodic or anti-periodic on the circle around the string. States in the \"Ramond sector\" admit one option (periodic conditions are referred to as '''Ramond [[Boundary value problem#Boundary value conditions|boundary conditions]]'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->), described by the Ramond algebra, while those in the \"Neveu–Schwarz sector\" admit the other (anti-periodic conditions are referred to as '''Neveu–Schwarz boundary conditions'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->), described by the Neveu–Schwarz algebra.\n\nFor a [[fermionic field]], the periodicity depends on the choice of coordinates on the [[worldsheet]]. In the ''w-frame'', in which the worldsheet of a single string state is described as a long cylinder, states in the Neveu–Schwarz sector are anti-periodic and states in the Ramond sector are periodic. In the ''z-frame'', in which the worldsheet of a single string state is described as an infinite punctured plane, the opposite is true.\n\nThe Neveu–Schwarz sector and Ramond sector are also defined in the open string and depend on the boundary conditions of the [[fermionic field]] at the edges of the open string.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[N = 2 superconformal algebra|''N'' = 2 superconformal algebra]]\n* [[NS–NS sector]]\n* [[Ramond–Ramond sector]]\n* [[Superconformal algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first=K.|last= Becker|first2= M.|last2= Becker |first3=J.H.|last3= Schwarz|year=2007|title=String theory and M-theory: A modern introduction| publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-86069-5}}\n*{{citation|first=P.|last=Goddard|authorlink=Peter Goddard (physicist)|first2=A.|last2=Kent|first3=D.|last3=Olive|authorlink3=David Olive|url=http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.cmp/1104114626|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121209124641/http://projecteuclid.org/Dienst/UI/1.0/Summarize/euclid.cmp/1104114626|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-12-09|title=Unitary representations of the Virasoro and super-Virasoro algebras|journal=Comm.

      "title": "Super-Poincaré algebra",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Poincar%C3%A9_algebra",
      "text": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\nIn [[theoretical physics]], a '''super-Poincaré algebra''' is an extension of the [[Poincaré algebra]] to incorporate [[supersymmetry]], a relation between [[boson]]s and [[fermion]]s. They are examples of [[supersymmetry algebra]]s (without [[central charge]]s or internal symmetries), and are [[Lie superalgebra]]s. Thus a super-Poincaré algebra is a [[graded algebra|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded]] vector space with a graded Lie bracket such that the even part is a [[Lie algebra]] containing the Poincaré algebra, and the odd part is built from [[spinor]]s on which there is an [[anticommutator|anticommutation relation]] with values in the even part.\n\n==Informal sketch==\nThe Poincaré algebra describes the isometries of [[Minkowski spacetime]]. From the [[representation theory of the Lorentz group]], it is known that the Lorentz group admits two inequivalent complex spinor representations, dubbed <math>2</math> and <math>\\overline{2}</math>.<ref group=nb>The barred representations are conjugate linear while the unbarred ones are complex linear. The numeral refers to the dimension of the [[representation space]]. Another more common notation is to write {{math|({{frac|1|2}}, 0)}} and {{math|(0, {{frac|1|2}})}} respectively for these representations. The general irreducible representation is then {{math|(''m'', ''n'')}}, where {{math|''m, n''}} are half-integral and correspond physically to the spin content of the representation, which ranges from {{math|{{!}}''m'' + ''n''{{!}} to {{!}}''m'' − ''n''{{!}}}} in integer steps, each spin occurring exactly once.</ref> Taking their [[tensor product]], one obtains <math>2\\otimes \\overline{2}=3\\oplus 1</math>; such decompositions of tensor products of representations into [[direct sum]]s is given by the [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]].\n\nNormally, one treats such a decomposition as relating to specific particles: so, for example, the [[pion]], which is a [[Chirality (physics)|chiral]] [[vector particle]], is composed of a [[quark]]-anti-quark pair. However, one could also identify <math>3\\oplus 1</math> with Minkowski spacetime itself. This leads to a natural question: if Minkowski space-time belongs to the [[adjoint representation]], then can Poincaré symmetry be extended to the [[fundamental representation]]? Well, it can: this is exactly the super-Poincaré algebra. There is a corresponding experimental question: if we live in the adjoint representation, then where is the fundamental representation hiding? This is the program of [[supersymmetry]], which has not been found experimentally.\n\n==History==\nThe super-Poincaré algebra was first proposed in the context of the [[Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem]], as a means of avoiding the conclusions of the [[Coleman–Mandula theorem]]. That is, the Coleman–Mandula theorem is a no-go theorem that states that the Poincaré algebra cannot be extended with additional symmetries that might describe the [[internal symmetry|internal symmetries]] of the observed physical particle spectrum. However, the Coleman–Mandula theorem  assumed that the algebra extension would be by means of a commutator; this assumption, and thus the theorem, can be avoided by considering the anti-commutator, that is, by employing anti-commuting [[Grassmann number]]s. The proposal was to consider a [[supersymmetry algebra]], defined as the [[semidirect product]] of a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of the super-Poincaré algebra by a compact [[Lie algebra]] of internal symmetries.\n\n==Definition==\nThe simplest supersymmetric extension of the Poincaré algebra contains two [[Weyl spinor]]s with the following anti-commutation relation:\n:<math>\\{Q_{\\alpha}, \\bar Q_{\\dot{\\beta}}\\} = 2{\\sigma^\\mu}_{\\alpha\\dot{\\beta}}P_\\mu </math>\nand all other anti-commutation relations between the ''Q''s and ''P''s vanish.<ref>{{harvnb|Aitchison|2005}}</ref>  In the above expression <math>P_\\mu</math> are the generators of translation and <math>\\sigma^\\mu</math> are the [[Pauli matrices]]. The index <math>\\alpha</math> runs over the values <math>\\alpha=1,2.</math> A dot is used over the index <math>\\dot{\\beta}</math> to remind that this index transforms according to the inequivalent conjugate spinor representation; one must never accidentally contract these two types of indexes. The Pauli matrices can be considered to be a direct manifestation of the [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] mentioned before: they indicate how the tensor product <math>2\\otimes\\overline{2}</math> of the two spinors can be re-expressed as a vector. The index <math>\\mu</math> of course ranges over the space-time dimensions <math>\\mu=0,1,2,3.</math>\n\nIt is convenient to work with [[Dirac spinor]]s instead of Weyl spinors; a Dirac spinor can be thought of as an element of <math>2\\oplus\\overline{2}</math>; it has four components. The [[Dirac matrix|Dirac matrices]] are thus also four-dimensional, and can be expressed as direct sums of the Pauli matrices. The tensor product then gives an algebraic relation to the [[Minkowski metric]] <math> g^{\\mu \\nu} </math> which is expressed as:\n\n:<math> \\{ \\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\} = 2g^{\\mu \\nu} </math>\nand\n:<math>  \\sigma^{\\mu \\nu}=\\frac{i}{2}\\left[ \\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu \\right] </math>\n\nThis then gives the full algebra<ref>{{harvnb|van Nieuwenhuizen|1981|page=274}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n \\left[ M^{\\mu \\nu} , Q_\\alpha \\right] &= \\frac{1}{2} ( \\sigma^{\\mu \\nu})_\\alpha^{\\;\\;\\beta} Q_\\beta \\\\\n\n \\left[ Q_\\alpha , P^\\mu \\right] &= 0 \\\\\n\n \\{ Q_\\alpha , \\bar{Q}_{\\dot{\\beta}} \\} &= 2 ( \\sigma^\\mu )_{\\alpha \\dot{\\beta}} P_\\mu \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich are to be combined with the normal [[Poincaré algebra]]. It is a closed algebra, since all [[Jacobi identity|Jacobi identities]] are satisfied and can have since explicit matrix representations. Following this line of reasoning will lead to [[supergravity]].\n\n==SUSY in 3 + 1 Minkowski spacetime==\nIn {{math|(3 + 1)}} Minkowski spacetime, the [[Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem]] states that the SUSY algebra with N spinor generators is as follows.\n\nThe even part of the [[star Lie superalgebra]] is the direct sum of the [[Poincaré algebra]] and a [[reductive Lie algebra]] ''B'' (such that its self-adjoint part is the tangent space of a real compact Lie group). The odd part of the algebra would be\n:<math>\\left(\\frac{1}{2},0\\right)\\otimes V\\oplus\\left(0,\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\otimes V^*</math>\nwhere <math>(1/2,0)</math> and <math>(0,1/2)</math> are specific representations of the Poincaré algebra. (Compared to the notation used earlier in the article, these correspond <math>\\overline{2}\\oplus 1</math> and <math>1\\oplus 2</math>, respectively, also see the footnote where the previous notation was introduced). Both components are conjugate to each other under the * conjugation. ''V'' is an ''N''-dimensional complex representation of ''B'' and ''V''<sup>*</sup> is its [[dual representation]]. The Lie bracket for the odd part is given by a symmetric [[equivariant]] pairing {.,.} on the odd part with values in the even part. In particular, its reduced intertwiner from <math>[(\\frac{1}{2},0)\\otimes V]\\otimes[(0,\\frac{1}{2})\\otimes V^*]</math> to the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] of the Poincaré algebra generated by translations is given as the product of a nonzero intertwiner from <math>(\\frac{1}{2},0)\\otimes(0,\\frac{1}{2})</math>  to (1/2,1/2) by the \"contraction intertwiner\" from <math>V\\otimes V^*</math> to the [[trivial representation]].  On the other hand, its reduced intertwiner from <math>[(\\frac{1}{2},0)\\otimes V]\\otimes [(\\frac{1}{2},0)\\otimes V]</math> is the product of a (antisymmetric) intertwiner from <math>(\\frac{1}{2},0)\\otimes(\\frac{1}{2},0)</math> to (0,0) and an antisymmetric intertwiner ''A'' from <math>N^2</math> to ''B''.  Conjugate it to get the corresponding case for the other half.\n\n===''N'' = 1===\n\n''B'' is now <math>u(1)</math> (called R-symmetry) and ''V'' is the 1D representation of <math>u(1)</math> with [[charge (physics)|charge]] 1. ''A'' (the intertwiner defined above) would have to be zero since it is antisymmetric.\n\nActually, there are two versions of ''N=1'' SUSY, one without the <math>u(1)</math> (i.e. ''B'' is zero-dimensional) and the other with <math>u(1)</math>.\n\n===''N'' = 2===\n\n''B'' is now <math>su(2)\\oplus u(1)</math> and ''V'' is the 2D doublet representation of <math>su(2)</math> with a zero <math>u(1)</math> [[charge (physics)|charge]]. Now, ''A'' is a nonzero intertwiner to the <math>u(1)</math> part of ''B''.\n\nAlternatively, ''V'' could be a 2D doublet with a nonzero <math>u(1)</math> charge.  In this case, ''A'' would have to be zero.\n\nYet another possibility would be to let ''B'' be <math>u(1)_A\\oplus u(1)_B \\oplus u(1)_C</math>. ''V'' is invariant under <math>u(1)_B</math> and <math>u(1)_C</math> and decomposes into a 1D rep with <math>u(1)_A</math> charge 1 and another 1D rep with charge -1. The intertwiner ''A'' would be complex with the real part mapping to <math>u(1)_B</math> and the imaginary part mapping to <math>u(1)_C</math>.\n\nOr we could have ''B'' being <math>su(2)\\oplus u(1)_A\\oplus u(1)_B</math> with ''V'' being the doublet rep of <math>su(2)</math> with zero <math>u(1)</math> charges and ''A'' being a complex intertwiner with the real part mapping to <math>u(1)_A</math> and the imaginary part to <math>u(1)_B</math>.\n\nThis doesn't even exhaust all the possibilities. We see that there is more than one ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 supersymmetry; likewise, the SUSYs for ''N''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2 are also not unique (in fact, it only gets worse).\n\n===''N'' = 3===\n\nIt is theoretically allowed, but the multiplet structure becomes automatically the same with\nthat of an ''N''=4 supersymmetric theory. So it is less often discussed compared to ''N''=1,2,4 versions.\n\n===''N'' = 4===\n\nThis is the maximal number of [[supercharge]]s in a theory without gravity.\n\n==SUSY in various dimensions==\nIn 0&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 4&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 6&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 7&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 8&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 10&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions, etc., a SUSY algebra is classified by a positive integer&nbsp;''N''.\n\nIn 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 5&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, 9&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions, etc., a SUSY algebra is classified by two nonnegative integers (''M'',&nbsp;''N''), at least one of which is nonzero. ''M'' represents the number of left-handed SUSYs and ''N'' represents the number of right-handed SUSYs.\n\nThe reason of this has to do with the reality conditions of the [[spinor]]s.\n\nHereafter ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;9 means ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;8&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 in Minkowski signature, etc.  The structure of supersymmetry algebra is mainly determined by the number of the fermionic generators, that is the number ''N'' times the real dimension of the spinor in ''d'' dimensions.  It is because one can obtain a supersymmetry algebra of lower dimension easily from that of higher dimensionality by the use of dimensional reduction.\n\n===''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;11===\nThe only example is the ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 supersymmetry with 32 supercharges.\n\n===''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10===\nFrom ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;11, ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 SUSY, one obtains ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;1) nonchiral SUSY algebra, which is also called the type IIA supersymmetry. There is also ''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(2,&nbsp;0) SUSY algebra, which is called the type IIB supersymmetry.  Both of them have 32 supercharges.\n\n''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;0) SUSY algebra with 16 supercharges is the minimal susy algebra in 10 dimensions. It is also called the type I supersymmetry. Type IIA / IIB / I [[superstring theory]] has the SUSY algebra of the corresponding name. The supersymmetry algebra for the heterotic superstrings is that of type I.\n\n== Remarks ==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite arXiv|ref=harv|last=Aitchison|first=Ian J R|title=Supersymmetry and the MSSM: An Elementary Introduction|eprint=hep-ph/0505105|year=2005}}\n*{{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Gol'fand|first1=Y.

      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]], a '''supersymmetry algebra''' (or '''SUSY algebra''') is a mathematical formalism for describing the relation between [[boson]]s and [[fermion]]s. The supersymmetry algebra contains not only the [[Poincaré algebra]] and a compact subalgebra of internal symmetries, but also contains some fermionic supercharges, transforming as a sum of ''N'' real [[spinor representation]]s of the [[Poincaré group]]. Such symmetries are allowed by the [[Haag–Łopuszański–Sohnius theorem]].  When ''N''>1 the algebra is said to have [[extended supersymmetry]]. The supersymmetry algebra is a [[Lie algebra extension#By semidirect sum|semidirect sum]] of a [[Lie algebra extension#Central|central extension]] of the [[super-Poincaré algebra]] by a compact [[Lie algebra]] ''B'' of internal symmetries.\n\n[[Bosonic field]]s [[Commutative operation|commute]] while [[fermionic field]]s anticommute. In order to have a transformation that relates the two kinds of fields, the introduction of a [[graded algebra|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading]] under which the even elements are bosonic and the odd elements are fermionic is required. Such an algebra is called a [[Lie superalgebra]].\n\nJust as one can have representations of a [[Lie algebra]], one can also have [[representation of a Lie superalgebra|representations of a Lie superalgebra]], called [[supermultiplet]]s.  For each Lie algebra, there exists an associated Lie group which is [[connected space|connected]] and [[simply connected]], unique up to [[isomorphism]], and the representations of the algebra can be extended to create [[group representation]]s.  In the same way, representations of a Lie superalgebra can sometimes be extended into representations of a [[Lie supergroup]].\n\n==Structure of a supersymmetry algebra==\n\nThe general supersymmetry algebra for spacetime dimension ''d'', and with the fermionic piece consisting of a sum of ''N'' irreducible real spinor representations, has a structure of the form\n:(''P''×''Z'').''Q''.(''L''×''B'')\nwhere\n*''P'' is a bosonic abelian vector normal subalgebra of dimension ''d'', normally identified with translations of spacetime. It is a vector representation of ''L''.\n*''Z'' is a scalar bosonic algebra in the center whose elements are called central charges.\n*''Q'' is an abelian fermionic spinor subquotient algebra, and is a sum of ''N'' real spinor representations of ''L''. (When the signature of spacetime is divisible by 4 there are two different spinor representations of ''L'', so there is some ambiguity about the structure of ''Q'' as a representation of ''L''.) The elements of ''Q'', or rather their inverse images in the supersymmetry algebra, are called supercharges. The subalgebra (''P''×''Z'').''Q'' is sometimes also called the supersymmetry algebra and is nilpotent of length at most 2, with the Lie bracket of two supercharges lying in ''P''×''Z''.\n*''L'' is a bosonic subalgebra, isomorphic to the Lorentz algebra in ''d'' dimensions, of dimension ''d''(''d''–1)/2\n*''B'' is a scalar bosonic subalgebra, given by the Lie algebra of some compact group, called the group of internal symmetries. It commutes with ''P'',''Z'', and ''L'', but may act non-trivially on the supercharges ''Q''.\n\nThe terms \"bosonic\" and \"fermionic\" refer to even and odd subspaces of the superalgebra.\n\nThe terms \"scalar\", \"spinor\", \"vector\", refer to the behavior of subalgebras under the action of the Lorentz algebra ''L''.\n\nThe number ''N'' is the number of irreducible real spin representations. When the signature of spacetime is divisible by 4 this is ambiguous as in this case there are two different irreducible real spinor representations, and the number ''N'' is sometimes replaced by a pair of integers (''N''<sub>1</sub>, ''N''<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThe supersymmetry algebra is sometimes regarded as a real super algebra, and sometimes as a complex algebra with a hermitian conjugation. These two views are essentially equivalent, as the real algebra can be constructed from the complex algebra by taking the skew-Hermitian elements, and the complex algebra can be constructed from the real one by taking tensor product with the complex numbers.\n\nThe bosonic part of the superalgebra is isomorphic to the product of the Poincaré algebra ''P''.''L'' with the algebra ''Z''×''B'' of internal symmetries.\n\nWhen ''N''>1 the algebra is said to have '''extended supersymmetry'''.\n\nWhen ''Z'' is trivial, the  subalgebra ''P''.''Q''.''L'' is the [[super-Poincaré algebra]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Adinkra symbols (physics)|adinkra symbols]]\n* [[Super-Poincaré algebra]]\n* [[Superconformal algebra]]\n* [[Supersymmetry algebras in 1 + 1 dimensions]]\n* [[N = 2 superconformal algebra|''N'' = 2 superconformal algebra]]\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Bagger | first1=Jonathan | last2=Wess | first2=Julius | title=Supersymmetry and supergravity | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4QrQZ_Rjq4UC | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | edition=2nd | series=Princeton Series in Physics | isbn=0-691-02530-4 | mr=1152804  | year=1992}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Haag | first1=Rudolf | author1-link=Rudolf Haag | last2=Sohnius | first2=Martin | last3=Łopuszański | first3=Jan T. | title=All possible generators of supersymmetries of the S-matrix | doi=10.1016/0550-3213(75)90279-5 | mr=0411396  | year=1975 | journal=Nuclear Physics B | volume=88 | pages=257–274|bibcode = 1975NuPhB..88..257H }}\n\n[[Category:Supersymmetry]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "text": "In mathematics, a '''Tate vector space''' is a [[vector space]] obtained from finite-dimensional vector spaces in a way that makes it possible to extend concepts such as [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] and [[determinant]] to an infinite-dimensional situation. Tate spaces were introduced by {{harvs|txt | last1=Beilinson | first1=Alexander | author1-link=Alexander Beilinson | last2=Feigin | first2=Boris | author2-link=Boris Feigin | last3=Mazur | first3=Barry | author3-link=Barry Mazur | year=1991}}, who named them after [[John Tate]].\n\n==Introduction==\nA typical example of a Tate vector space over a field ''k'' are the [[Laurent series|Laurent power series]]\n\n:<math>V = k((t)). \\, </math>\n\nIt has two characteristic features:\n* as ''n'' grows, ''V'' is the union of its submodules <math>t^{-n} k[[t]]</math>, where <math>k[[t]]</math> denotes the [[power series ring]]. These submodules are referred to as lattices.\n* Even though each lattice is an infinite-dimensional vector space, the quotients of any individual lattices,\n:: <math>t^{-n} k[[t]] / t^{-m} k[[t]], \\ n \\ge m </math>\n:are ''finite''-dimensional ''k''-vector spaces.\n\n===Tate modules===\nTate modules were introduced by {{harvtxt|Drinfeld|2006}} to serve as a notion of infinite-dimensional vector bundles. For any ring ''R'', Drinfeld defined elementary Tate modules to be topological ''R''-modules of the form\n\n:<math>P \\oplus Q^*</math>\n\nwhere ''P'' and ''Q'' are projective ''R''-modules (of possibly infinite rank) and * denotes the dual.\n\nFor a field, Tate vector spaces in this sense are equivalent to locally linearly compact vector spaces, a concept going back to Lefschetz. These are characterized by the property that they have a base of the topology consisting of [[Commensurability (group theory)|commensurable]] sub-vector spaces.\n\n==Tate objects==\nTate objects can be defined in the context of any [[exact category]] ''C''.<ref>{{harvtxt|Braunling|Groechenig|Wolfson|2016}}, {{harvtxt|Previdi|2011}}</ref> Briefly, an exact category is way to axiomatize certain features of [[short exact sequence]]s. For example, the category of finite-dimensional ''k''-vector spaces, or the category of finitely generated projective ''R''-modules, for some [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', is an exact category, with its usual notion of short exact sequences.\n\nThe extension of the above example <math>k((t))</math> to a more general situation is based on the following observation: there is an exact sequence\n:<math>0 \\to k[[t]] \\to k((t)) \\to t^{-1} k[t^{-1}] \\to 0</math>\nwhose outer terms are an [[inverse limit]] and a [[direct limit]], respectively, of finite-dimensional ''k''-vector spaces\n\n:<math>k[[t]] = \\lim_n k[t]/t^n</math>\n:<math>t^{-1} k[t^{-1}] = \\operatorname*{colim}_m \\bigoplus_{i=-1}^{-m} t^i \\cdot k.</math>\n\nIn general, for an exact category ''C'', there is the category Pro(''C'') of pro-objects and the category Ind(''C'') of [[ind-object]]s. This construction can be iterated and yields an exact category Ind(Pro(''C'')). The category of ''elementary Tate objects''\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{Tate}^\\text{el}(C)</math>\n\nis defined to be the smallest subcategory of those Ind-Pro objects ''V'' such that there is a short exact sequence\n\n:<math>0 \\to L \\to V \\to L' \\to 0</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is a pro-object and ''L' ''is an ind-object.\nIt can be shown that this condition on ''V'' is equivalent to that requiring for an ind-presentation\n\n:<math>V: I \\to \\operatorname{Pro}(C)</math>\n\nthe quotients <math>V_j / V_i</math> are in ''C'' (as opposed to Pro(''C'')).\n\nThe category Tate(''C'') of ''Tate objects'' is defined to be the closure under retracts (idempotent completion) of elementary Tate objects.\n\n{{harvtxt|Braunling|Groechenig|Wolfson|2016}} showed that Tate objects (for ''C'' the category of finitely generated projective ''R''-modules, and subject to the condition that the indexing families of the Ind-Pro objects are countable) are equivalent to countably generated Tate ''R''-modules in the sense of Drinfeld mentioned above.\n\n==Related notions and applications==\nA ''Tate Lie algebra'' is a Tate vector space with an additional Lie algebra structure. An example of a Tate Lie algebra is the Lie algebra of [[formal power series]] over a finite-dimensional Lie algebra.\n\nThe category of Tate objects is an exact category, as well, as can be shown. The construction can therefore be iterated, which is relevant to applications in higher-dimensional class field theory,<ref>{{harvtxt|Arkhipov|Kremnizer|2010}}</ref> which studies higher local fields such as\n\n: <math>\\mathbf F_p((t_1))\\cdots((t_n)).</math>\n\n{{harvtxt|Kapranov|2001}} has introduced the so-called [[determinant torsor]] for Tate vector spaces, which extends the usual linear algebra notions of determinants and traces etc. to automorphisms ''f'' of Tate vector spaces ''V''. The essential idea is that, even though a lattice ''L'' in ''V'' is infinite-dimensional, the lattices ''L'' and ''f''(''L'') are commensurable, so that the in the finite-dimensional sense can be uniquely extended to all lattices, provided that the determinant of one lattice is fixed.\n{{harvtxt|Clausen|2009}} has applied this torsor to simultaneously prove the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], [[Weil reciprocity]] and the sum of residues formula.\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Arkhipov | first1=Sergey | title=Semiinfinite cohomology of Tate Lie algebras |mr=1900583 | year=2002 | journal=Moscow Mathematical Journal | issn=1609-3321 | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=35–40| arxiv=math/0003015 | bibcode=2000math......3015A }}\n*{{Citation|author1=Arkhipov|first1=Sergey|author2=Kremnizer|first2=Kobi|chapter=2-gerbes and 2-Tate spaces|title=Arithmetic and geometry around quantization|\nvolume=279|pages=23–35|year=2010|publisher=Birkhäuser|mr=2656941|doi=10.1007/978-0-8176-4831-2_2|arxiv=0708.4401}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Beilinson | first1=Alexander | last2=Feigin | first2=B. | last3=Mazur | first3=Barry | author3-link=Barry Mazur | title=Notes on Conformal Field Theory | url=http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~kirillov/manuscripts.html | series=Unpublished manuscript | year=1991}}\n*{{citation|author1=Braunling|first1=Oliver |author2=Groechenig|first2=Michael|author3=Wolfson|first3=Jesse|title=Tate objects in exact categories|journal=Mosc.

      "text": "In [[representation theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''theorem of the highest weight''' classifies the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|irreducible representations]] of a complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak g</math> <ref>{{harvnb|Dixmier|loc=Theorem 7.2.6.}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorems 9.4 and 9.5</ref>. There is a closely related theorem classifying the [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|irreducible representations]] of a connected compact Lie group <math>K</math> <ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 12.6</ref>. The theorem states that there is a bijection\n:<math>\\lambda \\mapsto [V^\\lambda]</math>\nfrom the set of \"dominant integral elements\" to the set of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> or <math>K</math>. The difference between the two results is in the precise notion of \"integral\" in the definition of a dominant integral element. If <math>K</math> is simply connected, this distinction disappears.\n\n== Statement ==\n=== Lie algebra case ===\n{{see also|Weight (representation theory)#Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras}}\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a finite-dimensional semisimple complex Lie algebra with [[Cartan subalgebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>. Let <math>R</math> be the associated [[root system]]. We then say that an element <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h</math> is '''integral'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 8.7</ref> if \n:<math>2\\frac{\\langle\\lambda,\\alpha\\rangle}{\\langle\\alpha,\\alpha\\rangle}</math>\nis an integer for each root <math>\\alpha</math>.

An element <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h</math> '''dominant integral''' if it is both dominant and integral. Finally, if <math>\\lambda</math> and <math>\\mu</math> are in <math>\\mathfrak h</math>, we say that <math>\\lambda</math> is '''higher'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 8.8</ref> than <math>\\mu</math> if <math>\\lambda-\\mu</math> is expressible as a linear combination of positive roots with non-negative real coefficients. \n\nA [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|weight]] <math>\\lambda</math> of a representation <math>V</math> of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is then called a '''highest weight''' if <math>\\lambda</math> is higher than every other weight <math>\\mu</math> of <math>V</math>.\n\nThe theorem of the highest weight then states<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorems 9.4 and 9.5</ref>:\n*If <math>V</math> is a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, then <math>V</math> has a unique highest weight, and this highest weight is dominant integral.\n*If two finite-dimensional irreducible representations have the same highest weight, they are isomorphic.\n*For each dominant integral element <math>\\lambda</math>, there exists a finite-dimensional irreducible representation with highest weight <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\nThe most difficult part is the last one; the construction of a finite-dimensional irreducible representation.\n\n=== The compact group case ===\n{{see also|Compact group#Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group}}\nLet <math>K</math> be a connected [[compact group|compact Lie group]] with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak k</math> and let <math>\\mathfrak g:=\\mathfrak k+i\\mathfrak k</math> be the complexification of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>.

Then <math>\\mathfrak h:=\\mathfrak t+i\\mathfrak t</math> is a Cartan subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, and we may form the associated root system <math>R</math>. The theory then proceeds in much the same way as in the Lie algebra case, with one crucial difference: the notion of integrality is different. Specifically, we say that an element <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h</math> is ''' analytically integral'''<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Definition 12.4</ref> if \n:<math>\\langle\\lambda,H\\rangle</math>\nis an integer whenever\n:<math>e^{2\\pi H}=I</math>\nwhere <math>I</math> is the identity element of <math>K</math>. Every analytically integral element is integral in the Lie algebra sense<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 12.7</ref>, but there may be integral elements in the Lie algebra sense that are not analytically integral. This distinction reflects the fact that if <math>K</math> is not simply connected, there may be representations of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> that do not come from representations of <math>K</math>. On the other hand, if <math>K</math> is simply connected, the notions of \"integral\" and \"analytically integral\" coincide.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 12.6</ref>\n\nThe theorem of the highest weight for representations of <math>K</math><ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 13.20</ref> is then the same as in the Lie algebra case, except that \"integral\" is replaced by \"analytically integral.\"\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere are at least four proofs:\n*Hermann Weyl's original proof from the compact group point of view<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 12</ref>, based on the [[Weyl character formula]] and the [[Peter–Weyl theorem]]. \n*The theory of [[Verma module]]s contains the highest weight theorem. This is the approach taken in many standard textbooks (e.g., Humphreys and Part II of Hall).\n*The [[Borel–Weil–Bott theorem]] constructs an irreducible representation as the space of global sections of an ample line bundle; the highest weight theorem results as a consequence. (The approach uses a fair bit of algebraic geometry but yields a very quick proof.)\n*The [[invariant theory|invariant theoretic]] approach: one constructs irreducible representations as subrepresentations of a tensor power of the standard representions. This approach is essentially due to H. Weyl and works quite well for classical groups.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras]]\n* [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group]]\n* [[Weight_(representation_theory)#Weights_in_the_representation_theory_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Dixmier | first1=Jacques | title=Enveloping algebras | origyear=1974 | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0821805606 | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-8218-0560-2 |mr=0498740 | year=1996 | volume=11}}\n* {{Fulton-Harris}}\n* {{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie groups, Lie algebras, and representations: An elementary introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n* {{citation | title =Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory|first=James E.|last=Humphreys|publisher=Birkhäuser|year= 1972a|isbn=978-0-387-90053-7}}.\n\n\n\n[[Category:Representation theory]]\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]"

      "title": "Vertex operator algebra",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex_operator_algebra",
      "text": "{{String theory}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''vertex operator algebra''' ('''VOA''') is an algebraic structure that plays an important role in [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] and [[string theory]].  In addition to physical applications, vertex operator algebras have proven useful in purely mathematical contexts such as [[monstrous moonshine]] and the [[geometric Langlands correspondence]].\n\nThe related notion of '''vertex algebra''' was introduced by [[Richard Borcherds]] in 1986, motivated by a construction of an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra due to [[Igor Frenkel]].  In the course of this construction, one employs a [[Fock space]] that admits an action of vertex operators attached to lattice vectors.  Borcherds formulated the notion of vertex algebra by axiomatizing the relations between the lattice vertex operators, producing an algebraic structure that allows one to construct new Lie algebras by following Frenkel's method.\n\nThe notion of vertex operator algebra was introduced as a modification of the notion of vertex algebra, by Frenkel, [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]] in 1988, as part of their project to construct the [[moonshine module]].  They observed that many vertex algebras that appear in nature have a useful additional structure (an action of the Virasoro algebra), and satisfy a bounded-below property with respect to an energy operator.  Motivated by this observation, they added the Virasoro action and bounded-below property as axioms.\n\nWe now have post-hoc motivation for these notions from physics, together with several interpretations of the axioms that were not initially known.  Physically, the vertex operators arising from holomorphic field insertions at points (i.e., vertices) in two dimensional conformal field theory admit [[operator product expansion]]s when insertions collide, and these satisfy precisely the relations specified in the definition of vertex operator algebra.  Indeed, the axioms of a vertex operator algebra are a formal algebraic interpretation of what physicists call [[chiral algebra]]s, or \"algebras of chiral symmetries\", where these symmetries describe the Ward identities satisfied by a given conformal field theory, including conformal invariance.  Other formulations of the vertex algebra axioms include Borcherds's later work on singular commutative rings, algebras over certain operads on curves introduced by Huang, Kriz, and others, and [[D-module]]-theoretic objects called chiral algebras introduced by [[Alexander Beilinson]] and [[Vladimir Drinfeld]].  While related, these chiral algebras are not precisely the same as the objects with the same name that physicists use.\n\nImportant basic examples of vertex operator algebras include lattice VOAs (modeling lattice conformal field theories), VOAs given by representations of affine [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s (from the [[Wess-Zumino-Witten model|WZW model]]), the Virasoro VOAs (i.e., VOAs corresponding to representations of the [[Virasoro algebra]]) and the [[moonshine module]] ''V''<sup>♮</sup>, which is distinguished by its monster symmetry.  More sophisticated examples such as [[affine W-algebras]] and the [[chiral de Rham complex]] on a complex manifold arise in geometric representation theory and [[mathematical physics]].\n\n== Formal definition ==\n\n===Vertex algebra===\nA '''vertex algebra''' is a collection of data that satisfy certain axioms.\n\n==== Data ====\n* a [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}}, called the space of states.  The underlying field is typically taken to be the complex numbers, although Borcherds's original formulation allowed for an arbitrary commutative ring.\n* an identity element 1 ∈ ''V'', sometimes written <math>|0\\rangle</math> or {{math|Ω}} to indicate a vacuum state.\n* an [[endomorphism]] {{math|''T'' : ''V'' → ''V''}}, called \"translation\".  (Borcherds's original formulation included a system of divided powers of {{mvar|T}}, because he did not assume the ground ring was divisible.)\n* a linear multiplication map {{math|''Y'' : ''V'' ⊗ ''V'' → ''V''((''z''))}}, where {{math|''V''((''z''))}} is the space of all [[formal Laurent series]] with coefficients in {{mvar|V}}. This structure is alternatively presented as an infinite collection of bilinear products {{mvar|u<sub>n</sub>v}}, or as a left-multiplication map {{math|''V'' → End(''V'')[[''z''<sup>±1</sup>]]}}, called the state-field correspondence. For each {{math|''u'' ∈ ''V''}}, the operator-valued formal distribution {{math|''Y''(''u'', ''z'')}} is called a vertex operator or a field (inserted at zero), and the coefficient of {{math|''z''<sup>−''n''−1</sup>}} is the operator {{mvar|u<sub>n</sub>}}.  The standard notation for the multiplication is\n::<math>u \\otimes v \\mapsto Y(u,z)v = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{Z}} u_n v z^{-n-1}</math>.\n\n==== Axioms ====\nThese data are required to satisfy the following axioms:\n\n* '''Identity.''' For any {{math|''u'' ∈ ''V'', ''Y''(1, ''z'')''u'' {{=}} ''u'' {{=}} ''uz''<sup>0</sup>}} and {{math|''Y''(''u'', ''z'')1 ∈ ''u'' + ''zV''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>]]</nowiki>}}.{{Definition needed|Nonstandard notation|date=March 2019}}\n* '''Translation.''' {{math|''T''(1) {{=}} 0}}, and for any {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ''V''}},\n::<math>[T,Y(u,z)]v = TY(u,z)v - Y(u,z)Tv = \\frac{d}{dz}Y(u,z)v</math>\n\n* '''Locality (Jacobi identity, or Borcherds identity).''' For any {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, there exists a positive integer {{mvar|N}} such that:\n::<math> (z-x)^N Y(u, z) Y(v, x) = (z-x)^N Y(v, x) Y(u, z).</math>\n\n===== Equivalent formulations of locality axiom =====\nThe Locality axiom has several equivalent formulations in the literature, e.g., Frenkel-Lepowsky-Meurman introduced the Jacobi identity:\n\n:<math>\\forall u,v, w \\in V : \\qquad z^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{y-x}{z}\\right)Y(u,x)Y(v,y)w - z^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{-y+x}{z}\\right)Y(v,y)Y(u,x)w = y^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{x+z}{y}\\right)Y(Y(u,z)v,y)w,</math>\n\nwhere we define the formal delta series by:\n\n:<math>\\delta\\left(\\frac{y-x}{z}\\right) := \\sum_{s \\geq 0, r \\in \\mathbf{Z}} \\binom{r}{s} (-1)^s y^{r-s}x^s z^{-r}.</math>\n\nBorcherds <ref>{{harvnb|Borcherds|1986}}</ref> initially used the following two identities: for any vectors ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'', and integers ''m'' and ''n'' we have\n\n:<math>(u_m (v))_n (w) = \\sum_{i \\geq 0} (-1)^i \\binom{m}{i} \\left (u_{m-i} (v_{n+i} (w)) - (-1)^m v_{m+n-i} (u_i (w)) \\right)</math>\nand\n:<math> u_m v=\\sum_{i\\geq 0}(-1)^{m+i+1}\\frac{T^{i}}{i!}v_{m+i}u </math>.\n\nHe later gave a more expansive version that is equivalent but easier to use: for any vectors ''u'', ''v'', and ''w'', and integers ''m'', ''n'', and ''q'' we have\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbf{Z}} \\left(u_{q+i} (v) \\right )_{m+n-i} (w) = \\sum_{i\\in \\mathbf{Z}} (-1)^i \\binom{q}{i} \\left (u_{m+q-i} \\left(v_{n+i} (w) \\right ) - (-1)^q v_{n+q-i} \\left (u_{m+i} (w) \\right ) \\right)</math>\n\nFinally, there is a formal function version of locality: For any {{math|''u'', ''v'', ''w'' ∈ ''V''}}, there is an element\n\n:<math>X(u,v,w;z,x) \\in V[[z,x]] \\left[z^{-1}, x^{-1}, (z-x)^{-1} \\right]</math>\n\nsuch that {{math|''Y''(''u'', ''z'')''Y''(''v'', ''x'')''w''}} and {{math|''Y''(''v'', ''x'')''Y''(''u'', ''z'')''w''}} are the corresponding expansions of <math>X(u,v,w;z,x)</math> in {{math|''V''((''z''))((''x''))}} and {{math|''V''((''x''))((''z''))}}.\n\n===Vertex operator algebra ===\nA '''vertex operator algebra''' is a vertex algebra equipped with a '''conformal element''' {{mvar|ω}}, such that the vertex operator {{math|''Y''(''ω'', ''z'')}} is the weight two Virasoro field {{math|''L''(''z'')}}:\n\n:<math>Y(\\omega, z) = \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbf{Z}} \\omega_{n} {z^{-n-1}} = L(z) = \\sum_{n\\in\\mathbf{Z}} L_n z^{-n-2}</math>\n\nand satisfies the following properties:\n* [''L''<sub>m</sub>, ''L''<sub>n</sub>] = (''m'' − ''n'')''L''<sub>m+n</sub> + (δ<sub>m+n,0</sub>/12) (''m''<sup>3</sup> − ''m'')''c''  Id<sub>V</sub>, where ''c'' is a constant called the '''central charge''', or '''rank''' of {{mvar|V}}.  In particular, the coefficients of this vertex operator endow {{mvar|V}} with an action of the Virasoro algebra with central charge ''c''.\n* ''L''<sub>0</sub> acts semisimply on {{mvar|V}} with integer eigenvalues that are bounded below.\n* Under the grading provided by the eigenvalues of ''L''<sub>0</sub>, the multiplication on {{mvar|V}} is homogeneous in the sense that if ''u'' and ''v'' are homogeneous, then {{math|u<sub>n</sub>v}} is homogeneous of degree {{math|deg(''u'') + deg(''v'') − ''n'' − 1}}.\n* The identity 1 has degree 0, and the conformal element {{mvar|ω}} has degree 2.\n* ''L''<sub>−1</sub> = ''T''.\n\nA homomorphism of vertex algebras is a map of the underlying vector spaces that respects the additional identity, translation, and multiplication structure. Homomorphisms of vertex operator algebras have \"weak\" and \"strong\" forms, depending on whether they respect conformal vectors.\n\n==Commutative vertex algebras==\n\nA vertex algebra ''V'' is commutative if all vertex operators commute with each other.  This is equivalent to the property that all products ''Y''(''u'',''z'')''v'' lie in ''V''<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>]]</nowiki>.  Given a commutative vertex algebra, the constant terms of multiplication endow the vector space with a commutative ring structure, and ''T'' is a derivation.  Conversely, any commutative ring ''V'' with derivation ''T'' has a canonical vertex algebra structure, where we set ''Y''(''u'',''z'')''v'' = ''u''<sub>–1</sub>''v'' ''z''<sup>0</sup> = ''uv''.  If the derivation ''T'' vanishes, we may set ω = 0 to obtain a vertex operator algebra concentrated in degree zero.\n\nAny finite-dimensional vertex algebra is commutative.  In particular, even the smallest examples of noncommutative vertex algebras require significant introduction.\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nThe translation operator ''T'' in a vertex algebra induces infinitesimal symmetries on the product structure, and satisfies the following properties:\n\n* ''Y''(''u'',''z'')1 = ''e''<sup>zT</sup>''u''\n* ''Tu'' = ''u''<sub>–2</sub>1, so ''T'' is determined by ''Y''.\n* ''Y''(''Tu'',''z'') = ''d''(''Y''(''u'',''z''))/''dz''\n* ''e''<sup>xT</sup>''Y''(''u'',''z'')''e''<sup>−xT</sup> = ''Y''(''e''<sup>xT</sup>''u'',''z'') = ''Y''(''u'',''z''+''x'')\n* (skew-symmetry) ''Y''(''u'',''z'')''v'' = ''e''<sup>zT</sup>''Y''(''v'',–''z'')''u''\n\nFor a vertex operator algebra, the other Virasoro operators satisfy similar properties:\n\n* ''x''<sup>L<sub>0</sub></sup>''Y''(''u'',''z'')''x''<sup>−L<sub>0</sub></sup> = ''Y''(''x''<sup>L<sub>0</sub></sup>''u'',''xz'')\n* ''e''<sup>xL<sub>1</sub></sup>''Y''(''u'',''z'')''e''<sup>−xL<sub>1</sub></sup> = ''Y''(e<sup>x(1–xz)L<sub>1</sub></sup>(1–''xz'')<sup>−2L<sub>0</sub></sup>''u'',''z''(1–''xz'')<sup>−1</sup>)\n* (quasi-conformality) <math>[L_m, Y(u,z)] = \\sum_{k=0}^{m+1} \\binom{m+1}{k} z^k Y(L_{m-k}u, z)</math> for all ''m''≥–1.\n* (Associativity, or Cousin property): For any ''u'', ''v'', ''w'' ∈ ''V'', the element\n\n:<math>X(u,v,w;z,x) \\in V[[z,x]][z^{-1}, x^{-1}, (z-x)^{-1}]</math>\n\ngiven in the definition also expands to ''Y''(''Y''(''u'',''z''–''x'')''v'',''x'')''w'' in  ''V''((''x''))((''z''–''x'')).\n\nThe associativity property of a vertex algebra follows from the fact that the commutator of  ''Y''(''u'',''z'') and ''Y''(''v'',''x'') is annihilated by a finite power of ''z''–''x'', i.e., one can expand it as a finite linear combination of derivatives of the formal delta function in (''z''–''x''), with coefficients in End(''V'').\n\nReconstruction: Let ''V'' be a vertex algebra, and let {''J''<sup>a</sup>} be a set of vectors, with corresponding fields ''J''<sup>a</sup>(''z'') ∈ End(''V'')<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''z''<sup>±1</sup><nowiki>]]</nowiki>.  If ''V'' is spanned by monomials in the positive weight coefficients of the fields (i.e., finite products of operators ''J''<sup>a</sup><sub>n</sub> applied to 1, where ''n'' is negative), then we may write the operator product of such a monomial as a [[normally ordered product]] of divided power derivatives of fields (here, normal ordering means polar terms on the left are moved to the right).  Specifically,\n\n:<math>Y(J^{a_1}_{n_1+1}J^{a_2}_{n_2+1}...J^{a_k}_{n_k+1}1, z) = :\\frac{\\partial^{n_1}}{\\partial z^{n_1}}\\frac{J^{a_1}(z)}{n_1!}\\frac{\\partial^{n_2}}{\\partial z^{n_2}}\\frac{J^{a_2}(z)}{n_2!} \\cdots \\frac{\\partial^{n_k}}{\\partial z^{n_k}}\\frac{J^{a_k}(z)}{n_k!}:</math>\n\nMore generally, if one is given a vector space ''V'' with an endomorphism ''T'' and vector 1, and one assigns to a set of vectors ''J''<sup>a</sup> a set of fields ''J''<sup>a</sup>(''z'') ∈ End(''V'')[[''z''<sup>±1</sup>]] that are mutually local, whose positive weight coefficients generate ''V'', and that satisfy the identity and translation conditions, then the previous formula describes a vertex algebra structure.\n\n==Example: The rank 1 free boson==\n\nA basic example of a noncommutative vertex algebra is the rank 1 free boson, also called the Heisenberg vertex operator algebra.  It is \"generated\" by a single vector ''b'', in the sense that by applying the coefficients of the field ''b''(''z'') = ''Y''(''b'',''z'') to the vector ''1'', we obtain a spanning set.  The underlying vector space is the infinite-variable polynomial ring '''C'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,...], where for positive ''n'', the coefficient ''b''<sub>–n</sub> of ''Y''(''b'',''z'') acts as multiplication by ''x''<sub>n</sub>, and ''b''<sub>n</sub> acts as ''n'' times the partial derivative in ''x''<sub>n</sub>.  The action of ''b''<sub>0</sub> is multiplication by zero, producing the \"momentum zero\" Fock representation ''V''<sub>0</sub> of the Heisenberg Lie algebra (generated by ''b''<sub>n</sub> for integers ''n'', with commutation relations [''b''<sub>n</sub>,''b''<sub>m</sub>]=''n'' δ<sub>n,–m</sub>), i.e., induced by the trivial representation of the subalgebra spanned by ''b''<sub>n</sub>, n ≥ 0.\n\nThe Fock space ''V''<sub>0</sub> can be made into a vertex algebra by following reconstruction:\n\n:<math>Y( x_{n_1+1}x_{n_2+1}x_{n_3+1}...x_{n_k+1}, z) \\equiv \\frac{1}{n_1!n_2!..n_k!}:\\partial^{n_1}b(z)\\partial^{n_2}b(z)...\\partial^{n_k}b(z):</math>\n\nwhere :..: denotes normal ordering (i.e. moving all derivatives in ''x'' to the right).  The vertex operators may also be written as a functional of a multivariable function f as:\n\n:<math> Y[f,z] \\equiv :f(\\frac{b(z)}{0!},\\frac{b'(z)}{1!},\\frac{b''(z)}{2!},...): </math>\n\nif we understand that each term in the expansion of f is normal ordered.\n\nThe rank ''n'' free boson is given by taking an ''n''-fold tensor product of the rank 1 free boson.  For any vector ''b'' in ''n''-dimensional space, one has a field ''b''(''z'') whose coefficients are elements of the rank ''n'' Heisenberg algebra, whose commutation relations have an extra inner product term: [''b''<sub>n</sub>,''c''<sub>m</sub>]=''n'' (b,c) δ<sub>n,–m</sub>.\n\n==Example: Virasoro vertex operator algebras<!--'Virasoro constraint', 'Virasoro vertex operator algebra', 'Virasoro vertex operator algebras' redirect here--> ==\n\n'''Virasoro vertex operator algebras'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> are important for two reasons: First, the conformal element in a vertex operator algebra canonically induces a homomorphism from a Virasoro vertex operator algebra, so they play a universal role in the theory.  Second, they are intimately connected to the theory of unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra, and these play a major role in [[conformal field theory]].  In particular, the unitary Virasoro minimal models are simple quotients of these vertex algebras, and their tensor products provide a way to combinatorially construct more complicated vertex operator algebras.\n\nThe Virasoro vertex operator algebra is defined as an induced representation of the [[Virasoro algebra]]: If we choose a central charge ''c'', there is a unique one-dimensional module for the subalgebra '''C'''[z]∂<sub>z</sub> + ''K'' for which ''K'' acts by ''c''Id, and '''C'''[z]∂<sub>z</sub> acts trivially, and the corresponding induced module is spanned by polynomials in ''L''<sub>–n</sub> = –z<sup>−n–1</sup>∂<sub>z</sub> as ''n'' ranges over integers greater than 1.  The module then has partition function\n\n:<math>Tr_V q^{L_0} = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{R}} \\dim V_n q^n = \\prod_{n \\geq 2} (1-q^n)^{-1}</math>.\n\nThis space has a vertex operator algebra structure, where the vertex operators are defined by:\n\n:<math>Y(L_{-n_1-2}L_{-n_2-2}...L_{-n_k-2}|0\\rangle,z) \\equiv \\frac{1}{n_1!n_2!..n_k!}:\\partial^{n_1}L(z)\\partial^{n_2}L(z)...\\partial^{n_k}L(z):</math>\n\nand <math>\\omega = L_{-2}|0\\rangle</math>.  The fact that the Virasoro field ''L(z)'' is local with respect to itself can be deduced from the formula for its self-commutator:\n\n<math>[L(z),L(x)] =\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}L(x)\\right)w^{-1}\\delta \\left(\\frac{z}{x}\\right)-2L(x)x^{-1}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\delta \\left(\\frac{z}{x}\\right)-\\frac{1}{12}cx^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\right)^3\\delta \\left(\\frac{z}{x}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere ''c'' is the [[central charge]].\n\nGiven a vertex algebra homomorphism from a Virasoro vertex algebra of central charge ''c'' to any other vertex algebra, the vertex operator attached to the image of ω automatically satisfies the Virasoro relations, i.e., the image of ω is a conformal vector.  Conversely, any conformal vector in a vertex algebra induces a distinguished vertex algebra homomorphism from some Virasoro vertex operator algebra.\n\nThe Virasoro vertex operator algebras are simple, except when ''c'' has the form 1–6(''p''–''q'')<sup>2</sup>/''pq'' for coprime integers ''p'',''q'' strictly greater than 1 - this follows from Kac's determinant formula.  In these exceptional cases, one has a unique maximal ideal, and the corresponding quotient is called a minimal model.   When ''p'' = ''q''+1, the vertex algebras are unitary representations of Virasoro, and their modules are known as discrete series representations.  They play an important role in conformal field theory in part because they are unusually tractable, and for small ''p'', they correspond to well-known [[statistical mechanics]] systems at criticality, e.g., the [[Ising model]], the [[tri-critical Ising model]], the three-state [[Potts model]], etc.  By work of [[Weiqang Wang]] <ref>{{harvnb|Wang|1993}}</ref> concerning [[fusion rule]]s, we have a full description of the tensor categories of unitary minimal models.  For example, when ''c''=1/2 (Ising), there three irreducible modules with lowest ''L''<sub>0</sub>-weight 0, 1/2, and 1/16, and its fusion ring is '''Z'''[''x'',''y'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup>–1, ''y''<sup>2</sup>–''x''–1, ''xy''–''y'').\n\n==Example: WZW vacuum modules==\n\nBy replacing the [[Heisenberg algebra|Heisenberg Lie algebra]] with an untwisted [[affine Lie algebra|affine Kac–Moody Lie algebra]] (i.e., the universal [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of the [[loop algebra]] on a finite-dimensional simple [[Lie algebra]]), one may construct the vacuum representation in much the same way as the free boson vertex algebra is constructed.  Here, WZW refers to the [[Wess–Zumino–Witten model]], which produces the [[anomaly (physics)|anomaly]] that is interpreted as the central extension.\n\nConcretely, pulling back the central extension\n\n:<math>0 \\to \\mathbb{C} \\to \\hat{\\mathfrak{g}} \\to \\mathfrak{g}[t,t^{-1}] \\to 0</math>\n\nalong the inclusion <math>\\mathfrak{g}[t] \\to \\mathfrak{g}[t,t^{-1}]</math> yields a split extension, and the vacuum module is induced from the one-dimensional representation of the latter on which a central basis element acts by some chosen constant called the \"level\".  Since central elements can be identified with invariant inner products on the finite type Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one typically normalizes the level so that the [[Killing form]] has level twice the dual [[Coxeter number]].  Equivalently, level one gives the inner product for which the longest root has norm 2.  This matches the [[loop algebra]] convention, where levels are discretized by third cohomology of simply connected compact Lie groups.\n\nBy choosing a basis ''J''<sup>a</sup> of the finite type Lie algebra, one may form a basis of the affine Lie algebra using ''J''<sup>a</sup><sub>n</sub> = ''J''<sup>a</sup> ''t''<sup>n</sup> together with a central element ''K''.  By reconstruction, we can describe the vertex operators by [[normal order]]ed products of derivatives of the fields\n\n:<math>J^a(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty J^a_n z^{-n-1} = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty (J^a t^n) z^{-n-1}.</math>\n\nWhen the level is non-critical, i.e., the inner product is not minus one half of the Killing form, the vacuum representation has a conformal element, given by the [[Sugawara construction]].<ref>The history of the Sugawara construction is complicated, with several attempts required to get the formula correct.[http://mathoverflow.net/a/16406/121]</ref>  For any choice of dual bases ''J''<sup>a</sup>, ''J''<sub>a</sub> with respect to the level 1 inner product, the conformal element is\n\n:<math>\\omega = \\frac{1}{2(k+h^\\vee)} \\sum_a J_{a,-1} J^a_{-1} 1</math>\n\nand yields a vertex operator algebra whose [[central charge]] is <math>k \\cdot \\dim \\mathfrak{g}/(k+h^\\vee)</math>.  At critical level, the conformal structure is destroyed, since the denominator is zero, but one may produce operators ''L''<sub>n</sub> for ''n'' ≥ –1 by taking a limit as ''k'' approaches criticality.\n\nThis construction can be altered to work for the rank 1 free boson.  In fact, the Virasoro vectors form a one-parameter family ω<sub>s</sub> = 1/2 ''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + s ''x''<sub>2</sub>, endowing the resulting vertex operator algebras with central charge 1−12s<sup>2</sup>.  When ''s''=0, we have the following formula for the graded dimension:\n\n:<math>Tr_V q^{L_0} = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{Z}} \\dim V_n q^n = \\prod_{n \\geq 1} (1-q^n)^{-1}</math>\n\nThis is known as the [[generating function]] for [[partition function (quantum field theory)|partition]]s, and is also written as ''q''<sup>1/24</sup> times the weight −1/2 modular form 1/η (the [[Dedekind eta function]]).  The rank ''n'' free boson then has an ''n'' parameter family of Virasoro vectors, and when those parameters are zero, the character is ''q''<sup>n/24</sup> times the weight −''n''/2 modular form η<sup>−n</sup>.\n\n==Modules==\n\nMuch like ordinary rings, vertex algebras admit a notion of module, or representation.  Modules play an important role in conformal field theory, where they are often called sectors.  A standard assumption in the physics literature is that the full [[Hilbert space]] of a conformal field theory decomposes into a sum of tensor products of left-moving and right-moving sectors:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{H} \\cong \\bigoplus_{i \\in I} M_i \\otimes \\overline{M_i}</math>\n\nThat is, a conformal field theory has a vertex operator algebra of left-moving chiral symmetries, a vertex operator algebra of right-moving chiral symmetries, and the sectors moving in a given direction are modules for the corresponding vertex operator algebra.\n\nGiven a vertex algebra ''V'' with multiplication ''Y'', a ''V''-module is a vector space ''M'' equipped with an action ''Y''<sup>M</sup>: ''V'' ⊗ ''M'' → ''M''((''z'')), satisfying the following conditions:\n\n: (Identity) ''Y''<sup>M</sup>(1,z) = Id<sub>M</sub>\n: (Associativity, or Jacobi identity) For any ''u'', ''v'' ∈ ''V'', ''w'' ∈ ''M'', there is an element\n\n:<math>X(u,v,w;z,x) \\in M[[z,x]][z^{-1}, x^{-1}, (z-x)^{-1}]</math>\n\nsuch that ''Y''<sup>M</sup>(''u'',''z'')''Y''<sup>M</sup>(''v'',''x'')''w'' and ''Y''<sup>M</sup>(''Y''(''u'',''z''–''x'')''v'',''x'')''w''\nare the corresponding expansions of <math>X(u,v,w;z,x)</math> in ''M''((''z''))((''x'')) and ''M''((''x''))((''z''–''x'')).\nEquivalently, the following \"[[Jacobi identity]]\" holds:\n\n:<math>z^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{y-x}{z}\\right)Y^M(u,x)Y^M(v,y)w - z^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{-y+x}{z}\\right)Y^M(v,y)Y^M(u,x)w = y^{-1}\\delta\\left(\\frac{x+z}{y}\\right)Y^M(Y(u,z)v,y)w.</math>\n\nThe modules of a vertex algebra form an [[abelian category]].  When working with vertex operator algebras, the previous definition is given the name \"[[weak module]]\", and ''V''-modules are required to satisfy the additional condition that ''L''<sub>0</sub> acts semisimply with finite-dimensional eigenspaces and eigenvalues bounded below in each coset of '''Z'''.  Work of Huang, Lepowsky, Miyamoto, and Zhang has shown at various levels of generality that modules of a vertex operator algebra admit a fusion tensor product operation, and form a [[braided tensor category]].\n\nWhen the category of ''V''-modules is semisimple with finitely many irreducible objects, the vertex operator algebra ''V'' is called rational.  Rational vertex operator algebras satisfying an additional finiteness hypothesis (known as Zhu's ''C''<sub>2</sub>-cofiniteness condition) are known to be particularly well-behaved, and are called \"regular\".  For example, Zhu's 1996 modular invariance theorem asserts that the characters of modules of a regular VOA form a vector-valued representation of ''SL''<sub>2</sub>('''Z''').  In particular, if a VOA is ''holomorphic'', i.e., its representation category is equivalent to that of vector spaces, then its partition function is ''SL''<sub>2</sub>('''Z''')-invariant up to a constant.  Huang showed that the category of modules of a regular VOA is a [[modular tensor category]], and its fusion rules satisfy the [[Verlinde formula]].\n\nTo connect with our first example, the irreducible modules of the rank 1 free boson are given by [[Fock space]]s ''V''<sub>λ</sub> with some fixed momentum λ, i.e., induced representations of the [[Heisenberg algebra|Heisenberg Lie algebra]], where the element ''b''<sub>0</sub> acts by scalar multiplication by λ.  The space can be written as '''C'''[''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,...]''v''<sub>λ</sub>, where ''v''<sub>λ</sub> is a distinguished ground-state vector.  The module category is not semisimple, since one may induce a representation of the abelian Lie algebra where ''b''<sub>0</sub> acts by a nontrivial [[Jordan block]].  For the rank ''n'' free boson, one has an irreducible module ''V''<sub>λ</sub> for each vector λ in complex ''n''-dimensional space.  Each vector ''b'' ∈ '''C'''<sup>n</sup> yields the operator ''b''<sub>0</sub>, and the Fock space ''V''<sub>λ</sub> is distinguished by the property that each such ''b''<sub>0</sub> acts as scalar multiplication by the inner product (''b'',λ).\n\nUnlike ordinary rings, vertex algebras admit a notion of twisted module attached to an automorphism.  For an automorphism σ of order ''N'', the action has the form ''V'' ⊗ ''M'' → ''M''((''z''<sup>1/N</sup>)), with the following [[monodromy]] condition: if ''u'' ∈ ''V'' satisfies σ ''u'' = exp(2π''ik''/''N'')''u'', then ''u''<sub>n</sub> = 0 unless ''n'' satisfies ''n''+''k''/''N'' ∈ '''Z''' (there is some disagreement about signs among specialists).  Geometrically, twisted modules can be attached to branch points on an algebraic curve with a [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramified]] [[Galois cover]].  In the conformal field theory literature, twisted modules are called [[twisted sector]]s, and are intimately connected with string theory on [[orbifold]]s.\n\n== Vertex operator algebra defined by an even lattice==\nThe lattice vertex algebra construction was the original motivation for defining vertex algebras. It is constructed by taking a sum of irreducible modules for the free boson corresponding to lattice vectors, and defining a multiplication operation by specifying intertwining operators between them. That is, if {{math|Λ}} is an even lattice, the lattice vertex algebra {{math|''V''<sub>Λ</sub>}} decomposes into free bosonic modules as:\n\n:<math>V_\\Lambda \\cong \\bigoplus_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} V_\\lambda</math>\n\nLattice vertex algebras are canonically attached to double covers of [[even integral lattices]], rather than the lattices themselves. While each such lattice has a unique lattice vertex algebra up to isomorphism, the vertex algebra construction is not functorial, because lattice automorphisms have an ambiguity in lifting.<ref>{{harvnb|Borcherds|1986}}</ref>\n\nThe double covers in question are uniquely determined up to isomorphism by the following rule: elements have the form {{mvar|±e<sub>α</sub>}} for lattice vectors {{math|''α'' ∈ Λ}} (i.e., there is a map to {{math|Λ}} sending {{mvar|e<sub>α</sub>}} to α that forgets signs), and multiplication satisfies the relations ''e''<sub>α</sub>''e''<sub>β</sub> = (–1)<sup>(α,β)</sup>''e''<sub>β</sub>''e''<sub>α</sub>. Another way to describe this is that given an even lattice {{math|Λ}}, there is a unique (up to coboundary) normalised [[Group cohomology|cocycle]] {{math|''ε''(''α'', ''β'')}} with values {{math|±1}} such that {{math|(−1)<sup>(''α'',''β'')</sup> {{=}} ''ε''(''α'', ''β'') ''ε''(''β'', ''α'')}}, where the normalization condition is that ε(α,0) = ε(0,α) = 1 for all {{math|''α'' ∈ Λ}}. This cocycle induces a central extension of {{math|Λ}} by a group of order 2, and we obtain a twisted group ring {{math|'''C'''<sub>''ε''</sub>[Λ]}} with basis {{math|''e<sub>α</sub>'' (''α'' ∈ Λ)}}, and multiplication rule {{math|''e<sub>α</sub>e<sub>β</sub>'' {{=}} ''ε''(''α'', ''β'')''e''<sub>''α''+''β''</sub>}} - the cocycle condition on {{mvar|ε}} ensures associativity of the ring.<ref>{{harvnb|Kac|1998}}</ref>\n\nThe vertex operator attached to lowest weight vector {{mvar|v<sub>λ</sub>}} in the Fock space {{mvar|V<sub>λ</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>Y(v_\\lambda,z) = e_\\lambda :\\exp \\int \\lambda(z): = e_\\lambda z^\\lambda \\exp \\left (\\sum_{n<0} \\lambda_n \\frac{z^{-n}}{n} \\right )\\exp \\left (\\sum_{n>0} \\lambda_n \\frac{z^{-n}}{n} \\right ),</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|z<sup>λ</sup>}} is a shorthand for the linear map that takes any element of the α-Fock space {{mvar|V<sub>α</sub>}} to the monomial {{math|''z''<sup>(''λ'',''α'')</sup>}}. The vertex operators for other elements of the Fock space are then determined by reconstruction.\n\nAs in the case of the free boson, one has a choice of conformal vector, given by an element ''s'' of the vector space {{math|Λ ⊗ '''C'''}}, but the condition that the extra Fock spaces have integer ''L''<sub>0</sub> eigenvalues constrains the choice of ''s'': for an orthonormal basis {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}}, the vector 1/2 ''x''<sub>i,1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''s''<sub>2</sub> must satisfy {{math|(''s'', ''λ'') ∈ '''Z'''}} for all λ ∈ Λ, i.e., ''s'' lies in the dual lattice.\n\nIf the even lattice {{math|Λ}} is generated by its \"root vectors\" (those satisfying (α,α)=2), and any two root vectors are joined by a chain of root vectors with consecutive inner products non-zero then the vertex operator algebra is the unique simple quotient of the vacuum module of the affine Kac–Moody algebra of the corresponding simply laced simple Lie algebra at level one.  This is known as the Frenkel–Kac (or [[Igor Frenkel|Frenkel]]&ndash;[[Victor Kac|Kac]]&ndash;[[Graeme Segal|Segal]]) construction, and is based on the earlier construction by [[Sergio Fubini]] and [[Gabriele Veneziano]] of the [[tachyon|tachyonic vertex operator]] in the [[dual resonance model]]. Among other features, the zero modes of the vertex operators corresponding to root vectors give a construction of the underlying simple Lie algebra, related to a presentation originally due to [[Jacques Tits]].  In particular, one obtains a construction of all ADE type Lie groups directly from their root lattices. And this is commonly considered the simplest way to construct the 248 dimensional group ''E''<sub>8</sub>.<ref>{{harvnb|Kac|1998}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Frenkel|Meurman|Lepowsky|1988}}</ref>\n\n== Vertex operator superalgebras==\n\nBy allowing the underlying vector space to be a superspace (i.e., a '''Z'''/2'''Z'''-graded vector space <math> V=V_+\\oplus V_-</math>) one can define a ''vertex superalgebra'' by the same data as a vertex algebra, with 1 in ''V''<sub>+</sub> and ''T'' an even operator.  The axioms are essentially the same, but one must incorporate suitable signs into the locality axiom, or one of the equivalent formulations.  That is, if ''a'' and ''b'' are homogeneous, one compares ''Y''(''a'',''z'')''Y''(''b'',''w'') with ε''Y''(''b'',''w'')''Y''(''a'',''z''), where ε is –1 if both ''a'' and ''b'' are odd and 1 otherwise.  If in addition there is a Virasoro element ω in the even part of ''V''<sub>2</sub>, and the usual grading restrictions are satisfied, then ''V'' is called a ''vertex operator superalgebra''.\n\nOne of the simplest examples is the vertex operator superalgebra generated by a single free fermion ψ.  As a Virasoro representation, it has central charge 1/2, and decomposes as a direct sum of Ising modules of lowest weight 0 and 1/2.  One may also describe it as a spin representation of the Clifford algebra on the quadratic space ''t''<sup>1/2</sup>'''C'''[''t'',''t''<sup>−1</sup>](''dt'')<sup>1/2</sup> with residue pairing.  The vertex operator superalgebra is holomorphic, in the sense that all modules are direct sums of itself, i.e., the module category is equivalent to the category of vector spaces.\n\nThe tensor square of the free fermion is called the free charged fermion, and by Boson-Fermion correspondence, it is isomorphic to the lattice vertex superalgebra attached to the odd lattice '''Z'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Kac|1998}}</ref>  This correspondence has been used by Date-Jimbo-Kashiwara-Miwa to construct [[soliton]] solutions to the [[KP hierarchy]] of nonlinear PDEs.\n\n== Superconformal structures ==\n\nThe Virasoro algebra has some [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric extensions]] that naturally appear in [[superconformal field theory]] and [[superstring theory]].  The ''N''=1, 2, and 4 [[superconformal algebra]]s are of particular importance.\n\nInfinitesimal holomorphic superconformal transformations of a [[supercurve]] (with one even local coordinate ''z'' and ''N'' odd local coordinates θ<sub>1</sub>,...,θ<sub>N</sub>) are generated by the coefficients of a super-stress–energy tensor ''T''(z,θ<sub>1</sub>,...,θ<sub>N</sub>).\n\nWhen ''N''=1, ''T'' has odd part given by a Virasoro field ''L''(''z''), and even part given by a field\n\n:<math>G(z) = \\sum_n G_n z^{-n-3/2}</math>\n\nsubject to commutation relations\n\n* <math>[G_m,L_n] = (m-n/2)G_{m+n}</math>\n* <math>[G_m,G_n] = (m-n)L_{m+n} + \\delta_{m,-n} \\frac{4m^2+1}{12}c</math>\n\nBy examining the symmetry of the operator products, one finds that there are two possibilities for the field ''G'': the indices ''n'' are either all integers, yielding the [[Ramond algebra]], or all half-integers, yielding the [[Neveu-Schwarz algebra]].  These algebras have unitary discrete series representations at [[central charge]]\n\n:<math>\\hat{c} = \\frac{2}{3}c = 1-\\frac{8}{m(m+2)} \\quad m \\geq 3</math>\n\nand unitary representations for all ''c'' greater than 3/2, with lowest weight ''h'' only constrained by ''h''≥ 0 for Neveu-Schwartz and ''h'' ≥ ''c''/24 for Ramond.\n\nAn ''N''=1 superconformal vector in a vertex operator algebra ''V'' of central charge ''c'' is an odd element τ ∈ ''V'' of weight 3/2, such that\n:<math>Y(\\tau,z) = G(z) = \\sum_{m \\in \\mathbb{Z}+1/2} G_n z^{-n-3/2},</math>\n''G''<sub>−1/2</sub>τ =  ω, and the coefficients of ''G''(''z'') yield an action of the ''N''=1 Neveu-Schwarz algebra at central charge ''c''.\n\nFor ''N''=2 supersymmetry, one obtains even fields ''L''(''z'') and ''J''(''z''), and odd fields ''G''<sup>+</sup>(z) and ''G''<sup>−</sup>(z).  The field ''J''(''z'') generates an action of the Heisenberg algebras (described by physicists as a ''U''(1) current).  There are both Ramond and Neveu-Schwartz ''N''=2 superconformal algebras, depending on whether the indexing on the ''G'' fields is integral or half-integral.  However, the ''U''(1) current gives rise to a one-parameter family of isomorphic superconformal algebras interpolating between Ramond and Neveu-Schwartz, and this deformation of structure is known as spectral flow.  The unitary representations are given by discrete series with central charge ''c'' = 3-6/''m'' for integers ''m'' at least 3, and a continuum of lowest weights for ''c'' &gt; 3.\n\nAn ''N''=2 superconformal structure on a vertex operator algebra is a pair of odd elements τ<sup>+</sup>, τ<sup>−</sup> of weight 3/2, and an even element µ of weight 1 such that τ<sup>±</sup> generate ''G''<sup>±</sup>(z), and µ generates ''J''(''z'').\n\nFor ''N''=3 and 4, unitary representations only have central charges in a discrete family, with ''c''=3''k''/2 and 6''k'', respectively, as ''k'' ranges over positive integers.\n\n== Additional constructions ==\n\n* Fixed point subalgebras: Given an action of a symmetry group on a vertex operator algebra, the subalgebra of fixed vectors is also a vertex operator algebra.  In 2013, Miyamoto proved that two important finiteness properties, namely Zhu's condition C<sub>2</sub> and regularity, are preserved when taking fixed points under finite solvable group actions.\n* Current extensions: Given a vertex operator algebra and some modules of integral conformal weight, one may under favorable circumstances describe a vertex operator algebra structure on the direct sum.  Lattice vertex algebras are a standard example of this.  Another family of examples are framed VOAs, which start with tensor products of Ising models, and add modules that correspond to suitably even codes.\n* Orbifolds: Given a finite cyclic group acting on a holomorphic VOA, it is conjectured that one may construct a second holomorphic VOA by adjoining irreducible twisted modules and taking fixed points under an induced automorphism, as long as those twisted modules have suitable conformal weight.  This is known to be true in special cases, e.g., groups of order at most 3 acting on lattice VOAs.\n* The coset construction (due to Goddard, Kent, and Olive): Given a vertex operator algebra ''V'' of central charge ''c'' and a set ''S'' of vectors, one may define the commutant ''C''(''V'',''S'') to be the subspace of vectors ''v'' strictly commute with all fields coming from ''S'', i.e., such that ''Y''(''s'',''z'')''v'' ∈ V<nowiki>[[</nowiki>''z''<nowiki>]]</nowiki> for all ''s'' ∈ ''S''.  This turns out to be a vertex subalgebra, with ''Y'', ''T'', and identity inherited from ''V''.   and if ''S'' is a VOA of central charge ''c''<sub>S</sub>, the commutant is a VOA of central charge ''c''–''c''<sub>S</sub>.  For example, the embedding of ''SU''(2) at level ''k''+1 into the tensor product of two ''SU''(2) algebras at levels ''k'' and 1 yields the Virasoro discrete series with ''p''=''k''+2, ''q''=''k''+3, and this was used to prove their existence in the 1980s.  Again with ''SU''(2), the embedding of level ''k''+2 into the tensor product of level ''k'' and level 2 yields the ''N''=1 superconformal discrete series.\n* BRST reduction: For any degree 1 vector ''v'' satisfying ''v''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>=0, the cohomology of this operator has a graded vertex superalgebra structure.  More generally, one may use any weight 1 field whose residue has square zero.  The usual method is to tensor with fermions, as one then has a canonical differential.  An important special case is quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction applied to affine Kac–Moody algebras to obtain affine ''W''-algebras as degree 0 cohomology.  These ''W'' algebras also admit constructions as vertex subalgebras of free bosons given by kernels of screening operators.\n\n==Additional examples==\n* The [[monster vertex algebra]] <math>V^\\natural</math> (also called the \"moonshine module\"), the key to Borcherds's proof of the [[Monstrous moonshine]] conjectures, was constructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman in 1988.  It is notable because its partition function is the modular invariant ''j''–744, and its automorphism group is the largest sporadic simple group, known as the [[monster group]].  It is constructed by orbifolding the Leech lattice VOA by the order 2 automorphism induced by reflecting the Leech lattice in the origin.  That is, one forms the direct sum of the Leech lattice VOA with the twisted module, and takes the fixed points under an induced involution.  Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman conjectured in 1988 that <math>V^\\natural</math> is the unique holomorphic vertex operator algebra with central charge 24, and partition function ''j''–744.  This conjecture is still open.\n*Chiral de Rham complex: Malikov, Schechtman, and Vaintrob showed that by a method of localization, one may canonically attach a bcβγ (boson-fermion superfield) system to a smooth complex manifold.  This complex of sheaves has a distinguished differential, and the global cohomology is a vertex superalgebra.  Ben-Zvi, Heluani, and Szczesny showed that a Riemannian metric on the manifold induces an ''N''=1 superconformal structure, which is promoted to an ''N''=2 structure if the metric is Kähler and Ricci-flat, and a hyperKähler structure induces an ''N''=4 structure.  Borisov and Libgober showed that one may obtain the two-variable [[elliptic genus]] of a compact complex manifold from the cohomology of Chiral de Rham - if the manifold is Calabi-Yau, then this genus is a weak [[Jacobi form]].\n\n==Related algebraic structures==\n\n* If one considers only the singular part of the OPE in a vertex algebra, one arrives at the definition of a [[Lie conformal algebra]]. Since one is often only concerned with the singular part of the OPE, this makes Lie conformal algebras a natural object to study.  There is a functor from vertex algebras to Lie conformal algebras that forgets the regular part of OPEs, and it has a left adjoint, called the \"universal vertex algebra\" functor.  Vacuum modules of affine Kac–Moody algebras and Virasoro vertex algebras are universal vertex algebras, and in particular, they can be described very concisely once the background theory is developed.\n* There are several generalizations of the notion of vertex algebra in the literature.  Some mild generalizations involve a weakening of the locality axiom to allow monodromy, e.g., the ''abelian intertwining algebras'' of Dong and Lepowsky.  One may view these roughly as vertex algebra objects in a braided tensor category of graded vector spaces, in much the same way that a vertex superalgebra is such an object in the category of super vector spaces.  More complicated generalizations relate to ''q''-deformations and representations of quantum groups, such as in work of Frenkel–Reshetikhin, Etingof–Kazhdan, and Li.\n* Beilinson and Drinfeld introduced a sheaf-theoretic notion of ''[[chiral algebra]]'' that is closely related to the notion of vertex algebra, but is defined without using any visible power series.  Given an [[algebraic curve]] ''X'', a chiral algebra on ''X'' is a ''D''<sub>X</sub>-module ''A'' equipped with a multiplication operation <math>j_*j^*(A \\boxtimes A) \\to \\Delta_* A</math> on ''X''×''X'' that satisfies an associativity condition.  They also introduced an equivalent notion of ''factorization algebra'' that is a system of quasicoherent sheaves on all finite products of the curve, together with a compatibility condition involving pullbacks to the complement of various diagonals.  Any translation-equivariant chiral algebra on the affine line can be identified with a vertex algebra by taking the fiber at a point, and there is a natural way to attach a chiral algebra on a smooth algebraic curve to any vertex operator algebra.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Operator algebra]]\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|first=Richard |last=Borcherds| authorlink=Richard Borcherds|title=Vertex algebras, Kac-Moody algebras, and the Monster|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=83|year=1986|pages= 3068–3071|doi=10.1073/pnas.83.10.3068|bibcode = 1986PNAS...83.3068B|pmid=16593694|pmc=323452}}\n* {{citation|first=Igor|last=Frenkel|authorlink1=Igor Frenkel|first2= James|last2= Lepowsky|authorlink2=James Lepowsky|first3= Arne|last3= Meurman|title=Vertex operator algebras and the Monster|series=Pure and Applied Mathematics|volume= 134|publisher=Academic Press|year=1988|isbn= 0-12-267065-5}}\n* {{citation|first=Victor|last=Kac|authorlink=Victor Kac|title=Vertex algebras for beginners|series=University Lecture Series|volume= 10|publisher= [[American Mathematical Society]]|edition=2nd|year= 1998|isbn= 0-8218-1396-X}}\n* {{citation|first=Edward|last=Frenkel|authorlink1=Edward Frenkel|first2= David|last2= Ben-Zvi|title=Vertex algebras and Algebraic Curves|series=Mathematical Surveys and Monographs|number= 88|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year= 2001|isbn=0-8218-2894-0}}\n* {{citation|first=Weiqiang |last=Wang| authorlink=Weiqiang Wang|title=Rationality of Virasoro vertex operator algebras|journal=Duke Math.

Di Francesco, P. Mathieu, and D. Sénéchal, ''Conformal Field Theory'', 1997, {{ISBN|0-387-94785-X}}</ref>\n\nA highest weight representation is spanned by eigenstates of <math>L_0</math>. The eigenvalues take the form <math>h+N</math>, where the integer <math>N\\geq 0</math> is called the '''level''' of the corresponding eigenstate. \n\nMore precisely, a highest weight representation is spanned by <math>L_0</math>-eigenstates of the type <math>L_{-n_1}L_{-n_2}\\cdots L_{-n_k}v</math> with <math>0<n_1\\leq n_2\\leq \\cdots n_k</math> and <math>k\\geq 0</math>, whose levels are <math>N=\\sum_{i=1}^k n_i</math>. Any state whose level is not zero is called a '''descendant state''' of <math>v</math>.\n\nFor any pair of complex numbers {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}}, the [[Verma module]] <math>\\mathcal V_{c,h}</math> is \nthe largest possible highest weight representation. (The same letter, {{mvar|c}}, is used for both the element {{mvar|c}} of the Virasoro algebra and its eigenvalue in a representation.) \n\nThe states <math>L_{-n_1}L_{-n_2}\\cdots L_{-n_k}v</math> with <math>0<n_1\\leq n_2\\leq \\cdots n_k</math> and <math>k\\geq 0</math> form a basis of the Verma module. The Verma module is indecomposable, and for generic values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} it is also irreducible. When it is reducible, there exist other highest weight representations with these values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}}, called '''degenerate representations''', which are cosets of the Verma module. In particular,\nthe unique irreducible highest weight representation with these values of {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} is the quotient of the Verma module by its maximal submodule.\n\nA Verma module is irreducible if and only if it has no singular vectors.\n\n===Singular vectors===\nA '''singular vector''' or '''null vector''' of a highest weight representation is a state that is both descendent and primary. \n\nA sufficient condition for the Verma module <math>\\mathcal V_{c,h}</math> to have a singular vector at the level {{mvar|N}} is <math>h=h_{r,s}(c)</math> for some positive integers {{math|''r,s''}} such that {{mvar|N}}={{math|''rs''}}, with\n:<math> h_{r,s}(c) = \\frac14\\Big((b+b^{-1})^2 - (br + b^{-1}s)^2\\Big)\\ ,\\quad \\text{where} \\quad c=1+6(b+b^{-1})^2\\ . </math>\nIn particular, <math> h_{1,1}(c) = 0</math>, and the reducible Verma module <math>\\mathcal V_{c,0}</math> has a singular vector <math> L_{-1}v </math> at the level {{mvar|N}}=1. Then <math> h_{2,1}(c) = -\\frac12 - \\frac34 b^2 </math>, and the corresponding reducible Verma module has a singular vector <math> (L_{-1}^2 + b^2 L_{-2})v </math> at the level {{mvar|N}}=2.\n\nThis condition for the existence of a singular vector at the level <math>N</math> is not necessary. In particular, there is a singular vector at the level <math>N</math> if <math> N = rs + r's'</math> with <math> h=h_{r,s}(c)</math> and <math> h+rs = h_{r',s'}(c)</math>. This singular vector is now a descendent of another singular vector at the level <math>rs</math>. This type of singular vectors can however only exist if the central charge is of the type <math> c = 1-6\\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}</math> with <math>p,q\\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>. (For <math>p>q\\geq 2</math> coprime, these are the central charges of the [[minimal models]].)<ref name=\"BYB\"/>\n\n===Hermitian form and unitarity===\nA highest weight representation with a real value of <math>c</math> has a unique [[Hermitian form]] such that the adjoint of <math>L_n</math> is <math>L_{-n}</math>, and the norm of the primary state is one.\nThe representation is called '''unitary''' if that Hermitian form is positive definite. \nSince any singular vector has zero norm, all unitary highest weight representations are irreducible. \n\nThe [[Gram determinant]] of a basis of the level <math>N</math> is given by the '''Kac determinant formula''', \n:<math>  A_N\\prod_{1\\le r,s\\le N}(h-h_{r,s}(c))^{p(N-rs)} ~,</math>\nwhere the function ''p''(''N'') is the [[partition function (number theory)|partition function]], and ''A''<sub>''N''</sub> is a positive constant that does not depend on <math>h</math> or <math>c</math>. \nThe Kac determinant formula was stated by [[V. Kac]] (1978), and its first published proof was given by Feigin and Fuks (1984).\n\nThe irreducible highest weight representation with values  {{mvar|h}} and {{mvar|c}} is unitary  if and only if either {{mvar|c}} ≥1 and  {{mvar|h}}≥0, or {{mvar|c}} is one of the values\n:<math> c = 1-{6\\over m(m+1)} = 0,\\quad 1/2,\\quad 7/10,\\quad 4/5,\\quad 6/7,\\quad 25/28, \\ldots</math>\nfor ''m'' = 2, 3, 4, ...,  and ''h'' is one of the values \n:<math> h = h_{r,s}(c) = {((m+1)r-ms)^2-1 \\over 4m(m+1)}</math>\nfor ''r'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., ''m''&minus;1 and ''s''= 1, 2, 3, ..., ''r''.\n\n[[Daniel Friedan]], Zongan Qiu, and [[Stephen Shenker]] (1984) showed that these conditions are necessary, and [[Peter Goddard (physicist)|Peter Goddard]], Adrian Kent, and [[David Olive]] (1986) used the [[coset construction]] or [[GKO construction]] (identifying unitary representations of the Virasoro algebra within tensor products of unitary representations of affine [[Kac–Moody algebra]]s) to show that they are sufficient.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Conformal field theory===\nIn two dimensions, the algebra of local [[conformal map|conformal transformations]] is made of two copies of the [[Witt algebra]].\nIt follows that the symmetry algebra of [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]] is the Virasoro algebra. Technically, the [[conformal bootstrap]] approach to two-dimensional CFT relies on [[Virasoro conformal block|Virasoro conformal blocks]], special functions that include and generalize the characters of representations of the Virasoro algebra.\n\n===String theory===\nSince the Virasoro algebra comprises the generators of the conformal group of the [[worldsheet]], the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress tensor]] in [[string theory]] obeys the commutation relations of (two copies of) the Virasoro algebra.  This is because the conformal group decomposes into separate diffeomorphisms of the forward and back lightcones.  Diffeomorphism invariance of the worldsheet implies additionally that the stress tensor vanishes.  This is known as the [[Virasoro constraint]], and in the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], cannot be applied to all the states in the theory, but rather only on the physical states (compare [[Gupta–Bleuler formalism]]).\n\n==Generalizations==\n{{see also|Super Virasoro algebra}}\nThere are two [[Lie superalgebra|supersymmetric N=1 extensions]] of the Virasoro algebra, called the [[Neveu-Schwarz algebra]] and the [[Ramond algebra]]. Their theory is similar to that of the Virasoro algebra, now involving [[Grassmann number]]s. There are further extensions of these algebras with more supersymmetry, such as the [[N = 2 superconformal algebra]].\n\nThe Virasoro algebra is a central extension of the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields on a genus 0 Riemann surface that are holomorphic except at two fixed points. \nI V  Krichever and S P Novikov (1987) found a central extension of the Lie algebra of meromorphic vector fields on a higher genus compact Riemann surface  that are holomorphic except at two fixed points, and their analysis has been extended to supermanifolds by J Rabin (1995).\n\nThe Virasoro algebra also has [[Vertex Operator Algebra|vertex algebraic]] and [[Lie conformal algebra|conformal algebraic]] counterparts, which basically come from arranging all the basis elements into generating series and working with single objects. Unsurprisingly these are called the vertex Virasoro and conformal Virasoro algebras respectively.\n\nThe Virasoro algebra may also be specified as a [[Presentation of a group|presentation]].  This is to say that all of its generators may be determined recursively (\"generated\") out of merely '''two''' judiciously chosen generators (e.g. {{mvar|L}}<sub>3</sub> and {{mvar|L}}<sub>−2</sub>), and six equations (constraint conditions) among them, by systematic use of the [[Jacobi identity]].  (D Fairlie, J Nuyts, and C Zachos, 1988. Shortly thereafter, J Uretsky discovered the original 8 conditions could be pared down to six.)\n\nCorrespondingly, for the [[super Virasoro algebra]] extension, the Ramond algebra follows from two generating generators and five conditions; and the Neveu-Schwarz algebra out of two such and nine conditions.\n\n==History<!--'Virasoro operator' and 'Virasoro operators' redirect here-->==\nThe Witt algebra (the Virasoro algebra without the central extension) was discovered by [[É. Cartan]] (1909). Its analogues over finite fields were studied by [[E. Witt]] in about the 1930s. The central extension of the Witt algebra that gives the Virasoro algebra was first found (in characteristic ''p'' &gt; 0) by [[R. E. Block]] (1966, page 381) and independently rediscovered (in characteristic 0) by [[I. M. Gelfand]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Dmitry Fuchs{{!}}D. B. Fuchs|de|3=Dmitry Borisovich Fuchs}} (1968). Virasoro (1970) wrote down some operators generating the Virasoso algebra (later known as the '''Virasoro operators'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->) while studying [[dual resonance model]]s, though  he did not find the central extension.  The central extension giving the Virasoro algebra was rediscovered in physics shortly after by J. H. Weis, according to Brower and Thorn (1971, footnote on page 167).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Witt algebra]]\n*[[Heisenberg algebra]]\n*[[WZW model]]\n*[[Conformal field theory]]\n*[[Goddard–Thorn theorem]]\n*[[Lie conformal algebra]]\n*[[Super Virasoro algebra]]\n*[[W-algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |author=[[Alexander Belavin]], [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]] and [[Alexander Zamolodchikov]] |year=1984 |title=Infinite conformal symmetry in two-dimensional quantum field theory |journal=[[Nuclear Physics B]] |volume=241 |pages=333–380 |doi=10.1016/0550-3213(84)90052-X |issue=2|bibcode = 1984NuPhB.241..333B }}\n*{{cite journal |author=R.

      "text": "In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[representation theory]], a '''weight''' of an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' over a field '''F''' is an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''A'' to '''F''', or equivalently, a one-dimensional [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]] of ''A'' over '''F'''. It is the algebra analogue of a [[multiplicative character]] of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The importance of the concept, however, stems from its application to [[Lie algebra representation|representations]] of [[Lie algebra]]s and hence also to [[group representation|representations]] of [[Algebraic group|algebraic]] and [[Lie group]]s. In this context, a '''weight of a representation''' is a generalization of the notion of an [[eigenvalue]], and the corresponding [[eigenspace]] is called a '''weight space'''.\n\n==Motivation and general concept==\n\nGiven a set ''S'' of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], each of which is [[diagonalizable matrix|diagonalizable]], and any two of which [[commuting matrices|commute]], it is always possible to [[simultaneously diagonalize]] all of the elements of ''S''.<ref group=\"note\">The converse is also true – a set of diagonalizable matrices commutes if and only if the set is simultaneously diagonalisable {{harv|Horn|Johnson|1985|pp=51–53}}.</ref><ref group=\"note\">In fact, given a set of commuting matrices over an algebraically closed field, they are [[simultaneously triangularizable]], without needing to assume that they are diagonalizable.</ref> Equivalently, for any set ''S'' of mutually commuting [[semisimple operator|semisimple]] [[linear transformation]]s of a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'' there exists a basis of ''V'' consisting of ''{{anchor|simultaneous eigenvector}}simultaneous [[eigenvector]]s'' of all elements of ''S''. Each of these common eigenvectors ''v'' ∈ ''V'' defines a [[linear functional]] on the subalgebra ''U'' of End(''V'') generated by the set of endomorphisms ''S''; this functional is defined as the map which associates to each element of ''U'' its eigenvalue on the eigenvector ''v''. This map is also multiplicative, and sends the identity to 1; thus it is an algebra homomorphism from ''U'' to the base field. This \"generalized eigenvalue\" is a prototype for the notion of a weight.\n\nThe notion is closely related to the idea of a [[multiplicative character]] in [[group theory]], which is a homomorphism ''χ'' from a [[group (mathematics)|group]] ''G'' to the [[multiplicative group]] of a [[field (mathematics)|field]] '''F'''. Thus ''χ'': ''G'' → '''F'''<sup>&times;</sup> satisfies ''χ''(''e'') = 1 (where ''e'' is the [[identity element]] of ''G'') and\n:<math> \\chi(gh) = \\chi(g)\\chi(h)</math> for all ''g'', ''h'' in ''G''.\nIndeed, if ''G'' [[group representation|acts]] on a vector space ''V'' over '''F''', each simultaneous eigenspace for every element of ''G'', if such exists, determines a multiplicative character on ''G'': the eigenvalue on this common eigenspace of each element of the group.\n\nThe notion of multiplicative character can be extended to any [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' over '''F''', by replacing ''χ'': ''G'' → '''F'''<sup>&times;</sup> by a [[linear map]] ''χ'': ''A'' → '''F''' with:\n:<math> \\chi(ab) = \\chi(a)\\chi(b)</math> \nfor all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A''. If an algebra ''A'' [[algebra representation|acts]] on a vector space ''V'' over '''F''' to any simultaneous eigenspace, this corresponds an [[algebra homomorphism]] from ''A'' to '''F''' assigning to each element of ''A'' its eigenvalue.\n\nIf ''A'' is a [[Lie algebra]] (which is generally not an associative algebra), then instead of requiring multiplicativity of a character, one requires that it maps any Lie bracket to the corresponding [[commutator]]; but since '''F''' is commutative this simply means that this map must vanish on Lie brackets: ''χ''([a,b])=0. A '''weight''' on a Lie algebra '''g''' over a field '''F''' is a linear map λ: '''g''' → '''F''' with λ([''x'', ''y''])=0 for all ''x'', ''y'' in '''g'''. Any weight on a Lie algebra '''g''' vanishes on the [[derived algebra]] ['''g''','''g'''] and hence descends to a weight on the [[abelian Lie algebra]] '''g'''/['''g''','''g''']. Thus weights are primarily of interest for abelian Lie algebras, where they reduce to the simple notion of a generalized eigenvalue for space of commuting linear transformations.\n\nIf ''G'' is a [[Lie group]] or an [[algebraic group]], then a multiplicative character θ: ''G'' → '''F'''<sup>×</sup> induces a weight ''χ'' = dθ: '''g''' → '''F''' on its Lie algebra by differentiation. (For Lie groups, this is differentiation at the identity element of ''G'', and the algebraic group case is an abstraction using the notion of a derivation.)\n\n==Weights in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras==\n{{see also|Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras}}\nLet <math>\\mathfrak g</math> be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and <math>\\mathfrak h</math> a Cartan subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. In this section, we describe the concepts needed to formulate the \"theorem of the highest weight\" classifying the finite-dimensional representations of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Notably, we will explain the notion of a \"dominant integral element.\" The representations themselves are described in the article linked to above.  \n===Weight of a representation===\n[[File:A2example.pdf|thumb|Example of the weights of a representation of the Lie algebra sl(3,C)]]\nLet ''V'' be a representation of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> over '''C''' and let λ a linear functional on <math>\\mathfrak h</math>. Then the '''weight space''' of ''V'' with weight λ is the subspace <math>V_\\lambda</math> given by\n:<math>V_\\lambda:=\\{v\\in V: \\forall H\\in \\mathfrak{h},\\quad  H\\cdot v=\\lambda(H)v\\}</math>.\nA '''weight of the representation''' ''V'' is a linear functional λ such that the corresponding weight space is nonzero. Nonzero elements of the weight space are called '''weight vectors'''. That is to say, a weight vector is a simultaneous eigenvector for the action of the elements of <math>\\mathfrak h</math>, with the corresponding eigenvalues given by λ.\n\nIf ''V'' is the direct sum of its weight spaces\n:<math>V=\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak{h}^*} V_\\lambda</math>\nthen it is called a ''{{visible anchor|weight module}};'' this corresponds to there being a common [[eigenbasis]] (a basis of simultaneous eigenvectors) for all the represented elements of the algebra, i.e.,  to their being simultaneously diagonalizable matrices (see [[diagonalizable matrix]]).\n\nIf ''G'' is group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, every finite-dimensional representation of ''G'' induces a representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. A weight of the representation of ''G'' is then simply a weight of the associated representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. There is a subtle distinction between weights of group representations and Lie algebra representations, which is that there is a different notion of integrality condition in the two cases; see below. (The integrality condition is more restrictive in the group case, reflecting that not every representation of the Lie algebra comes from a representation of the group.)\n\n===Action of the root vectors===\nIf ''V'' is the [[Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] of  <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, the nonzero weights of ''V'' are called '''[[root system|roots]]''', the weight spaces are called root spaces, and weight vectors are called root vectors. Explicitly, a linear functional <math>\\alpha</math> on <math>\\mathfrak h</math> is called a root if <math>\\alpha\\neq 0</math> and there exists a nonzero <math>X</math> in <math>\\mathfrak g</math> such that\n:<math>[H,X]=\\alpha(H)X</math>\nfor all <math>H</math> in <math>\\mathfrak h</math>. The collection of roots forms a [[root system]]. \n\nFrom the perspective of representation theory, the significance of the roots and root vectors is the following elementary but important result: If ''V'' is a representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, ''v'' is a weight vector with weight <math>\\lambda</math> and ''X'' is a root vector with root <math>\\alpha</math>, then\n:<math>H\\cdot (X\\cdot v)=[(\\lambda+\\alpha)(H)](X\\cdot v)</math>\nfor all ''H'' in <math>\\mathfrak h</math>. That is, <math>X\\cdot v</math> is either the zero vector or a weight vector with weight <math>\\lambda+\\alpha</math>. Thus, the action of <math>X</math> maps the weight space with weight <math>\\lambda</math> into the weight space with weight <math>\\lambda+\\alpha</math>.\n\n===Integral element===\n[[File:Weights_for_A2_root_system.png|thumb|right|Algebraically integral elements (triangular lattice), dominant integral elements (black dots), and fundamental weights for sl(3,C)]]\nLet <math>\\mathfrak h^*_0</math> be the real subspace of <math>\\mathfrak h^*</math> generated by the roots of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. For computations, it is convenient to choose an inner product that is invariant under the Weyl group, that is, under reflections about the hyperplanes orthogonal to the roots. We may then use this inner product to identify <math>\\mathfrak h^*_0</math> with a subspace <math>\\mathfrak h_0</math> of <math>\\mathfrak h</math>. With this identification, the [[coroot]] associated to a root <math>\\alpha</math> is given as \n:<math>H_\\alpha=2\\frac{\\alpha}{\\langle\\alpha,\\alpha\\rangle}</math>.\n\nWe now define two different notions of integrality for elements of <math>\\mathfrak h_0</math>. The motivation for these definitions is simple: The weights of finite-dimensional representations of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> satisfy the first integrality condition, while if ''G'' is a group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, the weights of finite-dimensional representations of ''G'' satisfy the second integrality condition.\n\nA element <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h_0</math> is '''algebraically integral''' if\n:<math>\\langle\\lambda,H_\\alpha\\rangle=2\\frac{\\langle\\lambda,\\alpha\\rangle}{\\langle\\alpha,\\alpha\\rangle}\\in\\mathbf{Z}</math>\nfor all roots <math>\\alpha</math>. The motivation for this condition is that the coroot <math>H_\\alpha</math> can be identified with the ''H'' element in a standard <math>{X,Y,H}</math> basis for an sl(2,'''C''')-subalgebra of '''g'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 7.19 and Eq. (7.9)</ref> By elementary results for sl(2,'''C'''), the eigenvalues of <math>H_\\alpha</math> in any finite-dimensional representation must be an integer. We conclude that, as stated above, the weight of any finite-dimensional representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is algebraically integral.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 9.2</ref>\n\nThe '''fundamental weights''' <math>\\omega_1,\\ldots,\\omega_n</math> are defined by the property that they form a basis of <math>\\mathfrak h_0</math> dual to the set of coroots associated to the [[Root_system#Positive_roots_and_simple_roots|simple roots]]. That is, the fundamental weights are defined by the condition\n:<math>2\\frac{\\langle\\omega_i,\\alpha_j\\rangle}{\\langle\\alpha_j,\\alpha_j\\rangle}=\\delta_{i,j}</math>\nwhere  <math>\\alpha_1,\\ldots\\alpha_n</math> are the simple roots. An element <math>\\lambda</math> is then algebraically integral if and only if it is an integral combination of the fundamental weights.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.36</ref> The set of all <math>\\mathfrak g</math>-integral weights is a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] in <math>\\mathfrak h_0</math> called ''weight lattice'' for <math>\\mathfrak g</math>, denoted by <math>P(\\mathfrak g)</math>. \n\nThe figure shows the example of the Lie algebra sl(3,C), whose root system is the <math>A_2</math> root system. There are two simple roots, <math>\\gamma_1</math> and <math>\\gamma_2</math>. The first fundamental weight, <math>\\omega_1</math>, should be orthogonal to <math>\\gamma_2</math> and should project orthogonally to half of <math>\\gamma_1</math>, and similarly for <math>\\omega_2</math>. The weight lattice is then the triangular lattice.\n\nSuppose now that the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is the Lie algebra of a Lie group ''G''. Then we say that <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h_0</math> is '''analytically integral''' (''G-integral'') if for each ''t'' in <math>\\mathfrak h</math> such that <math>\\exp(t)=1\\in G</math> we have <math>\\langle\\lambda,t\\rangle\\in 2\\pi i \\mathbf{Z}</math>. The reason for making this definition is that if a representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> arises from a representation of ''G'', then the weights of the representation will be ''G''-integral.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 12.5</ref> For ''G'' semisimple, the set of all ''G''-integral weights is a sublattice ''P''(''G'') ⊂ ''P''(<math>\\mathfrak g</math>). If ''G'' is [[simply connected]], then ''P''(''G'') = ''P''(<math>\\mathfrak g</math>). If ''G'' is not simply connected, then the lattice ''P''(''G'') is smaller than ''P''(<math>\\mathfrak g</math>) and their [[quotient (group theory)|quotient]] is isomorphic to the [[fundamental group]] of ''G''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Corollary 13.8 and Corollary 13.20</ref>\n\n===Partial ordering on the space of weights===\n[[File:Illustration_of_notion_of_\"higher\"_for_root_systems.png|thumb|right|If the positive roots are <math>\\alpha_1</math>, <math>\\alpha_2</math>, and <math>\\alpha_3</math>, the shaded region is the set of points higher than <math>\\lambda</math>]]\nWe now introduce a partial ordering on the set of weights, which will be used to formulate the theorem of the highest weight describing the representations of '''g'''. Recall that ''R'' is the set of roots; we now fix a set <math>R^+</math> of [[Root_system#Positive_roots_and_simple_roots|positive roots]].\n\nConsider two elements <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\lambda</math> of  <math>\\mathfrak h_0</math>. We are mainly interested in the case where <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\lambda</math> are integral, but this assumption is not necessary to the definition we are about to introduce. We then say that <math>\\mu</math> is '''higher''' than <math>\\lambda</math>, which we write as <math>\\mu\\succeq\\lambda</math>, if <math>\\mu-\\lambda</math> is expressible as a linear combination of positive roots with non-negative real coefficients.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Definition 8.39</ref> This means, roughly, that \"higher\" means in the directions of the positive roots. We equivalently say that <math>\\lambda</math> is \"lower\" than <math>\\mu</math>, which we write as <math>\\lambda\\preceq\\mu</math>.\n\nIt should be emphasized that <math>\\preceq</math> is only a ''partial'' ordering; it can easily happen that <math>\\mu</math> is neither higher nor lower than <math>\\lambda</math>.\n\n===Dominant weight===\nAn integral element λ is ''dominant'' if <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\gamma\\rangle\\geq 0</math> for each positive root ''γ''. Equivalently, λ is dominant if it is a ''non-negative'' integer combination of the fundamental weights. In the <math>A_2</math> case, the dominant integral elements live in a 60-degree sector. The notion of being dominant is not the same as being higher than zero. \n\nThe set of all λ (not necessarily integral) such that <math>\\langle\\lambda,\\gamma\\rangle\\geq 0</math> is known as the ''fundamental Weyl chamber'' associated to the given set of positive roots.\n\n===Theorem of the highest weight===\n{{main|Theorem on the highest weights}}\nA weight <math>\\lambda</math> of a representation <math>V</math> of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is called a '''highest weight''' if every other weight of <math>V</math> is lower than <math>\\lambda</math>. \n\nThe theory [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|classifying the finite-dimensional irreducible representations]] of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is by means of a \"theorem of the highest weight.\" The theorem says that<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorems 9.4 and 9.5</ref>\n:(1) every irreducible (finite-dimensional) representation has a highest weight, \n:(2) the highest weight is always a dominant, algebraically integral element, \n:(3) two irreducible representations with the same highest weight are isomorphic, and \n:(4) every dominant, algebraically integral element is the highest weight of an irreducible representation. \nThe last point is the most difficult one; the representations may be constructed using [[Verma module]]s.\n\n===Highest-weight module===\nA representation (not necessarily finite dimensional) ''V'' of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is called ''highest-weight module'' if it is generated by a weight vector ''v'' ∈ ''V'' that is annihilated by the action of all [[positive root]] spaces in <math>\\mathfrak g</math>. Every irreducible <math>\\mathfrak g</math>-module with a highest weight is necessarily a highest-weight module, but in the infinite-dimensional case, a highest weight module need not be irreducible. \nFor each <math>\\lambda\\in\\mathfrak h^*</math>—not necessarily dominant or integral—there exists a unique (up to isomorphism) [[irreducible (representation theory)|simple]] highest-weight <math>\\mathfrak g</math>-module with highest weight λ, which is denoted ''L''(λ), but this module is infinite dimensional unless λ is dominant integral. It can be shown that each highest weight module with highest weight λ is a [[quotient module|quotient]] of the [[Verma module]] ''M''(λ). This is just a restatement of ''universality property'' in the definition of a Verma module.\n\nEvery ''finite-dimensional'' highest weight module is irreducible.<ref>This follows from (the proof of) Proposition 6.13 in {{harvnb|Hall|2015}} together with the general result on complete reducibility of finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras </ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras|Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras]]\n*[[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|Representation theory of a connected compact Lie group]]\n*[[Highest-weight category]]\n*[[Root system]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{ref begin}}\n\n* {{Fulton-Harris}}.\n* {{citation|last2=Wallach|first2=Nolan R.|last1=Goodman|first1=Roe|year=1998|title=Representations and Invariants of the Classical Groups|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-66348-9}}.\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Horn | first1=Roger A. | last2=Johnson | first2=Charles R. | title=Matrix Analysis | publisher= Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-38632-6 | year=1985}}<!-- reference for simultaneous diagonalizable -->\n* {{citation | title =Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory|first=James E.|last=Humphreys|publisher=Birkhäuser|year= 1972a|isbn=978-0-387-90053-7}}.\n* {{citation | last1=Humphreys | first1=James E. | title=Linear Algebraic Groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-90108-4 |mr=0396773 | year=1972b | volume=21}}\n* {{citation|title=Lie Groups Beyond an Introduction|first=Anthony W.|last= Knapp|edition=2nd|publisher=Birkhäuser|year= 2002| isbn=978-0-8176-4259-4}}.\n<!--* {{citation|last1=Roggenkamp|first1= K.|last2= Stefanescu|first2= M.|title= Algebra &ndash; Representation Theory|publisher= Springer|year= 2002|isbn=978-0-7923-7113-7}}.--><!--Not sure what this is useful for: it is the proceedings of a conference-->\n\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie algebras]]\n[[Category:Representation theory of Lie groups]]"

Specifically, it is the subgroup which is generated by reflections through the [[hyperplane]]s [[orthogonal]] to the roots, and as such is a [[finite reflection group]]. Abstractly, Weyl groups are [[finite Coxeter group]]s, and are important examples of these.\n\nThe Weyl group of a [[Semisimple Lie group|semisimple]] [[Lie group]], a semisimple [[Lie algebra]], a semisimple [[linear algebraic group]], etc. is the Weyl group of the [[Root system of a semi-simple Lie algebra|root system of that group or algebra]].\n\nIt is named after [[Hermann Weyl]].\n\n==Definition and examples==\n[[File:A2_Weyl_group_(revised).png|thumb|right|The Weyl group of the <math>A_2</math> root system is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle]]\nLet <math>\\Phi</math> be a [[root system]] in a Euclidean space <math>V</math>. For each root <math>\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math>, let <math>s_\\alpha</math> denote the reflection about the hyperplane perpendicular to <math>\\alpha</math>, which is given explicitly as\n:<math>s_\\alpha(v)=v-2\\frac{(\\alpha,v)}{(\\alpha,\\alpha)}\\alpha</math>,\nwhere <math>(\\cdot,\\cdot)</math> is the inner product on <math>V</math>. The Weyl group <math>W</math> of <math>\\Phi</math> is the subgroup of the orthogonal group <math>O(V)</math> generated by all the <math>s_\\alpha</math>'s. By the definition of a root system, each <math>s_\\alpha</math> preserves <math>\\Phi</math>, from which it follows that <math>W</math> is a finite group.\n\nIn the case of the <math>A_2</math> root system, for example, the hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots are just lines, and the Weyl group is the symmetry group of an equilateral triangle, as indicated in the figure. As a group, <math>W</math> is isomorphic to the permutation group on three elements, which we may think of as the vertices of the triangle. Note that in this case, <math>W</math> is not the full symmetry group of the root system; a 60-degree rotation preserves <math>\\Phi</math> but is not an element of <math>W</math>.\n\nWe may consider also the <math>A_n</math> root system. In this case, <math>V</math> is the space of all vectors in <math>\\mathbb R^{n+1}</math> whose entries sum to zero. The roots consist of the vectors of the form <math>e_i-e_j,\\,i\\neq j</math>, where <math>e_i</math> is the <math>i</math>th standard basis element for <math>\\mathbb R^{n+1}</math>. The reflection associated to such a root is the transformation of <math>V</math> obtained by interchanging the <math>i</math>th and <math>j</math>th entries of each vector. The Weyl group for <math>A_n</math> is then the permutation group on <math>n+1</math> elements.\n\n==Weyl chambers==\n{{see also|Coxeter group#Affine Coxeter groups}}\n[[File:Weyl_chambers_for_A2.png|thumb|right|The shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber for the base <math>\\{\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2\\}</math>]]\n\nIf <math>\\Phi\\subset V</math> is a root system, we may consider the hyperplane perpendicular to each root <math>\\alpha</math>. Recall that <math>\\sigma_\\alpha</math> denotes the reflection about the hyperplane and that the Weyl group is the group of transformations of <math>V</math> generated by all the <math>\\sigma_\\alpha</math>'s. The complement of the set of hyperplanes is disconnected, and each connected component is called a '''Weyl chamber'''. If we have fixed a particular set Δ of simple roots, we may define the '''fundamental Weyl chamber''' associated to Δ as the set of points <math>v\\in V</math> such that <math>(\\alpha,v)>0</math> for all <math>\\alpha\\in\\Delta</math>. \n\nSince the reflections <math>\\sigma_\\alpha,\\,\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math> preserve <math>\\Phi</math>, they also preserve the set of hyperplanes perpendicular to the roots. Thus, each Weyl group element permutes the Weyl chambers.\n\nThe figure illustrates the case of the A2 root system. The \"hyperplanes\" (in this case, one dimensional) orthogonal to the roots are indicated by dashed lines. The six 60-degree sectors are the Weyl chambers and the shaded region is the fundamental Weyl chamber associated to the indicated base.\n\nA basic general theorem about Weyl chambers is this:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Propositions 8.23 and 8.27</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': The Weyl group acts freely and transitively on the Weyl chambers. Thus, the order of the Weyl group is equal to the number of Weyl chambers.\nA related result is this one:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 8.29</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': Fix a Weyl chamber <math>C</math>. Then for all <math>v\\in V</math>, the Weyl-orbit of <math>v</math> contains exactly one point in the closure <math>\\bar C</math> of <math>C</math>.\n\n==Coxeter group structure==\n===Generating set===\nA key result about the Weyl group is this:<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Propositions 8.24</ref>\n:'''Theorem''': If <math>\\Delta</math> is base for <math>\\Phi</math>, then the Weyl group is generated by the reflections <math>s_\\alpha</math> with <math>\\alpha</math> in <math>\\Delta</math>.\nThat is to say, the group generated by the reflections <math>s_\\alpha,\\,\\alpha\\in\\Delta,</math> is the same as the group generated by the reflections <math>s_\\alpha,\\,\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math>.\n\n===Relations===\nMeanwhile, if <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> are in <math>\\Delta</math>, then the [[Dynkin diagram]] for <math>\\Phi</math> relative to the base <math>\\Delta</math> tells us something about how the pair <math>\\{s_\\alpha,s_\\beta\\}</math> behaves. Specifically, suppose <math>v</math> and <math>v'</math> are the corresponding vertices in the Dynkin diagram. Then we have the following results:\n*If there is no bond between <math>v</math> and <math>v'</math>, then <math>s_\\alpha</math> and <math>s_\\beta</math> commute. Since <math>s_\\alpha</math> and <math>s_\\beta</math> each have order two, this is equivalent to saying that <math>(s_\\alpha s_\\beta)^2=1</math>.\n*If there is one bond between <math>v</math> and <math>v'</math>, then <math>(s_\\alpha s_\\beta)^3=1</math>.\n*If there are two bonds between <math>v</math> and <math>v'</math>, then <math>(s_\\alpha s_\\beta)^4=1</math>.\n*If there are three bonds between <math>v</math> and <math>v'</math>, then <math>(s_\\alpha s_\\beta)^6=1</math>.\nThe preceding claim is not hard to verify, if we simply remember what the Dynkin diagram tells us about the angle between each pair of roots. If, for example, there is no bond between the two vertices, then <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> are orthogonal, from which it follows easily that the corresponding reflections commute. More generally, the number of bonds determines the angle <math>\\theta</math> between the roots. The product of the two reflections is then a rotation by angle <math>2\\theta</math> in the plane spanned by <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, as the reader may verify, from which the above claim follows easily.\n\n===As a Coxeter group===\nWeyl groups are examples of finite reflection groups, as they are generated by reflections; the abstract groups (not considered as subgroups of a linear group) are accordingly [[finite Coxeter group]]s, which allows them to be classified by their [[Coxeter–Dynkin diagram]]. Being a Coxeter group means that a Weyl group has a special kind of [[presentation of a group|presentation]] in which each generator ''x<sub>i</sub>'' is of order two, and the relations other than ''x<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>'' are of the form (''x''<sub>''i''</sub>''x''<sub>''j''</sub>)<sup>''m''<sub>''ij''</sub></sup>.  The generators are the reflections given by simple roots, and ''m<sub>ij</sub>'' is 2, 3, 4, or 6 depending on whether roots ''i'' and ''j'' make an angle of 90, 120, 135, or 150 degrees, i.e., whether in the [[Dynkin diagram]] they are unconnected, connected by a simple edge, connected by a double edge, or connected by a triple edge. We have already noted these relations in the bullet points above, but to say that <math>W</math> is a Coxeter group, we are saying that those are the ''only'' relations in <math>W</math>.\n\nWeyl groups have a [[Bruhat order]] and [[length function]] in terms of this presentation: the ''[[Length of a Weyl group element|length]]'' of a Weyl group element is the length of the shortest word representing that element in terms of these standard generators. There is a unique [[longest element of a Coxeter group]], which is opposite to the identity in the Bruhat order.\n\n==Weyl groups in algebraic, group-theoretic, and geometric settings==\nAbove, the Weyl group was defined as a subgroup of the isometry group of a root system.  There are also various definitions of Weyl groups specific to various group-theoretic and geometric contexts  ([[Lie algebra]], [[Lie group]], [[symmetric space]], etc.).  For each of these ways of defining Weyl groups, it is a (usually nontrivial) theorem that it is a Weyl group in the sense of the definition at the top of this article, namely the Weyl group of some root system associated with the object.   A concrete realization of such a Weyl group usually depends on a choice – e.g. of [[Cartan subalgebra]] for a Lie algebra, of [[maximal torus]] for a Lie group.<ref name=\"springer\">{{Harvnb|Popov|Fedenko|2001}}</ref>\n\n===The Weyl group of a connected compact Lie group===\nLet <math>K</math> be a connected compact Lie group and let <math>T</math> be a [[maximal torus]] in <math>K</math>. We then introduce the '''normalizer''' of <math>T</math> in <math>K</math>, denoted <math>N(T)</math> and defined as\n:<math>N(T)=\\{x\\in K|xtx^{-1}\\in T,\\,\\text{for all }t\\in T\\}</math>.\nWe also define the '''centralizer''' of <math>T</math> in <math>K</math>, denoted <math>Z(T)</math> and defined as\n:<math>Z(T)=\\{x\\in K|xtx^{-1}=t\\,\\text{for all }t\\in T\\}</math>.\nThe Weyl group <math>W</math> of <math>K</math> (relative to the given maximal torus <math>T</math>) is then defined initially as\n:<math>W=N(T)/T</math>.\nEventually, one proves that <math>Z(T)=T</math>,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.36</ref> at which point one has an alternative description of the Weyl group as\n:<math>W=N(T)/Z(T)</math>.\n\nNow, one can define a root system <math>\\Phi</math> associated to the pair <math>(K,T)</math>; the roots are the nonzero [[Weight (representation theory)|weights]] of the adjoint action of <math>T</math> on the Lie algebra of <math>K</math>. For each <math>\\alpha\\in\\Phi</math>, one can construct an element <math>x_\\alpha</math> of <math>N(T)</math> whose action on <math>T</math> has the form of reflection.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Propositions 11.35</ref> With a bit more effort, one can show that these reflections generate all of <math>N(T)/Z(T)</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 11.36</ref> Thus, in the end, the Weyl group as defined as <math>N(T)/T</math> or <math>N(T)/Z(T)</math> is isomorphic to the Weyl group of the root system <math>\\Phi</math>.\n\n===In other settings===\n\nFor a complex semisimple Lie algebra, the Weyl group is simply ''defined'' as the reflection group generated by reflections in the roots – the specific realization of the root system depending on a choice of [[Semisimple_Lie_algebra#Cartan_subalgebras_and_root_systems|Cartan subalgebra]].\n\nFor a [[Lie group]] ''G'' satisfying certain conditions,<ref group=\"note\">Different conditions are sufficient – most simply if ''G'' is connected and either compact, or an affine algebraic group. The definition is simpler for a semisimple (or more generally reductive) Lie group over an [[algebraically closed field]], but a ''relative'' Weyl group can be defined for a [[split Lie group|''split'' Lie group]].</ref> given a torus ''T'' < ''G'' (which need not be maximal), the Weyl group ''with respect to'' that torus is defined as the quotient of the [[normalizer]] of the torus ''N'' = ''N''(''T'') = ''N<sub>G</sub>''(''T'') by the [[centralizer]] of the torus ''Z'' = ''Z''(''T'') = ''Z<sub>G</sub>''(''T''),\n\n:<math>W(T,G) := N(T)/Z(T).\\ </math>\n\nThe group ''W'' is finite – ''Z'' is of finite [[Index of a subgroup|index]] in ''N''. If ''T'' = ''T''<sub>0</sub> is a [[maximal torus]] (so it equals its own centralizer: <math>Z(T_0) = T_0</math>) then the resulting quotient ''N''/''Z'' = ''N''/''T'' is called ''the'' [[Maximal_torus#Weyl_group|Weyl group]] of ''G'', and denoted ''W''(''G''). Note that the specific quotient set depends on a choice of maximal [[torus]], but the resulting groups are all isomorphic (by an inner automorphism of ''G''), since maximal tori are conjugate.\n\nIf ''G'' is compact and connected, and ''T'' is a ''maximal'' torus, then the Weyl group of ''G'' is isomorphic to the Weyl group of its Lie algebra, as discussed above.\n\nFor example, for the general linear group ''GL,'' a maximal torus is the subgroup ''D'' of invertible diagonal matrices, whose normalizer is the [[generalized permutation matrices]] (matrices in the form of [[permutation matrices]], but with any non-zero numbers in place of the '1's), and whose Weyl group is the [[symmetric group]]. In this case the quotient map ''N'' → ''N''/''T'' splits (via the permutation matrices), so the normalizer ''N'' is a [[semidirect product]] of the torus and the Weyl group, and the Weyl group can be expressed as a subgroup of ''G''. In general this is not always the case – the quotient does not always split, the normalizer ''N'' is not always the [[semidirect product]] of ''W'' and ''Z,'' and the Weyl group cannot always be realized as a subgroup of ''G.''<ref name=\"springer\"/>\n\n==Bruhat decomposition==\n{{Further|Bruhat decomposition}}\n\nIf ''B'' is a [[Borel subgroup]] of ''G'', i.e., a maximal [[connected space|connected]] [[solvable group|solvable]] subgroup and a maximal torus ''T'' = ''T''<sub>0</sub> is chosen to lie in ''B'', then we obtain the [[Bruhat decomposition]]\n\n:<math>G = \\bigcup_{w\\in W} BwB</math>\n\nwhich gives rise to the decomposition of the [[flag variety]] ''G''/''B'' into '''Schubert cells''' (see [[Grassmannian]]).\n\nThe structure of the [[Hasse diagram]] of the group is related geometrically to the cohomology of the manifold (rather, of the real and complex forms of the group), which is constrained by [[Poincaré duality]]. Thus algebraic properties of the Weyl group correspond to general topological properties of manifolds. For instance, Poincaré duality gives a pairing between cells in dimension ''k'' and in dimension ''n'' - ''k'' (where ''n'' is the dimension of a manifold): the bottom (0) dimensional cell corresponds to the identity element of the Weyl group, and the dual top-dimensional cell corresponds to the [[longest element of a Coxeter group]].\n\n==Analogy with algebraic groups==\n{{Main|q-analog}}\n{{See also|Field with one element}}\nThere are a number of analogies between [[algebraic group]]s and Weyl groups – for instance, the number of elements of the symmetric group is ''n''!, and the number of elements of the general linear group over a finite field is related to the [[q-factorial|''q''-factorial]] <math>[n]_q!</math>; thus the symmetric group behaves as though it were a linear group over \"the field with one element\". This is formalized by the [[field with one element]], which considers Weyl groups to be simple algebraic groups over the field with one element.\n\n==Cohomology==\nFor a non-abelian connected compact Lie group ''G,'' the first [[group cohomology]] of the Weyl group ''W'' with coefficients in the maximal torus ''T'' used to define it,<ref group=\"note\">''W'' acts on ''T'' – that is how it is defined – and the group <math>H^1(W; T)</math> means \"with respect to this action\".</ref> is related to the [[outer automorphism group]] of the normalizer <math>N = N_G(T),</math> as:<ref name=\"hms\">{{Harvnb|Hämmerli|Matthey|Suter|2004}}</ref>\n:<math>\\operatorname{Out}(N) \\cong H^1(W; T) \\rtimes \\operatorname{Out}(G).</math>\nThe outer automorphisms of the group Out(''G'') are essentially the diagram automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]], while the group cohomology is computed in {{Harvnb|Hämmerli|Matthey|Suter|2004}} and is a finite elementary abelian 2-group (<math>(\\mathbf{Z}/2)^k</math>); for simple Lie groups it has order 1, 2, or 4.

      "text": "In algebra, '''Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility''' is a fundamental result in the theory of [[Lie algebra representation]]s. Let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero. The theorem states that every finite-dimensional module over <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is semisimple as a module (i.e., a direct sum of simple modules.)<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 10.9</ref>\n\nWeyl's original proof (for complex semisimple Lie algebras) was analytic in nature: it famously used the [[unitarian trick]]. Specifically, one can show that every complex semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is the complexification of the Lie algebra of a simply connected compact Lie group <math>K</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2002}} Theorem 6.11</ref> (If, for example, <math>\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathrm{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})</math>, then <math>K=\\mathrm{SU}(n)</math>.) Given a representation <math>\\pi</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> on a vector space <math>V,</math> we can first restrict <math>\\pi</math> to the Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> of <math>K</math>. Then, [[Lie_group–Lie_algebra_correspondence#The_correspondence|since <math>K</math> is simply connected]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 5.10</ref> there is an associated representation <math>\\Pi</math> of <math>K</math>. We can then use integration over <math>K</math> to produce an inner product on <math>V</math> for which <math>\\Pi</math> is unitary.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 4.28</ref> Complete reducibility of <math>\\Pi</math> is then immediate and elementary arguments show that the original representation <math>\\pi</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is also completely reducible.\n\nThe usual algebraic proof makes use of the [[Casimir_element#Quadratic_Casimir_element|quadratic Casimir element]] of the [[universal enveloping algebra]],<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 10.3</ref> and can be seen as a consequence of [[Whitehead's lemma (Lie algebras)|Whitehead's lemma]] (see Weibel's [[homological algebra]] book).\n\nWe now explain briefly the role that the quadratic Casimir element <math>C</math> has in the proof. Since <math>C</math> is in the center of the universal enveloping algebra, [[Schur's lemma]] tells us that <math>C</math> acts as multiple <math>c_\\lambda</math> of the identity in the irreducible representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> with highest weight <math>\\lambda</math>. A key point is to establish that <math>c_\\lambda</math> is ''nonzero'' whenever the representation is nontrivial. This can be done by a general argument <ref>{{harvnb|Humphreys|1973}} Section 6.2</ref> or by the [[Casimir_element#Eigenvalues|explicit formula]] for <math>c_\\lambda</math>. We now consider a very special case of the theorem on complete reducibility: the case where a representation <math>V</math> contains a nontrivial, irreducible, invariant subspace <math>W</math> of codimension one. Let <math>C_V</math> denote the action of <math>C</math> on <math>V</math>. Since <math>V</math> is not irreducible, <math>C_V</math> is not necessarily a multiple of the identity, but it is a self-intertwining operator for <math>V</math>. Then the restriction of <math>C_V</math> to <math>W</math> is a nonzero multiple of the identity. But since the quotient <math>V/W</math> is a one dimensional—and therefore trivial—representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the action of <math>C</math> on the quotient is trivial. It then easily follows that <math>C_V</math> must have a nonzero kernel—and the kernel is an invariant subspace, since <math>C_V</math> is a self-intertwiner. The kernel is then a one-dimensional invariant subspace, whose intersection with <math>W</math> is zero. Thus, <math>\\mathrm{ker}(V_C)</math> is an invariant complement to <math>W</math>, so that <math>V</math> decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible subspaces:\n:<math>V=W\\oplus\\mathrm{ker}(C_V)</math>.\n\nAlthough we have so far established only a very special case of the desired result, this step is actually the critical one in the general argument.\n\n== External links ==\n* A [http://amathew.wordpress.com/2010/01/31/weyls-theorem-on-complete-reducibility/ blog post] by Akhil Mathew\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |last=Hall |first=Brian C. |title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition = 2nd|series= Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222 |year=2015 |publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n* {{cite book | last=Humphreys | first=James E. | authorlink=James E.

Historically, they are regarded as leading to the discovery of Lie algebra cohomology.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|loc=p.93}}</ref>\n\nOne usually makes the distinction between '''Whitehead's first and second lemma''' for the corresponding statements about first and second order cohomology, respectively, but there are similar statements pertaining to Lie algebra cohomology in arbitrary orders which are also attributed to Whitehead. \n\nThe first Whitehead lemma is an important step toward the proof of [[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]].\n\n==Statements==\nWithout mentioning cohomology groups, one can state Whitehead's first lemma as follows: Let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a finite-dimensional, semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, ''V'' a finite-dimensional [[Lie_algebra_representation#Formal_definition|module]] over it, and <math>f\\colon \\mathfrak{g} \\to V</math> a linear map such that \n:<math>f([x, y]) = xf(y) - yf(x)</math>. \nThen there exists a vector <math>v \\in V</math> such that <math>f(x) = xv</math> for all <math>x \\in \\mathfrak{g}</math>.\nIn terms of [[Lie algebra cohomology]], this is, by definition, equivalent to the fact that <math>H^1(\\mathfrak{g},V) = 0</math> for every such representation.  The proof uses a [[Casimir element]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobson|loc=p.77, p.95}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, Whitehead's second lemma states that under the conditions of the first lemma, also <math>H^2(\\mathfrak{g},V) = 0</math>.\n\nAnother related statement, which is also attributed to Whitehead, describes Lie algebra cohomology in arbitrary order: Given the same conditions as in the previous two statements, but further let <math>V</math> be  [[Lie_algebra_representation#Invariant_subspaces_and_irreducibility|irreducible]] under the <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>-action and let <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> act nontrivially, so <math>\\mathfrak{g} \\cdot V \\neq 0</math>.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''free Lie algebra''', over a given [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', is a [[Lie algebra]] generated by a set ''X'', without any imposed relations other than the defining relations of alternating bilinearity and the [[Jacobi identity]].\n\n==Definition==\n[[Image:Free lie.png|right|thumb|100px]]\n: Let ''X'' be a set and ''i'': ''X'' &rarr; ''L'' a morphism of sets from ''X'' into a Lie algebra ''L''.  The Lie algebra ''L'' is called '''free on ''X''''' if for any Lie algebra ''A'' with a morphism of sets ''f'': ''X'' &rarr; ''A'', there is a unique Lie algebra morphism ''g'': ''L'' &rarr; ''A'' such that ''f'' = ''g'' o ''i''.\nGiven a set ''X'', one can show that there exists a unique free Lie algebra ''L(X)'' generated by ''X''.\n\nIn the language of category theory, the [[functor]] sending a set ''X'' to the Lie algebra generated by ''X'' is the [[Free object#Free functor|free functor]] from the category of sets to the category of Lie algebras. That is, it is [[left adjoint]] to the [[forgetful functor]].\n\nThe free Lie algebra on a set ''X'' is naturally graded. The 0-graded component of the free Lie algebra is just the free vector space on that set.\n\nOne can alternatively define a free Lie algebra on a vector space ''V'' as left adjoint to the forgetful functor from Lie algebras over a field ''K'' to vector spaces over the field ''K'' – forgetting the Lie algebra structure, but remembering the vector space structure.\n\n==Universal enveloping algebra==\n\nThe [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a free Lie algebra on a set ''X'' is the [[free associative algebra]] generated by ''X''. By the [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] it is the \"same size\" as the symmetric algebra of the free Lie algebra (meaning that if both sides are graded by giving elements of ''X'' degree 1 then they are isomorphic as graded vector spaces). This can be used to describe the dimension of the piece of the free Lie algebra of any given degree.\n\nWitt showed that the number of basic commutators of degree ''k'' in the free Lie algebra on an ''m''-element set is given by the [[necklace polynomial]]:\n:<math>M_m(k) \\,=\\, \\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{d|k}\\mu(d)\\cdot m^{k/d},</math>\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[Möbius function]].\n\nThe graded dual of the universal enveloping algebra of a free Lie algebra on a finite set is the [[shuffle algebra]].\n\n==Hall sets==\n\nAn explicit basis of the free Lie algebra can be given in terms of a '''Hall set''', which is a particular kind of subset inside the [[free magma]] on ''X''. Elements of the free magma are [[binary tree]]s, with their leaves labelled by elements of ''X''. Hall sets were introduced by {{harvs|txt||first=Marshall |last=Hall|authorlink=Marshall Hall (mathematician)|year=1950}} based on work of  [[Philip Hall]] on groups. Subsequently, [[Wilhelm Magnus]] showed that they arise as the [[graded Lie algebra]] associated with the filtration on a [[free group]] given by the [[lower central series]]. This correspondence was motivated by [[commutator]] identities in [[group theory]] due to Philip  Hall and [[Ernst Witt]].\n\n==Lyndon basis==\n\nIn particular there is a basis of the free Lie algebra corresponding to [[Lyndon word]]s, called the '''Lyndon basis'''. (This is also called the Chen–Fox–Lyndon basis or the Lyndon–Shirshov basis, and  is essentially the same as the '''Shirshov basis'''.)\nThere is a bijection γ from the Lyndon words in an ordered alphabet to a basis of the free Lie algebra on this alphabet defined as follows. \n*If a word ''w'' has length 1 then γ(''w'') = ''w'' (considered as a generator of the free Lie algebra).\n*If ''w'' has length at least 2, then write ''w'' = ''uv'' for Lyndon words ''u'', ''v'' with ''v'' as long as possible (the \"standard factorization\"<ref>{{citation | last1 = Berstel | first1 = Jean | last2 = Perrin | first2 = Dominique | doi = 10.1016/j.ejc.2005.07.019 | mr = 2300777 | issue = 3 | journal = [[European Journal of Combinatorics]] | pages = 996–1022 | title = The origins of combinatorics on words | url = http://www-igm.univ-mlv.fr/~berstel/Articles/2007Origins.pdf | volume = 28 | year = 2007}}</ref>).

      "text": "{{Short description|Direct sum of simple Lie algebras}}{{Lie groups}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a [[Lie algebra]] is '''semisimple''' if it is a [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of [[simple Lie algebra]]s, i.e., non-abelian Lie algebras <math>\\mathfrak g</math> whose only [[Lie_algebra#Subalgebras.2C_ideals_and_homomorphisms|ideals]] are {0} and <math>\\mathfrak g</math> itself. It is important to emphasize that a one-dimensional Lie algebra (which is necessarily abelian) is by definition not considered a simple Lie algebra, even though such an algebra certainly has no nontrivial ideals. Thus, one-dimensional algebras are not allowed as summands in a semisimple Lie algebra.\n\nThroughout the article, unless otherwise stated, <math>\\mathfrak g</math>  is a non-zero finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. The following conditions are equivalent:\n*<math>\\mathfrak g</math> is semisimple\n*the [[Killing form]], κ(x,y) = tr(ad(''x'')ad(''y'')),  is [[non-degenerate]],\n*<math>\\mathfrak g</math> has no non-zero abelian ideals,\n*<math>\\mathfrak g</math> has no non-zero [[solvable Lie algebra|solvable]] ideals,\n* The [[Radical of a Lie algebra|radical]] (maximal solvable ideal) of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is zero.\n\n== Examples ==\nAs explained in greater detail below, semisimple [[Lie algebra]]s over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> are classified by the root system associated to their Cartan subalgebras, and the root systems, in turn, are classified by their Dynkin diagrams.\nExamples of semisimple Lie algebras, with notation coming from their [[Dynkin diagram]]s, are:\n* <math>A_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak {sl}_{n+1}</math>, the [[special linear Lie algebra]].\n* <math>B_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1}</math>, the odd-dimensional [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]].\n* <math>C_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak {sp}_{2n}</math>, the [[symplectic Lie algebra]].\n* <math>D_n:</math> <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2n}</math>, the even-dimensional [[special orthogonal Lie algebra]] (<math>n>1</math>).\nThe restriction <math>n>1</math> in the <math>D_n</math> family is needed because <math>\\mathfrak{so}_{2}</math> is one-dimensional and commutative and therefore not semisimple.\n\nThese Lie algebras are numbered so that ''n'' is the [[rank (Lie algebra)|rank]]. Almost all of these semisimple Lie algebras are actually simple. These four families, together with five exceptions ([[E6_(mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7_(mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], [[E8_(mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], [[F4_(mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2_(mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]), are in fact the ''only'' simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers.\n\n== Classification ==\n{{see also|Root system}}\n[[File:Connected Dynkin Diagrams.svg|thumb|The simple Lie algebras are classified by the connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s.]]\nEvery semisimple Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 is a [[direct sum]] of simple Lie algebras (by definition), and the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras fall in four families – A<sub>n</sub>, B<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, and D<sub>n</sub> – with five exceptions\n[[E6_(mathematics)|E<sub>6</sub>]], [[E7_(mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]], [[E8_(mathematics)|E<sub>8</sub>]], [[F4_(mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]], and [[G2_(mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]. Simple Lie algebras are classified by the connected [[Dynkin diagram]]s, shown on the right, while semisimple Lie algebras correspond to not necessarily connected Dynkin diagrams, where each component of the diagram corresponds to a summand of the decomposition of the semisimple Lie algebra into simple Lie algebras.\n\nThe classification proceeds by considering a [[Cartan subalgebra]] (see below) and the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint action]] of the Lie algebra on this subalgebra. The [[root system]] of the action then both determines the original Lie algebra and must have a very constrained form, which can be classified by the Dynkin diagrams. See the section below describing Cartan subalgebras and root systems for more details.\n\nThe classification is widely considered one of the most elegant results in mathematics – a brief list of axioms yields, via a relatively short proof, a complete but non-trivial classification with surprising structure. This should be compared to the [[classification of finite simple groups]], which is significantly more complicated.\n\nThe enumeration of the four families is non-redundant and consists only of simple algebras if <math>n \\geq 1</math> for A<sub>n</sub>, <math>n \\geq 2</math> for B<sub>n</sub>, <math>n \\geq 3</math> for C<sub>n</sub>, and <math>n \\geq 4</math> for D<sub>n</sub>. If one starts numbering lower, the enumeration is redundant, and one has [[exceptional isomorphism]]s between simple Lie algebras, which are reflected in [[Dynkin diagram#Isomorphisms|isomorphisms of Dynkin diagrams]]; the E<sub>n</sub> can also be extended down, but below E<sub>6</sub> are isomorphic to other, non-exceptional algebras.\n\nOver a non-algebraically closed field, the classification is more complicated – one classifies simple Lie algebras over the algebraic closure, then for each of these, one classifies simple Lie algebras over the original field which have this form (over the closure). For example, to classify simple real Lie algebras, one classifies real Lie algebras with a given complexification, which are known as [[Real form (Lie theory)|real forms]] of the complex Lie algebra; this can be done by [[Satake diagram]]s, which are Dynkin diagrams with additional data (\"decorations\").<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2002}} Section VI.10</ref>\n\n==Connection with compact Lie groups==\nLet <math>K</math> be a compact Lie group with Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>. Then the complexification <math>\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathfrak{k}+i\\mathfrak{k}</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> is ''reductive'', that is, the direct sum of a complex semisimple Lie algebra and a commutative algebra.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 7.6</ref> If <math>K</math> is simply connected, then <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is actually semisimple.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Proposition 7.7</ref> Conversely, every complex semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> has a ''compact real form'' <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math>, where <math>\\mathfrak{k}</math> is the Lie algebra of a simply connected compact Lie group.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2002}} Section VI.1</ref> For example, the complex semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\mathbb{C})</math> is the complexification of <math>\\mathrm{su}(n)</math>, the Lie algebra of the simply connected compact group [[Special_unitary_group|SU(n)]]. It is possible to develop the theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras from the compact group perspective,<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 7</ref> leading to a simpler way to develop the existence and properties of Cartan subalgebras.\n\nThe [[Compact_group#Classification|classification]] and [[Compact_group#Representation_theory_of_a_connected_compact_Lie_group|representation theory]] of connected compact Lie groups is thus closely related to the associated theories for complex semisimple Lie algebras.\n\n== History<!--linked from 'Dynkin diagram'--> ==\nThe semisimple Lie algebras over the complex numbers were first classified by [[Wilhelm Killing]] (1888–90), though his proof lacked rigor. His proof was made rigorous by [[Élie Cartan]] (1894) in his Ph.D. thesis, who also classified semisimple real Lie algebras. This was subsequently refined, and the present classification by Dynkin diagrams was given by then 22-year-old [[Eugene Dynkin]] in 1947. Some minor modifications have been made (notably by J. P. Serre), but the proof is unchanged in its essentials and can be found in any standard reference, such as {{Harv|Humphreys|1972}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n=== Complete reducibility ===\nA consequence of semisimplicity is a [[Weyl's completely reducibility theorem|theorem due to Weyl]]: every finite-dimensional [[representation of a Lie algebra|representation]] is [[completely reducible]]; that is for every invariant subspace of the representation there is an invariant complement.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 10.9</ref>  Infinite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras are not in general completely reducible.\n\n=== Centerless ===\nSince the center of a Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is an abelian ideal, if <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is semisimple, then its center is zero. (Note: since <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math> has non-trivial center, it is not semisimple.) In other words, the [[adjoint representation of a Lie algebra|adjoint representation]] <math>\\operatorname{ad}</math>  is injective. Moreover, it can be shown that the dimension of the Lie algebra <math>\\operatorname{Der}(\\mathfrak g)</math> of [[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivations]] on <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is equal to the dimension of <math> \\mathfrak g</math>. Hence, <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is Lie algebra isomorphic to <math>\\operatorname{Der}(\\mathfrak g)</math>. (This is a special case of [[Whitehead's lemma (Lie algebras)|Whitehead's lemma]].) Every ideal, quotient and product of semisimple Lie algebras is again semisimple.\n\n=== Linear ===\nThe adjoint representation is injective, and so a semisimple Lie algebra is also a [[linear Lie algebra]] under the adjoint representation. This may lead to some ambiguity, as every Lie algebra is already linear with respect to some other vector space ([[Ado's theorem]]), although not necessarily via the adjoint representation.  But in practice, such ambiguity rarely occurs.\n\n===Jordan decomposition===\nAny endomorphism ''x'' of a finite-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field can be decomposed uniquely into a diagonalizable (or semisimple) and nilpotent part\n:<math>x=s+n\\ </math>\nsuch that ''s'' and ''n'' commute with each other.  Moreover, each of ''s'' and ''n'' is a polynomial in ''x''.  This is a consequence of the [[Jordan–Chevalley decomposition|Jordan decomposition]].\n\nIf <math>x\\in\\mathfrak g</math>, then the image of ''x'' under the adjoint map decomposes as\n:<math>\\operatorname{ad}(x) = \\operatorname{ad}(s) + \\operatorname{ad}(n).</math>\nThe elements ''s'' and ''n'' are ''unique'' elements of <math>\\mathfrak g</math>  such that ''n'' is nilpotent, ''s'' is semisimple, ''n'' and ''s'' commute, and for which such a decomposition holds.  This abstract Jordan decomposition factors through any representation of <math>\\mathfrak g</math> in the sense that given any representation ρ,\n:<math>\\rho(x) = \\rho(s) + \\rho(n)\\,</math>\nis the Jordan decomposition of ρ(''x'') in the endomorphism ring of the representation space.\n\n=== Rank ===\nThe '''rank''' of a complex semisimple Lie algebra is the dimension of any of its [[Cartan subalgebra]]s.\n\n===Representation Theory===\n{{main|Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie algebras}}\n[[Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility]] states that every finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple Lie algebra decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The finite-dimensional, ''irreducible'' representations, meanwhile, are [[Lie_algebra_representation#Finite-dimensional_representations_of_semisimple_Lie_algebras|classified]] by a ''theorem of the highest weight''. One remarkable aspect of this theory is the [[Weyl character formula]].\n\n==Cartan subalgebras and root systems==\n===Definition of a Cartan subalgebra===\nAlthough there is a theory of [[Cartan subalgebra|Cartan subalgebras]] for any Lie algebra, the concept has particular importance and a special form in the case of complex semisimple Lie algebras. If <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> is a complex semisimple Lie algebra, we say that <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a Cartan subalgebra if <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> is a maximal commutative subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> and if <math>\\mathrm{ad}_H</math> is diagonalizable for each <math>H\\in\\mathfrak{h}</math>. An important first step in the study of semisimple Lie algebras is to prove the existence of Cartan subalgebras, and their uniqueness up to automorphism.<ref>{{harvnb|Knapp|2002}} Sections II.2 and II.3</ref> (If one assumes the existence of a compact real form, the existence of a Cartan subalgebra is much simpler to establish.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Chapter 7</ref> In that case, <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> may be taken as the complexification of the Lie algebra of a [[maximal torus]] of the compact group.)\n\nSince Cartan subalgebras of a semisimple Lie algebra <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are unique up to automorphisms of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, all Cartan subalgebras have the same dimension. This common dimension is the '''rank''' of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>.\n\n===Root systems===\n{{see also|Root system|Root system of a semi-simple Lie algebra}}\nGiven a Cartan subalgebra <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, one defines a '''[[root system|root]]''' to be a nonzero element <math>\\alpha</math> of <math>\\mathfrak{h}^*</math> for which there exists a nonzero <math>X\\in\\mathfrak{g}</math> with\n:<math>[H,X]=\\alpha(H)X</math>\nfor all <math>H\\in\\mathfrak{h}</math>. That is to say, the roots are the nonzero [[Weight (representation theory)|weights]] of the adjoint representation. The collection of roots forms a [[root system]]<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.5</ref> and much of the structure of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> derives from its root system. Indeed, the classification of complex semisimple Lie algebras described above comes from a classification of the associated root systems, which in turn are classified by their [[Dynkin diagrams]], as we will explain below.\n\nCartan subalgebras and the associated root systems are a basic tool for understanding both the classification of semisimple Lie algebras and their [[Lie algebra representation#Classifying finite-dimensional representations of Lie_algebras|representation theory]].\n\n===Weyl group===\n{{main|Weyl group}}\nLet <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> be a semisimple Lie algebra, let <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> be a Cartan subalgebra, and let <math>R</math> be the associated root system. For each <math>\\alpha\\in R</math>, we can consider the reflection <math>s_\\alpha</math> about the hyperplane perpendicular to <math>\\alpha</math>. One of the basic properties of root systems ensures that <math>R</math> is invariant under each <math>s_\\alpha</math>. The '''Weyl group''' is then the group of linear transformations of <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> generated by the <math>s_\\alpha</math>'s. The Weyl group is an important symmetry of the problem; for example, the weights of any finite-dimensional representation of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> are invariant under the Weyl group.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Theorem 9.3</ref>\n\n===The case of <math>\\mathrm{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})</math>===\nIf <math>\\mathfrak{g}=\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\mathbb{C})</math>, then <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> may be taken to be the diagonal subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, consisting of diagonal matrices whose diagonal entries sum to zero. Since <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> has dimension <math>n-1</math>, we see that <math>\\mathrm{sl}(n;\\mathbb{C})</math> has rank <math>n-1</math>.\n\nThe root vectors <math>X</math> in this case may be taken to be the matrices <math>E_{i,j}</math> with <math>i\\neq j</math>, where <math>E_{i,j}</math> is the matrix with a 1 in the <math>(i,j)</math> spot and zeros elsewhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Hall|2015}} Section 7.7.1</ref> If <math>H</math> is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries <math>\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n</math>, then we have\n:<math>[H,E_{i,j}]=(\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j)E_{i,j}</math>.\nThus, the roots for <math>\\mathrm{sl}(n,\\mathbb{C})</math> are the linear functionals <math>\\alpha_{i,j}</math> given by\n:<math>\\alpha_{i,j}(H)=\\lambda_i-\\lambda_j</math>.\nAfter identifying <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> with its dual, the roots become the vectors <math>\\alpha_{i,j}:=e_i-e_j</math> in the space of <math>n</math>-tuples that sum to zero. This is the root system [[Root_system#An|known as <math>A_{n-1}</math>]] in the conventional labeling.\n\nThe reflection associated to the root <math>\\alpha_{i,j}</math> acts on <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math> by transposing the <math>i</math> and <math>j</math> diagonal entries. The Weyl group is then just the permutation group on <math>n</math> elements, acting by permuting the diagonal entries of matrices in <math>\\mathfrak{h}</math>.\n\n===Role in the classification===\nSemisimple Lie algebras are ultimately classified by root systems (which in turn are classified by their Dynkin diagrams). The argument is as follows. \n*First, one proves that the Cartan subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra is unique up to isomorphism. It follows that the root system is independent (up to isomorphism) of the choice of Cartan subalgebra. \n*Next, one shows that the root system determines the Lie algebra up to isomorphism. (Thus, for example, there cannot be two nonisomorphic Lie algebras both having the root system <math>A_n</math>.) \n*Finally, one shows that every root system comes from a Lie algebra. This can be done in a case-by-case fashion, with the only hard part being the exceptional root systems of type E, F, and G. Alternatively, one can use a systematic procedure, using [[Root_system_of_a_semi-simple_Lie_algebra#Serre.27s_relations:_Associating_a_semisimple_Lie_algebra_to_a_root_system|Serre's relations]]. \nThese results can be found, for example, in various parts of {{Harv|Humphreys|1972}}, culminating in Section 19.\n\n== Significance ==\nThe significance of semisimplicity comes firstly from the [[Levi decomposition]], which states that every finite dimensional Lie algebra is the semidirect product of a solvable ideal (its radical) and a semisimple algebra. In particular, there is no nonzero Lie algebra that is both solvable and semisimple.\n\nSemisimple Lie algebras have a very elegant classification, in stark contrast to solvable Lie algebras. Semisimple Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field are completely classified by their [[root system]], which are in turn classified by [[Dynkin diagram]]s. Semisimple algebras over non-algebraically closed fields can be understood in terms of those over the algebraic closure, though the classification is somewhat more intricate; see [[real form]] for the case of real semisimple Lie algebras, which were classified by [[Élie Cartan]].\n\nFurther, the [[Lie_algebra_representation#Classifying_finite-dimensional_representations_of_Lie_algebras|representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras]] is much cleaner than that for general Lie algebras. For example, the Jordan decomposition in a semisimple Lie algebra coincides with the Jordan decomposition in its representation; this is not the case for Lie algebras in general.\n\nIf <math>\\mathfrak g</math> is semisimple, then <math>\\mathfrak g = [\\mathfrak g, \\mathfrak g]</math>. In particular, every linear semisimple Lie algebra is a subalgebra of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}</math>, the [[special linear Lie algebra]]. The study of the structure of <math>\\mathfrak{sl}</math> constitutes an important part of the representation theory for semisimple Lie algebras.\n\n== Generalizations ==\n{{Main|Reductive Lie algebra|Split Lie algebra}}\nSemisimple Lie algebras admit certain generalizations. Firstly, many statements that are true for semisimple Lie algebras are true more generally for [[reductive Lie algebra]]s. Abstractly, a reductive Lie algebra is one whose adjoint representation is [[completely reducible]], while concretely, a reductive Lie algebra is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and an [[abelian Lie algebra]]; for example, <math>\\mathfrak{sl}_n</math> is semisimple, and <math>\\mathfrak{gl}_n</math> is reductive. Many properties of semisimple Lie algebras depend only on reducibility.\n\nMany properties of complex semisimple/reductive Lie algebras are true not only for semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, but more generally for [[split Lie algebra|split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras]] over other fields: semisimple/reductive Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields are always split, but over other fields this is not always the case. Split Lie algebras have essentially the same representation theory as semsimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields, for instance, the [[splitting Cartan subalgebra]] playing the same role as the [[Cartan subalgebra]] plays over algebraically closed fields. This is the approach followed in {{Harv|Bourbaki|2005}}, for instance, which classifies representations of split semisimple/reductive Lie algebras.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lie algebra]]\n*[[Root system]]\n*[[Lie algebra representation]]\n*[[Compact group]]\n*[[Simple Lie group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | title=Elements of Mathematics: Lie Groups and Lie Algebras: Chapters 7–9 | authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki | first=Nicolas | last=Bourbaki | chapter = VIII: Split Semi-simple Lie Algebras | year = 2005 | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yh1RHnYCDNsC&pg=PA69 }}\n* {{citation|authorlink1=Karin Erdmann|last1=Erdmann|first1=Karin|last2=Wildon|first2=Mark|title=Introduction to Lie Algebras|edition=1st|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=1-84628-040-0}}.\n*{{Citation| last=Hall|first=Brian C.|title=Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations: An Elementary Introduction|edition=2nd|series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics|volume=222|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=978-3319134666}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Humphreys | first1=James E. | title=Introduction to Lie Algebras and Representation Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-90053-7 | year=1972}}.\n*{{Citation| last=Knapp|first=Anthony W.|title=Lie groups beyond an introduction|edition=2nd|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2002}}\n* {{citation|last=Varadarajan|first=V.
