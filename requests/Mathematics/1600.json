In the same spirit, '''weak Hopf algebras''' are weak bialgebras together with a linear map S satisfying specific conditions; they are generalizations of [[Hopf algebras]].\n\nThese objects were introduced by Böhm, Nill and Szlachányi. The first motivations for studying them came from [[quantum field theory]] and [[operator algebras]].<ref>Böhm, Nill, Szlachányi. p. 387</ref> Weak Hopf algebras have quite interesting representation theory; in particular modules over a semisimple finite weak Hopf algebra is a [[fusion category]] (which is a [[monoidal category]] with extra properties).

Moreover <math>\\mu^{op} = \\mu \\circ \\sigma_{H,H}</math> is the opposite multiplication and <math>\\Delta^{op} = \\sigma_{H, H} \\circ \\Delta</math> is the opposite comultiplication.

Of course any [[Hopf algebra]] is a weak Hopf algebra.\n# '''Groupoid algebra.''' Suppose <math>G = (G_0, G_1)</math> is a [[groupoid]] and let <math>K[G]</math> be the groupoid algebra, in other words, the algebra generated by the morphisms <math> g \\in G_1</math>.

Moreover the homomorphisms spaces are finite-dimensional vector spaces and the endomorphisms space of simple objects are one-dimensional. Finally, the monoidal unit is a simple object. Such a category is called a [[fusion category]].\n\nIt can be shown that some monoidal category are not modules over a Hopf algebra. In the case of fusion categories (which are just monoidal categories with extra conditions), it was proved by Etingof, Nikshych and Ostrik that any fusion category is equivalent to a category of modules over a weak Hopf algebra.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal\n  | last1 = Böhm  | first1 = Gabriella\n  | last2 = Nill  | first2 = Florian\n  | last3 = Szlachányi  | first3 = Kornel\n  | title = Weak Hopf algebras.

      "text": "{{Use American English|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|Algebraic construct of interest in theoretical physics\n}}\n{{Group theory sidebar}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]], the term '''quantum group''' denotes various kinds of [[noncommutative algebra]]s with additional structure. In general, a quantum group is some kind of [[Hopf algebra]]. There is no single, all-encompassing definition, but instead a family of broadly similar objects.{{clarify|paragraph is all over the map; one sentence says non-commutative, one says Hopf, one just gives up; surely there's a better compromise than this jumble?|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe term \"quantum group\" first appeared in the theory of [[Integrable system#Quantum integrable systems|quantum integrable systems]], which was then formalized by [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] and [[Michio Jimbo]] as a particular class of [[Hopf algebra]]. The same term is also used for other Hopf algebras that deform or are close to classical [[Lie groups]] or [[Lie algebras]], such as a `bicrossproduct' class of quantum groups introduced by [[Shahn Majid]] a little after the work of Drinfeld and Jimbo.\n\nIn Drinfeld's approach, quantum groups arise as [[Hopf algebra]]s depending on an auxiliary parameter ''q'' or ''h'', which become [[universal enveloping algebra]]s of a certain Lie algebra, frequently [[semisimple Lie algebra|semisimple]] or [[affine Lie algebra|affine]], when ''q'' = 1 or ''h'' = 0. Closely related are certain dual objects, also Hopf algebras and also called quantum groups, deforming the algebra of functions on the corresponding semisimple [[algebraic group]] or a [[compact Lie group]].\n\nJust as groups often appear as symmetries, quantum groups act on many other mathematical objects.{{clarify|non-sequitur: what does appearing as symmetries have to do with acting on \"other\" mathematical objects? wouldn't it be simpler to just talk about a group action, if the quantum nature isn't central?|date=May 2017}} It has become fashionable{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} to introduce the adjective ''quantum'' in cases where quantum groups act on objects. For example, there are [[quantum plane]]s and [[quantum Grassmannian]]s.{{elucidate|what groups are being used to create these?|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Intuitive meaning ==\nThe discovery of quantum groups was quite unexpected since it was known for a long time that compact groups and semisimple Lie algebras are \"rigid\" objects, in other words, they cannot be \"deformed\". One of the ideas behind quantum groups is that if we consider a structure that is in a sense equivalent but larger, namely a [[group algebra]] or a [[universal enveloping algebra]], then a group  or enveloping algebra can be \"deformed\", although the deformation will no longer remain a group or enveloping algebra. More precisely, deformation can be accomplished within the category of [[Hopf algebra]]s that are not required to be either [[commutative]] or [[cocommutative]]. One can think of the deformed object as an algebra of functions on a \"noncommutative space\", in the spirit of the [[noncommutative geometry]] of [[Alain Connes]]. This intuition, however, came after particular classes of quantum groups had already proved their usefulness in the study of the quantum [[Yang-Baxter equation]] and [[quantum inverse scattering method]] developed by the Leningrad School ([[Ludwig Faddeev]], [[Leon Takhtajan]], [[Evgeny Sklyanin]], [[Nicolai Reshetikhin]] and [[Vladimir Korepin]]) and related work by the Japanese School.<ref>{{citation|first=Christian|last=Schwiebert|title=Generalized quantum inverse scattering|year=1994|id=|arxiv=hep-th/9412237v3|bibcode = 1994hep.th...12237S|pages=12237 }}</ref> The intuition behind the second, [[bicrossproduct]], class of quantum groups was  different and came from the search for self-dual objects as an approach to [[quantum gravity]].<ref>{{citation|first=Shahn|last=Majid|title=Hopf algebras for physics at the Planck scale|year=1988|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume= 5|pages=1587–1607|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/5/12/010|bibcode=1988CQGra...5.1587M|issue=12|citeseerx=10.1.1.125.6178}}</ref>\n\n==Drinfeld–Jimbo type quantum groups==\nOne type of objects commonly called a \"quantum group\" appeared in the work of Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo as a deformation of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] of a [[semisimple Lie algebra]] or, more generally, a [[Kac–Moody algebra]], in the category of [[Hopf algebra]]s. The resulting algebra has additional structure, making it into a [[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]].\n\nLet ''A'' = (''a<sub>ij</sub>'') be the [[Cartan matrix]] of the Kac–Moody algebra, and let ''q'' ≠ 0, 1 be a complex number, then the quantum group, ''U<sub>q</sub>''(''G''), where ''G'' is the Lie algebra whose Cartan matrix is ''A'', is defined as the [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] with generators ''k<sub>λ</sub>'' (where ''λ'' is an element of the [[weight lattice]], i.e. 2(λ, α<sub>''i''</sub>)/(α<sub>''i''</sub>, α<sub>''i''</sub>) is an integer for all ''i''), and ''e<sub>i</sub>'' and ''f<sub>i</sub>'' (for [[Root system#Positive roots and simple roots|simple root]]s, α<sub>''i''</sub>), subject to the following relations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nk_0 &= 1 \\\\\nk_\\lambda k_\\mu &= k_{\\lambda+\\mu} \\\\\nk_\\lambda e_i k_\\lambda^{-1} &= q^{(\\lambda,\\alpha_i)} e_i \\\\\nk_\\lambda f_i k_\\lambda^{-1} &= q^{- (\\lambda,\\alpha_i)} f_i \\\\\n \\left [e_i, f_j \\right ] &= \\delta_{ij} \\frac{k_i - k_i^{-1}}{q_i - q_i^{-1}} && k_i = k_{\\alpha_i}, q_i = q^{\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha_i,\\alpha_i)} \\\\\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAnd for  ''i'' ≠ ''j'' we have the ''q''-Serre relations, which are deformations of the [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]] relations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{n=0}^{1 - a_{ij}} (-1)^n \\frac{[1 - a_{ij}]_{q_i}!}{[1 - a_{ij} - n]_{q_i}!

The center of quantum group can be described by quantum determinant.\n\n===Representation theory===\nJust as there are many different types of representations for Kac–Moody algebras and their universal enveloping algebras, so there are many different types of representation for quantum groups.\n\nAs is the case for all Hopf algebras, ''U<sub>q</sub>''(''G'') has an [[adjoint endomorphism|adjoint representation]] on itself as a module, with the action being given by \n:<math>\\mathrm{Ad}_x \\cdot y = \\sum_{(x)} x_{(1)} y S(x_{(2)}),</math>\nwhere \n:<math>\\Delta(x) = \\sum_{(x)} x_{(1)} \\otimes x_{(2)}.</math>\n\n====Case 1: ''q'' is not a root of unity====\nOne important type of representation is a weight representation, and the corresponding [[Module (mathematics)|module]] is called a weight module. A weight module is a module with a basis of weight vectors. A weight vector is a nonzero vector ''v'' such that ''k<sub>λ</sub>'' · ''v'' = ''d<sub>λ</sub>v'' for all ''λ'', where ''d<sub>λ</sub>'' are complex numbers for all weights ''λ'' such that\n\n:<math>d_0 = 1,</math>\n:<math>d_\\lambda d_\\mu = d_{\\lambda + \\mu},</math> for all weights ''λ'' and ''μ''.\n\nA weight module is called integrable if the actions of ''e<sub>i</sub>'' and ''f<sub>i</sub>''  are locally nilpotent (i.e. for any vector ''v'' in the module, there exists a positive integer ''k'', possibly dependent on ''v'',  such that <math>e_i^k.v = f_i^k.v = 0</math> for all ''i'').  In the case of integrable modules, the complex numbers ''d''<sub>''λ''</sub> associated with a weight vector satisfy <math>d_\\lambda = c_\\lambda q^{(\\lambda,\\nu)}</math>,{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} where ''ν'' is an element of the weight lattice, and ''c<sub>λ</sub>'' are complex numbers such that\n\n:*<math>c_0 = 1,</math>\n:*<math>c_\\lambda c_\\mu = c_{\\lambda + \\mu},</math> for all weights ''λ'' and ''μ'',\n:*<math>c_{2\\alpha_i} = 1</math> for all ''i''.\n\nOf special interest are [[highest weight representation]]s, and the corresponding highest weight modules.  A highest weight module is a module generated by a weight vector ''v'', subject to ''k''<sub>''λ''</sub> · ''v'' = ''d<sub>λ</sub>v'' for all weights ''μ'', and ''e<sub>i</sub>'' · ''v'' = 0 for all ''i''.  Similarly, a quantum group can have a lowest weight representation and lowest weight module, ''i.e.'' a module generated by a weight vector ''v'', subject to ''k<sub>λ</sub>'' · ''v'' = ''d<sub>λ</sub>v'' for all weights ''λ'', and ''f<sub>i</sub>'' · ''v'' = 0 for all ''i''.\n\nDefine a vector ''v'' to have weight ''ν'' if <math>k_\\lambda\\cdot v = q^{(\\lambda,\\nu)} v</math> for all ''λ'' in the weight lattice.\n\nIf ''G'' is a Kac–Moody algebra, then in any irreducible highest weight representation of ''U''<sub>''q''</sub>(''G''), with highest weight ν, the multiplicities of the weights are equal to their multiplicities in an irreducible representation of ''U''(''G'') with equal highest weight.  If the highest weight is dominant and integral (a weight ''μ'' is dominant and integral if ''μ'' satisfies the condition that <math>2 (\\mu,\\alpha_i)/(\\alpha_i,\\alpha_i)</math> is a non-negative integer for all ''i''), then the weight spectrum of the irreducible representation is invariant under the [[Weyl group]] for ''G'', and the representation is integrable.\n\nConversely, if a highest weight module is integrable, then its highest weight vector ''v'' satisfies <math>k_\\lambda\\cdot v = c_\\lambda q^{(\\lambda,\\nu)} v</math>, where ''c''<sub>''λ''</sub> · ''v'' = ''d''<sub>''λ''</sub>''v'' are complex numbers such that\n\n:*<math>c_0 = 1,</math>\n:*<math>c_\\lambda c_\\mu = c_{\\lambda + \\mu},</math> for all weights ''λ'' and ''μ'',\n:*<math>c_{2\\alpha_i} = 1</math> for all ''i'',\n\nand ''ν'' is dominant and integral.\n\nAs is the case for all Hopf algebras, the [[tensor product]] of two modules is another module.  For an element ''x'' of ''U<sub>q</sub>(G)'', and for vectors ''v'' and ''w'' in the respective modules, ''x'' ⋅ (''v'' ⊗ ''w'') = Δ(''x'') ⋅ (''v'' ⊗ ''w''), so that <math>k_\\lambda\\cdot(v \\otimes w) = k_\\lambda\\cdot v \\otimes k_\\lambda.w</math>, and in the case of coproduct Δ<sub>1</sub>, <math>e_i\\cdot(v \\otimes w) = k_i\\cdot v \\otimes e_i\\cdot w + e_i\\cdot v \\otimes w</math> and <math>f_i\\cdot(v \\otimes w) = v \\otimes f_i\\cdot w + f_i\\cdot v \\otimes k_i^{-1}\\cdot w.</math>\n\nThe integrable highest weight module described above is a tensor product of a one-dimensional module (on which ''k''<sub>λ</sub> = ''c''<sub>''λ''</sub> for all ''λ'', and ''e<sub>i</sub>'' = ''f<sub>i</sub>'' = 0 for all ''i'') and a highest weight module generated by a nonzero vector ''v''<sub>0</sub>, subject to <math>k_\\lambda\\cdot v_0 = q^{(\\lambda,\\nu)} v_0</math> for all weights ''λ'', and <math>e_i\\cdot v_0 = 0</math> for all ''i''.\n\nIn the specific case where ''G'' is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra (as a special case of a Kac–Moody algebra), then the irreducible representations with dominant integral highest weights are also finite-dimensional.\n\nIn the case of a tensor product of highest weight modules, its decomposition into submodules is the same as for the tensor product of the corresponding modules of the Kac–Moody algebra (the highest weights are the same, as are their multiplicities).\n\n====Case 2: ''q'' is a root of unity====\n<!--- This subsubsection is waiting for input --->\n\n===Quasitriangularity===\n\n====Case 1: ''q'' is not a root of unity====\nStrictly, the quantum group ''U''<sub>''q''</sub>(''G'') is not quasitriangular, but it can be thought of as being \"nearly quasitriangular\" in that there exists an infinite formal sum which plays the role of an ''R''-matrix.  This infinite formal sum is expressible in terms of generators ''e<sub>i</sub>'' and ''f<sub>i</sub>'', and Cartan generators ''t''<sub>''λ''</sub>, where ''k<sub>λ</sub>'' is formally identified with ''q''<sup>''t''<sub>''λ''</sub></sup>.  The infinite formal sum is the product of two factors,{{citation needed|reason=I could not find this in references or anywhere else. Chari-Pressley has a different formula.|date=July 2016}}\n:<math>q^{\\eta \\sum_j t_{\\lambda_j} \\otimes t_{\\mu_j}}</math>\nand an infinite formal sum, where ''λ''<sub>''j''</sub> is a basis for the dual space to the Cartan subalgebra, and ''μ''<sub>''j''</sub> is the dual basis, and ''η'' = ±1.\n\nThe formal infinite sum which plays the part of the ''R''-matrix has a well-defined action on the tensor product of two irreducible highest weight modules, and also on the tensor product of two lowest weight modules.

L. Woronowicz]] introduced compact matrix quantum groups.  Compact matrix quantum groups are abstract structures on which the \"continuous functions\" on the structure are given by elements of a [[C*-algebra]].  The geometry of a compact matrix quantum group is a special case of a [[noncommutative geometry]].\n\nThe continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space form a commutative C*-algebra.  By the [[Gelfand representation|Gelfand theorem]], a commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space, and the topological space is uniquely determined by the C*-algebra up to [[homeomorphism]].\n\nFor a compact [[topological group]], ''G'', there exists a C*-algebra homomorphism Δ: ''C''(''G'') → ''C''(''G'') ⊗ ''C''(''G'') (where ''C''(''G'') ⊗ ''C''(''G'') is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of ''C''(''G'') and ''C''(''G'')), such that Δ(''f'')(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''(''xy'') for all ''f'' ∈ ''C''(''G''), and for all ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''G'' (where (''f'' ⊗ ''g'')(''x'', ''y'') = ''f''(''x'')''g''(''y'') for all ''f'', ''g'' ∈ ''C''(''G'') and all ''x'', ''y'' ∈ ''G'').  There also exists a linear multiplicative mapping ''κ'': ''C''(''G'') → ''C''(''G''), such that ''κ''(''f'')(''x'') = ''f''(''x''<sup>−1</sup>) for all ''f'' ∈ ''C''(''G'') and all ''x'' ∈ ''G''. Strictly, this does not make ''C''(''G'') a Hopf algebra, unless ''G'' is finite. On the other hand, a finite-dimensional [[group representation|representation]] of ''G'' can be used to generate a *-subalgebra of ''C''(''G'') which is also a Hopf *-algebra.  Specifically, if <math>g \\mapsto (u_{ij}(g))_{i,j}</math> is an ''n''-dimensional representation of ''G'', then for all ''i'', ''j'' ''u<sub>ij</sub>'' ∈ ''C''(''G'') and\n\n:<math>\\Delta(u_{ij}) = \\sum_k u_{ik} \\otimes u_{kj}.</math>\n\nIt follows that the *-algebra generated by ''u<sub>ij</sub>'' for all ''i, j'' and ''κ''(''u<sub>ij</sub>'') for all ''i, j'' is a Hopf *-algebra: the counit is determined by ε(''u<sub>ij</sub>'') = δ<sub>''ij''</sub> for all ''i, j'' (where ''δ''<sub>''ij''</sub> is the [[Kronecker delta]]), the antipode is ''κ'', and the unit is given by\n\n:<math>1 = \\sum_k u_{1k} \\kappa(u_{k1}) = \\sum_k \\kappa(u_{1k}) u_{k1}.</math>\n\nAs a generalization, a compact matrix quantum group is defined as a pair (''C'', ''fu''), where ''C'' is a C*-algebra and <math>u = (u_{ij})_{i,j = 1,\\dots,n}</math> is a matrix with entries in ''C'' such that\n\n:*The *-subalgebra, ''C''<sub>0</sub>, of ''C'', which is generated by the matrix elements of ''u'', is dense in ''C'';\n\n:*There exists a C*-algebra homomorphism called the comultiplication Δ: ''C'' → ''C'' ⊗ ''C'' (where ''C'' ⊗ ''C'' is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of ''C'' and ''C'') such that for all ''i, j'' we have:\n:::<math>\\Delta(u_{ij}) = \\sum_k u_{ik} \\otimes u_{kj}</math>\n\n:*There exists a linear antimultiplicative map κ: ''C''<sub>0</sub> → ''C''<sub>0</sub> (the coinverse) such that ''κ''(''κ''(''v''*)*) = ''v'' for all ''v'' ∈ ''C''<sub>0</sub> and\n:::<math>\\sum_k \\kappa(u_{ik}) u_{kj} = \\sum_k u_{ik} \\kappa(u_{kj}) = \\delta_{ij} I,</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the identity element of ''C''.  Since κ is antimultiplicative, then ''κ''(''vw'') = ''κ''(''w'') ''κ''(''v'') for all ''v'', ''w'' in ''C''<sub>0</sub>.\n\nAs a consequence of continuity, the comultiplication on ''C'' is coassociative.\n\nIn general, ''C'' is not a bialgebra, and ''C''<sub>0</sub> is a Hopf *-algebra.\n\nInformally, ''C'' can be regarded as the *-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions over the compact matrix quantum group, and ''u'' can be regarded as a finite-dimensional representation of the compact matrix quantum group.\n\nA representation of the compact matrix quantum group is given by a [[coalgebra|corepresentation]] of the Hopf *-algebra (a corepresentation of a counital coassociative coalgebra ''A'' is a square matrix <math>v = (v_{ij})_{i,j = 1,\\dots,n}</math> with entries in ''A'' (so ''v'' belongs to M(''n'', ''A'')) such that\n\n:<math>\\Delta(v_{ij}) = \\sum_{k=1}^n v_{ik} \\otimes v_{kj}</math>\n\nfor all ''i'', ''j'' and ''ε''(''v<sub>ij</sub>'') = δ<sub>''ij''</sub> for all ''i, j'').  Furthermore, a representation ''v'', is called unitary if the matrix for ''v'' is unitary (or equivalently, if κ(''v<sub>ij</sub>'') = ''v*<sub>ij</sub>'' for all ''i'', ''j'').\n\nAn example of a compact matrix quantum group is SU<sub>μ</sub>(2), where the parameter μ is a positive real number.  So SU<sub>μ</sub>(2) = (C(SU<sub>μ</sub>(2)), ''u''), where C(SU<sub>μ</sub>(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by α and γ, subject to\n\n:<math>\\gamma \\gamma^* = \\gamma^* \\gamma, </math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\gamma = \\mu \\gamma \\alpha, </math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\gamma^* = \\mu \\gamma^* \\alpha, </math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\alpha^* + \\mu \\gamma^* \\gamma = \\alpha^* \\alpha + \\mu^{-1} \\gamma^* \\gamma = I,</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>u = \\left( \\begin{matrix} \\alpha & \\gamma \\\\ - \\gamma^* & \\alpha^* \\end{matrix} \\right),</math>\n\nso that the comultiplication is determined by ∆(α) = α ⊗ α − γ ⊗ γ*, ∆(γ) = α ⊗ γ + γ ⊗ α*, and the coinverse is determined by κ(α) = α*, κ(γ) = −μ<sup>−1</sup>γ, κ(γ*) = −μγ*, κ(α*) = α.  Note that ''u'' is a representation, but not a unitary representation. ''u'' is equivalent to the unitary representation\n\n:<math>v = \\left( \\begin{matrix} \\alpha & \\sqrt{\\mu} \\gamma \\\\ - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} \\gamma^* & \\alpha^* \\end{matrix} \\right).</math>\n\nEquivalently, SU<sub>μ</sub>(2) = (C(SU<sub>μ</sub>(2)), ''w''), where C(SU<sub>μ</sub>(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by α and β, subject to\n\n:<math>\\beta \\beta^* = \\beta^* \\beta,</math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\beta = \\mu \\beta \\alpha,</math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\beta^* = \\mu \\beta^* \\alpha,</math>\n:<math>\\alpha \\alpha^* + \\mu^2 \\beta^* \\beta = \\alpha^* \\alpha + \\beta^* \\beta = I,</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>w = \\left( \\begin{matrix} \\alpha & \\mu \\beta \\\\ - \\beta^* & \\alpha^* \\end{matrix} \\right),</math>\n\nso that the comultiplication is determined by ∆(α) = α ⊗ α − μβ ⊗ β*, Δ(β) = α ⊗ β + β ⊗ α*, and the coinverse is determined by κ(α) = α*, κ(β) = −μ<sup>−1</sup>β, κ(β*) = −μβ*, κ(α*) = α.  Note that ''w'' is a unitary representation.  The realizations can be identified by equating <math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\mu} \\beta</math>.\n\nWhen μ = 1, then SU<sub>μ</sub>(2) is equal to the algebra ''C''(SU(2)) of functions on the concrete compact group SU(2).\n\n==Bicrossproduct quantum groups==\nWhereas compact matrix pseudogroups are typically versions of  Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups in a dual function algebra formulation, with additional structure, the bicrossproduct ones are a distinct second family of quantum groups of increasing importance as deformations of solvable rather than semisimple Lie groups. They are associated to Lie splittings of Lie algebras or local factorisations of Lie groups and can be viewed as the cross product or Mackey quantisation of one of the factors acting on the other for the algebra and a similar story for the coproduct Δ with the second factor acting back on the first. The very simplest nontrivial example corresponds to two copies of '''R''' locally acting on each other and results in a quantum group  (given here in an algebraic form) with generators ''p'', ''K'', ''K''<sup>−1</sup>, say, and coproduct\n\n:<math>[p, K]=h K(K-1)</math>\n:<math>\\Delta p=p\\otimes K+1\\otimes p</math>\n:<math>\\Delta K=K\\otimes K</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is the deformation parameter. This quantum group was linked to a toy model of Planck scale physics implementing [[Born reciprocity]] when viewed as a deformation of the [[Heisenberg algebra]] of quantum mechanics. Also, starting with any compact real form of a semisimple Lie algebra '''g''' its complexification as a real Lie algebra of twice the dimension splits into '''g''' and a certain solvable Lie algebra (the Iwasawa decomposition), and this provides a canonical bicrossproduct quantum group associated to '''g'''. For '''su'''(2) one obtains a quantum group deformation of the [[Euclidean group]] E(3) of motions in 3 dimensions.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hopf algebra]]\n* [[Lie bialgebra]]\n* [[Poisson–Lie group]]\n* [[Quantum affine algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last=Grensing | first=Gerhard | year=2013 | title=Structural Aspects of Quantum Field Theory and Noncommutative Geometry | publisher=World Scientific | isbn=978-981-4472-69-2 | doi=10.1142/8771 }}\n*{{cite arxiv |last= Jagannathan |first= R. |authorlink= Ramaswamy Jagannathan |year= 2001 |title= Some introductory notes on quantum groups, quantum algebras, and their applications |eprint=math-ph/0105002}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Kassel | first1=Christian | title=Quantum groups | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Graduate Texts in Mathematics | isbn=978-0-387-94370-1 |mr=1321145 | year=1995 | volume=155 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4612-0783-2}}\n* {{cite book |last= Lusztig |first= George |year= 2010 |origyear= 1993 |title= Introduction to Quantum Groups |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=HKPjCUiOUQ0C&printsec=frontcover |location= Cambridge,&nbsp;MA |publisher= Birkhäuser |isbn= 978-0-817-64716-2 }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Majid | first1=Shahn | title=A quantum groups primer | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=London Mathematical Society Lecture Note Series | isbn=978-0-521-01041-2 |mr=1904789 | year=2002 | volume=292 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511549892}}\n* {{ citation\n   | last = Majid\n   | first = Shahn\n   | title = What Is...a Quantum Group?\n   | journal = [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]\n   |date=January 2006\n   | volume = 53\n   | issue = 1\n   | pages = 30&ndash;31\n   | url = http://www.ams.org/notices/200601/what-is.pdf\n   | format = [[PDF]]\n   | accessdate = 2008-01-16 }}\n* {{citation|title=Introduction to quantum groups|journal=Reviews in Mathematical Physics|volume=10|issue=4|first1=P.|last1=Podles|first2=E.|last2=Muller|id=|arxiv=q-alg/9704002|bibcode = 1997q.alg.....4002P|year=1998|pages=511–551|doi=10.1142/S0129055X98000173}}\n* {{cite book |last1= Shnider |first1= Steven |author1-link= Steve Shnider |last2= Sternberg |first2= Shlomo |year= 1993 |title= Quantum groups: From coalgebras to Drinfeld algebras |series= Graduate Texts in Mathematical Physics |volume= 2 |location= Cambridge,&nbsp;MA |publisher= International Press }}\n* {{Citation | last1=Street | first1=Ross | author1-link=Ross Street | title=Quantum groups | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Australian Mathematical Society Lecture Series | isbn=978-0-521-69524-4|mr=2294803 | year=2007 | volume=19 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511618505}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quantum Group}}\n[[Category:Quantum groups| ]]\n[[Category:Mathematical quantization]]"

Each vertex of the graph represents an element of the <math>\\mathbb Q</math>-basis <math>B</math> of <math>L/qL</math>, and a directed edge, labelled by ''i'', and directed from vertex <math>v_1</math> to vertex <math>v_2</math>, represents that <math>b_2 = \\tilde{f}_i b_1</math> (and, equivalently, that <math>b_1 = \\tilde{e}_i b_2</math>), where <math>b_1</math> is the basis element represented by <math>v_1</math>, and <math>b_2</math> is the basis element represented by <math>v_2</math>.  The graph completely determines the actions of <math>\\tilde{e}_i</math> and <math>\\tilde{f}_i</math> at <math>q = 0</math>.  If an integrable module has a crystal base, then the module is irreducible if and only if the graph representing the crystal base is connected (a graph is called \"connected\" if the set of vertices cannot be partitioned into the union of nontrivial disjoint subsets <math>V_1</math> and <math>V_2</math> such that there are no edges joining any vertex in <math>V_1</math> to any vertex in <math>V_2</math>).\n\nFor any integrable module with a crystal base, the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the module, and therefore the weight spectrum for the crystal base is the same as the weight spectrum for the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra.  The multiplicities of the weights in the crystal base are also the same as their multiplicities in the corresponding module of the appropriate Kac–Moody algebra.\n\nIt is a theorem of Kashiwara that every integrable highest weight module has a crystal base.

The name ''Yangian'' was introduced by [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] in 1985 in honor of [[C.N. Yang]].{{why|date=May 2017}}\n\nInitially, they were considered a convenient tool to generate the solutions of the quantum [[Yang–Baxter equation]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe center of Yangian can be described  by [[quantum determinant]].{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Description ==\n\nFor any finite-dimensional [[semisimple Lie algebra]] ''a'', Drinfeld defined an infinite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]] ''Y''(''a''), called the '''Yangian''' of ''a''. This Hopf algebra is a deformation of the [[universal enveloping algebra]] ''U''(''a''[''z'']) of the Lie algebra of polynomial loops of ''a'' given by explicit generators and relations. The relations can be encoded by identities involving a rational [[R-matrix|''R''-matrix]]. Replacing it with a trigonometric ''R''-matrix, one arrives at [[affine quantum group]]s, defined in the same paper of Drinfeld.\n\nIn the case of the [[general linear group|general linear Lie algebra]] ''gl''<sub>''N''</sub>, the Yangian admits a simpler description in terms of a single ''ternary'' (or ''RTT'') ''relation'' on the matrix generators due to Faddeev and coauthors. \nThe Yangian Y(''gl''<sub>''N''</sub>) is defined to be the algebra generated by elements <math>t_{ij}^{(p)}</math> with 1 ≤ ''i'', ''j'' ≤ ''N'' and ''p'' ≥ 0, subject to the relations\n\n:<math> [t_{ij}^{(p+1)}, t_{kl}^{(q)}] -  [t_{ij}^{(p)}, t_{kl}^{(q+1)}]= -(t_{kj}^{(p)}t_{il}^{(q)} - t_{kj}^{(q)} t_{il}^{(p)}).</math>\n\nDefining <math>t_{ij}^{(-1)}=\\delta_{ij}</math>, setting\n\n:<math> T(z) = \\sum_{p\\ge -1} t_{ij}^{(p)} z^{-p+1}</math>\n\nand introducing the [[R-matrix]] ''R''(''z'') = I + ''z''<sup>−1</sup> ''P'' on '''C'''<sup>''N''</sup><math>\\otimes</math>'''C'''<sup>''N''</sup>,\nwhere ''P'' is the operator permuting the tensor factors, the above relations can be written more simply as the ternary relation:\n\n:<math>\\displaystyle{ R_{12}(z-w) T_{1}(z)T_{2}(w) = T_{2}(w) T_{1}(z) R_{12}(z-w).}</math>\n\nThe Yangian becomes a [[Hopf algebra]] with comultiplication Δ, counit ε and antipode ''s'' given by\n\n:<math> (\\Delta \\otimes \\mathrm{id})T(z)=T_{12}(z)T_{13}(z), \\,\\, (\\varepsilon\\otimes \\mathrm{id})T(z)= I, \\,\\, (s\\otimes \\mathrm{id})T(z)=T(z)^{-1}.</math>\n\nAt special values of the spectral parameter <math>(z-w) </math>, the ''R''-matrix degenerates to a rank one projection. This can be used to define the '''quantum determinant''' of  <math>T(z) </math>, which generates the center of the Yangian.\n\nThe '''twisted Yangian''' Y<sup>−</sup>(''gl''<sub>''2N''</sub>), introduced by G. I.

Olshansky and I.Cherednik discovered that the Yangian of ''gl''<sub>''N''</sub> is closely related with the branching properties of irreducible finite-dimensional representations of general linear algebras. In particular, the classical Gelfand–Tsetlin construction of a basis in the space of such a representation has a natural interpretation in the language of Yangians, studied by M.Nazarov and V.Tarasov. Olshansky, Nazarov and [[Alexander Molev|Molev]] later discovered a generalization of this theory to other [[classical group|classical Lie algebra]]s, based on the twisted Yangian.\n\n=== Physics ===\nThe Yangian appears as a symmetry group in different models in physics.{{why|date=May 2017}}\n\nYangian appears as a symmetry group of one-dimensional exactly solvable models such as [[Heisenberg model (quantum)|spin chains]], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9310158 Hubbard model] and in models of one-dimensional [[relativistic quantum field theory]].\n\nThe most famous occurrence is in planar [[N=4 super Yang-Mills|supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory]] in four dimensions, where Yangian structures appear on the level of symmetries of operators,<ref>Beisert, N.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''bivector''' or '''2-vector''' is a quantity in [[exterior algebra]] or [[geometric algebra]] that extends the idea of [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s and [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s. If a scalar is considered an order zero quantity, and a vector is an order one quantity, then a bivector can be thought of as being of order two. Bivectors have applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. They are related to [[complex number]]s in two dimensions and to both [[pseudovector]]s and [[quaternion]]s in three dimensions. They can be used to generate [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s in any number of dimensions, and are a useful tool for classifying such rotations. They also are used in [[physics]], tying together a number of otherwise unrelated quantities.\n\nBivectors are generated by the [[exterior product]] on vectors: given two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', their exterior product {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} is a bivector, as is the sum of any bivectors. Not all bivectors can be generated as a single exterior product. More precisely, a bivector that can be expressed as an exterior product is called ''simple''; in up to three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but in higher dimensions this is not the case.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 87\"/> The exterior product of two vectors is [[anticommutativity|anticommutative]] and [[Alternating multilinear map|alternating]], so {{nowrap|'''b''' ∧ '''a'''}} is the negation of the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}, producing the opposite orientation, and {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''a'''}} is the zero bivector.\n\n[[File:Wedge product.JPG|thumb|170px|Parallel plane segments with the same orientation and area corresponding to the same bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}.<ref name=Dorst>\n{{cite book |author1=Leo Dorst |author2=Daniel Fontijne |author3=Stephen Mann |title=Geometric Algebra for Computer Science: An Object-Oriented Approach to Geometry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-1-zRTeCXwgC&pg=PA32#v=onepage&q=&f=false |page=32 |isbn=978-0-12-374942-0 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2009 |edition=2nd |quote=The algebraic bivector is not specific on shape; geometrically it is an amount of oriented area in a specific plane, that's all.}}</ref>]]\n\nGeometrically, a simple bivector can be interpreted as an oriented [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] segment, much as [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s can be thought of as directed [[line segment]]s.<ref name=Hestenes>\n{{cite book |title=New foundations for classical mechanics: Fundamental Theories of Physics |author=David Hestenes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlvTCEzSI5wC&pg=PA21 |page=21 |isbn=978-0-7923-5302-7 |edition=2nd |year=1999 |publisher=Springer |authorlink=David Hestenes}}\n</ref> The bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} has a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|''magnitude'']] equal to the area of the [[parallelogram]] with edges '''a''' and '''b''', has the [[attitude (geometry)|''attitude'']] of the plane spanned by '''a''' and '''b''', and has ''orientation'' being the sense of the rotation that would align '''a''' with '''b'''.<ref name=Hestenes/><ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 33</ref> \n<!-- (This may be useful but not needed at the moment) <ref name=Table>\nSee Table 28.1, p. 403 in {{cite book |title=Clifford (geometric) algebras with applications to physics, mathematics, and engineering |author=B Jancewicz |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Nji78YQKfQC&pg=PA403 |editor=William Eric Baylis |isbn=0-8176-3868-7 |year=1996 |publisher=Springer |chapter=§28.3 Forms and pseudoforms}}</ref> -->\n\nIn layman terms, any surface is the same bivector, if it has the same area, same orientation, and is parallel to the same plane (see figure).\n\n==History==\nThe bivector was first defined in 1844 by German mathematician [[Hermann Grassmann]] in [[exterior algebra]] as the result of the [[exterior algebra#Formal definitions and algebraic properties|exterior product]] of two vectors.

It was not until English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in 1888 added the geometric product to Grassmann's algebra, incorporating the ideas of both Hamilton and Grassmann, and founded [[Clifford algebra]], that the bivector as it is known today was fully understood.\n\nAround this time [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] developed [[vector calculus]], which included separate [[cross product]] and [[dot product]]s that were derived from quaternion multiplication.<ref name=Rowe>{{cite book\n|title=The Emergence of the American Mathematical Research Community, 1876–1900\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uMvcfEYr6tsC&pg=PA31\n|page=31 ''ff''\n|author1=Karen Hunger Parshall |author2=David E.

This in practice is not much of a restriction, as all useful applications are drawn from such algebras. Also unless otherwise stated, all examples have a [[Metric tensor#The Euclidean metric|Euclidean metric]] and so a [[positive-definite]] [[quadratic form]].\n\n===Geometric algebra and the geometric product===\nThe bivector arises from the definition of the [[Geometric algebra#Definition and notation|geometric product]] over a vector space. For vectors '''a''', '''b''' and '''c''', the geometric product on vectors is defined as follows:\n\n;[[Associativity]]: <math> (\\mathbf{ab})\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{bc}) </math>\n;Left and right [[distributivity]]: <math>\\begin{align}\n  \\mathbf{a}(\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}) &= \\mathbf{ab} + \\mathbf{ac} \\\\\n  (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c})\\mathbf{a} &= \\mathbf{ba} + \\mathbf{ca}\n\\end{align}</math>\n;Contraction: <math> {\\mathbf{a}}^2 = Q(\\mathbf{a}) = \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{a}}{\\left |\\mathbf{a}\\right|}^2</math>{{paragraph}} Where ''Q'' is the quadratic form, |'''a'''| is the [[Norm (mathematics)|magnitude]] of '''a''' and ''ϵ''<sub>'''a'''</sub> is the [[Metric signature|signature]] of the vector. For a space with Euclidean metric ''ϵ''<sub>'''a'''</sub> is 1 so can be omitted, and the contraction condition becomes:{{paragraph}} <math> {\\mathbf{a}}^2 = {\\left |\\mathbf{a}\\right|}^2</math>\n\n===The interior product===\nFrom associativity {{nowrap|'''a'''('''ab''') {{=}} '''a'''<sup>2</sup>'''b'''}}, a scalar times '''b'''. When '''b''' is not parallel to and hence not a scalar multiple of '''a''', '''ab''' cannot be a scalar. But\n\n: <math> \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} + \\mathbf{ba}) = \\frac{1}{2} ((\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b})^2 - \\mathbf{a}^2 - \\mathbf{b}^2)</math>\n\nis a sum of scalars and so a scalar. From the [[law of cosines]] on the triangle formed by the vectors its value is |'''a'''||'''b'''|cos''θ'', where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. It is therefore identical to the interior product between two vectors, and is written the same way,\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} + \\mathbf{ba}).</math>\n\nIt is symmetric, scalar valued, and can be used to determine the angle between two vectors: in particular if '''a''' and '''b''' are orthogonal the product is zero.\n\n===The exterior product===\nJust as the interior product can be formulated as the symmetric part of the geometric product of another quantity, the exterior product can be formulated as its [[Alternatization|antisymmetric part]]:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} - \\mathbf{ba})</math>\n\nIt is antisymmetric in '''a''' and '''b'''\n: <math> \\mathbf{b} \\wedge \\mathbf{a} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ba} - \\mathbf{ab})  = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} - \\mathbf{ba}) = -\\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nand by addition:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} + \\mathbf{ba}) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{ab} - \\mathbf{ba}) = \\mathbf{ab}</math>\n\nThat is, the geometric product is the sum of the symmetric interior product and antisymmetric exterior product.\n\nTo examine the nature of {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}, consider the formula\n: <math>(\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})^2 - (\\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b})^2 = \\mathbf{a}^2\\mathbf{b}^2 ,</math>\n\nwhich using the [[Pythagorean trigonometric identity]] gives the value of {{nowrap|('''a''' ∧ '''b''')<sup>2</sup>}}\n\n: <math> (\\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b})^2 = (\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b})^2 - \\mathbf{a}^2\\mathbf{b}^2 = \\left|\\mathbf{a}\\right|^2\\left|\\mathbf{b}\\right|^2( \\cos^2 \\theta - 1) = -\\left|\\mathbf{a}\\right|^2\\left|\\mathbf{b}\\right|^2\\sin^2 \\theta</math>\n\nWith a negative square it cannot be a scalar or vector quantity, so it is a new sort of object, a '''bivector'''. It has [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] {{nowrap|{{abs|'''a'''}} {{abs|'''b'''|}} {{abs|sin''θ''|}}}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors, and so is zero for parallel vectors.\n\nTo distinguish them from vectors, bivectors are written here with bold capitals, for example:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} = -\\mathbf{b} \\wedge \\mathbf{a} \\ ,</math>\n\nalthough other conventions are used, in particular as vectors and bivectors are both elements of the geometric algebra.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===The space Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>===\nThe algebra generated by the geometric product is the [[geometric algebra]] over the vector space. For a Euclidean vector space it is written <math>\\mathcal{G}_n</math> or ''C''ℓ<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ), where ''n'' is the dimension of the vector space ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>. ''C''ℓ<sub>''n''</sub> is both a vector space and an algebra, generated by all the products between vectors in ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>, so it contains all vectors and bivectors. More precisely as a vector space it contains the vectors and bivectors as [[linear subspace]]s, though not [[subalgebra]]s (since the geometric product of two vectors is not generally another vector). The space of all bivectors is written Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 35\">Lounesto (2001) p. 35</ref>\n\n===The even subalgebra===\nThe subalgebra generated by the bivectors is the ''even subalgebra'' of the geometric algebra, written {{SubSup|''C''ℓ|''n''|+}}. This algebra results from considering all products of scalars and bivectors generated by the geometric product. It has dimension {{nowrap|2<sup>''n''−1</sup>}}, and contains Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> as a linear subspace with dimension {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' − 1)}} (a [[triangular number]]). In two and three dimensions the even subalgebra contains only scalars and bivectors, and each is of particular interest. In two dimensions the even subalgebra is [[isomorphic]] to the [[complex number]]s, ℂ, while in three it is isomorphic to the [[quaternion]]s, ℍ. More generally the even subalgebra can be used to generate [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s in any dimension, and can be generated by bivectors in the algebra.\n\n===Magnitude===\nAs noted in the previous section the magnitude of a simple bivector, that is one that is the exterior product of two vectors '''a''' and '''b''', is |'''a'''||'''b'''|sin ''θ'', where ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. It is written |'''B'''|, where '''B''' is the bivector.\n\nFor general bivectors the magnitude can be calculated by taking the [[Euclidean distance|norm]] of the bivector considered as a vector in the space Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>. If the magnitude is zero then all the bivector's components are zero, and the bivector is the zero bivector which as an element of the geometric algebra equals the scalar zero.\n\n===Unit bivectors===\nA unit bivector is one with unit magnitude. It can be derived from any non-zero bivector by dividing the bivector by its magnitude, that is\n\n: <math>\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\left|\\mathbf{B}\\right|}.</math>\n\nOf particular interest are the unit bivectors formed from the products of the [[standard basis]]. If '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> and '''e'''<sub>''j''</sub> are distinct basis vectors then the product  {{nowrap|'''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> ∧ '''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>}} is a bivector. As the vectors are orthogonal this is just '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub>'''e'''<sub>''j''</sub>, written '''e'''<sub>''ij''</sub>, with unit magnitude as the vectors are [[unit vector]]s. The set of all such bivectors form a basis for Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>. For instance in four dimensions the basis for Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>4</sup> is ('''e'''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>3</sub>, '''e'''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>4</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>3</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>4</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>'''e'''<sub>4</sub>) or ('''e'''<sub>12</sub>, '''e'''<sub>13</sub>, '''e'''<sub>14</sub>, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>24</sub>, '''e'''<sub>34</sub>).<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 86</ref>\n\n===Simple bivectors===\nThe exterior product of two vectors is a bivector, but not all bivectors are exterior products of two vectors. For example, in four dimensions the bivector\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{e}_1 \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3 \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_4 = \\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3\\mathbf{e}_4 = \\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{34}</math>\n\ncannot be written as the exterior product of two vectors. A bivector that can be written as the exterior product of two vectors is simple. In two and three dimensions all bivectors are simple, but not in four or more dimensions; in four dimensions every bivector is the sum of at most two exterior products. A bivector has a real square if and only if it is simple, and only simple bivectors can be represented geometrically by an oriented plane area.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 87\">Lounesto (2001) p. 87</ref>\n\n===Product of two bivectors===\nThe geometric product of two bivectors, '''A''' and '''B''', is\n\n: <math>  \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}  + \\mathbf{A} \\wedge \\mathbf{B}.  </math>\n\nThe quantity {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''B'''}} is the scalar valued interior product, while {{nowrap|'''A'''  ∧ '''B'''}} is the grade 4 exterior product that arises in four or more dimensions. The quantity {{nowrap|'''A''' × '''B'''}} is the bivector valued [[commutator]] product, given by\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{AB} - \\mathbf{BA}),</math><ref name = \"HestenesPG\">{{cite journal\n| title = Projective Geometry with Clifford Algebra\n|last1 = Hestenes\n|first1=David\n|last2=Ziegler\n|first2=Renatus\n|journal=Acta Applicandae Mathematicae\n|volume=23\n|year=1991\n|pages=25–63\n|url=http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/PGwithCA.pdf\n|doi=10.1007/bf00046919|citeseerx = 10.1.1.125.368\n}}</ref>\n\nThe space of bivectors Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> are a [[Lie algebra]] over ℝ, with the commutator product as the Lie bracket. The full geometric product of bivectors generates the even subalgebra.\n\nOf particular interest is the product of a bivector with itself. As the commutator product is antisymmetric the product simplifies to\n\n: <math>  \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A} \\wedge \\mathbf{A}. </math>\n\nIf the bivector is ''simple'' the last term is zero and the product is the scalar valued {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''A'''}}, which can be used as a check for simplicity. In particular the exterior product of bivectors only exists in four or more dimensions, so all bivectors in two and three dimensions are simple.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 87\"/>\n\n==Two dimensions==\nWhen working with coordinates in geometric algebra it is usual to write the [[basis vectors]] as ('''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, ...), a convention that will be used here.\n\nA [[Euclidean vector|vector]] in real two-dimensional space ℝ<sup>2</sup> can be written {{nowrap|'''a''' {{=}} ''a''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>1</sub> + ''a''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub>}}, where ''a''<sub>1</sub> and ''a''<sub>2</sub> are real numbers, '''e'''<sub>1</sub> and '''e'''<sub>2</sub> are [[orthonormal]] basis vectors. The geometric product of two such vectors is\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \\mathbf{a}\\mathbf{b} &= (a_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\\mathbf{e}_2)(b_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + b_2\\mathbf{e}_2) \\\\&= a_1b_1\\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + a_1b_2\\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_2 + a_2b_1\\mathbf{e}_2\\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2b_2\\mathbf{e}_2\\mathbf{e}_2 \\\\&= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_2. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThis can be split into the symmetric, scalar valued, interior product and an antisymmetric, bivector valued exterior product:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align} \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} &= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2, \\\\ \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} &= (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_2 = (a_1b_2 - a_2b_1)\\mathbf{e}_{12}. \\end{align}</math>\n\nAll bivectors in two dimensions are of this form, that is multiples of the bivector '''e'''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub>, written '''e'''<sub>12</sub> to emphasise it is a bivector rather than a vector. The magnitude of '''e'''<sub>12</sub> is 1, with\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}_{12}^2 = -1, </math>\n\nso it is called the '''unit bivector'''. The term unit bivector can be used in other dimensions but it is only uniquely defined (up to a sign) in two dimensions and all bivectors are multiples of '''e'''<sub>12</sub>. As the highest grade element of the algebra '''e'''<sub>12</sub> is also the [[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)|pseudoscalar]] which is given the symbol ''i''.\n\n===Complex numbers===\nWith the properties of negative square and unit magnitude, the unit bivector can be identified with the [[imaginary unit]] from [[complex numbers]]. The bivectors and scalars together form the even subalgebra of the geometric algebra, which is [[isomorphic]] to the complex numbers ℂ. The even subalgebra has basis (1, '''e'''<sub>12</sub>), the whole algebra has basis (1, '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>12</sub>).\n\nThe complex numbers are usually identified with the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinate axes]] and two-dimensional vectors, which would mean associating them with the vector elements of the geometric algebra. There is no contradiction in this, as to get from a general vector to a complex number an axis needs to be identified as the real axis, '''e'''<sub>1</sub> say. This multiplies by all vectors to generate the elements of even subalgebra.\n\nAll the properties of complex numbers can be derived from bivectors, but two are of particular interest. First as with complex numbers products of bivectors and so the even subalgebra are [[commutative]]. This is only true in two dimensions, so properties of the bivector in two dimensions that depend on commutativity do not usually generalise to higher dimensions.\n\nSecond a general bivector can be written\n\n: <math>\\theta\\mathbf{e}_{12} = i\\theta,</math>\n\nwhere ''θ'' is a real number. Putting this into the [[Taylor series]] for the [[exponential function|exponential map]] and using the property '''e<sub>12</sub>'''<sup>2</sup> = −1 results in a bivector version of [[Euler's formula]],\n\n: <math>e^{\\theta\\mathbf{e}_{12}} = e^{i\\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i\\sin{\\theta},</math>\n\nwhich when multiplied by any vector rotates it through an angle ''θ'' about the origin:\n\n: <math> (x'\\mathbf{e}_1 + y'\\mathbf{e}_2) =  (x\\mathbf{e}_1 + y\\mathbf{e}_2)e^{i\\theta}.</math>\n\nThe product of a vector with a bivector in two dimensions is [[anticommutative]], so the following products all generate the same rotation\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{v}' =  \\mathbf{v}e^{i\\theta}  = e^{-i\\theta}\\mathbf{v} = e^{\\frac{-i\\theta}{2}} \\mathbf{v}e^{\\frac{i\\theta}{2}}.</math>\n\nOf these the last product is the one that generalises into higher dimensions. The quantity needed is called a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]] and is given the symbol ''R'', so in two dimensions a rotor that rotates through angle ''θ'' can be written\n\n: <math> R = e^{\\frac{-i\\theta}{2}} = e^{\\frac{-\\theta\\mathbf{e}_{12}}{2}}, </math>\n\nand the rotation it generates is<ref>Lounesto (2001) p.29</ref>\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{v}' = R\\mathbf{v}R^{-1}.\\,</math>\n\n==Three dimensions==\nIn [[three dimensions]] the geometric product of two vectors is\n: <math> \\begin{align} \\mathbf{ab}  &= (a_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + a_2\\mathbf{e}_2 + a_3\\mathbf{e}_3)(b_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + b_2\\mathbf{e}_2 + b_3\\mathbf{e}_3) \\\\ &= a_1 b_1{\\mathbf{e}_1}^2 + a_2 b_2{\\mathbf{e}_2}^2 + a_3 b_3{\\mathbf{e}_3}^2 + (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2)\\mathbf{e}_2\\mathbf{e}_3  + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3)\\mathbf{e}_3\\mathbf{e}_1 + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)\\mathbf{e}_1\\mathbf{e}_2. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThis can be split into the symmetric, scalar valued, interior product and the antisymmetric, bivector valued, exterior product:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align} \\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} &= a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \\\\ \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} &= (a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2)\\mathbf{e}_{23}  + (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3)\\mathbf{e}_{31} + (a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1)\\mathbf{e}_{12}. \\end{align}</math>\n\nIn three dimensions all bivectors are simple and so the result of an exterior product. The unit bivectors '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>31</sub> and '''e'''<sub>12</sub> form a basis for the space of bivectors Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>3</sup>, which is itself a three-dimensional linear space. So if a general bivector is:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} = A_{23}\\mathbf{e}_{23} + A_{31}\\mathbf{e}_{31} + A_{12}\\mathbf{e}_{12},  </math>\n\nthey can be added like vectors\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B} = (A_{23} + B_{23})\\mathbf{e}_{23} + (A_{31} + B_{31})\\mathbf{e}_{31} + (A_{12} + B_{12})\\mathbf{e}_{12}.  </math>\n\nwhile when multiplied they produce the following\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B} = -A_{23}B_{23} - A_{31}B_{31} - A_{12}B_{12} + (A_{12}B_{31} - A_{31}B_{12})\\mathbf{e}_{23} + (A_{23}B_{12} - A_{12}B_{23})\\mathbf{e}_{31} + (A_{31}B_{23} - A_{23}B_{31})\\mathbf{e}_{12} </math>\n\nwhich can be split into symmetric scalar and antisymmetric bivector parts as follows\n\n: <math>\\begin{align} \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} &= -A_{12}B_{12} - A_{31}B_{31} - A_{23}B_{23} \\\\ \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B} &= (A_{23}B_{31} - A_{31}B_{23})\\mathbf{e}_{12} + (A_{12}B_{23} - A_{23}B_{12})\\mathbf{e}_{13} + (A_{31}B_{12} - A_{12}B_{31})\\mathbf{e}_{23}. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe exterior product of two bivectors in three dimensions is zero.\n\nA bivector '''B''' can be written as the product of its magnitude and a unit bivector, so writing ''β'' for |'''B'''| and using the Taylor series for the exponential map it can be shown that\n\n: <math>e^\\mathbf{B} = e^{\\beta\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\beta}} = \\cos{\\beta} + \\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{\\beta}\\sin{\\beta}.</math>\n\nThis is another version of Euler's formula, but with a general bivector in three dimensions. Unlike in two dimensions bivectors are not commutative so properties that depend on commutativity do not apply in three dimensions. For example, in general {{nowrap|''e''<sup>'''A + B'''</sup> ≠ ''e''<sup>'''A'''</sup>''e''<sup>'''B'''</sup>}} in three (or more) dimensions.\n \nThe full geometric algebra in three dimensions, ''C''ℓ<sub>''3''</sub>(ℝ), has basis (1, '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>31</sub>, '''e'''<sub>12</sub>, '''e'''<sub>123</sub>). The element '''e'''<sub>123</sub> is a trivector and the [[pseudoscalar]] for the geometry. Bivectors in three dimensions are sometimes identified with [[pseudovector]]s<ref name=Baylis>\n\n{{cite book |author=William E Baylis |title=Theoretical methods in the physical sciences: an introduction to problem solving using Maple V |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pEfMq1sxWVEC&pg=PA234 |page=234, see footnote |isbn=978-0-8176-3715-6 |year=1994 |quote=The terms ''axial vector'' and  ''pseudovector'' are often treated as synonymous, but it is quite useful to be able to distinguish a bivector (...the pseudovector) from its dual (...the axial vector). |publisher=Birkhäuser}}\n\n</ref> to which they are related, as [[#Axial vectors|discussed below]].\n\n===Quaternions===\nBivectors are not closed under the geometric product, but the even subalgebra is. In three dimensions it consists of all scalar and bivector elements of the geometric algebra, so a general element can be written for example ''a'' + '''A''', where ''a'' is the scalar part and '''A''' is the bivector part. It is written {{SubSup|''C''ℓ|3|+}} and has basis (1, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>31</sub>, '''e'''<sub>12</sub>). The product of two general elements of the even subalgebra is\n\n: <math>(a + \\mathbf{A})(b + \\mathbf{B}) = ab + a\\mathbf{B} + b\\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nThe even subalgebra, that is the algebra consisting of scalars and bivectors, is [[isomorphic]] to the [[quaternion]]s, ℍ. This can be seen by comparing the basis to the quaternion basis, or from the above product which is identical to the quaternion product, except for a change of sign which relates to the negative products in the bivector interior product {{nowrap|'''A''' · '''B'''}}. Other quaternion properties can be similarly related to or derived from geometric algebra.\n\nThis suggests that the usual split of a quaternion into scalar and vector parts would be better represented as a split into scalar and bivector parts; if this is done the quaternion product is merely the geometric product. It also relates quaternions in three dimensions to complex numbers in two, as each is isomorphic to the even subalgebra for the dimension, a relationship that generalises to higher dimensions.\n\n===Rotation vector===\nThe rotation vector, from the [[axis-angle]] representation of rotations, is a compact way of representing rotations in three dimensions. In its most compact form, it consists of a vector, the product of a [[unit vector]] ''ω'' that is the [[axis of rotation]] with the (signed) [[angle]] of rotation ''θ'', so that the magnitude of the overall rotation vector ''θω'' equals the (unsigned) rotation angle.\n\nThe quaternion associated with the rotation is\n\n:<math>q = \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right),  \\omega \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)</math>\n\nIn geometric algebra the rotation is represented by a bivector. This can be seen in its relation to quaternions.  Let ''Ω'' be a unit bivector in the plane of rotation, and let ''θ'' be the [[angle of rotation]].  Then the rotation bivector is ''Ωθ''.   The quaternion closely corresponds to the exponential of half of the bivector ''Ωθ''.  That is, the components of the quaternion correspond to the scalar and bivector parts of the following expression:\n\n<math>e^{\\frac{\\Omega\\theta}{2}} = \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\Omega\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) </math>\n\nThe exponential can be defined in terms of its power series, and easily evaluated using the fact that ''Ω'' squared is -1.\n\nSo rotations can be represented by bivectors.  Just as quaternions are elements of the geometric algebra, they are related by the exponential map in that algebra.\n\n===Rotors===\nThe bivector  '''Ω'''''θ'' generates a rotation through the exponential map. The even elements generated rotate a general vector in three dimensions in the same way as quaternions:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{v}' = e^{\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\theta}{2}}\\mathbf{v}e^{-\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\theta}{2}}.</math>\n\nAs to two dimensions the quantity ''e''<sup>'''Ω'''''θ''</sup> is called a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]] and written ''R''. The quantity ''e''<sup>−'''Ω'''''θ''</sup> is then ''R''<sup>−1</sup>, and they generate rotations as follows\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{v}' = R\\mathbf{v}R^{-1}.\\,</math>\n\nThis is identical to two dimensions, except here rotors are four-dimensional objects isomorphic to the quaternions. This can be generalised to all dimensions, with rotors, elements of the even subalgebra with unit magnitude, being generated by the exponential map from bivectors. They form a [[double covering group|double cover]] over the rotation group, so the rotors ''R'' and −''R'' represent the same rotation.\n\n===Matrices===\nBivectors are isomorphic to [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric matrices]]; the general bivector {{nowrap|''B''<sub>23</sub>'''e'''<sub>23</sub> + ''B''<sub>31</sub>'''e'''<sub>31</sub> + ''B''<sub>12</sub>'''e'''<sub>12</sub>}} maps to the matrix\n\n: <math>M_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & B_{12} &  -B_{31} \\\\ -B_{12} & 0 & B_{23}\\\\ B_{31} & -B_{23} & 0  \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThis multiplied by vectors on both sides gives the same vector as the product of a vector and bivector minus the outerproduct; an example is the [[angular velocity tensor]].\n\nSkew symmetric matrices generate [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with [[determinant]] 1 through the exponential map. In particular the exponent of a bivector associated with a rotation is a [[rotation matrix]], that is the rotation matrix ''M''<sub>R</sub> given by the above skew-symmetric matrix is\n\n:<math>M_R = e^{M_B}.</math>\n\nThe rotation described by ''M''<sub>R</sub> is the same as that described by the rotor ''R'' given by\n\n: <math> R = e^{\\frac{B}{2}},</math>\n\nand the matrix ''M''<sub>R</sub> can be also calculated directly from rotor ''R'':\n\n: <math>M_R = \\begin{pmatrix} (R\\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_1 & (R\\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_1 & (R\\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_1 \\\\ (R\\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_2 & (R\\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_2 & (R\\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_2 \\\\ (R\\mathbf{e}_1R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_3 & (R\\mathbf{e}_2R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_3 & (R\\mathbf{e}_3R^{-1}) \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_3 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nBivectors are related to the [[eigenvalue]]s of a rotation matrix. Given a rotation matrix ''M'' the eigenvalues can calculated by solving the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]] for that matrix {{nowrap|1=0 = det(''M'' − λ''I'')}}. By the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] this has three roots, but only one real root as there is only one eigenvector, the axis of rotation. The other roots must be a complex conjugate pair. They have unit magnitude so purely imaginary logarithms, equal to the magnitude of the bivector associated with the rotation, which is also the angle of rotation. The eigenvectors associated with the complex eigenvalues are in the plane of the bivector, so the exterior product of two non-parallel eigenvectors result in the bivector, or at least a multiple of it.\n\n===Axial vectors===\n[[File:Angular momentum bivector and pseudovector.svg|275px|thumb|The 3-angular momentum as a bivector (plane element) and [[axial vector]], of a particle of mass ''m'' with instantaneous 3-position '''x''' and 3-momentum '''p'''.]]\n\nThe rotation vector is an example of an [[axial vector]]. Axial vectors, or pseudovectors, are vectors with the special feature that their coordinates undergo a sign change relative to the usual vectors (also called \"polar vectors\") under inversion through the origin, reflection in a plane, or other orientation-reversing linear transformation.<ref>In strict mathematical terms, axial vectors are an ''n''-dimensional vector space equipped with the usual structure group GL(''n'','''R'''), but with the nonstandard representation ''A'' → ''A'' det(''A'')/|det(''A'')|.</ref> Examples include quantities like [[torque]], [[angular momentum]] and vector [[magnetic field]]s. Quantities that would use axial vectors in [[vector algebra]] are properly represented by bivectors in geometric algebra.<ref name=Lasenby>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=6uI7bQb6qJ0C&pg=PA56&dq=%22dispensing+with+the+traditional+definition+of+angular+momentum%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=%22dispensing%20with%20the%20traditional%20definition%20of%20angular%20momentum%22&f=false |page=56 |title=Geometric algebra for physicists |author1=Chris Doran |author2=Anthony Lasenby |isbn=978-0-521-48022-2 |year=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}\n</ref>  More precisely, if an underlying orientation is chosen, the axial vectors are naturally identified with the usual vectors; the [[Hodge dual#Three-dimensional example|Hodge dual]] then gives the isomorphism between axial vectors and bivectors, so each axial vector is associated with a bivector and vice versa; that is\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} = * \\mathbf{a} \\,,\\quad \\mathbf{a} = * \\mathbf{A}</math>\nwhere ∗ indicates the Hodge dual. Note that if the underlying orientation is reversed by inversion through the origin, both the identification of the axial vectors with the usual vectors and the Hodge dual change sign, but the bivectors don't budge. Alternately, using the [[Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)#Unit pseudoscalar|unit pseudoscalar]] in ''C''ℓ<sub>3</sub>(ℝ), ''i'' = '''e'''<sub>1</sub>'''e'''<sub>2</sub>'''e'''<sub>3</sub> gives\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{a}i \\,,\\quad \\mathbf{a} = - \\mathbf{A} i. </math>\n\nThis is easier to use as the product is just the geometric product. But it is antisymmetric because (as in two dimensions) the unit pseudoscalar ''i'' squares to −1, so a negative is needed in one of the products.\n\nThis relationship extends to operations like the vector valued [[cross product]] and bivector valued exterior product, as when written as [[determinant]]s they are calculated in the same way:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{a} \\times \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1 & \\mathbf{e}_2 & \\mathbf{e}_3\\\\a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\\\b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\end{vmatrix} \\,,\\quad \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_{23} & \\mathbf{e}_{31} & \\mathbf{e}_{12}\\\\a_1 & a_2 & a_3\\\\b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\end{vmatrix}\\ ,</math>\n\nso are related by the Hodge dual:\n\n:<math>{* (\\mathbf a \\wedge \\mathbf b )} = \\mathbf {a \\times b} \\,,\\quad {* (\\mathbf {a \\times b} )} = \\mathbf a \\wedge \\mathbf b  . </math>\n\nBivectors have a number of advantages over axial vectors. They better disambiguate axial and polar vectors, that is the quantities represented by them, so it is clearer which operations are allowed and what their results are. For example, the inner product of a polar vector and an axial vector resulting from the cross product in the [[triple product]] should result in a [[pseudoscalar]], a result which is more obvious if the calculation is framed as the exterior product of a vector and bivector. They generalises to other dimensions; in particular bivectors can be used to describe quantities like torque and angular momentum in two as well as three dimensions.  Also, they closely match geometric intuition in a number of ways, as seen in the next section.<ref>Lounesto (2001) pp. 37–39</ref>\n\n===Geometric interpretation===\n[[File:Wedge product.JPG|thumb|170px|Parallel plane segments with the same orientation and area corresponding to the same bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}.<ref name=\"Dorst\"/>]]\n\nAs suggested by their name and that of the algebra, one of the attractions of bivectors is that they have a natural geometric interpretation. This can be described in any dimension but is best done in three where parallels can be drawn with more familiar objects, before being applied to higher dimensions. In two dimensions the geometric interpretation is trivial, as the space is two-dimensional so has only one plane, and all bivectors are associated with it differing only by a scale factor.\n\nAll bivectors can be interpreted as [[Plane (geometry)|planes]], or more precisely as directed plane segments. In three dimensions there are three properties of a bivector that can be interpreted geometrically:\n* The arrangement of the plane in space, precisely the [[Attitude (geometry)|attitude]] of the plane (or alternately the [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[Orientation (geometry)|geometric orientation]] or [[gradient]] of the plane), is associated with the ratio of the bivector components. In particular the three basis bivectors, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>31</sub> and '''e'''<sub>12</sub>, or scalar multiples of them, are associated with the ''yz''-plane, ''xz''-plane and ''xy''-plane respectively.\n* The [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of the bivector is associated with the [[area]] of the plane segment. The area does not have a particular shape so any shape can be used. It can even be represented in other ways, such as by an angular measure. But if the vectors are interpreted as lengths the bivector is usually interpreted as an area with the same units, as follows. \n* Like the direction of a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] a plane associated with a bivector has a direction, a circulation or a sense of rotation in the plane, which takes two values seen as [[clockwise and counterclockwise]] when viewed from viewpoint not in the plane. This is associated with a change of sign in the bivector, that is if the direction is reversed the bivector is negated. Alternately if two bivectors have the same attitude and magnitude but opposite directions then one is the negative of the other.\n* If imagined as a 2d parallelogram, with vector's origin at 0, then signed area is the [[Determinant#2.C2.A0.C3.97.C2.A02 matrices|determinant]] of the vectors' Cartesian coordinates (<math>a_x b_y - b_x a_y</math>).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XghF70fqkY WildLinAlg episode 4], Norman J Wildberger, Univ. of New South Wales, 2010, lecture via youtube</ref>\n\n[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|200px|The cross product {{nowrap|'''a''' × '''b'''}} is [[orthogonal]] to the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}}.]]\n\nIn three dimensions all bivectors can be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. If the bivector {{nowrap|1='''B''' = '''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} then the magnitude of '''B''' is\n\n: <math>\\left|\\mathbf{B}\\right| = \\left|\\mathbf{a}\\right|\\left|\\mathbf{b}\\right|\\sin{\\theta},</math>\n\nwhere ''θ'' is the angle between the vectors. This is the area of the [[parallelogram]] with edges '''a''' and '''b''', as shown in the diagram. One interpretation is that the area is swept out by '''b''' as it moves along '''a'''. The exterior product is antisymmetric, so reversing the order of '''a''' and '''b''' to make '''a''' move along '''b''' results in a bivector with the opposite direction that is the negative of the first. The plane of bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} contains both '''a''' and '''b''' so they are both parallel to the plane.\n\nBivectors and axial vectors are related by [[Hodge dual#Three-dimensional example|Hodge dual]]. In a real vector space the Hodge dual relates a subspace to its [[orthogonal complement]], so if a bivector is represented by a plane then the axial vector associated with it is simply the plane's [[surface normal]]. The plane has two normals, one on each side, giving the two possible [[orientation (geometry)|orientation]]s for the plane and bivector.\n\n[[File:Torque animation.gif|thumb|200px|right|Relationship between [[force]] '''F''', torque '''τ''', [[linear momentum]] '''p''', and angular momentum '''L'''.]]\n\nThis relates the [[cross product]] to the [[exterior product]]. It can also be used to represent physical quantities, like [[torque]] and [[angular momentum]]. In vector algebra they are usually represented by vectors, perpendicular to the plane of the [[force]], [[linear momentum]] or displacement that they are calculated from. But if a bivector is used instead the plane is the plane of the bivector, so is a more natural way to represent the quantities and the way they act. It also unlike the vector representation generalises into other dimensions.\n\nThe product of two bivectors has a geometric interpretation. For non-zero bivectors '''A''' and '''B''' the product can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts as follows:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{AB} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nLike vectors these have magnitudes {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''A''' · '''B'''}} = {{abs|'''A'''}}{{abs|'''B'''}} cos ''θ''}} and {{nowrap|1={{abs|'''A''' × '''B'''}} = {{abs|'''A'''}}{{abs|'''B'''}} sin ''θ''}}, where ''θ'' is the angle between the planes. In three dimensions it is the same as the angle between the normal vectors dual to the planes, and it generalises to some extent in higher dimensions.\n\n[[File:Bivector Sum.svg|thumb|200px|Two bivectors, two of the non-parallel sides of a prism, being added to give a third bivector.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 35\"/>]]\n\nBivectors can be added together as areas. Given two non-zero bivectors '''B''' and '''C''' in three dimensions it is always possible to find a vector that is contained in both, '''a''' say, so the bivectors can be written as exterior products involving '''a''':\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\\mathbf{B} &= \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b}\\\\ \\mathbf{C} &= \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{c}\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis can be interpreted geometrically as seen in the diagram: the two areas sum to give a third, with the three areas forming faces of a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]] with '''a''', '''b''', '''c''' and {{nowrap|'''b''' + '''c'''}} as edges. This corresponds to the two ways of calculating the area using the [[distributivity]] of the exterior product:\n\n: <math> \\begin{align} \\mathbf{B} + \\mathbf{C} &= \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{c} \\\\ &= \\mathbf{a} \\wedge (\\mathbf{b} + \\mathbf{c}).\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis only works in three dimensions as it is the only dimension where a vector parallel to both bivectors must exist. In higher dimensions bivectors generally are not associated with a single plane, or if they are (simple bivectors) two bivectors may have no vector in common, and so sum to a non-simple bivector.\n\n==Four dimensions==\nIn four dimensions the basis elements for the space Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>4</sup> of bivectors are ('''e'''<sub>12</sub>, '''e'''<sub>13</sub>, '''e'''<sub>14</sub>, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>24</sub>, '''e'''<sub>34</sub>), so a general bivector is of the form\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A} = a_{12}\\mathbf{e}_{12} + a_{13}\\mathbf{e}_{13} + a_{14}\\mathbf{e}_{14} + a_{23}\\mathbf{e}_{23} + a_{24}\\mathbf{e}_{24} + a_{34}\\mathbf{e}_{34}.</math>\n\n===Orthogonality===\nIn four dimensions the Hodge dual of a bivector is a bivector, and the space Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>4</sup> is dual to itself. Normal vectors are not unique, instead every plane is orthogonal to all the vectors in its Hodge dual space. This can be used to partition the bivectors into two 'halves', in the following way. We have three pairs of orthogonal bivectors: ('''e'''<sub>12</sub>, '''e'''<sub>34</sub>), ('''e'''<sub>13</sub>, '''e'''<sub>24</sub>) and ('''e'''<sub>14</sub>, '''e'''<sub>23</sub>). There are four distinct ways of picking one bivector from each of the first two pairs, and once these first two are picked their sum yields the third bivector from the other pair. For example,  ('''e'''<sub>12</sub>, '''e'''<sub>13</sub>, '''e'''<sub>14</sub>) and ('''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>24</sub>, '''e'''<sub>34</sub>).\n\n===Simple bivectors in 4D===\nIn four dimensions bivectors are generated by the exterior product of vectors in ℝ<sup>4</sup>, but with one important difference from ℝ<sup>3</sup> and ℝ<sup>2</sup>. In four dimensions not all bivectors are simple. There are bivectors such as {{nowrap|'''e'''<sub>12</sub> + '''e'''<sub>34</sub>}} that cannot be generated by the exterior product of two vectors. This also means they do not have a real, that is scalar, square. In this case\n\n: <math>(\\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{34})^2 =\\mathbf{e}_{12} \\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{12} \\mathbf{e}_{34} + \\mathbf{e}_{34} \\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{34} \\mathbf{e}_{34} = -2 + 2 \\mathbf{e}_{1234}.</math>\n\nThe element '''e'''<sub>1234</sub> is the pseudoscalar in ''C''ℓ<sub>4</sub>, distinct from the scalar, so the square is non-scalar.\n\nAll bivectors in four dimensions can be generated using at most two exterior products and four vectors. The above bivector can be written as\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{34} = \\mathbf{e}_{1} \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_{2} +  \\mathbf{e}_{3} \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_{4}.</math>\n\nSimilarly, every bivector can be written as the sum of two simple bivectors. It is useful to choose two orthogonal bivectors for this, and this is always possible to do. Moreover, for a generic bivector the choice of simple bivectors is unique, that is, there is only one way to decompose into orthogonal bivectors; the only exception is when the two orthogonal bivectors have equal magnitudes (as in the above example): in this case the decomposition is not unique.<ref name=\"Lounesto 2001 p. 87\"/> The decomposition is always unique in the case of simple bivectors, with the added bonus that one of the orthogonal parts is zero.\n\n===Rotations in ℝ<sup>4</sup>===\nAs in three dimensions bivectors in four dimension generate rotations through the exponential map, and all rotations can be generated this way. As in three dimensions if '''B''' is a bivector then the rotor ''R'' is ''e''<sup>'''B'''/2</sup> and rotations are generated in the same way:\n\n: <math>v' = RvR^{-1}.\\,</math>\n\n[[File:Tesseract.gif|thumb|200px|A 3D projection of a [[tesseract]] performing an [[SO(4)#Isoclinic rotations|isoclinic rotation]].]]\n\nThe rotations generated are more complex though. They can be categorised as follows:\n: ''[[SO(4)#Simple rotations|simple]]'' rotations are those that fix a plane in 4D, and rotate by an angle \"about\" this plane.\n: ''[[SO(4)#Double rotations|double]]'' rotations have only one fixed point, the origin, and rotate through two angles about two orthogonal planes. In general the angles are different and the planes are uniquely specified\n: ''[[SO(4)#Isoclinic rotations|isoclinic]]'' rotations are double rotations where the angles of rotation are equal. In this case the planes about which the rotation is taking place are not unique.\n\nThese are generated by bivectors in a straightforward way. Simple rotations are generated by simple bivectors, with the fixed plane the dual or orthogonal to the plane of the bivector. The rotation can be said to take place about that plane, in the plane of the bivector. All other bivectors generate double rotations, with the two angles of the rotation equalling the magnitudes of the two simple bivectors the non-simple bivector is composed of. Isoclinic rotations arise when these magnitudes are equal, in which case the decomposition into two simple bivectors is not unique.<ref>Lounesto (2001) pp. 89–90</ref>\n\nBivectors in general do not commute, but one exception is orthogonal bivectors and exponents of them. So if the bivector {{nowrap|'''B''' {{=}} '''B'''<sub>1</sub> + '''B'''<sub>2</sub>}}, where '''B'''<sub>1</sub> and '''B'''<sub>2</sub> are orthogonal simple bivectors, is used to generate a rotation it decomposes into two simple rotations that commute as follows:\n\n: <math> R = e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_1 + \\mathbf{B}_2}{2}} =  e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_1}{2}}e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_2}{2}} = e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_2}{2}}e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}_1}{2}}</math>\n\nIt is always possible to do this as all bivectors can be expressed as sums of orthogonal bivectors.\n\n===Spacetime rotations===\n\n[[Spacetime]] is a mathematical model for our universe used in special relativity. It consists of three [[Euclidean space|space]] dimensions and one [[Time in physics|time]] dimension combined into a single four-dimensional space. It is naturally described using geometric algebra and bivectors, with the [[Euclidean metric]] replaced by a [[Minkowski metric]]. That algebra is identical to that of Euclidean space, except the [[Metric signature|signature]] is changed, so\n\n: <math> {\\mathbf{e}_i}^2 = \\begin{cases} 1,  & i = 1, 2, 3 \\\\  -1, & i = 4 \\end{cases} </math>\n\n(Note the order and indices above are not universal – here '''e'''<sub>4</sub> is the time-like dimension). The geometric algebra is ''C''ℓ<sub>3,1</sub>(ℝ), and the subspace of bivectors is Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>3,1</sup>.\n\nThe simple bivectors are of two types. The simple bivectors '''e'''<sub>23</sub>, '''e'''<sub>31</sub> and '''e'''<sub>12</sub> have negative squares and span the bivectors of the three-dimensional subspace corresponding to Euclidean space, ℝ<sup>3</sup>. These bivectors generate ordinary rotations in ℝ<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe simple bivectors '''e'''<sub>14</sub>, '''e'''<sub>24</sub> and '''e'''<sub>34</sub> have positive squares and as planes span a space dimension and the time dimension. These also generate rotations through the exponential map, but instead of trigonometric functions, hyperbolic functions are needed, which generates a rotor as follows:\n\n: <math>e^{\\frac{\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\theta}{2}} = \\cosh\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) + \\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right), </math>\n\nwhere ''Ω'' is the bivector ('''e'''<sub>14</sub>, etc.), identified via the metric with an antisymmetric linear transformation of ℝ<sup>3,1</sup>. These are [[Lorentz transformation#Boost in any direction|Lorentz boost]]s, expressed in a particularly compact way, using the same kind of algebra as in ℝ<sup>3</sup> and ℝ<sup>4</sup>.\n\nIn general all spacetime rotations are generated from bivectors through the exponential map, that is, a general rotor generated by bivector '''A''' is of the form\n\n: <math>R = e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{A}}{2}}.</math>\n\nThe set of all rotations in spacetime form the [[Lorentz group]], and from them most of the consequences of special relativity can be deduced. More generally this show how transformations in Euclidean space and spacetime can all be described using the same kind of algebra.\n\n===Maxwell's equations===\n(Note: in this section traditional 3-vectors are indicated by lines over the symbols and spacetime vector and bivectors by bold symbols, with the vectors '''J''' and '''A''' exceptionally in uppercase)\n\n[[Maxwell's equations]] are used in physics to describe the relationship between [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields. Normally given as four differential equations they have a particularly compact form when the fields are expressed as a spacetime bivector from Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>3,1</sup>. If the electric and magnetic fields in ℝ<sup>3</sup> are {{overline|''E''}} and {{overline|''B''}} then the ''electromagnetic bivector'' is\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{F} = \\frac{1}{c}\\overline{E}\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\overline{B}\\mathbf{e}_{123},</math>\n\nwhere '''e'''<sub>4</sub> is again the basis vector for the time-like dimension and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. The product {{overline|''B''}}'''e'''<sub>123</sub> yields the bivector that is Hodge dual to {{overline|''B''}} in three dimensions, as [[#Axial vectors|discussed above]], while {{overline|''E''}}'''e'''<sub>4</sub> as a product of orthogonal vectors is also bivector valued. As a whole it is the [[electromagnetic tensor]] expressed more compactly as a bivector, and is used as follows. First it is related to the [[4-current]] '''J''', a vector quantity given by\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{J} = \\overline{j} + c\\rho\\mathbf{e}_4,</math>\n\nwhere {{overline|''j''}} is [[current density]] and ''ρ'' is [[charge density]]. They are related by a differential operator ∂, which is\n\n: <math>\\partial = \\nabla - \\mathbf{e}_4\\frac{1}{c}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}.</math>\n\nThe operator ∇ is a [[differential operator]] in geometric algebra, acting on the space dimensions and given by {{nowrap|∇'''M''' {{=}} ∇·'''M''' + ∇∧'''M'''}}. When applied to vectors ∇·'''M''' is the [[divergence]] and ∇∧'''M''' is the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] but with a bivector rather than vector result, that is dual in three dimensions to the curl. For general quantity '''M''' they act as grade lowering and raising differential operators. In particular if '''M''' is a scalar then this operator is just the [[gradient]], and it can be thought of as a geometric algebraic [[del]] operator.\n\nTogether these can be used to give a particularly compact form for Maxwell's equations in a vacuum:\n\n: <math> \\partial\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{J}.</math>\n\nThis when decomposed according to geometric algebra, using geometric products which have both grade raising and grade lowering effects, is equivalent to Maxwell's four equations. This is the form in a vacuum, but the general form is only a little more complex. It is also related to the [[electromagnetic four-potential]], a vector '''A''' given by\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{A} = \\overline{A} + \\frac{1}{c}V\\mathbf{e}_4,</math>\n\nwhere {{overline|''A''}} is the vector magnetic potential and ''V'' is the electric potential. It is related to the electromagnetic bivector as follows\n\n: <math> \\partial\\mathbf{A} = -\\mathbf{F},</math>\n\nusing the same differential operator ∂.<ref>Lounesto (2001) pp. 109–110</ref>\n\n==Higher dimensions==\nAs has been suggested in earlier sections much of geometric algebra generalises well into higher dimensions. The geometric algebra for the real space ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> is ''C''ℓ<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ), and the subspace of bivectors is Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nThe number of simple bivectors needed to form a general bivector rises with the dimension, so for ''n'' odd it is {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1) / 2}}, for ''n'' even it is {{nowrap|''n'' / 2}}. So for four and [[five-dimensional space|five]] dimensions only two simple bivectors are needed but three are required for [[six-dimensional space|six]] and [[seven-dimensional space|seven]] dimensions. For example, in six dimensions with standard basis ('''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, '''e'''<sub>3</sub>, '''e'''<sub>4</sub>, '''e'''<sub>5</sub>, '''e'''<sub>6</sub>) the bivector\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{e}_{12} + \\mathbf{e}_{34} + \\mathbf{e}_{56} </math>\n\nis the sum of three simple bivectors but no less. As in four dimensions it is always possible to find orthogonal simple bivectors for this sum.\n\n===Rotations in higher dimensions===\nAs in three and four dimensions rotors are generated by the exponential map, so\n\n: <math>e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{2}}</math>\n\nis the rotor generated by bivector '''B'''. Simple rotations, that take place in a [[plane of rotation]] around a fixed [[blade (geometry)|blade]] of dimension {{nowrap|(''n'' − 2)}} are generated by simple bivectors, while other bivectors generate more complex rotations which can be described in terms of the simple bivectors they are sums of, each related to a plane of rotation. All bivectors can be expressed as the sum of orthogonal and commutative simple bivectors, so rotations can always be decomposed into a set of commutative rotations about the planes associated with these bivectors. The group of the rotors in ''n'' dimensions is the [[spin group]], Spin(''n'').\n\nOne notable feature, related to the number of simple bivectors and so rotation planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a fixed axis – it is misleading to call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p.222</ref>\n\nBivectors are also related to the rotation matrix in ''n'' dimensions. As in three dimensions the [[Characteristic polynomial#Characteristic equation|characteristic equation]] of the matrix can be solved to find the [[eigenvalues]]. In odd dimensions this has one real root, with eigenvector the fixed axis, and in even dimensions it has no real roots, so either all or all but one of the roots are complex conjugate pairs. Each pair is associated with a simple component of the bivector associated with the rotation. In particular the log of each pair is ± the magnitude, while eigenvectors generated from the roots are parallel to and so can be used to generate the bivector. In general the eigenvalues and bivectors are unique, and the set of eigenvalues gives the full decomposition into simple bivectors; if roots are repeated then the decomposition of the bivector into simple bivectors is not unique.\n\n==Projective geometry==\nGeometric algebra can be applied to [[projective geometry]] in a straightforward way. The geometric algebra used is {{nowrap|''C''ℓ<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ), ''n'' ≥ 3}}, the algebra of the real vector space ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>. This is used to describe objects in the [[real projective space]] ℝℙ<sup>''n − 1''</sup>. The non-zero vectors in ''C''ℓ<sub>''n''</sub>(ℝ) or ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> are associated with points in the projective space so vectors that differ only by a scale factor, so their exterior product is zero, map to the same point. Non-zero simple bivectors in Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> represent lines in ℝℙ<sup>''n − 1''</sup>, with bivectors differing only by a (positive or negative) scale factor representing the same line.\n\nA description of the projective geometry can be constructed in the geometric algebra using basic operations. For example, given two distinct points in ℝℙ<sup>''n − 1''</sup> represented by vectors '''a''' and '''b''' the line between them is given by {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} (or {{nowrap|'''b''' ∧ '''a'''}}). Two lines intersect in a point if {{nowrap|'''A''' ∧ '''B''' {{=}} 0}} for their bivectors '''A''' and '''B'''. This point is given by the vector\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{A} \\lor \\mathbf{B} = (\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}) J^{-1}.</math>\n\nThe operation \"⋁\" is the meet, which can be defined as above in terms of the join, {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} '''A''' ∧ '''B'''}} {{clarify|If J = A ∧ B = 0, you can't invert it!|date=January 2016}} for non-zero {{nowrap|'''A''' ∧ '''B'''}}. Using these operations projective geometry can be formulated in terms of geometric algebra. For example, given a third (non-zero) bivector '''C''' the point '''p''' lies on the line given by '''C''' if and only if\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{p} \\land \\mathbf{C} = 0. </math>\n\nSo the condition for the lines given by '''A''', '''B''' and '''C''' to be collinear is\n\n: <math> (\\mathbf{A} \\lor \\mathbf{B}) \\land \\mathbf{C} = 0, </math>\n\nwhich in ''C''ℓ<sub>3</sub>(ℝ) and ℝℙ<sup>2</sup> simplifies to\n\n: <math> \\langle \\mathbf{ABC} \\rangle = 0,</math>\n\nwhere the angle brackets denote the scalar part of the geometric product. In the same way all projective space operations can be written in terms of geometric algebra, with bivectors representing general lines in projective space, so the whole geometry can be developed using geometric algebra.<ref name = \"HestenesPG\" />\n\n===Tensors and matrices===\nAs [[#Matrices|noted above]] a bivector can be written as a skew-symmetric matrix, which through the exponential map generates a rotation matrix that describes the same rotation as the rotor, also generated by the exponential map but applied to the vector. But it is also used with other bivectors such as the [[angular velocity tensor]] and the [[electromagnetic tensor]], respectively a 3×3 and 4×4 skew-symmetric matrix or tensor.\n\nReal bivectors in Λ<sup>2</sup>ℝ<sup>''n''</sup> are isomorphic to ''n''×''n'' skew-symmetric matrices, or alternately to antisymmetric [[tensor]]s of order 2 on ℝ<sup>''n''</sup>. While bivectors are isomorphic to vectors (via the dual) in three dimensions they can be represented by skew-symmetric matrices in any dimension. This is useful for relating bivectors to problems described by matrices, so they can be re-cast in terms of bivectors, given a geometric interpretation, then often solved more easily or related geometrically to other bivector problems.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 193</ref>\n\nMore generally every real geometric algebra is [[Classification of Clifford algebras#Classification|isomorphic to a matrix algebra]]. These contain bivectors as a subspace, though often in a way which is not especially useful. These matrices are mainly of interest as a way of classifying Clifford algebras.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 217</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|bivector}}\n*[[p-vector]]\n*[[Multilinear algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==General references==\n*{{cite book |title=Geometric Algebra for Computer Science: An Object-Oriented Approach to Geometry |chapter=§ 2.3.3 Visualizing bivectors |page= 31 ''ff'' |author1=Leo Dorst |author2=Daniel Fontijne |author3=Stephen Mann |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-1-zRTeCXwgC&pg=PA31 |isbn=978-0-12-374942-0 |year=2009 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |edition=2nd}}\n* {{cite book\n| last=Whitney\n| first=Hassler\n| title=Geometric Integration Theory\n| publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]\n| location=Princeton\n| isbn=978-0-486-44583-0\n| year=1957}}\n\n* {{cite book\n| last=Lounesto\n| first=Pertti\n| title=Clifford algebras and spinors\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsybQWDK4oC\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| location=Cambridge\n| isbn=978-0-521-00551-7\n| year=2001}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|author1=Chris Doran  |author2=Anthony Lasenby\n |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Geometric Algebra for Physicists\n| chapter=§ 1.6 The outer product\n| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ6MsVIdt88C&pg=PA11\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| page=11 ''et seq''\n| location=Cambridge \n| isbn=978-0-521-71595-9\n| year=2003\n}}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n[[Category:Clifford algebras|*]]\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]\n[[Category:Multilinear algebra]]\n[[Category:Vector calculus]]\n[[Category:Tensors]]"

As [[algebra over a field|''K''-algebras]], they generalize the [[real number]]s, [[complex number]]s, [[quaternion]]s and several other [[hypercomplex number]] systems.<ref>W. K. Clifford, \"Preliminary sketch of bi-quaternions, Proc. London Math. Soc. Vol. 4 (1873) pp. 381–395</ref><ref>W. K. Clifford, ''Mathematical Papers'', (ed. R. Tucker), London: Macmillan, 1882.</ref> The theory of Clifford algebras is intimately connected with the theory of [[quadratic form]]s and [[orthogonal group|orthogonal transformation]]s. Clifford algebras have important applications in a variety of fields including [[geometry]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[digital image processing]]. They are named after the English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford]].\n\nThe most familiar Clifford algebras, the '''orthogonal Clifford algebras''', are also referred to as ''(pseudo-)Riemannian Clifford algebras'', as distinct from ''symplectic Clifford algebras''.<ref name=oziewicz-sitarczyk>see for ex. Z. Oziewicz, Sz. Sitarczyk: ''Parallel treatment of Riemannian and symplectic Clifford algebras''. In: Artibano Micali, Roger Boudet, Jacques Helmstetter (eds.): ''Clifford Algebras and their Applications in Mathematical Physics'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|0-7923-1623-1}}, 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FhU9QpPIscoC&pg=PA83 p. 83]</ref>\n\n==Introduction and basic properties==\nA Clifford algebra is a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] that contains and is generated by a [[vector space]] ''V'' over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', where ''V'' is equipped with a [[quadratic form]] {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K''}}. The Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is the [[free algebra|\"freest\" algebra]] generated by ''V'' subject to the condition<ref>Mathematicians who work with real Clifford algebras and prefer positive definite quadratic forms (especially those working in [[index theory]]) sometimes use a different [[sign convention|choice of sign]] in the fundamental Clifford identity. That is, they take {{nowrap|1=''v''<sup>2</sup> = −''Q''(''v'').}} One must replace ''Q'' with −''Q'' in going from one convention to the other.</ref>\n:<math>v^2 = Q(v)1\\ \\text{ for all } v\\in V,</math>\nwhere the product on the left is that of the algebra, and the 1 is its [[multiplicative identity]].  The idea of being the \"freest\" or \"most general\" algebra subject to this identity can be formally expressed through the notion of a [[universal property]], as done [[#Universal property and construction|below]].\n\nThe free algebra generated by ''V'' may be written as the [[tensor algebra]] {{nowrap|{{resize|140%|⊕}}<sub>''n''≥0</sub> ''V'' ⊗ ... ⊗ ''V''}}, that is, the sum of the [[tensor product]] of ''n'' copies of ''V'' over all ''n'', and so a Clifford algebra would be the [[Quotient ring|quotient]] of this tensor algebra by the two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by elements of the form {{nowrap|''v'' ⊗ ''v'' − ''Q''(''v'')1}} for all elements {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}. The product induced by the tensor product in the quotient algebra is written using juxtaposition (e.g. ''uv'').  Its associativity follows from the associativity of the tensor product.\n\nThe Clifford algebra has a distinguished subspace ''V''.<ref>{{cite |author=P. Lounesto |title= Counterexamples in Clifford algebras with CLICAL |pages=3–30 |journal=Clifford Algebras with Numeric and Symbolic Computations| year=1996 }} or [https://users.aalto.fi/~ppuska/mirror/Lounesto/counterexamples.htm abridged version]</ref> Such a subspace cannot in general be uniquely determined given only a ''K''-algebra isomorphic to the Clifford algebra.\n\nIf the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the ground field ''K'' is not 2, then one can rewrite this fundamental identity in the form\n:<math>uv + vu = 2\\langle u, v\\rangle1\\ \\text{ for all }u,v \\in V,</math>\nwhere\n:<math> \\langle u , v \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( Q(u+v) - Q(u) - Q(v) \\right) </math>\nis the [[symmetric bilinear form]] associated with ''Q'', via the [[polarization identity]].\n\nQuadratic forms and Clifford algebras in [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 2 form an exceptional case. In particular, if {{nowrap|1=char(''K'') = 2}} it is not true that a quadratic form uniquely determines a symmetric bilinear form satisfying {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''v'') = {{langle}}''v'', ''v''{{rangle}}}}, nor that every quadratic form admits an orthogonal basis. Many of the statements in this article include the condition that the characteristic is not 2, and are false if this condition is removed.\n\n===As a quantization of the exterior algebra===\nClifford algebras are closely related to [[exterior algebra]]s. Indeed, if {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = 0}} then the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is just the exterior algebra ⋀(''V''). For nonzero ''Q'' there exists a canonical ''linear'' isomorphism between ⋀(''V'') and {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} whenever the ground field ''K'' does not have characteristic two. That is, they are [[naturally isomorphic]] as vector spaces, but with different multiplications (in the case of characteristic two, they are still isomorphic as vector spaces, just not naturally). Clifford multiplication together with the distinguished subspace is strictly richer than the [[exterior product]] since it makes use of the extra information provided by ''Q''.\n\nThe Clifford algebra is a [[filtered algebra]], the [[associated graded algebra]] is the exterior algebra.\n\nMore precisely, Clifford algebras may be thought of as ''quantizations'' (cf. [[Quantum group]]) of the exterior algebra, in the same way that the [[Weyl algebra]] is a quantization of the [[symmetric algebra]].\n\nWeyl algebras and Clifford algebras admit a further structure of a [[*-algebra]], and can be unified as even and odd terms of a [[superalgebra]], as discussed in [[CCR and CAR algebras]].\n\n==Universal property and construction==\nLet ''V'' be a [[vector space]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K'', and let {{nowrap|''Q'' : ''V'' → ''K''}} be a [[quadratic form]] on ''V''.  In most cases of interest the field ''K'' is either the field of [[real number]]s '''R''', or the field of [[complex number]]s '''C''', or a [[finite field]].\n\nA Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a [[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra]] over ''K'' together with a [[linear transformation|linear map]] {{nowrap|''i'' : ''V'' → Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}{{refn|{{harv|Vaz|da Rocha|2016}} make it clear that the map ''i'' (''γ'' in this quote) is included in the structure of a Clifford algebra by defining it as \"The pair {{nowrap|(''A'', ''γ'')}} is a Clifford algebra for the quadratic space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''g'')}} when ''A'' is generated as an algebra by {{nowrap|{''γ''('''v''') {{!}} '''v''' ∈ ''V''} }} and {{nowrap|{''a''1{{sub|''A''}} {{!}} ''a'' ∈ '''R'''},}} and ''γ'' satisfies {{nowrap|1=''γ''('''v''')''γ''('''u''') + ''γ''('''u''')''γ''('''v''') = 2''g''('''v''', '''u''')}} for all {{nowrap|'''v''', '''u''' ∈ ''V''}}.\"}} satisfying {{nowrap|''i''(''v'')<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''Q''(''v'')1}} for all {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, defined by the following [[universal property]]: given any unital associative algebra ''A'' over ''K'' and any linear map {{nowrap|''j'' : ''V'' →  ''A''}} such that\n\n:<math>j(v)^2 = Q(v)1_A \\text{ for all } v \\in V</math>\n\n(where 1<sub>''A''</sub> denotes the multiplicative identity of ''A''), there is a unique [[algebra homomorphism]] {{nowrap|''f'' : Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'') → ''A''}} such that the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]] (i.e. such that {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''i'' {{=}} ''j''}}):\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Image:CliffordAlgebra-01.png]]</div>\n\nIn characteristic not 2, the quadratic form ''Q'' may be replaced by a symmetric [[bilinear form]] <math>\\langle {\\cdot}, {\\cdot} \\rangle</math>, in which case an equivalent requirement on ''j'' is\n\n:<math> j(v)j(w) + j(w)j(v) = 2 \\langle v, w \\rangle 1_A \\quad \\text{ for all } v,w \\in V \\ . </math>\n<!-- :''j''(''v'')''j''(''w'') + ''j''(''w'')''j''(''v'') = 2<''v'', ''w''>1<sub>''A''</sub> for all {{nowrap|''v'', ''w'' ∈ ''V''.}} -->\n\nA Clifford algebra as described above always exists and can be constructed as follows: start with the most general algebra that contains ''V'', namely the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V''), and then enforce the fundamental identity by taking a suitable [[quotient ring|quotient]]. In our case we want to take the [[ideal (ring theory)|two-sided ideal]] ''I<sub>Q</sub>'' in ''T''(''V'') generated by all elements of the form\n\n:<math>v\\otimes v - Q(v)1</math> for all <math>v\\in V</math>\n\nand define {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} as the quotient algebra\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}(V, Q) = T(V) / I_Q .</math>\n\nThe ring product inherited by this quotient is sometimes referred to as the '''Clifford product'''{{sfn|Lounesto|2001|loc=§1.8}} to distinguish it from the exterior product and the scalar product.\n\nIt is then straightforward to show that {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} contains ''V'' and satisfies the above universal property, so that Cℓ is unique up to a unique isomorphism; thus one speaks of \"the\" Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}. It also follows from this construction that ''i'' is [[injective function|injective]]. One usually drops the ''i'' and considers ''V'' as a [[linear subspace]] of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}.\n\nThe universal characterization of the Clifford algebra shows that the construction of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is ''functorial'' in nature. Namely, Cℓ can be considered as a [[functor]] from the [[category (mathematics)|category]] of vector spaces with quadratic forms (whose [[morphism]]s are linear maps preserving the quadratic form) to the category of associative algebras. The universal property guarantees that linear maps between vector spaces (preserving the quadratic form) extend uniquely to [[algebra homomorphism]]s between the associated Clifford algebras.\n\n==Basis and dimension==\n\nSince ''V'' comes equipped with a quadratic form, in characteristic not 2 there is a set of privileged bases for ''V'': those that are [[orthogonal]]. An [[orthogonal basis]] is one such that\n\n:<math>\\langle e_i, e_j \\rangle = 0 </math> for <math> i\\neq j</math>, and <math>\\langle e_i, e_i \\rangle = Q(e_i)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\langle \\cdot , \\cdot \\rangle </math> is the symmetric bilinear form associated to ''Q''. The fundamental Clifford identity implies that for an orthogonal basis\n\n:<math>e_ie_j = -e_je_i </math> for <math> i\\neq j </math>, and <math> e_i^2= Q(e_i) \\,</math>.\n\nThis makes manipulation of orthogonal basis vectors quite simple. Given a product <math>e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\\cdots e_{i_k}</math> of ''distinct'' orthogonal basis vectors of ''V'', one can put them into a standard order while including an overall sign determined by the number of [[Transposition (mathematics)|pairwise swaps]] needed to do so (i.e. the [[Parity of a permutation|signature]] of the ordering [[permutation]]).\n\n\nIf the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] of ''V'' over ''K'' is ''n'' and {{nowrap|{''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}{{null}}}} is an [[orthogonal basis]] of {{nowrap|(''V'', ''Q'')}}, then {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is free over ''K'' with a basis\n\n:<math>\\{e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\\cdots e_{i_k} \\mid 1\\le i_1 < i_2 < \\cdots < i_k \\le n\\mbox{ and } 0\\le k\\le n\\}</math>.\n\nThe empty product ({{nowrap|1=''k'' = 0}}) is defined as the multiplicative [[identity element]]. For each value of ''k'' there are [[Binomial coefficient|''n'' choose ''k'']] basis elements, so the total dimension of the Clifford algebra is\n\n:<math>\\dim \\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q) = \\sum_{k=0}^n\\begin{pmatrix}n\\\\ k\\end{pmatrix} = 2^n.</math>\n\n==Examples: real and complex Clifford algebras==\nThe most important Clifford algebras are those over [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] vector spaces equipped with [[nondegenerate quadratic form]]s.\n\nEach of the algebras Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}}('''R''') and Cℓ{{sub|''n''}}('''C''') is isomorphic to ''A'' or {{nowrap|''A'' ⊕ ''A''}}, where ''A'' is a [[Matrix ring|full matrix ring]] with entries from '''R''', '''C''', or '''H'''.

The pair of integers {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} is called the [[metric signature|signature]] of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>. The Clifford algebra on '''R'''{{sup|''p'',''q''}} is denoted Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}}('''R''').  The symbol Cℓ{{sub|''n''}}('''R''')  means either Cℓ{{sub|''n'',0}}('''R''') or Cℓ{{sub|0,''n''}}('''R''') depending on whether the author prefers positive-definite or negative-definite spaces.\n\nA standard [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {{nowrap|{''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>} }} for '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> consists of {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''p'' + ''q''}} mutually orthogonal vectors, ''p'' of which square to +1 and ''q'' of which square to −1.

We retrieve Hamilton's quaternions when {{nowrap|1=''a'' = ''b'' = −1}}, since {{nowrap|1='''H''' = (−1, −1)<sub>'''R'''</sub>}}.\n\nAs a special case, if some ''x'' in ''V'' satisfies {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''x'') = 1}}, then {{nowrap|1=Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'') = M<sub>2</sub>(''K'')}}.\n\n==Properties==\n===Relation to the exterior algebra===\nGiven a vector space ''V'' one can construct the [[exterior algebra]] ⋀(''V''), whose definition is independent of any quadratic form on ''V''. It turns out that if ''K'' does not have characteristic 2 then there is a [[natural isomorphism]] between ⋀(''V'') and {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} considered as vector spaces (and there exists an isomorphism in characteristic two, which may not be natural). This is an algebra isomorphism if and only if {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = 0}}. One can thus consider the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} as an enrichment (or more precisely, a quantization, cf. the Introduction) of the exterior algebra on ''V'' with a multiplication that depends on ''Q'' (one can still define the exterior product independently of ''Q'').\n\nThe easiest way to establish the isomorphism is to choose an ''orthogonal'' basis {{nowrap|{''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>} }} for ''V'' and extend it to a basis for {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} as described [[#Basis and dimension|above]]. The map {{nowrap|1=Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'') → ⋀(''V'')}} is determined by\n:<math>e_{i_1}e_{i_2}\\cdots e_{i_k} \\mapsto e_{i_1}\\wedge e_{i_2}\\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_{i_k}.</math>\nNote that this only works if the basis {{nowrap|{''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub>} }} is orthogonal. One can show that this map is independent of the choice of orthogonal basis and so gives a natural isomorphism.\n\nIf the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of ''K'' is 0, one can also establish the isomorphism by antisymmetrizing. Define functions {{nowrap|1=''f<sub>k</sub>'': ''V'' × ... × ''V'' → Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} by\n:<math>f_k(v_1, \\cdots, v_k) = \\frac{1}{k!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in S_k}{\\rm sgn}(\\sigma)\\, v_{\\sigma(1)}\\cdots v_{\\sigma(k)}</math>\nwhere the sum is taken over the [[symmetric group]] on ''k'' elements. Since ''f<sub>k</sub>'' is [[alternating form|alternating]] it induces a unique linear map {{nowrap|1=⋀<sup>''k''</sup>(''V'') → Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}. The [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of these maps gives a linear map between ⋀(''V'') and {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}. This map can be shown to be a linear isomorphism, and it is natural.\n\nA more sophisticated way to view the relationship is to construct a [[filtration (abstract algebra)|filtration]] on {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}. Recall that the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') has a natural filtration: {{nowrap|1=''F''<sup>0</sup> ⊂ ''F''<sup>1</sup> ⊂ ''F''<sup>2</sup> ⊂ ...}}, where ''F<sup>k</sup>'' contains sums of tensors with [[tensor order|order]] {{nowrap|1=≤ ''k''}}. Projecting this down to the Clifford algebra gives a filtration on {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}. The [[associated graded algebra]]\n:<math>Gr_F \\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q) = \\bigoplus_k F^k/F^{k-1}</math>\nis naturally isomorphic to the exterior algebra ⋀(''V'').  Since the associated graded algebra of a filtered algebra is always isomorphic to the filtered algebra as filtered vector spaces (by choosing complements of ''F<sup>k</sup>'' in ''F''<sup>''k''+1</sup> for all ''k''), this provides an isomorphism (although not a natural one) in any characteristic, even two.\n\n===Grading===\nIn the following, assume that the characteristic is not 2.<ref>Thus the [[group algebra]] '''K'''['''Z'''/2] is [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]] and the Clifford algebra splits into eigenspaces of the main involution.</ref>\n\nClifford algebras are '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-[[graded algebra]]s (also known as [[superalgebra]]s).  Indeed, the linear map on ''V'' defined by {{nowrap|''v'' ↦ −''v''}} ([[reflection through the origin]]) preserves the quadratic form ''Q'' and so by the universal property of Clifford algebras extends to an algebra [[automorphism]]\n\n:<math>\\alpha: \\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q) \\to \\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q).</math>\n\nSince ''α'' is an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] (i.e. it squares to the [[identity function|identity]]) one can decompose {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} into positive and negative eigenspaces of ''α''\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q) = \\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[0]}(V,Q) \\oplus \\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[1]}(V,Q)</math>\n\nwhere \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[i]}(V,Q) = \\left.\\left\\{ x \\in \\operatorname{C\\ell}(V,Q) \\right | \\alpha(x) = (-1)^i x \\right \\}.</math>\n\nSince ''α'' is an automorphism it follows that:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[i]}(V,Q)\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[j]}(V,Q) = \\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[i+j]}(V,Q)</math>\n\nwhere the bracketed superscripts are read modulo 2. This gives {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} the structure of a '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-[[graded algebra]].  The subspace {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[0]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} forms a [[subalgebra]] of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}, called the ''even subalgebra''. The subspace {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[1]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} is called the ''odd part'' of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} (it is not a subalgebra).  This '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading plays an important role in the analysis and application of Clifford algebras. The automorphism ''α'' is called the ''main [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]'' or ''grade involution''. Elements that are pure in this '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading are simply said to be even or odd.\n\n''Remark''. In characteristic not 2 the underlying vector space of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} inherits an '''N'''-grading and a '''Z'''-grading from the canonical isomorphism with the underlying vector space of the exterior algebra ⋀(''V'').<ref>The '''Z'''-grading is obtained from the '''N''' grading by appending copies of the zero subspace indexed with the negative integers.</ref> It is important to note, however, that this is a ''vector space grading only''. That is, Clifford multiplication does not respect the '''N'''-grading or '''Z'''-grading, only the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading: for instance if {{nowrap|1=''Q''(''v'') ≠ 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=''v'' ∈ Cℓ{{sup|1}}(''V'', ''Q'')}}, but {{nowrap|1=''v''{{sup|2}} ∈ Cℓ{{sup|0}}(''V'', ''Q'')}}, not in {{nowrap|1=Cℓ{{sup|2}}(''V'', ''Q'')}}. Happily, the gradings are related in the natural way: {{nowrap|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub> ≅ '''N'''/2'''N''' ≅ '''Z'''/2'''Z'''}}. Further, the Clifford algebra is '''Z'''-[[filtered algebra|filtered]]: \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{\\leqslant i}(V,Q) \\cdot \\operatorname{C\\ell}^{\\leqslant j}(V,Q) \\subset \\operatorname{C\\ell}^{\\leqslant i+j}(V,Q).</math>\n\nThe ''degree'' of a Clifford number usually refers to the degree in the '''N'''-grading.\n\nThe even subalgebra {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[0]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} of a Clifford algebra is itself isomorphic to a Clifford algebra.<ref>Technically, it does not have the full structure of a Clifford algebra without a designated vector subspace, and so is isomorphic as an algebra, but not as a Clifford algebra.</ref><ref>We are still assuming that the characteristic is not 2.</ref> If ''V'' is the [[orthogonal direct sum]] of a vector ''a'' of nonzero norm ''Q''(''a'') and a subspace ''U'', then {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[0]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} is isomorphic to {{nowrap|Cℓ(''U'', −''Q''(''a'')''Q'')}}, where −''Q''(''a'')''Q'' is the form ''Q'' restricted to ''U'' and multiplied by −''Q''(''a''). In particular over the reals this implies that:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}^{[0]}(\\mathbf{R}) \\cong \\begin{cases} \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q-1}(\\mathbf{R}) & q > 0 \\\\ \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{q,p-1}(\\mathbf{R}) & p > 0 \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIn the negative-definite case this gives an inclusion {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sub|0,''n''−1}}('''R''') ⊂ Cℓ{{sub|0,''n''}}('''R''')}}, which extends the sequence\n\n:'''R''' ⊂ '''C''' ⊂ '''H''' ⊂ '''H''' ⊕ '''H''' ⊂ ...\n\nLikewise, in the complex case, one can show that the even subalgebra of Cℓ{{sub|''n''}}('''C''') is isomorphic to Cℓ{{sub|''n''−1}}('''C''').\n\n===Antiautomorphisms===\nIn addition to the automorphism ''α'', there are two [[antiautomorphism]]s that play an important role in the analysis of Clifford algebras. Recall that the [[tensor algebra]] ''T''(''V'') comes with an antiautomorphism that reverses the order in all products of vectors:\n:<math>v_1\\otimes v_2\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes v_k \\mapsto v_k\\otimes \\cdots \\otimes v_2\\otimes v_1.</math>\nSince the ideal ''I''<sub>''Q''</sub> is invariant under this reversal, this operation descends to an antiautomorphism of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} called the ''[[Transposition (mathematics)|transpose]]'' or ''reversal'' operation, denoted by ''x''<sup>t</sup>. The transpose is an antiautomorphism: {{nowrap|1=(''xy'')<sup>t</sup> = ''y''<sup>t</sup> ''x''<sup>t</sup>}}. The transpose operation makes no use of the '''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-grading so we define a second antiautomorphism by composing ''α'' and the transpose. We call this operation ''Clifford conjugation'' denoted <math>\\bar x</math>\n:<math>\\bar x = \\alpha(x^\\mathrm{t}) = \\alpha(x)^\\mathrm{t}.</math>\nOf the two antiautomorphisms, the transpose is the more fundamental.<ref>The opposite is true when using the alternate (−) sign convention for Clifford algebras: it is the conjugate which is more important. In general, the meanings of conjugation and transpose are interchanged when passing from one sign convention to the other. For example, in the convention used here the inverse of a vector is given by {{math|1=''v''<sup>−1</sup> = ''v''<sup>t</sup> / ''Q''(''v'')}} while in the (−) convention it is given by {{math|1=''v''<sup>−1</sup> = {{overline|''v''}} / ''Q''(''v'')}}.</ref>\n\nNote that all of these operations are [[involution (mathematics)|involutions]]. One can show that they act as ±1 on elements which are pure in the '''Z'''-grading. In fact, all three operations depend only on the degree modulo 4. That is, if ''x'' is pure with degree ''k'' then\n:<math>\\alpha(x) = \\pm x \\qquad x^\\mathrm{t} = \\pm x \\qquad \\bar x = \\pm x</math>\nwhere the signs are given by the following table:\n{| class=wikitable\n! ''k'' mod 4 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 ||\n|-\n| <math>\\alpha(x)\\,</math> || + || − || + || − || (−1)<sup>''k''</sup>\n|-\n| <math>x^\\mathrm{t}\\,</math> || + || + || − || − || (−1)<sup>''k''(''k''−1)/2</sup>\n|-\n| <math>\\bar x</math> || + || − || − || + || (−1)<sup>''k''(''k''+1)/2</sup>\n|}\n\n===Clifford scalar product===\nWhen the characteristic is not 2, the quadratic form ''Q'' on ''V'' can be extended to a quadratic form on all of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} (which we also denoted by ''Q''). A basis independent definition of one such extension is\n:<math>Q(x) = \\langle x^\\mathrm{t} x\\rangle</math>\nwhere ⟨''a''⟩ denotes the scalar part of ''a'' (the degree 0 part in the '''Z'''-grading). One can show that\n:<math>Q(v_1v_2\\cdots v_k) = Q(v_1)Q(v_2)\\cdots Q(v_k)</math>\nwhere the ''v<sub>i</sub>'' are elements of ''V'' – this identity is ''not'' true for arbitrary elements of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}}.\n\nThe associated symmetric bilinear form on {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is given by\n:<math>\\langle x, y\\rangle = \\langle x^\\mathrm{t} y\\rangle.</math>\nOne can check that this reduces to the original bilinear form when restricted to ''V''. The bilinear form on all of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]] if and only if it is nondegenerate on ''V''.\n\nIt is not hard to verify that the operator of left/right Clifford multiplication by the transpose <math>a^\\mathrm{t}</math> of an element <math>a</math> is the [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]] of left/right Clifford multiplication by <math>a</math> itself with respect to this inner product. That is,\n:<math>\\langle ax, y\\rangle = \\langle x, a^\\mathrm{t} y\\rangle,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\langle xa, y\\rangle = \\langle x, y a^\\mathrm{t}\\rangle.</math>\n\n==Structure of Clifford algebras==\nIn this section we assume that characteristic is not 2, the vector space ''V'' is finite-dimensional and that the associated symmetric bilinear form of ''Q'' is non-singular. A [[central simple algebra]] over ''K'' is a matrix algebra over a (finite-dimensional) division algebra with center ''K''. For example, the central simple algebras over the reals are matrix algebras over either the reals or the quaternions.\n\n*If ''V'' has even dimension then {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a central simple algebra over ''K''.\n*If ''V'' has even dimension then {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[0]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of ''K'' or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over ''K''.\n*If ''V'' has odd dimension then {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a central simple algebra over a quadratic extension of ''K'' or a sum of two isomorphic central simple algebras over ''K''.\n*If ''V'' has odd dimension then {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sup|[0]}}(''V'', ''Q'')}} is a central simple algebra over ''K''.\n\nThe structure of Clifford algebras can be worked out explicitly using the following result. Suppose that ''U'' has even dimension and a non-singular bilinear form with [[discriminant]] ''d'', and suppose that ''V'' is another vector space with a quadratic form. The Clifford algebra of {{nowrap|''U'' + ''V''}} is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Clifford algebras of ''U'' and (−1)<sup>dim(''U'')/2</sup>''dV'', which is the space ''V'' with its quadratic form multiplied by (−1)<sup>dim(''U'')/2</sup>''d''. Over the reals, this implies in particular that\n:<math> \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p+2,q}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathrm{M}_2(\\mathbf{R})\\otimes \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{q,p}(\\mathbf{R}) </math>\n:<math> \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p+1,q+1}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathrm{M}_2(\\mathbf{R})\\otimes \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}(\\mathbf{R}) </math>\n:<math> \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q+2}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{H}\\otimes \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{q,p}(\\mathbf{R}). </math>\nThese formulas can be used to find the structure of all real Clifford algebras and all complex Clifford algebras;  see the [[classification of Clifford algebras]].\n\nNotably, the [[Morita equivalence]] class of a Clifford algebra (its representation theory: the equivalence class of the category of modules over it) depends only on the signature {{nowrap|1=(''p'' − ''q'') mod 8}}. This is an algebraic form of [[Bott periodicity]].\n\n==Clifford group==\nThe class of Clifford groups ({{aka}} Clifford–Lipschitz groups{{sfn|Vaz|da Rocha|2016|loc=p. 126}}) was discovered by [[Rudolf Lipschitz]].{{sfn|Lounesto|2001|loc=§17.2}}\n\nIn this section we assume that ''V'' is finite-dimensional and the quadratic form ''Q'' is [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]].\n\nAn action on the elements of a Clifford algebra by its [[group of units]] may be defined in terms of a twisted conjugation: twisted conjugation by ''x'' maps {{nowrap|''y'' ↦ ''x y α''(''x'')<sup>−1</sup>}}, where ''α'' is the ''main involution'' defined [[#Grading|above]].\n\nThe Clifford group Γ is defined to be the set of invertible elements ''x'' that ''stabilize the set of vectors'' under this action,<ref>{{citation |year=2009 |last=Perwass |first=Christian |title=Geometric Algebra with Applications in Engineering |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-89068-3 }}, §3.3.1</ref> meaning that for all  ''v'' in ''V'' we have:\n:<math>\\alpha(x) v x^{-1}\\in V .</math>\n\nThis formula also defines an action of the Clifford group on the vector space ''V'' that preserves the quadratic form ''Q'', and so gives a homomorphism from the Clifford group to the orthogonal group.  The Clifford group contains all elements ''r'' of ''V'' for which ''Q''(''r'') is invertible in ''K'', and these act on ''V'' by the corresponding reflections that take ''v'' to {{nowrap|''v'' − ''2''⟨''v'',''r''⟩''r''/''Q''(''r'')}}.  (In characteristic 2 these are called orthogonal transvections rather than reflections.)\n\nIf ''V'' is a finite-dimensional real vector space with a [[degenerate form|non-degenerate]] quadratic form then the Clifford group maps onto the orthogonal group of ''V'' with respect to the form (by the [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]]) and the kernel consists of the nonzero elements of the field ''K''. This leads to exact sequences\n:<math> 1 \\rightarrow K^* \\rightarrow \\Gamma \\rightarrow \\mbox{O}_V(K) \\rightarrow 1,\\,</math>\n:<math> 1 \\rightarrow K^* \\rightarrow \\Gamma^0 \\rightarrow \\mbox{SO}_V(K) \\rightarrow 1.\\,</math>\n\nOver other fields or with indefinite forms, the map is not in general onto, and the failure is captured by the spinor norm.\n\n===Spinor norm===\n{{details|Spinor norm#Galois cohomology and orthogonal groups}}\n\nIn arbitrary characteristic, the [[Orthogonal group#The spinor norm|spinor norm]] ''Q'' is defined on the Clifford group by\n:<math>Q(x) = x^\\mathrm{t}x.</math>\n<!-- Note that (−1)^D(x) is the same as \\alpha(x), so this expression is the same\nas \\alpha(x)^t x (−1)^D(x). -->\nIt is a homomorphism from the Clifford group to the group ''K''<sup>×</sup> of non-zero elements of ''K''. It coincides with the quadratic form ''Q'' of ''V'' when ''V'' is identified with a subspace of the Clifford algebra. Several authors define the spinor norm slightly differently, so that it differs from the one here by a factor of −1, 2, or −2 on Γ<sup>1</sup>. The difference is not very important in characteristic other than 2.\n\nThe nonzero elements of ''K'' have spinor norm in the group (''K''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup> of squares of nonzero elements of the field ''K''. So when ''V'' is finite-dimensional and non-singular we get an induced map from the orthogonal group of ''V'' to the group ''K''<sup>×</sup>/(''K''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>, also called the spinor norm. The spinor norm of the reflection about ''r''<sup>⊥</sup>, for any vector ''r'', has image ''Q''(''r'') in ''K''<sup>×</sup>/(''K''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>, and this property uniquely defines it on the orthogonal group. This gives exact sequences:\n\n:<math> 1 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\to \\mbox{Pin}_V(K)  \\to \\mbox{O}_V(K)  \\to K^{\\times}/(K^{\\times})^2,</math>\n:<math> 1 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\to \\mbox{Spin}_V(K) \\to \\mbox{SO}_V(K) \\to K^{\\times}/(K^{\\times})^2.</math>\n\nNote that in characteristic 2 the group {±1} has just one element.\n\nFrom the point of view of [[Galois cohomology]] of [[algebraic group]]s, the spinor norm is a [[connecting homomorphism]] on cohomology. Writing μ<sub>2</sub> for the [[Group scheme of roots of unity|algebraic group of square roots of 1]] (over a field of characteristic not 2 it is roughly the same as a two-element group with trivial Galois action), the short exact sequence\n:<math> 1 \\to \\mu_2 \\rightarrow \\mbox{Pin}_V \\rightarrow \\mbox{O}_V \\rightarrow 1</math>\nyields a long exact sequence on cohomology, which begins\n:<math> 1 \\to H^0(\\mu_2;K) \\to H^0(\\mbox{Pin}_V;K) \\to H^0(\\mbox{O}_V;K) \\to H^1(\\mu_2;K).</math>\nThe 0th Galois cohomology group of an algebraic group with coefficients in ''K'' is just the group of ''K''-valued points: {{nowrap|1=''H''<sup>0</sup>(''G''; ''K'') = ''G''(''K'')}}, and {{nowrap|''H''<sup>1</sup>(μ<sub>2</sub>; ''K'') ≅ ''K''<sup>×</sup>/(''K''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>}}, which recovers the previous sequence\n:<math> 1 \\to \\{\\pm 1\\} \\to \\mbox{Pin}_V(K) \\to \\mbox{O}_V(K)  \\to K^{\\times}/(K^{\\times})^2,</math>\nwhere the spinor norm is the connecting homomorphism {{nowrap|''H''<sup>0</sup>(O<sub>''V''</sub>; ''K'') → ''H''<sup>1</sup>(μ<sub>2</sub>; ''K'')}}.\n\n==Spin and Pin groups==\n{{details|Spin group|Pin group|Spinor}}\n\nIn this section we assume that ''V'' is finite-dimensional and its bilinear form is non-singular. (If ''K'' has characteristic 2 this implies that the dimension of ''V'' is even.)\n\nThe [[Pin group]] Pin<sub>''V''</sub>(''K'') is the subgroup of the Clifford group Γ of elements of spinor norm 1, and similarly the [[Spin group]] Spin<sub>''V''</sub>(''K'') is the subgroup of elements of [[Orthogonal group#The Dickson invariant|Dickson invariant]] 0 in Pin<sub>''V''</sub>(''K''). When the characteristic is not 2, these are the elements of determinant 1. The Spin group usually has index 2 in the Pin group.\n\nRecall from the previous section that there is a homomorphism from the Clifford group onto the orthogonal group. We define the [[special orthogonal group]] to be the image of Γ<sup>0</sup>. If ''K'' does not have characteristic 2 this is just the group of elements of the orthogonal group of determinant 1. If ''K'' does have characteristic 2, then all elements of the orthogonal group have determinant 1, and the special orthogonal group is the set of elements of Dickson invariant 0.\n\nThere is a homomorphism from the Pin group to the orthogonal group. The image consists of the elements of spinor norm {{nowrap|1 ∈ ''K''<sup>×</sup>/(''K''<sup>×</sup>)<sup>2</sup>}}. The kernel consists of the elements +1 and −1, and has order 2 unless ''K'' has characteristic 2. Similarly there is a homomorphism from the Spin group to the special orthogonal group of ''V''.\n\nIn the common case when ''V'' is a positive or negative definite space over the reals, the spin group maps onto the special orthogonal group, and is simply connected when ''V'' has dimension at least 3. Further the kernel of this homomorphism consists of 1 and −1. So in this case the spin group, Spin(''n''), is a double cover of SO(''n''). Please note, however, that the simple connectedness of the spin group is not true in general: if ''V'' is '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> for ''p'' and ''q'' both at least 2 then the spin group is not simply connected. In this case the algebraic group Spin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub> is simply connected as an algebraic group, even though its group of real valued points Spin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') is not simply connected. This is a rather subtle point, which completely confused the authors of at least one standard book about spin groups.\n\n==Spinors==<!-- This section is linked from [[Spinor]] -->\nClifford algebras Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}}('''C'''), with {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' = 2''n''}} even, are matrix algebras which have a complex representation of dimension 2<sup>''n''</sup>. By restricting to the group Pin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') we get a complex representation of the Pin group of the same dimension, called the [[spin representation]]. If we restrict this to the spin group Spin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') then it splits as the sum of two ''half spin representations'' (or ''Weyl representations'') of dimension 2<sup>''n''−1</sup>.\n\nIf {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' = 2''n'' + 1}} is odd then the Clifford algebra Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}}('''C''') is a sum of two matrix algebras, each of which has a representation of dimension 2<sup>''n''</sup>, and these are also both representations of the Pin group Pin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R'''). On restriction to the spin group Spin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') these become isomorphic, so the spin group has a complex spinor representation of dimension 2<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nMore generally, spinor groups and pin groups over any field have similar representations whose exact structure depends on the [[classification of Clifford algebras|structure of the corresponding Clifford algebras]]: whenever a Clifford algebra has a factor that is a matrix algebra over some division algebra, we get a corresponding representation of the pin and spin groups over that division algebra.\nFor examples over the reals see the article on [[spinor]]s.\n\n===Real spinors===\n{{details|spinor}}\nTo describe the real spin representations, one must know how the spin group sits inside its Clifford algebra. The [[Pin group]], Pin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub> is the set of invertible elements in Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}} that can be written as a product of unit vectors:\n:<math>{\\mbox{Pin}}_{p,q}=\\{v_1v_2\\dots v_r |\\,\\, \\forall i\\, \\|v_i\\|=\\pm 1\\}.</math>\nComparing with the above concrete realizations of the Clifford algebras, the Pin group corresponds to the products of arbitrarily many reflections: it is a cover of the full orthogonal group {{nowrap|O(''p'', ''q'')}}.  The [[Spin group]] consists of those elements of Pin<sub>''p'', ''q''</sub> which are products of an even number of unit vectors.  Thus by the [[Cartan-Dieudonné theorem]] Spin is a cover of the group of proper rotations {{nowrap|SO(''p'', ''q'')}}.\n\nLet {{nowrap|''α'' : Cℓ → Cℓ}} be the automorphism which is given by the mapping {{nowrap|''v'' ↦ −''v''}} acting on pure vectors.  Then in particular, Spin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub> is the subgroup of Pin<sub>''p'',''q''</sub> whose elements are fixed by ''α''.  Let\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}^{[0]} = \\{ x\\in \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q} |\\, \\alpha(x)=x\\}.</math>\n(These are precisely the elements of even degree in Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}}.)  Then the spin group lies within Cℓ{{su|lh=1em|p=[0]|b=''p'',''q''}}.\n\nThe irreducible representations of Cℓ{{sub|''p'',''q''}} restrict to give representations of the pin group.  Conversely, since the pin group is generated by unit vectors, all of its irreducible representation are induced in this manner.  Thus the two representations coincide.  For the same reasons, the irreducible representations of the spin coincide with the irreducible representations of Cℓ{{su|lh=1em|p=[0]|b=''p'',''q''}}.\n\nTo classify the pin representations, one need only appeal to the [[classification of Clifford algebras]].  To find the spin representations (which are representations of the even subalgebra), one can first make use of either of the isomorphisms (see above)\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[0]}_{p,q} \\approx \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q-1}, \\text{ for } q > 0</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}^{[0]}_{p,q} \\approx \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{q,p-1}, \\text{ for } p > 0</math>\nand realize a spin representation in signature {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} as a pin representation in either signature {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'' − 1)}} or {{nowrap|(''q'', ''p'' − 1)}}.\n\n==Applications==\n===Differential geometry===\nOne of the principal applications of the exterior algebra is in [[differential geometry]] where it is used to define the [[fiber bundle|bundle]] of [[differential form]]s on a [[smooth manifold]]. In the case of a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]-)[[Riemannian manifold]], the [[tangent space]]s come equipped with a natural quadratic form induced by the [[metric tensor|metric]]. Thus, one can define a [[Clifford bundle]] in analogy with the [[exterior bundle]]. This has a number of important applications in [[Riemannian geometry]]. Perhaps more importantly is the link to a [[spin manifold]], its associated [[spinor bundle]] and spin<sup>c</sup> manifolds.\n\n===Physics===\nClifford algebras have numerous important applications in physics. Physicists usually consider a Clifford algebra to be an algebra with a basis generated by the matrices {{nowrap|''γ''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''γ''<sub>3</sub>}} called [[Dirac matrices]] which have the property that\n\n:<math>\\gamma_i\\gamma_j + \\gamma_j\\gamma_i = 2\\eta_{ij}\\,</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|''η''}} is the matrix of a quadratic form of signature {{nowrap|(1, 3)}} (or {{nowrap|(3, 1)}} corresponding to the two equivalent choices of metric signature). These are exactly the defining relations for the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ{{su|b=1,3}}('''R''')}}, whose [[complexification]] is {{nowrap|Cℓ{{su|b=1,3}}('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} which, by the [[classification of Clifford algebras]], is isomorphic to the algebra of {{nowrap|4 × 4}} complex matrices {{nowrap|Cℓ{{sub|4}}('''C''') ≈ M<sub>4</sub>('''C''')}}. However, it is best to retain the notation {{nowrap|Cℓ{{su|b=1,3}}('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, since any transformation that takes the bilinear form to the canonical form is ''not'' a Lorentz transformation of the underlying spacetime.\n\nThe Clifford algebra of spacetime used in physics thus has more structure than {{nowrap|Cℓ<sub>4</sub>('''C''')}}. It has in addition a set of preferred transformations – Lorentz transformations. Whether complexification is necessary to begin with depends in part on conventions used and in part on how much one wants to incorporate straightforwardly, but complexification is most often necessary in quantum mechanics where the spin representation of the Lie algebra {{nowrap|'''so'''(1, 3)}} sitting inside the Clifford algebra conventionally requires a complex Clifford algebra. For reference, the spin Lie algebra is given by\n\n:<math>\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu} = -\\frac{i}{4}[\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu],</math>\n\n:<math>[\\sigma^{\\mu\\nu},\\sigma^{\\rho\\tau}] = i(\\eta^{\\tau\\mu}\\sigma^{\\rho\\nu} + \\eta^{\\nu\\tau}\\sigma^{\\mu\\rho} - \\eta^{\\rho\\mu}\\sigma^{\\tau\\nu} -\\eta^{\\nu\\rho}\\sigma^{\\mu\\tau}).</math>\n\nThis is in the {{nowrap|(3, 1)}} convention, hence fits in {{nowrap|Cℓ{{su|b=3,1}}('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Weinberg|2002}}</ref>\n\nThe Dirac matrices were first written down by [[Paul Dirac]] when he was trying to write a relativistic first-order wave equation for the [[electron]], and give an explicit isomorphism from the Clifford algebra to the algebra of complex matrices. The result was used to define the [[Dirac equation]] and introduce the [[Dirac operator]]. The entire Clifford algebra shows up in [[quantum field theory]] in the form of [[Dirac field bilinear]]s.\n\nThe use of Clifford algebras to describe quantum theory has been advanced among others by [[Mario Schönberg]],<ref>See the references to Schönberg's papers of 1956 and 1957 as described in section \"The Grassmann–Schönberg algebra <math>G_n</math>\" of:A.

      "title": "Classification of Clifford algebras",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_Clifford_algebras",
      "text": "In [[abstract algebra]], in particular in the theory of [[Degeneracy (mathematics)|nondegenerate]] [[quadratic form]]s on [[vector space]]s, the structures of [[finite-dimensional]] [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] [[Clifford algebra]]s for a [[nondegenerate quadratic form]] have been completely classified. In each case, the Clifford algebra is [[Algebra homomorphism|algebra isomorphic]] to a full [[matrix ring]] over '''R''', '''C''', or '''H''' (the [[quaternion]]s), or to a [[direct sum of algebras|direct sum]] of two copies of such an algebra, though not in a [[canonical form|canonical]] way. Below it is shown that distinct Clifford algebras may be [[Algebra homomorphism|algebra-isomorphic]], as is the case of Cℓ<sub>2,0</sub>('''R''') and Cℓ<sub>1,1</sub>('''R'''), which are both isomorphic to the ring of two-by-two matrices over the real numbers.\n\n==Notation and conventions==\nThe [[Clifford product]] is the manifest ring product for the Clifford algebra, and all algebra [[homomorphism]]s in this article are with respect to this ring product. Other products defined within Clifford algebras, such as the [[exterior product]],  are not used here. This article uses the (+) [[sign convention]] for Clifford multiplication so that\n\n:<math>v^2 = Q(v)</math>\n\nfor all vectors {{nowrap|1=''v'' ∈ ''V''}}, where ''Q'' is the quadratic form on the vector space ''V''. We will denote the algebra of {{nowrap|1=''n''×''n''}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries in the [[division algebra]] ''K'' by M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') or {{nowrap|M(''n'', ''K'')}}. The [[direct sum]] of two such identical algebras will be denoted by {{nowrap|1=M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') ⊕ M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'') = M<sub>''n''</sub>{{sup|2}}(''K'')}}, which is isomorphic to {{nowrap|M<sub>''n''</sub>(''K'' ⊕ ''K'')}}.\n\n==Bott periodicity==\nClifford algebras exhibit a 2-fold periodicity over the complex numbers and an 8-fold periodicity over the real numbers, which is related to the same periodicities for homotopy groups of the stable [[unitary group]] and stable [[orthogonal group]], and is called [[Bott periodicity]]. The connection is explained by the [[Bott periodicity theorem#Geometric model of loop spaces|geometric model of loop spaces]] approach to Bott periodicity: their 2-fold/8-fold periodic embeddings of the [[classical group]]s in each other (corresponding to isomorphism groups of Clifford algebras), and their successive quotients are [[symmetric space]]s which are [[homotopy equivalent]] to the [[loop space]]s of the unitary/orthogonal group.\n\n==Complex case==\nThe complex case is particularly simple: every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form\n\n:<math>Q(u) = u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \\cdots + u_n^2</math>\n\nwhere {{nowrap|1=''n'' = dim ''V''}}, so there is essentially only one Clifford algebra in each dimension. This is because the complex numbers include <math>i</math> by which <math>-u_k^2 = +(i u_k)^2</math> and so positive or negative terms are equivalent. We will denote the Clifford algebra on '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> with the standard quadratic form by Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''').\n\nThere are two separate cases to consider, according to whether ''n'' is even or odd. When ''n'' is even the algebra Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') is [[central simple algebra|central simple]] and so by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over '''C'''. When ''n'' is odd, the center includes not only the scalars but the [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]]s (degree ''n'' elements) as well. We can always find a normalized pseudoscalar ''ω'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ω''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}. Define the operators\n\n:<math>P_{\\pm} = \\frac{1}{2}(1\\pm\\omega).</math>\n\nThese two operators form a complete set of [[Idempotent_element (ring theory)#Types_of_ring_idempotents|orthogonal idempotent]]s, and since they are central they give a decomposition of Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') into a direct sum of two algebras\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_n(\\mathbf{C}) = \\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^{+}(\\mathbf{C}) \\oplus \\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^{-}(\\mathbf{C}),</math> \n\nwhere \n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^\\pm(\\mathbf{C}) = P_\\pm \\operatorname{C\\ell}_n(\\mathbf{C}).</math>\n\nThe algebras <math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^\\pm(\\mathbf{C})</math> are just the positive and negative eigenspaces of ''ω'' and the ''P''<sub>±</sub> are just the projection operators. Since ''ω'' is odd, these algebras are mixed by ''α'' (the linear map on ''V'' defined by {{nowrap|1=''v'' ↦ −''v''}}):\n\n:<math>\\alpha(\\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^\\pm(\\mathbf{C})) = \\operatorname{C\\ell}_n^\\mp(\\mathbf{C})</math>.\n\nand therefore isomorphic (since ''α'' is an [[automorphism]]). These two isomorphic algebras are each central simple and so, again, isomorphic to a matrix algebra over '''C'''. The sizes of the matrices can be determined from the fact that the dimension of Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') is 2<sup>''n''</sup>. What we have then is the following table:\n\n{| class=wikitable align=center\n|-\n| ''n'' || Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''')\n|-\n| 2''m'' || M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''')\n|-\n| 2''m''+1 || M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''') ⊕ M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''')\n|}\n\nThe even subalgebra of Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') is (non-canonically) isomorphic to Cℓ<sub>''n''−1</sub>('''C'''). When ''n'' is even, the even subalgebra can be identified with the block diagonal matrices (when partitioned into 2×2 [[block matrix]]). When ''n'' is odd, the even subalgebra are those elements of {{nowrap|1=M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''') ⊕ M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''')}} for which the two factors are identical. Picking either piece then gives an isomorphism with {{nowrap|1=Cℓ<sub>''n''−1</sub>('''C''') ≅ M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C''')}}.\n\n==Real case==\nThe real case is significantly more complicated, exhibiting a periodicity of 8 rather than 2, and there is a 2-parameter family of Clifford algebras.\n\n===Classification of quadratic forms===\n\nFirstly, there are non-isomorphic quadratic forms of a given degree, classified by signature.\n\nEvery nondegenerate quadratic form on a real vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form:\n:<math>Q(u) = u_1^2 + \\cdots + u_p^2 - u_{p+1}^2 - \\cdots - u_{p+q}^2</math>\nwhere {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''p'' + ''q''}} is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers (''p'', ''q'') is called the [[metric signature|signature]] of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>. The Clifford algebra on '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> is denoted Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''').\n\nA standard [[orthonormal basis]] {''e''<sub>''i''</sub>} for '''R'''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> consists of {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''p'' + ''q''}} mutually orthogonal vectors, ''p'' of which have norm +1 and ''q'' of which have norm −1.\n\n===Unit pseudoscalar===\n{{See also|Pseudoscalar}}\nThe unit pseudoscalar in Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') is defined as\n:<math>\\omega = e_1e_2\\cdots e_n.</math>\nThis is both a [[Coxeter element]] of sorts (product of reflections) and a [[longest element of a Coxeter group]] in the [[Bruhat order]]; this is an analogy. It corresponds to and generalizes a [[volume form]] (in the [[exterior algebra]]; for the trivial quadratic form, the unit pseudoscalar is a volume form), and lifts [[reflection through the origin]] (meaning that the image of the unit pseudoscalar is reflection through the origin, in the [[orthogonal group]]).\n\nTo compute the square <math>\\omega^2=(e_1e_2\\cdots e_n)(e_1e_2\\cdots e_n)</math>, one can either reverse the order of the second group, yielding <math>\\mbox{sgn}(\\sigma)e_1e_2\\cdots e_n e_n\\cdots e_2 e_1</math>, or apply a [[Faro shuffle|perfect shuffle]],\nyielding <math>\\mbox{sgn}(\\sigma)(e_1e_1e_2e_2\\cdots e_ne_n)</math>. These both have sign <math>(-1)^{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}=(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}</math>, which is 4-periodic ([[Symmetric group#Elements|proof]]), and combined with <math>e_i e_i = \\pm 1</math>, this shows that the square of ''ω'' is given by\n\n:<math>\\omega^2 = (-1)^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}(-1)^q = (-1)^{\\frac{(p-q)(p-q-1)}{2}} = \\begin{cases}+1 & p-q \\equiv 0,1 \\mod{4}\\\\ -1 & p-q \\equiv 2,3 \\mod{4}.\\end{cases}</math>\n\nNote that, unlike the complex case, it is not always possible to find a pseudoscalar that squares to +1.\n\n===Center===\nIf ''n'' (equivalently, {{nowrap|1=''p'' − ''q''}}) is even, the algebra Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') is [[central simple algebra|central simple]] and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over '''R''' or '''H''' by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].\n\nIf ''n'' (equivalently, {{nowrap|1=''p'' − ''q''}}) is odd then the algebra is no longer central simple but rather has a center which includes the pseudoscalars as well as the scalars. If ''n'' is odd and {{nowrap|1=''ω''<sup>2</sup> = +1}} (equivalently, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' − ''q'' ≡ 1 (mod 4)}}) then, just as in the complex case, the algebra Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') decomposes into a direct sum of isomorphic algebras\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}^{+}(\\mathbf{R})\\oplus \\operatorname{C\\ell}_{p,q}^{-}(\\mathbf{R})</math>\n\neach of which is central simple and so isomorphic to matrix algebra over '''R''' or '''H'''.\n\nIf ''n'' is odd and {{nowrap|1=''ω''<sup>2</sup> = −1}} (equivalently, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' − ''q'' ≡ −1 (mod 4)}}) then the center of Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') is isomorphic to '''C''' and can be considered as a ''complex'' algebra. As a complex algebra, it is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over '''C'''.\n\n===Classification===\nAll told there are three properties which determine the class of the algebra Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R'''):\n* signature mod 2: ''n'' is even/odd: central simple or not\n* signature mod 4: {{nowrap|1=''ω''<sup>2</sup> = ±1}}: if not central simple, center is {{nowrap|1='''R''' ⊕ '''R'''}} or '''C'''\n* signature mod 8: the [[Brauer group|Brauer class]] of the algebra (''n'' even) or even subalgebra (''n'' odd) is '''R''' or '''H'''\nEach of these properties depends only on the signature {{nowrap|1=''p'' − ''q''}} [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 8. The complete classification table is given below. The size of the matrices is determined by the requirement that Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') have dimension 2<sup>''p''+''q''</sup>.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n| ''p''−''q'' mod 8 || ''ω''<sup>2</sup>\n| Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''')<br><small>(''n'' = ''p''+''q'')</small>\n| ''p''−''q'' mod 8 || ''ω''<sup>2</sup>\n| Cℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''')<br><small>(''n'' = ''p''+''q'')</small>\n|-\n| 0 || + || M(2<sup>''n''/2</sup>,'''R''')\n| 1 || + || M(2<sup>(''n''−1)/2</sup>,'''R''')⊕M(2<sup>(''n''−1)/2</sup>,'''R''')\n|-\n| 2 || − || M(2<sup>''n/2''</sup>,'''R''')\n| 3 || − || M(2<sup>(''n''−1)/2</sup>,'''C''')\n|-\n| 4 || + || M(2<sup>(''n''−2)/2</sup>,'''H''')\n| 5 || + || M(2<sup>(''n''−3)/2</sup>,'''H''')⊕M(2<sup>(''n''−3)/2</sup>,'''H''')\n|-\n| 6 || − || M(2<sup>(''n''−2)/2</sup>,'''H''')\n| 7 || − || M(2<sup>(''n''−1)/2</sup>,'''C''')\n|}\n\nIt may be seen that of all matrix ring types mentioned, there is only one type shared between both complex and real algebras: the type M(2<sup>''m''</sup>,'''C'''). For example, Cℓ<sub>2</sub>('''C''') and Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') are both determined to be M<sub>2</sub>('''C'''). It is important to note that there is a difference in the classifying isomorphisms used. Since the Cℓ<sub>2</sub>('''C''') is algebra isomorphic via a '''C'''-linear map (which is necessarily '''R'''-linear), and Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') is algebra isomorphic via an '''R'''-linear map, Cℓ<sub>2</sub>('''C''') and Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') are '''R'''-algebra isomorphic.\n\nA table of this classification for {{nowrap|1=''p'' + ''q'' ≤ 8}} follows.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''Clifford bundle''' is an [[algebra bundle]] whose fibers have the structure of a [[Clifford algebra]] and whose [[local trivialization]]s respect the algebra structure. There is a natural Clifford bundle associated to any ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo]]) [[Riemannian manifold]] ''M'' which is called the Clifford bundle of ''M''.\n\n==General construction==\n\nLet ''V'' be a ([[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]) [[vector space]] together with a [[symmetric bilinear form]] <·,·>. The [[Clifford algebra]] ''Cℓ''(''V'') is a natural ([[unital algebra|unital]] [[associative algebra|associative]]) [[algebra over a field|algebra]] generated by ''V'' subject only to the relation\n:<math>v^2 = -\\langle v,v\\rangle</math>\nfor all ''v'' in ''V''.<ref>There is an arbitrary [[sign convention|choice of sign]] in the definition of a Clifford algebra. In general, one can take ''v''<sup>2</sup> = ±<''v'',''v''>. In differential geometry, it is common to use the (−) sign convention.</ref> One can construct ''Cℓ''(''V'') as a quotient of the [[tensor algebra]] of ''V'' by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the above relation.\n\nLike other tensor operations, this construction can be carried out fiberwise on a smooth [[vector bundle]]. Let ''E'' be a smooth vector bundle over a [[smooth manifold]] ''M'', and let ''g'' be a smooth symmetric bilinear form on ''E''. The '''Clifford bundle''' of ''E'' is the [[fiber bundle]] whose fibers are the Clifford algebras generated by the fibers of ''E'':\n:<math>C\\ell(E) = \\coprod_{x\\in M} C\\ell(E_x,g_x)</math>\nThe [[topology (structure)|topology]] of ''Cℓ''(''E'') is determined by that of ''E'' via an [[associated bundle]] construction.\n\nOne is most often interested in the case where ''g'' is [[definite bilinear form|positive-definite]] or at least [[nondegenerate form|nondegenerate]]; that is, when (''E'', ''g'') is a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian vector bundle.  For concreteness, suppose that (''E'', ''g'') is a Riemannian vector bundle. The Clifford bundle of ''E'' can be constructed as follows. Let ''Cℓ''<sub>''n''</sub>'''R''' be the Clifford algebra generated by '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> with the [[Euclidean metric]]. The standard action of the [[orthogonal group]] O(''n'') on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> induces a graded [[automorphism]] of ''Cℓ''<sub>''n''</sub>'''R'''. The homomorphism\n:<math>\\rho : \\mathrm O(n) \\to \\mathrm{Aut}(C\\ell_n\\mathbb R)</math>\nis determined by\n:<math>\\rho(A)(v_1v_2\\cdots v_k) = (Av_1)(Av_2)\\cdots(Av_k)</math>\nwhere ''v''<sub>''i''</sub> are all vectors in  '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. The Clifford bundle of ''E'' is then given by\n:<math>C\\ell(E) = F(E) \\times_\\rho C\\ell_n\\mathbb R</math>\nwhere ''F''(''E'') is the [[orthonormal frame bundle]] of ''E''. It is clear from this construction that the [[structure group]] of ''Cℓ''(''E'') is O(''n''). Since O(''n'') acts by graded automorphisms on ''Cℓ''<sub>''n''</sub>'''R''' it follows that ''Cℓ''(''E'') is a bundle of [[superalgebra|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>-graded algebras]] over ''M''. The Clifford bundle ''Cℓ''(''E'') can then be decomposed into even and odd subbundles:\n:<math>C\\ell(E)  = C\\ell^0(E) \\oplus C\\ell^1(E).</math>\n\nIf the vector bundle ''E'' is [[orientability|orientable]] then one can reduce the structure group of ''Cℓ''(''E'') from O(''n'') to SO(''n'') in the natural manner.\n\n==Clifford bundle of a Riemannian manifold==\n\nIf ''M'' is a [[Riemannian manifold]] with [[metric tensor|metric]] ''g'', then the Clifford bundle of ''M'' is the Clifford bundle generated by the [[tangent bundle]] ''TM''. One can also build a Clifford bundle out of the [[cotangent bundle]] ''T''*''M''. The metric induces a [[natural isomorphism]] ''TM'' = ''T''*''M'' and therefore an isomorphism ''Cℓ''(''TM'') = ''Cℓ''(''T''*''M'').\n\nThere is a natural [[vector bundle morphism|vector bundle isomorphism]] between the Clifford bundle of ''M'' and the [[exterior bundle]] of ''M'':\n:<math>C\\ell(T^*M) \\cong \\Lambda(T^*M).</math>\nThis is an isomorphism of vector bundles ''not'' algebra bundles. The isomorphism is induced from the corresponding isomorphism on each fiber. In this way one can think of sections of the Clifford bundle as [[differential form]]s on ''M'' equipped with Clifford multiplication rather than the [[wedge product]] (which is independent of the metric).\n\nThe above isomorphism respects the grading in the sense that\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nC\\ell^0(T^*M) &= \\Lambda^{\\mathrm{even}}(T^*M)\\\\\nC\\ell^1(T^*M) &= \\Lambda^{\\mathrm{odd}}(T^*M).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Orthonormal frame bundle]]\n* [[Spinor]]\n* [[Spin manifold]]\n* [[Spinor representation]]\n* [[Spin geometry]]\n* [[Spin structure]]\n* [[Clifford module bundle]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | last1=Berline | first1=Nicole | author1-link=Nicole Berline | last2=Getzler | first2=Ezra | author2-link=Ezra Getzler |  last3=Vergne | first3=Michèle | author3-link=Michèle Vergne | title=Heat kernels and Dirac operators | edition=Paperback | series=Grundlehren Text Editions | location=Berlin, New York | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | isbn=3-540-20062-2 | year=2004 | zbl=1037.58015 }}\n*{{cite book | last1=Lawson | first1=H.

In 5 spacetime dimensions, the 4 gammas above together with the fifth gamma-matrix to be presented below generate the Clifford algebra.\n\n==Mathematical structure==\nThe defining property for the gamma matrices to generate a [[Clifford algebra]] is the anticommutation relation\n: <math>\\{ \\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu \\} = \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu + \\gamma^\\nu \\gamma^\\mu = 2 \\eta^{\\mu \\nu} I_4,</math>\nwhere <math>\\{ , \\}</math> is the [[anticommutator]], <math>\\eta^{\\mu \\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature {{nowrap|(+ − − −)}}, and <math>I_4</math> is the {{nowrap|4 × 4}} [[identity matrix]].\n\nThis defining property is more fundamental than the numerical values used in the specific representation of the gamma matrices.  [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|Covariant]] gamma matrices are defined by\n: <math>\\gamma_\\mu = \\eta_{\\mu \\nu} \\gamma^\\nu = \\left\\{\\gamma^0, -\\gamma^1, -\\gamma^2, -\\gamma^3 \\right\\},</math>\nand [[Einstein notation]] is assumed.\n\nNote that the other [[sign convention]] for the metric, {{nowrap|(− + + +)}} necessitates either a change in the defining equation:\n: <math>\\{ \\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu \\} = -2 \\eta^{\\mu \\nu} I_4 </math>\nor a multiplication of all gamma matrices by <math>i</math>, which of course changes their hermiticity properties detailed below. Under the alternative sign convention for the metric the covariant gamma matrices are then defined by\n: <math>\\gamma_\\mu = \\eta_{\\mu \\nu} \\gamma^\\nu = \\left\\{-\\gamma^0, +\\gamma^1, +\\gamma^2, +\\gamma^3 \\right\\}.</math>\n\n==Physical structure==\nThe Clifford algebra {{math|Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')}} over spacetime {{math|''V''}} can be regarded as the set of real linear operators from {{math|''V''}} to itself, {{math|End(''V'')}}, or more generally, when [[Complexification|complexified]] to {{math|Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}}, as the set of linear operators from any 4-dimensional complex vector space to itself. More simply, given a basis for {{math|''V''}}, {{math|Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} is just the set of all {{math|4&thinsp;×&thinsp;4}} complex matrices, but endowed with a Clifford algebra structure. Spacetime is assumed to be endowed with the Minkowski metric {{math|''η<sub>μν</sub>''}}. A space of bispinors, {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}}, is also assumed at every point in spacetime, endowed with the [[bispinor|bispinor representation]] of the [[Lorentz group]]. The bispinor fields {{math|Ψ}}  of the Dirac equations, evaluated at any point {{math|''x''}} in spacetime, are elements of {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}}, see below. The Clifford algebra is assumed to act on {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}} as well (by matrix multiplication with column vectors {{math|Ψ(''x'')}} in {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}} for all {{math|''x''}}). This will be the primary view of elements of {{math|Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} in this section.\n\nFor each linear transformation {{math|''S''}} of {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}}, there is a transformation of {{math|End(''U''<sub>''x''</sub>)}} given by {{math|''SES''<sup>−1</sup>}} for {{math|''E''}} in {{math|Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub> ≈ End(''U''<sub>''x''</sub>)}}. If {{math|''S''}} belongs to a representation of the Lorentz group, then the induced action {{math|''E'' ↦ ''SES''<sup>−1</sup>}} will also belong to a representation of the Lorentz group, see [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group]].\n\nIf {{math|S(Λ)}} is the [[Bispinor|bispinor representation]] acting on {{math|''U''<sub>''x''</sub>}} of an arbitrary [[Lorentz transformation]] {{math|Λ}} in the standard (4-vector) representation acting on {{math|''V''}}, then there is a corresponding operator on {{math|1=End(''U''<sub>''x''</sub>) = Cl<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''')<sub>'''C'''</sub>}} given by\n\n: <math>\\gamma^\\mu \\mapsto S(\\Lambda)\\gamma^\\mu S(\\Lambda)^{-1} = {(\\Lambda^{-1})^\\mu}_\\nu \\gamma^\\nu := {\\Lambda_\\nu}^\\mu \\gamma^\\nu,</math>\n\nshowing that the {{math|''γ<sup>μ</sup>''}} can be viewed as a ''basis'' of a [[representation space]] of the [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|4-vector representation]] of the Lorentz group sitting inside the Clifford algebra. This means that quantities of the form\n\n: <math>a\\!\\!\\!/ := a_\\mu\\gamma^\\mu</math>\n\nshould be treated as 4-vectors in manipulations. It also means that indices can be raised and lowered on the {{math|''γ''}} using the metric {{math|''η<sub>μν</sub>''}} as with any 4-vector. The notation is called the [[Feynman slash notation]]. The slash operation maps the basis {{math|''e<sub>μ</sub>''}} of {{math|''V''}}, or any 4-dimensional vector space, to basis vectors {{math|''γ<sub>μ</sub>''}}. The transformation rule for slashed quantities is simply\n\n: <math>{a\\!\\!\\!/}^\\mu \\mapsto {\\Lambda^\\mu}_\\nu {a\\!\\!\\!/}^\\nu.</math>\n\nOne should note that this is different from the transformation rule for the {{math|''γ<sup>μ</sup>''}}, which are now treated as (fixed) basis vectors. The designation of the 4-tuple {{math|1=(''γ<sup>μ</sup>'') = (''γ''<sup>0</sup>, ''γ''<sup>1</sup>, ''γ''<sup>2</sup>, ''γ''<sup>3</sup>)}} as a 4-vector sometimes found in the literature is thus a slight misnomer. The latter transformation corresponds to an active transformation of the components of a slashed quantity in terms of the basis {{math|''γ<sup>μ</sup>''}}, and the former to a passive transformation of the basis {{math|''γ<sup>μ</sup>''}} itself.\n\nThe elements {{math|1=''σ<sup>μν</sup>'' = ''γ<sup>μ</sup>γ<sup>ν</sup>'' − ''γ<sup>ν</sup>γ<sup>μ</sup>''}} form a representation of the [[Lie algebra]] of the Lorentz group. This is a spin representation. When these matrices, and linear combinations of them, are exponentiated, they are bispinor representations of the Lorentz group, e.g., the {{math|S(Λ)}} of above are of this form. The 6-dimensional space the {{math|''σ<sup>μν</sup>''}} span is the representation space of a tensor representation of the Lorentz group. For the higher order elements of the Clifford algebra in general and their transformation rules, see the article [[Dirac algebra]]. But it is noted here that the Clifford algebra has no subspace being the representation space of a spin representation of the Lorentz group in the context used here.\n\n==Expressing the Dirac equation==\nIn [[natural units]], the Dirac equation may be written as\n:<math> (i \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m) \\psi = 0</math>\nwhere <math>\\psi</math> is a Dirac spinor.\n\nSwitching to [[Feynman notation]], the Dirac equation is\n:<math> (i {\\partial\\!\\!\\!/} - m) \\psi = 0. </math>\n\n==The fifth gamma matrix, {{varserif|γ}}<sup>5</sup>==\nIt is useful to define a product of the four gamma matrices as  <math>\\gamma ^5 = \\sigma_1\\otimes I  </math>, so that\n:<math> \\gamma^5 := i\\gamma^0\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} </math> (in the Dirac basis).\nAlthough <math>\\gamma^5</math> uses the letter gamma, it is not one of ''the'' gamma matrices of ''C''ℓ<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''').

Regarding the [[Pauli matrices]], the basis  can be written as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\gamma^0 &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\sigma^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},&\n    \\gamma^1 &= \\begin{pmatrix} i\\sigma^3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & i\\sigma^3 \\end{pmatrix},&\n    \\gamma^2 &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\\sigma^2 \\\\ \\sigma^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\\\\n  \\gamma^3 &= \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\sigma^1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -i\\sigma^1 \\end{pmatrix},&\n    \\gamma^5 &= \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\\sigma^2 \\end{pmatrix},&\n           C &= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\sigma^2 \\\\ -i\\sigma^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe reason for making all gamma matrices imaginary is solely to obtain the particle physics metric {{nowrap|(+, −, −, −)}} in which squared masses are positive.  The Majorana representation, however, is real.  One can factor out the <math>i</math> to obtain a different representation with four component real spinors and real gamma matrices.  The consequence of removing the <math>i</math> is that the only possible metric with real gamma matrices is {{nowrap|(−, +, +, +)}}.\n\n=== ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>(C) and ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>(R) ===\nThe Dirac algebra can be regarded as a [[complexification]] of the real algebra ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>('''R'''), called the [[space time algebra]]:\n::<math> Cl_{1,3}(\\mathbb{C}) = Cl_{1,3}(\\mathbb{R}) \\otimes \\mathbb{C} </math>\n''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''') differs from ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>('''C'''): in ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''') only ''real'' linear combinations of the gamma matrices and their products are allowed.\n\nTwo things deserve to be pointed out. As ''Clifford algebras'', ''C''&#x2113;<sub>1,3</sub>('''C''') and ''C''&#x2113;<sub>4</sub>('''C''') are isomorphic, see [[classification of Clifford algebras]]. The reason is that the underlying signature of the spacetime metric loses its signature (3,1) upon passing to the complexification. However, the transformation required to bring the bilinear form to the complex canonical form is not a Lorentz transformation and hence not \"permissible\" (at the very least impractical) since all physics is tightly knit to the Lorentz symmetry and it is preferable to keep it manifest.\n\nProponents of [[geometric algebra]] strive to work with real algebras wherever that is possible. They argue that it is generally possible (and usually enlightening) to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in a real Clifford algebra that square to −1, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.  Some of these proponents also question whether it is necessary or even useful to introduce an additional imaginary unit in the context of the Dirac equation.<ref name=Hestenes1>See e.g. [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf-preAdobe8/REAL_DIRAC.pdf Hestenes 1996].</ref>\n\nHowever, in contemporary practice, the Dirac algebra rather than the space-time algebra continues to be the standard environment the [[spinor]]s of the Dirac equation \"live\" in.\n\n==Euclidean Dirac matrices==\nIn [[quantum field theory]] one can [[Wick rotate]] the time axis to transit from [[Minkowski space]] to [[Euclidean space]]. This is particularly useful in some [[renormalization]] procedures as well as [[lattice gauge theory]]. In Euclidean space, there are two commonly used representations of Dirac matrices:\n\n===Chiral representation===\n:<math>\\gamma^{1, 2, 3} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n     0 &  i\\sigma^{1, 2, 3} \\\\\n    -i\\sigma^{1, 2, 3} & 0 \n  \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n  \\gamma^4 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n      0 & I_2 \\\\\n    I_2 & 0\n  \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nNotice that the factors of <math>i</math> have been inserted in the spatial gamma matrices so that the Euclidean Clifford algebra\n:<math>\\left\\{\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu \\right\\} = 2\\delta^{\\mu\\nu} I_4</math>\n\nwill emerge.  It is also worth noting that there are variants of this which insert instead <math>-i</math> on one of the matrices, such as in lattice QCD codes which use the chiral basis.\n\nIn Euclidean space,\n:<math>\\gamma_M^5 = i \\left(\\gamma^0\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3\\right)_M = \\frac{1}{i^2}\\left(\\gamma^4\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3 \\right)_E = \\left(\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3\\gamma^4\\right)_E = \\gamma^5_E.</math>\n\nUsing the anti-commutator and noting that in Euclidean space <math>\\left(\\gamma^\\mu\\right)^\\dagger = \\gamma^\\mu</math>, one shows that\n:<math>\\left(\\gamma^5\\right)^\\dagger = \\gamma^5</math>\n\nIn chiral basis in Euclidean space,\n:<math>\\gamma^5 = \\begin{pmatrix} -I_2 & 0\\\\ 0 & I_2 \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nwhich is unchanged from its Minkowski version.\n\n===Non-relativistic representation===\n:<math>\\gamma^{1,2,3} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\sigma^{1,2,3} \\\\ i \\sigma^{1,2,3} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\gamma^4 = \\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I_2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \n\\gamma^5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -I_2 \\\\ -I_2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|physics}}\n*[[Pauli matrices]]\n*[[Gell-Mann matrices]]\n*[[Higher-dimensional gamma matrices]]\n*[[Fierz identity]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Halzen, Francis |authorlink1 = Francis Halzen |author2=Martin, Alan | authorlink2 = Alan Martin (physicist) |title=Quarks & Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics | publisher=John Wiley & Sons | year=1984 | isbn=0-471-88741-2}}\n* A.

      "text": "{{short description|Algebraic structure associated to vector calculus in geometry}}\n{{other uses}}\nThe '''geometric algebra''' ('''GA''') of a [[vector space]] is an [[algebra over a field]], noted for its multiplication operation called the '''geometric product''' on a space of elements called [[multivector]]s, which is a superset of both the [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s <math>F</math> and the vector space <math>V</math>. Mathematically, a geometric algebra may be defined as the [[Clifford algebra]] of a [[vector space]] with a [[quadratic form]]. Clifford's contribution was to define a new product, the geometric product, that united the Grassmann and Hamilton algebras into a single structure. Adding the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of the Grassmann exterior product (the \"meet\") allows the use of the [[Grassmann–Cayley algebra]], and a [[Conformal geometry|conformal version]] of the latter together with a conformal Clifford algebra yields a [[Conformal geometric algebra |conformal geometric algebra (CGA)]] providing a framework for [[Klein geometry|classical geometries]].{{sfn|Li|2008|p=411}} In practice, these and several derived operations allow a correspondence of elements, subspaces and operations of the algebra with geometric interpretations.\n\nThe scalars and vectors have their usual interpretation, and make up distinct subspaces of a GA. [[Bivector]]s provide a more natural representation of pseudovector quantities in [[vector algebra]] such as oriented area, oriented angle of rotation, torque, angular momentum, electromagnetic field and the [[Poynting vector]]. A [[trivector]] can represent an oriented volume, and so on. An element called a [[Blade (geometry)|blade]] may be used to represent a subspace of <math>V</math> and orthogonal projections onto that subspace. Rotations and reflections are represented as elements. Unlike vector algebra, a GA naturally accommodates any number of dimensions and any quadratic form such as in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].\n\nSpecific examples of geometric algebras applied in physics include the [[spacetime algebra]] (or the less common alternative formulation, the [[algebra of physical space]]) and the [[conformal geometric algebra]]. [[Geometric calculus]], an extension of GA that incorporates [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], can be used to formulate other theories such as [[complex analysis]], [[differential geometry]], e.g. by using the Clifford algebra instead of [[differential form]]s. Geometric algebra has been advocated, most notably by [[David Hestenes]]{{sfn|Hestenes|2003}} and [[Chris J. L. Doran|Chris Doran]],{{sfn|Doran|1994}} as the preferred mathematical framework for [[physics]]. Proponents claim that it provides compact and intuitive descriptions in many areas including [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetic theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].{{sfn|Lasenby|Lasenby|Doran|2000}} GA has also found use as a computational tool in [[computer graphics]]{{sfn|Hildenbrand|Fontijne|Perwass|Dorst|2004}} and [[robotics]].\n\nThe geometric product was first briefly mentioned by [[Hermann Grassmann]],{{sfn|Hestenes|1986|loc=p. 6}} who was chiefly interested in developing the closely related [[exterior algebra]]. In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] greatly expanded on Grassmann's work to form what are now usually called Clifford algebras in his honor (although Clifford himself chose to call them \"geometric algebras\"). For several decades, geometric algebras went somewhat ignored, greatly eclipsed by the [[vector calculus]] then newly developed to describe electromagnetism. The term \"geometric algebra\" was repopularized in the 1960s by Hestenes, who advocated its importance to relativistic physics.{{sfn|Hestenes|1966}}\n\n==Definition and notation==\nThere are a number of different ways to define a geometric algebra. Hestenes's original approach was axiomatic,{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1984|p=3-5}} \"full of geometric significance\" and equivalent to the universal Clifford algebra.{{sfn|Aragón|Aragón|Rodríguez|1997|p=101}}\nGiven a finite-dimensional [[quadratic space]] <math>V</math> over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> with a symmetric bilinear form (the ''inner product'', e.g. the Euclidean or [[Lorentzian metric]]) <math>g : V \\times V \\rightarrow F</math>, the '''geometric algebra''' for this quadratic space is the [[Clifford algebra]] <math>\\operatorname{Cl}(V, g)</math>. As usual in this domain, for the remainder of this article, only the [[Real number|real]] case, <math>F = \\mathbf{R}</math>, will be considered. The notation <math>\\mathcal G(p,q)</math> or <math>\\mathcal G_{n}</math> will be used to describe the geometric algebra.\n\nThe essential product in the algebra is called the ''geometric product'', and the product in the contained exterior algebra is called the ''exterior product'' (frequently called the ''outer product'' and less often the ''wedge''). It is standard to denote these respectively by juxtaposition (i.e., suppressing any explicit multiplication symbol) and the symbol <math>\\wedge</math>. The above definition of the geometric algebra is abstract, so we summarize the properties of the geometric product by the following set of axioms. The geometric product of <math>\\mathcal G_{n}</math> has the following properties for multivectors <math> A, B, C</math>:\n\n:<math>AB \\in \\mathcal G_{n}</math>\n:<math>1A=A1=A</math>, where <math>1</math> is the unit and <math>A</math> any element of the algebra (existence of an identity element)\n:<math>A(BC)=(AB)C</math>, where <math>A</math>, <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are any elements of the algebra ([[associativity]])\n:<math>A(B+C)=AB+AC</math> and <math>(B+C)A=BA+CA</math>, where <math>A</math>, <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are any elements of the algebra ([[distributivity]])\n:<math>a^2 = g(a,a)1</math>, where <math>a</math> is any element of the subspace <math>V</math> of the algebra.(In other words, the geometric product <math>aa</math> is linked to the inner product <math>a \\cdot a</math>.)\n\nThe exterior product has the same properties, except that <math>a \\wedge a = 0</math> for <math>a \\in V</math>.\n\nNote that in the final property above, the real number <math>g(a,a)</math> need not be nonnegative if <math>g</math> is not positive-definite. An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements having a multiplicative inverse. If <math>a^2 \\ne 0 </math> for some vector <math>a</math>, then <math>a^{-1}</math> exists and is equal to <math>g(a,a)^{-1}a</math>. A nonzero element of the algebra does not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse. For example, if <math>u</math> is a vector in <math>V</math> such that <math>u^2 = 1</math>, the element <math>\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math> is both a nontrivial [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] and a nonzero [[zero divisor]], and thus has no inverse.{{efn|Given <math>\\textstyle u^2 = 1</math>, we have that <math>\\textstyle(\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2u + uu) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2u + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math>, showing that <math>\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math> is idempotent, and that <math>\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)(1 - u) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - uu) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0</math>, showing that it is a nonzero zero divisor.}}\n\nIt is usual to identify <math>1 \\in \\mathbf{R}</math> with <math>1 \\in \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math>, with associated natural [[embedding]]s <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math> and <math>V \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math>.

Throughout, the term ''vector'' refers to an element of <math>V</math> (and its image under this embedding).\n\n===The geometric product===\n{{main|Symmetric bilinear form|Exterior algebra}}\n[[File:GA parallel and perpendicular vectors.svg|200px|right|thumb|Given two vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, if the geometric product <math>ab</math> is<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hestenes, David (2005), [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/IntroPrimerGeometricAlgebra.html Introduction to Primer for Geometric Algebra]</ref> anticommutative; they are perpendicular (top) because <math>a \\cdot b = 0</math>, if it is commutative; they are parallel (bottom) because <math>a \\wedge b = 0</math>.]]\n{{multiple image\n | left\n | footer = Geometric interpretation of grade-<math>n</math> elements in a real exterior algebra for <math>n = 0</math> (signed point), <math>1</math> (directed line segment, or vector), <math>2</math> (oriented plane element), <math>3</math> (oriented volume).

The antisymmetric part is the exterior product of the two vectors, the product of the contained [[exterior algebra]]:\n\n:<math>a \\wedge b := \\frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) = -(b \\wedge a)</math>\n\nThen by simple addition:\n\n:<math>ab=a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b </math> the ungeneralized or vector form of the geometric product.\n\nThe inner and exterior products are associated with familiar concepts from standard vector algebra. Geometrically, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] if their geometric product is equal to their inner product, whereas <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are [[perpendicular]] if their geometric product is equal to their exterior product. In a geometric algebra for which the square of any nonzero vector is positive, the inner product of two vectors can be identified with the [[dot product]] of standard vector algebra. The exterior product of two vectors can be identified with the [[signed area]] enclosed by a [[parallelogram]] the sides of which are the vectors. The [[cross product]] of two vectors in <math>3</math> dimensions with positive-definite quadratic form is closely related to their exterior product.\n\nMost instances of geometric algebras of interest have a nondegenerate quadratic form. If the quadratic form is fully [[nondegenerate quadratic form|degenerate]], the inner product of any two vectors is always zero, and the geometric algebra is then simply an exterior algebra. Unless otherwise stated, this article will treat only nondegenerate geometric algebras.\n\nThe exterior product is naturally extended as an associative bilinear binary operator between any two elements of the algebra, satisfying the identities\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                          1 \\wedge a_i &= a_i \\wedge 1 = a_i \\\\\n  a_1 \\wedge a_2\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge a_r &= \\frac{1}{r!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\mathfrak{S}_r} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) a_{\\sigma(1)}a_{\\sigma(2)} \\cdots a_{\\sigma(r)},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of the indices, with <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> the [[parity of a permutation|sign of the permutation]], and <math>a_i</math> are vectors (not general elements of the algebra). Since every element of the algebra can be expressed as the sum of products of this form, this defines the exterior product for every pair of elements of the algebra. It follows from the definition that the exterior product forms an [[alternating algebra]].\n\n===Blades, grades, and canonical basis===\nA multivector that is the exterior product of <math>r</math> linearly independent vectors is called a ''blade'', and the blade is said to be a multivector of grade <math>r</math>.{{efn|Grade is a synonym for ''degree'' of a homogeneous element under the [[graded algebra|grading as an algebra]] with the exterior product (a <math>\\mathrm{Z}</math>-grading), and not under the geometric product.{{efn|When referring to grading under the geometric product, the literature generally only focuses on a <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math>-grading, meaning the split into even and odd <math>\\mathrm{Z}</math>-grades. <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math> is a subgroup of the full <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2{}^n</math>-grading of the geometric product.}}}} From the axioms, with closure, every multivector of the geometric algebra is a sum of blades.\n\nConsider a set of <math>r</math> linearly independent vectors <math>\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_r\\}</math> spanning an <math>r</math>-dimensional subspace of the vector space. With these, we can define a real [[symmetric matrix]] (in the same way as a [[Gramian matrix]])\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{A}]_{ij}=a_i\\cdot a_j</math>\n\nBy the [[spectral theorem]], <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> can be diagonalized to [[diagonal matrix]] <math>\\mathbf{D}</math> by an [[orthogonal matrix]] <math>\\mathbf{O}</math> via\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}[\\mathbf{O}^{\\mathrm{T}}]_{lj}=\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{O}]_{jl}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}</math>\n\nDefine a new set of vectors <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}</math>, known as orthogonal basis vectors, to be those transformed by the orthogonal matrix:\n\n:<math>e_i=\\sum_j[\\mathbf{O}]_{ij}a_j</math>\n\nSince orthogonal transformations preserve inner products, it follows that <math>e_i\\cdot e_j=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}</math> and thus the <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}</math> are perpendicular. In other words, the geometric product of two distinct vectors <math>e_i \\ne e_j</math> is completely specified by their exterior product, or more generally\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rl}e_1e_2\\cdots e_r &= e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_r \\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{1j}a_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{2j}a_j \\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{rj}a_j\\right) \\\\\n&= \\det [\\mathbf{O}] a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r \\end{array}</math>\n\nTherefore, every blade of grade <math>r</math> can be written as a geometric product of <math>r</math> vectors. More generally, if a degenerate geometric algebra is allowed, then the orthogonal matrix is replaced by a [[block matrix]] that is orthogonal in the nondegenerate block, and the diagonal matrix has zero-valued entries along the degenerate dimensions. If the new vectors of the nondegenerate subspace are [[unit vector|normalized]] according to\n\n:<math>\\hat{e}_i=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|e_i \\cdot e_i|}}e_i,</math>\n\nthen these normalized vectors must square to <math>+1</math> or <math>-1</math>. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the total number of <math>+1</math>s and the total number of <math>-1</math>s along the diagonal matrix is invariant. By extension, the total number <math>p</math> of these vectors that square to <math>+1</math> and the total number <math>q</math> that square to <math>-1</math> is invariant. (The total number of basis vectors that square to zero is also invariant, and may be nonzero if the degenerate case is allowed.) We denote this algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(p,q)</math>. For example, <math>\\mathcal G(3,0)</math> models <math>3</math>-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], <math>\\mathcal G(1,3)</math> relativistic [[spacetime]] and <math>\\mathcal G(4,1)</math> a [[conformal geometric algebra]] of a <math>3</math>-dimensional space.\n\nThe set of all possible products of <math>n</math> orthogonal basis vectors with indices in increasing order, including <math>1</math> as the empty product, forms a basis for the entire geometric algebra (an analogue of the [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem|PBW theorem]]). For example, the following is a basis for the geometric algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>:\n:<math>\\{1,e_1,e_2,e_3,e_1e_2,e_1e_3,e_2e_3,e_1e_2e_3\\}</math>\nA basis formed this way is called a '''canonical basis''' for the geometric algebra, and any other orthogonal basis for <math>V</math> will produce another canonical basis. Each canonical basis consists of <math>2^n</math> elements. Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements. If the canonical basis elements are <math>\\{ B_i | i \\in S \\}</math> with <math>S</math> being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is\n:<math> \\left( \\sum_i \\alpha_i B_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_j \\beta_j B_j \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_i\\beta_j B_i B_j .</math>\n\nThe terminology \"<math>k</math>-vector\" is often encountered to describe multivectors containing elements of only one grade. In higher dimensional space, some such multivectors are not blades (cannot be factored into the outer product of <math>k</math> vectors). By way of example, <math> e_1 \\wedge e_2 + e_3 \\wedge e_4 </math> in <math>\\mathcal{G}(4,0)</math> cannot be factored; typically, however, such elements of the algebra do not yield to any geometric interpretation. Only <math> 0,1,(n-1)</math> and <math>n</math>-vectors are always blades in <math>n</math>-space.\n\n===Grade projection===\n\nUsing an orthogonal basis, a [[graded vector space]] structure can be established. Elements of the geometric algebra that are scalar multiples of <math>1</math> are grade-<math>0</math> blades and are called ''scalars''. Multivectors that are in the span of <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\}</math> are grade-<math>1</math> blades and are the ordinary vectors. Multivectors in the span of <math>\\{e_ie_j\\mid 1\\leq i<j\\leq n\\}</math> are grade-<math>2</math> blades and are the bivectors. This terminology continues through to the last grade of <math>n</math>-vectors. Alternatively, grade-<math>n</math> blades are called [[pseudoscalar]]s, grade-<math>(n-1)</math> blades pseudovectors, etc. Many of the elements of the algebra are not graded by this scheme since they are sums of elements of differing grade. Such elements are said to be of ''mixed grade''. The grading of multivectors is independent of the basis chosen originally.\n\nA multivector <math>A</math> may be decomposed with the '''grade-projection operator''' <math>\\langle A \\rangle _r</math>, which outputs the grade-<math>r</math> portion of <math>A</math>. As a result:\n\n:<math> A = \\sum_{r=0}^{n} \\langle A \\rangle _r </math>\n\nAs an example, the geometric product of two vectors <math> a b = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b = \\langle a b \\rangle_0 + \\langle a b \\rangle_2</math> since <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_0=a\\cdot b</math> and <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_2 = a\\wedge b</math> and <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_i=0</math>, for <math>i</math> other than <math>0</math> and <math>2</math>.\n\nThe decomposition of a multivector <math>A</math> may also be split into those components that are even and those that are odd:\n\n:<math> A^{+} = \\langle A \\rangle _0 + \\langle A \\rangle _2 + \\langle A \\rangle _4 + \\cdots </math>\n:<math> A^{-} = \\langle A \\rangle _1 + \\langle A \\rangle _3 + \\langle A \\rangle _5 + \\cdots </math>\n\nThis makes the algebra a <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math>-[[graded algebra]] or [[superalgebra]] with the geometric product. Since the geometric product of two even multivectors is an even multivector, they define an ''[[even subalgebra]]''. The even subalgebra of an <math>n</math>-dimensional geometric algebra is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a full geometric algebra of <math>(n-1)</math> dimensions. Examples include <math>\\mathcal G^{+}(2,0) \\cong \\mathcal{G}(0,1)</math> and <math>\\mathcal{G}^{+}(1,3) \\cong \\mathcal G(3,0)</math>.\n\n===Representation of subspaces===\nGeometric algebra represents subspaces of <math>V</math> as blades, and so they coexist in the same algebra with vectors from <math>V</math>. A <math>k</math>-dimensional subspace <math>W</math> of <math>V</math> is represented by taking an orthogonal basis <math>\\{b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_k\\}</math> and using the geometric product to form the [[blade (geometry)|blade]] <math>D = b_1b_2\\cdots b_k</math>. There are multiple blades representing <math>W</math>; all those representing <math>W</math> are scalar multiples of <math>D</math>. These blades can be separated into two sets: positive multiples of <math>D</math> and negative multiples of <math>D</math>. The positive multiples of <math>D</math> are said to have ''the same [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]'' as <math>D</math>, and the negative multiples the ''opposite orientation''.\n\nBlades are important since geometric operations such as projections, rotations and reflections depend on the factorability via the exterior product that (the restricted class of) <math>n</math>-blades provide but that (the generalized class of) grade-<math>n</math> multivectors do not when <math>n \\ge 4</math>.\n\n===Unit pseudoscalars===\nUnit pseudoscalars are blades that play important roles in GA. A '''unit pseudoscalar''' for a non-degenerate subspace <math>W</math> of <math>V</math> is a blade that is the product of the members of an orthonormal basis for <math>W</math>. It can be shown that if <math>I</math> and <math>I'</math> are both unit pseudoscalars for <math>W</math>, then <math>I = \\pm I'</math> and <math>I^2 = \\pm 1</math>.\n\nSuppose the geometric algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(n,0)</math> with the familiar positive definite inner product on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math> is formed. Given a plane (<math>2</math>-dimensional subspace) of <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>, one can find an orthonormal basis <math>\\{ b_1, b_2 \\}</math> spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar <math>I = b_1 b_2</math> representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of <math>b_1</math> and <math>b_2</math> lies in <math>\\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>, that is, it is the sum of a <math>0</math>-vector and a <math>2</math>-vector.\n\nBy the properties of the geometric product, <math>I^2 = b_1 b_2 b_1 b_2 = -b_1 b_2 b_2 b_1 = -1</math>. The resemblance to the [[imaginary unit]] is not incidental: the subspace <math> \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\} </math> is <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-algebra isomorphic to the [[complex number]]s. In this way, a copy of the complex numbers is embedded in the geometric algebra for each 2-dimensional subspace of <math>V</math> on which the quadratic form is definite.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to <math>-1</math>, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.\n\nIn <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>, a further familiar case occurs. Given a canonical basis consisting of orthonormal vectors <math>e_i</math> of <math>V</math>, the set of ''all'' <math>2</math>-vectors is spanned by\n:<math> \\{ e_3 e_2 , e_1 e_3 , e_2 e_1 \\} .</math>\nLabelling these <math>i</math>, <math>j</math> and <math>k</math> (momentarily deviating from our uppercase convention), the subspace generated by <math>0</math>-vectors and <math>2</math>-vectors is exactly <math> \\{ \\alpha_0 + i \\alpha_1 + j \\alpha_2 + k \\alpha_3 \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}</math>. This set is seen to be a subalgebra of <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>, and furthermore is isomorphic as an <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-algebra to the [[quaternion]]s, another important algebraic system.\n\n===Dual basis===\n\nLet <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math> be a basis of <math>V</math>, i.e. a set of <math>n</math> linearly independent vectors that span the <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space <math>V</math>. The basis that is dual to <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math> is the set of elements of the [[dual vector space]] <math>V^{*}</math> that forms a [[biorthogonal system]] with this basis, thus being the elements denoted <math>\\{ e^1 , \\ldots , e^n \\}</math> satisfying\n:<math>e^i \\cdot e_j = \\delta^i{}_j,</math>\nwhere <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nGiven a nondegenerate quadratic form on <math>V</math>, <math>V^{*}</math> becomes naturally identified with <math>V</math>, and the dual basis may be regarded as elements of <math>V</math>, but are not in general the same set as the original basis.\n\nGiven further a GA of <math>V</math>, let \n:<math> \\epsilon = e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n</math>\nbe the pseudoscalar (which does not necessarily square to <math>\\pm 1</math>) formed from the basis <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math>. The dual basis vectors may be constructed as\n:<math>e^i=(-1)^{i-1}(e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\check{e}_i \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n) \\epsilon^{-1},</math>\nwhere the <math>\\check{e}_i</math> denotes that the <math>i</math>th basis vector is omitted from the product.\n\n===Extensions of the inner and exterior products===\n\nIt is common practice to extend the exterior product on vectors to the entire algebra. This may be done through the use of the grade projection operator:\n\n: <math>C \\wedge D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{r+s} </math> &nbsp; &nbsp; (the ''exterior product'')\n\nThis generalization is consistent with the above definition involving antisymmetrization. Another generalization related to the exterior product is the commutator product:\n: <math>C \\times D := \\tfrac{1}{2}(CD-DC) </math> &nbsp; &nbsp; (the ''commutator product'')\n\nThe regressive product (usually referred to as the \"meet\") is the dual of the exterior product (or \"join\" in this context).{{efn|...the outer product operation and the join relation have essentially the same meaning. The [[Grassmann–Cayley algebra]] regards the meet relation as its counterpart and gives a unifying framework in which these two operations have equal footing...Grassmann himself defined the meet operation as the dual of the outer product operation, but later mathematicians defined the meet operator independently of the outer product through a process called [[Shuffle algebra|shuffle]], and the meet operation is termed the shuffle product. It is shown that this is an antisymmetric operation that satisfies associativity, defining an algebra in its own right. Thus, the Grassmann–Cayley algebra has two algebraic structures simultaneously:one based on the outer product (or join), the other based on the shuffle product (or meet). Hence, the name “double algebra,” and the two are shown to be dual to each other{{sfn|Kanatani|2015|p=112-113}}}} The dual specification of elements permits, for blades <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, the intersection (or meet) where the duality is to be taken relative to the smallest grade blade containing both <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> (the join).{{sfn|Dorst|Lasenby|2011|p=443}}\n:\n: <math>C \\vee D := ((CI^{-1}) \\wedge (DI^{-1}))I </math>\nwith <math>I</math> the unit pseudoscalar of the algebra. The regressive product, like the exterior product, is associative.{{sfn|Vaz|da Rocha|2016|loc=§2.8}}\n\nThe inner product on vectors can also be generalized, but in more than one non-equivalent way. The paper {{Harvard citation|Dorst|2002}} gives a full treatment of several different inner products developed for geometric algebras and their interrelationships, and the notation is taken from there. Many authors use the same symbol as for the inner product of vectors for their chosen extension (e.g. Hestenes and Perwass). No consistent notation has emerged.\n\nAmong these several different generalizations of the inner product on vectors are:\n\n: <math> C \\;\\rfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{s-r} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''left contraction'')\n: <math> C \\;\\lfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{r-s} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''right contraction'')\n: <math> C * D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{0} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''scalar product'')\n: <math> C \\bullet D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{|s-r|} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the \"(fat) dot\" product){{efn|\nThis should not be confused with Hestenes's irregular generalization <math>\\textstyle C \\bullet_H D := \\sum_{r\\ne0,s\\ne0}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{|s-r|} </math>, where the distinguishing notation is from {{harvp|Dorst|Fontijne|Mann|2007|loc=§B.1 p. 590|ps=, which makes the point that scalar components must be handled separately with this product.}}}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Dorst|2002}} makes an argument for the use of contractions in preference to Hestenes's inner product; they are algebraically more regular and have cleaner geometric interpretations. \nA number of identities incorporating the contractions are valid without restriction of their inputs.\nFor example,\n\n:<math> C \\;\\rfloor\\; D = ( C \\wedge ( D I^{-1} ) ) I </math>\n:<math> C \\;\\lfloor\\; D = I ( ( I^{-1} C) \\wedge D ) </math>\n:<math> ( A \\wedge B ) * C = A * ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) </math>\n:<math> C * ( B \\wedge A ) = ( C \\;\\lfloor\\; B ) * A </math> \n:<math> A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) = ( A \\wedge B ) \\;\\rfloor\\; C </math>\n:<math> ( A \\;\\rfloor\\; B ) \\;\\lfloor\\; C = A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\lfloor\\; C ) .</math>\n\nBenefits of using the left contraction as an extension of the inner product on vectors include that the identity <math> ab = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b </math> is extended to <math> aB = a \\;\\rfloor\\; B + a \\wedge B</math> for any vector <math>a</math> and multivector <math>B</math>, and that the [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] operation <math> \\mathcal{P}_b (a) = (a \\cdot b^{-1})b </math> is extended to <math> \\mathcal{P}_B (A) = (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B</math> for any blade <math>B</math> and any multivector <math>A</math> (with a minor modification to accommodate null <math>B</math>, given [[#Projection and rejection|below]]).\n\n===Linear functions===\nAlthough versors are easier to work with because they can be directly represented in the algebra as multivectors, they are a subgroup of [[linear function]]s on multivectors and these can still be used when necessary. The geometric algebra of an <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space is spanned by a basis of <math>2^n</math> elements. If a multivector is represented by a <math>2^n \\times 1</math> real [[column matrix]] in terms of a basis, then all linear transformations of the multivector can be expressed as the [[matrix multiplication]] by a <math>2^n \\times 2^n</math> real matrix. However, such a general linear transformation allows arbitrary exchanges among grades, such as a \"rotation\" of a scalar into a vector, which has no evident geometric interpretation.\n\nA general linear transformation from vectors to vectors is of interest. With the natural restriction to preserving the induced exterior algebra, the ''[[outermorphism]]'' of the linear transformation is its unique extension.

(see [[History of elementary algebra#Greek geometric algebra|Greek geometric algebra]]), GA in the sense used in this article was not developed until 1844, when it was used in a ''systematic way'' to describe the geometrical properties and ''transformations'' of a space. In that year, [[Hermann Grassmann]] introduced the idea of a geometrical algebra in full generality as a certain calculus (analogous to the [[propositional calculus]]) that encoded all of the geometrical information of a space.{{sfn|Grassmann|1844}} Grassmann's algebraic system could be applied to a number of different kinds of spaces, the chief among them being [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]], and [[projective space]]. Following Grassmann, in 1878 [[William Kingdon Clifford]] examined Grassmann's algebraic system alongside the [[quaternions]] of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in {{Harvard citation|Clifford|1878}}. From his point of view, the quaternions described certain ''transformations'' (which he called ''rotors''), whereas Grassmann's algebra described certain ''properties'' (or ''Strecken'' such as length, area, and volume). His contribution was to define a new product —&nbsp;the ''geometric product''&nbsp;– on an existing Grassmann algebra, which realized the quaternions as living within that algebra. Subsequently, [[Rudolf Lipschitz]] in 1886 generalized Clifford's interpretation of the quaternions and applied them to the geometry of rotations in <math>n</math> dimensions. Later these developments would lead other 20th-century mathematicians to formalize and explore the properties of the Clifford algebra.\n\nNevertheless, another revolutionary development of the 19th-century would completely overshadow the geometric algebras: that of [[vector analysis]], developed independently by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]]. Vector analysis was motivated by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s studies of [[electromagnetism]], and specifically the need to express and manipulate conveniently certain [[differential equation]]s. Vector analysis had a certain intuitive appeal compared to the rigors of the new algebras. Physicists and mathematicians alike readily adopted it as their geometrical toolkit of choice, particularly following the influential 1901 textbook ''[[Vector Analysis]]'' by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]], following lectures of Gibbs.\n\nIn more detail, there have been three approaches to geometric algebra: [[quaternion]]ic analysis, initiated by Hamilton in 1843 and geometrized as rotors by Clifford in 1878; geometric algebra, initiated by Grassmann in 1844; and vector analysis, developed out of quaternionic analysis in the late 19th century by Gibbs and Heaviside. The legacy of quaternionic analysis in vector analysis can be seen in the use of <math>i</math>, <math>j</math>, <math>k</math> to indicate the basis vectors of <math>\\mathbf{R}^3</math>: it is being thought of as the purely imaginary quaternions. From the perspective of geometric algebra, [[Quaternion#Quaternions as the even part of Cℓ3,0(R)|quaternions can be identified as {{nowrap|<math>G_{1,3}^{+}</math>('''R''')}}]], the even part of the Clifford algebra on Euclidean 3-space, which unifies the three approaches.\n\n;20th century and present\n\nProgress on the study of Clifford algebras quietly advanced through the twentieth century, although largely due to the work of [[abstract algebra]]ists such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Claude Chevalley]]. The ''geometrical'' approach to geometric algebras has seen a number of 20th-century revivals. In mathematics, [[Emil Artin]]'s ''Geometric Algebra''{{sfn|Artin|1957}} discusses the algebra associated with each of a number of geometries, including [[affine geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], and [[orthogonal geometry]]. In physics, geometric algebras have been revived as a \"new\" way to do classical mechanics and electromagnetism, together with more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and gauge theory.{{sfn|Doran|1994}} [[David Hestenes]] reinterpreted the Pauli and Dirac matrices as vectors in ordinary space and spacetime, respectively, and has been a primary contemporary advocate for the use of geometric algebra.\n\nIn [[computer graphics]] and robotics, geometric algebras have been revived in order to efficiently represent rotations and other transformations. For applications of GA in robotics (screw theory, kinematics and dynamics using versors), computer vision, control and neural computing (geometric learning) see Bayro (2010).\n\n==Software==\nGA is a very application-oriented subject. There is a reasonably steep initial learning curve associated with it, but this can be eased somewhat by the use of applicable software.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-dimensional_gamma_matrices",
      "text": "In [[mathematical physics]], '''higher-dimensional gamma matrices''' generalize to arbitrary dimension the four-dimensional [[Gamma matrices]] of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], which are a mainstay of relativistic quantum mechanics.  They are utilized in relativistically invariant wave equations for fermions (such as spinors)  in arbitrary space-time dimensions, notably in string theory and supergravity.\n\nConsider a space-time of dimension {{mvar|d}} with the flat [[Minkowski metric]],  \n: <math> \\eta = \\parallel \\eta_{a b} \\parallel = \\text{diag}(+1,-1, \\dots, -1) ~,\n</math>\nwhere {{math| ''a,b'' {{=}} 0,1,  ..., ''d''−1}}.  Set  {{math| ''N''{{=}} 2<sup>⌊''d''/2⌋</sup>}}.  The standard Dirac matrices correspond to taking {{math|''d'' {{=}} ''N'' {{=}} 4}}.\n\nThe higher gamma matrices are a {{mvar|d}}-long sequence of complex {{math|''N''×''N''}} matrices <math>\\Gamma_i,\\ i=0,\\ldots,d-1</math> which satisfy the [[Anticommutator#Ring theory|anticommutator]] relation from the [[Clifford algebra#Physics|Clifford algebra]] {{math|''Cℓ''<sub>''1,d−1''</sub>('''R''')}} (generating a representation for it), \n: <math> \\{ \\Gamma_a ~,~ \\Gamma_b \\} = \\Gamma_a\\Gamma_b + \\Gamma_b\\Gamma_a = 2 \\eta_{a b} I_N ~,</math>\nwhere {{math|''I<sub>N</sub>''}} is the [[identity matrix]] in {{mvar|N}}  dimensions. (The  spinors acted on by these matrices have {{mvar|N}} components in {{mvar|d}} dimensions.)  Such a sequence exists for all values of {{mvar|d}} and can be constructed explicitly, as provided below.\n\nThe gamma matrices have the following property under hermitian conjugation,\n: <math> \\Gamma_0^\\dagger= +\\Gamma_0 ~,~ \\Gamma_i^\\dagger= -\\Gamma_i\n~(i=1,\\dots,d-1) ~. </math>\n\n== Charge conjugation ==\nSince the groups  generated by {{math|  ''Γ<sub>a</sub>,  −Γ<sub>a</sub><sup>T</sup>,  Γ<sub>a</sub><sup>T</sup>''}}  are the same, we can look for a [[matrix similarity|similarity transformation]] which connects them all. This transformation is generated by a respective [[charge conjugation]] matrix.\n\nExplicitly, we  can introduce the following matrices\n: <math> C_{(+)} \\Gamma_a  C_{(+)}^{-1} = + \\Gamma_a^T </math>\n: <math> C_{(-)} \\Gamma_a  C_{(-)}^{-1} = - \\Gamma_a^T ~.</math>\n\nThey can be constructed as real matrices in various dimensions, as the following table shows.

The paragradient in the standard paravector basis is\n:<math>\n  \\partial = \\mathbf{e}_0 \\partial_0 - \\mathbf{e}_1 \\partial_1 - \\mathbf{e}_2 \\partial_2 - \\mathbf{e}_3 \\partial_3,\n</math>\nwhich allows one to write the [[d'Alembert operator]] as\n:<math>\n \\square =  \\langle \\bar{\\partial} \\partial \\rangle_S =  \\langle \\partial \\bar{\\partial} \\rangle_S\n</math>\n\nThe standard gradient operator can be defined naturally as\n:<math>\n\\nabla = \\mathbf{e}_1 \\partial_1 + \\mathbf{e}_2 \\partial_2 + \\mathbf{e}_3 \\partial_3,\n</math>\nso that the paragradient can be written as\n:<math> \n \\partial = \\partial_0 - \\nabla,\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\mathbf{e}_0 = 1</math>.\n\nThe application of the paragradient operator must be done carefully, always respecting its non-commutative nature. For example, a widely used derivative is \n:<math>\n\\partial e^{ f(x) \\mathbf{e}_3 } = \n (\\partial f(x)) e^{ f(x) \\mathbf{e}_3 } \\mathbf{e}_3,\n</math>\nwhere <math>f(x)</math> is a scalar function of the coordinates.\n\nThe paragradient is an operator that always acts from the left if the function is a scalar function. However, if the function is not scalar, the paragradient can act from the right as well. For example, the following expression is expanded as\n:<math>  (L \\partial) = \n \\mathbf{e}_0 \\partial_0 L +   (\\partial_1 L) \\mathbf{e}_1 +\n (\\partial_2 L)\\mathbf{e}_2  +  (\\partial_3 L) \\mathbf{e}_3 \n  </math>\n\n===Null Paravectors as Projectors===\nNull paravectors are elements that are not necessarily zero but have magnitude identical to zero.

      "text": "{{Short description|Geometric symmetry operation}}{{Refimprove|date=April 2010}}\n{{hatnote|Not to be confused with [[inversive geometry]], in which inversion is through a circle instead of a point.}}\n[[File:Cyclic symmetry 2.svg|thumb|A point reflection in 2 dimensions is the same as a 180° rotation.]]\nIn [[geometry]], a '''point reflection''' or '''inversion in a point''' (or '''inversion through a point''', or '''central inversion''') is a type of [[isometry]] of [[Euclidean space]]. An object that is invariant under a point reflection is said to possess '''point symmetry'''; if it is invariant under point reflection through its center, it is said to possess '''central symmetry''' or to be '''[[Centrosymmetry|centrally symmetric]].'''\n\nPoint reflection can be classified as an [[affine transformation]]. Namely, it is an [[isometry|isometric]] [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] affine transformation, which has exactly one [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is the point of inversion. It is equivalent to a [[homothetic transformation]] with scale factor equal to −1. The point of inversion is also called [[homothetic center]].\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term ''reflection'' is loose, and considered by some an abuse of language, with ''inversion'' preferred; however, ''point reflection'' is widely used. Such maps are [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]s, meaning that they have order 2 – they are their own inverse: applying them twice yields the [[Identity function|identity map]] – which is also true of other maps called ''reflections''. More narrowly, a ''[[reflection (linear algebra)|reflection]]'' refers to a reflection in a [[hyperplane]] (<math>n-1</math> dimensional [[affine subspace]] – a point on the [[line (geometry)|line]], a line in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]], a plane in 3-space), with the hyperplane being fixed, but more broadly ''reflection'' is applied to any involution of Euclidean space, and the fixed set (an affine space of dimension ''k'', where <math>1 \\leq k \\leq n-1</math>) is called the ''mirror''. In dimension 1 these coincide, as a point is a hyperplane in the line.\n\nIn terms of linear algebra, assuming the origin is fixed, involutions are exactly the [[diagonalizable]] maps with all [[eigenvalue]]s either 1 or −1. Reflection in a hyperplane has a single &minus;1 eigenvalue (and multiplicity <math>n-1</math> on the 1 eigenvalue), while point reflection has only the −1 eigenvalue (with multiplicity ''n'').\n\nThe term ''inversion'' should not be confused with [[inversive geometry]], where ''inversion'' is defined with respect to a circle.\n\n== Examples ==\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ 2D examples\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Hexagonal parallelogon.png|180px]]<BR>Hexagonal [[parallelogon]]\n|[[File:Octagon g2 symmetry.png|120px]]<BR>[[Octagon]]\n|}\nIn two dimensions, a point reflection is the same as a [[rotation]] of 180 degrees.  In three dimensions, a point reflection can be described as a 180-degree rotation [[composition of functions|composed]] with reflection across a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation.  In dimension ''n'', point reflections are [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-preserving if ''n'' is even, and orientation-reversing if ''n'' is odd.\n\n== Formula ==\nGiven a vector '''a''' in the Euclidean space '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, the formula for the reflection of '''a''' across the point '''p''' is\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{Ref}_\\mathbf{p}(\\mathbf{a}) = 2\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{a}.</math>\n\nIn the case where '''p''' is the origin, point reflection is simply the negation of the vector '''a'''.\n\nIn [[Euclidean geometry]], the '''inversion''' of a [[point (geometry)|point]] ''X'' with respect to a point ''P'' is a point ''X''* such that ''P'' is the midpoint of the [[line segment]] with endpoints ''X'' and ''X''*. In other words, the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] from ''X'' to ''P'' is the same as the vector from ''P'' to ''X''*.\n\nThe formula for the inversion in ''P'' is\n\n:'''x'''* = 2'''a''' − '''x'''\n\nwhere '''a''', '''x''' and '''x'''* are the position vectors of ''P'', ''X'' and ''X''* respectively.\n\nThis [[function (mathematics)|mapping]] is an [[isometry|isometric]] [[Involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[affine transformation]] which has exactly one [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]], which is ''P''.\n\n==Point reflection as a special case of uniform scaling or homothety==\nWhen the inversion point ''P'' coincides with the origin, point reflection is equivalent to a special case of [[uniform scaling]]: uniform scaling with scale factor equal to −1. This is an example of [[linear transformation]].\n\nWhen ''P'' does not coincide with the origin, point reflection is equivalent to a special case of [[homothetic transformation]]: homothety with [[homothetic center]] coinciding with P, and scale factor −1. This is an example of non-linear [[affine transformation]]).\n\n==Point reflection group==\n[[Image:Composing Point Reflections.png|thumbnail|The composition of two offset point reflections in 2-dimensions is a translation.]]\nThe [[composition of functions|composition]] of two point reflections is a [[translation (geometry)|translation]].  Specifically, point reflection at '''p''' followed by point reflection at '''q''' is translation by the vector 2('''q''' − '''p''').\n\nThe set consisting of all point reflections and translations is [[Lie subgroup]] of the [[Euclidean group]].  It is a [[semidirect product]] of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> with a [[cyclic group]] of order 2, the latter acting on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> by negation.  It is precisely the subgroup of the Euclidean group that fixes the [[line at infinity]] pointwise.\n\nIn the case ''n'' = 1, the point reflection group is the full [[Euclidean group|isometry group]] of the line.\n\n==Point reflections in mathematics==\n* Point reflection across the center of a sphere yields the [[antipodal map]].\n* A [[Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric space]] is a [[Riemannian manifold]] with an isometric reflection across each point.  Symmetric spaces play an important role in the study of [[Lie group]]s and [[Riemannian geometry]].\n\n==Point reflection in analytic geometry==\nGiven the point <math>P(x,y)</math> and its reflection <math>P'(x',y')</math> with respect to the point <math>C(x_c,y_c)</math>, the latter is the [[midpoint]] of the segment <math>\\overline{PP'}</math>;\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}x_c=\\frac{x+x'}{2} \\\\ y_c=\\frac{y+y'}{2}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nHence, the equations to find the coordinates of the reflected point are\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}x'=2x_c-x \\\\ y'=2y_c-y\\end{cases}</math>\n\nParticular is the case in which the point C has coordinates <math>(0,0)</math> (see the [[Point reflection#Inversion with respect to the origin | paragraph below]])\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}x'=-x \\\\ y'=-y\\end{cases}</math>\n\n== Properties ==\nIn even-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], say 2''N''-dimensional space, the inversion in a point ''P'' is equivalent to ''N'' rotations over angles {{pi}} in each plane of an arbitrary set of ''N'' mutually orthogonal planes intersecting at ''P''. These rotations are mutually commutative. Therefore, inversion in a point in even-dimensional space is an orientation-preserving isometry or [[Euclidean group|direct isometry]].\n\nIn odd-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], say (2''N''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-dimensional space, it is equivalent to ''N'' rotations over {{pi}} in each plane of an arbitrary set of ''N'' mutually orthogonal planes intersecting at ''P'', combined with the reflection in the 2''N''-dimensional subspace spanned by these rotation planes. Therefore, it ''reverses'' rather than preserves [[Orientation (mathematics)|orientation]], it is an [[Euclidean group|indirect isometry]].\n\nGeometrically in 3D it amounts to [[rotation]] about an axis through ''P'' by an angle of 180°, combined with reflection in the plane through ''P'' which is perpendicular to the axis; the result does not depend on the [[orientation (rigid body)|orientation]] (in the other sense) of the axis. Notations for the type of operation, or the type of group it generates, are <math>\\overline{1}</math>, ''C''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''S''<sub>2</sub>, and 1&times;. The group type is one of the three [[symmetry group]] types in 3D without any pure [[rotational symmetry]], see [[cyclic symmetries]] with ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nThe following [[point groups in three dimensions]] contain inversion:\n*''C''<sub>''n''h</sub> and ''D''<sub>''n''h</sub> for even ''n''\n*''S''<sub>2''n''</sub> and ''D''<sub>''n''d</sub> for odd ''n''\n*''T''<sub>h</sub>, ''O''<sub>h</sub>, and ''I''<sub>h</sub>\n\nClosely related to inverse in a point is [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in respect to a [[plane (geometry)|plane]], which can be thought of as a \"inversion in a plane\".\n\n==Inversion with respect to the origin==\n\nInversion with respect to the origin corresponds to [[additive inverse|additive inversion]] of the position vector, and also to [[scalar multiplication]] by &minus;1. The operation commutes with every other [[linear transformation]], but not with [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]: it is in the [[Center (group theory)|center]] of the [[general linear group]]. \"Inversion\" without indicating \"in a point\", \"in a line\" or \"in a plane\", means this inversion; in physics 3-dimensional reflection through the origin is also called a [[Parity (physics)|parity transformation]].\n\nIn mathematics, '''reflection through the origin''' refers to the point reflection of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> across the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] of the [[Cartesian coordinate system]].  Reflection through the origin is an [[orthogonal transformation]] corresponding to [[scalar multiplication]] by <math>-1</math>, and can also be written as <math>-I</math>, where <math>I</math> is the [[identity matrix]].  In three dimensions, this sends <math>(x, y, z) \\mapsto (-x, -y, -z)</math>, and so forth.\n\n===Representations===\nAs a [[scalar matrix]], it is represented in every basis by a matrix with <math>-1</math> on the diagonal, and, together with the identity, is the [[Center (group theory)|center]] of the [[orthogonal group]] <math>O(n)</math>.\n\nIt is a product of ''n'' orthogonal reflections (reflection through the axes of any [[orthogonal basis]]); note that orthogonal reflections commute.\n\nIn 2 dimensions, it is in fact rotation by 180 degrees, and in dimension <math>2n</math>, it is rotation by 180 degrees in ''n'' orthogonal planes;<ref group=\"note\">\"Orthogonal planes\" meaning all elements are orthogonal and the planes intersect at 0 only, not that they intersect in a line and have [[dihedral angle]] 90°.</ref> note again that rotations in orthogonal planes commute.\n\n===Properties===\nIt has determinant <math>(-1)^n</math> (from the representation by a matrix or as a product of reflections). Thus it is orientation-preserving in even dimension, thus an element of the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2''n''), and it is orientation-reversing in odd dimension, thus not an element of SO(2''n&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) and instead providing a [[split short exact sequence|splitting]] of the map <math>O(2n+1) \\to \\pm 1</math>, showing that <math>O(2n + 1) = SO(2n + 1) \\times \\{\\pm I\\}</math> as an [[internal direct product]].\n\n* Together with the identity, it forms the [[center (group theory)|center]] of the [[orthogonal group]].\n* It preserves every quadratic form, meaning <math>Q(-v) = Q(v)</math>, and thus is an element of every [[indefinite orthogonal group]] as well.\n* It equals the identity if and only if the characteristic is 2.\n* It is the [[Longest element of a Coxeter group|longest element]] of the [[Coxeter group]] of [[signed permutations]].\n\nAnalogously, it is a longest element of the orthogonal group, with respect to the generating set of reflections: elements of the orthogonal group all have [[length function|length]] at most ''n'' with respect to the generating set of reflections,<ref group=\"note\">This follows by classifying orthogonal transforms as direct sums of rotations and reflections, which follows from the [[spectral theorem]], for instance.</ref> and reflection through the origin has length ''n,'' though it is not unique in this: other maximal combinations of rotations (and possibly reflections) also have maximal length.\n\n===Geometry===\nIn SO(2''r''), reflection through the origin is the farthest point from the identity element with respect to the usual metric. In O(2''r'' + 1), reflection through the origin is not in SO(2''r''+1) (it is in the non-identity component), and there is no natural sense in which it is a \"farther point\" than any other point in the non-identity component, but it does provide a [[base point]] in the other component.\n\n===Clifford algebras and spin groups===\n{{Further|Clifford algebra}}\n{{Further|Spin group}}\nIt should ''not'' be confused with the element <math>-1 \\in \\mathrm{Spin}(n)</math> in the [[spin group]]. This is particularly confusing for even spin groups, as <math>-I \\in SO(2n)</math>, and thus in <math>\\operatorname{Spin}(n)</math> there is both <math>-1</math> and 2 lifts of <math>-I</math>.\n\nReflection through the identity extends to an automorphism of a [[Clifford algebra]], called the ''main involution'' or ''grade involution.''\n\nReflection through the identity lifts to a [[pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)|pseudoscalar]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Affine involution]]\n* [[Circle inversion]]\n* [[Clifford algebra]]\n* [[Congruence (geometry)]]\n* [[Euclidean group]]\n* [[Orthogonal group]]\n* [[Parity (physics)]]\n* [[Reflection (mathematics)]]\n* [[Riemannian symmetric space]]\n* [[Spin group]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Euclidean symmetries]]\n[[Category:Functions and mappings]]\n[[Category:Clifford algebras]]\n[[Category:Quadratic forms]]"

The prototypical example of a pseudoscalar is the [[scalar triple product]], which can be written as the scalar product between one of the vectors in the triple product and the cross product between the two other vectors, where the latter is a pseudovector. A pseudoscalar, when multiplied by an ordinary [[vector space|vector]], becomes a [[pseudovector|pseudovector (axial vector)]]; a similar construction creates the [[pseudotensor]].\n\nMathematically, a pseudoscalar is an element of the top [[exterior power]] of a [[vector space]], or the top power of a [[Clifford algebra]]; see [[pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)]].   More generally, it is an element of the [[canonical bundle]] of a [[differentiable manifold]].\n\n==Pseudoscalars in physics==\nIn [[physics]], a pseudoscalar denotes a [[physical quantity]] analogous to a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]]. Both are [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] which assume a single value which is invariant under [[proper rotation]]s. However, under the [[parity transformation]], pseudoscalars flip their signs while scalars do not. As [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s through a plane are the combination of a rotation with the parity transformation, pseudoscalars also change signs under reflections.\n\nOne of the most powerful ideas in physics is that physical laws do not change when one changes the coordinate system used to describe these laws. That a pseudoscalar reverses its sign when the coordinate axes are inverted suggests that it is not the best object to describe a physical quantity. In 3-space, quantities described by a pseudovector are anti-symmetric tensors of order 2, which are invariant under inversion. The pseudovector may be a simpler representation of that quantity, but suffers from the change of sign under inversion. Similarly, in 3-space, the [[Hodge dual]] of a scalar is equal to a constant times the 3-dimensional [[Levi-Civita symbol|Levi-Civita pseudotensor]] (or \"permutation\" pseudotensor); whereas the Hodge dual of a pseudoscalar is an anti-symmetric (pure) tensor of order three.  The Levi-Civita pseudotensor is a completely [[antisymmetric tensor|anti-symmetric]] pseudotensor of order 3. Since the dual of the pseudoscalar is the product of two \"pseudo-quantities\", the resulting tensor is a true tensor, and does not change sign upon an inversion of axes. The situation is similar to the situation for pseudovectors and anti-symmetric tensors of order 2. The dual of a pseudovector is an anti-symmetric tensor of order 2 (and vice versa). The tensor is an invariant physical quantity under a coordinate inversion, while the pseudovector is not invariant.\n\nThe situation can be extended to any dimension. Generally in an ''n''-dimensional space the Hodge dual of an order ''r'' tensor will be an anti-symmetric pseudotensor of order {{nowrap|(''n'' − ''r'')}} and vice versa. In particular, in the four-dimensional spacetime of special relativity, a pseudoscalar is the dual of a fourth-order tensor and is proportional to the four-dimensional [[Levi-Civita symbol|Levi-Civita pseudotensor]].\n\n===Example pseudoscalars===\n* [[Magnetic charge]] is a pseudoscalar as it is mathematically defined, regardless of whether it exists physically.\n* [[Magnetic flux]] is the result of a [[dot product]] between a vector (the [[surface normal]]) and pseudovector (the [[magnetic field]]).\n* [[Helicity (particle physics)|Helicity]] is the projection (dot product) of a [[spin (physics)|spin]] pseudovector onto the direction of [[momentum]] (a true vector).\n* Pseudoscalar particles, i.e. particles with spin 0 and odd parity, that is, a particle with no intrinsic spin with [[wave function]] that changes sign under [[Parity (physics)|parity inversion]]. Examples are [[pseudoscalar meson]]s.\n\n==Pseudoscalars in geometric algebra==\n{{See also|Pseudoscalar (Clifford algebra)}}\n\nA pseudoscalar in a [[geometric algebra]] is a highest-[[graded vector space|grade]] element of the algebra.  For example, in two dimensions there are two orthogonal basis vectors, <math>e_1</math>, <math>e_2</math> and the associated highest-grade basis element is\n\n:<math>e_1 e_2 = e_{12}.</math>\n\nSo a pseudoscalar is a multiple of ''e''<sub>12</sub>.  The element ''e''<sub>12</sub> squares to −1 and commutes with all even elements – behaving therefore like the imaginary scalar ''i'' in the [[complex numbers]]. It is these scalar-like properties which give rise to its name.\n\nIn this setting, a pseudoscalar changes sign under a parity inversion, since if\n\n:(''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>) &rarr; (''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nis a change of basis representing an orthogonal transformation, then\n\n:''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub> &rarr; ''u''<sub>1</sub>''u''<sub>2</sub> = ±''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>,\n\nwhere the sign depends on the determinant of the transformation.  Pseudoscalars in geometric algebra thus correspond to the pseudoscalars in physics.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]\n[[Category:Clifford algebras]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]"

This algebra is also known as the <math>\\mathcal{C} \\ell_{6, 3}</math> Clifford algebra. QGA is a super-algebra over <math>\\mathcal{G}_{4, 1}</math> Conformal Geometric Algebra (CGA) and <math>\\mathcal{G}_{1, 3}</math> Spacetime Algebra (STA), which can each be defined within sub-algebras of QGA.\n\nCGA provides representations of spherical entities (points, spheres, planes, and lines) and a complete set of operations (translation, rotation, dilation, and intersection) that apply to them. QGA extends CGA to also include representations of some non-spherical entities: principal axes-aligned quadric surfaces and many of their degenerate forms such as planes, lines, and points.\n\nGeneral quadric surfaces are characterized by the implicit polynomial equation of degree 2\n\n:<math>\n  A x^2 + B y^2 + C z^2 + D x y + E y z + F z x + G x + H y + I z + J = 0.\n</math>\n\nwhich can characterize quadric surfaces located at any center point and aligned along arbitrary axes. However, QGA includes vector entities that can represent only the principal axes-aligned quadric surfaces characterized by\n\n:<math>\n  A x^2 + B y^2 + C z^2 + G x + H y + I z + J = 0.\n</math>\n\nThis is still a very significant advancement over CGA.\n\nA possible performance issue with using QGA is the increased computation required to use a 9D vector space, as compared to the smaller 5D vector space of CGA. A 5D CGA subspace can be used when only CGA entities are involved in computations.\n\nThe operations that work correctly with the QGA axes-aligned quadric entities include translation, transposition, dilation, and intersection.\n\nIn general, the operation of rotation <span><span><span>''does not work''</span></span></span> correctly on non-spherical QGA quadric surface entities. Rotation also does not work correctly on the QGA point entities. Attempting to rotate a QGA quadric surface may result in a different type of quadric surface, or a quadric surface that is rotated and distorted in an unexpected way. Attempting to rotate a QGA point may produce a value that projects as the expected rotated vector, but the produced value is generally not a correct embedding of the rotated vector. The failure of QGA points to rotate correctly also leads to the inability to use outermorphisms to rotate dual Geometric Outer Product Null Space (GOPNS) entities. To rotate a QGA point, it must be projected to a vector or converted to a CGA point for rotation operations, then the rotated result can be re-embedded or converted back into a QGA point. A quadric surface rotated by an arbitrary angle cannot be represented by any known QGA entity. Representation of general quadric surfaces with useful operations will require an algebra (that appears to be unknown at this time) that extends QGA.\n\nAlthough rotation is generally unavailable in QGA, the transposition operation is a special-case modification of rotation by <math>\\pi / 2</math> that works correctly on all QGA GIPNS entities. Transpositions allow QGA GIPNS entities to be reflected in the six diagonal planes <math>y = \\pm x</math>, <math>z = \\pm x</math>, and <math>z = \\pm y</math>.\n\nEntities for all principal axes-aligned quadric surfaces can be defined in QGA. These include ellipsoids, cylinders, cones, paraboloids, and hyperboloids in all of their various forms.\n\nA powerful feature of QGA is the ability to compute the intersections of axes-aligned quadric surfaces. With few exceptions, the outer product of QGA GIPNS surface entities represents their surfaces intersection(s). This method of computing intersections works the same as it does in CGA, where only spherical entities are available.\n\n== References ==\nJulio Zamora-Esquivel. \"G6,3 Geometric Algebra; Description and Implementation.\" Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras 24 (2014), 493-514.

These properties allow many of the most important equations in physics to be expressed in particularly simple forms, and can be very helpful towards a more geometric understanding of their meanings.\n\n==Structure==\nThe spacetime algebra may be built up from an orthogonal basis of one time-like vector <math>\\gamma_0</math> and three space-like vectors, <math>\\{\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3\\}</math>, with the multiplication rule\n:<math> \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu + \\gamma_\\nu \\gamma_\\mu = 2 \\eta_{\\mu \\nu} </math>\nwhere <math>\\eta_{\\mu \\nu}</math> is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature {{nowrap|(+ &minus; &minus; &minus;)}}.\n\nThus, <math>\\gamma_0^2 = {+1}</math>, <math>\\gamma_1^2 = \\gamma_2^2 = \\gamma_3^2 = {-1}</math>, otherwise <math>\\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_\\nu = - \\gamma_\\nu \\gamma_\\mu</math>.\n\nThe basis vectors <math>\\gamma_k</math> share these properties with the [[Dirac matrix|Dirac matrices]], but no explicit matrix representation need be used in STA.\n\nThis generates a basis of one [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] <math>\\{1\\}</math>, four [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s <math>\\{\\gamma_0, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2, \\gamma_3\\}</math>, six [[bivector]]s <math>\\{\\gamma_0\\gamma_1, \\, \\gamma_0\\gamma_2,\\, \\gamma_0\\gamma_3, \\, \\gamma_1\\gamma_2, \\, \\gamma_2\\gamma_3, \\, \\gamma_3\\gamma_1\\}</math>, four [[pseudovector]]s <math>\\{i\\gamma_0, i\\gamma_1, i\\gamma_2, i\\gamma_3\\}</math> and one [[pseudoscalar]] <math>\\{i\\}</math>, where <math>i=\\gamma_0 \\gamma_1 \\gamma_2 \\gamma_3</math>.\n\n==Reciprocal frame==\nAssociated with the orthogonal basis <math>\\{\\gamma_\\mu\\}</math> is the reciprocal basis <math>\\{\\gamma^\\mu = {\\gamma_\\mu}^{-1}\\}</math> for \n<math>\\mu = 0, \\dots, 3</math>, satisfying the relation\n:<math>\\gamma_\\mu \\cdot \\gamma^\\nu = {\\delta_\\mu}^\\nu .</math>\nThese reciprocal frame vectors differ only by a sign, with <math>\\gamma^0 = \\gamma_0</math>, and <math>\\gamma^k = -\\gamma_k</math> for <math>k = 1, \\dots, 3</math>.\n\nA vector may be represented in either upper or lower index coordinates <math>a = a^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu = a_\\mu \\gamma^\\mu</math> with summation over <math>\\mu = 0, \\dots, 3</math>, according to the [[Einstein notation]], where the coordinates may be extracted by taking dot products with the basis vectors or their reciprocals.\n:<math>\\begin{align}a \\cdot \\gamma^\\nu &= a^\\nu \\\\ a \\cdot \\gamma_\\nu &= a_\\nu .\\end{align}</math>\n\n==Spacetime gradient==\n\nThe spacetime gradient, like the gradient in a Euclidean space, is defined such that the [[directional derivative]] relationship is satisfied:\n\n:<math>a \\cdot \\nabla F(x)= \\lim_{\\tau \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{F(x + a\\tau) - F(x)}{\\tau} .</math>\n\nThis requires the definition of the gradient to be\n:<math> \\nabla = \\gamma^\\mu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^\\mu} = \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu .</math>\n\nWritten out explicitly with <math>x = ct \\gamma_0 + x^k \\gamma_k</math>, these partials are\n:<math> \\partial_0 = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\quad \\partial_k = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial {x^k}} </math>\n\n==Spacetime split==\n{| style=\"margin:0 1em 1em; text-align:left; border:1px solid black; padding:10px; float:right;\"\n|-\n|<u>Spacetime split – examples:</u>\n|-\n|<math>x \\gamma_0 = x^0 + \\mathbf{x}</math>\n|-\n|<math>p \\gamma_0 = E + \\mathbf{p}</math><ref name=\"lasenby-et-el-2002-p257\">A.

Arthur: ''Understanding Geometric Algebra for Electromagnetic Theory (IEEE Press Series on Electromagnetic Wave Theory)'', Wiley, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-470-94163-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rxGCaDvBCoAC&pg=PA180 p. 180]</ref>\nThis is achieved by pre- or post-multiplication by the timelike basis vector <math>\\gamma_0</math>, which serves to split a four vector into a scalar timelike and a bivector spacelike component. With <math>x = x^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu</math> we have\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}x \\gamma_0 &= x^0 + x^k \\gamma_k \\gamma_0 \\\\ \\gamma_0 x &= x^0 - x^k \\gamma_k \\gamma_0 \\end{align} \n</math>\n\nAs these bivectors <math>\\gamma_k \\gamma_0</math> square to unity, they serve as a spatial basis.  Utilizing the [[Pauli matrix]] notation, these are written <math>\\sigma_k = \\gamma_k \\gamma_0</math>.

These can be interpreted as projectors onto the [[light-cone]] and orthogonality relations for such projectors, respectively.  But in some cases it ''is'' possible to divide one multivector quantity by another, and make sense of the result: so, for example, a directed area divided by a vector in the same plane gives another vector, orthogonal to the first.\n\n==Spacetime algebra description of non-relativistic physics==\n\n===Non-relativistic quantum mechanics===\nSpacetime algebra allows the description of the [[Pauli equation|Pauli particle]] in terms of a [[real number|real]] theory in place of a matrix theory.

Since each [[coefficient]] ''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' spans two [[real number|real]] [[dimension]]s, the split-biquaternion is an element of an eight-dimensional [[vector space]]. Considering that it carries a multiplication, this vector space is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the real field, or an [[algebra over a ring]] where the split-complex numbers form the ring. This algebra was introduced by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in an 1873 article for the [[London Mathematical Society]]. It has been repeatedly noted in mathematical literature since then, variously as a deviation in terminology, an illustration of the [[tensor product of algebras]], and as an illustration of the [[direct sum of modules#Direct sum of algebras|direct sum of algebras]].\nThe split-biquaternions have been identified in various ways by algebraists; see {{section link||Synonyms}} below.\n\n==Modern definition==\nA split-biquaternion is [[Ring isomorphism|ring isomorphic]] to the [[Clifford algebra]] ''C''&#x2113;<sub>0,3</sub>('''R''').

Penrose proposed that twistor space should be the basic arena for physics from which space-time itself should emerge. It leads to a powerful set of mathematical tools that have applications to differential and integral geometry, nonlinear differential equations and representation theory and in physics to relativity and quantum field theory, in particular to scattering amplitudes.\n\n==Overview==\nMathematically, projective twistor space <math>\\mathbb{PT}</math> is a three-dimensional complex manifold, complex [[Projective space|projective 3-space]] <math>\\mathbb{CP}^3</math>. Physically it has the interpretation as the space of massless particles with spin. It is the projectivisation of a 4-dimensional complex vector space, non-projective twistor space <math>\\mathbb{T}</math> with a [[Hermitian form]] of signature (2,2) and a holomorphic volume form. This can be most naturally understood as the space of chiral (Weyl) spinors for the conformal group <math>SO(4,2)/\\mathbb{Z}_2</math> of Minkowski space; it is the fundamental representation of the spin group <math>SU(2,2)</math> of the conformal group. This definition can be extended to arbitrary dimensions except that beyond dimension four, one defines projective twistor space to be the space of projective [[pure spinor]]s for the conformal group.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spinors and Space-Time|last=Penrose|first=Roger|last2=Rindler|first2=Wolfgang|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=9780521252676|location=|pages=Appendix|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9780511524486}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hughston|first=L.

This is especially natural for [[Massless particle|massless fields]] of arbitrary [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. In the first instance these are obtained via contour integral formulae in terms of free holomorphic functions on regions in twistor space. The holomorphic twistor functions that give rise to solutions to the massless field equations are more correctly understood as Cech representatives of analytic cohomology classes on regions in <math>\\mathbb{PT}</math>. These correspondences have been extended to certain nonlinear fields, including self-dual gravity in Penrose's non-linear graviton construction<ref name=\":0\">Penrose, R.

There is a sharp contrast in the construction of the Weyl–Brauer matrices depending on whether the dimension ''n'' is even or odd.\n\nLet {{mvar|n}} = 2{{mvar|k}}  (or 2{{mvar|k}}+1) and suppose that the Euclidean [[quadratic form]] on {{mvar|V}} is given by\n:<math>q_1^2+\\dots+q_k^2+p_1^2+\\dots+p_k^2 ~~ (+p_n^2)~,</math>\nwhere (''p''<sub>i</sub>, ''q''<sub>i</sub>) are the standard coordinates on '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nDefine matrices '''1''', '''1''''=''σ''<sub>3</sub>, ''P''=''σ''<sub>1</sub>, and ''Q''=−''σ''<sub>2</sub> by\n:<math>\n\\begin{matrix}\n{\\mathbf 1}=\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\end{matrix}\\right),&\n{\\mathbf 1}'=\\left(\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\0&-1\\end{matrix}\\right),\\\\\nP=\\left(\\begin{matrix}0&1\\\\1&0\\end{matrix}\\right),&\nQ=\\left(\\begin{matrix}0&i\\\\-i&0\\end{matrix}\\right)\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>.\n\nIn even or in odd dimensionality, this quantization procedure amounts to replacing the ordinary ''p'', ''q'' coordinates with non-commutative coordinates constructed from ''P'', ''Q'' in a suitable fashion.\n\n=== Even case ===\nIn the case when ''n'' = 2''k'' is even, let\n:<math>P_i = {\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes P \\otimes {\\mathbf 1}\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}</math>\n:<math>Q_i = {\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes Q \\otimes {\\mathbf 1}\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}</math>\nfor ''i'' = 1,2,...,''k'' (where the ''P'' or ''Q'' is considered to occupy the ''i''-th position).  The operation <math>\\otimes</math> is the [[tensor product]] of matrices.  It is no longer important to distinguish between the ''P''s and ''Q''s, so we shall simply refer to them all with the symbol ''P'', and regard the index on ''P''<sub>i</sub> as ranging from ''i'' = 1 to ''i'' = 2''k''.  For instance, the following properties hold:\n:<math>P_i^2 = 1, i=1,2,...,2k</math>, and <math>P_iP_j=-P_jP_i</math> for all unequal pairs ''i'' and ''j''. ('''Clifford relations'''.)\nThus the algebra generated by the ''P''<sub>i</sub> is the [[Clifford algebra]] of euclidean ''n''-space.\n\nLet ''A'' denote the algebra generated by these matrices.  By counting dimensions, ''A'' is a complete 2<sup>''k''</sup>&times;2<sup>''k''</sup> matrix algebra over the complex numbers.  As a matrix algebra, therefore, it acts on 2<sup>''k''</sup>-dimensional column vectors (with complex entries).  These column vectors are the '''spinors'''.\n\nWe now turn to the action of the orthogonal group on the spinors.  Consider the application of an orthogonal transformation to the coordinates, which in turn acts upon the ''P''<sub>i</sub> via\n:<math>P_i\\mapsto R(P)_i = \\sum_j R_{ij}P_j</math>.\n\nThat is, <math>R\\in SO(n)</math>. Since the ''P''<sub>i</sub> generate ''A'', the action of this transformation extends to all of ''A'' and produces an [[automorphism]] of ''A''.  From elementary linear algebra, any such automorphism must be given by a [[change of basis]].  Hence there is a matrix ''S'', depending on ''R'', such that\n:<math>R(P)_i = S(R)P_iS(R)^{-1}</math>  (1).\nIn particular, ''S''(''R'') will act on column vectors (spinors).  By decomposing rotations into products of reflections, one can write down a formula for ''S''(''R'') in much the same way as in the case of three dimensions.\n\nHowever, just as in the three-dimensional case, there will be more than one matrix ''S''(''R'') which produces the action in (1).  The ambiguity defines ''S''(''R'') up to a nonevanescent scalar factor ''c''.  Since ''S''(''R'') and ''cS''(''R'') define the same transformation (1), the action of the orthogonal group on spinors is not single-valued, but instead descends to an action on the [[projective space]] associated to the space of spinors.  This multiple-valued action can be sharpened by normalizing the constant ''c'' in such a way that (det ''S''(''R''))<sup>2</sup> = 1.  In order to do this, however, it is necessary to discuss how the space of spinors (column vectors) may be identified with its dual (row vectors).\n\nIn order to identify spinors with their duals, let ''C'' be the matrix defined by\n:<math>C=P\\otimes Q\\otimes P\\otimes\\dots\\otimes Q.</math>\nThen conjugation by ''C'' converts a ''P''<sub>i</sub> matrix to its transpose: <sup>t</sup>''P''<sub>i</sub> = ''C P''<sub>i</sub> ''C''<sup>−1</sup>.  Under the action of a rotation,\n:<math>\\hbox{ }^tP_i\\rightarrow \\,^tS(R)^{-1}\\,^tP_i\\,^tS(R) = (CS(R)C^{-1})\\,^tP_i(CS(R)C^{-1})^{-1}</math>\nwhence ''C'' ''S''(''R'') ''C''<sup>−1</sup> = α <sup>t</sup>''S''(''R'')<sup>−1</sup> for some scalar α.  The scalar factor α can be made to equal one by rescaling ''S''(''R'').  Under these circumstances, (det ''S''(''R''))<sup>2</sup> = 1, as required.\n\n==== Weyl spinors ====\nLet ''U'' be the element of the algebra ''A'' defined by\n:<math>U={\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}'</math>, (''k'' factors).\nThen ''U'' is preserved under rotations, so in particular its [[eigenspace|eigenspace decomposition]] (which necessarily corresponds to the eigenvalues +1 and -1, occurring in equal numbers) is also stabilized by rotations.  As a consequence, each spinor admits a decomposition into eigenvectors under ''U'':\n:ξ = ξ<sup>+</sup> + ξ<sup>−</sup>\ninto a ''right-handed Weyl spinor'' ξ<sup>+</sup> and a ''left-handed Weyl spinor'' ξ<sup>−</sup>.  Because rotations preserve the eigenspaces of ''U'', the rotations themselves act diagonally as matrices ''S''(''R'')<sup>+</sup>, ''S''(''R'')<sup>−</sup> via\n:(''S''(''R'')ξ)<sup>+</sup> = ''S''<sup>+</sup>(''R'') ξ<sup>+</sup>, and\n:(''S''(''R'')ξ)<sup>−</sup> = ''S''<sup>−</sup>(''R'') ξ<sup>−</sup>.\n\nThis decomposition is not, however, stable under [[improper rotation]]s (e.g., reflections in a hyperplane). A reflection in a hyperplane has the effect of interchanging the two eigenspaces. Thus there are two irreducible spin representations in even dimensions given by the left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinors, each of which has dimension 2<sup>k-1</sup>. However, there is only one irreducible '''pin representation''' (see below) owing to the non-invariance of the above eigenspace decomposition under improper rotations, and that has dimension 2<sup>k</sup>.\n\n==== Odd case ====\nIn the quantization for an odd number 2''k''+1 of dimensions, the matrices ''P''<sup>i</sup> may be introduced as above for ''i'' = 1,2,...,2''k'', and the following matrix may be adjoined to the system:\n:<math>P_n = {\\mathbf 1}'\\otimes\\dots\\otimes{\\mathbf 1}'</math>, (''k'' factors),\nso that the Clifford relations still hold.  This adjunction has no effect on the algebra ''A'' of matrices generated by the ''P''<sub>i</sub>, since in either case ''A'' is still a complete matrix algebra of the same dimension.  Thus ''A'', which is a complete 2<sup>''k''</sup>&times;2<sup>''k''</sup> matrix algebra, is not the Clifford algebra, which is an algebra of dimension 2&times;2<sup>''k''</sup>&times;2<sup>''k''</sup>.  Rather ''A'' is the quotient of the Clifford algebra by a certain ideal.\n\nNevertheless, one can show that if ''R'' is a proper rotation (an orthogonal transformation of determinant one), then the rotation among the coordinates\n:<math>R(P)_i = \\sum_j R_{ij}P_j</math>\n\nis again an automorphism of ''A'', and so induces a change of basis\n:<math>R(P)_i = S(R)P_iS(R)^{-1}</math>\nexactly as in the even-dimensional case.  The projective representation ''S''(''R'') may again be normalized so that (det ''S''(''R''))<sup>2</sup> = 1.  It may further be extended to general orthogonal transformations by setting ''S''(''R'') = -''S''(-''R'') in case det ''R'' = -1 (i.e., if ''R'' is a reversal).\n\nIn the case of odd dimensions it is not possible to split a spinor into a pair of Weyl spinors, and spinors form an irreducible representation of the spin group.  As in the even case, it is possible to identify spinors with their duals, but for one caveat.  The identification of the space of spinors with its dual space is invariant under ''proper'' rotations, and so the two spaces are spinorially equivalent.  However, if ''improper'' rotations are also taken into consideration, then the spin space and its dual are not isomorphic.  Thus, while there is only one spin representation in odd dimensions, there are a pair of inequivalent '''pin representations'''.  This fact is not evident from the Weyl's quantization approach, however, and is more easily seen by considering the representations of the full Clifford algebra.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Higher-dimensional gamma matrices]]\n*[[Clifford algebra]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weyl-Brauer Matrices}}\n[[Category:Spinors]]\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n[[Category:Clifford algebras]]"

      "text": "{{Original research|date=March 2016}}\n[[Vector algebra]] and [[geometric algebra]] are complementary approaches to providing additional algebraic structures on vector spaces, with geometric interpretations, particularly [[vector field]]s in [[multivariable calculus]] and applications in [[mathematical physics]].\n\nVector algebra is specific to Euclidean 3-space, while geometric algebra uses [[multilinear algebra]] and applies in all dimensions and signatures, notably 3+1 [[spacetime]] as well as 2 dimensions. They are mathematically equivalent in 3 dimensions, where this article is focused, though the approaches differ. Vector algebra is more widely used in elementary multivariable calculus, while geometric algebra is used in more advanced treatments, and is proposed for elementary use as well.\n\n== Basic concepts and operations ==\nGeometric algebra (GA) is an extension or completion of vector algebra (VA).{{sfn|Vold|1993|p=1}} The reader is herein assumed to be familiar with the basic concepts and operations of VA and this article will mainly concern itself with operations in <math>\\mathcal G_{3}</math> the GA of 3D space (nor is this article intended to be mathematically rigorous). In GA, vectors are not normally written boldface as the meaning is usually clear from the context.\n\nThe fundamental difference is that GA provides an additional product of vectors called the \"geometric product\". Elements of GA are graded [[multivector]]s, scalars are grade 0, the usual vectors are grade 1, bivectors are grade 2 and the highest grade (3 in the 3D case) is traditionally called the pseudoscalar and designated <math>I</math>.\n\nThe ungeneralized 3D vector form of the geometric product is {{sfn|Gull|Lasenby|Doran|1993|p=6}}:\n\n:<math>ab=a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b </math>\n\nthat is the sum of the usual dot (inner) product and the outer (exterior) product (this last is closely related to the cross product and will be explained below).\n\nIn VA, entities such as [[pseudovector]]s  and [[pseudoscalar]]s need to be bolted on, whereas in GA the equivalent bivector and pseudovector respectively exist naturally as subspaces of the algebra.\n\nFor example, applying vector calculus in 2 dimensions, such as to compute torque or curl, requires adding an artificial 3rd dimension and extending the vector field to be constant in that dimension, or alternately considering these to be scalars. The torque or curl is then a normal vector field in this 3rd dimension. By contrast, geometric algebra in 2 dimensions defines these as a pseudoscalar field (a bivector), without requiring a 3rd dimension. Similarly, the [[scalar triple product]] is ad hoc, and can instead be expressed uniformly using the exterior product and the geometric product.\n\n== Translations between formalisms ==\n\nHere are some comparisons between standard <math>{\\mathbb R}^3</math> vector relations and their corresponding [[exterior product]] and geometric product equivalents.  All the exterior and geometric product equivalents here are good for more than three dimensions, and some also for two.  In two dimensions the cross product is undefined even if what it describes (like torque) is perfectly well defined in a plane without introducing an arbitrary normal vector outside of the space.\n\nMany of these relationships only require the introduction of the exterior product to generalize, but since that may not be familiar to somebody with only a background in vector algebra and calculus, some examples are given.\n\n=== Cross and exterior products ===\n[[File:Exterior calc cross product.svg|right|thumb|The cross product in relation to the exterior product. In red are the orthogonal [[unit vector]], and the \"parallel\" unit bivector.]]\n<math>\\mathbf u \\times \\mathbf v</math> is perpendicular to the plane containing <math>\\mathbf u</math> and <math>\\mathbf v</math>.<br />\n<math>\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v</math> is an oriented representation of the same plane.\n\nWe have the pseudoscalar <math>I = e_{1}e_{2}e_{3}</math> (right handed orthonormal frame) and so\n\n: <math>e_{1}I = Ie_{1}=  e_{2}e_{3}</math> returns a bivector and\n\n: <math>I (e_{2} \\wedge e_{3}) = Ie_2e_3 = -e_1</math> returns a vector perpendicular to the <math>e_{2} \\wedge e_{3}</math> plane.\n\nThis yields a convenient definition for the [[cross product]] of traditional vector algebra:\n\n:<math>{u}\\times{v} = -I({u}\\wedge{v})</math>\n\n(this is antisymmetric). Relevant is the distinction between axial and polar vectors in vector algebra, which is natural in geometric algebra as the distinction between vectors and bivectors (elements of grade two).\n\nThe <math>i</math> here is a unit [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space, which establishes a duality between the vectors and the bivectors, and is named so because of the expected property\n\n:<math>I^2 = (e_1 e_2 e_3)^2 \n=  e_1 e_2 e_3 e_1 e_2 e_3\n= - e_1 e_2 e_1 e_3 e_2 e_3\n=  e_1 e_1 e_2 e_3 e_2 e_3\n= - e_3 e_2 e_2 e_3\n= -1</math>\n\nThe equivalence of the <math>\\mathbb{R}^3</math> cross product and the exterior product expression above can be confirmed by direct multiplication of <math>-I = - {e_1} {e_2} {e_3}</math> with a determinant expansion of the exterior product\n\n:<math> u \\wedge  v = \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i} \\wedge {e_j}\n= \\sum_{1\\leq i<j\\leq 3}(u_i v_j - v_i u_j)  {e_i}  {e_j}\n</math>\n\nSee also [[Cross product#Cross product as an exterior product|Cross product as an exterior product]].  Essentially, the geometric product of a bivector and the [[pseudoscalar (mathematics)|pseudoscalar]] of Euclidean 3-space provides a method of calculation of the [[Hodge dual]].\n\n=== Cross and commutator products ===\n{{See also|Cross product#Coordinate notation|Cross product#Cross product and handedness|Cross product#Commutator product}}\nThe [[pseudovector]]/[[bivector]] subalgebra of the [[geometric algebra]] of Euclidean 3-dimensional space form a 3-dimensional [[vector space]] themselves. Let the standard unit pseudovectors/bivectors of the subalgebra be <math>\\mathbf{i} = \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}</math>, and <math>\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}</math>, and the [[anti-commutative]] [[Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|commutator product]] be defined as <math>A \\times B = \\tfrac{1}{2}(AB - BA)</math>, where <math>AB</math> is the [[Geometric algebra#Definition and notation|geometric product]]. The commutator product is [[distributivity|distributive]] over addition and [[linearity|linear]], as the geometric product is distributive over addition and linear. \n\nFrom the definition of the commutator product, <math>\\mathbf{i}</math>, <math>\\mathbf{j}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{k}</math> satisfy the following equalities:\n:<math> \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{j} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{i} \\mathbf{j} - \\mathbf{j} \\mathbf{i}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}((\\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} - \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(- \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1} + \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(- \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_1} + \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} + \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}) = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} = \\mathbf{k}</math>\n:<math> \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{k} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{j} \\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{j}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}((\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} - \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(- \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} + \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(- \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_2} + \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} + \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} = \\mathbf{i}</math>\n:<math> \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{i} = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{k} \\mathbf{i} - \\mathbf{i} \\mathbf{k}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} - \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_3} - \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_2} \\mathbf{e_1}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} - \\mathbf{e_3} \\mathbf{e_1}) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} + \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3}) = \\mathbf{e_1} \\mathbf{e_3} = \\mathbf{j}</math>\n\nwhich imply, by the anti-commutativity of the commutator product, that \n:<math> \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{i} = -\\mathbf{k}</math>\n:<math> \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{j} = -\\mathbf{i}</math>\n:<math> \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{k} = -\\mathbf{j}</math>\n\nThe anti-commutativity of the commutator product also implies that\n:<math> \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{i} = \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{j} = \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{k} = 0 </math>\n\nThese equalities and properties are sufficient to determine the commutator product of any two pseudovectors/bivectors <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{B}</math>. As the pseudovectors/bivectors form a vector space, each pseudovector/bivector can be defined as the sum of three orthogonal components parallel to the standard basis pseudovectors/bivectors: \n:<math>\\mathbf{A} = (A_1 \\mathbf{i} + A_2 \\mathbf{j} + A_3 \\mathbf{k})</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = (B_1 \\mathbf{i} + B_2 \\mathbf{j} + B_3 \\mathbf{k})</math>\n\nTheir commutator product <math>\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B}</math> can be expanded using its distributive property:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{A} \\times \\mathbf{B} = (A_1 \\mathbf{i} + A_2 \\mathbf{j} + A_3 \\mathbf{k}) \\times (B_1 \\mathbf{i} + B_2 \\mathbf{j} + B_3 \\mathbf{k})</math>\n::::<math>= A_1 B_1 \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{i} + A_1 B_2 \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{j} + A_1 B_3 \\mathbf{i} \\times \\mathbf{k} + A_2 B_1 \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{i} + A_2 B_2 \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{j} + A_2 B_3 \\mathbf{j} \\times \\mathbf{k} + A_3 B_1 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{i} + A_3 B_2 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{j} + A_3 B_3 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{k}</math>\n::::<math>= A_1 B_2 \\mathbf{k} - A_1 B_3 \\mathbf{j} - A_2 B_1 \\mathbf{k} + A_2 B_3 \\mathbf{i} + A_3 B_1 \\mathbf{j} - A_3 B_2 \\mathbf{i} = (A_2 B_3 - A_3 B_2) \\mathbf{i} + (A_3 B_1 - A_1 B_3) \\mathbf{j} + (A_1 B_2 - A_2 B_1) \\mathbf{k}</math>\nwhich is precisely the cross product in vector algebra for pseudovectors.\n\n=== Norm of a vector ===\n\nOrdinarily:\n\n:<math> {\\Vert \\mathbf u \\Vert}^2 = \\mathbf u \\cdot \\mathbf u</math>\n\nMaking use of the geometric product and the fact that the exterior product of a vector with itself is zero:\n\n:<math> \\mathbf u \\, \\mathbf u = {\\Vert \\mathbf u \\Vert}^2 = {\\mathbf u}^2 = \\mathbf u \\cdot \\mathbf u + \\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf u = \\mathbf u \\cdot \\mathbf u</math>\n\n=== Lagrange identity ===\n\nIn three dimensions the product of two vector lengths can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross products\n\n:<math>\n{\\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\Vert}^2 {\\Vert \\mathbf{v} \\Vert}^2\n=\n({\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}})^2 + {\\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\times \\mathbf{v} \\Vert}^2\n</math>\n\nThe corresponding generalization expressed using the geometric product is\n\n:<math>\n{\\Vert \\mathbf{u} \\Vert}^2 {\\Vert \\mathbf{v} \\Vert}^2\n= ({\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}})^2 - (\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v})^2\n</math>\n\nThis follows from expanding the geometric product of a pair of vectors with its reverse\n\n:<math>\n(\\mathbf{u} \\mathbf{v})(\\mathbf{v} \\mathbf{u}) \n= ({\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}} + {\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}}) ({\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}} - {\\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v}})\n</math>\n\n=== Determinant expansion of cross and wedge products ===\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf u \\times \\mathbf v = \\sum_{i<j}{ \\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}  {\\mathbf e}_i \\times {\\mathbf e}_j }\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v = \\sum_{i<j}{ \\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}  {\\mathbf e}_i \\wedge {\\mathbf e}_j }\n</math>\n\nLinear algebra texts will often use the determinant for the solution of linear systems by [[Cramer's rule]] or for and matrix inversion.\n\nAn alternative treatment is to axiomatically introduce the wedge product, and then demonstrate that this can be used directly to solve linear systems.  This is shown below, and does not require sophisticated math skills to understand.\n\nIt is then possible to define determinants as nothing more than the coefficients of the wedge product in terms of \"unit ''k''-vectors\" (<math>{\\mathbf e}_i \\wedge {\\mathbf e}_j</math> terms) expansions as above.\n\n:A one-by-one determinant is the coefficient of <math>\\mathbf{e}_1</math> for an <math>\\mathbb R^1</math> 1-vector.\n:A two-by-two determinant is the coefficient of <math>\\mathbf{e}_1 \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_2</math> for an <math>\\mathbb R^2</math> bivector\n:A three-by-three determinant is the coefficient of <math>\\mathbf{e}_1 \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_2 \\wedge \\mathbf{e}_3</math> for an <math>\\mathbb R^3</math> trivector\n:...\n\nWhen linear system solution is introduced via the wedge product, Cramer's rule follows as a side-effect, and there is no need to lead up to the end results with definitions of minors, matrices, matrix invertibility, adjoints, cofactors, Laplace expansions, theorems on determinant multiplication and row column exchanges, and so forth.\n\n=== Matrix Related===\n\nMatrix inversion (Cramer's rule) and determinants can be naturally expressed in terms of the wedge product.\n\nThe use of the wedge product in the solution of linear equations can be quite useful for various geometric product calculations.\n\nTraditionally, instead of using the wedge product, Cramer's rule is usually presented as a generic algorithm that can be used to solve linear equations of the form <math> A  x =  b</math> (or equivalently to invert a matrix).  Namely\n\n:<math> x = \\frac{1}{|A|}\\operatorname{adj}( A) b .</math>\n\nThis is a useful theoretic result.  For numerical problems row reduction with pivots and other methods are more stable and efficient.\n\nWhen the wedge product is coupled with the Clifford product and put into a natural geometric context, the fact that the determinants are used in the expression of <math>{\\mathbb R}^N</math> parallelogram area and parallelepiped volumes (and higher-dimensional generalizations thereof) also comes as a nice side-effect.\n\nAs is also shown below, results such as Cramer's rule also follow directly from the wedge product's selection of non-identical elements.  The end result is then simple enough that it could be derived easily if required instead of having to remember or look up a rule.\n\nTwo variables example\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = a x + b y = c .</math>\n\nPre- and post-multiplying by <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>,\n\n:<math>      (  a x +  b y ) \\wedge  b = ( a \\wedge  b) x =        c \\wedge  b</math>\n:<math> a \\wedge (  a x +  b y )       = ( a \\wedge  b) y =  a \\wedge  c      </math>\n\nProvided <math> a \\wedge  b \\neq 0</math> the solution is\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ a \\wedge  b} \\begin{bmatrix} c \\wedge  b \\\\  a \\wedge  c\\end{bmatrix} .</math>\n\nFor <math> a,  b \\in {\\mathbb R}^2</math>, this is Cramer's rule since the <math>{e}_1 \\wedge {e}_2</math> factors of the wedge products\n\n:<math> u \\wedge  v = \\begin{vmatrix}u_1 & u_2 \\\\ v_1 & v_2 \\end{vmatrix} {e}_1 \\wedge {e}_2</math>\n\ndivide out.\n\nSimilarly, for three, or ''N'' variables, the same ideas hold\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} a &  b & c \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{bmatrix} = d </math>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix}x \\\\ y \\\\ z\\end{bmatrix} = \\frac{1}{ a \\wedge  b \\wedge  c}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n d \\wedge  b \\wedge  c \\\\\n a \\wedge  d \\wedge  c \\\\\n a \\wedge  b \\wedge  d\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nAgain, for the three variable three equation case this is Cramer's rule since the <math>{e}_1 \\wedge {e}_2 \\wedge {e}_3</math> factors of all the wedge products divide out, leaving the familiar determinants.\n\nA numeric example with three equations and two unknowns:\nIn case there are more equations than variables and the equations have a solution, then each of the k-vector quotients will be scalars.\n\nTo illustrate here is the solution of a simple example with three equations and two unknowns.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\nx + \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\ny = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe right wedge product with <math>(1, 1, 1)</math> solves for <math>x</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\wedge\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\nx = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\wedge\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand a left wedge product with <math>(1, 1, 0)</math> solves for <math>y</math>\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\wedge\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\ny = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n\\wedge\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nObserve that both of these equations have the same factor, so\none can compute this only once (if this was zero it would\nindicate the system of equations has no solution).\n\nCollection of results for\n<math>x</math> and <math>y</math> yields a Cramer's rule-like form:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{(1, 1, 0) \\wedge (1, 1, 1)}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n(1, 1, 2) \\wedge (1, 1, 1) \\\\\n(1, 1, 0) \\wedge (1, 1, 2)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nWriting <math>{e} _i \\wedge {e} _j = {e} _{ij}</math>, we have the end result:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}\n=\n\\frac{1}{{e}_{13} + {e}_{23}}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n{-{e}_{13} -

{\\mathbf r}_0) \\times ({\\mathbf r}_1 - {\\mathbf r}_0)) \\cdot ({\\mathbf r} - {\\mathbf r}_0) = 0.</math>\n\nThe equivalent wedge product equation is\n:<math>({\\mathbf r}_2 - {\\mathbf r}_0) \\wedge ({\\mathbf r}_1 - {\\mathbf r}_0) \\wedge ({\\mathbf r} - {\\mathbf r}_0) = 0.</math>\n\n=== Projection and rejection ===\n\nUsing the [[Gram–Schmidt process]] a single vector can be decomposed into two components with respect to a reference vector, namely the projection onto a unit vector in a reference direction, and the difference between the vector and that projection.\n\nWith, <math>  \\hat{u} =  u / {\\Vert  u \\Vert}</math>, the projection of <math> v</math> onto <math>  \\hat{u}</math> is\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Proj}_{{\\hat{u}}}\\,{v} =  \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\cdot  v)</math>\n\nOrthogonal to that vector is the difference, designated the rejection,\n\n:<math>  v -  \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\cdot  v) = \\frac{1}{{\\Vert  u \\Vert}^2} ( {\\Vert  u \\Vert}^2  v -  u ( u \\cdot  v))</math>\n\nThe rejection can be expressed as a single geometric algebraic product in a few different ways\n\n:<math>\n \\frac{  u }{{ u}^2} (  u  v -  u \\cdot  v)\n= \\frac{1}{ u} (  u \\wedge  v )\n=  \\hat{u} (  \\hat{u} \\wedge  v )\n= (  v \\wedge  \\hat{u} )  \\hat{u} \n</math>\n\nThe similarity in form between the projection and the rejection is notable. The sum of these recovers the original vector\n\n:<math> v = \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\cdot  v) + \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\wedge v ) </math>\n\nHere the projection is in its customary vector form.  An alternate formulation is possible that puts the projection in a form that differs from the usual vector formulation\n\n:<math>  v\n=  \\frac{1}{ u} ( {u} \\cdot  v) + \\frac{1}{ u} (  {u} \\wedge  v )\n=  ( {v} \\cdot  u) \\frac{1}{ u}  + (  v \\wedge  u ) \\frac{1}{ u} \n</math>\n\nWorking backwards from the end result, it can be observed that this orthogonal decomposition result can in fact follow more directly from the definition of the geometric product itself.\n\n:<math> v =  \\hat{u} \\hat{u} v = \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\cdot  v +  \\hat{u} \\wedge  v )\n</math>\n\nWith this approach, the original geometrical consideration is not necessarily obvious, but it is a much quicker way to get at the same algebraic result.\n\nHowever, the hint that one can work backwards, coupled with the knowledge that the wedge product can be used to solve sets of linear equations (see: [http://www.grassmannalgebra.info/grassmannalgebra/book/bookpdf/TheExteriorProduct.pdf] ), the problem of orthogonal decomposition can be posed directly,\n\nLet <math> v = a  u +  x</math>, where <math> u \\cdot  x = 0</math>.  To discard the portions of <math> v</math> that are colinear with <math> u</math>, take the exterior product\n\n:<math> u \\wedge  v =  u \\wedge (a  u +  x) =  u \\wedge  x</math>\n\nHere the geometric product can be employed\n\n:<math> u \\wedge  v =  u \\wedge  x =  u  x -  u \\cdot  x =  u  x</math>\n\nBecause the geometric product is invertible, this can be solved for ''x'':\n\n:<math> x = \\frac{1}{u}( u \\wedge v ) .</math>\n\nThe same techniques can be applied to similar problems, such as calculation of the component of a vector in a plane and perpendicular to the plane.\n\nFor three dimensions the projective and rejective components of a vector with respect to an arbitrary non-zero unit vector, can be expressed in terms of the dot and cross product\n\n:<math>\\mathbf v = (\\mathbf v \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf u})\\hat{\\mathbf u} + \\hat{\\mathbf u} \\times (\\mathbf v \\times \\hat{\\mathbf u}) .</math>\n\nFor the general case the same result can be written in terms of the dot and wedge product and the geometric product of that and the unit vector\n\n:<math>\\mathbf v = (\\mathbf v \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf u})\\hat{\\mathbf u} + (\\mathbf v \\wedge \\hat{\\mathbf u}) \\hat{\\mathbf u}. </math>\n\nIt's also worthwhile to point out that this result can also be expressed using right or left vector division as defined by the geometric product:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf v = (\\mathbf v \\cdot \\mathbf u)\\frac{1}{\\mathbf u} + (\\mathbf v \\wedge \\mathbf u) \\frac{1}{\\mathbf u}</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf v = \\frac{1}{\\mathbf u}(\\mathbf u \\cdot \\mathbf v) + \\frac{1}{\\mathbf u}(\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v) .</math>\n\nLike vector projection and rejection, higher-dimensional analogs of that calculation are also possible using the geometric product.\n\nAs an example, one can calculate the component of a vector perpendicular to a plane and the projection of that vector onto the plane.\n\nLet <math> w = a u + b v + x </math>, where <math> u \\cdot  x =  v \\cdot  x = 0</math>.  As above, to discard the portions of <math> w</math> that are colinear with <math> u</math> or <math> v</math>, take the wedge product\n\n:<math> w \\wedge u \\wedge v = (a u + b v + x) \\wedge u \\wedge v = x \\wedge u \\wedge v .</math>\n\nHaving done this calculation with a vector projection, one can guess that this quantity equals <math> x ( u \\wedge v )</math>. One can also guess there is a vector and bivector dot product like quantity such that the allows the calculation of the component of a vector that is in the \"direction of a plane\".  Both of these guesses are correct, and validating these facts is worthwhile. However, skipping ahead slightly, this to-be-proven fact allows for a nice closed form solution of the vector component outside of the plane:\n\n:<math> x\n= ( w \\wedge u \\wedge v)\\frac{1}{ u \\wedge v}\n= \\frac{1}{ u \\wedge v}( u \\wedge v \\wedge w).\n</math>\n\nNotice the similarities between this planar rejection result and the vector rejection result. To calculate the component of a vector outside of a plane we take the volume spanned by three vectors (trivector) and \"divide out\" the plane.\n\nIndependent of any use of the geometric product it can be shown that this rejection in terms of the standard basis is\n\n:<math> x = \\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \\sum_{i<j<k}\n\\begin{vmatrix}w_i & w_j & w_k \\\\u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\\\end{vmatrix}\n\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\ { e}_i & { e}_j & { e}_k \\\\ \\end{vmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>(A_{u,v})^2\n= \\sum_{i<j} \\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}\n= -( u \\wedge  v)^2\n</math>\n\nis the squared area of the parallelogram formed by <math> u</math>, and <math> v</math>.\n\nThe (squared) magnitude of <math> x</math> is\n\n:<math>{\\Vert  x \\Vert}^2 =\n x \\cdot  w =\n\\frac{1}{(A_{u,v})^2} \\sum_{i<j<k}\n{\\begin{vmatrix}w_i & w_j & w_k \\\\u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\\\end{vmatrix}}^2\n</math>\n\nThus, the (squared) volume of the parallelopiped (base area times perpendicular height) is\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_{i<j<k}\n{\\begin{vmatrix}w_i & w_j & w_k \\\\u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\\\end{vmatrix}}^2</math>\n\nNote the similarity in form to the ''w'', ''u'', ''v'' trivector itself\n\n:<math>\n\\sum_{i<j<k}\n{\\begin{vmatrix}w_i & w_j & w_k \\\\u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\\\end{vmatrix}} {e}_i \\wedge {e}_j \\wedge {e}_k ,</math>\n\nwhich, if you take the set of <math>{e}_i \\wedge {e}_j \\wedge {e}_k</math> as a basis for the trivector space, suggests this is the natural way to define the measure of a trivector.  Loosely speaking, the measure of a vector is a length, the measure of a bivector is an area, and the measure of a trivector is a volume.\n\nIf a vector is factored directly into projective and rejective terms using the geometric product <math> v = \\frac{1}{u}( u \\cdot v +  u \\wedge v)</math>, then it is not necessarily obvious that the rejection term, a product of vector and bivector is even a vector.  Expansion of the vector bivector product in terms of the standard basis vectors has the following form\n\n:Let <math>\n r\n= \\frac{1}{ u} ( u \\wedge  v )\n= \\frac{ u}{ u^2} (  u \\wedge  v ) \n= \\frac{1}{{\\Vert  u \\Vert}^2}  u (  u \\wedge  v ) \n</math>\n\nIt can be shown that\n:<math>\n r = \\frac{1}{{\\Vert{ u}\\Vert}^2} \\sum_{i<j}\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}\n\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\  e_i &  e_j\\end{vmatrix}\n</math>\n\n(a result that can be shown more easily straight from <math> r = v - \\hat{u} ( \\hat{u} \\cdot v)</math>).\n\nThe rejective term is perpendicular to <math> u</math>, since <math>\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\ u_i & u_j\\end{vmatrix} = 0 </math> implies <math> r \\cdot u = 0 </math>.\n\nThe magnitude of <math>r</math> is\n\n:<math> {\\Vert r \\Vert}^2 =  r \\cdot  v = \\frac{1}{{\\Vert{u}\\Vert}^2} \\sum_{i<j}\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}^2 .</math>\n\nSo, the quantity\n\n:<math> {\\Vert  r \\Vert}^2 {\\Vert{ u}\\Vert}^2 = \\sum_{i<j}\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}^2 </math>\n\nis the squared area of the parallelogram formed by <math> u</math> and <math> v</math>.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the bivector can be expressed as\n\n:<math> u \\wedge  v = \\sum_{i<j}{ \\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix} e_i \\wedge  e_j } .</math>\n\nThus is it natural, if one considers each term <math> e_i \\wedge  e_j</math> as a basis vector of the bivector space, to define the (squared) \"length\" of that bivector as the (squared) area.\n\nGoing back to the geometric product expression for the length of the rejection <math>\\frac{1}{u} ( u \\wedge v )</math> we see that the length of the quotient, a vector, is in this case is the \"length\" of the bivector divided by the length of the divisor.\n\nThis may not be a general result for the length of the product of two '''''k''-vectors''', however it is a result that may help build some intuition about the significance of the algebraic operations.  Namely,\n\n:When a vector is divided out of the plane (parallelogram span) formed from it and another vector, what remains is the perpendicular component of the remaining vector, and its length is the planar area divided by the length of the vector that was divided out.\n\n=== Area of the parallelogram defined by u and v ===\n\nIf A is the area of the parallelogram defined by '''u''' and '''v''', then \n:<math> A^2 = {\\Vert \\mathbf u \\times \\mathbf v \\Vert}^2 = \\sum_{i<j}{\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}}^2 ,</math>\n\nand\n:<math>A^2 = -(\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v)^2 = \\sum_{i<j}{\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j\\\\v_i & v_j\\end{vmatrix}}^2 .</math>\n\nNote that this squared bivector is a geometric multiplication; this computation can alternatively be stated as the [[Gram determinant]] of the two vectors.\n\n=== Angle between two vectors ===\n\n:<math>({\\sin \\theta})^2 = \\frac{{\\Vert \\mathbf u \\times \\mathbf v \\Vert}^2}{{\\Vert \\mathbf u \\Vert}^2 {\\Vert \\mathbf v \\Vert}^2}</math>\n:<math>({\\sin \\theta})^2 = -\\frac{(\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v)^2}{{ \\mathbf u }^2 { \\mathbf v }^2}</math>\n\n=== Volume of the parallelopiped formed by three vectors ===\nIn vector algebra, the volume of a parallelopiped is given by the square root of the squared norm of the [[scalar triple product]]:\n:<math>V^2 = {\\Vert (\\mathbf u \\times \\mathbf v) \\cdot \\mathbf w \\Vert}^2\n= {\\begin{vmatrix}\nu_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\\\ \nv_1 & v_2 & v_3 \\\\ \nw_1 & w_2 & w_3 \\\\ \n\\end{vmatrix}}^2\n</math>\n\n<math>V^2 = -(\\mathbf u \\wedge \\mathbf v \\wedge \\mathbf w)^2\n= -\\left(\\sum_{i<j<k}\n\\begin{vmatrix}\nu_i & u_j & u_k \\\\ \nv_i & v_j & v_k \\\\ \nw_i & w_j & w_k \\\\ \n\\end{vmatrix}\n\\hat{\\mathbf e}_i \\wedge\n\\hat{\\mathbf e}_j \\wedge\n\\hat{\\mathbf e}_k \n\\right)^2\n\n= \\sum_{i<j<k}\n{\\begin{vmatrix}\nu_i & u_j & u_k \\\\ \nv_i & v_j & v_k \\\\ \nw_i & w_j & w_k \\\\ \n\\end{vmatrix}}^2\n</math>\n\n====Product of a vector and a bivector====\nIn order to justify the normal to a plane result above, a general examination of the product of a vector and bivector is required.  Namely,\n\n:<math> w ( u \\wedge v )\n= \\sum_{i,j<k}w_i {e}_i {\\begin{vmatrix}u_j & u_k \\\\ v_j & v_k \\\\ \\end{vmatrix}} {e}_j \\wedge {e}_k\n</math>\n\nThis has two parts, the vector part where <math>i=j</math> or <math>i=k</math>, and the trivector parts where no indexes equal.  After some index summation trickery, and grouping terms and so forth, this is\n\n:<math> w ( u \\wedge v) = \n\\sum_{i<j}(w_i { e}_j \n- w_j {e}_i )\n{\\begin{vmatrix}u_i & u_j \\\\v_i & v_j \\\\\\end{vmatrix}}\n+\n\\sum_{i<j<k}\n{\\begin{vmatrix}w_i & w_j & w_k \\\\ u_i & u_j & u_k \\\\v_i & v_j & v_k \\\\\\end{vmatrix}} \n{e}_i \\wedge {e}_j \\wedge {e}_k\n</math>\n\nThe trivector term is <math> w \\wedge  u \\wedge  v</math>.  Expansion of <math>( u \\wedge v) w</math> yields the same trivector term (it is the completely symmetric part), and the vector term is negated.  Like the geometric product of two vectors, this geometric product can be grouped into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, one of which is a pure k-vector.  In analogy the antisymmetric part of this product can be called a generalized dot product, and is roughly speaking the dot product of a \"plane\" (bivector), and a vector.\n\nThe properties of this generalized dot product remain to be explored, but first here is a summary of the notation\n\n:<math> w ( u \\wedge v) =  w \\cdot ( u \\wedge  v) +  w \\wedge u \\wedge v </math>\n\n:<math>( u \\wedge v)  w = -  w \\cdot ( u \\wedge  v) +  w \\wedge u \\wedge v </math>\n\n:<math> w \\wedge u \\wedge v = \\frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \\wedge v  ) + ( u \\wedge v ) w) </math>\n\n:<math> w \\cdot ( u \\wedge v) = \\frac{1}{2} ( w ( u \\wedge v ) - ( u \\wedge v ) w)\n</math>\n\nLet <math> w =  x + y</math>, where <math> x = a u + b  v</math>, and <math> y \\cdot u = y \\cdot v = 0</math>.  Expressing <math>w</math> and the <math> u \\wedge  v</math>, products in terms of these components is\n\n:<math>  w ( u \\wedge v ) =  x ( u \\wedge v ) +  y ( u \\wedge v ) =  x \\cdot ( u \\wedge  v) +  y \\cdot ( u \\wedge  v) +  y \\wedge  u \\wedge  v</math>\n\nWith the conditions and definitions above, and some manipulation, it can be shown that the term <math> y \\cdot ( u \\wedge  v) =  0</math>, which then justifies the previous solution of the normal to a plane problem.  Since the vector term of the vector bivector product the name dot product is zero\nwhen the vector is perpendicular to the plane (bivector), and this vector, bivector \"dot product\" selects only the components that are in the plane, so in analogy to the vector-vector dot product this name itself is justified by more than the fact this is the non-wedge product term of the geometric vector-bivector product.\n\n=== Derivative of a unit vector ===\n\nIt can be shown that a unit vector derivative can be expressed using the cross product\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf r}{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}^3}\\left(\\mathbf r \\times \\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}\\right) \\times \\mathbf r\n= \\left(\\hat{\\mathbf r} \\times \\frac{1}{{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}} \\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}\\right) \\times \\hat{\\mathbf r}\n</math>\n\nThe equivalent geometric product generalization is\n\n:<math>\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf r}{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}^3}\\mathbf r \\left(\\mathbf r \\wedge \\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}\\right)\n= \\frac{1}{{ \\mathbf r }}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf r} \\wedge \\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}\\right)\n</math>\n\nThus this derivative is the component of <math>\\frac{1}{{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}}\\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}</math> in the direction perpendicular to <math>\\mathbf r</math>.  In other words, this is <math>\\frac{1}{{\\Vert \\mathbf r \\Vert}}\\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}</math> minus the projection of that vector onto <math>\\hat{\\mathbf r}</math>.\n\nThis intuitively makes sense (but a picture would help) since a unit vector is constrained to circular motion, and any change to a unit vector due to a change in its generating vector has to be in the direction of the rejection of <math>\\hat{\\mathbf r}</math> from <math>\\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}</math>.  That rejection has to be scaled by 1/|r| to get the final result.\n\nWhen the objective isn't comparing to the cross product, it's also notable that this unit vector derivative can be written\n\n:<math>\n{{ \\mathbf r }} \\frac{d \\hat{\\mathbf r}}{dt}\n= \\hat{\\mathbf r} \\wedge \\frac{d \\mathbf r}{dt}\n</math>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Geometric algebra]]\n* [[Bivector]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* {{citation |year=1993|last=Vold|first=Terje G.|title=An introduction to Geometric Algebra with an Application in Rigid Body mechanics|url =http://www.helsinki.fi/kemia/fysikaalinen/opetus/matnum/Lectures/2009/Vold_1.pdf }}\n* {{citation |year=1993|last1=Gull|first1=S.F.|last2=Lasenby|first2=A.N|last3=Doran|first3=C:J:L|title=Imaginary Numbers are not Real – the Geometric Algebra of Spacetime|url =http://geometry.mrao.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ImagNumbersArentReal.pdf }}\n\n{{Linear algebra}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]\n[[Category:Vector calculus]]\n[[Category:Mathematics-related lists]]"

      "text": "<!--This paragraph outlines what CGA is, with particular reference to points and transformations-->\n'''Conformal geometric algebra''' ('''CGA''') is the [[geometric algebra]] constructed over the resultant space of a map from points in an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional base space {{math|ℝ<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>}} to null vectors in {{math|ℝ<sup>''p''+1,''q''+1</sup>}}.  This allows operations on the base space, including reflections, rotations and translations to be represented using [[Geometric algebra#Versor |versors]] of the geometric algebra; and it is found that points, lines, planes, circles and spheres gain particularly natural and computationally amenable representations.\n\n<!--This paragraph extends the conformal idea to generalized \"conformal geometric objects\"-->\nThe effect of the mapping is that generalized (i.e. including zero curvature) [[n-sphere|{{math|''k''}}-spheres]] in the base space map onto {{math|(''k'' + 2)}}-[[Blade (geometry)|blade]]s, and so that the effect of a translation (or ''any'' [[conformal map|conformal mapping]]) of the base space corresponds to a rotation in the higher-dimensional space.  In the algebra of this space, based on the [[geometric product]] of vectors, such transformations correspond to the algebra's characteristic sandwich operations, similar to the use of [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|quaternions for spatial rotation in 3D]], which combine very efficiently.  A consequence of rotors representing transformations is that the representations of spheres, planes, circles and other geometrical objects, and equations connecting them, all transform covariantly.  A geometric object (a {{math|''k''}}-sphere) can be synthesized as the wedge product of {{math|''k'' + 2}} linearly independent vectors representing points on the object; conversely, the object can be decomposed as the repeated [[wedge product]] of vectors representing {{math|''k'' + 2}} distinct points in its surface.  Some intersection operations also acquire a tidy algebraic form: for example, for the Euclidean base space {{math|ℝ<sup>3</sup>}}, applying the [[wedge product]] to the dual of the tetravectors representing two spheres produces the dual of the trivector representation of their circle of intersection.\n\n<!--This paragraph introduces applications and motivates the use of CGA-->\nAs this algebraic structure lends itself directly to effective computation, it facilitates exploration of the classical methods of [[projective geometry]] and [[inversive geometry]] in a concrete, easy-to-manipulate setting.  It has also been used as an efficient structure to represent and facilitate calculations in [[screw theory]]. CGA has particularly been applied in connection with the projective mapping of the everyday Euclidean space {{math|ℝ<sup>3</sup>}} into a five-dimensional vector space {{math|ℝ<sup>4,1</sup>}}, which has been investigated for applications in robotics and computer vision.  It can be applied generally to any [[pseudo-Euclidean space]], and the mapping of [[Minkowski space]] {{math|ℝ<sup>3,1</sup>}} to the space {{math|ℝ<sup>4,2</sup>}} is being investigated for applications to relativistic physics.\n\n{{cleanup section|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Construction of CGA==\n\n=== Notation and terminology===\nIn this article, the focus is on the algebra <math>\\mathcal G(4,1)</math> as it is this particular algebra that has been the subject of most attention over time; other cases are briefly covered in a separate section.\nThe space containing the objects being modelled is referred to here as the ''base space'', and the algebraic space used to model these objects  as the ''representation'' or ''conformal'' space.  A ''homogeneous subspace'' refers to a linear subspace of the algebraic space.\n<!--Some thought is need for these terms.\n * Hestenes uses \"inhomogeneous\" and \"homogeneous\" as adjectives (but this clashes with \"homogeneous subspace\")\n * Perwass refers to \"Euclidean space\" and \"conformal space\" respectively.\n * Dorst uses \"base space\" and \"representation space\"\n Dorst's appears to me the best terminology – Quondum  -->\n<!--Quite a few sources use conformal space (which is in https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Conformal_space) so I think we could use either -selfstudier -->\n\nThe terms for objects: ''point'', ''line'', ''circle'', ''sphere'', ''quasi-sphere'' etc. are used to mean either the geometric object in the base space, or the homogeneous subspace of the representation space that represents that object, with the latter generally being intended unless indicated otherwise.{{refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|For clarity, this homogeneous subspace includes non-null vectors, which do not correspond to any point in the base space.}}  Algebraically, any nonzero null element of the homogeneous subspace will be used, with one element being referred to as ''normalized'' by some criterion.\n\nBoldface lowercase Latin letters are used to represent position vectors from the origin to a point in the base space.

      "text": "'''Gauge theory gravity''' ('''GTG''') is a theory of [[gravitation]] cast in the mathematical language of [[geometric algebra]].  To those familiar with [[general relativity]], it is highly reminiscent of the [[tetrad formalism]] although there are significant conceptual differences.  Most notably, the background in GTG is flat, [[Minkowski spacetime]].  The [[equivalence principle]] is not assumed, but instead follows from the fact that the [[gauge covariant derivative]] is [[minimal coupling|minimally coupled]].  As in general relativity, equations structurally identical to the [[Einstein field equations]] are derivable from a [[variational principle]].  A [[spin tensor]] can also be supported in a manner similar to [[Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory]].  GTG was first proposed by Lasenby, [[Chris J. L.

First, ''position-gauge invariance'' demands that arbitrary local displacements of fields not affect the physical content of the field equations.  Second, ''rotation-gauge invariance'' demands that arbitrary local rotations of fields not affect the physical content of the field equations.  These principles lead to the introduction of a new pair of linear functions, the position-gauge field and the rotation-gauge field.  A displacement by some arbitrary function ''f''\n:<math>x \\mapsto x'=f(x)</math>\ngives rise to the position-gauge field defined by the mapping on its adjoint,\n:<math>\\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(a,x) \\mapsto \\bar{\\mathsf{h}}'(a,x)=\\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(f^{-1}(a),f(x)),</math>\nwhich is linear in its first argument and ''a'' is a constant vector.  Similarly, a rotation by some arbitrary rotor ''R'' gives rise to the rotation-gauge field\n:<math>\\bar{\\mathsf{\\Omega}}(a,x) \\mapsto \\bar{\\mathsf{\\Omega}}'(a,x)=R\\bar{\\mathsf{\\Omega}}(a,x)R^{\\dagger}-2a\\cdot\\nabla RR^{\\dagger}.</math>\n\nWe can define two different covariant directional derivatives\n:<math>a \\cdot D = a \\cdot \\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(\\nabla)+\\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{\\Omega}(\\mathsf{h}(a))</math>\n:<math>a \\cdot \\mathcal{D} = a \\cdot \\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(\\nabla)+\\mathsf{\\Omega}(\\mathsf{h}(a))</math>\nor with the specification of a coordinate system\n:<math>D_{\\mu} = \\partial_{\\mu}+\\frac{1}{2}\\Omega_{\\mu}</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal{D}_{\\mu} = \\partial_{\\mu}+\\Omega_{\\mu} \\times ,</math>\nwhere × denotes the commutator product.\n\nThe first of these derivatives is better suited for dealing directly with [[spinor]]s whereas the second is better suited for [[observable]]s.  The GTG analog of the [[Riemann tensor]] is built from the commutation rules of these derivatives.\n:<math>[D_{\\mu},D_{\\nu}]\\psi=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathsf{R}_{\\mu\\nu}\\psi</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal{R}(a \\wedge b)=\\mathsf{R}(\\mathsf{h}(a \\wedge b))</math>\n\n==Field equations==\nThe field equations are derived by postulating the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] governs the evolution of the gauge fields, i.e.\n:<math>S = \\int  \\left[ {1 \\over 2\\kappa} \\left( \\mathcal{R} - 2 \\Lambda \\right) + \\mathcal{L}_\\mathrm{M} \\right] (\\det\\mathsf{h})^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4 x.</math>\nMinimizing variation of the action with respect to the two gauge fields results in the field equations\n:<math>\\mathcal{G}(a)-\\Lambda a=\\kappa \\mathcal{T}(a)</math>\n:<math>\\mathcal{D} \\wedge \\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(a) = \\kappa \\mathcal{S} \\cdot \\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(a),</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathcal{T}</math> is the covariant [[energy–momentum tensor]] and <math>\\mathcal{S}</math> is the covariant [[spin tensor]].  Importantly, these equations do not give an evolving curvature of spacetime but rather merely give the evolution of the gauge fields within the flat spacetime.\n\n==Relation to general relativity==\nFor those more familiar with general relativity, it is possible to define a [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] from the position-gauge field in a manner similar to tetrads.  In the tetrad formalism, a set of four vectors <math>\\{{e_{(a)}}^{\\mu}\\}</math> are introduced.  The Greek index ''μ'' is [[raising and lowering indices|raised or lowered]] by multiplying and contracting with the spacetime's metric tensor.  The parenthetical Latin index ''(a)'' is a label for each of the four tetrads, which is raised and lowered as if it were multiplied and contracted with a separate Minkowski metric tensor.  GTG, roughly, reverses the roles of these indices.  The metric is implicitly assumed to be Minkowski in the selection of the [[spacetime algebra]].  The information contained in the other set of indices gets subsumed by the behavior of the gauge fields.\n\nWe can make the associations\n:<math>g_{\\mu}=\\mathsf{h}^{-1}(e_{\\mu})</math>\n:<math>g^{\\mu}=\\bar{\\mathsf{h}}(e^{\\mu})</math>\nfor a [[covariant vector]] and [[contravariant vector]] in a curved spacetime, where now the unit vectors <math>\\{e_{\\mu}\\}</math> are the chosen coordinate basis.  These can define the metric using the rule\n:<math>g_{\\mu \\nu}=g_{\\mu} \\cdot g_{\\nu}.</math>\n\nFollowing this procedure, it is possible to show that for the most part the observable predictions of GTG agree with Einstein–Cartan–Sciama–Kibble theory for non-vanishing spin and reduce to general relativity for vanishing spin.  GTG does, however, make different predictions about global solutions.  For example, in the study of a point mass, the choice of a \"Newtonian gauge\" yields a solution similar to the [[Schwarzschild metric]] in [[Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates]].  General relativity permits an extension known as the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].  GTG, on the other hand, forbids any such extension.{{why|date=September 2016}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*David Hestenes: [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/pdf/NEW_GRAVITY.pdf Spacetime calculus for gravitation theory] – an account of the mathematical formalism explicitly directed to GTG\n\n{{theories of gravitation}}\n\n[[Category:Gauge theories]]\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]\n[[Category:Theories of gravitation]]\n\n[[ru:Релятивистская теория гравитации]]"

      "text": "{{distinguish|matrix calculus|vector calculus|multiplicative calculus}}\n{{Calculus |Multivariable}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], '''geometric calculus''' extends the [[geometric algebra]] to include [[Derivative|differentiation]] and [[Integral|integration]].  The formalism is powerful and can be shown to encompass other mathematical theories including [[differential geometry]] and [[differential form]]s.<ref>[[David Hestenes]], Garrett Sobczyk: Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus, a Unified Language for mathematics and Physics (Dordrecht/Boston:G.Reidel Publ.Co., 1984, {{ISBN|90-277-2561-6}}</ref>\n\n==Differentiation==\n\nWith a geometric algebra given, let <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> be [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]] and let <math>F(a)</math> be a [[multivector]]-valued function.  The [[directional derivative]] of <math>F(a)</math> along <math>b</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\nabla_b F(a) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0}{\\frac{F(a + \\epsilon b) - F(a)}{\\epsilon}},</math>\n\nprovided that the limit exists, where the limit is taken for scalar <math>\\epsilon</math>.  This is similar to the usual definition of a directional derivative but extends it to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.\n\nNext, choose a set of [[basis vector]]s <math>\\{e_i\\}</math> and consider the operators, denoted <math>\\partial_i</math>, that perform directional derivatives in the directions of <math>e_i</math>:\n:<math>\\partial_i : F \\mapsto (x\\mapsto \\nabla_{e_i} F(x)).</math>\n\nThen, using the [[Einstein summation notation]], consider the operator:\n:<math>e^i\\partial_i,</math>\nwhich means\n:<math>F \\mapsto e^i\\partial_i F,</math>\nor, more verbosely:\n:<math>F \\mapsto (x\\mapsto e^i\\nabla_{e_i} F(x)).</math>\n\nIt can be shown that this operator is independent of the choice of frame, and can thus be used to define the ''geometric derivative'':\n:<math>\\nabla = e^i\\partial_i.</math>\n\nThis is similar to the usual definition of the [[gradient]], but it, too, extends to functions that are not necessarily scalar-valued.\n\nIt can be shown that the directional derivative is linear regarding its direction, that is:\n:<math>\\nabla_{\\alpha a + \\beta b} = \\alpha\\nabla_a + \\beta\\nabla_b.</math>\nFrom this follows that the directional derivative is the inner product of its direction by the geometric derivative.  All needs to be observed is that the direction <math>a</math> can be written <math>a = (a\\cdot e^i) e_i</math>, so that:\n:<math>\\nabla_a = \\nabla_{(a\\cdot e^i)e_i} = (a\\cdot e^i)\\nabla_{e_i} = a\\cdot(e^i\\nabla_{e^i}) = a\\cdot \\nabla.</math>\nFor this reason, <math>\\nabla_a F(x)</math> is often noted <math>a\\cdot \\nabla F(x)</math>.\n\nThe standard [[order of operations]] for the geometric derivative is that it acts only on the function closest to its immediate right.  Given two functions <math>F</math> and <math>G</math>, then for example we have\n\n:<math>\\nabla FG = (\\nabla F)G.</math>\n\n===Product rule===\n\nAlthough the partial derivative exhibits a [[product rule]], the geometric derivative only partially inherits this property.  Consider two functions <math>F</math> and <math>G</math>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\nabla(FG) &= e^i\\partial_i(FG) \\\\\n&= e^i((\\partial_iF)G+F(\\partial_iG)) \\\\\n&= e^i(\\partial_iF)G+e^iF(\\partial_iG). \\end{align}</math>\n\nSince the geometric product is not [[commutative]] with <math>e^iF \\ne Fe^i</math> in general, we cannot proceed further without new notation.  A solution is to adopt the ''[[overdot]] notation'', in which the scope of a geometric derivative with an overdot is the multivector-valued function sharing the same overdot.  In this case, if we define\n\n:<math>\\dot{\\nabla}F\\dot{G}=e^iF(\\partial_iG),</math>\n\nthen the product rule for the geometric derivative is\n\n:<math>\\nabla(FG) = \\nabla FG+\\dot{\\nabla}F\\dot{G}.</math>\n\n===Interior and exterior derivative===\n\nLet <math>F</math> be an <math>r</math>-grade multivector.  Then we can define an additional pair of operators, the interior and exterior derivatives,\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot F = \\langle \\nabla F \\rangle_{r-1} = e^i \\cdot \\partial_i F,</math>\n:<math>\\nabla \\wedge F = \\langle \\nabla F \\rangle_{r+1} = e^i \\wedge \\partial_i F.</math>\n\nIn particular, if <math>F</math> is grade 1 (vector-valued function), then we can write\n\n:<math>\\nabla F = \\nabla \\cdot F + \\nabla \\wedge F</math>\n\nand identify the [[divergence]] and [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] as\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot F = \\operatorname{div} F,</math>\n:<math>\\nabla \\wedge F = I \\, \\operatorname{curl} F.</math>\n\nNote, however, that these two operators are considerably weaker than the geometric derivative counterpart for several reasons.  Neither the interior derivative operator nor the exterior derivative operator is [[invertible]].\n\n==Integration==\n\nLet <math>\\{e_1, \\ldots, e_n\\}</math> be a set of basis vectors that span an <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space.  From geometric algebra, we interpret the [[pseudoscalar]] <math>e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e_n</math> to be the [[signed volume]] of the <math>n</math>-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] subtended by these basis vectors.  If the basis vectors are [[orthonormal]], then this is the unit pseudoscalar.\n\nMore generally, we may restrict ourselves to a subset of <math>k</math> of the basis vectors, where <math>1 \\le k \\le n</math>, to treat the length, area, or other general <math>k</math>-volume of a subspace in the overall <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space.  We denote these selected basis vectors by <math>\\{e_{i_1}, \\ldots, e_{i_k} \\}</math>.  A general <math>k</math>-volume of the <math>k</math>-parallelotope subtended by these basis vectors is the grade <math>k</math> multivector <math>e_{i_1} \\wedge e_{i_2} \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e_{i_k}</math>.\n\nEven more generally, we may consider a new set of vectors <math>\\{x^{i_1}e_{i_1}, \\ldots, x^{i_k}e_{i_k} \\}</math> proportional to the <math>k</math> basis vectors, where each of the <math>\\{x^{i_j}\\}</math> is a component that scales one of the basis vectors.  We are free to choose components as infinitesimally small as we wish as long as they remain nonzero.  Since the outer product of these terms can be interpreted as a <math>k</math>-volume, a natural way to define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] is\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}d^kX &= \\left(dx^{i_1} e_{i_1}\\right) \\wedge \\left(dx^{i_2}e_{i_2}\\right) \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge \\left(dx^{i_k}e_{i_k}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\left( e_{i_1}\\wedge e_{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e_{i_k} \\right) dx^{i_1} dx^{i_2} \\cdots dx^{i_k}.\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe measure is therefore always proportional to the unit pseudoscalar of a <math>k</math>-dimensional subspace of the vector space.  Compare the [[Riemannian volume form]] in the theory of differential forms.  The integral is taken with respect to this measure:\n\n:<math>\\int_V F(x)\\,d^kX = \\int_V F(x) \\left( e_{i_1}\\wedge e_{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e_{i_k} \\right) dx^{i_1} dx^{i_2} \\cdots dx^{i_k}.</math>\n\nMore formally, consider some directed volume <math>V</math> of the subspace.  We may divide this volume into a sum of [[simplices]].  Let <math>\\{x_i\\}</math> be the coordinates of the vertices.  At each vertex we assign a measure <math>\\Delta U_i(x)</math> as the average measure of the simplices sharing the vertex.  Then the integral of <math>F(x)</math> with respect to <math>U(x)</math> over this volume is obtained in the limit of finer partitioning of the volume into smaller simplices:\n\n:<math>\\int_V F\\,dU = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n F(x_i)\\,\\Delta U_i(x).</math>\n\n===Fundamental theorem of geometric calculus===\n\nThe reason for defining the geometric derivative and integral as above is that they allow a strong generalization of [[Stokes' theorem]].  Let <math>\\mathsf{L}(A;x)</math> be a multivector-valued function of <math>r</math>-grade input <math>A</math> and general position <math>x</math>, linear in its first argument.  Then the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus relates the integral of a derivative over the volume <math>V</math> to the integral over its boundary:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|equation =\n<math>\\int_V \\dot{\\mathsf{L}} \\left(\\dot{\\nabla} dX;x \\right) = \\oint_{\\partial V} \\mathsf{L} (dS;x).</math>\n}}\n\nAs an example, let <math>\\mathsf{L}(A;x)=\\langle F(x) A I^{-1} \\rangle</math> for a vector-valued function <math>F(x)</math> and a (<math>n-1</math>)-grade multivector <math>A</math>.  We find that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\int_V \\dot{\\mathsf{L}} \\left(\\dot{\\nabla} dX;x \\right) &= \\int_V \\langle\\dot{F}(x)\\dot{\\nabla}\\,dX\\,I^{-1} \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\int_V \\langle\\dot{F}(x)\\dot{\\nabla}\\,|dX| \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\int_V \\nabla \\cdot F(x)\\,|dX|. \\end{align}</math>\n\nLikewise,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\oint_{\\partial V} \\mathsf{L} (dS;x) &= \\oint_{\\partial V} \\langle F(x)\\,dS\\,I^{-1} \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\oint_{\\partial V} \\langle F(x) \\hat{n}\\,|dS| \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\oint_{\\partial V} F(x) \\cdot \\hat{n}\\,|dS|. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThus we recover the [[divergence theorem]],\n\n:<math>\\int_V \\nabla \\cdot F(x)\\,|dX| = \\oint_{\\partial V} F(x) \\cdot \\hat{n}\\,|dS|.</math>\n\n==Covariant derivative==\n\nA sufficiently smooth <math>k</math>-surface in an <math>n</math>-dimensional space is deemed a [[manifold]].  To each point on the manifold, we may attach a <math>k</math>-blade <math>B</math> that is tangent to the manifold.  Locally, <math>B</math> acts as a pseudoscalar of the <math>k</math>-dimensional space.  This blade defines a [[geometric algebra#Projection and rejection|projection]] of vectors onto the manifold:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{P}_B (A) = (A \\cdot B^{-1}) B.</math>\n\nJust as the geometric derivative <math>\\nabla</math> is defined over the entire <math>n</math>-dimensional space, we may wish to define an ''intrinsic derivative'' <math>\\partial</math>, locally defined on the manifold:\n\n:<math>\\partial F = \\mathcal{P}_B (\\nabla )F.</math>\n\n(Note: The right hand side of the above may not lie in the tangent space to the manifold. Therefore, it is not the same as <math>\\mathcal{P}_B (\\nabla F)</math>, which necessarily does lie in the tangent space.)\n\nIf <math>a</math> is a vector tangent to the manifold, then indeed both the geometric derivative and intrinsic derivative give the same directional derivative:\n\n:<math>a \\cdot \\partial F = a \\cdot \\nabla F.</math>\n\nAlthough this operation is perfectly valid, it is not always useful because <math>\\partial F</math> itself is not necessarily on the manifold.  Therefore, we define the ''covariant derivative'' to be the forced projection of the intrinsic derivative back onto the manifold:\n\n:<math>a \\cdot DF = \\mathcal{P}_B (a \\cdot \\partial F) = \\mathcal{P}_B (a \\cdot \\mathcal{P}_B (\\nabla F)).</math>\n\nSince any general multivector can be expressed as a sum of a projection and a rejection, in this case\n\n:<math>a \\cdot \\partial F = \\mathcal{P}_B (a \\cdot \\partial F) + \\mathcal{P}_B^{\\perp} (a \\cdot \\partial F),</math>\n\nwe introduce a new function, the [[shape tensor]] <math>\\mathsf{S}(a)</math>, which satisfies\n\n:<math>F \\times \\mathsf{S}(a) = \\mathcal{P}_B^{\\perp} (a \\cdot \\partial F),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\times</math> is the commutator product.  In a local coordinate basis <math>\\{e_i\\}</math> spanning the tangent surface, the shape tensor is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{S}(a) = e^i \\wedge \\mathcal{P}_B^{\\perp} (a \\cdot \\partial e_i).</math>\n\nImportantly, on a general manifold, the covariant derivative does not commute.  In particular, the [[commutator]] is related to the shape tensor by\n\n:<math>[a \\cdot D, \\, b \\cdot D]F=-(\\mathsf{S}(a) \\times \\mathsf{S}(b)) \\times F.</math>\n\nClearly the term <math>\\mathsf{S}(a) \\times \\mathsf{S}(b)</math> is of interest.  However it, like the intrinsic derivative, is not necessarily on the manifold.  Therefore, we can define the [[Riemann tensor]] to be the projection back onto the manifold:\n\n:<math>\\mathsf{R}(a \\wedge b)=-\\mathcal{P}_B (\\mathsf{S}(a) \\times \\mathsf{S}(b)).</math>\n\nLastly, if <math>F</math> is of grade <math>r</math>, then we can define interior and exterior covariant derivatives as\n\n:<math>D \\cdot F = \\langle DF \\rangle_{r-1},</math>\n:<math>D \\wedge F = \\langle D F \\rangle_{r+1},</math>\n\nand likewise for the intrinsic derivative.\n\n==Relation to differential geometry==\n\nOn a manifold, locally we may assign a tangent surface spanned by a set of basis vectors <math>\\{e_i\\}</math>.  We can associate the components of a [[metric tensor]], the [[Christoffel symbols]], and the [[Riemann curvature tensor]] as follows:\n\n:<math>g_{ij}=e_i \\cdot e_j,</math>\n:<math>\\Gamma^k_{ij}=(e_i \\cdot De_j) \\cdot e^k,</math>\n:<math>R_{ijkl}=(\\mathsf{R}(e_i \\wedge e_j) \\cdot e_k) \\cdot e_l.</math>\n\nThese relations embed the theory of differential geometry within geometric calculus.\n\n==Relation to differential forms==\n\nIn a [[local coordinate system]] (<math>x^1, \\ldots, x^n</math>), the coordinate differentials <math>dx^1</math>, ..., <math>dx^n</math> form a basic set of one-forms within the [[coordinate chart]]. Given a [[multi-index]] <math>i_1, \\ldots, i_k</math> with <math>1 \\le i_p \\le n</math> for <math>1 \\le p \\le k</math>, we can define a <math>k</math>-form \n:<math>\\omega = f_I\\,dx^I=f_{i_1,i_2\\cdots i_k}\\,dx^{i_1}\\wedge dx^{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge dx^{i_k}.</math>\n\nWe can alternatively introduce a <math>k</math>-grade multivector <math>A</math> as\n\n:<math>A = f_{i_1,i_2\\cdots i_k}e^{i_1}\\wedge e^{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e^{i_k}</math>\n\nand a measure\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}d^kX &= \\left(dx^{i_1} e_{i_1}\\right) \\wedge \\left(dx^{i_2}e_{i_2}\\right) \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge \\left(dx^{i_k}e_{i_k}\\right) \\\\\n&= \\left( e_{i_1}\\wedge e_{i_2}\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge e_{i_k} \\right) dx^{i_1} dx^{i_2} \\cdots dx^{i_k}.\\end{align}</math>\n\nApart from a subtle difference in meaning for the exterior product with respect to differential forms versus the exterior product with respect to vectors (in the former the ''increments'' are covectors, whereas in the latter they represent scalars), we see the correspondences of the differential form\n\n:<math>\\omega \\cong A^{\\dagger} \\cdot d^kX = A \\cdot \\left(d^kX \\right)^{\\dagger},</math>\n\nits derivative\n\n:<math>d\\omega \\cong (D \\wedge A)^{\\dagger} \\cdot d^{k+1}X = (D \\wedge A) \\cdot \\left(d^{k+1}X \\right)^{\\dagger},</math>\n\nand its [[Hodge dual]]\n\n:<math>\\star\\omega \\cong (I^{-1} A)^{\\dagger} \\cdot d^kX,</math>\n\nembed the theory of differential forms within geometric calculus.\n\n== History ==\n\nFollowing is a diagram summarizing the history of geometric calculus.\n\n[[File:Geometric Calculus Family Tree.png|center|300px|thumb |Figure 1 (from [32])|History of geometric calculus.]]\n\n{{-}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|first=Alan |last=Macdonald |title=Vector and Geometric Calculus |location=Charleston |publisher=CreateSpace |year=2012 |url=http://faculty.luther.edu/~macdonal/vagc/ | oclc=829395829 |isbn=9781480132450}}\n\n[[Category:Calculus]]\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]"

Silverman), Dover Publications, 1977.</ref>\n\nThe following examples show that a bivector in two dimensions measures the area of a parallelogram, and the magnitude of a bivector in three dimensions also measures the area of a parallelogram.  Similarly, a three-vector in three dimensions measures the volume of a parallelepiped.\n\nIt is easy to check that the magnitude of a three-vector in four dimensions measures the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by these vectors.\n\n===Multivectors in R<sup>2</sup>===\nProperties of multivectors can be seen by considering the two dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''<sup>2</sup>}}.  Let the basis vectors be '''e'''<sub>1</sub> and '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, so '''u''' and '''v''' are given by\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u}=u_1\\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\\mathbf{e}_2,\\quad \\mathbf{v}=v_1\\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\\mathbf{e}_2,</math>\n\nand the multivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}}, also called a bivector, is computed to be\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v} =\\begin{vmatrix} u_1 & v_1 \\\\ u_2 & v_2\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2.</math>\n\nThe vertical bars denote the determinant of the matrix, which is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v'''.  The magnitude of {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of this parallelogram.  Notice that because ''V'' has dimension two the basis bivector {{nowrap|'''e'''<sub>1</sub> ∧ '''e'''<sub>2</sub>}} is the only multivector in Λ''V''.\n\nThe relationship between the magnitude of a multivector and the area or volume spanned by the vectors is an important feature in all dimensions.  Furthermore, the linear functional version of a multivector that computes this volume is known as a differential form.\n\n===Multivectors in R<sup>3</sup>===\nMore features of multivectors can be seen by considering the three dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}.  In this case, let the basis vectors be '''e'''<sub>1</sub>, '''e'''<sub>2</sub>, and '''e'''<sub>3</sub>, so '''u''', '''v''' and '''w''' are given by\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u}=u_1\\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\\mathbf{e}_2 +u_3\\mathbf{e}_3 ,\\quad \\mathbf{v}=v_1\\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\\mathbf{e}_2+v_3\\mathbf{e}_3, \\quad \\mathbf{w}=w_1\\mathbf{e}_1+w_2\\mathbf{e}_2+w_3\\mathbf{e}_3,</math>\n\nand the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is computed to be\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{u} \\wedge \\mathbf{v} =\\begin{vmatrix} u_2 & v_2 \\\\ u_3 & v_3\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 + \\begin{vmatrix} u_1 & v_1 \\\\ u_3 & v_3\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 +\\begin{vmatrix} u_1 & v_1 \\\\ u_2 & v_2\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2.</math>\n\nThe components of this bivector are the same as the components of the cross product.  The magnitude of this bivector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.\n\nThis shows that the magnitude of the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v''' as it lies in the three-dimensional space ''V''.  The components of the bivector are the projected areas of the parallelogram on each of the three coordinate planes.\n\nNotice that because ''V'' has dimension three, there is one basis three-vector in Λ''V''.  Compute the three-vector\n:<math>\\mathbf{u}\\wedge\\mathbf{v}\\wedge\\mathbf{w}=\\begin{vmatrix} u_1 & v_1 &w_1\\\\ u_2 & v_2& w_2\\\\u_3&v_3&w_3\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3. </math>\nThis shows that the magnitude of the three-vector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v''' ∧ '''w'''}} is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors '''u''', '''v''' and '''w'''.\n\nIn higher-dimensional spaces, the component three-vectors are projections of the volume of a parallelepiped onto the coordinate three-spaces, and the magnitude of the three-vector is the volume of the parallelepiped as it sits in the higher-dimensional space.\n\n==Grassmann coordinates==\nIn this section, we consider multivectors on a [[projective space]] ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>, which provide a convenient set of coordinates for lines, planes and hyperplanes that have properties similar to the homogeneous coordinates of points, called [[Grassmann coordinates]].<ref>W. V. D. Hodge and D. Pedoe, Methods of Algebraic Geometry, Vol. 1, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1947</ref>\n\nPoints in a real projective space ''P''<sup>''n''</sup> are defined to be lines through the origin of the vector space '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup>.  For example, the projective plane ''P''<sup>2</sup> is the set of lines through the origin of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  Thus, multivectors defined on '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> can be viewed as multivectors on ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>.\n\nA convenient way to view a multivector on ''P''<sup>''n''</sup> is to examine it in an [[affine space|affine component]] of ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>, which is the intersection of the lines through the origin of '''R'''<sup>''n''+1</sup> with a selected hyperplane, such as {{nowrap|1=H: ''x''<sub>''n''+1</sub> = 1}}.  Lines through the origin of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> intersect the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} to define an affine version of the projective plane that only lacks the points {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}}, called the points at infinity.\n\n===Multivectors on ''P''<sup>2</sup>===\nPoints in the affine component {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} of the projective plane have coordinates {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}}.  A linear combination of two points {{nowrap|1='''p''' = (''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, 1)}} and {{nowrap|1='''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, 1)}} defines a plane in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> that intersects E in the line joining '''p''' and '''q'''.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} defines a parallelogram in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> given by\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} \\wedge \\mathbf{q} =(p_2 - q_2)\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2.</math>\nNotice that substitution of {{nowrap|''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} are homogeneous coordinates for the plane through the origin of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.\n\nThe set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}} on the line through '''p''' and '''q''' is the intersection of the plane defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}}  with the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' = 0}}, that is,\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{p} \\wedge \\mathbf{q} = (x\\mathbf{e}_1+y\\mathbf{e}_2+\\mathbf{e}_3)\\wedge \\big( (p_2 - q_2)\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2\\big)=0,</math>\n\nwhich simplifies to the equation of a line\n\n:<math>  \\lambda:  x(p_2 - q_2) + y(p_1- q_1)+ (p_1 q_2- q_1 p_2)=0.</math>\n\nThis equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for real values of α and β.\n\nThe three components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} that define the line ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the line.  Because three homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a line, the geometry of points is said to be dual to the geometry of lines in the projective plane.  This is called the [[duality (projective geometry)|principle of duality]].\n\n===Multivectors on ''P''<sup>3</sup>===\nThree dimensional projective space, ''P''<sup>3</sup> consists of all lines through the origin of '''R'''<sup>4</sup>.  Let the three dimensional hyperplane, {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}}, be the affine component of projective space defined by the points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}}.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} defines a parallelepiped in '''R'''<sup>4</sup> given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{p}\\wedge\\mathbf{q}\\wedge\\mathbf{r}=\\begin{vmatrix} p_2 & q_2 &r_2\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_2 & q_2& r_2\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_2 & q_2& r_2\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\end{vmatrix} \\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3. </math>\n\nNotice that substitution of {{nowrap|α'''p''' + β'''q''' + γ'''r'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}  are homogeneous coordinates for the 3-space through the origin of '''R'''<sup>4</sup>.\n\nA plane in the affine component {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} is the set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}} in the intersection of H with the 3-space defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r''' = 0}}, that is,\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}\\wedge\\mathbf{p} \\wedge \\mathbf{q}\\wedge\\mathbf{r} = (x\\mathbf{e}_1+y\\mathbf{e}_2+z\\mathbf{e}_3 +\\mathbf{e}_4)\\wedge \\mathbf{p}\\wedge\\mathbf{q}\\wedge\\mathbf{r} = 0 ,</math>\n\nwhich simplifies to the equation of a plane\n\n:<math>  \\lambda:  x\\begin{vmatrix} p_2 & q_2 &r_2\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix} + y \\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix}+ z\\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_2 & q_2& r_2\\\\1&1&1\\end{vmatrix}+  \\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1 &r_1\\\\ p_2 & q_2& r_2\\\\ p_3 & q_3& r_3\\end{vmatrix} =0.</math>\n\nThis equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q''' + ''γ'''''r'''}} for real values of ''α'', ''β'' and ''γ''.\n\nThe four components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} that define the plane ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the plane.  Because four homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a plane in projective space, the geometry of points is dual to the geometry of planes.\n\n'''A line as the join of two points:''' In projective space the line ''λ'' through two points '''p''' and '''q''' can be viewed as the intersection of the affine space {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} with the plane {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}}  in '''R'''<sup>4</sup>.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} provides homogeneous coordinates for the line\n\n:<math> \\lambda:  \\mathbf{p} \\wedge \\mathbf{q} = (p_1\\mathbf{e}_1+p_2\\mathbf{e}_2+p_3\\mathbf{e}_3 +\\mathbf{e}_4)\\wedge  (q_1\\mathbf{e}_1+q_2\\mathbf{e}_2+q_3\\mathbf{e}_3 +\\mathbf{e}_4),</math>\n:<math>\\qquad =\\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} p_2 & q_2\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} p_3 & q_3\\\\ 1 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4+ \\begin{vmatrix} p_2 & q_2\\\\ p_3 & q_3 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3+\\begin{vmatrix} p_3 & q_3\\\\ p_1 & q_1 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_1+\\begin{vmatrix} p_1 & q_1\\\\ p_2 & q_2\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2.</math>\nThese are known as the [[Plücker coordinates]] of the line, though they are also an example of Grassmann coordinates.\n\n'''A line as the intersection of two planes:'''  A line ''μ'' in projective space can also be defined as the set of points '''x''' that form the intersection of two planes ''π'' and ''ρ'' defined by grade three multivectors, so the points '''x''' are the solutions to the linear equations\n\n:<math>  \\mu: \\mathbf{x}\\wedge \\pi = 0, \\mathbf{x}\\wedge \\rho = 0.</math>\n\nIn order to obtain the Plucker coordinates of the line ''μ'', map the multivectors ''π'' and ''ρ'' to their dual point coordinates using the [[Hodge star operator]],<ref name=\"Flanders\"/>\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{e}_1 = {\\star}(\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 \\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4), -\\mathbf{e}_2 = {\\star}(\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3 \\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4), \\mathbf{e}_3 = {\\star}(\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2 \\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4), -\\mathbf{e}_4 = {\\star}(\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2 \\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3),</math>\n\nthen\n\n:<math> {\\star}\\pi = \\pi_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\pi_2\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\pi_3\\mathbf{e}_3 + \\pi_4\\mathbf{e}_4, \\quad {\\star}\\rho = \\rho_1\\mathbf{e}_1 + \\rho_2\\mathbf{e}_2 + \\rho_3\\mathbf{e}_3 + \\rho_4\\mathbf{e}_4 .</math>\n\nSo, the Plücker coordinates of the line ''μ'' are given by\n\n:<math> \\mu: ({\\star}\\pi)\\wedge({\\star}\\rho) =\\begin{vmatrix} \\pi_1 & \\rho_1\\\\ \\pi_4 & \\rho_4 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} \\pi_2 & \\rho_2\\\\ \\pi_4 & \\rho_4 \\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4 + \\begin{vmatrix} \\pi_3 & \\rho_3\\\\ \\pi_4 & \\rho_4\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_4+ \\begin{vmatrix}  \\pi_2 & \\rho_2\\\\ \\pi_3 & \\rho_3\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_2\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_3+\\begin{vmatrix}  \\pi_3 & \\rho_3\\\\ \\pi_1 & \\rho_1\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_3\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_1+\\begin{vmatrix}  \\pi_1 & \\rho_1\\\\ \\pi_2 & \\rho_2\\end{vmatrix}\\mathbf{e}_1\\wedge\\mathbf{e}_2.</math>\n\nBecause the six homogeneous coordinates of a line can be obtained from the join of two points or the intersection of two planes, the line is said to be self dual in projective space.\n\n==Clifford product==\n[[William Kingdon Clifford|W.

      "text": "{{about|outermorphisms of Clifford algebras over a finite-dimensional quadratic space|the concept in group theory|outer automorphism group}}\nIn [[geometric algebra]], the '''outermorphism''' of a [[linear map|linear function]] between [[vector space]]s is a natural extension of the map to arbitrary [[multivector]]s.{{sfn|Dorst|Doran|Lasenby|2001}}  It is the unique unital [[algebra homomorphism]] of [[exterior algebra]]s whose restriction to the vector spaces is the original function.{{efn|See particularly {{slink|Exterior algebra|Functoriality}}.}}\n\n==Definition==\n\nLet <math>f</math> be an <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>-linear map from <math>V</math> to <math>W</math>.  The extension of <math>f</math> to an outermorphism is the unique map <math>\\textstyle \\underline{\\mathsf{f}} : \\bigwedge(V) \\to \\bigwedge(W)</math> satisfying\n:<math> \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(1) = 1 </math>\n:<math> \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(x) = f(x) </math>\n:<math> \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(A \\wedge B) = \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(A) \\wedge \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(B)</math>\n:<math> \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(A + B) = \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(A) + \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(B)</math>\nfor all vectors <math>x</math> and all multivectors <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, where <math>\\textstyle \\bigwedge(V)</math> denotes the [[exterior algebra]] over <math>V</math>.\n\nThe outermorphism inherits linearity properties of the original linear map.  For example, we see that for scalars <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\beta</math> and vectors <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, <math>z</math>, the outermorphism is linear over bivectors:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\underline{\\mathsf{f}} (\\alpha x \\wedge z + \\beta y \\wedge z) &= \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}((\\alpha x + \\beta y) \\wedge z)\\\\[6pt]\n&= f(\\alpha x + \\beta y) \\wedge f(z) \\\\[6pt]\n&= (\\alpha f(x) + \\beta f(y)) \\wedge f(z) \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\alpha(f(x) \\wedge f(z)) + \\beta(f(y) \\wedge f(z)) \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\alpha \\, \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(x \\wedge z) + \\beta \\, \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(y \\wedge z),\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich extends through the axiom of distributivity over addition above to linearity over all multivectors.\n\n==Adjoint==\n\nLet <math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}</math> be an outermorphism.  We define the ''adjoint'' of <math>\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}</math> to be the outermorphism that satisfies the property\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}(a) \\cdot b = a \\cdot \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(b)</math>\nfor all vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, where <math>\\cdot</math> is the nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form (scalar product of vectors).\n\nThis results in the property that\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}(A) * B = A * \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(B)</math>\nfor all multivectors <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, where <math>*</math> is the [[Geometric algebra#Extensions of the inner and exterior products|scalar product of multivectors]].\n\nIf [[geometric calculus]] is available, then the adjoint may be extracted more directly:\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}(a) = \\nabla_b \\left\\langle a\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(b) \\right\\rangle .</math>\n\nThe above definition of ''adjoint'' is like the definition of the [[transpose]] in matrix theory.  When the context is clear, the [[underline]] below the function is often omitted.\n\n==Properties==\n\nIt follows from the definition at the beginning that the outermorphism of a multivector <math>A</math> is grade-preserving:{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1987|p=68|ps=. ({{google books|dScR5zwrheYC|here|pg=PA68|text=an outermorphism is grade-preserving}})}}\n\n:<math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(\\left\\langle A \\right\\rangle_r) = \\left\\langle\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(A)\\right\\rangle_r </math>\n\nwhere the notation <math>\\langle ~ \\rangle_r</math> indicates the <math>r</math>-vector part of <math>A</math>.\n\nSince any vector <math>x</math> may be written as <math>x=1\\wedge x</math>, it follows that scalars are unaffected with <math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(1)=1</math>.{{efn|Except for the case where <math>f</math> is the [[zero map]], when it is required by axiom.}}  Similarly, since there is only one [[pseudoscalar]] [[up to]] a scalar multiplier, we must have <math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(I) \\propto I</math>.  The [[determinant]] is defined to be the proportionality factor:{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1987|p=70|ps=. ({{google books|dScR5zwrheYC|here|pg=PA70|text=The determinant of f}})}}\n\n:<math>\\det\\mathsf{f} = \\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(I) I^{-1}</math>\n\nThe underline is not necessary in this context because the determinant of a function is the same as the determinant of its adjoint.  The determinant of the composition of functions is the product of the determinants:\n\n:<math>\\det(\\mathsf{f} \\circ \\mathsf{g}) = \\det\\mathsf{f} \\det\\mathsf{g}</math>\n\nIf the determinant of a function is nonzero, then the function has an inverse given by\n\n:<math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}^{-1}(X) = \\frac{\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}(XI)I^{-1}}{\\det\\mathsf{f}} = \\overline{\\mathsf f}(XI) [\\overline{\\mathsf f}(I)]^{-1},</math>\n\nand so does its adjoint, with\n\n:<math>\\overline{\\mathsf{f}}^{-1}(X) = \\frac{I^{-1}\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(IX)}{\\det\\mathsf{f}} = [\\underline{\\mathsf f}(I)]^{-1} \\underline{\\mathsf f}(IX) .</math>\n\nThe concepts of [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] may be generalized to outermorphisms.  Let <math>\\lambda</math> be a ''real'' number and let <math>B</math> be a (nonzero) blade of grade <math>r</math>.  We say that a <math>B</math> is an '''eigenblade''' of the function with eigenvalue <math>\\lambda</math> if{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1987|p=76|ps=. ({{google books|dScR5zwrheYC|here|pg=PA76|text=generalization of the notion of eigenvector}})}}\n\n:<math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(B)=\\lambda B .</math>\n\nIt may seem strange to consider only real eigenvalues, since in linear algebra the eigenvalues of a matrix with all real entries can have complex eigenvalues.  In geometric algebra, however, the blades of different grades can exhibit a complex structure.  Since both vectors and pseudovectors can act as eigenblades, they may each have a set of eigenvalues matching the degrees of freedom of the complex eigenvalues that would be found in ordinary linear algebra.\n\n==Examples==\n\n;Simple maps\n\nThe [[identity function|identity map]] and the scalar projection operator are outermorphisms.\n\n;Versors\n\nA rotation of a vector by rotor <math>R</math> is given by\n\n:<math>f(x)=RxR^\\dagger </math>\n\nwith outermorphism\n\n:<math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(X) = RXR^{\\dagger}.</math>\n\nWe check that this is the correct form of the outermorphism.  Since rotations are built from the geometric product, which has the distributive property, they must be linear.  To see that rotations are also outermorphisms, we recall that rotations preserve angles between vectors:{{sfn|Perwass|2008}}\n\n:<math>x \\cdot y = (RxR^{\\dagger}) \\cdot (RyR^{\\dagger})</math>\n\nNext, we try inputting a higher grade element and check that it is consistent with the original rotation for vectors:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(x \\wedge y) &= R(x \\wedge y)R^{\\dagger} \\\\\n&= R(xy - x \\cdot y)R^\\dagger \\\\\n&= RxyR^\\dagger - R(x \\cdot y)R^{\\dagger} \\\\\n&= RxR^\\dagger RyR^{\\dagger} - x \\cdot y \\\\\n&= (RxR^\\dagger) \\wedge (RyR^{\\dagger}) + \\cancel{(RxR^{\\dagger}) \\cdot (RyR^{\\dagger})} - \\cancel{x \\cdot y} \\\\\n&= f(x) \\wedge f(y) \\end{align}</math>\n\n;Orthogonal projection operators\n\nThe orthogonal projection operator <math>\\mathcal{P}_B</math> onto a blade <math>B</math> is an outermorphism:\n:<math>\\mathcal{P}_B(x \\wedge y) = \\mathcal{P}_B(x) \\wedge \\mathcal{P}_B(y) .</math>\n\n;Nonexample – orthogonal rejection operator\n\nIn contrast to the orthogonal projection operator, the orthogonal rejection <math>\\mathcal{P}^\\perp_B</math> by a blade <math>B</math> is linear but is ''not'' an outermorphism:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{P}^\\perp_B(1) = 1 - \\mathcal{P}_B(1) = 0 \\ne 1 .</math>\n\n;Nonexample – [[grade projection]] operator\n\nAn example of a multivector-valued function of multivectors that is linear but is ''not'' an outermorphism is grade projection where the grade is nonzero, for example projection onto grade 1:\n\n:<math>\\langle x \\wedge y \\rangle_1 = 0</math>\n:<math>\\langle x \\rangle_1 \\wedge \\langle y \\rangle_1 = x \\wedge y</math>\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{citation |year=1987 |last1=Hestenes|first1=D. |last2=Sobczyk|first2=G. |title=Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics |publisher=Springer |volume=5 |series=Fundamental Theories of Physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dScR5zwrheYC |isbn=90-277-2561-6 }}\n*{{citation |year=1995 |last1=Crumeyrolle|first1=A. |last2=Ablamowicz|first2=R. |last3=Lounesto|first3=P. |title=Clifford Algebras and Spinor Structures: A Special Volume Dedicated to the Memory of Albert Crumeyrolle (1919–1992) |publisher=Springer |volume=321 |series=Mathematics and Its Applications|page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DnyUDg483kEC&pg=PA105 |isbn=0-7923-3366-7}}\n*{{citation |year=1996 |last=Baylis|first=W.E. |title=Clifford (Geometric) Algebras: With Applications in Physics, Mathematics, and Engineering |publisher=Springer |volume= |series= |page=71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Nji78YQKfQC&pg=PA71 |isbn=0-8176-3868-7 }}\n*{{citation |year=2001 |last1=Dorst|first1=L. |last2=Doran|first2=C.J.L. |last3=Lasenby|first3=J. |title=Applications of geometric algebra in computer science and engineering |publisher=Springer |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NpJRkQfgtwUC&pg=PA61 |isbn=0-8176-4267-6 }}\n*{{citation |year=2003 |last1=D'Orangeville|first1=C. |last2=Anthony|first2=A. |last3=Lasenby|first3=N. |title=Geometric Algebra For Physicists |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume= |series= |page=343 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VW4yt0WHdjoC&pg=PA343 |isbn=0-521-48022-1 }}\n*{{citation |year=2008 |last=Perwass|first=C. |title=Geometric Algebra with Applications in Engineering |publisher=Springer |volume=4 |series=Geometry and Computing |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8IOypFqEkPMC&pg=PA23 |isbn=3-540-89067-X }}\n*{{citation |year=2014 |last=Joot|first=P. |title=Exploring physics with Geometric Algebra |publisher= |page=157 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPtiyvRk7QcC&pg=PA157 }}\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]"

      "title": "Plane of rotation",
      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_of_rotation",
      "text": "In [[geometry]], a '''plane of rotation''' is an abstract object used to describe or visualize [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s in space. In [[three dimensions]] it is an alternative to the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]], but unlike the axis of rotation it can be used in other dimensions, such as [[two dimensions|two]], [[Four-dimensional space|four]] or more dimensions.\n\nMathematically such planes can be described in a number of ways. They can be described in terms of [[Plane (geometry)|plane]]s and [[Angle of rotation|angles of rotation]]. They can be associated with [[bivector]]s from [[geometric algebra]]. They are related to the [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]] of a [[rotation matrix]]. And in particular [[dimension]]s they are related to other algebraic and geometric properties, which can then be generalised to other dimensions.\n\nPlanes of rotation are not used much in two and three dimensions, as in two dimensions there is only one plane so identifying the plane of rotation is trivial and rarely done, while in three dimensions the axis of rotation serves the same purpose and is the more established approach. The main use for them is in describing more complex rotations in [[higher dimensions]], where they can be used to break down the rotations into simpler parts. This can be done using [[geometric algebra]], with the planes of rotations associated with [[Bivector#Simple bivectors|simple bivectors]] in the algebra.<ref name = \"LounestoCh17\">Lounesto (2001) pp. 222–223</ref>\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Plane===\nFor this article, all ''[[plane (geometry)|plane]]s'' are planes through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]], that is they contain the [[zero vector]]. Such a plane in [[n-dimensional space|{{mvar|n}}-dimensional space]] is a two-dimensional [[linear subspace]] of the space. It is completely specified by any two non-zero and non-parallel vectors that lie in the plane, that is by any two vectors {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, such that\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{a} \\wedge \\mathbf{b} \\ne 0,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|∧}} is the exterior product from [[exterior algebra]] or [[geometric algebra]] (in three dimensions the [[cross product]] can be used). More precisely, the quantity {{math|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} is the bivector associated with the plane specified by {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, and has magnitude {{math|{{abs|'''a'''}} {{abs|'''b'''}} sin ''φ''}}, where {{mvar|φ}} is the angle between the vectors; hence the requirement that the vectors be nonzero and nonparallel.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 38</ref>\n\nIf the bivector {{math|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} is written {{math|'''B'''}}, then the condition that a point lies on the plane associated with {{math|'''B'''}} is simply<ref>Hestenes (1999) p. 48</ref>\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{x} \\wedge \\mathbf{B} = 0.</math>\n\nThis is true in all dimensions, and can be taken as the definition on the plane. In particular, from the properties of the exterior product it is satisfied by both {{math|'''a'''}} and {{math|'''b'''}}, and so by any vector of the form\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{c} = \\lambda\\mathbf{a} + \\mu\\mathbf{b},</math>\n\nwith {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|μ}} real numbers. As {{mvar|λ}} and {{mvar|μ}} range over all real numbers, {{math|'''c'''}} ranges over the whole plane, so this can be taken as another definition of the plane.\n\n===Plane of rotation===\nA ''plane of rotation'' for a particular [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] is a plane that is [[Linear map|mapped]] to itself by the rotation. The plane is not fixed, but all vectors in the plane are mapped to other vectors in the same plane by the rotation. This transformation of the plane to itself is always a rotation about the origin, through an angle which is the [[angle of rotation]] for the plane.\n\nEvery rotation except for the [[Identity element|identity]] rotation (with matrix the [[identity matrix]]) has at least one plane of rotation, and up to\n\n:<math>\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor</math>\n\nplanes of rotation, where {{mvar|n}} is the dimension. The maximum number of planes up to eight dimensions is shown in this table:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n! Dimension\n| 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8\n|-\n! Number of planes\n| 1 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 3 || 3 || 4\n|}\n\nWhen a rotation has multiple planes of rotation they are always [[orthogonal]] to each other, with only the origin in common. This is a stronger condition than to say the planes are at [[right angle]]s; it instead means that the planes have no nonzero vectors in common, and that every vector in one plane is orthogonal to every vector in the other plane. This can only happen in four or more dimensions. In two dimensions there is only one plane, while in three dimensions all planes have at least one nonzero vector in common, along their [[Plane (geometry)#Line of intersection between two planes|line of intersection]].<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 222</ref>\n\nIn more than three dimensions planes of rotation are not always unique. For example the negative of the [[identity matrix]] in four dimensions (the [[Inversion in a point|central inversion]]),\n\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix}, </math>\n\ndescribes a rotation in four dimensions in which every plane through the origin is a plane of rotation through an angle {{pi}}, so any pair of orthogonal planes generates the rotation. But for a general rotation it is at least theoretically possible to identify a unique set of orthogonal planes, in each of which points are rotated through an angle, so the set of planes and angles fully characterise the rotation.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p.87</ref>\n\n==Two dimensions==\nIn [[two-dimensional space]] there is only one plane of rotation, the plane of the space itself. In a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] it is the Cartesian plane, in [[complex numbers]] it is the [[complex plane]]. Any rotation therefore is of the whole plane, i.e. of the space, keeping only the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] fixed. It is specified completely by the signed angle of rotation, in the range for example −{{pi}} to {{pi}}. So if the angle is {{mvar|θ}} the rotation in the complex plane is given by [[Euler's formula]]:\n\n: <math> e^{i\\theta} = \\cos{\\theta} + i\\sin{\\theta},\\,</math>\n\nwhile the rotation in a Cartesian plane is given by the {{nowrap|2 × 2}} [[rotation matrix]]:<ref>Lounesto (2001) pp.27–28</ref>\n\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\ \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n==Three dimensions==\n[[File:PlaneRotation.svg|thumb|right|200px|A three-dimensional rotation, with an axis of rotation along the {{mvar|z}}-axis and a plane of rotation in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane]]\nIn [[three-dimensional space]] there are an infinite number of planes of rotation, only one of which is involved in any given rotation. That is, for a general rotation there is precisely one plane which is associated with it or which the rotation takes place in. The only exception is the trivial rotation, corresponding to the identity matrix, in which no rotation takes place.\n\nIn any rotation in three dimensions there is always a fixed axis, the axis of rotation. The rotation can be described by giving this axis, with the angle through which the rotation turns about it; this is the [[axis angle]] representation of a rotation. The plane of rotation is the plane orthogonal to this axis, so the axis is a [[surface normal]] of the plane. The rotation then rotates this plane through the same angle as it rotates around the axis, that is everything in the plane rotates by the same angle about the origin.\n\nOne example is shown in the diagram, where the rotation takes place about the {{mvar|z}}-axis. The plane of rotation is the {{mvar|xy}}-plane, so everything in that plane it kept in the plane by the rotation. This could be described by a matrix like the following, with the rotation being through an angle {{mvar|θ}} (about the axis or in the plane):\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|200px|The Earth showing its axis and plane of rotation, both [[axial tilt|inclined]] relative to the plane and perpendicular of [[Earth's orbit]]]]\nAnother example is the [[Earth's rotation]]. The axis of rotation is the line joining the [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]] and the plane of rotation is the plane through the [[equator]] between the [[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere|Southern]] Hemispheres. Other examples include mechanical devices like a [[gyroscope]] or [[flywheel]] which store [[rotational energy]] in mass usually along the plane of rotation.\n\nIn any three dimensional rotation the plane of rotation is uniquely defined. Together with the angle of rotation it fully describes the rotation. Or in a continuously rotating object the rotational properties such as the rate of rotation can be described in terms of the plane of rotation. It is perpendicular to, and so is defined by and defines, an axis of rotation, so any description of a rotation in terms of a plane of rotation can be described in terms of an axis of rotation, and vice versa. But unlike the axis of rotation the plane generalises into other, in particular higher, dimensions.<ref>Hestenes (1999) pp 280–284</ref>\n\n==Four dimensions==\n{{main|Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space}}\nA general rotation in [[four-dimensional space]] has only one fixed point, the origin. Therefore an axis of rotation cannot be used in four dimensions. But planes of rotation can be used, and each non-trivial rotation in four dimensions has one or two planes of rotation.\n\n===Simple rotations===\nA rotation with only one plane of rotation is a [[SO(4)#Simple rotations|simple rotation]]. In a simple rotation there is a fixed plane, and rotation can be said to take place about this plane, so points as they rotate do not change their distance from this plane. The plane of rotation is orthogonal to this plane, and the rotation can be said to take place in this plane.\n\nFor example the following matrix fixes the {{mvar|xy}}-plane: points in that plane and only in that plane are unchanged. The plane of rotation is the {{mvar|zw}}-plane, points in this plane are rotated through an angle {{mvar|θ}}. A general point rotates only in the {{mvar|zw}}-plane, that is it rotates around the {{mvar|xy}}-plane by changing only its {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}} coordinates.\n\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos \\theta & -\\sin \\theta \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\end{pmatrix} </math>\n\nIn two and three dimensions all rotations are simple, in that they have only one plane of rotation. Only in four and more dimensions are there rotations that are not simple rotations. In particular in four dimensions there are also double and isoclinic rotations.\n\n===Double rotations===\nIn a [[SO(4)#Double rotations|double rotation]] there are two planes of rotation, no fixed planes, and the only fixed point is the origin. The rotation can be said to take place in both planes of rotation, as points in them are rotated within the planes. These planes are orthogonal, that is they have no vectors in common so every vector in one plane is at right angles to every vector in the other plane. The two rotation planes span four-dimensional space, so every point in the space can be specified by two points, one on each of the planes.\n\nA double rotation has two angles of rotation, one for each plane of rotation. The rotation is specified by giving the two planes and two non-zero angles, {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} (if either angle is zero the rotation is simple). Points in the first plane rotate through {{mvar|α}}, while points in the second plane rotate through {{mvar|β}}. All other points rotate through an angle between {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}}, so in a sense they together determine the amount of rotation. For a general double rotation the planes of rotation and angles are unique, and given a general rotation they can be calculated. For example a rotation of {{mvar|α}} in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane and {{mvar|β}} in the {{mvar|zw}}-plane is given by the matrix\n\n: <math> \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos \\alpha & -\\sin \\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\sin \\alpha & \\cos \\alpha & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\cos \\beta & -\\sin \\beta \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\sin \\beta & \\cos \\beta \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\n===Isoclinic rotations===\n[[File:Tesseract.gif|thumb|right|A projection of a [[tesseract]] with an isoclinic rotation.]]\nA special case of the double rotation is when the angles are equal, that is if {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''β'' ≠ 0}}. This is called an [[SO(4)#Isoclinic rotations|isoclinic rotation]], and it differs from a general double rotation in a number of ways. For example in an isoclinic rotation, all non-zero points rotate through the same angle, {{mvar|α}}. Most importantly the planes of rotation are not uniquely identified. There are instead an infinite number of pairs of orthogonal planes that can be treated as planes of rotation. For example any point can be taken, and the plane it rotates in together with the plane orthogonal to it can be used as two planes of rotation.<ref>Lounesto (2001) pp. 83–89</ref>\n\n==Higher dimensions==\nAs already noted the maximum number of planes of rotation in {{mvar|n}} dimensions is\n\n:<math>\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor,</math>\n\nso the complexity quickly increases with more than four dimensions and categorising rotations as above becomes too complex to be practical, but some observations can be made.\n\nSimple rotations can be identified in all dimensions, as rotations with just one plane of rotation. A simple rotation in {{mvar|n}} dimensions takes place about (that is at a fixed distance from) an {{math|(''n'' − 2)}}-dimensional subspace orthogonal to the plane of rotation.\n\nA general rotation is not simple, and has the maximum number of planes of rotation as given above. In the general case the angles of rotations in these planes are distinct and the planes are uniquely defined. If any of the angles are the same then the planes are not unique, as in four dimensions with an isoclinic rotation.\n\nIn even dimensions ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 2, 4, 6...}}) there are up to {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}} planes of rotation span the space, so a general rotation rotates all points except the origin which is the only fixed point. In odd dimensions ({{math|''n'' {{=}} 3, 5, 7, ...}}) there are {{math|{{sfrac|''n'' − 1|2}}}} planes and angles of rotation, the same as the even dimension one lower. These do not span the space, but leave a line which does not rotate – like the [[Rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]] in three dimensions, except rotations do not take place about this line but in multiple planes orthogonal to it.<ref name = \"LounestoCh17\"/>\n\n==Mathematical properties==\nThe examples given above were chosen to be clear and simple examples of rotations, with planes generally parallel to the coordinate axes in three and four dimensions. But this is not generally the case: planes are not usually parallel to the axes, and the matrices cannot simply be written down. In all dimensions the rotations are fully described by the planes of rotation and their associated angles, so it is useful to be able to determine them, or at least find ways to describe them mathematically.\n\n===Reflections===\n[[File:Simx2=rotOK.svg|right|thumb|200px|Two different reflections in two dimensions generating a rotation.]]\nEvery simple rotation can be generated by two [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s. Reflections can be specified in {{mvar|n}} dimensions by giving an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional subspace to reflect in, so a two-dimensional reflection is in a line, a three-dimensional reflection is in a plane, and so on. But this becomes increasingly difficult to apply in higher dimensions, so it is better to use vectors instead, as follows.\n\nA reflection in {{mvar|n}} dimensions is specified by a vector perpendicular to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional subspace. To generate simple rotations only reflections that fix the origin are needed, so the vector does not have a position, just direction. It does also not matter which way it is facing: it can be replaced with its negative without changing the result. Similarly [[unit vector]]s can be used to simplify the calculations.\n\nSo the reflection in a {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional space is given by the unit vector perpendicular to it, {{math|'''m'''}}, thus:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}' = -\\mathbf{mxm} \\, </math>\n\nwhere the product is the geometric product from [[geometric algebra]].\n\nIf {{math|'''x′'''}} is reflected in another, distinct, {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-dimensional space, described by a unit vector {{math|'''n'''}} perpendicular to it, the result is\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}'' = -\\mathbf{nx}'\\mathbf{n} = -\\mathbf{n}(-\\mathbf{mxm})\\mathbf{n} = \\mathbf{nmxmn}</math>\n\nThis is a simple rotation in {{mvar|n}} dimensions, through twice the angle between the subspaces, which is also the angle between the vectors '''m''' and {{math|'''n'''}}. It can be checked using geometric algebra that this is a rotation, and that it rotates all vectors as expected.\n\nThe quantity {{math|'''mn'''}} is a [[rotor (mathematics)|rotor]], and {{math|'''nm'''}} is its inverse as\n\n:<math>(\\mathbf{mn})(\\mathbf{nm}) = \\mathbf{mnnm} = \\mathbf{mm} = 1</math>\n\nSo the rotation can be written\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}'' = R\\mathbf{x}R^{-1}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''R'' {{=}} '''mn'''}} is the rotor.\n\nThe plane of rotation is the plane containing {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''n'''}}, which must be distinct otherwise the reflections are the same and no rotation takes place. As either vector can be replaced by its negative the angle between them can always be acute, or at most {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}. The rotation is through ''twice'' the angle between the vectors, up to {{pi}} or a half-turn. The sense of the rotation is to rotate from {{math|'''m'''}} towards {{math|'''n'''}}: the geometric product is not [[commutative]] so the product {{math|'''nm'''}} is the inverse rotation, with sense from {{math|'''n'''}} to {{math|'''m'''}}.\n\nConversely all simple rotations can be generated this way, with two reflections, by two unit vectors in the plane of rotation separated by half the desired angle of rotation. These can be composed to produce more general rotations, using up to {{mvar|n}} reflections if the dimension {{mvar|n}} is even, {{math|''n'' − 2}} if {{mvar|n}} is odd, by choosing pairs of reflections given by two vectors in each plane of rotation.<ref>Lounesto (2001) p. 57–58</ref><ref>Hestenes (1999) p. 278–280</ref>\n\n===Bivectors===\n[[Bivector]]s are quantities from [[geometric algebra]], [[clifford algebra]] and the [[exterior algebra]], which generalise the idea of vectors into two dimensions. As vectors are to lines, so are bivectors to planes. So every plane (in any dimension) can be associated with a bivector, and every [[Bivector#Simple bivectors|simple bivector]] is associated with a plane. This makes them a good fit for describing planes of rotation.\n\nEvery rotation plane in a rotation has a simple bivector associated with it. This is parallel to the plane and has magnitude equal to the angle of rotation in the plane. These bivectors are summed to produce a single, generally non-simple, bivector for the whole rotation. This can generate a [[Rotor (mathematics)|rotor]] through the [[exponential function|exponential map]], which can be used to rotate an object.\n\nBivectors are related to rotors through the exponential map (which applied to bivectors generates rotors and rotations using [[De Moivre's formula]]). In particular given any bivector {{math|'''B'''}} the rotor associated with it is\n\n:<math>R_{\\mathbf{B}} = e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{2}}.</math>\n\nThis is a simple rotation if the bivector is simple, a more general rotation otherwise. When squared,\n\n:<math>{R_{\\mathbf{B}}}^2 = e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{2}}e^{\\frac{\\mathbf{B}}{2}} = e^{\\mathbf{B}},</math>\n\nit gives a rotor that rotates through twice the angle. If {{math|'''B'''}} is simple then this is the same rotation as is generated by two reflections, as the product {{math|'''mn'''}} gives a rotation through twice the angle between the vectors. These can be equated,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{mn} = e^{\\mathbf{B}},</math>\n\nfrom which it follows that the bivector associated with the plane of rotation containing {{math|'''m'''}} and {{math|'''n'''}} that rotates {{math|'''m'''}} to {{math|'''n'''}} is\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{B} = \\log(\\mathbf{mn}).</math>\n\nThis is a simple bivector, associated with the simple rotation described. More general rotations in four or more dimensions are associated with sums of simple bivectors, one for each plane of rotation, calculated as above.\n\nExamples include the two rotations in four dimensions given above. The simple rotation in the {{mvar|zw}}-plane by an angle {{mvar|θ}} has bivector {{math|'''e'''<sub>34</sub>''θ''}}, a simple bivector. The double rotation by {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} in the {{mvar|xy}}-plane and {{mvar|zw}}-planes has bivector {{math|'''e'''<sub>12</sub>''α'' + '''e'''<sub>34</sub>''β''}}, the sum of two simple bivectors {{math|'''e'''<sub>12</sub>''α''}} and {{math|'''e'''<sub>34</sub>''β''}} which are parallel to the two planes of rotation and have magnitudes equal to the angles of rotation.\n\nGiven a rotor the bivector associated with it can be recovered by taking the logarithm of the rotor, which can then be split into simple bivectors to determine the planes of rotation, although in practice for all but the simplest of cases this may be impractical. But given the simple bivectors geometric algebra is a useful tool for studying planes of rotation using algebra like the above.<ref name = \"LounestoCh17\"/><ref>Dorst, Doran, Lasenby (2002) pp. 79–89</ref>\n\n===Eigenvalues and eigenplanes===\nThe planes of rotations for a particular rotation using the [[eigenvalue]]s. Given a general rotation matrix in {{mvar|n}} dimensions its [[secular equation|characteristic equation]] has either one (in odd dimensions) or zero (in even dimensions) real roots. The other roots are in complex conjugate pairs, exactly\n\n:<math>\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor,</math>\n\nsuch pairs. These correspond to the planes of rotation, the [[eigenplane]]s of the matrix, which can be calculated using algebraic techniques. In addition [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]]s of the complex roots are the magnitudes of the bivectors associated with the planes of rotations. The form of the characteristic equation is related to the planes, making it possible to relate its algebraic properties like repeated roots to the bivectors, where repeated bivector magnitudes have particular geometric interpretations.<ref name = \"LounestoCh17\"/><ref>Dorst, Doran, Lasenby (2002) pp. 145–154</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Charts on SO(3)]]\n* [[Givens rotation]]\n* [[Quaternions]]\n* [[Rotation group SO(3)]]\n* [[Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n| title=New Foundations for Classical Mechanics\n| author = Hestenes, David\n| authorlink = David Hestenes\n| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AlvTCEzSI5wC\n| isbn=0-7923-5302-1\n| edition=2nd\n| year=1999\n| publisher= [[Kluwer]]}}\n* {{cite book\n| title=Clifford algebras and spinors\n| author = Lounesto, Pertti\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsybQWDK4oC\n| publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]\n| location=Cambridge\n| isbn=978-0-521-00551-7\n| year=2001}}\n* {{cite book\n| title= Applications of geometric algebra in computer science and engineering\n| author1 = Dorst, Leo\n| author2 = Doran, Chris\n| author3 = Lasenby, Joan\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NpJRkQfgtwUC\n| publisher=[[Birkhäuser Verlag|Birkhäuser]]\n| isbn= 0-8176-4267-6\n| year=2002}}\n\n{{Dimension topics}}\n\n[[Category:Geometric algebra]]\n[[Category:Rotation in three dimensions]]\n[[Category:Rotational symmetry]]\n[[Category:Orientation (geometry)]]"

      "text": "{{about|the classic case of lines in projective 3-space|general Plücker coordinates|Plücker embedding}}\n\n{{No footnotes|date=February 2011}}\n\nIn [[geometry]], '''Plücker coordinates''', introduced by [[Julius Plücker]] in the 19th century, are a way to assign six [[homogeneous coordinates]] to each [[line (mathematics)|line]] in [[projective space|projective 3-space]], '''P'''<sup>3</sup>. Because they satisfy a quadratic constraint, they establish a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the 4-dimensional space of lines in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> and points on a [[quadric (projective geometry)|quadric]] in '''P'''<sup>5</sup> (projective 5-space). A predecessor and special case of [[Grassmann coordinates]] (which describe ''k''-dimensional linear subspaces, or ''flats'', in an ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]), Plücker coordinates arise naturally in [[geometric algebra]]. They have proved useful for [[computer graphics]], and also can be extended to coordinates for the [[screw theory|screws and wrenches]] in the theory of [[kinematics]] used for [[robot control]].\n\n== Geometric intuition ==\n[[File:Plücker line coordinate geometry.png|thumb|right|Displacement and moment of two points on line]]\nA line ''L'' in 3-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is determined by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points '''''x'''''&nbsp;= (''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>) and '''''y'''''&nbsp;= (''y''<sub>1</sub>,''y''<sub>2</sub>,''y''<sub>3</sub>). The vector displacement from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''' is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents the ''direction'' of the line. That is, every displacement between points on ''L'' is a scalar multiple of '''''d'''''&nbsp;= '''''y'''''&nbsp;−&nbsp;'''''x'''''. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from '''''x''''' to '''''y''''', it would have a [[moment (physics)|moment]] about the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing ''L'' and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is '''''m'''''&nbsp;= '''''x'''''×'''''y''''', where \"×\" denotes the vector [[cross product]]. For a fixed line, ''L'', the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between '''''x''''' and '''''y''''', considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&nbsp;= 0, where \"•\" denotes the vector [[dot product]].\n\nAlthough neither '''''d''''' nor '''''m''''' alone is sufficient to determine ''L'', together the pair does so uniquely, up to a common (nonzero) scalar multiple which depends on the distance between '''''x''''' and '''''y'''''. That is, the coordinates\n\n: ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') = (''d''<sub>1</sub>:''d''<sub>2</sub>:''d''<sub>3</sub>:''m''<sub>1</sub>:''m''<sub>2</sub>:''m''<sub>3</sub>)\n\nmay be considered [[homogeneous coordinates]] for ''L'', in the sense that all pairs (''λ'''d''''':''λ'''m'''''), for ''λ''&nbsp;≠ 0, can be produced by points on ''L'' and only ''L'', and any such pair determines a unique line so long as '''''d''''' is not zero and '''''d'''''•'''''m'''''&nbsp;= 0. Furthermore, this approach extends to include [[point at infinity|points]], [[line at infinity|lines]], and a [[plane at infinity|plane]] \"at infinity\", in the sense of [[projective geometry]].\n\n: '''Example.''' Let '''''x'''''&nbsp;= (2,3,7) and '''''y'''''&nbsp;= (2,1,0). Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).\n\nAlternatively, let the equations for points '''''x''''' of two distinct planes containing ''L'' be\n\n: 0 = ''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x'''''\n: 0 = ''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''' .\n\nThen their respective planes are perpendicular to vectors '''''a''''' and '''''b''''', and the direction of ''L'' must be perpendicular to both. Hence we may set '''''d'''''&nbsp;= '''''a'''''×'''''b''''', which is nonzero because '''''a''''' and '''''b''''' are neither zero nor parallel (the planes being distinct and intersecting). If point '''''x''''' satisfies both plane equations, then it also satisfies the linear combination\n\n:{|\n|-\n| 0 || = ''a'' (''b'' + '''''b'''''•'''''x''''') − ''b'' (''a'' + '''''a'''''•'''''x''''')\n|-\n| || = (''a'' '''''b''''' − ''b'' '''''a''''')•'''''x''''' .\n|}\n\nThat is, '''''m'''''&nbsp;= ''a''&nbsp;'''''b'''''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;'''''a''''' is a vector perpendicular to displacements to points on ''L'' from the origin; it is, in fact, a moment consistent with the '''''d''''' previously defined from '''''a''''' and '''''b'''''.\n\nproof：need to show '''''m'''''&nbsp;= ''a''&nbsp;'''''b'''''&nbsp;−&nbsp;''b''&nbsp;'''''a = r×d = r× a×b, let  a•a = b•b = 1'''''\n[[File:BaiduShurufa 2018-9-29 20-38-43.png|thumb|plane orthogonal to the line and include the origin]]\npoint B is the origin.  the line is pass point D and orthogonal to the plane, the 2 plane pass CD and DE both orthogonal to the plane, BD is diameter\n\n: '''''a ='''''  BE/ ||BE||,  '''''b =''''' BC/ ||BC||，'''''r''''' = BD,  −a = ||BF|| = ||BE||，−b = ||BG|| = ||BC||, '''''m'''''= a'''''b'''''−b'''''a =''''' FG,  ||'''''d''&nbsp;|| = || ''a''×''b'' ||''' = sin(FBG)\n\nangle BCE = BDE = BGF, so points D,G,E,H on a circle, and angle GHG is right angle, FG orthogonal to BD, so 4 points C, D, H, F on a circle, and \n\n||BF||&nbsp;||BC|| = ||BH||&nbsp;||BD||, that is ''ab''&nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||BH||&nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&nbsp;sin(FBG), 2&middot;area of triangle BFG = ''ab''&middot;sin(FBG) =  ||BH||&nbsp;||FG|| = ||BH||&nbsp;||'''''r'''''||&nbsp;sin(FBG), \n||'''''m'''''|| = ||FG|| = ||'''''r'''''||&nbsp;sin(FBG) = ||'''''r'''''||&nbsp;||'''''d&nbsp;||,''''' check direction and '''''m = r''×''d.'''''\n\nwhen ||'''''r'''''|| = 0, the line is the one pass origin with direction '''''d'''''; if ||'''''r'''''|| > 0,  the line is with direction '''''d,''''' the plane including the origin and the line has normal vector '''''m''''', the line is tangent to a circle on the plane centered origin and with radius ||''r''|| at point '''''r'''''.\n\n: '''Example.'''

Then ('''''d''''':'''''m''''')&nbsp;= (0:−2:−7:−7:14:−4).\n\nAlthough the usual algebraic definition tends to obscure the relationship, ('''''d''''':'''''m''''') are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''.\n\n== Algebraic definition ==\n\n=== Primal coordinates ===\nIn a 3-dimensional projective space '''P'''<sup>3</sup>, let ''L'' be a line through distinct points '''x''' and '''y''' with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''x''<sub>0</sub>:''x''<sub>1</sub>:''x''<sub>2</sub>:''x''<sub>3</sub>) and (''y''<sub>0</sub>:''y''<sub>1</sub>:''y''<sub>2</sub>:''y''<sub>3</sub>).\nThe Plücker coordinates ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub> are defined as follows:\n:{|\n|-\n| <math>p_{ij} </math> || <math> {}= \\begin{vmatrix} x_{i} & y_{i} \\\\ x_{j} & y_{j}\\end{vmatrix} = x_{i}y_{j}-x_{j}y_{i} . </math>\n|}\nThis implies ''p''<sub>''ii''</sub>&nbsp;= 0 and ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;= −''p''<sub>''ji''</sub>, reducing the possibilities to only six (4 [[binomial coefficient|choose]] 2) independent quantities. The sixtuple\n\n: <math>(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) </math>\n\nis uniquely determined by ''L'' up to a common nonzero scale factor. Furthermore, not all six components can be zero.\nThus the Plücker coordinates of ''L'' may be considered as homogeneous coordinates of a point in a 5-dimensional projective space, as suggested by the colon notation.\n\nTo see these facts, let ''M'' be the 4×2 matrix with the point coordinates as columns.\n\n: <math> M = \\begin{bmatrix} x_0 &  y_0 \\\\ x_1 & y_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 \\\\ x_3 & y_3 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nThe Plücker coordinate ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub> is the determinant of rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M''.\nBecause '''x''' and '''y''' are distinct points, the columns of ''M'' are [[linear independence|linearly independent]]; ''M'' has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] 2. Let ''M&prime;'' be a second matrix, with columns '''x&prime;''' and '''y&prime;''' a different pair of distinct points on ''L''. Then the columns of ''M&prime;'' are [[linear combination]]s of the columns of ''M''; so for some 2×2 [[nonsingular matrix]] Λ,\n\n: <math> M' = M\\Lambda . </math>\n\nIn particular, rows ''i'' and ''j'' of ''M&prime;'' and ''M'' are related by\n\n: <math> \\begin{bmatrix} x'_{i} & y'_{i}\\\\x'_{j}& y'_{j} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{i} & y_{i}\\\\x_{j}& y_{j} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\lambda_{00} & \\lambda_{01} \\\\ \\lambda_{10} & \\lambda_{11} \\end{bmatrix} . </math>\n\nTherefore, the determinant of the left side 2×2 matrix equals the product of the determinants of the right side 2×2 matrices, the latter of which is a fixed scalar, det&nbsp;Λ. Furthermore, all six 2×2 subdeterminants in ''M'' cannot be zero because the rank of ''M'' is 2.\n\n=== Plücker map ===\nDenote the set of all lines (linear images of '''P'''<sup>1</sup>) in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> by ''G''<sub>1,3</sub>.  We thus have a map:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha \\colon \\mathrm{G}_{1,3} & \\rightarrow \\mathbf{P}^5 \\\\\nL & \\mapsto L^{\\alpha},\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere\n:<math> L^{\\alpha}=(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12}) . </math>\n\n=== Dual coordinates ===\nAlternatively, a line can be described as the intersection of two planes. Let ''L'' \nbe a line contained in distinct planes '''a''' and '''b''' with homogeneous coefficients (''a''<sup>0</sup>:''a''<sup>1</sup>:''a''<sup>2</sup>:''a''<sup>3</sup>) and (''b''<sup>0</sup>:''b''<sup>1</sup>:''b''<sup>2</sup>:''b''<sup>3</sup>), respectively. (The first plane equation is ∑<sub>''k''</sub>&nbsp;''a''<sup>''k''</sup>''x''<sub>''k''</sub>=0, for example.) The dual Plücker coordinate ''p''<sup>''ij''</sup> is\n\n:{|\n|-\n| <math>p^{ij} </math> || <math> {}= \\begin{vmatrix} a^{i} & a^{j} \\\\ b^{i} & b^{j}\\end{vmatrix}  = a^{i}b^{j}-a^{j}b^{i} . </math>\n|}\n\nDual coordinates are convenient in some computations, and they are equivalent to primary coordinates:\n: <math>\n(p_{01}:p_{02}:p_{03}:p_{23}:p_{31}:p_{12})=\n(p^{23}:p^{31}:p^{12}:p^{01}:p^{02}:p^{03})\n</math>\nHere, equality between the two vectors in homogeneous coordinates means that the numbers on the right side are equal to the numbers on the left side up to some common scaling factor <math>\\lambda</math>. Specifically, let (''i'',''j'',''k'',''ℓ'') be an [[even permutation]] of (0,1,2,3); then\n\n: <math>p_{ij} = \\lambda p^{k\\ell} .  </math>\n\n=== Geometry ===\nTo relate back to the geometric intuition, take ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 0 as the plane at infinity; thus the coordinates of points ''not'' at infinity can be normalized so that ''x''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;= 1.

This implies that all 3×3 submatrices have determinant zero, generating four (4 choose 3) plane equations, such as\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\begin{vmatrix} x_0 & y_0 & z_0 \\\\ x_1 & y_1 & z_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 & z_2 \\end{vmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\begin{vmatrix} x_1 & y_1 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 \\end{vmatrix} z_0 - \\begin{vmatrix} x_0 & y_0 \\\\ x_2 & y_2 \\end{vmatrix} z_1 + \\begin{vmatrix} x_0 & y_0 \\\\ x_1 & y_1 \\end{vmatrix} z_2 \\\\[5pt]\n& = p_{12} z_0 - p_{02} z_1 + p_{01} z_2 . \\\\[5pt]\n& = p^{03} z_0 + p^{13} z_1 + p^{23} z_2 .\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe four possible planes obtained are as follows.\n\n: <math> \\begin{matrix}\n0 & = & {}+ p_{12} z_0 & {}- p_{02} z_1 & {}+ p_{01} z_2 & \\\\\n0 & = & {}- p_{31} z_0 & {}- p_{03} z_1 & & {}+ p_{01} z_3 \\\\\n0 & = & {}+p_{23} z_0 & & {}- p_{03} z_2 & {}+ p_{02} z_3 \\\\\n0 & = & & {}+p_{23} z_1 & {}+ p_{31} z_2 & {}+ p_{12} z_3\n\\end{matrix} </math>\n\nUsing dual coordinates, and letting (''a''<sup>0</sup>:''a''<sup>1</sup>:''a''<sup>2</sup>:''a''<sup>3</sup>) be the line coefficients, each of these is simply ''a''<sup>''i''</sup>&nbsp;= ''p''<sup>''ij''</sup>, or\n\n: <math> 0 = \\sum_{i=0}^3 p^{ij} z_i , \\qquad j = 0,\\ldots,3 . </math>\n\nEach Plücker coordinate appears in two of the four equations, each time multiplying a different variable; and as at least one of the coordinates is nonzero, we are guaranteed non-vacuous equations for two distinct planes intersecting in ''L''. Thus the Plücker coordinates of a line determine that line uniquely, and the map α is an [[Injective function|injection]].\n\n=== Quadratic relation ===\nThe image of α is not the complete set of points in '''P'''<sup>5</sup>; the Plücker coordinates of a line ''L'' satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = p_{01}p^{01}+p_{02}p^{02}+p_{03}p^{03} \\\\\n& = p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nFor proof, write this homogeneous polynomial as determinants and use [[Laplace expansion]] (in reverse).\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\begin{vmatrix}x_0&y_0\\\\x_1&y_1\\end{vmatrix}\\begin{vmatrix}x_2&y_2\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}+\n\\begin{vmatrix}x_0&y_0\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{vmatrix}\\begin{vmatrix}x_3&y_3\\\\x_1&y_1\\end{vmatrix}+\n\\begin{vmatrix}x_0&y_0\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n& = (x_0 y_1-y_0 x_1)\\begin{vmatrix}x_2&y_2\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}-\n(x_0 y_2-y_0 x_2)\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}+\n(x_0 y_3-y_0 x_3)\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{vmatrix} \\\\[5pt]\n& = x_0 \\left(y_1\\begin{vmatrix}x_2&y_2\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}-\ny_2\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}+\ny_3\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{vmatrix}\\right)\n-y_0 \\left(x_1\\begin{vmatrix}x_2&y_2\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}-\nx_2\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}+\nx_3\\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1\\\\x_2&y_2\\end{vmatrix}\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n& = x_0 \\begin{vmatrix}x_1&y_1&y_1\\\\x_2&y_2&y_2\\\\x_3&y_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}\n-y_0 \\begin{vmatrix}x_1&x_1&y_1\\\\x_2&x_2&y_2\\\\x_3&x_3&y_3\\end{vmatrix}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nSince both 3×3 determinants have duplicate columns, the right hand side is identically zero.\n\nAnother proof may be done like this:\nSince vector\n\n: <math> d = \\left( p_{01}, p_{02}, p_{03} \\right) </math>\n\nis perpendicular to vector\n\n: <math> m = \\left( p_{23}, p_{31}, p_{12} \\right) </math>\n\n(see above), the scalar product of ''d'' and ''m'' must be zero! q.e.d.\n\n=== Point equations ===\nLetting (''x''<sub>0</sub>:''x''<sub>1</sub>:''x''<sub>2</sub>:''x''<sub>3</sub>) be the point coordinates, four possible points on a line each have coordinates ''x''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;= ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub>, for ''j''&nbsp;= 0…3. Some of these possible points may be inadmissible because all coordinates are zero, but since at least one Plücker coordinate is nonzero, at least two distinct points are guaranteed.\n\n=== Bijectivity ===\nIf (''q''<sub>01</sub>:''q''<sub>02</sub>:''q''<sub>03</sub>:''q''<sub>23</sub>:''q''<sub>31</sub>:''q''<sub>12</sub>) are the homogeneous coordinates of a point in '''P'''<sup>5</sup>, without loss of generality assume that ''q''<sub>01</sub> is nonzero. Then the matrix\n\n: <math> M = \\begin{bmatrix} q_{01} & 0 \\\\ 0 & q_{01} \\\\ -q_{12} & q_{02} \\\\ q_{31} & q_{03} \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nhas rank 2, and so its columns are distinct points defining a line ''L''. When the '''P'''<sup>5</sup> coordinates, ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub>, satisfy the quadratic Plücker relation, they are the Plücker coordinates of ''L''. To see this, first normalize ''q''<sub>01</sub> to 1. Then we immediately have that for the Plücker coordinates computed from ''M'', ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;= ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub>, except for\n\n: <math> p_{23} = - q_{03} q_{12} - q_{02} q_{31} . </math>\n\nBut if the ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub> satisfy the Plücker relation ''q''<sub>23</sub>+''q''<sub>02</sub>''q''<sub>31</sub>+''q''<sub>03</sub>''q''<sub>12</sub>&nbsp;= 0, then ''p''<sub>''23''</sub>&nbsp;= ''q''<sub>''23''</sub>, completing the set of identities.\n\nConsequently, α is a [[surjection]] onto the [[algebraic variety]] consisting of the set of zeros of the quadratic polynomial\n\n: <math> p_{01}p_{23}+p_{02}p_{31}+p_{03}p_{12} . </math>\n\nAnd since α is also an injection, the lines in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> are thus in [[bijection|bijective]] correspondence with the points of this [[quadric]] in '''P'''<sup>5</sup>, called the Plücker quadric or [[Klein quadric]].\n\n==Uses==\nPlücker coordinates allow concise solutions to problems of line geometry in 3-dimensional space, especially those involving [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]].\n\n=== Line-line crossing ===\nTwo lines in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> are either [[skew lines|skew]] or [[coplanar]], and in the latter case they are either coincident or intersect in a unique point. If ''p''<sub>''ij''</sub> and ''p''&prime;<sub>''ij''</sub> are the Plücker coordinates of two lines, then they are coplanar precisely when '''''d'''''⋅'''''m'''''&prime;+'''''m'''''⋅'''''d'''''&prime;&nbsp;= 0, as shown by\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = p_{01}p'_{23} + p_{02}p'_{31} + p_{03}p'_{12} + p_{23}p'_{01} + p_{31}p'_{02} + p_{12}p'_{03} \\\\[5pt]\n& = \\begin{vmatrix}x_0&y_0&x'_0&y'_0\\\\\nx_1&y_1&x'_1&y'_1\\\\\nx_2&y_2&x'_2&y'_2\\\\\nx_3&y_3&x'_3&y'_3\\end{vmatrix}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nWhen the lines are skew, the sign of the result indicates the sense of crossing: positive if a right-handed screw takes ''L'' into ''L''&prime;, else negative.\n\nThe quadratic Plücker relation essentially states that a line is coplanar with itself.\n\n=== Line-line join ===\nIn the event that two lines are coplanar but not parallel, their common plane has equation\n\n: 0 = ('''''m'''''•'''''d'''''&prime;)''x''<sub>0</sub> + ('''''d'''''×'''''d'''''&prime;)•'''''x''''' ,\n\nwhere '''''x'''''&nbsp;= (''x''<sub>1</sub>,''x''<sub>2</sub>,''x''<sub>3</sub>).\n\nThe slightest perturbation will destroy the existence of a common plane, and near-parallelism of the lines will cause numeric difficulties in finding such a plane even if it does exist.\n\n=== Line-line meet ===\nDually, two coplanar lines, neither of which contains the origin, have common point\n\n: (''x''<sub>0</sub> : '''''x''''') = ('''d'''•'''m'''&prime;:'''m'''×'''m'''&prime;) .\n\nTo handle lines not meeting this restriction, see the references.\n\n=== Plane-line meet ===\nGiven a plane with equation\n\n: <math> 0 =  a^0x_0 + a^1x_1 + a^2x_2 + a^3x_3 , </math>\n\nor more concisely 0&nbsp;= ''a''<sup>0</sup>''x''<sub>0</sub>+'''''a'''''•'''''x'''''; and given a line not in it with Plücker coordinates ('''''d''''':'''''m'''''), then their point of intersection is\n\n: (''x''<sub>0</sub> : '''''x''''') = ('''''a'''''•'''''d''''' : '''''a'''''×'''''m''''' − ''a''<sub>0</sub>'''''d''''') .\n\nThe point coordinates, (''x''<sub>0</sub>:''x''<sub>1</sub>:''x''<sub>2</sub>:''x''<sub>3</sub>), can also be expressed in terms of Plücker coordinates as\n\n: <math> x_i = \\sum_{j \\ne i} a^j p_{ij} , \\qquad i = 0 \\ldots 3 . </math>\n\n=== Point-line join ===\nDually, given a point (''y''<sub>0</sub>:'''''y''''') and a line not containing it, their common plane has equation\n\n: 0 = ('''''y'''''•'''''m''''') ''x''<sub>0</sub> + ('''''y'''''×'''''d'''''−''y''<sub>0</sub>'''''m''''')•'''''x''''' .\n\nThe plane coordinates, (''a''<sup>0</sup>:''a''<sup>1</sup>:''a''<sup>2</sup>:''a''<sup>3</sup>), can also be expressed in terms of dual Plücker coordinates as\n\n: <math> a^i = \\sum_{j \\ne i} y_j p^{ij} , \\qquad i = 0 \\ldots 3 . </math>\n\n=== Line families ===\nBecause the [[Klein quadric]] is in '''P'''<sup>5</sup>, it contains linear subspaces of dimensions one and two (but no higher). These correspond to one- and two-parameter families of lines in '''P'''<sup>3</sup>.\n\nFor example, suppose ''L'' and ''L''&prime; are distinct lines in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> determined by points '''x''', '''y''' and '''x'''&prime;, '''y'''&prime;, respectively. Linear combinations of their determining points give linear combinations of their Plücker coordinates, generating a one-parameter family of lines containing ''L'' and ''L''&prime;. This corresponds to a one-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.\n\n==== Lines in plane ====\nIf three distinct and non-parallel lines are coplanar; their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines in the plane. This corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.\n\n==== Lines through point ====\nIf three distinct and non-coplanar lines intersect in a point, their linear combinations generate a two-parameter family of lines, all the lines through the point. This also corresponds to a two-dimensional linear subspace belonging to the Klein quadric.\n\n==== Ruled surface ====\nA [[ruled surface]] is a family of lines that is not necessarily linear. It corresponds to a curve on the Klein quadric. For example, a [[hyperboloid of one sheet]] is a quadric surface in '''P'''<sup>3</sup> ruled by two different families of lines, one line of each passing through each point of the surface; each family corresponds under the Plücker map to a [[conic section]] within the Klein quadric in '''P'''<sup>5</sup>.\n\n=== Line geometry ===\nDuring the nineteenth century, ''line geometry'' was studied intensively. In terms of the bijection given above, this is a description of the intrinsic geometry of the Klein quadric.\n\n==== Ray tracing ====\nLine geometry is extensively used in [[Ray_tracing_(graphics)|ray tracing]] application where the geometry and intersections of rays need to be calculated in 3D. An implementation is described in\n[http://www.flipcode.com/archives/Introduction_To_Plcker_Coordinates.shtml Introduction to Plücker Coordinates] written for the Ray Tracing forum by Thouis Jones.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Real projective plane#The flat projective plane|Flat projective plane]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Hodge\n  | first = W.

Yet defense is mounted on the basis of practicality: it is useful for describing quantum states of excitation of a free field, electromagnetic fields acting on a medium, vacuum excitation of virtual positron-electron pairs, and presenting the photon among quantum particles that do have wave functions.\n\n===Schrödinger equation for the photon and the Heisenberg uncertainty relations===\n\nMultiplying the two time dependent Maxwell equations by <math>\\hbar</math> \nthe  Schrödinger equation for photon in the vacuum is given by\n\n:<math>i \\hbar \\partial_{t} {\\mathbf F}=c (\\mathbf S \\cdot {\\hbar \\over i} \\nabla) \\mathbf F = c (\\mathbf S \\cdot \\mathbf p ) \\mathbf F</math>\n\nwhere <math>{\\mathbf S}</math> is the vector built from the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] of the length 1 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]  generating full infinitesimal rotations of 3-spinor particle.

Some authors restrict this to the [[infinite-dimensional]] case.\n\nThe universal geometric algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(n,n)</math> of order {{math|[[power of two|2]]<sup>2''n''</sup>}} is defined as the [[Clifford algebra]] of {{math|2''n''}}-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] [[pseudo-Euclidean space]] {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n'', ''n''</sup>}}.<ref>Pozo, José María; Sobczyk, Garret. ''[http://garretstar.com/secciones/publications/docs/GJFINPDF.PDF Geometric Algebra in Linear Algebra and Geometry]''</ref> This algebra is also called the \"mother algebra\". It has a nondegenerate signature. The vectors in this space generate the algebra through the [[geometric algebra|geometric product]]. This product makes the manipulation of vectors more similar to the familiar algebraic rules, although non-[[abelian algebra|commutative]].\n\nWhen {{math|1=''n'' = ∞}}, i.e. there are [[countably many]] dimensions, then <math>\\mathcal{G}(\\infty,\\infty)</math> is called simply the ''universal geometric algebra'' (UGA), which contains vector spaces such as {{math|'''R'''<sup>''p'', ''q''</sup>}} and their respective geometric algebras <math>\\mathcal{G}(p,q)</math>. A special case is the algebra of spacetime, [[spacetime algebra|STA]].\n\nUGA contains all finite-dimensional geometric algebras (GA).\n\nThe elements of UGA are called multivectors. Every multivector can be written as the sum of several {{mvar|r}}-vectors. Some ''r''-vectors are [[scalar (mathematics)|scalars]] ({{math|1=''r'' = 0}}), [[vector space|vectors]] ({{math|1=''r'' = 1}}) and [[bivector]]s ({{math|1=''r'' = 2}}). Scalars are identical to the real numbers. Complex number are not used as scalars because there already exist structures in UGA that are equivalent to the complex numbers.\n\nOne may generate a finite-dimensional GA by choosing a unit pseudoscalar ({{math|''I''}}). The set of all vectors that satisfy\n\n: <math>a\\wedge I=0</math>\n\nis a vector space. The geometric product of the vectors in this vector space then defines the GA, of which {{math|''I''}} is a member. Since every finite-dimensional GA has a unique {{math|''I''}} ([[up to]] a sign), one can define or characterize the GA by it. A pseudoscalar can be interpreted as an ''n''-plane segment of unit area in an ''n''-dimensional vector space.\n\n== Vector manifolds ==\nA '''vector manifold''' is a special set of vectors in the UGA.<ref>Chapter 1 of: [D. Hestenes & G. Sobczyk] From Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus</ref> These vectors generate a set of linear spaces tangent to the vector manifold. Vector manifolds were introduced to do calculus on manifolds so one can define (differentiable) [[manifold]]s as a set isomorphic to a vector manifold. The difference lies in that a vector manifold is algebraically rich while a manifold is not. Since this is the primary motivation for vector manifolds the following interpretation is rewarding.\n\nConsider a vector manifold as a special set of \"points\". These points are members of an algebra and so can be added and multiplied. These points generate a [[tangent space]] of definite dimension \"at\" each point. This tangent space generates a (unit) [[pseudoscalar]] which is a function of the points of the vector manifold. A vector manifold is characterized by its pseudoscalar. The pseudoscalar can be interpreted as a tangent oriented {{mvar|n}}-plane segment of unit area. Bearing this in mind, a manifold looks locally like [[real coordinate space|{{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}]] at every point.\n\nAlthough a vector manifold can be treated as a completely abstract object, a geometric algebra is created so that every element of the algebra represents a geometric object and algebraic operations such as adding and multiplying correspond to geometric transformations.\n\nConsider a set of vectors {{math|1={''x''} = ''M''<sup>''n''</sup>}} in UGA. If this set of vectors generates a set of \"tangent\" simple {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-vectors, which is to say\n\n: <math> \\forall x\\in M^n: \\exists I_n(x)=x\\wedge A(x) \\mid I_n(x)\\lor M_n=x </math>\n\nthen {{math|''M''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a vector manifold, the value of {{mvar|A}} is that of a simple {{mvar|n}}-vector. If one interprets these vectors as points then {{math|''I''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} is the pseudoscalar of an algebra tangent to {{math|''M''<sup>''n''</sup>}} at {{mvar|x}}. {{math|''I''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} can be interpreted as a unit area at an [[orientation (vector space)|oriented]] {{mvar|n}}-plane: this is why it is labeled with {{mvar|n}}. The function {{math|''I''<sub>''n''</sub>}} gives a distribution of these tangent ''n''-planes over {{math|''M''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nA vector manifold is defined similarly to how a particular GA can be defined, by its unit pseudoscalar. The set {{math|{''x''} }} is not closed under addition and multiplication by scalars. This set is ''not'' a vector space. At every point the vectors generate a tangent space of definite dimension. The vectors in this tangent space are different from the vectors of the vector manifold. In comparison to the original set they are bivectors, but since they span a linear space—the tangent space—they are also referred to as vectors. Notice that the dimension of this space is the dimension of the manifold. This linear space generates an algebra and its unit pseudoscalar characterizes the vector manifold. This is the manner in which the set of abstract vectors {{math|{''x''} }} defines the vector manifold. Once the set of \"points\" generates the \"tangent space\" the \"tangent algebra\" and its \"pseudoscalar\" follow immediately.\n\nThe unit pseudoscalar of the vector manifold is a (pseudoscalar-valued) function of the points on the vector manifold. If i.e. this function is smooth then one says that the vector manifold is smooth.<ref name=\"four\">Chapter 4 of: [D. Hestenes & G. Sobczyk] From Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus</ref> A [[manifold]] can be defined as a set isomorphic{{how|date=May 2013}} to a vector manifold. The points of a manifold do not have any algebraic structure and pertain only to the set itself. This is the main difference between a vector manifold and a manifold that is isomorphic. A vector manifold is always a subset of Universal Geometric Algebra by definition and the elements can be manipulated algebraically. In contrast, a manifold is not a subset of any set other than itself, but the elements have no algebraic relation among them.\n\nThe [[differential geometry]] of a manifold<ref name=\"four\"/> can be carried out in a vector manifold. All quantities relevant to differential geometry can be calculated from {{math|''I''<sub>''n''</sub>(''x'')}} if it is a differentiable function. This is the original motivation behind its definition. Vector manifolds allow an approach to the differential geometry of manifolds alternative to the \"build-up\" approach where structures such as [[metric tensor|metrics]], [[affine connection|connections]] and [[fiber bundle]]s are introduced as needed.<ref>Chapter 5 of: [D.

Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers, and for many years he had known how to add and subtract triples of numbers. However, Hamilton had been stuck on the problem of multiplication and division for a long time. He could not figure out how to calculate the [[quotient]] of the coordinates of two points in space.\n\nThe great breakthrough in quaternions finally came on Monday 16&nbsp;October 1843 in [[Dublin]], when Hamilton was on his way to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] where he was going to preside at a council meeting. As he walked along the towpath of the [[Royal Canal]] with his wife, the concepts behind quaternions were taking shape in his mind. When the answer dawned on him, Hamilton could not resist the urge to carve the formula for the quaternions,\n:<math>\\mathbf{i}^2 = \\mathbf{j}^2 = \\mathbf{k}^2 = \\mathbf{ijk} = -1</math>\n\ninto the stone of [[Broom Bridge|Brougham Bridge]] as he paused on it. Although the carving has since faded away, there has been an annual pilgrimage since 1989 called the [[Hamilton Walk]] for scientists and mathematicians who walk from [[Dunsink Observatory]] to the Royal Canal bridge in remembrance of Hamilton's discovery.\n\nOn the following day, Hamilton wrote a letter to his friend and fellow mathematician, John T. Graves, describing the train of thought that led to his discovery. This letter was later published in a letter to a science magazine;<ref name=letter1844>{{cite magazine |author=Hamilton, W.R. |title=Letter |magazine=London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |volume=xxv |year=1844 |pages=489–495}}</ref> Hamilton states:\n{{quote|And here there dawned on me the notion that we must admit, in some sense, a fourth dimension of space for the purpose of calculating with triples ... An electric circuit seemed to close, and a spark flashed forth.<ref name=letter1844/>}}\n\nHamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a ''quaternion'', and he devoted most of the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. [[Classical Hamiltonian quaternions|Hamilton's treatment]] is more [[Geometry|geometric]] than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' [[algebra]]ic properties. He founded a school of \"quaternionists\", and he tried to popularize quaternions in several books.

At this time, quaternions were a mandatory examination topic in Dublin. Topics in physics and geometry that would now be described using vectors, such as [[kinematics]] in space and [[Maxwell's equations]], were described entirely in terms of quaternions. There was even a professional research association, the [[Quaternion Society]], devoted to the study of quaternions and other [[hypercomplex number]] systems.\n\nFrom the mid-1880s, quaternions began to be displaced by [[vector analysis]], which had been developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], [[Oliver Heaviside]], and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. Vector analysis described the same phenomena as quaternions, so it borrowed some ideas and terminology liberally from the literature on quaternions. However, vector analysis was conceptually simpler and notationally cleaner, and eventually quaternions were relegated to a minor role in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. A side-effect of this transition is that [[classical Hamiltonian quaternions|Hamilton's work]] is difficult to comprehend for many modern readers. Hamilton's original definitions are unfamiliar and his writing style was wordy and difficult to understand.\n\nHowever, quaternions have had a revival since the late 20th&nbsp;century, primarily due to their utility in [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|describing spatial rotations]]. The representations of rotations by quaternions are more compact and quicker to compute than the representations by matrices.  In addition, unlike [[Euler angles]], they are not susceptible to “[[gimbal lock]]”. For this reason, quaternions are used in [[computer graphics]],<ref name=\"Shoemake\">{{cite journal| doi=10.1145/325165.325242 |author=Ken Shoemake |author-link=Ken Shoemake |year=1985 |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiranb/animation/p245-shoemake.pdf |title=Animating Rotation with Quaternion Curves |journal=Computer Graphics |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=245–254}} Presented at [[SIGGRAPH]] '85.</ref><ref>''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (1996) is often cited as the first mass-market computer game to have used quaternions to achieve smooth three-dimensional rotations.

He cited five authors, beginning with [[Ludwik Silberstein]], who used a [[potential]] function of one [[quaternion variable]] to express [[Maxwell's equations]] in a single [[differential equation]]. Concerning general relativity, he expressed the [[Runge–Lenz vector]]. He mentioned the Clifford biquaternions ([[split-biquaternion]]s) as an instance of [[Clifford algebra]].

Among the fifty references, Girard included [[Alexander Macfarlane (mathematician)|Alexander Macfarlane]] and his ''Bulletin'' of the [[Quaternion Society]].

In practice, if one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}} is 0, the corresponding term is omitted; if {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}} are all zero, the quaternion is the ''zero quaternion'', denoted 0; if one of {{mvar|b}}, {{mvar|c}}, {{mvar|d}}  equals 1, the corresponding term is written simply ''{{mvar|i}}'', ''{{mvar|j}}'', or ''{{mvar|k}}''.\n\nHamilton describes a quaternion <math>q = a + b\\ \\mathbf{i} +  c\\ \\mathbf{j} + d\\ \\mathbf{k}</math>, as consisting of a scalar part and a vector part.  The quaternion <math> b\\ \\mathbf{i} + c\\ \\mathbf{j} + d\\ \\mathbf{k}</math> is called the ''vector part'' (sometimes ''imaginary part'') of {{mvar|q}}, and {{mvar|a}} is the ''scalar part'' (sometimes ''real part'') of {{mvar|q}}. A quaternion that equals its real part (that is, its vector part is zero) is called a ''scalar'', and is identified with the corresponding real number. That is, the real numbers are a subset of the quaternions. A quaternion that equals its vector part is called a ''vector quaternion''.\n\nThe set of quaternions is made a 4&nbsp;dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[real number]]s, with <math>\\left\\{ 1, \\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j}, \\mathbf{k}\\right\\}</math> as a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], by the componentwise addition\n:<math>(a_1+b_1\\ \\mathbf{i} + c_1\\ \\mathbf{j} + d_1\\ \\mathbf{k}) + (a_2 + b_2\\ \\mathbf{i} + c_2\\ \\mathbf{j} + d_2\\ \\mathbf{k}) = (a_1 + a_2) + (b_1 + b_2)\\ \\mathbf{i} + (c_1 + c_2)\\ \\mathbf{j} + (d_1 + d_2)\\ \\mathbf{k}</math>\nand the componentwise scalar multiplication\n:<math>\\lambda(a + b\\ \\mathbf{i} + c\\ \\mathbf{j} + d\\ \\mathbf{k}) = \\lambda a + (\\lambda b)\\ \\mathbf{i} + (\\lambda c)\\ \\mathbf{j} + (\\lambda d)\\ \\mathbf{k}~.</math>\n\nA multiplicative group structure, called the ''Hamilton product'', denoted by juxtaposition, can be defined on the quaternions in the following way:\n*The real quaternion {{math|1}} is the [[identity element]].\n*The real quaternions commute with all other quaternions, that is {{math|1=''aq'' = ''qa''}} for every quaternion {{mvar|q}} and every real quaternion {{mvar|a}}. In algebraic terminology this is to say that the field of real quaternions are the [[center (ring theory)|center]] of this quaternion algebra.\n*The product is first given for the basis elements (see next subsection), and then extended to all quaternions by using the [[distributive property]] and the center property of the real quaternions. The Hamilton product is not [[commutative property|commutative]], but [[associative property|associative]], thus the quaternions form an [[associative algebra]] over the reals.\n*Additionally, every nonzero quaternion has an inverse with respect to the Hamilton product:\n:<math>(a + b\\ \\mathbf{i} + c\\ \\mathbf{j} + d \\mathbf{k})^{-1} = \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}\\,(a - b\\ \\mathbf{i} - c\\ \\mathbf{j} - d \\mathbf{k}).</math>\n\nThus the quaternions form a [[division algebra]].\n\n=== Multiplication of basis elements ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+[[Multiplication table]]\n|-\n!width=15|×\n!width=15|1\n!width=15|''i''\n!width=15|''j''\n!width=15|''k''\n|-\n!1\n|1\n|''i''\n|''j''\n|''k''\n|-\n!''i''\n|''i''\n| −1\n|style=\"background: #FF9999;\"|''k''\n|style=\"background: #9999FF;\"|−''j''\n|-\n!''j''\n|''j''\n|style=\"background: #FF9999;\"| −''k''\n| −1\n|style=\"background: #99FF99;\"|''i''\n|-\n!''k''\n|''k''\n|style=\"background: #9999FF;\"|''j''\n|style=\"background: #99FF99;\"|−''i''\n| −1\n|-\n|+Non commutativity is emphasized by colored squares \n|}\nThe basis elements {{math|''i''}}, {{math|''j''}}, and {{math|''k''}} commute with the real quaternion 1, that is\n:<math>i\\cdot 1 = 1\\cdot i =i, \\qquad j\\cdot 1 = 1\\cdot j = j, \\qquad k\\cdot 1 = 1\\cdot k=k.</math>\n\nThe other products of basis elements are defined by\n:<math>i^2=j^2=k^2=-1,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{2}\nij & = k, & \\qquad ji & = -k, \\\\\njk & = i, & kj & = -i, \\\\\nki & = j, & ik & = -j. \n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nThese multiplication formulas are equivalent to\n:<math>i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1~.</math>\nIn fact, the equality {{math|1= ''ijk'' = –1}} results from\n:<math>(ij)k = k^2 = -1.</math>\nThe converse implication results from manipulations similar to the following. By right-multiplying both sides of {{math|1=−1 = ''ijk''}} by {{math|–''k''}}, one gets\n:<math>k = (i j k)(-k) = (i j) (-k^2) = i j.</math>\nAll other products can be determined by similar methods.\n\n=== Center ===\n\nThe [[center (ring theory)|center]] of a [[noncommutative ring]] is the subring of elements {{mvar|c}} such that {{math|1=''cx'' = ''xc''}} for every {{mvar|x}}. The center of the quaternion algebra is the subfield of real quaternions. In fact, it is a part of the definition that the real quaternions belong to the center. Conversely, if {{mvar|1=''q'' = ''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} belongs to the center, then\n:<math>0 = iq-qi = 2cij + 2dik = 2ck-2dj,</math>\nand {{math|1= ''c'' = ''d'' = 0}}. A similar computation with {{mvar|j}} instead of {{mvar|i}} shows that one has also {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. Thus {{math|1=''q'' = ''a''}} is a real quaternion.\n\nThe quaternion form a [[division algebra]]. This means that the noncommutativity of multiplication is the only property that makes quaternions different from a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. This noncommutativity has some unexpected consequences, among them that a [[polynomial equation]] over the quaternions can have more distinct solutions than the degree of the polynomial. For example, the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>2</sup> + 1 = 0}}, has infinitely many quaternion solutions, which are the quaternions {{math|1=''z'' = ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} such that {{math|1=''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}. Thus these \"roots of –1\" form a [[unit sphere]] in the three-dimensional space of vector quaternions.\n\n=== Hamilton product ===\nFor two elements {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>1</sub>''k''}} and {{nowrap|''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>2</sub>''k''}}, their product, called the  '''Hamilton product''' ({{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub> + ''b''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>1</sub>''k''}}) ({{nowrap|''a''<sub>2</sub> + ''b''<sub>2</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>2</sub>''k''}}), is determined by the products of the basis elements and the [[distributive law]]. The distributive law makes it possible to expand the product so that it is a sum of products of basis elements. This gives the following expression:\n:<math>a_1a_2 + a_1b_2i + a_1c_2j + a_1d_2k</math>\n:<math>{}+ b_1a_2i + b_1b_2i^2 + b_1c_2ij + b_1d_2ik</math>\n:<math>{}+ c_1a_2j + c_1b_2ji + c_1c_2j^2 + c_1d_2jk</math>\n:<math>{}+ d_1a_2k + d_1b_2ki + d_1c_2kj + d_1d_2k^2.</math>\nNow the basis elements can be multiplied using the rules given above to get:<ref name=\"SeeHazewinkel\" />\n:<math>a_1a_2 - b_1b_2 - c_1c_2 - d_1d_2</math>\n:<math>{}+ (a_1b_2 + b_1a_2 + c_1d_2 - d_1c_2)i</math>\n:<math>{}+ (a_1c_2 - b_1d_2 + c_1a_2 + d_1b_2)j</math>\n:<math>{}+ (a_1d_2 + b_1c_2 - c_1b_2 + d_1a_2)k.</math>\n\nThe product of two [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Using quaternion as rotations|rotation quaternions]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Maths - Transformations using Quaternions|url=http://www.euclideanspace.com/maths/algebra/realNormedAlgebra/quaternions/transforms/index.htm|website=EuclideanSpace|quote=A rotation of q1 followed by a rotation of q2 is equivalent to a single rotation of q2*q1.

If {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} is any quaternion, then ''a'' is called its '''scalar part''' and ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk'' is called its '''vector part'''. Even though every quaternion can be viewed as a vector in a four-dimensional vector space, it is common to refer to the '''vector''' part as vectors in three-dimensional space.  With this convention, a vector is the same as an element of the vector space '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.<ref group=lower-alpha>It is important to note that the vector part of a quaternion is, in truth, an \"axial\" vector or \"[[pseudovector]]\", ''not'' an ordinary or \"polar\" vector, as was formally proven by S.L. Altmann in Ch. 12 of his 1986 book, ''Rotations, Quaternions and Double Groups''. A polar vector can be represented in calculations (for example, for rotation by a quaternion \"similarity transform\") by a pure imaginary quaternion, with no loss of information, but the two should not be confused. The axis of a \"binary\" (180°) rotation quaternion corresponds to the direction of the represented polar vector in such a case.</ref>\n\nHamilton also called vector quaternions '''right quaternions'''<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fIRAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=quaternion#PPA310,M1 |title=Elements of Quaternions |article=Article 285 |page=310 |author=Hamilton, Sir William Rowan |year=1866}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=math;cc=math;q1=right%20quaternion;rgn=full%20text;idno=05140001;didno=05140001;view=image;seq=81 |author=Hardy |title=Elements of Quaternions |page=65 |publisher=library.cornell.edu}}</ref> and real numbers (considered as quaternions with zero vector part) '''scalar quaternions'''.\n\nIf a quaternion is divided up into a scalar part and a vector part, i.e.\n:<math>q = (r,\\ \\vec{v}),\\ q\\in\\mathbf{H},\\ r\\in\\mathbf{R},\\ \\vec{v}\\in\\mathbf{R}^3</math>\n\nthen the formulas for addition and multiplication are:\n:<math> (r_1,\\ \\vec{v}_1) + (r_2,\\ \\vec{v}_2) = (r_1 + r_2,\\ \\vec{v}_1+\\vec{v}_2)</math>\n:<math>(r_1,\\ \\vec{v}_1) (r_2,\\ \\vec{v}_2) = (r_1 r_2 - \\vec{v}_1\\cdot\\vec{v}_2,\\ r_1\\vec{v}_2+r_2\\vec{v}_1 + \\vec{v}_1\\times\\vec{v}_2)</math>\n\nwhere \"'''·'''\" is the [[dot product]] and \"'''×'''\" is the [[cross product]].\n\n== Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocal ==\n<!-- Should perhaps add an {{anchor|section name}} here if the section name changes -->\n\nConjugation of quaternions is analogous to conjugation of complex numbers and to transposition (also known as reversal) of elements of [[Clifford algebra]]s. To define it, let <math>q = a + bi + c j + d k </math> be a quaternion. The '''[[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]]''' of ''q'' is the quaternion <math> q^* = a - bi - c j - d k </math>. It is denoted by ''q''<sup>∗</sup>, {{overline|''q''}},<ref name=\"SeeHazewinkel\" /> ''q<sup>t</sup>'', or <math>\\tilde q</math>. Conjugation is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]], meaning that it is its own inverse, so conjugating an element twice returns the original element. The conjugate of a product of two quaternions is the product of the conjugates ''in the reverse order''. That is, if ''p'' and ''q'' are quaternions, then {{nowrap|1=(''pq'')<sup>∗</sup> = ''q''<sup>∗</sup>''p''<sup>∗</sup>}}, not ''p''<sup>∗</sup>''q''<sup>∗</sup>.\n\n<!-- While the conjugation of a complex number is a special function, that requires, e.g., isolating the imaginary part, and cannot be performed by only applying addition, multiplication and the construction of the respective inverses, which make up the field of complex numbers (in fact, there is no holomorphic function doing the conjugation), This should be in the section on complex numbers--> \nThe conjugation of a quaternion, in stark contrast to the complex setting, can be expressed with multiplication and addition of quaternions:\n\n:<math>q^* = - \\frac 1 2 (q + iqi + jqj + kqk).</math>\n\nConjugation can be used to extract the scalar and vector parts of a quaternion. The scalar part of ''p'' is {{nowrap|(''p'' + ''p''<sup>∗</sup>) / 2}}, and the vector part of ''p'' is {{nowrap|(''p'' − ''p''<sup>∗</sup>) / 2}}.\n\nThe square root of the product of a quaternion with its conjugate is called its '''[[norm (mathematics)|norm]]''' and is denoted ||''q''|| (Hamilton called this quantity the [[Tensor of a quaternion|''tensor'' of ''q'']], but this conflicts with modern meaning of \"[[tensor]]\"). In formula, this is expressed as follows:\n:<math>\\lVert q \\rVert = \\sqrt{qq^*} = \\sqrt{q^*q} = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}</math>\nThis is always a non-negative real number, and it is the same as the Euclidean norm on '''H''' considered as the vector space '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. Multiplying a quaternion by a real number scales its norm by the absolute value of the number. That is, if α is real, then\n:<math>\\lVert\\alpha q\\rVert = \\lVert \\alpha\\lVert\\lVert q\\rVert.</math>\nThis is a special case of the fact that the norm is ''multiplicative'', meaning that\n:<math>\\lVert pq \\rVert = \\lVert p \\rVert\\lVert q \\rVert.</math>\nfor any two quaternions ''p'' and ''q''. Multiplicativity is a consequence of the formula for the conjugate of a product.\nAlternatively it follows from the identity\n:<math>  \\det \\Bigl(\\begin{array}{cc} a+ib & id+c \\\\ id-c & a-ib \\end{array}\\Bigr) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2,</math>\n\n(where ''i'' denotes the usual [[imaginary unit]]) and hence from the multiplicative property of [[determinant]]s of square matrices.\n\nThis norm makes it possible to define the '''distance''' {{nowrap|''d''(''p'', ''q'')}} between ''p'' and ''q'' as the norm of their difference:\n:<math>d(p, q) = \\lVert p - q \\rVert.</math>\nThis makes '''H''' a [[metric space]]. Addition and multiplication are continuous in the metric topology. Indeed, for any scalar, positive ''a'' it holds\n:<math>\\lVert (p+a p_1 + q+a q_1)-(p+q)\\rVert = a\\lVert p_1+q_1\\rVert.</math>\nContinuity follows from taking ''a'' to zero in the limit. Continuity for multiplication holds similarly.\n\n=== Unit quaternion ===\n{{Main|Versor}}\nA '''unit quaternion''' is a quaternion of norm one. Dividing a non-zero quaternion ''q'' by its norm produces a unit quaternion '''U'''''q'' called the '''[[versor]]''' of ''q'':\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}q = \\frac{q}{\\lVert q\\rVert}.</math>\n\nEvery quaternion has a [[polar decomposition]] <math> q = \\lVert q \\rVert \\cdot \\mathbf{U} q </math>.\n\nUsing conjugation and the norm makes it possible to define the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a non-zero quaternion. The product of a quaternion with its reciprocal should equal 1, and the considerations above imply that the product of <math>q</math> and <math>q^\\ast / \\left \\Vert q \\right \\| ^2</math> (in either order) is 1. So the '''reciprocal''' of ''q'' is defined to be\n\n:<math>q^{-1} = \\frac{q^*}{\\lVert q\\rVert^2}.</math>\n\nThis makes it possible to divide two quaternions ''p'' and ''q'' in two different ways (when q is non-zero). That is, their quotient can be either ''p q''<sup>−1</sup> or ''q''<sup>−1</sup>''p''. The notation {{sfrac|p|q}} is ambiguous because it does not specify whether ''q'' divides on the left or the right.\n\n== Algebraic properties ==\n[[File:Cayley graph Q8.svg|right|thumb|[[Cayley graph]] of Q<sub>8</sub>.  The red arrows represent multiplication on the right by ''i'', and the green arrows represent multiplication on the right by ''j''.]]\n\nThe set '''H''' of all quaternions is a [[vector space]] over the [[real number]]s with [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] 4. (In comparison, the real numbers have dimension 1, the complex numbers have dimension 2, and the [[octonion]]s have dimension 8.) Multiplication of quaternions is associative and distributes over vector addition, but it is not commutative. Therefore, the quaternions '''H''' are a non-commutative [[associative algebra]] over the real numbers. Even though '''H''' contains copies of the complex numbers, it is not an associative algebra over the complex numbers.\n\nBecause it is possible to divide quaternions, they form a [[division algebra]]. This is a structure similar to a [[field (mathematics)|field]] except for the non-commutativity of multiplication. Finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers are very rare. The [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|Frobenius theorem]] states that there are exactly three: '''R''', '''C''', and '''H'''. The norm makes the quaternions into a [[composition algebra|normed algebra]], and normed division algebras over the reals are also very rare: [[Hurwitz's theorem (composition algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] says that there are only four: '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O''' (the [[octonions]]). The quaternions are also an example of a [[composition algebra]] and of a unital [[Banach algebra]].\n\n[[File:Quaternion-multiplication-cayley-3d-with-legend.png|thumb|Three dimensional graph of Q<sub>8</sub>.  Red, green and blue arrows represent multiplication by i, j and k respectively.  Multiplication by negative numbers are omitted for clarity.]]\n\nBecause the product of any two basis vectors is plus or minus another basis vector, the set {{nowrap|{±1, ±''i'', ±''j'', ±''k''} }} forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under multiplication. This non-[[Abelian Group]] is called the [[quaternion group]] and is denoted Q<sub>8</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=quaternion+group |title=quaternion group|work=Wolframalpha.com}}</ref> The real [[group ring]] of Q<sub>8</sub> is a ring '''R'''[Q<sub>8</sub>] which is also an eight-dimensional vector space over '''R'''. It has one basis vector for each element of Q<sub>8</sub>.  The quaternions are the [[quotient ring]] of '''R'''[Q<sub>8</sub>] by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the elements {{nowrap|1 + (−1)}}, {{nowrap|''i'' + (−''i'')}}, {{nowrap|''j'' + (−''j'')}}, and {{nowrap|''k'' + (−''k'')}}. Here the first term in each of the differences is one of the basis elements 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'', and the second term is one of basis elements −1, −''i'', −''j'', and −''k'', not the additive inverses of 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k''.\n\n== Quaternions and the geometry of R<sup>3</sup> ==\nThe vector part of a quaternion can be interpreted as a coordinate vector in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>; therefore, the algebraic operations of the quaternions reflect the geometry of '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  Operations such as the vector dot and cross products can be defined in terms of quaternions, and this makes it possible to apply quaternion techniques wherever spatial vectors arise. A useful application of quaternions has been to interpolate the orientations of key-frames in computer graphics.<ref name=\"Shoemake\"/>\n\nFor the remainder of this section, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' will denote both the three imaginary<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RC8PAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=right+tensor+dyadic#PPA428,M1|title= Vector Analysis |publisher=Gibbs-Wilson |year=1901 |page= 428}}</ref> basis vectors of '''H''' and a basis for '''R'''<sup>3</sup>. Notice that replacing ''i'' by −''i'', ''j'' by −''j'', and ''k'' by −''k'' sends a vector to its additive inverse, so the additive inverse of a vector is the same as its conjugate as a quaternion. For this reason, conjugation is sometimes called the ''spatial inverse''.\n\nFor two vector quaternions {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''b''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>1</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>1</sub>''k''}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''b''<sub>2</sub>''i'' + ''c''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''d''<sub>2</sub>''k''}} their [[dot product]], by analogy to vectors in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>, is\n:<math>p \\cdot q = b_1b_2 + c_1c_2 + d_1d_2.</math>\nIt can also be expressed in a component-free manner as\n:<math>p \\cdot q = \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(p^*q + q^*p) = \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(pq^* + qp^*).</math> \nThis is equal to the scalar parts of the products ''pq''<sup>∗</sup>, ''qp''<sup>∗</sup>, ''p''<sup>∗</sup>''q'', and ''q''<sup>∗</sup>''p''. Note that their vector parts are different.\n\nThe [[cross product]] of ''p'' and ''q'' relative to the orientation determined by the ordered basis ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' is\n:<math>p \\times q = (c_1d_2 - d_1c_2)i + (d_1b_2 - b_1d_2)j + (b_1c_2 - c_1b_2)k.</math>\n(Recall that the orientation is necessary to determine the sign.) This is equal to the vector part of the product ''pq'' (as quaternions), as well as the vector part of −''q''<sup>∗</sup>''p''<sup>∗</sup>. It also has the formula\n:<math>p \\times q = \\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(pq - q^*p^*).</math>\nFor the commutator, [''p'', ''q''] = ''pq'' − ''qp'', of two vector quaternions one obtains\n:<math>[p,q]= 2p \\times q.</math>\n\nIn general, let ''p'' and ''q'' be quaternions and write\n:<math>p = p_s + p_v,</math>\n:<math>q = q_s + q_v,</math>\nwhere ''p<sub>s</sub>'' and ''q<sub>s</sub>'' are the scalar parts, and <math>p_v</math> and <math>q_v</math> are the vector parts of ''p'' and ''q''. Then we have the formula\n:<math>pq = (pq)_s + (pq)_v = (p_sq_s - p_v\\cdot q_v) + (p_s q_v + q_s p_v  + p_v \\times q_v).</math>\nThis shows that the noncommutativity of quaternion multiplication comes from the multiplication of vector quaternions. It also shows that two quaternions commute if and only if their vector parts are collinear.

Wilkins collection at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]</ref> showed that this product computes the third vertex of a spherical triangle from two given vertices and their associated arc-lengths, which is also an algebra of points in [[Elliptic geometry]].\n\nUnit quaternions can be identified with rotations in '''R'''<sup>3</sup> and were called [[versor]]s by Hamilton.<ref name=\"Hamilton\"/>  Also see [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]] for more information about modeling three-dimensional rotations using quaternions.\n\nSee [[Andrew J. Hanson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~hanson/quatvis/|title= Visualizing Quaternions |publisher=Morgan-Kaufmann/Elsevier |year=2005}}</ref> for visualization of quaternions.\n\n== Matrix representations ==\nJust as complex numbers can be [[Complex number#Matrix representation of complex numbers|represented as matrices]], so can quaternions. There are at least two ways of representing quaternions as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] in such a way that quaternion addition and multiplication correspond to matrix addition and [[matrix multiplication]]. One is to use 2&thinsp;×&thinsp;2 [[complex number|complex]] matrices, and the other is to use 4&thinsp;×&thinsp;4 [[real number|real]] matrices. In each case, the representation given is one of a family of linearly related representations. In the terminology of [[abstract algebra]], these are [[injective function|injective]] [[homomorphism]]s from '''H''' to the [[matrix ring]]s {{nowrap|M(2, '''C''')}} and {{nowrap|M(4, '''R''')}}, respectively.\n\nUsing 2&thinsp;×&thinsp;2 complex matrices, the quaternion {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} can be represented as\n\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix}a+bi & c+di \\\\ -c+di & a-bi \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThis representation has the following properties:\n* Constraining any two of ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' to zero produces a representation of [[complex number]]s.  For example, setting {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''d'' = 0}} produces a diagonal complex matrix representation of complex numbers, and setting {{nowrap|1=''b'' = ''d'' = 0}} produces a real matrix representation.\n* The norm of a quaternion (the square root of the product with its conjugate, as with complex numbers) is the square root of the [[determinant]] of the corresponding matrix.<ref>[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=det+{{a%2Bb*i%2C+c%2Bd*i}%2C+{-c%2Bd*i%2C+a-b*i}} Wolframalpha.com]</ref>\n* The conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the [[conjugate transpose]] of the matrix.\n* By restriction this representation yields an [[group isomorphism|isomorphism]] between the subgroup of unit quaternions and their image [[SU(2)]].  Topologically, the [[unit quaternion]]s are the [[3-sphere]], so the underlying space of SU(2) is also a 3-sphere. The group SU(2) is important for describing [[spin (physics)|spin]] in [[quantum mechanics]]; see [[Pauli matrices]].\n* There is a strong relation between quaternion units and Pauli matrices. Obtain the eight quaternion unit matrices by taking ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'', set three of them at zero and the fourth at 1 or &minus;1. Multiplying any two Pauli matrices always yields a quaternion unit matrix, all of them except for &minus;1. One obtains &minus;1 via ''i''<sup>2</sup> = ''j''<sup>2</sup> = ''k''<sup>2</sup> = ''ijk'' = &minus;1. E.g. the last equality is\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nijk = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 = -1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nUsing 4&thinsp;×&thinsp;4 real matrices, that same quaternion can be written as\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n a & -b & -c & -d \\\\ \n b & a & -d & c \\\\\n c & d & a & -b \\\\\n d & -c & b & a \n\\end{bmatrix}= a\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ b\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ c\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ d\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ \n 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\nHowever, the representation of quaternions in M(4,ℝ) is not unique.  For example, the same quaternion can also be represented as\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n a & d & -b & -c \\\\ \n -d & a & c & -b \\\\\n b & -c & a & -d \\\\\n c & b & d & a \n\\end{bmatrix}= a\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ b\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ c\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\ \n 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}\n+ d\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\\\\n 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\nIn fact, there exist 48 distinct representations of this form.  More precisely, there are 48 sets of quadruples of matrices such that a function sending 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' to the matrices in the quadruple is a homomorphism, that is, it sends sums and products of quaternions to sums and products of matrices.<ref name=MatRep>{{cite journal|last1=Farebrother|first1=Richard William|last2=Groß|first2=Jürgen|last3=Troschke|first3=Sven-Oliver|title=Matrix representation of quaternions|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|date=2003|volume=362|pages=251–255|doi=10.1016/s0024-3795(02)00535-9}}</ref> \nIn this representation, the conjugate of a quaternion corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix. The fourth power of the norm of a quaternion is the [[determinant]] of the corresponding matrix. As with the 2&thinsp;×&thinsp;2 complex representation above, complex numbers can again be produced by constraining the coefficients suitably; for example, as block diagonal matrices with two 2&thinsp;×&thinsp;2 blocks by setting {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''d'' = 0}}.\n\nEach 4x4 matrix representation of quaternions corresponds to a multiplication table of unit quaternions. For example, the last matrix representation given above corresponds to the multiplication table\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=15|×\n!width=15|''a''\n!width=15|''d''\n!width=15|&minus;''b''\n!width=15|&minus;''c''\n|-\n!''a''\n|''a''\n|''d''\n|''&minus;b''\n|''&minus;c''\n|-\n!''&minus;d''\n|''&minus;d''\n|''a''\n|''c''\n|''&minus;b''\n|-\n!''b''\n|''b''\n| &minus;''c''\n|''a''\n|&minus;''d''\n|-\n!''c''\n|''c''\n|''b''\n|''d''\n|''a''\n|-\n|}\n\nwhich is isomorphic — through <math>\\{a \\mapsto 1, b \\mapsto i, c \\mapsto j, d \\mapsto k\\}</math> — to\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=15|×\n!width=15|''1''\n!width=15|''k''\n!width=15|&minus;''i''\n!width=15|&minus;''j''\n|-\n!''1''\n|''1''\n|''k''\n|''&minus;i''\n|''&minus;j''\n|-\n!''&minus;k''\n|''&minus;k''\n|''1''\n|''j''\n|''&minus;i''\n|-\n!''i''\n|''i''\n| &minus;''j''\n|''1''\n|&minus;''k''\n|-\n!''j''\n|''j''\n|''i''\n|''k''\n|''1''\n|-\n|}\n\nConstraining any such multiplication table to have the identity in the first row and column and for the signs of the row headers to be opposite to those of the column headers, then there are 3 possible choices for the second column (ignoring sign), 2 possible choices for the third column (ignoring sign), and 1 possible choice for the fourth column (ignoring sign); that makes 6 possibilities. Then, the second column can be chosen to be either positive or negative, the third column can be chosen to be positive or negative, and the fourth column can be chosen to be positive or negative, giving 8 possibilities for the sign. Multiplying the possibilities for the letter positions and for their signs yields 48. Then replacing 1 with ''a'', ''i'' with ''b'', ''j'' with ''c'', and ''k'' with ''d'' and removing the row and column headers yields a matrix representation of ''a + bi + cj + dk''.\n\n== Lagrange’s four square theorem ==\n{{main|Lagrange's four-square theorem}}\nQuaternions are also used in one of the proofs of Lagrange's four-square theorem in [[number theory]], which states that every nonnegative integer is the sum of four integer squares. As well as being an elegant theorem in its own right, Lagrange's four square theorem has useful applications in areas of mathematics outside number theory, such as [[combinatorial design]] theory. The quaternion-based proof uses [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s, a subring of the ring of all quaternions for which there is an analog of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n\n== Quaternions as pairs of complex numbers ==\n{{Main|Cayley–Dickson construction}}\nQuaternions can be represented as pairs of complex numbers. From this perspective, quaternions are the result of applying the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] to the complex numbers. This is a generalization of the construction of the complex numbers as pairs of real numbers.\n\nLet '''C'''<sup>2</sup> be a two-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Choose a basis consisting of two elements 1 and ''j''.  A vector in '''C'''<sup>2</sup> can be written in terms of the basis elements 1 and ''j'' as\n:<math>(a + bi)1 + (c + di)j.\\ </math>\nIf we define {{nowrap|1=''j''<sup>2</sup> = −1}} and {{nowrap|1=''ij'' = −''ji''}}, then we can multiply two vectors using the distributive law. Writing ''k'' in place of the product ''ij'' leads to the same rules for multiplication as the usual quaternions. Therefore, the above vector of complex numbers corresponds to the quaternion {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}}. If we write the elements of '''C'''<sup>2</sup> as ordered pairs and quaternions as quadruples, then the correspondence is\n\n:<math>(a + bi,\\ c + di) \\leftrightarrow (a, b, c, d).</math>\n\n== Square roots of &minus;1 ==\nIn the complex numbers, '''C''', there are just two numbers, ''i'' and −''i'', whose square is &minus;1&nbsp;. In '''H''' there are infinitely many square roots of minus one: the quaternion solution for the square root of &minus;1 is the unit [[sphere]] in '''R'''<sup>3</sup>.  To see this, let {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} be a quaternion, and assume that its square is −1.  In terms of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'', this means\n:<math>a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - d^2 = -1,</math>\n:<math>2ab = 0,</math>\n:<math>2ac = 0,</math>\n:<math>2ad = 0.</math>\nTo satisfy the last three equations, either {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} 0}} or ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are all 0.  The latter is impossible because ''a'' is a real number and the first equation would imply that {{nowrap| ''a''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} &minus;1}}.  Therefore, {{nowrap| ''a'' {{=}} 0}} and {{nowrap| ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}. In other words: a quaternion squares to &minus;1 if and only if it is a vector quaternion with norm 1. By definition, the set of all such vectors forms the unit sphere.\n\nOnly negative real quaternions have infinitely many square roots. All others have just two (or one in the case of 0).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nThe identification of the square roots of minus one in '''H''' was given by Hamilton<ref>{{cite book|author=Hamilton |year=1899|title=Elements of Quaternions |edition= 2nd |page= 244|isbn=1-108-00171-8}}</ref> but was frequently omitted in other texts. By 1971 the sphere was included by Sam Perlis in his three-page exposition included in ''Historical Topics in Algebra'' (page&nbsp;39) published by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]].

The images of the embeddings corresponding to ''q'' and &minus;''q'' are identical.\n\nEvery non-real quaternion determines a planar subspace in '''H''' that is isomorphic to '''C''':  Write ''q'' as the sum of its scalar part and its vector part:\n:<math>q = q_s + \\vec{q}_v.</math>\nDecompose the vector part further as the product of its norm and its [[versor]]:\n:<math>q = q_s + \\lVert\\vec{q}_v\\rVert\\cdot\\mathbf{U}\\vec{q}_v.</math>\n(Note that this is not the same as <math>q_s + \\lVert q\\rVert\\cdot\\mathbf{U}q</math>.) The versor of the vector part of ''q'', <math>\\mathbf{U}\\vec{q}_v</math>, is a right versor with –1 as its square.  Therefore, it determines a copy of the complex numbers by the function\n:<math>a + b\\sqrt{-1} \\mapsto a + b\\mathbf{U}\\vec{q}_v.</math>\nUnder this function, {{math|''q''}} is the image of the complex number <math>q_s + \\lVert\\vec{q}_v\\rVert i</math>. Thus '''H''' is the [[union (set theory)#Arbitrary unions|union]] of complex planes intersecting in a common [[real line]], where the union is taken over the sphere of square roots of minus one, bearing in mind that the same plane is associated with any pair of [[antipodal points]] on the sphere of right versors.\n\n=== Commutative subrings ===\nThe relationship of quaternions to each other within the complex subplanes of '''H''' can also be identified and expressed in terms of [[commutative]] [[subring]]s. Specifically, since two quaternions ''p'' and ''q'' commute (i.e., {{nowrap|''pq'' {{=}} ''qp''}}) only if they lie in the same complex subplane of '''H''', the profile of '''H''' as a union of complex planes arises when one seeks to find all commutative subrings of the quaternion [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. This method of commutative subrings is also used to profile the [[split-quaternion]]s, which as an algebra over the reals are isomorphic to [[2 × 2 real matrices]].\n\n==Functions of a quaternion variable==\n{{Main|Quaternionic analysis}}\n[[File:Quaternion Julia x=-0,75 y=-0,14.jpg|thumb|The Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets can be extended to the Quaternions, but they must use cross sections to be rendered visually in 3 dimensions.

For example, the original electric and magnetic fields described by Maxwell were functions of a quaternion variable. Examples of other functions include the extension of the [[Mandelbrot set]] and [[Julia set]]s into 4 dimensional space.<ref>http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2010/bridges2010-247.pdf retrieved August 19, 2018</ref>\n\n===Exponential, logarithm, and power functions===\nGiven a quaternion,\n:<math> q= a+ bi + cj + dk = a + \\mathbf{v} </math>\nthe exponential is computed as\n:<math>\\exp(q) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{q^n}{n!}=e^{a} \\left(\\cos \\|\\mathbf{v}\\| + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} \\sin \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|\\right) </math>\n\n:<math>\\ln(q) = \\ln \\|q\\| + \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|} \\arccos \\frac{a}{\\|q\\|}</math>.<ref>[http://www.lce.hut.fi/~ssarkka/pub/quat.pdf Lce.hut.fi]</ref>\n\nIt follows that the polar decomposition of a quaternion may be written\n:<math>q=\\|q\\|e^{\\hat{n}\\theta} = \\|q\\| \\left(\\cos(\\theta) + \\hat{n} \\sin(\\theta)\\right),</math>\n\nwhere the angle <math>\\theta</math> and the unit vector <math>\\hat{n}</math> are defined by:\n:<math>a=\\|q\\|\\cos(\\theta)</math>\nand\n:<math>\\mathbf{v}=\\hat{n} \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|=\\hat{n}\\|q\\|\\sin(\\theta).</math>\nAny unit quaternion may be expressed in polar form as <math>e^{\\hat{n}\\theta}</math>.\n\nThe [[Power (mathematics)|power]] of a quaternion raised to an arbitrary (real) exponent <math>\\alpha</math> is given by:\n:<math>q^\\alpha=\\|q\\|^\\alpha e^{\\hat{n}\\alpha\\theta} = \\|q\\|^\\alpha \\left(\\cos(\\alpha\\theta) + \\hat{n} \\sin(\\alpha\\theta)\\right).</math>\n\n===Geodesic norm===\nThe [[Great-circle distance|geodesic distance]] {{nowrap|''d<sub>g</sub>'' (''p'', ''q'')}} between unit quaternions ''p'' and ''q'' is defined as:\n:<math>d_g(p, q) = \\lVert \\ln(p^{-1} q) \\rVert.</math><ref name=Geodesic >{{cite journal|last1=Park |first1=F.

All [[conjugacy class|elements that are conjugate to a given element]] (in this sense of the word conjugate) have the same real part and the same norm of the vector part. (Thus the conjugate in the other sense is one of the conjugates in this sense.)\n\nThus the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions acts by conjugation on the copy of '''R'''<sup>3</sup> consisting of quaternions with real part equal to zero. Conjugation by a unit quaternion (a quaternion of absolute value 1) with real part cos(θ) is a rotation by an angle 2θ, the axis of the rotation being the direction of the vector part. The advantages of quaternions are:\n\n* Avoiding [[gimbal lock]], a problem with systems such as [[Euler angles]].\n* Faster and more compact than [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]].\n* Nonsingular representation (compared with Euler angles for example).\n* Pairs of unit quaternions represent a rotation in [[Four-dimensional space|4D]] space (see ''[[Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space#Algebra of 4D rotations|Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space: Algebra of 4D rotations]]'').\n\nThe set of all unit quaternions ([[versor]]s) forms a [[3-sphere]] ''S''<sup>3</sup> and a [[group (mathematics)|group]] (a [[Lie group]]) under multiplication, [[Covering space#Elementary properties|double covering]] the group {{nowrap|SO(3, '''R''')}} of real orthogonal 3×3 [[orthogonal matrix|matrices]] of [[determinant]] 1 since ''two'' unit quaternions correspond to every rotation under the above correspondence. See the [[plate trick]].\n{{details|Point groups in three dimensions}}\nThe image of a subgroup of versors <!-- ''S''³ itself has not a canonical group structure --> is a [[Point groups in three dimensions|point group]], and conversely, the preimage of a point group is a subgroup of versors. The preimage of a finite point group is called by the same name, with the prefix '''binary'''. For instance, the preimage of the [[icosahedral group]] is the [[binary icosahedral group]].\n\nThe versors' group is isomorphic to SU(2), the group of complex [[unitary matrix|unitary]] 2×2 matrices of [[determinant]] 1.\n\nLet ''A'' be the set of quaternions of the form {{nowrap|''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}} where ''a'', ''b'', ''c'', and ''d'' are either all [[integer]]s or all [[rational number]]s with odd numerator and denominator 2. The set ''A'' is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] (in fact a [[domain (ring theory)|domain]]) and a [[Lattice (group)|lattice]] and is called the ring of [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s. There are 24 unit quaternions in this ring, and they are the vertices of a [[24-cell|regular 24-cell]] with [[Schläfli symbol]] {3,4,3}. They correspond to the double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the regular [[tetrahedron]]. Similarly, the vertices of a [[600-cell|regular 600-cell]] with Schläfli symbol {3,3,5} can be taken as the unit [[icosian]]s, corresponding to the double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the [[regular icosahedron]]. The double cover of the rotational symmetry group of the regular [[octahedron]] corresponds to the quaternions that represent the vertices of the [[disphenoidal 288-cell]].\n\n== Quaternion algebras ==\n{{Main|Quaternion algebra}}\n\nThe Quaternions can be generalized into further algebras called ''quaternion algebras''. Take ''F'' to be any [[field (mathematics)|field]] with characteristic different from 2, and ''a'' and ''b'' to be elements of ''F''; a four-dimensional unitary [[associative algebra]] can be defined over ''F'' with basis 1, ''i'', ''j'', and ''ij'', where {{nowrap|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''}}, {{nowrap|1=''j''<sup>2</sup> = ''b''}} and {{nowrap|1=''ij'' = −''ji''}} (so {{nowrap|1=''(ij)''<sup>2</sup> = −''ab''}}).\n\nQuaternion algebras are isomorphic to the algebra of 2×2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over ''F'' or form [[division algebra]]s over ''F'', depending on \nthe choice of ''a'' and ''b''.\n\n== Quaternions as the even part of Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>(R) ==\nThe usefulness of quaternions for geometrical computations can be generalised to other dimensions by identifying the quaternions as the even part Cℓ<sup>+</sup><sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') of the [[Clifford algebra]] Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''').  This is an associative multivector algebra built up from fundamental basis elements σ<sub>1</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>3</sub> using the product rules\n:<math>\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2 = \\sigma_3^2 = 1,</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_i \\sigma_j = - \\sigma_j \\sigma_i \\qquad (j \\neq i).</math>\nIf these fundamental basis elements are taken to represent vectors in 3D space, then it turns out that the ''reflection'' of a vector ''r'' in a plane perpendicular to a unit vector ''w'' can be written:\n:<math>r^{\\prime} = - w\\, r\\, w.</math>\nTwo reflections make a rotation by an angle twice the angle between the two reflection planes, so\n:<math>r^{\\prime\\prime} = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1 \\, r \\, \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 </math>\ncorresponds to a rotation of 180° in the plane containing σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub>.  This is very similar to the corresponding quaternion formula,\n:<math>r^{\\prime\\prime} = -\\mathbf{k}\\, r\\, \\mathbf{k}. </math>\n\nIn fact, the two are identical, if we make the identification\n:<math>\\mathbf{k} = \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1, \\mathbf{i} = \\sigma_3 \\sigma_2, \\mathbf{j} = \\sigma_1 \\sigma_3</math>\nand it is straightforward to confirm that this preserves the Hamilton relations\n:<math>\\mathbf{i}^2 = \\mathbf{j}^2 = \\mathbf{k}^2 = \\mathbf{i} \\mathbf{j} \\mathbf{k} = -1.</math>\n\nIn this picture, quaternions correspond not to vectors but to [[bivector]]s – quantities with magnitude and orientations associated with particular 2D ''planes'' rather than 1D ''directions''.   The relation to [[complex number]]s becomes clearer, too: in 2D, with two vector directions σ<sub>1</sub> and σ<sub>2</sub>, there is only one bivector basis element σ<sub>1</sub>σ<sub>2</sub>, so only one imaginary.  But in 3D, with three vector directions, there are three bivector basis elements σ<sub>1</sub>σ<sub>2</sub>, σ<sub>2</sub>σ<sub>3</sub>, σ<sub>3</sub>σ<sub>1</sub>, so three imaginaries.\n\nThis reasoning extends further.  In the Clifford algebra Cℓ<sub>4,0</sub>('''R'''), there are six bivector basis elements, since with four different basic vector directions, six different pairs and therefore six different linearly independent planes can be defined. Rotations in such spaces using these generalisations of quaternions, called [[rotor (mathematics)|rotors]], can be very useful for applications involving [[homogeneous coordinates]].  But it is only in 3D that the number of basis bivectors equals the number of basis vectors, and each bivector can be identified as a [[pseudovector]].\n\nThere are several advantages for placing quaternions in this wider setting:<ref>[http://www.geometricalgebra.net/quaternions.html Quaternions and Geometric Algebra]. Accessed 2008-09-12.  See also: Leo Dorst, Daniel Fontijne, Stephen Mann, (2007), ''[http://www.geometricalgebra.net/index.html Geometric Algebra For Computer Science]'', [[Morgan Kaufmann]].  {{isbn|0-12-369465-5}}</ref>\n* Rotors are a natural part of geometric algebra and easily understood as the encoding of a double reflection.\n* In geometric algebra, a rotor and the objects it acts on live in the same space. This eliminates the need to change representations and to encode new data structures and methods, which is traditionally required when augmenting linear algebra with quaternions.\n* Rotors are universally applicable to any element of the algebra, not just vectors and other quaternions, but also lines, planes, circles, spheres, rays, and so on.\n* In the [[conformal geometry|conformal]] model of Euclidean geometry, rotors allow the encoding of rotation, translation and scaling in a single element of the algebra, universally acting on any element. In particular, this means that rotors can represent rotations around an arbitrary axis, whereas quaternions are limited to an axis through the origin.\n* Rotor-encoded transformations make interpolation particularly straightforward.\n\nFor further detail about the geometrical uses of Clifford algebras, see [[Geometric algebra]].\n\n== Brauer group ==\n{{further|Brauer group}}\n\nThe quaternions are \"essentially\" the only (non-trivial) [[central simple algebra]] (CSA) over the real numbers, in the sense that every CSA over the reals is [[Brauer equivalent]] to either the reals or the quaternions. Explicitly, the [[Brauer group]] of the reals consists of two classes, represented by the reals and the quaternions, where the Brauer group is the set of all CSAs, up to equivalence relation of one CSA being a [[matrix ring]] over another. By the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] (specifically, Wedderburn's part), CSAs are all matrix algebras over a division algebra, and thus the quaternions are the only non-trivial division algebra over the reals.\n\nCSAs – rings over a field, which are [[simple algebra]]s (have no non-trivial 2-sided ideals, just as with fields) whose center is exactly the field – are a noncommutative analog of [[extension field]]s, and are more restrictive than general ring extensions. The fact that the quaternions are the only non-trivial CSA over the reals (up to equivalence) may be compared with the fact that the complex numbers are the only non-trivial field extension of the reals.\n\n== Quotations ==\n* \"I regard it as an inelegance, or imperfection, in quaternions, or rather in the state to which it has been hitherto unfolded, whenever it becomes or seems to become necessary to have recourse to x, y, z, etc.\" &mdash; William Rowan Hamilton [Quoted in a letter from Tait to Cayley].\n* \"Time is said to have only one dimension, and space to have three dimensions. […] The mathematical quaternion partakes of both these elements; in technical language it may be said to be \"time plus space\", or \"space plus time\": and in this sense it has, or at least involves a reference to, four dimensions. ''And how the One of Time, of Space the Three, Might in the Chain of Symbols girdled be''.\" &mdash; William Rowan Hamilton [Quoted in R.P. Graves, ''Life of Sir William Rowan Hamilton''].\n* \"Quaternions came from Hamilton after his really good work had been done; and, though beautifully ingenious, have been an unmixed evil to those who have touched them in any way, including [[James Clerk Maxwell|Clerk Maxwell]].\" &mdash; [[Lord Kelvin|W. Thompson, Lord Kelvin]]. (1892).\n* \"I came later to see that, as far as the vector analysis I required was concerned, the quaternion was not only not required, but was a positive evil of no inconsiderable magnitude; and that by its avoidance the establishment of vector analysis was made quite simple and its working also simplified, and that it could be conveniently harmonised with ordinary Cartesian work.\" &mdash; [[Oliver Heaviside]]. (1893). ''Electromagnetic Theory'' volume&nbsp;I, pp.&nbsp;134&ndash;135. London: The Electrician Printing and Publishing Company.\n* \"Neither matrices nor quaternions and ordinary vectors were banished from these ten [additional] chapters. For, in spite of the uncontested power of the modern Tensor Calculus, those older mathematical languages continue, in my opinion, to offer conspicuous advantages in the restricted field of special relativity. Moreover, in science as well as in every-day life, the mastery of more than one language is also precious, as it broadens our views, is conducive to criticism with regard to, and guards against hypostasy [weak-foundation] of, the matter expressed by words or mathematical symbols.\" &mdash; [[Ludwik Silberstein]].

It may be embedded in 4-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] as the set of points equidistant from a fixed central point.  Analogously to how the boundary of a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]] in three dimensions is an ordinary sphere (or 2-sphere, a two-dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]]), the boundary of a ball in four dimensions is a 3-sphere (an object with three [[dimension]]s).  A 3-sphere is an example of a [[3-manifold]] and an [[n-sphere]].\n\n==Definition==\nIn [[coordinates]], a 3-sphere with center {{math|(''C''<sub>0</sub>, ''C''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>2</sub>, ''C''<sub>3</sub>)}} and radius {{mvar|r}} is the set of all points {{math|(''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>)}} in real, [[Four-dimensional space|4-dimensional space]] ({{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}}) such that\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^3(x_i - C_i)^2 = ( x_0 - C_0 )^2 + ( x_1 - C_1 )^2 + ( x_2 - C_2 )^2+ ( x_3 - C_3 )^2 = r^2.</math>\nThe 3-sphere centered at the origin with radius 1 is called the '''unit 3-sphere''' and is usually denoted {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}:\n\n:<math>S^3 = \\left\\{(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)\\in\\mathbb{R}^4 : x_0^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 = 1\\right\\}.</math>\n\nIt is often convenient to regard {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}} as the space with 2 [[complex numbers|complex dimensions]] ({{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>}}) or the [[quaternion]]s ({{math|'''H'''}}). The unit 3-sphere is then given by\n\n:<math>S^3 = \\left\\{(z_1,z_2)\\in\\mathbb{C}^2 : |z_1|^2 + |z_2|^2 = 1\\right\\}</math>\nor\n:<math>S^3 = \\left\\{q\\in\\mathbb{H} : \\|q\\| = 1\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThis description as the [[quaternion]]s of [[quaternion#Conjugation, the norm, and reciprocation|norm]] one identifies the 3-sphere with the [[versor]]s in the quaternion [[division ring]]. Just as the [[unit circle]] is important for planar [[polar coordinates#Complex numbers|polar coordinates]], so the 3-sphere is important in the polar view of 4-space involved in quaternion multiplication. See [[polar decomposition#Quaternion polar decomposition|polar decomposition of a quaternion]] for details of this development of the three-sphere.\nThis view of the 3-sphere is the basis for the study of [[elliptic geometry#Elliptic space|elliptic space]] as developed by [[Georges Lemaître]].<ref>Georges Lemaître (1948) \"Quaternions et espace elliptique\", ''Acta'' [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] 12:57&ndash;78</ref>\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Elementary properties===\nThe 3-dimensional cubic hyperarea of a 3-sphere of radius {{mvar|r}} is\n:<math>2\\pi^2 r^3 \\,</math>\nwhile the 4-dimensional quartic hypervolume (the volume of the 4-dimensional region bounded by the 3-sphere) is\n:<math>\\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\end{matrix} \\pi^2 r^4.</math>\n\nEvery non-empty intersection of a 3-sphere with a three-dimensional [[hyperplane]] is a 2-sphere (unless the hyperplane is tangent to the 3-sphere, in which case the intersection is a single point). As a 3-sphere moves through a given three-dimensional hyperplane, the intersection starts out as a point, then becomes a growing 2-sphere that reaches its maximal size when the hyperplane cuts right through the \"equator\" of the 3-sphere. Then the 2-sphere shrinks again down to a single point as the 3-sphere leaves the hyperplane.\n\n===Topological properties===\nA 3-sphere is a [[Compact space|compact]], [[connected space|connected]], 3-dimensional [[manifold]] without boundary. It is also [[simply connected]]. What this means, in the broad sense, is that any loop, or circular path, on the 3-sphere can be continuously shrunk to a point without leaving the 3-sphere. The [[Poincaré conjecture]], proved in 2003 by [[Grigori Perelman]], provides that the 3-sphere is the only three-dimensional manifold (up to [[homeomorphism]]) with these properties.\n\nThe 3-sphere is homeomorphic to the [[one-point compactification]] of {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. In general, any [[topological space]] that is homeomorphic to the 3-sphere is called a '''topological 3-sphere'''.\n\nThe [[homology group]]s of the 3-sphere are as follows: {{math|H<sub>0</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>,'''Z''')}} and {{math|H<sub>3</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>,'''Z''')}} are both [[infinite cyclic]], while {{math|1=H<sub>''i''</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>,'''Z''') = {0&#125;}} for all other indices {{mvar|i}}. Any topological space with these homology groups is known as a [[homology sphere|homology 3-sphere]]. Initially [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] conjectured that all homology 3-spheres are homeomorphic to {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}, but then he himself constructed a non-homeomorphic one, now known as the [[Poincaré homology sphere]]. Infinitely many homology spheres are now known to exist. For example, a [[Dehn filling]] with slope {{math|{{sfrac|1|''n''}}}} on any [[knot theory|knot]] in the 3-sphere gives a homology sphere; typically these are not homeomorphic to the 3-sphere.\n\nAs to the [[homotopy groups]], we have {{math|1=π<sub>1</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>) = π<sub>2</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>) = {0&#125;}} and {{math|π<sub>3</sub>(S<sup>3</sup>)}} is infinite cyclic. The higher-homotopy groups ({{math|''k'' ≥ 4}}) are all [[finite abelian group|finite abelian]] but otherwise follow no discernible pattern. For more discussion see [[homotopy groups of spheres]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: auto;\"\n|+Homotopy groups of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}\n|-\n| {{mvar|k}}\n| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16\n|-\n| {{math|π<sub>''k''</sub>(''S''<sup>3</sup>)}}\n| 0 || 0 || 0 || {{math|'''Z'''}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>12</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>3</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>15</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>⊕'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>12</sub>⊕'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>84</sub>⊕'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>⊕'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>⊕'''Z'''<sub>2</sub>}} || {{math|'''Z'''<sub>6</sub>}}\n|}\n\n===Geometric properties===\nThe 3-sphere is naturally a [[smooth manifold]], in fact, a closed [[embedded submanifold]] of {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}}. The [[Euclidean metric]] on {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}} induces a [[metric tensor|metric]] on the 3-sphere giving it the structure of a [[Riemannian manifold]]. As with all spheres, the 3-sphere has constant positive [[sectional curvature]] equal to {{math|{{sfrac|1|''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}} where {{mvar|r}} is the radius.\n\nMuch of the interesting geometry of the 3-sphere stems from the fact that the 3-sphere has a natural [[Lie group]] structure given by quaternion multiplication (see the section below on [[#Group structure|group structure]]). The only other spheres with such a structure are the 0-sphere and the 1-sphere (see [[circle group]]).\n\nUnlike the 2-sphere, the 3-sphere admits nonvanishing [[vector field]]s ([[section (fiber bundle)|sections]] of its [[tangent bundle]]). One can even find three linearly independent and nonvanishing vector fields. These may be taken to be any left-invariant vector fields forming a basis for the [[Lie algebra]] of the 3-sphere. This implies that the 3-sphere is [[Parallelizable manifold|parallelizable]]. It follows that the tangent bundle of the 3-sphere is [[trivial bundle|trivial]]. For a general discussion of the number of linear independent vector fields on a {{mvar|n}}-sphere, see the article [[vector fields on spheres]].\n\nThere is an interesting [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of the [[circle group]] {{math|'''T'''}} on {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} giving the 3-sphere the structure of a [[principal circle bundle]] known as the [[Hopf bundle]]. If one thinks of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} as a subset of {{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>}}, the action is given by\n:<math>(z_1,z_2)\\cdot\\lambda = (z_1\\lambda,z_2\\lambda)\\quad \\forall\\lambda\\in\\mathbb T</math>.\nThe [[orbit space]] of this action is homeomorphic to the two-sphere {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}}. Since {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} is not homeomorphic to {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup> × ''S''<sup>1</sup>}}, the Hopf bundle is nontrivial.\n\n==Topological construction==\nThere are several well-known constructions of the three-sphere.  Here we describe gluing a pair of three-balls and then the one-point compactification.\n\n===Gluing===\nA 3-sphere can be constructed [[topology|topologically]] by [[Quotient space (topology)|\"gluing\" together]] the boundaries of a pair of 3-[[ball (mathematics)|balls]]. The boundary of a 3-ball is a 2-sphere, and these two 2-spheres are to be identified.  That is, imagine a pair of 3-balls of the same size, then superpose them so that their 2-spherical boundaries match, and let matching pairs of points on the pair of 2-spheres be identically equivalent to each other.  In analogy with the case of the 2-sphere (see below), the gluing surface is called an equatorial sphere.\n\nNote that the interiors of the 3-balls are not glued to each other.  One way to think of the fourth dimension is as a continuous real-valued function of the 3-dimensional coordinates of the 3-ball, perhaps considered to be \"temperature\".  We take the \"temperature\" to be zero along the gluing 2-sphere and let one of the 3-balls be \"hot\" and let the other 3-ball be \"cold\". The \"hot\" 3-ball could be thought of as the \"upper hemisphere\" and the \"cold\" 3-ball could be thought of as the \"lower hemisphere\". The temperature is highest/lowest at the centers of the two 3-balls.\n\nThis construction is analogous to a construction of a 2-sphere, performed by gluing the boundaries of a pair of disks. A disk is a 2-ball, and the boundary of a disk is a circle (a 1-sphere). Let a pair of disks be of the same diameter.  Superpose them and glue corresponding points on their boundaries.  Again one may think of the third dimension as temperature.  Likewise, we may inflate the 2-sphere, moving the pair of disks to become the northern and southern hemispheres.\n\n===One-point compactification===\nAfter removing a single point from the 2-sphere, what remains is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane. In the same way, removing a single point from the 3-sphere yields three-dimensional space. \nAn extremely useful way to see this is via [[stereographic projection]]. We first describe the lower-dimensional version.\n\nRest the south pole of a unit 2-sphere on the {{mvar|xy}}-plane in three-space.  We map a point {{math|P}} of the sphere (minus the north pole {{math|N}}) to the plane by sending {{math|P}} to the intersection of the line {{math|NP}} with the plane.  Stereographic projection of a 3-sphere (again removing the north pole) maps to three-space in the same manner.  (Notice that, since stereographic projection is [[conformal map projection|conformal]], round spheres are sent to round spheres or to planes.)\n\nA somewhat different way to think of the one-point compactification is via the [[exponential map (Riemmanian geometry)|exponential map]].  Returning to our picture of the unit two-sphere sitting on the Euclidean plane: Consider a geodesic in the plane, based at the origin, and map this to a geodesic in the two-sphere of the same length, based at the south pole.  Under this map all points of the circle of radius {{pi}} are sent to the north pole.  Since the open unit disk is homeomorphic to the Euclidean plane, this is again a one-point compactification.\n\nThe exponential map for 3-sphere is similarly constructed; it may also be discussed using the fact that the 3-sphere is the [[Lie group]] of unit quaternions.\n\n==Coordinate systems on the 3-sphere==\nThe four Euclidean coordinates for {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} are redundant since they are subject to the condition that {{math|1=''x''<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup> = 1}}. As a 3-dimensional manifold one should be able to parameterize {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} by three coordinates, just as one can parameterize the 2-sphere using two coordinates (such as [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]). Due to the nontrivial topology of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} it is impossible to find a single set of coordinates that cover the entire space. Just as on the 2-sphere, one must use ''at least'' two [[coordinate chart]]s. Some different choices of coordinates are given below.\n\n===Hyperspherical coordinates===\nIt is convenient to have some sort of [[Hypersphere#Hyperspherical coordinates|hyperspherical coordinates]] on {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} in analogy to the usual [[spherical coordinates]] on {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}}. One such choice — by no means unique — is to use {{math|(''ψ'', ''θ'', ''φ'')}}, where\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_0 &= r\\cos\\psi \\\\\nx_1 &= r\\sin\\psi \\cos\\theta \\\\\nx_2 &= r\\sin\\psi \\sin\\theta \\cos \\varphi \\\\\nx_3 &= r\\sin\\psi \\sin\\theta \\sin\\varphi \\end{align} </math>\nwhere {{mvar|ψ}} and {{mvar|θ}} run over the range 0 to {{pi}}, and {{mvar|φ}} runs over 0 to 2{{pi}}. Note that, for any fixed value of {{mvar|ψ}}, {{mvar|θ}} and {{mvar|φ}} parameterize a 2-sphere of radius {{math|r sin ''ψ''}}, except for the degenerate cases, when {{mvar|ψ}} equals 0 or {{pi}}, in which case they describe a point.\n\nThe [[metric tensor|round metric]] on the 3-sphere in these coordinates is given by{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n:<math>ds^2 = r^2 \\left[ d\\psi^2 + \\sin^2\\psi\\left(d\\theta^2 + \\sin^2\\theta\\, d\\varphi^2\\right) \\right]</math>\nand the [[volume form]] by\n:<math>dV =r^3 \\left(\\sin^2\\psi\\,\\sin\\theta\\right)\\,dr\\wedge d\\psi\\wedge d\\theta\\wedge d\\varphi.</math>\n\nThese coordinates have an elegant description in terms of [[quaternion]]s. Any unit quaternion {{mvar|q}} can be written as a [[versor]]:\n:<math>q = e^{\\tau\\psi} = \\cos\\psi + \\tau\\sin\\psi</math>\nwhere {{mvar|τ}} is a [[Quaternion#Square roots of .E2.88.921|unit imaginary quaternion]]; that is, a quaternion that satisfies {{math|1=''τ''<sup>2</sup> = −1}}. This is the quaternionic analogue of [[Euler's formula]]. Now the unit imaginary quaternions all lie on the unit 2-sphere in {{math|Im '''H'''}} so any such {{mvar|τ}} can be written:\n:<math>\\tau = (\\cos\\theta) i + (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\varphi) j + (\\sin\\theta\\sin\\varphi) k</math>\nWith {{mvar|τ}} in this form, the unit quaternion {{mvar|q}} is given by\n:<math>q = e^{\\tau\\psi} = x_0 + x_1 i + x_2 j + x_3 k</math>\nwhere {{math|''x''<sub>0,1,2,3</sub>}} are as above.\n\nWhen {{mvar|q}} is used to describe spatial rotations (cf. [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s), it describes a rotation about {{mvar|τ}} through an angle of {{math|2''ψ''}}.\n\n===Hopf coordinates===\n[[File:Hopf Fibration.png|right|250px|thumb|The Hopf fibration can be visualized using a [[stereographic projection]] of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} to {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} and then compressing {{math|''R''<sup>3</sup>}} to a ball.  This image shows points on {{math|''S''<sup>2</sup>}} and their corresponding fibers with the same color.]]\nFor unit radius another choice of hyperspherical coordinates, {{math|(''η'', ''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>2</sub>)}}, makes use of the embedding of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} in {{math|'''C'''<sup>2</sup>}}. In complex coordinates {{math|(''z''<sub>1</sub>, ''z''<sub>2</sub>) ∈ '''C'''<sup>2</sup>}} we write\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz_1 &= e^{i\\,\\xi_1}\\sin\\eta \\\\\nz_2 &= e^{i\\,\\xi_2}\\cos\\eta. \\end{align}</math>\n\nThis could also be expressed in {{math|'''R'''<sup>4</sup>}} as\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx_0 &= \\cos\\xi_1\\sin\\eta \\\\\nx_1 &= \\sin\\xi_1\\sin\\eta \\\\\nx_2 &= \\cos\\xi_2\\cos\\eta \\\\\nx_3 &= \\sin\\xi_2\\cos\\eta. \\end{align}</math>\nHere {{mvar|η}} runs over the range 0 to {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, and {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}} can take any values between 0 and 2{{pi}}. These coordinates are useful in the description of the 3-sphere as the [[Hopf bundle]]\n:<math>S^1 \\to S^3 \\to S^2.\\,</math>\n\n[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|A diagram depicting the poloidal ({{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}}) direction, represented by the red arrow, and the toroidal ({{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}}) direction, represented by the blue arrow, although the terms ''poloidal'' and ''toroidal'' are arbitrary in this ''[[Flat torus#Flat torus|flat torus]]'' case.]]\nFor any fixed value of {{mvar|η}} between 0 and {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, the coordinates {{math|(''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>2</sub>)}} parameterize a 2-dimensional [[torus]]. Rings of constant {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}} above form simple orthogonal grids on the tori. See image to right. In the degenerate cases, when {{mvar|η}} equals 0 or {{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}, these coordinates describe a [[circle]].\n\nThe round metric on the 3-sphere in these coordinates is given by\n:<math>ds^2 = d\\eta^2 + \\sin^2\\eta\\,d\\xi_1^2 + \\cos^2\\eta\\,d\\xi_2^2</math>\nand the volume form by\n:<math>dV = \\sin\\eta\\cos\\eta\\,d\\eta\\wedge d\\xi_1\\wedge d\\xi_2.</math>\n\nTo get the interlocking circles of the [[Hopf fibration]], make a simple substitution in the equations above<ref>{{cite web|last1=Banchoff|first1=Thomas|title=The Flat Torus in the Three-Sphere|url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/script/b3d/hypertorus.html}}</ref>\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz_1 &= e^{i\\,(\\xi_1+\\xi_2)}\\sin\\eta \\\\\nz_2 &= e^{i\\,(\\xi_2-\\xi_1)}\\cos\\eta. \\end{align}</math>\n\nIn this case {{mvar|η}}, and {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} specify which circle, and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}} specifies the position along each circle. One round trip (0 to 2{{pi}}) of {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} or {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}} equates to a round trip of the torus in the 2 respective directions.\n\n===Stereographic coordinates===\nAnother convenient set of coordinates can be obtained via [[stereographic projection]] of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} from a pole onto the corresponding equatorial {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} [[hyperplane]]. For example, if we project from the point {{math|(−1, 0, 0, 0)}} we can write a point {{mvar|p}} in {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} as\n:<math>p = \\left(\\frac{1-\\|u\\|^2}{1+\\|u\\|^2}, \\frac{2\\mathbf{u}}{1+\\|u\\|^2}\\right) = \\frac{1+\\mathbf{u}}{1-\\mathbf{u}}</math>\nwhere {{math|1='''u''' = (''u''<sub>1</sub>, ''u''<sub>2</sub>, ''u''<sub>3</sub>)}} is a vector in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}} and {{math|1={{norm|''u''}}<sup>2</sup> = ''u''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''u''<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> + ''u''<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup>}}. In the second equality above, we have identified {{mvar|p}} with a unit quaternion and {{math|1='''u''' = ''u''<sub>1</sub>''i'' + ''u''<sub>2</sub>''j'' + ''u''<sub>3</sub>''k''}} with a pure quaternion. (Note that the numerator and denominator commute here even though quaternionic multiplication is generally noncommutative). The inverse of this map takes {{math|1=''p'' = (''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''x''<sub>3</sub>)}} in {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} to\n:<math>\\mathbf{u} = \\frac{1}{1+x_0}\\left(x_1, x_2, x_3\\right).</math>\n\nWe could just as well have projected from the point {{math|(1, 0, 0, 0)}}, in which case the point {{mvar|p}} is given by\n:<math>p = \\left(\\frac{-1+\\|v\\|^2}{1+\\|v\\|^2}, \\frac{2\\mathbf{v}}{1+\\|v\\|^2}\\right) = \\frac{-1+\\mathbf{v}}{1+\\mathbf{v}}</math>\nwhere {{math|1='''v''' = (''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>2</sub>, ''v''<sub>3</sub>)}} is another vector in {{math|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>}}. The inverse of this map takes {{mvar|p}} to\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{1-x_0}\\left(x_1,x_2,x_3\\right).</math>\n\nNote that the {{math|'''u'''}} coordinates are defined everywhere but {{math|(−1, 0, 0, 0)}} and the {{math|'''v'''}} coordinates everywhere but {{math|(1, 0, 0, 0)}}. This defines an [[atlas (topology)|atlas]] on {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} consisting of two [[chart (topology)|coordinate charts]] or \"patches\", which together cover all of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}. Note that the transition function between these two charts on their overlap is given by\n:<math>\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{\\|u\\|^2}\\mathbf{u}</math>\nand vice versa.\n\n==Group structure==\nWhen considered as the set of unit [[quaternion]]s, {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} inherits an important structure, namely that of quaternionic multiplication. Because the set of unit quaternions is closed under multiplication, {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} takes on the structure of a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Moreover, since quaternionic multiplication is [[smooth function|smooth]], {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} can be regarded as a real [[Lie group]]. It is a [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]], [[Compact space|compact]] Lie group of dimension 3. When thought of as a Lie group {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} is often denoted [[symplectic group|{{math|Sp(1)}}]] or {{math|U(1, '''H''')}}.\n\nIt turns out that the only [[hypersphere|spheres]] that admit a Lie group structure are [[unit circle|{{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}}]], thought of as the set of unit [[complex number]]s, and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}, the set of unit quaternions. One might think that {{math|''S''<sup>7</sup>}}, the set of unit [[octonion]]s, would form a Lie group, but this fails since octonion multiplication is [[associative|nonassociative]]. The octonionic structure does give {{math|''S''<sup>7</sup>}} one important property: ''[[parallelizability]]''. It turns out that the only spheres that are parallelizable are {{math|''S''<sup>1</sup>}}, {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}, and {{math|''S''<sup>7</sup>}}.\n\nBy using a [[matrix (math)|matrix]] representation of the quaternions, {{math|'''H'''}}, one obtains a matrix representation of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}. One convenient choice is given by the [[Pauli matrices]]:\n:<math>x_1+ x_2 i + x_3 j + x_4 k \\mapsto \\begin{pmatrix}\\;\\;\\,x_1 + i x_2 & x_3 + i x_4 \\\\ -x_3 + i x_4 & x_1 - i x_2\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\nThis map gives an [[injective]] [[algebra homomorphism]] from {{math|'''H'''}} to the set of 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 complex matrices. It has the property that the [[absolute value]] of a quaternion {{mvar|q}} is equal to the [[square root]] of the [[determinant]] of the matrix image of {{mvar|q}}.\n\nThe set of unit quaternions is then given by matrices of the above form with unit determinant. This matrix subgroup is precisely the [[special unitary group]] {{math|SU(2)}}. Thus, {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} as a Lie group is [[isomorphic]] to {{math|SU(2)}}.\n\nUsing our Hopf coordinates {{math|(''η'', ''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>2</sub>)}} we can then write any element of {{math|SU(2)}} in the form\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}e^{i\\,\\xi_1}\\sin\\eta & e^{i\\,\\xi_2}\\cos\\eta \\\\ -e^{-i\\,\\xi_2}\\cos\\eta & e^{-i\\,\\xi_1}\\sin\\eta\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nAnother way to state this result is if we express the matrix representation of an element of {{math|SU(2)}} as a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. It is seen that an arbitrary element {{math|''U'' ∈ SU(2)}} can be written as\n:<math>U=\\alpha_0 I + \\sum_{i=1}^3\\alpha_i J_i.</math>\nThe condition that the determinant of {{mvar|U}} is +1 implies that the coefficients {{mvar|α<sub>1</sub>}} are constrained to lie on a 3-sphere.\n\n==In literature==\nIn [[Edwin Abbott Abbott]]'s ''[[Flatland]]'', published in 1884, and in ''[[Sphereland]]'', a 1965 sequel to Flatland by [[Dionys Burger]], the 3-sphere is referred to as an '''oversphere''', and a 4-sphere is referred to as a '''hypersphere'''.\n\nWriting in the [[American Journal of Physics]],<ref>[[Mark A.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''quaternion algebra''' over a field ''F'' is a [[central simple algebra]] ''A'' over ''F''<ref>See Peirce. Associative algebras. Springer. Lemma at page 14.</ref><ref>See Milies & Sehgal, An introduction to group rings, exercise 17, chapter 2.</ref> that has dimension 4 over ''F''. Every quaternion algebra becomes the matrix algebra by ''[[Scalar extension|extending scalars]]'' (equivalently, [[tensor product of algebras|tensoring]] with a field extension), i.e. for a suitable [[field extension]] ''K'' of ''F'', <math>A \\otimes_F K</math> is isomorphic to the 2×2 [[matrix algebra]] over ''K''.\n\nThe notion of a quaternion algebra can be seen as a generalization of Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s to an arbitrary [[base field]]. The Hamilton quaternions are a quaternion algebra (in the above sense) over <math>F = \\mathbb{R}</math> (the [[real number field]]), and indeed the only one over <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> apart from the 2×2 [[real matrix]] algebra, up to [[isomorphism]]. When <math>F = \\mathbb{C}</math>, then the [[biquaternion]]s form the quaternion algebra over ''F''.\n\n==Structure==\n''Quaternion algebra'' here means something more general than the algebra of Hamilton's [[quaternions]]. When the [[coefficient field]] ''F'' does not have characteristic 2, every quaternion algebra over ''F'' can be described as a 4-dimensional ''F''-[[vector space]] with basis <math>\\{ 1, i, j, k\\}</math>, with the following multiplication rules:\n:<math>i^2=a</math>\n:<math>j^2=b</math>\n:<math>ij=k</math>\n:<math>ji=-k</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are any given nonzero elements of ''F''.  From these rules we get:\n:<math>k^2=ijij=-iijj=-ab</math>\n\nThe classical instances where <math>F=\\mathbb{R}</math> are Hamilton's quaternions (''a'' = ''b'' = −1) and [[split-quaternion]]s (''a'' = −1, ''b'' = +1). In split-quaternions, <math>k^2 = +1</math> and <math>j k = - i </math>, contrary to Hamilton's equations.\n\nThe algebra defined in this way is denoted (''a'',''b'')<sub>''F''</sub> or simply (''a'',''b'').<ref name=GS2>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.2</ref>  When ''F'' has characteristic 2, a different explicit description in terms of a basis of 4 elements is also possible, but in any event the definition of a quaternion algebra over ''F'' as a 4-dimensional central simple algebra over ''F'' applies uniformly in all characteristics.\n\nA quaternion algebra (''a'',''b'')<sub>''F''</sub> is either a [[division algebra]] or isomorphic to the [[matrix algebra]] of 2×2 matrices over ''F'': the latter case is termed ''split''.<ref name=GS3>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.3</ref>  The ''norm form''\n:<math>N(t + xi +yj + zk) = t^2 - ax^2 - by^2 + abz^2 \\ </math>\ndefines a structure of [[division algebra]] if and only if the norm is an [[anisotropic quadratic form]], that is, zero only on the zero element.  The [[conic section|conic]] ''C''(''a'',''b'') defined by\n:<math>a x^2 + b y^2 = z^2 \\ </math>\nhas a point (''x'',''y'',''z'') with coordinates in ''F'' in the split case.<ref name=GS7>Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.7</ref>\n\n==Application==\nQuaternion algebras are applied in [[number theory]], particularly to [[quadratic form]]s. They are concrete structures that generate the elements of order two in the [[Brauer group]] of ''F''.  For some fields, including algebraic number fields, every element of order 2 in its Brauer group is represented by a quaternion algebra. A theorem of [[Alexander Merkurjev]] implies that each element of order 2 in the Brauer group of any field is represented by a [[tensor product]] of quaternion algebras.<ref name=Lam139>Lam (2005) p.139</ref>  In particular, over [[p-adic field|''p''-adic field]]s the construction of quaternion algebras can be viewed as the quadratic [[Hilbert symbol]] of [[local class field theory]].\n\n==Classification==\nIt is a theorem of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] that there are only two real quaternion algebras: 2×2 matrices over the reals and Hamilton's real quaternions.\n\nIn a similar way, over any [[local field]] ''F'' there are exactly two quaternion algebras: the 2×2 matrices over ''F'' and a division algebra.\nBut the quaternion division algebra over a local field is usually ''not'' Hamilton's quaternions over the field.  For example, over the ''p''-adic numbers Hamilton's quaternions are a division algebra only when ''p'' is 2.  For odd prime ''p'', the ''p''-adic Hamilton quaternions are isomorphic to the 2×2 matrices over the ''p''-adics. To see the ''p''-adic Hamilton quaternions are not a division algebra for odd prime ''p'', observe that the congruence ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = −1 mod ''p'' is solvable and therefore by [[Hensel's lemma]] — here is where ''p'' being odd is needed — the equation\n\n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = −1\n\nis solvable in the ''p''-adic numbers. Therefore the quaternion\n\n:''xi'' + ''yj'' + ''k''\n\nhas norm 0 and hence doesn't have a [[multiplicative inverse]].\n\nOne way to classify the [[Algebra homomorphism|''F''-algebra isomorphism]] [[equivalence class|classes]] of all quaternion algebras for a given field, ''F'' is to use the one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of quaternion algebras over ''F'' and isomorphism classes of their ''norm forms''.\n\nTo every quaternion algebra ''A'', one can associate a quadratic form ''N'' (called the ''[[norm form]]'') on ''A'' such that\n\n:<math>N(xy) = N(x)N(y)</math>\n\nfor all ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''. It turns out that the possible norm forms for quaternion ''F''-algebras are exactly the [[Pfister form|Pfister 2-forms]].\n\n==Quaternion algebras over the rational numbers==\nQuaternion algebras over the rational numbers have an arithmetic theory similar to, but more complicated than, that of quadratic extensions of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>.\n\nLet <math>B</math> be a quaternion algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math> and let <math>\\nu</math> be a [[Place (mathematics)|place]] of <math>\\mathbb{Q}</math>, with completion <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>  (so it is either the ''p''-adic numbers <math>\\mathbb{Q}_p</math> for some prime ''p'' or the real numbers <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>).  Define <math>B_\\nu:= \\mathbb{Q}_\\nu \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Q}} B</math>, which is a quaternion algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  So there are two choices for\n<math>B_\\nu</math>:  the 2 by 2 matrices over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math> or a [[division algebra]].\n\nWe say that <math>B</math> is '''split''' (or '''unramified''') at <math>\\nu</math> if <math>B_\\nu</math> is isomorphic to the 2×2 matrices over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  We say that ''B'' is '''non-split''' (or '''ramified''') at <math>\\nu</math> if <math>B_\\nu</math> is the quaternion division algebra over <math>\\mathbb{Q}_\\nu</math>.  For example, the rational Hamilton quaternions is non-split at 2 and at <math>\\infty</math> and split at all odd primes. The rational 2 by 2 matrices are split at all places.\n\nA quaternion algebra over the rationals which splits at <math>\\infty</math> is analogous to a real [[quadratic field]] and one which is non-split at <math>\\infty</math> is analogous to an imaginary quadratic field. The analogy comes from a quadratic field having real embeddings when the minimal polynomial for a  generator splits over the reals and having non-real embeddings otherwise.  One illustration of the strength of this analogy concerns [[unit group]]s in an order of a rational quaternion algebra:\nit is infinite if the quaternion algebra splits at <math>\\infty</math>{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and it is finite otherwise{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, just as the unit group of an order in a quadratic ring is infinite in the real quadratic case and finite otherwise.\n\nThe number of places where a quaternion algebra over the rationals ramifies is always even, and this is equivalent to the [[quadratic reciprocity law]] over the rationals.\nMoreover, the places where ''B'' ramifies determines ''B'' up to isomorphism as an algebra.  (In other words, non-isomorphic quaternion algebras over the rationals do not share the same set of ramified places.) The product of the primes at which ''B'' ramifies is called the '''discriminant''' of ''B''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[composition algebra]]\n*[[cyclic algebra]]\n*[[octonion algebra]]\n*[[Hurwitz quaternion order]]\n*[[Hurwitz quaternion]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1=Gille | first1=Philippe | last2=Szamuely | first2=Tamás | title=Central simple algebras and Galois cohomology | series=Cambridge Studies in Advanced Mathematics | volume=101 | location=Cambridge | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2006 | isbn=0-521-86103-9 | zbl=1137.12001 | doi=10.1017/CBO9780511607219}}\n* {{cite book | first=Tsit-Yuen | last=Lam | authorlink=Tsit Yuen Lam | title=Introduction to Quadratic Forms over Fields | volume=67 | series=[[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]] | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-8218-1095-2 | zbl=1068.11023 | mr = 2104929 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{wikibooks|Associative Composition Algebra|Quaternions|Quaternion algebras over R and C}}\n* {{cite book | last1=Knus | first1=Max-Albert | last2=Merkurjev | first2=Alexander | author2-link=Alexander Merkurjev | last3=Rost | first3=Markus | author3-link=Markus Rost | last4=Tignol | first4=Jean-Pierre | title=The book of involutions | others=With a preface by J.

The editions of ''Elements of Quaternions'', in 1866 by [[William Edwin Hamilton]] (son of Rowan), and in 1899, 1901 by [[Charles Jasper Joly]], reduced the biquaternion coverage in favor of the real quaternions.\n\nConsidered with the operations of component-wise addition, and multiplication according to the quaternion group, this collection forms a [[Four-dimensional space|4-dimensional]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] over the complex numbers ℂ. The algebra of biquaternions is [[associative]], but not [[commutative]]. A biquaternion is either a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] or a [[zero divisor]]. The algebra of biquaternions forms a [[composition algebra]] and can be constructed from [[bicomplex number]]s.

It is seen that {{math|(''h'''''j''')(''h'''''k''') {{=}} (−'''1''')'''i'''}}, and that the square of this element is {{math|−'''1'''}}. These elements generate the [[dihedral group]] of the square. The [[linear subspace]] with basis {{math|{'''1''', '''i''', ''h'''''j''', ''h'''''k'''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} thus is closed under multiplication, and forms the coquaternion algebra.\n\nIn the context of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[spinor]] algebra, the biquaternions {{math|''h'''''i''', ''h'''''j'''}}, and {{math|''h'''''k'''}} (or their negatives), viewed in the {{math|M<sub>2</sub>(ℂ)}} representation, are called [[Pauli matrices]].\n\n==Algebraic properties==\nThe biquaternions have two ''conjugations'':\n* the '''biconjugate''' or biscalar minus [[bivector (complex)|bivector]] is <math>q^* = w - x\\mathbf i - y\\mathbf j - z\\mathbf k \\!\\ ,</math> and\n* the [[complex conjugation]] of biquaternion coefficients <math>q^{\\star} = w^{\\star} + x^{\\star}\\mathbf i + y^{\\star}\\mathbf j + z^{\\star}\\mathbf k </math>\nwhere <math>z^{\\star} = a - bh</math> when <math>z = a + bh,\\quad a,b \\in \\mathbb R,\\quad h^2 = -\\mathbf 1.</math>\n\nNote that <math>(pq)^* = q^* p^*, \\quad (pq)^{\\star} = p^{\\star} q^{\\star} , \\quad (q^*)^{\\star} = (q^{\\star})^*.</math>\n\nClearly, if <math>q q^* = 0 </math> then {{math|''q''}} is a zero divisor.

The [[transformation group]] <math>G = \\lbrace g : g g^* = 1 \\rbrace </math> has two parts, <math>G \\cap H</math>  and <math>G \\cap M.</math> The first part is characterized by <math>g = g^{\\star}</math> ; then the Lorentz transformation corresponding to {{mvar|g}} is given by <math>T(q) = g^{-1} q g </math> since <math>g^* = g^{-1}. </math> Such a transformation is a [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation by quaternion multiplication]], and the collection of them is [[O(3)]] <math>\\cong G \\cap H .</math> But this subgroup of {{mvar|G}} is not a [[normal subgroup]], so no [[quotient group]] can be formed.\n\nTo view <math>G \\cap M</math> it is necessary to show some subalgebra structure in the biquaternions. Let {{mvar|r}} represent an element of the [[quaternion#Square roots of −1|sphere of square roots of minus one]] in the real quaternion subalgebra {{math|ℍ}}. Then {{math|(''hr'')<sup>2</sup> {{=}} +1}} and the plane of biquaternions given by <math>D_r = \\lbrace z = x + yhr : x, y \\in \\mathbb R \\rbrace</math> is a commutative subalgebra isomorphic to the plane of [[split-complex number]]s. Just as the ordinary complex plane has a unit circle, <math>D_r </math> has a [[unit hyperbola]] given by\n\n:<math>\\exp(ahr) = \\cosh(a) + hr\\ \\sinh(a),\\quad a \\in R. </math>\n\nJust as the unit circle turns by multiplication through one of its elements, so the hyperbola turns because <math>\\exp(ahr) \\exp(bhr) = \\exp((a+b)hr). </math> Hence these algebraic operators on the hyperbola are called [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versors]]. The unit circle in {{math|ℂ}} and unit hyperbola in {{math|''D''<sub>''r''</sub>}} are examples of [[one-parameter group]]s. For every square root {{math|''r''}} of minus one in {{math|ℍ}}, there is a one-parameter group in the biquaternions given by <math>G \\cap D_r.</math>\n\nThe space of biquaternions has a natural [[topology]] through the [[Euclidean metric]] on {{math|8}}-space. With respect to this topology, {{mvar|G}} is a [[topological group]]. Moreover, it has analytic structure making it a six-parameter [[Lie group]]. Consider the subspace of [[bivector (complex)|bivector]]s  <math>A = \\lbrace q : q^* = -q \\rbrace </math>. Then the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]]\n<math>\\exp:A \\to G</math>  takes the real vectors to <math>G \\cap H</math> and the {{mvar|h}}-vectors to <math>G \\cap M.</math> When equipped with the [[commutator]], {{mvar|A}} forms the [[Lie algebra]] of {{mvar|G}}. Thus this study of a [[six-dimensional space]] serves to introduce the general concepts of [[Lie theory]]. When viewed in the matrix representation, {{mvar|G}} is called the [[special linear group]] [[SL(2,C)]] in {{math|M<sub>2</sub>(ℂ)}}.\n\nMany of the concepts of [[special relativity]] are illustrated through the biquaternion structures laid out. The subspace {{mvar|M}} corresponds to [[Minkowski space]], with the four coordinates giving the time and space locations of events in a resting [[frame of reference]]. Any hyperbolic versor {{math|exp(''ahr'')}} corresponds to a [[velocity]] in direction {{mvar|r}} of speed {{math|''c'' tanh ''a''}}  where {{mvar|c}} is the [[velocity of light]]. The inertial frame of reference of this velocity can be made the resting frame by applying the [[Lorentz boost]] {{mvar|T}} given by {{math|''g'' {{=}} exp(0.5''ahr'')}} since then <math>g^{\\star} = \\exp(-0.5ahr) = g^*</math> so that <math>T(\\exp(ahr)) = 1 .</math>\nNaturally the [[hyperboloid]] <math>G \\cap M,</math> which represents the range of velocities for sub-luminal motion, is of physical interest. There has been considerable work associating this \"velocity space\" with the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]].  In special relativity, the [[hyperbolic angle]] parameter of a hyperbolic versor is called [[rapidity]]. Thus we see the biquaternion group {{mvar|G}} provides a [[group representation]] for the [[Lorentz group]].\n\nAfter the introduction of [[spinor]] theory, particularly in the hands of [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Élie Cartan]], the biquaternion representation of the Lorentz group was superseded. The new methods were founded on [[basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] in the set\n\n:<math>\\lbrace q \\ :\\  q q^* = 0 \\rbrace = \\lbrace w + x\\mathbf i + y\\mathbf j + z\\mathbf k \\ :\\ w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 0 \\rbrace </math>\n\nwhich is called the ''complex light cone''. The above [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation of the Lorentz group]] coincides with what physicists refer to as [[four-vector]]s.  Beyond four-vectors, the [[standard model]] of particle physics also includes other Lorentz representations, known as [[Lorentz scalar|scalars]], and the {{math|(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1)}}-representation associated with e.g. the [[electromagnetic field tensor]]. Furthermore, particle physics makes use of the {{math|SL(2, ℂ)}} representations (or [[projective representation]]s of the Lorentz group) known as left- and right-handed [[Weyl spinor]]s, [[Majorana spinor]]s, and [[Dirac spinor]]s.  It is known that each of these seven representations can be constructed as invariant subspaces within the biquaternions.<ref>{{harvnb|Furey|2012}}</ref>\n\n==As a composition algebra==\nAlthough W.R. Hamilton introduced biquaternions in the 19th century, its delineation of its [[mathematical structure]] as a special type of [[algebra over a field]] was accomplished in the 20th century: the biquaternions may be generated out of the [[bicomplex number]]s in the same way that [[Adrian Albert]] generated the real quaternions out of complex numbers in the so-called [[Cayley–Dickson construction]].  In this construction, a bicomplex number (''w,z'') has conjugate (''w,z'')* = (''w'', – ''z'').\n\nThe biquaternion is then a pair of bicomplex numbers (''a,b''), where the product with a second biquaternion (''c, d'') is\n:<math>(a,b)(c,d) = (a c - d^* b, d a + b c^* ).</math>\n\nIf <math>a = (u, v), b = (w,z), </math> then the ''biconjugate'' <math>(a, b)^* = (a^*, -b).</math>\n\nWhen (''a,b'')* is written as a 4-vector of ordinary complex numbers,\n:<math>(u, v, w, z)^* = (u, -v, -w, -z). </math>\nThe biquaternions form an example of a [[quaternion algebra]], and it has norm\n:<math>N(u,v,w,z) = u^2 + v^2 + w^2 + z^2 .</math>\nTwo biquaternions ''p'' and ''q'' satisfy <math>N(p q) = N(p) N(q) </math> indicating that ''N'' is a quadratic form admitting composition, so that the biquaternions form a [[composition algebra]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Biquaternion algebra]]\n*[[Hypercomplex number]]\n*[[Hyperbolic quaternion#MacFarlane's hyperbolic quaternion paper of 1900|MacFarlane's use]]\n*[[Quotient ring#Quaternions and alternatives|Quotient ring]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{wikibooks|Associative Composition Algebra|Quaternions|Biquaternions}}\n* [[Arthur Buchheim]] (1885) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2369176  \"A Memoir on biquaternions\"], [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 7(4):293 to 326 from [[Jstor]] early  content. \n*{{citation|first=Arthur W.|last=Conway|authorlink=Arthur W.

      "text": "In [[elliptic geometry]], two lines are '''Clifford parallel''' or '''paratactic lines''' if the perpendicular distance between them is constant from point to point. The concept was first studied by [[William Kingdon Clifford]] in [[elliptic geometry#Elliptic space|elliptic space]].

      "text": "[[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|Spatial rotations in three dimensions]] can be [[Coordinate system|parametrized]] using both [[Euler angles]] and [[Quaternions and spatial rotation|unit quaternions]]. This article explains how to convert between the two representations.  Actually this simple use of \"quaternions\" was first presented by [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] some seventy years earlier than [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] to solve the problem of [[magic square]]s.  For this reason the dynamics community commonly refers to quaternions in this application as \"Euler parameters\".\n\n==Definition==\nFor the rest of this article, the [[JPL]] [[quaternion]] convention<ref>W. G. Breckenridge, \"Quaternions proposed standard conventions,\" NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Technical Report, Oct. 1979.</ref> shall be used. A unit [[quaternion]] can be described as:\n:<math>\\mathbf{q} = \\begin{bmatrix} q_0 & q_1 & q_2 & q_3 \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} q_w & q_x & q_y & q_z \\end{bmatrix}^T</math>\n:<math>|\\mathbf{q}|^2 = q_0^2 + q_1^2 + q_2^2 + q_3^2 = q_w^2 + q_x^2 + q_y^2 + q_z^2 = 1</math>\n\nWe can associate a [[quaternion]] with a rotation around an axis by the following expression\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_0 = \\mathbf{q}_w = \\cos(\\alpha/2)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_1 = \\mathbf{q}_x = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_x)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_2 = \\mathbf{q}_y = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_y)</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{q}_3 = \\mathbf{q}_z = \\sin(\\alpha/2)\\cos(\\beta_z)</math>\nwhere α is a simple rotation angle (the value in radians of the [[angle of rotation]]) and cos(β<sub>''x''</sub>), cos(β<sub>''y''</sub>) and cos(β<sub>''z''</sub>) are the  \"[[direction cosine]]s\" locating the axis of rotation (Euler's Rotation Theorem).\n\n===Tait–Bryan angles===\n[[Image:taitbrianzyx.svg|thumb|right|200px|Tait–Bryan angles. ''z-y′-x″'' sequence (intrinsic rotations; ''N'' coincides with ''y’''). The angle rotation sequence is ''ψ'', ''θ'', ''Ф''. Note that in this case ''ψ > 90°'' and ''θ'' is a negative angle.]]\n\nSimilarly for Euler angles, we use the [[Euler angles#Tait-Bryan angles|Tait Bryan angles]] (in terms of [[flight dynamics]]):\n* Bank – <math>\\phi</math>: rotation about the new X-axis\n* Attitude – <math>\\theta</math>: rotation about the new Y-axis\n* Heading – <math>\\psi</math>: rotation about the Z-axis\nwhere the X-axis points forward, Y-axis to the right and Z-axis downward with angles defined for clockwise/lefthand rotation. In the conversion example [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles#Conversion|above]] the rotation occurs in the order heading, attitude, bank (about intrinsic axes).\n\n== Rotation matrices ==\nThe [[orthogonal matrix]] (post-multiplying a column vector) corresponding to a clockwise/[[Right-hand rule|left-handed]] (looking along positive axis to origin) rotation by the unit [[quaternion]] <math>q=q_0+iq_1+jq_2+kq_3</math> is given by the [[Quaternions and spatial rotation#Quaternion-derived rotation matrix|inhomogeneous expression]]:\n\n:<math>R = \\begin{bmatrix}\n 1- 2(q_2^2 + q_3^2) &  2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) &  2(q_0 q_2 + q_1 q_3) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & 1 - 2(q_1^2 + q_3^2)  &  2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) & 2( q_0 q_1 + q_2 q_3) &  1 - 2(q_1^2 + q_2^2)\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nor equivalently, by the [[Homogeneous coordinates|homogeneous]] expression:\n\n:<math>R = \\begin{bmatrix}\nq_0^2 + q_1^2 - q_2^2 - q_3^2 &  2(q_1 q_2 - q_0 q_3) &  2(q_0 q_2 + q_1 q_3) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_2 + q_0 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 + q_2^2 - q_3^2 &  2(q_2 q_3 - q_0 q_1) \\\\\n2(q_1 q_3 - q_0 q_2) & 2( q_0 q_1 + q_2 q_3) & q_0^2 - q_1^2 - q_2^2 + q_3^2 \n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nIf <math>q_0+iq_1+jq_2+kq_3</math> is not a unit quaternion then the homogeneous form is still a scalar multiple of a rotation matrix, while the inhomogeneous form is in general no longer an orthogonal matrix.

The resulting orientation of Body 3-2-1 sequence (around the capitalized axis in the illustration of Tait–Bryan angles) is equivalent to that of lab 1-2-3 sequence (around the lower-cased axis), where the airplane is rolled first (lab-x axis), and then nosed up around the horizontal lab-y axis, and finally rotated around the vertical lab-z axis ('''lB''' = '''lab2Body'''):\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathbf{q_{lB}} & = \n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\psi /2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\sin (\\psi /2) \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\theta /2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\sin (\\theta /2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\cos (\\phi /2) \\\\ \\sin (\\phi /2) \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\n\\\\\n& = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos (\\phi /2) \\cos (\\theta /2) \\cos (\\psi /2) +  \\sin (\\phi /2) \\sin (\\theta /2) \\sin (\\psi /2) \\\\\n\\sin (\\phi /2) \\cos (\\theta /2) \\cos (\\psi /2) -  \\cos (\\phi /2) \\sin (\\theta /2) \\sin (\\psi /2) \\\\\n\\cos (\\phi /2) \\sin (\\theta /2) \\cos (\\psi /2) +  \\sin (\\phi /2) \\cos (\\theta /2) \\sin (\\psi /2) \\\\\n\\cos (\\phi /2) \\cos (\\theta /2) \\sin (\\psi /2) -  \\sin (\\phi /2) \\sin (\\theta /2) \\cos (\\psi /2) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOther rotation sequences use different conventions.<ref name=nasa-rotation />\n\n=== Source Code ===\nBelow code in C++ illustrates above conversion:\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nQuaterniond toQuaternion( double yaw, double pitch, double roll) // yaw (Z), pitch (Y), roll (X)\n{\n    // Abbreviations for the various angular functions\n    double cy = cos(yaw * 0.5);\n    double sy = sin(yaw * 0.5);\n    double cp = cos(pitch * 0.5);\n    double sp = sin(pitch * 0.5);\n    double cr = cos(roll * 0.5);\n    double sr = sin(roll * 0.5);\n\n    Quaterniond q;\n    q.w() = cy * cp * cr + sy * sp * sr;\n    q.x() = cy * cp * sr - sy * sp * cr;\n    q.y() = sy * cp * sr + cy * sp * cr;\n    q.z() = sy * cp * cr - cy * sp * sr;\n    return q;\n}\n</source>\n\n== Quaternion to Euler Angles Conversion ==\n\nThe Euler angles can be obtained from the quaternions via the relations:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Blanco|first1=Jose-Luis|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.468.5407&rep=rep1&type=pdf|title=A tutorial on se (3) transformation parameterizations and on-manifold optimization|journal=University of Malaga, Tech.

In computational implementations this requires two quaternion multiplications. An alternative approach is to apply the pair of relations\n:<math>\\vec{t} = 2\\vec{q} \\times \\vec{v}</math>\n:<math>\\vec{v}^{\\,\\prime} = \\vec{v} + q_0 \\vec{t} + \\vec{q} \\times \\vec{t}</math>\nwhere <math>\\times</math> indicates a three-dimensional vector cross product.

It is an [[group extension|extension]] of the [[cyclic group]] of order 2 by a cyclic group of order 2''n'', giving the name ''di-cyclic''.

The multiplication rules are given by\n*<math>a^k a^m = a^{k+m}</math>\n*<math>a^k a^m x = a^{k+m}x</math>\n*<math>a^k x a^m = a^{k-m}x</math>\n*<math>a^k x a^m x = a^{k-m+n}</math>\nIt follows that Dic<sub>''n''</sub> has [[order (group theory)|order]] 4''n''.<ref name=\"Roman\"/>\n\nWhen ''n'' = 2, the dicyclic group is [[isomorphic]] to the [[quaternion group]] ''Q''. More generally, when ''n'' is a power of 2, the dicyclic group is isomorphic to the [[generalized quaternion group]].<ref name=\"Roman\"/>\n\n==Properties==\n\nFor each ''n'' > 1, the dicyclic group Dic<sub>''n''</sub> is a [[non-abelian group]] of order 4''n''.  (For the degenerate case ''n'' = 1, the group Dic<sub>1</sub> is the cyclic group ''C''<sub>4</sub>, which is not considered dicyclic.)\n\nLet ''A'' = {{angbr|''a''}} be the subgroup of Dic<sub>''n''</sub> [[generating set of a group|generated]] by ''a''. Then ''A'' is a cyclic group of order 2''n'', so [Dic<sub>''n''</sub>:''A''] = 2. As a subgroup of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 it is automatically a [[normal subgroup]]. The quotient group Dic<sub>''n''</sub>/''A'' is a cyclic group of order 2.\n\nDic<sub>''n''</sub> is [[solvable group|solvable]]; note that ''A'' is normal, and being abelian, is itself solvable.\n\n==Binary dihedral group==\n[[Image:Dicyclic-commutative-diagram.svg|right]]\n\nThe dicyclic group is a [[binary polyhedral group]] — it is one of the classes of subgroups of the [[Pin group]] Pin<sub>&minus;</sub>(2), which is a subgroup of the [[Spin group]] Spin(3) — and in this context is known as the '''binary dihedral group'''.\n\nThe connection with the [[binary cyclic group]] ''C''<sub>2''n''</sub>, the cyclic group ''C''<sub>''n''</sub>, and the [[dihedral group]] Dih<sub>''n''</sub> of order 2''n'' is illustrated in the diagram at right, and parallels the corresponding diagram for the Pin group.\n\nThere is a superficial resemblance between the dicyclic groups and [[dihedral group]]s; both are a sort of \"mirroring\" of an underlying cyclic group. But the presentation of a dihedral group would have ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 1, instead of ''x''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>; and this yields a different structure. In particular, Dic<sub>''n''</sub> is not a [[semidirect product]] of ''A'' and {{angbr|''x''}}, since ''A''&nbsp;∩&nbsp;{{angbr|''x''}} is not trivial.\n\nThe dicyclic group has a unique [[involution (mathematics)#Group theory|involution]] (i.e. an element of order 2), namely ''x''<sup>2</sup> = ''a''<sup>''n''</sup>. Note that this element lies in the [[center of a group|center]] of Dic<sub>''n''</sub>. Indeed, the center consists solely of the identity element and ''x''<sup>2</sup>. If we add the relation ''x''<sup>2</sup> = 1 to the presentation of Dic<sub>''n''</sub> one obtains a presentation of the [[dihedral group]] Dih<sub>2''n''</sub>, so the quotient group Dic<sub>''n''</sub>/<''x''<sup>2</sup>> is isomorphic to Dih<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThere is a natural 2-to-1 [[homomorphism]] from the group of unit quaternions to the 3-dimensional [[rotation group SO(3)|rotation group]] described at [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s. Since the dicyclic group can be embedded inside the unit quaternions one can ask what the image of it is under this homomorphism. The answer is just the dihedral symmetry group Dih<sub>''n''</sub>. For this reason the dicyclic group is also known as the '''binary dihedral group'''. Note that the dicyclic group does not contain any subgroup isomorphic to Dih<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThe analogous pre-image construction, using Pin<sub>+</sub>(2) instead of Pin<sub>&minus;</sub>(2), yields another dihedral group, Dih<sub>2''n''</sub>, rather than a dicyclic group.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nLet ''A'' be an [[abelian group]], having a specific element ''y'' in ''A'' with order 2. A group ''G'' is called a '''generalized dicyclic group''', written as '''Dic(''A'', ''y'')''', if it is generated by ''A'' and an additional element ''x'', and in addition we have that [''G'':''A''] = 2, ''x''<sup>2</sup> = ''y'', and for all ''a'' in ''A'', ''x''<sup>−1</sup>''ax'' = ''a''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.\n\nSince for a cyclic group of even order, there is always a unique element of order 2, we can see that dicyclic groups are just a specific type of generalized dicyclic group.\n\n==See also==\n*[[binary polyhedral group]]\n*[[binary cyclic group]]\n*[[binary tetrahedral group]]\n*[[binary octahedral group]]\n*[[binary icosahedral group]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | authorlink = Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter | last = Coxeter | first = H.

A dual quaternion can be represented in the form {{nowrap|''p'' + ε ''q''}}, where ''p'' and ''q'' are ordinary quaternions and ε is the dual unit (which satisfies {{nowrap|1=εε = 0}}) and commutes with every element of the algebra.  Unlike quaternions, they do not form a [[division ring]].\n\nIn [[mechanics]], the dual quaternions are applied as a [[number system]] to represent [[rigid transformation]]s in three dimensions.<ref>A.T.

Because rigid transformations have six real degrees of freedom, dual quaternions include two algebraic constraints for this application.\n\nSimilar to the way that rotations in 3D space can be represented by quaternions of unit length, rigid motions in 3D space can be represented by dual quaternions of unit length.

Hamilton's product rule for ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' is often written as\n:<math> i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1 .</math>\nCompute {{nowrap|''i'' ( ''i j k'' ) {{=}} −''j k'' {{=}} −''i''}}, to obtain {{nowrap|''j k'' {{=}} ''i''}}, and {{nowrap|( ''i j k'' ) ''k'' {{=}} −''i j'' {{=}} −''k''}} or {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} ''k''}}. Now because {{nowrap|''j'' ( ''j k'' ) {{=}} ''j i'' {{=}} −''k''}}, we see that this product yields {{nowrap|''i j'' {{=}} −''j i''}}, which links quaternions to the properties of determinants.\n\nA convenient way to work with the quaternion product is to write a quaternion as the sum of a scalar and a vector, that is {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + '''A'''}}, where ''a''<sub>0</sub> is a real number and {{nowrap|'''A''' {{=}} ''A''<sub>1</sub> ''i'' + ''A''<sub>2</sub> ''j'' + ''A''<sub>3</sub> ''k''}} is a three dimensional vector.  The vector dot and cross operations can now be used to define the quaternion product of {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ''a''<sub>0</sub> + '''A'''}} and {{nowrap|''C'' {{=}} ''c''<sub>0</sub> + '''C'''}} as\n<!--reformatted this equation\n:G = AC = (a<sub>0</sub>+'''A''')(c<sub>0</sub>+'''C''') = (a<sub>0</sub>c<sub>0</sub> − '''A'''·'''C''') + (c<sub>0</sub>'''A''' + a<sub>0</sub>'''C''' + '''A'''×'''C''').\n-->\n:<math> G = AC = (a_0 + \\mathbf{A})(c_0 + \\mathbf{C}) = (a_0 c_0 - \\mathbf{A}\\cdot \\mathbf{C}) + (c_0 \\mathbf{A} + a_0 \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{A}\\times\\mathbf{C}).</math>\n\nA dual quaternion is usually described as a quaternion with dual numbers as coefficients.  A [[dual number]] is an ordered pair {{nowrap|''â'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}}.  Two dual numbers add componentwise and multiply by the rule {{nowrap|''â ĉ'' {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' ) ( ''c'', ''d'' ) {{=}} (''a c'', ''a d'' + ''b c'')}}.  Dual numbers are often written in the form {{nowrap|''â'' {{=}} ''a'' + ε''b''}}, where ε is the dual unit that commutes with ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' and has the property {{nowrap|ε<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 0}}.\n\nThe result is that a dual quaternion is the ordered pair of quaternions {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ( ''A'', ''B'' )}}.  Two dual quaternions add componentwise and multiply by the rule,\n<!-- reformatted this equation\n:ÂĈ = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).\n-->\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{C} = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC).</math>\nIt is convenient to write a dual quaternion as the sum of a dual scalar and a dual vector, {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ''â''<sub>0</sub> + ''A''}}, where {{nowrap|''â''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ( ''a'', ''b'' )}} and {{nowrap|''A'' {{=}} ( '''A''', '''B''' )}} is the dual vector that defines a [[screw theory|screw]].

In particular, if {{nowrap|''Â'' {{=}} ''â''<sub>0</sub> + ''A''}}, then\n:<math> \\mbox{Sc}(\\hat{A}) = \\hat{a}_0, \\mbox{Vec}(\\hat{A}) = \\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\nThis allows the definition of the conjugate of ''Â'' as\n:<math> \\hat{A}^* = \\mbox{Sc}(\\hat{A}) - \\mbox{Vec}(\\hat{A}).\\!</math>\nor, \n:<math> (\\hat{a}_0+\\mathsf{A})^* = \\hat{a}_0 - \\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\n\nThe product of a dual quaternion with its conjugate yields\n:<math>\\hat{A}\\hat{A}^* = (\\hat{a}_0+\\mathsf{A})(\\hat{a}_0 - \\mathsf{A}) = \\hat{a}_0^2 + \\mathsf{A}\\cdot\\mathsf{A}.\\!</math>\nThis is a dual scalar which is the ''magnitude squared'' of the dual quaternion.\n\n===Dual Number Conjugate===\n\nA second type of conjugate of a dual quaternion is given by taking the dual number conjugate, given by\n:<math> \\overline{\\hat{A}} = (A, -B) = A - \\epsilon B. \\!</math>\n\nThe quaternion and dual number conjugates can be combined into a third form of conjugate given by\n:<math> \\overline{\\hat{A}^*} = (A^*, -B^*) = A^* - \\epsilon B^*. \\!</math>\n\nIn the context of dual quaternions, the term \"conjugate\" can be used to mean the quaternion conjugate, dual number conjugate, or both.\n\n=== Norm ===\nThe ''norm'' of a dual quaternion {{abs|''Â''}} is computed using the conjugate to compute {{nowrap|{{abs|''Â''}} {{=}} {{radic|''Â Â''<sup>*</sup>}}}}.  This is a dual number called the ''magnitude'' of the dual quaternion.  Dual quaternions with {{nowrap|{{abs|''Â''}} {{=}} 1}} are ''unit dual quaternions''.\n\nDual quaternions of magnitude 1 are used to represent spatial Euclidean displacements. Notice that the requirement that {{nowrap|''Â Â''<sup>*</sup>}} {{=}} 1, introduces two algebraic constraints on the components of ''Â'', that is\n:<math> \\hat{A}\\hat{A}^* = (A, B)(A^*, B^*) = (AA^*, AB^* + BA^*) = (1, 0).\\!</math>\n\n=== Inverse ===\nIf {{nowrap|''p'' + ε ''q''}} is a dual quaternion, and ''p'' is not zero, then the inverse dual quaternion is given by \n:''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup> (1 &minus; ε ''q'' ''p''<sup>&minus;1</sup>).\nThus the elements of the subspace {{nowrap|{ ε q : q ∈ H } }} do not have inverses. This subspace is called an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in ring theory. It happens to be the unique [[maximal ideal]] of the ring of dual numbers.\n\nThe [[group of units]] of the dual number ring then consists of numbers not in the ideal. The dual numbers form a [[local ring]] since there is a unique maximal ideal. The group of units is a [[Lie group]] and can be studied using the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential mapping]]. Dual quaternions have been used to exhibit transformations in the [[Euclidean group]]. A typical element can be written as a [[screw theory#Homography|screw transformation]].\n\n== Dual quaternions and spatial displacements ==\nA benefit of the dual quaternion formulation of the composition of two spatial displacements D<sub>B</sub>=([R<sub>B</sub>], '''b''') and D<sub>A</sub>=([R<sub>A</sub>],'''a''') is that the resulting dual quaternion yields directly the [[screw axis]] and dual angle of the composite displacement D<sub>C</sub>=D<sub>B</sub>D<sub>A</sub>.\n\nIn general, the dual quaternion associated with a spatial displacement D = ([A],'''d''') is constructed from its [[screw axis]] S=('''S''', '''V''') and the dual angle (φ, d) where φ is the rotation about and d the slide along this axis, which defines the displacement D.  The associated dual quaternion is given by,\n:<math> \\hat{S} = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}}{2} + \\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\phi}}{2} \\mathsf{S}. </math>\n\nLet the composition of the displacement D<sub>B</sub> with D<sub>A</sub> be the displacement D<sub>C</sub>=D<sub>B</sub>D<sub>A</sub>.  The screw axis and dual angle of D<sub>C</sub> is obtained from the product of the dual quaternions of D<sub>A</sub> and D<sub>B</sub>, given by\n:<math>\\hat{A}=\\cos(\\hat{\\alpha}/2)+ \\sin(\\hat{\\alpha}/2)\\mathsf{A}\\quad\n\\text{and}\\quad \\hat{B}=\\cos(\\hat{\\beta}/2)+ \\sin(\\hat{\\beta}/2)\\mathsf{B}.</math>\nThat is, the composite displacement D<sub>C</sub>=D<sub>B</sub>D<sub>A</sub> has the associated dual quaternion given by\n:<math> \\hat{C}  = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}\\mathsf{C}\n=\n\\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\mathsf{B}\\Big) \\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}+\n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}\\mathsf{A}\\Big).\n</math>\n\nExpand this product in order to obtain\n:<math>\n\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2}+\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} \\mathsf{C}  =\n\\Big(\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} - \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}\\Big)  +  \\Big(\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B} + \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2} \\mathsf{A} + \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\times \\mathsf{A}\\Big).\n</math>\n\nDivide both sides of this equation by the identity\n:<math> \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} = \\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\cos\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} - \n\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\sin\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}</math>\nto obtain\n:<math> \\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\gamma}}{2} \\mathsf{C}  = \\frac{\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\mathsf{B} + \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{A} + \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\times \\mathsf{A}}{1 - \n\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}}{2}\\tan\\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}}{2} \\mathsf{B}\\cdot \\mathsf{A}}.\n</math>\n\nThis is [[Olinde Rodrigues|Rodrigues]]' formula for the screw axis of a composite displacement defined in terms of the screw axes of the two displacements.  He derived this formula in 1840.<ref>Rodrigues, O. (1840), Des lois géométriques qui régissent les déplacements d’un système solide dans l’espace, et la variation des coordonnées provenant de ses déplacements considérés indépendamment des causes qui peuvent les produire, Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées de Liouville 5, 380–440.</ref>\n\nThe three screw axes A, B, and C form a [https://books.google.com/books?id=f8I4yGVi9ocC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA64#v=twopage&q&f=false spatial triangle] and the dual angles at these ''vertices'' between the common normals that form the sides of this triangle are directly related to the dual angles of the three spatial displacements.\n\n== Matrix form of dual quaternion multiplication ==\nThe matrix representation of the quaternion product is convenient for programming quaternion computations using matrix algebra, which is true for dual quaternion operations as well.\n\nThe quaternion product AC is a linear transformation by the operator A of the components of the quaternion C, therefore there is a matrix representation of A operating on the vector formed from the components of C.\n\nAssemble the components of the quaternion {{nowrap|1=C = c<sub>0</sub> + '''C'''}} into the array {{nowrap|1=C = (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>0</sub>)}}.  Notice that the components of the vector part of the quaternion are listed first and the scalar is listed last.  This is an arbitrary choice, but once this convention is selected we must abide by it.\n\nThe quaternion product AC can now be represented as the matrix product\n:<math> \nAC = [A^+] C =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_0 & -A_3 & A_2 & A_1 \\\\\nA_3 & a_0 & -A_1 & A_2 \\\\\n-A_2 & A_1 & a_0  & A_3 \\\\\n-A_1 & -A_2 & -A_3 & a_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} C_1 \\\\ C_2 \\\\ C_3 \\\\ c_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe product AC can also be viewed as an operation by C on the components of A, in which case we have\n:<math>\nAC = [C^-] A = \\begin{bmatrix}\nc_0 & C_3 & -C_2 & C_1 \\\\\n-C_3 & c_0 & C_1 & C_2 \\\\\nC_2 & -C_1 & c_0  & C_3 \\\\\n-C_1 & -C_2 & -C_3 & c_0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{Bmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ A_3 \\\\ a_0 \\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe dual quaternion product ÂĈ = (A, B)(C, D) = (AC, AD+BC) can be formulated as a matrix operation as follows.  Assemble the components of Ĉ into the eight dimensional array Ĉ = (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, c<sub>0</sub>, D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, d<sub>0</sub>), then ÂĈ is given by the 8x8 matrix product\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{A}^+]\\hat{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} A^+ & 0 \\\\ B^+ & A^+ \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} C \\\\ D\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nAs we saw for quaternions, the product ÂĈ can be viewed as the operation of Ĉ on the coordinate vector Â, which means ÂĈ can also be formulated as,\n:<math>\n\\hat{A}\\hat{C} = [\\hat{C}^-]\\hat{A} = \\begin{bmatrix} C^- & 0 \\\\ D^- & C^- \\end{bmatrix}\\begin{Bmatrix} A \\\\ B\\end{Bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\n== More on spatial displacements ==\nThe dual quaternion of a displacement D=([A], '''d''') can be constructed from the quaternion S=cos(φ/2) + sin(φ/2)'''S''' that defines the rotation [A] and the vector quaternion constructed from the translation vector '''d''', given by D = d<sub>1</sub>i + d<sub>2</sub>j + d<sub>3</sub>k.   Using this notation, the dual quaternion for the displacement D=([A], '''d''') is given by\n:<math> \\hat{S} = S + \\varepsilon \\frac{1}{2}DS. </math>\n\nLet the Plücker coordinates of a line in the direction '''x''' through a point '''p''' in a moving body and its coordinates in the fixed frame which is in the direction '''X''' through the point '''P''' be given by,\n:<math>\\hat{x}=\\mathbf{x} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{p}\\times\\mathbf{x}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\\hat{X}=\\mathbf{X} + \\varepsilon \\mathbf{P}\\times\\mathbf{X}.</math>\nThen the dual quaternion of the displacement of this body transforms Plücker coordinates in the moving frame to Plücker coordinates in the fixed frame by the formula\n:<math>\\hat{X} = \\hat{S}\\hat{x}\\overline{\\hat{S}^*}.</math>\n\nUsing the matrix form of the dual quaternion product this becomes,\n:<math>\\hat{X} =[\\hat{S}^+][\\hat{S}^-]^*\\hat{x}.</math>\nThis calculation is easily managed using matrix operations.\n\n== Dual quaternions and 4×4 homogeneous transforms ==\nIt might be helpful, especially in rigid body motion, to represent dual quaternions as [[homogeneous transformation matrix|homogeneous matrices]]. As given above a dual quaternion can be written as: <math>\\hat q = r + d\\varepsilon</math> where ''r'' and ''d'' are both quaternions. The ''r'' quaternion is known as the real or rotational part and the <math>d</math> quaternion is known as the dual or displacement part.  \n\nThe rotation part can be given by\n:<math>r = r_w + r_xi + r_yj + r_zk = \\cos \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) + \\sin \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{2} \\right) \\left( \\vec{a} \\cdot (i, j, k) \\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle of rotation about the direction given by unit vector <math>\\vec{a}</math>. The displacement part can be written as \n\n:<math>d = 0 + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}i + \\frac{\\Delta y}{2}j + \\frac{\\Delta z}{2}k</math>.\n\nThe dual-quaternion equivalent of a 3D-vector is\n\n:<math>\\hat v := 1 + \\varepsilon (v_x i + v_y j + v_z k)</math>\n\nand its transformation by <math>\\hat q</math> is given by<ref>[https://www.cs.utah.edu/~ladislav/kavan06dual/kavan06dual.pdf Dual Quaternions for Rigid Transformation Blending], p. 4.</ref>\n:<math>\\hat{v}' = \\hat q \\cdot \\hat v \\cdot \\overline{\\hat q^*}</math>.\n\nThese dual quaternions (or actually their transformations on 3D-vectors) can be represented by the homogeneous transformation matrix\n:<math> T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 &  \\\\\n\\Delta x  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\Delta y  &   & R &  \\\\\n\\Delta z  &   &   &  \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nwhere the 3×3 [[orthogonal matrix]] is given by\n:<math>R =\\begin{pmatrix}\nr_w^2+r_x^2-r_y^2-r_z^2   &2r_xr_y-2r_wr_z           &2r_xr_z+2r_wr_y        \\\\\n2r_xr_y+2r_wr_z           &r_w^2-r_x^2+r_y^2-r_z^2 &2r_yr_z-2r_wr_x        \\\\\n2r_xr_z-2r_wr_y           &2r_yr_z+2r_wr_x         &r_w^2-r_x^2-r_y^2+r_z^2\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nFor the 3D-vector\n:<math> v = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\nv_x \\\\\nv_y \\\\\nv_z \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nthe transformation by T is given by\n\n:<math>\\vec{v}' =  T \\cdot  \\vec{v}</math>\n\n==Eponyms==\nSince both  [[Eduard Study]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] used and wrote about dual quaternions, at times authors refer to dual quaternions as \"Study biquaternions\" or \"Clifford biquaternions\". The latter [[eponym]] has also been used to refer to [[split-biquaternion]]s. Read the article by Joe Rooney linked below for view of a supporter of W.K. Clifford’s claim. Since the claims of Clifford and Study are in contention, it is convenient to use the current designation ''dual quaternion'' to avoid conflict.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Screw theory]]\n* [[Rational motion]]\n* [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n* [[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n* [[Olinde Rodrigues]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* A.T.

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], a '''[[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]] quaternion''' (or '''[[Adolf Hurwitz|Hurwitz]] integer''') is a [[quaternion]] whose components are ''either'' all [[integer]]s ''or'' all [[half-integer]]s (halves of an odd integer; a mixture of integers and half-integers is excluded). The set of all Hurwitz quaternions is\n\n:<math>H = \\left\\{a+bi+cj+dk \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\;\\mbox{ or }\\, a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThat is, either ''a,b,c,d'' are all integers, or they are all half-integers.\n''H'' is closed under quaternion multiplication and addition, which makes it a [[subring]] of the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of all quaternions '''H'''. Hurwitz quaternions were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Hurwitz|authorlink=Adolf Hurwitz|year=1919}}.\n\nA '''Lipschitz quaternion''' (or '''Lipschitz integer''') is a quaternion whose components are all [[integer]]s. The set of all Lipschitz quaternions\n\n:<math>L = \\left\\{a+bi+cj+dk \\in \\mathbb{H} \\mid a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}</math>\n\nforms a subring of the Hurwitz quaternions ''H''. Hurwitz integers have the advantage over Lipschitz integers that it is possible to perform [[Euclidean division]] on them, obtaining a small remainder.\n\n==Structure of the ring of Hurwitz quaternions==\n\nAs an additive [[group (mathematics)|group]], ''H'' is [[free abelian group|free abelian]] with generators {{nowrap|{(1 + ''i'' + ''j'' + ''k'')/2, ''i'', ''j'', ''k''}.}} It therefore forms a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] in '''R'''<sup>4</sup>. This lattice is known as the [[F4 lattice|''F''<sub>4</sub> lattice]] since it is the [[root lattice]] of the [[semisimple Lie algebra]] [[F4 (mathematics)|''F''<sub>4</sub>]]. The Lipschitz quaternions ''L'' form an index 2 sublattice of ''H''.\n\nThe [[group of units]] in ''L'' is the order 8 [[quaternion group]] {{nowrap|1=''Q'' = {±1, ±''i'', ±''j'', ±''k''}.}} The [[group of units]] in ''H'' is a nonabelian group of order 24 known as the [[binary tetrahedral group]]. The elements of this group include the 8 elements of ''Q'' along with the 16 quaternions {{nowrap|{(±1 ± ''i'' ± ''j'' ± ''k'')/2},}} where signs may be taken in any combination. The quaternion group is a [[normal subgroup]] of the binary tetrahedral group U(''H''). The elements of U(''H''), which all have norm 1, form the vertices of the [[24-cell]] inscribed in the [[3-sphere]].\n\nThe Hurwitz quaternions form an [[order (ring theory)|order]] (in the sense of [[ring theory]]) in the [[division ring]] of quaternions with [[rational number|rational]] components. It is in fact a [[maximal order]]; this accounts for its importance. The Lipschitz quaternions, which are the more obvious candidate for the idea of an ''integral quaternion'', also form an order. However, this latter order is not a maximal one, and therefore (as it turns out) less suitable for developing a theory of [[left ideal]]s comparable to that of [[algebraic number theory]]. What [[Adolf Hurwitz]] realised, therefore, was that this definition of Hurwitz integral quaternion is the better one to operate with. For a non-commutative ring such as '''H''', maximal orders need not be unique, so one needs to fix a maximal order, in carrying over the concept of an [[algebraic integer]].\n\n==The lattice of Hurwitz quaternions==\n\nThe [[field norm|(arithmetic, or field) norm]] of a Hurwitz quaternion, given by <math>a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2</math>, is always an integer. By a [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|theorem of Lagrange]] every nonnegative integer can be written as a sum of at most four [[square (algebra)|squares]]. Thus, every nonnegative integer is the norm of some Lipschitz (or Hurwitz) quaternion. More precisely, \nthe number ''c''(''n'') of Hurwitz quaternions of given positive norm ''n'' is 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of ''n''. The generating function of the numbers ''c''(''n'') is given by the level 2 weight 2 modular form\n:<math>2E_2(2\\tau)-E_2(\\tau) = \\sum_nc(n)q^n = 1+24q+24q^2+96q^3+24q^4+ 144q^5+\\cdots</math>   {{oeis|A004011}}\nwhere \n:<math>q=e^{2\\pi i \\tau}</math>\nand\n:<math>E_2(\\tau) = 1-24\\sum_n\\sigma_1(n)q^n</math>\nis the weight 2 level 1 Eisenstein series (which is a [[quasimodular form]]) and σ<sub>1</sub>(''n'') is the sum of the divisors of ''n''.\n\n==Factorization into irreducible elements==\n\nA Hurwitz integer is called irreducible if it is not 0 or a unit and is not a product of non-units. \nA Hurwitz integer is irreducible if and only if its norm is a [[prime number]]. The irreducible quaternions are sometimes called prime quaternions, but this can be misleading as they are not [[prime element|primes]] in the usual sense of commutative algebra: it is possible for an irreducible quaternion to divide a product ''ab'' without dividing either ''a'' or ''b''. Every Hurwitz quaternion can be factored as a product of irreducible quaternions. This factorization is not in general unique, even up to units and order, because a positive odd prime ''p'' can be written in 24(''p''+1)  ways as a product of two irreducible Hurwitz quaternions of norm ''p'', and for large ''p'' these cannot all be equivalent under left and right multiplication by units as there are only 24 units. However, if one excludes this case then there is a version of unique factorization. More precisely, every Hurwitz quaternion can be written uniquely as the product of a positive integer and a primitive quaternion (a Hurwitz quaternion not divisible by any integer greater than 1). The factorization of a primitive quaternion into irreducibles is unique up to order and units in the following sense: if \n:''p''<sub>0</sub>''p''<sub>1</sub>...''p''<sub>''n''</sub>\nand \n:''q''<sub>0</sub>''q''<sub>1</sub>...''q''<sub>''n''</sub>\nare two factorizations of some primitive Hurwitz quaternion into irreducible quaternions where ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> has the same norm as ''q''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'', then \n:''q''<sub>0</sub> = ''p''<sub>0</sub>''u''<sub>1</sub>\n:''q''<sub>1</sub> = ''u''{{su|b=1|p=–1}}''p''<sub>1</sub>''u''<sub>2</sub>\n: ...\n:''q''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''u''{{su|b=''n''|p=–1}}''p''<sub>''n''</sub>\nfor some units ''u''<sub>''k''</sub>.\n\n==Division with remainder==\nThe ordinary real integers and the [[Gaussian integers]] allow a division with remainder or [[Euclidean division]].\nFor positive integers N and D, there is always a quotient Q and a nonnegative remainder R such that\n* N = QD + R where R < D.\nFor complex or Gaussian integers N = a + ib and D = c + id, with the norm N(D) > 0, there always exist Q = p + iq and R = r + is such that\n* N = QD + R, where N(R) < N(D).\nHowever, for Lipschitz integers N = (a, b, c, d) and D = (e, f, g, h) it can happen that N(R) = N(D). This motivated a switch to Hurwitz integers, for which the condition N(R) < N(D) is guaranteed.<ref>John Horton Conway, Derek Alan Smith (2003), On quaternions and octonions: their geometry, arithmetic, and symmetry, A K Peters Ltd., page 56, {{ISBN|978-1-56881-134-5}}</ref>\n\nMany algorithms depend on division with remainder, for example, [[Euclidean algorithm|Euclid's algorithm]] for the greatest common divisor.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gaussian integer]]\n* [[Eisenstein integer]]\n* The [[icosians]]\n* The Lie group [[F4 (mathematics)|F<sub>4</sub>]]\n* The [[E8 lattice|E<sub>8</sub> lattice]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*John Horton Conway, Derek Alan Smith (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=E_HCwwxMbfMC On quaternions and octonions: their geometry, arithmetic, and symmetry], A K Peters Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-56881-134-5}}\n*{{citation|last=Hurwitz|first= A.\n|title=Vorlesungen über die Zahlentheorie der Quaternionen|jfm= 47.0106.01\n|place=Berlin|publisher= J.

      "text": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=November 2013}}\n{{unreferenced|date=November 2013}}\n}}\n\nIn [[differential geometry]], a '''hyperkähler manifold''' is a [[Riemannian manifold]] of dimension <math>4k</math> and [[holonomy group]] contained in [[Symplectic group|Sp(''k'')]] (here Sp(''k'') denotes a compact form of a [[symplectic group]], identified with the group of quaternionic-linear unitary endomorphisms of a <math>k</math>-dimensional quaternionic Hermitian space). Hyperkähler manifolds are special classes of [[Kähler manifold]]s. They can be thought of as [[quaternion]]ic analogues of Kähler manifolds. All hyperkähler manifolds are [[Ricci-flat]] and are thus [[Calabi–Yau]] manifolds (this can be easily seen by noting that [[Symplectic group|Sp(''k'')]] is a [[subgroup]] of the [[special unitary group]] SU(2''k'')).\n\nHyperkähler manifolds were defined by [[Eugenio Calabi]] in 1978.\n\n==Quaternionic structure==\nEvery hyperkähler manifold ''M'' has a [[sphere|2-sphere]] of complex structures (i.e.  [[almost complex structure|integrable almost complex structures]]) with respect to which the [[metric tensor|metric]] is Kähler.\n\nIn particular, it is a [[hypercomplex manifold]], meaning that there are three distinct complex structures, ''I'', ''J,'' and ''K,'' which satisfy the [[quaternions|quaternion relations]]\n\n:<math>I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1.\\,</math>\n\nAny linear combination\n\n:<math>aI + bJ + cK \\, </math>\n\nwith <math>a, b, c</math> real numbers such that\n\n:<math>a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 1 \\, </math>\n\nis also a complex structure on ''M''. In particular, the tangent space ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' is a quaternionic vector space for each point ''x'' of ''M''. Sp(''k'') can be considered as the group of orthogonal transformations of <math>\\mathbb{R}^{4k}=\\mathbb{H}^k</math> which are linear with respect to ''I'', ''J'' and ''K''. From this it follows that the holonomy of the manifold is contained in Sp(''k''). Conversely, if the holonomy group of the Riemannian manifold ''M'' is contained in Sp(''k''), choose complex structures ''I''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''J<sub>x</sub>'' and ''K''<sub>''x''</sub> on ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' which make ''T''<sub>''x''</sub>''M'' into a quaternionic vector space. [[Parallel transport]] of these complex structures gives the required quaternionic structure on ''M''.\n\n==Holomorphic symplectic form==\nA hyperkähler manifold ''(M,I,J,K)'', considered as a complex manifold (''M'',''I''), is holomorphically symplectic (equipped with a holomorphic, non-degenerate 2-form). The converse is also true in the case of compact manifolds, due to [[Shing-Tung Yau]]'s proof of the [[Calabi conjecture]]: Given a compact, Kähler, holomorphically symplectic manifold (''M'',''I''), it is always equipped with a compatible hyperkähler metric. Such a metric is unique in a given Kähler class. Compact hyperkähler manifolds have been extensively studied using techniques from [[algebraic geometry]], sometimes under a name ''holomorphically symplectic manifolds''.  The holonomy group of any Calabi-Yau metric on a simply connected \ncompact holomorphically symplectic manifold <math></math>  with <math>H^{2,0}(M)=1</math> is exactly Sp(''k''); and if the simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold instead has <math>H^{2,0}(M)\\geq 2</math>,  it is just the Riemannian product of\nlower-dimensional hyperkähler manifolds. This fact immediately follows from the Bochner formula for holomorphic forms\non a Kähler manifold, together  the Berger classification of holonomy groups; ironically, it is often attributed to Bogomolov, who incorrectly went on to claim in the same paper that compact hyperkähler manifolds actually do not exist!\n\n==Examples==\nDue to [[Kunihiko Kodaira]]'s classification of complex surfaces, we know\nthat any [[compact space|compact]] hyperkähler 4-manifold is either a [[K3 surface]] or a compact torus <math>T^4</math>.  \n(Every [[Calabi–Yau manifold]] in 4 (real) dimensions is a hyperkähler manifold, because [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] is isomorphic to [[Symplectic group|Sp(1)]].)\n\nAs was discovered by Beauville, the [[Hilbert scheme]] of  k points on a compact hyperkähler 4-manifold is a hyperkähler\nmanifold of dimension 4k.  This gives rise to two series of compact examples: Hilbert schemes of points on a K3 surface and [[Hilbert scheme|generalized Kummer varieties]].\n\nNon-compact, complete, hyperkähler 4-manifolds which are asymptotic to '''H'''/''G'', where '''H''' denotes the [[quaternion]]s and ''G'' is a finite [[subgroup]] of Sp(1), are known as [[asymptotically locally Euclidean]], or ALE, spaces. These spaces, and various generalizations involving different asymptotic behaviors, are studied in [[physics]] under the name [[gravitational instanton]]s. The [[Gibbons–Hawking ansatz]] gives examples invariant under a circle action.\n\nMany examples of noncompact hyperkähler manifolds arise as moduli spaces of solutions to certain gauge theory equations which arise from the dimensional reduction of the anti-self dual [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills equations]]: \ninstanton moduli spaces, monopole moduli spaces, spaces of solutions to [[Nigel Hitchin]]'s self-duality equations on [[Riemann surface]]s, space of solutions to [[Nahm equations]]. Another class of examples are the [[Quiver (mathematics)#Representations of quivers|Nakajima quiver varieties]], which are of great importance in representation theory.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quaternion-Kähler manifold]]\n*[[Hypercomplex manifold]]\n*[[Quaternionic manifold]]\n*[[Calabi–Yau manifold]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{citation|first1=Maciej|last1=Dunajski|first2=Lionel J.|last2=Mason|arxiv=math/0001008|title=Hyper-Kähler hierarchies and their twistor theory|journal=[[Communications in Mathematical Physics]]| volume=213 |year=2000|issue=3|pages=641–672|doi=10.1007/PL00005532|mr=1785432|bibcode=2000CMaPh.213..641D}}\n* Kieran G.

These 120 vectors form the [[H4 (mathematics)|H4 root system]], with a [[Weyl group]] of order 14400. In addition to the 120 unit icosians forming the vertices of a 600-cell, the 600 icosians of norm 2 form the vertices of a [[120-cell]]. Other subgroups of icosians correspond to the [[tesseract]], [[16-cell]] and [[24-cell]].\n\n==Icosian ring==\nThe icosians lie in the ''golden field'', (''a''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''b''{{radic|5}})&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''c''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''d''{{radic|5}})'''i'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''e''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''f''{{radic|5}})'''j'''&nbsp;+&nbsp;(''g''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''h''{{radic|5}})'''k''', where the eight variables are [[rational number]]s.

Its Euclidean norm is defined as ''u''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''v'' if the quaternion norm is ''u''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''v''{{radic|5}}.  This Euclidean norm defines a quadratic form on ''L'', under which the lattice is isomorphic to the [[E8 lattice]].\n\nThis construction shows that the Coxeter group <math>H_4</math> embeds as a subgroup of <math>E_8</math>.

The proof for this property is not difficult, since the number of irreducible characters of Q<sub>8</sub> is equal to the number of its conjugacy classes, which is five ( { e }, { {{overline|e}} }, { i, {{overline|i}} }, { j, {{overline|j}} }, { k, {{overline|k}} } ).\n\nThese five representations are as follows:\n\n'''Trivial representation'''\n\n'''Sign representations with i,j,k-kernel''': Q<sub>8</sub> has three maximal normal subgroups: the cyclic subgroups generated by  i, j, and k respectively. For each maximal normal subgroup, we obtain a one-dimensional representation with that subgroup as kernel. The representation sends elements inside the subgroup to 1, and elements outside the subgroup to -1.\n\n'''2-dimensional representation''': A representation :<math>\\mathrm{Q}_8 = \\{e, \\bar{e}, i, \\bar{i}, j, \\bar{j}, k, \\bar{k}\\} \\to \\mathrm{GL}_{2}(\\mathbf{C})</math> is given below in the Matrix representations section.\n\nSo the character table of the quaternion group Q<sub>8</sub>, which turns out to be the same as the character table of the dihedral group D<sub>4</sub>, is: \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Note that this is not quite the same as the [[group algebra]] on Q<sub>8</sub> (which would be eight-dimensional). Conversely, one can start with the quaternions and ''define'' the quaternion group as the multiplicative subgroup consisting of the eight elements {{nowrap|{1, &minus;1, ''i'', &minus;''i'', ''j'', &minus;''j'', ''k'', &minus;''k''}.}} The complex four-dimensional vector space on the same basis is called the algebra of [[biquaternion]]s.\n\nNote that i, j, and k all have [[order (group theory)|order]] four in Q<sub>8</sub> and any two of them generate the entire group.

The [[inner automorphism group]] of Q<sub>8</sub> is isomorphic to Q<sub>8</sub> modulo its center, and is therefore also isomorphic to the Klein four-group. The full [[automorphism group]] of Q<sub>8</sub> is [[isomorphic]] to the [[symmetric group]] of degree 4, S<sub>4</sub>, the [[symmetric group]] on four letters. The [[outer automorphism group]] of Q<sub>8</sub> is then S<sub>4</sub>/V which is isomorphic to S<sub>3</sub>.\n\n== Matrix representations ==\n[[File:Quaternion group; Cayley table; subgroup of SL(2,C).svg|thumb|Quaternion group as a subgroup of [[Special linear group|SL]](2,[[Complex number|'''C''']])]]\nThe quaternion group can be [[group representation|represented]] as a subgroup of the [[general linear group]] GL<sub>2</sub>('''C''').

      "text": "In [[mathematics]], '''quaternionic analysis''' is the study of functions with [[quaternion]]s as the domain and/or range. Such functions can be called '''functions of a quaternion variable''' just as functions of a [[Function of a real variable|real variable]] or a [[complex variable]] are called.\n\nAs with complex and real analysis, it is possible to study the concepts of [[analytic function|analyticity]], [[holomorphic function|holomorphy]], [[harmonic function|harmonicity]] and [[conformality]] in the context of quaternions. Unlike the complex numbers and like the reals, the four notions do not coincide.\n\n==Properties==\nThe [[projection (linear algebra)|projections]] of a quaternion onto its scalar part or onto its vector part, as well as the modulus and [[versor]] functions, are examples that are basic to understanding quaternion structure.\n\nAn important example of a function of a quaternion variable is\n:<math>f_1(q) = u q u^{-1}</math>\nwhich [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotates the vector part of ''q'']] by twice the angle represented by ''u''.\n\nThe quaternion [[multiplicative inverse]] <math>f_2(q) = q^{-1}</math> is another fundamental function, but as with other number systems, <math>f_2(0)</math> and related problems are generally discluded due to the nature of [[dividing by zero]].\n\n[[Affine transformation]]s of quaternions have the form\n:<math>f_3(q) = aq + b, \\quad a, b, q \\in \\mathbb{H}.</math>\n[[Linear fractional transformation]]s of quaternions can be represented by elements of the [[matrix ring]] <math>M_2(\\mathbb{H})</math> operating on the [[projective line over a ring|projective line over <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>]]. For instance, the mappings <math>q \\mapsto u q v,</math> where <math>u</math> and <math>v</math> are fixed [[versor]]s serve to produce the [[elliptic geometry#elliptic space|motions of elliptic space]].\n\nQuaternion variable theory differs in some respects from complex variable theory. For example: The [[complex conjugate]] mapping of the complex plane is a central tool but requires the introduction of a non-arithmetic, [[Holomorphic function|non-analytic]] operation. Indeed, conjugation changes the [[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]] of plane figures, something that arithmetic functions do not change.\n\nIn contrast to the [[complex conjugate]], the quaternion conjugation can be expressed arithmetically, as <math>f_4(q) = - \\tfrac{1}{2} (q + iqi + jqj + kqk)</math>\n\nThis equation can be proven, starting with the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {1, i, j, k}:\n:<math>f_4(1) = -\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 - 1 - 1 - 1) = 1, \\quad\nf_4(i) = -\\tfrac{1}{2}(i - i + i + i) = -i, \\quad\nf_4(j) = -j, \\quad\nf_4(k) = -k </math>.\nConsequently, since <math>f_4</math> is [[linear function|linear]],\n:<math>f_4(q) = f_4(w + x i + y j + z k) = w f_4(1) + x f_4(i) + y f_4(j) + z f_4(k) = w - x i - y j - z k = q^*.</math>\n\nThe success of [[complex analysis]] in providing a rich family of [[holomorphic function]]s for scientific work has engaged some workers in efforts to extend the planar theory, based on complex numbers, to a 4-space study with functions of a quaternion variable.<ref>{{harv|Fueter|1936}}</ref> These efforts were summarized in {{harvtxt|Deavours|1973}}.{{efn|{{harvtxt|Deavours|1973}} recalls a 1935 issue of ''[[Commentarii Mathematici Helvetici]]'' where an alternative theory of \"regular functions\" was initiated by {{harvtxt|Fueter|1936}} through the idea of [[Morera's theorem]]: quaternion function <math>F</math> is \"left regular at <math>q</math>\" when the integral of <math>F</math> vanishes over any sufficiently small [[hypersurface]] containing <math>q</math>. Then the analogue of [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]] holds: The only regular quaternion function with bounded norm in <math>\\mathbb{E}^4</math> is a constant. One approach to construct regular functions is to use [[power series]] with real coefficients. Deavours also gives analogues for the [[Poisson integral]], the [[Cauchy integral formula]], and the presentation of [[Maxwell’s equations]] of electromagnetism with quaternion functions.}}\n\nThough <math>\\mathbb{H}</math> [[quaternion#H as a union of complex planes|appears as a union of complex planes]], the following proposition shows that extending complex functions requires special care:\n\nLet <math>f_5(z) = u(x,y) + i v(x,y)</math> be a function of a complex variable, <math>z = x + i y</math>. Suppose also that <math>u</math> is an [[even function]] of <math>y</math> and that <math>v</math> is an [[odd function]] of <math>y</math>. Then <math>f_5(q) = u(x,y) + rv(x,y)</math> is an extension of <math>f_5</math> to a quaternion variable <math>q = x + yr</math> where <math>r^2 = -1</math> and <math>r \\in \\mathbb{H}</math>.\nThen, let <math>r^*</math> represent the conjugate of <math>r</math>, so that <math>q = x - yr^*</math>. The extension to <math>\\mathbb{H}</math> will be complete when it is shown that <math>f_5(q) = f_5(x - yr^*)</math>. Indeed, by hypothesis\n:<math>u(x,y) = u(x,-y), \\quad v(x,y) = -v(x,-y) \\quad</math> one obtains\n:<math>f_5(x - y r^*) = u(x,-y) + r^* v(x,-y) = u(x,y) + r v(x,y) = f_5(q).</math>\n\n==Homographies==\nThe [[quaternions and spatial rotation|rotation]] about axis ''r'' is a classical application of quaternions to [[space]] mapping.<ref>{{harv|Cayley|1848|loc=especially page 198}}</ref>\nIn terms of a [[Homography#Over a ring|homography]], the rotation is expressed\n:<math>U(q,1) \\begin{pmatrix}u & 0\\\\0 & u \\end{pmatrix} = U(qu,u) \\thicksim U(u^{-1}qu, 1) ,</math>\nwhere <math>u = \\exp(\\theta r) = \\cos \\theta + r \\sin \\theta</math> is a [[versor]]. If ''p'' * = &minus;''p'', then the translation <math>q \\mapsto q + p</math> is expressed by\n:<math>U(q,1)\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ p & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = U(q + p, 1).</math>\nRotation and translation ''xr'' along the axis of rotation is given by\n:<math>U(q,1)\\begin{pmatrix}u & 0 \\\\ uxr & u \\end{pmatrix} = U(qu + uxr, u) \\thicksim U(u^{-1}qu + xr, 1).</math>\nSuch a mapping is called a [[screw displacement]]. In classical [[kinematics]], [[Chasles' theorem (kinematics)|Chasles' theorem]] states that any rigid body motion can be displayed as a screw displacement. Just as the representation of a [[Euclidean plane isometry]] as a rotation is a matter of complex number arithmetic, so Chasles' theorem, and the [[screw axis]] required, is a matter of quaternion arithmetic with homographies: Let ''s'' be a right versor, or square root of minus one, perpendicular to ''r'', with ''t'' = ''rs''.\n\nConsider the axis passing through ''s'' and parallel to ''r''. Rotation about it is expressed<ref>{{harv|Hamilton|1853|loc=§287 pp. 273,4}}</ref> by the homography composition\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ -s & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}u & 0 \\\\ 0 & u \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}1 & 0 \\\\ s & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}u & 0 \\\\ z & u \\end{pmatrix}, </math>\nwhere <math>z = u s - s u = \\sin \\theta (rs - sr) = 2 t \\sin \\theta .</math>\n\nNow in the (''s,t'')-plane the parameter &theta; traces out a circle <math>u^{-1} z = u^{-1}(2 t \\sin \\theta) = 2 \\sin \\theta ( t \\cos \\theta - s \\sin \\theta) </math> in the half-plane <math>\\lbrace wt + xs : x > 0 \\rbrace .</math> \n\nAny ''p'' in this half-plane lies on a ray from the origin through the circle <math>\\lbrace u^{-1} z : 0 < \\theta < \\pi \\rbrace</math> and can be written <math>p = a u^{-1} z , \\ \\ a > 0 .</math>\n\nThen up = az, with <math>\\begin{pmatrix}u & 0 \\\\ az & u \\end{pmatrix} </math> as the homography expressing [[conjugation (group theory)|conjugation]] of a rotation by a translation p.\n\n== Linear map ==\nThe map <math>f:\\mathbb H\\rightarrow \\mathbb H</math>\nof quaternion algebra is called linear, if following equalities hold\n: <math>f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)</math>\n: <math>f(ax)=af(x)</math>\n: <math>x,y\\in\\mathbb H, a\\in\\mathbb R</math>\nwhere <math>\\mathbb R</math> is real field.\nSince <math>f</math> is linear map of quaternion algebra,\nthen, for any <math>a, b\\in\\mathbb H</math>, the map\n: <math>(afb)(x)=af(x)b</math>\nis linear map.\nIf <math>f</math> is identity map (<math>f(x)=x</math>),\nthen, for any <math>a, b\\in\\mathbb H</math>,\nwe identify tensor product <math>a\\otimes b</math> and the map\n: <math>(a\\otimes b)\\circ x=axb</math>\nFor any linear map\n<math>f:\\mathbb H\\rightarrow \\mathbb H</math>\nthere exists a tensor <math>a\\in\\mathbb H\\otimes\\mathbb H</math>,\n<math>a=\\sum_s a_{s0}\\otimes a_{s1}</math>,\nsuch that\n: <math>f(x)=a\\circ x=(\\sum_s a_{s0}\\otimes a_{s1})\\circ x=\\sum_s a_{s0}xa_{s1}</math>\nSo we can identify the linear map <math>f</math>\nand the tensor <math>a</math>.\n\n== The derivative for quaternions ==\nSince the time of Hamilton, it has been realized that requiring the independence of the [[derivative]] from the path that a differential follows toward zero is too restrictive: it excludes even <math>f(q) = q^2</math> from differentiation.

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternionic_manifold",
      "text": "In [[differential geometry]], a '''quaternionic manifold''' is a [[quaternion]]ic analog of a [[complex manifold]]. The definition is more complicated and technical than the one for complex manifolds due in part to the [[noncommutative|noncommutativity]] of the quaternions and in part to the lack of a suitable calculus of [[holomorphic function]]s for quaternions. The most succinct definition uses the language of [[G-structure on a manifold|''G''-structures on a manifold]]. Specifically, a '''quaternionic ''n-''manifold''' can be defined as a [[smooth manifold]] of real dimension 4''n'' equipped with a torsion-free <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})\\cdot\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math>-structure. More naïve, but straightforward, definitions lead to a dearth of examples, and exclude spaces like [[quaternionic projective space]] which should clearly be considered as quaternionic manifolds.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===The enhanced quaternionic general linear group===\n\nIf we regard the [[quaternionic vector space]] <math>\\mathbb{H}^n\\cong\\R^{4n}</math> as a [[right module|right <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>-module]], we can identify the algebra of right <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>-linear maps with the algebra of <math>n\\times n</math> [[quaternionic matrix|quaternionic matrices]] acting on <math>\\mathbb{H}^n</math> ''from the left''. The invertible right <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>-linear maps then form a subgroup <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})</math> of <math>\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\R)</math>. We can enhance this group with the group <math>\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math> of nonzero quaternions acting by scalar multiplication on <math>\\mathbb{H}^n</math> ''from the right''. Since this scalar multiplication is <math>\\R</math>-linear (but ''not'' <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>-linear) we have another embedding of <math>\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math> into <math>\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\R)</math>. The group <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})\\cdot\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math> is then defined as the product of these subgroups in <math>\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\R)</math>. Since the intersection of the subgroups <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})</math> and <math>\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math> in <math>\\operatorname{GL}(4n, \\R)</math> is their mutual center <math>\\R^\\times</math> (the group of scalar matrices with nonzero real coefficients), we have the isomorphism\n:<math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})\\cdot\\mathbb{H}^\\times \\cong (\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})\\times\\mathbb{H}^\\times)/\\R^\\times.</math>\n\n===Almost quaternionic structure===\n\nAn '''almost quaternionic structure''' on a smooth manifold <math>M</math> is just a <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})\\cdot\\mathbb{H}^\\times</math>-structure on <math>M</math>. Equivalently, it can be defined as a [[subbundle]] <math>H</math> of the [[endomorphism bundle]] <math>\\operatorname{End}(TM)</math> such that each fiber <math>H_x</math> is isomorphic (as a [[algebra over a field|real algebra]]) to the [[quaternions|quaternion algebra]] <math>\\mathbb{H}</math>. The subbundle <math>H</math> is called the '''almost quaternionic structure bundle'''. A manifold equipped with an almost quaternionic structure is called an '''almost quaternionic manifold'''.\n\nThe quaternion structure bundle <math>H</math> naturally admits a [[bundle metric]] coming from the quaternionic algebra structure, and, with this metric, <math>H</math> splits into an orthogonal [[Whitney sum|direct sum]] of vector bundles\n<math>H = L\\oplus E</math>\nwhere <math>L</math> is the trivial line bundle through the identity operator, and <math>E</math> is a rank-3 vector bundle corresponding to the purely imaginary quaternions. Neither the bundles <math>H</math> or <math>E</math> are necessarily trivial.\n\nThe [[sphere bundle|unit sphere bundle]]\n<math>Z = S(E)</math>\ninside <math>E</math> corresponds to the pure unit imaginary quaternions. These are endomorphisms of the tangent spaces that square to −1. The bundle <math>Z</math> is called the '''twistor space''' of the manifold <math>M</math>, and its properties are described in more detail below. [[section (fiber bundle)|Local section]]s of <math>Z</math> are (locally defined) [[almost complex structure]]s. There exists a neighborhood <math>U</math> of every point <math>x</math> in an almost quaternionic manifold <math>M</math> with an entire [[2-sphere]] of almost complex structures defined on <math>U</math>. One can always find <math>I, J, K\\in\\Gamma(Z|_U)</math> such that \n:<math>I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1</math>\nNote, however, that none of these operators may be extendable to all of <math>M</math>. That is, the bundle <math>Z</math> may admit no ''global'' sections (e.g. this is the case with [[quaternionic projective space]] <math>\\mathbb{HP}^n</math>). This is in marked contrast to the situation for complex manifolds, which always have a globally defined almost complex structure.\n\n===Quaternionic structure===\n\nA '''quaternionic structure''' on a smooth manifold <math>M</math> is an almost quaternionic structure <math>Q</math> which admits a [[torsion tensor|torsion-free]] [[affine connection]] <math>\\nabla</math> preserving <math>Q</math>. Such a connection is never unique, and is not considered to be part of the quaternionic structure.  A '''quaternionic manifold''' is a smooth manifold <math>M</math> together with a quaternionic structure on <math>M</math>.\n\n==Special cases and additional structures==\n\n===Hypercomplex manifolds===\n\nA '''[[hypercomplex manifold]]''' is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})</math>-structure. The reduction of the structure group to <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbb{H})</math> is possible if and only if the almost quaternionic structure bundle <math>H\\subset \\operatorname{End}(TM)</math> is trivial (i.e. isomorphic to <math>M\\times\\mathbb{H}</math>). An almost hypercomplex structure corresponds to a global frame of <math>H</math>, or, equivalently, triple of almost complex structures <math>I, J</math>, and <math>K</math> such that\n:<math>I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = IJK = -1</math>\nA hypercomplex structure is an almost hypercomplex structure such that each of <math>I, J</math>, and <math>K</math> are integrable. \n\n===Quaternionic Kähler manifolds===\n\nA '''[[quaternionic Kähler manifold]]''' is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n)\\cdot\\operatorname{Sp}(1)</math>-structure.\n\n===Hyperkähler manifolds===\n\nA '''[[hyperkähler manifold]]''' is a quaternionic manifold with a torsion-free <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n)</math>-structure. A hyperkähler manifold is simultaneously a hypercomplex manifold and a quaternionic Kähler manifold.\n\n==Twistor space==\n\nGiven a quaternionic <math>n</math>-manifold <math>M</math>, the unit 2-sphere subbundle <math>Z=S(E)</math> corresponding to the pure unit imaginary quaternions (or almost complex structures) is called the '''twistor space''' of <math>M</math>. It turns out that, when <math>n\\ge 2</math>, there exists a natural [[complex manifold|complex structure]] on <math>Z</math> such that the fibers of the projection <math>Z\\to M</math> are isomorphic to <math>\\mathbb{CP}^1</math>. When <math>n=1</math>, the space <math>Z</math> admits a natural [[almost complex structure]], but this structure is integrable only if the manifold is [[self-dual manifold|self-dual]]. It turns out that the quaternionic geometry on <math>M</math> can be reconstructed entirely from holomorphic data on <math>Z</math>.\n\nThe twistor space theory gives a method of translating problems on quaternionic manifolds into problems on complex manifolds, which are much better understood, and amenable to methods from [[algebraic geometry]]. Unfortunately, the twistor space of a quaternionic manifold can be quite complicated, even for simple spaces like <math>\\mathbb{H}^n</math>.\n\n==References==\n\n*{{cite book | first = Arthur L. | last = Besse | title = Einstein Manifolds | year = 1987 | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin | isbn=3-540-15279-2}}\n*{{cite book | first = Dominic | last = Joyce | authorlink = Dominic Joyce | year = 2000 | title = Compact Manifolds with Special Holonomy | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn=0-19-850601-5}}\n\n[[Category:Manifolds]]\n[[Category:Structures on manifolds]]\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n[[Category:Quaternions]]"

Similarly to [[complex polytope]]s, points are not ordered and there is no sense of \"between\", and thus a quaternionic polytope may be understood as an arrangement of connected points, lines, planes and so on, where every point is the junction of multiple lines, every line of multiple planes, and so on.

It also follows from rational homotopy theory that <math>\\mathbb{HP}^n</math> has infinite homotopy groups only in dimensions 4 and <math>4n+3</math>.\n\n==Differential geometry==\n\n<math>\\mathbb{HP}^n</math> carries a natural [[Riemannian metric]] analogous to the [[Fubini-Study metric]] on <math>\\mathbb{CP}^n</math>, with respect to which it is a compact [[quaternion-Kähler symmetric space]] with positive curvature.\n\nQuaternionic projective space can be represented as the coset space\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{HP}^n = \\operatorname{Sp}(n+1)/\\operatorname{Sp}(n)\\times\\operatorname{Sp}(1)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\operatorname{Sp}(n)</math> is the compact [[symplectic group]].\n\n===Characteristic classes===\n\nSince <math>\\mathbb{HP}^1=S^4</math>, its tangent bundle is stably trivial. The tangent bundles of the rest have nontrivial [[Stiefel–Whitney class|Stiefel–Whitney]] and [[Pontryagin class]]es. The total classes are given by the following formula:\n\n:<math>w(\\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+u)^{n+1}</math>\n:<math>p(\\mathbb{HP}^n) = (1+v)^{2n+2} (1+4v)^{-1} </math>\n\nwhere <math>v</math> is the generator of <math>H^4(\\mathbb{HP}^n;\\Z)</math> and <math>u</math> is its reduction mod 2.<ref>Szczarba, R. H. (1964). On tangent bundles of fibre spaces and quotient spaces. American Journal of Mathematics, 86(4), 685-697.</ref>\n\n==Special cases==\n\n===Quaternionic projective line===\nThe one-dimensional projective space over <math>\\mathbb{H}</math> is called the \"projective line\" in generalization of the [[complex projective line]]. For example, it was used (implicitly) in 1947 by P. G. Gormley to extend the [[Möbius group]] to the quaternion context with [[linear fractional transformation]]s. For the linear fractional transformations of an associative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] with 1, see [[projective line over a ring]] and the homography group GL(2,''A'').\n\nFrom the topological point of view the quaternionic projective line is the 4-sphere, and in fact these are [[diffeomorphic]] manifolds. The fibration mentioned previously is from the 7-sphere, and is an example of a [[Hopf fibration]].\n\nExplicit expressions for coordinates for the 4-sphere can be found in the article on the [[Fubini–Study metric]].\n\n===Quaternionic projective plane===\nThe 8-dimensional <math>\\mathbb{HP}^{2}</math> has a [[circle action]], by the group of complex scalars of absolute value 1 acting on the other side (so on the right, as the convention for the action of ''c'' above is on the left). Therefore, the [[quotient manifold]]\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{HP}^{2}/\\mathrm{U}(1)</math>\n\nmay be taken, writing [[U(1)]] for the [[circle group]]. It has been shown that this quotient is the 7-[[sphere]], a result of [[Vladimir Arnold]] from 1996, later rediscovered by [[Edward Witten]] and [[Michael Atiyah]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[V.

When used to represent an [[Orientation (geometry)|orientation]] (rotation relative to a reference coordinate system), they are called '''orientation quaternions''' or '''attitude quaternions'''. The equation for spatial rotations can be summarized for {{mvar|&theta;}} radians about a unit axis <math>(X,Y,Z)</math> as the Quaternion <math>(C, X*S, Y*S, Z*S)</math> where <math>C = \\cos(\\theta/2)</math> and <math>S=\\sin(\\theta/2)</math>.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Using quaternion as rotations ==\n[[Image:Euler AxisAngle.png|thumb|right|A visualization of a rotation represented by an Euler axis and angle.]]\nIn 3-dimensional space, according to [[Euler's rotation theorem]], any rotation or sequence of rotations of a rigid body or coordinate system about a fixed point is equivalent to a single rotation by a given angle {{mvar|&theta;}} about a fixed axis (called the ''Euler axis'') that runs through the fixed point. The Euler axis is typically represented by a [[unit vector]]&nbsp;{{mvec|''u''}}. Therefore, any rotation in three dimensions can be represented as a combination of a vector&nbsp;{{mvec|''u''}}  and a scalar {{mvar|&theta;}}. Quaternions give a simple way to encode this [[axis–angle representation]] in four numbers, and can be used to apply the corresponding rotation to a [[Position (vector)|position vector]], representing a [[Point (geometry)|point]] relative to the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] in [[real coordinate space|'''R'''<sup>3</sup>]].\n\nA [[Euclidean vector]] such as {{math|(2, 3, 4)}} or {{math|(''a<sub>x</sub>'', ''a<sub>y</sub>'', ''a<sub>z</sub>'')}} can be rewritten as {{math|2 '''i''' + 3 '''j''' + 4 '''k'''}} or {{math|''a<sub>x</sub>'' '''i''' + ''a<sub>y</sub>'' '''j''' + ''a<sub>z</sub>'' '''k'''}}, where {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, {{math|'''k'''}} are unit vectors representing the three [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian axes]]. A rotation through an angle of {{mvar|&theta;}} around the axis defined by a unit vector\n: <math>\\vec{u} = (u_x, u_y, u_z) = u_x\\mathbf{i} + u_y\\mathbf{j} + u_z\\mathbf{k}</math>\ncan be represented by a quaternion. This can be done using an [[Pauli matrices|extension]] of [[Euler's formula]]:\n\n: <math> \\mathbf{q} = e^{\\frac{\\theta}{2}{(u_x\\mathbf{i} + u_y\\mathbf{j} + u_z\\mathbf{k})}} = \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} + (u_x\\mathbf{i} + u_y\\mathbf{j} + u_z\\mathbf{k}) \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2}</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the desired rotation can be applied to an ordinary vector <math>\\mathbf{p} = (p_x, p_y, p_z) = p_x\\mathbf{i} + p_y\\mathbf{j} + p_z\\mathbf{k}</math> in 3-dimensional space, considered as a quaternion with a real coordinate equal to zero, by evaluating the [[#The conjugation operation|conjugation]] of&nbsp;{{math|'''p'''}} by&nbsp;{{math|'''q'''}}:\n: <math>\\mathbf{p'} = \\mathbf{q} \\mathbf{p} \\mathbf{q}^{-1}</math>\nusing the [[Hamilton product]], where {{math|1='''p'''′ = (''p<sub>x</sub>''′, ''p<sub>y</sub>''′, ''p<sub>z</sub>''′)}} is the new position vector of the point after the rotation. In a programmatic implementation, this is achieved by constructing a quaternion whose vector part is {{math|'''p'''}} and real part equals zero and then performing the quaternion multiplication. The vector part of the resulting quaternion is the desired vector {{math|'''p'''′}}.\n\nMathematically, this operation carries the ''set'' of all \"pure\" quaternions {{math|'''p'''}} (those with real part equal to zero)—which constitute a 3-dimensional space among the quaternions—into itself, by the desired rotation about the axis '''''u''''', by the angle θ. (Each real quaternion is carried into itself by this operation. But for the purpose of rotations in 3-dimensional space, we ignore the real quaternions.)\n\nThe rotation is clockwise if our line of sight points in the same direction as {{mvec|''u''}}.\n\nIn this instance, {{math|'''q'''}} is a [[unit quaternion]] and\n: <math> \\mathbf{q}^{-1} = e^{-\\frac{\\theta}{2}{(u_x\\mathbf{i} + u_y\\mathbf{j} + u_z\\mathbf{k})}} = \\cos \\frac{\\theta}{2} - (u_x\\mathbf{i} + u_y\\mathbf{j} + u_z\\mathbf{k}) \\sin \\frac{\\theta}{2} .</math>\n\nIt follows that conjugation by the product of two quaternions is the composition of conjugations by these quaternions: If {{math|'''p'''}} and {{math|'''q'''}} are unit quaternions, then rotation (conjugation) by&nbsp;{{math|'''pq'''}} is\n:<math>\\mathbf{p q} \\vec{v} (\\mathbf{p q})^{-1} = \\mathbf{p q} \\vec{v} \\mathbf{q}^{-1} \\mathbf{p}^{-1} = \\mathbf{p} (\\mathbf{q} \\vec{v} \\mathbf{q}^{-1}) \\mathbf{p}^{-1}</math>,\nwhich is the same as rotating (conjugating) by&nbsp;{{math|'''q'''}} and then by&nbsp;{{math|'''p'''}}. The scalar component of the result is necessarily zero.\n\nThe quaternion inverse of a rotation is the opposite rotation, since <math>\\mathbf{q}^{-1} (\\mathbf{q} \\vec{v} \\mathbf{q}^{-1}) \\mathbf{q} = \\vec{v}</math>. The square of a quaternion rotation is a rotation by twice the angle around the same axis. More generally {{math|'''q'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is a rotation by&nbsp;{{mvar|n}} times the angle around the same axis as {{math|'''q'''}}. This can be extended to arbitrary real {{mvar|n}}, allowing for smooth interpolation between spatial orientations; see [[Slerp]].\n\nTwo rotation quaternions can be combined into one equivalent quaternion by the relation:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{q}' = \\mathbf{q}_2 \\mathbf{q}_1 </math>\n\nin which {{math|'''q''′'''''}} corresponds to the rotation {{math|'''q'''<sub>1</sub>}} followed by the rotation {{math|'''q'''<sub>2</sub>}}. (Note that quaternion multiplication is not [[commutative]].) Thus, an arbitrary number of rotations can be composed together and then applied as a single rotation.\n\n=== Example ===\n\n==== The conjugation operation ====\n\n[[File:Diagonal rotation.png|250px|thumb|right|A rotation of 120° around the first diagonal permutes {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, and {{math|'''k'''}} cyclically.]]\n\n''Conjugating'' {{math|'''p'''}} ''by'' {{math|'''q'''}} refers to the operation {{math|'''p''' ↦ '''qpq'''<sup>−1</sup>}}.\n\nConsider the rotation {{mvar|f}} around the axis <math>\\vec{v} = \\mathbf{i} + \\mathbf{j} + \\mathbf{k}</math>, with a rotation angle of 120°, or {{sfrac|2π|3}}&nbsp;[[radian]]s. <!-- clever! -->\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\dfrac{2 \\pi}{3}</math>\n\n[[File:Versor action on Hurwitz quaternions.svg|thumb|right|{{math|'''p''' ↦ '''q p'''}} for {{math|1='''q''' = {{sfrac|1 + ''i'' + ''j'' + ''k''|2}}}} on the unit [[3-sphere]].

This is sufficient to reproduce all of the rules of complex number arithmetic: for example:\n: <math>(a+b\\mathbf{i})(c+d\\mathbf{i}) = ac + ad\\mathbf{i} + b\\mathbf{i}c + b\\mathbf{i}d\\mathbf{i} = ac + ad\\mathbf{i} + bc\\mathbf{i} + bd\\mathbf{i}^2 = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad) \\mathbf{i}.</math>\n\nIn the same way the quaternions can be defined by introducing abstract symbols {{math|'''i'''}}, {{math|'''j'''}}, {{math|'''k'''}} which satisfy the rules {{math|1='''i'''<sup>2</sup> = '''j'''<sup>2</sup> = '''k'''<sup>2</sup> = '''i j k''' = −1}} and the usual algebraic rules ''except'' the commutative law of multiplication (a familiar example of such a noncommutative multiplication is [[matrix multiplication]]). From this all of the rules of quaternion arithmetic follow, such as the [[Quaternion#Multiplication of basis elements|rules on multiplication of quaternion basis elements]]. Using these rules, one can show that:\n: <math>(a + b\\mathbf{i} + c\\mathbf{j} + d\\mathbf{k}) (e + f\\mathbf{i} + g\\mathbf{j} + h\\mathbf{k}) =</math>\n<math> (ae - bf - cg - dh) + (af + be + ch - dg) \\mathbf{i} + (ag - bh + ce + df) \\mathbf{j} + (ah + bg - cf + de) \\mathbf{k}.</math>\n\nThe imaginary part <math>b\\mathbf{i} + c\\mathbf{j} + d\\mathbf{k}</math> of a quaternion behaves like a vector <math>\\vec{v} = (b,c,d)</math> in three dimension vector space, and the real part {{mvar|a}} behaves like a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] in {{math|'''R'''}}. When quaternions are used in geometry, it is more convenient to define them as [[Classical Hamiltonian quaternions#Quaternion|a scalar plus a vector]]:\n\n: <math>a + b\\mathbf{i} + c\\mathbf{j} + d\\mathbf{k} = a + \\vec{v}.</math>\n\nThose who have studied vectors at school might find it strange to add a ''number'' to a ''vector'', as they are objects of very different natures, or to ''multiply'' two vectors together, as this operation is usually undefined. However, if one remembers that it is a mere notation for the real and imaginary parts of a quaternion, it becomes more legitimate. In other words, the correct reasoning is the addition of two quaternions, one with zero vector/imaginary part, and another one with zero scalar/real part:\n: <math>a + \\vec{v} = (a, \\vec{0}) + (0, \\vec{v}).</math>\n\nWe can express quaternion multiplication in the modern language of vector [[cross product|cross]] and [[dot product]]s (which were actually inspired by the quaternions in the first place <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Altmann|first1=Simon L.|title=Hamilton, Rodrigues, and the Quaternion Scandal|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=62|issue=5|page=306|doi=10.2307/2689481}}</ref>). When multiplying the vector/imaginary parts, in place of the rules {{math|1='''i'''<sup>2</sup> = '''j'''<sup>2</sup> = '''k'''<sup>2</sup> = '''ijk''' = −1}} we have the quaternion multiplication rule:\n: <math>\\vec{v} \\vec{w} = \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w} - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{w},</math>\nwhere:\n* <math>\\vec{v} \\vec{w}</math> is the resulting quaternion,\n* <math>\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}</math> is vector cross product (a vector),\n* <math>\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{w}</math> is vector scalar product (a scalar).\n\nQuaternion multiplication is noncommutative (because of the cross product, which anti-commutes), while scalar–scalar and scalar–vector multiplications commute. From these rules it follows immediately that ([[Quaternions#Quaternions and the geometry of R3|see details]]):\n\n: <math>(s + \\vec{v}) (t + \\vec{w}) = (s t - \\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{w}) + (s \\vec{w} + t \\vec{v} + \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{w}).</math>\n\nThe (left and right) multiplicative inverse or reciprocal of a nonzero quaternion is given by the conjugate-to-norm ratio ([[Quaternion#Conjugation.2C the norm.2C and reciprocal|see details]]):\n\n: <math>(s + \\vec{v})^{-1} = \\frac{(s + \\vec{v})^*}{\\lVert s + \\vec{v} \\rVert^2} = \\frac{s - \\vec{v}}{s^2 + \\lVert \\vec{v} \\rVert^2},</math>\n\nas can be verified by direct calculation.\n\n===Proof of the quaternion rotation identity===\n\nLet <math>\\vec{u}</math> be a unit vector (the rotation axis) and let <math>q = \\cos \\frac{\\alpha}{2} + \\vec{u} \\sin \\frac{\\alpha}{2}</math>.

This is the [[Rodrigues' rotation formula|formula of a rotation]] by {{mvar|&alpha;}} around the {{vec|''u''}} axis.\n\n== Quaternion rotation operations ==\n\nA very formal explanation of the properties used in this section is given by Altman.<ref>Simon L. Altman (1986) ''Rotations, Quaternions, and Double Groups'', Dover Publications (see especially Ch. 12).</ref>\n\n===The hypersphere of rotations===\n{{main|Rotation group SO(3)}}\n\n====Visualizing the space of rotations====\nUnit quaternions represent the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of Euclidean [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]] in [[three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] in a very straightforward way. The correspondence between rotations and quaternions can be understood by first visualizing the space of rotations itself.\n\n[[File:Space of rotations.png|250px|thumb|right|Two rotations by different angles and different axes in the space of rotations. The length of the vector is related to the magnitude of the rotation.]]\n\nIn order to visualize the space of rotations, it helps to consider a simpler case. Any rotation in three dimensions can be described by a rotation by some [[Angle of rotation|angle]] about some [[Axis of rotation|axis]]; for our purposes, we will use an axis ''vector'' to establish [[Orientation (vector space)|handedness]] for our angle. Consider the special case in which the axis of rotation lies in the ''xy'' plane. We can then specify the axis of one of these rotations by a point on a circle through which the vector crosses, and we can select the radius of the circle to denote the [[angle of rotation]].\n\nSimilarly, a rotation whose axis of rotation lies in the ''xy'' plane can be described as a point on a sphere of ''fixed'' radius in ''three'' dimensions. Beginning at the north pole of a sphere in three-dimensional space, we specify the point at the north pole to be the identity rotation (a zero angle rotation). Just as in the case of the identity rotation, no axis of rotation is defined, and the angle of rotation (zero) is irrelevant. A rotation having a very small rotation angle can be specified by a slice through the sphere parallel to the ''xy'' plane and very near the north pole. The circle defined by this slice will be very small, corresponding to the small angle of the rotation. As the rotation angles become larger, the slice moves in the negative ''z'' direction, and the circles become larger until the equator of the sphere is reached, which will correspond to a rotation angle of 180 degrees. Continuing southward, the radii of the circles now become smaller (corresponding to the absolute value of the angle of the rotation considered as a negative number). Finally, as the south pole is reached, the circles shrink once more to the identity rotation, which is also specified as the point at the south pole.\n\nNotice that a number of characteristics of such rotations and their representations can be seen by this visualization. The space of rotations is continuous, each rotation has a neighborhood of rotations which are nearly the same, and this neighborhood becomes flat as the neighborhood shrinks. Also, each rotation is actually represented by two antipodal points on the sphere, which are at opposite ends of a line through the center of the sphere. This reflects the fact that each rotation can be represented as a rotation about some axis, or, equivalently, as a negative rotation about an axis pointing in the opposite direction (a so-called [[Double covering group|double cover]]). The \"latitude\" of a circle representing a particular rotation angle will be half of the angle represented by that rotation, since as the point is moved from the north to south pole, the latitude ranges from zero to 180 degrees, while the angle of rotation ranges from 0 to 360 degrees. (the \"longitude\" of a point then represents a particular axis of rotation.) Note however that this set of rotations is not closed under composition. Two successive rotations with axes in the ''xy'' plane will not necessarily give a rotation whose axis lies in the ''xy'' plane, and thus cannot be represented as a point on the sphere. This will not be the case with a general rotation in 3-space, in which rotations do form a closed set under composition.\n\n[[File:Hypersphere of rotations.png|250px|thumb|right|The sphere of rotations for the rotations that have a \"horizontal\" axis (in the ''xy'' plane).]]\n\nThis visualization can be extended to a general rotation in 3-dimensional space. The identity rotation is a point, and a small angle of rotation about some axis can be represented as a point on a sphere with a small radius. As the angle of rotation grows, the sphere grows, until the angle of rotation reaches 180 degrees, at which point the sphere begins to shrink, becoming a point as the angle approaches 360 degrees (or zero degrees from the negative direction). This set of expanding and contracting spheres represents a [[3-sphere|hypersphere in four dimensional space]] (a 3-sphere). Just as in the simpler example above, each rotation represented as a point on the hypersphere is matched by its antipodal point on that hypersphere. The \"latitude\" on the hypersphere will be half of the corresponding angle of rotation, and the neighborhood of any point will become \"flatter\" (i.e. be represented by a 3-D Euclidean space of points) as the neighborhood shrinks. This behavior is matched by the set of unit quaternions: A general quaternion represents a point in a four dimensional space, but constraining it to have unit magnitude yields a three-dimensional space equivalent to the surface of a hypersphere. The magnitude of the unit quaternion will be unity, corresponding to a hypersphere of unit radius. The vector part of a unit quaternion represents the radius of the 2-sphere corresponding to the axis of rotation, and its magnitude is the cosine of half the angle of rotation. Each rotation is represented by two unit quaternions of opposite sign, and, as in the space of rotations in three dimensions, the quaternion product of two unit quaternions will yield a unit quaternion. Also, the space of unit quaternions is \"flat\" in any infinitesimal neighborhood of a given unit quaternion.\n\n====Parameterizing the space of rotations====\nWe can parameterize the surface of a sphere with two coordinates, such as latitude and longitude. But latitude and longitude are ill-behaved ([[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]]) at the north and south poles, though the poles are not intrinsically different from any other points on the sphere. At the poles (latitudes +90° and −90°), the longitude becomes meaningless.\n\nIt can be shown that no two-parameter coordinate system can avoid such degeneracy. We can avoid such problems by embedding the sphere in three-dimensional space and parameterizing it with three Cartesian coordinates {{math|(''w'', ''x'', ''y'')}}, placing the north pole at {{math|1=(''w'', ''x'', ''y'') = (1, 0, 0)}}, the south pole at {{math|1=(''w'', ''x'', ''y'') = (−1, 0, 0)}}, and the equator at {{math|1=''w'' = 0}}, {{math|1=''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}. Points on the sphere satisfy the constraint {{math|1=''w''<sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}, so we still have just two [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] though there are three coordinates.  A point {{math|(''w'', ''x'', ''y'')}} on the sphere represents a rotation in the ordinary space around the horizontal axis directed by the vector {{math|(''x'', ''y'', 0)}} by an angle <math>\\alpha= 2 \\cos^{-1} w = 2 \\sin^{-1} \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math>.\n\nIn the same way the hyperspherical space of 3D rotations can be parameterized by three angles ([[Euler angles]]), but any such parameterization is degenerate at some points on the hypersphere, leading to the problem of [[gimbal lock]]. We can avoid this by using four Euclidean coordinates {{math|''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z''}}, with {{math|1=''w''<sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> = 1}}. The point {{math|(''w'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} represents a rotation around the axis directed by the vector {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} by an angle <math>\\alpha = 2 \\cos^{-1} w = 2 \\sin^{-1} \\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}.</math>\n\n== Explaining quaternions' properties with rotations ==\n\n=== Non-commutativity ===\n\nThe multiplication of quaternions is [[non-commutative]]. This fact explains how the {{math|'''p''' ↦ '''q p q'''<sup>−1</sup>}} formula can work at all, having {{math|1='''q q'''<sup>[[multiplicative inverse|−1]]</sup> = 1}} by definition. Since the multiplication of unit quaternions corresponds to the composition of three-dimensional rotations, this property can be made intuitive by showing that three-dimensional rotations are not commutative in general.\n\nSet two books next to each other. Rotate one of them 90&nbsp;degrees clockwise around the ''z'' axis, then flip it 180&nbsp;degrees around the ''x'' axis. Take the other book, flip it 180° around ''x'' axis first, and 90° clockwise around ''z'' later. The two books do not end up parallel. This shows that, in general, the composition of two different rotations around two distinct spatial axes will not commute.\n\n=== Orientation ===\n\nThe [[vector cross product]], used to define the axis–angle representation, does confer an [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] (\"handedness\") to space: in a three-dimensional vector space, the three vectors in the equation {{math|1='''a''' × '''b''' = '''c'''}} will always form a right-handed set (or a left-handed set, depending on how the cross product is defined), thus fixing an orientation in the vector space. Alternatively, the dependence on orientation is expressed in referring to such {{mvec|''u''}} that specifies a rotation as to ''[[axial vector]]s''. In quaternionic formalism the choice of an orientation of the space corresponds to order of multiplication: {{math|1='''ij''' = '''k'''}} but {{math|1='''ji''' = −'''k'''}}. If one reverses the orientation, then the formula above becomes {{math|'''p''' ↦ '''q'''<sup>−1</sup> '''p q'''}}, i.e., a unit {{math|'''q'''}} is replaced with the conjugate quaternion – the same behaviour as of axial vectors.\n\n== Comparison with other representations of rotations ==\n\n=== Advantages of quaternions ===\n\nThe representation of a rotation as a quaternion (4 numbers) is more compact than the representation as an [[orthogonal matrix]] (9 numbers).  Furthermore, for a given axis and angle, one can easily construct the corresponding quaternion, and conversely, for a given quaternion one can easily read off the axis and the angle.  Both of these are much harder with matrices or [[Euler angles]].\n\nIn [[video game]]s and other applications, one is often interested in “smooth rotations”, meaning that the scene should slowly rotate and not in a single step.  This can be accomplished by choosing a [[curve]] such as the [[slerp|spherical linear interpolation]] in the quaternions, with one endpoint being the identity transformation 1 (or some other initial rotation) and the other being the intended final rotation.  This is more problematic with other representations of rotations.\n\nWhen composing several rotations on a computer, rounding errors necessarily accumulate.  A quaternion that’s slightly off still represents a rotation after being normalised: a matrix that’s slightly off may not be [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] any more and is harder to convert back to a proper orthogonal matrix.\n\nQuaternions also avoid a phenomenon called [[gimbal lock]] which can result when, for example in [[flight dynamics|pitch/yaw/roll rotational systems]], the pitch is rotated 90° up or down, so that yaw and roll then correspond to the same motion, and a degree of freedom of rotation is lost. In a [[gimbal]]-based aerospace inertial navigation system, for instance, this could have disastrous results if the aircraft is in a steep dive or ascent.\n\n=== Conversion to and from the matrix representation ===\n\n==== From a quaternion to an orthogonal matrix ====\n\nThe [[orthogonal matrix]] corresponding to a rotation by the unit quaternion {{math|1='''z''' = ''a'' + ''b'' '''i''' + ''c'' '''j''' + ''d'' '''k'''}} (with {{math|1={{abs| '''z''' }} = 1}}) when post-multiplying with a column vector is given by\n:<math>R = \\begin{pmatrix}\na^2+b^2-c^2-d^2&2bc-2ad        &2bd+2ac        \\\\\n2bc+2ad        &a^2-b^2+c^2-d^2&2cd-2ab        \\\\\n2bd-2ac        &2cd+2ab        &a^2-b^2-c^2+d^2\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThis rotation matrix is used on vector {{math|w}} as <math>w_{rotated} = R \\cdot w</math>. The quaternion representation of this rotation is given by:\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix} 0\\\\ w_{rotated} \\end{bmatrix} = z \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ w\\end{bmatrix} z^*, </math>\nwhere <math>z^*</math> is the conjugate of the quaternion <math> z </math>, given by <math> \\mathbf{z}^* = a - b\\mathbf{i} - c\\mathbf{j} - d\\mathbf{k}</math>\n\nAlso, quaternion multiplication is defined as (assuming a and b are quaternions, like z above):\n\n<math>ab = (a_0 b_0 - \\vec{a}\\cdot \\vec{b}; a_0 \\vec{b} + b_0 \\vec{a} + \\vec{a}\\times \\vec{b})</math>\n\nwhere the order a,b is important since the cross product of two vectors is not commutative.\n\n==== From an orthogonal matrix to a quaternion ====\n\nOne must be careful when converting a rotation matrix to a quaternion, as several straightforward methods tend to be unstable when the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] (sum of the diagonal elements) of the rotation matrix is zero or very small. For a stable method of converting an orthogonal matrix to a quaternion, see the [[Rotation matrix#Quaternion|Quaternion subsection of the '''Rotation matrix''' article]].\n\n==== Fitting quaternions ====\nThe above section described how to recover a quaternion {{math|'''q'''}} from a {{gaps|3|×|3}} [[rotation matrix]] {{mvar|Q}}. Suppose, however, that we have some matrix {{mvar|Q}} that is not a pure rotation—due to [[round-off error]]s, for example—and we wish to find the quaternion {{math|'''q'''}} that most accurately represents {{mvar|Q}}. In that case we construct a symmetric {{gaps|4|×|4}} matrix\n:<math> K = \\frac13\n \\begin{bmatrix}\n  Q_{xx}-Q_{yy}-Q_{zz} & Q_{yx}+Q_{xy} & Q_{zx}+Q_{xz} & Q_{yz}-Q_{zy} \\\\\n  Q_{yx}+Q_{xy} & Q_{yy}-Q_{xx}-Q_{zz} & Q_{zy}+Q_{yz} & Q_{zx}-Q_{xz} \\\\\n  Q_{zx}+Q_{xz} & Q_{zy}+Q_{yz} & Q_{zz}-Q_{xx}-Q_{yy} & Q_{xy}-Q_{yx} \\\\\n  Q_{yz}-Q_{zy} & Q_{zx}-Q_{xz} & Q_{xy}-Q_{yx} & Q_{xx}+Q_{yy}+Q_{zz}\n \\end{bmatrix} ,\n</math>\nand find the [[eigenvector]] {{math|(''x'', ''y'', ''z'', ''w'')}} corresponding to the largest eigenvalue (that value will be 1 if and only if {{mvar|Q}} is a pure rotation). The quaternion so obtained will correspond to the rotation closest to the original matrix {{mvar|Q}}  {{Dubious|date=December 2009}}<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Bar-Itzhack\n | first=Itzhack Y.\n | author-link=\n |date=Nov–Dec 2000\n | title=New method for extracting the quaternion from a rotation matrix\n | journal=AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics\n | volume=23\n | issue=6\n | pages=1085\n | issn=0731-5090\n | doi=10.2514/2.4654\n | bibcode=2000JGCD...23.1085B\n }}</ref>.\n\n=== Performance comparisons ===\nThis section discusses the performance implications of using quaternions versus other methods (axis/angle or rotation matrices) to perform rotations in 3D.\n\n==== Results ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Storage requirements\n|-\n!

This requires 3 × (3 multiplications + 2 additions) = 9 multiplications and 6 additions, the most efficient method for rotating a vector.\n# A rotation can be represented by a unit-length quaternion {{math|1='''q''' = (''w'', {{vec|''r''}})}} with scalar (real) part {{mvar|w}} and vector (imaginary) part {{vec|''r''}}. The rotation can be applied to a 3D vector {{vec|''v''}} via the formula <math> \\vec{v}_\\text{new}=\\vec{v} + 2\\vec{r} \\times (\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{v} + w \\vec{v})</math>. This requires only 15 multiplications and 15 additions to evaluate (or 18 multiplications and 12 additions if the factor of 2 is done via multiplication.) This formula, originally thought to be used with axis/angle notation (Rodrigues' formula), can also be applied to quaternion notation. This yields the same result as the less efficient but more compact formula of quaternion multiplication <math> \\vec{v}_\\text{new} = q \\vec{v} q^{-1}</math>.\n# Use the [[Rotation matrix#Angle-Axis representation and quaternion representation|angle/axis formula]] to convert an angle/axis to a [[rotation matrix]] {{mvar|R}} then multiplying with a vector, or, similarly, use a formula to convert quaternion notation to a rotation matrix, then multiplying with a vector. Converting the angle/axis to {{mvar|R}} costs 12 multiplies, 2 function calls (sin, cos), and 10 add/subtracts; from item 1, rotating using {{mvar|R}} adds an additional 9 multiplications and 6 additions for a total of 21 multiplies, 16 add/subtracts, and 2 function calls (sin, cos). Converting a quaternion to {{mvar|R}} costs 12 multiplies and 12 add/subtracts; from item 1, rotating using {{mvar|R}} adds an additional 9 multiplications and 6 additions for a total of 21 multiplies and 18 add/subtracts.\n\n== Pairs of unit quaternions as rotations in 4D space ==\n\nA pair of unit quaternions {{math|'''z'''<sub>l</sub>}} and {{math|'''z'''<sub>r</sub>}} can represent any [[Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space|rotation in 4D space]]. Given a four dimensional vector {{vec|''v''}}, and assuming that it is a quaternion, we can rotate the vector {{vec|''v''}} like this:\n\n:<math>f(\\vec{v})=\\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{l}} \\vec{v} \\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{r}}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{\\rm{l}}&-b_{\\rm{l}}&-c_{\\rm{l}}&-d_{\\rm{l}}\\\\\nb_{\\rm{l}}&a_{\\rm{l}}&-d_{\\rm{l}}&c_{\\rm{l}}\\\\\nc_{\\rm{l}}&d_{\\rm{l}}&a_{\\rm{l}}&-b_{\\rm{l}}\\\\\nd_{\\rm{l}}&-c_{\\rm{l}}&b_{\\rm{l}}&a_{\\rm{l}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\nw\\\\x\\\\y\\\\z\n\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{\\rm{r}}&-b_{\\rm{r}}&-c_{\\rm{r}}&-d_{\\rm{r}}\\\\\nb_{\\rm{r}}&a_{\\rm{r}}&d_{\\rm{r}}&-c_{\\rm{r}}\\\\\nc_{\\rm{r}}&-d_{\\rm{r}}&a_{\\rm{r}}&b_{\\rm{r}}\\\\\nd_{\\rm{r}}&c_{\\rm{r}}&-b_{\\rm{r}}&a_{\\rm{r}}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nThe pair of matrices represents a rotation of ℝ<sup>4</sup>. Note that since <math>(\\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{l}} \\vec{v}) \\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{r}} = \\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{l}} (\\vec{v} \\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{r}})</math>, the two matrices must commute. Therefore, there are two commuting subgroups of the set of four dimensional rotations. Arbitrary four dimensional rotations have 6 degrees of freedom, each matrix represents 3 of those 6 degrees of freedom.\n\nSince the generators of the four-dimensional rotations can be represented by pairs of quaternions (as follows), all four-dimensional rotations can also be represented.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{l}} \\vec{v} \\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{r}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1      &-dt_{ab}&-dt_{ac}&-dt_{ad}\\\\\ndt_{ab}&1       &-dt_{bc}&-dt_{bd}\\\\\ndt_{ac}& dt_{bc}&1       &-dt_{cd}\\\\\ndt_{ad}& dt_{bd}& dt_{cd}&1\n\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}\nw\\\\\nx\\\\\ny\\\\\nz\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{l}}=\n1+{dt_{ab}+dt_{cd}\\over 2}i+{dt_{ac}-dt_{bd}\\over 2}j+{dt_{ad}+dt_{bc}\\over 2}k\n</math>\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{z}_{\\rm{r}}=\n1+{dt_{ab}-dt_{cd}\\over 2}i+{dt_{ac}+dt_{bd}\\over 2}j+{dt_{ad}-dt_{bc}\\over 2}k\n</math>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Anti-twister mechanism]]\n*[[Binary polyhedral group]]\n*[[Biquaternion]]\n*[[Charts on SO(3)]]\n*[[Clifford algebra]]s\n*[[Conversion between quaternions and Euler angles]]\n*[[Covering space]]\n*[[Dual quaternion]]\n*[[Elliptic geometry#Elliptic space|Elliptic geometry]]\n*[[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions]]\n*[[Rotation (mathematics)]]\n*[[Spin group]]\n*[[Slerp]], spherical linear interpolation\n*[[Olinde Rodrigues]]\n*[[William Rowan Hamilton]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{cite article|first1=Carl|last1=Grubin\n|year=1970|title=Derivation of the quaternion scheme via the Euler axis and angle\n|doi=10.2514/3.30149|journal=J.

      "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[group (mathematics)|group]] of '''rotations about a fixed point in [[four-dimensional Euclidean space]]''' is denoted '''SO(4)'''. The name comes from the fact that it is the [[special orthogonal group]] of order 4.\n\nIn this article ''[[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]'' means ''rotational displacement''. For the sake of uniqueness rotation angles are assumed to be in the segment {{closed-closed|0, π}} except where mentioned or clearly implied by the context otherwise.\n\nA \"fixed plane\" is a plane for which every vector in the plane is unchanged after the rotation. An \"invariant plane\" is a plane for which every vector in the plane, although it may be affected by the rotation, remains in the plane after the rotation.\n\n==Geometry of 4D rotations==\nFour-dimensional rotations are of two types: simple rotations and double rotations.\n\n===Simple rotations===\nA simple rotation {{mvar|R}} about a rotation centre {{mvar|O}} leaves an entire plane {{mvar|A}} through {{mvar|O}} (axis-plane) fixed. Every plane {{mvar|B}} that is completely [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]{{efn|group=nb|Two flat subspaces {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} of dimensions {{mvar|M}} and {{mvar|N}} of a Euclidean space {{mvar|S}} of at least {{math|''M'' + ''N''}} dimensions are called ''completely orthogonal'' if every line in {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}} is orthogonal to every line in {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}}. If {{math|dim(''S'') {{=}} ''M'' + ''N''}} then {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} intersect in a single point {{mvar|O}}. If {{math|dim(''S'') > ''M'' + ''N''}} then {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} may or may not intersect. If {{math|dim(''S'') {{=}} ''M'' + ''N''}} then a line in {{math|''S''<sub>1</sub>}} and a line in {{math|''S''<sub>2</sub>}} may or may not intersect; if they intersect then they intersect in O.<ref>Schoute 1902, Volume 1.</ref>}} to {{mvar|A}} intersects {{mvar|A}} in a certain point {{mvar|P}}. Each such point {{mvar|P}} is the centre of the 2D rotation induced by {{mvar|R}} in {{mvar|B}}. All these 2D rotations have the same rotation angle {{mvar|α}}.\n\n[[Half-line]]s from {{mvar|O}} in the axis-plane {{mvar|A}} are not displaced; half-lines from {{mvar|O}} orthogonal to {{mvar|A}} are displaced through {{mvar|α}}; all other half-lines are displaced through an angle less than {{mvar|α}}.\n\n===Double rotations===\n[[File:Tesseract.gif|thumb|[[Tesseract]], in [[stereographic projection]], in '''double rotation''']]\n[[File:Torus vectors oblique.jpg|thumb|left|A 4D [[Clifford torus]] stereographically projected into 3D looks like a [[torus]], and a double rotation can be seen as in helical path on that torus. For a rotation whose two rotation angles form a rational number, the paths will eventually reconnect, while for an irrational ratio they will not. An isoclinic rotation will form a [[Villarceau circle]] on the torus, while a simple rotation will form a circle parallel or perpendicular to the central axis.]]\nFor each rotation {{mvar|R}} of 4-space (fixing the origin), there is at least one pair of [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] 2-planes {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} each of which are invariant and whose direct sum {{math|''A'' ⊕ ''B''}} is all of 4-space. Hence {{mvar|R}} operating on either of these planes produces an ordinary rotation of that plane. For almost all {{mvar|R}} (all of the 6-dimensional set of rotations except for a 3-dimensional subset), the rotation angles {{mvar|α}} in plane {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|β}} in plane {{mvar|B}} — both assumed to be nonzero — are different. The unequal rotation angles {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} satisfying {{math|−π < ''α''}}, {{math|''β'' < π}} are almost{{efn|group=nb|Assuming that 4-space is oriented, then an orientation for each of the 2-planes {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} can be chosen to be consistent with this orientation of 4-space in two equally valid ways.

(In order to measure a rotation angle in a 2-plane, it is necessary to specify an orientation on that 2-plane. A rotation angle of −{{pi}} is the same as one of +{{pi}}. If the orientation of 4-space is reversed, the resulting angles would be either {{math|{''α'', −''β''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} or {{math|{−''α'', ''β''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}. Hence the '''absolute values''' of the angles are well-defined completely independently of any choices.)}} uniquely determined by {{mvar|R}}. Assuming that 4-space is oriented, then the orientations of the 2-planes {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} can be chosen consistent with this orientation in two ways. If the rotation angles are unequal ({{math|''α'' ≠ ''β''}}), {{mvar|R}} is sometimes termed a \"double rotation\".\n\nIn that case of a double rotation, {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} are the only pair of invariant planes, and [[half-line]]s from the origin in {{mvar|A}}, {{mvar|B}} are displaced through {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}} respectively, and half-lines from the origin not in {{mvar|A}} or {{mvar|B}} are displaced through angles strictly between {{mvar|α}} and {{mvar|β}}.\n\n====Isoclinic rotations====\nIf the rotation angles of a double rotation are equal then there are infinitely many [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] planes instead of just two, and all [[half-line]]s from {{mvar|O}} are displaced through the same angle. Such rotations are called '''isoclinic''' or '''equiangular rotations''', or '''Clifford displacements'''. Beware: not all planes through {{mvar|O}} are invariant under isoclinic rotations; only planes that are spanned by a half-line and the corresponding displaced half-line are invariant.\n\nAssuming that a fixed orientation has been chosen for 4-dimensional space, isoclinic 4D rotations may be put into two categories. To see this, consider an isoclinic rotation {{mvar|R}}, and take an orientation-consistent ordered set {{math|''OU'', ''OX'', ''OY'', ''OZ''}} of mutually perpendicular half-lines at {{mvar|O}} (denoted as {{mvar|OUXYZ}}) such that {{mvar|OU}} and {{mvar|OX}} span an invariant plane, and therefore {{mvar|OY}} and {{mvar|OZ}} also span an invariant plane. Now assume that only the rotation angle {{mvar|α}} is specified. Then there are in general four isoclinic rotations in planes {{mvar|OUX}} and {{mvar|OYZ}} with rotation angle {{mvar|α}}, depending on the rotation senses in {{mvar|OUX}} and {{mvar|OYZ}}.\n\nWe make the convention that the rotation senses from {{mvar|OU}} to {{mvar|OX}} and from {{mvar|OY}} to {{mvar|OZ}} are reckoned positive. Then we have the four rotations {{math|''R''<sub>1</sub> {{=}} (+''α'', +''α'')}}, {{math|''R''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} (−''α'', −''α'')}}, {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub> {{=}} (+''α'', −''α'')}} and {{math|''R''<sub>4</sub> {{=}} (−''α'', +''α'')}}. {{math|''R''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''R''<sub>2</sub>}} are each other's [[inverse function|inverses]]; so are {{math|''R''<sub>3</sub>}} and {{math|''R''<sub>4</sub>}}. As long as {{mvar|α}} lies between 0 and {{pi}}, these four rotations will be distinct.\n\nIsoclinic rotations with like signs are denoted as ''left-isoclinic''; those with opposite signs as ''right-isoclinic''. Left- and right-isoclinic rotations are represented respectively by left- and right-multiplication by unit quaternions; see the paragraph \"Relation to quaternions\" below.\n\nThe four rotations are pairwise different except if {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}} or {{math|''α'' {{=}} π}}. The angle {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}} corresponds to the identity rotation; {{math|''α'' {{=}} π}} corresponds to the [[inversion in a point|central inversion]], given by the negative of the identity matrix. These two elements of SO(4) are the only ones that are simultaneously left- and right-isoclinic.\n\nLeft- and right-isocliny defined as above seem to depend on which specific isoclinic rotation was selected. However, when another isoclinic rotation {{mvar|R′}} with its own axes {{mvar|OU′}}, {{mvar|OX′}}, {{mvar|OY′}}, {{mvar|OZ′}} is selected, then one can always choose the [[even permutation|order]] of {{mvar|U′}}, {{mvar|X′}}, {{mvar|Y′}}, {{mvar|Z′}} such that {{mvar|OUXYZ}} can be transformed into {{mvar|OU′X′Y′Z′}} by a rotation rather than by a rotation-reflection (that is, so that the ordered basis {{mvar|OU′}}, {{mvar|OX′}}, {{mvar|OY′}}, {{mvar|OZ′}} is also consistent with the same fixed choice of orientation as {{mvar|OU}}, {{mvar|OX}}, {{mvar|OY}}, {{mvar|OZ}}). Therefore, once one has selected an orientation (that is, a system {{mvar|OUXYZ}} of axes that is universally denoted as right-handed), one can determine the left or right character of a specific isoclinic rotation.\n\n===Group structure of SO(4)===\nSO(4) is a [[noncommutative]] [[compact space|compact]] 6-[[dimension#Manifolds|dimensional]] [[Lie group]].\n\nEach plane through the rotation centre {{mvar|O}} is the axis-plane of a [[commutative]] [[subgroup]] [[isomorphic]] to SO(2). All these subgroups are mutually [[conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space|conjugate]] in SO(4).\n\nEach pair of completely [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] planes through O is the pair of [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] planes of a commutative subgroup of SO(4) isomorphic to ''SO''(2)&nbsp;×&nbsp;''SO''(2).\n\nThese groups are [[maximal torus|maximal tori]] of SO(4), which are all mutually conjugate in SO(4). See also [[Clifford torus]].\n\nAll left-isoclinic rotations form a noncommutative subgroup {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} of SO(4), which is isomorphic to the [[multiplicative group]] {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}} of unit [[quaternion]]s. All right-isoclinic rotations likewise form a subgroup {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} of SO(4) isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}. Both {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} are maximal subgroups of SO(4).\n\nEach left-isoclinic rotation [[commutative|commutes]] with each right-isoclinic rotation. This implies that there exists a [[direct product of groups|direct product]] {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub> × ''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} with [[normal subgroup]]s {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}}; both of the corresponding [[factor group]]s are isomorphic to the other factor of the direct product, i.e. isomorphic to {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup>}}. (This is not SO(4) or a subgroup of it, because {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} are not disjoint: the identity {{mvar|I}} and the central inversion {{math|−''I''}} each belong to both {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}}.)\n\nEach 4D rotation {{mvar|A}} is in two ways the product of left- and right-isoclinic rotations {{math|''A''<sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''A''<sub>R</sub>}}. {{math|''A''<sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''A''<sub>R</sub>}} are together determined up to the central inversion, i.e. when both {{math|''A''<sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''A''<sub>R</sub>}} are multiplied by the central inversion their product is {{mvar|A}} again.\n\nThis implies that {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub> × ''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} is the [[universal covering group]] of SO(4) — its unique [[double covering group|double cover]] — and that {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} are normal subgroups of SO(4). The identity rotation {{mvar|I}} and the central inversion {{math|−''I''}} form a group {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} of order 2, which is the [[center of a group|centre]] of SO(4) and of both {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}}. The centre of a group is a normal subgroup of that group. The factor group of {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} in SO(4) is isomorphic to SO(3)&nbsp;×&nbsp;SO(3). The factor groups of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} by {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} and of {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} by {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub>}} are each isomorphic to SO(3). Similarly, the factor groups of SO(4) by {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and of SO(4) by {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} are each isomorphic to SO(3).\n\nThe '''topology''' of SO(4) is the same as that of the Lie group SO(3)&nbsp;×&nbsp;Spin(3) = SO(3)&nbsp;×&nbsp;SU(2), namely the topology of {{math|''P''<sup>3</sup> × ''S''<sup>3</sup>}}. However, it is noteworthy that, '''as a Lie group''', SO(4) is '''not''' a direct product of Lie groups, and so it is not isomorphic to SO(3)&nbsp;×&nbsp;Spin(3) = SO(3)&nbsp;×&nbsp;SU(2).\n\n===Special property of SO(4) among rotation groups in general===\nThe odd-dimensional rotation groups do not contain the central inversion and are [[simple group]]s.\n\nThe even-dimensional rotation groups do contain the central inversion {{math|−''I''}} and have the group {{math|''C''<sub>2</sub> {{=}} {''I'',−''I''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} as their [[center of a group|centre]]. From SO(6) onwards they are almost simple in the sense that the [[factor group]]s of their centres are simple groups.\n\nSO(4) is different: there is no [[Conjugation of isometries in Euclidean space|conjugation]] by any element of SO(4) that transforms left- and right-isoclinic rotations into each other. [[Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection]]s transform a left-isoclinic rotation into a right-isoclinic one by conjugation, and vice versa. This implies that under the group O(4) of ''all'' isometries with fixed point {{mvar|O}} the subgroups {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''S''<sup>3</sup><sub>R</sub>}} are mutually conjugate and so are not normal subgroups of O(4). The 5D rotation group SO(5) and all higher rotation groups contain subgroups isomorphic to O(4). Like SO(4), all even-dimensional rotation groups contain isoclinic rotations. But unlike SO(4), in SO(6) and all higher even-dimensional rotation groups any pair of isoclinic rotations through the same angle is conjugate. The sets of all isoclinic rotations are not even subgroups of SO({{math|2''N''}}), let alone normal subgroups.\n\n==Algebra of 4D rotations==\nSO(4) is commonly identified with the group of [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]-preserving [[isometry|isometric]] [[linear]] mappings of a 4D [[vector space]] with [[inner product]] over the [[real number]]s onto itself.\n\nWith respect to an [[orthonormal]] [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] in such a space SO(4) is represented as the group of real 4th-order [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] with [[determinant]] +1.\n\n===Isoclinic decomposition===\nA 4D rotation given by its matrix is decomposed into a left-isoclinic and a right-isoclinic rotation as follows:\n\nLet\n:<math>A=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{00} & a_{01} & a_{02} & a_{03} \\\\\na_{10} & a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{20} & a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\na_{30} & a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nbe its matrix with respect to an arbitrary orthonormal basis.\n\nCalculate from this the so-called ''associate matrix''\n\n:<math>M=\n\\frac{1}{4}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{00}+a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{33} & +a_{10}-a_{01}-a_{32}+a_{23} & +a_{20}+a_{31}-a_{02}-a_{13} & +a_{30}-a_{21}+a_{12}-a_{03} \\\\\na_{10}-a_{01}+a_{32}-a_{23} & -a_{00}-a_{11}+a_{22}+a_{33} & +a_{30}-a_{21}-a_{12}+a_{03} & -a_{20}-a_{31}-a_{02}-a_{13} \\\\\na_{20}-a_{31}-a_{02}+a_{13} & -a_{30}-a_{21}-a_{12}-a_{03} & -a_{00}+a_{11}-a_{22}+a_{33} & +a_{10}+a_{01}-a_{32}-a_{23} \\\\\na_{30}+a_{21}-a_{12}-a_{03} & +a_{20}-a_{31}+a_{02}-a_{13} & -a_{10}-a_{01}-a_{32}-a_{23} & -a_{00}+a_{11}+a_{22}-a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\n{{mvar|M}} has [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]] one and is of unit [[Euclidean norm]] as a 16D vector if and only if {{mvar|A}} is indeed a 4D rotation matrix. In this case there exist real numbers {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}} and {{math|''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s''}} such that\n\n:<math>M=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nap  &   aq  &   ar  &   as  \\\\\nbp  &   bq  &   br  &   bs  \\\\\ncp  &   cq  &   cr  &   cs  \\\\\ndp  &   dq  &   dr  &   ds\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nand\n:<math>(ap)^2 + \\cdots + (ds)^2 = \\left(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2\\right)\\left(p^2 + q^2 + r^2 + s^2\\right) = 1.</math>\nThere are exactly two sets of {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}} and {{math|''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s''}} such that {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''p''<sup>2</sup> + ''q''<sup>2</sup> + ''r''<sup>2</sup> + ''s''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}. They are each other's opposites.\n\nThe rotation matrix then equals\n:<math>\\begin{align}A&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nap-bq-cr-ds&-aq-bp+cs-dr&-ar-bs-cp+dq&-as+br-cq-dp\\\\\nbp+aq-dr+cs&-bq+ap+ds+cr&-br+as-dp-cq&-bs-ar-dq+cp\\\\\ncp+dq+ar-bs&-cq+dp-as-br&-cr+ds+ap+bq&-cs-dr+aq-bp\\\\\ndp-cq+br+as&-dq-cp-bs+ar&-dr-cs+bp-aq&-ds+cr+bq+ap\\end{pmatrix}\n\\\\&=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na&-b&-c&-d\\\\\nb&\\;\\,\\, a&-d&\\;\\,\\, c\\\\\nc&\\;\\,\\, d&\\;\\,\\, a&-b\\\\\nd&-c&\\;\\,\\, b&\\;\\,\\, a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np&-q&-r&-s\\\\\nq&\\;\\,\\, p&\\;\\,\\, s&-r\\\\\nr&-s&\\;\\,\\, p&\\;\\,\\, q\\\\\ns&\\;\\,\\, r&-q&\\;\\,\\, p\n\\end{pmatrix}\n.\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis formula is due to Van Elfrinkhof (1897).\n\nThe first factor in this decomposition represents a left-isoclinic rotation, the second factor a right-isoclinic rotation. The factors are determined up to the negative 4th-order [[identity matrix]], i.e. the central inversion.\n\n===Relation to quaternions===\nA point in 4-dimensional space with [[Cartesian coordinates]] {{math|(''u'', ''x'', ''y'', ''z'')}} may be represented by a [[quaternion]] {{math|1=''P'' = ''u'' + ''xi'' + ''yj'' + ''zk''}}.\n\nA left-isoclinic rotation is represented by left-multiplication by a unit quaternion {{math|1=''Q''<sub>L</sub> = ''a'' + ''bi'' + ''cj'' + ''dk''}}. In matrix-vector language this is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu'\\\\x'\\\\y'\\\\z'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na&-b&-c&-d\\\\\nb&\\;\\,\\, a&-d&\\;\\,\\, c\\\\\nc&\\;\\,\\, d&\\;\\,\\, a&-b\\\\\nd&-c&\\;\\,\\, b&\\;\\,\\, a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu\\\\x\\\\y\\\\z\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nLikewise, a right-isoclinic rotation is represented by right-multiplication by a unit quaternion {{math|1=''Q''<sub>R</sub> = ''p'' + ''qi'' + ''rj'' + ''sk''}}, which is in matrix-vector form\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu'\\\\x'\\\\y'\\\\z'\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\np&-q&-r&-s\\\\\nq&\\;\\,\\, p&\\;\\,\\, s&-r\\\\\nr&-s&\\;\\,\\, p&\\;\\,\\, q\\\\\ns&\\;\\,\\, r&-q&\\;\\,\\, p\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nu\\\\x\\\\y\\\\z\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn the preceding section ([[#Isoclinic decomposition]]) it is shown how a general 4D rotation is split into left- and right-isoclinic factors.\n\nIn quaternion language Van Elfrinkhof's formula reads\n:<math>u' + x'i + y'j + z'k = (a + bi + cj + dk)(u + xi + yj + zk)(p + qi + rj + sk), </math>\n\nor, in symbolic form,\n:<math>P' = Q_\\mathrm{L} P Q_\\mathrm{R}.\\, </math>\n\nAccording to the German mathematician [[Felix Klein]] this formula was already known to Cayley in 1854.\n\nQuaternion multiplication is [[associative]]. Therefore,\n:<math>P' = \\left(Q_\\mathrm{L} P\\right) Q_\\mathrm{R} = Q_\\mathrm{L} \\left(P Q_\\mathrm{R}\\right),\\,</math>\nwhich shows that left-isoclinic and right-isoclinic rotations commute.\n\n===The eigenvalues of 4D rotation matrices===\nThe four [[eigenvalue]]s of a 4D rotation matrix generally occur as two conjugate pairs of [[complex numbers]] of unit magnitude. If an eigenvalue is real, it must be ±1, since a rotation leaves the magnitude of a vector unchanged. The conjugate of that eigenvalue is also unity, yielding a pair of eigenvectors which define a fixed plane, and so the rotation is simple. In quaternion notation, a proper (i.e., non-inverting) rotation in SO(4) is a proper simple rotation if and only if the real parts of the unit quaternions {{math|''Q''<sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''Q''<sub>R</sub>}} are equal in magnitude and have the same sign.{{efn|group=nb|Example of opposite signs: the central inversion; in the quaternion representation the real parts are +1 and −1, and the central inversion cannot be accomplished by a single simple rotation.}} If they are both zero, all eigenvalues of the rotation are unity, and the rotation is the null rotation. If the real parts of {{math|''Q''<sub>L</sub>}} and {{math|''Q''<sub>R</sub>}} are not equal then all eigenvalues are complex, and the rotation is a double rotation.\n\n===The Euler–Rodrigues formula for 3D rotations===\nOur ordinary 3D space is conveniently treated as the subspace with coordinate system OXYZ of the 4D space with coordinate system OUXYZ. Its [[rotation group SO(3)]] is identified with the subgroup of SO(4) consisting of the matrices\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & \\,\\, 0 & \\,\\, 0 & \\,\\, 0 \\\\\n0 & a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\n0 & a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\n0 & a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nIn Van Elfrinkhof's formula in the preceding subsection this restriction to three dimensions leads to {{math|''p'' {{=}} ''a''}}, {{math|''q'' {{=}} −''b''}}, {{math|''r'' {{=}} −''c''}}, {{math|''s'' {{=}} −''d''}}, or in quaternion representation: {{math|''Q''<sub>''R''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''L''</sub>′ {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''L''</sub><sup>−1</sup>}}.\nThe 3D rotation matrix then becomes\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\\\na_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\\\na_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\na^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2 & 2(bc - ad)& 2(bd + ac) \\\\\n2(bc + ad) & a^2 - b^2 + c^2 -d^2 & 2(cd - ab) \\\\\n2(bd - ac) & 2(cd + ab) & a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + d^2\n\\end{pmatrix},\n</math>\n\nwhich is the representation of the 3D rotation by its [[Euler–Rodrigues parameters]]: {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d''}}.\n\nThe corresponding quaternion formula {{math|''P′'' {{=}} ''QPQ''<sup>−1</sup>}}, where {{math|''Q'' {{=}} ''Q''<sub>L</sub>}}, or, in expanded form:\n:<math>x'i + y'j + z'k = (a + bi + cj + dk)(xi + yj + zk)(a - bi - cj - dk)</math>\nis known as the [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]–[[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] formula.\n\n===Hopf coordinates===\n \nRotations in 3D space are made mathematically much more tractable by the use of [[hyperspherical coordinates|spherical coordinates]]. Any rotation in 3D can be characterized by a fixed axis of rotation and an invariant plane perpendicular to that axis. Without loss of generality, we can take the {{mvar|xy}}-plane as the invariant plane and the {{mvar|z}}-axis as the fixed axis. Since radial distances are not affected by rotation, we can characterize a rotation by its effect on the unit sphere (2-sphere) by [[spherical coordinates]] referred to the fixed axis and invariant plane:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nx &= \\sin\\theta \\cos \\phi \\\\\ny &= \\sin\\theta \\sin \\phi \\\\\nz &= \\cos\\theta\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBecause {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}, the points lie on the 2-sphere. A point at {{math|{''θ''<sub>0</sub>, ''φ''<sub>0</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}} rotated by an angle {{mvar|φ}} about the {{mvar|z}}-axis is specified simply by {{math|{''θ''<sub>0</sub>, ''φ''<sub>0</sub> + ''φ''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}}. While [[hyperspherical coordinates]] are also useful in dealing with 4D rotations, an even more useful coordinate system for 4D is provided by [[3-sphere#Hopf coordinates|Hopf coordinates]] {{math|{''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''η'', ''ξ''<sub>2</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}},<ref name=\"Karcher\">{{Citation\n|url= http://virtualmathmuseum.org/Surface/bianchi-pinkall_tori/bianchi-pinkall_tori.html\n|title= Bianchi–Pinkall Flat Tori in S<sub>3</sub>\n|work= 3DXM Documentation\n|last= Karcher |first= Hermann\n|publisher= 3DXM Consortium\n|accessdate= April 5, 2015\n|ref= none\n}}\n</ref> which are a set of three angular coordinates specifying a position on the 3-sphere. For example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nu &= \\cos\\xi_1 \\sin\\eta \\\\\nz &= \\sin\\xi_1 \\sin\\eta \\\\\nx &= \\cos\\xi_2 \\cos\\eta \\\\\ny &= \\sin\\xi_2 \\cos\\eta\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nBecause {{math|''u''<sup>2</sup> + ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> + ''z''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}, the points lie on the 3-sphere.\n\nIn 4D space, every rotation about the origin has two invariant planes which are completely orthogonal to each other and intersect at the origin, and are rotated by two independent angles {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}}. Without loss of generality, we can choose, respectively, the {{mvar|uz}}- and {{mvar|xy}}-planes as these invariant planes. A rotation in 4D of a point {{math|{''ξ''<sub>10</sub>, ''η''<sub>0</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>20</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}} through angles {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}} is then simply expressed in Hopf coordinates as {{math|{''ξ''<sub>10</sub> + ''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''η''<sub>0</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>20</sub> + ''ξ''<sub>2</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}}.\n\n==Visualization of 4D rotations==\n[[File:4DRotationTrajectories.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Trajectories of a point on the Clifford Torus:<br>Fig.1: simple rotations (black) and left and right isoclinic rotations (red and blue)<br>\nFig.2: a general rotation with angular displacements in a ratio of 1:5<br>\nFig.3: a general rotation with angular displacements in a ratio of 5:1<br>\nAll images are [[stereographic projection]]s.]]\n\nEvery rotation in 3D space has an invariant axis-line which is unchanged by the rotation. The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation about that axis. Without loss of generality, this axis may be chosen as the {{mvar|z}}-axis of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.\n\nIn 3D space, the [[spherical coordinates]] {{math|{''θ'', ''φ''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} may be seen as a parametric expression of the 2-sphere. For fixed {{mvar|θ}} they describe circles on the 2-sphere which are perpendicular to the {{mvar|z}}-axis and these circles may be viewed as trajectories of a point on the sphere. A point {{math|{''θ''<sub>0</sub>, ''φ''<sub>0</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}} on the sphere, under a rotation about the {{mvar|z}}-axis, will follow a trajectory {{math|{''θ''<sub>0</sub>, ''φ''<sub>0</sub> + ''φ''<nowiki>}</nowiki>}} as the angle {{mvar|φ}} varies. The trajectory may be viewed as a rotation parametric in time, where the angle of rotation is linear in time: {{math|''φ'' {{=}} ''ωt''}}, with {{mvar|ω}} being an \"angular velocity\".\n\nAnalogous to the 3D case, every rotation in 4D space has at least two invariant axis-planes which are left invariant by the rotation and are completely orthogonal (i.e. they intersect at a point). The rotation is completely specified by specifying the axis planes and the angles of rotation about them. Without loss of generality, these axis planes may be chosen to be the {{mvar|uz}}- and {{mvar|xy}}-planes of a Cartesian coordinate system, allowing a simpler visualization of the rotation.\n\nIn 4D space, the Hopf angles {{math|{''ξ''<sub>1</sub>, ''η'', ''ξ''<sub>2</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}} parameterize the 3-sphere. For fixed {{mvar|η}} they describe a torus parameterized by {{math|''ξ''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''ξ''<sub>2</sub>}}, with {{math|''η'' {{=}} {{sfrac|π|4}}}} being the special case of the [[Clifford torus]] in the {{mvar|xy}}- and {{mvar|uz}}-planes. These tori are not the usual tori found in 3D-space. While they are still 2D surfaces, they are embedded in the 3-sphere. The 3-sphere can be [[stereographic projection|stereographically]] projected onto the whole Euclidean 3D-space, and these tori are then seen as the usual tori of revolution. It can be seen that a point specified by {{math|{''ξ''<sub>10</sub>, ''η''<sub>0</sub>, ''ξ''<sub>20</sub><nowiki>}</nowiki>}} undergoing a rotation with the {{mvar|uz}}- and {{mvar|xy}}-planes invariant will remain on the torus specified by {{math|''η''<sub>0</sub>}}.<ref name=\"Pinkall\">{{cite journal |last=Pinkall |first=U. |date=1985 |title=Hopf tori in S<sub>3</sub> |url=https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/papers/pinkall.pdf |journal=Invent.

      "text": "{{Short description|Spherical linear interpolation in computer graphics}}In [[computer graphics]], '''Slerp''' is shorthand for '''s'''pherical '''l'''inear int'''erp'''olation, introduced by Ken Shoemake in the context of [[quaternion]] [[interpolation]] for the purpose of [[animation|animating]] 3D [[rotation]]. It refers to constant-speed motion along a unit-radius [[great circle]] arc, given the ends and an interpolation parameter between 0 and&nbsp;1.\n\n==Geometric Slerp==\nSlerp has a geometric formula independent of quaternions, and independent of the dimension of the space in which the arc is embedded. This formula, a symmetric weighted sum credited to Glenn Davis, is based on the fact that any point on the curve must be a [[linear combination]] of the ends. Let ''p''<sub>0</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub> be the first and last points of the arc, and let ''t'' be the parameter, 0&nbsp;≤&nbsp;''t''&nbsp;≤&nbsp;1. Compute Ω as the angle [[Subtended angle|subtended]] by the arc, so that {{nowrap|cos Ω &#61; ''p''<sub>0</sub> ∙ ''p''<sub>1</sub>}}, the ''n''-dimensional [[dot product]] of the unit vectors from the origin to the ends. The geometric formula is then\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Slerp}(p_0,p_1; t) = \\frac{\\sin {[(1-t)\\Omega}]}{\\sin \\Omega} p_0 + \\frac{\\sin [t\\Omega]}{\\sin \\Omega} p_1.</math>\n\nThe symmetry can be seen in the fact that {{nowrap|<math> \\mathrm{Slerp}(p_0,p_1; t)</math>}} = {{nowrap|<math> \\mathrm{Slerp}(p_1,p_0; 1-t)</math>}}. In the limit as Ω&nbsp;→&nbsp;0, this formula reduces to the corresponding symmetric formula for [[linear interpolation]],\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{Lerp}(p_0,p_1; t) = (1-t) p_0 + t p_1.\\,\\!</math>\n\nA Slerp path is, in fact, the spherical geometry equivalent of a path along a line segment in the plane; a great circle is a spherical [[geodesic]].\n\n[[Image:Slerp factor explanation.png|right|thumb|Oblique vector rectifies to Slerp factor.]]\nMore familiar than the general Slerp formula is the case when the end vectors are perpendicular, in which case the formula is {{nowrap|''p''<sub>0</sub> cos ''θ'' + ''p''<sub>1</sub> sin ''θ''}}. Letting {{nowrap|''θ'' &#61; ''t'' π/2}}, and applying the trigonometric identity {{nowrap|cos ''θ'' &#61; sin (π/2 − ''θ'')}}, this becomes the Slerp formula. The factor of {{nowrap|1/sin Ω}} in the general formula is a normalization, since a vector ''p''<sub>1</sub> at an angle of Ω to ''p''<sub>0</sub> projects onto the perpendicular ⊥''p''<sub>0</sub> with a length of only {{nowrap|sin Ω}}.\n\nSome special cases of Slerp admit more efficient calculation. When a circular arc is to be drawn into a raster image, the preferred method is some variation of [[Jack E. Bresenham|Bresenham's]] circle algorithm. Evaluation at the special parameter values 0 and 1 trivially yields ''p''<sub>0</sub> and ''p''<sub>1</sub>, respectively; and bisection, evaluation at&nbsp;½, simplifies to {{nowrap|(''p''<sub>0</sub> + ''p''<sub>1</sub>)/2}}, normalized. Another special case, common in animation, is evaluation with fixed ends and equal parametric steps. If ''p''<sub>''k''−1</sub> and ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> are two consecutive values, and if ''c'' is twice their dot product (constant for all steps), then the next value, ''p''<sub>''k''+1</sub>, is the reflection {{nowrap|''p''<sub>''k''+1</sub> &#61; ''c'' ''p''<sub>''k''</sub> − ''p''<sub>''k''−1</sub>}}.\n\n==Quaternion Slerp==\nWhen Slerp is applied to unit [[quaternion]]s, the quaternion path maps to a path through 3D rotations in a [[quaternions and spatial rotation|standard way]]. The effect is a rotation with uniform [[angular velocity]] around a fixed [[axis of rotation|rotation axis]]. When the initial end point is the identity quaternion, Slerp gives a segment of a [[one-parameter subgroup]] of both the [[Lie group]] of 3D rotations, [[SO(3)]], and its [[covering map|universal covering group]] of unit quaternions, [[3-sphere|S<sup>3</sup>]]. Slerp gives a straightest and shortest path between its quaternion end points, and maps to a rotation through an angle of 2Ω. However, because the covering is double (''q'' and −''q'' map to the same rotation), the rotation path may turn either the \"short way\" (less than 180°) or the \"long way\" (more than 180°). Long paths can be prevented by negating one end if the dot product, {{nowrap|cos Ω}}, is negative, thus ensuring that −90°&nbsp;≤&nbsp;Ω&nbsp;≤&nbsp;90°.\n\nSlerp also has expressions in terms of quaternion algebra, all using [[exponentiation]]. [[real numbers|Real]] powers of a quaternion are defined in terms of the quaternion [[exponential function]], written as {{nowrap|''e''<sup> ''q''</sup>}} and given by the [[power series]] equally familiar from calculus, complex analysis and matrix algebra:\n\n:<math> e^q = 1 + q + \\frac{q^2}{2} + \\frac{q^3}{6} + \\cdots + \\frac{q^n}{n!} + \\cdots .</math>\n\nWriting a unit quaternion ''q'' in [[versor]] form, {{nowrap|cos Ω + '''v''' sin Ω}}, with '''v''' a unit 3-vector, and noting that the quaternion square '''v'''<sup>2</sup> equals −1 (implying a quaternion version of [[Euler's formula]]), we have {{nowrap|''e''<sup> '''v''' Ω</sup> &#61; ''q''}}, and {{nowrap|''q''<sup> ''t''</sup> &#61; cos ''t'' Ω + '''v''' sin ''t'' Ω}}. The identification of interest is {{nowrap|''q'' &#61; ''q''<sub>1</sub> ''q''<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup>}}, so that the real part of ''q'' is {{nowrap|cos Ω}}, the same as the geometric dot product used above. Here are four equivalent quaternion expressions for Slerp.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{Slerp}(q_0, q_1, t) & = q_0 (q_0^{-1} q_1)^t \\\\[6pt]\n& = q_1 (q_1^{-1} q_0)^{1-t} \\\\[6pt]\n& = (q_0 q_1^{-1})^{1-t} q_1 \\\\[6pt]\n& = (q_1 q_0^{-1})^t q_0\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe [[derivative]] of {{nowrap|Slerp(''q''<sub>0</sub>, ''q''<sub>1</sub>; ''t'')}} with respect to ''t'', assuming the ends are fixed, is log(''q''<sub>1</sub>''q''<sub>0</sub><sup>−1</sup>) times the function value, where the quaternion [[natural logarithm]] in this case yields half the 3D [[angular velocity]] vector. The initial tangent vector is [[parallel transport]]ed to each tangent along the curve; thus the curve is, indeed, a geodesic.\n\nIn the [[tangent space]] at any point on a quaternion Slerp curve, the inverse of the [[exponential map (Riemannian geometry)|exponential map]] transforms the curve into a line segment. Slerp curves not extending through a point fail to transform into lines in that point's tangent space.\n\nQuaternion Slerps are commonly used to construct smooth animation curves by mimicking affine constructions like the [[de Casteljau's algorithm|de&nbsp;Casteljau algorithm]] for [[Bézier curve]]s. Since the sphere is not an [[affine space]], familiar properties of affine constructions may fail, though the constructed curves may otherwise be entirely satisfactory. For example, the de&nbsp;Casteljau algorithm may be used to split a curve in affine space; this does not work on a sphere.\n\nThe two-valued Slerp can be extended to interpolate among many unit quaternions, but the extension loses the [[time complexity|fixed execution-time]] of the Slerp algorithm.\n\n==Source code==\nThe below C++ code illustrates an implementation of the Slerp algorithm that handles some common edge cases.\n\n<source lang=\"c\">\nQuaternion slerp(Quaternion v0, Quaternion v1, double t) {\n    // Only unit quaternions are valid rotations.\n    // Normalize to avoid undefined behavior.\n    v0.normalize();\n    v1.normalize();\n\n    // Compute the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.\n    double dot = dot_product(v0, v1);\n\n    // If the dot product is negative, slerp won't take\n    // the shorter path.

Like the [[quaternion]]s introduced by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] in 1843, they form a four [[dimension]]al real [[vector space]] equipped with a multiplicative operation. Unlike the quaternion algebra, the split-quaternions contain nontrivial [[zero divisor]]s, [[nilpotent]] elements, and [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent]]s. (For example, {{nowrap|{{sfrac|1|2}}(1 + j)}} is an idempotent zero-divisor, and {{nowrap|i − j}} is nilpotent.) As a [[mathematical structure]], they form an [[algebra over a field|algebra over the real numbers]], which is [[ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the algebra of [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. For other names for split-quaternions see the [[#Synonyms|Synonyms]] section below.\n\nThe [[Set (mathematics)|set]] {1, i, j, k} forms a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. The products of these elements are\n:ij = k = −ji, \n:jk = −i = −kj, \n:ki = j = −ik,\n:i<sup>2</sup> = −1, \n:j<sup>2</sup> = +1, \n:k<sup>2</sup> = +1,\nand hence ijk = 1. It follows from the defining relations that the set {1, i, j, k, −1, −i, −j, −k} is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under coquaternion multiplication; it is [[isomorphic]] to the [[dihedral group]] D<sub>4</sub>, the [[Examples of groups#The symmetry group of a square: dihedral group of order 8|symmetry group of a square]].\n\nA coquaternion\n:''q'' = ''w'' + ''x''i + ''y''j + ''z''k, has a '''conjugate''' ''q''<sup>∗</sup> = ''w'' − ''x''i − ''y''j − ''z''k.\n\nDue to the [[anti-commutative property]] of its basis vectors, the product of a coquaternion with its conjugate is given by an [[isotropic quadratic form]]:\n:<math>N(q) = q q^* = w^2 + x^2 - y^2 - z^2 .</math>\nGiven two coquaterions ''p'' and ''q'', one has {{nowrap|1=''N''(''p q'') = ''N''(''p'') ''N''(''q'')}}, showing that ''N'' is a quadratic form admitting composition. This algebra is a [[composition algebra]] and ''N'' is its '''norm'''. Any {{nowrap|''q'' ≠ 0}} such that {{nowrap|1=''N''(''q'') = 0}} is a [[null vector]], and its presence means that coquaternions form a \"split composition algebra\", and hence a coquaternion is also called a '''split quaternion'''.\n\nWhen the norm is non-zero, then ''q'' has a [[multiplicative inverse]], namely ''q''<sup>∗</sup>/''N''(''q'').  The set\n\n:''U'' = {''q'' : ''qq''<sup>∗</sup> ≠ 0}\n\nis the set of [[unit (ring theory)|units]]. The set '''P''' of all coquaternions forms a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] {{nowrap|('''P''', +, •)}} with [[group of units]] {{nowrap|(''U'', •)}}. The coquaternions with {{nowrap|1=''N''(''q'') = 1}} form a [[compact space|non-compact]] [[topological group]] {{nowrap|SU(1, 1)}}, shown below to be isomorphic to {{nowrap|[[SL2(R)|SL(2, '''R''')]]}}.\n\nHistorically coquaternions preceded [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]]'s matrix algebra; coquaternions (along with quaternions and [[tessarine]]s) evoked the broader [[linear algebra]].\n\n==Matrix representations==\nLet ''q'' = ''w'' + ''x''i + ''y''j + ''z''k, \nand consider ''u'' = ''w'' + ''x''i, and ''v'' = ''y'' + ''z''i as ordinary [[complex number]]s with [[complex conjugate]]s denoted by ''u''<sup>∗</sup> = ''w'' − ''x''i,&nbsp; ''v''<sup>∗</sup> = ''y'' − ''z''i. Then the complex matrix\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}u & v \\\\ v^* & u^* \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n[[linear representation|represents]] ''q'' in the ring of matrices: the multiplication of split-quaternions behaves the same way as the [[matrix multiplication]].  For example, the [[determinant]] of this matrix is\n:''uu''<sup>∗</sup> − ''vv''<sup>∗</sup> = ''qq''<sup>∗</sup>.\n\nThe appearance of the minus sign distinguishes coquaternions from quaternions ℍ which has a plus sign.  The use of the split-quaternions of norm one (''qq''* = 1) for [[hyperbolic motion#Disk model motions|hyperbolic motions]] of the [[Poincaré disk model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]] is one of the great utilities of the algebra.\n\nBesides the complex matrix representation, another linear representation associates coquaternions with [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. This isomorphism can be made explicit as follows: Note first the product\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nand that the square of each factor on the left is the identity matrix, while the square of the right hand side is the negative of the identity matrix. Furthermore, note that these three matrices, together with the identity matrix, form a basis for M(2, '''R'''). One can make the matrix product above correspond to {{nowrap|1=jk = −i}}  in the coquaternion ring.

This angle can be viewed, in the plane [[tangent]] to the counter-sphere at ''r'', by projection:\n\n:<math>\\tan \\phi = \\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{\\sinh b}{\\sinh a ~\\cosh b} = \\frac{\\tanh b}{\\sinh a}</math>.

The parameter ''θ'' determining the meridian varies over the [[unit circle|''S''<sup>1</sup>]]. Thus the counter-sphere appears as the [[manifold]] ''S''<sup>1</sup> × H<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==Application to kinematics==\n\nBy using the foundations given above, one can show that the mapping\n:<math>q \\mapsto u^{-1}q u </math>\nis an ordinary or hyperbolic rotation according as\n:<math>u = e^{av} ,\\quad v \\in I \\quad \\text{or}\\quad u = e^{ap} ,\\quad p \\in J </math>.\n\nThe  collection of these mappings bears some relation to the [[Lorentz group]] since it is also  composed of ordinary and hyperbolic rotations. Among the peculiarities of this approach  to relativistic kinematic is the [[anisotropic]] profile, say as compared to [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s.\n\nReluctance to use coquaternions for kinematic models may stem from the {{nowrap|(2, 2)}} signature when [[spacetime]] is presumed to have signature {{nowrap|(1, 3)}} or {{nowrap|(3, 1)}}. Nevertheless, a transparently relativistic [[kinematics]] appears when a point of the  counter-sphere is used to represent an [[inertial frame of reference]]. Indeed, if {{nowrap|1=''tt''<sup>∗</sup> = −1}}, then there is a {{nowrap|1=''p'' = i sinh(''a'') + ''r'' cosh(''a'') ∈ ''J''}} such that {{nowrap|''t'' ∈ ''D''<sub>''p''</sub>}}, and a {{nowrap|''b'' ∈ ''R''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''t'' = ''p'' exp(''bp'')}}. Then if {{nowrap|1=''u'' = exp(''bp'')}}, {{nowrap|1=''v'' = i cosh(''a'') + ''r'' sinh(''a'')}}, and {{nowrap|1=''s'' = i''r''}}, the set {{nowrap|{''t'', ''u'', ''v'', ''s''} }} is a pan-orthogonal basis stemming from ''t'', and the orthogonalities persist through applications of the ordinary or hyperbolic rotations.\n\n==Historical notes==\n\nThe coquaternions were initially introduced (under that name)<ref>[[James Cockle]] (1849), [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/20114#page/448/mode/1up On Systems of Algebra involving more than one Imaginary], ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'' (series 3) 35: 434,5, link from [[Biodiversity Heritage Library]]</ref> in 1849 by [[James Cockle]] in the London&ndash;Edinburgh&ndash;Dublin [[Philosophical Magazine]].

      "text": "{{about|the quaternions of norm one}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''versor''' is a [[quaternion]] of [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] one (a ''unit quaternion'').\n\nEach versor has the form\n:<math>q = \\exp(a\\mathbf{r}) = \\cos a + \\mathbf{r} \\sin a, \\quad \\mathbf{r}^2 = -1, \\quad a \\in [0,\\pi],</math>\nwhere the '''r'''<sup>2</sup> = −1 condition means that '''r''' is a unit-length vector quaternion (or that the first component of '''r''' is zero, and the last three components of '''r''' are a [[unit vector]] in 3 dimensions). In case {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} &pi;/2}}, the versor is termed a '''right versor'''.\n\nThe corresponding [[three-dimensional space|3-dimensional]] rotation has the angle {{num|2}}''a'' about the axis '''r''' in [[axis–angle representation]].\n\nThe word is derived from Latin ''versare'' = \"to turn\" with the suffix ''-or'' forming a noun from the verb (i.e. ''versor'' = \"the turner\"). It was introduced by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in the context of his quaternion theory.\n\n==Presentation on 3- and 2-spheres==\n[[Image:Spherical triangle.svg|thumb|right|arc ''AB'' + arc ''BC'' = arc ''AC'']]\nHamilton denoted the '''versor''' of a quaternion ''q'' by the symbol '''U'''''q''. He was then able to display the general quaternion in [[polar decomposition#Quaternion polar decomposition|polar coordinate form]]\n: ''q'' = '''T'''''q'' '''U'''''q'',\nwhere '''T'''''q'' is the norm of ''q''. The norm of a versor is always equal to one; hence they occupy the unit [[3-sphere]] in '''H'''. Examples of versors include the eight elements of the [[quaternion group]]. Of particular importance are the [[Classical Hamiltonian quaternions#Right versor|right versors]], which have [[right angle|angle π/2]]. These versors have zero scalar part, and so are [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] of length one (unit vectors). The right versors form a [[quaternion#Square roots of −1|sphere of square roots of &minus;1]] in the quaternion algebra. The generators ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' are examples of right versors, as well as their [[additive inverse]]s. Other versors include the twenty-four [[Hurwitz quaternion]]s that have the norm 1 and form vertices of a [[24-cell]] polychoron.<!-- Only a Hurwitz quaternion that belongs to the quaternion group can be a right versor (follows from the definition in coordinates) -->\n\nHamilton defined a quaternion as the quotient of two vectors. A versor can be defined as the quotient of two unit vectors. For any fixed [[plane (geometry)|plane]] Π the quotient of two unit vectors lying in Π depends only on the [[angle]] (directed) between them, the same ''a'' as in the unit vector–angle representation of a versor explained above. That's why it may be natural to understand corresponding versors as directed [[arc (geometry)|arcs]] <!--(or [[line segment]]s with respect to the [[spherical geometry]])--> that connect pairs of unit vectors and lie on a [[great circle]] formed by intersection of Π with the [[unit sphere]], where the plane Π passes through the origin. Arcs of the same direction and length (or, the same, [[arc (geometry)#Length of an arc of a circle|its subtended angle]] in [[radian]]s) are [[equivalence relation|equivalent]], i.e. define the same versor.\n\nSuch an arc, although lying in the [[three-dimensional space]], does not represent a path of a point rotating as described with the sandwiched product with the versor. Indeed, it represents the left multiplication action of the versor on quaternions that preserves the plane Π and the corresponding great circle of 3-vectors. The 3-dimensional rotation defined by the versor has the angle two times the arc's subtended angle, and preserves the same plane. It is a rotation about the corresponding vector '''r''', that is [[perpendicular]] to Π.\n\nOn three unit vectors, Hamilton writes<ref>''Elements of Quaternions'', 2nd edition, v. 1, p. 146</ref>\n: <math>q = \\beta: \\alpha = OB:OA \\ </math> and\n: <math>q' = \\gamma:\\beta = OC:OB </math>\nimply\n: <math> q' q = \\gamma:\\alpha = OC:OA . </math>\n\nMultiplication of quaternions of norm one corresponds to the (non-commutative) \"addition\" of great circle arcs on the unit sphere. Any pair of great circles either is the same circle or has two [[intersection point]]s. Hence, one can always move the point ''B'' and the corresponding vector to one of these points such that the beginning of the second arc will be the same as the end of the first arc.\n\nAn equation\n: <math>\\exp(c\\mathbf{r}) \\exp(a\\mathbf{s}) = \\exp(b\\mathbf{t}) \\!</math>\nimplicitly specifies the unit vector–angle representation for the product of two versors. Its solution is an instance of the general [[Campbell–Baker–Hausdorff formula]] in [[Lie group]] theory. As the 3-sphere represented by versors in ℍ is a 3-parameter Lie group, practice with versor compositions is a step into [[Lie theory]]. Evidently versors are the image of the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] applied to a ball of radius &pi; in the quaternion subspace of vectors.\n\nVersors compose as aforementioned vector arcs, and Hamilton referred to this [[group (mathematics)|group operation]] as \"the sum of arcs\", but as quaternions they simply multiply.\n\nThe geometry of [[elliptic space]] has been described as the space of versors.<ref>[[H.

The versors are the points of this elliptic space, though they refer to [[rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space]]. Given two fixed versors ''u'' and ''v'', the mapping <math>q \\mapsto u q v</math> is an ''elliptic motion''. If one of the fixed versors is 1, then the motion is a ''Clifford translation'' of the elliptic space, named after [[W. K. Clifford]] who was a proponent of the space. An elliptic line through versor ''u'' is <math>\\{ u e^{a r} : 0 \\le a < \\pi \\} .</math> Parallelism in the space is expressed by [[Clifford parallel]]s. One of the methods of viewing elliptic space uses the [[Cayley transform]] to map the versors to ℝ<sup>3</sup>\n\n==Hyperbolic versor==\nA hyperbolic versor is a generalization of quaternionic versors to [[indefinite orthogonal group]]s, such as [[Lorentz group]].\nIt is defined as a quantity of the form\n:<math>\\exp(ar) = \\cosh a + \\mathbf{r} \\sinh a</math> where <math>\\lVert \\mathbf{r} \\rVert = 1.</math>\nSuch elements arise in algebras of [[metric signature|mixed signature]], for example [[split-complex number]]s or [[split-quaternion]]s. It was the algebra of [[tessarines]] discovered by [[James Cockle (lawyer)|James Cockle]] in 1848 that first provided hyperbolic versors. In fact, James Cockle wrote the above equation (with '''{{math|j}}''' in place of '''{{math|r}}''') when he found that the tessarines included the new type of imaginary element.\n\nThis versor was used by [[Homersham Cox (mathematician)|Homersham Cox]] (1882/83) in relation to quaternion multiplication.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cox, H.|year=1883|orig-year=1882|title=On the Application of Quaternions and Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre to different kinds of Uniform Space|journal=[[Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society]]|volume=13|pages=69–143|url=https://archive.org/details/transactions13camb/page/68}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=Cox, H.|year=1883|orig-year=1882|title=On the Application of Quaternions and Grassmann's Ausdehnungslehre to different kinds of Uniform Space|journal=Proc.

Westerman, New York, weblink from [[archive.org]]</ref> He saw the modelling power of hyperbolic versors operating on the split-complex number plane, and in 1891 he introduced [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s to extend the concept to 4-space. Problems in that algebra led to use of [[biquaternion]]s after 1900. In a widely circulated review of 1899, Macfarlane said:\n:…the root of a quadratic equation may be versor in nature or scalar in nature. If it is versor in nature, then the part affected by the radical involves the axis perpendicular to the plane of reference, and this is so, whether the radical involves the square root of minus one or not. In the former case the versor is circular, in the latter hyperbolic.<ref>[[Science (journal)|Science]], 9:326 (1899)</ref>\nToday the concept of a [[one-parameter group]] subsumes the concepts of versor and hyperbolic versor as the terminology of [[Sophus Lie]] has replaced that of Hamilton and Macfarlane.\nIn particular, for each '''{{math|r}}''' such that {{nowrap|'''{{math|r r}}''' {{=}} +1}} or {{nowrap|'''{{math|r r}}''' {{=}} &minus;1}}, the mapping <math>a \\mapsto \\exp(a\\,\\mathbf{r})</math> takes the [[Real line#In real algebras|real line]] to a group of hyperbolic or ordinary versors. In the ordinary case, when '''{{math|r}}''' and '''&minus;{{math|r}}''' are [[antipodal point|antipodes]] on a sphere, the one-parameter groups have the same points but are oppositely directed. In physics, this aspect of [[rotational symmetry]] is termed a [[Doublet (physics)|doublet]].\n\nIn 1911 [[Alfred Robb]] published his ''Optical Geometry of Motion'' in which he identified the parameter [[rapidity]] which specifies a change in [[frame of reference]]. This rapidity parameter corresponds to the real variable in a one-parameter group of hyperbolic versors. With the further development of [[special relativity]] the action of a hyperbolic versor came to be called a [[Lorentz boost]].\n\n==Lie theory==\n{{main|Lie theory}}\n[[Sophus Lie]] was less that a year old when Hamilton first described quaternions, but Lie's name has become associated with all groups generated by exponentiation. The set of versors with their multiplication has been denoted Sl(1,q) by Robert Gilmore in his text on Lie theory.<ref name=RG>Robert Gilmore (1974) ''Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and some of their Applications'', chapter 5: Some simple examples, pages 120–35, [[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] {{ISBN|0-471-30179-5}}   Gilmore denotes the real, complex, and quaternion division algebras by r, c, and q, rather than the more common R, C, and H.</ref> Sl(1,q) is the [[special linear group]] of one dimension over quaternions, the \"special\" indicating that all elements are of norm one. The group is isomorphic to SU(2,c), a [[special unitary group]], a frequently used designation since quaternions and versors are sometimes considered anachronistic for group theory. The [[rotation group SO(3)|special orthogonal group SO(3,r) of rotations in three dimensions]] is closely related: it is a 2:1 homomorphic image of SU(2,c).\n\nThe subspace <math>\\{x i + y j + z k: x, y, z \\in R \\} \\subset H </math> is called the [[Lie algebra]] of the group of versors. The commutator product <math>[u , v] = uv - vu \\ ,</math> just double the [[cross product]] of two vectors, forms the multiplication in the Lie algebra. The close relation to SU(1,c) and SO(3,r) is evident in the isomorphism of their Lie algebras.<ref name=RG/>\n\nLie groups that contain hyperbolic versors include the group on the [[unit hyperbola]] and the special unitary group [[SU(1,1)]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quaternions and spatial rotation]]\n*[[Rotations in 4-dimensional Euclidean space]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[William Rowan Hamilton]] (1844 to 1850) [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/OnQuat/ On quaternions or a new system of imaginaries in algebra], [[Philosophical Magazine]], link to David R.

(For a description of this homomorphism see the article on [[quaternions and spatial rotation]]s.)\n\n==Elements==\n\nExplicitly, the binary icosahedral group is given as the union of the 24 [[Hurwitz unit]]s\n:<math>\\{ \\pm 1, \\pm i, \\pm j, \\pm k, ( \\pm 1 \\pm i \\pm j \\pm k )/2 \\}</math>\nwith all 96 quaternions obtained from\n:<math> ( 0 \\pm i \\pm \\varphi^{-1}j \\pm \\varphi k )/2</math>\nby an [[even permutation]] of all the four coordinates 0, 1, ''φ''<sup>−1</sup>, ''φ'', and with all possible sign combinations. Here ''φ'' = (1 + {{radic|5}})/2 is the [[golden ratio]].\n\nIn total there are 120 elements, namely the unit [[icosian]]s. They all have unit magnitude and therefore lie in the unit quaternion group Sp(1). The [[convex hull]] of these 120 elements in 4-dimensional space form a [[regular 4-polytope]], known as the [[600-cell]].\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Central extension===\nThe binary icosahedral group, denoted by 2''I'', is the [[universal perfect central extension]] of the icosahedral group, and thus is [[quasisimple]]: it is a perfect central extension of a simple group.\n\nExplicitly, it fits into the [[short exact sequence]]\n:<math>1\\to\\{\\pm 1\\}\\to 2I\\to I \\to 1.\\,</math>\nThis sequence does not [[split exact sequence|split]], meaning that 2''I'' is ''not'' a [[semidirect product]] of { ±1 } by ''I''. In fact, there is no subgroup of 2''I'' isomorphic to ''I''.\n\nThe [[center of a group|center]] of 2''I'' is the subgroup { ±1 }, so that the [[inner automorphism group]] is isomorphic to ''I''. The full [[automorphism group]] is isomorphic to ''S''<sub>5</sub> (the [[symmetric group]] on 5 letters), just as for <math>I\\cong A_5</math> - any automorphism of 2''I'' fixes the non-trivial element of the center (<math>-1</math>), hence descends to an automorphism of ''I,'' and conversely, any automorphism of ''I'' lifts to an automorphism of 2''I,'' since the lift of generators of ''I'' are generators of 2''I'' (different lifts give the same automorphism).\n\n===Superperfect===\nThe binary icosahedral group is [[perfect group|perfect]], meaning that it is equal to its [[commutator subgroup]]. In fact, 2''I'' is the unique perfect group of order 120. It follows that 2''I'' is not [[solvable group|solvable]].\n\nFurther, the binary icosahedral group is [[superperfect group|superperfect]], meaning abstractly that its first two [[group homology]] groups vanish: <math>H_1(2I;\\mathbf{Z})\\cong H_2(2I;\\mathbf{Z})\\cong 0.</math> Concretely, this means that its abelianization is trivial (it has no non-trivial abelian quotients) and that its [[Schur multiplier]] is trivial (it has no non-trivial perfect central extensions). In fact, the binary icosahedral group is the smallest (non-trivial) superperfect group.\n\nThe binary icosahedral group is not [[acyclic group|acyclic]], however, as H<sub>''n''</sub>(2''I'','''Z''') is cyclic of order 120 for ''n'' = 4''k''+3, and trivial for ''n'' &gt; 0 otherwise, {{harv|Adem|Milgram|1994|p=279}}.\n\n===Isomorphisms===\nConcretely, the binary icosahedral group is a subgroup of Spin(3), and covers the icosahedral group, which is a subgroup of SO(3). Abstractly, the icosahedral group is isomorphic to the symmetries of the 4-[[simplex]], which is a subgroup of SO(4), and the binary icosahedral group is isomorphic to the double cover of this in Spin(4). Note that the symmetric group <math>S_5</math> ''does'' have a 4-dimensional representation (its usual lowest-dimensional irreducible representation as the full symmetries of the <math>(n-1)</math>-simplex), and that the full symmetries of the 4-simplex are thus <math>S_5,</math> not the full icosahedral group (these are two different groups of order 120).\n\nThe binary icosahedral group can be considered as the [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups|double cover of the alternating group]] <math>A_5,</math> denoted <math>2\\cdot A_5 \\cong 2I;</math> this isomorphism covers the isomorphism of the icosahedral group with the alternating group <math>A_5 \\cong I,</math>.\nJust as <math>I</math> is a discrete subgroup of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(3)</math>, <math>2I</math> is a discrete subgroup of the double over of <math>\\mathrm{SO}(3)</math>, namely <math>\\mathrm{Spin}(3) \\cong \\mathrm{SU}(2)</math>.  The 2-1 homomorphism from <math>\\mathrm{Spin}(3)</math> to <math>\\mathrm{SO}(3)</math> then restricts to the 2-1 homomorphism from <math>2I</math> to <math>I</math>.  Similarly,\n<math>S_5</math> is a discrete subgroup of <math>O(3)</math>, and its two double covers are discrete subgroups of the two [[Pin group|Pin groups]] <math>\\mathrm{Pin}^{\\pm}(3)</math>.\n\nOne can show that the binary icosahedral group is isomorphic to the [[special linear group]] SL(2,5) &mdash; the group of all 2&times;2 matrices over the [[finite field]] '''F'''<sub>5</sub> with unit determinant; this covers the [[Alternating group#Exceptional isomorphisms|exceptional isomorphism]] of <math>I\\cong A_5</math> with the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,5).\n<!-- Is there any geometric meaning to this isomorphism? -->\n\nNote also the exceptional isomorphism <math>PGL(2,5) \\cong S_5,</math> which is a different group of order 120, with the commutative square of SL, GL, PSL, PGL being isomorphic to a commutative square of <math>2\\cdot A_5, 2\\cdot S_5, A_5, S_5,</math> which are isomorphic to subgroups of the commutative square of Spin(4), Pin(4), SO(4), O(4).\n\n===Presentation===\n\nThe group 2''I'' has a [[group presentation|presentation]] given by\n:<math>\\langle r,s,t \\mid r^2 = s^3 = t^5 = rst \\rangle</math>\nor equivalently,\n:<math>\\langle s,t \\mid (st)^2 = s^3 = t^5 \\rangle.</math>\nGenerators with these relations are given by\n:<math>s = \\tfrac{1}{2}(1+i+j+k) \\qquad t = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\varphi+\\varphi^{-1}i+j).</math>\n\n===Subgroups===\n\nThe only proper [[normal subgroup]] of 2''I'' is the center { ±1 }.\n\nBy the [[third isomorphism theorem]], there is a [[Galois connection]] between subgroups of 2''I'' and subgroups of ''I'', where the [[closure operator]] on subgroups of 2''I'' is multiplication by { ±1 }.\n\n<math>-1</math> is the only element of order 2, hence it is contained in all subgroups of even order: thus every subgroup of 2''I'' is either of odd order or is the preimage of a subgroup of ''I''.\nBesides the [[cyclic group]]s generated by the various elements (which can have odd order), the only other subgroups of 2''I'' (up to conjugation) are:<ref><math>SL_2(\\mathbb F_5)</math> on [http://groupnames.org/index.html#?120,5 GroupNames]</ref>\n\n* [[binary dihedral group]]s of orders 12 and 20 (covering the dihedral groups ''D''<sub>3</sub> and ''D''<sub>5</sub> in ''I'').\n* The [[quaternion group]] consisting of the 8 [[Lipschitz unit]]s forms a subgroup of [[index (group theory)|index]] 15, which is also the [[dicyclic group]] Dic<sub>2</sub>; this covers the stabilizer of an edge.\n* The 24 [[Hurwitz unit]]s form an index 5 subgroup called the [[binary tetrahedral group]]; this covers a chiral [[tetrahedral group]]. This group is [[self-normalizing]] so its [[conjugacy class]] has 5 members (this gives a map <math>2I \\to S_5</math> whose image is <math>A_5</math>).\n\n==Relation to 4-dimensional symmetry groups==\n\nThe 4-dimensional analog of the [[Icosahedral symmetry|icosahedral symmetry group]] ''I''<sub>h</sub> is the symmetry group of the [[600-cell]] (also that of its dual, the [[120-cell]]). Just as the former is the [[Coxeter group]] of type ''H''<sub>3</sub>, the latter is the Coxeter group of type ''H''<sub>4</sub>, also denoted [3,3,5]. Its rotational subgroup, denoted [[Coxeter notation#Rank four groups|[3,3,5]<sup>+</sup>]] is a group of order 7200 living in [[SO(4)]]. SO(4) has a [[Double covering group|double cover]] called [[Spin group|Spin(4)]] in much the same way that Spin(3) is the double cover of SO(3). Similar to the isomorphism Spin(3) = Sp(1), the group Spin(4) is isomorphic to Sp(1) &times; Sp(1).\n\nThe preimage of [3,3,5]<sup>+</sup> in Spin(4) (a four-dimensional analogue of 2''I'') is precisely the [[direct product of groups|product group]] 2''I'' &times; 2''I'' of order 14400. The rotational symmetry group of the 600-cell is then\n:[3,3,5]<sup>+</sup> = ( 2''I'' &times; 2''I'' ) / { ±1 }.\n\nVarious other 4-dimensional symmetry groups can be constructed from 2''I''. For details, see (Conway and Smith, 2003).\n\n==Applications==\n\nThe [[coset space]] Spin(3) / 2''I'' = ''S''<sup>3</sup> / 2''I'' is a [[spherical 3-manifold]] called the [[Poincaré homology sphere]]. It is an example of a [[homology sphere]], i.e. a 3-manifold whose [[homology group]]s are identical to those of a [[3-sphere]]. The [[fundamental group]] of the Poincaré sphere is isomorphic to the binary icosahedral group, as the Poincaré sphere is the quotient of a 3-sphere by the binary icosahedral group.\n\n==See also==\n*[[binary polyhedral group]]\n*[[binary cyclic group]]\n*[[binary dihedral group]]\n*[[binary tetrahedral group]]\n*[[binary octahedral group]]\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation | last1=Adem | first1=Alejandro|author1-link= Alejandro Adem | last2=Milgram | first2=R.

In this way, conjugation defines a ''[[norm (mathematics)|norm]]'', making the complex numbers a [[normed vector space]] over the real numbers:  the norm of a complex number&nbsp;''z'' is\n\n: <math>|z| = (z^* z)^{1/2}.\\,</math>\n\nFurthermore, for any non-zero complex number&nbsp;''z'', conjugation gives a [[inverse element|multiplicative inverse]],\n\n: <math>z^{-1} = {z^* / |z|^2}.\\,</math>\n\nAs a complex number consists of two independent real numbers, they form a 2-dimensional [[vector space]] over the real numbers.\n\nBesides being of higher dimension, the complex numbers can be said to lack one algebraic property of the real numbers: a real number is its own conjugate.\n\n== Quaternions ==\n{{main|Quaternion}}\nThe next step in the construction is to generalize the multiplication and conjugation operations.\n\nForm ordered pairs <math>(a, b)</math> of complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, with multiplication defined by\n\n: <math>(a, b) (c, d)\n  = (a c - d^* b, d a + b c^*).\\,</math>\n\nSlight variations on this formula are possible; the resulting constructions will yield structures identical up to the signs of bases.\n\nThe order of the factors seems odd now, but will be important in the next step.\n\nDefine the conjugate <math>(a, b)^*\\,</math> of <math>(a, b)</math> by\n\n: <math>(a, b)^* = (a^*, -b).\\,</math>\n\nThese operators are direct extensions of their complex analogs:  if <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are taken from the real subset of complex numbers, the appearance of the conjugate in the formulas has no effect, so the operators are the same as those for the complex numbers.\n\nThe product of a nonzero element with its conjugate is a non-negative real number:\n\n: <math>(a, b)^* (a, b)\n  = (a^*, -b) (a, b)\n  = (a^* a + b^* b, b a^* - b a^*)\n  = (|a|^2 + |b|^2, 0 ).\\,</math>\n\nAs before, the conjugate thus yields a norm and an inverse for any such ordered pair.  So in the sense we explained above, these pairs constitute an algebra something like the real numbers.  They are the [[quaternions]], named by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] in 1843.\n\nAs a quaternion consists of two independent complex numbers, they form a 4-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.\n\nThe multiplication of quaternions is not quite like the multiplication of real numbers, though. It is not [[commutative]], that is, if <math>p</math> and <math>q</math> are quaternions, it is not always true that <math>p q = q p</math>, but it is true that <math>p q = (q p)'</math>, where <math>(a, b)' = (a, -b)</math>.\n\n== Octonions ==\n{{main|Octonion}}\nAll the steps to create further algebras are the same from octonions on.\n\nThis time, form ordered pairs <math>(p, q)</math> of\nquaternions <math>p</math> and <math>q</math>, with multiplication and conjugation defined exactly as for the quaternions:\n: <math>(p, q) (r, s)\n  = (p r - s^* q, s p + q r^*).\\,</math>\n\nNote, however, that because the quaternions are not commutative, the order of the factors in the multiplication formula becomes important—if the last factor in the multiplication formula were <math>r^*q</math> rather than\n<math>qr^*</math>, the formula for multiplication of an element by its conjugate would not yield a real number.\n\nFor exactly the same reasons as before, the conjugation operator yields a norm and a multiplicative inverse of any nonzero element.\n\nThis algebra was discovered by [[John T. Graves]] in 1843, and is called the [[octonions]] or the \"[[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] numbers\".\n\nAs an octonion consists of two independent quaternions, they form an 8-dimensional vector space over the real numbers.\n\nThe multiplication of octonions is even stranger than that of quaternions.  Besides being non-commutative, it is not [[associative]]: that is, if <math>p</math>, <math>q</math>, and <math>r</math> are octonions, it is not always true that\n:<math>(p q) r = p (q r).\\ </math>\n\nFor the reason of this non-associativity, octonions have [[Octonion#Properties|no matrix representation]].\n\n== Further algebras ==\n\nThe algebra immediately following the octonions is called the [[sedenion]]s.  It retains an algebraic property called [[power associativity]], meaning that if <math>s</math> is a sedenion, <math>s^n s^m = s^{n + m}</math>, but loses the property of being an [[alternative algebra]] and hence cannot be a [[composition algebra]].\n\nThe Cayley–Dickson construction can be carried on ''[[ad infinitum]]'', at each step producing a power-associative algebra whose dimension is double that of the algebra of the preceding step.  All the algebras generated in this way over a field are ''quadratic'': that is, each element satisfies a quadratic equation with coefficients from the field.<ref name=Sch66/>{{rp|50}}\n\nIn 1954 R. D. Schafer examined the algebras generated by the Cayley-Dickson process over a field ''F'' and showed they satisfy the [[flexible identity]].<ref>Richard D. Schafer (1954) \"On the algebras formed by the Cayley-Dickson process\", [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 76: 435–46 {{doi|10.2307/2372583}}</ref> He also proved that any [[derivation algebra]] of a Cayley-Dickson algebra is isomorphic to the derivation algebra of Cayley numbers, a 14-dimensional [[Lie algebra]] over ''F''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n== Modified Cayley–Dickson construction ==\nThe Cayley–Dickson construction, starting from the real numbers ℝ, generates [[division algebra|division]] composition algebras. There are also composition algebras with [[isotropic quadratic form]]s that are obtained through a slight modification, by replacing the minus sign in the definition of the product of ordered pairs with a plus sign, as follows:\n\n: <math>(a, b) (c, d)\n  = (a c + d^* b, d a + b c^*).\\,</math>\n\nWhen this modified construction is applied to ℝ, one obtains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are [[ring isomorphism|ring-isomorphic]] to the direct sum ℝ ⊕ ℝ (also written <sup>2</sup>ℝ); following that, one obtains the [[split-quaternion]]s, isomorphic to '''M'''<sub>2</sub>(ℝ); and the [[split-octonion]]s, which are isomorphic to [[Split-octonion#Zorn's vector-matrix algebra|Zorn(ℝ)]]. Applying the original Cayley–Dickson construction to the split-complexes also results in the split-quaternions and then the split-octonions.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{ISBN|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\n== General Cayley–Dickson construction ==\n{{harvtxt|Albert|1942|p= 171}} gave a slight generalization, defining the product and involution on ''B''=''A''⊕''A'' for ''A'' an [[*-algebra|algebra with involution]] (with (''xy'')<sup>*</sup> = ''y''<sup>*</sup>''x''<sup>*</sup>) to be \n: <math>(p, q) (r, s)\n  = (p r - \\gamma s^* q, s p + q r^*)\\,</math>\n:<math>(p, q)^* = (p^*, -q)\\ </math>\nfor  γ an additive map that commutes with * and left and right multiplication by any element.

Hamilton's ''tensor'' is actually the [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] on the quaternion algebra, which makes it a [[normed vector space]].\nHamilton defined ''tensor'' as a positive numerical quantity, or, more properly, signless number.<ref>{{\ngoogle books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 57|1-PA57}}</ref><ref>{{\ngoogle books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1881 pg 5|5}}</ref><ref>{{\ngoogle books|CGZLAAAAMAAJ|Tait 1890 pg.31 explains Hamilton's older definition of a tensor as a positive number|31}}</ref> A tensor can be thought of as a positive scalar.<ref>{{\ngoogle books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1989 pg 165, refers to a tensor as a positive scalar.|165}}</ref> The \"tensor\" can be thought of as representing a \"stretching factor.\"<ref>{{\ngoogle books|Tait (1890), pg 32|31}}</ref>\n\nHamilton introduced the term '''tensor''' in his first book, Lectures on Quaternions, based on lectures he gave shortly after his invention of the quaternions:\n*''it seems convenient to enlarge by definition the signification of the new word tensor, so as to render it capable of including also those other cases in which we operate on a line by diminishing instead of increasing its length ; and generally by altering that length in any definite ratio. We shall thus (as was hinted at the end of the article in question) have fractional and even [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] tensors, which will simply be numerical multipliers, and will all be '''positive''' or (to speak more properly) '''SignLess Numbers''', that is, '''unclothed with the algebraic signs of positive and negative''' ; because, in the operation here considered, we abstract from the directions (as well as from the situations) of the lines which are compared or operated on.''\n\nEach quaternion has a tensor, which is a measure of its magnitude (in the same way as the length of a vector is a measure of a vectors' magnitude). When a quaternion is defined as the quotient of two vectors, its tensor is the ratio of the lengths of these vectors.\n\n===Versor===\n{{main|versor}}\nA versor is a quaternion with a tensor of 1.

This norm was adopted as suggested from the theory of numbers, however to quote Hamilton \"they will not often be wanted\". The tensor is generally of greater utility.

Hamilton demonstrated that there had to be additional roots of this equation in addition to the geometrically real roots. Given the existence of the imaginary scalar, a number of expressions can be written and given proper names. All of these were part of Hamilton's original quaternion calculus.

The scalar part of a biquaternion is then a complex number called a '''biscalar'''. The vector part of a biquaternion is a [[bivector (complex)|bivector]] consisting of three complex components. The biquaternions are then the [[complexification]] of the original (real) quaternions.\n\n===Other double quaternions===\nHamilton invented the term ''associative'' to distinguish between the imaginary scalar (known by now as a [[complex number]]) which is both commutative and associative, and four other possible roots of negative unity which he designated L, M, N and O, mentioning them briefly in appendix B of ''Lectures on Quaternions'' and in private letters. However, non-associative roots of minus one do not appear in ''Elements of Quaternions''.

They find uses in both theoretical and applied mathematics, in particular for calculations involving three-dimensional rotations.\n\n== Hamilton's discovery ==\nIn 1843, Hamilton knew that the [[complex number]]s could be viewed as [[point (geometry)|point]]s in a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and that they could be added and multiplied together using certain geometric operations.  Hamilton sought to find a way to do the same for points in [[space]]. Points in space can be represented by their coordinates, which are triples of numbers and have an obvious addition, but Hamilton had difficulty defining the appropriate multiplication.\n\nAccording to a letter Hamilton wrote later to his son Archibald:\n<blockquote>Every morning in the early part of October 1843, on my coming down to breakfast, your brother [[William Edwin Hamilton|William Edwin]] and yourself used to ask me: \"Well, Papa, can you multiply triples?\"  Whereto I was always obliged to reply, with a sad shake of the head, \"No, I can only add and subtract them.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn October 16, 1843, Hamilton and his wife took a walk along the [[Royal Canal]] in [[Dublin]]. While they walked across Brougham Bridge (now [[Broom Bridge]]), a solution suddenly occurred to him. While he could not \"multiply triples\", he saw a way to do so for ''quadruples''. By using three of the numbers in the quadruple as the points of a coordinate in space, Hamilton could represent points in space by his new system of numbers. He then carved the basic rules for multiplication into the bridge:\n:<math>i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1.\\,</math>\n\nHamilton called a quadruple with these rules of multiplication a ''quaternion'', and he devoted the remainder of his life to studying and teaching them. From 1844 to 1850 [[Philosophical Magazine]] communicated Hamilton's exposition of quaternions.<ref>W.R. Hamilton(1844 to 1850) [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/OnQuat/ On quaternions or a new system of imaginaries in algebra], [[Philosophical Magazine]], link to David R. Wilkins collection at [[Trinity College, Dublin]]</ref> In 1853 he issued ''Lectures on Quaternions'', a comprehensive treatise that also described [[biquaternion]]s. The facility of the algebra in expressing geometric relationships led to broad acceptance of the method, several compositions by other authors, and stimulation of applied algebra generally. As mathematical terminology has grown since that time, and usage of some terms has changed, the traditional expressions are referred to [[classical Hamiltonian quaternion]]s.\n\n== Precursors ==\n\nHamilton's innovation consisted of expressing quaternions as an [[algebra over a field|algebra over '''R''']]. The formulae for the multiplication of quaternions are implicit in the [[four squares formula]] devised by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1748; [[Olinde Rodrigues]] applied this formula to representing rotations in 1840.<ref name=CS>[[John H. Conway]] & Derek A. Smith (2003) ''On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry'', [[A K Peters]], {{ISBN|1-56881-134-9}}</ref>{{rp|9}}\n\n== Response ==\nThe special claims of quaternions as the algebra of [[four-dimensional space]] were challenged by [[James Cockle]] with his exhibits in 1848 and 1849 of [[tessarine]]s and [[coquaternion]]s as alternatives. Nevertheless, these new algebras from Cockle were, in fact, to be found inside Hamilton’s [[biquaternion]]s. From Italy, in 1858 [[Giusto Bellavitis]] responded<ref>[[Giusto Bellavitis]] ( 1858) [https://archive.is/20141101193025/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pst.000003356951;view=1up;seq=1 Calcolo dei Quaternioni di W.R. Hamilton e sua Relazione col Metodo delle Equipollenze], link from HathiTrust</ref> to connect Hamilton’s vector theory with his theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]s of directed line segments.\n\n[[Jules Hoüel]] led the response from France in 1874 with a textbook on the elements of quaternions. To ease the study of [[versor]]s, he introduced \"biradials\" to designate great circle arcs on the sphere. Then the quaternion algebra provided the foundation for [[spherical trigonometry]]  introduced in chapter 9. Hoüel replaced Hamilton’s basis vectors '''i,j,k''' with i<sub>1</sub>,   i<sub>2</sub>, and i<sub>3</sub>.\nThe variety of typefaces (fonts) available led Hoüel to another notational innovation: ''A'' designates a point, ''a'' and <math>\\mathrm{a}</math> are algebraic quantities, and in the equation for a quaternion\n:<math>\\mathcal{ A} = \\cos \\alpha + \\mathbf{A} \\sin \\alpha ,</math>\n<math>\\mathbf{A}</math> is a vector and &alpha; is an angle. This style of quaternion exposition was perpetuated by [[Charles-Ange Laisant]]<ref>[[Charles Laisant]]  (1881) [https://books.google.ca/books?id=WvMGAAAAYAAJ Introduction a la Méthode des Quaternions], link from [[Google Books]]</ref> and [[Alexander Macfarlane]].<ref>A. Macfarlane (1894) ''[https://archive.org/details/principlesalgeb01macfgoog Papers on Space Analysis]'', B. Westerman, New York, weblink from [[archive.org]]</ref>\n\n[[William K. Clifford]] expanded the types of biquaternions, and explored [[elliptic space]], a geometry in which the points can be viewed as versors. Fascination with quaternions began before the language of [[set theory]] and [[mathematical structure]]s was available. In fact, there was little [[mathematical notation]] before the [[Formulario mathematico]]. The quaternions stimulated these advances: For example, the idea of a [[vector space]] borrowed Hamilton’s term but changed its meaning. Under the modern understanding, any quaternion is a vector in four-dimensional space. (Hamilton’s vectors lie in the subspace with scalar part zero.)\n\nSince quaternions demand their readers to imagine four dimensions, there is a metaphysical aspect to their invocation. Quaternions are a [[object (philosophy)|philosophical object]]. Setting quaternions before freshmen students of engineering asks too much. Yet the utility of [[dot product]]s and [[cross product]]s in [[three-dimensional space]], for illustration of processes, calls for the uses of these operations which are cut out of the quaternion product. Thus [[Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]] made this accommodation, for pragmatism, to avoid the distracting superstructure.<ref>Michael J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]], [[University of Notre Dame Press]]</ref>\n\nFor mathematicians the quaternion structure became familiar and lost its status as something mathematically interesting. Thus in England, when [[Arthur Buchheim]] prepared a paper on biquaternions, it was published in the [[American Journal of Mathematics]] since some novelty in the subject lingered there.  Research turned to [[hypercomplex number]]s more generally. For instance, [[Thomas Kirkman]] and [[Arthur Cayley]] considered the number of equations between basis vectors would be necessary to determine a unique system. The wide interest that quaternions aroused around the world resulted in the [[Quaternion Society]]. In contemporary mathematics, the [[division ring]] of quaternions exemplifies an [[algebra over a field]].\n\n== Principal publications ==\n* 1853 ''Lectures on Quaternions''<ref>[http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=05230001&seq=9 Lectures on Quaternions], Royal Irish Academy, weblink from [[Cornell University]] ''Historical Math Monographs''</ref>\n* 1866 ''Elements of Quaternions''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fIRAAAAAIAAJ Elements of Quaternions], [[University of Dublin]] Press.

L. Lawrence's work at Harvard. Coolidge uses these operators on [[dual quaternion]]s to describe screw displacement in [[kinematics]].\n\n== Octonions ==\n{{main|octonion}}\n\n[[Octonion]]s were developed independently by [[Arthur Cayley]] in 1845 <ref>Penrose 2004 pg 202</ref> and  [[John T. Graves]], a friend of Hamilton's. Graves had interested Hamilton in algebra, and responded to his discovery of quaternions with \"If with your alchemy you can make three pounds of gold [the three imaginary units], why should you stop there?\"{{Sfn|Baez|2002|p=146}}\n\nTwo months after Hamilton's discovery of quaternions, Graves wrote Hamilton on December 26, 1843 presenting a kind of double quaternion<ref>See Penrose Road to Reality pg. 202 'Graves discovered that there exists a kind of double quaternion...'</ref> that is called an ''octonion'', and showed that they were what we now call a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]ed [[division algebra]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}; Graves called them ''octaves''. Hamilton needed a way to distinguish between two different types of double quaternions, the associative [[biquaternion]]s and the octaves.  He spoke about them to the Royal Irish Society and credited his friend Graves for the discovery of the second type of double quaternion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=TCwPAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=octaves+hamilton+thinks&as_brr=1#PRA1-PA730,M1  Hamilton 1853 pg 740See a hard copy of Lectures on quaternions, appendix B, half of the hyphenated word double quaternion has been cut off in the online Edition ]</ref><ref>See Hamilton's talk to the Royal Irish Academy on the subject</ref> observed in reply that they were not [[associativity|associative]], which may have been the invention of the concept. He also promised to get Graves' work published, but did little about it; Cayley, working independently of Graves, but inspired by Hamilton's publication of his own work, published on octonions in March 1845&nbsp;– as an appendix to a paper on a different subject. Hamilton was stung into protesting Graves' priority in discovery, if not publication; nevertheless, octonions are known by the name Cayley gave them&nbsp;– or as ''Cayley numbers''.\n\nThe major deduction from the existence of octonions was the [[Degen's eight-square identity|eight squares theorem]], which follows directly from the product rule from octonions, had also been previously discovered as a purely algebraic identity, by [[Carl Ferdinand Degen]] in 1818.{{Sfn|Baez|2002|p=146-7}} This sum-of-squares identity is characteristic of [[composition algebra]], a feature of complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions.\n\n== Mathematical uses ==\n{{main| quaternions}}\n\nQuaternions continued to be a well-studied ''mathematical'' structure in the twentieth century, as the third term in the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] of [[hypercomplex number]] systems over the reals, followed by the [[octonion]]s and the [[sedenion]]s; they are also useful tool in [[number theory]], particularly in the study of the representation of numbers as sums of squares. The group of eight basic unit quaternions, positive and negative, the [[quaternion group]], is also the simplest non-commutative [[Sylow group]].\n\nThe study of [[integral quaternion]]s began with [[Rudolf Lipschitz]] in 1886, whose system was  later simplified by [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]]; but the modern system was published by [[Adolf Hurwitz]] in 1919. The difference between them consists of which quaternions are accounted integral: Lipschitz included only those quaternions with integral coordinates, but Hurwitz added those quaternions ''all four'' of whose coordinates are [[half-integers]]. Both systems are closed under subtraction and multiplication, and are therefore [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, but Lipschitz's system does not permit unique factorization, while Hurwitz's does.<ref>Hardy and Wright, ''Introduction to Number Theory'', §20.6-10''n'' (pp. 315–316, 1968 ed.)</ref>\n\n== Quaternions as rotations ==\n{{main| Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\n\nQuaternions are a concise  method of representing the [[automorphism]]s of three- and four-dimensional spaces. They have the technical advantage that [[unit quaternion]]s form the [[simply connected]] cover of the space of three-dimensional rotations.<ref name=CS/>{{rp|ch 2}}\n\nFor this reason, quaternions are used in [[computer graphics]],<ref>Ken Shoemaker (1985), [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiranb/animation/p245-shoemake.pdf Animating Rotation with Quaternion Curves], ''[[Computer Graphics (publication)|Computer Graphics]]'', '''19'''(3), 245–254.

Crowe, originally published by the [[University of Notre Dame Press]].\nAs a scholarly treatment of a reformation in [[technical communication]], the text is a contribution to the [[history of science]]. In 2002, Crowe gave a talk<ref>[http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~temple/MAT21D/SUPPLEMENTARY-ARTICLES/Crowe_History-of-Vectors.pdf Michael J. Crowe, A History of Vector Analysis (talk at University of Louisville, 2002)]</ref> summarizing the book, including an entertaining introduction in which he covered its publication history and related the award of a Jean Scott prize of $4000.  Crowe had entered the book in a competition for \"a study on the history of complex and hypercomplex numbers\" twenty-five years after his book was first published.\n\n==Summary of book==\nThe book has eight chapters: the first on the origins of vector analysis including Ancient Greek and 16th and 17th century influences; the second on the 19th century [[William Rowan Hamilton]] and [[quaternions]]; the third on other 19th and 18th century vectorial systems including [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]] of [[Giusto Bellavitis]] and the [[exterior algebra]] of [[Hermann Grassmann]].\n\nChapter four is on the general interest in the 19th century on vectorial systems including analysis of journal publications as well as sections on major figures and their views (e.g., [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] as an advocate of Quaternions and [[James Clerk Maxwell]] as a critic of Quaternions); the fifth chapter describes the development of the modern system of vector analysis by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]].\n\nIn chapter six, \"Struggle for existence\",\nMichael J. Crowe delves into the [[zeitgeist]] that pruned down quaternion theory into vector analysis on [[three-dimensional space]]. He makes clear the ambition of this effort by considering five major texts as well as a couple dozen articles authored by participants in \"The Great Vector Debate\". These are the books:\n:''Elementary Treatise on Quaternions'' (1890) [[Peter Guthrie Tait]]\n:''Elements of Vector Analysis'' (1881,1884) [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]\n:''Electromagnetic Theory'' (1893,1899,1912) [[Oliver Heaviside]]\n:''Utility of Quaternions in Physics'' (1893) [[Alexander McAulay]]\n:''Vector Analysis and Quaternions'' (1906) [[Alexander Macfarlane]]\n\nTwenty of the ancillary articles appeared in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]; others were in [[Philosophical Magazine]], London or Edinburgh Proceedings of the [[Royal Society]], [[Physical Review]], and Proceedings of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]. The authors included [[Cargill Gilston Knott]] and a half-dozen other hands.\n\nThe \"struggle for existence\" is a phrase from [[Charles Darwin]]’s [[Origin of Species]] and Crowe quotes Darwin:  \"…young and rising naturalists,…will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality.\" After 1901 with the Gibbs/Wilson/Yale publication [[Vector Analysis]], the question was decided in favour of the vectorialists with separate [[dot product|dot]] and [[cross product]]s. The pragmatic temper of the times set aside the four-dimensional source of vector algebra.\n\nCrowe's chapter seven is a survey of \"Twelve major publications in Vector Analysis from 1894 to 1910\". Of these twelve, seven are in German, two in Italian, one in Russian, and two in English. Whereas the previous chapter examined a debate in English, the final chapter notes the influence of [[Heinrich Hertz]]' results with radio and the rush of German research using vectors. Joseph George Coffin of MIT and [[Clark University]] published his ''Vector Analysis'' in 1909; it too leaned heavily into applications. Thus Crowe provides a context for Gibbs and Wilson’s famous textbook of 1901.\n\nThe eighth chapter is the author's summary and conclusions.<ref>Quote from page ix, \"Concerning bibliography. No formal bibliographical section has been included in this book. The reader will find however that the sections of notes at the end of each chapter will serve rather well as a bibliography for that chapter. Moreover the need for a bibliography is greatly diminished by the existence of a book that lists nearly all relevant primary documents published to about 1912.\"</ref> The book relies on references in chapter endnotes instead of a bibliography section.  Crowe also states that the ''Bibliography'' of the [[Quaternion Society]], and its supplements to 1912, already listed all the primary literature for the study.\n\n==Summary of reviews==\nThere were significant reviews given near the time of original publication. Stanley Goldberg<ref>Stanley Goldberg (1969) [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 76(9):1086–8</ref> wrote \"The polemics on both sides make very rich reading, especially when they are spiced with the sarcastic wit of a Heaviside, and the fervent, almost religious railing of a Tait.\" [[Morris Kline]] begins his 1969 review<ref>[[Morris Kline]] (1969) [http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/pdf/0229496.pdf Review of ''A History of Vector Analysis''] [[Mathematical Reviews]] 37 #5070</ref> with \"Since historical publications on modern developments are rare, this book is welcome.\" and ends with \"the subtitle [,The Evolution of the Idea of a Vectorial System,] is a better description of the contents than the title proper.\"  Then [[William C. Waterhouse]]—picking up where Kline's review left off—writes in 1972 \"Crowe's book on vector analysis seems a little anemic in comparison, perhaps because its title is misleading. ... [Crowe] does succeed in his goal of tracing the genealogy of the 3-space system, concluding that it was developed out of quaternions by physicists.\"<ref>[[William C. Waterhouse]] (1972) Review, [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 78(3):385–391</ref>\n\nIn 2003 Sandro Caparrini challenged Crowe’s conclusions by noting that \"geometrical representations of forces and velocities by means of directed line segments...was already fairly well known by the middle of the eighteenth century\" in his essay \"Early Theories of Vectors\".<ref>{{cite book |author = Becchi, Antonio |author2 = Massimo Corradi |author3 = Federico Foce |author4 = Orietta Pedemonte |title=Essays on the History of Mechanics: In Memory of Clifford Ambrose Truesdell and Edoardo Benvenuto |publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag |location=Basel |year=2003 |pages=175–198|isbn=3-7643-1476-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref> Caparrini cites several sources, in particular [[Gaetano Giorgini]] (1795 — 1874) and his appreciation in an 1830 article<ref>[[Michel Chasles]] (1830) \"Mémoire de géométrie pure, sur les systèmes de forces, et les systèmes d'aires planes; et sur les polygones, polyèdres, et les centres de moyennes distances\", ''Correspondence Mathématique et Physique'' 6:92–120</ref> by [[Michel Chasles]]. Caparrini goes on to indicate that [[torque|moments of forces]] and [[angular velocity|angular velocities]] were recognized as vectorial entities in the second half of the eighteenth century.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of quaternions]]\n* [[Hypercomplex number]]\n* [[Vector space]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2197718.A_History_of_Vector_Analysis A History of Vector Analysis] from [[Goodreads]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Vector Analysis, A}}\n[[Category:1967 books]]\n[[Category:Mathematics books]]\n[[Category:History of mathematics]]\n[[Category:Books about the history of science]]\n[[Category:Historical treatment of quaternions]]"

They both contain subalgebras isomorphic to the [[split-complex number]] plane. Furthermore, just as the quaternion algebra '''H''' can be viewed as a [[quaternion#H as a union of complex planes|union of complex planes]], so the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is a union of split-complex number planes sharing the same [[real line#In real algebras|real line]].\n\nIt was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who promoted this concept in the 1890s as his ''Algebra of Physics'', first through the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1891, then through his 1894 book of five ''Papers in Space Analysis'', and in a series of lectures at [[Lehigh University]] in 1900.\n\n==Algebraic structure==\nLike the [[quaternions]], the set of hyperbolic quaternions form a [[vector space]] over the [[real numbers]] of [[dimension]] 4.  A [[linear combination]]\n\n:<math>q = a+bi+cj+dk</math>\n\nis a '''hyperbolic quaternion''' when  <math>a, b, c,</math> and <math>d</math> are real numbers and the basis set <math>\\{1,i,j,k\\}</math> has these products:\n\n:<math>ij=k=-ji</math>\n:<math>jk=i=-kj</math>\n:<math>ki=j=-ik</math>\n:<math>i^2=+1=j^2=k^2</math>\n\nUsing the [[distributive property]], these relations can be used to multiply any two hyperbolic quaternions.\n\nUnlike the ordinary quaternions, the hyperbolic quaternions are not [[associative]]. For example, <math>(ij)j = kj = -i</math>, while <math>i(jj) = i</math>. In fact, this example shows that the hyperbolic quaternions are not even an [[alternative algebra]].\n\nThe first three relations show that products of the (non-real) basis elements are [[anti-commutative]].  Although this basis set does not form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the set\n\n:<math>\\{1,i,j,k,-1,-i,-j,-k\\}</math>\n\nforms a [[quasigroup]]. One also notes that any subplane of the set ''M'' of hyperbolic quaternions that contains the real axis forms a plane of [[split-complex number]]s. If\n\n:<math>q^*=a-bi-cj-dk</math>\n\nis the conjugate of <math>q</math>, then the product\n\n:<math>q(q^*)=a^2-b^2-c^2-d^2</math>\n\nis the [[quadratic form]] used in [[spacetime]] theory. In fact, for events ''p'' and ''q'', the [[bilinear form]] \n: <math>\\eta (p,q) = -p_0q_0 + p_1q_1 + p_2q_2 + p_3q_3 </math>\narises as the negative of the real part of the hyperbolic quaternion product ''pq''*, and is used in [[Minkowski space#Minkowski metric|Minkowski space]].\n\nNote that the set of [[unit (ring theory)|units]] U = {''q'' : ''qq''* ≠ 0 } is ''not'' closed under multiplication. See the references (external link) for details.\n\n==Discussion==\n\nThe hyperbolic quaternions form a [[nonassociative ring]]; the failure of [[associativity]] in this algebra curtails the facility of this algebra in transformation theory. Nevertheless, \nthis algebra put a focus on analytical kinematics by suggesting a [[mathematical model]]:\nWhen one selects a unit vector ''r'' in the hyperbolic quaternions, then ''r'' <sup>2</sup> = +1. The plane <math>D_r = \\lbrace t + x r : t, x \\in R \\rbrace </math> with hyperbolic quaternion multiplication is a commutative and associative subalgebra isomorphic to the split-complex number plane.\nThe [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] <math>\\exp(a r) = \\cosh(a)  + r \\ \\sinh(a) </math> transforms D<sub>r</sub> by\n:<math> t + x r \\quad \\mapsto \\quad \\exp(a r) (t + x r) = </math>\n:<math> (\\cosh(a) t + x \\sinh(a)) + (\\sinh(a) t + x \\cosh(a)) r . \\!</math>\nSince the direction ''r'' in space is arbitrary, this hyperbolic quaternion multiplication can express any [[Lorentz boost]] using the parameter ''a'' called [[rapidity]]. However, the hyperbolic quaternion algebra is deficient for representing the full [[Lorentz group]] (see [[biquaternion]] instead).\n\nWriting in 1967 about the dialogue on vector methods in the 1890s, a historian commented\n:''The introduction of another system of vector analysis, even a sort of compromise system such as Macfarlane's, could scarcely be well received by the advocates of the already existing systems and moreover probably acted to broaden the question beyond the comprehension of the as-yet uninitiated reader.''<ref name=Crowe>{{cite book |first=M.J. |last=Crowe |title=A History of Vector Analysis |publisher=University of Notre Dame |year=1967 |isbn= |page=191 |url= |ref=harv|title-link=A History of Vector Analysis }}</ref>\n\n==Geometry==\nLater, Macfarlane published an article in the ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'' in 1900. In it he treats a model for [[hyperbolic space]] H<sup>3</sup> on the [[hyperboloid]]\n\n:<math>H^3 = \\{ q \\in M: q(q^*)=1 \\} \\!</math>.\n\nThis [[isotropic]] model is called the [[hyperboloid model]] and consists of all the [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versors]] in the ring of hyperbolic quaternions.\n\n==Historical review==<!-- This section is linked from [[Quasigroup]] -->\nThe 1890s felt the influence of the posthumous publications of [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]] and the ''continuous groups'' of [[Sophus Lie]]. An example of a [[one-parameter group]] is the [[versor#Hyperbolic versor|hyperbolic versor]] with the [[hyperbolic angle]] parameter. This parameter is part of the [[polar decomposition#Alternative planar decompositions|polar decomposition]] of a split-complex number. But it is a startling aspect of finite mathematics that makes the hyperbolic quaternion ring different:\n\nThe basis <math>\\{1,\\,i,\\,j,\\,k\\}</math> of the vector space of hyperbolic quaternions is not [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under multiplication: for example, <math>ji=-\\!k</math>. Nevertheless, the set <math>\\{1,\\,i,\\,j,\\,k,\\,-\\!1,\\,-\\!i,\\,-\\!j,\\,-\\!k\\}</math> is closed under multiplication. It satisfies all the properties of an abstract group except the associativity property; being finite, it is a [[Latin square]] or [[quasigroup]], a peripheral [[mathematical structure]]. Loss of  the associativity property of multiplication as found in quasigroup theory is not consistent with [[linear algebra]] since all linear transformations compose in an associative manner. Yet physical scientists were calling in the 1890s for mutation of the squares of <math>i</math>,<math>j</math>, and <math>k</math> to be <math>+1</math> instead of <math>-1</math> :\nThe [[Yale University]] physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] had pamphlets with the plus one square in his three-dimensional vector system. [[Oliver Heaviside]] in England wrote columns in the ''Electrician'', a trade paper, advocating the positive square. In 1892 he brought his work together in ''Transactions of the Royal Society A''<ref>{{harvnb|Heaviside|1892|pp=427–430}}</ref> where he says his vector system is\n:simply the elements of Quaternions without quaternions, with the notation simplified to the uttermost, and with the very inconvenient ''minus'' sign before scalar product done away with.\n\nSo the appearance of Macfarlane's hyperbolic quaternions had some motivation, but the disagreeable non-associativity precipitated a reaction. [[Cargill Gilston Knott]] was moved to offer the following:\n\n'''Theorem''' (Knott<ref>{{cite journal |first=C.G. |last=Knott |title=Recent Innovations in Vector Theory |journal=Nature |volume=47 |issue=1225 |pages=590–3 |year=1893 |doi=10.1038/047590b0 |bibcode=1893Natur..47R.590. }} read before the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] 19 December 1892 and published in ''Proceedings''</ref> 1892)\n:If a 4-algebra on basis <math>\\{1,\\,i,\\,j,\\,k\\}</math> is associative and off-diagonal products are given by Hamilton's rules, then <math>i^2=-\\!1=j^2=k^2</math>.\n\n'''Proof:'''\n:<math>j = ki = (-ji)i = -j(ii)</math>, so <math>i^2 = -1</math>. Cycle the letters <math>i</math>, <math>j</math>, <math>k</math> to obtain <math>i^2=-1=j^2=k^2</math>. ''QED''.\n\nThis theorem needed statement to justify resistance to the call of the physicists and the ''Electrician''. The quasigroup stimulated a considerable stir in the 1890s: the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' was especially conducive to an exhibit of what was known by giving two digests of Knott's work as well as those of several other vector theorists. Michael J. Crowe devotes chapter six of his book ''[[A History of Vector Analysis]]'' to the various published views, and notes the hyperbolic quaternion:\n\n:''Macfarlane constructed a new system of vector analysis more in harmony with Gibbs–Heaviside system than with the quaternion system. ...he...defined a full product of two vectors which was comparable to the full quaternion product except that the scalar part was positive, not negative as in the older system.''<ref name=Crowe/>\n\nIn 1899 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] noted the hyperbolic quaternion and the non-associativity property<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamilton |title=Elements of Quaternions |location= |year=1899 |isbn= |page=163 |url= |edition=2nd |editor-first=C.J. |editor-last=Joly }}</ref> while ascribing its origin to Oliver Heaviside.\n\nThe hyperbolic quaternions, as the ''Algebra of Physics'', undercut the claim that ordinary quaternions made on physics. As for mathematics, the hyperbolic quaternion is another [[hypercomplex number]], as such structures were called at the time. By the 1890s [[Richard Dedekind]] had introduced the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] concept into commutative algebra, and the [[vector space]] concept was being abstracted by [[Giuseppe Peano]]. In 1899 [[Alfred North Whitehead]] promoted [[Universal algebra]], advocating for inclusivity. The concepts of quasigroup and [[algebra over a field]] are examples of [[mathematical structure]]s describing hyperbolic quaternions.\n\n==Macfarlane's hyperbolic quaternion paper of 1900==\nThe ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh'' published \"Hyperbolic Quaternions\" \nin 1900, a paper in which Macfarlane regains associativity for multiplication by reverting \nto [[biquaternion|complexified quaternions]]. While there he used some expressions later \nmade famous by [[Wolfgang Pauli]]: where Macfarlane wrote\n:<math>ij=k\\sqrt{-1}</math> \n:<math>jk=i\\sqrt{-1}</math>\n:<math>ki=j\\sqrt{-1}</math>,\nthe [[Pauli matrices]] satisfy\n:<math>\\sigma_1\\sigma_2=\\sigma_3\\sqrt{-1}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_2\\sigma_3=\\sigma_1\\sqrt{-1}</math>\n:<math>\\sigma_3\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2\\sqrt{-1}</math>\nwhile referring to the same complexified quaternions.\n\nThe opening sentence of the paper is \"It is well known that quaternions are intimately connected with [[spherical trigonometry]] and in fact they reduce the subject to a branch of algebra.\" This statement may be verified by reference to the contemporary work ''[[Vector Analysis]]'' which works with a reduced quaternion system based on [[dot product]] and [[cross product]]. In Macfarlane's paper there is an effort to produce \"trigonometry on the surface of the equilateral hyperboloids\" through the algebra of hyperbolic quaternions, now re-identified in an associative ring of eight real dimensions. The effort is reinforced by a plate of nine figures on page 181.  They illustrate the descriptive power of his \"space analysis\" method. For example, figure 7 is the \ncommon [[Minkowski diagram]] used today in [[special relativity]] to discuss change of velocity of a frame of reference and [[relativity of simultaneity]].\n\nOn page 173 Macfarlane expands on his greater theory of quaternion variables. By way of contrast he notes that [[Felix Klein]] appears not to look beyond the theory of [[Quaternions and spatial rotation]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*{{cite journal |authorlink=Oliver Heaviside |first=Oliver |last=Heaviside  |title=On the forces, stresses, and fluxes of energy in the electromagnetic field |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=183 |issue= |pages=423–480 |year=1892 |doi= 10.1098/rsta.1892.0011|url= https://zenodo.org/record/1432100|jstor=90590 |ref=harv|bibcode=1892RSPTA.183..423H}}\n*{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Macfarlane |title=Principles of the Algebra of Physics |journal=Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume=40 |issue= |pages=65–117 |year=1891 |doi= |url=}}\n*{{cite book |first=A. |last=Macfarlane |chapter=Paper 2: The Imaginary of the Algebra |chapterurl= |editor= |title=Papers on Space Analysis |publisher=B.

The concept of a hypercomplex number covered them all, and called for a discipline to explain and classify them.\n\nThe cataloguing project began in 1872 when [[Benjamin Peirce]] first published his ''Linear Associative Algebra'', and was carried forward by his son [[Charles Sanders Peirce]].<ref>Linear Associative Algebra (1881) [[American Journal of Mathematics]] 4(1):221&ndash;6</ref>  Most significantly, they identified the [[nilpotent]] and the [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s as useful hypercomplex numbers for classifications. The [[Cayley–Dickson construction]] used [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]s to generate complex numbers, quaternions, and octonions out of the real number system. Hurwitz and Frobenius proved theorems that put limits on hypercomplexity: [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] says finite-dimensional real [[composition algebra]]s are the reals ℝ, the complexes ℂ, the quaternions ℍ, and the octonions 𝕆, and the [[Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)|Frobenius theorem]] says the only real [[associative division algebra]]s are ℝ, ℂ, and ℍ. In 1958 [[Frank Adams|J. Frank Adams]] published a further generalization in terms of Hopf invariants on ''H''-spaces which still limits the dimension to 1, 2, 4, or 8.<ref name=\"Adams1958\">{{cite journal | jstor=1970147 | title=On the Non-Existence of Elements of Hopf Invariant One | author=Adams, J.

First, matrices contributed new hypercomplex numbers like [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. Soon the matrix paradigm began to explain the others as they became represented by matrices and their operations.  In 1907 [[Joseph Wedderburn]] showed that associative hypercomplex systems could be represented by matrices, or direct sums of systems of matrices.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J.H.M.

Note however, that non-associative systems like octonions and  [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s represent another type of hypercomplex number.\n\nAs Hawkins<ref>Thomas Hawkins (1972) \"Hypercomplex numbers, Lie groups, and the creation of group representation theory\", ''[[Archive for History of Exact Sciences]]'' 8:243&ndash;87</ref> explains, the hypercomplex numbers are stepping stones to learning about [[Lie group]]s and [[group representation]] theory.

Elements are generated with real number coefficients <math>(a_0, \\dots, a_n)</math> for a basis <math>\\{ 1, i_1, \\dots, i_n \\}</math>. Where possible, it is conventional to choose the basis so that <math>i_k^2 \\in \\{ -1, 0, +1 \\}</math>. A technical approach to hypercomplex numbers directs attention first to those of [[dimension]] two.\n\n==Two-dimensional real algebras==\n'''Theorem:'''<ref name=KS78/>{{rp|14,15}}<ref>[[Isaak Yaglom]] (1968) ''Complex Numbers in Geometry'', pages 10 to 14</ref><ref>John H. Ewing editor (1991) ''Numbers'', page 237, Springer, {{isbn|3-540-97497-0}}</ref> Up to isomorphism, there are exactly three 2-dimensional unital algebras over the reals: the ordinary [[complex number]]s, the [[split-complex number]]s, and the [[dual number]]s. In particular, every 2-dimensional unital algebra over the reals is associative.\n\n:Proof: Since the algebra is two dimensional, we can pick a basis ''{1, u}''.  Since the algebra is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under squaring, the non-real basis element ''u'' squares to a linear combination of 1 and ''u'':\n:<math>u^2=a_0+a_1u</math>\nfor some real numbers ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''a''<sub>1</sub>.\nUsing the common method of [[completing the square]] by subtracting ''a''<sub>1</sub>''u'' and adding the quadratic complement {{nowrap|''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> / 4}} to both sides yields\n:<math>u^2-a_1u+\\frac{a_1^2}{4}=a_0+\\frac{a_1^2}{4} .</math>\n:<math>u^2-a_1u+\\frac{a_1^2}{4}=\\left(u-\\frac{a_1}{2}\\right)^2= \\tilde{u}^2</math>&nbsp; so that\n:<math>\\tilde{u}^2~=a_0+\\frac{a_1^2}{4} .</math>\nThe three cases depend on this real value:\n* If {{nowrap|1=4''a<sub>0</sub>'' = −''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|1=''ũ''<sup>2</sup> = 0}}. Hence, ''ũ'' can directly be identified with the [[nilpotent]] element <math>\\epsilon</math> of the basis <math>\\{ 1, ~\\epsilon \\}</math> of the dual numbers.\n* If {{nowrap|4''a<sub>0</sub>'' > −''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|''ũ''<sup>2</sup> > 0}}. This leads to the split-complex numbers which have normalized basis <math>\\{ 1 , ~j \\}</math> with <math>j^2 = +1</math>. To obtain ''j'' from ''ũ'', the latter must be divided by the positive real number <math>a:=\\sqrt{a_0+\\frac{a_1^2}{4}}</math> which has the same square as ''ũ'' has.\n* If {{nowrap|4''a<sub>0</sub>'' < −''a''<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>}}, the above formula yields {{nowrap|''ũ''<sup>2</sup> < 0}}. This leads to the complex numbers which have normalized basis <math>\\{ 1 , ~i \\}</math> with <math>i^2 = -1</math>. To yield ''i'' from ''ũ'', the latter has to be divided by a positive real number <math>a:=\\sqrt{\\frac{a_1^2}{4}-a_0}</math> which squares to the negative of ''ũ''<sup>2</sup>.\n\nThe complex numbers are the only two-dimensional hypercomplex algebra that is a [[Field (mathematics)|field]].\nAlgebras such as the split-complex numbers that include non-real roots of 1 also contain [[idempotent element|idempotent]]s <math>\\tfrac{1}{2} (1 \\pm j)</math> and [[zero divisor]]s <math>(1 + j)(1 - j) = 0</math>, so such algebras cannot be [[division algebra]]s. However, these properties can turn out to be very meaningful, for instance in describing the [[Lorentz transformations]] of [[special relativity]].\n\nIn a 2004 edition of [[Mathematics Magazine]] the two-dimensional real algebras have been styled the \"generalized complex numbers\".<ref>Anthony A. Harkin & Joseph B.

Over the real numbers this is equivalent to being able to define a symmetric scalar product, ''u''⋅''v'' = ½(''uv'' + ''vu'') that can be used to [[orthogonalization|orthogonalise]] the quadratic form, to give a set of bases {''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''k''</sub>} such that:\n::<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} (e_i e_j + e_j e_i) = \\Bigg\\{  \\begin{matrix} -1, 0, +1  & i=j,  \\\\\n                                   0 &  i \\not = j. \\end{matrix} </math>\nImposing closure under multiplication generates a multivector space spanned by a basis of 2<sup>''k''</sup> elements, {1, ''e''<sub>1</sub>, ''e''<sub>2</sub>, ''e''<sub>3</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub>''e''<sub>3</sub>, ...}.  These can be interpreted as the basis of a hypercomplex number system. Unlike the basis {''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''k''</sub>}, the remaining basis elements may or may not anti-commute, depending on how many simple exchanges must be carried out to swap the two factors.  So {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>''e''<sub>2</sub> = −''e''<sub>2</sub>''e''<sub>1</sub>}}, but {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>1</sub>(''e''<sub>2</sub>''e''<sub>3</sub>) = +(''e''<sub>2</sub>''e''<sub>3</sub>)''e''<sub>1</sub>}}.\n\nPutting aside the bases for which {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0}} (i.e. directions in the original space over which the quadratic form was [[degenerate form|degenerate]]), the remaining Clifford algebras can be identified by the label ''C''ℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R'''), indicating that the algebra is constructed from ''p'' simple basis elements with {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> = +1}}, ''q'' with {{nowrap|1=''e''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>2</sup> = −1}}, and where '''R''' indicates that this is to be a Clifford algebra over the reals—i.e. coefficients of elements of the algebra are to be real numbers.\n\nThese algebras, called [[geometric algebra]]s, form a systematic set, which turn out to be very useful in physics problems which involve [[rotation]]s, [[phase (waves)|phase]]s, or [[Spin (physics)|spin]]s, notably in [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetic theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].\n\nExamples include: the [[complex number]]s ''C''ℓ<sub>0,1</sub>('''R'''), [[split-complex number]]s ''C''ℓ<sub>1,0</sub>('''R'''), [[quaternion]]s ''C''ℓ<sub>0,2</sub>('''R'''), [[split-biquaternion]]s ''C''ℓ<sub>0,3</sub>('''R'''), [[split-quaternion]]s {{nowrap|''C''ℓ<sub>1,1</sub>('''R''') ≈ ''C''ℓ<sub>2,0</sub>('''R''')}} (the natural algebra of two-dimensional space); ''C''ℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') (the natural algebra of three-dimensional space, and the algebra of the [[Pauli matrices]]); and the [[spacetime algebra]] ''C''ℓ<sub>1,3</sub>('''R''').\n\nThe elements of the algebra ''C''ℓ<sub>''p'',''q''</sub>('''R''') form an even subalgebra ''C''ℓ<sup>0</sup><sub>''q''+1,''p''</sub>('''R''') of the algebra ''C''ℓ<sub>''q''+1,''p''</sub>('''R'''), which can be used to parametrise rotations in the larger algebra.  There is thus a close connection between complex numbers and rotations in two-dimensional space; between quaternions and rotations in three-dimensional space; between split-complex numbers and (hyperbolic) rotations ([[Lorentz transformations]]) in 1+1-dimensional space, and so on.\n\nWhereas Cayley–Dickson and split-complex constructs with eight or more dimensions are not associative with respect to multiplication, Clifford algebras retain associativity at any number of dimensions.\n\nIn 1995 [[Ian R.

A different approach to extending the complex numbers is taken by the [[Cayley–Dickson construction]].  This generates number systems of dimension 2<sup>''n''</sup>, ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, ..., with bases <math>\\{1, i_1, \\dots, i_{2^n-1}\\}</math>, where all the non-real basis elements anti-commute and satisfy <math>i_m^2 = -1</math>. In 8 or more dimensions (n ≥ 3) these algebras are non-associative. In 16 or more dimensions (n ≥ 4) these algebras also have [[zero-divisor]]s.\n\nThe first algebras in this sequence are the four-dimensional [[quaternion]]s, eight-dimensional [[octonion]]s, and 16-dimensional [[sedenion]]s. An algebraic symmetry is lost with each increase in dimensionality: quaternion multiplication is not [[commutative]], octonion multiplication is non-[[associative]], and the [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] of [[sedenion]]s is not multiplicative.\n\nThe Cayley–Dickson construction can be modified by inserting an extra sign at some stages. It then generates the \"split algebras\" in the collection of [[composition algebra]]s instead of the division algebras: \n: [[split-complex number]]s with basis <math>\\{ 1, i_1 \\}</math> satisfying <math>\\ i_1^2 = +1</math>,\n: [[split-quaternion]]s with basis <math>\\{ 1, i_1, i_2, i_3 \\}</math> satisfying <math>\\ i_1^2 = -1, i_2^2 = i_3^2 = +1</math>, and\n: [[split-octonion]]s with basis <math>\\{ 1, i_1, \\dots, i_7 \\}</math> satisfying <math>\\ i_1^2 = i_2^2 = i_3^2 = -1</math>, <math>\\ i_4^2 = \\cdots = i_7^2 = +1 .</math>\nUnlike the complex numbers, the split-complex numbers are not [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]], and further contain [[zero divisor]]s and non-trivial [[idempotent]]s. As with the quaternions, split-quaternions are not commutative, but further contain [[nilpotent]]s; they are isomorphic to the [[2 × 2 real matrices]]. Split-octonions are non-associative and contain nilpotents.\n\n===Tensor products===\nThe [[tensor product]] of any two algebras is another algebra, which can be used to produce many more examples of hypercomplex number systems.\n\nIn particular taking tensor products with the complex numbers (considered as algebras over the reals) leads to four-dimensional [[tessarine]]s <math>\\mathbb C\\otimes_\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb C</math>, eight-dimensional [[biquaternion]]s <math>\\mathbb C\\otimes_\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb H</math>, and 16-dimensional [[octonion|complex octonion]]s <math>\\mathbb C\\otimes_\\mathbb{R}\\mathbb O</math>.\n\n===Further examples===\n* [[bicomplex number]]s: a 4-dimensional vector space over the reals, 2-dimensional over the complex numbers\n* [[multicomplex number]]s: 2<sup>''n''−1</sup>-dimensional vector spaces over the complex numbers\n* [[composition algebra]]: algebra with a [[quadratic form]] that composes with the product\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sedenions]]\n* [[Thomas Kirkman]]\n* [[Georg Scheffers]]\n* [[Richard Brauer]]\n* [[Hypercomplex analysis]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Daniel Alfsmann (2006) [http://www.eurasip.org/proceedings/eusipco/eusipco2006/papers/1568981962.pdf On families of 2^N dimensional hypercomplex algebras suitable for digital signal processing], 14th European Signal Processing Conference, Florence, Italy.\n* [[Emil Artin]] (1928) \"Zur Theorie der hyperkomplexen Zahlen\" and \"Zur Arithmetik hyperkomplexer Zahlen\", in ''The Collected Papers of'' Emil Artin, [[Serge Lang]] and [[John T.

Subsequently, they became fundamental to all of physics, because they formed the basis of [[special relativity]] in which they exhibit the symmetry of [[Minkowski spacetime]], making the [[speed of light]] invariant between different inertial frames. They relate the spacetime coordinates of two arbitrary [[inertial frame of reference|inertial frames of reference]] with constant relative speed ''v''. In one frame, the position of an event is given by ''x,y,z'' and time ''t'', while in the other frame the same event has coordinates ''x′,y′,z′'' and ''t′''.\n\n==Overview==\n\n=== Most general Lorentz transformations ===\n\nThe general [[quadratic form]] ''q(x)'' with coefficients of a [[symmetric matrix]] '''A''', the associated [[bilinear form]] ''b(x,y)'', and the [[linear transformation]]s of ''q(x)'' and ''b(x,y)'' into ''q(x′)'' and ''b(x′,y′)'' using the [[transformation matrix]] '''g''', can be written as<ref>Bôcher (1907), chapter X</ref>\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\begin{matrix}\\begin{align}\\begin{align}q=\\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\end{align} & =q'=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{\\prime T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}'\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\\\ b=\\sum_{0}^{n}A_{ij}x_{i}y_{j}=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{y} & =b'=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{\\prime T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}'\\cdot\\mathbf{y}' \\end{align} \\quad\\left(A_{ij}=A_{ji}\\right)\\\\ \\hline \\left.\\begin{align}x_{i} & =\\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}x_{j}^{\\prime}=\\mathbf{g}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\\\ x_{i}^{\\prime} & =\\sum_{j=0}^{n}g_{ij}^{(-1)}x_{j}=\\mathbf{g}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathbf{x} \\end{align} \\right|\\mathbf{g}^{{\\rm T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{g}=\\mathbf{A}' \\end{matrix}</math>|{{equationRef|Q1}}}}\n\nThe case ''n=1'' is the [[binary quadratic form]] introduced by [[#Gauss|Lagrange (1773) and Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=2'' is the ternary quadratic form introduced by [[#Gauss2|Gauss (1798/1801)]], ''n=3'' is the quaternary quadratic form etc.\n\nThe general Lorentz transformation follows from ({{equationNote|Q1}}) by setting '''A'''='''A′'''=diag(-1,1,...,1) and det '''g'''=±1.

Both representations were studied by [[#Lie|Lie (1871)]] and others. It was shown by [[#Bateman|Bateman & Cunningham (1909–1910)]], that the group Con(1,3) is the most general one leaving invariant the equations of Maxwell's electrodynamics.\n\nIt turns out that Con(1,3) is isomorphic to the [[special orthogonal group]] SO(2,4), and contains the Lorentz group SO(1,3) as a subgroup by setting λ=1. More generally, Con(q,p) is isomorphic to SO(q+1,p+1) and contains SO(q,p) as subgroup.<ref>Schottenloher (2008), section 2.2</ref> This implies that Con(0,p) is isomorphic to the Lorentz group of arbitrary dimensions SO(1,p+1). Consequently, the conformal group in the plane Con(0,2) – known as the group of [[Möbius transformation]]s – is isomorphic to the Lorentz group SO(1,3).<ref>Kastrup (2008), section 2.4.1</ref><ref>Schottenloher (2008), section 2.3</ref> This can be seen using tetracyclical coordinates satisfying the form <math>-x_{0}^{2}+x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=0</math>, which were discussed by [[#Klein3|Pockels (1891), Klein (1893), Bôcher (1894)]]. The relation between Con(1,3) and the Lorentz group was noted by [[#Bateman|Bateman & Cunningham (1909–1910)]] and others.\n\nA special case of Lie's geometry of oriented spheres is the [[Spherical wave transformation#Transformation by reciprocal directions|Laguerre group]], transforming oriented planes and lines into each other. It's generated by the Laguerre inversion introduced by [[#Laguerre|Laguerre (1882)]] and discussed by [[#Darboux|Darboux (1887)]] and [[#Smith|Smith (1900)]] leaving invariant ''x<sup>2</sup>+y<sup>2</sup>+z<sup>2</sup>-R<sup>2</sup>'' with ''R'' as radius, thus the Laguerre group is isomorphic to the Lorentz group. A similar concept was studied by [[#Scheffers|Scheffers (1899)]] in terms of contact transformations. [[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] argued that Lie's geometry of oriented spheres in terms of contact transformations, as well as the special case of the transformations of oriented planes into each other (such as by Laguerre), provides a geometrical interpretation of Hamilton's [[biquaternion]]s. The [[group isomorphism]] between the Laguerre group and Lorentz group was pointed out by [[#Bateman|Bateman (1910), Cartan (1912, 1915/55), Poincaré (1912/21)]] and others.<ref>Coolidge (1916), p. 370</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Cartan & Fano (1915/55), sections 14–15</ref>\n\n=== Lorentz transformation via Cayley–Hermite transformation ===\n\nThe general transformation ({{equationNote|Q1}}) of any quadratic form into itself can also be given using ''arbitrary'' parameters based on the [[Cayley transform]] ('''I'''-'''T''')<sup>−1</sup>·('''I'''+'''T'''), where '''I''' is the [[identity matrix]], '''T''' an arbitrary [[antisymmetric matrix]], and by adding '''A''' as symmetric matrix defining the quadratic form (there is no primed '''A' ''' because the coefficients are assumed to be the same on both sides):<ref>Hawkins (2013), pp. 210–214</ref><ref>Meyer (1899), p. 329</ref>\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\begin{matrix}q=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}=q'=\\mathbf{x}^{\\mathrm{\\prime T}}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\\\\n\\hline \\\\\n\\mathbf{x}=(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{A})^{-1}\\cdot(\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{T}\\cdot\\mathbf{A})\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\\\\n\\text{or}\\\\\n\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{T})\\cdot(\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{T})^{-1}\\cdot\\mathbf{A}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\n\\end{matrix}</math>|{{equationRef|Q2}}}}\n\nAfter [[#Cayley|Cayley (1846)]] introduced transformations related to sums of positive squares, [[#Hermite|Hermite (1853/54, 1854)]] derived transformations for arbitrary quadratic forms, whose result was reformulated in terms of matrices ({{equationNote|Q2}}) by [[#Cayley|Cayley (1855a, 1855b)]].

[[#Stephanos|Stephanos (1883)]] related the imaginary part of [[William Rowan Hamilton]]'s biquaternions to the radius of spheres, and introduced a homography leaving invariant the equations of oriented spheres or oriented planes in terms of [[Lie sphere geometry]]. [[#Buchheim|Buchheim (1884/85)]] discussed the Cayley absolute <math>x_{0}^{2}-x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}=0</math> and adapted Clifford's biquaternions to hyperbolic geometry similar to Cox by using all three values of ω<sup>2</sup>. Eventually, the modern Lorentz transformation using biquaternions with ω<sup>2</sup>=-1 as in hyperbolic geometry was given by [[#Noether|Noether (1910), Klein (1910), Conway (1911), Silberstein (1911)]].\n\nOften connected with quaternionic systems is the [[hyperbolic number]] ε<sup>2</sup>=1, which also allows to formulate the Lorentz transformations:<ref>Sobczyk (1995)</ref><ref>Fjelstad (1986)</ref>\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\begin{align}w' & =we^{-\\varepsilon\\eta}\\\\\n & =w(\\cosh(-\\eta)+\\varepsilon\\sinh(-\\eta))\\\\\n\\\\\nw & =w'e^{\\varepsilon\\eta}\\\\\n & =w'(\\cosh\\eta+\\varepsilon\\sinh\\eta)\n\\end{align}\n\\rightarrow\\begin{align}w & =x_{1}+\\varepsilon x_{0}\\\\\nw' & =x_{1}^{\\prime}+\\varepsilon x_{0}^{\\prime}\n\\end{align}\n\\rightarrow\\begin{align}x_{0}^{\\prime} & =x_{0}\\cosh\\eta-x_{1}\\sinh\\eta\\\\\nx_{1}^{\\prime} & =-x_{0}\\sinh\\eta+x_{1}\\cosh\\eta\\\\\n\\\\\nx_{0} & =x_{0}^{\\prime}\\cosh\\eta+x_{1}^{\\prime}\\sinh\\eta\\\\\nx_{1} & =x_{0}^{\\prime}\\sinh\\eta+x_{1}^{\\prime}\\cosh\\eta\n\\end{align}</math>|{{equationRef|8b}}}}\n\nAfter the trigonometric expression e<sup>ix</sup>=cos(x)+i·sin(x) ([[Euler's formula]]) was given by [[#Euler3|Euler (1748)]] and the hyperbolic analogue e<sup>εη</sup> by [[#Cox2|Cockle (1848)]] in the framework of [[tessarine]]s, it was shown by [[#Cox2|Cox (1882/83)]] that one can identify ww′<sup>−1</sup>=e<sup>εη</sup> with associative quaternion multiplication. Here, e<sup>εη</sup> is the hyperbolic [[versor]] with ε<sup>2</sup>=1, the elliptic one follows with ε<sup>2</sup>=-1, and parabolic with ε<sup>2</sup>=0 (this should not be confused with the expression ω<sup>2</sup> in Clifford's biquaternions also used by Cox, in which ω<sup>2</sup>=-1 is hyperbolic). The hyperbolic versor was also discussed by [[#Macfarlane|Macfarlane (1892, 1894, 1900)]] in terms of [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s. The expression ε<sup>2</sup>=1 for hyperbolic motions (and ε<sup>2</sup>=-1 for elliptic, ε<sup>2</sup>=0 for parabolic motions) also appear in \"biquaternions\" defined by [[#Vahlen|Vahlen (1901/02, 1905)]].\n\nMore extended forms of complex and (bi-)quaternionic systems in terms of [[Clifford algebra]] can also be used to express the Lorentz transformations.

They were introduced in 1868 (belatedly published in 1872/73) by [[Gaston Darboux]]<ref group=M>Darboux (1872/73), p. 137</ref> as a system of five coordinates in ''R<sub>3</sub>'' (later called \"pentaspherical\" coordinates) in which the last coordinate is imaginary.

In Voigt's theory the speed of light is invariant, but his transformations mix up a relativistic boost together with a rescaling of space-time. Optical phenomena in free space are [[Scale invariance|scale]], [[Conformal map|conformal]] (using the factor λ discussed [[#Lorentz transformation via conformal, spherical wave, and Laguerre transformation|above]]), and [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]], so the combination is invariant too.<ref name=pais /> For instance, Lorentz transformations can be extended by using <math>l=\\sqrt{\\lambda}</math>:<ref group=R>Lorentz (1915/16), p. 197</ref>\n\n:<math>x^{\\prime}=\\gamma l\\left(x-vt\\right),\\quad y^{\\prime}=ly,\\quad z^{\\prime}=lz,\\quad t^{\\prime}=\\gamma l\\left(t-x\\frac{v}{c^{2}}\\right)</math>.\n\n''l''=1/γ gives the Voigt transformation, ''l''=1 the Lorentz transformation. But scale transformations are not a symmetry of all the laws of nature, only of electromagnetism, so these transformations cannot be used to formulate a [[principle of relativity]] in general. It was demonstrated by Poincaré and Einstein that one has to set ''l''=1 in order to make the above transformation symmetric and to form a group as required by the relativity principle, therefore the Lorentz transformation is the only viable choice.\n\nVoigt sent his 1887 paper to Lorentz in 1908,<ref>Voigt's transformations and the beginning of the relativistic revolution, Ricardo Heras, arXiv:1411.2559 [https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2559]</ref> and that was acknowledged in 1909: {{Quote|In a paper \"Über das Doppler'sche Princip\", published in 1887 (Gött.

In order to calculate the optics of moving bodies, Lorentz introduced the following quantities to transform from the aether system into a moving system (it's unknown whether he was influenced by Voigt, Heaviside, and Thomson)<ref group=R>Lorentz (1892a), p. 141</ref><ref name=milf>Miller (1982), 1.4 & 1.5</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\\text{original} & \\text{modern}\\\\\n\\hline \\left.\\begin{align}\\mathfrak{x} & =\\frac{V}{\\sqrt{V^{2}-p^{2}}}x\\\\\nt' & =t-\\frac{\\varepsilon}{V}\\mathfrak{x}\\\\\n\\varepsilon & =\\frac{p}{\\sqrt{V^{2}-p^{2}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\right| & \\begin{align}x^{\\prime} & =\\gamma x^{\\ast}=\\gamma(x-vt)\\\\\nt^{\\prime} & =t-\\frac{\\gamma^{2}vx^{\\ast}}{c^{2}}=\\gamma^{2}\\left(t-\\frac{vx}{c^{2}}\\right)\\\\\n\\gamma\\frac{v}{c} & =\\frac{v}{\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}\n\\end{align}\n\\end{matrix}</math>\n\nwhere ''x<sup>*</sup>'' is the [[Galilean transformation]] ''x-vt''. Except the additional γ in the time transformation, this is the complete Lorentz transformation ({{equationNote|4b}}).<ref name=milf /> While ''t'' is the \"true\" time for observers resting in the aether, ''t′'' is an auxiliary variable only for calculating processes for moving systems. It is also important that Lorentz and later also Larmor formulated this transformation in two steps. At first an implicit Galilean transformation, and later the expansion into the \"fictitious\" electromagnetic system with the aid of the Lorentz transformation. In order to explain the negative result of the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]], he (1892b)<ref group=R>Lorentz (1892b), p. 141</ref> introduced the additional hypothesis that also intermolecular forces are affected in a similar way and introduced [[length contraction]] in his theory (without proof as he admitted). The same hypothesis was already made by [[George FitzGerald]] in 1889 based on Heaviside's work. While length contraction was a real physical effect for Lorentz, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation.\n\nIn 1895, Lorentz further elaborated on his theory and introduced the \"theorem of corresponding states\". This theorem states that a moving observer (relative to the ether) in his \"fictitious\" field makes the same observations as a resting observers in his \"real\" field for velocities to first order in ''v/c''.

({{equationNote|5b}}) by the identity <math>\\csc\\theta=\\tfrac{1}{\\sin\\theta}</math>.}}\n\n==Euler's gap==\nIn pursuing the history in years before Lorentz enunciated his expressions, one looks to the essence of the concept. In mathematical terms, Lorentz transformations are [[squeeze mapping]]s, the linear transformations that turn a square into a rectangles of the same area. Before Euler, the squeezing was studied as [[Gregoire de Saint-Vincent|quadrature of the hyperbola]] and led to the [[hyperbolic sector|hyperbolic logarithm]]. In 1748 Euler issued his [[precalculus]] [[textbook]] where the number [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] is exploited for trigonometry in the [[unit circle]]. The first volume of [[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]] had no diagrams, allowing teachers and students to draw their own illustrations.\n\nThere is a gap in Euler's text where Lorentz transformations arise. A feature of [[natural logarithm]] is its interpretation as area in [[hyperbolic sector]]s. In relativity the classical concept of [[velocity]] is replaced with [[rapidity]], a [[hyperbolic angle]] concept built on hyperbolic sectors. A Lorentz transformation is a [[hyperbolic rotation]] which preserves differences of rapidity, just as the [[circular sector]] area is preserved with a circular rotation. Euler's gap is the lack of hyperbolic angle and [[hyperbolic function]]s, later developed by [[Johann H. Lambert]]. Euler described some [[transcendental function]]s: exponetiation and [[circular function]]s. He used the exponential series <math>\\sum_0^{\\infty} x^n /n! .</math> With the [[imaginary unit]] i<sup>2</sup> = – 1, and splitting the series into even and odd terms, he obtained\n:<math>e^{ix} = \\sum_0^{\\infty} (ix)^{2n}/(2n)! \\ + \\ \\sum_0^{\\infty} (ix)^{2n+1}/(2n + 1)! =</math>\n:<math>= \\sum_0^{\\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n} / 2n! + i \\sum_0^{\\infty} (-1)^n x^{2n+1}/(2n+1)! \\ = \\ \\cos x + i \\sin x .</math>\nThis development misses the alternative:\n:<math>e^x = \\cosh x + \\sinh x</math> (even and odd terms), and\n:<math>e^{jx} = \\cosh x + j \\sinh x \\quad (j^2 = +1) </math> which parametrizes the [[unit hyperbola]].\nHere Euler could have noted [[split-complex number]]s along with [[complex number]]s.\n\nFor physics, one space dimension is insufficient. But to extend split-complex arithmetic to four dimensions leads to [[hyperbolic quaternion]]s, and opens the door to [[abstract algebra]]’s \n[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Abstract_Algebra/Hypercomplex_numbers hypercomplex numbers]. Reviewing the expressions of Lorentz and Einstein, one observes that the [[Lorentz factor]] is an [[algebraic function]] of velocity.

He was also a proponent of [[dual quaternion]]s, which he termed \"octonions\" or \"Clifford biquaternions\".\n\nMcAulay was born on 9 December 1863 and attended [[Kingswood School]] in Bath. He proceeded to [[Caius College, Cambridge]], there taking up a study of the [[quaternion]] algebra. In 1883 he published an article \"Some general theorems in quaternion integration\".<ref>A. McAulay (1883) [[Messenger of Mathematics]] 13:26 to 37</ref> McAulay took his degree in 1886,<ref>{{acad|id=FML883A|name=McAulay, Alexander}}</ref> and began to reflect on the instruction of students in quaternion theory. In an article \"Establishment of the fundamental properties of quaternions\"<ref>McAulay (1888) ''Messenger of Mathematics'' 18:131 to 136</ref> he suggested improvements to the texts then in use. He also wrote a technical article<ref>A. McAulay (1888) \"The transformation of multiple surface integrals into multiple line integrals\", ''Messenger of Mathematics'' 18:139 to 45</ref> on [[integration (mathematics)|integration]].\n\nDeparting for [[Australia]], he lectured at Ormond College, [[University of Melbourne]] from 1893 to 1895. As a distant correspondent, he participated in a vigorous debate about the place of quaternions in [[physics education]].<ref>M.J. Crowe (1967) [[A History of Vector Analysis]], U. Notre Dame Press.

Intuitively recognizing its power, he snatches up the magnificent weapon which [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] tenders us all, and at once dashes off to the jungle on the quest of big game.<ref>PG Tait (1893) ''Nature'' 28 December</ref>\n\nMcAulay took up the position of Professor of Physics in Tasmania from 1896 until 1929, at which time his son Alexander Leicester McAulay took over the position for the next thirty years.\n\nFollowing [[William Kingdon Clifford]] who had extended quaternions to [[dual quaternion]]s, McAulay made a special study of this [[hypercomplex number]] system. In 1898 McAulay published, through [[Cambridge University Press]], his ''Octonions: a Development of Clifford's Biquaternions''.\n\nMcAulay died on 6 July 1931. \nHis brother [[Francis Macaulay]], who stayed in England, also contributed to [[ring theory]].

      "text": "A [[scientific society]], the '''Quaternion Society''' was an \"International Association for Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics\". At its peak it consisted of about 60 mathematicians spread throughout the academic world that were experimenting with [[quaternion]]s and other [[hypercomplex number]] systems. The guiding light was [[Alexander Macfarlane]] who served as its Secretary initially, and became President in 1909. The Association published a ''Bibliography'' in 1904 and a ''Bulletin'' (annual report) from 1900 to 1913.\n\nThe ''Bulletin'' became a [[review journal]] for topics in [[vector analysis]] and [[abstract algebra]] such as the theory of [[equipollence (geometry)|equipollence]]. The mathematical work reviewed pertained largely to [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] and [[linear algebra]] as the methods were in rapid development at the time.\n==Genesis==\nIn 1895, Professor P. Molenbroek of The Hague, Holland, and Shinkichi Kimura studying at Yale put out a call for scholars to form the society in widely circulated journals: [[Nature (journal)|Nature]],<ref>S. Kimura & P. Molenbroek (1895) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v52/n1353/pdf/052545a0.pdf Friends and Fellow Workers in Quaternions] [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 52:545–6 (#1353)</ref> [[Science (journal)|Science]],<ref>S.

The algebra of space ought to include the algebra of the plane as a special case, just as the algebra of the plane includes the algebra of the line…When vector analysis is developed and presented...we may expect to see many zealous cultivators, many fruitful applications, and, finally, universal diffusion...May the movement initiated by Messrs. Molenbroek and Kimura hasten the realization of this happy result.<ref>A. Macfarlane (1896) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1624707 Quaternions] [[Science (journal)|Science]] (2) 3:99–100, link from [[Jstor]] early content</ref>\n\nIn 1897 the [[British Association]] met in [[Toronto]] where vector products were discussed:\n:Professor [[Olaus Henrici|Henrici]] proposed a new notation to denote the different products of vectors, which consists in using square brackets for vector products and round brackets for scalar products. He likewise advocated adoption of Heaviside’s term \"ort\" for vector, the [[tensor of a quaternion|tensor]] of which is the number 1. Prof. A. Macfarlane read a communication on the solution of the cubic equation in which he explained how the two binomials in [[cubic function#Cardano’s method|Cardano’s formula]] may be treated as complex quantities, either circular or hyperbolic, all the roots of the cubic can then be deduced by a general method.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v56/n1454/pdf/056461a0.pdf \"Physics at the British Association\"]  [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 56:461,2 (# 1454)</ref>\n\nA system of national secretaries was announced in the AMS Bulletin in 1899: [[Alexander McAulay]] for Australasia, [[Victor Schlegel]] for Germany, Joly for Great Britain and Ireland, Giuseppe Peano for Italy, Kimura for Japan, [[Aleksandr Kotelnikov]] for Russia, [[F. Kraft]] for Switzerland, and [[Arthur Stafford Hathaway]] for the USA. For France the national secretary was Paul Genty, an engineer with the division of Ponts et Chaussees, and a quaternion collaborator with [[Charles-Ange Laisant]], author of ''Methode des Quaterniones'' (1881).\n\n[[Victor Schlegel]] reported<ref>[[Victor Schlegel]] (1899) \"Internationaler Verein zur Beförderung des Studiums der Quaternionen und verwandter Systeme der Mathematik\", [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]] 10(1):376</ref> on the new institution in the [[Monatshefte für Mathematik]].\n\n==Officers==\nWhen the Society was organized in 1899, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] was chosen as president, but he declined for reasons of poor health.\n\nThe first President was [[Robert Stawell Ball]] and [[Alexander Macfarlane]] served as Secretary and Treasurer. In 1905 [[Charles Jasper Joly]] took over as President and L. van Elfrinkhof as Treasurer while Macfarlane continued as Secretary. In 1909 Macfarlane became President, James Byrnie Shaw became Secretary, and van Elfrinkhof continued as Treasurer. The next year Macfarlane and Shaw continued in their posts while Macfarlane also absorbed the office of Treasurer. When Macfarlane died in 1913 after nearly completing the issue of the Bulletin, Shaw completed it and wound up the Association.\n\nThe rules state that the President had the power of veto.\n\n==Bulletin==\nThe ''Bulletin of the Association Promoting the Study of Quaternions and Allied Systems of Mathematics'' was issued nine times under the editorship of Alexander Macfarlane. Every issue listed the officers of the Association, governing council, rules, members, and a [[financial statement]] from the [[treasurer]].

This property characterizes spinors.  It is also possible to associate a substantially similar notion of spinor to [[Minkowski space]] in which case the [[Lorentz transformation]]s of [[special relativity]] play the role of rotations. Spinors were introduced in geometry by [[Élie Cartan]]  in 1913.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cartan|1913}}.</ref><ref name=\"cartan-1966-quote\">Quote from Elie Cartan: ''The Theory of Spinors'', Hermann, Paris, 1966, first sentence of the Introduction section of the beginning of the book (before the page numbers start): \"Spinors were first used under that name, by physicists, in the field of Quantum Mechanics. In their most general form, spinors were discovered in 1913 by the author of this work, in his investigations on the linear representations of simple groups*; they provide a linear representation of the group of rotations in a space with any number <math>n</math> of dimensions, each spinor having <math>2^\\nu</math> components where <math>n = 2\\nu+1</math>  or <math>2\\nu</math>.\" The star (*) refers to Cartan 1913.</ref>  In the 1920s physicists  discovered that spinors are essential to describe the [[intrinsic angular momentum]], or \"spin\", of the [[electron]] and other subatomic particles.<ref group=\"nb\">More precisely, it is the [[fermion]]s of [[spin-1/2]] that are described by spinors, which is true both in the relativistic and non-relativistic theory. The wavefunction of the non-relativistic electron has values in 2 component spinors transforming under three-dimensional infinitesimal rotations. The relativistic [[Dirac equation]] for the electron is an equation for 4 component spinors transforming under infinitesimal Lorentz transformations for which a substantially similar theory of spinors exists.</ref>\n\nSpinors are characterized by the specific way in which they behave under rotations.  They change in different ways depending not just on the overall final rotation, but the details of how that rotation was achieved (by a continuous path in the [[rotation group]]).  There are two topologically distinguishable classes ([[homotopy class]]es) of paths through rotations that result in the same overall rotation, as famously illustrated by the [[belt trick]] puzzle ([[#Introduction|below]]).  These two inequivalent classes yield spinor transformations of opposite sign.  The [[spin group]] is the group of all rotations keeping track of the class.<ref group=\"nb\">Formally, the spin group is the group of [[relative homotopy class]]es with fixed endpoints in the rotation group.</ref> It doubly covers the rotation group, since each rotation can be obtained in two inequivalent ways as the endpoint of a path. The space of spinors by definition is equipped with a (complex) [[linear representation]] of the spin group, meaning that elements of the spin group [[Group action (mathematics)|act]] as linear transformations on the space of spinors, in a way that genuinely depends on the homotopy class.<ref group = \"nb\">More formally, the space of spinors can be defined as an ([[irreducible representation|irreducible]]) representation of the spin group that does not factor through a representation of the rotation group (in general, the connected component of the identity of the [[orthogonal group]]).</ref> In mathematical terms, spinors are described by a double-valued [[projective representation]] of the rotation group SO(3).\n\nAlthough spinors can be defined purely as elements of a representation space of the spin group (or its [[Lie algebra]] of infinitesimal rotations), they are typically defined as elements of a vector space that carries a linear representation of the [[Clifford algebra]]. The Clifford algebra is an [[associative algebra]] that can be constructed from Euclidean space and its inner product in a basis-independent way.  Both the spin group and its Lie algebra are embedded inside the Clifford algebra in a natural way, and in applications the Clifford algebra is often the easiest to work with.<ref group=\"nb\">[[Geometric algebra]] is a name for the Clifford algebra in an applied setting.</ref> After choosing an orthonormal basis of Euclidean space, a representation of the  Clifford algebra is generated by  [[gamma matrices]], matrices that satisfy a set of canonical anti-commutation relations.  The spinors are the column vectors on which these matrices act.   In three Euclidean dimensions, for instance,  the [[Pauli spin matrices]] are a set of gamma matrices,<ref group = \"nb\">the Pauli matrices correspond to [[angular momentum operator|angular momenta]] operators about the three coordinate axes. This makes them slightly a-typical gamma matrices because in addition to their anti commutation relation they also satisfy commutation relations</ref> and the two-component complex [[column vector]]s on which these matrices act are spinors.  However, the particular matrix representation of the Clifford algebra, hence what precisely constitutes a \"column vector\" (or spinor), involves the choice of basis and gamma matrices in an essential way.   As a representation of the spin group, this realization of spinors as (complex<ref group=\"nb\">The [[metric signature]] relevant as well if we are concerned with real spinors.  See [[spin representation]].</ref>) column vectors will either be [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] if the dimension is odd, or it will decompose into a pair of so-called \"half-spin\" or Weyl representations if the dimension is even.<ref group=\"nb\">Whether the representation decomposes depends on whether they are regarded as representations of the spin group (or its Lie algebra), in which case it decomposes in even but not odd dimensions, or the Clifford algebra when it is the other way around.  Other structures than this decomposition can also exist; precise criteria are covered at [[spin representation]] and [[Clifford algebra]].</ref>\n\n== Introduction ==\n{{multiple image|image1=Belt trick 2.gif|image2=Belt trick 1.gif|footer=A gradual rotation can be visualized as a ribbon in space.<ref group=\"nb\">The [[TNB frame]] of the ribbon defines a rotation continuously for each value of the arc length parameter.</ref> Two gradual rotations with different classes, one through 360° and one through 720° are illustrated here in the [[belt trick]] puzzle.

A solution, shown in the second animation, gives an explicit [[homotopy]] in the rotation group between the 720° rotation and the 0° identity rotation.}}\n\n[[File:Belt Trick.ogg|thumb|An object attached to belts or strings can spin continuously without becoming tangled.

In the limit, a piece of solid continuous space can rotate in place like this without tearing or intersecting itself]]\n\nWhat characterizes spinors and distinguishes them from [[geometric vector]]s and other tensors is subtle.  Consider applying a rotation to the coordinates of a system.  No object in the system itself has moved, only the coordinates have, so there will always be a compensating change in those coordinate values when applied to any object of the system.  Geometrical vectors, for example, have components that will undergo ''the same'' rotation as the coordinates.  More broadly, any [[tensor]] associated with the system (for instance, the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress]] of some medium) also has coordinate descriptions that adjust to compensate for changes to the coordinate system itself.  Spinors do not appear at this level of the description of a physical system, when one is concerned only with the properties of a single isolated rotation of the coordinates.  Rather, spinors appear when we imagine that instead of a single rotation, the coordinate system is gradually ([[continuous function|continuously]]) rotated between some initial and final configuration.  For any of the familiar and intuitive (\"tensorial\") quantities associated with the system, the transformation law does not depend on the precise details of how the coordinates arrived at their final configuration.  Spinors, on the other hand, are constructed in such a way that makes them ''sensitive'' to how the gradual rotation of the coordinates arrived there: they exhibit path-dependence.  It turns out that, for any final configuration of the coordinates, there are actually two (\"[[topology|topologically]]\") inequivalent ''gradual'' (continuous) rotations of the coordinate system that result in this same configuration.  This ambiguity is called the [[homotopy class]] of the gradual rotation.  The [[belt trick]] puzzle (shown) famously demonstrates two different rotations, one through an angle of 2π and the other through an angle of 4π, having the same final configurations but different classes.  Spinors actually exhibit a sign-reversal that genuinely depends on this homotopy class.  This distinguishes them from vectors and other tensors, none of which can feel the class.\n\nSpinors can be exhibited as concrete objects using a choice of [[Cartesian coordinates]].  In three Euclidean dimensions, for instance, spinors can be constructed by making a choice of [[Pauli spin matrices]] corresponding to ([[angular momentum operator|angular momenta]] about) the three coordinate axes. These are 2×2 matrices with [[complex number|complex]] entries, and the two-component complex [[column vector]]s on which these matrices act by [[matrix multiplication]] are the spinors.  In this case, the spin group is isomorphic to the group of 2×2 [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] with [[determinant]] one, which naturally sits inside the matrix algebra.  This group acts by conjugation on the real vector space spanned by the Pauli matrices themselves,<ref group=\"nb\">This is the set of 2×2 complex [[trace (mathematics)|traceless]] [[hermitian matrix|hermitian matrices]].</ref> realizing it as a group of rotations among them,<ref group=\"nb\">Except for a [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of <math>\\{\\pm 1\\}</math> corresponding to the two different elements of the spin group that go to the same rotation.</ref> but it also acts on the column vectors (that is, the spinors).\n\nMore generally, a Clifford algebra can be constructed from any vector space ''V'' equipped with a (nondegenerate) [[quadratic form]], such as [[Euclidean space]] with its standard dot product or [[Minkowski space]] with its standard Lorentz metric.  The [[spin group|space of spinors]] is the space of column vectors with <math>2^{\\lfloor\\dim V/2\\rfloor}</math> components. The orthogonal Lie algebra  (i.e., the infinitesimal \"rotations\") and the spin group associated to the quadratic form are both (canonically) contained in the Clifford algebra, so every Clifford algebra representation also defines a representation of the Lie algebra and the spin group.<ref group=\"nb\">So the ambiguity in identifying the spinors themselves persists from the point of view of the group theory, and still depends on choices.</ref> Depending on the dimension and [[metric signature]], this realization of spinors as column vectors may be [[irreducible representation|irreducible]] or it may decompose into a pair of so-called \"half-spin\" or Weyl representations.<ref group=\"nb\">The Clifford algebra can be given an even/odd [[graded algebra|grading]] from the parity of the degree in the gammas, and the spin group and its Lie algebra both lie in the even part.  Whether here by \"representation\" we mean representations of the spin group or the Clifford algebra will affect the determination of their reducibility.  Other structures than this splitting can also exist; precise criteria are covered at [[spin representation]] and [[Clifford algebra]].</ref> When the vector space ''V'' is four-dimensional, the algebra is described by the [[gamma matrices]].\n\n== Mathematical definition ==\n\nThe space of spinors is formally defined as the [[fundamental representation]] of the [[Clifford algebra]].  (This may or may not decompose into irreducible representations.)  The space of spinors may also be defined as a [[spin representation]] of the [[orthogonal Lie algebra]].  These spin representations are also characterized as the finite-dimensional projective representations of the special orthogonal group that do not factor through linear representations.  Equivalently, a spinor is an element of a finite-dimensional [[group representation]] of the [[spin group]] on which the [[center of a group|center]] acts non-trivially.\n\n===Overview===\nThere are essentially two frameworks for viewing the notion of a spinor.\n\nOne is [[representation theory|representation theoretic]]. In this point of view, one knows beforehand that there are some representations of the [[Lie algebra]] of the [[orthogonal group]] that cannot be formed by the usual tensor constructions. These missing representations are then labeled the '''[[spin representation]]s''', and their constituents ''spinors''. In this view, a spinor must belong to a [[group representation|representation]] of the [[covering space|double cover]] of the [[special orthogonal group|rotation group]] {{nowrap|SO(''n'', '''R''')}}, or more generally of double cover of the [[generalized special orthogonal group]] {{nowrap|SO<sup>+</sup>(''p'', ''q'', '''R''')}} on spaces with [[metric signature]] {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}. These double covers are [[Lie groups]], called the [[spin group]]s {{nowrap|Spin(''n'')}} or {{nowrap|Spin(''p'', ''q'')}}. All the properties of spinors, and their applications and derived objects, are manifested first in the spin group. Representations of the double covers of these groups yield double-valued [[projective representation]]s of the groups themselves. (This means that the action of a particular rotation on vectors the quantum Hilbert space is only defined up to a sign.)\n\nThe other point of view is geometrical. One can explicitly construct the spinors, and then examine how they behave under the action of the relevant Lie groups. This latter approach has the advantage of providing a concrete and elementary description of what a spinor is. However, such a description becomes unwieldy when complicated properties of spinors, such as [[Fierz identity|Fierz identities]], are needed.\n\n=== Clifford algebras ===\n{{details|Clifford algebra}}\n\nThe language of [[Clifford algebra]]s<ref>Named after [[William Kingdon Clifford]],</ref> (sometimes called [[geometric algebra]]s) provides a complete picture of the spin representations of all the spin groups, and the various relationships between those representations, via the [[classification of Clifford algebras]]. It largely removes the need for ''ad hoc'' constructions.\n\nIn detail, let ''V'' be a finite-dimensional complex vector space with nondegenerate bilinear form ''g''. The Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} is the algebra generated by ''V'' along with the anticommutation relation {{nowrap|1=''xy'' + ''yx'' = 2''g''(''x'', ''y'')}}. It is an abstract version of the algebra generated by the [[gamma matrices|gamma]] or [[Pauli matrices]]. If ''V'' = '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, with the standard form {{nowrap|1=''g''(''x'', ''y'') = ''x''<sup>t</sup>''y'' = ''x''<sub>1</sub>''y''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''x''<sub>n</sub>''y''<sub>''n''</sub>}} we denote the Clifford algebra by Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C'''). Since by the choice of an orthonormal basis every complex vectorspace with non-degenerate form is isomorphic to this standard example, this notation is abused more generally if  {{nowrap|1=dim<sub>'''C'''</sub>(''V'') = ''n''}}. If {{nowrap|1=''n''  = 2''k''}} is even, Cℓ<sub>''n''</sub>('''C''') is isomorphic as an algebra (in a non-unique way) to the algebra {{nowrap|Mat(2<sup>''k''</sup>, '''C''')}} of {{nowrap|2<sup>''k''</sup> × 2<sup>''k''</sup>}} complex matrices (by the [[Artin-Wedderburn theorem]] and the easy to prove fact that the Clifford algebra is [[central simple algebra|central simple]]). If {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''k'' + 1}} is odd, Cℓ<sub>2''k''+1</sub>('''C''') is isomorphic to the algebra {{nowrap|Mat(2<sup>''k''</sup>, '''C''') ⊕ Mat(2<sup>''k''</sup>, '''C''')}} of two copies of the {{nowrap|2<sup>''k''</sup> × 2<sup>''k''</sup>}} complex matrices. Therefore, in either case {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}}  has a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible representation (also called simple [[Clifford module]]), commonly denoted by Δ, of dimension 2<sup>[''n''/2]</sup>. Since the Lie algebra {{nowrap|'''so'''(''V'', ''g'')}} is embedded as a Lie subalgebra in {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} equipped with the Clifford algebra [[commutator]] as Lie bracket, the space Δ is also a Lie algebra representation of {{nowrap|'''so'''(''V'', ''g'')}} called a [[spin representation]]. If ''n'' is odd, this Lie algebra representation is irreducible. If ''n'' is even, it splits further into two irreducible representations {{nowrap|1=Δ = Δ<sub>+</sub> ⊕ Δ<sub>−</sub>}} called the Weyl or ''half-spin representations''.\n\nIrreducible representations over the reals in the case when ''V'' is a real vector space are much more intricate, and the reader is referred to the [[Clifford algebra#Spinors|Clifford algebra]] article for more details.\n\n=== Spin groups ===\n[[File:Spin representations do not lift.svg|thumb|right|The spin representation Δ is a vector space equipped with a representation of the spin group that does not factor through a representation of the (special) orthogonal group. The vertical arrows depict a [[short exact sequence]].]]\nSpinors form a [[vector space]], usually over the [[complex numbers]], equipped with a linear [[group representation]] of the [[spin group]] that does not factor through a representation of the group of rotations (see diagram).  The spin group is the [[special orthogonal group|group of rotations]] keeping track of the homotopy class. Spinors are needed to encode basic information about the topology of the group of rotations because that group is not [[simply connected]], but the simply connected spin group is its [[Double covering group|double cover]].  So for every rotation there are two elements of the spin group that represent it.  [[Geometric vector]]s and other [[tensor]]s cannot feel the difference between these two elements, but they produce ''opposite'' signs when they affect any spinor under the representation.  Thinking of the elements of the spin group as [[homotopy classes]] of one-parameter families of rotations, each rotation is represented by two distinct homotopy classes of paths to the identity.  If a one-parameter family of rotations is visualized as a ribbon in space, with the arc length parameter of that ribbon being the parameter (its tangent, normal, binormal frame actually gives the rotation), then these two distinct homotopy classes are visualized in the two states of the [[belt trick]] puzzle (above).  The space of spinors is an auxiliary vector space that can be constructed explicitly in coordinates, but ultimately only exists up to isomorphism in that there is no \"natural\" construction of them that does not rely on arbitrary choices such as coordinate systems.  A notion of spinors can be associated, as such an auxiliary mathematical object, with any vector space equipped with a [[quadratic form]] such as [[Euclidean space]] with its standard [[dot product]], or [[Minkowski space]] with its [[Lorentz metric]].  In the latter case, the \"rotations\" include the [[Lorentz boost]]s, but otherwise the theory is substantially similar.\n\n=== Terminology in physics ===\nThe constructions given above, in terms of Clifford algebra or representation theory, can be thought of as defining spinors as geometric objects in zero-dimensional [[space-time]]. To obtain the spinors of physics, such as the [[Dirac spinor]], one extends the construction to obtain a [[spin structure]] on 4-dimensional space-time ([[Minkowski space]]). Effectively, one starts with the [[tangent manifold]] of space-time, each point of which is a 4-dimensional vector space with ''SO''(3,1) symmetry, and then builds the [[spin group]] at each point. The neighborhoods of points are endowed with concepts of smoothness and differentiability: the standard construction is one of a [[fibre bundle]], the fibers of which are affine spaces transforming under the spin group. After constructing the fiber bundle, one may then consider differential equations, such as the [[Dirac equation]], or the [[Weyl equation]] on the fiber bundle. These equations (Dirac or Weyl) have solutions that are [[plane wave]]s, having symmetries characteristic of the fibers, ''i.e.'' having the symmetries of spinors, as obtained from the (zero-dimensional) Clifford algebra/spin representation theory described above. Such plane-wave solutions (or other solutions) of the differential equations can then properly be called [[fermion]]s; fermions have the algebraic qualities of spinors. By general convention, the terms \"fermion\" and \"spinor\" are often used interchangeably in physics, as synonyms of one-another.\n\nIt appears that all [[fundamental particle]]s in nature that are spin-1/2 are described by the Dirac equation, with the possible exception of the [[neutrino]]. There does not seem to be any ''a priori'' reason why this would be the case. A perfectly valid choice for spinors would be the non-complexified version of {{nowrap|Cℓ<sub>''2'',''2''</sub>('''R''')}}, the [[Majorana spinor]].<ref>Named after [[Ettore Majorana]].</ref> There also does not seem to be any particular prohibition to having [[Weyl spinor]]s appear in nature as fundamental particles.\n\nThe Dirac, Weyl, and Majorana spinors are interrelated, and their relation can be elucidated on the basis of real geometric algebra.<ref>Matthew R. Francis, Arthur Kosowsky: ''The Construction of Spinors in Geometric Algebra'', submitted 20 March 2004, version of 18 October 2004 [https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0403040v2 arXiv:math-ph/0403040]</ref> Dirac and Weyl spinors are complex representations while Majorana spinors are real representations.\n\nWeyl spinors are insufficient to describe massive particles, such as [[electron]]s, since the Weyl plane-wave solutions necessarily travel at the speed of light; for massive particles, the [[Dirac equation]] is needed. The initial construction of the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics starts with both the electron and the neutrino as massless Weyl spinors; the [[Higgs mechanism]] gives electrons a mass; the classical [[neutrino]] remained massless, and was thus an example of a Weyl spinor.<ref>More precisely, the electron starts out as two massless Weyl spinors, left and right-handed. Upon symmetry breaking, both gain a mass, and are coupled to form a Dirac spinor.</ref>  However, because of observed [[neutrino oscillation]], it is now believed that they are not Weyl spinors, but perhaps instead Majorana spinors.<ref>{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Wilczek|first=Frank|authorlink=Frank Wilczek|title=Majorana returns|journal=Nature Physics|volume=5|issue=9|year=2009|doi=10.1038/nphys1380|pages=614–618|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers]]|issn=1745-2473|bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..614W }}</ref> It is not known whether Weyl spinor fundamental particles exist in nature.  \n\nThe situation for [[condensed matter physics]] is different: one can can construct two and three-dimensional \"spacetimes\" in a large variety of different physical materials, ranging from [[semiconductor]]s to far more exotic materials.

At a more profound level, spinors have been found to be at the heart of approaches to the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]], and to provide constructions in particular for [[discrete series]] representations of [[semisimple group]]s.\n\nThe spin representations of the special orthogonal Lie algebras are distinguished from the [[tensor]] representations given by [[Young symmetrizer|Weyl's construction]] by the [[weight (representation theory)|weights]]. Whereas the weights of the tensor representations are integer linear combinations of the roots of the Lie algebra, those of the spin representations are half-integer linear combinations thereof. Explicit details can be found in the [[spin representation]] article.\n\n=== Attempts at intuitive understanding ===\nThe spinor can be described, in simple terms, as \"vectors of a space the transformations of which are related in a particular way to rotations in physical space\".<ref>Jean Hladik: ''Spinors in Physics'', translated by J.

This is an algebra built up from an orthonormal basis of {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''p'' + ''q''}} mutually orthogonal vectors under addition and multiplication, ''p'' of which have norm +1 and ''q'' of which have norm −1, with the product rule for the basis vectors\n\n:<math>e_i e_j = \\Bigg\\{ \\begin{matrix} +1 & i=j, \\, i \\in (1 \\ldots p) \\\\\n                                   -1  &  i=j, \\, i \\in (p+1 \\ldots n)  \\\\\n                                   - e_j e_i &   i \\not = j. \\end{matrix}</math>\n\n=== Two dimensions ===\nThe Clifford algebra Cℓ<sub>2,0</sub>('''R''') is built up from a basis of one unit scalar, 1, two orthogonal unit vectors, ''σ''<sub>1</sub> and ''σ''<sub>2</sub>, and one unit [[pseudoscalar]] {{nowrap|1=''i'' = ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>}}. From the definitions above, it is evident that {{nowrap|1=(''σ''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 1}}, and {{nowrap|1=(''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>)(''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>) = −''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub> = −1}}.\n\nThe even subalgebra Cℓ<sup>0</sup><sub>2,0</sub>('''R'''), spanned by ''even-graded'' basis elements of Cℓ<sub>2,0</sub>('''R'''), determines the space of spinors via its representations. It is made up of real linear combinations of 1 and ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>. As a real algebra, Cℓ<sup>0</sup><sub>2,0</sub>('''R''') is isomorphic to the field of [[complex numbers]] '''C'''. As a result, it admits a conjugation operation (analogous to [[complex conjugate|complex conjugation]]), sometimes called the ''reverse'' of a Clifford element, defined by\n:<math>(a+b\\sigma_1\\sigma_2)^* = a+b\\sigma_2\\sigma_1\\,</math>.\nwhich, by the Clifford relations, can be written\n:<math>(a+b\\sigma_1\\sigma_2)^* = a+b\\sigma_2\\sigma_1 = a-b\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\,</math>.\n\nThe action of an even Clifford element {{nowrap|''γ'' ∈ Cℓ<sup>0</sup><sub>2,0</sub>('''R''')}} on vectors, regarded as 1-graded elements of Cℓ<sub>2,0</sub>('''R'''), is determined by mapping a general vector {{nowrap|1=''u'' = ''a''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub> + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>}} to the vector\n:<math>\\gamma(u) = \\gamma u \\gamma^*\\,</math>,\nwhere ''γ''<sup>∗</sup> is the conjugate of ''γ'', and the product is Clifford multiplication. In this situation, a '''spinor'''<ref>These are the right-handed Weyl spinors in two dimensions. For the left-handed Weyl spinors, the representation is via {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''ϕ'') = ''{{overline|γ}}ϕ''}}. The Majorana spinors are the common underlying real representation for the Weyl representations.</ref> is an ordinary complex number. The action of ''γ'' on a spinor ''φ'' is given by ordinary complex multiplication:\n:<math> \\gamma(\\phi) = \\gamma\\phi</math>.\n\nAn important feature of this definition is the distinction between ordinary vectors and spinors, manifested in how the even-graded elements act on each of them in different ways. In general, a quick check of the Clifford relations reveals that even-graded elements conjugate-commute with ordinary vectors:\n:<math> \\gamma(u) = \\gamma u \\gamma^* = \\gamma^2 u\\,</math>.\nOn the other hand, comparing with the action on spinors {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''φ'') = ''γφ''}}, ''γ'' on ordinary vectors acts as the ''square'' of its action on spinors.\n\nConsider, for example, the implication this has for plane rotations. Rotating a vector through an angle of ''θ'' corresponds to {{nowrap|1=''γ''<sup>2</sup> = exp(''θ σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>)}}, so that the corresponding action on spinors is via {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = ± exp(''θ σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>/2)}}. In general, because of [[branch cut|logarithmic branching]], it is impossible to choose a sign in a consistent way. Thus the representation of plane rotations on spinors is two-valued.\n\nIn applications of spinors in two dimensions, it is common to exploit the fact that the algebra of even-graded elements (that is just the ring of complex numbers) is identical to the space of spinors. So, by [[abuse of notation|abuse of language]], the two are often conflated. One may then talk about \"the action of a spinor on a vector.\" In a general setting, such statements are meaningless. But in dimensions 2 and 3 (as applied, for example, to [[computer graphics]]) they make sense.\n\n;Examples\n* The even-graded element\n::<math>\\gamma = \\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) \\,</math>\n:corresponds to a vector rotation of 90° from ''σ''<sub>1</sub> around towards ''σ''<sub>2</sub>, which can be checked by confirming that\n::<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} (1 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) \\, \\{a_1\\sigma_1+a_2\\sigma_2\\} \\, (1 - \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1) = a_1\\sigma_2 - a_2\\sigma_1 \\,</math>\n:It corresponds to a spinor rotation of only 45°, however:\n::<math>\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} (1 - \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) \\, \\{a_1+a_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\}=\n\\frac{a_1+a_2}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{-a_1+a_2}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sigma_1\\sigma_2</math>\n\n* Similarly the even-graded element {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = −''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>}} corresponds to a vector rotation of 180°:\n::<math> (- \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) \\, \\{a_1\\sigma_1 + a_2\\sigma_2\\} \\, (- \\sigma_2 \\sigma_1) = - a_1\\sigma_1 -a_2\\sigma_2 \\,</math>\n: but a spinor rotation of only 90°:\n::<math>(- \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2) \\, \\{a_1 + a_2\\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\}\n=a_2 - a_1\\sigma_1\\sigma_2</math>\n* Continuing on further, the even-graded element {{nowrap|1=''γ'' = −1}} corresponds to a vector rotation of 360°:\n::<math> (-1) \\, \\{a_1\\sigma_1+a_2\\sigma_2\\} \\, (-1) = a_1\\sigma_1+a_2\\sigma_2 \\,</math>\n: but a spinor rotation of 180°.\n\n=== Three dimensions ===\n{{Main|Spinors in three dimensions|Quaternions and spatial rotation}}\n\nThe Clifford algebra Cℓ<sub>3,0</sub>('''R''') is built up from a basis of one unit scalar, 1, three orthogonal unit vectors, ''σ''<sub>1</sub>, ''σ''<sub>2</sub> and ''σ''<sub>3</sub>, the three unit bivectors ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>, ''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>, ''σ''<sub>3</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub> and the [[pseudoscalar]] {{nowrap|1=''i'' = ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>}}. It is straightforward to show that {{nowrap|1=(''σ''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 1}}, and {{nowrap|1=(''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>3</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = (''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = −1}}.\n\nThe sub-algebra of even-graded elements is made up of scalar dilations,\n:<math>u^{\\prime} = \\rho^{(1/2)} u \\rho^{(1/2)} = \\rho u, </math>\nand vector rotations\n:<math>u^{\\prime} = \\gamma \\, u \\, \\gamma^*, </math>\nwhere\n:<math>\\left.\\begin{array}{rcl} \\gamma & = & \\cos(\\theta/2) - \\{a_1 \\sigma_2\\sigma_3 + a_2 \\sigma_3\\sigma_1 + a_3 \\sigma_1\\sigma_2\\} \\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\\n& = & \\cos(\\theta/2) - i \\{a_1 \\sigma_1 + a_2 \\sigma_2 + a_3 \\sigma_3\\} \\sin(\\theta/2) \\\\\n& = & \\cos(\\theta/2) - i v \\sin(\\theta/2) \\end{array}\\right\\}</math> (1)\ncorresponds to a vector rotation through an angle ''θ'' about an axis defined by a unit vector {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''a''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub> + ''a''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub> + ''a''<sub>3</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>}}.\n\nAs a special case, it is easy to see that, if {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''σ''<sub>3</sub>}}, this reproduces the ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub> rotation considered in the previous section; and that such rotation leaves the coefficients of vectors in the ''σ''<sub>3</sub> direction invariant, since\n:<math>(\\cos(\\theta/2) - i \\sigma_3 \\sin(\\theta/2)) \\, \\sigma_3 \\, (\\cos(\\theta/2) + i \\sigma_3 \\sin(\\theta/2))\n= (\\cos^2(\\theta/2) + \\sin^2(\\theta/2)) \\, \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_3.</math>\n\nThe bivectors ''σ''<sub>2</sub>''σ''<sub>3</sub>, ''σ''<sub>3</sub>''σ''<sub>1</sub> and ''σ''<sub>1</sub>''σ''<sub>2</sub> are in fact [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton's]] [[quaternion]]s '''i''', '''j''' and '''k''', discovered in 1843:\n:<math>\\begin{matrix}\\mathbf{i} = -\\sigma_2 \\sigma_3 = -i \\sigma_1 \\\\\n\\mathbf{j} = -\\sigma_3 \\sigma_1 = -i \\sigma_2 \\\\\n\\mathbf{k} = -\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 = -i \\sigma_3. \\end{matrix}</math>\n\nWith the identification of the even-graded elements with the algebra '''H''' of quaternions, as in the case of two dimensions the only representation of the algebra of even-graded elements is on itself.<ref>Since, for a [[skew field]], the kernel of the representation must be trivial. So inequivalent representations can only arise via an [[automorphism]] of the skew-field. In this case, there are a pair of equivalent representations: {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''ϕ'') = ''γϕ''}}, and its quaternionic conjugate {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''ϕ'') = ''ϕ{{overline|γ}}''}}.</ref> Thus the (real<ref>The complex spinors are obtained as the representations of the [[tensor product]] {{nowrap|1='''H''' ⊗<sub>'''R'''</sub> '''C''' = Mat<sub>2</sub>('''C''')}}. These are considered in more detail in [[spinors in three dimensions]].</ref>) spinors in three-dimensions are quaternions, and the action of an even-graded element on a spinor is given by ordinary quaternionic multiplication.\n\nNote that the expression (1) for a vector rotation through an angle {{mvar|θ}}, ''the angle appearing in γ was halved''. Thus the spinor rotation {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''ψ'') = ''γψ''}} (ordinary quaternionic multiplication) will rotate the spinor {{mvar|ψ}} through an angle one-half the measure of the angle of the corresponding vector rotation. Once again, the problem of lifting a vector rotation to a spinor rotation is two-valued: the expression (1) with {{nowrap|(180° + ''θ''/2)}} in place of ''θ''/2 will produce the same vector rotation, but the negative of the spinor rotation.\n\nThe spinor/quaternion representation of rotations in 3D is becoming increasingly prevalent in computer geometry and other applications, because of the notable brevity of the corresponding spin matrix, and the simplicity with which they can be multiplied together to calculate the combined effect of successive rotations about different axes.\n\n== Explicit constructions ==\n\nA space of spinors can be constructed explicitly with concrete and abstract constructions. The\nequivalence of these constructions are a consequence of the uniqueness of the spinor representation of the complex Clifford algebra. For a complete example in dimension 3, see [[spinors in three dimensions]].\n\n=== Component spinors ===\n\nGiven a vector space ''V'' and a quadratic form ''g'' an explicit matrix representation of the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} can be defined as follows. Choose an orthonormal basis {{nowrap|''e''<sup>1</sup> … ''e''<sup>n</sup>}} for ''V'' i.e. {{nowrap|1=''g''(''e''<sup>''μ''</sup>''e''<sup>''ν''</sup>) = ''η''<sup>''μν''</sup>}} where {{nowrap|1=''η''<sup>''μμ''</sup> = ±1}} and {{nowrap|1=''η''<sup>''μν''</sup> = 0}} for {{nowrap|''μ'' ≠ ''ν''}}. Let {{nowrap|1=''k'' = ⌊''n''/2⌋}}. Fix a set of {{nowrap|2<sup>''k''</sup> × 2<sup>''k''</sup>}} matrices {{nowrap|''γ''<sup>1</sup> … ''γ''<sup>''n''</sup>}} such that {{nowrap|1=''γ''<sup>''μ''</sup>''γ''<sup>''ν''</sup> + ''γ''<sup>''ν''</sup>''γ''<sup>''μ''</sup> = 2''η''<sup>''μν''</sup>1}} (i.e. fix a convention for the [[gamma matrices]]). Then the assignment {{nowrap|''e''<sup>''μ''</sup> → ''γ''<sup>''μ''</sup>}} extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'') → Mat(2<sup>''k''</sup>, '''C''')}} by sending the monomial {{nowrap|''e''<sup>''μ''<sub>1</sub></sup> … ''e''<sup>''μ''<sub>''k''</sub></sup>}} in the Clifford algebra to the product {{nowrap|''γ''<sup>''μ''<sub>1</sub></sup> … ''γ''<sup>''μ''<sub>''k''</sub></sup>}} of matrices and extending linearly. The space {{nowrap|1=Δ = '''C'''<sup>2<sup>''k''</sup></sup>}} on which the gamma matrices act is now a space of spinors. One needs to construct such matrices explicitly, however. In dimension 3, defining the gamma matrices to be the [[Pauli matrices|Pauli sigma matrices]] gives rise to the familiar two component spinors used in non relativistic [[quantum mechanics]]. Likewise using the {{nowrap|4 × 4}} Dirac gamma matrices gives rise to the 4 component Dirac spinors used in 3+1 dimensional relativistic [[quantum field theory]]. In general, in order to define gamma matrices of the required kind, one can use the [[Weyl–Brauer matrices]].\n\nIn this construction the representation of the Clifford algebra {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}}, the Lie algebra {{nowrap|'''so'''(''V'', ''g'')}}, and the Spin group {{nowrap|Spin(''V'', ''g'')}}, all depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis and the choice of the gamma matrices. This can cause confusion over conventions, but invariants like traces are independent of choices. In particular, all physically observable quantities must be independent of such choices. In this construction a spinor can be represented as a vector of 2<sup>''k''</sup> complex numbers and is denoted with spinor indices (usually ''α'', ''β'', ''γ''). In the physics literature, [[abstract indices|abstract spinor indices]] are often used to denote spinors even when an abstract spinor construction is used.\n\n=== Abstract spinors ===\nThere are at least two different, but essentially equivalent, ways to define spinors abstractly. One approach seeks to identify the minimal ideals for the left action of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} on itself. These are subspaces of the Clifford algebra of the form {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')''ω''}}, admitting the evident action of {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} by left-multiplication: {{nowrap|''c'' : ''xω'' → ''cxω''}}. There are two variations on this theme: one can either find a primitive element {{nowrap|''ω''}} that is a [[nilpotent]] element of the Clifford algebra, or one that is an [[idempotent]]. The construction via nilpotent elements is more fundamental in the sense that an idempotent may then be produced from it.<ref>This construction is due to Cartan. The treatment here is based on {{Harvtxt|Chevalley|1954}}.</ref> In this way, the spinor representations are identified with certain subspaces of the Clifford algebra itself. The second approach is to construct a vector space using a distinguished subspace of {{nowrap|''V''}}, and then specify the action of the Clifford algebra ''externally'' to that vector space.\n\nIn either approach, the fundamental notion is that of an [[isotropic subspace]] {{nowrap|''W''}}. Each construction depends on an initial freedom in choosing this subspace. In physical terms, this corresponds to the fact that there is no measurement protocol that can specify a basis of the spin space, even if a preferred basis of {{nowrap|''V''}} is given.\n\nAs above, we let {{nowrap|(''V'', ''g'')}} be an {{nowrap|''n''}}-dimensional complex vector space equipped with a nondegenerate bilinear form. If {{nowrap|''V''}} is a real vector space, then we replace {{nowrap|''V''}} by its [[complexification]] {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗<sub>'''R'''</sub> '''C'''}} and let {{nowrap|''g''}} denote the induced bilinear form on {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗<sub>'''R'''</sub> '''C'''}}. Let {{nowrap|''W''}} be a maximal isotropic subspace, i.e. a maximal subspace of {{nowrap|''V''}} such that {{nowrap|1=''g''{{!}}<sub>''W''</sub> = 0}}. If {{nowrap|1=''n'' =  2''k''}} is even, then let {{nowrap|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} be an isotropic subspace complementary to {{nowrap|''W''}}. If {{nowrap|1=''n'' =  2''k'' + 1}} is odd, let {{nowrap|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} be a maximal isotropic subspace with {{nowrap|1=''W'' ∩ ''W''<sup>∗</sup> = 0}}, and let {{nowrap|''U''}} be the orthogonal complement of {{nowrap|''W'' ⊕ ''W''<sup>∗</sup>}}. In both the even- and odd-dimensional cases {{nowrap|''W''}} and {{nowrap|''W''<sup>∗</sup>}} have dimension {{nowrap|''k''}}. In the odd-dimensional case, {{nowrap|''U''}} is one-dimensional, spanned by a unit vector {{nowrap|''u''}}.\n\n=== Minimal ideals ===\nSince ''W''{{′}} is isotropic, multiplication of elements of ''W''{{′}} inside {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')}} is [[alternative algebra|skew]]. Hence vectors in ''W''{{′}} anti-commute, and {{nowrap|1=Cℓ(''W''{{′}}, ''g''{{!}}<sub>''W''{{′}}</sub>) = Cℓ(''W''{{′}}, 0)}} is just the [[exterior algebra]] Λ<sup>∗</sup>''W''{{′}}. Consequently, the ''k''-fold product of ''W''{{′}} with itself, ''W''{{′}}<sup>''k''</sup>, is one-dimensional. Let ''ω'' be a generator of ''W''{{′}}<sup>''k''</sup>. In terms of a basis {{nowrap|''w''{{′}}<sub>1</sub>,..., ''w''{{′}}<sub>k</sub>}} of in ''W''{{′}}, one possibility is to set\n:<math>\\omega=w'_1w'_2\\cdots w'_k.</math>\n\nNote that {{nowrap|1=''ω''<sup>2</sup> = 0}} (i.e., ''ω'' is nilpotent of order 2), and moreover, {{nowrap|1=''w''{{′}}''ω'' = 0}} for all {{nowrap|''w''{{′}} ∈ ''W''{{′}}}}. The following facts can be proven easily:\n# If {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''k''}}, then the left ideal {{nowrap|1=Δ = Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')''ω''}} is a minimal left ideal. Furthermore, this splits into the two spin spaces {{nowrap|1=Δ<sub>+</sub> = Cℓ<sup>even</sup>''ω''}} and {{nowrap|1=Δ<sub>−</sub> = Cℓ<sup>odd</sup>''ω''}} on restriction to the action of the even Clifford algebra.\n# If {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''k'' + 1}}, then the action of the unit vector ''u'' on the left ideal {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')''ω''}} decomposes the space into a pair of isomorphic irreducible eigenspaces (both denoted by Δ), corresponding to the respective eigenvalues +1 and −1.\n\nIn detail, suppose for instance that ''n'' is even. Suppose that ''I'' is a non-zero left ideal contained in {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')''ω''}}. We shall show that ''I'' must be equal to {{nowrap|Cℓ(''V'', ''g'')''ω''}} by proving that it contains a nonzero scalar multiple of ''ω''.\n\nFix a basis ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''W'' and a complementary basis ''w''<sub>''i''</sub>′ of ''W''{{′}} so that\n:''w''<sub>''i''</sub>''w''<sub>''j''</sub>′ +''w''<sub>''j''</sub>′ ''w''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''δ''<sub>''ij''</sub>, and\n:(''w''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 0, (''w''<sub>''i''</sub>′)<sup>2</sup> = 0.\n\nNote that any element of ''I'' must have the form ''αω'', by virtue of our assumption that {{nowrap|''I'' ⊂ Cℓ(''V'', ''g'') ''ω''}}. Let {{nowrap|''αω'' ∈ ''I''}} be any such element. Using the chosen basis, we may write\n\n:<math>\\alpha = \\sum_{i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_p} a_{i_1\\dots i_p}w_{i_1}\\cdots w_{i_p} + \\sum_j B_jw'_j</math>\n\nwhere the ''a''<sub>''i''<sub>1</sub>…''i''<sub>''p''</sub></sub> are scalars, and the ''B''<sub>''j''</sub> are auxiliary elements of the Clifford algebra. Observe now that the product\n:<math>\\alpha\\omega = \\sum_{i_1<i_2<\\cdots<i_p} a_{i_1\\dots i_p}w_{i_1}\\cdots w_{i_p} \\omega.</math>\nPick any nonzero monomial ''a'' in the expansion of ''α'' with maximal homogeneous degree in the elements ''w''<sub>i</sub>:\n:<math>a = a_{i_1\\dots i_{max}}w_{i_1}\\dots w_{i_{max}}</math> (no summation implied),\nthen\n:<math>w'_{i_{max}}\\cdots w'_{i_1}\\alpha\\omega = a_{i_1\\dots i_{max}}\\omega</math>\nis a nonzero scalar multiple of ''ω'', as required.\n\nNote that for ''n'' even, this computation also shows that\n:<math>\\Delta = \\mathrm{C}\\ell(W)\\omega = (\\Lambda^* W)\\omega</math>.\nas a vector space. In the last equality we again used that ''W'' is isotropic. In physics terms, this shows that Δ is built up like a [[Fock space]] by [[creation and annihilation|creating]] spinors using anti-commuting creation operators in ''W'' acting on a vacuum ''ω''.\n\n=== Exterior algebra construction ===\nThe computations with the minimal ideal construction suggest that a spinor representation can\nalso be defined directly using the [[exterior algebra]] {{nowrap|1=Λ<sup>∗</sup> ''W'' = ⊕<sub>''j''</sub> Λ<sup>''j''</sup> ''W''}} of the isotropic subspace ''W''.\nLet {{nowrap|1=Δ = Λ<sup>∗</sup> ''W''}} denote the exterior algebra of ''W'' considered as vector space only. This will be the spin representation, and its elements will be referred to as spinors.<ref>One source for this subsection is {{Harvtxt|Fulton|Harris|1991}}.</ref><ref>Jurgen Jost, \"Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis\" (2002) Springer-Verlag Univeritext ISBN 3-540-4267-2. ''See chapter 1.''</ref>\n\nThe action of the Clifford algebra on Δ is defined first by giving the action of an element of ''V'' on Δ, and then showing that this action respects the Clifford relation and so extends to a [[homomorphism]] of the full Clifford algebra into the [[endomorphism ring]] End(Δ) by the [[Clifford algebra#Universal property and construction|universal property of Clifford algebras]]. The details differ slightly according to whether the dimension of ''V'' is even or odd.\n\nWhen dim(''V'') is even, {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W'' ⊕ ''W''′}} where ''W''′ is the chosen isotropic complement. Hence any {{nowrap|''v'' ∈ ''V''}} decomposes uniquely as {{nowrap|1=''v'' = ''w'' + ''w''′}} with {{nowrap|''w'' ∈ ''W''}} and {{nowrap|''w''′ ∈ ''W''′}}. The action of ''v'' on a spinor is given by\n:<math> c(v) w_1 \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge w_n = (\\epsilon(w) + i(w'))\\left(w_1 \\wedge\\cdots\\wedge w_n\\right)</math>\nwhere ''i''(''w''′) is [[interior product]] with ''w''′ using the non degenerate quadratic form to identify ''V'' with ''V''<sup>∗</sup>, and ε(w) denotes the [[exterior product]]. It may be verified that\n:''c''(''u'')''c''(''v'') + ''c''(''v'')''c''(''u'') = 2 ''g''(''u'',''v''),\nand so ''c'' respects the Clifford relations and extends to a homomorphism from the Clifford algebra to End(Δ).\n\nThe spin representation Δ further decomposes into a pair of irreducible complex representations of the Spin group<ref>Via the even-graded Clifford algebra.</ref> (the half-spin representations, or Weyl spinors) via\n:<math>\\Delta_+ = \\Lambda^{even} W,\\, \\Delta_- = \\Lambda^{odd} W</math>.\n\nWhen dim(''V'') is odd, {{nowrap|1=''V'' = ''W'' ⊕ ''U'' ⊕ ''W''′}}, where ''U'' is spanned by a unit vector ''u'' orthogonal to ''W''. The Clifford action ''c'' is defined as before on {{nowrap|''W'' ⊕ ''W''′}}, while the Clifford action of (multiples of) ''u'' is defined by\n:<math> c(u) \\alpha = \\left\\{\\begin{matrix}\n\\alpha&\\hbox{if } \\alpha\\in \\Lambda^{even} W\\\\\n-\\alpha&\\hbox{if } \\alpha\\in \\Lambda^{odd} W\n\\end{matrix}\\right.</math>\nAs before, one verifies that ''c'' respects the Clifford relations, and so induces a homomorphism.\n\n=== Hermitian vector spaces and spinors ===\nIf the vector space ''V'' has extra structure that provides a decomposition of its complexification into two maximal isotropic subspaces, then the definition of spinors (by either method) becomes natural.\n\nThe main example is the case that the real vector space ''V'' is a [[hermitian form|hermitian vector space]] {{nowrap|(''V'', ''h'')}}, i.e., ''V'' is equipped with a [[Linear complex structure|complex structure]] ''J'' that is an [[orthogonal transformation]] with respect to the inner product ''g'' on ''V''. Then {{nowrap|''V'' ⊗<sub>'''R'''</sub> '''C'''}} splits in the ±''i'' eigenspaces of ''J''. These eigenspaces are isotropic for the complexification of ''g'' and can be identified with the complex vector space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''J'')}} and its complex conjugate {{nowrap|(''V'', −''J'')}}. Therefore, for a hermitian vector space {{nowrap|(''V'', ''h'')}} the vector space Λ{{su|p=⋅|b='''C'''}}{{overline|''V''}} (as well as its complex conjugate Λ{{su|p=⋅|b='''C'''}}''V'') is a spinor space for the underlying real euclidean vector space.\n\nWith the Clifford action as above but with contraction using the hermitian form, this construction gives a spinor space at every point of an [[almost Hermitian manifold]] and is the reason why every [[almost complex manifold]] (in particular every [[symplectic manifold]]) has a [[Spin-c structure|Spin<sup>c</sup> structure]]. Likewise, every complex vector bundle on a manifold carries a Spin<sup>c</sup> structure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lawson|Michelsohn|1989|loc=Appendix D}}.</ref>\n\n== Clebsch–Gordan decomposition ==\nA number of [[Clebsch–Gordan coefficients|Clebsch–Gordan decompositions]] are possible on the [[tensor product]] of one spin representation with another.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brauer|Weyl|1935}}.</ref> These decompositions express the tensor product in terms of the alternating representations of the orthogonal group.\n\nFor the real or complex case, the alternating representations are\n* {{nowrap|1=Γ<sub>''r''</sub> = Λ<sup>''r''</sup>''V''}}, the representation of the orthogonal group on skew tensors of rank ''r''.\n\nIn addition, for the real orthogonal groups, there are three [[character theory|characters]] (one-dimensional representations)\n* ''σ''<sub>+</sub> : O(''p'', ''q'') → {−1, +1} given by {{nowrap|1=''σ''<sub>+</sub>(R) = −1}}, if ''R'' reverses the spatial orientation of ''V'', +1, if ''R'' preserves the spatial orientation of ''V''. (''The spatial character''.)\n* ''σ''<sub>−</sub> : O(''p'', ''q'') → {−1, +1} given by {{nowrap|1=''σ''<sub>−</sub>(R) = −1}}, if ''R'' reverses the temporal orientation of ''V'', +1, if ''R'' preserves the temporal orientation of ''V''. (''The temporal character''.)\n* ''σ'' = ''σ''<sub>+</sub>''σ''<sub>−</sub> . (''The orientation character''.)\n\nThe Clebsch–Gordan decomposition allows one to define, among other things:\n* An action of spinors on vectors.\n* A [[Hermitian metric]] on the complex representations of the real spin groups.\n* A [[Dirac operator]] on each spin representation.\n\n=== Even dimensions ===\nIf {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''k''}} is even, then the tensor product of Δ with the [[contragredient representation]] decomposes as\n: <math>\\Delta\\otimes\\Delta^* \\cong \\bigoplus_{p=0}^n \\Gamma_p \\cong \\bigoplus_{p=0}^{k-1} \\left(\\Gamma_p\\oplus\\sigma\\Gamma_p\\right)\\, \\oplus \\Gamma_k</math>\nwhich can be seen explicitly by considering (in the Explicit construction) the action of the Clifford algebra on decomposable elements {{nowrap|''αω'' ⊗ ''βω''′}}. The rightmost formulation follows from the transformation properties of the [[Hodge star operator]]. Note that on restriction to the even Clifford algebra, the paired summands {{nowrap|Γ<sub>''p''</sub> ⊕ ''σ''Γ<sub>''p''</sub>}} are isomorphic, but under the full Clifford algebra they are not.\n\nThere is a natural identification of Δ with its contragredient representation via the conjugation in the Clifford algebra:\n:<math>(\\alpha\\omega)^*=\\omega(\\alpha^*).</math>\nSo {{nowrap|Δ ⊗ Δ}} also decomposes in the above manner. Furthermore, under the even Clifford algebra, the half-spin representations decompose\n: <math>\\begin{matrix}\n\\Delta_+\\otimes\\Delta^*_+ \\cong \\Delta_-\\otimes\\Delta^*_- &\\cong& \\bigoplus_{p=0}^k \\Gamma_{2p}\\\\\n\\Delta_+\\otimes\\Delta^*_- \\cong \\Delta_-\\otimes\\Delta^*_+ &\\cong& \\bigoplus_{p=0}^{k-1} \\Gamma_{2p+1}\n\\end{matrix}\n</math>\n\nFor the complex representations of the real Clifford algebras, the associated [[reality structure]] on the complex Clifford algebra descends to the space of spinors (via the explicit construction in terms of minimal ideals, for instance). In this way, we obtain the complex conjugate {{overline|Δ}} of the representation Δ, and the following isomorphism is seen to hold:\n:<math>\\bar{\\Delta} \\cong \\sigma_-\\Delta^* </math>\n\nIn particular, note that the representation Δ of the orthochronous spin group is a [[unitary representation]]. In general, there are Clebsch–Gordan decompositions\n:<math>\\Delta\\otimes\\bar{\\Delta} \\cong \\bigoplus_{p=0}^k\\left(\\sigma_-\\Gamma_p\\oplus \\sigma_+\\Gamma_p\\right).</math>\n\nIn metric signature {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}}, the following isomorphisms hold for the conjugate half-spin representations\n* If ''q'' is even, then <math>\\bar{\\Delta}_+ \\cong \\sigma_-\\otimes \\Delta_+^*</math> and <math>\\bar{\\Delta}_- \\cong \\sigma_-\\otimes \\Delta_-^*.</math>\n* If ''q'' is odd, then <math>\\bar{\\Delta}_+ \\cong \\sigma_-\\otimes \\Delta_-^*</math> and <math>\\bar{\\Delta}_- \\cong \\sigma_-\\otimes \\Delta_+^*.</math>\nUsing these isomorphisms, one can deduce analogous decompositions for the tensor products of the half-spin representations {{nowrap|Δ<sub>±</sub> ⊗ {{overline|Δ}}<sub>±</sub>}}.\n\n=== Odd dimensions ===\nIf {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2''k'' + 1}} is odd, then\n: <math>\\Delta\\otimes\\Delta^* \\cong \\bigoplus_{p=0}^k \\Gamma_{2p}.</math>\nIn the real case, once again the isomorphism holds\n: <math>\\bar{\\Delta} \\cong \\sigma_-\\Delta^*.</math>\nHence there is a Clebsch–Gordan decomposition (again using the Hodge star to dualize) given by\n: <math>\\Delta\\otimes\\bar{\\Delta} \\cong \\sigma_-\\Gamma_0\\oplus\\sigma_+\\Gamma_1\\oplus\\dots\\oplus\\sigma_\\pm\\Gamma_k</math>\n\n=== Consequences ===\nThere are many far-reaching consequences of the Clebsch–Gordan decompositions of the spinor spaces. The most fundamental of these pertain to Dirac's theory of the electron, among whose basic requirements are\n* A manner of regarding the product of two spinors ''{{overline|ϕ}}ψ'' as a scalar. In physical terms, a spinor should determine a [[probability amplitude]] for the [[quantum state]].\n* A manner of regarding the product ''ψ{{overline|ϕ}}'' as a vector. This is an essential feature of Dirac's theory, which ties the spinor formalism to the geometry of physical space.\n* A manner of regarding a spinor as acting upon a vector, by an expression such as ''ψv{{overline|ψ}}''. In physical terms, this represents an [[electric current]] of Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]], or more generally a [[probability current]].\n\n== Summary in low dimensions ==\n* In 1 dimension (a trivial example), the single spinor representation is formally Majorana, a [[real representation|real]] 1-dimensional representation that does not transform.\n* In 2 Euclidean dimensions, the left-handed and the right-handed Weyl spinor are 1-component [[complex representation]]s, i.e. complex numbers that get multiplied by ''e''<sup>±''iφ''/2</sup> under a rotation by angle ''φ''.\n* In 3 Euclidean dimensions, the single spinor representation is 2-dimensional and [[quaternionic representation|quaternionic]]. The existence of spinors in 3 dimensions follows from the isomorphism of the [[group (mathematics)|group]]s {{nowrap|SU(2) ≅ Spin(3)}} that allows us to define the action of Spin(3) on a complex 2-component column (a spinor); the generators of SU(2) can be written as [[Pauli matrices]].\n* In 4 Euclidean dimensions, the corresponding isomorphism is {{nowrap|Spin(4) ≅ SU(2) × SU(2)}}. There are two inequivalent [[quaternionic representation|quaternionic]] 2-component Weyl spinors and each of them transforms under one of the SU(2) factors only.\n* In 5 Euclidean dimensions, the relevant isomorphism is {{nowrap|Spin(5) ≅ USp(4) ≅ Sp(2)}} that implies that the single spinor representation is 4-dimensional and quaternionic.\n* In 6 Euclidean dimensions, the isomorphism {{nowrap|Spin(6) ≅ SU(4)}} guarantees that there are two 4-dimensional complex Weyl representations that are complex conjugates of one another.\n* In 7 Euclidean dimensions, the single spinor representation is 8-dimensional and real; no isomorphisms to a Lie algebra from another series (A or C) exist from this dimension on.\n* In 8 Euclidean dimensions, there are two Weyl–Majorana real 8-dimensional representations that are related to the 8-dimensional real vector representation by a special property of [[Spin(8)]] called [[triality]].\n* In {{nowrap|''d'' + 8}} dimensions, the number of distinct irreducible spinor representations and their reality (whether they are real, pseudoreal, or complex) mimics the structure in ''d'' dimensions, but their dimensions are 16 times larger; this allows one to understand all remaining cases. See [[Bott periodicity]].\n* In spacetimes with ''p'' spatial and ''q'' time-like directions, the dimensions viewed as dimensions over the complex numbers coincide with the case of the {{nowrap|(''p'' + ''q'')}}-dimensional Euclidean space, but the reality projections mimic the structure in {{nowrap|{{abs|''p'' − ''q''}}}} Euclidean dimensions. For example, in {{nowrap|3 + 1}} dimensions there are two non-equivalent Weyl complex (like in 2 dimensions) 2-component (like in 4 dimensions) spinors, which follows from the isomorphism {{nowrap|SL(2, '''C''') ≅ Spin(3,1)}}.\n\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n![[Metric signature]]!!left-handed Weyl!!right-handed Weyl!!conjugacy!!Dirac!!left-handed Majorana–Weyl!!right-handed Majorana–Weyl!!Majorana\n|-\n| ||complex||complex|| ||complex||real||real||real\n|-\n|(2,0)||1||1||mutual||2||–||–||2\n|-\n|(1,1)||1||1||self||2||1||1||2\n|-\n|(3,0)||–||–||–||2||–||–||–\n|-\n|(2,1)||–||–||–||2||–||–||2\n|-\n|(4,0)||2||2||self||4||–||–||–\n|-\n|(3,1)||2||2||mutual||4||–||–||4\n|-\n|(5,0)||–||–||–||4||–||–||–\n|-\n|(4,1)||–||–||–||4||–||–||–\n|-\n|(6,0)||4||4||mutual||8||–||–||8\n|-\n|(5,1)||4||4||self||8||–||–||–\n|-\n|(7,0)||–||–||–||8||–||–||8\n|-\n|(6,1)||–||–||–||8||–||–||–\n|-\n|(8,0)||8||8||self||16||8||8||16\n|-\n|(7,1)||8||8||mutual||16||–||–||16\n|-\n|(9,0)||–||–||–||16||–||–||16\n|-\n|(8,1)||–||–||–||16||–||–||16\n|}</center>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Anyon]]\n* [[Dirac equation in the algebra of physical space]]\n* [[Eigenspinor]]\n* [[Einstein–Cartan theory]]\n* [[Projective representation]]\n* [[Pure spinor]]\n* [[Spin-½]]\n* [[Spinor bundle]]\n* [[Supercharge]]\n* [[Twistor theory]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|35em|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{citation|last1=Brauer|first1=Richard|author1-link=Richard Brauer|last2=Weyl|first2= Hermann|author2-link=Hermann Weyl|title=Spinors in n dimensions|journal= American Journal of Mathematics|volume=57|issue= 2|year=1935|pages= 425–449|doi=10.2307/2371218|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=2371218}}.\n* {{citation|last=Cartan|first=Élie|authorlink=Élie Cartan|url=http://archive.numdam.org/article/BSMF_1913__41__53_1.pdf|title=Les groupes projectifs qui ne laissent invariante aucune multiplicité plane|journal= Bul.

The link could be an [[electrical cable]] or a flexible conduit.\n\nThis mechanism is intended as an alternative to the usual method of supplying [[electric power]] to a rotating device, the use of [[slip ring]]s. The slip rings are attached to one part of the machine, and a set of fine metal brushes are attached to the other part. The brushes are kept in sliding contact with the slip rings, providing an electrical path between the two parts while allowing the parts to rotate about each other.\n\nHowever, this presents problems with smaller devices. Whereas with large devices minor fluctuations in the power provided through the brush mechanism are inconsequential, in the case of tiny electronic components, the brushing introduces unacceptable levels of [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the stream of power supplied.

It was validated by accounting for the fine details of the [[Hydrogen spectral series|hydrogen spectrum]] in a completely rigorous way.\n\nThe equation also implied the existence of a new form of matter, ''[[antimatter]]'', previously unsuspected and unobserved and which was experimentally confirmed several years later. It also provided a ''theoretical'' justification for the introduction of several component wave functions in [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]]'s [[phenomenology (particle physics)|phenomenological]] theory of [[spin (physics)|spin]]. The wave functions in the Dirac theory are vectors of four [[complex number]]s (known as [[bispinor]]s), two of which resemble the Pauli wavefunction in the non-relativistic limit, in contrast to the [[Schrödinger equation]] which described wave functions of only one complex value. Moreover, in the limit of zero mass, the Dirac equation reduces to the [[Weyl equation]].\n\nAlthough Dirac did not at first fully appreciate the importance of his results, the entailed explanation of spin as a consequence of the union of quantum mechanics and relativity—and the eventual discovery of the [[positron]]—represents one of the great triumphs of [[theoretical physics]].

Also, {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]], and {{math|''ħ''}} is the [[Planck constant]] divided by {{math|2π}}. These fundamental [[physical constant]]s reflect special relativity and quantum mechanics, respectively.\n\nDirac's purpose in casting this equation was to explain the behavior of the relativistically moving electron, and so to allow the atom to be treated in a manner consistent with relativity. His rather modest hope was that the corrections introduced this way might have a bearing on the problem of [[atomic spectra]]. Up until that time, attempts to make the old quantum theory of the atom compatible with the theory of relativity, attempts based on discretizing the [[angular momentum]] stored in the electron's possibly non-circular orbit of the [[atomic nucleus]], had failed – and the new quantum mechanics of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]], [[Pascual Jordan|Jordan]], [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], and Dirac himself had not developed sufficiently to treat this problem. Although Dirac's original intentions were satisfied, his equation had far deeper implications for the structure of matter and introduced new mathematical classes of objects that are now essential elements of fundamental physics.\n\nThe new elements in this equation are the 4 × 4 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] {{math|''α''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''β''}}, and the four-component [[wave function]] {{math|''ψ''}}. There are four components in {{math|''ψ''}} because the evaluation of it at any given point in configuration space is a [[bispinor]]. It is interpreted as a superposition of a [[Spin-½|spin-up]] electron, a spin-down electron, a spin-up positron, and a spin-down positron (see [[#Hole theory|below]] for further discussion).\n\nThe 4 × 4 matrices {{math|''α''<sub>''k''</sub>}} and {{math|''β''}} are all [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian]] and have squares equal to the [[identity matrix]]:\n\n:<math>\\alpha_i^2=\\beta^2=I_4</math>\n\nand they all mutually [[anticommute]] (if {{math|''i''}} and {{math|''j''}} are distinct):\n\n:<math>\\alpha_i\\alpha_j + \\alpha_j\\alpha_i = 0</math>\n:<math>\\alpha_i\\beta + \\beta\\alpha_i = 0</math>\n\nThe single symbolic equation thus unravels into four coupled linear first-order [[partial differential equation]]s for the four quantities that make up the wave function. These matrices and the form of the wave function have a deep mathematical significance. The algebraic structure represented by the [[gamma matrices]] had been created some 50 years earlier by the English mathematician [[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]].  In turn, Clifford's ideas had emerged from the mid-19th-century work of the German mathematician [[Hermann Grassmann]] in his ''Lineale Ausdehnungslehre'' (''Theory of Linear Extensions''). The latter had been regarded as well-nigh incomprehensible by most of his contemporaries. The appearance of something so seemingly abstract, at such a late date, and in such a direct physical manner, is one of the most remarkable chapters in the history of physics.{{Citation needed|reason=Historical perspective and author editorial|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Making the Schrödinger equation relativistic ===\nThe Dirac equation is superficially similar to the [[Schrödinger equation]] for a massive [[free particle]]:\n\n:<math>-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2\\phi = i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\phi.</math>\n\nThe left side represents the square of the momentum operator divided by twice the mass, which is the non-relativistic kinetic energy.  Because relativity treats space and time as a whole, a relativistic generalization of this equation requires that space and time derivatives must enter symmetrically as they do in the [[Maxwell equation]]s that govern the behavior of light — the equations must be differentially of the ''same order'' in space and time. In relativity, the momentum and the energies are the space and time parts of a spacetime  vector, the [[four-momentum]], and they are related by the relativistically invariant relation\n\n:<math>E^2 = m^2c^4 + p^2c^2</math>\n\nwhich says that the [[Four-momentum#Minkowski norm|length of this four-vector]] is proportional to the rest mass {{math|''m''}}. Substituting the operator equivalents of the energy and momentum from the Schrödinger theory, we get the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] describing the propagation of waves, constructed from relativistically invariant objects,\n\n:<math>\\left(-\\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + \\nabla^2\\right)\\phi = \\frac{m^2c^2}{\\hbar^2}\\phi</math>\n\nwith the wave function {{math|''ϕ''}} being a relativistic scalar: a complex number which has the same numerical value in all frames of reference. Space and time derivatives both enter to second order. This has a telling consequence for the interpretation of the equation. Because the equation is second order in the time derivative, one must specify initial values both of the wave function itself and of its first time-derivative in order to solve definite problems. Since both may be specified more or less arbitrarily, the wave function cannot maintain its former role of determining the [[probability density function|probability density]] of finding the electron in a given state of motion. In the Schrödinger theory, the probability density is given by the positive definite expression\n\n:<math>\\rho=\\phi^*\\phi\\,</math>\n\nand this density is convected according to the probability current vector\n\n:<math>J = -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}(\\phi^*\\nabla\\phi - \\phi\\nabla\\phi^*)</math>\n\nwith the conservation of probability current and density following from the continuity equation:\n\n:<math>\\nabla\\cdot J + \\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial t} = 0.</math>\n\nThe fact that the density is positive definite and convected according to this continuity equation implies that we may integrate the density over a certain domain and set the total to 1, and this condition will be maintained by the [[conservation law]]. A proper relativistic theory with a probability density current must also share this feature. Now, if we wish to maintain the notion of a convected density, then we must generalize the Schrödinger expression of the density and current so that space and time derivatives again enter symmetrically in relation to the scalar wave function. We are allowed to keep the Schrödinger expression for the current, but must replace the probability density by the symmetrically formed expression\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{i\\hbar}{2mc^2}(\\psi^*\\partial_t\\psi - \\psi\\partial_t\\psi^*).</math>\n\nwhich now becomes the 4th component of a spacetime  vector, and the entire [[Probability four-current|probability 4-current density]] has the relativistically covariant expression\n\n:<math>J^\\mu = \\frac{i\\hbar}{2m}(\\psi^*\\partial^\\mu\\psi - \\psi\\partial^\\mu\\psi^*)</math>\n\nThe continuity equation is as before. Everything is compatible with relativity now, but we see immediately that the expression for the density is no longer [[positive definite function|positive definite]] – the initial values of both {{math|''ψ''}} and {{math|∂<sub>''t''</sub>''ψ''}} may be freely chosen, and the density may thus become negative, something that is impossible for a legitimate probability density. Thus, we cannot get a simple generalization of the Schrödinger equation under the naive assumption that the wave function is a relativistic scalar, and the equation it satisfies, second order in time.\n\nAlthough it is not a successful relativistic generalization of the Schrödinger equation, this equation is resurrected in the context of [[quantum field theory]], where it is known as the [[Klein–Gordon equation]], and describes a spinless particle field (e.g. [[pi meson]] or [[Higgs boson]]). Historically, Schrödinger himself arrived at this equation before the one that bears his name but soon discarded it. In the context of quantum field theory, the indefinite density is understood to correspond to the ''charge'' density, which can be positive or negative, and not the probability density.\n\n=== Dirac's coup ===\nDirac thus thought to try an equation that was ''first order'' in both space and time. One could, for example, formally (i.e. by [[abuse of notation]]) take the [[Energy–momentum relation|relativistic expression for the energy]]\n:<math>E = c\\sqrt{p^2 + m^2c^2}\\,,</math>\nreplace {{math|''p''}} by its operator equivalent, expand the square root in an [[infinite series]] of derivative operators, set up an eigenvalue problem, then solve the equation formally by iterations. Most physicists had little faith in such a process, even if it were technically possible.\n\nAs the story goes, Dirac was staring into the fireplace at Cambridge, pondering this problem, when he hit upon the idea of taking the square root of the wave operator thus:\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} = \\left(A \\partial_x + B \\partial_y + C \\partial_z + \\frac{i}{c}D \\partial_t\\right)\\left(A \\partial_x + B \\partial_y + C \\partial_z + \\frac{i}{c}D \\partial_t\\right).</math>\n\nOn multiplying out the right side we see that, in order to get all the cross-terms such as {{math|∂<sub>''x''</sub>∂<sub>''y''</sub>}} to vanish, we must assume\n\n:<math>AB + BA = 0, \\;\\ldots</math>\n\nwith\n\n:<math>A^2 = B^2 = \\ldots = 1.\\,</math>\n\nDirac, who had just then been intensely involved with working out the foundations of Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]], immediately understood that these conditions could be met if {{math|''A''}}, {{math|''B''}}, {{math|''C''}} and {{math|''D''}} are ''matrices'', with the implication that the wave function has ''multiple components''. This immediately explained the appearance of two-component wave functions in Pauli's phenomenological theory of [[Spin (physics)|spin]], something that up until then had been regarded as mysterious, even to Pauli himself. However, one needs at least 4 × 4 matrices to set up a system with the properties required — so the wave function had ''four'' components, not two, as in the Pauli theory, or one, as in the bare Schrödinger theory. The four-component wave function represents a new class of mathematical object in physical theories that makes its first appearance here.\n\nGiven the factorization in terms of these matrices, one can now write down immediately an equation\n\n:<math>\\left(A\\partial_x + B\\partial_y + C\\partial_z + \\frac{i}{c}D\\partial_t\\right)\\psi = \\kappa\\psi</math>\n\nwith <math>\\kappa</math> to be determined. Applying again the matrix operator on both sides yields\n\n:<math>\\left(\\nabla^2 - \\frac{1}{c^2}\\partial_t^2\\right)\\psi = \\kappa^2\\psi.</math>\n\nOn taking <math>\\kappa = \\tfrac{mc}{\\hbar}</math> we find that all the components of the wave function ''individually'' satisfy the relativistic energy–momentum relation. Thus the sought-for equation that is first-order in both space and time is\n\n:<math>\\left(A\\partial_x + B\\partial_y + C\\partial_z + \\frac{i}{c}D\\partial_t - \\frac{mc}{\\hbar}\\right)\\psi = 0.</math>\n\nSetting\n\n:<math>A = i \\beta \\alpha_1 \\, , \\, B = i \\beta \\alpha_2 \\, , \\, C = i \\beta \\alpha_3 \\, , \\, D = \\beta \\, , </math>\n\nand because  <math>D^2=\\beta^2=I_4 \\, ,</math>\n\nwe get the Dirac equation as written above.\n\n=== Covariant form and relativistic invariance ===\n\nTo demonstrate the [[Lorentz covariance|relativistic invariance]] of the equation, it is advantageous to cast it into a form in which the space and time derivatives appear on an equal footing. New matrices are introduced as follows:\n\n:<math>D = \\gamma^0 \\, ,</math>\n:<math>A = i \\gamma^1 \\, , \\, B = i \\gamma^2 \\, , \\, C = i \\gamma^3 \\, ,</math>\n\nand the equation takes the form (remembering the definition of the covariant components of the [[4-gradient]] and especially that {{math|∂<sub>''0''</sub>}} = {{math|{{sfrac|''1''|''c''}}∂<sub>''t''</sub>}} )\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Dirac equation'''\n|equation = <math>i \\hbar \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu \\psi - m c \\psi = 0 </math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour =#50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nwhere there is an [[Einstein notation|implied summation]] over the values of the twice-repeated index {{math|''μ'' {{=}} 0, 1, 2, 3}}, and {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub> }} is the 4-gradient. In practice one often writes the [[gamma matrices]] in terms of 2 × 2 sub-matrices taken from the [[Pauli matrices]] and the 2 × 2 [[identity matrix]]. Explicitly the [[gamma matrices#Dirac basis|standard representation]] is\n\n:<math>\n\\gamma^0 = \\begin{pmatrix} I_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -I_2 \\end{pmatrix},\n\\gamma^1 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} 0   & \\sigma_x \\\\ -\\sigma_x & 0    \\end{array}\\right),\n\\gamma^2 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} 0   & \\sigma_y \\\\ -\\sigma_y & 0    \\end{array}\\right),\n\\gamma^3 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccc} 0   & \\sigma_z \\\\ -\\sigma_z & 0    \\end{array}\\right).\n \\,</math>\n\nThe complete system is summarized using the [[Minkowski metric]] on spacetime in the form\n\n:<math>\\{\\gamma^\\mu,\\gamma^\\nu\\} = 2 \\eta^{\\mu\\nu}I_4 \\,</math>\n\nwhere the bracket expression\n\n:<math>\\{a, b\\} = ab + ba</math>\n\ndenotes the [[anticommutator]]. These are the defining relations of a [[Clifford algebra]] over a pseudo-orthogonal 4-dimensional space with [[metric signature]] {{math|(+ − − −)}}. The specific Clifford algebra employed in the Dirac equation is known today as the [[Dirac algebra]]. Although not recognized as such by Dirac at the time the equation was formulated, in hindsight the introduction of this ''[[geometric algebra]]'' represents an enormous stride forward in the development of quantum theory.\n\nThe Dirac equation may now be interpreted as an [[eigenvalue]] equation, where the rest mass is proportional to an eigenvalue of the [[4-momentum operator]], the [[proportionality constant]] being the speed of light:\n\n:<math>P_\\mathrm{op}\\psi = mc\\psi. \\,</math>\n\nUsing   <math>{\\partial\\!\\!\\!/} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu</math> (<math>{\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /}</math> is pronounced \"d-slash\"<ref>see for example Brian Pendleton: [http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/~bjp/qt/rqt.pdf Quantum Theory 2012/2013, section 4.3 The Dirac Equation]</ref>) , according to [[Feynman slash notation]], the Dirac equation becomes:\n:<math>i \\hbar {\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /} \\psi - m c \\psi = 0.</math>\nIn practice, physicists often use units of measure such that {{math|''ħ'' {{=}} ''c'' {{=}} 1}}, known as [[natural units]]. The equation then takes the simple form\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Dirac equation''' ''(natural units)''\n|equation = <math>(i{\\partial\\!\\!\\!\\big /} - m) \\psi = 0\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour =#50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nA fundamental theorem states that if two distinct sets of matrices are given that both satisfy the [[Clifford algebra|Clifford relations]], then they are connected to each other by a [[Matrix similarity|similarity transformation]]:\n\n:<math>\\gamma^{\\mu\\prime} = S^{-1} \\gamma^\\mu S.</math>\n\nIf in addition the matrices are all [[unitary transformation|unitary]], as are the Dirac set, then {{math|''S''}} itself is [[unitary matrix|unitary]];\n\n:<math>\\gamma^{\\mu\\prime} = U^\\dagger \\gamma^\\mu U.</math>\n\nThe transformation {{math|''U''}} is unique up to a multiplicative factor of absolute value 1. Let us now imagine a [[Lorentz transformation]] to have been performed on the space and time coordinates, and on the derivative operators, which form a covariant vector. For the operator {{math|''γ''<sup>''μ''</sup>∂<sub>''μ''</sub>}} to remain invariant, the gammas must transform among themselves as a contravariant vector with respect to their spacetime index. These new gammas will themselves satisfy the Clifford relations, because of the orthogonality of the Lorentz transformation. By the fundamental theorem, we may replace the new set by the old set subject to a unitary transformation. In the new frame, remembering that the rest mass is a relativistic scalar, the Dirac equation will then take the form\n\n:<math>( iU^\\dagger \\gamma^\\mu U\\partial_\\mu^\\prime - m)\\psi(x^\\prime,t^\\prime) = 0</math>\n:<math>U^\\dagger(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu^\\prime - m)U \\psi(x^\\prime,t^\\prime) = 0.</math>\n\nIf we now define the transformed spinor\n\n:<math>\\psi^\\prime = U\\psi</math>\n\nthen we have the transformed Dirac equation in a way that demonstrates [[Manifest covariance|manifest relativistic invariance]]:\n\n:<math>(i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu^\\prime - m)\\psi^\\prime(x^\\prime,t^\\prime) = 0.</math>\n\nThus, once we settle on any unitary representation of the gammas, it is final provided we transform the spinor according to the unitary transformation that corresponds to the given Lorentz transformation. The various representations of the Dirac matrices employed will bring into focus particular aspects of the physical content in the Dirac wave function (see below). The representation shown here is known as the ''standard'' representation – in it, the wave function's upper two components go over into Pauli's 2-spinor wave function in the limit of low energies and small velocities in comparison to light.\n\nThe considerations above reveal the origin of the gammas in ''geometry'', hearkening back to Grassmann's original motivation – they represent a fixed basis of unit vectors in spacetime. Similarly, products of the gammas such as {{math|''γ''<sub>''μ''</sub>''γ''<sub>''ν''</sub>}} represent ''[[oriented surface]] elements'', and so on. With this in mind, we can find the form of the unit volume element on spacetime in terms of the gammas as follows. By definition, it is\n\n:<math>V = \\frac{1}{4!}\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\alpha\\beta}\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma^\\nu\\gamma^\\alpha\\gamma^\\beta.</math>\n\nFor this to be an invariant, the [[Levi-Civita symbol|epsilon symbol]] must be a [[tensor]], and so must contain a factor of {{math|{{sqrt|''g''}}}}, where {{math|''g''}} is the [[determinant]] of the [[metric tensor]]. Since this is negative, that factor is ''imaginary''. Thus\n\n:<math>V = i \\gamma^0\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3.\\ </math>\n\nThis matrix is given the special symbol {{math|''γ''<sup>5</sup>}}, owing to its importance when one is considering improper transformations of spacetime, that is, those that change the orientation of the basis vectors. In the standard representation, it is\n\n:<math>\\gamma_5 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_{2} \\\\ I_{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThis matrix will also be found to anticommute with the other four Dirac matrices:\n\n:<math>\\gamma^5 \\gamma^\\mu + \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma^5 = 0</math>\n\nIt takes a leading role when questions of ''[[Parity (physics)|parity]]'' arise because the volume element as a directed magnitude changes sign under a spacetime  reflection. Taking the positive square root above thus amounts to choosing a handedness convention on spacetime .\n\n=== Conservation of probability current ===\nBy defining the [[Dirac adjoint|adjoint]] [[spinor]]\n:<math>\\bar{\\psi} = \\psi^\\dagger\\gamma^0</math>\nwhere {{math|''ψ''<sup>†</sup>}} is the [[conjugate transpose]] of {{math|''ψ''}}, and noticing that\n:<math>(\\gamma^\\mu)^\\dagger\\gamma^0 = \\gamma^0\\gamma^\\mu \\,</math>,\nwe obtain, by taking the Hermitian conjugate of the Dirac equation and multiplying from the right by {{math|''γ''<sup>0</sup>}}, the adjoint equation:\n:<math>\\bar{\\psi}(-i\\gamma^\\mu\\partial_\\mu - m) = 0 \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|∂<sub>''μ''</sub>}} is understood to act to the left. Multiplying the Dirac equation by {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}}} from the left, and the adjoint equation by {{math|''ψ''}} from the right, and subtracting, produces the law of conservation of the Dirac current:\n\n:<math>\\partial_\\mu \\left( \\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^\\mu\\psi \\right) = 0.</math>\n\nNow we see the great advantage of the first-order equation over the one Schrödinger had tried – this is the conserved current density required by relativistic invariance, only now its 4th component is ''positive definite'' and thus suitable for the role of a probability density:\n\n:<math>J^0 = \\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^0\\psi = \\psi^\\dagger\\psi.</math>\n\nBecause the probability density now appears as the fourth component of a relativistic vector and not a simple scalar as in the Schrödinger equation, it will be subject to the usual effects of the Lorentz transformations such as time dilation. Thus, for example, atomic processes that are observed as rates, will necessarily be adjusted in a way consistent with relativity, while those involving the measurement of energy and momentum, which themselves form a relativistic vector, will undergo parallel adjustment which preserves the relativistic covariance of the observed values.\n\n=== Solutions ===\n\nSee [[Dirac spinor]] for details of solutions to the Dirac equation. Note that since the Dirac operator acts on 4-tuples of [[#square-integrable function|square-integrable functions]], its solutions should be members of the same [[Hilbert space]].  The fact that the energies of the solutions do not have a lower bound is unexpected – see the [[#Hole theory|hole theory]] section below for more details.\n\n=== Comparison with the Pauli theory ===\n{{See also|Pauli equation}}\nThe necessity of introducing half-integer [[spin (physics)|spin]] goes back experimentally to the results of the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]]. A beam of atoms is run through a strong [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|inhomogeneous]] [[magnetic field]], which then splits into {{math|''N''}} parts depending on the [[spin (physics)|intrinsic angular momentum]] of the atoms. It was found that for [[silver]] atoms, the beam was split in two—the [[ground state]] therefore could not be [[integer]], because even if the intrinsic angular momentum of the atoms were as small as possible, 1, the beam would be split into three parts, corresponding to atoms with {{math|''L<sub>z</sub>'' {{=}} −1, 0, +1}}. The conclusion is that silver atoms have net intrinsic angular momentum of {{frac|1|2}}. [[Wolfgang Pauli|Pauli]] set up a theory which explained this splitting by introducing a two-component wave function and a corresponding correction term in the [[Hamilton's Principle|Hamiltonian]], representing a semi-classical coupling of this wave function to an applied magnetic field, as so in [[SI units]]: (Note that bold faced characters imply [[Euclidean vectors]] in 3 [[dimensions]], whereas the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski]] [[four-vector]] {{math|''A''<sub>''μ''</sub>}} can be defined as <math>A_\\mu=(\\phi/c,-\\mathbf A)</math>.)\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left( \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right)\\right)^2 + e\\phi.</math>\n\nHere {{math|'''A'''}} and <math>\\phi</math> represent the components of the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] in their standard SI units, and the three sigmas are the [[Pauli matrices]]. On squaring out the first term, a residual interaction with the magnetic field is found, along with the usual [[momentum#Particle in field|classical Hamiltonian of a charged particle]] interacting with an applied field in [[SI units]]:\n\n:<math>H = \\frac{1}{2m}\\left(\\mathbf{p}  - e \\mathbf{A}\\right)^2 + e\\phi - \\frac{e\\hbar}{2m}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\mathbf{B}.</math>\n\nThis Hamiltonian is now a 2 × 2 matrix, so the Schrödinger equation based on it must use a two-component wave function. On introducing the external electromagnetic 4-vector potential into the Dirac equation in a similar way, known as [[minimal coupling]], it takes the form:\n\n:<math>(\\gamma^\\mu(i\\hbar\\partial_\\mu - eA_\\mu) - mc) \\psi = 0 \\,.</math>\n\nA second application of the Dirac operator will now reproduce the Pauli term exactly as before, because the spatial Dirac matrices multiplied by {{math|''i''}}, have the same squaring and commutation properties as the Pauli matrices. What is more, the value of the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the electron, standing in front of Pauli's new term, is explained from first principles. This was a major achievement of the Dirac equation and gave physicists great faith in its overall correctness. There is more however. The Pauli theory may be seen as the low energy limit of the Dirac theory in the following manner. First the equation is written in the form of coupled equations for 2-spinors with the SI units restored:\n\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} (mc^2 - E + e \\phi) & c\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right) \\\\ -c\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right) & \\left(mc^2 + E - e \\phi\\right) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_+ \\\\ \\psi_- \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}. </math>\n\nso\n\n:<math> (E - e\\phi) \\psi_+ - c\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right) \\psi_- = mc^2 \\psi_+</math>\n:<math>-(E - e\\phi) \\psi_- + c\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right) \\psi_+ = mc^2 \\psi_-</math>\n\nAssuming the field is weak and the motion of the electron non-relativistic, we have the total energy of the electron approximately equal to its [[rest energy]], and the momentum going over to the classical value,\n\n:<math>E - e\\phi \\approx mc^2</math>\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} \\approx m \\mathbf{v}</math>\n\nand so the second equation may be written\n\n:<math>\\psi_- \\approx  \\frac{1}{2mc}  \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right) \\psi_+</math>\n\nwhich is of order {{math|{{sfrac|''v''|''c''}}}} – thus at typical energies and velocities, the bottom components of the Dirac spinor in the standard representation are much suppressed in comparison to the top components. Substituting this expression into the first equation gives after some rearrangement\n\n:<math> (E - mc^2) \\psi_+ = \\frac{1}{2m} \\left[\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{p} - e \\mathbf{A}\\right)\\right]^2 \\psi_+ + e\\phi \\psi_+</math>\n\nThe operator on the left represents the particle energy reduced by its rest energy, which is just the classical energy, so we recover Pauli's theory if we identify his 2-spinor with the top components of the Dirac spinor in the non-relativistic approximation. A further approximation gives the Schrödinger equation as the limit of the Pauli theory. Thus, the Schrödinger equation may be seen as the far non-relativistic approximation of the Dirac equation when one may neglect spin and work only at low energies and velocities. This also was a great triumph for the new equation, as it traced the mysterious {{math|''i''}} that appears in it, and the necessity of a complex wave function, back to the geometry of spacetime  through the Dirac algebra. It also highlights why the Schrödinger equation, although superficially in the form of a [[diffusion equation]], actually represents the propagation of waves.\n\nIt should be strongly emphasized that this separation of the Dirac spinor into large and small components depends explicitly on a low-energy approximation. The entire Dirac spinor represents an ''irreducible'' whole, and the components we have just neglected to arrive at the Pauli theory will bring in new phenomena in the relativistic regime – [[antimatter]] and the idea of [[Matter creation|creation]] and [[annihilation]] of particles.\n\n=== Comparison with the Weyl theory ===\n\nIn the limit {{math|''m'' → 0}}, the Dirac equation reduces to the [[Weyl equation]], which describes relativistic massless spin-{{frac|2}} particles.<ref name=\"Ohlsson2011\">{{cite book|author=Tommy Ohlsson|title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&pg=PA86|date=22 September 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50432-4|page=86}}</ref>\n\n=== Dirac Lagrangian ===\n\nBoth the Dirac equation and the Adjoint Dirac equation can be obtained from (varying) the action with a specific Lagrangian density that is given by:\n\n<math>\\mathcal{L}=i\\hbar c\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi-mc^{2}\\overline{\\psi}\\psi</math>\n\nIf one varies this with respect to {{math|''ψ''}} one gets the Adjoint Dirac equation. Meanwhile, if one varies this with respect to {{math|{{overline|''ψ''}}}} one gets the Dirac equation.\n\n== Physical interpretation ==\n=== Identification of observables ===\nThe critical physical question in a quantum theory is—what are the physically [[observable]] quantities defined by the theory? According to the postulates of quantum mechanics, such quantities are defined by [[Hermitian operator]]s that act on the [[Hilbert space]] of possible states of a system. The eigenvalues of these operators are then the possible results of [[Measurement problem|measuring]] the corresponding physical quantity. In the Schrödinger theory, the simplest such object is the overall Hamiltonian, which represents the total energy of the system. If we wish to maintain this interpretation on passing to the Dirac theory, we must take the Hamiltonian to be\n\n:<math>H = \\gamma^0 \\left[mc^2 + c \\gamma^k \\left(p_k-qA_k\\right) \\right] + qA^0.</math>\n\nwhere, as always, there is an [[Einstein notation|implied summation]] over the twice-repeated index {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}. This looks promising, because we see by inspection the rest energy of the particle and, in case {{math|''A'' {{=}} 0}}, the energy of a charge placed in an electric potential {{math|''qA''<sup>0</sup>}}. What about the term involving the vector potential? In classical electrodynamics, the energy of a charge moving in an applied potential is\n\n:<math>H = c\\sqrt{\\left(p - qA\\right)^2 + m^2c^2} + qA^0.</math>\n\nThus, the Dirac Hamiltonian is fundamentally distinguished from its classical counterpart, and we must take great care to correctly identify what is observable in this theory. Much of the apparently paradoxical behavior implied by the Dirac equation amounts to a misidentification of these observables.\n\n=== Hole theory ===\nThe negative {{math|''E''}} solutions to the equation are problematic, for it was assumed that the particle has a positive energy. Mathematically speaking, however, there seems to be no reason for us to reject the negative-energy solutions. Since they exist, we cannot simply ignore them, for once we include the interaction between the electron and the electromagnetic field, any electron placed in a positive-energy eigenstate would decay into negative-energy eigenstates of successively lower energy. Real electrons obviously do not behave in this way, or they would disappear by emitting energy in the form of [[photon]]s.\n\nTo cope with this problem, Dirac introduced the hypothesis, known as '''hole theory''', that the [[vacuum]] is the many-body quantum state in which all the negative-energy electron eigenstates are occupied. This description of the vacuum as a \"sea\" of electrons is called the [[Dirac sea]]. Since the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] forbids electrons from occupying the same state, any additional electron would be forced to occupy a positive-energy eigenstate, and positive-energy electrons would be forbidden from decaying into negative-energy eigenstates.\n\nIf an electron is forbidden from simultaneously occupying positive-energy and negative-energy eigenstates, then the feature known as [[Zitterbewegung]], which arises from the interference of positive-energy and negative-energy states, would have to be considered to be an unphysical prediction of time-dependent Dirac theory.  This conclusion may be inferred from the explanation of hole theory given in the preceding paragraph. Recent results have been published in Nature [R. Gerritsma, G. Kirchmair, F. Zaehringer, E. Solano, R. Blatt, and C. Roos, Nature 463, 68-71 (2010)] in which the Zitterbewegung feature was simulated in a trapped-ion experiment. This experiment impacts the hole interpretation if one infers that the physics-laboratory experiment is not merely a check on the mathematical correctness of a Dirac-equation solution but the measurement of a real effect whose detectability in electron physics is still beyond reach.\n\nDirac further reasoned that if the negative-energy eigenstates are incompletely filled, each unoccupied eigenstate – called a '''hole''' – would behave like a positively charged particle. The hole possesses a ''positive'' energy since energy is required to create a particle–hole pair from the vacuum. As noted above, Dirac initially thought that the hole might be the proton, but [[Hermann Weyl]] pointed out that the hole should behave as if it had the same mass as an electron, whereas the proton is over 1800 times heavier. The hole was eventually identified as the [[positron]], experimentally discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]] in 1932.\n\nIt is not entirely satisfactory to describe the \"vacuum\" using an infinite sea of negative-energy electrons. The infinitely negative contributions from the sea of negative-energy electrons have to be canceled by an infinite positive \"bare\" energy and the contribution to the charge density and current coming from the sea of negative-energy electrons is exactly canceled by an infinite positive \"[[jellium]]\" background so that the net electric charge density of the vacuum is zero. In [[quantum field theory]], a [[Bogoliubov transformation]] on the [[creation and annihilation operators]] (turning an occupied negative-energy electron state into an unoccupied positive energy positron state and an unoccupied negative-energy electron state into an occupied positive energy positron state) allows us to bypass the Dirac sea formalism even though, formally, it is equivalent to it.\n\nIn certain applications of [[condensed matter physics]], however, the underlying concepts of \"hole theory\" are valid. The sea of [[conduction electron]]s in an [[electrical conductor]], called a [[Composite fermion#Fermi sea|Fermi sea]], contains electrons with energies up to the [[chemical potential]] of the system. An unfilled state in the Fermi sea behaves like a positively charged electron, though it is referred to as a \"hole\" rather than a \"positron\". The negative charge of the Fermi sea is balanced by the positively charged ionic lattice of the material.\n\n=== In quantum field theory ===\n{{See also|Fermionic field}}\nIn [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] such as [[quantum electrodynamics]], the Dirac field is subject to a process of [[second quantization]], which resolves some of the paradoxical features of the equation.\n\n== Other formulations ==\n\nThe Dirac equation can be formulated in a number of other ways.\n\n=== As a differential equation in one real component ===\n\nGenerically (if a certain linear function of electromagnetic field does not vanish identically), three out of four components of the spinor function in the Dirac equation can be algebraically eliminated, yielding an equivalent fourth-order partial differential equation for just one component.

This can be shown analogously to the previous case.\n\nThis solution is useful for showing the relation between [[anti-particle]] and particle.\n\n==Details==\n===Two-spinors===\nThe most convenient definitions for the two-spinors are:\n:<math>\n  \\phi^1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\quad\n  \\phi^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\,\n</math>\n\nand\n:<math>\n  \\chi^1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\quad\n  \\chi^2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\,\n</math>\n\n===Pauli matrices===\nThe [[Pauli matrices]] are\n:<math>\n  \\sigma_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & 1\\\\\n    1 & 0\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\quad\n  \\sigma_2 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 & -i \\\\\n    i &  0\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\quad\n  \\sigma_3 = \n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 &  0 \\\\\n    0 & -1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nUsing these, one can calculate:\n:<math>\\vec{\\sigma}\\cdot\\vec{p} = \\sigma_1 p_1 + \\sigma_2 p_2 + \\sigma_3 p_3 =\n  \\begin{bmatrix} \n    p_3         & p_1 - i p_2 \\\\\n    p_1 + i p_2 & - p_3\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\n==Four-spinors==\n===For particles===\nParticles are defined as having ''positive'' energy. The normalization for the four-spinor ω is chosen so that the total probability is invariant under Lorentz  transformation. The total probability is: \n:<math> P = \\int_{V} \\omega^\\dagger \\omega dV\n</math>\nwhere <math> V </math> is the volume of integration. Under Lorentz transformation, the volume scales as the inverse of Lorentz factor: <math> (E/m)^{-1} </math>. This implies that the probability density must be normalized proportional to <math>E </math> so the total probability is Lorentz invariant. The usual convention is to choose <math>\\omega^\\dagger \\omega \\;=\\; 2 E \\,</math>. Hence the spinors, denoted as ''u'' are:\n:<math>u\\left(\\vec{p}, s\\right) = \\sqrt{E + m} \n  \\begin{bmatrix} \n    \\phi^{(s)}\\\\ \n    \\frac{\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{p}}{E + m} \\phi^{(s)}\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' = 1 or 2 (spin \"up\" or \"down\")\n\nExplicitly,\n:<math>u\\left(\\vec{p}, 1\\right) = \\sqrt{E+m}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    1 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    \\frac{p_3}{E + m} \\\\\n    \\frac{p_1 + i p_2}{E + m}\n  \\end{bmatrix} \\quad \\mathrm{and} \\quad\n  u\\left(\\vec{p}, 2\\right) = \\sqrt{E + m}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    0 \\\\\n    1 \\\\\n    \\frac{p_1 - i p_2}{E + m} \\\\\n    \\frac{-p_3}{E + m} \n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\n===For anti-particles===\nAnti-particles having ''positive'' energy <math>\\scriptstyle E</math> are defined as particles having ''negative'' energy and propagating backward in time. Hence changing the sign of <math>\\scriptstyle E</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\vec{p}</math> in the four-spinor for particles will give the four-spinor for anti-particles:\n:<math> v(\\vec{p},s) = \\sqrt{E+m} \n  \\begin{bmatrix} \n    \\frac{\\vec{\\sigma} \\cdot \\vec{p}}{E + m} \\chi^{(s)} \\\\\n    \\chi^{(s)}\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nHere we choose the <math>\\scriptstyle\\chi</math> solutions.  Explicitly,\n:<math>v\\left(\\vec{p}, 1\\right) = \\sqrt{E + m}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\frac{p_3}{E + m} \\\\\n    \\frac{p_1 + i p_2}{E + m} \\\\\n    1 \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n  \\quad \\mathrm{and} \\quad \n  v(\\vec{p}, 2) = \\sqrt{E+m}\n  \\begin{bmatrix}\n    \\frac{p_1 - i p_2}{E+m} \\\\\n    \\frac{-p_3}{E+m} \\\\\n    0 \\\\\n    1\n  \\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nNote that these solutions are readily obtained by substituting the ansatz <math>\\psi =  v e^{+ i p x}</math> into the Dirac equation.\n\n==Completeness relations==\nThe completeness relations for the four-spinors ''u'' and ''v'' are\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\sum_{s=1,2}{u^{(s)}_p \\bar{u}^{(s)}_p} &= {p\\!\\!\\!/} + m \\\\\n  \\sum_{s=1,2}{v^{(s)}_p \\bar{v}^{(s)}_p} &= {p\\!\\!\\!/} - m\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n:<math>{p\\!\\!\\!/} = \\gamma^\\mu p_\\mu  \\,</math> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (see [[Feynman slash notation#With four-momentum|Feynman slash notation]])\n:<math>\\bar{u} = u^\\dagger \\gamma^0 \\,</math>\n\n==Dirac spinors and the Dirac algebra==\nThe [[Dirac matrices]] are a set of four 4×4 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that are used as [[Spin (physics)|spin]] and [[Charge (physics)|charge]] [[Operator (physics)|operators]].\n\n===Conventions===\nThere are several choices of [[Signature (physics)|signature]] and [[Group representation|representation]] that are in common use in the physics literature. The Dirac matrices are typically written as <math>\\scriptstyle \\gamma^\\mu</math> where <math>\\scriptstyle \\mu</math> runs from 0 to 3. In this notation, 0 corresponds to time, and 1 through 3 correspond to x, y, and z.\n\nThe + − − − [[Signature (physics)|signature]] is sometimes called the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] metric, while the − + + + is the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] metric. At this time the + − − − signature is in more common use, and our example will use this signature. To switch from one example to the other, multiply all <math>\\scriptstyle\\gamma^\\mu</math> by <math>\\scriptstyle i</math>.\n\nAfter choosing the signature, there are many ways of constructing a representation in the 4&times;4 matrices, and many are in common use. In order to make this example as general as possible we will not specify a representation until the final step. At that time we will substitute in the [[Chirality (physics)|\"chiral\"]] or [[Hermann Weyl|\"Weyl\"]] representation.\n\n===Construction of Dirac spinor with a given spin direction and charge===\nFirst we choose a [[spin (physics)|spin]] direction for our electron or positron.  As with the example of the Pauli algebra discussed above, the spin direction is defined by a [[unit vector]] in 3 dimensions, (a, b, c).  Following the convention of Peskin & Schroeder, the spin operator for spin in the (a, b, c) direction is defined as the dot product of (a, b, c) with the vector\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  (i\\gamma^2\\gamma^3,\\;\\;i\\gamma^3\\gamma^1,\\;\\;i\\gamma^1\\gamma^2) &= -(\\gamma^1,\\;\\gamma^2,\\;\\gamma^3)i\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\gamma^3 \\\\\n                                                 \\sigma_{(a,b,c)} &= ia\\gamma^2\\gamma^3 + ib\\gamma^3\\gamma^1 + ic\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote that the above is a [[root of unity]], that is, it squares to 1.  Consequently, we can make a [[projection operator]] from it that projects out the sub-algebra of the Dirac algebra that has spin oriented in the (a, b, c) direction:\n\n:<math>P_{(a,b,c)} = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\sigma_{(a,b,c)}\\right)</math>\n\nNow we must choose a charge, +1 (positron) or −1 (electron).  Following the conventions of Peskin & Schroeder, the operator for charge is <math>\\scriptstyle Q \\,=\\, -\\gamma^0</math>, that is, electron states will take an eigenvalue of −1 with respect to this operator while positron states will take an eigenvalue of +1.\n\nNote that <math>\\scriptstyle Q</math> is also a square root of unity.  Furthermore, <math>\\scriptstyle Q</math> commutes with <math>\\scriptstyle\\sigma_{(a, b, c)}</math>.  They form a [[complete set of commuting operators]] for the Dirac algebra.  Continuing with our example, we look for a representation of an electron with spin in the (a, b, c) direction.  Turning <math>\\scriptstyle Q</math> into a projection operator for charge = −1, we have\n:<math>P_{-Q} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 - Q\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\gamma^0\\right)</math>\n\nThe projection operator for the spinor we seek is therefore the product of the two projection operators we've found:\n:<math>P_{(a, b, c)}\\;P_{-Q}</math>\n\nThe above projection operator, when applied to any spinor, will give that part of the spinor that corresponds to the electron state we seek. So we can apply it to a spinor with the value 1 in one of its components, and 0 in the others, which gives a column of the matrix.  Continuing the example, we put (a, b, c) = (0, 0, 1) and have\n:<math>P_{(0, 0, 1)} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + i\\gamma_1\\gamma_2\\right)</math>\n\nand so our desired projection operator is\n:<math>P = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+ i\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1 + \\gamma^0\\right) = \n\\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 + \\gamma^0 + i\\gamma^1\\gamma^2 + i\\gamma^0\\gamma^1\\gamma^2\\right)</math>\n\nThe 4×4 gamma matrices used in the Weyl representation are\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\gamma_0 &= \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n  \\gamma_k &= \\begin{bmatrix}0 & \\sigma^k \\\\ -\\sigma^k & 0\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nfor k = 1, 2, 3  and where <math>\\sigma^i</math> are the usual 2×2 [[Pauli matrices]].  Substituting these in for P gives\n\n:<math>P = \\frac{1}{4}\\begin{bmatrix}1 + \\sigma^3 & 1 + \\sigma^3 \\\\ 1 + \\sigma^3 & 1 + \\sigma^3 \\end{bmatrix}\n  = \\frac{1}{2}\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nOur answer is any non-zero column of the above matrix.  The division by two is just a normalization.  The first and third columns give the same result:\n\n:<math>\\left|e^-,\\, +\\frac{1}{2}\\right\\rangle = \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nMore generally, for electrons and positrons with spin oriented in the (a, b, c) direction, the projection operator is\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{4}\\begin{bmatrix}\n      1 +  c  &     a - ib  & \\pm(1 +  c) & \\pm(a - ib) \\\\\n      a + ib  &     1 -  c  & \\pm(a + ib) & \\pm(1 -  c) \\\\\n  \\pm(1 +  c) & \\pm(a - ib) &     1 +  c  &     a - ib  \\\\\n  \\pm(a + ib) & \\pm(1 -  c) &     a + ib  &     1 -  c\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nwhere the upper signs are for the electron and the lower signs are for the positron.  The corresponding spinor can be taken as any non zero column.  Since <math>\\scriptstyle a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \\,=\\, 1</math> the different columns are multiples of the same spinor. The representation of the resulting spinor in the [[Gamma matrices#Dirac basis|Dirac basis]] can be obtained using the rule given in the [[bispinor]] article.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dirac equation]]\n*[[Helicity basis]]\n*[[Spin(3,1)]], the [[double cover (topology)|double cover]] of [[SO(3,1)]] by a [[spin group]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Aitchison\n  | first = I.J.R.\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=A.J.G.

      "text": "{{merge from|Polar form of the Dirac equation|discuss=Talk:Fermionic field#Proposed merge with Polar form of the Dirac equation|date=December 2018}}\nIn [[quantum field theory]], a '''fermionic field''' is a [[quantum field]] whose [[Quantum|quanta]] are [[fermion]]s; that is, they obey [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. Fermionic fields obey [[canonical anticommutation relation]]s rather than the [[canonical commutation relation]]s of [[bosonic field]]s.\n\nThe most prominent example of a fermionic field is the Dirac field, which describes fermions with [[spin (physics)|spin]]-1/2: [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[quarks]], etc. The Dirac field can be described as either a 4-component [[spinor]] or as a pair of 2-component Weyl spinors. Spin-1/2 [[Majorana fermion]]s, such as the hypothetical [[neutralino]], can be described as either a dependent 4-component [[Majorana spinor]] or a single 2-component Weyl spinor. It is not known whether the [[neutrino]] is a Majorana fermion or a [[Dirac fermion]]; observing [[double beta decay#neutrinoless double beta decay|neutrinoless double-beta decay]] experimentally would settle this question.\n\n==Basic properties==\nFree (non-interacting) fermionic fields obey [[canonical anticommutation relation]]s; i.e., involve the [[anticommutator]]s {''a'', ''b''} = ''ab'' + ''ba'', rather than the commutators [''a'', ''b''] = ''ab'' − ''ba'' of bosonic or standard quantum mechanics. Those relations also hold for interacting fermionic fields in the [[interaction picture]], where the fields evolve in time as if free and the effects of the interaction are encoded in the evolution of the states.\n\nIt is these anticommutation relations that imply Fermi–Dirac statistics for the field quanta. They also result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]: two fermionic particles cannot occupy the same state at the same time.\n\n==Dirac fields==\nThe prominent example of a spin-1/2 fermion field is the '''Dirac field''' (named after [[Paul Dirac]]), and denoted by <math>\\psi(x)</math>. The equation of motion for a free spin 1/2 particle is the [[Dirac equation]],\n\n:<math>\\left(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m\\right) \\psi(x) = 0.\\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\gamma^{\\mu}</math> are [[gamma matrices]] and <math>m</math> is the mass. The simplest possible solutions to this equation are plane wave solutions, <math>\\psi_1(x) = u(p)e^{-ip.x}\\,</math> and <math>\\psi_2(x) = v(p)e^{ip.x}\\,</math>. These [[plane wave]] solutions form a basis for the Fourier components of <math>\\psi(x)</math>, allowing for the general expansion of the wave function as follows,\n\n:<math>\\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{d^3 p}{(2\\pi)^3} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2E_p}} \\sum_{s} \\left(a^s_\\mathbf{p} u^s(p) e^{-ip \\cdot x} + b^{s\\dagger}_\\mathbf{p} v^s(p) e^{ip \\cdot x}\\right).\\,</math>\n\n''u'' and ''v'' are spinors, labelled by spin, ''s''. For the electron, a spin 1/2 particle, ''s'' = +1/2 or s=−1/2. The energy factor is the result of having a Lorentz invariant integration measure. In [[second quantization]], <math>\\psi(x)</math> is promoted to an operator, so the coefficients of its Fourier modes must be operators too. Hence, <math>a^{s}_{\\mathbf{p}}</math> and <math>b^{s \\dagger}_{\\mathbf{p}}</math> are operators. The properties of these operators can be discerned from the properties of the field. <math>\\psi(x)</math> and <math>\\psi(y)^{\\dagger}</math> obey the anticommutation relations:\n\n:<math>\\left\\{\\psi_a(\\mathbf{x}), \\psi_b^\\dagger(\\mathbf{y})\\right\\} = \\delta^{(3)}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y})\\delta_{ab},</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' and ''b'' are spinor indices. We impose an anticommutator relation (as opposed to a [[canonical commutation relation|commutation relation]] as we do for the [[bosonic field]]) in order to make the operators compatible with [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]. By putting in the expansions for <math>\\psi(x)</math> and <math>\\psi(y)</math>, the anticommutation relations for the coefficients can be computed.\n\n:<math>\\left\\{a^r_\\mathbf{p}, a^{s \\dagger}_\\mathbf{q}\\right\\} = \\left\\{b^r_\\mathbf{p}, b^{s\\dagger}_\\mathbf{q}\\right\\} = (2\\pi)^{3} \\delta^3 (\\mathbf{p} - \\mathbf{q}) \\delta^{rs},\\,</math>\n\nIn a manner analogous to non-relativistic annihilation and creation operators and their commutators, these algebras lead to the physical interpretation that <math>a^{s \\dagger}_{\\mathbf{p}}</math> creates a fermion of momentum '''p''' and spin s, and <math>b^{r \\dagger}_{\\mathbf{q}}</math> creates an antifermion of momentum '''q''' and spin ''r''. The general field <math>\\psi(x)</math> is now seen to be a weighted (by the energy factor) summation over all possible spins and momenta for creating fermions and antifermions. Its conjugate field, <math>\\overline{\\psi} \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\  \\psi^{\\dagger} \\gamma^{0}</math>, is the opposite, a weighted summation over all possible spins and momenta for annihilating fermions and antifermions.\n\nWith the field modes understood and the conjugate field defined, it is possible to construct Lorentz invariant quantities for fermionic fields. The simplest is the quantity <math>\\overline{\\psi}\\psi\\,</math>. This makes the reason for the choice of <math>\\overline{\\psi} = \\psi^{\\dagger} \\gamma^{0}</math>clear. This is because the general Lorentz transform on <math>\\psi</math> is not [[Unitary transformation|unitary]] so the quantity <math>\\psi^{\\dagger}\\psi</math> would not be invariant under such transforms, so the inclusion of <math>\\gamma^{0}\\,</math> is to correct for this. The other possible non-zero [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] quantity, up to an overall conjugation, constructible from the fermionic fields is <math>\\overline{\\psi}\\gamma^{\\mu}\\partial_{\\mu}\\psi</math>.\n\nSince linear combinations of these quantities are also Lorentz invariant, this leads naturally to the [[Lagrangian density]] for the Dirac field by the requirement that the [[Euler–Lagrange equation]] of the system recover the Dirac equation.\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{L}_D = \\overline{\\psi}\\left(i\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - m\\right)\\psi\\,</math>\n\nSuch an expression has its indices suppressed.

Note that the Feynman propagator for the Klein–Gordon field has this same property. Since all reasonable observables (such as energy, charge, particle number, etc.) are built out of an even number of fermion fields, the commutation relation vanishes between any two observables at spacetime points outside the light cone. As we know from elementary quantum mechanics two simultaneously commuting observables can be measured simultaneously. We have therefore correctly implemented [[Lorentz invariance]] for the Dirac field, and preserved [[causality]].\n\nMore complicated field theories involving interactions (such as [[Yukawa theory]], or [[quantum electrodynamics]]) can be analyzed too, by various perturbative and non-perturbative methods.\n\nDirac fields are an important ingredient of the [[Standard Model]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dirac equation]]\n*[[Einstein-Maxwell-Dirac equations|Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations]]\n*[[Spin-statistics theorem]]\n*[[Spinor]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite journal |last=Edwards |first=D. |year=1981 |title=The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Field Theory: Fermions, Gauge Fields, and Super-symmetry, Part I: Lattice Field Theories |journal=Int.

It provides a representation of solutions of the [[Dirac equation]] in (1+1)-dimensional [[spacetime]] as discrete sums.\n\nThe model can be visualised by considering relativistic [[random walk]]s on a two-dimensional spacetime checkerboard. At each discrete timestep <math>\\epsilon</math> the particle of mass <math>m</math> moves a distance <math>\\epsilon c</math> to the left or right (<math>c</math> being the [[speed of light]]). For such a discrete motion, the [[Path integral formulation|Feynman path integral]] reduces to a sum over the possible paths. Feynman demonstrated that if each \"turn\" (change of moving from left to right or conversely) of the space–time path is weighted by <math>-i \\epsilon mc^2/\\hbar</math> (with <math>\\hbar</math> denoting the reduced [[Planck's constant]]), in the limit of infinitely small checkerboard squares the sum of all weighted paths yields a propagator that satisfies the one-dimensional [[Dirac equation]]. As a result, [[Helicity (particle physics)|helicity]] (the one-dimensional equivalent of [[Spin (physics)|spin]]) is obtained from a simple [[Cellular automaton|cellular-automata]]-type rule.\n\nThe checkerboard model is important because it connects aspects of spin and [[chirality]] with propagation in spacetime<ref name = \"schweb\">{{cite book | first = Silvan S. | last = Schweber | authorlink = Silvan S. Schweber | title = QED and the men who made it | publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] | year =1994}}</ref> and is the only sum-over-path formulation in which quantum phase is discrete at the level of the paths, taking only values corresponding to the 4th [[roots of unity]].\n\n==History==\n\nFeynman invented the model in the  1940s while developing his spacetime approach to quantum mechanics.<ref name=\"feyn\">\nR.

      "text": "In [[theoretical physics]], a '''Fierz identity''' is an identity that allows one to rewrite ''[[Bilinear form|bilinear]]s of the product'' of two [[spinor]]s as a [[linear combination]] of ''products of the bilinears'' of the individual spinors. It is named after Swiss physicist [[Markus Fierz]].\n\nThere is a version of the Fierz identities for [[Dirac spinor]]s and there is another version for [[Weyl spinor]]s. And there are versions for other dimensions besides 3+1 dimensions.\n\nSpinor bilinears can be thought of as elements of a [[Clifford Algebra]]. Then the Fierz identity is the concrete realization of the [[Clifford Algebra#Relation to the exterior algebra|relation to the exterior algebra]]. In particular, when working in 4 spacetime dimensions the bivector <math>\\psi \\bar{\\chi}</math> may be decomposed in terms of the [[Dirac matrices]] that [[Linear_span|span]] the space:\n\n<math>\\psi \\bar{\\chi} = \\frac{1}{4}( c_S \\mathbb{1} + c_V^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu + c_T^{\\mu\\nu} T_{\\mu\\nu} + c_A^\\mu \\gamma_\\mu \\gamma_5 + c_P \\gamma_5 )</math>. \n\nThe coefficients are <math> c_S = (\\bar\\chi \\psi), c_V^\\mu=(\\bar\\chi \\gamma^\\mu \\psi), c_T^{\\mu\\nu}=-(\\bar\\chi T^{\\mu\\nu}\\psi), c_A^\\mu =-(\\bar\\chi \\gamma^\\mu \\gamma_5\\psi), c_P=(\\bar\\chi \\gamma^5 \\psi)</math>, and are usually determined by using the [[orthogonality]] of the basis under the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] operation. By sandwiching the above decomposition between the desired gamma structures, the identities for the contraction of two Dirac bilinears of the same type can be written with coefficients according to the following table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!

The table is symmetric with respect to reflection across the central element. \n\nThe signs in the table correspond to the case of ''commuting spinors'', otherwise, as is the case of fermions in physics,  ''all coefficients change signs''. \n\nFor example, under the assumption of commuting bispinors, the V × V product can be expanded as,\n:<math>\n\\left(\\bar\\chi\\gamma^\\mu\\psi\\right)\\left(\\bar\\psi\\gamma_\\mu \\chi\\right)=\n\\left(\\bar\\chi\\chi\\right)\\left(\\bar\\psi\\psi\\right)-\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\bar\\chi\\gamma^\\mu\\chi\\right)\\left(\\bar\\psi\\gamma_\\mu\\psi\\right)-\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\bar\\chi\\gamma^\\mu\\gamma_5\\chi\\right)\\left(\\bar\\psi\\gamma_\\mu\\gamma_5\\psi\\right)\n-\\left(\\bar\\chi\\gamma_5\\chi\\right)\\left(\\bar\\psi\\gamma_5\\psi\\right)~.</math>\n\nCombinations of bilinears corresponding to the eigenvectors of the transpose matrix transform to the same combinations with eigenvalues ±1.

      "text": "In [[differential geometry]], the '''local twistor bundle''' is a specific [[vector bundle]] with [[connection (vector bundle)|connection]] that can be associated to any [[conformal manifold]], at least locally.  Intuitively, a local twistor is an association of a [[twistor space]] to each point of space-time, together with a conformally invariant connection that relates the twistor spaces at different points.  This connection can have [[holonomy]] that obstructs the existence of \"global\" twistors (that is, solutions of the twistor equation in open sets).\n\n==Construction==\nLet ''M'' be a pseudo-Riemannian conformal manifold with a [[spin structure]] and a conformal metric of signature (''p'',''q'').  The conformal group is the [[orthogonal group|pseudo-orthogonal group]] <math>SO(p+1,q+1)</math>.  There is a [[Cartan connection|conformal Cartan connection]] on a bundle, the [[tractor bundle]], of ''M''.  The [[spin group]] of <math>SO(p+1,q+1)</math> admits a fundamental representation, the [[spin representation]], and the [[associated bundle]] is the local twistor bundle.\n\n==Representation via Weyl spinors==\nLocal twistors can be represented as pairs of [[Weyl spinor]]s on ''M'' (in general from different spin representations, determined by the reality conditions specific to the signature).  In the case of a four-dimensional [[Lorentzian manifold]], such as the space-time of general relativity, a local twistor has the form\n:<math>Z^\\alpha = \\begin{bmatrix}\\omega^A\\\\\\pi_{A'}\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nHere we use index conventions from {{harvtxt|Penrose|Rindler|1986}}, and <math>\\omega^A</math> and <math>\\pi_{A'}</math> are two-component complex spinors for the Lorentz group <math>SL(2,\\mathbb C)</math>.\n\n==Local twistor transport==\nThe connection, sometimes called ''local twistor transport'', is given by\n:<math>dZ^\\alpha = \\begin{bmatrix}d\\omega^A - i\\theta^{AA'}\\pi_{A'}\\\\ d\\pi_{A'}-iP_{AA'}\\omega^A\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nHere <math>\\theta^{AA'}</math> is the [[canonical one-form]] and <math>P_{AA'}</math> the [[Schouten tensor]], contracted on one index with the canonical one-form.  An analogous equation holds in other dimensions, with appropriate [[Clifford algebra]] multipliers between the two Weyl spin representations {{harv|Sparling|1986}}.  In this formalism, the [[twistor equation]] is the requirement that a local twistor be parallel under the connection.\n\n==Canonical filtration==\nIn general, the local twistor bundle ''T'' is equipped with a [[short exact sequence]] of vector bundles\n:<math>0\\to \\Pi\\to T\\to \\Omega\\to 0</math>\nwhere <math>\\Pi</math> and <math>\\Omega</math> are two Weyl spin bundles.  The bundle <math>\\Pi</math> is a distinguished sub-bundle, that corresponds to the marked point of contact of the conformal Cartan connection.  That is, there is a canonical marked one-dimensional subspace ''X'' in the tractor bundle, and <math>\\Pi</math> is the annihilator of ''X'' under Clifford multipliction.  In four dimensions, <math>\\Pi</math> is the space of spinors <math>\\pi_{A'}</math> and <math>\\Omega</math> the space of <math>\\omega^A</math>.  Under the [[Plücker embedding]], the tractor bundle in four dimensions is isomorphic to the [[exterior algebra|exterior square]] of the local twistor bundle, and <math>\\Pi</math> consists of all the twistors incident with\n:<math>X^{\\alpha\\beta}=\\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\\\ 0&\\epsilon_{A'B'}\\end{bmatrix}</math>\nwhere <math>\\epsilon_{A'B'}</math> is the symplectic form on <math>\\Pi</math>.\n\n==Curvature==\nThe curvature of the local twistor connection involves both the [[Weyl curvature]] and the [[Cotton tensor]].  (It is the Cartan conformal curvature.)  The curvature preserves the space <math>\\Pi</math>, and on <math>\\Pi</math> it involves only the conformally-invariant Weyl curvature.\n\n==References==\n* {{citation|title= Spinors and Space-Time: Vol. II, Spinor and Twistor Methods in Space-Time Geometry  |last1=Penrose |first1=R. |last2=Rindler |first2=W. |year=1986 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-25267-9}}\n* {{citation|first=G|last=Sparling|title=Towards the geometrization of physics|journal=Nature|year=1986|volume=321|pages=417–419}}\n\n[[Category:Spinors]]"
