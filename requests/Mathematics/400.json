      "text": "{{citations|date=June 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde''' (28 February 1735 – 1 January 1796) was a French mathematician, musician and [[chemist]] who worked with [[Bézout]] and [[Lavoisier]]; his name is now principally associated with [[determinant]] theory in mathematics. He was born in [[Paris]], and died there.\n\n==Biography==\nVandermonde was a violinist, and became engaged with mathematics only around 1770. In ''Mémoire sur la résolution des équations'' (1771) he reported on [[symmetric function]]s and solution of [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s; this paper anticipated later [[Galois theory]] (see also [[abstract algebra]] for the role of Vandermonde in the genesis of group theory). In ''Remarques sur des problèmes de situation'' (1771) he studied [[knight's tour]]s, and presaged the development of [[knot theory]] by explicitly noting the importance of [[topology|topological]] features when discussing the properties of knots:\n\n''\"Whatever the twists and turns of a system of threads in space, one can always obtain an expression for the calculation of its dimensions, but this expression will be of little use in practice. The craftsman who fashions a braid, a net, or some knots will be concerned, not with questions of measurement, but with those of position: what he sees there is the manner in which the theads are interlaced\"''\n\nThe same year he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. ''Mémoire sur des irrationnelles de différents ordres avec une application au cercle'' (1772) was on [[combinatorics]], and ''Mémoire sur l'élimination'' (1772) on the foundations of determinant theory. These papers were presented to the ''[[Académie des Sciences]]'', and constitute all his published mathematical work. The [[Vandermonde determinant]] does not make an explicit appearance.\n\nHe was professor at the [[École Normale Supérieure]], member of the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] and examiner at the [[École polytechnique]].\n\n== Honors ==\n* A special class of [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], the [[Vandermonde matrix|Vandermonde matrices]] are named after him, as is an elementary fact of combinatorics, [[Vandermonde's identity]].\n* Vandermonde is the secret society of the [[Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers]].<ref>[http://www.espace-turing.fr/Naissance-de-Alexandre-Theophile.html Vandermonde : secret society of the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Knight's tour|Knight's Tour]]\n*[[Vandermonde's identity]]\n* [[Vandermonde polynomial]]\n* [[Vandermonde matrix]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Gilbert Faccarello, ''Du Conservatoire à l'Ecole Normale'', Les cahiers d'histoire du CNAM, '''2-3''', 17-57, CNAM, Paris, 1993.

He was a lawyer by trade, and served as a [[Conseil du Roi|privy councillor]] to both [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] of France.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Origins ===\nViète was born at [[Fontenay-le-Comte]] in present-day [[Vendée]].  His grandfather was a merchant from [[La Rochelle]]. His father, Etienne Viète, was an attorney in Fontenay-le-Comte and a notary in [[Le Busseau]]. His mother was the aunt of [[Barnabé Brisson]], a [[magistrate]] and the first president of parliament during the ascendancy of the [[Ligue|Catholic League of France.]]\n\nViète went to a [[Franciscan]] school and in 1558 studied law at [[Poitiers]], graduating as a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1559. A year later, he began his career as an attorney in his native town.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=57}} From the outset, he was entrusted with some major cases, including the settlement of rent in Poitou for the widow of [[King Francis I of France]] and looking after the interests of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].\n\n=== Serving Parthenay ===\nIn 1564, Viète entered the service of Antoinette d’Aubeterre, Lady Soubise, wife of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise, one of the main [[Huguenot]] military leaders and accompanied him to [[Lyon]] to collect documents about his heroic defence of that city against the troops of [[Duke of Nemours|Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours]] just the year before.\n\nThe same year, at Parc-Soubise, in the commune of [[Mouchamps]] in present-day [[Vendée]], Viète became the tutor of [[Catherine de Parthenay]], Soubise's twelve-year-old daughter. He taught her science and mathematics and wrote for her numerous treatises on [[astronomy]], geography and [[trigonometry]], some of which have survived. In these treatises, Viète used decimal numbers (twenty years before [[Simon Stevin|Stevin]]'s paper) and he also noted the elliptic orbit of the planets,<ref>{{citation|title=The Cosmos of Science: Essays of Exploration|series=Pittsburgh-Konstanz series in the philosophy and history of science|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Earman|editor2-first=John D.|editor2-last=Norton|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=1998|isbn=9780822972013|contribution=What's new in Kepler's new astronomy?|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|authorlink=Bernard R.

See in particular [https://books.google.com/books?id=_HgF3wfADJIC&pg=PA21 p.&nbsp;21]: \"an unpublished manuscript by Viète includes a mathematical discussion of an ellipse in a planetary model\".</ref> forty years before [[Kepler]] and twenty years before [[Giordano Bruno]]'s death.\n\nJohn V de Parthenay presented him to King [[Charles IX of France]]. Viète wrote a genealogy of the [[Parthenay]] family and following the death of Jean V de Parthenay-Soubise in 1566, his biography.\n\nIn 1568, Antoinette, Lady Soubise, married her daughter Catherine to Baron Charles de Quellenec and Viète went with Lady Soubise to La Rochelle, where he mixed with the highest Calvinist aristocracy, leaders like [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Coligny]] and [[Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé|Condé]] and [[Queen Jeanne d’Albret of Navarre]] and her son, Henry of Navarre, the future [[Henry IV of France]].\n\nIn 1570, he refused to represent the Soubise ladies in their infamous lawsuit against the Baron De Quellenec, where they claimed the Baron was unable (or unwilling) to provide an heir.\n\n=== First steps in Paris ===\nIn 1571, he enrolled as an attorney in Paris, and continued to visit his student Catherine. He regularly lived in Fontenay-le-Comte, where he took on some municipal functions. He began publishing his ''Universalium inspectionum ad canonem mathematicum liber singularis'' and wrote new mathematical research by night or during periods of leisure. He was known to dwell on any one question for up to three days, his elbow on the desk, feeding himself without changing position (according to his friend, [[Jacques de Thou]]).<ref>Kinser, Sam. The works of Jacques-Auguste de Thou. [https://books.google.com/books?id=CKt1buiVRVIC&pg=PA191 Google Books]</ref>\n\nIn 1572, Viète was in Paris during the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]]. That night, Baron De Quellenec was killed after having tried to save [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] the previous night. The same year, Viète met Françoise de Rohan, Lady of Garnache, and became her adviser against [[Jacques of Savoy, 2nd Duke of Nemours|Jacques, Duke of Nemours]].\n\nIn 1573, he became a councillor of the [[Parliament of Brittany]], at [[Rennes]], and two years later, he obtained the agreement of Antoinette d'Aubeterre for the marriage of Catherine of Parthenay to Duke René de Rohan, Françoise's brother.\n\nIn 1576, [[Henri, duc de Rohan]] took him under his special protection, recommending him in 1580 as \"[[maître des requêtes]]\". In 1579, Viète printed his ''canonem mathematicum'' (Metayer publisher). A year later, he was appointed maître des requêtes to the parliament of Paris, committed to serving the king. That same year, his success in the trial between the Duke of Nemours and Françoise de Rohan, to the benefit of the latter, earned him the resentment of the tenacious Catholic League.\n\n=== Exile in Fontenay ===\nBetween 1583 and 1585, the League persuaded Henry III to release Viète, Viète having been accused of sympathy with the Protestant cause. [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]], at Rohan's instigation, addressed two letters to King [[Henry III of France]] on March 3 and April 26, 1585, in an attempt to obtain Viète's restoration to his former office, but he failed.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=57}}\n\nVieta retired to [[Fontenay-le-Comte|Fontenay]] and [[Beauvoir-sur-Mer]], with François de Rohan. He spent four years devoted to mathematics, writing his \"Analytical Art\" or [[New Algebra]].\n\n=== Code-breaker to two kings ===\nIn 1589, Henry III took refuge in Blois. He commanded the royal officials to be at Tours before 15 April 1589. Viète was one of the first who came back to Tours. He deciphered the secret letters of the Catholic League and other enemies of the king. Later, he had arguments with the classical scholar [[Joseph Juste Scaliger]]. Viète triumphed against him in 1590.\n\nAfter the death of Henry III, Vieta became a Privy Councillor to Henry of Navarre, now Henry IV. He was appreciated by the king, who admired his mathematical talents. Viète was given the position of councillor of the ''parlement'' at [[Tours]]. In 1590, Viète discovered the key to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[cipher]], consisting of more than 500 characters, and this meant that all dispatches in that language which fell into the hands of the French could be easily read.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}\n\nHenry IV published a letter from Commander Moreo to the king of Spain. The contents of this letter, read by Viète, revealed that the head of the League in France, the Duke of Mayenne, planned to become king in place of Henry IV. This publication led to the settlement of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. The king of Spain accused Viète of having used magical powers.\nIn 1593, Viète published his arguments against Scaliger. Beginning in 1594, he was appointed exclusively deciphering the enemy's secret codes.\n\n=== Gregorian calendar ===\n{{main|Gregorian calendar}}\nIn 1582, Pope Gregory XIII published his bull ''[[Inter gravissimas]]'' and ordered Catholic kings to comply with the change from the Julian calendar, based on the calculations of the Calabrian doctor [[Aloysius Lilius]], aka Luigi Lilio or Luigi Giglio. His work was resumed, after his death, by the scientific adviser to the Pope, [[Christopher Clavius]].\n\nViète accused Clavius, in a series of pamphlets (1600), of introducing corrections and intermediate days in an arbitrary manner, and misunderstanding the meaning of the works of his predecessor, particularly in the calculation of the lunar cycle. Viète gave a new timetable, which Clavius cleverly refuted,<ref>Clavius, Christophorus. 0perum mathematicorum tomus quintus continens Romani Christophorus Clavius, published by Anton Hierat, Johann Volmar, place Royale Paris, in 1612</ref> after Vieta's death, in his ''Explicatio'' (1603).\n\nIt is said that Viète was wrong. Without doubt, he believed himself to be a kind of \"King of Times\" as the historian of mathematics, Dhombres, claimed.<ref>Otte, Michael; Panza, Marco. Analysis and synthesis in mathematics. [https://books.google.com/books?id=eydlDs-AX54C&pg=PA147&dq=Dhombres+viete&as_brr=3&hl=fr Google Books]</ref> It is true that Vieta held Clavius in low esteem, as evidenced by De Thou:\n\n{{quote|text=He said that Clavius was very clever to explain the principles of mathematics, that he heard with great clarity what the authors had invented, and wrote various treatises compiling what had been written before him without quoting its references. So, his works were in a better order which was scattered and confused in early writings...}}\n\n=== The Adriaan van Roomen problem ===\nIn 1596, Scaliger resumed his attacks from the University of Leyden. Viète replied definitively the following year. In March that same year, [[Adriaan van Roomen]] sought the resolution, by any of Europe's top mathematicians, to a polynomial equation of degree 45. King Henri IV received a snub from the Dutch ambassador, who claimed that there was no mathematician in France. He said it was simply because some Dutch mathematician, Adriaan van Roomen, had not asked any Frenchman to solve his problem.\n\nViète came, saw the problem, and, after leaning on a window for a few minutes, solved it. It was the equation between [[Sine|sin]](x) and sin(x/45). He resolved this at once, and said he was able to give at the same time (actually the next day) the solution to the other 22 problems to the ambassador. \"Ut legit, ut solvit,\" he later said. Further, he sent a new problem back to Van Roomen, for resolution by [[Euclidean tools]] (rule and compass) of the lost answer to the problem first set by [[Apollonius of Perga]]. Van Roomen could not overcome that problem without resorting to a trick (see detail below).\n\n=== Final years ===\nIn 1598, Viète was granted special leave. Henry IV, however, charged him to end the revolt of the Notaries, whom the King had ordered to pay back their fees. Sick and exhausted by work, he left the King's service in December 1602 and received 20,000 [[écu]], which were found at his bedside after his death.\n\nA few weeks before his death, he wrote a final thesis on issues of cryptography, whose memory made obsolete all encryption methods of the time.\nHe died on 23 February 1603, as De Thou wrote,<ref>[http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html De thou (from University of Saint Andrews)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195624/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html |date=2008-07-08 }}</ref> leaving two daughters, Jeanne, whose mother was Barbe Cottereau, and Suzanne, whose mother was Julienne Leclerc. Jeanne, the eldest, died in 1628, having married Jean Gabriau, a councillor of the parliament of [[Brittany]]. Suzanne died in January 1618 in Paris.\n\nThe cause of Vieta's death is unknown. [[Alexander Anderson (mathematician)|Alexander Anderson]], student of Vieta and publisher of his scientific writings, speaks of a \"praeceps et immaturum autoris fatum.\"{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}<ref>Ball, Walter William Rouse.

At the time of Vieta, algebra therefore oscillated between arithmetic, which gave the appearance of a list of rules, and geometry which seemed more rigorous. Meanwhile, Italian mathematicians [[Luca Pacioli]], [[Scipione del Ferro]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ludovico Ferrari]], and especially [[Rafael Bombelli|Raphael Bombelli]] (1560) all developed techniques for solving equations of the third degree, which heralded a new era.\n\nOn the other hand, the German school of the Coss, the Welsh mathematician [[Robert Recorde]] (1550) and the Dutchman [[Simon Stevin]] (1581) brought an early algebraic notation, the use of decimals and exponents. However, complex numbers remained at best a philosophical way of thinking and [[Descartes]], almost a century after their invention, used them as imaginary numbers. Only positive solutions were considered and using geometrical proof was common.\n\nThe task of the mathematicians was in fact twofold. It was necessary to produce algebra in a more geometrical way, i.e., to give it a rigorous foundation; and on the other hand, it was necessary to give geometry a more algebraic sense, allowing the analytical calculation in the plane. Vieta and Descartes solved this dual task in a double revolution. Firstly, Vieta gave algebra a foundation as strong as in geometry. He then ended the algebra of procedures (al-Jabr and Muqabala), creating the first symbolic algebra and claiming that with it, all problems could be solved (''nullum non problema solvere'').<ref name=\"Bos\">H.

Behold, the art which I present is new, but in truth so old, so spoiled and defiled by the ''barbarians,'' that I considered it necessary, in order to introduce an entirely new form into it, to think out and publish a new vocabulary, having gotten rid of all its pseudo-technical terms...\"<ref>{{Citation |last=Hadden |first=Richard W. |title=On the Shoulders of Merchants: Exchange and the Mathematical Conception of Nature in Early Modern Europe |location=New York |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-585-04483-X }}.</ref>\n\nVieta did not know \"multiplied\" notation (given by [[William Oughtred]] in 1631) or the symbol of equality, =, an absence which is more striking because Robert Recorde had used the present symbol for this purpose since 1557 and [[Guilielmus Xylander]] had used parallel vertical lines since 1575.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}\n\nVieta had neither much time, nor students able to brilliantly illustrate his method. He took years in publishing his work, (he was very meticulous) and most importantly, he made a very specific choice to separate the unknown variables, using consonants for parameters and vowels for unknowns. In this notation he perhaps followed some older contemporaries, such as [[Petrus Ramus]], who designated the points in geometrical figures by vowels, making use of consonants, R, S, T, etc., only when these were exhausted.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}} This choice proved disastrous for readability and Descartes, in preferring the first letters to designate the parameters, the latter for the unknowns, showed a greater knowledge of the human heart.\n\nVieta also remained a prisoner of his time in several respects: First, he was heir of Ramus and did not address the lengths as numbers. His writing kept track of homogeneity, which did not simplify their reading. He failed to recognize the complex numbers of Bombelli and needed to double-check his algebraic answers through geometrical construction. Although he was fully aware that his new algebra was sufficient to give a solution, this concession tainted his reputation.\n\nHowever, Vieta created many innovations: the [[binomial formula]], which would be taken by Pascal and Newton, and the link between the roots and coefficients of a polynomial, called [[Vieta's formulas|Vieta's formula]].\n\nVieta was well skilled in most modern artifices, aiming at the simplification of equations by the substitution of new quantities having a certain connection with the primitive unknown quantities. Another of his works, ''Recensio canonica effectionum geometricarum'', bears a modern stamp, being what was later called an [[algebraic geometry]]—a collection of precepts how to construct algebraic expressions with the use of ruler and compass only. While these writings were generally intelligible, and therefore of the greatest didactic importance, the principle of homogeneity, first enunciated by Vieta, was so far in advance of his times that most readers seem to have passed it over. That principle had been made use of by the Greek authors of the classic age; but of later mathematicians only [[Hero of Alexandria|Hero]], [[Diophantus]], etc., ventured to regard lines and surfaces as mere numbers that could be joined to give a new number, their sum.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}\n\nThe study of such sums, found in the works of Diophantus, may have prompted Vieta to lay down the principle that quantities occurring in an equation ought to be homogeneous, all of them lines, or surfaces, or solids, or supersolids—an equation between mere numbers being inadmissible. During the centuries that have elapsed between Vieta's day and the present, several changes of opinion have taken place on this subject. Modern mathematicians like to make homogeneous such equations as are not so from the beginning, in order to get values of a symmetrical shape. Vieta himself did not see that far; nevertheless, he indirectly suggested the thought. He also conceived methods for the general resolution of equations of the second, third and fourth degrees different from those of [[Scipione dal Ferro]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari]], with which he had not been acquainted. He devised an approximate numerical solution of equations of the second and third degrees, wherein [[Leonardo of Pisa]] must have preceded him, but by a method which was completely lost.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}\n\nAbove all, Vieta was the first mathematician who introduced notations for the problem (and not just for the unknowns).<ref name=\"Bos\"/>  As a result, his algebra was no longer limited to the statement of rules, but relied on an efficient computer algebra, in which the operations act on the letters and the results can be obtained at the end of the calculations by a simple replacement. This approach, which is the heart of contemporary algebraic method, was a fundamental step in the development of mathematics.<ref>Helena M. Pycior  : Symbols, Impossible Numbers, and Geometric Entanglements: British Algebra... [https://books.google.com/books?lr=lang_en&client=safari&hl=fr&as_brr=3&id=3AnAcnc-yvIC Google books]</ref> With this, Vieta marked the end of medieval algebra (from Al-Khwarizmi to Stevin) and opened the modern period.\n\n=== The logic of ''species'' ===\nBeing wealthy, Vieta began to publish at his own expense, for a few friends and scholars in almost every country of Europe, the systematic presentation of his mathematic theory, which he called \"[[new algebra|species logistic]]\" (from ''species:'' symbol) or art of calculation on symbols (1591).<ref>Peter Murphy, Peter Murphy (LL. B.)  : Evidence, proof, and facts: a book of sources, [https://books.google.com/books?id=srFqqNvV5k0C Google Books]</ref>\n\nHe described in three stages how to proceed for solving a problem:\n\n* As a first step, he summarized the problem in the form of an equation. Vieta called this stage the '''Zetetic'''. It denotes the known quantities by consonants (B, D, etc.) and the unknown quantities by the vowels (A, E, etc.)\n* In a second step, he made an analysis. He called this stage the Poristic. Here mathematicians must discuss the equation and solve it. It gives the characteristic of the problem, '''porisma''', from which we can move to the next step.\n* In the last step, the '''exegetical analysis''', he returned to the initial problem which presents a solution through a geometrical or numerical construction based on porisma.\n\nAmong the problems addressed by Vieta with this method is the complete resolution of the quadratic equations of the form <math>X^2 + X b = c</math> and third-degree equations of the form <math>X^3 + aX = b</math> (Vieta reduced it to quadratic equations). He knew the connection between the positive [[root of a function|roots]] of an equation (which, in his day, were alone thought of as roots) and the coefficients of the different powers of the unknown quantity (see [[Vieta's formulas]] and their application on [[quadratic equation]]s). He discovered the formula for deriving the [[De Moivre's formula#Formulas for cosine and sine individually|sine of a multiple angle]], knowing that of the simple angle with due regard to the periodicity of sines. This formula must have been known to Vieta in 1593.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}}\n\n=== Adriaan van Roomen's problem ===\nThis famous controversy is told by [[Tallemant des Réaux]] in these terms (46 stories):\n\n\"In the times of Henri the fourth, a Dutchman called [[Adriaan van Roomen|Adrianus Romanus]], a learned mathematician, but not so good as he believed, published a treatise in which he proposed a question to all the mathematicians of Europe, but did not ask any Frenchman. Shortly after, a state ambassador came to the King at Fontainebleau. The King took pleasure in showing him all the sights, and he said people there were excellent in every profession in his kingdom. 'But, Sire,' said the ambassador, 'you have no mathematician, according to Adrianus Romanus, who didn't mention any in his catalog.' 'Yes, we have,' said the King. 'I have an excellent man. Go and seek Monsieur Viette,' he ordered. Vieta, who was at Fontainebleau, came at once. The ambassador sent for the book from Adrianus Romanus and showed the proposal to Vieta, who had arrived in the gallery, and before the King came out, he had already written two solutions with a pencil. By the evening he had sent many other solutions to the ambassador.\"\n\nThis suggests that the Adrien van Roomen problem is an equation of 45°, which Vieta recognized immediately as a chord of an arc of 8° (<math>\\frac{2\\pi}{45}</math> radians). It was then easy to determine the following 22 positive alternatives, the only valid ones at the time.\n\nWhen, in 1595, Vieta published his response to the problem set by Adriaan van Roomen, he proposed finding the resolution of the old [[problem of Apollonius]], namely to find a circle tangent to three given circles. Van Roomen proposed a solution using a [[hyperbola]], with which Vieta did not agree, as he was hoping for a solution using [[Euclidean tools]].\n\nVieta published his own solution in 1600 in his work ''Apollonius Gallus''. In this paper, Vieta made use of the center of similitude of two circles.{{sfn|Cantor|1911|p=58}} His friend De Thou said that Adriaan van Roomen immediately left the University of Würzburg, saddled his horse and went to Fontenay-le-Comte, where Vieta lived. According to De Thou, he stayed a month with him, and learned the methods of the [[new algebra]]. The two men became friends and Vieta paid all van Roomen's expenses before his return to Würzburg.\n\nThis resolution had an almost immediate impact in Europe and Vieta earned the admiration of many mathematicians over the centuries. Vieta did not deal with cases (circles together, these tangents, etc.), but recognized that the number of solutions depends on the relative position of the three circles and outlined the ten resulting situations. Descartes completed (in 1643) the theorem of the three circles of Apollonius, leading to a quadratic equation in 87 terms, each of which is a product of six factors (which, with this method, makes the actual construction humanly impossible).<ref>Henk J.M.

It is unusual in using decimal numbers. These trigonometric tables exceeded those of [[Regiomontanus]] (Triangulate Omnimodis, 1533) and [[Georg Joachim Rheticus|Rheticus]] (1543, annexed to De revolutionibus ... of Copernicus).\n\n* In 1589: ''Deschiffrement description of a letter by the Commander Moreo at Roy Espaigne of his master''.

His father was, according to Dhombres.<ref name=\"Dhombres\">Dhombres, Jean. François Viète et la Réforme. Available at [http://www.cc-parthenay.fr/parthenay/creparth/GUICHARDJp/protestant/protestant%20accueil.html cc-parthenay.fr] {{fr-icon}}</ref> Indifferent in religious matters, he did not adopt the Calvinist faith of Parthenay, nor that of his other protectors, the Rohan family. His call to the parliament of Rennes proved the opposite. At the reception as a member of the court of Brittany, on 6 April 1574, he read in public a statement of Catholic faith.<ref name=\"Dhombres\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Vieta defended and protected Protestants his whole life, and suffered, in turn, the wrath of the League. It seems that for him, the stability of the state must be preserved and that under this requirement, the King's religion did not  matter. At that time, such people were called \"Politicals.\"\n\nFurthermore, at his death, he did not want to confess his sins. A friend had to convince him that his own daughter would not find a husband, were he to refuse the sacraments of the Catholic Church. Whether Vieta was an atheist or not is a matter of debate.<ref name=\"Dhombres\"/>\n\n=== Posterity ===\nDuring the ascendancy of the Catholic League, Vieta's secretary was [[Nathaniel Tarporley]], perhaps one of the more interesting and enigmatic [[mathematician]]s of 16th-century England. When he returned to London, Tarporley became one of the trusted friends of [[Thomas Harriot]].\n\nApart from Catherine de Parthenay, Vieta's other notable students were: French mathematician Jacques Aleaume, from Orleans, [[Marino Ghetaldi]] of Ragusa, [[Jean de Beaugrand]] and the Scottish mathematician [[Alexander Anderson (mathematician)|Alexander Anderson]]. They illustrated his theories by publishing his works and continuing his methods. At his death, his heirs gave his manuscripts to Peter Aleaume.<ref>De Thou, Jacques-Auguste available at [https://archive.org/details/histoireuniverse14thou L'histoire universelle (fr)] and at [http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html Universal History (en)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195624/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Viete_De_Thou.html |date=2008-07-08 }}</ref>  We give here the most important posthumous editions:\n\n* In 1612: ''Supplementum Apollonii Galli'' of Marino Ghetaldi.\n* From 1615 to 1619: ''Animadversionis in Franciscum vietam, Clemente a Cyriaco nuper'' by Alexander Anderson\n* ''Francisci Vietae Fontenaeensis ab aequationum recognitione et emendatione Tractatus duo Alexandrum'' per Andersonum.

Paris, Jacquin, p.&nbsp;219.\n\nThe same year, there appeared an ''Isagoge'' by Antoine Vasset (a pseudonym of [[Claude Hardy]]), and the following year, a translation into Latin of Beaugrand, which Descartes would have received.\n\nIn 1648, the corpus of mathematical works printed by [[Frans van Schooten]], professor at Leiden University (Elzevirs presses). He was assisted by Jacques Golius and Mersenne.\n\nThe English mathematicians [[Thomas Harriot]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and the Dutch physicist [[Willebrord Snellius]], the French mathematicians [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Blaise Pascal]] all used Vieta's ratings. Later, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] sought to analyze what Vieta had done for equations but his fame was soon eclipsed by [[René Descartes]], who, despite the efforts of scholars like [[D'Alembert]], obtained the full paternity of analytical geometry.\n\nAbout 1770, the Italian mathematician Targioni Tozzetti, found in Florence an ''Harmonicum.'' Vieta had written in it: ''Describat Planeta Ellipsim ad motum anomaliœ ad Terram.'' (That shows he adopted Copernic's system and understood before [[Kepler]] the elliptic form of the orbits of planets) <ref>Harvard abstracts about ''Harmonicum Celestae'' : [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1975JHA.....6..185S Adsabs.harvard.edu]</ref>\n\nIn 1841, the French mathematician, [[Michel Chasles]] was one of the first to reevaluate his role in the development of modern algebra.\n\nIn 1847, a letter from [[François Arago]], perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences (Paris) announced his intention to write a biography of Franciscus Vieta.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1890, the polytechnician Fréderic Ritter, based in Fontenay-le-Comte, was the first translator of the works of François Viète and his first contemporary biographer with [[Benjamin Fillon]].\n\n=== Descartes' opinion of Vieta ===\nThirty-four years after the death of Viète, the philosopher [[René Descartes]] published his ''method'' and a book of geometry that changed the landscape of algebra and built on Viète's work, applying it to the geometry by removing its requirements of homogeneity. Descartes, accused by Jean Baptiste Chauveau, a former classmate of La Flèche, explained  in a letter to Mersenne (1639 February) that he never read those works.<ref>Letter from Descartes to Mersenne. (PDF)  [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/denis.collin/au-rp-mersenne-2-02-39.pdf Pagesperso-orange.fr], February 20, 1639 {{fr-icon}}</ref>\n\n\"I have no knowledge of this surveyor and I wonder what he said, that we studied Vieta's work together in Paris, because it is a book which I cannot remember having seen the cover, while I was in France.\"\n\nElsewhere, Descartes said that Vieta's notations were confusing and used unnecessary geometric justifications. In some letters, he showed he understands the program of the ''Artem Analyticem Isagoge''; in others, he shamelessly caricatured Vieta's proposals. One of his biographers, Charles Adam,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/uvresdedescartes12desc Archive.org], Charles Adam, ''Vie et Oeuvre de Descartes'' Paris, L Cerf, 1910, p 215.</ref> noted this contradiction:\n\n\"These words are surprising, by the way, for he (Descartes) had just said a few lines earlier that he had tried to put in his geometry only what he believed \"was known neither by Vieta nor by anyone else\". So he was informed of what Viète knew; and he must have read his works previously.\"\n\nCurrent research has not shown the extent of the direct influence of the works of Vieta on Descartes.  This influence could have been formed through  the works of Adriaan van Roomen or Jacques Aleaume at the Hague, or through the book by Jean de Beaugrand.<ref>\n[https://books.google.com/books?id=UPGVFEDVc0wC&printsec=frontcover&cad=0#PRA1-PA259,M1 Chikara Sasaki. Descartes' mathematical thought p.259]</ref>\n\nIn his letters to Mersenne, Descartes consciously minimized the originality and depth of the work of his predecessors. \"I began,\" he says, \"where Vieta finished\". His views emerged in the 17th century and mathematicians won a clear algebraic language without the requirements of homogeneity. Many contemporary studies have restored the work of Parthenay's mathematician, showing he had the double merit of introducing the first elements of literal calculation and building a first axiomatic for algebra.<ref>For example: {{cite book|title=Analysis by its history|last=Hairer|first=E|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=9780387770314|location=New York|page=6}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Vieta was not the first to propose notation of unknown quantities by letters - [[Jordanus Nemorarius]] had done this in the past - we can reasonably estimate that it would be simplistic to summarize his innovations for that discovery and place him at the junction of algebraic transformations made during the late sixteenth&nbsp;– early 17th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* 1571[[wikt:ff|ff]]: ''Canon mathématique''\n* 1589: ''Deschiffrement d'une lettre escripte par le Commandeur Moreo au Roy d'Espaigne son maître''\n* 1591: ''In artem analyticem isagoge''\n* 1591: ''Zeteticorum libri quinque''\n* 1591–93: ''Effectionum geometricarum canonica recensio''\n* 1593: ''Supplementum geometriae''\n* 1593: ''Variorum de rebus mathematicis responsorum liber VIII''\n* 1595: ''Ad problema quod omnibus mathematicis totius orbis construendum proposuit Adrianus Romanus, Francisci Vietae responsum''\n* 1600: ''De numerosa potestatum ad exegesim resolutione''\n* 1600: ''Apollonius Gallus''\n* 1600–02: ''Fontenaeensis libellorum supplicum in Regia magistri relatio Kalendarii vere Gregoriani ad ecclesiasticos doctores exhibita Pontifici Maximi Clementi VIII''\n* 1612: ''Supplementum Apollonii Galli''\n* 1612: ''Supplementum Apollonii Redivivi sive analysis problematis bactenus desiderati ad Apollonii Pergaei doctrinam a Marino Ghetaldo Patritio Regusino hujusque non ita pridem institutam''\n* 1615: ''Ad Angularum Sectionem Analytica Theoremata F.

Amsterdam awarded him a Ph.D. for a thesis on [[algebraic geometry]], supervised by Hendrick de Vries.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=30607}}</ref> Göttingen awarded him the [[habilitation]] in 1928. In  that year, at the age of 25, he accepted a professorship at the University of Groningen.\n\nIn his 27th year, van der Waerden published his [[Moderne Algebra]], an influential two-volume treatise on [[abstract algebra]], still cited, and perhaps the first treatise to treat the subject as a comprehensive whole. This work systematized an ample body of research by [[Emmy Noether]], [[David Hilbert]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and [[Emil Artin]]. In the following year, 1931, he was appointed professor at the [[University of Leipzig]].\n\n===Nazi Germany===\nDuring the rise of the [[Third Reich]] and through [[World War II]], van der Waerden remained at Leipzig, and passed up opportunities to leave Nazi Germany for [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Utrecht University|Utrecht]]. However, he was critical of the Nazis and refused to give up his Dutch nationality, both of which led to difficulties for him.<ref>Soifer, pp. 393–417.</ref>\n\n===Postwar career===\nFollowing the war, van der Waerden was repatriated to the Netherlands rather than returning to [[Leipzig]] (then under Soviet control), but struggled to find a position in the Dutch academic system, in part because his time in Germany made his politics suspect and in part due to [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]]'s opposition to Hilbert's school of mathematics. After a year visiting [[Johns Hopkins University]] and two years as a part-time professor, in 1950 van der Waerden filled the chair in mathematics at the University of Amsterdam.<ref>Soifer, pp. 418–474.</ref> In 1951, he moved to the [[University of Zurich]], where he spent the rest of his career, supervising more than 40 [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D. students]].\n\n==Contributions==\nVan der Waerden is mainly remembered for his work on [[abstract algebra]]. He also wrote on [[algebraic geometry]], [[topology]], [[number theory]], [[geometry]], [[combinatorics]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[probability]] and [[statistics]], and [[quantum mechanics]] (he and Heisenberg had been colleagues at Leipzig). In his later years, he turned to the [[history of mathematics]] and [[History of science|science]]. His historical writings include ''Ontwakende wetenschap'' (1950), which was translated into English as ''Science Awakening'' (1954), ''Sources of Quantum Mechanics'' (1967), ''Geometry and Algebra in Ancient Civilizations'' (1983), and ''A History of Algebra'' (1985).\n\nVan der Waerden has over 1000 [[academic genealogy|academic descendants]], most of them through three of his students, [[David van Dantzig]] (Ph.D. Groningen 1931),\n[[Herbert Seifert]] (Ph.D. Leipzig 1932), and Hans Richter (Ph.D. Leipzig 1936, co-advised by [[Paul Koebe]]).<ref>{{MathGenealogy |id=30607}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Van der Waerden notation]]\n*[[Van der Waerden number]]\n*[[Van der Waerden's conjecture]]\n*[[Van der Waerden's theorem]]\n*[[Van der Waerden test]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Alexander Soifer]] (2009), ''The Mathematical Coloring Book'', Springer-Verlag {{ISBN|978-0-387-74640-1}}.

He is best known for his text ''Lehrbuch der Algebra'' published in 1895 and much of it is his original research in algebra and number theory. His work ''Theorie der algebraischen Functionen einer Veränderlichen'' (with [[Richard Dedekind|Dedekind]]) established an algebraic foundation for [[Riemann surface]]s, allowing a purely algebraic formulation of the [[Riemann-Roch theorem]].

He was the editor of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s collected works.\n\nWeber was born in [[Heidelberg]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], and entered the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1860.

A significant [[abstract algebra|algebraist]], he proved that a finite [[division algebra]] is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], and part of the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] on [[simple algebra]]s. He also worked on [[group theory]] and [[matrix algebra]].<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Wedderburn}}</ref><ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=282}}</ref>\n\nHis younger brother was the lawyer [[Ernest Wedderburn]].\n\n==Life==\nJoseph Wedderburn was the tenth of fourteen children of Alexander Wedderburn of Pearsie, a physician, and Anne Ogilvie. He was educated at [[Forfar Academy]] then in 1895 his parents sent Joseph and his younger brother [[Ernest Wedderburn|Ernest]] to live in [[Edinburgh]] with their paternal uncle, J R Maclagan Wedderburn, allowing them to attend [[George Watson's College]]. This house was at 3 Glencairn Crescent in the West End of the city.<ref>Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1895</ref>\n\nIn 1898 Joseph entered the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In 1903, he published his first three papers, worked as an assistant in the Physical Laboratory of the University, obtained an [[M.A. (Scotland)|MA]] degree with [[First Class Honours]] in mathematics, and was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], upon the proposal of [[George Chrystal]], [[James Gordon MacGregor]], [[Cargill Gilston Knott]] and [[William Peddie]]. Aged only 21 he remains one of the youngest Fellows ever.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-902198-84-5|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nHe then studied briefly at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of Berlin]], where he met the algebraists [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius|Frobenius]] and [[Issai Schur|Schur]]. A [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|Carnegie Scholarship]] allowed him to spend the 1904–1905 academic year at the [[University of Chicago]] where he worked with [[Oswald Veblen]], [[E. H. Moore]], and most importantly, [[Leonard Dickson]], who was to become the most important American algebraist of his day.\n\nReturning to Scotland in 1905, Wedderburn worked for four years at the [[University of Edinburgh]] as an assistant to [[George Chrystal]], who supervised his [[D.Sc]], awarded in 1908 for a thesis titled ''On Hypercomplex Numbers''. He gained a PhD in algebra from the University of Edinburgh in 1908.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=J.H.|first=Maclagan-Wedderburn,|date=1908|title=Theory of linear associative algebras|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1842/19081|language=en}}</ref> From 1906 to 1908, Wedderburn edited the ''[[Proceedings of the Edinburgh Mathematical Society]]''. In 1909, he returned to the United States to become a Preceptor in Mathematics at [[Princeton University]]; his colleagues included [[Luther P. Eisenhart]], [[Oswald Veblen]], [[Gilbert Ames Bliss]], and [[George Birkhoff]].\n\nUpon the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Wedderburn enlisted in the British Army as a private. He was the first person at Princeton to volunteer for that war, and had the longest war service of anyone on the staff. He served with the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] in France, as [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|Lieutenant]] (1914), then as [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] of the 10th Battalion (1915–18). While a Captain in the Fourth Field Survey Battalion of the [[Royal Engineers]] in France, he devised [[sound-ranging]] equipment to locate enemy artillery.\n\nHe returned to Princeton after the war, becoming Associate Professor in 1921 and editing the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]'' until 1928.  While at Princeton, he supervised only three PhDs, one of them being [[Nathan Jacobson]]. In his later years, Wedderburn became an increasingly solitary figure and may even have suffered from depression. His isolation after his 1945 early retirement was such that his death from a heart attack was not noticed for several days. His [[Nachlass]] was destroyed, as per his instructions.\n\nWedderburn received the [[MacDougall-Brisbane Gold Medal and Prize]] from the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1921, and was elected to the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1933.<ref name=\"frs\"/>\n\n==Work==\nIn all, Wedderburn published about 40 books and papers, making important advances in the theory of rings, algebras and matrix theory.\n\nIn 1905, Wedderburn published a paper that included three claimed proofs of a theorem stating that a noncommutative [[Finite set|finite]] [[division ring]] could not exist. The proofs all made clever use of the interplay between the [[group scheme|additive group]] of a finite [[division algebra]] ''A'', and the [[multiplicative group]] ''A''* = ''A''-<nowiki/>{0}. Parshall (1983) notes that the first of these three proofs had a gap not noticed at the time. Meanwhile, Wedderburn's Chicago colleague Dickson also found a proof of this result but, believing Wedderburn's first proof to be correct, Dickson acknowledged Wedderburn's priority. But Dickson also noted that Wedderburn constructed his second and third proofs only after having seen Dickson's proof. Parshall concludes that Dickson should be credited with the first correct proof.\n\nA corollary to this theorem yields the complete structure of all finite [[projective geometry]]. In their paper on \"Non-Desarguesian and non-Pascalian geometries\" in the 1907 ''[[Transactions of the American Mathematical Society]]'', Wedderburn and [[Oswald Veblen|Veblen]] showed that in these geometries, [[Pascal's theorem]] is a consequence of [[Desargues' theorem]]. They also constructed finite projective geometries which are neither \"Desarguesian\" nor \"Pascalian\" (the terminology is [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]'s).\n\nWedderburn's best-known paper was his sole-authored \"On hypercomplex numbers,\" published in the 1907 [[Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society]], and for which he was awarded the D.Sc. the following year. This paper gives a complete classification of [[simple algebra|simple]] and [[semisimple algebra]]s. He then showed that every [[semisimple algebra]] finite-dimensional can be constructed as a direct sum of [[simple algebra]]s and that every [[simple algebra]] is [[isomorphic]] to a [[matrix algebra]] for some [[division ring]]. The [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]] generalises this result, with the ascending chain condition.\n\nHis best known book is his ''[http://www.ams.org/online_bks/coll17/ Lectures on Matrices]'' (1934),<ref>{{cite journal|author=MacDuffee, C.

Shortly after his birth, his parents moved the family to [[China]], and he did not return to Europe until he was nine.\n\nAfter his schooling, Witt went to the [[University of Freiburg]] and the [[University of Göttingen]]. He joined the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]](Nazi Party) and was an active party member.<ref>According to Schappacher (letter in Mathematical Intelligencer 1996) it was most certainly him and not [[Oswald Teichmüller]], who attended [[Emmy Noether]]'s private seminar held in her house while wearing his [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-uniform.</ref> Witt completed his [[Ph.D.]] at the University of Göttingen in 1934 with [[Emmy Noether]] and later became a lecturer. He was then a member of a team led by [[Helmut Hasse]]. During [[World War II]] he joined a group of five mathematicians, recruited by [[Wilhelm Fenner]], and which included [[Georg Aumann]], [[Alexander Aigner]], [[Oswald Teichmüller]], [[Johann Friedrich Schultze (mathematician)|Johann Friedrich Schultze]] and their leader professor [[Wolfgang Franz (mathematician)|Wolfgang Franz]], to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of [[Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht]] (abbr. OKW/Chi).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7sNVKDp-yiJNjE4YTIyOTctNGFlZi00NTliLWEwZWUtOGYxYzEyMjk1NGE1/view|title=Army Security Agency: DF-187 The Career of Wilhelm Fenner with Special Regard to his activity in the field of Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (PDF) |page = 7|date=1 December 1949 |website=Google Drive |access-date=30 March 2016}}</ref><ref>TICOM reports DF-187 A-G and DF-176, ‘European Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II’ vol 2</ref>\n\nFrom 1937 until 1979, he taught at the [[University of Hamburg]]. He died in Hamburg in 1991, shortly after his 80th birthday.\n\n==Work==\nWitt's work has been highly influential. His invention of the [[Witt vector]]s clarifies and generalizes the structure of the [[p-adic number]]s. It has become fundamental to [[p-adic Hodge theory]].\n\nWitt was the founder of the theory of [[quadratic forms]] over an arbitrary [[Field (mathematics)|field]]. He proved several of the key results, including the [[Witt's theorem|Witt cancellation theorem]]. He defined the [[Witt group#Ring structure|Witt ring]] of all quadratic forms over a field, now a central object in the theory.\n\nThe [[Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem]] is basic to the study of [[Lie algebra]]s. In [[algebraic geometry]], the [[Hasse–Witt matrix]] of an [[algebraic curve]] over a [[finite field]] determines the cyclic [[étale morphism|étale]] coverings of degree ''p'' of a curve in characteristic ''p''.\n\nIn the 1970s, Witt claimed that in 1940 he had discovered what would eventually be named the \"[[Leech lattice]]\" many years before [[John Leech (mathematician)|John Leech]] discovered it in 1965, but Witt did not publish his discovery and the details of exactly what he did are unclear; see his collected works {{harv|Witt|1998|pp=328–329}}.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of things named after Ernst Witt]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation | last1=Kersten | first1=Ina | title=Ernst Witt 1911-1991 | journal=Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung | volume=95 | year=1993 | pages=166-180 | url=https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/jb_dmv/JB_DMV_095_4.pdf}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Witt | first1=Ernst | author1-link=Ernst Witt | editor1-last=Kersten | editor1-first=Ina | title=Collected papers.

He was an [[Abstract Algebra|algebraist]], [[group (mathematics)|group theorist]], and [[numerical analysis|numerical analyst]]. He is best known for [[Zorn's lemma]], a method used in [[set theory]] that is applicable to a wide range of mathematical constructs such as [[vector space]]s, [[partially ordered set|ordered sets]] and the like. Zorn's lemma was first postulated by [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]] in 1922, and then independently by Zorn in 1935.\n\n==Life and career==\nZorn was born in [[Krefeld]], [[German Empire|Germany]]. He attended the [[University of Hamburg]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in April 1930 for a thesis on [[alternative algebra]]s. He published his findings in ''[[Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg]]''.<ref>M. Zorn (1930) \"Theorie der alternativen Ringen\", ''[[Abhandlungen aus dem Mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg]]'' 8(2): 123–47</ref><ref>M. Zorn (1931) \"Alternativekörper und quadratische Systeme\", ''Abhandlungen aus dem mathematischen Seminar der Universität Hamburg'' 9(3/4): 395–402</ref> Zorn showed that [[split-octonion]]s could be represented by a mixed-style of matrices called [[Split-octonion#Zorn.27s_vector-matrix_algebra|Zorn's vector-matrix algebra]].\n\nMax Zorn was appointed as an assistant at the [[University of Halle]]. However, he did not have the opportunity to work there for long since he was forced to leave Germany in 1933 because of the Nazi policies. According to grandson Eric, \"[Max] spoke with a raspy, airy voice most of his life. Few people knew why, because he only told the story after significant prodding, but he talked that way because pro-Hitler thugs who objected to his politics, had battered his throat in a 1933 street fight.\"<ref>[[Eric Zorn]] (1993) [http://blogs.chicagotribune.com/news_columnists_ezorn/2005/08/year_three_begi.html A Math Wizard, Hero to His Family] from [[Chicago Tribune]]</ref>\n\nZorn emigrated to the [[United States|U.S.]] and was appointed a [[Sterling Fellow]] at [[Yale University]]. While at Yale, Zorn wrote his paper \"A Remark on Method in Transfinite Algebra\"<ref>{{cite journal |first=Max |last=Zorn |title=A remark on method in transfinite algebra |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=41 |year=1935 |issue=10 |pages=667–670 |doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1935-06166-X }}</ref> that stated his Maximum Principle, later called [[Zorn's lemma]]. It requires a set that contains the union of any [[total order#Chain|chain]] of [[subset]]s to have one chain not contained in any other, called the [[maximal element]]. He illustrated the principle with applications in ring theory and field extensions. Zorn’s lemma is an alternative expression of the [[axiom of choice]], and thus a subject of interest in [[axiomatic set theory]].\n\nIn 1936 he moved to [[UCLA]] and remained until 1946. While at UCLA Zorn revisited his study of alternative rings and proved the existence of the [[nilradical of a ring|nilradical]] of certain [[alternative ring]]s.<ref>M. Zorn (1941) Alternative rings and related questions I: existence of the radical, [[Annals of Mathematics]] 42: 676–86 {{mr|id=0005098}}</ref> According to [[Angus E. Taylor]], Max was his most stimulating colleague at UCLA.<ref>[[ Angus E. Taylor]] (1984) A  Life in Mathematics Remembered, [[American Mathematical Monthly]] 91(10):613.</ref>\n\nIn 1946 Zorn became a professor at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] where he taught until retiring in 1971. He was thesis advisor for [[Israel Nathan Herstein]].\n\nZorn died in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]], in March 1993, of congestive heart failure, according to his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite newspaper|author=Saxon, Wolfgang|title=Max A.

Jens (born June 19, 1931) is an emeritus professor of physics at the [[University of Michigan]] and an accomplished sculptor.

There are many hard and fundamental problems in mathematics that can easily be reduced to the problem of finding the number of independent solutions of some differential operator, so if one has some means of finding the index of a differential operator these problems can often be solved. This is what the Atiyah–Singer index theorem does: it gives a formula for the index of certain differential operators, in terms of topological invariants that look quite complicated but are in practice usually straightforward to calculate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nSeveral deep theorems, such as the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], are special cases of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. In fact the index theorem gave a more powerful result, because its proof applied to all compact complex manifolds, while Hirzebruch's proof only worked for projective manifolds. There were also many new applications: a typical one is calculating the dimensions of the moduli spaces of instantons. The index theorem can also be run \"in reverse\": the index is obviously an integer, so the formula for it must also give an integer, which sometimes gives subtle integrality conditions on invariants of manifolds. A typical example of this is [[Rochlin's theorem]], which follows from the index theorem.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=33%\n|quote=The most useful piece of advice I would give to a mathematics student is always to suspect an impressive sounding Theorem if it does not have a special case which is ''both'' simple ''and'' non-trivial.\n|source=Michael Atiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc = paper 17, p. 76}}</ref>\n}}\nThe index problem for [[elliptic differential operator]]s was posed in 1959 by [[Israil Gelfand|Gel'fand]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gel'fand|1960}}</ref> He noticed the homotopy invariance of the index, and asked for a formula for it by means of [[topological invariant]]s.

[[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]] and [[Armand Borel|Borel]] had proved the integrality of the [[Â genus]] of a spin manifold, and Atiyah suggested that this integrality could be explained if it were the index of the [[Dirac operator]] (which was rediscovered by Atiyah and Singer in 1961).\n\nThe first announcement of the Atiyah–Singer theorem was their 1963 paper.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1963}}</ref> The proof sketched in this announcement was inspired by Hirzebruch's proof of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] and was never published by them, though it is described in the book by Palais.<ref>{{harvnb|Palais|1965}}</ref> Their first published proof <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Singer|1968a}}</ref> was more similar to Grothendieck's proof of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]], replacing the [[cobordism]] theory of the first proof with [[K-theory]], and they used this approach to give proofs of various generalizations in a sequence of papers from 1968 to 1971.\n\nInstead of just one elliptic operator, one can consider a family of elliptic operators parameterized by some space ''Y''.

Atiyah used [[Heisuke Hironaka|Hironaka]]'s resolution of singularities to answer this affirmatively. An ingenious and elementary solution was found at about the same time by [[J. Bernstein]], and discussed by Atiyah.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc=paper 15}}</ref>\n\nAs an application of the equivariant index theorem, Atiyah and Hirzebruch showed that manifolds with effective circle actions have vanishing [[Â-genus]].<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988c|loc=paper 74}}</ref> (Lichnerowicz showed that if a manifold has a metric of positive scalar curvature then the Â-genus vanishes.)\n\nWith [[Elmer Rees]], Atiyah studied the problem of the relation between topological and holomorphic vector bundles on projective space.

These conditions can be local (like demanding that the sections in the domain vanish at the boundary) or more complicated global conditions (like requiring that the sections in the domain solve some differential equation). The local case was worked out by Atiyah and Bott, but they showed that many interesting operators (e.g., the [[signature operator]]) do not admit local boundary conditions. To handle these operators, Atiyah, Patodi and Singer introduced global boundary conditions equivalent to attaching a cylinder to the manifold along the boundary and then restricting the domain to those sections that are square integrable along the cylinder, and also introduced the [[Atiyah–Patodi–Singer eta invariant]]. This resulted in a series of papers on spectral asymmetry,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988d|loc=papers 80–83}}</ref> which were later unexpectedly used in theoretical physics, in particular in Witten's work on anomalies.\n\n[[File:Schlierenfoto Mach 1-2 Pfeilflügel - NASA.jpg|thumb|right|The lacunas discussed by Petrovsky, Atiyah, Bott and Gårding are similar to the spaces between shockwaves of a supersonic object.]]\nThe fundamental solutions of linear [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s often have [[Petrovsky lacuna]]s: regions where they vanish identically.

The kernel of the elliptic operator is in general infinite-dimensional in this case, but it is possible to get a finite index using the dimension of a module over a [[von Neumann algebra]]; this index is in general real rather than integer valued. This version is called the ''L<sup>2</sup> index theorem,'' and was used by Atiyah and Schmid<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Schmid|1977}}</ref> to give a geometric construction, using square integrable harmonic spinors, of Harish-Chandra's [[discrete series representation]]s of [[semisimple Lie group]]s.

This often involves finding a subtle correspondence between solutions of two seemingly quite different equations. An early example of this which Atiyah used repeatedly is the [[Penrose transform]], which can sometimes convert solutions of a non-linear equation over some real manifold into solutions of some linear holomorphic equations over a different complex manifold.\n\nIn a series of papers with several authors, Atiyah classified all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. It is more convenient to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 94, 97}}</ref> he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the [[Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem]]). For example, the dimension of the space of SU<sub>2</sub> instantons of rank ''k''>0 is 8''k''−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his [[Donaldson invariant|invariants of 4-manifolds]].\nAtiyah and Ward used the Penrose correspondence to reduce the classification of all instantons on the 4-sphere to a problem in algebraic geometry.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 95}}</ref> With Hitchin he used ideas of Horrocks to solve this problem, giving the [[ADHM construction]] of all instantons on a sphere; Manin and Drinfeld found the same construction at the same time, leading to a joint paper by all four authors.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 96}}</ref> Atiyah reformulated this construction using [[quaternion]]s and wrote up a leisurely account of this classification of instantons on Euclidean space as a book.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 99}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=33%\n|quote=The mathematical problems that have been solved or techniques that have arisen out of physics in the past have been the lifeblood of mathematics.\n|source=Michael Atiyah<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988a|loc = paper 19, p. 13}}</ref>\n}}\nAtiyah's work on instanton moduli spaces was used in Donaldson's work on [[Donaldson theory]]. Donaldson showed that the moduli space of (degree 1) instantons over a compact simply connected [[4-manifold]] with positive definite intersection form can be compactified to give a cobordism between the manifold and a sum of copies of complex projective space. He deduced from this that the intersection form must be a sum of one-dimensional ones, which led to several spectacular applications to smooth 4-manifolds, such as the existence of non-equivalent [[smooth structure]]s on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. Donaldson went on to use the other moduli spaces studied by Atiyah to define [[Donaldson invariant]]s, which revolutionized the study of smooth 4-manifolds, and showed that they were more subtle than smooth manifolds in any other dimension, and also quite different from topological 4-manifolds. Atiyah described some of these results in a survey talk.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 112}}</ref>\n\n[[Green's function]]s for linear partial differential equations can often be found by using the [[Fourier transform]] to convert this into an algebraic problem. Atiyah used a non-linear version of this idea.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 101}}</ref> He used the Penrose transform to convert the Green's function for the conformally invariant Laplacian into a complex analytic object, which turned out to be essentially the diagonal embedding of the Penrose twistor space into its square. This allowed him to find an explicit formula for the conformally invariant Green's function on a 4-manifold.\n\nIn his paper with Jones,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 102}}</ref> he studied the topology of the moduli space of SU(2) instantons over a 4-sphere. They showed that the natural map from this moduli space to the space of all connections induces epimorphisms of [[homology group]]s in a certain range of dimensions, and suggested that it might induce isomorphisms of homology groups in the same range of dimensions. This became known as the [[Atiyah–Jones conjecture]], and was later proved by several mathematicians.<ref>{{harvnb|Boyer|Hurtubise|Mann|Milgram|1993}}</ref>\n\nHarder and [[M. S. Narasimhan]] described the cohomology of the [[moduli space]]s of [[stable vector bundle]]s over [[Riemann surface]]s by counting the number of points of the moduli spaces over finite fields, and then using the Weil conjectures to recover the cohomology over the complex numbers.<ref>{{harvnb|Harder|Narasimhan|1975}}</ref>\nAtiyah and [[R.

Atiyah proved a generalization of this that applies to all compact [[symplectic manifold]]s acted on by a torus, showing that the image of the manifold under the moment map is a convex polyhedron,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 106}}</ref> and with Pressley gave a related generalization to infinite-dimensional loop groups.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 108}}</ref>\n\nDuistermaat and Heckman found a striking formula, saying that the push-forward of the [[Liouville measure]] of a [[moment map]] for a torus action is given exactly by the stationary phase approximation (which is in general just an asymptotic expansion rather than exact). Atiyah and Bott <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 109}}</ref> showed that this could be deduced from a more general formula in [[equivariant cohomology]], which was a consequence of well-known [[localization formula for equivariant cohomology|localization theorem]]s. Atiyah showed<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 110}}</ref> that the moment map was closely related to [[geometric invariant theory]], and this idea was later developed much further by his student [[F. Kirwan]]. Witten shortly after applied the [[Duistermaat–Heckman formula]] to loop spaces and showed that this formally gave the Atiyah–Singer index theorem for the Dirac operator; this idea was lectured on by Atiyah.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 124}}</ref>\n\nWith Hitchin he worked on [[magnetic monopole]]s, and studied their scattering using an idea of [[Nick Manton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 115, 116}}</ref> His book <ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|Hitchin|1988}}</ref> with Hitchin gives a detailed description of their work on magnetic monopoles. The main theme of the book is a study of a moduli space of magnetic monopoles; this has a natural Riemannian metric, and a key point is that this metric is complete and [[hyperkähler]]. The metric is then used to study the scattering of two monopoles, using a suggestion of N. Manton that the geodesic flow on the moduli space is the low energy approximation to the scattering. For example, they show that a head-on collision between two monopoles results in 90-degree scattering, with the direction of scattering depending on the relative phases of the two monopoles. He also studied monopoles on hyperbolic space.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 118}}</ref>\n\nAtiyah showed<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=paper 117}}</ref> that instantons in 4 dimensions can be identified with instantons in 2 dimensions, which are much easier to handle. There is of course a catch: in going from 4 to 2 dimensions the structure group of the gauge theory changes from a finite-dimensional group to an infinite-dimensional loop group. This gives another example where the moduli spaces of solutions of two apparently unrelated nonlinear partial differential equations turn out to be essentially the same.\n\nAtiyah and Singer found that anomalies in quantum field theory could be interpreted in terms of index theory of the Dirac operator;<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1988e|loc=papers 119, 120, 121}}</ref> this idea later became widely used by physicists.\n\n===Later work (1986–2019)===\n[[File:Edward Witten at Harvard.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Witten]], whose work on invariants of manifolds and [[topological quantum field theories]] was influenced by Atiyah]]\nMany of the papers in the 6th volume<ref>{{harvs|nb|first=Michael|last=Atiyah|year1=2004}}</ref> of his collected works are surveys, obituaries, and general talks. Atiyah continued to publish subsequently, including several surveys, a popular book,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2007}}</ref> and another paper with [[Graeme Segal|Segal]] on twisted K-theory.\n\nOne paper<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 127}}</ref> is a detailed study of the [[Dedekind eta function]] from the point of view of topology and the index theorem.\n\nSeveral of his papers from around this time study the connections between quantum field theory, knots, and Donaldson theory. He introduced the concept of a [[topological quantum field theory]], inspired by Witten's work and Segal's definition of a conformal field theory.<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 132}}</ref> His book<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|1990}}</ref> describes the new [[knot invariant]]s found by [[Vaughan Jones]] and [[Edward Witten]] in terms of [[topological quantum field theories]], and his paper with L. Jeffrey<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=paper 139}}</ref> explains Witten's Lagrangian giving the [[Donaldson invariant]]s.\n\nHe studied [[skyrmion]]s with Nick Manton,<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=papers 141, 142}}</ref> finding a relation with magnetic monopoles and [[instanton]]s, and giving a conjecture for the structure of the moduli space of two skyrmions as a certain subquotient of complex projective 3-space.\n\nSeveral papers<ref>{{harvnb|Atiyah|2004|loc=papers 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168}}</ref> were inspired by a question of [https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/persons/jonathan-m-robbins(60101278-f877-4e14-946f-262f3b95d5ae).html Jonathan Robbins] (called the [[Berry–Robbins problem]]), who asked if there is a map from the configuration space of ''n'' points in 3-space to the flag manifold of the unitary group. Atiyah gave an affirmative answer to this question, but felt his solution was too computational and studied a conjecture that would give a more natural solution. He also related the question to [[Nahm's equation]], and introduced the [[Atiyah conjecture on configurations]].\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=33%\n|quote=But for most practical purposes, you just use the classical groups.

One of his significant works was with [[Armand Borel]], now known as the [[Baily–Borel compactification]], which is a [[Compactification (mathematics)|compactification]] of a quotient of a [[Hermitian symmetric space]] by an [[arithmetic group]] (that is, a [[linear algebraic group]] over the rational numbers).<ref>[https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Baily-Borel_compactification Baily-Borel Compactification, Encyclopedia of Mathematics]</ref> Baily and Borel built on the work of [[Ichirō Satake]] and others.\n\nBaily was a winner of the 1952 [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition|Putnam Mathematics Competition]]. He studied at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), receiving a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor of Science]] in [[Mathematics]] in 1952, after which he attended [[Princeton University]], receiving a [[Master's degree|Masters]] in 1953 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Mathematics]] in 1955 under the direction of his thesis advisor [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] (''On the Quotient of a Complex Analytic Manifold by a Discontinuous Group of Complex Analytic Self-Homomorphisms'').<ref>{{MathGenealogy|6509}}</ref> Subsequently, he was an instructor at Princeton and then MIT. In 1957 he worked as a mathematician at [[Bell Labs|Bell Laboratories]]. In 1957, he was appointed [[Assistant professor|Assistant Professor]] and subsequently promoted to [[Professor]] in 1963 at the [[University of Chicago]]. He became a Professor [[Emeritus]] at the University of Chicago in 2005.\n\nHe was a member of the [[American Mathematical Society]] and the [[Mathematical Society of Japan]]. He often visited the [[University of Tokyo]] as a guest of [[Shokichi Iyanaga]] and [[Kunihiko Kodaira]], spoke fluent Japanese and in Tokyo, 1963 married Yaeko Iseki, with whom he had a son. He owned an apartment in Tokyo for many years where he spent his summers.   In addition, he often visited [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] and spoke fluent Russian.  \n\nHe was awarded an [[Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship]] in 1958. In 1962, he was an invited speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] held in [[Stockholm]] (''On the moduli of Abelian varieties with multiplications from an order in a totally real number field'').\n\nHis doctoral students include [[Paul Monsky]], [[Timothy J.

Beilinson''' (born 1957) is the David and Mary Winton Green University [[Professor]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and works on [[mathematics]].  His research  has spanned [[representation theory]], [[algebraic geometry]] and [[mathematical physics]].  In 1999 Beilinson was  awarded the [[Ostrowski Prize]] with [[Helmut Hofer]].\nIn 2017 he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/may-2-2017-NAS-Election.html National Academy of Sciences Members and Foreign Associates Elected], [[National Academy of Sciences]], May 2, 2017.</ref>\n\n==Work==\nIn 1978, Beilinson published a paper on [[coherent sheaves]] and several problems in [[linear algebra]].  His two-page note in the journal ''Functional Analysis and Its Applications'' was one of the papers on the study of [[derived categories]] of coherent [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]].\n\nIn 1981 Beilinson announced a proof of the [[Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures]] and [[Jantzen conjectures]] with [[Joseph Bernstein]].  Independent of Beilinson and Bernstein, [[Jean-Luc Brylinski|Brylinski]] and [[Masaki Kashiwara|Kashiwara]] obtained a proof of the Kazhdan–Lusztig conjectures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Brylinski|first1=Jean-Luc|last2=Kashiwara|first2=Masaki|title=Kazhdan-Lusztig conjecture and holonomic systems|date=October 1981|volume=64|journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]]|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|pages=387–410|issn=0020-9910|doi=10.1007/BF01389272|issue=3|postscript=.}}</ref>  However, the proof of Beilinson–Bernstein introduced a method of [[Localization of a category|localization]].  This established a geometric description of the entire [[category (mathematics)|category]] of representations of the [[Lie algebra]], by \"spreading out\" representations as geometric objects living on the [[flag variety]]. These geometric objects naturally have an [[intrinsic]] notion of [[parallel transport]]: they are [[D-modules]].\n\n[[File:Alexander_Beilinson.jpg|right|400px|thumb|Alexander Beilinson (left) and his students]]\n\nIn 1982 Beilinson published his own conjectures about the existence of [[motivic cohomology]] groups for [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], provided as [[hypercohomology group]]s of a complex of [[abelian groups]] and related to [[algebraic K-theory]] by a [[motivic spectral sequence]], analogous to the [[Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence]] in [[algebraic topology]]. These conjectures have since been dubbed the [[Beilinson-Soulé conjectures]]; they are intertwined with [[Vladimir Voevodsky]]'s program to develop a [[homotopy theory]] for [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]].\n\nIn 1984, Beilinson published the paper ''Higher Regulators and values of L-functions'', in which he related [[higher regulator]]s for K-theory and their relationship to [[L-functions]].  The paper also provided a generalization to [[arithmetic variety|arithmetic varieties]] of the [[Lichtenbaum conjecture]] for [[Algebraic K-theory|K-groups]] of number [[Ring (mathematics)|rings]], the [[Hodge conjecture]], the [[Tate conjecture]] about [[algebraic cycles]], the [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]] about [[elliptic curves]], and [[Bloch's conjecture]] about ''K''<sub>2</sub> of elliptic curves.\n\nBeilinson continued to work on [[algebraic K-theory]] throughout the mid-1980s.  He collaborated with [[Pierre Deligne]] on the developing a [[motive (algebraic geometry)|motivic]] interpretation of [[Don Zagier]]'s [[polylogarithm]] conjectures.\n\nFrom the early 1990s onwards, Beilinson worked with [[Vladimir Drinfeld]] to rebuild the theory of [[vertex algebra]]s.  After some informal circulation, this research was published in 2004 in a form of a monograph on [[chiral algebra]]s. This has led to new advances in [[conformal field theory]], [[string theory]] and the geometric [[Langlands program]].

The Kirchhoff polynomial of ''G'' is a certain homogeneous polynomial whose degree is equal to the first betti number of ''G''. These polynomials appear in the study of electrical circuits and in the evaluation of Feynman amplitudes. Motivated by work of D. Kreimer and D. J. Broadhurst associating multiple zeta values to certain Feynman integrals, Kontsevich conjectured that the number of zeros of a Kirchhoff polynomial over the field with ''q'' elements is always a polynomial function of ''q''. We show that this conjecture is false by relating the schemes defined by Kirchhoff polynomials to the representation spaces of matroids.

Bogomolov worked at the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics|Steklov Institute]] in [[Moscow]] before he became a professor at the [[Courant Institute]] in [[New York City|New York]]. He is most famous for his pioneering work on [[hyperkähler manifold]]s.\n\nBorn in Moscow, Bogomolov graduated from [[Moscow State University]], [[MSU Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics|Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics]], and earned his doctorate (''\"candidate degree\"'') in 1973, at the Steklov Institute. His doctoral advisor was [[Sergei Novikov (mathematician)|Sergei Novikov]].\n\n== Geometry of Kähler manifolds ==\nBogomolov's Ph.D. thesis was entitled ''Compact Kähler varieties''. In his early papers<ref>Bogomolov, F. A. ''Manifolds with trivial canonical class.'' (Russian) Uspekhi Mat. Nauk 28 (1973), no. 6 (174), 193–194. {{MathSciNet | id = 390301}}</ref><ref>Bogomolov, F.

He proved a [[hyperkähler manifold|decomposition theorem]], used for the classification of manifolds with trivial [[canonical class]]. It has been re-proven using the [[Calabi–Yau theorem]] and [[Holonomy|Berger's classification of Riemannian holonomies]], and is foundational for modern [[string theory]].\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s Bogomolov studied the [[deformation theory]] for manifolds with trivial canonical class.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Bogomolov | first=F. A. | year=1978 | title=[Hamiltonian Kählerian manifolds] | language=Russian | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=243 | issue=5 | pages=1101–1104 |mr=514769 }}</ref><ref>Bogomolov, F. A., ''Kähler manifolds with trivial canonical class,'' Preprint Institute des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques 1981 pp. 1–32.</ref> He discovered what is now known as [[Bogomolov–Tian–Todorov theorem]], proving the smoothness and un-obstructedness of the deformation space for hyperkaehler manifolds (in 1978 paper) and then extended this to all Calabi–Yau manifolds in the 1981 IHES preprint. Some years later, this theorem became the mathematical foundation for [[Mirror symmetry (string theory)|Mirror Symmetry]].\n\nWhile studying the deformation theory of hyperkähler manifolds, Bogomolov discovered what is now known as the [[Bogomolov–Beauville–Fujiki form]] on <math>H^2(M)</math>. Studying properties of this form, Bogomolov erroneously concluded that compact hyperkaehler manifolds do not exist, with the exception of [[K3 surface]]s, tori, and their products. Almost four years passed since this publication before [[Akira Fujiki]] found a counterexample.\n\n== Other works in algebraic geometry ==\nBogomolov's paper on \"Holomorphic tensors and vector bundles on projective manifolds\" proves what is now known as the [[Bogomolov–Miyaoka–Yau inequality]], and also proves that a stable bundle on a surface, restricted to a curve of sufficiently big degree, remains stable. In \"Families of curves on a surface of general type\",<ref>{{cite journal| last=Bogomolov | first=F.

In this paper Bogomolov proved that on any [[surface of general type]] with <math>c_1^2>c_2</math>, there is only a finite number of curves of bounded genus.

These are compact complex surfaces with <math>b_2=1</math>. If they are in addition minimal, they are called ''class <math>VII_0</math>''. [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] classified all compact complex surfaces except class VII, which are still not understood, except the case <math>b_{2}=0</math> (Bogomolov) and <math>b_{2}=1</math> (Andrei Teleman, 2005).<ref>Andrei Teleman, ''Donaldson Theory on non-Kählerian surfaces  and class VII surfaces with <math>b_2=1</math>,'' [[Inventiones Mathematicae]] 162, 493–521, 2005. {{MathSciNet | id = 2006i:32020}}</ref>\n\n== Other works in arithmetic geometry ==\n\nBogomolov has contributed to several aspects of arithmetic geometry. He is the author of Bogomolov's conjecture about small points. Twenty years ago he contributed a proof (among many proofs) of the geometric Szpiro conjecture which appears to be the nearest to [[Shinichi Mochizuki]]'s claimed proof of the arithmetic Szpiro conjecture.\n\n== Later career ==\n\nBogomolov obtained his Habilitation (Russian ''\"Dr. of Sciences\"'') in 1983. In 1994, he emigrated to the United States and became a full professor at the Courant Institute. He is very active in algebraic geometry and number theory.  From 2009 till March 2014 he served as the Editor-in-Chief of the [[Open Mathematics|Central European Journal of Mathematics]]. Since 2014 he serves as the Editor-in-Chief of the European Journal of Mathematics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/journal/40879|title=European Journal of Mathematics}}</ref> Since 2010 he is the academic supervisor of the [[HSE Faculty of Mathematics#Notable projects co-implemented by the Faculty|HSE Laboratory of algebraic geometry and its applications]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ag.hse.ru/en/staff | title=Scientific group of the Laboratory}}</ref> Bogomolov has extensively contributed to the revival of Russian mathematics.

He worked in [[algebraic topology]], in the theory of [[Lie group]]s, and was one of the creators of the contemporary theory of [[linear algebraic group]]s.\n\n==Biography==\n\nHe studied at the [[ETH Zürich]], where he came under the influence of the topologist [[Heinz Hopf]] and Lie-group theorist [[Eduard Stiefel]]. He was in Paris from 1949: he applied the Leray [[spectral sequence]] to the topology of Lie groups and their [[classifying space]]s, under the influence of [[Jean Leray]] and [[Henri Cartan]].\n\nHe collaborated with [[Jacques Tits]] in fundamental work on [[algebraic group]]s, and with [[Harish-Chandra]] on their [[arithmetic group|arithmetic subgroups]]. In an algebraic group ''G'' a ''Borel subgroup'' ''H'' is one minimal with respect to the property that the [[homogeneous space]] ''G/H'' is a [[projective variety]]. For example, if ''G'' is GL<sub>''n''</sub> then we can take ''H'' to be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices. In this case it turns out that H is a maximal [[Solvable group|solvable subgroup]], and that the [[Borel subgroup|parabolic subgroups]] ''P'' between ''H'' and ''G'' have a combinatorial structure (in this case the homogeneous spaces ''G/P'' are the various [[flag manifold]]s). Both those aspects generalize, and play a central role in the theory.\n\nThe [[Borel−Moore homology]] theory applies to general [[locally compact space]]s, and is closely related to [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory.\n\nHe published a number of books, including a work on the history of Lie groups. In 1978 he received the [[Brouwer Medal]]<ref>[https://www.ias.edu/news/press-releases/2009-110 Institute for Advanced Study: Armand Borel May 21, 1923 – August 11, 2003]</ref> and in 1992 he was awarded the [[Balzan Prize]] \"For his fundamental contributions to the theory of Lie groups, algebraic groups and arithmetic groups, and for his indefatigable action in favour of high quality in mathematical research and the propagation of new ideas\" (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee).\n\nHe died in Princeton. He used to answer the question of whether he was related to [[Émile Borel]] alternately by saying he was a nephew, and no relation.\n\n== Famous quotations ==\n\"I feel that what mathematics needs least are pundits who issue prescriptions or guidelines for presumably less enlightened mortals.\" (Oeuvres IV, p.&nbsp;452)\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Borel–Weil–Bott theorem]]\n*[[Borel conjecture]]\n*[[Borel fixed-point theorem]]\n*[[Borel's theorem]]\n\n==Publications==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Borel | first1=Armand | author1-link=Armand Borel | title=Seminar on transformation groups | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0691090947 | publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] | series=With contributions by [[Glen Bredon|G.

He then earned a [[Ph.D.]] in mathematics from [[Carnegie Mellon University]] in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1949. His thesis, titled ''Electrical Network Theory'', was written under the direction of Richard Duffin. Afterward, he began teaching at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]].

In 2005 Bott died of [[cancer]] in [[San Diego]].\n\nWith  [[Richard Duffin]] at Carnegie Mellon, Bott studied existence of [[electronic filter]]s corresponding to given  [[positive-real function]]s.  In 1949 they proved<ref>[[John H. Hubbard]] (2010) \"The Bott-Duffin Synthesis of Electrical Circuits\", pp 33 to 40 in ''A Celebration of the Mathematical Legacy of Raoul Bott'', P. Robert Kotiuga editor, CRM Proceedings and Lecture Notes #50, [[American Mathematical Society]]</ref>  a fundamental theorem of [[network synthesis filters|filter synthesis]]. Duffin and Bott extended earlier work by [[Otto Brune]] that requisite functions of [[complex frequency]] ''s'' could be realized by a [[passive filter|passive network]] of [[inductor]]s and [[capacitor]]s. The proof, relying on [[mathematical induction|induction]] on the sum of the [[degree of a polynomial|degrees of the polynomials]] in the numerator and denominator of the rational function, was published in [[Journal of Applied Physics]], volume 20, page 816.\nIn his 2000 interview<ref>Jackson, Allyn, \"Interview with Raoul Bott\", [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] 48 (2001), no. 4, 374–382.</ref> with Allyn Jackson of the [[American Mathematical Society]], he explained that he sees \"networks as discrete versions of harmonic theory\", so his experience with [[network synthesis filters#Driving point impedance|network synthesis]] and [[electronic filter topology]] introduced him to algebraic topology.\n\nBott met [[Arnold S. Shapiro]] at the IAS and they worked together.\nHe studied the [[homotopy theory]] of [[Lie group]]s, using methods from [[Morse theory]], leading to the [[Bott periodicity theorem]] (1957). In the course of this work, he introduced [[Morse–Bott function]]s, an important generalization of [[Morse function]]s.\n\nThis led to his role as collaborator over many years with [[Michael Atiyah]], initially via the part played by periodicity in [[K-theory]]. Bott made important contributions towards the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem|index theorem]], especially in formulating related [[fixed-point theorem]]s, in particular the so-called '[[Woods Hole fixed-point theorem]]', a combination of the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]] and [[Lefschetz fixed-point theorem]] (it is named after [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], the site of a conference at which collective discussion formulated it).<ref>[http://www.whoi.edu/science/MPC/dept/meetings/atiyah_bott_35.html]</ref> {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The major Atiyah–Bott papers on what is now the [[Atiyah–Bott fixed-point theorem]] were written in the years up to 1968; they collaborated further in recovering in contemporary language [[Ivan Petrovsky]] on [[Petrovsky lacuna]]s of [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s, prompted by [[Lars Gårding]]. In the 1980s, Atiyah and Bott investigated [[gauge theory]], using the [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills equations]] on a Riemann surface to obtain topological information about the [[moduli space]]s of stable bundles on Riemann surfaces. In 1983 he spoke to the Canadian Mathematical Society in a talk he called \"A topologist marvels at Physics\".<ref>{{cite journal |author=R.

He is best known for his contributions to the field of [[algebraic geometry]], though his contributions to the study of statistics and [[probability theory]] are also significant.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Guido Castelnuovo3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Guido Castelnuovo]]\nCastelnuovo was born in [[Venice]]. His father, [[Enrico Castelnuovo]], was a [[novelist]] and campaigner for the [[unification of Italy]].\n\nAfter attending a grammar school at {{Interlanguage link|Liceo Foscarini|it}} in Venice, he went to the [[University of Padua]], from where he graduated in 1886. At the [[University of Padua]] he was taught by [[Giuseppe Veronese]]. He also achieved minor fame due to winning the university salsa dancing competition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} After his graduation, he sent one of his papers to [[Corrado Segre]], whose replies he found remarkably helpful. It marked the beginning of a long period of collaboration.\n\n=== Career ===\nCastelnuovo spent one year in [[Rome]] to research advanced geometry. After that he was appointed as an assistant of [[Enrico D'Ovidio]] at the [[University of Turin]], where he was strongly influenced by Corrado Segre. Here he worked with [[Alexander von Brill]] and [[Max Noether]]. In 1891 he moved back to Rome to work at the chair of Analytic and Projective Geometry. Here he was a colleague of [[Luigi Cremona]], his former teacher, and took over his job when the later died in 1903. He also founded the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]'s School of Statistics and Actuarial Sciences (1927). He influenced a younger generation of Italian mathematicians and statisticians, including [[Corrado Gini]] and [[Francesco Paolo Cantelli]].\n\n=== Retirement and World War II ===\nCastelnuovo retired from teaching in 1935. It was a period of great political difficulty in Italy. In 1922 [[Benito Mussolini]] had risen to power and in 1938 a large number of [[antisemitism|anti-semitic]] [[law]]s were declared, which excluded him, like all other Jews, from public work. With the rise of [[Nazism]], he was forced into hiding. However, during [[World War II]], he organised and taught secret courses for Jewish students &mdash; the latter were not allowed to attend university either.\n\n=== Final years and death ===\nAfter the liberation of Rome, Castelnuovo was appointed as a special commissioner of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche]] in June 1944. He was given the task to repair the damage done to Italian scientific institutions by the twenty years of Mussolini's rule. He became president of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] until his death and was elected a member of the [[Académie des Sciences]] in Paris. On 5 December 1949, he became a [[senator for life|life senator]] of the Italian Republic.\n\nCastelnuovo died at the age of 86 on 27 April 1952 in Rome.\n\n== Work ==\nIn [[Turin]] Castelnuovo was strongly influenced by [[Corrado Segre]]. In this period he published high-quality work on [[algebra]]ic [[curve]]s. He also made a major step in reinterpreting the work on [[linear series]] by [[Alexander von Brill]] and [[Max Noether]] ([[Brill–Noether theory]]).\n\nCastelnuovo had his own theory about how Mathematics should be taught. His courses were divided into two: first a general overview of mathematics, and then an in-depth theory of algebraic curves. He has said about this approach:\n{{cquote|...&nbsp;the reason for the division is that on the one hand it is necessary to have general culture, on the other hand it is necessary to have deep knowledge of a particular field.}}\n\nHe also taught courses on [[algebraic function]]s and [[abelian integral]]s. Here, he treated, among other things, [[Riemann surfaces]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]], [[differential geometry]], [[interpolation]] and [[approximation]], and [[probability theory]]. He found the latter the most interesting, because as a relatively recent one, the relationship between the deduction and the empirical contribution was more clear. In 1919, he published ''Calcolo della probabilità e applicazioni,'' an early textbook on the subject. He also wrote a book on [[calculus]], ''Le origini del calcolo infinitesimale nell'era moderna''.\n\nCastelnuovo's most important work was done in the field of [[algebraic geometry]]. In the early 1890s he published three famous papers, including one with the first use of the [[characteristic linear series of a family of curves]]. The [[Castelnuovo–Severi inequality]] was co-named after him. He collaborated with [[Federigo Enriques]] on the theory of surfaces. This collaboration started in 1892 when Enriques was only a student, but grew further over the next 20 years: they submitted their work to the [[Royal Prize in Mathematics]] by the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in 1902, but were not given the prize because they had sent it jointly instead of under one name. Both received the prize in later years.\n\nAnother theorem named partly after Castelnuovo is the [[Kronecker–Castelnuovo theorem]] (1894): ''If the sections of an irreducible [[algebraic surface]], having at most isolated [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]], with a general tangent plane turn out to be [[Reduction (mathematics)|reducible]] curves, then the surface is either [[ruled surface]] and in fact a ''scroll'', or the [[Veronese surface]].''  Kronecker never published it but stated it in a lecture. Castelnuovo proved it. In total, Castelnuovo published over 100 articles, books and memoirs.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Castelnuovo curve]]\n*[[Castelnuovo–Mumford regularity]]\n*[[Castelnuovo theorem]]\n*[[Castelnuovo–de Franchis theorem]]\n*[[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web | title=Guido Castelnuovo | work=University of St. Andrews on Guido Castelnuovo | url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Castelnuovo.html| accessdate=March 3, 2005}}\n* [http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/References/Castelnuovo.html 17 references for further reading] Some in [[English language|English]], most in [[Italian language|Italian]].\n* {{MathGenealogy |id=18925}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQU6AAAAMAAJ|title=Le origini del calcolo infinitesimale nell'era moderna: con scritti di Newton, Leibniz, Torricelli|last=Castelnuovo|first=Guido|date=1962-01-01|publisher=Feltrinelli|language=it}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Castelnuovo, Guido}}\n[[Category:1865 births]]\n[[Category:1952 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometers]]\n[[Category:Italian people of World War II]]\n[[Category:Italian Jews]]\n[[Category:People from Venice]]\n[[Category:Italian Life Senators]]\n[[Category:Italian statisticians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian politicians]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]"

He helped found the modern British school of [[pure mathematics]].\n\nAs a child, Cayley enjoyed solving complex maths problems for amusement. He entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he excelled in [[Greek language|Greek]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Italian language|Italian]], as well as [[mathematics]].  He worked as a [[lawyer]] for 14 years.\n\nHe postulated the [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]]—that every [[square matrix]] is a root of its own [[characteristic polynomial]], and verified it for matrices of order 2 and 3.<ref>See Cayley (1858) \"A Memoir on the Theory of Matrices\", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', '''148''' :  24 : \"I have verified the theorem, in the next simplest case, of a matrix of the order 3, … but I have not thought it necessary to undertake the labour of a formal proof of the theorem in the general case of a matrix of any degree.\"</ref> He was the first to define the concept of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] in the modern way—as a set with a [[Binary function|binary]] operation satisfying certain laws.<ref>Cayley (1854) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_LYConosISUC&pg=PA40#v=onepage&q&f=false \"On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θ<sup>n</sup> = 1,\"] ''Philosophical Magazine'', 4th series, '''7''' (42) : 40–47.  However, see also the criticism of this definition in:  [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Abstract_groups.html MacTutor:  The abstract group concept].</ref> Formerly, when mathematicians spoke of \"groups\", they had meant [[permutation group]]s. [[Cayley table]]s and [[Cayley graph]]s as well as [[Cayley's theorem]] are named in honour of Cayley.\n\n==Early years==\nArthur Cayley was born in [[Richmond, London]], [[England]], on 16 August 1821. His father, Henry Cayley, was a distant cousin of [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]], the [[aeronautics]] engineer innovator, and descended from an ancient [[Yorkshire]] family. He settled in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], as a [[merchant]]. His [[mother]] was Maria Antonia Doughty, daughter of William Doughty. According to some writers she was Russian, but her father's name indicates an English origin. His brother was the linguist [[Charles Bagot Cayley]]. Arthur spent his first eight years in Saint Petersburg. In 1829 his parents were settled permanently at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], near London. Arthur was sent to a private school. At age 14 he was sent to [[King's College School]]. The school's master observed indications of mathematical genius and advised the father to educate his son not for his own business, as he had intended, but to enter the [[University of Cambridge]].\n\n==Education==\nAt the unusually early age of 17 Cayley began residence at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. The cause of the [[Analytical Society]] had now triumphed, and the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' had been instituted by Gregory and [[Robert Leslie Ellis]]. To this journal, at the age of twenty, Cayley contributed three papers, on subjects that had been suggested by reading the ''Mécanique analytique'' of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and some of the works of [[Laplace]].\n\nCayley's tutor at Cambridge was [[George Peacock]] and his private coach was [[William Hopkins]]. He finished his undergraduate course by winning the place of [[Senior Wrangler]], and the first [[Smith's prize]].<ref>{{acad|id=CLY838A|name=Cayley, Arthur}}</ref> His next step was to take the M.A. degree, and win a Fellowship by competitive examination. He continued to reside at Cambridge University for four years; during which time he took some pupils, but his main work was the preparation of 28 memoirs to the '' Mathematical Journal''.\n\n==As a lawyer==\nBecause of the limited tenure of his fellowship it was necessary to choose a profession; like [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]], Cayley chose law, and at age 25 entered at [[Lincoln's Inn, London]]. He made a specialty of [[conveyancing]]. It was while he was a pupil at the [[bar examination]] that he went to [[Dublin]] to hear [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s lectures on [[quaternion]]s.<ref name=\"dnb\">{{cite DNBSupp|wstitle=Cayley, Arthur |first=Andrew Russell|last=Forsyth}}</ref>\n\nHis friend [[James Joseph Sylvester|J. J. Sylvester]], his senior by five years at Cambridge, was then an [[actuary]], resident in London; they used to walk together round the courts of [[Lincoln's Inn]], discussing the [[theory of invariants]] and covariants. During this period of his life, extending over fourteen years, Cayley produced between two and three hundred papers.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n==As a professor==\nAt Cambridge University the ancient professorship of pure mathematics is denominated by the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics|Lucasian]], and is the chair that had been occupied by [[Isaac Newton]]. Around 1860, certain funds bequeathed by Lady Sadleir to the University, having become useless for their original purpose, were employed to establish another professorship of pure mathematics, called the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian]]. The duties of the new professor were defined to be ''\"to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics and to apply himself to the advancement of that science.\"'' To this chair Cayley was elected when 42 years old. He gave up a lucrative practice for a modest salary; but he never regretted the exchange, for the chair at Cambridge enabled him to end the divided allegiance between law and mathematics, and to devote his energies to the pursuit that he liked best. He at once married and settled down in Cambridge. More fortunate than Hamilton in his choice, his home life was one of great happiness. His friend and fellow investigator, Sylvester, once remarked that Cayley had been much more fortunate than himself; that they both lived as bachelors in London, but that Cayley had married and settled down to a quiet and peaceful life at Cambridge; whereas he had never married, and had been fighting the world all his days.\n\nAt first the teaching duty of the Sadleirian professorship was limited to a course of lectures extending over one of the terms of the academic year; but when the University was reformed about 1886, and part of the college funds applied to the better endowment of the University [[professor]]s, the lectures were extended over two terms. For many years the attendance was small, and came almost entirely from those who had finished their career of preparation for competitive examinations; after the reform the attendance numbered about fifteen. The subject lectured on was generally that of the memoir on which the professor was for the time engaged.\n\nThe other duty of the chair — the advancement of mathematical science — was discharged in a handsome manner by the long series of memoirs that he published, ranging over every department of pure mathematics. But it was also discharged in a much less obtrusive way; he became the standing referee on the merits of mathematical papers to many societies both at home and abroad.\n\nIn 1872 he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College, and three years later an ordinary fellow, which meant stipend as well as honour. About this time his friends subscribed for a presentation portrait. [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] wrote an address to the committee of subscribers who had charge of the Cayley portrait fund. The verses refer to the subjects investigated in several of Cayley's most elaborate memoirs; such as, Chapters on the Analytical Geometry of <math>n</math> dimensions; On the theory of [[Determinant]]s; Memoir on the theory of Matrices; Memoirs on skew surfaces, otherwise Scrolls; On the delineation of a Cubic Scroll, etc.<ref>[[s:To the Committee of the Cayley Portrait Fund|\"To the Committee of the Cayley Portrait Fund\"]], 1874</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work on [[algebra]], Cayley made fundamental contributions to [[algebraic geometry]]. Cayley and [[George Salmon|Salmon]] discovered the 27 lines on a [[cubic surface]]. Cayley constructed the [[Chow variety]] of all curves in projective 3-space.<ref>A. Cayley, Collected Mathematical Papers, Cambridge (1891), v. 4, 446−455. W. V. D. Hodge and D. Pedoe, Methods of Algebraic Geometry, Cambridge (1952), v. 2, p. 388.</ref> He founded the algebro-geometric theory of [[ruled surface]]s.\n\nIn 1876 he published a ''Treatise on [[elliptic function|Elliptic Functions]]''. He took great interest in the movement for the University education of women. At Cambridge the women's colleges are Girton and Newnham. In the early days of [[Girton College]] he gave direct help in teaching, and for some years he was chairman of the council of [[Newnham College]], in the progress of which he took the keenest interest to the last.\n\nIn 1881 he received from the [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, where Sylvester was then professor of mathematics, an invitation\nto deliver a course of lectures. He accepted the invitation, and lectured at Baltimore during the first five months of 1882 on the\nsubject of the ''Abelian and Theta Functions''.\n\nIn 1893 Cayley became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004572 |title=A. Cayley (1821 - 1895) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=19 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n==British Association presidency==\n\nIn 1883 Cayley was President of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. The meeting was held at Southport, in the north of England. As the President's address is one of the great popular events of the meeting, and brings out an audience of general culture, it is usually made as little technical as possible. {{harvtxt|Cayley|1996}}  took for his subject the Progress of Pure Mathematics.\n\n==The ''Collected Papers''==\nIn 1889 the [[Cambridge University Press]] requested him to prepare his mathematical papers for publication in a collected form—a request which he appreciated very much. They are printed in [[Bookbinding|quarto volume]]s, of which seven appeared under his own editorship. While editing these volumes, he was suffering from a painful internal malady, to which he succumbed on 26 January 1895, in the 74th year of his age. When the funeral took place, a great assemblage met in Trinity Chapel, comprising members of the University, official representatives of Russia and America, and many of the most illustrious philosophers of [[United Kingdom|Britain]].\n\nThe remainder of his papers were edited by [[Andrew Forsyth]], his successor in the Sadleirian Chair. The Collected Mathematical papers number thirteen quarto volumes, and contain 967 papers.  Cayley retained to the last his fondness for novel-reading and for travelling. He also took special pleasure in paintings and architecture, and he practiced [[Watercolor painting|water-colour painting]], which he found useful sometimes in making mathematical diagrams.\n\n==Legacy==\nCayley is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge|Mill Road cemetery]], Cambridge.\n\nAn 1874 portrait of Cayley by [[Lowes Cato Dickinson]] and an 1884 portrait by [[William Longmaid]] are in the collection of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Trinity College, University of Cambridge|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|publisher=BBC Your Paintings|access-date=12 February 2018|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140511164255/http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/search/located_at/trinity-college-cambridge-5846_locations|archive-date=11 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA number of mathematical terms are named after him:\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cayley's theorem]]\n* [[Cayley–Hamilton theorem]] in [[linear algebra]]\n* [[Cayley–Bacharach theorem]]\n* [[Grassmann–Cayley algebra]]\n* [[Cayley–Menger determinant]]\n* [[Cayley diagram]]s &ndash; used for finding [[cognate linkage]]s in mechanical engineering\n* [[Cayley–Dickson construction]]\n* [[Octonion|Cayley algebra]] (Octonion)\n* [[Cayley graph]]\n* [[Cayley numbers]]\n* [[Cayley's sextic]]\n* [[Cayley table]]\n* [[Cayley–Purser algorithm]]\n* [[Cayley's formula]]\n* [[Cayley–Klein metric]]\n* [[Klein model|Cayley–Klein model]] of [[hyperbolic geometry]]\n* [[Cayley's Ω process]]\n* [[Cayley surface (disambiguation)|Cayley surface]]\n* [[Cayley transform]]\n* [[Cayley's nodal cubic surface]]\n* [[Cayley's ruled cubic surface]]\n* The crater [[Cayley (crater)|Cayley]] on the [[Moon]] (and consequently the Cayley Formation, a geological unit named after the crater)\n* [[Cayley's mousetrap]] — a card game\n* [[Cayleyan]]\n* [[Chasles–Cayley–Brill formula]]\n* [[Quippian]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | title=An elementary treatise on elliptic functions | origyear=1876 | url=https://archive.org/details/anelementarytre01caylgoog | publisher=Cornell University Library | isbn=978-1-112-28006-1 | mr=0124532 | year=2009}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | title=The Collected Mathematical Papers | origyear=1889 | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=ABS3153  | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | series=Cambridge Library Collection – Mathematics | isbn=978-1-108-00507-4 | id=[https://archive.org/search.php?query=The_collected_mathematical_papers_of_Arthur_Cayley archive] | year=2009 | volume=14 volumes}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | title=The principles of book-keeping by double entry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1894|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofbook00caylrich}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of things named after Arthur Cayley]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation | last1=Cayley | first1=Arthur | author1-link=Arthur Cayley | editor1-last=Ewald | editor1-first=William | title=From Kant to Hilbert: a source book in the foundations of mathematics.

He was a founding member of the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group.\n\n==Life==\nHis father, Abel Chevalley, was a French diplomat who, jointly with his wife Marguerite Chevalley née [[Louis Auguste Sabatier|Sabatier]], wrote ''The Concise Oxford French Dictionary''.<ref>Patrick Cabanel 'Chevalley  Daniel Abel & Chevalley Anne Marguerite, née Sabatier', in Patrick Cabanel & André Encrevé, ''Dictionnaire biographique des protestants français de 1787 à nos jours'', 1 : A-C, Paris, Les Éditions de Paris/Max Chaleil, 2015 isbn 978-2-917743-07-2, p.680-681.</ref> Chevalley graduated from the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1929, where he studied under [[Émile Picard]]. He then spent time at the [[University of Hamburg]], studying under [[Emil Artin]], and at the [[University of Marburg]], studying under [[Helmut Hasse]]. In Germany, Chevalley discovered Japanese mathematics in the person of [[Shokichi Iyanaga]]. Chevalley was awarded a doctorate in 1933 from the [[University of Paris]] for a thesis on [[class field theory]].\n\nWhen [[World War II]] broke out, Chevalley was at [[Princeton University]]. After reporting to the French Embassy, he stayed in the USA, first at Princeton then (after 1947) at [[Columbia University]]. His American students included [[Leon Ehrenpreis]] and [[Gerhard Hochschild]]. During his time in the USA, Chevalley became an American citizen and wrote a substantial part of his lifetime output in English.\n\nWhen Chevalley applied for a chair at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], the difficulties he encountered were the subject of a polemical piece by his friend and fellow ''Bourbakiste'' [[André Weil]], titled \"Science Française?\" and published in the ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française|NRF]]''. Chevalley was the \"professeur B\" of the piece, as confirmed in the endnote to the reprint in Weil's collected works, ''Oeuvres Scientifiques, tome II''. Chevalley eventually did obtain a position in 1957 at the faculty of sciences of the [[University of Paris]], and after 1970 at the [[Université de Paris VII]].\n\nChevalley had artistic and political interests, and was a minor member of the French [[non-conformists of the 1930s]]. The following quote by the co-editor of Chevalley's collected works attests to these interests:\n<blockquote>\n\"Chevalley was a member of various avant-garde groups, both in politics and in the arts... Mathematics was the most important part of his life, but he did not draw any boundary between his mathematics and the rest of his life.\"<ref>[[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Cartier, Pierre]] (1984) \"Claude Chevalley,\" ''Notices of the American Mathematical Society 31'': 775.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Work==\nIn his PhD thesis, Chevalley made an important contribution to the technical development of [[class field theory]], removing a use of [[L-function]]s and replacing it by an algebraic method. At that time use of [[group cohomology]] was implicit, cloaked by the language of [[central simple algebra]]s. In the introduction to [[André Weil]]'s ''Basic Number Theory'', Weil attributed the book's adoption of that path to an unpublished manuscript by Chevalley.\n\nAround 1950, Chevalley wrote a three-volume treatment of [[Lie group]]s. A few years later, he published the work for which he is best remembered, his investigation into what are now called [[Chevalley group]]s. Chevalley groups make up 9 of the 18 families of [[finite simple group]]s.\n\nChevalley's accurate discussion of integrality conditions in the [[Lie algebra]]s of [[semisimple group]]s enabled abstracting their theory from the [[Real number|real]] and [[complex field]]s. As a consequence, analogues over [[finite field]]s could be defined. This was an essential stage in the evolving [[classification of finite simple groups]]. After Chevalley's work, the distinction between \"classical groups\" falling into the [[Dynkin diagram]] classification, and [[sporadic groups]] which did not, became sharp enough to be useful. What are called 'twisted' groups of the classical families could be fitted into the picture.\n\n\"Chevalley's theorem\" (also called the [[Chevalley–Warning theorem]]) usually refers to his result on the solubility of equations over a finite field. Another theorem of his concerns the [[Constructible set (topology)|constructible set]]s in [[algebraic geometry]], i.e. those in the [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] generated by the [[Zariski-open]] and [[Zariski-closed]] sets. It states that the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of such a set by a [[morphism]] of [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] is of the same type. Logicians call this an [[elimination of quantifiers]].\n\nIn the 1950s, Chevalley led some Paris seminars (working groups to the English speaking world) of major importance: the ''Séminaire Cartan–Chevalley'' of the academic year 1955/6, with [[Henri Cartan]], and the ''Séminaire Chevalley'' of 1956/7 and 1957/8. These dealt with topics on [[algebraic group]]s and the foundations of algebraic geometry, as well as pure [[abstract algebra]].  The Cartan–Chevalley seminar was the genesis of [[scheme theory]], but its subsequent development in the hands of [[Alexander Grothendieck]] was so rapid, thorough and inclusive that its historical tracks can appear well covered. Grothendieck's work subsumed the more specialised contribution of [[Jean-Pierre Serre|Serre]], Chevalley, [[Goro Shimura]], and others such as [[Erich Kähler]] and [[Masayoshi Nagata]].\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n*1936.

He made several fundamental contributions to mathematics:\n# A fundamental issue in algebraic geometry is intersection theory. The Chow ring has many advantages and is widely used.\n# The Chow associated forms give a description of the moduli space of the algebraic varieties in projective space. It gives a beautiful solution of an important problem.\n# His theorem that a compact analytic variety in a projective space is algebraic is justly famous. The theorem shows the close analogy between algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory.\n# Generalizing a result of Caratheodory on thermodynamics, he formulated a theorem on accessibility of differential spaces. The theorem plays a fundamental role in control theory.\n# A lesser-known paper of his on homogeneous spaces gives a beautiful treatment of the geometry known as the projective geometry of matrices and treated by elaborate calculations. His discussions are valid in a more general context.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor=Chow, Wei-Liang|editor2=Chern, Shiing-Shen|editor3=Shokurov, Vyachesav V.|title=Collected Papers of Wei-Liang Chow|series=The World Scientific Series in 20th Century Mathematics|publisher=World Scientific|year=2002|page=492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AX9qDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA492}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Chow ring]]\n*[[Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry#Chow's theorem|Chow's theorem]]\n*[[Chow's moving lemma]]\n*[[Chow's lemma]]\n*[[Chow-Rashevskii theorem]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MacTutor Biography|id=Chow|title=Wei-Liang Chow}}\n*{{cite journal | last = Wilson | first = W.

His life was devoted to the study of [[geometry]] and reforming advanced [[mathematical teaching]] in Italy. His reputation mainly rests on his ''Introduzione ad una teoria geometrica delle curve piane''. He notably enriched our knowledge of [[algebraic curve]]s and [[algebraic surface]]s.\n\n==Biography==\nLuigi Cremona was born in [[Pavia]] ([[Lombardy]]), then part of the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]]-controlled [[Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia]]. His youngest brother was the painter [[Tranquillo Cremona]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Brigaglia, Aldo|author2=Di Sieno, Simonetta|title=The Luigi Cremona Archive of the Mazzini Institute of Genoa|journal=Historia Mathematica|date=February 2011|volume=38|issue=1|pages=96–110|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2010.03.006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, when [[Milan]] and [[Venice]] rose against Austria, Cremona, then only seventeen, joined the ranks of the Italian volunteers. He remained with them, fighting on behalf of his country's freedom, until, in 1849, the capitulation of [[Venice]] put an end to the campaign.\n\nHe then returned to Pavia, where he pursued his studies at the university under [[Francesco Brioschi]], and determined to seek a career as teacher of mathematics. He graduated in 1853 as ''[[Laurea|dottore negli studi di ingegnere civile e architetto]]''.\n\nCremona is noted for the important role he played in bringing about the great geometrical advances in Italy. While, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Italy had very little mathematical standing, the end of the century found Italy in the lead along geometric lines, largely as a result of the work of Cremona. He was very influential in bringing about reforms in the secondary schools of Italy and became a leader in questions of mathematical pedagogy as well as in those relating to the advancement of knowledge. The mathematical advances which Italy made since the middle of the nineteenth century were largely guided by Cremona, [[Francesco Brioschi|Brioschi]], and [[Eugenio Beltrami|Beltrami]].<ref>George Abram Miller, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e1UuAAAAYAAJ& Historical Introduction to Mathematical Literature]'' The Macmillan Company, 1916</ref> \n\nHis first appointment was as elementary mathematical master at the gymnasium and lyceum of [[Cremona]], and he afterwards obtained a similar post at [[Milan]]. In 1860 he was appointed to the professorship of higher geometry at the [[University of Bologna]], and in 1866 to that of higher geometry and graphical statics at the higher technical college of Milan. In this same year he competed for the [[Steiner Prize]] of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]], with a treatise entitled ''Memoria sulle superfici del terzo ordine'', and shared the award  with [[J. C. F. Sturm]]. Two years later the same prize was conferred on him without competition.\n\nAs early as 1856 Cremona had begun to contribute to the ''Annali di scienze matematiche e fisiche'', and to the ''Annali di matematica'', of which he became afterwards joint editor. Papers by him appeared in the mathematical journals of Italy, France, Germany and England, and he published several important works, many of which have been translated into other languages. His manual ''Graphical [[Statics]]'' and his ''Elements of Projective Geometry'' (translated by [[Thomas Hudson Beare]] and C. Leudesdorf respectively) were published in English by the [[Clarendon Press]].\n\nIn 1873 he was called to Rome to organize the Royal College of Engineering, and was also appointed professor of higher mathematics at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|university]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mat.uniroma1.it/en/node/5588|title=La storia dell'Istituto Matematico Guido Castelnuovo|publisher=[[Sapienza University of Rome|Dipartimento di Matematica, Sapienza Università di Roma]] |accessdate=26 November 2016}}</ref> Cremona's reputation had now become European, and in 1879 he was elected a corresponding member of the [[Royal Society]].<!-- <==inline cite needed.

He is known for work on the [[Weil conjectures]], leading to a complete proof in 1973. He is the winner of the 2013 Abel Prize, 2008 Wolf Prize, 1988 Crafoord Prize, and 1978 Fields Medal.\n\n== Biography ==\nDeligne was born in [[Etterbeek]], attended school at [[Athénée Adolphe Max]] and studied at the [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] (ULB), writing a dissertation titled ''Théorème de Lefschetz et critères de dégénérescence de suites spectrales''. He completed his [[doctorate]] at the [[University of Paris-Sud]] in [[Orsay]] 1972 under the supervision of [[Alexander Grothendieck]], with a thesis titled ''Théorie de Hodge''.  \n\nStarting in 1972, Deligne worked with Grothendieck at the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (IHÉS) near [[Paris]], initially on the generalization within [[scheme theory]] of [[Zariski's main theorem]]. In 1968, he also worked with [[Jean-Pierre Serre]]; their work led to important results on the l-adic representations attached to [[modular form]]s, and the conjectural [[functional equation]]s of [[L-function]]s. Deligne's also focused on topics in [[Hodge theory]]. He introduced [[yoga of weights|weights]] and tested them on objects in [[complex geometry]]. He also collaborated with [[David Mumford]] on a new description of the [[moduli space]]s for curves. Their work came to be seen as an introduction to one form of the theory of [[algebraic stack]]s, and recently has been applied to questions arising from [[string theory]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} Perhaps Deligne's most famous contribution was his proof of the third and last of the [[Weil conjectures]]. This proof completed a programme initiated and largely developed by [[Alexander Grothendieck]]. As a corollary he proved the celebrated [[Ramanujan–Petersson conjecture]] for [[modular form]]s of weight greater than one; weight one was proved in his work with Serre.  Deligne's 1974 paper contains the first proof of the [[Weil conjectures]], Deligne's contribution being to supply the estimate of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] of the [[Frobenius endomorphism]], considered the geometric analogue of the [[Riemann hypothesis]]. Deligne's 1980 paper contains a much more general version of the Riemann hypothesis.\n\nFrom 1970 until 1984, Deligne was a permanent member of the IHÉS staff. During this time he did much important work outside of his work on algebraic geometry. In joint work with [[George Lusztig]], Deligne applied [[étale cohomology]] to construct representations of [[Group of Lie type|finite groups of Lie type]]; with [[Michael Rapoport]], Deligne worked on the moduli spaces from the 'fine' arithmetic point of view, with application to [[modular form]]s. He received a [[Fields Medal]] in 1978. In 1984, Deligne moved to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton.\n\nIn terms of the completion of some of the underlying Grothendieck program of research, he defined [[Hodge cycle|absolute Hodge cycles]], as a surrogate for the missing and still largely conjectural theory of [[motive (mathematics)|motives]]. This idea allows one to get around the lack of knowledge of the [[Hodge conjecture]], for some applications. He reworked the [[Tannakian category]] theory in his 1990 paper for the ''Grothendieck Festschrift'', employing [[Beck's monadicity theorem|Beck's theorem]] – the Tannakian category concept being the categorical expression of the linearity of the theory of motives as the ultimate [[Weil cohomology theory|Weil cohomology]]. All this is part of the ''yoga of weights'', uniting [[Hodge theory]] and the l-adic Galois representations. The [[Shimura variety]] theory is related, by the idea that such varieties should parametrize not just good (arithmetically interesting) families of Hodge structures, but actual motives. This theory is not yet a finished product, and more recent trends have used [[K-theory]] approaches.\n\n== Awards ==\nHe was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1978, the [[Crafoord Prize]] in 1988, the [[Balzan Prize]] in 2004, the [[Wolf Prize]] in 2008, and the [[Abel Prize]] in 2013.\n\nIn 2006 he was ennobled by the Belgian king as [[Belgian nobility#Viscount|viscount]].<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.be/fr/press/homedetails.asp?TEXTID=55693 Official announcement ennoblement] - Belgian Federal Public Service. 2006-07-18  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030023029/http://www.diplomatie.be/fr/press/homedetails.asp?TEXTID=55693 |date=30 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Deligne was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.kva.se/KVA_Root/eng/_press/detail.asp?NewsId=1134 Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: Many new members elected to the Academy], press release on 12 February 2009 {{dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40116|title=Gruppe 1: Matematiske fag|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Deligne\n | first = Pierre\n | url = http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1974__43__273_0\n | title = La conjecture de Weil: I\n | journal = Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS\n | volume = 43\n | year = 1974\n | pages = 273–307\n | doi=10.1007/bf02684373\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Deligne\n | first = Pierre\n | url = http://www.numdam.org/item?id=PMIHES_1980__52__137_0\n | title = La conjecture de Weil : II\n | journal = Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS\n | volume = 52\n | year = 1980\n | pages = 137–252\n | doi=10.1007/BF02684780\n}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Deligne\n | first = Pierre\n | url = https://publications.ias.edu/deligne/paper/406\n | title = Catégories tannakiennes\n | journal = Grothendieck Festschrift vol II.

His work on the [[classical group]]s (the book ''La Géométrie des groupes classiques'' was published in 1955), and on [[formal group]]s, introducing what now are called [[Dieudonné module]]s, had a major effect on those fields.\n\nHe was born and brought up in [[Lille]], with a formative stay in [[England]] where he was introduced to [[algebra]]. In 1924 he was admitted to the [[École Normale Supérieure]], where [[André Weil]] was a classmate.<ref>[[André Weil|Weil, André]] (1992). The apprenticeship of a mathematician. Springer.</ref> He began working, conventionally enough, in [[complex analysis]]. In 1934 he was one of the group of ''normaliens'' convened by Weil, which would become '[[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]]'.\n\n== Education and teaching ==\nHe served in the [[French Army]] during [[World War II]], and then taught in [[Clermont-Ferrand]] until the liberation of France. After holding professorships at the [[University of São Paulo]] (1946–47), the [[University of Nancy]] (1948–1952) and the [[University of Michigan]] (1952–53), he joined the Department of Mathematics at [[Northwestern University]] in 1953, before returning to France as a founding member of the [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]]. He moved to the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis|University of Nice]] to found the Department of Mathematics in 1964, and retired in 1970. He was elected as a member of the [[Académie des Sciences]] in 1968.\n\n== Career ==\nDieudonné drafted much of the Bourbaki series of texts, the many volumes of the [[Éléments de géométrie algébrique|EGA]] [[algebraic geometry]] series, and nine volumes of his own [[Éléments d'Analyse]]. The first volume of the ''Traité'' is a French version of the book ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' (1960), which had become a graduate textbook on functional analysis.\n\nHe also wrote individual monographs on ''Infinitesimal Calculus'', ''Linear Algebra and Elementary Geometry'', [[invariant theory]], [[commutative algebra]], [[algebraic geometry]], and formal groups.\n\nWith [[Laurent Schwartz]] he supervised the early research of [[Alexander Grothendieck]].

Still a postgraduate student, Donaldson proved in 1982 a result that would establish his fame. He published the result in a paper \"Self-dual connections and the topology of smooth 4-manifolds\" which appeared in 1983. In the words of Atiyah, the paper \"stunned the mathematical world.\"<ref name=\"Atiyah 1986\">{{cite journal |last=Atiyah |first=M. |author-link = Michael Atiyah |lastauthoramp=yes |title = On the work of Simon Donaldson |journal =[[Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians]] |year=1986 }}</ref>\n\nWhereas [[Michael Freedman]] classified topological four-manifolds, Donaldson's work focused on four-manifolds admitting a [[differentiable structure]], using [[instantons]], a particular solution to the equations of [[Yang–Mills]] [[gauge theory]] which has its origin in [[quantum field theory]]. One of Donaldson's first results gave severe restrictions on the [[Intersection form (4-manifold)|intersection form]] of a smooth four-manifold. As a consequence, a large class of the topological four-manifolds do not admit any [[smooth structure]] at all. Donaldson also derived polynomial invariants from [[gauge theory]]. These were new topological invariants sensitive to the underlying smooth structure of the four-manifold. They made it possible to deduce the existence of \"exotic\" smooth structures—certain topological four-manifolds could carry an infinite family of different smooth structures.\n\nAfter gaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree from [[Oxford University]] in 1983, Donaldson was appointed a Junior Research Fellow at [[All Souls College, Oxford]], he spent the academic year 1983–84 at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], and returned to [[Oxford University|Oxford]] as [[Wallis Professor of Mathematics]] in 1985.

This result is sometimes called [[Donaldson's theorem]].\n* A smooth [[h-cobordism]] between simply connected 4-manifolds need not be trivial {{harv|Donaldson|1987b}}. This contrasts with the situation in higher dimensions.\n* A stable [[holomorphic vector bundle]] over a non-singular projective [[algebraic variety]]  admits a [[Hermitian–Einstein metric]] {{harv|Donaldson|1987c}}.<ref>Another proof of a somewhat more general result was given by {{cite journal |last1=Uhlenbeck |first1=Karen |author1-link = Karen Uhlenbeck |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Yau |first2=Shing-Tung |author2-link = Shing-Tung Yau |title = On the existence of Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections in stable vector bundles |journal=[[Comm.

This was an early application of the [[Donaldson invariant]] (or [[instanton]] invariants).\n* Any compact symplectic manifold admits a symplectic [[Lefschetz pencil]] {{harv|Donaldson|1999}}.\n\nDonaldson's recent work centers on a problem in complex differential geometry concerning a conjectural relationship between algebro-geometric \"stability\" conditions for smooth projective varieties and the existence of \"extremal\" [[Kähler manifold|Kähler metrics]], typically those with constant [[scalar curvature]] (see for example [[cscK metric]]). Donaldson obtained results in the toric case of the problem (see for example {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2001}}). He then solved the Kähler-Einstein case of the problem in 2012, in collaboration with Chen and Sun. This latest spectacular achievement involved a number of difficult and technical papers. The first of these was the paper of {{harvtxt|Donaldson|Sun|2014}} on Gromov-Hausdorff limits. The summary of the existence proof for Kähler-Einstein metrics appears in {{harvtxt|Chen|Donaldson|Sun|2014}}. Full details of the proofs appear in {{harvs|txt|last1=Chen|last2=Donaldson|last3=Sun|year1=2015a|year2=2015b|year3=2015c}}.\n\n=== Conjecture on Fano manifolds and Veblen Prize ===\nIn 2019, Donaldson was awarded the [[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]], together with [[Xiuxiong Chen]] and [[Song Sun]], for proving a long-standing conjecture on [[Fano manifolds]], which states \"that a Fano manifold admits a [[Kähler-Einstein metric]] if and only if it is K-stable\". It had been one of the most actively investigated topics in geometry since its proposal in the 1980s by [[Shing-Tung Yau]] after he proved the [[Calabi conjecture]]. It was later generalized by [[Gang Tian]] and Donaldson. The solution by Chen, Donaldson and Sun was published in the ''[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]'' in 2015 as a three-article series, \"Kähler–Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, I, II and III\".<ref name=veblen>{{cite web |url = http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=4705 |title=2019 Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry to Xiuxiong Chen, Simon Donaldson, and Song Sun |date=2018-11-19 |website=American Mathematical Society |access-date=2019-04-09 }}</ref>\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Donaldson |first=Simon K. |title=An application of gauge theory to four-dimensional topology |journal=[[J.

In 1969, at the age of 15, Drinfeld represented the [[Soviet Union]] at the [[International Mathematics Olympiad]] in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], and won a gold medal with the full score of 40 points. He was, at the time, the [[List of International Mathematical Olympiad participants#Exceptionally young participants|youngest participant to achieve a perfect score]], and has since only been surpassed by [[Sergei Konyagin]] (1972) and [[Noam Elkies]] (1981). Drinfeld entered [[Moscow State University]] in the same year and graduated from it in 1974. Drinfeld was awarded the [[Candidate of Sciences]] degree in 1978 and the [[Doctor of Sciences]] degree from the [[Steklov Institute of Mathematics]] in 1988. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1990. From 1981 till 1999 he worked at the [[Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering]] (Department of Mathematical Physics). Drinfeld moved to the [[United States]] in 1999 and has been working at the [[University of Chicago]] since January 1999.\n\n== Contributions to mathematics ==\nIn 1974, at the age of twenty, Drinfeld announced a proof of the [[Langlands conjectures]] for [[General linear group|GL<sub>2</sub>]] over a [[global field]] of positive characteristic. In the course of proving the conjectures, Drinfeld introduced a new class of objects that he called \"elliptic modules\" (now known as [[Drinfeld module]]s). Later, in 1983, Drinfeld published a short article that expanded the scope of the Langlands conjectures. The Langlands conjectures, when published in 1967, could be seen as a sort of [[non-abelian class field theory]]. It postulated the existence of a natural one-to-one correspondence between [[Galois representations]] and some [[automorphic form]]s. The \"naturalness\" is guaranteed by the essential coincidence of [[L-functions]]. However, this condition is purely arithmetic and cannot be considered for a general one-dimensional function field  in a straightforward way. Drinfeld pointed out that instead of automorphic forms one can consider automorphic [[perverse sheaves]] or automorphic [[D-module]]s. \"Automorphicity\" of these modules and the Langlands correspondence could be then understood in terms of the action of [[Hecke operators]].\n\nDrinfeld has also done much work in [[mathematical physics]]. In collaboration with his advisor [[Yuri I. Manin|Yuri Manin]], he constructed the [[moduli space]] of [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] [[instantons]], a result that was proved independently by [[Michael Atiyah]] and [[Nigel Hitchin]]. Drinfeld coined the term \"[[quantum group]]\" in reference to [[Hopf algebra]]s that are deformations of [[simple Lie algebra]]s, and connected them to the study of the [[Yang–Baxter equation]], which is a necessary condition for the solvability of statistical mechanical models. He also generalized Hopf algebras to [[quasi-Hopf algebra]]s and introduced the study of [[Drinfeld twist]]s, which can be used to factorize the [[R-matrix]] corresponding to the solution of the Yang–Baxter equation associated with a [[quasitriangular Hopf algebra]].\n\nDrinfeld has also collaborated with [[Alexander Beilinson]] to rebuild the theory of [[vertex algebras]] in a coordinate-free form, which have become increasingly important to [[two-dimensional conformal field theory]], [[string theory]], and the  [[geometric Langlands program]].  Drinfeld and Beilinson published their work in 2004 in a book titled \"[[Chiral Algebras]].\"\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Drinfeld reciprocity]]\n*[[Drinfeld upper half plane]]\n*[[Manin–Drinfeld theorem]]\n*[[Quantum group]]\n*[[Chiral algebra]]\n*[[Quasitriangular Hopf algebra]]\n*[[Ruziewicz problem]]\n*\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id=Drinfeld}}\n* [[Victor Ginzburg]], Preface to the special volume of ''Transformation Groups'' (vol 10, 3–4, December 2005, Birkhäuser) on occasion of Vladimir Drinfeld's 50th birthday, pp 277–278, {{doi|10.1007/s00031-005-0400-6}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041127062730/http://www.icm2002.org.cn/general/prize/medal/1990/Drinfeld/ Report by Manin]\n\n== External links ==\n* {{MathGenealogy |id=20646}}\n* {{IMO results |id=10169 }}\n* [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~mitya/langlands/ Langlands Seminar homepage]\n\n{{Fields medalists}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Drinfeld, Vladimir}}\n[[Category:1954 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:21st-century mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Moscow State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Fields Medalists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometers]]\n[[Category:Number theorists]]\n[[Category:Soviet mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian Jews]]\n[[Category:People from Kharkiv]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:International Mathematical Olympiad participants]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago faculty]]\n[[Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences]]\n[[Category:Jewish Ukrainian mathematicians]]"

      "text": "'''Patrick du Val''' (March 26, 1903 &ndash; January 22, 1987) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[mathematician]], known for his work on [[algebraic geometry]], [[differential geometry]], and [[general relativity]]. The concept of [[Du Val singularity]] of an [[algebraic surface]] is named after him. \n\n==Early life==\nDu Val was born in [[Cheadle Hulme]], [[Cheshire]]. He was the son of a [[cabinet maker]], but his parents' marriage broke up. As a child, he suffered ill-health, in particular [[asthma]], and was educated mostly by his mother. He was awarded a first class honours degree from the [[University of London External Programme]] in 1926, which he took by correspondence course.\n\nHe was a talented linguist, for example teaching himself [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] so that he might read [[Peer Gynt]]. He also had a strong interest in history but his love of mathematics led him to pursue that as a career.  His earliest publications show a leaning towards applied mathematics. \n\nHis mother moved to a village near [[Cambridge]] and he became acquainted with [[H. F. Baker|Henry Baker]], [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]]. Baker turned his interest towards [[algebraic geometry]], and he entered [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1927.\n\n==Research in geometry==\nDu Val's early work before becoming a research student was on relativity, including a paper on the [[De Sitter space|De Sitter model]] of the universe and [[Grassmann]]'s tensor calculus.  His doctorate was on algebraic geometry and in his thesis he generalised a result of [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]]. He worked on [[algebraic surfaces]] and later in his career became interested in [[elliptic functions]].\n\nHe received his [[Ph.D.]] with a thesis entitled 'On Certain Configurations of Algebraic Geometry Having Groups of Self-Transformations Representable by Symmetry Groups of Certain Polygons' under Baker's supervision in 1930. While a research student he had many famous geometers including [[W. V. D. Hodge|Hodge]] as fellow research students,  and he formed a particular friendship with [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|Coxeter]] and [[John Greenlees Semple|Semple]].  He was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1930 for four years. During that time he travelled extensively, visiting [[Rome]] and working with [[Federigo Enriques]], then in 1934 [[Princeton University]], where he attended lectures by [[James Waddell Alexander II|James W. Alexander]], [[Luther P. Eisenhart]], [[Solomon Lefschetz]], [[Oswald Veblen]], [[Joseph Wedderburn]], and [[Hermann Weyl]]. \n\nIn 1936, Du Val took up an assistant lectureship in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester]], where he stayed for five years.  He was then funded by a [[British Council]] scheme to go to [[Istanbul University]] as a professor of pure mathematics. There he learnt [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and even wrote a book on coordinate geometry in that language.\n\nAfter a spell in the [[United States]] at the [[University of Georgia]], he returned to the [[United Kingdom]], first taking up a post in [[Bristol]], then at the [[University College London]] in 1954, where he remained until he retired in 1970. Together with Semple he led the London Geometry Seminar during the time he spent in London.\n\nPatrick Du Val had three children Nicholas, Paula and Belinda and 10 grandchildren. His oldest daughter is also a PhD and is married to the current Professor of Ecclesiastical History at the university of Wales Lampeter.\n\n==Later life==\nAfter retirement, Du Val returned to Istanbul.  For three years he held the same post as before, and then as if reversing history, settled down to a retirement in Cambridge.\n\nHe is remembered as an interesting character. For example, in Manchester during the war he was remembered as a cloaked figure striding the parapets, as he carried out his duties as a fire warden. He was also known for startling the travelling public by carrying around a large string bag filled with garishly coloured [[Great icosahedron|stellated icosahedra]].\n\n==Work==\n*{{citation|first= Patrick|last= Du Val|title=On isolated singularities of surfaces which do not affect the conditions of adjunction.

He became a student of [[Guido Castelnuovo]] (who later became his brother in law), and became an important member of the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. He also worked on [[differential geometry]]. He collaborated with Castelnuovo, [[Corrado Segre]] and [[Francesco Severi]]. He had positions at the [[University of Bologna]], and then the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]]. He lost his position in 1938, when the [[Fascist]] government enacted the \"leggi razziali\" (racial laws), which in particular banned Jews from holding professorships in Universities.\n\nThe Enriques classification, of complex [[algebraic surface]]s up to birational equivalence, was into five main classes, and was background to further work until [[Kunihiko Kodaira]] reconsidered the matter in the 1950s.  The largest class, in some sense, was that of [[surface of general type|surfaces of general type]]: those for which the consideration of [[differential form]]s provides [[linear system]]s that are large enough to make all the geometry visible. The work of the Italian school had provided enough insight to recognise the other main birational classes. [[Rational surface]]s and more generally [[ruled surface]]s (these include [[quadric]]s and [[cubic surface]]s in projective 3-space) have the simplest geometry. [[Quartic surface]]s in 3-spaces are now classified (when [[non-singular]]) as cases of [[K3 surface]]s; the classical approach was to look at the [[Kummer surface]]s, which are singular at 16 points.  [[Abelian surface]]s give rise to Kummer surfaces as quotients. There remains the class of [[elliptic surface]]s, which are [[fiber bundle]]s over a curve with [[elliptic curve]]s as fiber, having a finite number of modifications (so there is a bundle that is [[locally trivial]] actually over a curve less some points). The question of classification is to show that any surface, lying in [[projective space]] of any dimension, is in the birational sense (after [[blowing up]] and [[blowing down]] of some curves, that is) accounted for by the models already mentioned.\n\nNo more than other work in the Italian school would the proofs by Enriques now be counted as complete and [[rigorous]]. Not enough was known about some of the technical issues: the geometers worked by a mixture of inspired guesswork and close familiarity with examples. [[Oscar Zariski]] started to work in the 1930s on a more refined theory of birational mappings, incorporating [[commutative algebra]] methods. He also began work on the question of the classification for [[characteristic p]], where new phenomena arise.  The schools of Kunihiko Kodaira and [[Igor Shafarevich]] had put Enriques' work on a sound footing by about 1960.\n\n== Works ==\n* Enriques F.

He was, however, able to play a dominant role in mathematics for around a decade, gathering a strong school.<ref name=\"artist\">{{cite book |title=The Artist and the Mathematician |author=Amir D.

Collaborators on the SGA projects also included [[Michael Artin]] ([[étale cohomology]]) and [[Nick Katz]] ([[monodromy theory]] and [[Lefschetz pencil]]s). [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]] worked out [[torsor]] theory extensions of [[nonabelian cohomology]]. Many others were involved.\n\n===\"Golden Age\"===\nAlexander Grothendieck's work during the \"Golden Age\" period at the IHÉS established several unifying themes in [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[topology]], [[category theory]] and [[complex analysis]].<ref name=\"Festschrift\"/> His first (pre-IHÉS) discovery in algebraic geometry was the [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]], a generalisation of the [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] proved algebraically; in this context he also introduced [[K-theory]]. Then, following the programme he outlined in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]], he introduced the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], developing it in detail in his ''[[Éléments de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''EGA'') and providing the new more flexible and general foundations for algebraic geometry that has been adopted in the field since that time.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/> He went on to introduce the [[étale cohomology]] theory of schemes, providing the key tools for proving the [[Weil conjectures]], as well as [[crystalline cohomology]] and [[algebraic de Rham cohomology]] to complement it. Closely linked to these cohomology theories, he originated [[topos]] theory as a generalisation of topology (relevant also in [[categorical logic]]). He also provided an algebraic definition of [[fundamental group]]s of schemes and more generally the main structures of a categorical [[Galois theory]]. As a framework for his [[coherent duality]] theory he also introduced [[derived category|derived categories]], which were further developed by Verdier.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Notes on derived categories and Grothendieck duality |first=Joseph|last=Lipman|authorlink=Joseph Lipman |title=Foundations of Grothendieck Duality for Diagrams of Schemes |series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics|volume=1960 |pages= 1–259|publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |date=2009|mr=2490557 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-85420-3 |url=http://www.math.purdue.edu/~lipman/Duality.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe results of work on these and other topics were published in the ''EGA'' and in less polished form in the notes of the ''[[Séminaire de géométrie algébrique]]'' (''SGA'') that he directed at the IHÉS.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\n===Political activism===\nGrothendieck's political views were [[Political radicalism|radical]] and [[pacifist]], and he strongly opposed both United States [[Vietnam War|intervention in Vietnam]] and [[Soviet Empire|Soviet military expansionism]]. He gave lectures on [[category theory]] in the forests surrounding [[Hanoi]] while the city was being bombed, to protest against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>''The Life and Work of Alexander Grothendieck'', ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', vol. 113, no. 9, footnote 6.</ref> He retired from scientific life around 1970, having found out that IHÉS was partly funded by the military.<ref>SGA1, Springer Lecture Notes 224, {{pp.|xii, xiii}}</ref> He returned to academia a few years later as a professor at the [[University of Montpellier]].\n\nWhile the issue of military funding was perhaps the most obvious explanation for Grothendieck's departure from the IHÉS, those who knew him say that the causes of the rupture ran deeper. [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], a ''visiteur de longue durée'' (\"long-term guest\") at the IHÉS, wrote a piece about Grothendieck for a special volume published on the occasion of the [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf IHÉS's fortieth anniversary]. The ''Grothendieck Festschrift'', published in 1990, was a three-volume collection of research papers to mark his sixtieth birthday in 1988.<ref>The editors were [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Luc Illusie]], [[Nick Katz]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[Yuri Manin]], and [[Ken Ribet]]. A second edition has been printed (2007) by Birkhauser.</ref>\n\nIn it, Cartier notes that as the son of an antimilitary anarchist and one who grew up among the disenfranchised, Grothendieck always had a deep compassion for the poor and the downtrodden. As Cartier puts it, Grothendieck came to find [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] \"''une cage dorée''\" (\"a gilded cage\"). While Grothendieck was at the IHÉS, opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] was heating up, and Cartier suggests that this also reinforced Grothendieck's distaste at having become a mandarin of the scientific world.{{sfn|Cartier|2004}} In addition, after several years at the IHÉS, Grothendieck seemed to cast about for new intellectual interests. By the late 1960s, he had started to become interested in scientific areas outside mathematics. [[David Ruelle]], a physicist who joined the IHÉS faculty in 1964, said that Grothendieck came to talk to him a few times about [[physics]].<ref group=\"n\">Ruelle<!--not Lorenz?--> invented the concept of a [[strange attractor]] in a [[dynamical system]] and, with the Dutch mathematician [[Floris Takens]], produced a new model for [[turbulence]] during the 1970s.</ref> [[Biology]] interested Grothendieck much more than physics, and he organized some seminars on biological topics.<ref>Allyn Jackson, [http://www.ams.org/notices/199903/ihes-changes.pdf The IHÉS at Forty], Notices of the AMS, March 1999, pp.&nbsp;329–337.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Grothendieck, with two other mathematicians, [[Claude Chevalley]] and [[Pierre Samuel]], created a political group called ''Survivre''—the name later changed to ''Survivre et vivre''. The group published a bulletin and was dedicated to antimilitary and ecological issues, and also developed strong criticism of the indiscriminate use of science and technology.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} Grothendieck devoted the next three years to this group and served as the main editor of its bulletin.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}\n\nAfter leaving the IHÉS, Grothendieck became a [[temporary professor]] at [[Collège de France]] for two years.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} He then became a professor at the University of Montpellier, where he became increasingly estranged from the mathematical community. His mathematical career, for the most part, ended when he left the IHÉS.<ref name=\"nytob\"/> He formally retired in 1988, a few years after having accepted a research position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique|CNRS]].{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}}\n\n===Manuscripts written in the 1980s===\nWhile not publishing mathematical research in conventional ways during the 1980s, he produced several influential manuscripts with limited distribution, with both mathematical and biographical content.\n\nProduced during 1980 and 1981, ''La Longue Marche à travers la théorie de Galois'' (''The Long March Through Galois Theory'') is a 1600-page handwritten manuscript containing many of the ideas that led to the ''[[Esquisse d'un programme]]''.<ref name=\"esquissefr\">Alexandre Grothendieck, [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquissefr.pdf Esquisse d'un Programme], [http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/esquisseeng.pdf English translation]</ref> It also includes a study of [[Teichmüller space|Teichmüller theory]].\n\nIn 1983, stimulated by correspondence with [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] and Tim Porter at  [[Bangor University]], Grothendieck wrote a 600-page manuscript titled ''[[Pursuing Stacks]]'', starting with a letter addressed to [[Daniel Quillen]]. This letter and successive parts were distributed from Bangor (see [[#External links|External links]] below). Within these, in an informal, diary-like manner, Grothendieck explained and developed his ideas on the relationship between [[algebraic homotopy theory]] and [[algebraic geometry]] and prospects for a noncommutative theory of [[Stack (mathematics)|stack]]s. The manuscript, which is being edited for publication by G. Maltsiniotis, later led to another of his monumental works, ''Les Dérivateurs''. Written in 1991, this latter opus of about 2000 pages further developed the homotopical ideas begun in ''Pursuing Stacks''.<ref name=\"jackson2\"/> Much of this work anticipated the subsequent development of the motivic homotopy theory of [[Fabien Morel]] and [[Vladimir Voevodsky]] in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1984, Grothendieck wrote the proposal ''[[Esquisse d'un Programme]]''<ref name=\"esquissefr\"/> (\"Sketch of a Programme\") for a position at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS). It describes new ideas for studying the [[moduli space]] of complex curves. Although Grothendieck himself never published his work in this area, the proposal inspired other mathematicians' work by becoming the source of [[dessin d'enfant]] theory and [[Anabelian geometry]]. It was later published in the two-volume [https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlf1j2XmXkcC&dq=Geometric+Galois+Actions&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=q9iN4QMkYj&sig=fAsvVlPOhN9K9LfjGFJC5zm_IA4&hl=en&ei=KW-3ScSkHYHIMuDukOEK&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result ''Geometric Galois Actions''] (Cambridge University Press, 1997).\n\nDuring this period, Grothendieck also gave his consent to publishing some of his drafts for EGA on [[Theorem of Bertini|Bertini-type theorem]]s (''EGA''&nbsp;V, published in Ulam Quarterly in 1992-1993 and later made available on the [http://www.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/index.php Grothendieck Circle] web site in 2004).\n\nIn the 1,000-page autobiographical manuscript ''Récoltes et semailles'' (1986) Grothendieck describes his approach to mathematics and his experiences in the mathematical community, a community that initially accepted him in an open and welcoming manner but which he progressively perceived to be governed by competition and status.

He wrote that established mathematicians like himself had no need for additional financial support and criticized what he saw as the declining ethics of the scientific community, characterized by outright scientific theft that, according to him, had become commonplace and tolerated. The letter also expressed his belief that totally unforeseen events before the end of the century would lead to an unprecedented collapse of civilization. Grothendieck added however that his views are \"in no way meant as a criticism of the Royal Academy's aims in the administration of its funds\" and added \"I regret the inconvenience that my refusal to accept the Crafoord prize may have caused you and the Royal Academy.\"<ref name=columbia>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |title=Crafoord Prize letter, English translation |accessdate=2005-06-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106062005/http://www.math.columbia.edu/~lipyan/CrafoordPrize.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=dmy}}</ref>\n\n''La Clef des Songes'', a 315-page manuscript written in 1987, is Grothendieck's account of how his consideration of the source of dreams led him to conclude that [[Existence of God|God exists]].<ref>Scharlau 2008, p.&nbsp;940.</ref> As part of the notes to this manuscript, Grothendieck described the life and work of '''18 \"mutants\"''', people whom he admired as visionaries far ahead of their time and heralding a new age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Scharlau|first=Winfried|date=|title=Who Is Alexander Grothendieck?|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/200808/tx080800930p.pdf|journal=Notices of the AMS|volume=55|pages=930–941|via=}}</ref> The only mathematician on his list was [[Bernhard Riemann]].<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Scharlau\n | first = Winfried\n | title = Die Mutanten – Les Mutants – eine Meditation von Alexander Grothendieck \n | language = German\n | url = http://www.scharlau-online.de/DOKS/Die%20Mutanten.pdf\n}}</ref> Influenced by the Catholic mystic [[Marthe Robin]] who was claimed to survive on the Holy Eucharist alone, Grothendieck almost starved himself to death in 1988.{{sfn|Scharlau|2008}} His growing preoccupation with spiritual matters was also evident in a letter titled ''Lettre de la Bonne Nouvelle'' sent to 250 friends in January 1990.

In 1938, aged ten, he moved to France as a refugee. Records of his nationality were destroyed in the fall of Germany in 1945 and he did not apply for French citizenship after the war.

Between 1949 and 1953 he worked on his doctoral thesis in this subject at [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], supervised by [[Jean Dieudonné]] and [[Laurent Schwartz]]. His key contributions include [[topological tensor product]]s of [[topological vector space]]s, the theory of [[nuclear space]]s as foundational for [[Schwartz distribution]]s, and the application of [[Lp space|L<sup>p</sup> spaces]] in studying linear maps between topological vector spaces. In a few years, he had turned himself into a leading authority on this area of functional analysis—to the extent that Dieudonné compares his impact in this field to that of [[Stefan Banach|Banach]].<ref>{{harv|Dieudonné|1990}}</ref>\n\nIt is, however, in [[algebraic geometry]] and related fields where Grothendieck did his most important and influential work. From about 1955 he started to work on [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaf]] theory and [[homological algebra]], producing the influential \"[[Tôhoku paper]]\" (''Sur quelques points d'algèbre homologique'', published in the [[Tohoku Mathematical Journal]] in 1957) where he introduced [[Abelian category|abelian categories]] and applied their theory to show that [[sheaf cohomology]] can be defined as certain [[derived functor]]s in this context.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\nHomological methods and sheaf theory had already been introduced in algebraic geometry by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and others, after sheaves had been defined by [[Jean Leray]]. Grothendieck took them to a higher level of abstraction and turned them into a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the ''[[Grothendieck's relative point of view|relative point of view]]'' (pairs of varieties related by a [[morphism]]), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a [[coherent sheaf]] on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the [[higher direct image]]s of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.\n\nIn 1956, he applied the same thinking to the [[Riemann–Roch theorem]], which had already recently been generalized to any dimension by [[Friedrich Hirzebruch|Hirzebruch]]. The [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] was announced by Grothendieck at the initial [[Mathematische Arbeitstagung]] in [[Bonn]], in 1957.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} It appeared in print in a paper written by [[Armand Borel]] with Serre. This result was his first work in algebraic geometry. He went on to plan and execute a programme for rebuilding the foundations of algebraic geometry, which were then in a state of flux and under discussion in [[Claude Chevalley]]'s seminar; he outlined his programme in his talk at the 1958 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]].\n\nHis foundational work on algebraic geometry is at a higher level of abstraction than all prior versions. He adapted the use of non-closed [[generic point]]s, which led to the theory of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]]. He also pioneered the systematic use of [[nilpotent]]s. As 'functions' these can take only the value 0, but they carry [[infinitesimal]] information, in purely algebraic settings. His ''theory of schemes'' has become established as the best universal foundation for this field, because of its expressiveness as well as technical depth. In that setting one can use [[birational geometry]], techniques from [[number theory]], [[Galois theory]] and [[commutative algebra]], and close analogues of the methods of [[algebraic topology]], all in an integrated way.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/><ref>See, for example, {{harv|Deligne|1998}}.</ref><ref name=\"Mclarty\">{{cite web |last=Mclarty |first=Colin |title=The Rising Sea: Grothendieck on simplicity and generality I |url=http://people.math.jussieu.fr/~leila/grothendieckcircle/mclarty1.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=13 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nHe is also noted for his mastery of abstract approaches to mathematics and his perfectionism in matters of formulation and presentation.<ref name=\"artist\"/> Relatively little of his work after 1960 was published by the conventional route of the [[learned journal]], circulating initially in duplicated volumes of seminar notes; his influence was to a considerable extent personal.

The collection ''[[Fondements de la Géometrie Algébrique]]'' (''FGA''), which gathers together talks given in the [[Séminaire Bourbaki]], also contains important material.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\nGrothendieck's work includes the invention of the [[Étale cohomology|étale]] and [[l-adic cohomology]] theories, which explain an observation of [[André Weil]]'s that there is a connection between the topological characteristics of a variety and its diophantine (number theoretic) properties.{{sfn|Pragacz|2005}} For example, the number of solutions of an equation over a [[finite field]] reflects the topological nature of its solutions over the [[complex number]]s. Weil realized that to prove such a connection one needed a new cohomology theory, but neither he nor any other expert saw how to do this until such a theory was found by Grothendieck.\n\nThis program culminated in the proofs of the [[Weil conjectures]], the last of which was settled by Grothendieck's student [[Pierre Deligne]] in the early 1970s after Grothendieck had largely withdrawn from mathematics.<ref name=\"jackson1\"/>\n\n===Major mathematical contributions===\nIn Grothendieck's retrospective ''Récoltes et Semailles'', he identified twelve of his contributions which he believed qualified as \"great ideas\".{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=21}}  In chronological order, they are:\n# [[Topological tensor product]]s and [[nuclear space]]s.\n# \"Continuous\" and \"discrete\" [[Duality (mathematics)|duality]] ([[derived category|derived categories]], \"[[six operations (mathematics)|six operations]]\").\n# Yoga of the [[Grothendieck–Riemann–Roch theorem]] ([[K-theory]], relation with [[intersection theory]]).\n# [[Scheme (mathematics)|Scheme]]s.\n# [[Topos|Topoi]].\n# [[Étale cohomology]] and [[l-adic cohomology]].\n# [[Motive (mathematics)|Motive]]s and the [[motivic Galois group]] (Grothendieck ⊗-categories).\n# Crystals and [[crystalline cohomology]], yoga of \"de Rham coefficients\", \"Hodge coefficients\", ...\n# \"Topological algebra\": ∞-stacks, [[derivator]]s; cohomological formalism of topoi as inspiration for a new [[homotopical algebra]].\n# [[Tame topology]].\n# Yoga of [[anabelian geometry|anabelian algebraic geometry]], [[Galois–Teichmüller theory]].\n# \"Schematic\" or \"arithmetic\" point of view for [[regular polyhedron|regular polyhedra]] and regular configurations of all kinds.\n\nHere the term ''yoga'' denotes a kind of \"meta-theory\" that can be used heuristically; [[Michel Raynaud]] writes the other terms \"Ariadne's thread\" and \"philosophy\" as effective equivalents.<ref>[http://www.ams.org/notices/200309/rev-raynaud.pdf, at p.&nbsp;2.]</ref>\n\nGrothendieck wrote that, of these themes, the largest in scope was topoi, as they synthesized algebraic geometry, topology, and arithmetic.  The theme that had been most extensively developed was schemes, which were the framework \"''par excellence''\" for eight of the other themes (all but 1, 5, and 12).  Grothendieck wrote that the first and last themes, topological tensor products and regular configurations, were of more modest size than the others.  Topological tensor products had played the role of a tool rather than a source of inspiration for further developments; but he expected that regular configurations could not be exhausted within the lifetime of a mathematician who devoted himself to it.  He believed that the deepest themes were motives, anabelian geometry, and Galois–Teichmüller theory.{{sfn|Grothendieck|1986|p=22}}\n\n== Influence ==\nGrothendieck is considered by many to be the greatest mathematician of the 20th century.<ref name=obit/>  In an obituary [[David Mumford]] and [[John Tate]] wrote:\n<blockquote>Although mathematics became more and more abstract and general throughout the 20th century, it was Alexander Grothendieck who was the greatest master of this trend.

Algebraic geometry has traditionally meant the understanding of geometric objects, such as [[algebraic curve]]s and surfaces, through the study of the algebraic equations for those objects. Properties of algebraic equations are in turn studied using the techniques of [[ring theory]]. In this approach, the properties of a geometric object are related to the properties of an associated ring. The space (e.g., real, complex, or projective) in which the object is defined is extrinsic to the object, while the ring is intrinsic.\n\nGrothendieck laid a new foundation for algebraic geometry by making intrinsic spaces (\"spectra\") and associated rings the primary objects of study. To that end he developed the theory of [[Scheme (mathematics)|schemes]], which can be informally thought of as [[topological space]]s on which a [[commutative ring]] is associated to every open subset of the space. Schemes have become the basic objects of study for practitioners of modern algebraic geometry. Their use as a foundation allowed geometry to absorb technical advances from other fields.<ref>{{cite book|author=Miles Reid|title=Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KvKdSkPwwmMC&pg=PA115|date=15 December 1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-35662-6|page=115}}</ref>\n\nHis [[Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem|generalization]] of the classical [[Riemann-Roch theorem]] related topological properties of complex [[algebraic curve]]s to their algebraic structure.

As part of this project, his creation of [[topos theory]], a category-theoretic generalization of [[point-set topology]], has influenced the fields of [[set theory]] and [[mathematical logic]].<ref name=M&M />\n\nThe [[Weil conjectures]] were formulated in the later 1940s as a set of mathematical problems in [[arithmetic geometry]]. They describe properties of analytic invariants, called [[local zeta function]]s, of the number of points on an algebraic curve or variety of higher dimension.  Grothendieck's discovery of the [[étale cohomology|ℓ-adic étale cohomology]], the first example of a [[Weil cohomology]] theory, opened the way for a proof of the Weil conjectures, ultimately completed in the 1970s by his student [[Pierre Deligne]].<ref name=\"Hartshorne AG\"/> Grothendieck's large-scale approach has been called a \"visionary program.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=M.

He graduated in mathematics in 1880 at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]], where he was a student of [[Luigi Cremona]]. His doctoral thesis was presented at the [[Reims]] scientific congress and then published with the title \"On a class of surfaces representable point by point on a plane\" in the\n\"Comptes-rendus de l'Association française pour l'avancement des sciences\". In 1887 the French journal [[Comptes Rendus]] published his article \"Theorem on the singular points of an algebraic surface\".<ref>Giovanni Guccia (24 October 1887) [https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3061j/f741.image.r=Guccia,%20Giovanni Théorème sur les pointes singuliar des surfaces algébrique], [[Comptes Rendus]] 1887, second semestre pages 741,2,3 via [[Gallica]], the national library of France</ref>\n\nIn 1889, having applied for a chair, he was appointed full professor of [[Algebraic geometry|geometry]] at the [[University of Palermo]], a position which he held for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1884 he founded, personally contributing both financially and intellectually, the \"[[Circolo Matematico di Palermo]]\" (Mathematical Society of Palermo). The Circolo produced a [[scientific journal|journal]] called ''Rendiconti del Circolo di Palermo'' that attracted quality manuscripts from mathematicians. Michele Gebbia (1854-1929), Giovanni Maisano (1851-1929), Michele Luigi Albeggiani (1852-1943) and Francesco Paolo Paternò (1852-1927) were instrumental in assisting Guccia in bringing the ''Rendiconti'' to press.\n\nGuccia was the Mathematical Society's director and essence until his death.\n\nHis scientific work consists of about 50 papers on [[algebraic geometry]], in particular [[Cremona group|Cremona transformations]], classification of curves and projective properties of curves.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MathGenealogy |id=43282}}\n* {{MacTutor Biography|id= Guccia}}\n*[http://mathematica.sns.it/autori/1027/ An Italian short biography of Giovanni Battista Guccia] in ''Edizione Nazionale Mathematica Italiana'' online.\n\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guccia, Giovanni Battista}}\n[[Category:1855 births]]\n[[Category:1914 deaths]]\n[[Category:Algebraic geometers]]\n[[Category:19th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Sapienza University of Rome]]\n[[Category:University of Palermo]]\n[[Category:Italian mathematicians]]"

After one year at [[Princeton University]] 1955–56, he was made a professor at the [[University of Bonn]], where he remained, becoming director of the ''[[Max-Planck-Institut für Mathematik]]'' in 1981.  \nMore than 300 people gathered in celebration of his 80th birthday in Bonn in 2007.\n\nThe [[Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem]] (1954) for [[complex manifolds]] was a major advance and quickly became part of the mainstream developments around the classical [[Riemann–Roch theorem]]; \nit was also a precursor of the [[Atiyah–Singer index theorem]]. \nHirzebruch's book ''Neue topologische Methoden in der algebraischen Geometrie'' (1956) was a basic text for the 'new methods' of [[sheaf theory]], in [[complex algebraic geometry]]. \nHe went on to write the foundational papers on topological [[K-theory]] with [[Michael Atiyah]], and collaborate with [[Armand Borel]] on the theory of [[characteristic class]]es.  In his later work he provided a detailed theory of [[Hilbert modular surface]]s, working with [[Don Zagier]].\n\nIn March 1945, Hirzebruch became a soldier, and in April, in the last weeks of Hitler's rule, he was taken prisoner by the British forces then invading Germany from the west.  When a British soldier found that he was studying mathematics, he drove him home and released him, and told him to continue studying.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093533/http://pyrrho.wsc.ma.edu/math/faculty/fleron/quotes/viewquote.asp?letter=h</ref>\n\nHirzebruch died at the age of 84 on 27 May 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/|title=With great sadness we mourn the death of our founder, Friedrich Hirzebruch, who passed away on Sunday, May 27|work=Max Planck Institute for Mathematics}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/ Max Planck Institute Announcement], [[Max Planck Institute for Mathematics]].

With help from [[E. T. Whittaker]], whose son [[J. M. Whittaker]] was a college friend, he then took the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]]. At Cambridge he fell under the influence of the geometer [[H. F. Baker]]. He gained a second MA in 1925.\n\nIn 1926 he took up a teaching position at the [[University of Bristol]], and began work on the interface between the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]], particularly problems posed by [[Francesco Severi]], and the topological methods of [[Solomon Lefschetz]]. This made his reputation, but led to some initial scepticism on the part of Lefschetz. According to Atiyah's memoir, Lefschetz and Hodge in 1931 had a meeting in [[Max Newman]]'s rooms in Cambridge, to try to resolve issues. In the end Lefschetz was convinced.<ref name=\"frs\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Atiyah | first1 = M.

He spent a year 1931–2 at [[Princeton University]], where Lefschetz was, visiting also [[Oscar Zariski]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. At this time he was also assimilating [[de Rham's theorem]], and defining the [[Hodge star]] operation. It would allow him to define [[harmonic form]]s and so refine the de Rham theory.\n\nOn his return to Cambridge, he was offered a University Lecturer position in 1933. He became the [[Lowndean Professor]] of Astronomy and Geometry at [[Cambridge]], a position he held from 1936 to 1970. He was the first head of [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|DPMMS]].\n\nHe was the Master of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]] from 1958 to 1970, and vice-president of the [[Royal Society]] from 1959 to 1965.  He was knighted in 1959. Amongst other honours, he received the [[Adams Prize]] in 1937 and the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1974.\n\nHe died in [[Cambridge]] on 7 July 1975.\n\n==Work==\nThe [[Hodge index theorem]] was a result on the [[intersection number]] theory for curves on an [[algebraic surface]]: it determines the [[metric signature|signature]] of the corresponding [[quadratic form]].

This starts with the existence for any [[Kähler metric]] of a theory of [[Laplacian]]s – it applies to an [[algebraic variety]] V (assumed complex, projective and non-singular) because [[projective space]] itself carries such a metric. In [[de Rham cohomology]] terms, a cohomology class of degree ''k'' is represented by a ''k''-form α on V('''C'''). There is no unique representative; but by introducing the idea of ''harmonic form'' (Hodge still called them 'integrals'), which are solutions of [[Laplace's equation]], one can get unique α. This has the important, immediate consequence of splitting up\n\n:''H''<sup>''k''</sup>(V('''C'''), '''C''')\n\ninto subspaces\n\n:''H''<sup>''p'',''q''</sup>\n\naccording to the number ''p'' of [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] differentials ''dz<sup>i</sup>'' wedged to make up α (the cotangent space being spanned by the ''dz<sup>i</sup>'' and their complex conjugates). The dimensions of the subspaces are the [[Hodge number]]s.\n\nThis ''Hodge decomposition'' has become a fundamental tool. Not only do the dimensions h<sup>''p'',''q''</sup> refine the [[Betti number]]s, by breaking them into parts with identifiable geometric meaning; but the decomposition itself, as a varying 'flag' in a complex vector space, has a meaning in relation with [[moduli problem]]s. In broad terms, Hodge theory contributes both to the discrete and the continuous classification of algebraic varieties.\n\nFurther developments by others led in particular to an idea of [[mixed Hodge structure]] on singular varieties, and to deep analogies with [[étale cohomology]].\n\n==Hodge conjecture==\n\nThe [[Hodge conjecture]] on the 'middle' spaces H<sup>''p'',''p''</sup> is still unsolved, in general. It is one of the seven [[Millennium Prize Problems]] set up by the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]].\n\n==Exposition==\nHodge also wrote, with [[Daniel Pedoe]], a three-volume work ''Methods of Algebraic Geometry'', on classical algebraic geometry, with much concrete content – illustrating though what [[Élie Cartan]] called 'the debauch of indices' in its component notation. According to [[Michael Atiyah|Atiyah]], this was intended to update and replace [[H. F. Baker]]'s ''Principles of Geometry''.\n\n==Family==\nIn 1929 he married Kathleen Anne Cameron.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | last1=Hodge | first1=W.
