The [[philosopher]] [[Simone Weil]] was his sister.<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil}}</ref><ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Weil_family|class=HistTopics|title=Weil family}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nAndré Weil was born in [[Paris]] to [[agnosticism|agnostic]] [[Alsatian Jew]]ish parents who fled the annexation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] by the [[German Empire]] after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870–71. The famous philosopher [[Simone Weil]] was Weil's only sibling. He studied in Paris, [[Rome]] and [[Göttingen]] and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]]. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at [[Aligarh Muslim University]]. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in [[Hinduism]] and [[Sanskrit literature]]: he taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.<ref name =\"Aczel\">Amir D. Aczel,[https://books.google.com/books?id=fRCH-at7wgYC&pg=PA25 ''The Artist and the Mathematician,''] Basic Books, 2009 pp.17ff.,p.25.</ref><ref>[http://www.math.sunysb.edu/~aknapp/BorelOnWeil.pdf  Borel, Armand]</ref> After teaching for one year in [[Aix-Marseille University]], he taught for six years in [[Strasbourg]]. He married Éveline in 1937.\n\nWeil was in [[Finland]] when [[World War II]] broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the [[Winter War]] on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.<ref>Osmo Pekonen: ''L'affaire Weil à Helsinki en 1939'', Gazette des mathématiciens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13—20. With an afterword by André Weil.</ref> Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at [[Le Havre]] in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then [[Rouen]]. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. After the [[fall of France]], he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to [[Clermont-Ferrand]], where he managed to join his wife Éveline, who had been living in German-occupied France.\n\nIn January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from [[Marseille]] to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]]. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at [[Lehigh University]], where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would never talk about \"Lehigh\" any more.{{citation needed|date=May 2015|http://www.landsburg.com/weil.htm=}} He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the [[Universidade de São Paulo]] from  1945 to 1947, where he worked with [[Oscar Zariski]]. He then returned to the United States and taught at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians|ICM]] in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,<ref>Weil, André.

This began in his doctoral work leading to the [[Mordell–Weil theorem]] (1928, and shortly applied in [[Siegel's theorem on integral points]]).<ref>A. Weil, ''L'arithmétique sur les courbes algébriques'', Acta Math 52, (1929) p.&nbsp;281-315, reprinted in vol 1 of his collected papers {{isbn|0-387-90330-5}}\n.</ref> [[Mordell's theorem]] had an ''ad hoc'' proof;<ref>L.J.

Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.\n\nAmong his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the [[Weil conjectures|Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions]] of curves over finite fields,<ref>{{Citation | last1=Weil | first1=André | author1-link=André Weil | title=Numbers of solutions of equations in finite fields | url=http://www.ams.org/bull/1949-55-05/S0002-9904-1949-09219-4/home.html | doi=10.1090/S0002-9904-1949-09219-4  | mr=0029393 | year=1949 | journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] | issn=0002-9904 | volume=55 | pages=497–508 | issue=5}} Reprinted in Oeuvres Scientifiques/Collected Papers by André Weil {{isbn|0-387-90330-5}}</ref> and his subsequent laying of proper [[foundations for algebraic geometry]] to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively).

Eventually the adelic approach became basic in [[automorphic representation]] theory. He picked up another credited ''Weil conjecture'', around 1967, which later under pressure from [[Serge Lang]] (resp. of Serre) became known as the [[Taniyama–Shimura conjecture]] (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.<ref>Lang, S. \"Some History of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture.\" Not.

His work on [[sheaf theory]] hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with [[Henri Cartan]] in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also created the [[null sign|∅]].\n\nHe discovered that the so-called [[Weil representation]], previously introduced in [[quantum mechanics]] by [[Irving Segal]] and Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of [[quadratic form]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |first=A. |last=Weil |title=Sur certains groupes d'opérateurs unitaires  |language=fr|journal=Acta Math. |volume=111 |year=1964 |pages=143–211 |doi=10.1007/BF02391012}}</ref> This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting [[representation theory]] and [[theta function]]s.\n\nHe also wrote several books on the history of Number Theory.

Since 2015 he is staying as a guest at the [[University of Zurich]]. In the academic year 2017/18 he was Senior Research Fellow at the [[Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies | Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS)]].\n\nSince 1980 Gisbert Wüstholz has close connections to a number of universities in Asia: he stayed for a couple of months each at [[Kyushu University]] at Fukuoka (1992), the Morningside Center of Mathematics of the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]] at Beijing, at the [[Hong Kong University of Science and Technology | Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)]] (1996, 1997, 2006, 2010) and at the [[University of Hong Kong | University of Hong Kong (HKU)]] (1999, 2011, 2012). Several visits took him to the Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics (VIASM) (2010, 2017), to the [[Korea Institute for Advanced Study | Korea Institute for Advanced Study (KIAS)]] and to the [[National Taiwan University]] at Taipei (2009, 2013, 2016).\n\nIn 1986 Gisbert Wüstholz delivered an invited address at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians | International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM)]] in Berkeley, in 1992 the Mordell Lecture in Cambridge, in 2001 the 13th Kuwait foundation lecture, an invited lecture at the Leonhard Euler Festival in St. Petersburg in 2007 on the occasion of the celebration of [[Leonhard Euler]]’s 300th birthday and the Academy Lecture at [[Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] in 2008.\n\nHis research interests are [[Algebraic Geometry]] and [[Number Theory]] (in particular [[Diophantine Approximation]] and [[Transcendental number theory|Transcendence Theory]]) and [[Hodge theory|Hodge Theory]] (Periods). Highlights of his scientific work are his famous [[Analytic subgroup theorem|Analytic Subgroup Theorem]] (1989)<ref>{{cite journal | last=Wüstholz | first=Gisbert | journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]] |series=Second Series | year=1989 | language=de | trans-title=Algebraic points on analytic subgroups of algebraic groups | title=Algebraische Punkte auf analytischen Untergruppen algebraischer Gruppen | volume=129 | number=3 | pages=501–517 | doi=10.2307/1971515 | mr=997311}}</ref> which bases on the Multiplicity Estimates on Group Varieties which he published in 1989, his proof of the abelian analogue of the famous Lindemann’s theorem (wrongly called Lindermann-Weierstrass Theorem), the result which disproved the squaring of the circle, the joint work with [[Gerd Faltings]] on the Schmidt's Subspace Theorem, the Isogeny Estimates for Abelian varieties proved jointly with [[David Masser]] which furnishes an alternative approach to the Mordell conjecture and the joint work with [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] on [[Baker's theorem|linear forms in logarithms]].

      "text": "'''John Radford Young''' (born April 1799 in [[Southwark]]–died 5 March 1885 in [[Peckham]]) was an English mathematician, professor and author, who was almost entirely self-educated. He was born of humble parents in London. At an early age he became acquainted with [[Olinthus Gregory|Olinthus Gilbert Gregory]], who perceived his mathematical ability and assisted him in his studies. In 1823, while working in a private establishment for the deaf, he published ''An Elementary Treatise on Algebra'' with a dedication to Gregory. This treatise was followed by a series of elementary works, in which, following in the steps of [[Robert Woodhouse]], Young familiarized English students with continental methods of [[mathematical analysis]].\n\nIn 1833, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Belfast College. When [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's College, Belfast]], opened in 1849, the presbyterian party in control there prevented Young's reappointment as Professor in the new establishment. From that time he devoted himself more completely to the study of mathematical analysis, and made several original discoveries.\n\nIn 1847, he published in the ''Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society'' a paper \"On the Principle of Continuity in reference to certain Results of Analysis\", and, in 1848, in the ''Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy'' a paper \"On an Extension of a Theorem of Euler\". As early as 1844, he had discovered and published a proof of [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] rule for determining the number of imaginary roots in an equation. In 1866, he completed his proof, publishing in ''The Philosophical Magazine'' a demonstration of a principle which in his earlier paper he had assumed as axiomatic. In 1868, he contributed to the ''Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy'' a memoir \"On the Imaginary Roots of Numerical Equations\".\n\nYoung died at [[Peckham]] on 5 March 1885. He was married and had at least two sons and four daughters.<ref>\nE. I. Carlyle, rev.

He left Kiev in 1920 to study at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] where he became a disciple of the [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]], studying with [[Guido Castelnuovo]], [[Federigo Enriques]] and [[Francesco Severi]].\n\nZariski wrote a doctoral dissertation in 1924 on a topic in [[Galois theory]], which was proposed to him by Castelnuovo. At the time of his dissertation publication, he changed his name to Oscar Zariski.\n\n==Johns Hopkins University years==\nZariski emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1927 supported by [[Solomon Lefschetz]]. He had a position at [[Johns Hopkins University]] where he became professor in 1937. During this period, he wrote ''Algebraic Surfaces'' as a summation of the work of the Italian school.\nThe book was published in 1935 and reissued 36 years later, with detailed notes by Zariski's students that illustrated how the field of algebraic geometry had changed. It is still an important reference.\n\nIt seems to have been this work that set the seal of Zariski's discontent with the approach of the Italians to [[birational geometry]]. He addressed the question of rigour by recourse to [[commutative algebra]]. The [[Zariski topology]], as it was later known, is adequate for ''biregular geometry'', where varieties are mapped by polynomial functions. That theory is too limited for algebraic surfaces, and even for curves with singular points. A rational map is to a regular map as a [[rational function]] is to a polynomial: it may be indeterminate at some points. In geometric terms, one has to work with functions defined on some open, [[Dense set|dense]] set of a given variety. The description of the behaviour on the complement may require [[infinitely near points]] to be introduced to account for limiting behaviour ''along different directions''. This introduces a need, in the surface case, to use also [[Valuation (algebra)|valuation theory]] to describe the phenomena such as [[blowing up]] (balloon-style, rather than explosively).\n\n==Harvard University years==\nAfter spending a year 1946–1947 at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], Zariski became professor at [[Harvard University]] in 1947 where he remained until his retirement in 1969. In 1945, he fruitfully discussed foundational matters for algebraic geometry with [[André Weil]]. Weil's interest was in putting an abstract variety theory in place, to support the use of the [[Jacobian variety]] in his proof of the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]], a direction rather oblique to Zariski's interests. The two sets of foundations weren't reconciled at that point.\n\nAt Harvard, Zariski's students included [[Shreeram Abhyankar]], [[Heisuke Hironaka]], [[David Mumford]], [[Michael Artin]] and [[Steven Kleiman]]—thus spanning the main areas of advance in [[singularity theory]], [[moduli theory]] and [[cohomology]] in the next generation. Zariski himself worked on equisingularity theory. Some of his major results, [[Zariski's main theorem]] and the [[Zariski theorem on holomorphic functions]], were amongst the results generalized and included in the programme of [[Alexander Grothendieck]] that ultimately unified algebraic geometry.\n\nZariski proposed the first example of a [[Zariski surface]] in 1958.\n\n==Views==\nZariski was a [[Jewish atheist]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Unreal Life of Oscar Zariski|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387094298|author=Carol Parikh|page=5|quote=And yet it did, even though since moving into the boarding house he had become an atheist and most of his friends, including his best friend, were Russians.}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nZariski was awarded the [[Steele Prize]] in 1981, and in the same year the [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] with [[Lars Ahlfors]]. He wrote also ''Commutative Algebra'' in two volumes, with [[Pierre Samuel]]. His papers have been published by [[MIT Press]], in four volumes.\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | last1=Zariski | first1=Oscar | author1-link=Oscar Zariski | editor1-last=Abhyankar | editor1-first=Shreeram S. | editor1-link=Shreeram Shankar Abhyankar| editor2-last=Lipman | editor2-first=Joseph | editor2-link=Joseph Lipman| editor3-last=Mumford | editor3-first=David | editor3-link=David Mumford | title=Algebraic surfaces | origyear=1935 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d6Zzhm9eCmgC | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=second supplemented | series=Classics in mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-58658-6 | year=2004 | mr=0469915}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Lefschetz, Solomon|authorlink=Solomon Lefschetz|title=Review: ''Algebraic Surfaces'', by Oscar Zariski|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]|year=1936|volume=42|issue=1, Part 2|pages=13–14|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1936-42-01/S0002-9904-1936-06238-5/S0002-9904-1936-06238-5.pdf|doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1936-06238-5}}</ref>\n*{{Citation | last1=Zariski | first1=Oscar | author1-link=Oscar Zariski | title=Introduction to the problem of minimal models in the theory of algebraic surfaces | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-HuAAAAMAAJ | publisher=The [[Mathematical Society of Japan]], Tokyo | series=Publications of the Mathematical Society of Japan | year=1958 | volume=4 | mr=0097403}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Zariski | first1=Oscar | author1-link=Oscar Zariski | editor1-last=Cohn | editor1-first=James | title=An introduction to the theory of algebraic surfaces | origyear=1958 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Lecture notes in mathematics | isbn=978-3-540-04602-8 | doi=10.1007/BFb0082246 | year=1969 | volume=83 | mr=0263819}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Zariski | first1=Oscar | author1-link=Oscar Zariski | last2=Samuel | first2=Pierre | author2-link=Pierre Samuel | title=Commutative algebra I | origyear=1958 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-387-90089-6 | year=1975 | volume=28 | mr=0090581}}<ref>{{cite journal|author=Herstein, I.

Søren's father, Niels's grandfather, Hans Mathias Abel, was also a pastor, at [[Gjerstad Church]] near the [[Risør (town)|town of Risør]]. Søren had spent his childhood at Gjerstad, and had also served as chaplain there; and after his father's death in 1804, Søren was appointed pastor at Gjerstad and the family moved there. The Abel family originated in [[Schleswig]] and came to Norway in the 17th century.\n\n[[File:Gjerstad kirke or Risør.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory.|Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory in 1890–95. The main building of the rectory was the same as when Abel lived here.]]\n\nAnne Marie Simonsen was from [[Risør (town)|Risør]]; her father, Niels Henrik Saxild Simonsen, was a tradesman and merchant ship-owner, and said to be the richest person in Risør. Anne Marie had grown up with two [[Stepfamily|stepmothers]], in relatively luxurious surroundings. At Gjerstad rectory, she enjoyed arranging balls and social gatherings. Much suggests she was early on an alcoholic and took little interest in the upbringing of the children. Niels Henrik and his brothers were given their schooling by their father, with handwritten books to read. An addition table in a book of mathematics reads: 1+0=0.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\n=== Cathedral School and Royal Frederick University ===\nWith Norwegian independence and the first election held in Norway, in 1814, Søren Abel was elected as a representative to the [[Storting]]. Meetings of the Storting were held until 1866 in the main hall of the [[Oslo katedralskole|Cathedral School]] in Christiania (now known as [[Oslo]]). Almost certainly, this is how he came into contact with the school, and he decided that his eldest son, Hans Mathias, should start there the following year. However, when the time for his departure approached, Hans was so saddened and depressed over having to leave home that his father did not dare send him away. He decided to send Niels instead.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\nIn 1815, Niels Abel entered the Cathedral School at the age of 13. His elder brother Hans joined him there a year later. They shared rooms and had classes together. Hans got better grades than Niels; however, a new mathematics teacher, [[Bernt Michael Holmboe]], was appointed in 1818. He gave the students mathematical tasks to do at home. He saw Niels Henrik's talent in mathematics, and encouraged him to study the subject to an advanced level. He even gave Niels private lessons after school.\n\nIn 1818, Søren Abel had a public theological argument with the theologian Stener Johannes Stenersen regarding his [[catechism]] from 1806. The argument was well covered in the press. Søren was given the nickname \"Abel Treating\" ''(Norwegian: \"Abel Spandabel\")''. Niels' reaction to the quarrel was said to have been \"excessive gaiety\". At the same time, Søren also almost faced impeachment after insulting [[Carsten Anker]], the host of the [[Norwegian Constituent Assembly]]; and in September 1818 he returned to Gjerstad with his political career in ruins. He began drinking heavily and died only two years later, in 1820, aged 48.\n\nBernt Michael Holmboe supported Niels Henrik Abel with a scholarship to remain at the school and raised money from his friends to enable him to study at the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]].\n\nWhen Abel entered the university in 1821, he was already the most knowledgeable mathematician in Norway. Holmboe had nothing more he could teach him and Abel had studied all the latest mathematical literature in the university library. During that time, Abel started working on the [[quintic equation]] in radicals. Mathematicians had been looking for a solution to this problem for over 250 years. In 1821, Abel thought he had found the solution. The two professors of mathematics in Christiania, Søren Rasmussen and [[Christopher Hansteen]], found no errors in Abel's formulas, and sent the work on to the leading mathematician in the Nordic countries, [[Carl Ferdinand Degen]] in Copenhagen. He too found no faults but still doubted that the solution, which so many outstanding mathematicians had sought for so long, could really have been found by an unknown student in far-off Christiania. Degen noted, however, Abel's unusually sharp mind, and believed that such a talented young man should not waste his abilities on such a \"sterile object\" as the fifth degree equation, but rather on [[elliptic function]]s and [[Transcendental number theory|transcendence]]; for then, wrote Degen, he would \"discover Magellanian thoroughfares to large portions of a vast analytical ocean\".<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" /> Degen asked Abel to give a numerical example of his method. While trying to provide an example, Abel found a mistake in his paper.<ref name=\"StAndrews\">[http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Abel.html Abel biography].

His performance was exceptionally high in mathematics and average in other matters.\n\n===Career===\n[[File:Abel-kladd.jpg|thumb|alt=From a notebook of Niels Henrik Abel|From the notebook of Niels Henrik Abel.]]\n\nAfter he graduated, professors from university supported Abel financially, and Professor Christopher Hansteen let him live in a room in the attic of his home. Abel would later view Ms. Hansteen as his second mother. While living here, Abel helped his younger brother, Peder Abel, through [[examen artium]]. He also helped his sister Elisabeth to find work in the town.\n\nIn early 1823, Niels Abel published his first article in \"Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne\", Norway's first scientific journal, which had been co-founded by Professor Hansteen. Abel published several articles, but the journal soon realized that this was not material for the common reader. In 1823, Abel also wrote a paper in French. It was \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (''Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler)''. He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However the work was lost, while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\n[[File:Christine Kemp.jpg|thumb|Christine Kemp]]\n\nIn mid-1823, Professor Rasmussen gave Abel a gift of 100 [[speciedaler]] so he could travel to [[Copenhagen]] and visit Ferdinand Degen and other mathematicians there. While in Copenhagen, Abel did some work on [[Fermat's Last Theorem]]. Abel's uncle, Peder Mandrup Tuxen, lived at the naval base in [[Christianshavn]], Copenhagen, and at a ball there Niels Abel met Christine Kemp, his future fiancée. In 1824, Christine moved to [[Son, Norway|Son]], Norway to work as a governess and the couple got engaged over Christmas.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\nAfter returning from Copenhagen, Abel applied for a government scholarship in order to visit top mathematicians in Germany and France, but he was instead granted 200 speciedaler yearly for two years, to stay in Christiania and study German and French. In the next two years, he was promised a scholarship of 600 speciedaler yearly and he would then be permitted to travel abroad.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" /> While studying these languages, Abel published his first notable work in 1824, ''Mémoire sur les équations algébriques où on démontre l'impossibilité de la résolution de l'équation générale du cinquième degré''<ref>http://www.abelprize.no/c54178/binfil/download.php?tid=53608</ref> (Memoir on algebraic equations, in which the impossibility of solving the general equation of the fifth degree is proven). For, in 1823, Abel had at last proved the impossibility of solving the quintic equation in radicals (now referred to as the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). However, this paper was in an abstruse and difficult form, in part because he had restricted himself to only six pages, in order to save money on printing. A more detailed [[Mathematical proof|proof]] was published in 1826 in the first volume of ''[[Crelle's Journal]]''.\n\nIn 1825, Abel wrote a personal letter to [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|King Carl Johan of Norway/Sweden]] requesting permission to travel abroad. He was granted this permission, and in September 1825 he left Christiania together with four friends from university (Christian P.B Boeck, Balthazar M. Keilhau, Nicolay B. Møller and Otto Tank). These four friends of Abel were traveling to Berlin and to the Alps to study geology. Abel wanted to follow them to Copenhagen and from there make his way to Göttingen. The terms for his scholarship stipulated that he was to visit [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in [[Göttingen]] and then continue to Paris. However, when he got as far as Copenhagen he changed his plans. He wanted to follow his friends to Berlin instead, intending to visit Göttingen and Paris afterwards.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\nOn the way, he visited the astronomer [[Heinrich Christian Schumacher]] in Altona, now a district of Hamburg. He then spent four months in Berlin, where he became well acquainted with [[August Leopold Crelle]], who was then about to publish his mathematical journal, ''[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]''. This project was warmly encouraged by Abel, who contributed much to the success of the venture. Abel contributed seven articles to it in its first year.\n\nFrom Berlin Abel also followed his friends to the Alps. He went to [[Leipzig]] and [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] to visit [[Georg Amadeus Carl Friedrich Naumann]] and his brother the mathematician August Naumann. In Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, [[Elliptic function|elliptic]], [[Hyperelliptic function|hyperelliptic]], and a new class now known as [[abelian function]]s.\n\nFrom Freiberg they went on to Dresden, Prague, Vienna, Trieste, Venice, Verona, Bolzano, Innsbruck, Luzern and Basel. From July 1826 Abel traveled on his own from Basel to Paris. Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the [[French Academy of Sciences]], a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. With the help of a painter, [[Johan Gørbitz]], he found an apartment in Paris and continued his work on the theorem. He finished in October 1826, and submitted it to the academy. It was to be reviewed by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]. Abel's work was scarcely known in Paris, and his modesty restrained him from proclaiming his research. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death.\n\nAbel's limited finances finally compelled him to abandon his tour in January 1827. He returned to Berlin, and was offered a position as editor of Crelle's Journal, but opted out. By May 1827 he was back in Norway. His tour abroad was viewed as a failure. He had not visited Gauss in Göttingen and he had not published anything in Paris. His scholarship was therefore not renewed and he had to take up a private loan in [[Norges Bank]] of 200 spesidaler. He never repaid this loan. He also started tutoring. He continued to send most of his work to Crelle's Journal. But in mid-1828 he published, in rivalry with [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Carl Jacobi]], an important work on elliptic functions in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' in Altona.\n\n=== Death ===\nWhile in Paris, Abel contracted [[tuberculosis]]. At Christmas 1828, he traveled by sled to [[Froland]] to visit his fiancée. He became seriously ill on the journey; and, although a temporary improvement allowed the couple to enjoy the holiday together, he died relatively soon after on 6 April 1829, just two days before a letter arrived from August Crelle. Crelle had been searching for a new job for Abel in Berlin and had actually managed to have him appointed as a Professor at the [[University of Berlin]]. Crelle wrote to Abel to tell him, but the good news came too late.\n\n==Contributions to mathematics==\nAbel showed that there is no general [[algebraic function|algebraic]] solution for the roots of a [[quintic equation]], or any general [[polynomial equation]] of degree greater than four, in terms of explicit algebraic operations. To do this, he invented (independently of [[Galois]]) a branch of mathematics known as [[History of group theory|group theory]],  which is invaluable not only in many areas of mathematics, but for much of [[physics]] as well. Abel sent a paper on the unsolvability of the quintic equation to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], who proceeded to discard without a glance what he believed to be the worthless work of a crank.<ref name=\"scienceworld.wolfram.com\">{{cite web|url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Abel.html|title=Abel, Niels Henrik (1802-1829) -- from Eric Weisstein's World of Scientific Biography|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs a 16-year-old, Abel gave a rigorous proof of the [[binomial theorem]] valid for all numbers, extending [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s result which had held only for [[rationals]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Abel, Niels Henrik |url = http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Abel.html |website=Eric Weisstein's World of Science|publisher=Wolfram Research|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135959982|page=562 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rElJAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=27 January 2017 }}</ref> Abel wrote a fundamental work on the theory of [[elliptic integrals]], containing the foundations of the theory of [[elliptic functions]].\nWhile travelling to Paris he published a paper revealing the double periodicity of elliptic functions, which [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] later described to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] as \"a monument more lasting than bronze\" (borrowing a famous sentence by the Roman poet [[Horace|Horatius]]). The paper was, however, misplaced by Cauchy.<ref name=\"scienceworld.wolfram.com\" />\n\nWhile abroad Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in the ''Crelle's Journal'', but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the French Academy of Sciences, a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death.\nWhile in Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, [[Elliptic function|elliptic]], [[Hyperelliptic function|hyperelliptic]], and a new class now known as [[abelian function]]s.\n\nIn 1823 Abel wrote a paper titled \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (Norwegian: ''en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler''). He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However the work was lost, while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.<ref name=\"SNL-bio\" />\n\nAbel said famously of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s writing style, \"He is like the fox, who effaces his tracks in the sand with his tail.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Simmons\n| first = George Finlay\n| title = Calculus Gems\n| publisher = McGraw Hill\n| year = 1992\n| location = New York\n| page = 177\n| ISBN = 0-88385-561-5\n}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nUnder Abel's guidance, the prevailing obscurities of [[analysis]] began to be cleared, new fields were entered upon and the study of functions so advanced as to provide mathematicians with numerous ramifications along which progress could be made. His works, the greater part of which originally appeared in ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'', were edited by Bernt Michael Holmboe and published in 1839 by the Norwegian government, and a more complete edition by [[Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|Ludwig Sylow]] and [[Sophus Lie]] was published in 1881. The adjective \"abelian\", derived from his name, has become so commonplace in mathematical writing that it is conventionally spelled with a lower-case initial \"a\" (e.g., [[abelian group]], [[abelian category]], and [[abelian variety]]).\n\nOn 6 April 1929, four Norwegian stamps were issued for the centenary of Abel's death. His portrait appears on the 500-[[Norwegian krone|kroner]] [[banknote]] (version V) issued during 1978–1985. On 5 June 2002, four Norwegian stamps were issued in honour of Abel two months before the bicentenary of his birth. There is also a 20-kroner coin issued by Norway in his honour. A statue of Abel stands in Oslo, and crater [[Abel (crater)|Abel]] on the [[Moon]] was named after him. In 2002, the [[Abel Prize]] was established in his memory.\n\nMathematician [[Felix Klein]] wrote about Abel:\n{{quote|But I would not like to part from this ideal type of researcher, such as has seldom appeared in the history of mathematics, without evoking a figure from another sphere who, in spite of his totally different field, still seems related. Thus, although Abel shared with many mathematicians a complete lack of musical talent, I will not sound absurd if I compare his kind of productivity and his personality with [[Mozart]]'s. Thus one might erect a monument to this divinely inspired mathematician like the one to Mozart in Vienna: simple and unassuming he stands there listening, while graceful angels float about, playfully bringing him inspiration from another world.\nInstead, I must mention the very different type of memorial that was in fact erected to Abel in [[Oslo|Christiania]] and which must greatly disappoint anyone familiar with his nature. On a towering, steep block of granite a youthful athlete of the Byronic type steps over two greyish sacrificial victims, his direction toward the heavens. If needed be, one might take the hero to be a symbol of the human spirit, but one ponders the deeper significance of the two monsters in vain. Are they the conquered quintic equations or elliptic functions? Or the sorrows and cares of his everyday life?

      "text": "'''Sergei Ivanovich Adian''', also '''Adyan''' ({{lang-hy|Սերգեյ Իվանովիչ Ադյան}}; {{lang-ru|Серге́й Ива́нович Адя́н}}, born 1 January 1931), is a [[USSR|Soviet]] and [[Russia]]n mathematician. He is a professor at the [[Moscow State University]] and is known for his work in [[group theory]], especially on the [[Burnside's problem|Burnside problem]].\n\n==Biography==\nAdian was born near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Elizavetpol]]. He grew up there in an [[Armenians|Armenian]] family. He studied at [[Yerevan]] and [[Moscow]] [[pedagogical]] institutes. His advisor was [[Pyotr Novikov]]. He has been working at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. [[Alexander Razborov]] was one of his students.\n\n==Mathematical career==\nIn his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function <math>f(x)</math> of a real variable satisfying the functional equation <math>f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y)</math> and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician [[Edwin Hewitt]] from the [[University of Washington]] gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}\n\nBy the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group <math>G</math>, for any group <math>G</math>. These results constituted his [[Ph.D.]] thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the [[Adian–Rabin theorem]]. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian’s result was immediately used by [[Andrey Markov]] in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.\n\n===Burnside problem===\n\nAbout the Burnside problem:\n<blockquote>\nVery much like [[Fermat's Last Theorem]] in number theory, Burnside’s\nproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the mind of the mathematician.\n</blockquote>\n\nBefore the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for <math>n \\in {2, 3, 4, 6}</math> and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period <math>n</math>. The only question was\nto find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\nform <math>X^n = 1</math>.\n\nAn approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife [[Lyudmila Keldysh]], Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\ncollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods <math>n > 4381</math>, and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.\n\nThe solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\nand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\nis one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\nused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\nby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\nthe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\nof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more ‘penetrating’\nthan Adian.\n\nIn contrast to the Adian–Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way ‘closed’ the Burnside problem. Moreover,\nover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\nthe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\nfundamental problems in group theory.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\nappeared who mastered the Novikov–Adian method, the theory already\nrepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\nperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.\n\n== External links ==\n* {{ru icon}} ''[http://www.mi.ras.ru/~razborov/adian75.pdf On 75th birthday]'' – an article by L.

In 1992, Aschbacher was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Rolf Schock Prize]] for Mathematics by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 2011.<ref>[http://www.kva.se/en/pressroom/Press-releases-2011/Michael-Aschbacher-is-being-awarded-The-Rolf-Schock-Prize-in-Mathematics/ Michael Aschbacher is being awarded The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics],  [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] press release, March 23, 2011.</ref> In 2012 he received the [[Leroy P.

Aschbacher considered himself somewhat of an outsider in the world of conventional group theory, claiming that he was not \"plugged into the system at that point in time.\"  <ref>{{cite journal| last=Steingart| first=Alma| title=A group theory of group theory|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume = 42|issue = 2|pages=197|publisher =sagepub|year=2012| doi=10.1177/0306312712436547}}</ref>  \nAlthough he had access to several preprints that were shared among the practitioners of the field, he reproduced many proofs that had already been discovered by other researchers and published them in his early papers. Aschbacher only became interested in [[finite simple groups]] as a postdoctorate. He wrote his dissertation in [[combinatorics]] and was able to utilize many techniques developed in this area to make early contributions to the study of [[finite simple groups]] which surprised the community of researchers. In particular, [[Daniel Gorenstein]], another leader of the [[classification of finite simple groups]], said that Aschbacher's entrance was \"dramatic.\" <ref>{{cite journal| last=Steingart| first=Alma| title=A group theory of group theory|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume = 42|issue = 2|pages=200|publisher =sagepub|year=2012| doi=10.1177/0306312712436547}}</ref>\n\nIn fact, the rate of Aschbacher's results proved so astounding that many other mathematicians decided to leave the field to pursue other problems. Aschbacher was proving one major result after another and when he announced his progress at the Duluth conference, mathematicians were convinced that the problem was almost solved. This conference represented a turning point for the problem as many mathematicians (in particular those relatively new to the field) decided to leave the field to pursue other problems.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Steingart| first=Alma| title=A group theory of group theory|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume = 42|issue = 2|pages=203|publisher =sagepub|year=2012| doi=10.1177/0306312712436547}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Aschbacher's entrance into the field did not come without difficulties. Aschbacher's papers, beginning with the first he wrote in the field for publication, were very difficult to read. Some commented that his proofs lacked explanations of very sophisticated [[counting]] arguments. As Aschbacher's proofs became longer, it became even more difficult for others to understand his proofs. Even some of his own coauthors had trouble reading their own papers. From that point on, researchers no longer read papers as independent documents, but rather ones that required the context of its author. As a result, responsibility of finding errors in the classification problem was up to the entire community of researchers rather than just peer-reviewers alone. That Aschbacher's proofs were hard to read was not due to a lack of ability, but rather to the astounding complexity of the ideas he was able to produce.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Steingart| first=Alma| title=A group theory of group theory|journal=Social Studies of Science|volume = 42|issue = 2|pages=201|publisher =sagepub|year=2012| doi=10.1177/0306312712436547}}</ref>\n\n== Books ==\n\n*''Finite group theory'' {{ISBN|0-521-78675-4}}\n*''Sporadic groups'' {{ISBN|0-521-42049-0}}\n*''3-Transposition groups'' {{ISBN|0-521-57196-0}}\n*''The finite simple groups and their classification'' {{ISBN|0-300-02449-5}}\n*''Overgroups of Sylow subgroups in sporadic groups'' {{ISBN|0-8218-2344-2}}\n*{{Citation | last1=Aschbacher | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Aschbacher | last2=Smith | first2=Stephen D. | title=The classification of quasithin groups.

These ideas came together in his vertex-algebraic construction and analysis of the fake monster Lie algebra (called the monster Lie algebra at the time).  \n\nBorcherds is best known for his resolution of the Conway-Norton [[monstrous moonshine|monstrous moonshine conjecture]], which describes an intricate relation between the [[monster group]] and [[modular function]]s on the complex upper half-plane.  To prove this conjecture, he drew upon theories that he had previously introduced, namely those of vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, together with techniques of [[string theory]], and applied them to the \"moonshine module\", a vertex operator algebra with monster symmetry constructed by [[Igor Frenkel]], [[James Lepowsky]], and [[Arne Meurman]].  Additional work in moonshine concerned mod p variants of this conjecture, and were known as modular moonshine.\n\nLater contributions include the theory of Borcherds products, which are holomorphic [[automorphic forms]] on ''O''(''n'',2) that have well-behaved infinite product expansions at cusps.  Borcherds used this theory to resolve some long-standing conjectures concerning quasi-affineness of certain [[moduli space]]s of [[algebraic surface]]s.

He showed, however, that in dimensions ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;4 the condition of having a finitely-sided [[Dirichlet domain]] is no longer equivalent to the standard notions of geometric finiteness. In a subsequent paper<ref>B. H. Bowditch, [http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?service=UI&version=1.0&verb=Display&handle=euclid.dmj/1077286152 \"Geometrical finiteness with variable negative curvature\"] ''[[Duke Mathematical Journal]]'', vol. 77 (1995), no. 1, 229–274</ref> Bowditch considered a similar problem for discrete groups of isometries of [[Hadamard space|Hadamard manifold]] of pinched (but not necessarily constant) negative curvature and of arbitrary dimension ''n''&nbsp;≥&nbsp;2. He proved that four out of five equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness considered in his previous paper remain equivalent in this general set-up, but the condition of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron is no longer equivalent to them.  \n\nMuch of Bowditch's work in the 1990s concerned studying boundaries at infinity of [[word-hyperbolic group]]s. He proved the ''cut-point conjecture'' which says that the boundary of a [[Stallings theorem about ends of groups|one-ended]] word-hyperbolic group does not have any global [[cut-point]]s.

Namely, Bowditch proved<ref>B. H. Bowditch, [http://www.ams.org/jams/1998-11-03/S0894-0347-98-00264-1/home.html \"A topological characterisation of hyperbolic groups\"] ''[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]'', vol. 11 (1998), no. 3, pp. 643–667.</ref> that a group ''G'' is word-hyperbolic if and only if ''G'' admits an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] by [[homeomorphism]]s on a perfect metrisable compactum ''M'' as a \"uniform convergence group\", that is such that the diagonal action of ''G'' on the set of distinct triples from ''M'' is properly discontinuous and co-compact; moreover, in that case ''M'' is ''G''-equivariantly homeomorphic to the boundary ∂''G'' of ''G''. Later, building up on this work, Bowditch's PhD student Yaman gave a topological characterisation of [[relatively hyperbolic group]]s.<ref>Asli Yaman, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1515/crll.2004.007 \"A topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups\". ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'', vol. 566 (2004), pp. 41–89.]</ref>\n\nMuch of Bowditch's work in 2000s concerns the study of the [[curve complex]], with various applications to [[3-manifold]]s, [[mapping class group]]s and [[Kleinian group]]s. The [[curve complex]] ''C''(''S'') of a finite type surface ''S'', introduced by Harvey in the late 1970s,<ref>W. J. Harvey, \"Boundary structure of the modular group\". ''Riemann surfaces and related topics: Proceedings of the 1978 Stony Brook Conference'' (State Univ. New York, Stony Brook, N.Y., 1978), pp. 245–251,\n''Ann. of Math. Stud.'', 97, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N.J., 1981. {{ISBN|0-691-08264-2}}</ref> has the set of free homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on ''S'' as the set of vertices, where several distinct vertices span a simplex if the corresponding curves can be realised disjointly. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the [[Teichmüller space]], of [[mapping class group]]s and of [[Kleinian group]]s. In a 1999 paper<ref>[[Howard Masur]], and [[Yair Minsky]], \"Geometry of the complex of curves. I. Hyperbolicity\" ''[[Inventiones Mathematicae]]'', vol. 138 (1999), no. 1, pp. 103–149.</ref> [[Howard Masur]] and [[Yair Minsky]] proved that for a finite type orientable surface ''S'' the curve complex ''C''(''S'') is [[δ-hyperbolic space|Gromov-hyperbolic]]. This result was a key component in the subsequent proof of [[William Thurston|Thurston's]] [[Ending lamination conjecture]], a solution which was based on the combined work of Yair Minsky, Howard Masur, Jeffrey Brock, and [[Richard Canary]].<ref>Yair Minsky, \"Curve complexes, surfaces and 3-manifolds\". International Congress of Mathematics. Vol. II, pp. 1001–1033, Eur. Math. Soc., Zürich, 2006. {{ISBN|978-3-03719-022-7}}</ref> In 2006 Bowditch gave another proof<ref>Brian H.

Bowditch's proof is more combinatorial and rather different from the Masur-Minsky original argument. Bowditch's result also provides an estimate on the hyperbolicity constant of the curve complex which is logarithmic in complexity of the surface and also gives a description of geodesics in the curve complex in terms of the intersection numbers. A subsequent 2008 paper of Bowditch<ref>Brian H. Bowditch, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r823h07n8k31n166/ \"Tight geodesics in the curve complex\"] ''[[Inventiones Mathematicae]]'', vol. 171 (2008), no. 2, pp. 281–300.</ref> pushed these ideas further and obtained new quantitative finiteness results regarding the so-called \"tight geodesics\" in the curve complex, a notion introduced by Masur and Minsky to combat the fact that the curve complex is not locally finite. As an application, Bowditch proved that, with a few exceptions of surfaces of small complexity, the action of the [[mapping class group]] Mod(''S'') on ''C''(''S'') is \"acylindrical\" and that the asymptotic translation lengths of [[Pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov]] elements of Mod(''S'') on ''C''(''S'') are rational numbers with bounded denominators. \n\nA 2007 paper of Bowditch<ref name=\"angel\"/> produces a positive solution of the [[angel problem]] of [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]:<ref>John H.

He worked mainly in [[abstract algebra]], but made important contributions to [[number theory]]. He was the founder of [[modular representation theory]].\n\n==Education and career==\n[[Alfred Brauer]] was Richard's brother and seven years older. Alfred and Richard were both interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an [[inventor]], and in February 1919 enrolled in [[Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. He soon transferred to [[University of Berlin]]. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at [[University of Freiburg]], he studied in Berlin, being awarded his [[Ph.D.]] on 16 March 1926. [[Issai Schur]] conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by [[Heinz Hopf]] at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional [[group representation|representations]] of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.\n\nIlse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Richard were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (b 1927) and Fred Gunther (b 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in [[Königsberg]] (now Kaliningrad) working as [[Konrad Knopp]]’s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a [[perfect field]] while in Königsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the [[Brauer group]] he introduced.\n\nWhen the [[Nazi Party]] took over in 1933, the [[Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars]] took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists.<ref name=Transcending/> Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at [[University of Kentucky]]. Richard accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], teaching in English.<ref name=Transcending/> Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in [[The Holocaust]].<ref name=Transcending>Bergmann, Birgit; Epple, Moritz; and Ungar, Ruti.

Springer, 2012. {{ISBN|3642224636}}. Accessed February 25, 2013. \"Schur's disciple Alfred Brauer was the last Jewish mathematician who managed to complete his habilitation and become Privatdozent at the University of Berlin before the Nazi regime began. Brauer escaped to the USA in 1939, joining his brother Richard (1901-1977) who had fled in 1933.\"</ref>\n\n[[Hermann Weyl]] invited Richard to assist him at Princeton's [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1934. Richard and [[Nathan Jacobson]] edited Weyl's lectures ''Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups''. Through the influence of [[Emmy Noether]], Richard was invited to [[University of Toronto]] to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student [[Cecil J. Nesbitt]] he developed [[modular representation theory]], published in 1937.  [[Robert Steinberg]], [[Stephen Arthur Jennings]], and [[Ralph Gordon Stanton|Ralph Stanton]] were also Brauer’s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with [[Tadasi Nakayama]] on representations of algebras. In 1941 [[University of Wisconsin]] hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and [[Bloomington, Indiana]] where [[Emil Artin]] was teaching.\n\nIn 1948 Richard and Ilse moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in [[Abstract algebra|modern algebra]] at [[University of Michigan]]. With his graduate student K. A. Fowler, Brauer proved the [[Brauer-Fowler theorem]].  [[Donald John Lewis]] was another of his students at UM.\n\nIn 1952 Brauer joined the faculty of [[Harvard University]]. Before retiring in 1971 he taught aspiring mathematicians such as Donald Passman and I. Martin Isaacs. The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as [[Reinhold Baer]], [[Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski]], and [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]].\n\n==Mathematical work==\n\nSeveral theorems bear his name, including [[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|Brauer's induction theorem]], which has applications in [[number theory]] as well as [[finite group theory]], and its corollary [[Brauer's theorem on induced characters|Brauer's characterization of characters]], which is central to the theory of group characters.\n\nThe [[Brauer&ndash;Fowler theorem]], published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the [[classification of finite simple groups]], for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the [[centralizer]] of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure.\n\nBrauer applied [[modular representation theory]] to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his [[Brauer's three main theorems|three main theorems]]. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow 2-subgroups]]. The [[Brauer&ndash;Suzuki theorem]] showed that no finite simple group could have a [[generalized quaternion group|generalized quaternion]] Sylow 2-subgroup, and the [[Alperin&ndash;Brauer&ndash;Gorenstein theorem]] classified finite groups with wreathed or [[quasidihedral group|quasidihedral]] Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the [[Gorenstein–Walter theorem]], classifying finite groups with a [[dihedral group|dihedral]] Sylow 2-subgroup, and [[George Glauberman|Glauberman's]] [[Z* theorem]]. The theory of a [[modular representation theory|block]] with a cyclic [[Modular representation theory|defect group]], first worked out by Brauer in the case when the [[modular representation theory|principal block]] has defect group of order ''p'', and later worked out in full generality by [[E. C. Dade]], also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The [[Brauer tree]] is a combinatorial object associated to a [[modular representation theory|block]] with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block.\n\nIn 1970, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>[[National Science Foundation]] [https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=51 The President's National Medal of Science]</ref>\n\n==Hypercomplex numbers==\n{{Main|Hypercomplex number}}\n\n[[Eduard Study]] had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for [[Klein's encyclopedia]] in 1898. This article was expanded for the [[French language]] edition by [[Henri Cartan]] in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study’s article, and Richard Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened.  Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was published<ref>''Mathematical Journal of Okayama University'' 21:53&ndash;89</ref> by [[Okayama University]] in [[Japan]]. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his ''Collected Papers''.  His title was \"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\". Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer’s article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction:\n:In the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar \"hypercomplex\" number can be defined using points of n-dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given.\n\nWhile still in Königsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in [[Mathematische Zeitschrift]] \"Über Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\"<ref>''Mathematische Zeitschrift'' 30:79&ndash;107, paper #7 in ''Collected Papers''</ref>  which was primarily concerned with [[integral domain]]s (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] which he used later in Toronto.\n\n==Publications==\n*{{Citation | editor1-last=Brauer | editor1-first=R. | editor1-link=Richard Brauer | editor2-last=Sah | editor2-first=Chih-han | title=Theory of finite groups: A symposium | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRdCAAAAIAAJ | publisher=W.

In 1931 [[S. A. Gershgorin]] described geometric bounds on the eigenvectors in terms of the matrix elements. This result known as the [[Gershgorin circle theorem]] has been used as a basis for extension. In 1964 Brenner reported on ''Theorems of Gersgorin Type''.<ref>Brenner (January 1964) [http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0433879 Theorems of Gersgorin type], citation from [[Defense Technical Information Center]].</ref> In 1967 at [[University of Wisconsin—Madison]], working in the Mathematics Research Center, he produced a technical report ''New root-location theorems for partitioned matrices''.<ref>J.

Shortly after arriving at UBC, Joel circulated a memo to all the graduate students, informing them that he had several open problems in various areas of mathematics and would share them with willing students. Hoping to get a problem in [[group theory]] that I might work into a thesis, I went to his office and inquired about the problems. He presented me the Van der Waerden conjecture, which he informed me would be quite difficult, and after defining the [[permanent (mathematics)|permanent]] for me sent me off with several problems concerning the permanent function. His encouragement and enthusiasm persevered through several \"proofs\" of the [[permanent (mathematics)#Van der Waerden's conjecture|Van der Waerden conjecture]], and soon some of the less well-known problems had been solved. He would always tell me how a proposed attack would work and leave me to fight out the details. Those exchanges led to the publication of my first paper, and I became his thirteenth coauthor. By the time Joel had left UBC in the spring of 1967, I was firmly entrenched in matrix theory.<ref name=Beasley/>{{rp|3}}\n\nIn 1981 Brenner and [[Roger Lyndon]] collaborated to polish an idea due to [[H. W. Kuhn]] for proving the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]]. In the solution by Eric S. Rosenthal to a problem in the ''American Mathematical Monthly'' posted by Harry D. Ruderman,<ref>Solution to problem #6192, ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 86: 598</ref> Kuhn’s work from 1974 was cited. A query was made and prompted an article by Brenner and Lyndon.<ref>J. L. Brenner & [[R. C. Lyndon]] (1981) \"Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\", ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 88(4):254–6</ref> The version of the fundamental theorem stated was as follows:\n:Let ''P''(''z'') be a non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients. Then there is a positive number ''S'' > 0, depending only on ''P'', with the following property:\n:: for every δ > 0 there is a complex number ''z'' such that |''z''| ≤ ''S'' and |''P''(''z'')| < δ .\n\nBrenner ultimately acquired 35 coauthors in his publications.\n\n===Alternating group===\nGiven an ordered set Ω with ''n'' elements, the [[even permutation]]s on it determine the [[alternating group]] A<sub>n</sub>. In 1960 Brenner proposed the following research problem in group theory:<ref>Brenner (1960) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1960-66-04/S0002-9904-1960-10468-5/S0002-9904-1960-10468-5.pdf Research Problem in Group Theory], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 66(4):275</ref> For which A<sub>n</sub> does there exist an element ''a''<sub>n</sub> such that every element ''g'' is similar to a [[commutator]] of ''a''<sub>n</sub>? Brenner states that the property is true for 4 < ''n'' < 10; in symbols it may be expressed\n:<math>\\exists a_n \\ \\forall g \\ \\exists u \\ \\exists y \\ (g = u^{-1}(a_n y a_n^{-1} y^{-1}) u) .</math>\nThe alternating groups are [[simple group]]s, and in 1971 Brenner began a series of articles titled \"Covering theorems for finite simple groups\". He was interested in the [[cycle type]] of [[cyclic permutation]]s, and when A<sub>n</sub> ⊂ ''C C'', where ''C'' is a [[conjugacy class]] of a certain type.<ref>Brenner, R.M. Cranwell, and J. Riddell (1975) [http://msp.org/pjm/1975/58-1/p05.xhtml Covering theorems: V],  [[Pacific Journal of Mathematics]] 58: 55–60</ref><ref>Brenner & L. Carlitz (1976) [[Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico della Università di Padova]] 55:81–90</ref><ref>Brenner (1978) \"Covering theorems for FINASIGS\", [[Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society]] 25A: 210–14</ref>\n\nIn 1977 he posed the question, \"What permutations in A<sub>n</sub> can be expressed as a product of permutations of periods k and l\" ?<ref>Brenner & J. Riddell (1977) ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 84(1): 39–40</ref>\n\n==Works==\n\nIn 1987 [[Linear Algebra and its Applications]] published a list of 111 articles by J.L.

He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of [[finite group]]s.\n\nBurnside was born in [[London]], and attended [[St. John's College, Cambridge|St. John's]] and [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]]s at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was the [[Second Wrangler]] in 1875.<ref>{{acad|id=BNSD871W|name=Burnside, William}}</ref> He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich|Royal Naval College]] in [[Greenwich]]. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career.\n\nBurnside's early research was in [[applied mathematics]]. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of [[finite group]]s. This was not a widely studied subject in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition.\n\nThe central part of Burnside's group theory work was in the area of [[group representation]]s, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside's best known contributions to group theory is his [[Burnside's theorem|''p<sup>a</sup>q<sup>b</sup>'' theorem]], which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is [[solvable group|solvable]].\n\nIn 1897 Burnside's classic work ''Theory of Groups of Finite Order'' was published.<ref name=Miller/> The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of [[character theory]] in the second.<ref>[[G. B. Mathews]](1911) [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v88/n2197/pdf/088170a0.pdf Theory of Groups of Finite Order] from [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] 88:170,1 (#2197)</ref>\n\nBurnside is also remembered for the formulation of [[Burnside's problem]] that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements  needed to generate it, and also for [[Burnside's lemma]] (a formula relating the number of [[Group action (mathematics)#Orbits and stabilizers|orbits]] of a [[permutation group]] acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and [[Augustin Cauchy]].\n\nHe received an [[honorary doctorate]] ([[D.Sc.]]) from the [[University of Dublin]] in June 1901.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Friday |date=28 June 1901 |page_number=10 |issue=36493}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team. In fact, his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' took more interest in his athletic career, calling him \"one of the best known Cambridge athletes of his day\".\n\nHe is buried at the [[West Wickham]] Parish Church in South London.<ref>{{Cite book | title=The Collected Papers of William Burnside: Commentary on Burnside's life and work ; Papers 1883–1899 | author=Burnside, W. | editor1=Neumann, P.M. |editor2=Mann, A.J.S. | editor3=Tompson, J.C. |isbn=9780198505860 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |volume=1 |page=106 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n*{{cite book|title=Theory of groups of finite order|year=1911|publisher=Cambridge University Press|edition=2nd|url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000419368|postscript=; xxiv+512 p.}}\n*{{cite book|editor=Forsyth, A.

Cannon's 1984 paper \"The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups\"<ref name=\"C84\">J. W. Cannon, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/v6051511338244x2/ ''The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups.''] Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 16 (1984), no. 2, pp. 123–148.</ref> was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of [[word-hyperbolic group]]s, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]].<ref name=\"G\">M. Gromov, ''Hyperbolic Groups'', in: \"Essays in Group Theory\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75–263.</ref> Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the [[Cayley graph]]s of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the [[hyperbolic 3-space|hyperbolic space]]. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit [[finitely presented group|finite presentations]] where the [[Small cancellation theory#Dehn.27s algorithm|Dehn algorithm]] solves the [[word problem for groups|word problem]]. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being [[word-hyperbolic group|word-hyperbolic]] and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in [[word-hyperbolic group]]s is solvable by Dehn's algorithm.<ref>R.

Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a [[rational function]]. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the [[word-hyperbolic group]] context.<ref name=\"G\"/> Now standard proofs<ref name=\"aut\"/> of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a [[word-hyperbolic group]] is a [[regular language]] also use finiteness of the number of cone types.\n\nCannon's work also introduced an important notion of ''almost convexity'' for Cayley graphs of [[finitely generated group]]s,<ref>James W.

They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold ''M'' that [[fiber bundle|fibers]] over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface ''S''. In this case the universal cover of ''S'', which is identified with the [[Hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]], admits an embedding into the universal cover of ''M'', which is the [[hyperbolic 3-space]]. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous π<sub>1</sub>(''S'')-equivariant [[surjective]] map (now called the ''Cannon–Thurston map'') from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] (the [[2-sphere]]).\nAlthough the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of [[Mahan Mj|Mahan Mitra]],<ref>[[Mahan Mj|Mahan Mitra]].

A. Epstein, James W. Cannon, Derek F. Holt, Silvio V. Levy, Michael S. Paterson, William P. Thurston. ''Word processing in groups.'' [[Jones and Bartlett Publishers]], Boston, MA, 1992. {{ISBN|0-86720-244-0}}.</ref> which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of [[automatic group]]s. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from [[computer science]] to [[geometric group theory]] and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s.\n\nA 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the \"[[combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem]]\"<ref name=\"RM\">James W. Cannon. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9w0608p039151254/ ''The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem''.] [[Acta Mathematica]] 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155–234.</ref> that was motivated by the classic [[Riemann mapping theorem]] in [[complex analysis]]. The goal was to understand when an [[Group action (mathematics)|action]] of a group by [[homeomorphism]]s on a [[2-sphere]] is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard [[Riemann sphere]] by [[Möbius transformation]]s. The \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual [[conformal structure]] on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998<ref name=\"CS\"/> (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as [[Cannon's conjecture]], regarding characterizing [[word-hyperbolic group]]s with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in <ref name=\"CS\"/>) states that if the ideal boundary of a [[word-hyperbolic group]] ''G'' is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[2-sphere]], then ''G'' admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the [[hyperbolic 3-space]] (so that ''G'' is essentially a 3-dimensional [[Kleinian group]]). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a [[word-hyperbolic group]] ''G'' is homeomorphic to the [[2-sphere]] then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the [[Cayley graph]] of ''G'', is [[quasisymmetric map|quasisymmetric]] to the standard 2-sphere.\n\nThe 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson<ref name=\"CS\"/> gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard \"disks\" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial \"conformal\" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper<ref name=\"RM\"/> played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.<ref>J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry.

Although the [[Geometrization conjecture]] was recently settled by [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]], Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in [[geometric group theory]] and [[geometric topology]].\n\n===Applications to biology===\nThe ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\",<ref name=\"RM\"/> were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.<ref name=\"biol\">J.

He did research on [[finite geometry|finite geometries]] and the [[group theory]] related to them, [[Cremona transformation]]s associated with the [[Galois theory]] of equations, and the relations between [[hyperelliptic curve|hyperelliptic]] [[theta function]]s, irrational binary invariants, the Weddle surface and the [[Kummer surface]]. He was President of the [[American Mathematical Society]] from 1933 to 1934.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nArthur Coble was born on November 3, 1878 in [[Williamstown, Pennsylvania]]. His mother Emma was a schoolteacher. When Coble was born, his father Ruben was the manager of a store. Later, he became president of a bank. Coble's parents belonged to Evangelical Lutheran Church. Coble was brought up strictly as an Evangelical Lutheran; however, he rejected this Church when he reached adulthood.<ref name=\"MT Bio\">{{MacTutor Biography|id=Coble}}</ref>\n\nCoble entered [[Gettysburg College]] in 1893, and completed his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in 1897. He spent a year as a public school teacher. He entered [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1898 to pursue his graduate studies. He completed his Ph.D. from the university in 1902. His [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis was ''The Relation of the Quartic Curve to Conics''. His thesis supervisor was English-born mathematician [[Frank Morley]].<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/> Later, Coble recalled how Morley made it \"a cardinal point to have on hand a sufficient variety of thesis problems to accommodate particular tastes and capacities.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Emergence of the American Mathematical Research Community, 1876-1900: J.J.

Rowe |year=1997 |publisher=AMS Bookstore\n |location= |isbn=0-8218-0907-5 |pages=443 }}</ref>\n\n===Academic career===\nIn 1902, Coble became an instructor in mathematics at the [[University of Missouri]]. One year later, in 1903, he was appointed to Johns Hopkins University as Morley's research assistant. In 1903, he published his doctoral dissertation as ''The quartic curve as related to conics'' in the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society'' and took up the research assistant position in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. In 1902, American businessman [[Andrew Carnegie]] founded the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. The research of Coble and Morley were one of the first pieces of research the Institution supported. The funding of the Institute was generous enough to allow Coble to use the grant to travel abroad. He traveled to [[Germany]] where he studied at Greifswald University and the [[University of Bonn]]. He wanted to work with [[Eduard Study]], who was well known to mathematicians at Johns Hopkins University because he had taught there in 1893.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\nCoble returned to the United States for the start of the 1904-05 session. He was appointed an instructor in mathematics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCoble married Abby Walker Adams Whitney in 1905. They had four children.\n\nCoble was promoted to associate professor at Johns Hopkins University in 1909. He left Johns Hopkins after he was offered a full professorship at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC) in 1918. He remained at Illinois for the rest of his career. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1919 and was at Johns Hopkins University in 1927-28. He became head of the Department of Mathematics at the UIUC in 1934 and he held that position until his retirement in 1947.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/> During these years, Coble served on many University and College Committees, including eleven years on the University Council and eight years on the Executive Committee of the [[UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=\"BAMS\">{{cite journal | last =Mattuck | first =Arthur | authorlink = | year =1970 | month = | title =Arthur Byron Coble | journal =Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society | volume =76 | issue =4 | pages =693–699 | id = | url =http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&version=1.0&service=UI&handle=euclid.bams/1183532070&page=record | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | doi =10.1090/S0002-9904-1970-12509-5 }}</ref>\n\n===American Mathematical Society===\nCoble was active with the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) from 1912 to 1940.<ref name=\"BAMS\"/> He was vice-president of the AMS in 1917. From 1920 to 1925, he edited the ''Transactions of the American Mathematical Society''. He also was involved with editing the ''American Journal of Mathematics'' over many years between 1918 and 1933. From 1933 to 1934, he was President of the AMS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ams.org/ams/22-coble.html |title=AMS Presidents: A Timeline |accessdate=2008-06-07 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160746/http://www.ams.org/ams/22-coble.html| archivedate= 12 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> At that time, the AMS was in some financial difficulties. Coble dealt with the problem effectively.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\n===Later life===\nBy the time he retired in 1947 his health was already deteriorating due to Parkinson's disease. After his retirement, he accepted a one-year post at [[Haverford College]] but after teaching for one semester he resigned due to poor health. In 1956, he was involved in a car crash. Because of that crash, he was unable to walk without assistance.  He then moved to [[Lykens, Pennsylvania]] and spent his final ten years of his life there. He died on December 8, 1966 in a hospital in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\n==Research==\nEarly mathematical research papers written by Coble when he was teaching at Johns Hopkins University, include: ''On the relation between the three-parameter groups of a cubic space curve and a quadric surface'' (1906); ''An application of the form-problems associated with certain Cremona groups to the solution of equations of higher degree'' (1908); ''An application of Moore's cross-ratio group to the solution of the sextic equation'' (1911); ''An application of finite geometry to the characteristic theory of the odd and even theta functions'' (1913); and ''Point sets and allied Cremona groups'' (1915).<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/><ref name=\"BAMS\"/>\n\nCoble was interested in finite geometries and the related [[group theory]], and in the Cremona transformations related to the [[Galois theory]] of equations. Later in his career, Coble also studied the relations between [[hyperelliptic curve|hyperelliptic]] [[theta function]]s, [[irrational binary invariant]]s, the [[Weddle surface]] and the [[Kummer surface]].<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\nCoble published the monograph ''Algebraic geometry and theta functions'' in the tenth volume of ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications'' in 1929, and it was republished by the American Mathematical Society in 1961 and 1982.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\nCoble published ''Configurations defined by theta functions'',<ref name=\"BAMS\"/> which reviewed the invariant theory of Cremona transformations as developed by Coble in his earlier papers, in the ''[[Duke Mathematical Journal]]'' in 1939. A linear homogeneous transformation with integral coefficients is associated with a Cremona transformation. These transformations form a group, which Coble studied.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\nIn 1940, Coble published ''Trilinear forms'' in the ''Duke Mathematical Journal''.<ref name=\"BAMS\"/> In 1946, he published ''Ternary and quaternary elimination'',<ref name=\"BAMS\"/> which extends work by mathematicians [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay]] and [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden]], and also extends work done by Frank Morley and Coble some 20 years earlier.<ref name=\"MT Bio\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Coble curve]]\n*[[Coble surface]]\n*[[Coble variety]]\n*[[Coble hypersurface]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MathGenealogy|id=5647}}\n* [http://www.library.uiuc.edu/archives/archon/index.php?p=collections/controlcard&id=3870 Arthur B.

Dehn's students include [[Ott-Heinrich Keller]], [[Ruth Moufang]], [[Wilhelm Magnus]], and the artist [[Dorothea Rockburne]].\n\n==Biography==\nDehn was born to a [[Jewish]] family<ref>Bergmann, Birgit and  Moritz Epple, and Ruti Ungar [https://books.google.com/books?id=7z8DTwXGO-oC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=Max+Dehn+jew&source=bl&ots=tMCFpFtkJH&sig=gLjgDwg7sGSqlzm76k8OUaiThaU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5wgGUte0F6WbygHrtoG4AQ&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Max%20Dehn%20&f=false \"Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture\"] 2012</ref> in [[Hamburg]], [[Imperial Germany]].\n\nHe studied the foundations of [[geometry]] with [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] at [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] in 1899, and obtained a proof of the [[Jordan curve theorem]] for [[polygon]]s. In 1900 he wrote his dissertation on the role of the [[Saccheri–Legendre theorem|Legendre angle sum theorem]] in axiomatic geometry. \nFrom 1900 to 1911 he was an employee and researcher at the [[University of Münster]]. In his [[habilitation]] at the [[University of Münster]] in 1900 he resolved [[Hilbert's third problem]], by introducing what was afterwards called the [[Dehn invariant]]. This was the first resolution of one of the [[Hilbert problems|Hilbert Problems]].\n\nDehn's interests later turned to [[topology]] and [[combinatorial group theory]]. In 1907 he wrote with [[Poul Heegaard]] the first book on the foundations of [[combinatorial topology]], then known as ''analysis situs''. Also in 1907, he described the construction of a new [[homology sphere]]. In 1908 he believed that he had found a proof of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], but [[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze]] found an error.\n\nIn 1910 Dehn published a paper on three-dimensional topology in which he introduced [[Dehn surgery]] and used it to construct homology spheres. He also stated [[Dehn's lemma]], but an error was found in his proof by [[Hellmuth Kneser]] in 1929. The result was proved in 1957 by [[Christos Papakyriakopoulos]]. The [[word problem for groups]], also called the '''Dehn problem''', was posed by him in 1911.\n\nDehn married Antonie Landau on August 23, 1912. Also in 1912, Dehn invented what is now known as [[Dehn's algorithm]] and used it in his work on the word and [[conjugacy problem|conjugacy]] problems for [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. The notion of a [[Dehn function]] in [[geometric group theory]], which estimates the area of a relation in a [[finitely presented group]] in terms of the length of that relation, is also named after him. In 1914 he proved that the left and right [[trefoil knot]]s are not equivalent. In the early 1920s Dehn introduced the result that would come to be known as the [[Dehn-Nielsen theorem]]; its proof would be published in 1927 by [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]].\n\nIn 1922 Dehn succeeded [[Ludwig Bieberbach]] at Frankfurt, where he stayed until he was forced to retire in 1935. He stayed in Germany until January 1939, when he fled to Copenhagen, and then to Trondheim, Norway, where he took a position at the [[Norwegian Institute of Technology]]. In October 1940 he left Norway for America by way of Siberia and Japan (the Atlantic crossing was considered too dangerous).\n\nIn America, Dehn obtained a position at Idaho Southern University (now [[Idaho State University]]). In 1942 he took a job at the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], and in 1943 he moved to [[St. John's College (Annapolis/Santa Fe)|St. John's College]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. Finally in 1945, he moved to the experimental arts college, [[Black Mountain College]], where he was the only mathematician.\n\nHe died in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina|Black Mountain]], [[North Carolina]] in 1952.\n\n==Black Mountain College==\nIn March 1944, Dehn was invited to give two talks at Black Mountain College on the philosophy and history of mathematics. He noted in a letter that a lecture on an advanced mathematical topic didn't seem appropriate given the audience. He instead offered up the lectures \"Common roots of mathematics and ornamentics,\" and \"Some moments in the development of mathematical ideas.\" Black Mountain College faculty contacted him shortly after concerning a full-time position. After negotiating his salary from $25 to $40 per month, Dehn and his wife moved into housing provided by the school and he began teaching in January 1945.\n\nWhile at Black Mountain College, Dehn taught courses in Mathematics, Philosophy, Greek, and Italian. In his class \"Geometry for Artists,\" Dehn introduced students to geometric concepts such as [[point (geometry)|points]], [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[plane (geometry)|planes]] and [[polyhedron|solids]]; [[cone (geometry)|cones]] sectioned into [[circle]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[parabola]]s, and [[hyperbola]]s; [[N-sphere|spheres]] and [[regular polyhedron]]s. His classes had an emphasis on the way shapes relate to each other, a concept that can be useful in artistic mediums.\n\nHe enjoyed the forested mountains found in Black Mountain, and would often hold class in the woods, giving lectures during hikes. His lectures frequently drifted off topic on tangents about philosophy, the arts, and nature and their connection to mathematics. He and his wife took part in community meetings and often ate in the dining room. They also regularly had long breakfasts with [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his wife.\n\nIn the summer of 1952 Dehn was made [[Professor Emeritus]], which allowed him to remain on campus and act as an advisor. Unfortunately he died of an [[embolism]] shortly after witnessing the removal of several [[dogwood]] trees from the campus.<ref name=yandell>{{Cite book| last = Yandell| first = Benjamin H. | title = The Honors Class: Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers  | publisher =  A K Peters | year = 2002  | location = Natick, Massachusetts  | pages = 134–135  | isbn = 978-1568812168}}</ref>  He is buried in the woods on the campus.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cauchy's theorem (geometry)|Cauchy's theorem]]\n*[[Dehn's lemma]]\n*[[Dehn plane]]\n*[[Dehn surgery]]\n*[[Dehn twist]]\n*[[Dehn–Sommerville equations]]\n*[[Scissors congruence]] (Dehn invariant)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* Max Dehn, ''Papers on group theory and topology''.

He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis, supervised by [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics.<ref name=\"Bio\" /> Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to [[Zürich]] to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the [[ETH Zurich|Eidgenössische Polytechnikum]]. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Zürich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].\n\n==Contributions to group theory==\n[[Group theory]] was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first  contributions was the proof of the [[Sylow theorems]] for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for [[permutation group]]s. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.\n\n* Frobenius also has proved the following fundamental theorem: If a positive integer ''n'' divides the order |''G''| of a [[finite group]] ''G'', then the number of solutions of the equation ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in ''G'' is equal to ''kn'' for some positive integer&nbsp;''k''. He also posed the following problem: If, in the above theorem, ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, then the solutions of the equation ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 in ''G'' form a subgroup. Many years ago this problem was solved for [[solvable group]]s.<ref>{{cite book |first=Marshall, Jr. |last=Hall |title=The Theory of Groups |edition=2nd |location=Providence, Rhode Island |publisher=AMS Chelsea |year=1999 |pages=145–146 |isbn=0-8218-1967-4 }} {{Google books |id=oyxnWF9ssI8C |page=145 |title=Theorem 9.4.1. }}</ref> Only in 1991, after the [[classification of finite simple groups]], this problem was solved in general.\n\nMore important was his creation of the theory of [[Character theory|group characters]] and [[group representation]]s, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of [[Character theory|Frobenius reciprocity]] and the definition of what are now called [[Frobenius group]]s.  A group ''G'' is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup ''H''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''G'' such that\n:<math>H\\cap H^x=\\{1\\}</math> for all <math>x\\in G-H</math>.\n\nIn that case, the set\n:<math>N=G\\,-\\!\\!\\bigcup_{x\\in G-H}\\!\\!H^x</math>\n\ntogether with the identity element of ''G'' forms a subgroup which is [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] as [[John G. Thompson]] showed in 1959.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF01162958| title = Normalp-complements for finite groups| journal = Mathematische Zeitschrift| volume = 72| pages = 332| year = 1959| last1 = Thompson | first1 = J. G. }}</ref> All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group <math>PSL(2,p)</math> of order (1/2)(''p''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;−&nbsp;p) for all odd primes&nbsp;''p'' (this group is simple provided&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3). He also made fundamental contributions to the [[representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups]].\n\n==Contributions to number theory==\n\nFrobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into [[conjugacy classes]] in [[Galois group]]s over '''Q'''.  Specifically, if ''K''/'''Q''' is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime ''p'' which does not [[Ramification (mathematics)|ramify]] in ''K'' and to each prime ideal ''P'' lying over ''p'' in ''K'' there is a unique element ''g'' of Gal(''K''/'''Q''') satisfying the condition ''g''(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x''<sup>''p''</sup>&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''P'') for all integers ''x'' of ''K''. Varying ''P'' over ''p'' changes ''g'' into a conjugate (and every conjugate of ''g'' occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of ''g'' in the Galois group is canonically associated to ''p''.  This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of ''p'' and any element of \nthe conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of ''p''.   If we take for ''K'' the ''m''th [[cyclotomic field]], whose Galois group over '''Q''' is the units modulo ''m'' (and thus \nis abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for ''p'' not dividing ''m'' the Frobenius class in the Galois group is ''p''&nbsp;mod&nbsp;''m''.   From this point of view, \nthe distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over '''Q''' (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions.   The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of '''Q''' depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of things named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]]\n\n==Publications==\n\n*{{Citation | last1=Frobenius | first1=Ferdinand Georg | author1-link=Ferdinand Georg Frobenius | title=Gesammelte Abhandlungen.

[[Charles X of France|Charles X]] had succeeded [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] in 1824, but in 1827 [[Ultra-royalist|his party]] suffered a [[1827 French legislative election|major electoral setback]] and by 1830 the [[Doctrinaires|opposition liberal party]] [[1830 French legislative election|became the majority]]. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d'état, and issued his notorious [[July Ordinances]], touching off the [[July Revolution]]<ref name=\":2\" /> which ended with [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]] becoming king. While their counterparts at the [[École Polytechnique|Polytechnique]] were making history in the streets during ''[[July Revolution|les Trois Glorieuses]]'', Galois and all the other students at the [[École Normale]] were locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the ''Gazette des Écoles'', signing the letter with his full name. Although the ''Gazette''{{'}}s editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.<ref name=\"dupuy\">{{cite journal\n  | last = Dupuy\n  | first = Paul\n  | title = La vie d'Évariste Galois\n  | journal = Annales de l'École Normale\n  | volume = 13\n  | pages = 197–266\n  | url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Livre:Dupuy_-_La_vie_d'%C3%89variste_Galois.djvu\n  | year= 1896\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois' former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.\n\nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]. The proceedings grew riotous, and Galois proposed a [[Toast (honor)|toast]] to King [[Louis Philippe I|Louis Philippe]] with a [[dagger]] above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life.

Around 4 July 1831, [[Siméon Poisson|Poisson]] declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\"<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Taton\n | first = R.\n | year = 1947\n | title = Les relations d'Évariste Galois avec les mathématiciens de son temps\n | journal = Revue d'Histoire des Sciences et de Leurs Applications\n | volume = 1\n | issue = 2\n | pages = 114–130\n | doi = 10.3406/rhs.1947.2607| url = http://www.persee.fr/doc/rhs_0048-7996_1947_num_1_2_2607\n }}</ref> While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832,<ref name=\"dupuy\" /> after which he was somehow talked into a duel.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nGalois' fatal duel took place on 30 May.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=C.|first=Bruno, Leonard|origyear=1999|year=2003|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0787638139|location=Detroit, Mich.|page=174|oclc=41497065}}</ref> The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it.

This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\"<ref name=\"dupuy\" />\n\nMuch more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by [[Eric Temple Bell]] in ''[[Men of Mathematics]]''), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.<ref name=\"bell\" />\n\nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville,<ref name=\"dumas\"/> who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest.<ref name=\"blanc\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Blanc\n  | first = Louis\n  | title = The History of Ten Years, 1830-1840, Volume 1\n  | publisher = Chapman and Hall\n  | location = London\n  | year = 1844\n  | page = 431\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=hH52mPMmlzcC&pg=PA431#v=onepage&q&f=false\n}}\n</ref> However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel's \"supposed fiancé\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges.<ref name=\"dalmas\">\n{{cite book\n  | last = Dalmas\n  | first = Andre\n  | title = Évariste Galois: Révolutionnaire et Géomètre\n  | publisher = Fasquelle\n  | location = Paris\n  | year = 1956 }}\n</ref> Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.\n\nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts.<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\">{{cite journal\n | last = Galois\n | first = Évariste\n | year = 1846\n | title = Lettre de Galois à M.

He developed the concept that is today known as a [[normal subgroup]]. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right [[coset]]s a ''proper decomposition'' if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup.<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> He also introduced the concept of a [[finite field]] (also known as a [[Galois field]] in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.<ref name=\"numtheory\" />\n\nIn his last letter to Chevalier<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:\n*He constructed the [[General linear group#Over finite fields|general linear group over a prime field]], GL(''ν'', ''p'') and computed its order, in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree ''p<sup>ν</sup>''.<ref>Letter, p. 410</ref>\n*He constructed the [[projective special linear group]] PSL(2,''p'').

He realized that the algebraic solution to a [[polynomial]] equation is related to the structure of a group of [[permutation]]s associated with the roots of the polynomial, the [[Galois group]] of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in [[nth root|radicals]] if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with [[abelian group|abelian]] quotient, or its Galois group is [[solvable group|solvable]]. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the [[theory of equations]] to which Galois originally applied it.<ref name=\"lie\" />\n\n=== Analysis ===\nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of [[Abelian integral]]s and [[continued fraction]]s.\n\nAs written in his last letter,<ref name=\"chevalier-letter\" /> Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.\n\n=== Continued fractions ===\nIn his first paper in 1828,<ref name=\"continuedfraction\" /> Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd ''ζ'' is purely periodic if and only if ''ζ'' is a [[Periodic continued fraction#Reduced surds|reduced surd]], that is, <math>\\zeta > 1</math> and its [[Conjugate (algebra)|conjugate]] <math>\\eta</math>\nsatisfies <math>-1 < \\eta < 0</math>.\n\nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if ''ζ'' is a reduced quadratic surd and ''η'' is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for ''ζ'' and for (&minus;1/''η'') are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other.

In this context he proved [[Gromov's compactness theorem (geometry)|Gromov's compactness theorem]], stating that the set of compact [[Riemannian manifold]]s with [[Ricci curvature]] ≥ ''c'' and [[diameter]] ≤ ''D'' is [[relatively compact]] in the Gromov–Hausdorff metric. The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are [[Alexandrov space]]s of curvature ≥ ''c'', a class of [[metric space]]s studied in detail by [[Yuri Burago|Burago]], Gromov and [[Grigori Perelman|Perelman]] in 1992.  Gromov was also the first to study the space of all possible Riemannian structures on a given manifold.\n\nGromov is known as well for the Gromov-Lees Theorem, named for him and Jack Alexander Lees, concerning Lagrangian immersions and a one-to-one correspondence between the connected components of spaces. <ref>https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz_1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&dq=Gromov-Lees+theorem&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji2oGBq_bhAhVPXK0KHRBJDmsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Gromov-Lees%20theorem&f=false</ref>\n\nGromov introduced [[geometric group theory]], the study of [[infinite group]]s via the geometry of their [[Cayley graph]]s and their [[word metric]]. In 1981 he proved [[Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth]]: a [[finitely generated group]] has [[Growth rate (group theory)|polynomial growth]] (a geometric property) if and only if it is [[virtually nilpotent]] (an algebraic property). The proof uses the Gromov–Hausdorff metric mentioned above. Along with [[Eliyahu Rips]] he introduced the notion of [[hyperbolic group]]s.\n\nGromov founded the field of [[symplectic topology]] by introducing the theory of [[pseudoholomorphic curves]]. This led to [[Gromov–Witten invariant]]s which are used in [[string theory]] and to his [[non-squeezing theorem]].\n\nGromov is also interested in [[mathematical biology]],<ref name=\":0\">{{citation|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201003/rtx100300391p.pdf|title=Interview with Mikhail Gromov|journal=[[Notices of the AMS]]|date=March 2010|volume=57|issue=3|pages=391–403}}.</ref> the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.<ref name=\"simons\" />\n\n==Prizes and honors==\n\n===Prizes===\n*[[Prize of the Mathematical Society of Moscow]] (1971)\n*[[Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry]] ([[American Mathematical Society|AMS]]) (1981)\n*[[Elie Cartan Prize|Prix Elie Cartan]] de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris (1984)\n*[[Prix de l'Union des Assurances de Paris]] (1989)\n*[[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]] (1993)\n*[[Leroy P.

His ''Endliche Gruppen'' ([[finite group]]s) is an influential textbook in group theory, and he has over 50 doctoral descendants.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Education===\nBertram Huppert went to school in [[Bonn]] from 1934 until 1945. In 1950, he wrote his diploma thesis in mathematics at the [[University of Mainz]].  The thesis discussed \"''nicht fortsetzbare Potenzreihen''\" (discontinuous power series), and was written under the direction of [[Helmut Wielandt]].\n\nWhen Wielandt moved to the [[University of Tübingen]] in April 1951, Huppert followed him later in the year, and gained his doctorate (as Wielandt's first doctoral student) with the work \"''Produkte von paarweise vertauschbaren zyklischen Gruppen\"'' (products of pairwise [[permutable subgroup|permutable]] [[cyclic group]]s), in which he showed, among other things, that such groups were [[supersoluble group|supersoluble]]. This was the first of more than forty further scientific works, not including his books and [[monograph]]s. The focus of the dissertation was very close to Wielandt's interests at the time, whose 1951 work shows that the product of pairwise [[permutable subgroup|permutable]] [[nilpotent group]]s is [[solvable group|solvable]].\n\n===Academic career===\nHuppert spent the years 1963/64 as a visiting professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. In January 1965, he became a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Mainz, where he later became a [[professor emeritus]] in 1994. He put a lot of effort into building up the Mainz [[group theory]] and [[abstract algebra]] research groups.\n\nFollowing an assignment, he wrote a monumental standard text in the theory of [[finite groups]], ''Endliche Gruppen I''. The group around [[Wolfgang Gaschütz]] in [[Kiel]] provided important contributions in discussions to that volume. Volumes II and III appeared 14 years later in English with co-author [[Norman Blackburn (mathematician)|Norman Blackburn]].\n\nIn 1984, Huppert founded, together with [[Gerhard Michler]], the first [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] priority programme in Mathematics at the German universities of [[RWTH Aachen|Aachen]], [[University of Bielefeld|Bielefeld]], [[University of Duisburg-Essen|Essen]] and [[University of Mainz|Mainz]].\n\nFrom 1964 to 1985, Huppert was a member of the editorial board of the [[Journal of Algebra]]. Together with [[Wolfgang Gaschütz]] and [[Karl W. Gruenberg]], he organised [[Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach|Oberwolfach]] workshops on group theory over many years, and with Michler the Oberwolfach workshop on representation theory.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Institute of Experimental Mathematics of the University of Essen and is a member of the ''Akademie gemeinnütziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt''.\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n* Endliche Gruppen (Springer, 1967) {{ISBN|978-3-540-03825-2}}\n* Finite Groups II, III (with N.

The first few sporadic simple groups were discovered by [[Émile Léonard Mathieu]], which were then called the [[Mathieu group]]s. It was after 90 years of the discovery of the last Mathieu group that Zvonimir Janko constructed a new sporadic simple group in 1964. In his honour, this group is now called J<sub>1</sub>. This discovery launched the modern theory of sporadic groups and it was an important milestone in the [[classification of finite simple groups]].\n\n==Biography==\nJanko was born in [[Bjelovar]], Croatia.  He studied at the [[University of Zagreb]] where he received Ph.D. in 1960.  He then taught physics at a high school in [[Široki Brijeg]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

His advisor was [[Richard Brauer]], and his student [[Rimhak Ree]] discovered two infinite series of finite simple groups known as the [[Ree group]]s.  Jennings was an editor of [[Mathematics Magazine]] and an acting president of the [[University of Victoria]].\n\n==Biography==\nStephen was born in [[Walthamstow]], [[England]] and immigrated to [[Canada]] with his family in 1928.  He had been receiving scholarships in England and these were transferred to Canada.   He finished his high school education in [[Toronto]] and in September 1932 he went to University College in Toronto.   In 1939 he received his PHD from the [[University of Toronto]].   He married Dorothy Freeda Rintoul (University of Western University - B.A. and University of Toronto M.A. Psychology) in 1939.  On November 14, 1942 he became a Member of the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity.  When he was made a professor, he was the youngest professor ever appointed in Canada. In 1944 Stephen was appointed 2nd Lieutenant (Paymaster) in Canadian Army.   While in [[Vancouver]], teaching at the [[University of British Columbia]], Stephen and Dorothy established their family,  two children, Judith Anne Jennings and James Stephen Jennings.  Stephen was Dean of Graduate Studies  at the [[University of Victoria]] and the Head of the Mathematics Department there.\n\n== Selected bibliography ==\n\n* {{Citation | doi=10.4153/CJM-1958-029-2 | last1=Chang | first1=Bomshik | last2=Jennings | first2=S.

In his schooling at the Bolton Grammar School, he studied classics, but no mathematics was taught in the school. He was recognised as the best scholar at the school, and the local vicar guaranteed him a scholarship at Cambridge, but his father would not allow him to go. Instead, he left school at age 14 to work in his father's office.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\nNine years later, defying his father, he went to [[Trinity College Dublin]], working as a private tutor to support himself during his studies. There, among other subjects, he first began learning mathematics. He earned a B.A. in 1833 and returned to England in 1835.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n==Ordination and ministry==\nOn his return to England, Kirkman was ordained into the ministry of the [[Church of England]] and became the [[curate]] in [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] and then in [[Lymm]]. In 1839 he was invited to become [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[Christ Church, Croft|Croft with Southworth]], a newly founded parish in [[Lancashire]], where he would stay for 52 years until his retirement in 1892. Theologically, Kirkman supported the [[Biblical literalism|anti-literalist]] position of [[John William Colenso]], and was also strongly opposed to [[materialism]]. He published many tracts and pamphlets on theology, as well as a book ''Philosophy Without Assumptions'' (1876).<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\nKirkman married Eliza Wright in 1841; they had seven children. To support them, Kirkman supplemented his income with tutoring, until Eliza inherited enough property to secure their living. The rectorship itself did not demand much from Kirkman, so from this point forward he had time to devote to mathematics.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/>\n\nKirkman died 4 February 1895 in [[Bowdon, Greater Manchester|Bowdon]]. His wife died ten days later.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n==Mathematics==\nKirkman's first mathematical publication was in the ''Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal'' in 1846, on a problem involving [[Steiner triple system]]s that had been published two years earlier in ''[[The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary]]'' by [[Wesley S. B. Woolhouse]].<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/> Despite Kirkman's and Woolhouse's contributions to the problem, Steiner triple systems were named after [[Jakob Steiner]] who wrote a later paper in 1853.<ref name=\"biggs\"/> Kirkman's second research paper, in 1848, concerned [[#Pluquaternions|pluquaternions]].\n\nIn 1848, Kirkman published ''First Mnemonical Lessons'', a book on mathematical [[mnemonic]]s for schoolchildren. It was not successful, and [[Augustus de Morgan]] criticised it as \"the most curious crochet I ever saw\".<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n===Kirkman's schoolgirl problem===\nNext, in 1849, Kirkman studied the [[Pascal's theorem|Pascal lines]] determined by the intersection points of opposite sides of a [[hexagon]] inscribed within a [[conic section]]. Any six points on a conic may be joined into a hexagon in 60 different ways, forming 60 different Pascal lines. Extending previous work of Steiner, Kirkman showed that these lines intersect in triples to form 60 points (now known as the Kirkman points), so that each line contains three of the points and each point lies on three of the lines. That is, these lines and points form a [[projective configuration]] of type 60<sub>3</sub>60<sub>3</sub>.<ref name=\"biggs\"/>\n\nIn 1850, Kirkman observed that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which he set out as a puzzle in ''The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary'':\n{{quote|text=Fifteen young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily, so that no two shall walk twice abreast.}}\nThis problem became known as [[Kirkman's schoolgirl problem]], subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"macfarlane\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n===Pluquaternions===\nIn 1848 Kirkman wrote \"On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of ''n'' Squares\".<ref>[[London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine]] 1848, p 447 [http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kolJAAAAYAAJ  Google books link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140617191332/http://www.books.google.com/books?id=kolJAAAAYAAJ |date=17 June 2014 }}</ref>\nGeneralizing the [[quaternion]]s and [[octonion]]s, Kirkman called a '''pluquaternion''' Q<sub>a</sub> a representative of a system with ''a'' imaginary units, ''a'' > 3.\nKirkman's paper was dedicated to confirming Cayley's assertions concerning two equations among triple-products of units as sufficient to determine the system in case ''a'' = 3 but not ''a'' = 4.<ref>A.

Crilly (2006) ''Arthur Cayley: Mathematician Laureate of the Victorian Era'', [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], p. 143 on Kirkman's collaboration with Cayley</ref> By 1900 these number systems were called [[hypercomplex number]]s, and later treated as part of the theory of [[associative algebra]]s.\n\n===Polyhedral combinatorics===\nBeginning in 1853, Kirkman began working on [[combinatorial enumeration]] problems concerning [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], beginning with a proof of [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] and concentrating on simple polyhedra (the polyhedra in which each vertex has three incident edges). He also studied [[Hamiltonian cycle]]s in polyhedra, and provided an example of a polyhedron with no Hamiltonian cycle, prior to the work of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] on the [[Icosian game]]. He [[graph enumeration|enumerated]] [[cubic graph|cubic]] [[Halin graph]]s, over a century before the work of Halin on these graphs.<ref>{{citation|first=Th. P.|last=Kirkman|title=On the enumeration of ''x''-edra having triedral summits and an (''x''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-gonal base|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|year=1856|pages=399–411|jstor=108592|doi=10.1098/rstl.1856.0018 }}.</ref> He showed that every polyhedron can be generated from a pyramid by face-splitting and vertex-splitting operations, and he studied [[self-dual polyhedron|self-dual polyhedra]].<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n===Late work===\nKirkman was inspired to work in [[group theory]] by a prize offered beginning in 1858 (but in the end never awarded) by the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. His contributions in this area include an enumeration of the transitive [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]]s on sets of up to ten elements. However, as with much of his work on polyhedra, Kirkman's work in this area was weighed down by newly invented terminology and, perhaps because of this, did not significantly influence later researchers.<ref name=\"biggs\"/><ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\nIn the early 1860s, Kirkman fell out with the mathematical establishment and in particular with [[Arthur Cayley]] and [[James Joseph Sylvester]], over the poor reception of his works on polyhedra and groups and over issues of priority. Much of his later mathematical work was published (often in [[doggerel]]) in the problem section of the ''Educational Times'' and in the obscure ''Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool''.<ref name=\"biggs\"/> However, in 1884 he began serious work on [[knot theory]], and with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] published an enumeration of the knots with up to ten crossings.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/> He remained active in mathematics even after retirement, until his death in 1895.<ref name=\"mactutor\"/>\n\n==Awards and honours==\nIn 1857, Kirkman was elected as a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] for his research on pluquaternions and partitions.<ref name=\"biggs\"/> He was also an honorary member of the\nLiterary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, and a foreign member of the [[Koninklijke Hollandsche Maatschappij der Wetenschappen|Dutch Society of Science]].<ref name=\"macfarlane\"/>\n\nSince 1994, the [[Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications]] has handed out an annual Kirkman medal, named after Kirkman, to recognise outstanding combinatorial research by a mathematician within four years of receiving a doctorate.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kirkman, Thomas}}\n[[Category:1806 births]]\n[[Category:1895 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Bolton]]\n[[Category:19th-century English mathematicians]]\n[[Category:Combinatorialists]]\n[[Category:Group theorists]]\n[[Category:Topologists]]\n[[Category:Geometers]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Royal Society]]\n[[Category:19th-century English Anglican priests]]"

His 1872 [[Erlangen program|Erlangen Program]], classifying geometries by their basic [[symmetry group]]s, was an influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the time.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Felix Klein, Leipzig years.png|thumb|upright|Klein during his Leipzig period.]]\nFelix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in [[Düsseldorf]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Snyder, Virgil|authorlink=Virgil Snyder|title=Klein's Collected Works|journal=[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society|Bull.

At that time, [[Julius Plücker]] had Bonn's professorship of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, during 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Plücker, from the University of Bonn during 1868.\n\nPlücker died during 1868, leaving his book concerning the basis of [[line geometry]] incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Plücker's ''Neue Geometrie des Raumes'', and thus became acquainted with [[Alfred Clebsch]], who had relocated to Göttingen during 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the next year, along with visits to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]]. During July 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a brief time he served as a medical orderly in the [[Prussian army]] before being appointed lecturer at Göttingen during early 1871.\n\n[[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] appointed Klein professor during 1872, when he was only 23 years old.<ref>{{cite book|editor=[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]]|title=Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics 1640–1940|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UdGBy8iLpocC&pg=PA546|year=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-045744-4|page=546}}</ref> For this, he was endorsed by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the best mathematician of his time. Klein did not desire a school at Erlangen where there were few students, and so he was pleased to be offered a professorship at [[Munich]]'s Technische Hochschule during 1875. There he and [[Alexander von Brill]] taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including,  [[Adolf Hurwitz]], [[Walther von Dyck]], [[Karl Rohn]], [[Carl Runge]], [[Max Planck]], [[Luigi Bianchi]], and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]].\n\nDuring 1875 Klein married Anne Hegel, the granddaughter of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>Chislenko, Eugene; Tschinkel, Yuri.

There his colleagues included [[Walther von Dyck]], Rohn, [[Eduard Study]] and [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]]. Klein's years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. During 1882, his health collapsed; during 1883–1884, he was plagued by depression.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pTwBwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=david+hilbert&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj6_Jfz1sPiAhXQnOAKHZJYCBA4ChDoAQgpMAA#v=onepage&q=mental&f=false|title=Hilbert|last=Reid|first=Constance|date=|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1996|isbn=9781461207399|location=New York|pages=19|language=en}}</ref> Nonetheless his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions dates from around this period, being published during 1886 and 1888.\n\nKlein accepted a professorship at the [[University of Göttingen]] during 1886. From then until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish Göttingen as the world's main mathematics research center. Yet he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to Göttingen his own primacy as a developer of [[geometry]]. At Göttingen, he taught a variety of courses, mainly concerning the interface between mathematics and physics, such as [[mechanics]] and [[potential theory]].\n\nThe research facility Klein established at Göttingen served as a model for the best such facilities throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. During 1895, Klein hired [[David Hilbert]] away from the [[University of Königsberg]]; this appointment proved fateful, because Hilbert continued Göttingen's good reputation until his own retirement during 1932.\n\nWith Klein's editorship, ''[[Mathematische Annalen]]'' became one of the best mathematics journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, only with Klein's management did it first rival then surpass ''[[Crelle's Journal]]'' based in the [[University of Berlin]]. Klein established a small team of editors who met regularly, making democratic decisions. The journal specialized in [[complex analysis]], [[algebraic geometry]], and [[invariant theory]] (at least until Hilbert ended the subject). It also provided an important outlet for [[real analysis]] and the new [[group theory]].\n\nDuring 1893 in Chicago, Klein was a major speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held as part of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=Case, Bettye Anne|editor-link=Bettye Anne Case|title=A Century of Mathematical Meetings|chapter=''Come to the Fair: The Chicago Mathematical Congress of 1893'' by David E.

He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at Göttingen by a woman; she was [[Grace Chisholm Young]], an English student of [[Arthur Cayley]]'s, whom Klein admired. During 1897 Klein became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001270 |title=Felix C.

During 1905, he was decisive in formulating a plan recommending that [[analytic geometry]], the rudiments of differential and integral [[calculus]], and the [[Function (mathematics)|function]] concept be taught in secondary schools.<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Gary McCulloch|editor2=David Crook|title=The Routledge International Encyclopedia of Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dCMuAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA373|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-85358-9|page=373}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1=Alexander Karp|editor2=Gert Schubring|title=Handbook on the History of Mathematics Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MYy9BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA499|year=2014|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-9155-2|pages=499–500}}</ref> This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world.

He was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] during 1885, and was awarded its [[Copley Medal]] during 1912. He retired the next year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for some years more.\n\nKlein was one of the 93 signatories of the [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]], a document penned in support of the German invasion of Belgium in the early stages of [[World War I]].\n\nKlein had the title of [[Geheimrat]] (trusted-advisor).\n\nHe died in Göttingen during 1925.\n\n==Work==\nKlein's dissertation, on [[line geometry]] and its applications to [[mechanics]], classified second degree line complexes using [[Weierstrass]]'s theory of elementary divisors.\n\nKlein's first important mathematical discoveries were made during 1870. In collaboration with [[Sophus Lie]], he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the [[Kummer surface]]. They later investigated [[W-curve]]s, curves invariant under a group of [[projective transformation]]s. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to have a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from [[Camille Jordan]].<ref>{{MacTutor Biography|id=Klein}}</ref>\n[[Image:Acme klein bottle.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A hand-blown Klein Bottle]]\nKlein devised the \"[[Klein bottle]]\" named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the \"inside\".

Retrieved on 04 December 2014 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830902326.html</ref> During 1894, he initiated the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the [[Klein's encyclopedia|Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften]]. This enterprise, which endured until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] (2009) ''Routes of Learning: Highways, Pathways, Byways in the History of Mathematics'', pp 44, 45, 90,  [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], {{isbn|0-8018-9248-1}}</ref>\n\n===Erlangen program===\n{{main article|Erlangen program}}\nDuring 1871, while at Göttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers ''On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry'' showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered [[metric space]]s determined by a [[Cayley-Klein metric]]. This insight had the corollary that [[non-Euclidean geometry]] was consistent if and only if [[Euclidean geometry]] was, giving the same status to geometries Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and ending all controversy about non-Euclidean geometry. [[Arthur Cayley]] never accepted Klein's argument, believing it to be circular.\n\nKlein's synthesis of [[geometry]] as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given [[transformation group|group of transformations]], known as the ''[[Erlangen program|Erlangen Program]]'' (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was initiated by Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified system of geometry that has become the accepted modern method. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of [[transformation group|transformation]]s that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nPresently the significance of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now considered strange or wrong. On the contrary, those contributions have become so much a part of our present mathematical thinking that it is difficult for us to appreciate their novelty, and the way in which they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries.\n\n===Complex analysis===\nKlein saw his work on [[complex analysis]] as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:\n*The link between certain ideas of [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]'s and [[invariant theory]],\n*[[Number theory]] and [[abstract algebra]];\n*[[Group theory]];\n*[[Geometry]] with more than 3 dimensions and [[differential equations]], especially equations he invented, namely [[elliptic modular function]]s and [[automorphic function]]s.\n\nKlein showed that the [[modular group]] moves the fundamental region of the [[complex plane]] so as to [[tessellation|tessellate]] that plane. During 1879, he examined the action of [[PSL(2,7)]], considered as an image of the [[modular group]], and obtained an explicit representation of a [[Riemann surface]] now termed the [[Klein quartic]]. He showed that that surface was a curve in [[projective space]], that its equation was ''x''<sup>3</sup>''y''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''y''<sup>3</sup>''z''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''z''<sup>3</sup>''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and that its group of [[symmetry group|symmetries]] was [[PSL(2,7)]] of [[order (group theory)|order]] 168. His ''Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale'' (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting [[potential theory]] and [[conformal mapping]]s. This work drew on notions from [[fluid dynamics]].\n\nKlein considered equations of degree > 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on the methods of [[Charles Hermite]] and [[Leopold Kronecker]], he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and later completely solved the problem by means of the [[icosahedral group]]. This work enabled him to write a series of papers on [[elliptic modular function]]s.\n\nIn his 1884 book on the [[icosahedron]], Klein established a theory of [[automorphic function]]s, associating algebra and geometry. However [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions during 1881, which resulted in a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand [[uniformization theorem]] that would establish the new theory more completely. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in describing a strategy for proving it.

However, he got one of the highest marks in the country in the 1961 [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Certificate]] mathematics examination, thereby earning a state scholarship to university.<ref name=interview/>\n\nHe attended [[University College Galway]], earning bachelors (1964) and masters (1965) degrees in mathematical science and also winning a [[National University of Ireland]] Traveling Studentship Prize.  In 1968 he was awarded the D.Phil by the [[University of Sussex]] for a thesis on ”Structure Theorems for Linear Groups\" done under advisor [[Walter Ledermann]].<ref>{{MathGenealogy |id=132594}}</ref>\n\nHe immediately joined the staff at University College Dublin, from which he officially retired in 2009, but he has continued to publish regularly.  His research has focussed on group theory, and later [[linear algebra]] too, and he has supervised five Ph.D students. He has also played a significant role in the establishment of the Irish [[Mathematical Olympiad]], and had frequently served the [[BT Young Scientist]]s Exhibition as a judge and reviewer.\n\nEarly in his career, he developed a strong interest in [[matrix theory]], due to the influence of [[Olga Taussky-Todd]], with whom he often corresponded.  This was cemented by a 1972–3 sabbatical spent at [[Northern Illinois University]].\n\nHe received the [[Hans Schneider Prize]] in 2013 in recognition of his constructive solution to the '''NIEP''' (Non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem) for non-zero spectra.<ref>Laffey T.J.

His work took on a life of its own in the hands of [[Daniel Quillen]] in the late 20th century. Quillen's discovery, that a ring Lazard used to classify formal group laws was isomorphic to an important ring in topology, lead to the subject of [[chromatic homotopy theory]].\n\nLazard's self-contained treatise on one-dimensional formal groups also birthed the field of [[Barsotti–Tate group|p-divisible groups]]. \n\nHis major contributions:\n* The classification of [[p-adic Lie group]]s: every p-adic Lie group is a closed subgroup of <math>{\\rm GL}_n(\\mathbb{Z}_p)</math>.\n* The classification of (1-dimensional commutative) [[formal group]]s.\n* The universal formal group law coefficient ring ([[Lazard's universal ring]]) is a [[polynomial ring]].\n* The concept of \"analyseurs\", reinvented by [[J.

He largely created the theory of [[continuous symmetry]] and applied it to the study of [[geometry]] and [[differential equations]].\n\n== Biography ==\nHis first mathematical work, ''Repräsentation der Imaginären der Plangeometrie'', was published in 1869 by the Academy of Sciences in [[Oslo|Christiania]] and also by ''[[Crelle's Journal]]''. That same year he received a scholarship and traveled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870. There, he met [[Felix Klein]] and they became close friends. When he left Berlin, Lie traveled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met [[Camille Jordan]] and [[Jean Gaston Darboux|Gaston Darboux]]. But on 19 July 1870 the [[Franco-Prussian War]] began and Klein (who was [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]]) had to leave France very quickly. Lie left for [[Fontainebleau]] where after a while he was arrested under suspicion of being a German spy, an event that made him famous in Norway. He was released from prison after a month, thanks to the intervention of Darboux.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Darboux, Gaston|authorlink=Gaston Darboux|title=Sophus Lie|journal=Bull. Amer. Math.

The next year, the Norwegian Parliament established an extraordinary professorship for him. That same year, Lie visited [[Felix Klein|Klein]], who was then at [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]] and working on the [[Erlangen program]].\n\nAt the end of 1872, Sophus Lie proposed to Anna Birch, then eighteen years old, and they were married in 1874. The couple had three children: Marie (b. 1877), Dagny (b. 1880) and Herman (b. 1884).\n\nIn 1884, [[Friedrich Engel (mathematician)|Friedrich Engel]] arrived at Christiania to help him, with the support of [[Felix Klein|Klein]] and [[Christian Gustav Adolph Mayer|Adolph Mayer]] (who were both professors at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], by then). Engel would help Lie to write his most important treatise, ''Theorie der Transformationsgruppen'', published in Leipzig in three volumes from 1888 to 1893. Decades later, Engel would also be one of the two editors of Lie's collected works.\n\nIn 1886 Lie became professor at [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]], replacing Klein, who had moved to [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. In November 1889, Lie suffered a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized until June 1890. After that, he returned to his post, but over the years his anaemia progressed to the point where he decided to return to his homeland. Consequently,  in 1898 he tendered his resignation in May, and left for home (for good) in September the same year. He died the following year, 1899.\n\nHe was made Honorary Member of the [[London Mathematical Society]] in 1878, Member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1892, Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society of London]] in 1895 and foreign associate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] in 1895.\n\nSophus Lie died at the age of 56, due to [[pernicious anemia]], a disease caused by impaired absorption of [[vitamin B12]].\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nLie's principal tool, and one of his greatest achievements, was the discovery that continuous [[transformation groups]] (now called, after him, [[Lie group]]s) could be better understood by \"linearizing\" them, and studying the corresponding generating [[vector field]]s (the so-called [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated to a Lie group|infinitesimal generator]]s). The generators are subject to a linearized version of the [[group law]], now called the [[commutator bracket]], and have the structure of what is today called a [[Lie algebra]].<ref name= pdf>\n{{Citation|last=Helgason|first=Sigurdur|authorlink=Sigurður Helgason (mathematician)| contribution=Sophus Lie, the Mathematician|contribution-url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-755-introduction-to-lie-groups-fall-2004/readings/helga_sopmath3_2.pdf|title= Proceedings of the Sophus Lie Memorial Conference, Oslo, August, 1992| publisher=Scandinavian University Press|place= Oslo| year=1994|pages= 3–21|postscript=.}}</ref><ref name=\"two\" />\n\n[[Hermann Weyl]]  used Lie's work on group theory in his papers from 1922 and 1923, and Lie groups today play a role in [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name=two>{{cite web\n  | last = Gale\n  | first = Thomson\n  | title = Marius Sophus Lie Biography\n  | publisher = World of Mathematics\n  | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/marius-sophus-lie-wom/\n  | accessdate =23 January 2009 }}</ref>\nHowever, the subject of Lie groups as it is studied today is vastly different from what the research by Sophus Lie was about and “among the 19th century masters, Lie's work is ''in detail'' certainly the least known today”.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Hermann | editor-first = Robert | editorlink=Robert Hermann (mathematician)| publisher = Math Sci Press | year = 1975 | series = Lie groups: History, frontiers and applications | title = Sophus Lie's 1880 transformation group paper | volume = 1 | isbn = 0-915692-10-4 | page = iii }}</ref>\n\n== Books ==\n\n*{{Citation | last = Lie | first = Sophus | title = Theorie der Transformationsgruppen I | publisher = B.

In 1882 he entered Franklin and Marshall Academy, and progressed to [[Muhlenberg College]] in 1884. He received his B.A. in 1887 and M.A. in 1890. While a graduate student, Miller was Principal of schools in [[Greeley, Kansas]] and then professor of mathematics as [[Eureka College]] in Eureka, Illinois. He corresponded with [[Cumberland University]] in Lebanon, Tennessee for his Ph.D. in 1892. He then joined [[Frank Nelson Cole]] at [[University of Michigan]] and began to study [[group (mathematics)|group]]s. In 1895 he went to Europe where he heard [[Sophus Lie]] lecture at Leipzig and [[Camille Jordan]] at Paris. In 1897 he went to [[Cornell University]] as an assistant professor, and in 1901 to [[Stanford University]] as associate professor. In 1906 he went to [[University of Illinois]] where he taught until retirement in 1931.<ref name=HRB>[[Henry Roy Brahana]] (1957) {{Biographical Memoirs|miller-george-a}}</ref>\n\nMiller helped in the enumeration of [[finite group]]s of degree 8, 9, and 10. [[Arthur Cayley]] had listed 198 groups of degree 8 in 1891, and Miller found two more making the total 200 in 1893. Camille Jordan had given a list for degree 9 in 1872, re-examined by Cole, and brought up to 258 groups by Miller. In 1894 Miller produced a list of 294 intransitive groups of degree 10. In consequence, the Academy of Science of Cracow awarded a prize and \"Miller came to prominence in the mathematical world abruptly.\"<ref name=HRB/>\n\nMiller was president of the [[Mathematical Association of America]] 1921–1922<ref>[http://www.maa.org/history/presidents/miller.html MAA presidents: George Abram Miller]</ref> and gave a [[plenary address at the International Congress of Mathematicians]] in 1924 in Toronto.<ref>{{cite book|author=Miller, G.
