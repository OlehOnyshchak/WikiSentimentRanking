      "text": "André Weil (; ; 6 May 1906 – 6 August 1998) was a French mathematician, known for his foundational work in number theory and algebraic geometry. He was a founding member and the de facto early leader of the mathematical Bourbaki group. The philosopher Simone Weil was his sister.\n\nLife\nAndré Weil was born in Paris to agnostic Alsatian Jewish parents who fled the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire after the Franco-Prussian War in 1870–71. The famous philosopher Simone Weil was Weil's only sibling. He studied in Paris, Rome and Göttingen and received his doctorate in 1928. While in Germany, Weil befriended Carl Ludwig Siegel. Starting in 1930, he spent two academic years at Aligarh Muslim University. Aside from mathematics, Weil held lifelong interests in classical Greek and Latin literature, in Hinduism and Sanskrit literature: he taught himself Sanskrit in 1920.Amir D. Aczel,The Artist and the Mathematician, Basic Books, 2009 pp.17ff.,p.25. Borel, Armand After teaching for one year in Aix-Marseille University, he taught for six years in Strasbourg. He married Éveline in 1937.\n\nWeil was in Finland when World War II broke out; he had been traveling in Scandinavia since April 1939. His wife Éveline returned to France without him. Weil was mistakenly arrested in Finland at the outbreak of the Winter War on suspicion of spying; however, accounts of his life having been in danger were shown to be exaggerated.Osmo Pekonen: L'affaire Weil à Helsinki en 1939, Gazette des mathématiciens 52 (avril 1992), pp. 13—20. With an afterword by André Weil. Weil returned to France via Sweden and the United Kingdom, and was detained at Le Havre in January 1940. He was charged with failure to report for duty, and was imprisoned in Le Havre and then Rouen. It was in the military prison in Bonne-Nouvelle, a district of Rouen, from February to May, that Weil completed the work that made his reputation. He was tried on 3 May 1940. Sentenced to five years, he requested to be attached to a military unit instead, and was given the chance to join a regiment in Cherbourg. After the fall of France, he met up with his family in Marseille, where he arrived by sea. He then went to Clermont-Ferrand, where he managed to join his wife Éveline, who had been living in German-occupied France.\n\nIn January 1941, Weil and his family sailed from Marseille to New York. He spent the remainder of the war in the United States, where he was supported by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Guggenheim Foundation. For two years, he taught undergraduate mathematics at Lehigh University, where he was unappreciated, overworked and poorly paid, although he didn't have to worry about being drafted, unlike his American students. But, he hated Lehigh very much for their heavy teaching workload and he swore that he would never talk about \"Lehigh\" any more. He quit the job at Lehigh, and then he moved to Brazil and taught at the Universidade de São Paulo from  1945 to 1947, where he worked with Oscar Zariski. He then returned to the United States and taught at the University of Chicago from 1947 to 1958, before moving to the Institute for Advanced Study, where he would spend the remainder of his career. He was a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts,Weil, André. \"Number theory and algebraic geometry.\" In Proc. Intern. Math. Congres., Cambridge, Mass., vol. 2, pp. 90–100. 1950. in 1954 in Amsterdam, and in 1978 in Helsinki. In 1979, Weil shared the second Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Jean Leray.\n\nWork\nWeil made substantial contributions in a number of areas, the most important being his discovery of profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory. This began in his doctoral work leading to the Mordell–Weil theorem (1928, and shortly applied in Siegel's theorem on integral points).A. Weil, L'arithmétique sur les courbes algébriques, Acta Math 52, (1929) p. 281-315, reprinted in vol 1 of his collected papers \n. Mordell's theorem had an ad hoc proof;L.J. Mordell, On the rational solutions of the indeterminate equations of the third and fourth degrees, Proc Cam. Phil. Soc.  21, (1922) p. 179 Weil began the separation of the infinite descent argument into two types of structural approach, by means of height functions for sizing rational points, and by means of Galois cohomology, which would not be categorized as such for another two decades. Both aspects of Weil's work have steadily developed into substantial theories.\n\nAmong his major accomplishments were the 1940s proof of the Riemann hypothesis for zeta-functions of curves over finite fields, Reprinted in Oeuvres Scientifiques/Collected Papers by André Weil  and his subsequent laying of proper foundations for algebraic geometry to support that result (from 1942 to 1946, most intensively).  The so-called Weil conjectures were hugely influential from around 1950; these statements were later proved by Bernard Dwork, Alexander Grothendieck, Michael Artin, and finally by Pierre Deligne, who completed the most difficult step in 1973.\n\nWeil introduced the adele ringA. Weil,\nAdeles and algebraic groups\n, Birkhauser, Boston, 1982 in the late 1930s, following Claude Chevalley's lead with the ideles, and gave a proof of the Riemann–Roch theorem with them (a version appeared in his Basic Number Theory in 1967). His 'matrix divisor' (vector bundle avant la lettre) Riemann–Roch theorem from 1938 was a very early anticipation of later ideas such as moduli spaces of bundles. The Weil conjecture on Tamagawa numbers proved resistant for many years. Eventually the adelic approach became basic in automorphic representation theory. He picked up another credited Weil conjecture, around 1967, which later under pressure from Serge Lang (resp. of Serre) became known as the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture (resp. Taniyama–Weil conjecture) based on a roughly formulated question of Taniyama at the 1955 Nikkō conference. His attitude towards conjectures was that one should not dignify a guess as a conjecture lightly, and in the Taniyama case, the evidence was only there after extensive computational work carried out from the late 1960s.Lang, S. \"Some History of the Shimura-Taniyama Conjecture.\" Not. Amer. Math. Soc. 42, 1301-1307, 1995\n\nOther significant results were on Pontryagin duality and differential geometry. He introduced the concept of  a uniform space in general topology, as a by-product of his collaboration with Nicolas Bourbaki (of which he was a Founding Father). His work on sheaf theory hardly appears in his published papers, but correspondence with Henri Cartan in the late 1940s, and reprinted in his collected papers, proved most influential. He also created the ∅.\n\nHe discovered that the so-called Weil representation, previously introduced in quantum mechanics by Irving Segal and Shale, gave a contemporary framework for understanding the classical theory of quadratic forms. This was also a beginning of a substantial development by others, connecting representation theory and theta functions.\n\nHe also wrote several books on the history of Number Theory. Weil was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1966.\n\nAs expositor\nWeil's ideas made an important contribution to the writings and seminars of Bourbaki, before and after World War II.\n\nHe says on page 114 of his autobiography that he was responsible for the null set symbol (Ø) and that it came from the Norwegian alphabet, which he alone among the Bourbaki group was familiar with.\n\nBeliefs\n\nIndian (Hindu) thought had great influence on Weil.Borel, Armand.

He was born in Shanghai and graduated from National Chiao Tung University in 1940. In 1945, Wu taught several months at Hangchow University (later merged into Zhejiang University) in Hangzhou.\n\nIn 1947, he went to France for further study at the University of Strasbourg. In 1949, he received his PhD, for his thesis Sur les classes caractéristiques des structures fibrées sphériques, written under the direction of Charles Ehresmann.  Afterwards, he did some work in Paris with René Thom and discovered the Wu class and Wu formula in algebraic topology.  In 1951 he was appointed to a post at Peking University.  However, Wu may have been among a wave of recalls of Chinese academics working in the West following Chiang Kai-shek's ouster from the mainland in 1949, according to eyewitness testimony by Marcel Berger, as he disappeared from France one day, without saying a word to anyone..\n\nHonors and awards\nIn 1957, he was elected as an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1986 he was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in Berkeley. In 1990, he was elected as an academician of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS).\n\nAlong with Yuan Longping, he was awarded the State Preeminent Science and Technology Award by President Jiang Zemin in 2000, when this highest scientific and technological prize in China began to be awarded. He also received the TWAS Prize in 1990 and the Shaw Prize in 2006. He was the President of the Chinese society of mathematics. He died on May 7, 2017, 5 days before his 98th birthday.\n\nResearch\nThe research of Wu includes the following fields: algebraic topology, algebraic geometry, game theory, history of mathematics, automated theorem proving.  His most important contributions are to algebraic topology.  The Wu class and the Wu formula are named after him.  In the field of automated theorem proving, he is known for Wu's method.\n\nHe was also active in the field of the history of Chinese mathematics.

      "text": "John Radford Young (born April 1799 in Southwark–died 5 March 1885 in Peckham) was an English mathematician, professor and author, who was almost entirely self-educated. He was born of humble parents in London. At an early age he became acquainted with Olinthus Gilbert Gregory, who perceived his mathematical ability and assisted him in his studies. In 1823, while working in a private establishment for the deaf, he published An Elementary Treatise on Algebra with a dedication to Gregory. This treatise was followed by a series of elementary works, in which, following in the steps of Robert Woodhouse, Young familiarized English students with continental methods of mathematical analysis.\n\nIn 1833, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics at Belfast College. When Queen's College, Belfast, opened in 1849, the presbyterian party in control there prevented Young's reappointment as Professor in the new establishment. From that time he devoted himself more completely to the study of mathematical analysis, and made several original discoveries.\n\nIn 1847, he published in the Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical Society a paper \"On the Principle of Continuity in reference to certain Results of Analysis\", and, in 1848, in the Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy a paper \"On an Extension of a Theorem of Euler\". As early as 1844, he had discovered and published a proof of Newton's rule for determining the number of imaginary roots in an equation. In 1866, he completed his proof, publishing in The Philosophical Magazine a demonstration of a principle which in his earlier paper he had assumed as axiomatic. In 1868, he contributed to the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy a memoir \"On the Imaginary Roots of Numerical Equations\".\n\nYoung died at Peckham on 5 March 1885.

      "text": "Oscar Zariski (April 24, 1899 – July 4, 1986) was a Russian-born American mathematician and one of the most influential algebraic geometers of the 20th century.\n\nEducation\nZariski was born Oscher (also transliterated as Ascher or Osher) Zaritsky to a Jewish family (his parents were Bezalel Zaritsky and Hanna Tennenbaum) and in 1918 studied at the University of Kiev. He left Kiev in 1920 to study at the University of Rome where he became a disciple of the Italian school of algebraic geometry, studying with Guido Castelnuovo, Federigo Enriques and Francesco Severi.\n\nZariski wrote a doctoral dissertation in 1924 on a topic in Galois theory, which was proposed to him by Castelnuovo. At the time of his dissertation publication, he changed his name to Oscar Zariski.\n\nJohns Hopkins University years\nZariski emigrated to the United States in 1927 supported by Solomon Lefschetz. He had a position at Johns Hopkins University where he became professor in 1937. During this period, he wrote Algebraic Surfaces as a summation of the work of the Italian school.\nThe book was published in 1935 and reissued 36 years later, with detailed notes by Zariski's students that illustrated how the field of algebraic geometry had changed. It is still an important reference.\n\nIt seems to have been this work that set the seal of Zariski's discontent with the approach of the Italians to birational geometry. He addressed the question of rigour by recourse to commutative algebra. The Zariski topology, as it was later known, is adequate for biregular geometry, where varieties are mapped by polynomial functions. That theory is too limited for algebraic surfaces, and even for curves with singular points. A rational map is to a regular map as a rational function is to a polynomial: it may be indeterminate at some points. In geometric terms, one has to work with functions defined on some open, dense set of a given variety. The description of the behaviour on the complement may require infinitely near points to be introduced to account for limiting behaviour along different directions. This introduces a need, in the surface case, to use also valuation theory to describe the phenomena such as blowing up (balloon-style, rather than explosively).\n\nHarvard University years\nAfter spending a year 1946–1947 at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Zariski became professor at Harvard University in 1947 where he remained until his retirement in 1969. In 1945, he fruitfully discussed foundational matters for algebraic geometry with André Weil. Weil's interest was in putting an abstract variety theory in place, to support the use of the Jacobian variety in his proof of the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields, a direction rather oblique to Zariski's interests. The two sets of foundations weren't reconciled at that point.\n\nAt Harvard, Zariski's students included Shreeram Abhyankar, Heisuke Hironaka, David Mumford, Michael Artin and Steven Kleiman—thus spanning the main areas of advance in singularity theory, moduli theory and cohomology in the next generation. Zariski himself worked on equisingularity theory. Some of his major results, Zariski's main theorem and the Zariski theorem on holomorphic functions, were amongst the results generalized and included in the programme of Alexander Grothendieck that ultimately unified algebraic geometry.\n\nZariski proposed the first example of a Zariski surface in 1958.\n\nViews\nZariski was a Jewish atheist.\n\nAwards and recognition\nZariski was awarded the Steele Prize in 1981, and in the same year the Wolf Prize in Mathematics with Lars Ahlfors. He wrote also Commutative Algebra in two volumes, with Pierre Samuel. His papers have been published by MIT Press, in four volumes.\n\nPublications\n\nSee also\nZariski ring\nZariski tangent space\nZariski surface\nZariski topology\nZariski–Riemann surface\nZariski space (disambiguation)\nZariski's lemma\nZariski's main theorem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography from United States Naval Academy.\n\nCategory:1899 births\nCategory:1986 deaths\nCategory:People from Kobryn\nCategory:People from Brookline, Massachusetts\nCategory:Belarusian atheists\nCategory:Belarusian Jews\nCategory:Jewish atheists\nCategory:American people of Belarusian-Jewish descent\nCategory:American atheists\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars\nCategory:Belarusian scientists\nCategory:National Medal of Science laureates\nCategory:Algebraic geometers\nCategory:Guggenheim Fellows\nCategory:Johns Hopkins University faculty\nCategory:Harvard University faculty\nCategory:Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates\nCategory:Presidents of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign faculty\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:Jewish Ukrainian mathematicians"

      "text": "Shou-Wu Zhang (; born October 9, 1962) is a Chinese-American mathematician known for his work in number theory and arithmetic geometry. He is currently a Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nShou-Wu Zhang was born in Hexian, Ma'anshan, Anhui, China on October 9, 1962. Zhang grew up in a poor farming household and could not attend school until eighth grade due to the Cultural Revolution. He spent most of his childhood raising ducks in the countryside and self-studying mathematics textbooks that he acquired from sent-down youth in trades for frogs. By the time he entered junior high school at the age of fourteen, he had self-learned calculus and had become interested in number theory after reading about Chen Jingrun's proof of Chen's theorem which made substantial progress on Goldbach's conjecture.\n\nEducation\nZhang was admitted to the Sun Yat-sen University chemistry department in 1980 after scoring poorly on his mathematics entrance examinations but later transferred to the mathematics department after feigning color blindness and received his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1983. He then studied under analytic number theorist Wang Yuan at the Chinese Academy of Sciences where he received his master's degree in 1986. In 1986, Zhang was brought to the United States to pursue his doctoral studies at Columbia University by Dorian M. Goldfeld. He then studied under Goldfeld, Hervé Jacquet, Lucien Szpiro, and Gerd Faltings, and then completed his PhD at Columbia University under Szpiro in 1991.\n\nCareer\nZhang was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and an assistant professor at Princeton University from 1991 to 1996. In 1996, Zhang moved back to Columbia University where he was a tenured professor until 2013. He has been a professor at Princeton University since 2011.\n\nZhang is on the editorial boards of: Acta Mathematica Sinica, Algebra & Number Theory, Forum of Mathematics, Journal of Differential Geometry, National Science Review, Pure and Applied Mathematics Quarterly, Science in China, and Research in Number Theory. He has previously served on the editorial boards of: Journal of Number Theory, Journal of the American Mathematical Society, Journal of Algebraic Geometry, and International Journal of Number Theory.\n\nResearch\nZhang's doctoral thesis Positive line bundles on Arithmetic Surfaces  proved a Nakai–Moishezon type theorem in intersection theory using a result from differential geometry already proved in Tian Gang's doctoral thesis. In a series of subsequent papers (, ), he further developed his theory of 'positive line bundles' in Arakelov theory which culminated in a proof (with Emmanuel Ullmo) of the Bogomolov conjecture ().\n\nIn a series of works in the 2000s (, ), Zhang proved a generalization of the Gross–Zagier theorem from elliptic curves over rationals to modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields. In particular, the latter result led him to a proof of the rank one Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for modular abelian varieties of GL(2) type over totally real fields through his work relating the Néron–Tate height of Heegner points to special values of L-functions in .. Eventually,  established a full generalization of the Gross–Zagier theorem to all Shimura curves.\n\nIn arithmetic dynamics,  posed conjectures on the Zariski density of non-fibered endomorphisms of quasi-projective varieties and  proposed a dynamical analogue of the Manin–Mumford conjecture.\n\nIn 2018,  proved the averaged Colmez conjecture which was shown to imply the André–Oort conjecture for Siegel modular varieties by Jacob Tsimerman.\n\nAwards\nZhang has received a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship (1997) and a Morningside Gold Medal of Mathematics (1998). He is also a Clay Foundation Prize Fellow (2003), Guggenheim Foundation Fellow (2009), Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2011), and Fellow of the American Mathematical Society (2016).

      "text": "Niels Henrik Abel (; ; 5 August 1802 – 6 April 1829) was a Norwegian mathematician who made pioneering contributions in a variety of fields.  His most famous single result is the first complete proof demonstrating the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation in radicals. This question was one of the outstanding open problems of his day, and had been unresolved for over 250 years. He was also an innovator in the field of elliptic functions, discoverer of Abelian functions. He made his discoveries while living in poverty and died at the age of 26 from tuberculosis.\n\nMost of his work was done in six or seven years of his working life. Regarding Abel, the French mathematician Charles Hermite said: \"Abel has left mathematicians enough to keep them busy for five hundred years.\" Another French mathematician, Adrien-Marie Legendre, said: \"quelle tête celle du jeune Norvégien!\" (\"what a head the young Norwegian has!\").\n\nThe Abel Prize in mathematics, originally proposed in 1899 to complement the Nobel Prizes, is named in his honour.\n\nLife\n\n Early life \n\nNiels Henrik Abel was born in Nedstrand, Norway, as the second child of the pastor Søren Georg Abel and Anne Marie Simonsen. When Niels Henrik Abel was born, the family was living at a rectory on Finnøy. Much suggests that Niels Henrik was born in the neighboring parish, as his parents were guests of the bailiff in Nedstrand in July / August of his year of birth.Stubhaug, Arild: Niels Henrik Abel – utdypning (NBL-artikkel) – Store norske leksion{{NoteTag|Niels Henrik was born premature and, according to oral tradition, a newly born child had to be washed in red wine and wrapped in cotton cloth in order to survive. Niels Henrik's father baptised him, and wrote in the parish register: \"6 September 1802 baptized in Finnøy church the pastor Søren G. Abel and Ane Marie Simonsen's child, Niels Henrik, born 5 August\" – (Norwegian: September 6te 1802 døbt i Findøe Kirke Sognepræsten Søren G. Abel og Ane Marie Simonsens Barn Niels Henrik, fød den 5te August.\")Skadberg, Gunnar A.: Ætt og heim 2004, chapter 5, Sogneprest Søren Georg Abel – Matematikerens far. .Morten Kiærulf was appointed pastor for Nedstrand in 1829. He wrote in a letter in 1880 to professor Bjerknes in Valle, that he was told by locals that one of Abel's sons was born at former bailiff Marstrand's house in Nedstrand.<ref>Myhre, Sigmar: Ætt og heim 2009, chapter 6, Niels Henrik Abel – fødestaden. .</ref>}}\n\nNiels Henrik Abel's father, Søren Georg Abel, had a degree in theology and philosophy and served as pastor at Finnøy. Søren's father, Niels's grandfather, Hans Mathias Abel, was also a pastor, at Gjerstad Church near the town of Risør. Søren had spent his childhood at Gjerstad, and had also served as chaplain there; and after his father's death in 1804, Søren was appointed pastor at Gjerstad and the family moved there. The Abel family originated in Schleswig and came to Norway in the 17th century.\n\nthumb|right|alt=Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory.|Postcard of Gjerstad church and rectory in 1890–95. The main building of the rectory was the same as when Abel lived here.\n\nAnne Marie Simonsen was from Risør; her father, Niels Henrik Saxild Simonsen, was a tradesman and merchant ship-owner, and said to be the richest person in Risør. Anne Marie had grown up with two stepmothers, in relatively luxurious surroundings. At Gjerstad rectory, she enjoyed arranging balls and social gatherings. Much suggests she was early on an alcoholic and took little interest in the upbringing of the children. Niels Henrik and his brothers were given their schooling by their father, with handwritten books to read. An addition table in a book of mathematics reads: 1+0=0.\n\n Cathedral School and Royal Frederick University \nWith Norwegian independence and the first election held in Norway, in 1814, Søren Abel was elected as a representative to the Storting. Meetings of the Storting were held until 1866 in the main hall of the Cathedral School in Christiania (now known as Oslo). Almost certainly, this is how he came into contact with the school, and he decided that his eldest son, Hans Mathias, should start there the following year. However, when the time for his departure approached, Hans was so saddened and depressed over having to leave home that his father did not dare send him away. He decided to send Niels instead.\n\nIn 1815, Niels Abel entered the Cathedral School at the age of 13. His elder brother Hans joined him there a year later. They shared rooms and had classes together. Hans got better grades than Niels; however, a new mathematics teacher, Bernt Michael Holmboe, was appointed in 1818. He gave the students mathematical tasks to do at home. He saw Niels Henrik's talent in mathematics, and encouraged him to study the subject to an advanced level. He even gave Niels private lessons after school.\n\nIn 1818, Søren Abel had a public theological argument with the theologian Stener Johannes Stenersen regarding his catechism from 1806. The argument was well covered in the press. Søren was given the nickname \"Abel Treating\" (Norwegian: \"Abel Spandabel\"). Niels' reaction to the quarrel was said to have been \"excessive gaiety\". At the same time, Søren also almost faced impeachment after insulting Carsten Anker, the host of the Norwegian Constituent Assembly; and in September 1818 he returned to Gjerstad with his political career in ruins. He began drinking heavily and died only two years later, in 1820, aged 48.\n\nBernt Michael Holmboe supported Niels Henrik Abel with a scholarship to remain at the school and raised money from his friends to enable him to study at the Royal Frederick University.\n\nWhen Abel entered the university in 1821, he was already the most knowledgeable mathematician in Norway. Holmboe had nothing more he could teach him and Abel had studied all the latest mathematical literature in the university library. During that time, Abel started working on the quintic equation in radicals. Mathematicians had been looking for a solution to this problem for over 250 years. In 1821, Abel thought he had found the solution. The two professors of mathematics in Christiania, Søren Rasmussen and Christopher Hansteen, found no errors in Abel's formulas, and sent the work on to the leading mathematician in the Nordic countries, Carl Ferdinand Degen in Copenhagen. He too found no faults but still doubted that the solution, which so many outstanding mathematicians had sought for so long, could really have been found by an unknown student in far-off Christiania. Degen noted, however, Abel's unusually sharp mind, and believed that such a talented young man should not waste his abilities on such a \"sterile object\" as the fifth degree equation, but rather on elliptic functions and transcendence; for then, wrote Degen, he would \"discover Magellanian thoroughfares to large portions of a vast analytical ocean\". Degen asked Abel to give a numerical example of his method. While trying to provide an example, Abel found a mistake in his paper.Abel biography. Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-07-12. This led to a discovery in 1823 that a solution to a fifth- or higher-degree equation was impossible.\n\nAbel graduated in 1822. His performance was exceptionally high in mathematics and average in other matters.\n\nCareer\nthumb|alt=From a notebook of Niels Henrik Abel|From the notebook of Niels Henrik Abel.\n\nAfter he graduated, professors from university supported Abel financially, and Professor Christopher Hansteen let him live in a room in the attic of his home. Abel would later view Ms. Hansteen as his second mother. While living here, Abel helped his younger brother, Peder Abel, through examen artium. He also helped his sister Elisabeth to find work in the town.\n\nIn early 1823, Niels Abel published his first article in \"Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne\", Norway's first scientific journal, which had been co-founded by Professor Hansteen. Abel published several articles, but the journal soon realized that this was not material for the common reader. In 1823, Abel also wrote a paper in French. It was \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler). He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However the work was lost, while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.\n\nthumb|Christine Kemp\n\nIn mid-1823, Professor Rasmussen gave Abel a gift of 100 speciedaler so he could travel to Copenhagen and visit Ferdinand Degen and other mathematicians there. While in Copenhagen, Abel did some work on Fermat's Last Theorem. Abel's uncle, Peder Mandrup Tuxen, lived at the naval base in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, and at a ball there Niels Abel met Christine Kemp, his future fiancée. In 1824, Christine moved to Son, Norway to work as a governess and the couple got engaged over Christmas.\n\nAfter returning from Copenhagen, Abel applied for a government scholarship in order to visit top mathematicians in Germany and France, but he was instead granted 200 speciedaler yearly for two years, to stay in Christiania and study German and French. In the next two years, he was promised a scholarship of 600 speciedaler yearly and he would then be permitted to travel abroad. While studying these languages, Abel published his first notable work in 1824, Mémoire sur les équations algébriques où on démontre l'impossibilité de la résolution de l'équation générale du cinquième degréhttp://www.abelprize.no/c54178/binfil/download.php?tid=53608 (Memoir on algebraic equations, in which the impossibility of solving the general equation of the fifth degree is proven). For, in 1823, Abel had at last proved the impossibility of solving the quintic equation in radicals (now referred to as the Abel–Ruffini theorem). However, this paper was in an abstruse and difficult form, in part because he had restricted himself to only six pages, in order to save money on printing. A more detailed proof was published in 1826 in the first volume of Crelle's Journal.\n\nIn 1825, Abel wrote a personal letter to King Carl Johan of Norway/Sweden requesting permission to travel abroad. He was granted this permission, and in September 1825 he left Christiania together with four friends from university (Christian P.B Boeck, Balthazar M. Keilhau, Nicolay B. Møller and Otto Tank). These four friends of Abel were traveling to Berlin and to the Alps to study geology. Abel wanted to follow them to Copenhagen and from there make his way to Göttingen. The terms for his scholarship stipulated that he was to visit Gauss in Göttingen and then continue to Paris. However, when he got as far as Copenhagen he changed his plans. He wanted to follow his friends to Berlin instead, intending to visit Göttingen and Paris afterwards.\n\nOn the way, he visited the astronomer Heinrich Christian Schumacher in Altona, now a district of Hamburg. He then spent four months in Berlin, where he became well acquainted with August Leopold Crelle, who was then about to publish his mathematical journal, Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik. This project was warmly encouraged by Abel, who contributed much to the success of the venture. Abel contributed seven articles to it in its first year.\n\nFrom Berlin Abel also followed his friends to the Alps. He went to Leipzig and Freiberg to visit Georg Amadeus Carl Friedrich Naumann and his brother the mathematician August Naumann. In Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and a new class now known as abelian functions.\n\nFrom Freiberg they went on to Dresden, Prague, Vienna, Trieste, Venice, Verona, Bolzano, Innsbruck, Luzern and Basel. From July 1826 Abel traveled on his own from Basel to Paris. Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the French Academy of Sciences, a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. With the help of a painter, Johan Gørbitz, he found an apartment in Paris and continued his work on the theorem. He finished in October 1826, and submitted it to the academy. It was to be reviewed by Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Abel's work was scarcely known in Paris, and his modesty restrained him from proclaiming his research. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death.\n\nAbel's limited finances finally compelled him to abandon his tour in January 1827. He returned to Berlin, and was offered a position as editor of Crelle's Journal, but opted out. By May 1827 he was back in Norway. His tour abroad was viewed as a failure. He had not visited Gauss in Göttingen and he had not published anything in Paris. His scholarship was therefore not renewed and he had to take up a private loan in Norges Bank of 200 spesidaler. He never repaid this loan. He also started tutoring. He continued to send most of his work to Crelle's Journal. But in mid-1828 he published, in rivalry with Carl Jacobi, an important work on elliptic functions in Astronomische Nachrichten in Altona.\n\n Death \nWhile in Paris, Abel contracted tuberculosis. At Christmas 1828, he traveled by sled to Froland to visit his fiancée. He became seriously ill on the journey; and, although a temporary improvement allowed the couple to enjoy the holiday together, he died relatively soon after on 6 April 1829, just two days before a letter arrived from August Crelle. Crelle had been searching for a new job for Abel in Berlin and had actually managed to have him appointed as a Professor at the University of Berlin. Crelle wrote to Abel to tell him, but the good news came too late.\n\nContributions to mathematics\nAbel showed that there is no general algebraic solution for the roots of a quintic equation, or any general polynomial equation of degree greater than four, in terms of explicit algebraic operations. To do this, he invented (independently of Galois) a branch of mathematics known as group theory,  which is invaluable not only in many areas of mathematics, but for much of physics as well. Abel sent a paper on the unsolvability of the quintic equation to Carl Friedrich Gauss, who proceeded to discard without a glance what he believed to be the worthless work of a crank.\n\nAs a 16-year-old, Abel gave a rigorous proof of the binomial theorem valid for all numbers, extending Euler's result which had held only for rationals. Abel wrote a fundamental work on the theory of elliptic integrals, containing the foundations of the theory of elliptic functions.\nWhile travelling to Paris he published a paper revealing the double periodicity of elliptic functions, which Adrien-Marie Legendre later described to Augustin-Louis Cauchy as \"a monument more lasting than bronze\" (borrowing a famous sentence by the Roman poet Horatius). The paper was, however, misplaced by Cauchy.\n\nWhile abroad Abel had sent most of his work to Berlin to be published in the Crelle's Journal, but he had saved what he regarded as his most important work for the French Academy of Sciences, a theorem on addition of algebraic differentials. The theorem was put aside and forgotten until his death.\nWhile in Freiberg Abel did research in the theory of functions, particularly, elliptic, hyperelliptic, and a new class now known as abelian functions.\n\nIn 1823 Abel wrote a paper titled \"a general representation of the possibility to integrate all differential formulas\" (Norwegian: en alminnelig Fremstilling af Muligheten at integrere alle mulige Differential-Formler). He applied for funds at the university to publish it. However the work was lost, while being reviewed, never to be found thereafter.\n\nAbel said famously of Carl Friedrich Gauss's writing style, \"He is like the fox, who effaces his tracks in the sand with his tail.\"\n\n Legacy \nUnder Abel's guidance, the prevailing obscurities of analysis began to be cleared, new fields were entered upon and the study of functions so advanced as to provide mathematicians with numerous ramifications along which progress could be made. His works, the greater part of which originally appeared in Crelle's Journal'', were edited by Bernt Michael Holmboe and published in 1839 by the Norwegian government, and a more complete edition by Ludwig Sylow and Sophus Lie was published in 1881. The adjective \"abelian\", derived from his name, has become so commonplace in mathematical writing that it is conventionally spelled with a lower-case initial \"a\" (e.g., abelian group, abelian category, and abelian variety).\n\nOn 6 April 1929, four Norwegian stamps were issued for the centenary of Abel's death. His portrait appears on the 500-kroner banknote (version V) issued during 1978–1985. On 5 June 2002, four Norwegian stamps were issued in honour of Abel two months before the bicentenary of his birth. There is also a 20-kroner coin issued by Norway in his honour. A statue of Abel stands in Oslo, and crater Abel on the Moon was named after him.

      "text": "Sergei Ivanovich Adian, also Adyan (; , born 1 January 1931), is a Soviet and Russian mathematician. He is a professor at the Moscow State University and is known for his work in group theory, especially on the Burnside problem.\n\nBiography\nAdian was born near Elizavetpol. He grew up there in an Armenian family. He studied at Yerevan and Moscow pedagogical institutes. His advisor was Pyotr Novikov. He has been working at Moscow State University (MSU) since 1965. Alexander Razborov was one of his students.\n\nMathematical career\nIn his first work as a student in 1950, Adian proved that the graph of a function  of a real variable satisfying the functional equation  and having discontinuities is dense in the plane. (Clearly, all continuous solutions of the equation are linear functions.) This result was not published at the time. About 25 years later the American mathematician Edwin Hewitt from the University of Washington gave preprints of some of his papers to Adian during a visit to MSU, one of which was devoted to exactly the same result, which was published by Hewitt much later.\n\nBy the beginning of 1955, Adian had managed to prove the undecidability of practically all non-trivial invariant group properties, including the undecidability of being isomorphic to a fixed group , for any group . These results constituted his Ph.D. thesis and his first published work. This is one of the most remarkable, beautiful, and general results in algorithmic group theory and is now known as the Adian–Rabin theorem. What distinguishes the first published work by Adian, is its completeness. In spite of numerous attempts, nobody has added anything fundamentally new to the results during the past 50 years. Adian’s result was immediately used by Andrey Markov in his proof of the algorithmic unsolvability of the classical problem of deciding when topological manifolds are homeomorphic.\n\nBurnside problem\n\nAbout the Burnside problem:\nVery much like Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory, Burnside’s\nproblem has acted as a catalyst for research in group theory. The fascination exerted by a problem with an extremely simple formulation which then turns out to be extremely difficult has something irresistible about it to the mind of the mathematician.\n\nBefore the work of Novikov and Adian an affirmative answer to the problem was known only for  and the matrix groups. However, this did not hinder the belief in an affirmative answer for any period . The only question was\nto find the right methods for proving it. As later developments showed, this belief was too naive. This just demonstrates that before their work nobody even came close to imagining the nature of the free Burnside group, or the extent to which subtle structures inevitably arose in any serious attempt to investigate it. In fact, there were no methods for proving inequalities in groups given by identities of the\nform .\n\nAn approach to solving the problem in the negative was first outlined by P. S. Novikov in his note, which appeared in 1959. However, the concrete realization of his ideas encountered serious difficulties, and in 1960, at the insistence of Novikov and his wife Lyudmila Keldysh, Adian settled down to work on the Burnside problem. Completing the project took intensive efforts from both\ncollaborators in the course of eight years, and in 1968 their famous paper appeared, containing a negative solution of the problem for all odd periods , and hence for all multiples of those odd integers as well.\n\nThe solution of the Burnside problem was certainly one of the most outstanding\nand deep mathematical results of the past century. At the same time, this result\nis one of the hardest theorems: just the inductive step of a complicated induction\nused in the proof took up a whole issue of volume 32 of Izvestiya, even lengthened\nby 30 pages. In many respects the work was literally carried to its conclusion by\nthe exceptional persistence of Adian. In that regard it is worth recalling the words\nof Novikov, who said that he had never met a mathematician more ‘penetrating’\nthan Adian.\n\nIn contrast to the Adian–Rabin theorem, the paper of Adian and Novikov in no way ‘closed’ the Burnside problem. Moreover,\nover a long period of more than ten years Adian continued to improve and simplify\nthe method they had created and also to adapt the method for solving some other\nfundamental problems in group theory.\n\nBy the beginning of the 1980s, when other contributors\nappeared who mastered the Novikov–Adian method, the theory already\nrepresented a powerful method for constructing and investigating new groups (both\nperiodic and non-periodic) with interesting properties prescribed.\n\n External links \n  On 75th birthday – an article by L.

      "text": "Michael George Aschbacher (born April 8, 1944) is an American mathematician best known for his work on finite groups. He was a leading figure in the completion of the classification of finite simple groups in the 1970s and 1980s. It later turned out that the classification was incomplete, because the case of quasithin groups had not been finished. This gap was fixed by Aschbacher and Stephen D. Smith in 2004, in a pair of books comprising about 1300 pages. Aschbacher is currently the Shaler Arthur Hanisch Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology.\n\n Education and career \nAschbacher received his B.S. at the California Institute of Technology in 1966 and his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1969. He joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology in 1970 and became a full professor in 1976. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1978-79.Institute for Advanced Study: A Community of Scholars  He was awarded the Cole Prize in 1980, and was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990. In 1992, Aschbacher was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize for Mathematics by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 2011.Michael Aschbacher is being awarded The Rolf Schock Prize in Mathematics,  Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences press release, March 23, 2011. In 2012 he received the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition and the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-03.\n\n Classification of finite simple groups \n\nIn 1973, Aschbacher became a leading figure in the classification of finite simple groups. Aschbacher considered himself somewhat of an outsider in the world of conventional group theory, claiming that he was not \"plugged into the system at that point in time.\"    \nAlthough he had access to several preprints that were shared among the practitioners of the field, he reproduced many proofs that had already been discovered by other researchers and published them in his early papers. Aschbacher only became interested in finite simple groups as a postdoctorate. He wrote his dissertation in combinatorics and was able to utilize many techniques developed in this area to make early contributions to the study of finite simple groups which surprised the community of researchers. In particular, Daniel Gorenstein, another leader of the classification of finite simple groups, said that Aschbacher's entrance was \"dramatic.\" \n\nIn fact, the rate of Aschbacher's results proved so astounding that many other mathematicians decided to leave the field to pursue other problems. Aschbacher was proving one major result after another and when he announced his progress at the Duluth conference, mathematicians were convinced that the problem was almost solved. This conference represented a turning point for the problem as many mathematicians (in particular those relatively new to the field) decided to leave the field to pursue other problems.\n\nHowever, Aschbacher's entrance into the field did not come without difficulties. Aschbacher's papers, beginning with the first he wrote in the field for publication, were very difficult to read. Some commented that his proofs lacked explanations of very sophisticated counting arguments. As Aschbacher's proofs became longer, it became even more difficult for others to understand his proofs. Even some of his own coauthors had trouble reading their own papers. From that point on, researchers no longer read papers as independent documents, but rather ones that required the context of its author. As a result, responsibility of finding errors in the classification problem was up to the entire community of researchers rather than just peer-reviewers alone. That Aschbacher's proofs were hard to read was not due to a lack of ability, but rather to the astounding complexity of the ideas he was able to produce.\n\n Books \n\nFinite group theory \nSporadic groups \n3-Transposition groups \nThe finite simple groups and their classification \nOvergroups of Sylow subgroups in sporadic groups \n\n References \n\n External links \nAschbacher's webpage at Caltech\n\nCategory:1944 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:California Institute of Technology alumni\nCategory:California Institute of Technology faculty\nCategory:University of Wisconsin–Madison alumni\nCategory:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars\nCategory:Wolf Prize in Mathematics laureates\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:Mathematicians from Arkansas\nCategory:People from Little Rock, Arkansas"

Bareis was an assistant professor at Ohio State University where she taught for 40 years until her eventual retirement in 1946.\n\n Early life and education \nGrace Marie Bareis was born on December 19, 1875 in Canal Winchester, Ohio to George Frederick Bareis and Amanda Jane. Biography on p.48-50 of the\nSupplementary Material at AMS Bareis attended public school in her hometown, and then went on to attend Heidelberg University in Ohio. She graduated as valedictorian of her class and received her A.B degree in 1897. Bareis then completed part of her graduate work at Bryn Mawr College during 1897-1899, and later at Columbia University in that same year She took a brief break from school to work as a teacher at Miss Roney's School in Philadelphia where she would continue to work for the next six years. Two years after leaving Columbia University, she returned to Bryn Mawr College to continue her work on a mathematics degree. In 1906, Bareis enrolled in the graduate program at Ohio State University and after three years received the first Ph.D in mathematics from the university. Her dissertation, \"Imprimitive Substitution Groups of Degree Sixteen\", was directed by Harry W. Kuhn.\n\n Career \nDuring her graduate work at Ohio State University in 1908, Bareis became an assistant professor of mathematics. She held the position until her retirement in 1946. While serving as an assistant professor, she helped to direct master thesis of her students and also held various other positions in the Education and Women College. Bareis taught mathematics to World War II veterans in a class called the \"Army Specialized Training Program\"  and even did so two years after her retirement because of a shortage of math instructors.\n\n Personal life \nBareis was involved with various organizations. Her religious associations include the Evangelical and Reformed Church, Missionary Society, and Indianola Methodist Church. She was a founding member of the Mathematical Association of America, volunteered at the  American Red Cross, and belonged to the Daughters of the American Revolution as well as the Ohio Historical Society. Bareis was a part of numerous groups at Ohio State University such as the OSU Faculty Club and OSU Alumnae Association. She was also a part of the Board of Trustees of Heidelberg College who awarded her an honorary doctorate in 1950.\n\nShe enjoyed gardening and tending to her farm in Brice, Ohio.\n\n Later life and legacy \nIn 1949, Bareis donated $2000 to Ohio State University to celebrate its 75th anniversary and to provide funding for a written competition between sophomores. \"The Grace M. Bareis Mathematical Prize\" (part of the Rasor-Bareis-Gordon) competition has been held annually in her honor ever since.\n\nBareis had a home in Canal Winchester, Ohio, but she began living in Columbus with her friend and colleague, Margaret F. Jones, near the start of her retirement. She lived with her for 26 years until a prolonged illness caused her death on June 15, 1962.\n\nThe Bareis Hall of Science in Heidelberg University was built in her honor.\n\n References \n\nCategory:1875 births\nCategory:1962 deaths\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:American women mathematicians\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Heidelberg University (Ohio) alumni\nCategory:Ohio State University alumni\nCategory:Ohio State University faculty\nCategory:People from Canal Winchester, Ohio\nCategory:People from Columbus, Ohio\nCategory:20th-century women mathematicians"

Annals of Mathematics (2), vol.  135  (1992),  no. 1, pp. 1–51   In the same paper they introduced the notion of a relative train track and applied train track methods to solve the Scott conjecture which says that for every automorphism α of a finitely generated free group Fn the fixed subgroup of α is free of rank at most n.  Since then train tracks became a standard tool in the study of algebraic, geometric and dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups and of subgroups of Out(Fn).    Examples of applications of train tracks include: a theorem of BrinkmannP. Brinkmann, Hyperbolic automorphisms of free groups.  Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 10  (2000),  no. 5, pp. 1071–1089 proving that for an automorphism α of Fn the mapping torus group of α is word-hyperbolic if and only if α has no periodic conjugacy classes; a theorem of Bridson and GrovesMartin R.

Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 129 (1997), no. 3, pp. 445–470 Bestvina and Brady developed a version of discrete Morse theory for cubical complexes and applied it to study homological finiteness properties of subgroups of right-angled Artin groups. In particular, they constructed an example of a group which provides a counter-example to either the Whitehead asphericity conjecture or to the Eilenberg−Ganea conjecture, thus showing that at least one of these conjectures must be false. Brady subsequently used their Morse theory technique to construct the first example of a finitely presented subgroup of a word-hyperbolic group that is not itself word-hyperbolic.Brady, Noel,  Branched coverings of cubical complexes and subgroups of hyperbolic groups.

He is known for his work in lattices, number theory, group theory, and infinite-dimensional algebras,James Lepowsky, \"The Work of Richard Borcherds\", Notices of the American Mathematical Society, Volume 46, Number 1 (January 1999). for which he was awarded the Fields Medal in 1998.\n\n Early life \nBorcherds was born in Cape Town, but the family moved to Birmingham in the United Kingdom when he was six months old. His father is a physicist and he has three brothers, two of whom are mathematics teachers. He was a promising mathematician and chess player as a child, winning several national mathematics championships and \"was in line for becoming a chess master\" before giving up chess after coming to believe that the higher levels of competitive chess are merely about the competition rather than the fun of playing.\n\n Education \nHe was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he studied under John Horton Conway.\n\n Career \nAfter receiving his doctorate in 1985 he has held various alternating positions at Cambridge and the University of California, Berkeley, serving as Morrey Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Berkeley from 1987 to 1988. He was a Royal Society University Research Fellow. From 1996 he held a Royal Society Research Professorship at Cambridge before returning to Berkeley in 1999 as Professor of mathematics. At Berkeley, he held a Miller Research Professorship from 2000 to 2001. \n\nBorcherds's early work included pioneering results on classification of unimodular lattices, and the introduction of new algebraic objects, most notably vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras.  These ideas came together in his vertex-algebraic construction and analysis of the fake monster Lie algebra (called the monster Lie algebra at the time).  \n\nBorcherds is best known for his resolution of the Conway-Norton monstrous moonshine conjecture, which describes an intricate relation between the monster group and modular functions on the complex upper half-plane.  To prove this conjecture, he drew upon theories that he had previously introduced, namely those of vertex algebras and Borcherds-Kac-Moody algebras, together with techniques of string theory, and applied them to the \"moonshine module\", a vertex operator algebra with monster symmetry constructed by Igor Frenkel, James Lepowsky, and Arne Meurman.  Additional work in moonshine concerned mod p variants of this conjecture, and were known as modular moonshine.\n\nLater contributions include the theory of Borcherds products, which are holomorphic automorphic forms on O(n,2) that have well-behaved infinite product expansions at cusps.  Borcherds used this theory to resolve some long-standing conjectures concerning quasi-affineness of certain moduli spaces of algebraic surfaces.  More recently, Borcherds has rendered perturbative renormalization, in particular the 't Hooft-Veltman proof of perturbative renormalizability of gauge theory, into rigorous mathematical language.\n\nAn interview with Simon Singh for The Guardian, in which Borcherds suggested he might have some traits associated with Asperger syndrome,Simon Singh, \"Interview with Richard Borcherds\", The Guardian (28 August 1998) subsequently led to a chapter about him in a book on autism by Simon Baron-Cohen. (see external links) records conversations with Richard Borcherds and his family.High flying obsessives, The Guardian, December 2000 Baron-Cohen concluded that while Borcherds had many autistic traits, he did not merit a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.\n\n Awards and honours \nIn 1992 he was one of the first recipients of the EMS prizes awarded at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris, and in 1994 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich. In 1994, he was elected to the Royal Society of Fellows. In 1998 at the 23rd International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin, Germany he received the Fields Medal together with Maxim Kontsevich, William Timothy Gowers and Curtis T. McMullen. The award cited him \"for his contributions to algebra, the theory of automorphic forms, and mathematical physics, including the introduction of vertex algebras and Borcherds' Lie algebras, the proof of the Conway-Norton moonshine conjecture and the discovery of a new class of automorphic infinite products.\" In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society,List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society.

He is also known for solving the angel problem. Bowditch holds a chaired Professor appointment in Mathematics at the University of Warwick.\n\nBiography\nBrian Bowditch was born in 1961 in Neath, Wales. He obtained a B.A. degree from Cambridge University in 1983. He subsequently pursued doctoral studies in Mathematics at the University of Warwick under the supervision of David Epstein where he received a PhD in 1988.Brian Hayward Bowditch at the Mathematics Genealogy Project Bowditch then had postdoctoral and visiting positions at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, the University of Warwick, Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques at Bures-sur-Yvette, the University of Melbourne, and the University of Aberdeen.

Accessed 15 October 2008.\n\nMathematical contributions\n\nEarly notable results of Bowditch include clarifying the classic notion of geometric finiteness for higher-dimensional Kleinian groups in constant and variable negative curvature. In a 1993 paperB. H. Bowditch, \"Geometrical finiteness for hyperbolic groups\"  Journal of Functional Analysis, vol. 113 (1993), no. 2, 245–317 Bowditch proved that five standard characterisations of geometric finiteness for discrete groups of isometries of hyperbolic 3-space and hyperbolic plane, (including the definition in terms of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron) remain equivalent for groups of isometries of hyperbolic n-space where n ≥ 4. He showed, however, that in dimensions n ≥ 4 the condition of having a finitely-sided Dirichlet domain is no longer equivalent to the standard notions of geometric finiteness. In a subsequent paperB. H. Bowditch, \"Geometrical finiteness with variable negative curvature\" Duke Mathematical Journal, vol. 77 (1995), no. 1, 229–274 Bowditch considered a similar problem for discrete groups of isometries of Hadamard manifold of pinched (but not necessarily constant) negative curvature and of arbitrary dimension n ≥ 2. He proved that four out of five equivalent definitions of geometric finiteness considered in his previous paper remain equivalent in this general set-up, but the condition of having a finitely-sided fundamental polyhedron is no longer equivalent to them.  \n\nMuch of Bowditch's work in the 1990s concerned studying boundaries at infinity of word-hyperbolic groups. He proved the cut-point conjecture which says that the boundary of a one-ended word-hyperbolic group does not have any global cut-points. Bowditch first proved this conjecture in the main cases of a one-ended hyperbolic group that does not split over a two-ended subgroupB. H. Bowditch, \"Group actions on trees and dendrons\" Topology, vol. 37 (1998), no. 6, pp. 1275–1298 (that is, a subgroup containing infinite cyclic subgroup of finite index) and also for one-ended hyperbolic groups that are \"strongly accessible\".B. H. Bowditch, \"Boundaries of strongly accessible hyperbolic groups\" The Epstein birthday schrift, pp. 51–97, Geometry&Topology Monographs, vol. 1, Geom. Topol. Publ., Coventry, 1998 The general case of the conjecture was finished shortly thereafter by G. Ananda SwarupG. A. Swarup, \"On the cut point conjecture\" \nElectronic Research Announcements of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 2 (1996), no. 2, pp. 98–100 who characterised Bowditch's work as follows: \"The most significant advances in this direction were carried out by Brian Bowditch in a brilliant series of papers ([4]-[7]). We draw heavily from his work\". Soon after Swarup's paper Bowditch supplied an alternative proof of the cut-point conjecture in the general case.B. H. Bowditch, \"Connectedness properties of limit sets\" Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 351 (1999), no. 9, pp. 3673–3686 Bowditch's work relied on extracting various discrete tree-like structures from the action of a word-hyperbolic group on its boundary. \n\nBowditch also proved that (modulo a few exceptions) the boundary of a one-ended word-hyperbolic group G has local cut-points if and only if G admits an essential splitting, as an amalgamated free product or an HNN extension, over a virtually infinite cyclic group. This allowed Bowditch to produceB. H. Bowditch, \"Cut points and canonical splittings of hyperbolic groups\"\nActa Mathematica, vol. 180 (1998), no. 2, 145–186. a theory of JSJ decomposition for word-hyperbolic groups that was more canonical and more general (particularly because it covered groups with nontrivial torsion) than the original JSJ decomposition theory of Zlil Sela.Zlil Sela,  \"Structure and rigidity in (Gromov) hyperbolic groups and discrete groups in rank $$1 Lie groups. II\" Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 7 (1997), no. 3, pp. 561–593. One of the consequences of Bowditch's work is that for one-ended word-hyperbolic groups (with a few exceptions) having a nontrivial essential splitting over a virtually cyclic subgroup is a quasi-isometry invariant.\n\nBowditch also gave a topological characterisation of word-hyperbolic groups, thus solving a conjecture proposed by Mikhail Gromov. Namely, Bowditch provedB. H. Bowditch, \"A topological characterisation of hyperbolic groups\" Journal of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 11 (1998), no. 3, pp. 643–667. that a group G is word-hyperbolic if and only if G admits an action by homeomorphisms on a perfect metrisable compactum M as a \"uniform convergence group\", that is such that the diagonal action of G on the set of distinct triples from M is properly discontinuous and co-compact; moreover, in that case M is G-equivariantly homeomorphic to the boundary ∂G of G. Later, building up on this work, Bowditch's PhD student Yaman gave a topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups.Asli Yaman, \"A topological characterisation of relatively hyperbolic groups\". Crelle's Journal, vol. 566 (2004), pp. 41–89.\n\nMuch of Bowditch's work in 2000s concerns the study of the curve complex, with various applications to 3-manifolds, mapping class groups and Kleinian groups. The curve complex C(S) of a finite type surface S, introduced by Harvey in the late 1970s,W. J. Harvey, \"Boundary structure of the modular group\". Riemann surfaces and related topics: Proceedings of the 1978 Stony Brook Conference (State Univ. New York, Stony Brook, N.Y., 1978), pp. 245–251,\nAnn. of Math. Stud., 97, Princeton Univ. Press, Princeton, N.J., 1981.  has the set of free homotopy classes of essential simple closed curves on S as the set of vertices, where several distinct vertices span a simplex if the corresponding curves can be realised disjointly. The curve complex turned out to be a fundamental tool in the study of the geometry of the Teichmüller space, of mapping class groups and of Kleinian groups. In a 1999 paperHoward Masur, and Yair Minsky, \"Geometry of the complex of curves. I. Hyperbolicity\" Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 138 (1999), no. 1, pp. 103–149. Howard Masur and Yair Minsky proved that for a finite type orientable surface S the curve complex C(S) is Gromov-hyperbolic. This result was a key component in the subsequent proof of Thurston's Ending lamination conjecture, a solution which was based on the combined work of Yair Minsky, Howard Masur, Jeffrey Brock, and Richard Canary.Yair Minsky, \"Curve complexes, surfaces and 3-manifolds\". International Congress of Mathematics. Vol. II, pp. 1001–1033, Eur. Math. Soc., Zürich, 2006.  In 2006 Bowditch gave another proofBrian H. Bowditch, \"Intersection numbers and the hyperbolicity of the curve complex\" Crelle's Journal, vol. 598 (2006), pp. 105–129. of hyperbolicity of the curve complex. Bowditch's proof is more combinatorial and rather different from the Masur-Minsky original argument. Bowditch's result also provides an estimate on the hyperbolicity constant of the curve complex which is logarithmic in complexity of the surface and also gives a description of geodesics in the curve complex in terms of the intersection numbers. A subsequent 2008 paper of BowditchBrian H. Bowditch, \"Tight geodesics in the curve complex\" Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 171 (2008), no. 2, pp. 281–300. pushed these ideas further and obtained new quantitative finiteness results regarding the so-called \"tight geodesics\" in the curve complex, a notion introduced by Masur and Minsky to combat the fact that the curve complex is not locally finite. As an application, Bowditch proved that, with a few exceptions of surfaces of small complexity, the action of the mapping class group Mod(S) on C(S) is \"acylindrical\" and that the asymptotic translation lengths of pseudo-Anosov elements of Mod(S) on C(S) are rational numbers with bounded denominators. \n\nA 2007 paper of Bowditch produces a positive solution of the angel problem of John Conway:John H. Conway, \"The angel problem\" Games of no chance (Berkeley, California, 1994), pp. 3–12, \nMathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications, 29, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1996.  Bowditch provedB. H. Bowditch, \"The angel game in the plane\" Combinatorics, Probability and Computing, vol. 16 (2007), no. 3, pp. 345–362 that a 4-angel has a winning strategy and can evade the devil in the \"angel game\".

      "text": "Richard Dagobert Brauer (February 10, 1901 – April 17, 1977) was a leading German and American mathematician. He worked mainly in abstract algebra, but made important contributions to number theory. He was the founder of modular representation theory.\n\nEducation and career\nAlfred Brauer was Richard's brother and seven years older. Alfred and Richard were both interested in science and mathematics, but Alfred was injured in combat in World War I. As a boy, Richard dreamt of becoming an inventor, and in February 1919 enrolled in Technische Hochschule Berlin-Charlottenburg. He soon transferred to University of Berlin. Except for the summer of 1920 when he studied at University of Freiburg, he studied in Berlin, being awarded his Ph.D. on 16 March 1926. Issai Schur conducted a seminar and posed a problem in 1921 that Alfred and Richard worked on together, and published a result. The problem also was solved by Heinz Hopf at the same time. Richard wrote his thesis under Schur, providing an algebraic approach to irreducible, continuous, finite-dimensional representations of real orthogonal (rotation) groups.\n\nIlse Karger also studied mathematics at the University of Berlin; she and Richard were married 17 September 1925. Their sons George Ulrich (b 1927) and Fred Gunther (b 1932) also became mathematicians. Brauer began his teaching career in Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) working as Konrad Knopp’s assistant. Brauer expounded central division algebras over a perfect field while in Königsberg; the isomorphism classes of such algebras form the elements of the Brauer group he introduced.\n\nWhen the Nazi Party took over in 1933, the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced Foreign Scholars took action to help Brauer and other Jewish scientists. Brauer was offered an assistant professorship at University of Kentucky. Richard accepted the offer, and by the end of 1933 he was in Lexington, Kentucky, teaching in English. Ilse followed the next year with George and Fred; brother Alfred made it to the United States in 1939, but their sister Alice was killed in The Holocaust.Bergmann, Birgit; Epple, Moritz; and Ungar, Ruti. Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture, p. 54. Springer, 2012. . Accessed February 25, 2013. \"Schur's disciple Alfred Brauer was the last Jewish mathematician who managed to complete his habilitation and become Privatdozent at the University of Berlin before the Nazi regime began. Brauer escaped to the USA in 1939, joining his brother Richard (1901-1977) who had fled in 1933.\"\n\nHermann Weyl invited Richard to assist him at Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study in 1934. Richard and Nathan Jacobson edited Weyl's lectures Structure and Representation of Continuous Groups. Through the influence of Emmy Noether, Richard was invited to University of Toronto to take up a faculty position. With his graduate student Cecil J. Nesbitt he developed modular representation theory, published in 1937.  Robert Steinberg, Stephen Arthur Jennings, and Ralph Stanton were also Brauer’s students in Toronto. Brauer also conducted international research with Tadasi Nakayama on representations of algebras. In 1941 University of Wisconsin hosted visiting professor Brauer. The following year he visited the Institute for Advanced Study and Bloomington, Indiana where Emil Artin was teaching.\n\nIn 1948 Richard and Ilse moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan where he and Robert M. Thrall contributed to the program in modern algebra at University of Michigan. With his graduate student K. A. Fowler, Brauer proved the Brauer-Fowler theorem.  Donald John Lewis was another of his students at UM.\n\nIn 1952 Brauer joined the faculty of Harvard University. Before retiring in 1971 he taught aspiring mathematicians such as Donald Passman and I. Martin Isaacs. The Brauers frequently traveled to see their friends such as Reinhold Baer, Werner Wolfgang Rogosinski, and Carl Ludwig Siegel.\n\nMathematical work\n\nSeveral theorems bear his name, including Brauer's induction theorem, which has applications in number theory as well as finite group theory, and its corollary Brauer's characterization of characters, which is central to the theory of group characters.\n\nThe Brauer–Fowler theorem, published in 1956, later provided significant impetus towards the classification of finite simple groups, for it implied that there could only be finitely many finite simple groups for which the centralizer of an involution (element of order 2) had a specified structure.\n\nBrauer applied modular representation theory to obtain subtle information about group characters, particularly via his three main theorems. These methods were particularly useful in the classification of finite simple groups with low rank Sylow 2-subgroups. The Brauer–Suzuki theorem showed that no finite simple group could have a generalized quaternion Sylow 2-subgroup, and the Alperin–Brauer–Gorenstein theorem classified finite groups with wreathed or quasidihedral Sylow 2-subgroups. The methods developed by Brauer were also instrumental in contributions by others to the classification program: for example, the Gorenstein–Walter theorem, classifying finite groups with a dihedral Sylow 2-subgroup, and Glauberman's Z* theorem. The theory of a block with a cyclic defect group, first worked out by Brauer in the case when the principal block has defect group of order p, and later worked out in full generality by E. C. Dade, also had several applications to group theory, for example to finite groups of matrices over the complex numbers in small dimension. The Brauer tree is a combinatorial object associated to a block with cyclic defect group which encodes much information about the structure of the block.\n\nIn 1970, he was awarded the National Medal of Science.National Science Foundation The President's National Medal of Science\n\nHypercomplex numbers\n\nEduard Study had written an article on hypercomplex numbers for Klein's encyclopedia in 1898. This article was expanded for the French language edition by Henri Cartan in 1908. By the 1930s there was evident need to update Study’s article, and Richard Brauer was commissioned to write on the topic for the project. As it turned out, when Brauer had his manuscript prepared in Toronto in 1936, though it was accepted for publication, politics and war intervened.  Nevertheless, Brauer kept his manuscript through the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, and in 1979 it was publishedMathematical Journal of Okayama University 21:53–89 by Okayama University in Japan. It also appeared posthumously as paper #22 in the first volume of his Collected Papers.  His title was \"Algebra der hyperkomplexen Zahlensysteme (Algebren)\". Unlike the articles by Study and Cartan, which were exploratory, Brauer’s article reads as a modern abstract algebra text with its universal coverage. Consider his introduction:\nIn the beginning of the 19th century, the usual complex numbers and their introduction through computations with number-pairs or points in the plane, became a general tool of mathematicians. Naturally the question arose whether or not a similar \"hypercomplex\" number can be defined using points of n-dimensional space. As it turns out, such extension of the system of real numbers requires the concession of some of the usual axioms (Weierstrass 1863). The selection of rules of computation, which cannot be avoided in hypercomplex numbers, naturally allows some choice. Yet in any cases set out, the resulting number systems allow a unique theory with regard to their structural properties and their classification. Further, one desires that these theories stand in close connection with other areas of mathematics, wherewith the possibility of their applications is given.\n\nWhile still in Königsberg in 1929, Brauer published an article in Mathematische Zeitschrift \"Über Systeme hyperkomplexer Zahlen\"Mathematische Zeitschrift 30:79–107, paper #7 in Collected Papers  which was primarily concerned with integral domains (Nullteilerfrei systeme) and the field theory which he used later in Toronto.\n\nPublications\n\n See also \n Brauer algebra\n Brauer group, the equivalence classes of brauer algebras over the same field F equipped with a group operation\n Brauer–Cartan–Hua theorem\n Brauer–Nesbitt theorem\n Brauer–Manin obstruction\n Brauer–Siegel theorem\n Brauer–Suzuki theorem\n Brauer's theorem\n Brauer's theorem on induced characters\n Brauer characters\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n  Review\n Charles W.

      "text": "Joel Lee Brenner ( – ) was an American mathematician who specialized in matrix theory, linear algebra, and group theory. He is known as the translator of several popular Russian texts. He was a teaching professor at some dozen colleges and universities and was a Senior Mathematician at Stanford Research Institute from 1956 to 1968. He published over one hundred scholarly papers, 35 with coauthors, and wrote book reviews.LeRoy B. Beasley (1987) \"The Mathematical Work of Joel Lee Brenner\", Linear Algebra and its Applications 90:1–13\n\nAcademic career\nIn 1930 Brenner earned a B.A. degree with major in chemistry from Harvard University. In graduate study there he was influenced by Hans Brinkmann, Garrett Birkhoff, and Marshall Stone. He was granted the Ph.D. in February 1936. Brenner later described some of his reminiscences of his student days at Harvard and of the state of American mathematics in the 1930s in an article for American Mathematical Monthly.Brenner (1979) \"Student Days\", American Mathematical Monthly 86: 359–6\n\nIn 1951 Brenner published his findings about matrices with quaternion entries. He developed the idea of a characteristic root of a quaternion matrix (an eigenvalue) and shows that they must exist. He also shows that a quaternion matrix is unitarily-equivalent to a triangular matrix.\n\nIn 1956 he became a Senior Mathematician at Stanford Research Institute.\nBrenner, in collaboration with Donald W. Bushaw and S. Evanusa, assisted in the translation and revision of Felix Gantmacher's Applications of the Theory of Matrices (1959).George Weiss (1960) Review Applications of the Theory of Matrices, Science 131: 405,6, issue #3398\n\nBrenner translated Nikolaj Nikolaevič Krasovskii's book Stability of motion: applications of Lyapunov's second method to differential systems and equations with delay (1963). He also translated and edited the book Problems in differential equations by Aleksei Fedorovich Filippov.\n\nBrenner translated Problems in Higher AlgebraСборник задач по высшей алгебре by D. K. Faddeev and I.S. Sominiski. The exercises in this book covered complex numbers, roots of unity, as well as some linear algebra and abstract algebra.\n\nIn 1959 Brenner generalized propositions by Alexander Ostrowski and G. B. Price on minors of a diagonally dominant matrix. His work is credited with stimulating a reawakening of interest in the permanent of a matrix.Henryk Minc (1978) Permanents, page 13, Encyclopedia of Mathematics and its Applications volume 6, Addison-Wesley\n\nOne of the challenges in linear algebra is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a square matrix of complex numbers. In 1931 S. A. Gershgorin described geometric bounds on the eigenvectors in terms of the matrix elements. This result known as the Gershgorin circle theorem has been used as a basis for extension. In 1964 Brenner reported on Theorems of Gersgorin Type.Brenner (January 1964) Theorems of Gersgorin type, citation from Defense Technical Information Center. In 1967 at University of Wisconsin—Madison, working in the Mathematics Research Center, he produced a technical report New root-location theorems for partitioned matrices.J. L. Brenner (1967) New root-location theorems for partitioned matrices, citation from Defense Technical Information Center\n\nIn 1968 Brenner, following Alston Householder, published \"Gersgorin theorems by Householder’s proof\".Brenner (1968) Gersgorin theorems by Householder’s proof, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 74:3 , link from Project Euclid In 1970 he published the survey article (21 references) \"Gersgorin theorems, regularity theorems, and bounds for determinants of partitioned matrices\".Brenner (1970) \"Gersgorin theorems, regularity theorems, and bounds for determinants of partitioned matrices\", SIAM Journal for Applied Mathematics 19(2) The article was extended with \"Some determinantal identities\".Brenner (1971) ) Gersgorin theorems, regularity theorems, and bounds for determinants of partitioned matrices, and some determinantal identities, Pacific Journal of Mathematics 39(1), link from Project Euclid\n\nIn 1971 Brenner extended his geometry of the spectrum of a square complex matrix deeper into abstract algebra with his paper \"Regularity theorems and Gersgorin theorems for matrices over rings with valuation\".Brenner (1971) Regularity theorems and Gersgorin theorems for matrices over rings with valuation, Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics 1(3), link from Project Euclid He writes, \"Theorems can be extended to non-commutative domains, in particular to quaternion matrices. Secondly, the ring of polynomials has a valuation ... a different type of regularity ...\"\n\nCollaborations\n\nJoel Lee Brenner was a member of the American Mathematical Society from 1936.\n\nBeasley relates that he\nwas a graduate student and [Brenner] was visiting the University of British Columbia in 1966-67. Shortly after arriving at UBC, Joel circulated a memo to all the graduate students, informing them that he had several open problems in various areas of mathematics and would share them with willing students. Hoping to get a problem in group theory that I might work into a thesis, I went to his office and inquired about the problems. He presented me the Van der Waerden conjecture, which he informed me would be quite difficult, and after defining the permanent for me sent me off with several problems concerning the permanent function. His encouragement and enthusiasm persevered through several \"proofs\" of the Van der Waerden conjecture, and soon some of the less well-known problems had been solved. He would always tell me how a proposed attack would work and leave me to fight out the details. Those exchanges led to the publication of my first paper, and I became his thirteenth coauthor. By the time Joel had left UBC in the spring of 1967, I was firmly entrenched in matrix theory.\n\nIn 1981 Brenner and Roger Lyndon collaborated to polish an idea due to H. W. Kuhn for proving the fundamental theorem of algebra. In the solution by Eric S. Rosenthal to a problem in the American Mathematical Monthly posted by Harry D. Ruderman,Solution to problem #6192, American Mathematical Monthly 86: 598 Kuhn’s work from 1974 was cited. A query was made and prompted an article by Brenner and Lyndon.J. L. Brenner & R. C. Lyndon (1981) \"Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\", American Mathematical Monthly 88(4):254–6 The version of the fundamental theorem stated was as follows:\nLet P(z) be a non-constant polynomial with complex coefficients. Then there is a positive number S > 0, depending only on P, with the following property:\n for every δ > 0 there is a complex number z such that |z| ≤ S and |P(z)| < δ .\n\nBrenner ultimately acquired 35 coauthors in his publications.\n\nAlternating group\nGiven an ordered set Ω with n elements, the even permutations on it determine the alternating group An. In 1960 Brenner proposed the following research problem in group theory:Brenner (1960) Research Problem in Group Theory, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 66(4):275 For which An does there exist an element an such that every element g is similar to a commutator of an? Brenner states that the property is true for 4 < n < 10; in symbols it may be expressed\n\nThe alternating groups are simple groups, and in 1971 Brenner began a series of articles titled \"Covering theorems for finite simple groups\". He was interested in the cycle type of cyclic permutations, and when An ⊂ C C, where C is a conjugacy class of a certain type.Brenner, R.M. Cranwell, and J.

      "text": "This English mathematician is sometimes confused with the Irish mathematician William Snow Burnside (1839-1920).\n\n__NOTOC__\n\nWilliam Burnside (2 July 1852 – 21 August 1927) was an English mathematician. He is known mostly as an early researcher in the theory of finite groups.\n\nBurnside was born in London, and attended St. John's and Pembroke Colleges at the University of Cambridge, where he was the Second Wrangler in 1875. He lectured at Cambridge for the following ten years, before being appointed professor of mathematics at the Royal Naval College in Greenwich. While this was a little outside the main centres of British mathematical research, Burnside remained a very active researcher, publishing more than 150 papers in his career.\n\nBurnside's early research was in applied mathematics. This work was of sufficient distinction to merit his election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1893, though it is little remembered today. Around the same time as his election his interests turned to the study of finite groups. This was not a widely studied subject in Britain in the late 19th century, and it took some years for his research in this area to gain widespread recognition.\n\nThe central part of Burnside's group theory work was in the area of group representations, where he helped to develop some of the foundational theory, complementing, and sometimes competing with, the work of Ferdinand Georg Frobenius, who began his research in the subject during the 1890s. One of Burnside's best known contributions to group theory is his paqb theorem, which shows that every finite group whose order is divisible by fewer than three distinct primes is solvable.\n\nIn 1897 Burnside's classic work Theory of Groups of Finite Order was published. The second edition (pub. 1911) was for many decades the standard work in the field. A major difference between the editions was the inclusion of character theory in the second.G. B. Mathews(1911) Theory of Groups of Finite Order from Nature 88:170,1 (#2197)\n\nBurnside is also remembered for the formulation of Burnside's problem that concerns the question of bounding the size of a group if there are fixed bounds both on the order of all of its elements and the number of elements  needed to generate it, and also for Burnside's lemma (a formula relating the number of orbits of a permutation group acting on a set with the number of fixed points of each of its elements) though the latter had been discovered earlier and independently by Frobenius and Augustin Cauchy.\n\nHe received an honorary doctorate (D.Sc.) from the University of Dublin in June 1901.\n\nIn addition to his mathematical work, Burnside was a noted rower. While he was a lecturer at Cambridge, he also coached the rowing crew team. In fact, his obituary in The Times took more interest in his athletic career, calling him \"one of the best known Cambridge athletes of his day\".\n\nHe is buried at the West Wickham Parish Church in South London.\n\nBooks\n\n;  \n\nSee also\nBurnside theorem\nBurnside's lemma\nBurnside ring\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Review\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n \n\nCategory:1852 births\nCategory:1927 deaths\nCategory:19th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:20th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge\nCategory:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge\nCategory:Academics of the Royal Naval College, Greenwich\nCategory:Royal Medal winners\nCategory:Second Wranglers\nCategory:Fellows of the Royal Society\nCategory:De Morgan Medallists"

Cannon proved that the double suspension of a homology sphere is a topological sphere.J. W. Cannon, The recognition problem: what is a topological manifold?\nBulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 84 (1978), no. 5, pp. 832–866.J. W. Cannon, Shrinking cell-like decompositions of manifolds. Codimension three. Annals of Mathematics (2), 110 (1979), no. 1, 83–112. R. D. Edwards had previously proven this in many cases.\n\nThe results of Cannon's paper were used by Cannon, Bryant and Lacher to prove (1979)J. W. Cannon, J. L. Bryant and R. C. Lacher, The structure of generalized manifolds having nonmanifold set of trivial dimension. Geometric topology (Proc. Georgia Topology Conf., Athens, Ga., 1977), pp. 261–300, Academic Press, New York-London, 1979. . an important case of the so-called characterization conjecture for topological manifolds. The conjecture says that a generalized n-manifold , where , which satisfies the \"disjoint disk property\" is a topological manifold. Cannon, Bryant and Lacher established that the conjecture holds under the assumption that  be a manifold except possibly at a set of dimension . Later Frank QuinnFrank Quinn. Resolutions of homology manifolds, and the topological characterization of manifolds. Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 72 (1983), no. 2, pp. 267–284. completed the proof that the characterization conjecture holds if there is even a single manifold point.  In general, the conjecture is false as was proved by John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and Shmuel Weinberger.John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and Shmuel Weinberger, Topology of homology manifolds, Annals of Mathematics 143 (1996), pp. 435-467; \n\n1980s: Hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifolds and geometric group theory\nIn 1980s the focus of Cannon's work shifted to the study of 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry and Kleinian groups and he is considered one of the key figures in the birth of geometric group theory as a distinct subject in late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannon's 1984 paper \"The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups\"J. W. Cannon, The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 16 (1984), no. 2, pp. 123–148. was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of Mikhail Gromov.M. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in: \"Essays in Group Theory\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75–263. Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the Cayley graphs of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the hyperbolic space. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit finite presentations where the Dehn algorithm solves the word problem. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being word-hyperbolic and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in word-hyperbolic groups is solvable by Dehn's algorithm.R. B. Sher, R. J. Daverman. Handbook of Geometric Topology. Elsevier, 2001. ; p. 299. Cannon's 1984 paper also introduced an important notion a cone type of an element of a finitely generated group (roughly, the set of all geodesic extensions of an element). Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a rational function. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the word-hyperbolic group context. Now standard proofs of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a word-hyperbolic group is a regular language also use finiteness of the number of cone types.\n\nCannon's work also introduced an important notion of almost convexity for Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups,James W. Cannon. Almost convex groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 22 (1987), no. 2, pp. 197–210. a notion that led to substantial further study and generalizations.S. Hermiller and J.

Indeed, preprint versions are referenced in more than 30 published articles, going back as early as 1990\"</ref> introduced the notion of what is now called the Cannon–Thurston map. They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M that fibers over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface S. In this case the universal cover of S, which is identified with the hyperbolic plane, admits an embedding into the universal cover of M, which is the hyperbolic 3-space. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous π1(S)-equivariant surjective map (now called the Cannon–Thurston map) from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space (the 2-sphere).\nAlthough the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of Mahan Mitra,Mahan Mitra.

Mathematische Zeitschrift, vol. 255 (2007), no. 1, pp. 35–76. and others.\n\n1990s and 2000s: Automatic groups, discrete conformal geometry and Cannon's conjecture\nCannon was one of the co-authors of the 1992 book \"Word Processing in Groups\"David B. A. Epstein, James W. Cannon, Derek F. Holt, Silvio V. Levy, Michael S. Paterson, William P. Thurston. Word processing in groups. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, MA, 1992. . which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of automatic groups. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from computer science to geometric group theory and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s.\n\nA 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\"James W. Cannon. The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem. Acta Mathematica 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155–234. that was motivated by the classic Riemann mapping theorem in complex analysis. The goal was to understand when an action of a group by homeomorphisms on a 2-sphere is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard Riemann sphere by Möbius transformations. The \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual conformal structure on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998 (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as Cannon's conjecture, regarding characterizing word-hyperbolic groups with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in ) states that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, then G admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the hyperbolic 3-space (so that G is essentially a 3-dimensional Kleinian group). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the Cayley graph of G'', is quasisymmetric to the standard 2-sphere.\n\nThe 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard \"disks\" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial \"conformal\" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. Sufficiently rich families of planar rings. Annales Academiæ Scientiarium Fennicæ. Mathematica. vol. 24 (1999), no. 2, pp. 265–304.J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry. Finite subdivision rules.

Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 10 (2006), pp. 63–99.\n\nCannon's conjecture motivated much of subsequent work by other mathematicians and to a substantial degree informed subsequent interaction between geometric group theory and the theory of analysis on metric spaces.M.

International Congress of Mathematicians. Vol. II, pp. 743–768, Eur. Math. Soc., Zürich, 2006. . Cannon's conjecture was motivated (see J. W. Cannon and E. L. Swenson, Recognizing constant curvature discrete groups in dimension 3. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 350 (1998), no. 2, pp. 809–849.) by Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and by trying to understand why in dimension three variable negative curvature can be promoted to constant negative curvature. Although the Geometrization conjecture was recently settled by Perelman, Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in geometric group theory and geometric topology.\n\nApplications to biology\nThe ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\", were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry. Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65–82. World Scientific, 2000. , . Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same. Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue. They suggested that the \"negatively curved\" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar fractals. In particular they suggested (see section 3.4 of ) that such \"negatively curved\" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.\n\nSelected publications\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSee also\n\nGeometric group theory\nLow-dimensional topology\nWord-hyperbolic group\nGeometrization conjecture\nHyperbolic manifold\nKleinian group\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nJames Cannon's webpage at BYU\n\nCategory:1943 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Topologists\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars\nCategory:University of Utah alumni\nCategory:University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty\nCategory:Brigham Young University faculty\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:Sloan Research Fellows\nCategory:Mathematicians from Pennsylvania\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Utah\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Pennsylvania\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Wisconsin"

      "text": "Arthur Byron Coble (November 3, 1878 – December 8, 1966) was an American mathematician. He did research on finite geometries and the group theory related to them, Cremona transformations associated with the Galois theory of equations, and the relations between hyperelliptic theta functions, irrational binary invariants, the Weddle surface and the Kummer surface. He was President of the American Mathematical Society from 1933 to 1934.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\nArthur Coble was born on November 3, 1878 in Williamstown, Pennsylvania. His mother Emma was a schoolteacher. When Coble was born, his father Ruben was the manager of a store. Later, he became president of a bank. Coble's parents belonged to Evangelical Lutheran Church. Coble was brought up strictly as an Evangelical Lutheran; however, he rejected this Church when he reached adulthood.\n\nCoble entered Gettysburg College in 1893, and completed his A.B. in 1897. He spent a year as a public school teacher. He entered Johns Hopkins University in 1898 to pursue his graduate studies. He completed his Ph.D. from the university in 1902. His Ph.D. thesis was The Relation of the Quartic Curve to Conics. His thesis supervisor was English-born mathematician Frank Morley. Later, Coble recalled how Morley made it \"a cardinal point to have on hand a sufficient variety of thesis problems to accommodate particular tastes and capacities.\"\n\nAcademic career\nIn 1902, Coble became an instructor in mathematics at the University of Missouri. One year later, in 1903, he was appointed to Johns Hopkins University as Morley's research assistant. In 1903, he published his doctoral dissertation as The quartic curve as related to conics in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society and took up the research assistant position in Baltimore, Maryland. In 1902, American businessman Andrew Carnegie founded the Carnegie Institution of Washington. The research of Coble and Morley were one of the first pieces of research the Institution supported. The funding of the Institute was generous enough to allow Coble to use the grant to travel abroad. He traveled to Germany where he studied at Greifswald University and the University of Bonn. He wanted to work with Eduard Study, who was well known to mathematicians at Johns Hopkins University because he had taught there in 1893.\n\nCoble returned to the United States for the start of the 1904-05 session. He was appointed an instructor in mathematics at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCoble married Abby Walker Adams Whitney in 1905. They had four children.\n\nCoble was promoted to associate professor at Johns Hopkins University in 1909. He left Johns Hopkins after he was offered a full professorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in 1918. He remained at Illinois for the rest of his career. He was a visiting professor at the University of Chicago in 1919 and was at Johns Hopkins University in 1927-28. He became head of the Department of Mathematics at the UIUC in 1934 and he held that position until his retirement in 1947. During these years, Coble served on many University and College Committees, including eleven years on the University Council and eight years on the Executive Committee of the UIUC College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.\n\nAmerican Mathematical Society\nCoble was active with the American Mathematical Society (AMS) from 1912 to 1940. He was vice-president of the AMS in 1917. From 1920 to 1925, he edited the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. He also was involved with editing the American Journal of Mathematics over many years between 1918 and 1933. From 1933 to 1934, he was President of the AMS. At that time, the AMS was in some financial difficulties. Coble dealt with the problem effectively.\n\nLater life\nBy the time he retired in 1947 his health was already deteriorating due to Parkinson's disease. After his retirement, he accepted a one-year post at Haverford College but after teaching for one semester he resigned due to poor health. In 1956, he was involved in a car crash. Because of that crash, he was unable to walk without assistance.  He then moved to Lykens, Pennsylvania and spent his final ten years of his life there. He died on December 8, 1966 in a hospital in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nResearch\nEarly mathematical research papers written by Coble when he was teaching at Johns Hopkins University, include: On the relation between the three-parameter groups of a cubic space curve and a quadric surface (1906); An application of the form-problems associated with certain Cremona groups to the solution of equations of higher degree (1908); An application of Moore's cross-ratio group to the solution of the sextic equation (1911); An application of finite geometry to the characteristic theory of the odd and even theta functions (1913); and Point sets and allied Cremona groups (1915).\n\nCoble was interested in finite geometries and the related group theory, and in the Cremona transformations related to the Galois theory of equations. Later in his career, Coble also studied the relations between hyperelliptic theta functions, irrational binary invariants, the Weddle surface and the Kummer surface.\n\nCoble published the monograph Algebraic geometry and theta functions in the tenth volume of American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications in 1929, and it was republished by the American Mathematical Society in 1961 and 1982.\n\nCoble published Configurations defined by theta functions, which reviewed the invariant theory of Cremona transformations as developed by Coble in his earlier papers, in the Duke Mathematical Journal in 1939. A linear homogeneous transformation with integral coefficients is associated with a Cremona transformation. These transformations form a group, which Coble studied.\n\nIn 1940, Coble published Trilinear forms in the Duke Mathematical Journal. In 1946, he published Ternary and quaternary elimination, which extends work by mathematicians Francis Sowerby Macaulay and Bartel Leendert van der Waerden, and also extends work done by Frank Morley and Coble some 20 years earlier.\n\nSee also\nCoble curve\nCoble surface\nCoble variety\nCoble hypersurface\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n \n Arthur B.

      "text": "Max Wilhelm Dehn (November 13, 1878 – June 27, 1952) was a German-born American mathematician most famous for his work in geometry, topology and geometric group theory.\n\nDehn was a student of David Hilbert, and in his habilitation in 1900 Dehn resolved Hilbert's third problem, making him the first to resolve one of Hilbert's well-known 23 problems. Dehn's students include Ott-Heinrich Keller, Ruth Moufang, Wilhelm Magnus, and the artist Dorothea Rockburne.\n\nBiography\nDehn was born to a Jewish familyBergmann, Birgit and  Moritz Epple, and Ruti Ungar \"Transcending Tradition: Jewish Mathematicians in German Speaking Academic Culture\" 2012 in Hamburg, Imperial Germany.\n\nHe studied the foundations of geometry with Hilbert at Göttingen in 1899, and obtained a proof of the Jordan curve theorem for polygons. In 1900 he wrote his dissertation on the role of the Legendre angle sum theorem in axiomatic geometry. \nFrom 1900 to 1911 he was an employee and researcher at the University of Münster. In his habilitation at the University of Münster in 1900 he resolved Hilbert's third problem, by introducing what was afterwards called the Dehn invariant. This was the first resolution of one of the Hilbert Problems.\n\nDehn's interests later turned to topology and combinatorial group theory. In 1907 he wrote with Poul Heegaard the first book on the foundations of combinatorial topology, then known as analysis situs. Also in 1907, he described the construction of a new homology sphere. In 1908 he believed that he had found a proof of the Poincaré conjecture, but Tietze found an error.\n\nIn 1910 Dehn published a paper on three-dimensional topology in which he introduced Dehn surgery and used it to construct homology spheres. He also stated Dehn's lemma, but an error was found in his proof by Hellmuth Kneser in 1929. The result was proved in 1957 by Christos Papakyriakopoulos. The word problem for groups, also called the Dehn problem, was posed by him in 1911.\n\nDehn married Antonie Landau on August 23, 1912. Also in 1912, Dehn invented what is now known as Dehn's algorithm and used it in his work on the word and conjugacy problems for groups. The notion of a Dehn function in geometric group theory, which estimates the area of a relation in a finitely presented group in terms of the length of that relation, is also named after him. In 1914 he proved that the left and right trefoil knots are not equivalent. In the early 1920s Dehn introduced the result that would come to be known as the Dehn-Nielsen theorem; its proof would be published in 1927 by Jakob Nielsen.\n\nIn 1922 Dehn succeeded Ludwig Bieberbach at Frankfurt, where he stayed until he was forced to retire in 1935. He stayed in Germany until January 1939, when he fled to Copenhagen, and then to Trondheim, Norway, where he took a position at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. In October 1940 he left Norway for America by way of Siberia and Japan (the Atlantic crossing was considered too dangerous).\n\nIn America, Dehn obtained a position at Idaho Southern University (now Idaho State University). In 1942 he took a job at the Illinois Institute of Technology, and in 1943 he moved to St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland. Finally in 1945, he moved to the experimental arts college, Black Mountain College, where he was the only mathematician.\n\nHe died in Black Mountain, North Carolina in 1952.\n\nBlack Mountain College\nIn March 1944, Dehn was invited to give two talks at Black Mountain College on the philosophy and history of mathematics. He noted in a letter that a lecture on an advanced mathematical topic didn't seem appropriate given the audience. He instead offered up the lectures \"Common roots of mathematics and ornamentics,\" and \"Some moments in the development of mathematical ideas.\" Black Mountain College faculty contacted him shortly after concerning a full-time position. After negotiating his salary from $25 to $40 per month, Dehn and his wife moved into housing provided by the school and he began teaching in January 1945.\n\nWhile at Black Mountain College, Dehn taught courses in Mathematics, Philosophy, Greek, and Italian. In his class \"Geometry for Artists,\" Dehn introduced students to geometric concepts such as points, lines, planes and solids; cones sectioned into circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas; spheres and regular polyhedrons. His classes had an emphasis on the way shapes relate to each other, a concept that can be useful in artistic mediums.\n\nHe enjoyed the forested mountains found in Black Mountain, and would often hold class in the woods, giving lectures during hikes. His lectures frequently drifted off topic on tangents about philosophy, the arts, and nature and their connection to mathematics. He and his wife took part in community meetings and often ate in the dining room. They also regularly had long breakfasts with Buckminster Fuller and his wife.\n\nIn the summer of 1952 Dehn was made Professor Emeritus, which allowed him to remain on campus and act as an advisor. Unfortunately he died of an embolism shortly after witnessing the removal of several dogwood trees from the campus.  He is buried in the woods on the campus.\n\nSee also\nCauchy's theorem\nDehn's lemma\nDehn plane\nDehn surgery\nDehn twist\nDehn–Sommerville equations\nScissors congruence (Dehn invariant)\n\nReferences\n\n Max Dehn, Papers on group theory and topology.

      "text": "Marcus Peter Francis du Sautoy  (; Miller, G. M., ed. (1971) BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names. London: Oxford University Press; p. Du born 26 August 1965) is a British mathematician, author, and populariser of science and mathematics. In 1996 he was awarded the Title of Distinction of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford and in 2008, he was appointed to the Simonyi Professorship for the Public Understanding of Science and a fellowship at New College. He was formerly a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford and Wadham College, Oxford. He was previously President of the Mathematical Association, an Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) Senior Media Fellow, and a Royal Society University Research Fellow.Marcus du Sautoy \n\nEducation and early life\nDu Sautoy was born in London, grew up in Henley-on-Thames and was educated at Gillotts Comprehensive School and King James's Sixth Form College (now Henley College) and Wadham College, Oxford, where he was awarded a first class honours degree in Mathematics. He went on to complete a doctorate in mathematics on discrete groups, analytic groups and Poincaré series in 1991 supervised by Dan Segal.\n\nCareer and research\nMathematical research\nthumb|right|Marcus du Sautoy in 2007\n\nAccording to the Royal Society, his research \"uses classical tools from number theory to explore the mathematics of symmetry\".  Du Sautoy's academic work concerns mainly group theory and number theory.  The former discipline is the study of symmetries and the latter discipline the study of the integers, particularly regarding factorization and the primes.  \n\nPopularisation of mathematics\nDu Sautoy is known for his work popularising mathematics, and has been named by The Independent on Sunday as one of the UK's leading scientists.  He is also on the advisory board of Mangahigh.com (an online maths game website).   \n\nIn voice\nDu Sautoy has promoted BBC Radio 4's Today programme and is a regular contributor to the same network's In Our Time.  \n\nIn December 2006, du Sautoy delivered the 2006 Royal Institution Christmas Lectures under the collective title The Num8er My5teries. This was only the third time the subject of the lectures had been mathematics – on the first occasion in 1978, when the lecture was delivered by Erik Christopher Zeeman, du Sautoy had been a schoolboy in the audience. \n\nIn print\nDu Sautoy typically writes for The Times and The Guardian.  Du Sautoy has also written numerous academic articles and books on mathematics, the most recent being a print adaptation of his Christmas Lectures (see ), also titled The Num8er My5teries. \n\nIn a 2006 article published in Seed magazine, du Sautoy discussed the Hilbert-Pólya conjecture: a way for advances in quantum physics to provide insight into the Riemann hypothesis.  \n\nOn TV\nDu Sautoy presented the BBC Four television programme, Mind Games, and co-hosts the TV series School of Hard Sums with Dara Ó Briain.  On the latter show, he poses three mathematical questions with real-world application.  Ó Briain and a guest then try to solve the problems, using rigorous and experimental methods, respectively.  \n\nDu Sautoy has also appeared on Channel 4 News.  \n\nPublications\nThe Music of the Primes (Fourth Estate, 2003, )\nFinding Moonshine (UK title, Fourth Estate, 2007, )\nSymmetry: A Journey into the Patterns of Nature (US title, 2008, )\nThe Num8er My5teries: A Mathematical Odyssey Through Everyday Life (Fourth Estate, 2010, )\nWhat We Cannot Know (Fourth Estate, 2016, )\nThe Great Unknown: Seven Journeys to the Frontiers of Science (Viking, 2017, )\nThe Creativity Code: How AI Is Learning to Write, Paint and Think (Harper Colin Publishers Australia, 2019, )\n\nTelevision work\n\n Mindgames (BBC Four, 2004-5).

He moved to the United States in 1946 where he became an undergraduate at the University of Chicago. He did his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, and became a professor at Cornell University in 1952, and at Yale University in 1964.\n\nHis most famous result is his joint, with John G. Thompson, proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem that all finite groups of odd order are solvable. At the time it was written, it was probably the most complicated and difficult mathematical proof ever completed. He wrote almost a hundred other papers, mostly on finite group theory, character theory (in particular introducing the concept of a coherent set of characters), and modular representation theory. Another regular theme in his research was the study of linear groups of small degree, that is, finite groups of matrices in low dimensions. It was often the case that, while the conclusions concerned groups of complex matrices, the techniques employed were from modular representation theory.\n\nHe also wrote the books:\nThe representation theory of finite groups and \nCharacters of finite groups, which are now standard references on character theory, including treatments of modular representations\nand modular characters.\n\nFeit was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Nice in 1970. \nHe was awarded the Cole Prize by the American Mathematical Society in 1965, and was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

      "text": "Ferdinand Georg Frobenius (26 October 1849 – 3 August 1917) was a German mathematician, best known for his contributions to the theory of elliptic functions, differential equations, number theory, and to group theory. He is known for the famous determinantal identities, known as Frobenius–Stickelberger formulae, governing elliptic functions, and for developing the theory of biquadratic forms. He was also the first to introduce the notion of rational approximations of functions (nowadays known as Padé approximants), and gave the first full proof for the Cayley–Hamilton theorem. He also lent his name to certain differential-geometric objects in modern mathematical physics, known as Frobenius manifolds.\n\nBiography\nFerdinand Georg Frobenius was born on 26 October 1849 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin from parents Christian Ferdinand Frobenius, a Protestant parson, and Christine Elizabeth Friedrich. He entered the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in 1860 when he was nearly eleven. In 1867, after graduating, he went to the University of Göttingen where he began his university studies but he only studied there for one semester before returning to Berlin, where he attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer and Karl Weierstrass. He received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. His thesis, supervised by Weierstrass, was on the solution of differential equations. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level first at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium then at the Sophienrealschule, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. Frobenius was only in Berlin a year before he went to Zürich to take up an appointment as an ordinary professor at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum. For seventeen years, between 1875 and 1892, Frobenius worked in Zürich. It was there that he married, brought up his family, and did much important work in widely differing areas of mathematics. In the last days of December 1891 Kronecker died and, therefore, his chair in Berlin became vacant. Weierstrass, strongly believing that Frobenius was the right person to keep Berlin in the forefront of mathematics, used his considerable influence to have Frobenius appointed. In 1893 he returned to Berlin, where he was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences.\n\nContributions to group theory\nGroup theory was one of Frobenius' principal interests in the second half of his career. One of his first  contributions was the proof of the Sylow theorems for abstract groups. Earlier proofs had been for permutation groups. His proof of the first Sylow theorem (on the existence of Sylow groups) is one of those frequently used today.\n\n Frobenius also has proved the following fundamental theorem: If a positive integer n divides the order |G| of a finite group G, then the number of solutions of the equation xn = 1 in G is equal to kn for some positive integer k. He also posed the following problem: If, in the above theorem, k = 1, then the solutions of the equation xn = 1 in G form a subgroup. Many years ago this problem was solved for solvable groups.  Only in 1991, after the classification of finite simple groups, this problem was solved in general.\n\nMore important was his creation of the theory of group characters and group representations, which are fundamental tools for studying the structure of groups. This work led to the notion of Frobenius reciprocity and the definition of what are now called Frobenius groups.  A group G is said to be a Frobenius group if there is a subgroup H < G such that\n for all .\n\nIn that case, the set\n\ntogether with the identity element of G forms a subgroup which is nilpotent as John G. Thompson showed in 1959. All known proofs of that theorem make use of characters. In his first paper about characters (1896), Frobenius constructed the character table of the group  of order (1/2)(p3 − p) for all odd primes p (this group is simple provided p > 3). He also made fundamental contributions to the representation theory of the symmetric and alternating groups.\n\nContributions to number theory\n\nFrobenius introduced a canonical way of turning primes into conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q.  Specifically, if K/Q is a finite Galois extension then to each (positive) prime p which does not ramify in K and to each prime ideal P lying over p in K there is a unique element g of Gal(K/Q) satisfying the condition g(x) = xp (mod P) for all integers x of K. Varying P over p changes g into a conjugate (and every conjugate of g occurs in this way), so the conjugacy class of g in the Galois group is canonically associated to p.  This is called the Frobenius conjugacy class of p and any element of \nthe conjugacy class is called a Frobenius element of p.   If we take for K the mth cyclotomic field, whose Galois group over Q is the units modulo m (and thus \nis abelian, so conjugacy classes become elements), then for p not dividing m the Frobenius class in the Galois group is p mod m.   From this point of view, \nthe distribution of Frobenius conjugacy classes in Galois groups over Q (or, more generally, Galois groups over any number field) generalizes Dirichlet's classical result about primes in arithmetic progressions.   The study of Galois groups of infinite-degree extensions of Q depends crucially on this construction of Frobenius elements, which provides in a sense a dense subset of elements which are accessible to detailed study.\n\nSee also\nList of things named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius\n\nPublications\n\nDe functionum analyticarum unius variabilis per series infinitas repraesentatione (in Latin), Dissertation, 1870\nÜber die Entwicklung analytischer Functionen in Reihen, die nach gegebenen Functionen fortschreiten (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 73, 1–30 (1871)\nÜber die algebraische Auflösbarkeit der Gleichungen, deren Coefficienten rationale Functionen einer Variablen sind (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 74, 254–272 (1872)\nÜber den Begriff der Irreductibilität in der Theorie der linearen Differentialgleichungen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 76, 236–270 (1873)\nÜber die Integration der linearen Differentialgleichungen durch Reihen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 76, 214–235 (1873)\nÜber die Determinante mehrerer Functionen einer Variablen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 77, 245–257 (1874)\nÜber die Vertauschung von Argument und Parameter in den Integralen der linearen Differentialgleichungen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 78, 93–96 (1874)\nAnwendungen der Determinantentheorie auf die Geometrie des Maaßes (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 79, 185–247 (1875)\nÜber algebraisch integrirbare lineare Differentialgleichungen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 80, 183–193 (1875)\nÜber das Pfaffsche Problem (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 82, 230–315 (1875)\nÜber die regulären Integrale der linearen Differentialgleichungen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 80, 317–333 (1875)\nNote sur la théorie des formes quadratiques à un nombre quelconque de variables (in French), Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences Paris 85, 131–133 (1877)\nZur Theorie der elliptischen Functionen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 83, 175–179 (1877)\nÜber adjungirte lineare Differentialausdrücke (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 85, 185–213 (1878)\nÜber lineare Substitutionen und bilineare Formen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 84, 1–63 (1878)\nÜber homogene totale Differentialgleichungen (in German), Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik 86, 1–19 (1879)\nUeber Matrizen aus nicht negativen Elementen (in German), Sitzungsberichte der Königlich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 26, 456—477 (1912)\n\nReferences\n\n Review\n\nExternal links\n\nG.

      "title": "Évariste Galois",

      "text": "Évariste Galois (;\"Galois theory\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 25 October 1811 – 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician and political activist. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.\n\n Life \n\n Early life \nGalois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Adélaïde-Marie (née Demante). His father was a Republican and was head of Bourg-la-Reine's liberal party. His father became mayor of the village after Louis XVIII returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a jurist, was a fluent reader of Latin and classical literature and was responsible for her son's education for his first twelve years.\n\nthumb|right|The Cour d'honneur of the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, which Galois attended as a boy.\nIn October 1823, he entered the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, At the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in mathematics.\n\nHe found a copy of Adrien-Marie Legendre's Éléments de Géométrie, which, it is said, he read \"like a novel\" and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, such as the Réflexions sur la résolution algébrique des équations which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and Leçons sur le calcul des fonctions, work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired, and his teachers accused him of affecting ambition and originality in a negative way.\n\n Budding mathematician \nIn 1828, he attempted the entrance examination for the École Polytechnique, the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the École Normale (then known as l'École préparatoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.\n\nthumb|right|Augustin-Louis Cauchy reviewed Galois' early mathematical papers.\nIn the following year Galois' first paper, on continued fractions, was published. It was at around the same time that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this topic to the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois' work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the Academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time, though with political views that were at the opposite end from Galois', considered Galois' work to be a likely winner.\n\nOn 28 July 1829, Galois' father committed suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest. A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique, and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; however, accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.\n\nHaving been denied admission to the Polytechnique, Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the École Normale. He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829. His examiner in mathematics reported, \"This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research.\"\n\nHe submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime due to various events. Though his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary Joseph Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year, one of which laid the foundations for Galois theory. The second one was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology). The third was an important one in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.\n\n Political firebrand \n\nthumb|right|Battle for the Town Hall by Jean-Victor Schnetz. Galois, as a staunch republican, would have wanted to participate in the July Revolution of 1830 but was prevented by the director of the École Normale.\nGalois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. Charles X had succeeded Louis XVIII in 1824, but in 1827 his party suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d'état, and issued his notorious July Ordinances, touching off the July Revolution which ended with Louis-Philippe becoming king. While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets during les Trois Glorieuses, Galois and all the other students at the École Normale were locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the Gazette des Écoles, signing the letter with his full name. Although the Gazettes editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.\n\nAlthough his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois' former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.\n\nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous, and Galois proposed a toast to King Louis Philippe with a dagger above his cup, which was interpreted as a threat against the king's life. He was arrested the following day but was acquitted on 15 June 1831.\n\nOn the following Bastille Day (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested. On 23 October, he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform. He was released on 29 April 1832. During his imprisonment, he continued developing his mathematical ideas.\n\n Final days \nthumb|right|Siméon Poisson reviewed Galois' paper on equation theory and declared it \"incomprehensible\".\nGalois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. Siméon Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\" While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832, after which he was somehow talked into a duel.\n\nGalois' fatal duel took place on 30 May. The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it. What is known is that five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.\n\nSome archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was Stéphanie-Félicie Poterin du Motel, the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. The letters hint that du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fiancé, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\"\n\nMuch more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by Eric Temple Bell in Men of Mathematics), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.\n\nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest. However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he might have been du Motel's \"supposed fiancé\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.\n\nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, \"This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.\" However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.\n\nthumb|left|The Galois memorial in the cemetery of Bourg-la-Reine. Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave and the exact location is still unknown.\nEarly in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen, abandoned by his opponents and seconds, and was found by a passing farmer. He died the following morning at ten o'clock in the Hôpital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots. There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death, and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois' death. He was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:\n\nOn 2 June, Évariste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown. In the cemetery of his native town – Bourg-la-Reine – a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives.\n\nIn 1843 Liouville reviewed his manuscript and declared it sound. It was finally published in the October–November 1846 issue of the Journal de Mathématiques Pures et Appliquées. In 1897 the French Mathematical Society reprinted the 1846 publication. The most famous contribution of this manuscript was a novel proof that there is no quintic formula – that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals. Although Abel had already proved the impossibility of a \"quintic formula\" by radicals in 1824 and Ruffini had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois' methods led to deeper research in what is now called Galois theory. For example, one can use it to determine, for any polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.\n\n Contributions to mathematics \nthumb|right|The final page of Galois' mathematical testament, in his own hand. The phrase \"to decipher all this mess\" (\"déchiffrer tout ce gâchis\") is on the second to the last line.\n\nFrom the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated May 29, 1832, two days before Galois' death:\n\nWithin the 60 or so pages of Galois' collected works are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics.See also: Sophus Lie, \"Influence de Galois sur le développement des mathématiques\" in: Évariste Galois, Oeuvres Mathématiques publiées en 1846 dans le Journal de Liouville (Sceaux, France: Éditions Jacques Gabay, 1989), appendix pages 1–9. His work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel, another mathematician who died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap.\n\n Algebra \nWhile many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, it was Galois who was the first to use the word group (in French groupe) in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a proper decomposition if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.\n\nIn his last letter to Chevalier and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:\nHe constructed the general linear group over a prime field, GL(ν, p) and computed its order, in studying the Galois group of the general equation of degree pν.Letter, p. 410\nHe constructed the projective special linear group PSL(2,p). Galois constructed them as fractional linear transforms, and observed that they were simple except if p was 2 or 3.Letter, p. 411 These were the second family of finite simple groups, after the alternating groups.\nHe noted the exceptional fact that PSL(2,p) is simple and acts on p points if and only if p is 5, 7, or 11.Letter, pp. 411–412Galois' last letter, translated\n\n Galois theory \n\nGalois' most significant contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, or its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.\n\n Analysis \nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions.\n\nAs written in his last letter, Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.\n\n Continued fractions \nIn his first paper in 1828, Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd ζ is purely periodic if and only if ζ is a reduced surd, that is,  and its conjugate \nsatisfies .\n\nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if ζ is a reduced quadratic surd and η is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for ζ and for (−1/η) are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have\n\nwhere ζ is any reduced quadratic surd, and η is its conjugate.\n\nFrom these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If r > 1 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then\n\nIn particular, if n is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of √n contains a repeating block of length m, in which the first m − 1 partial denominators form a palindromic string.\n\n See also \n Group theory\n List of things named after Évariste Galois\n Niels Henrik Abel\n\n Notes \n\n References \n – Reprinting of second revised edition of 1944, The University of Notre Dame Press.\n\n.

The family returned to Britain in May 1935 when his father, Frederick C. Green, took up the Drapers Professorship of French at the University of Cambridge.\n\nEducation\nGreen was educated at the Perse School, Cambridge. He won a scholarship to the University of St Andrews and matriculated aged 16 in 1942. He took an ordinary BSc in 1944, and then, after scientific service in the war, was awarded a BSc Honours in 1947. He gained his PhD at St John's College, Cambridge in 1951, under the supervision of Philip Hall and David Rees.J. A. Green (1951) Abstract Algebra and Semigroups, PhD thesis, University of Cambridge\n\nCareer\n\nWorld War II\nIn the summer of 1944, he was conscripted for national scientific service at the age of eighteen, and was he was assigned to work at Bletchley Park, where he acted as a human \"computer\" carrying out calculations in Hut F, the \"Newmanry\", a department led by Max Newman which used special-purpose Colossus computers to assist in breaking German naval codes.O'Connor, John J.; Robertson, Edmund F., \"James Alexander Green\", MacTutor History of Mathematics archive, University of St Andrews\n\nAcademic work\nHis first lecturing post (1950) was at the University of Manchester, where Newman was his Head of Department. In 1964 he became a Reader at the University of Sussex, and then in 1965 was appointed as a Professor at the newly formed Mathematics Institute at Warwick University, where he led the algebra group. He spent several periods as a visiting academic in the United States, beginning with a year at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey in 1960–61, as well as similar visits to universities in France, Germany and Portugal.  After retiring from Warwick he became a member of the faculty and Professor Emeritus at the Mathematics Institute of the University of Oxford, in whose meetings he participated actively. His final publication was produced at the age of eighty.\n\nWork in mathematics\nGreen found all the characters of general linear groups over finite fields (Green 1955) and invented the Green correspondence in modular representation theory. Both Green functions in the representation theory of groups of Lie type and Green's relations in the area of semigroups are named after him. His final publication (2007) was a revised and augmented edition of his 1980 work, Polynomial Representations of GL(n).\n\nPersonal life\nGreen met his wife, Margaret Lord, at Bletchley Park, where she worked as a Colossus operator, also in the Newmanry section (Hut F). The couple married in August 1950, and have two daughters and a son.  Up to his death, he lived in Oxford.\n\nHonours\nHe was elected to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1968 and the Royal Society in 1987 and was awarded two London Mathematical Society prizes: the Senior Berwick Prize in 1984 and the de Morgan Medal in 2001.\n\nBibliography\n (1955)  The characters of the finite general linear group, Trans.

He is a permanent member of IHÉS in France and a Professor of Mathematics at New York University.\n\nGromov has won several prizes, including the Abel Prize in 2009 \"for his revolutionary contributions to geometry\".\n\nBiography\nMikhail Gromov was born on 23 December 1943 in Boksitogorsk, Soviet Union. His father Leonid Gromov and his Jewish mother Lea Rabinovitz were pathologists.Gromov, Mikhail. \"A Few Recollections\", in  (also available on Gromov's homepage: link) His mother was the cousin of chess-player Mikhail Botvinnik, as well as of the mathematician Isaak Moiseevich Rabinovich. Воспоминания Владимира Рабиновича (генеалогия семьи М. Громова по материнской линии. Лия Александровна Рабинович также приходится двоюродной сестрой известному рижскому математику, историку математики и популяризатору науки Исааку Моисеевичу Рабиновичу (род. 1911), автору книг «Математик Пирс Боль из Риги» (совместно с А. Д. Мышкисом и с приложением комментария М. М. Ботвинника «О шахматной игре П. Г. Боля», 1965), «Строптивая производная» (1968) и др. Троюродный брат М. Громова — известный латвийский адвокат и общественный деятель Александр Жанович Бергман (польск., род. 1925). Gromov was born during World War II, and his mother, who worked as a medical doctor in the Soviet Army, had to leave the front line in order to give birth to him.Newsletter of the European Mathematical Society, No. 73, September 2009, p. 19 When Gromov was nine years old, his mother gave him the book The Enjoyment of Mathematics by Hans Rademacher and Otto Toeplitz, a book that piqued his curiosity and had a great influence on him.\n\nGromov studied mathematics at Leningrad State University where he obtained a master's degree in 1965, a Doctorate in 1969 and defended his Postdoctoral Thesis in 1973. His thesis advisor was Vladimir Rokhlin.http://cims.nyu.edu/newsletters/Spring2009.pdf\n\nGromov married in 1967. In 1970, invited to give a presentation at the International Congress of Mathematicians in France, he was not allowed to leave the USSR. Still, his lecture was published in the conference proceedings.\n\nDisagreeing with the Soviet system, he had been thinking of emigrating since the age of 14. In the early 1970s he ceased publication, hoping that this would help his application to move to Israel. He changed his last name to that of his mother. When the request was granted in 1974, he moved directly to New York where a position had been arranged for him at Stony Brook.\n\nIn 1981 he left Stony Brook to join the faculty of University of Paris VI and in 1982 he became a permanent professor at the Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES) where he remains today. At the same time, he has held professorships at the University of Maryland, College Park from 1991 to 1996, and at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences since 1996. He adopted French citizenship in 1992.\n\nWork\nGromov's style of geometry often features a \"coarse\" or \"soft\" viewpoint, analyzing asymptotic or large-scale properties.\n\nMotivated by Nash and Kuiper's C1 embedding theorem and Stephen Smale's early results, Gromov introduced in 1973 the notion of convex integration and the h-principle, a very general way to solve underdetermined partial differential equations and the basis for a geometric theory of these equations.\n\nIn the 1980s, Gromov introduced the Gromov–Hausdorff metric, a measure of the difference between two compact metric spaces. In this context he proved Gromov's compactness theorem, stating that the set of compact Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature ≥ c and diameter ≤ D is relatively compact in the Gromov–Hausdorff metric. The possible limit points of sequences of such manifolds are Alexandrov spaces of curvature ≥ c, a class of metric spaces studied in detail by Burago, Gromov and Perelman in 1992.  Gromov was also the first to study the space of all possible Riemannian structures on a given manifold.\n\nGromov is known as well for the Gromov-Lees Theorem, named for him and Jack Alexander Lees, concerning Lagrangian immersions and a one-to-one correspondence between the connected components of spaces. https://books.google.com/books?id=Mz_1CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA215&dq=Gromov-Lees+theorem&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji2oGBq_bhAhVPXK0KHRBJDmsQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Gromov-Lees%20theorem&f=false\n\nGromov introduced geometric group theory, the study of infinite groups via the geometry of their Cayley graphs and their word metric. In 1981 he proved Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth: a finitely generated group has polynomial growth (a geometric property) if and only if it is virtually nilpotent (an algebraic property). The proof uses the Gromov–Hausdorff metric mentioned above. Along with Eliyahu Rips he introduced the notion of hyperbolic groups.\n\nGromov founded the field of symplectic topology by introducing the theory of pseudoholomorphic curves. This led to Gromov–Witten invariants which are used in string theory and to his non-squeezing theorem.\n\nGromov is also interested in mathematical biology,. the structure of the brain and the thinking process, and the way scientific ideas evolve.\n\nPrizes and honors\n\nPrizes\nPrize of the Mathematical Society of Moscow (1971)\nOswald Veblen Prize in Geometry (AMS) (1981)\nPrix Elie Cartan de l'Academie des Sciences de Paris (1984)\nPrix de l'Union des Assurances de Paris (1989)\nWolf Prize in Mathematics (1993)\nLeroy P.

His Endliche Gruppen (finite groups) is an influential textbook in group theory, and he has over 50 doctoral descendants.\n\nLife\n\nEducation\nBertram Huppert went to school in Bonn from 1934 until 1945. In 1950, he wrote his diploma thesis in mathematics at the University of Mainz.  The thesis discussed \"nicht fortsetzbare Potenzreihen\" (discontinuous power series), and was written under the direction of Helmut Wielandt.\n\nWhen Wielandt moved to the University of Tübingen in April 1951, Huppert followed him later in the year, and gained his doctorate (as Wielandt's first doctoral student) with the work \"Produkte von paarweise vertauschbaren zyklischen Gruppen\" (products of pairwise permutable cyclic groups), in which he showed, among other things, that such groups were supersoluble. This was the first of more than forty further scientific works, not including his books and monographs. The focus of the dissertation was very close to Wielandt's interests at the time, whose 1951 work shows that the product of pairwise permutable nilpotent groups is solvable.\n\nAcademic career\nHuppert spent the years 1963/64 as a visiting professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. In January 1965, he became a professor of pure mathematics at the University of Mainz, where he later became a professor emeritus in 1994. He put a lot of effort into building up the Mainz group theory and abstract algebra research groups.\n\nFollowing an assignment, he wrote a monumental standard text in the theory of finite groups, Endliche Gruppen I. The group around Wolfgang Gaschütz in Kiel provided important contributions in discussions to that volume. Volumes II and III appeared 14 years later in English with co-author Norman Blackburn.\n\nIn 1984, Huppert founded, together with Gerhard Michler, the first Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft priority programme in Mathematics at the German universities of Aachen, Bielefeld, Essen and Mainz.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1985, Huppert was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Algebra. Together with Wolfgang Gaschütz and Karl W. Gruenberg, he organised Oberwolfach workshops on group theory over many years, and with Michler the Oberwolfach workshop on representation theory.\n\nHe was a founding member of the Institute of Experimental Mathematics of the University of Essen and is a member of the Akademie gemeinnütziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt.\n\nSelected bibliography\n Endliche Gruppen (Springer, 1967) \n Finite Groups II, III (with N.

In his schooling at the Bolton Grammar School, he studied classics, but no mathematics was taught in the school. He was recognised as the best scholar at the school, and the local vicar guaranteed him a scholarship at Cambridge, but his father would not allow him to go. Instead, he left school at age 14 to work in his father's office.\n\nNine years later, defying his father, he went to Trinity College Dublin, working as a private tutor to support himself during his studies. There, among other subjects, he first began learning mathematics. He earned a B.A. in 1833 and returned to England in 1835.\n\nOrdination and ministry\nOn his return to England, Kirkman was ordained into the ministry of the Church of England and became the curate in Bury and then in Lymm. In 1839 he was invited to become rector of Croft with Southworth, a newly founded parish in Lancashire, where he would stay for 52 years until his retirement in 1892. Theologically, Kirkman supported the anti-literalist position of John William Colenso, and was also strongly opposed to materialism. He published many tracts and pamphlets on theology, as well as a book Philosophy Without Assumptions (1876).\n\nKirkman married Eliza Wright in 1841; they had seven children. To support them, Kirkman supplemented his income with tutoring, until Eliza inherited enough property to secure their living. The rectorship itself did not demand much from Kirkman, so from this point forward he had time to devote to mathematics.\n\nKirkman died 4 February 1895 in Bowdon. His wife died ten days later.\n\nMathematics\nKirkman's first mathematical publication was in the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal in 1846, on a problem involving Steiner triple systems that had been published two years earlier in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary by Wesley S. B. Woolhouse. Despite Kirkman's and Woolhouse's contributions to the problem, Steiner triple systems were named after Jakob Steiner who wrote a later paper in 1853. Kirkman's second research paper, in 1848, concerned pluquaternions.\n\nIn 1848, Kirkman published First Mnemonical Lessons, a book on mathematical mnemonics for schoolchildren. It was not successful, and Augustus de Morgan criticised it as \"the most curious crochet I ever saw\".\n\nKirkman's schoolgirl problem\nNext, in 1849, Kirkman studied the Pascal lines determined by the intersection points of opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed within a conic section. Any six points on a conic may be joined into a hexagon in 60 different ways, forming 60 different Pascal lines. Extending previous work of Steiner, Kirkman showed that these lines intersect in triples to form 60 points (now known as the Kirkman points), so that each line contains three of the points and each point lies on three of the lines. That is, these lines and points form a projective configuration of type 603603.\n\nIn 1850, Kirkman observed that his 1846 solution to Woolhouse's problem had an additional property, which he set out as a puzzle in The Lady's and Gentleman's Diary:\n\nThis problem became known as Kirkman's schoolgirl problem, subsequently to become Kirkman's most famous result. He published several additional works on combinatorial design theory in later years.\n\nPluquaternions\nIn 1848 Kirkman wrote \"On Pluquaternions and Homoid Products of n Squares\".London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine 1848, p 447  Google books link \nGeneralizing the quaternions and octonions, Kirkman called a pluquaternion Qa a representative of a system with a imaginary units, a > 3.\nKirkman's paper was dedicated to confirming Cayley's assertions concerning two equations among triple-products of units as sufficient to determine the system in case a = 3 but not a = 4.A. J. Crilly (2006) Arthur Cayley: Mathematician Laureate of the Victorian Era, Johns Hopkins University Press, p. 143 on Kirkman's collaboration with Cayley By 1900 these number systems were called hypercomplex numbers, and later treated as part of the theory of associative algebras.\n\nPolyhedral combinatorics\nBeginning in 1853, Kirkman began working on combinatorial enumeration problems concerning polyhedra, beginning with a proof of Euler's formula and concentrating on simple polyhedra (the polyhedra in which each vertex has three incident edges). He also studied Hamiltonian cycles in polyhedra, and provided an example of a polyhedron with no Hamiltonian cycle, prior to the work of William Rowan Hamilton on the Icosian game. He enumerated cubic Halin graphs, over a century before the work of Halin on these graphs.. He showed that every polyhedron can be generated from a pyramid by face-splitting and vertex-splitting operations, and he studied self-dual polyhedra.\n\nLate work\nKirkman was inspired to work in group theory by a prize offered beginning in 1858 (but in the end never awarded) by the French Academy of Sciences. His contributions in this area include an enumeration of the transitive group actions on sets of up to ten elements. However, as with much of his work on polyhedra, Kirkman's work in this area was weighed down by newly invented terminology and, perhaps because of this, did not significantly influence later researchers.\n\nIn the early 1860s, Kirkman fell out with the mathematical establishment and in particular with Arthur Cayley and James Joseph Sylvester, over the poor reception of his works on polyhedra and groups and over issues of priority. Much of his later mathematical work was published (often in doggerel) in the problem section of the Educational Times and in the obscure Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool. However, in 1884 he began serious work on knot theory, and with Peter Guthrie Tait published an enumeration of the knots with up to ten crossings. He remained active in mathematics even after retirement, until his death in 1895.\n\nAwards and honours\nIn 1857, Kirkman was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society for his research on pluquaternions and partitions. He was also an honorary member of the\nLiterary and Philosophical Society of Manchester and the Literary and Philosophical Society of Liverpool, and a foreign member of the Dutch Society of Science.\n\nSince 1994, the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications has handed out an annual Kirkman medal, named after Kirkman, to recognise outstanding combinatorial research by a mathematician within four years of receiving a doctorate.\n\nNotes\n\nCategory:1806 births\nCategory:1895 deaths\nCategory:People from Bolton\nCategory:19th-century English mathematicians\nCategory:Combinatorialists\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Topologists\nCategory:Geometers\nCategory:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin\nCategory:Fellows of the Royal Society\nCategory:19th-century English Anglican priests"

      "text": "Christian Felix Klein (; 25 April 1849 – 22 June 1925) was a German mathematician and mathematics educator, known for his work with group theory, complex analysis, non-Euclidean geometry, and on the associations between geometry and group theory. His 1872 Erlangen Program, classifying geometries by their basic symmetry groups, was an influential synthesis of much of the mathematics of the time.\n\nLife\nthumb|upright|Klein during his Leipzig period.\nFelix Klein was born on 25 April 1849 in Düsseldorf, to Prussian parents; his father, Caspar Klein (1809–1889), was a Prussian government official's secretary stationed in the Rhine Province. Klein's mother was Sophie Elise Klein (1819–1890, née Kayser). He attended the Gymnasium in Düsseldorf, then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Bonn, 1865–1866, intending to become a physicist. At that time, Julius Plücker had Bonn's professorship of mathematics and experimental physics, but by the time Klein became his assistant, during 1866, Plücker's interest was geometry. Klein received his doctorate, supervised by Plücker, from the University of Bonn during 1868.\n\nPlücker died during 1868, leaving his book concerning the basis of line geometry incomplete. Klein was the obvious person to complete the second part of Plücker's Neue Geometrie des Raumes, and thus became acquainted with Alfred Clebsch, who had relocated to Göttingen during 1868. Klein visited Clebsch the next year, along with visits to Berlin and Paris. During July 1870, at the beginning of the Franco-Prussian War, he was in Paris and had to leave the country. For a brief time he served as a medical orderly in the Prussian army before being appointed lecturer at Göttingen during early 1871.\n\nErlangen appointed Klein professor during 1872, when he was only 23 years old. For this, he was endorsed by Clebsch, who regarded him as likely to become the best mathematician of his time. Klein did not desire a school at Erlangen where there were few students, and so he was pleased to be offered a professorship at Munich's Technische Hochschule during 1875. There he and Alexander von Brill taught advanced courses to many excellent students, including,  Adolf Hurwitz, Walther von Dyck, Karl Rohn, Carl Runge, Max Planck, Luigi Bianchi, and Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro.\n\nDuring 1875 Klein married Anne Hegel, the granddaughter of the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.Chislenko, Eugene; Tschinkel, Yuri. \"The Felix Klein Protocols\", Notices of the American Mathematical Society, August 2007, Volume 54, Number 8, pp. 960–970.\n\nAfter five years at the Technische Hochschule, Klein was appointed to a chair of geometry at Leipzig. There his colleagues included Walther von Dyck, Rohn, Eduard Study and Friedrich Engel. Klein's years at Leipzig, 1880 to 1886, fundamentally changed his life. During 1882, his health collapsed; during 1883–1884, he was plagued by depression. Nonetheless his research continued; his seminal work on hyperelliptic sigma functions dates from around this period, being published during 1886 and 1888.\n\nKlein accepted a professorship at the University of Göttingen during 1886. From then until his 1913 retirement, he sought to re-establish Göttingen as the world's main mathematics research center. Yet he never managed to transfer from Leipzig to Göttingen his own primacy as a developer of geometry. At Göttingen, he taught a variety of courses, mainly concerning the interface between mathematics and physics, such as mechanics and potential theory.\n\nThe research facility Klein established at Göttingen served as a model for the best such facilities throughout the world. He introduced weekly discussion meetings, and created a mathematical reading room and library. During 1895, Klein hired David Hilbert away from the University of Königsberg; this appointment proved fateful, because Hilbert continued Göttingen's good reputation until his own retirement during 1932.\n\nWith Klein's editorship, Mathematische Annalen became one of the best mathematics journals in the world. Founded by Clebsch, only with Klein's management did it first rival then surpass Crelle's Journal based in the University of Berlin. Klein established a small team of editors who met regularly, making democratic decisions. The journal specialized in complex analysis, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory (at least until Hilbert ended the subject). It also provided an important outlet for real analysis and the new group theory.\n\nDuring 1893 in Chicago, Klein was a major speaker at the International Mathematical Congress held as part of the World's Columbian Exposition. Due partly to Klein's efforts, Göttingen began admitting women during 1893. He supervised the first Ph.D. thesis in mathematics written at Göttingen by a woman; she was Grace Chisholm Young, an English student of Arthur Cayley's, whom Klein admired. During 1897 Klein became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAbout 1900, Klein began to become interested in mathematical instruction in schools. During 1905, he was decisive in formulating a plan recommending that analytic geometry, the rudiments of differential and integral calculus, and the function concept be taught in secondary schools. This recommendation was gradually implemented in many countries around the world. During 1908, Klein was elected president of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction at the Rome International Congress of Mathematicians. With his guidance, the German part of the Commission published many volumes on the teaching of mathematics at all levels in Germany.\n\nThe London Mathematical Society awarded Klein its De Morgan Medal during 1893. He was elected a member of the Royal Society during 1885, and was awarded its Copley Medal during 1912. He retired the next year due to ill health, but continued to teach mathematics at his home for some years more.\n\nKlein was one of the 93 signatories of the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three, a document penned in support of the German invasion of Belgium in the early stages of World War I.\n\nKlein had the title of Geheimrat (trusted-advisor).\n\nHe died in Göttingen during 1925.\n\nWork\nKlein's dissertation, on line geometry and its applications to mechanics, classified second degree line complexes using Weierstrass's theory of elementary divisors.\n\nKlein's first important mathematical discoveries were made during 1870. In collaboration with Sophus Lie, he discovered the fundamental properties of the asymptotic lines on the Kummer surface. They later investigated W-curves, curves invariant under a group of projective transformations. It was Lie who introduced Klein to the concept of group, which was to have a major role in his later work. Klein also learned about groups from Camille Jordan.\nthumb|150px|right|A hand-blown Klein Bottle\nKlein devised the \"Klein bottle\" named after him, a one-sided closed surface which cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space, but it may be immersed as a cylinder looped back through itself to join with its other end from the \"inside\". It may be embedded in the Euclidean space of dimensions 4 and higher. The concept of a Klein Bottle was devised as a 3-Dimensional Möbius strip, with one method of construction being the attachment of the edges of two Möbius strips.\n\nDuring the 1890s, Klein began studying mathematical physics more intensively, writing on the gyroscope with Arnold Sommerfeld.:de:Werner Burau and :de:Bruno Schoeneberg \"Klein, Christian Felix.\" Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography. 2008. Retrieved on 04 December 2014 from Encyclopedia.com: http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2830902326.html During 1894, he initiated the idea of an encyclopedia of mathematics including its applications, which became the Enzyklopädie der mathematischen Wissenschaften. This enterprise, which endured until 1935, provided an important standard reference of enduring value.Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2009) Routes of Learning: Highways, Pathways, Byways in the History of Mathematics, pp 44, 45, 90,  Johns Hopkins University Press, \n\nErlangen program\n\nDuring 1871, while at Göttingen, Klein made major discoveries in geometry. He published two papers On the So-called Non-Euclidean Geometry showing that Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries could be considered metric spaces determined by a Cayley-Klein metric. This insight had the corollary that non-Euclidean geometry was consistent if and only if Euclidean geometry was, giving the same status to geometries Euclidean and non-Euclidean, and ending all controversy about non-Euclidean geometry. Arthur Cayley never accepted Klein's argument, believing it to be circular.\n\nKlein's synthesis of geometry as the study of the properties of a space that is invariant under a given group of transformations, known as the Erlangen Program (1872), profoundly influenced the evolution of mathematics. This program was initiated by Klein's inaugural lecture as professor at Erlangen, although it was not the actual speech he gave on the occasion. The program proposed a unified system of geometry that has become the accepted modern method. Klein showed how the essential properties of a given geometry could be represented by the group of transformations that preserve those properties. Thus the program's definition of geometry encompassed both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.\n\nPresently the significance of Klein's contributions to geometry is more than evident, but not because those contributions are now considered strange or wrong. On the contrary, those contributions have become so much a part of our present mathematical thinking that it is difficult for us to appreciate their novelty, and the way in which they were not immediately accepted by all his contemporaries.\n\nComplex analysis\nKlein saw his work on complex analysis as his major contribution to mathematics, specifically his work on:\nThe link between certain ideas of Riemann's and invariant theory,\nNumber theory and abstract algebra;\nGroup theory;\nGeometry with more than 3 dimensions and differential equations, especially equations he invented, namely elliptic modular functions and automorphic functions.\n\nKlein showed that the modular group moves the fundamental region of the complex plane so as to tessellate that plane. During 1879, he examined the action of PSL(2,7), considered as an image of the modular group, and obtained an explicit representation of a Riemann surface now termed the Klein quartic. He showed that that surface was a curve in projective space, that its equation was x3y + y3z + z3x = 0, and that its group of symmetries was PSL(2,7) of order 168. His Ueber Riemann's Theorie der algebraischen Funktionen und ihre Integrale (1882) treats complex analysis in a geometric way, connecting potential theory and conformal mappings. This work drew on notions from fluid dynamics.\n\nKlein considered equations of degree > 4, and was especially interested in using transcendental methods to solve the general equation of the fifth degree. Building on the methods of Charles Hermite and Leopold Kronecker, he produced similar results to those of Brioschi and later completely solved the problem by means of the icosahedral group. This work enabled him to write a series of papers on elliptic modular functions.\n\nIn his 1884 book on the icosahedron, Klein established a theory of automorphic functions, associating algebra and geometry. However Poincaré published an outline of his theory of automorphic functions during 1881, which resulted in a friendly rivalry between the two men. Both sought to state and prove a grand uniformization theorem that would establish the new theory more completely. Klein succeeded in formulating such a theorem and in describing a strategy for proving it. But while doing this work his health decreased, as mentioned above.\n\nKlein summarized his work on automorphic and elliptic modular functions in a four volume treatise, written with Robert Fricke during a period of about 20 years.\n\nSelected works\n 1882: Ueber Riemann's Theorie der Algebraischen Functionen und ihre Integrale \n , also available from Cornell\n 1884:Vorlesungen über das Ikosaeder und die Auflösung der Gleichungen vom 5ten Grade\n English translation by G.

The technical books he had to study were in English, which at first he found challenging.  Nobody at his school had attempted honours Leaving Cert maths before.  However, he got one of the highest marks in the country in the 1961 Leaving Certificate mathematics examination, thereby earning a state scholarship to university.\n\nHe attended University College Galway, earning bachelors (1964) and masters (1965) degrees in mathematical science and also winning a National University of Ireland Traveling Studentship Prize.  In 1968 he was awarded the D.Phil by the University of Sussex for a thesis on ”Structure Theorems for Linear Groups\" done under advisor Walter Ledermann.\n\nHe immediately joined the staff at University College Dublin, from which he officially retired in 2009, but he has continued to publish regularly.  His research has focussed on group theory, and later linear algebra too, and he has supervised five Ph.D students. He has also played a significant role in the establishment of the Irish Mathematical Olympiad, and had frequently served the BT Young Scientists Exhibition as a judge and reviewer.\n\nEarly in his career, he developed a strong interest in matrix theory, due to the influence of Olga Taussky-Todd, with whom he often corresponded.  This was cemented by a 1972–3 sabbatical spent at Northern Illinois University.\n\nHe received the Hans Schneider Prize in 2013 in recognition of his constructive solution to the NIEP (Non-negative inverse eigenvalue problem) for non-zero spectra.Laffey T.J.

He also worked in geometry, topology, set theory, and analysis.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nLevi was born to Georg Levi and Emma Blum in Mulhouse in Alsace-Lorraine, then part of the German Empire. He received his Ph.D. in 1911 under Heinrich Martin Weber at the University of Strasbourg.\n\nCareer\nLevi served his mandatory military service in the German Army in 1906–1907, and was called up again serving in the artillery during World War I, 1914–18. Awarded the Iron Cross, he was discharged as a lieutenant. In 1917, he married Barbara Fitting, with whom he eventually had three children (Paul Levi, Charlotte, and Suzanne). He taught at the University of Leipzig from 1920 to 1935, when the Nazi government dismissed him because of his Jewish ancestry. Friedrich and Barbara moved to Calcutta, India.\n\nIn 1935 he accepted an offer as head of the Mathematics Department at the University of Calcutta. He introduced the Levi graph in 1940 at a series of lectures on finite geometry.. He contributed to the understanding of combinatorics on words when he articulated the Levi lemma in an article for the Calcutta Mathematical Society.. In 1948, Levi became professor of mathematics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, India. According to Raghavan Narasimhan, Levi had an important influence on the development of 20th century mathematics in India, especially by introducing modern algebra at the University of Calcutta.Raghavan Narasimhan The coming of age of mathematics in India, pp. 235–258 in Michael Atiyah et al..

      "text": "Marius Sophus Lie ( ; ; 17 December 1842 – 18 February 1899) was a Norwegian mathematician.  He largely created the theory of continuous symmetry and applied it to the study of geometry and differential equations.\n\n Biography \nHis first mathematical work, Repräsentation der Imaginären der Plangeometrie, was published in 1869 by the Academy of Sciences in Christiania and also by Crelle's Journal. That same year he received a scholarship and traveled to Berlin, where he stayed from September to February 1870. There, he met Felix Klein and they became close friends. When he left Berlin, Lie traveled to Paris, where he was joined by Klein two months later. There, they met Camille Jordan and Gaston Darboux. But on 19 July 1870 the Franco-Prussian War began and Klein (who was Prussian) had to leave France very quickly. Lie left for Fontainebleau where after a while he was arrested under suspicion of being a German spy, an event that made him famous in Norway. He was released from prison after a month, thanks to the intervention of Darboux.\n\nLie obtained his PhD at the University of Christiania (present day Oslo) in 1871 with a thesis entitled Over en Classe geometriske Transformationer (On a Class of Geometric Transformations). \n\nIt would be described by Darboux as “one of the most handsome discoveries of modern Geometry”. The next year, the Norwegian Parliament established an extraordinary professorship for him. That same year, Lie visited Klein, who was then at Erlangen and working on the Erlangen program.\n\nAt the end of 1872, Sophus Lie proposed to Anna Birch, then eighteen years old, and they were married in 1874. The couple had three children: Marie (b. 1877), Dagny (b. 1880) and Herman (b. 1884).\n\nIn 1884, Friedrich Engel arrived at Christiania to help him, with the support of Klein and Adolph Mayer (who were both professors at Leipzig, by then). Engel would help Lie to write his most important treatise, Theorie der Transformationsgruppen, published in Leipzig in three volumes from 1888 to 1893. Decades later, Engel would also be one of the two editors of Lie's collected works.\n\nIn 1886 Lie became professor at Leipzig, replacing Klein, who had moved to Göttingen. In November 1889, Lie suffered a mental breakdown and had to be hospitalized until June 1890. After that, he returned to his post, but over the years his anaemia progressed to the point where he decided to return to his homeland. Consequently,  in 1898 he tendered his resignation in May, and left for home (for good) in September the same year. He died the following year, 1899.\n\nHe was made Honorary Member of the London Mathematical Society in 1878, Member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1892, Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1895 and foreign associate of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1895.\n\nSophus Lie died at the age of 56, due to pernicious anemia, a disease caused by impaired absorption of vitamin B12.\n\n Legacy \n\nLie's principal tool, and one of his greatest achievements, was the discovery that continuous transformation groups (now called, after him, Lie groups) could be better understood by \"linearizing\" them, and studying the corresponding generating vector fields (the so-called infinitesimal generators). The generators are subject to a linearized version of the group law, now called the commutator bracket, and have the structure of what is today called a Lie algebra.\n\nHermann Weyl  used Lie's work on group theory in his papers from 1922 and 1923, and Lie groups today play a role in quantum mechanics.\nHowever, the subject of Lie groups as it is studied today is vastly different from what the research by Sophus Lie was about and “among the 19th century masters, Lie's work is in detail certainly the least known today”.\n\n Books \n\n.

Higman;. his notable doctoral students there included Kenneth Appel and Joseph Kruskal.\n\nLyndon died on June 8, 1988, in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nResearch\nLyndon's Ph.D. thesis concerned group cohomology; the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence, coming out of that work, relates a group's cohomology to the cohomologies of its normal subgroups and their quotient groups.\n\nA Lyndon word is a nonempty string of symbols that is smaller, lexicographically, than any of its cyclic rotations; Lyndon introduced these words in 1954 while studying the bases of free groups..\n\nLyndon was credited by Gustav A. Hedlund for his role in the discovery of the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a mathematical characterization of cellular automata in terms of continuous equivariant functions on shift spaces..\n\nThe Craig–Lyndon interpolation theorem in formal logic states that every logical implication can be factored into the composition of two implications, such that each nonlogical symbol in the middle formula of the composition is also used in both of the other two formulas. A version of the theorem was proved by William Craig in 1957, and strengthened by Lyndon in 1959..\n\nIn addition to these results, Lyndon made important contributions to combinatorial group theory, the study of groups in terms of their presentations in terms of  sequences of generating elements that combine to form the group identity.\n\nAwards and honors\nThe book Contributions to Group Theory (American Mathematical Society, 1984, ) is a festschrift dedicated to Lyndon on the occasion of his 65th birthday; it includes five articles about Lyndon and his mathematical research, as well as 27 invited and refereed research articles.\n\nThe Roger Lyndon Collegiate Professorship of Mathematics at the University of Michigan, held by Hyman Bass in 1999-2008,Hyman Bass curriculum vitae , retrieved 2018-11-12. is named after Lyndon.\n\nBooks\nLyndon was the author or coauthor of the books:\nNotes on Logic (Van Nostrand, 1967)\nWord Problems: Decision Problem in Group Theory (with W.

Mann proved the Schnirelmann-Landau conjecture in number theory, and as a result earned the 1946 Cole Prize. He and his student developed the (\"Mann-Whitney\") U-statistic of nonparametric statistics. (The web-link is to a slightly updated edition of the biography.) Mann published the first mathematical book on the design of experiments .\n\nEarly life of a number theorist\nBorn in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, to a Jewish family, Mann earned his Ph.D. degree in mathematics in 1935 from the University of Vienna under the supervision of Philipp Furtwängler. Mann immigrated to the United States in 1938, and lived in New York, supporting himself by tutoring students.\n\nIn additive number theory, Mann proved the Schnirelmann–Landau conjecture on the asymptotic density of sumsets in 1942. By doing so he established Mann's theorem and earned the 1946 Cole Prize.Frank Nelson Cole Prize in Number Theory, American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2011-01-24.\n\nStatistics\nIn 1942 the Carnegie Foundation awarded Mann a fellowship to learn statistics while assisting the operations research group of Harold Hotelling at Columbia University. His group also supported Abraham Wald, and Wald and Mann collaborated on several papers. In statistics, Mann is known for the (\"Mann–Whitney\") U-statistic and its associated hypothesis test for nonparametric statistics. Collaborating with Wald, Mann developed the Mann–Wald theorem of asymptotic statistics and econometrics.\n\nMann wrote the first mathematical book on the design of experiments , whose principles allowed later statisticians to design and to analyze customized experiments. Like contemporary \"self-help\" and \"how to\"  books, the earlier books gave easy-to-follow examples but little theory beyond exhortations to follow three principles of Ronald A. Fisher—to \"replicate\", to \"establish control\" (for example with blocking), and to \"randomize\" (assignment of treatments to units). Earlier books provided useful examples of designed experiments along with the design's analysis of variance, but no basis for constructing new designs for new problems, according to .\n\nAccording to ,\nRonald A. Fisher was \"interested in application and in the popularization\nof statistical methods and his early book Statistical Methods for Research Workers, published in 1925, went through many editions and\nmotivated and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of\nstudy. His Design of Experiments (1935)  [promoted] statistical technique and application. In that book he\nemphasized examples and how to design experiments systematically from\na statistical point of view. The mathematical justification of the methods\ndescribed was not stressed and, indeed, proofs were often barely sketched\nor omitted altogether ..., a fact which led H. B. Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his well known treatise, .\"Page 87: \n\nLater life\nIn 1946 Mann returned to Ohio State University, where he served as a professor mathematics until his retirement in 1964.

      "text": "Horace Yomishi Mochizuki (18 May 1937 – 9 June 1989) was an American mathematician known for his contributions to group theory. Mochizuki received a special award from the National Science Foundation for his work on the Burnside problem.\n\n Biography \nMochizuki was born in California on 18 May 1937 from parents of Japanese ancestry. Following the Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt authorized on 19 February 1942 the deportation and internment of Japanese Americans with Executive Order 9066 which allowed regional military commanders to designate \"military areas\" from which \"any or all persons may be excluded\". This authority was used to declare that all people of Japanese ancestry were excluded from the West Coast, including all of California and parts of Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, except for those in government camps. Mochizuki was interned with his family in the Jerome War Relocation Center in Arkansas. After World War II, the family moved back to Madera, California.\n\nMochizuki received his doctoral degree from the University of Washington with a dissertation work entitled \"Finitistic homological dimensions and duality theory for rings\". He began teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara in 1965.  Mochizuki passed away on 9 June 1989 from a cancer of pancreas.\n\n Work \nAt the beginning of his academic career, Mochizuki's worked on ring theory. He started to cooperate with Seymour Bachmuth on group theory. For his work on Burnside groups, Mochizuki received a special award from the National Science Foundation for \"projects of high scientific merit involving scientists with a record of outstanding research accomplishments...\"\n\nMochizuki is known for a non-commutative version of \"Kolchin's Theorem\" that solved a theorem of Ivan Kaplansky and for his work on automorphism groups with Bachmuth.\n\n References \n\nCategory:Mathematicians from California\nCategory:1937 births\nCategory:1989 deaths\nCategory:People from Madera, California\nCategory:American people of Japanese descent\nCategory:Japanese-American internees\nCategory:American academics of Japanese descent\nCategory:University of Washington alumni\nCategory:University of California, Santa Barbara faculty\nCategory:Group theorists"
