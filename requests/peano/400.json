{"title": "19th century in science", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19th_century_in_science", "text": "The 19th century in science saw the birth of science as a profession; the term scientist was coined in 1833 by William Whewell, which soon replaced the older term of (natural) philosopher.\n\nAmong the most influential ideas of the 19th century were those of Charles Darwin (alongside the independent researches of Alfred Russel Wallace), who in 1859 published the book The Origin of Species, which introduced the idea of evolution by natural selection. Another important landmark in medicine and biology were the successful efforts to prove the germ theory of disease. Following this, Louis Pasteur made the first vaccine against rabies, and also made many discoveries in the field of chemistry, including the asymmetry of crystals. In chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements. In physics, the experiments, theories and discoveries of Michael Faraday, Andre-Marie Ampere, James Clerk Maxwell, and their contemporaries led to the creation of electromagnetism as a new branch of science. Thermodynamics led to an understanding of heat and the notion of energy was defined.\n\nOther highlights include the discoveries unveiling the nature of atomic structure and matter, simultaneously with chemistry \u2013 and of new kinds of radiation. In astronomy, the planet Neptune was discovered. In mathematics, the notion of complex numbers finally matured and led to a subsequent analytical theory; they also began the use of hypercomplex numbers. Karl Weierstrass and others carried out the arithmetization of analysis for functions of real and complex variables. It also saw rise to new progress in geometry beyond those classical theories of Euclid, after a period of nearly two thousand years. The mathematical science of logic likewise had revolutionary breakthroughs after a similarly long period of stagnation. But the most important step in science at this time were the ideas formulated by the creators of electrical science. Their work changed the face of physics and made possible for new technology to come about: Thomas Alva Edison gave the world a practical everyday lightbulb. Nikola Tesla pioneered the induction motor, high frequency transmission of electricity, and remote control. Other new inventions were electrical telegraphy and the telephone.\n\nMathematics\nThroughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777\u20131855) epitomizes this trend. He did revolutionary work on functions of complex variables, in geometry, and on the convergence of series, leaving aside his many contributions to science. He also gave the first satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law. His 1801 volume Disquisitiones Arithmeticae laid the foundations of modern number theory.\n\nright|thumb|400px|Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry\nThis century saw the development of the two forms of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry no longer holds.\nThe Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician J\u00e1nos Bolyai, independently defined and studied hyperbolic geometry, where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180\u00b0. Elliptic geometry was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180\u00b0. Riemann also developed Riemannian geometry, which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry.\n\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of abstract algebra. Hermann Grassmann in Germany gave a first version of vector spaces, William Rowan Hamilton in Ireland developed noncommutative algebra. The British mathematician George Boole devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.\n\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\n\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian, and \u00c9variste Galois, a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three dimensions in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of parameter space and hypercomplex numbers.\n\nIn the later 19th century, Georg Cantor established the first foundations of set theory, which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor's set theory, and the rise of mathematical logic in the hands of Peano, L. E. J. Brouwer, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, and A.N. Whitehead, initiated a long running debate on the foundations of mathematics.\n\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the London Mathematical Society in 1865, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Math\u00e9matique de France in 1872, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1883, the Circolo Matematico di Palermo in 1884, and the American Mathematical Society in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the Quaternion Society, was formed in 1899, in the context of a vector controversy.\n\nPhysics\nthumb|upright|left|Michael Faraday(1791\u20131867)\n\nIn 1800, Alessandro Volta invented the electric battery (known of the voltaic pile) and thus improved the way electric currents could also be studied. A year later, Thomas Young demonstrated the wave nature of light\u2014which received strong experimental support from the work of Augustin-Jean Fresnel\u2014and the principle of interference. In 1813, Peter Ewart supported the idea of the conservation of energy in his paper On the measure of moving force. In 1820, Hans Christian \u00d8rsted found that a current-carrying conductor gives rise to a magnetic force surrounding it, and within a week after \u00d8rsted's discovery reached France, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re discovered that two parallel electric currents will exert forces on each other. In 1821, William Hamilton began his analysis of Hamilton's characteristic function. In 1821, Michael Faraday built an electricity-powered motor, while Georg Ohm stated his law of electrical resistance in 1826, expressing the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in an electric circuit. A year later, botanist Robert Brown discovered Brownian motion: pollen grains in water undergoing movement resulting from their bombardment by the fast-moving atoms or molecules in the liquid. In 1829, Gaspard Coriolis introduced the terms of work (force times distance) and kinetic energy with the meanings they have today.\n\nIn 1831, Faraday (and independently Joseph Henry) discovered the reverse effect, the production of an electric potential or current through magnetism\u00a0\u2013 known as electromagnetic induction; these two discoveries are the basis of the electric motor and the electric generator, respectively. In 1834, Carl Jacobi discovered his uniformly rotating self-gravitating ellipsoids (the Jacobi ellipsoid). In 1834, John Russell observed a nondecaying solitary water wave (soliton) in the Union Canal near Edinburgh and used a water tank to study the dependence of solitary water wave velocities on wave amplitude and water depth. In 1835, William Hamilton stated Hamilton's canonical equations of motion. In the same year, Gaspard Coriolis examined theoretically the mechanical efficiency of waterwheels, and deduced the Coriolis effect. In 1841, Julius Robert von Mayer, an amateur scientist, wrote a paper on the conservation of energy but his lack of academic training led to its rejection. In 1842, Christian Doppler proposed the Doppler effect. In 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz formally stated the law of conservation of energy. In 1851, L\u00e9on Foucault showed the Earth's rotation with a huge pendulum (Foucault pendulum).\n\nThere were important advances in continuum mechanics in the first half of the century, namely formulation of laws of elasticity for solids and discovery of Navier\u2013Stokes equations for fluids.\n\nLaws of thermodynamics\n\nthumb|200px|right|\nIn the 19th century, the connection between heat and mechanical energy was established quantitatively by Julius Robert von Mayer and James Prescott Joule, who measured the mechanical equivalent of heat in the 1840s. In 1849, Joule published results from his series of experiments (including the paddlewheel experiment) which show that heat is a form of energy, a fact that was accepted in the 1850s. The relation between heat and energy was important for the development of steam engines, and in 1824 the experimental and theoretical work of Sadi Carnot was published. Carnot captured some of the ideas of thermodynamics in his discussion of the efficiency of an idealized engine. Sadi Carnot's work provided a basis for the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics\u2014a restatement of the law of conservation of energy\u2014which was stated around 1850 by William Thomson, later known as Lord Kelvin, and Rudolf Clausius. Lord Kelvin, who had extended the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances in 1848, drew upon the engineering theory of Lazare Carnot, Sadi Carnot, and \u00c9mile Clapeyron\u2013as well as the experimentation of James Prescott Joule on the interchangeability of mechanical, chemical, thermal, and electrical forms of work\u2014to formulate the first law.\n\nKelvin and Clausius also stated the second law of thermodynamics, which was originally formulated in terms of the fact that heat does not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter. Other formulations followed quickly (for example, the second law was expounded in Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait's influential work Treatise on Natural Philosophy) and Kelvin in particular understood some of the law's general implications. The second Law was the idea that gases consist of molecules in motion had been discussed in some detail by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, but had fallen out of favor, and was revived by Clausius in 1857. In 1850, Hippolyte Fizeau and L\u00e9on Foucault measured the speed of light in water and find that it is slower than in air, in support of the wave model of light. In 1852, Joule and Thomson demonstrated that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the Joule\u2013Thomson effect or Joule\u2013Kelvin effect. Hermann von Helmholtz puts forward the idea of the heat death of the universe in 1854, the same year that Clausius established the importance of dQ/T (Clausius's theorem) (though he did not yet name the quantity).\n\nJames Clerk Maxwell\nthumb|180px|left|James Clerk Maxwell(1831\u20131879)\nIn 1859, James Clerk Maxwell discovered the distribution law of molecular velocities. Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields are propagated outward from their source at a speed equal to that of light and that light is one of several kinds of electromagnetic radiation, differing only in frequency and wavelength from the others. In 1859, Maxwell worked out the mathematics of the distribution of velocities of the molecules of a gas. The wave theory of light was widely accepted by the time of Maxwell's work on the electromagnetic field, and afterward the study of light and that of electricity and magnetism were closely related. In 1864 James Maxwell published his papers on a dynamical theory of the electromagnetic field, and stated that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon in the 1873 publication of Maxwell's Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. This work drew upon theoretical work by German theoreticians such as Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber. The encapsulation of heat in particulate motion, and the addition of electromagnetic forces to Newtonian dynamics established an enormously robust theoretical underpinning to physical observations.\n\nThe prediction that light represented a transmission of energy in wave form through a \"luminiferous ether\", and the seeming confirmation of that prediction with Helmholtz student Heinrich Hertz's 1888 detection of electromagnetic radiation, was a major triumph for physical theory and raised the possibility that even more fundamental theories based on the field could soon be developed. Experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theory was provided by Hertz, who generated and detected electric waves in 1886 and verified their properties, at the same time foreshadowing their application in radio, television, and other devices. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz discovered the photoelectric effect. Research on the electromagnetic waves began soon after, with many scientists and inventors conducting experiments on their properties. In the mid to late 1890s Guglielmo Marconi developed a radio wave based wireless telegraphy system (see invention of radio).\n\nThe atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist John Dalton and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The kinetic theory in turn led to the statistical mechanics of Ludwig Boltzmann (1844\u20131906) and Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839\u20131903), which held that energy (including heat) was a measure of the speed of particles. Interrelating the statistical likelihood of certain states of organization of these particles with the energy of those states, Clausius reinterpreted the dissipation of energy to be the statistical tendency of molecular configurations to pass toward increasingly likely, increasingly disorganized states (coining the term \"entropy\" to describe the disorganization of a state). The statistical versus absolute interpretations of the second law of thermodynamics set up a dispute that would last for several decades (producing arguments such as \"Maxwell's demon\"), and that would not be held to be definitively resolved until the behavior of atoms was firmly established in the early 20th century. In 1902, James Jeans found the length scale required for gravitational perturbations to grow in a static nearly homogeneous medium.\n\nChemistry\n\nIn chemistry, Dmitri Mendeleev, following the atomic theory of John Dalton, created the first periodic table of elements.\n\nEngineering and technology\n\nthumb|Thomas Edison was an American inventor, scientist, and businessman who developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb.\nthumb|First motor bus in history: the Benz Omnibus, built in 1895 for the Netphener bus company\n 1804: First steam locomotive begins operation.\n 1825: Erie Canal opened connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean.\n 1825: First isolation of aluminum.\n 1825: The Stockton and Darlington Railway, the first public railway in the world, is opened.\n 1826: Samuel Morey patents the internal combustion engine.\n 1829: First electric motor built.\n 1837: Telegraphy patented.\n 1841: The word \"dinosaur\" is coined by Richard Owen\n 1844: First publicly funded telegraph line in the world\u2014between Baltimore and Washington\u2014sends demonstration message on 24 May, ushering in the age of the telegraph.

Educated in Poland at the University of Warsaw, and a member of the Lw\u00f3w\u2013Warsaw school of logic and the Warsaw school of mathematics, he immigrated to the United States in 1939 where he became a naturalized citizen in 1945. Tarski taught and carried out research in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1942 until his death in 1983.Feferman A.\n\nA prolific author best known for his work on model theory, metamathematics, and algebraic logic, he also contributed to abstract algebra, topology, geometry, measure theory, mathematical logic, set theory, and analytic philosophy.\n\nHis biographers Anita and Solomon Feferman state that, \"Along with his contemporary, Kurt G\u00f6del, he changed the face of logic in the twentieth century, especially through his work on the concept of truth and the theory of models.\"Feferman & Feferman, p.1\n\nLife\nAlfred Tarski was born Alfred Teitelbaum (Polish spelling: \"Tajtelbaum\"), to parents who were Polish Jews in comfortable circumstances relative to other Jews in the overall region. He first manifested his mathematical abilities while in secondary school, at Warsaw's Szko\u0142a Mazowiecka.Feferman & Feferman, pp.17-18 Nevertheless, he entered the University of Warsaw in 1918 intending to study biology.Feferman & Feferman, p.26\n\nAfter Poland regained independence in 1918, Warsaw University came under the leadership of Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski and Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski and quickly became a world-leading research institution in logic, foundational mathematics, and the philosophy of mathematics. Le\u015bniewski recognized Tarski's potential as a mathematician and encouraged him to abandon biology.  Henceforth Tarski attended courses taught by \u0141ukasiewicz, Sierpi\u0144ski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Tadeusz Kotarbi\u0144ski, and became the only person ever to complete a doctorate under Le\u015bniewski's supervision. Tarski and Le\u015bniewski soon grew cool to each other. However, in later life, Tarski reserved his warmest praise for Kotarbi\u0144ski, which was reciprocated.\n\nIn 1923, Alfred Teitelbaum and his brother Wac\u0142aw changed their surname to \"Tarski\". The Tarski brothers also converted to Roman Catholicism, Poland's dominant religion. Alfred did so even though he was an avowed atheist.Feferman & Feferman, p.294\"Most of the Socialist Party members were also in favor of assimilation, and Tarski's political allegiance was socialist at the time. So, along with its being a practical move, becoming more Polish than Jewish was an ideological statement and was approved by many, though not all, of his colleagues. As to why Tarski, a professed atheist, converted, that just came with the territory and was part of the package: if you were going to be Polish then you had to say you were Catholic.\" Anita Burdman Feferman, Solomon Feferman, Alfred Tarski: Life and Logic (2004), page 39.\n\nAfter becoming the youngest person ever to complete a doctorate at Warsaw University, Tarski taught logic at the Polish Pedagogical Institute, mathematics and logic at the University, and served as \u0141ukasiewicz's assistant. Because these positions were poorly paid, Tarski also taught mathematics at a Warsaw secondary school; before World War II, it was not uncommon for European intellectuals of research caliber to teach high school. Hence between 1923 and his departure for the United States in 1939, Tarski not only wrote several textbooks and many papers, a number of them ground-breaking, but also did so while supporting himself primarily by teaching high-school mathematics. In 1929 Tarski married fellow teacher Maria Witkowska, a Pole of Catholic background. She had worked as a courier for the army in the Polish\u2013Soviet War. They had two children; a son Jan who became a physicist, and a daughter Ina who married the mathematician Andrzej Ehrenfeucht.Feferman & Feferman (2004), pp. 239\u2013242.\n\nTarski applied for a chair of philosophy at Lw\u00f3w University, but on Bertrand Russell's recommendation it was awarded to Leon Chwistek.Feferman & Feferman, p. 67 In 1930, Tarski visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Karl Menger's colloquium, and met Kurt G\u00f6del. Thanks to a fellowship, he was able to return to Vienna during the first half of 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the Unity of Science movement, an outgrowth of the Vienna Circle. In 1937, Tarski applied for a chair at Pozna\u0144 University but the chair was abolished.Feferman & Feferman, pp. 102-103 Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at Harvard University. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II. Tarski left reluctantly, because Le\u015bniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the Nazi threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not see them again until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.\n\nOnce in the United States, Tarski held a number of temporary teaching and research positions: Harvard University (1939), City College of New York (1940), and thanks to a Guggenheim Fellowship, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (1942), where he again met G\u00f6del. In 1942, Tarski joined the Mathematics Department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his career. Tarski became an American citizen in 1945.Feferman & Feferman, Chap. 5, pp. 124-149 Although emeritus from 1968, he taught until 1973 and supervised Ph.D. candidates until his death. At Berkeley, Tarski acquired a reputation as an awesome and demanding teacher, a fact noted by many observers:\n\nHis seminars at Berkeley quickly became famous in the world of mathematical logic. His students, many of whom became distinguished mathematicians, noted the awesome energy with which he would coax and cajole their best work out of them, always demanding the highest standards of clarity and precision.Obituary in Times, reproduced here\n\nTarski was extroverted, quick-witted, strong-willed, energetic, and sharp-tongued. He preferred his research to be collaborative \u2014 sometimes working all night with a colleague \u2014 and was very fastidious about priority.Gregory Moore, \"Alfred Tarski\" in Dictionary of Scientific Biography\n\nA charismatic leader and teacher, known for his brilliantly precise yet suspenseful expository style, Tarski had intimidatingly high standards for students, but at the same time he could be very encouraging, and particularly so to women \u2014 in contrast to the general trend. Some students were frightened away, but a circle of disciples remained, many of whom became world-renowned leaders in the field.Feferman\nupright|thumb|Interior of the Warsaw University Library, statues of philosophers of the Lvov-Warsaw School: Kazimierz Twardowski, Jan \u0141ukasiewicz, Alfred Tarski and Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski.\nTarski supervised twenty-four Ph.D. dissertations including (in chronological order) those of Andrzej Mostowski, Bjarni J\u00f3nsson, Julia Robinson, Robert Vaught, Solomon Feferman, Richard Montague, James Donald Monk, Haim Gaifman, Donald Pigozzi and Roger Maddux, as well as Chen Chung Chang and Jerome Keisler, authors of Model Theory (1973),Chang, C.C., and Keisler, H.J., 1973. Model Theory. North-Holland, Amsterdam.  American Elsevier, New York. a classic text in the field.Feferman & Feferman, pp. 385-386 He also strongly influenced the dissertations of Alfred Lindenbaum, Dana Scott, and Steven Givant. Five of Tarski's students were women, a remarkable fact given that men represented an overwhelming majority of graduate students at the time.\n\nTarski lectured at University College, London (1950, 1966), the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9 in Paris (1955), the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science in Berkeley (1958\u201360), the University of California at Los Angeles (1967), and the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile (1974\u201375). Among many distinctions garnered over the course of his career, Tarski was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences, the British Academy and the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, received honorary degrees from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in 1975, from Marseilles' Paul C\u00e9zanne University in 1977 and from the University of Calgary, as well as the Berkeley Citation in 1981. Tarski presided over the Association for Symbolic Logic, 1944\u201346, and the International Union for the History and Philosophy of Science, 1956\u201357. He was also an honorary editor of Algebra Universalis.\n\nMathematician\nTarski's mathematical interests were exceptionally broad. His collected papers run to about 2,500 pages, most of them on mathematics, not logic. For a concise survey of Tarski's mathematical and logical accomplishments by his former student Solomon Feferman, see \"Interludes I\u2013VI\" in Feferman and Feferman.Feferman & Feferman, pp. 43-52, 69-75, 109-123, 189-195, 277-287, 334-342\n\nTarski's first paper, published when he was 19 years old, was on set theory, a subject to which he returned throughout his life. In 1924, he and Stefan Banach proved that, if one accepts the Axiom of Choice, a ball can be cut into a finite number of pieces, and then reassembled into a ball of larger size, or alternatively it can be reassembled into two balls whose sizes each equal that of the original one. This result is now called the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox.\n\nIn A decision method for elementary algebra and geometry, Tarski showed, by the method of quantifier elimination, that the first-order theory of the real numbers under addition and multiplication is decidable. (While this result appeared only in 1948, it dates back to 1930 and was mentioned in Tarski (1931).) This is a very curious result, because Alonzo Church proved in 1936 that Peano arithmetic (the theory  of natural numbers) is not decidable. Peano arithmetic is also incomplete by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem. In his 1953 Undecidable theories, Tarski et al. showed that many mathematical systems, including lattice theory, abstract projective geometry, and closure algebras, are all undecidable. The theory of Abelian groups is decidable, but that of non-Abelian groups is not.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Tarski often taught high school geometry. Using some ideas of Mario Pieri, in 1926 Tarski devised an original axiomatization for plane Euclidean geometry, one considerably more concise than Hilbert's. Tarski's axioms form a first-order theory devoid of set theory, whose individuals are points, and having only two primitive relations. In 1930, he proved this theory decidable because it can be mapped into another theory he had already proved decidable, namely his first-order theory of the real numbers.\n\nIn 1929 he showed that much of Euclidean solid geometry could be recast as a first-order theory whose individuals are spheres (a primitive notion), a single primitive binary relation \"is contained in\", and two axioms that, among other things, imply that containment partially orders the spheres. Relaxing the requirement that all individuals be spheres yields a formalization of mereology far easier to exposit than Lesniewski's variant. Near the end of his life, Tarski wrote a very long letter, published as Tarski and Givant (1999), summarizing his work on geometry.\n\nCardinal Algebras studied algebras whose models include the arithmetic of cardinal numbers. Ordinal Algebras sets out an algebra for the additive theory of order types. Cardinal, but not ordinal, addition commutes.\n\nIn 1941, Tarski published an important paper on binary relations, which began the work on relation algebra and its metamathematics that occupied Tarski and his students for much of the balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most axiomatic set theory and Peano arithmetic. For an introduction to relation algebra, see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski and his students devised cylindric algebras, which are to first-order logic what the two-element Boolean algebra is to classical sentential logic. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).\n\nLogician\nTarski's student, Vaught, has ranked Tarski as one of the four greatest logicians of all time \u2014 along with Aristotle, Gottlob Frege, and Kurt G\u00f6del.  However, Tarski often expressed great admiration for Charles Sanders Peirce, particularly for his pioneering work in the logic of relations.\n\nTarski produced axioms for logical consequence, and worked on deductive systems, the algebra of logic, and the theory of definability. His semantic methods, which culminated in the model theory he and a number of his Berkeley students developed in the 1950s and 60s, radically transformed Hilbert's proof-theoretic metamathematics.\n\nIn [Tarski's] view, metamathematics became similar to any mathematical discipline. Not only can its concepts and results be mathematized, but they actually can be integrated into mathematics. ... Tarski destroyed the borderline between metamathematics and mathematics. He objected to restricting the role of metamathematics to the foundations of mathematics.\n\nTarski's 1936 article \"On the concept of logical consequence\" argued that the conclusion of an argument will follow logically from its premises if and only if every model of the premises is a model of the conclusion. In 1937, he published a paper presenting clearly his views on the nature and purpose of the deductive method, and the role of logic in scientific studies. His high school and undergraduate teaching on logic and axiomatics culminated in a classic short text, published first in Polish, then in German translation, and finally in a 1941 English translation as Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences.\n\nTarski's 1969 \"Truth and proof\" considered both G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems and Tarski's undefinability theorem, and mulled over their consequences for the axiomatic method in mathematics.\n\nTruth in formalized languages\n\nIn 1933, Tarski published a very long paper in Polish, titled \"Poj\u0119cie prawdy w j\u0119zykach nauk dedukcyjnych\",Alfred Tarski, \"POJ\u0118CIE PRAWDY W J\u0118ZYKACH NAUK DEDUKCYJNYCH\", Towarszystwo Naukowe Warszawskie, Warszawa, 1933. (Text in Polish in the Digital Library WFISUW-IFISPAN-PTF). \"Setting out a mathematical definition of truth for formal languages.\" The 1935 German translation was titled \"Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen\", \"The concept of truth in formalized languages\", sometimes shortened to \"Wahrheitsbegriff\". An English translation appeared in the 1956 first edition of the volume Logic, Semantics, Metamathematics. This collection of papers from 1923 to 1938 is an event in 20th-century analytic philosophy, a contribution to symbolic logic, semantics, and the philosophy of language. For a brief discussion of its content, see Convention T (and also T-schema).\n\nSome recent philosophical debate examines the extent to which Tarski's theory of truth for formalized languages can be seen as a correspondence theory of truth. The debate centers on how to read Tarski's condition of material adequacy for a truth definition. That condition requires that the truth theory have the following as theorems for all sentences p of the language for which truth is being defined:\n\n \"p\" is true if and only if p.\n\n(where p is the proposition expressed by \"p\")\n\nThe debate amounts to whether to read sentences of this form, such as\n\n\"Snow is white\" is true if and only if snow is white\n\nas expressing merely a deflationary theory of truth or as embodying truth as a more substantial property (see Kirkham 1992). It is important to realize that Tarski's theory of truth is for formalized languages, so  examples in natural language are not illustrations of the use of Tarski's theory of truth.\n\nLogical consequence\nIn 1936, Tarski published Polish and German versions of a lecture he had given the preceding year at the International Congress of Scientific Philosophy in Paris.  A new English translation of this paper, Tarski (2002), highlights the many differences between the German and Polish versions of the paper, and corrects a number of mistranslations in Tarski (1983).\n\nThis publication set out the modern model-theoretic definition of (semantic) logical consequence, or at least the basis for it. Whether Tarski's notion was entirely the modern one turns on whether he intended to admit models with varying domains (and in particular, models with domains of different cardinalities). This question is a matter of some debate in the current philosophical literature. John Etchemendy stimulated much of the recent discussion about Tarski's treatment of varying domains.\n\nTarski ends by pointing out that his definition of logical consequence depends upon a division of terms into the logical and the extra-logical and he expresses some skepticism that any such objective division will be forthcoming. \"What are Logical Notions?\" can thus be viewed as continuing \"On the Concept of Logical Consequence\".\n\nWork on logical notions\nAnother theory of Tarski's attracting attention in the recent philosophical literature is that outlined in his \"What are Logical Notions?\" (Tarski 1986). This is the published version of a talk that he gave originally in 1966 in London and later in 1973 in Buffalo; it was edited without his direct involvement by John Corcoran. It became the most cited paper in the journal History and Philosophy of Logic.\n\nIn the talk, Tarski proposed a demarcation of the logical operations (which he calls \"notions\") from the non-logical. The suggested criteria were derived from the Erlangen programme of the German 19th century Mathematician, Felix Klein. Mautner, in 1946, and possibly an article by the Portuguese mathematician Sebastiao e Silva, anticipated Tarski in applying the Erlangen Program to logic.\n\nThat program classified the various types of geometry (Euclidean geometry, affine geometry, topology, etc.) by the type of one-one transformation of space onto itself that left the objects of that geometrical theory invariant. (A one-to-one transformation is a functional map of the space onto itself so that every point of the space is associated with or mapped to one other point of the space. So, \"rotate 30 degrees\" and  \"magnify by a factor of 2\" are intuitive descriptions of simple uniform one-one transformations.) Continuous transformations give rise to the objects of topology, similarity transformations to those of Euclidean geometry, and so on.\n\nAs the range of permissible transformations becomes broader, the range of objects one is able to distinguish as preserved by the application of the transformations becomes narrower. Similarity transformations are fairly narrow (they preserve the relative distance between points) and thus allow us to distinguish relatively many things (e.g., equilateral triangles from non-equilateral triangles). Continuous transformations (which can intuitively be thought of as transformations which allow non-uniform stretching, compression, bending, and twisting, but no ripping or glueing) allow us to distinguish a polygon from an annulus (ring with a hole in the centre), but do not allow us to distinguish two polygons from each other.\n\nTarski's proposal was to demarcate the logical notions by considering all possible one-to-one transformations (automorphisms) of a domain onto itself. By domain is meant the universe of discourse of a model for the semantic theory of a logic. If one identifies the truth value True with the domain set and the truth-value False with the empty set, then the following operations are counted as logical under the proposal:\n\n Truth-functions: All truth-functions are admitted by the proposal. This includes, but is not limited to, all n-ary truth-functions for finite n. (It also admits of truth-functions with any infinite number of places.)\n Individuals: No individuals, provided the domain has at least two members.\n Predicates:\n the one-place total and null predicates, the former having all members of the domain in its extension and the latter having no members of the domain in its extension\n two-place total and null predicates, the former having the set of all ordered pairs of domain members as its extension and the latter with the empty set as extension\n the two-place identity predicate, with the set of all order-pairs <a,a> in its extension, where a is a member of the domain\n the two-place diversity predicate, with the set of all order pairs <a,b> where a and b are distinct members of the domain\n n-ary predicates in general: all predicates definable from the identity predicate together with conjunction, disjunction and negation (up to any ordinality, finite or infinite)\n Quantifiers: Tarski explicitly discusses only monadic quantifiers and points out that all such numerical quantifiers are admitted under his proposal. These include the standard universal and existential quantifiers as well as numerical quantifiers such as \"Exactly four\", \"Finitely many\", \"Uncountably many\", and \"Between four and 9 million\", for example. While Tarski does not enter into the issue, it is also clear that polyadic quantifiers are admitted under the proposal. These are quantifiers like, given two predicates Fx and Gy, \"More(x, y)\", which says \"More things have F than have G.\"\n Set-Theoretic relations: Relations such as inclusion, intersection and union applied to subsets of the domain are logical in the present sense.\n Set membership: Tarski ended his lecture with a discussion of whether the set membership relation counted as logical in his sense. (Given the reduction of (most of) mathematics to set theory, this was, in effect, the question of whether most or all of mathematics is a part of logic.) He pointed out that set membership is logical if set theory is developed along the lines of type theory, but is extralogical if set theory is set out axiomatically, as in the canonical Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.\n Logical notions of higher order: While Tarski confined his discussion to operations of first-order logic, there is nothing about his proposal that necessarily restricts it to first-order logic. (Tarski likely restricted his attention to first-order notions as the talk was given to a non-technical audience.) So, higher-order quantifiers and predicates are admitted as well.\n\nIn some ways the present proposal is the obverse of that of Lindenbaum and Tarski (1936), who proved that all the logical operations of Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica are invariant under one-to-one transformations of the domain onto itself. The present proposal is also employed in Tarski and Givant (1987).\n\nSolomon Feferman and Vann McGee further discussed Tarski's proposal in work published after his death. Feferman (1999) raises problems for the proposal and suggests a cure: replacing Tarski's preservation by automorphisms with preservation by arbitrary homomorphisms. In essence, this suggestion circumvents the difficulty Tarski's proposal has in dealing with sameness of logical operation across distinct domains of a given cardinality and across domains of distinct cardinalities. Feferman's proposal results in a radical restriction of logical terms as compared to Tarski's original proposal. In particular, it ends up counting as logical only those operators of standard first-order logic without identity.\n\nMcGee (1996) provides a precise account of what operations are logical in the sense of Tarski's proposal in terms of expressibility in a language that extends first-order logic by allowing arbitrarily long conjunctions and disjunctions, and quantification over arbitrarily many variables. \"Arbitrarily\" includes a countable infinity.\n\nWorks\nAnthologies and collections\n 1986.

{"title": "Argumentation theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_theory", "text": "Argumentation theory, or argumentation, is the interdisciplinary study of how conclusions can be reached through logical reasoning; that is, claims based, soundly or not, on premises. It includes the arts and sciences of civil debate, dialogue, conversation, and persuasion. It studies rules of inference, logic, and procedural rules in both artificial and real world settings.  (hard).  (soft).\n\nArgumentation includes deliberation and negotiation which are concerned with collaborative decision-making procedures. It also encompasses eristic dialog, the branch of social debate in which victory over an opponent is the primary goal. This art and science is often the means by which people protect their beliefs or self-interests\u2014or choose to change them\u2014in rational dialogue, in common parlance, and during the process of arguing.\n\nArgumentation is used in law, for example in trials, in preparing an argument to be presented to a court, and in testing the validity of certain kinds of evidence. Also, argumentation scholars study the post hoc rationalizations by which organizational actors try to justify decisions they have made irrationally.\n\nArgumentation is one of four rhetorical modes (also known as modes of discourse), along with exposition, description, and narration. \n\n Key components of argumentation \n Understanding and identifying arguments, either explicit or implied, and the goals of the participants in the different types of dialogue.\n Identifying the premises from which conclusions are derived\n Establishing the \"burden of proof\" \u2013 determining who made the initial claim and is thus responsible for providing evidence why his/her position merits acceptance.\n For the one carrying the \"burden of proof\", the advocate, to marshal evidence for his/her position in order to convince or force the opponent's acceptance.  The method by which this is accomplished is producing valid, sound, and cogent arguments, devoid of weaknesses, and not easily attacked.\n In a debate, fulfillment of the burden of proof creates a burden of rejoinder. One must try to identify faulty reasoning in the opponent's argument, to attack the reasons/premises of the argument, to provide counterexamples if possible, to identify any fallacies, and to show why a valid conclusion cannot be derived from the reasons provided for his/her argument.\n\n Internal structure of arguments \nTypically an argument has an internal structure, comprising the following\na set of assumptions or premises\na method of reasoning or deduction and\na conclusion or point.\n\nAn argument has one or more premises and one conclusion.\n\nOften classical logic is used as the method of reasoning so that the conclusion follows logically from the assumptions or support.  One challenge is that if the set of assumptions is inconsistent then anything can follow logically from inconsistency. Therefore, it is common to insist that the set of assumptions be consistent. It is also good practice to require the set of assumptions to be the minimal set, with respect to set inclusion, necessary to infer the consequent.  Such arguments are called MINCON arguments, short for minimal consistent.  Such argumentation has been applied to the fields of law and medicine. A second school of argumentation investigates abstract arguments, where 'argument' is considered a primitive term, so no internal structure of arguments is taken on account.\n\nIn its most common form, argumentation involves an individual and an interlocutor or opponent engaged in dialogue, each contending differing positions and trying to persuade each other. Other types of dialogue in addition to persuasion are eristic, information seeking, inquiry, negotiation, deliberation, and the dialectical method (Douglas Walton). The dialectical method was made famous by Plato and his use of Socrates critically questioning various characters and historical figures.\n\nArgumentation and the grounds of knowledge\nArgumentation theory had its origins in foundationalism, a theory of knowledge (epistemology) in the field of philosophy. It sought to find the grounds for claims in the forms (logic) and materials (factual laws) of a universal system of knowledge. But argument scholars gradually rejected Aristotle's systematic philosophy and the idealism in Plato and Kant. They questioned and ultimately discarded the idea that argument premises take their soundness from formal philosophical systems. The field thus broadened.Bruce Gronbeck. \"From Argument to Argumentation: Fifteen Years of Identity Crisis.\" Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.\n\nKarl R. Wallace's seminal essay, \"The Substance of Rhetoric: Good Reasons\" in the Quarterly Journal of Speech (1963) 44, led many scholars to study \"marketplace argumentation\" \u2013 the ordinary arguments of ordinary people. The seminal essay on marketplace argumentation is Ray Lynn Anderson and C. David Mortensen's \"Logic and Marketplace Argumentation\" Quarterly Journal of Speech 53 (1967): 143\u2013150.See Joseph W. Wenzel \"Perspectives on Argument.\" Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.David Zarefsky. \"Product, Process, or Point of View? Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980. This line of thinking led to a natural alliance with late developments in the sociology of knowledge.See Ray E. McKerrow. \"Argument Communities: A Quest for Distinctions.\" Some scholars drew connections with recent developments in philosophy, namely the pragmatism of John Dewey and Richard Rorty. Rorty has called this shift in emphasis \"the linguistic turn\".\n\nIn this new hybrid approach argumentation is used with or without empirical evidence to establish convincing conclusions about issues which are moral, scientific, epistemic, or of a nature in which science alone cannot answer. Out of pragmatism and many intellectual developments in the humanities and social sciences, \"non-philosophical\" argumentation theories grew which located the formal and material grounds of arguments in particular intellectual fields.  These theories include informal logic, social epistemology, ethnomethodology, speech acts, the sociology of knowledge, the sociology of science, and social psychology. These new theories are not non-logical or anti-logical. They find logical coherence in most communities of discourse. These theories are thus often labeled \"sociological\" in that they focus on the social grounds of knowledge.\n\nApproaches to argumentation in communication and informal logic\nIn general, the label \"argumentation\" is used by communication scholars such as (to name only a few) Wayne E. Brockriede, Douglas Ehninger, Joseph W. Wenzel, Richard Rieke, Gordon Mitchell, Carol Winkler, Eric Gander, Dennis S. Gouran, Daniel J. O'Keefe, Mark Aakhus, Bruce Gronbeck, James Klumpp, G. Thomas Goodnight, Robin Rowland, Dale Hample, C. Scott Jacobs, Sally Jackson, David Zarefsky, and Charles Arthur Willard, while the term \"informal logic\" is preferred by philosophers, stemming from University of Windsor philosophers Ralph H. Johnson and J. Anthony Blair. Harald Wohlrapp developed a criterion for validness (Geltung, G\u00fcltigkeit) as freedom of objections.\n\nTrudy Govier, Douglas Walton, Michael Gilbert, Harvey Seigal, Michael Scriven, and John Woods (to name only a few) are other prominent authors in this tradition. Over the past thirty years, however, scholars from several disciplines have co-mingled at international conferences such as that hosted by the University of Amsterdam (the Netherlands) and the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA). Other international conferences are the biannual conference held at Alta, Utah sponsored by the (US) National Communication Association and American Forensics Association and conferences sponsored by the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA).\n\nSome scholars (such as Ralph H. Johnson) construe the term \"argument\" narrowly, as exclusively written discourse or even discourse in which all premises are explicit. Others (such as Michael Gilbert) construe the term \"argument\" broadly, to include spoken and even nonverbal discourse, for instance the degree to which a war memorial or propaganda poster can be said to argue or \"make arguments\". The philosopher Stephen Toulmin has said that an argument is a claim on our attention and belief, a view that would seem to authorize treating, say, propaganda posters as arguments. The dispute between broad and narrow theorists is of long standing and is unlikely to be settled. The views of the majority of argumentation theorists and analysts fall somewhere between these two extremes.\n\n Kinds of argumentation \n\nConversational argumentation\n\nThe study of naturally occurring conversation arose from the field of sociolinguistics. It is usually called conversation analysis. Inspired by ethnomethodology, it was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist Harvey Sacks and, among others, his close associates Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson. Sacks died early in his career, but his work was championed by others in his field, and CA has now become an established force in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology.Psathas, George (1995): Conversation Analysis, Thousand Oaks: Sage Sacks, Harvey. (1995). Lectures on Conversation. Blackwell Publishing. . Sacks, Harvey, Schegloff, Emanuel A., & Jefferson, Gail (1974). A simple systematic for the organization of turn-taking for conversation. Language, 50, 696-735. Schegloff, Emanuel A. (2007). Sequence Organization in Interaction: A Primer in Conversation Analysis, Volume 1, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ten Have, Paul (1999): Doing Conversation Analysis. A Practical Guide, Thousand Oaks: Sage. It is particularly influential in interactional sociolinguistics, discourse analysis and discursive psychology, as well as being a coherent discipline in its own right. Recently CA techniques of sequential analysis have been employed by phoneticians to explore the fine phonetic details of speech.\n\nEmpirical studies and theoretical formulations by Sally Jackson and Scott Jacobs, and several generations of their students, have described argumentation as a form of managing conversational disagreement within communication contexts and systems that naturally prefer agreement.\n\nMathematical argumentation\n\nThe basis of mathematical truth has been the subject of long debate. Frege in particular sought to demonstrate (see Gottlob Frege, The Foundations of Arithmetic, 1884, and Begriffsschrift, 1879) that arithmetical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms and therefore are, in the end, logical truths. The project was developed by Russell and Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica. If an argument can be cast in the form of sentences in Symbolic Logic, then it can be tested by the application of accepted proof procedures. This has been carried out for Arithmetic using Peano axioms. Be that as it may, an argument in Mathematics, as in any other discipline, can be considered valid only if it can be shown that it cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.\n\nScientific argumentation\n\nPerhaps the most radical statement of the social grounds of scientific knowledge appears in Alan G.Gross's The Rhetoric of Science (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990). Gross holds that science is rhetorical \"without remainder\", meaning that scientific knowledge itself cannot be seen as an idealized ground of knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced rhetorically, meaning that it has special epistemic authority only insofar as its communal methods of verification are trustworthy. This thinking represents an almost complete rejection of the foundationalism on which argumentation was first based.\n\nInterpretive argumentation\n\nInterpretive argumentation is a dialogical process in which participants explore and/or resolve interpretations often of a text of any medium containing significant ambiguity in meaning.\n\nInterpretive argumentation is pertinent to the humanities, hermeneutics, literary theory, linguistics, semantics, pragmatics, semiotics, analytic philosophy and aesthetics.  Topics in conceptual interpretation include aesthetic, judicial, logical and religious interpretation.  Topics in scientific interpretation include scientific modeling.\n\nLegal argumentation\n\nLegal arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer, or parties when representing themselves of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. A closing argument, or summation, is the concluding statement of each party's counsel reiterating the important arguments for the trier of fact, often the jury, in a court case. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence.\n\nPolitical argumentation\n\nPolitical arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events.Michael McGee. \"The 'Ideograph' as a Unit of Analysis in Political Argument.\" Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980. The rationality of the public is a major question in this line of research. Political scientist Samuel L. Popkin coined the expression \"low information voters\" to describe most voters who know very little about politics or the world in general.\n\nIn practice, a \"low information voter\" may not be aware of legislation that their representative has sponsored in Congress.  A low-information voter may base their ballot box decision on a media sound-bite, or a flier received in the mail.  It is possible for a media sound-bite or campaign flier to present a political position for the incumbent candidate that completely contradicts the legislative action taken in the Capitol on behalf of the constituents.  It may only take a small percentage of the overall voting group who base their decision on the inaccurate information, a voter block of 10 to 12%, to swing an overall election result.  When this happens, the constituency at large may have been duped or fooled.  Nevertheless, the election result is legal and confirmed.  Savvy Political consultants will take advantage of low-information voters and sway their votes with disinformation because it can be easier and sufficiently effective.  Fact checkers have come about in recent years to help counter the effects of such campaign tactics.\n\nPsychological aspects\nPsychology has long studied the non-logical aspects of argumentation.  For example, studies have shown that simple repetition of an idea is often a more effective method of argumentation than appeals to reason.  Propaganda often utilizes repetition.Jacques Ellul, Propaganda, Vintage, 1973,  . Nazi rhetoric has been studied extensively as, inter alia, a repetition campaign.\n\nEmpirical studies of communicator credibility and attractiveness, sometimes labeled charisma, have also been tied closely to empirically-occurring arguments. Such studies bring argumentation within the ambit of persuasion theory and practice.\n\nSome psychologists such as William J. McGuire believe that the syllogism is the basic unit of human reasoning. They have produced a large body of empirical work around McGuire's famous title \"A Syllogistic Analysis of Cognitive Relationships\". A central line of this way of thinking is that logic is contaminated by psychological variables such as \"wishful thinking\", in which subjects confound the likelihood of predictions with the desirability of the predictions. People hear what they want to hear and see what they expect to see. If planners want something to happen they see it as likely to happen. If they hope something will not happen, they see it as unlikely to happen. Thus smokers think that they personally will avoid cancer, promiscuous people practice unsafe sex, and teenagers drive recklessly.\n\nTheories\n\nArgument fields\nStephen Toulmin and Charles Arthur Willard have championed the idea of argument fields, the former drawing upon Ludwig Wittgenstein's notion of language games, (Sprachspiel) the latter drawing from communication and argumentation theory, sociology, political science, and social epistemology. For Toulmin, the term \"field\" designates discourses within which arguments and factual claims are grounded.  For Willard, the term \"field\" is interchangeable with \"community\", \"audience\", or \"readership\".Charles Arthur Willard. \"Some Questions About Toulmin's View of Argument Fields.\" Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980. \"Field Theory: A Cartesian Meditation.\" George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation. Along similar lines, G. Thomas Goodnight has studied \"spheres\" of argument and sparked a large literature created by younger scholars responding to or using his ideas.G. T. Goodnight, \"The Personal, Technical, and Public Spheres of Argument.\" Journal of the American Forensics Association. (1982) 18:214-227. The general tenor of these field theories is that the premises of arguments take their meaning from social communities.Bruce E. Gronbeck. \"Sociocultural Notions of Argument Fields: A Primer.\" George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation. (1981) 1-20.\n\nField studies might focus on social movements, issue-centered publics (for instance, pro-life versus pro-choice in the abortion dispute), small activist groups, corporate public relations campaigns and issue management, scientific communities and disputes, political campaigns, and intellectual traditions.Robert Rowland, \"Purpose, Argument Fields, and Theoretical Justification.\" Argumentation. vol. 22 Number 2 (2008) 235-250. In the manner of a sociologist, ethnographer, anthropologist, participant-observer, and journalist, the field theorist gathers and reports on real-world human discourses, gathering case studies that might eventually be combined to produce high-order explanations of argumentation processes. This is not a quest for some master language or master theory covering all specifics of human activity. Field theorists are agnostic about the possibility of a single grand theory and skeptical about the usefulness of such a theory. Theirs is a more modest quest for \"mid-range\" theories that might permit generalizations about families of discourses.\n\nStephen E. Toulmin's contributions\nBy far, the most influential theorist has been Stephen Toulmin, the Cambridge educated philosopher and educator, best known for his Toulmin model of argument. What follows below is a sketch of his ideas.\n\nAn alternative to absolutism and relativism\nToulmin has argued that absolutism (represented by theoretical or analytic arguments) has limited practical value. Absolutism is derived from Plato's idealized formal logic, which advocates universal truth; thus absolutists believe that moral issues can be resolved by adhering to a standard set of moral principles, regardless of context. By contrast, Toulmin asserts that many of these so-called standard principles are irrelevant to real situations encountered by human beings in daily life.\n\nTo describe his vision of daily life, Toulmin introduced the concept of argument fields; in The Uses of Argument (1958), Toulmin states that some aspects of arguments vary from field to field, and are hence called \"field-dependent\", while other aspects of argument are the same throughout all fields, and are hence called \"field-invariant\". The flaw of absolutism, Toulmin believes, lies in its unawareness of the field-dependent aspect of argument; absolutism assumes that all aspects of argument are field invariant.\n\nToulmin's theories resolve to avoid the defects of absolutism without resorting to relativism: relativism, Toulmin asserted, provides no basis for distinguishing between a moral or immoral argument. In Human Understanding (1972), Toulmin suggests that anthropologists have been tempted to side with relativists because they have noticed the influence of cultural variations on rational arguments; in other words, the anthropologist or relativist overemphasizes the importance of the \"field-dependent\" aspect of arguments, and becomes unaware of the \"field-invariant\" elements. In an attempt to provide solutions to the problems of absolutism and relativism, Toulmin attempts throughout his work to develop standards that are neither absolutist nor relativist for assessing the worth of ideas.\n\nToulmin believes that a good argument can succeed in providing good justification to a claim, which will stand up to criticism and earn a favourable verdict.\n\nToulmin Model of Argument\n\nIn The Uses of Argument (1958), Toulmin introduced what became known as the Toulmin Model of Argument, which broke argument into six interrelated components:\n\nClaim: Conclusions whose merit must be established. For example, if a person tries to convince a listener that he is a British citizen, the claim would be \"I am a British citizen.\" (1)\nData: The facts we appeal to as a foundation for the claim. For example, the person introduced in 1 can support his claim with the supporting data \"I was born in Bermuda.\" (2)\nWarrant: The statement authorizing our movement from the data to the claim. In order to move from the data established in 2, \"I was born in Bermuda,\" to the claim in 1, \"I am a British citizen,\" the person must supply a warrant to bridge the gap between 1 & 2 with the statement \"A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen.\" (3)\nBacking: Credentials designed to certify the statement expressed in the warrant; backing must be introduced when the warrant itself is not convincing enough to the readers or the listeners. For example, if the listener does not deem the warrant in 3 as credible, the speaker will supply the legal provisions as backing statement to show that it is true that \"A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen.\"\nRebuttal: Statements recognizing the restrictions to which the claim may legitimately be applied. The rebuttal is exemplified as follows, \"A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British citizen, unless he has betrayed Britain and has become a spy of another country.\"\nQualifier: Words or phrases expressing the speaker's degree of force or certainty concerning the claim. Such words or phrases include \"possible,\" \"probably,\" \"impossible,\" \"certainly,\" \"presumably,\" \"as far as the evidence goes,\" or \"necessarily.\" The claim \"I am definitely a British citizen\" has a greater degree of force than the claim \"I am a British citizen, presumably.\"\n\nThe first three elements \"claim\", \"data\", and \"warrant\" are considered as the essential components of practical arguments, while the second triad \"qualifier\", \"backing\", and \"rebuttal\" may not be needed in some arguments.\n\nWhen first proposed, this layout of argumentation is based on legal arguments and intended to be used to analyze the rationality of arguments typically found in the courtroom; in fact, Toulmin did not realize that this layout would be applicable to the field of rhetoric and communication until his works were introduced to rhetoricians by Wayne Brockriede and Douglas Ehninger. Their \"Decision by Debate\" (1963) streamlined Toulmin's terminology and broadly introduced his model to the field of debate.\"The most lasting legacy of the work is its break with formal, deductive logic and its introduction of Stephen Toulmin's model of argument to undergraduate student debaters, which, since then, has become a mainstay of what many have called the Renaissance of argumentation studies. Without the work presented in Decision by Debate, contemporary interdisciplinary views of argumentation that now dominate many disciplines might have never have taken place or at least have been severely delayed,\" Google Books review Only after he published Introduction to Reasoning (1979) were the rhetorical applications of this layout mentioned in his works.\n\n The evolution of knowledge \nToulmin's Human Understanding (1972) asserts that conceptual change is evolutionary. This book attacks Thomas Kuhn's explanation of conceptual change in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn held that conceptual change is a revolutionary (as opposed to an evolutionary) process in which mutually exclusive paradigms compete to replace one another. Toulmin criticizes the relativist elements in Kuhn's thesis, as he points out that the mutually exclusive paradigms provide no ground for comparison; in other words, Kuhn's thesis has made the relativists' error of overemphasizing the \"field variant\" while ignoring the \"field invariant\", or commonality shared by all argumentation or scientific paradigms.\n\nToulmin proposes an evolutionary model of conceptual change comparable to Darwin's model of biological evolution. On this reasoning, conceptual change involves innovation and selection. Innovation accounts for the appearance of conceptual variations, while selection accounts for the survival and perpetuation of the soundest conceptions. Innovation occurs when the professionals of a particular discipline come to view things differently from their predecessors; selection subjects the innovative concepts to a process of debate and inquiry in what Toulmin considers as a \"forum of competitions\". The soundest concepts will survive the forum of competition as replacements or revisions of the traditional conceptions.\n\nFrom the absolutists' point of view, concepts are either valid or invalid regardless of contexts; from a relativists' perspective, one concept is neither better nor worse than a rival concept from a different cultural context. From Toulmin's perspective, the evaluation depends on a process of comparison, which determines whether or not one concept will provide improvement to our explanatory power more so than its rival concepts.\n\nRejection of certainty\nIn Cosmopolis (1990), Toulmin traces the quest for certainty back to Descartes and Hobbes, and lauds Dewey, Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Rorty for abandoning that tradition.\n\nPragma-dialectics\n\nScholars at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands have pioneered a rigorous modern version of dialectic  under the name pragma-dialectics. The intuitive idea is to formulate clearcut rules that, if followed, will yield rational discussion and sound conclusions. Frans H. van Eemeren, the late Rob Grootendorst, and many of their students have produced a large body of work expounding this idea.\n\nThe dialectical conception of reasonableness is given by ten rules for critical discussion, all being instrumental for achieving a resolution of the difference of opinion (from Van Eemeren, Grootendorst, & Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, p.\u00a0182-183). The theory postulates this as an ideal model, and not something one expects to find as an empirical fact. The model can however serve as an important heuristic and critical tool for testing how reality approximates this ideal and point to where discourse goes wrong, that is, when the rules are violated. Any such violation will constitute a fallacy. Albeit not primarily focused on fallacies, pragma-dialectics provides a systematic approach to deal with them in a coherent way.\n\nWalton's logical argumentation method\n\nDoug Walton developed a distinctive philosophical theory of logical argumentation built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze and evaluate arguments in everyday conversational discourse and in more structured areas such as debate, law and scientific fields. There are four main components: argumentation schemes, dialogue structures, argument mapping tools, and formal argumentation systems. The method uses the notion of commitment in dialogue as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief. Commitments are statements that the agent has expressed or formulated, and has pledged to carry out, or has publicly asserted. According to the commitment model, agents interact with each other in a dialogue in which each takes its turn to contribute speech acts. The dialogue framework uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument.\n\nWalton's logical argumentation model takes a different view of proof and justification from that taken in the dominant epistemology in analytical philosophy, which is based on a justified true belief framework. On the logical argumentation approach, knowledge is seen as form of belief commitment firmly fixed by an argumentation procedure that tests the evidence on both sides, and use standards of proof to determine whether a proposition qualifies as knowledge. On this evidence-based approach, scientific knowledge must be seen as defeasible.\n\n Artificial intelligence \n\nEfforts have been made within the field of artificial intelligence to perform and analyze the act of argumentation with computers.  Argumentation has been used to provide a proof-theoretic semantics for non-monotonic logic, starting with the influential work of Dung (1995). Computational argumentation systems have found particular application in domains where formal logic and classical decision theory are unable to capture the richness of reasoning, domains such as law and medicine. In Elements of Argumentation, Philippe Besnard and Anthony Hunter show how classical logic-based techniques can be used to capture key elements of practical argumentation.P. Besnard & A. Hunter, \"Elements of Argumentation.\" MIT Press, 2008. See also: \n\nWithin computer science, the ArgMAS workshop series (Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems), the CMNA workshop series,Computational Models of Natural Argument and now the COMMA Conference,Computational Models of Argument are regular annual events attracting participants from every continent. The journal Argument & ComputationJournal of Argument & Computation  is dedicated to exploring the intersection between argumentation and computer science. ArgMining is a workshop series dedicated specifically to the related argument mining task.\n\nSee also\n\n Argument\n Argumentation ethics\n Argumentum a fortiori\n Criticism\n Defeasible reasoning\n Discourse ethics\n Essentially contested concept\n Forensics\n Legal theory\n Logic and dialectic\n Logic of argumentation\n Negotiation theory\n Pars destruens and pars construens\n Public sphere\n Rationality\n Rhetoric\n Rogerian argument\n Social engineering (political science)\n Social psychology\n Sophistry\n Source criticism\n Straight and Crooked Thinking\n\nReferences\n\n Further reading \n\nJ.

{"title": "Augustin-Louis Cauchy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin-Louis_Cauchy", "text": "Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy  (;\"Cauchy\". Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. ; 21 August 178923 May 1857) was a French mathematician, engineer and physicist who made pioneering contributions to several branches of mathematics, including mathematical analysis and continuum mechanics. He was one of the first to state and rigorously prove theorems of calculus, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra of earlier authors. He almost singlehandedly founded complex analysis and the study of permutation groups in abstract algebra.\n\nA profound mathematician, Cauchy had a great influence over his contemporaries and successors; Hans Freudenthal stated: \"More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician (in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy).\" Cauchy was a prolific writer; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks on a variety of topics in the fields of mathematics and mathematical physics.\n\nBiography\n\nYouth and education\nCauchy was the son of Louis Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy (1760\u20131848) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre. Cauchy had two brothers: Alexandre Laurent Cauchy (1792\u20131857), who became a president of a division of the court of appeal in 1847 and a judge of the court of cassation in 1849, and Eugene Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy (1802\u20131877), a publicist who also wrote several mathematical works.\n\nCauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818.  She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy's works. They had two daughters, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia (1819) and Marie Mathilde (1823).\n\nCauchy's father (Louis Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the \nAncien R\u00e9gime, but lost this position due to the French Revolution (July 14, 1789), which broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born.His father's dismissal is sometimes seen as the cause of the deep hatred of the French Revolution that Cauchy felt all through his life. The Cauchy family survived the revolution and the following Reign of Terror (1793-4) by escaping to Arcueil, where Cauchy received his first education, from his father. After the execution of Robespierre (1794), it was safe for the family to return to Paris. There Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job in 1800, and quickly moved up the ranks. When Napoleon Bonaparte came to power (1799), Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cauchy was further promoted, and became Secretary-General of the Senate, working directly under Laplace (who is now better known for his work on mathematical physics). The famous mathematician Lagrange was also a friend of the Cauchy family.\n\nOn Lagrange's advice, Augustin-Louis was enrolled in the \u00c9cole Centrale du Panth\u00e9on, the best secondary school of Paris at that time, in the fall of 1802. Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages; the young and ambitious Cauchy, being a brilliant student, won many prizes in Latin and the humanities. In spite of these successes, Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career, and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the \u00c9cole Polytechnique.\n\nIn 1805, he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam, and he was admitted. One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education. The school functioned under military discipline, which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting. Nevertheless, he finished the Polytechnique in 1807, at the age of 18, and went on to the \u00c9cole des Ponts et Chauss\u00e9es (School for Bridges and Roads). He graduated in civil engineering, with the highest honors.\n\nEngineering days\nAfter finishing school in 1810, Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg, where Napoleon intended to build a naval base. Here Augustin-Louis stayed for three years, and was assigned the Ourcq Canal project and the Saint-Cloud Bridge project, and worked at the Harbor of Cherbourg. Although he had an extremely busy managerial job, he still found time to prepare three mathematical manuscripts, which he submitted to the Premi\u00e8re Classe (First Class) of the Institut de France.In the revolutionary years the French Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was known as the \"First Class\" of the Institut de France. Cauchy's first two manuscripts (on polyhedra) were accepted; the third one (on directrices of conic sections) was rejected.\n\nIn September 1812, now 23 years old, Cauchy returned to Paris after becoming ill from overwork. Another reason for his return to the capital was that he was losing his interest in his engineering job, being more and more attracted to the abstract beauty of mathematics; in Paris, he would have a much better chance to find a mathematics related position. Therefore, when his health improved in 1813, Cauchy chose to not return to Cherbourg. Although he formally kept his engineering position, he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior. The next three years Augustin-Louis was mainly on unpaid sick leave, and spent his time quite fruitfully, working on mathematics (on the related topics of symmetric functions, the symmetric group and the theory of higher-order algebraic equations). He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815. In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand. The Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences was re-established in March 1816; Lazare Carnot and Gaspard Monge were removed from this Academy for political reasons, and the king appointed Cauchy to take the place of one of them. The reaction of Cauchy's peers was harsh; they considered the acceptance of his membership in the Academy an outrage, and Cauchy thereby created many enemies in scientific circles.\n\nProfessor at \u00c9cole Polytechnique\nIn November 1815, Louis Poinsot, who was an associate professor at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, asked to be exempted from his teaching duties for health reasons. Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star, who certainly merited a professorship. One of his great successes at that time was the proof of Fermat's polygonal number theorem. However, the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons, doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot. He finally quit his engineering job, and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique. In 1816, this Bonapartist, non-religious school was reorganized, and several liberal professors were fired; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor.\n\nWhen Cauchy was 28 years old, he was still living with his parents. His father found it high time for his son to marry; he found him a suitable bride, Alo\u00efse de Bure, five years his junior. The de Bure family were printers and booksellers, and published most of Cauchy's works.Bradley & Sandifer page 9 Alo\u00efse and Augustin were married on April 4, 1818, with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony, in the Church of Saint-Sulpice. In 1819 the couple's first daughter, Marie Fran\u00e7oise Alicia, was born, and in 1823 the second and last daughter, Marie Mathilde.  \n\nThe conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly. In 1824 Louis XVIII died, and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother Charles X. During these years Cauchy was highly productive, and published one important mathematical treatise after another. He received cross appointments at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and the .\n\nIn exile\nIn July 1830, the July Revolution occurred in France. Charles X fled the country, and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king Louis-Philippe (of the House of Orl\u00e9ans). Riots, in which uniformed students of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique took an active part, raged close to Cauchy's home in Paris.\n\nThese events marked a turning point in Cauchy's life, and a break in his mathematical productivity. Cauchy, shaken by the fall of the government, and moved by a deep hatred of the liberals who were taking power, left Paris to go abroad, leaving his family behind. He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland, where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime. He refused to do this, and consequently lost all his positions in Paris, except his membership of the Academy, for which an oath was not required. In 1831 Cauchy went to the Italian city of Turin, and after some time there, he accepted an offer from the King of Sardinia (who ruled Turin and the surrounding Piedmont region) for a chair of theoretical physics, which was created especially for him. He taught in Turin during 1832\u20131833. In 1831, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the following year a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nIn August 1833 Cauchy left Turin for Prague, to become the science tutor of the thirteen-year-old Duke of Bordeaux Henri d'Artois (1820\u20131883), the exiled Crown Prince and grandson of Charles X. As a professor of the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Cauchy had been a notoriously bad lecturer, assuming levels of understanding that only a few of his best students could reach, and cramming his allotted time with too much material. The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science, so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch. Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously, he did this with great clumsiness, and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke.\n\nDuring his civil engineering days, Cauchy once had been briefly in charge of repairing a few of the Parisian sewers, and he made the mistake of mentioning this to his pupil; with great malice, the young Duke went about saying Mister Cauchy started his career in the sewers of Paris. His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old, in September 1838. Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years, while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics. The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy's promotion to baron, a title by which Cauchy set great store. In 1834, his wife and two daughters moved to Prague, and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family after four years in exile.\n\nLast years\nCauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838. He could not regain his teaching positions, because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance. \n\nthumb|left|Cauchy prior to 1857\nIn August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes. This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy; for instance, it had the right to co-opt its members. Further, it was believed that members of the Bureau could \"forget\" about the oath of allegiance, although formally, unlike the Academicians, they were obliged to take it. The Bureau des Longitudes was an organization founded in 1795 to solve the problem of determining position on sea \u2013 mainly the longitudinal coordinate, since latitude is easily determined from the position of the sun. Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations, the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences.\n\nIn November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau, and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with. Without his oath, the king refused to approve his election. For four years Cauchy was in the position of being elected, but not being approved; hence, he was not a formal member of the Bureau, did not receive payment, could not participate in meetings, and could not submit papers. Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths; however, he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics. In 1840, he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy. He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers, an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson. The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843, when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled over the separation of Church and State. After losing control of the public education system, the Catholic Church sought to establish its own branch of education and found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally. He lent his prestige and knowledge to the \u00c9cole Normale \u00c9ccl\u00e9siastique, a school in Paris run by Jesuits, for training teachers for their colleges. He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique. The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France. These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who, on the whole, supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution. When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1843, Cauchy applied for it, but got just three out of 45 votes.\n\nThe year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe; revolutions broke out in numerous countries, beginning in France. King Louis-Philippe, fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI, fled to England. The oath of allegiance was abolished, and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy. On March 1, 1849, he was reinstated at the Facult\u00e9 de Sciences, as a professor of mathematical astronomy. After political turmoil all through 1848, France chose to become a Republic, under the Presidency of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of Napoleon Bonaparte, and son of Napoleon's brother, who had been installed as the first king of Holland. Soon (early 1852) the President made himself Emperor of France, and took the name Napoleon III.\n\nNot unexpectedly, the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to again require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries, including university professors. This time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath. Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67. He received the Last Rites and died of a bronchial condition at 4\u00a0a.m. on 23 May 1857.\n\nHis name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.\n\nWork\n\nEarly work\nThe genius of Cauchy was illustrated in his simple solution of the problem of Apollonius\u2014describing a circle touching three given circles\u2014which he discovered in 1805, his generalization of Euler's formula on polyhedra in 1811, and in several other elegant problems. More important is his memoir on wave propagation, which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816. Cauchy's writings covered notable topics including: the theory of series, where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series. In the theory of numbers and complex quantities, he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers. He also wrote on the theory of groups and substitutions, the theory of functions, differential equations and determinants.\n\nWave theory, mechanics, elasticity\nIn the theory of light he worked on Fresnel's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light.  He also contributed significant research in mechanics, substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter. He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media. He introducedCauchy, De la pression ou tension dans un corps solide, [On the pressure or tension in a solid body], Exercices de Math\u00e9matiques, vol. 2, p. 42 (1827) a 3 \u00d7 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor. In elasticity, he originated the theory of stress, and his results are nearly as valuable as those of Sim\u00e9on Poisson.\n\nNumber theory\nOther significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat polygonal number theorem.\n\nComplex functions\nCauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory. The first pivotal theorem proved by Cauchy, now known as Cauchy's integral theorem, was the following:\n\nwhere f(z) is a complex-valued function holomorphic on and within the non-self-intersecting closed curve C (contour) lying in the complex plane. The contour integral is taken along the contour C. The rudiments of this theorem can already be found in a paper that the 24-year-old Cauchy presented to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (then still called \"First Class of the Institute\") on August 11, 1814. In full form the theorem was given in 1825.Cauchy, M\u00e9moire sur les int\u00e9grales d\u00e9finies prises entre des limites imaginaires [Memorandum on definite integrals taken between imaginary limits], submitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences on February 28, 1825 The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy's most important contribution to mathematics.\n\nIn 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function.Cauchy, Sur un nouveau genre de calcul analogue au calcul infinit\u00e9simal [On a new type of calculus analogous to the infinitesimal calculus], Exercices de Math\u00e9matique, vol. 1, p. 11 (1826) This concept regards functions that have poles\u2014isolated singularities, i.e., points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity. If the complex-valued function f(z) can be expanded in the neighborhood  of a singularity a as\n\nwhere \u03c6(z) is analytic (i.e., well-behaved without singularities), then f is said to have a pole of order n in the point a. If n = 1, the pole is called simple.\nThe coefficient B1 is called by Cauchy the residue of function f at a. If f is non-singular at a then the residue of f is zero at a. Clearly the residue is in the case of a simple pole equal to,\n\nwhere we replaced B1 by the modern notation of the residue.\n\nIn 1831, while in Turin, Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin. In the firstCauchy, Sur la m\u00e9canique c\u00e9leste et sur un nouveau calcul qui s'applique \u00e0 un grande nombre de questions diverses [On the celestial mechanics and on a new calculus that can be applied to a great number of diverse questions], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, October 11, 1831. he proposed the formula now known as Cauchy's integral formula,\n\nwhere f(z) is analytic on C and within the region bounded by the contour C and the complex number a is somewhere in this region. The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise. Clearly, the integrand has a simple pole at z = a. In the second paperCauchy, M\u00e9moire sur les rapports qui existent entre le calcul des R\u00e9sidus et le calcul des Limites, et sur les avantages qu'offrent ces deux calculs dans la r\u00e9solution des \u00e9quations alg\u00e9briques ou transcendantes Memorandum on the connections that exist between the residue calculus and the limit calculus, and on the advantages that these two calculi offer in solving algebraic and transcendental equations], presented to the Academy of Sciences of Turin, November 27, 1831. he presented the residue theorem,\n\nwhere the sum is over all the n poles of f(z) on and within the contour C. These results of Cauchy's still form the core of complex function theory as it is taught today to physicists and electrical engineers. For quite some time, contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory, believing it to be too complicated. Only in the 1840s the theory started to get response, with Pierre Alphonse Laurent being the first mathematician, besides Cauchy, making a substantial contribution (his Laurent series published in 1843).\n\nCours d'Analyse\n\nleft|thumb|The title page of a textbook by Cauchy. In his book Cours d'Analyse Cauchy stressed the importance of rigor in analysis. Rigor in this case meant the rejection of the principle of Generality of algebra (of earlier authors such as Euler and Lagrange) and its replacement by geometry and infinitesimals.. Judith Grabiner wrote Cauchy was \"the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe.\"  The book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities, and  arguments were introduced into Calculus.  Here Cauchy defined continuity as follows: The function f(x) is continuous with respect to x between the given limits if, between these limits, an infinitely small increment in the variable always produces an infinitely small increment in the function itself.\n\nM. Barany claims that the \u00c9cole mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy's better judgement .  Gilain notes that when the portion of the curriculum devoted to Analyse Alg\u00e9brique was reduced in 1825, Cauchy insisted on placing the topic of continuous functions (and therefore also infinitesimals) at the beginning of the Differential Calculus . Laugwitz (1989) and Benis-Sinaceur (1973) point out that Cauchy continued to use infinitesimals in his own research as late as 1853.\n\nCauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero.  There has been a vast body of literature written about Cauchy's notion of \"infinitesimally small quantities\", arguing they lead from everything from the usual \"epsilontic\" definitions or to the notions of non-standard analysis. The consensus is that Cauchy omitted or left implicit the important ideas to make clear the precise meaning of the infinitely small quantities he used. \n\nTaylor's theorem\nHe was the first to prove Taylor's theorem rigorously, establishing his well-known form of the remainder. He wrote a textbook (reissued by Cambridge University Press, 2009; ) (see the illustration) for his students at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in which he developed the basic theorems of mathematical analysis as rigorously as possible. In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught. Also Cauchy's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book: Cauchy condensation test. In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook.Cauchy, Le\u00e7ons sur le Calcul Diff\u00e9rentiel, Paris (1829) In spite of these, Cauchy's own research papers often used intuitive, not rigorous, methods;Morris Kline, Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty, , p. 176 thus one of his theorems was exposed to a \"counter-example\" by Abel, later fixed by the introduction of the notion of uniform continuity.\n\nArgument principle, stability\nIn a paper published in 1855, two years before Cauchy's death, he discussed some theorems, one of which is similar to the \"Argument Principle\" in many modern textbooks on complex analysis. In modern control theory textbooks, the Cauchy argument principle is quite frequently used to derive the Nyquist stability criterion, which can be used to predict the stability of negative feedback amplifier and negative feedback control systems. Thus Cauchy's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering.\n\nOutput\nthumb|Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul diff\u00e9rentiel, 1829\n\nCauchy was very productive, in number of papers second only to Leonhard Euler. It took almost a century to collect all his writings into 27 large volumes:\n Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes d'Augustin Cauchy publi\u00e9es sous la direction scientifique de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences et sous les auspices de M. le ministre de l'Instruction publique (27 volumes) (Paris : Gauthier-Villars et fils, 1882\u20131974)\nHis greatest contributions to mathematical science are enveloped in the rigorous methods which he introduced; these are mainly embodied in his three great treatises:\n Cours d'analyse de l'\u00c9cole royale polytechnique (1821)\n Le Calcul infinit\u00e9simal (1823)\n Le\u00e7ons sur les applications de calcul infinit\u00e9simal; La g\u00e9om\u00e9trie (1826\u20131828)\nHis other works include:\n Exercices d'analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 1)\n Exercices d'analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 2)\n Exercices d'analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 3)\n Exercices d'analyse et de physique mathematique (Volume 4) (Paris: Bachelier, 1840\u20131847)\n Analyse alg\u00e8brique (Imprimerie Royale, 1821)\n Nouveaux exercices de math\u00e9matiques (Paris : Gauthier-Villars, 1895)\n Courses of mechanics (for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique)\n Higher algebra (for the )\n Mathematical physics (for the Coll\u00e8ge de France).\n M\u00e9moire sur l'emploi des equations symboliques dans le calcul infinit\u00e9simal et dans le calcul aux diff\u00e9rences finis  CR Ac ad. Sci. Paris, t. XVII, 449\u2013458 (1843) credited as originating the operational calculus.\n\nPolitics and religious beliefs\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy grew up in the house of a staunch royalist. This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution. Their life there during that time was apparently hard; Augustin-Louis's father, Louis Fran\u00e7ois, spoke of living on rice, bread, and crackers during the period. A paragraph from an undated letter from Louis Fran\u00e7ois to his mother in Rouen says:C. A. Valson. La Vie et les Travaux du baron Cauchy, v. 1, p. 13.\n\nIn any event, he inherited his father's staunch royalism and hence refused to take oaths to any government after the overthrow of Charles X.\n\nHe was an equally staunch Catholic and a member of the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so. His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic. It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Potato Famine.\n\nHis royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious, which caused difficulties with his colleagues. He felt that he was mistreated for his beliefs, but his opponents felt he intentionally provoked people by berating them over religious matters or by defending the Jesuits after they had been suppressed. Niels Henrik Abel called him a \"bigoted Catholic\". and added he was \"mad and there is nothing that can be done about him\", but at the same time praised him as a mathematician. Cauchy's views were widely unpopular among mathematicians and when Guglielmo Libri Carucci dalla Sommaja was made chair in mathematics before him he, and many others, felt his views were the cause. When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville rather than Cauchy, which caused a rift between Liouville and Cauchy. Another dispute with political overtones concerned Jean Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks. Cauchy was later shown, by Jean-Victor Poncelet, to be wrong.\n\nSee also\n\n List of topics named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy\n Cauchy\u2013Binet formula\n Cauchy boundary condition\n Cauchy's convergence test\n Cauchy (crater)\n Cauchy determinant\n Cauchy distribution\n Cauchy's equation\n Cauchy\u2013Euler equation\n Cauchy functional equation\n Cauchy horizon\n Cauchy formula for repeated integration\n Cauchy\u2013Frobenius lemma\n Cauchy\u2013Hadamard theorem\n Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem\n Cauchy momentum equation\n Cauchy\u2013Peano theorem\n Cauchy principal value\n Cauchy problem\n Cauchy product\n Cauchy's radical test\n Cauchy\u2013Rassias stability\n Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations\n Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality\n Cauchy sequence\n Cauchy surface\n Cauchy's theorem (geometry)\n Cauchy's theorem (group theory)\n Maclaurin-Cauchy test\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Boyer, C.: The concepts of the calculus.

{"title": "Axiom of infinity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_infinity", "text": "In axiomatic set theory and the branches of mathematics and philosophy that use it, the axiom of infinity is one of the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.  It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.Zermelo: Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Grundlagen der Mengenlehre, 1907, in: Mathematische Annalen 65 (1908), 261-281; Axiom des Unendlichen p. 266f.\n\n Formal statement \nIn the formal language of the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms, the axiom reads:\n\nIn words, there is a set I (the set which is postulated to be infinite), such that the empty set is in I, and such that whenever any x is a member of I, the set formed by taking the union of x with its singleton {x} is also a member of I. Such a set is sometimes called an inductive set.\n\n Interpretation and consequences \n\nThis axiom is closely related to the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers in set theory, in which the successor of x is defined as x \u222a {x}. If x is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers.  In this encoding, zero is the empty set:\n\n0 = {}.\n\nThe number 1 is the successor of 0:\n\n1 = 0 \u222a {0} = {} \u222a {0} = {0}.\n\nLikewise, 2 is the successor of 1:\n\n2 = 1 \u222a {1} = {0} \u222a {1} = {0,1},\n\nand so on. A consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers.\n\nThis construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of all natural numbers. Therefore, its existence is taken as an axiom\u2014the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I.\n\nThus the essence of the axiom is:\n\nThere is a set, I, that includes all the natural numbers.\n\nThe axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del axioms.\n\n Extracting the natural numbers from the infinite set \nThe infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.\n\nTo extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way which does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction\u2014a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says:\n\nOr, even more formally:\n\n Alternative method \nAn alternative method is the following.  Let  be the formula that says `x is inductive'; i.e. .  Informally, what we will do is take the intersection of all inductive sets.  More formally, we wish to prove the existence of a unique set  such that\n\n  (*)\n\nFor existence, we will use the Axiom of Infinity combined with the Axiom schema of specification.  Let  be an inductive set guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity.  Then we use the Axiom Schema of Specification to define our set  - i.e.  is the set of all elements of  which happen also to be elements of every other inductive set.  This clearly satisfies the hypothesis of (*), since if , then  is in every inductive set, and if  is in every inductive set, it is in particular in , so it must also be in .\n\nFor uniqueness, first note that any set which satisfies (*) is itself inductive, since 0 is in all inductive sets, and if an element  is in all inductive sets, then by the inductive property so is its successor.  Thus if there were another set  which satisfied (*) we would have that  since  is inductive, and  since  is inductive.  Thus .  Let  denote this unique element.\n\nThis definition is convenient because the principle of induction immediately follows:  If  is inductive, then also , so that .\n\nBoth these methods produce systems which satisfy the axioms of second-order arithmetic, since the axiom of power set allows us to quantify over the power set of , as in second-order logic.  Thus they both completely determine isomorphic systems, and since they are isomorphic under the identity map, they must in fact be equal.\n\n An apparently weaker version \nSome old texts use an apparently weaker version of the axiom of infinity, to wit\n\nThis says that there is an element in x and for every element y of x there is another element of x which is a strict superset of y. This implies that x is an infinite set without saying much about its structure. However, with the help of the other axioms of ZF, we can show that this implies the existence of \u03c9. First, if we take the powerset of any infinite set x, then that powerset will contain elements which are subsets of x of every finite cardinality (among other subsets of x). Proving the existence of those finite subsets may require either the axiom of separation or the axioms of pairing and union. Then we can apply the axiom of replacement to replace each element of that powerset of x by the initial ordinal number of the same cardinality (or zero, if there is no such ordinal). The result will be an infinite set of ordinals. Then we can apply the axiom of union to that to get an ordinal greater than or equal to \u03c9.\n\n Independence \nThe axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if these other axioms are consistent. Nor can it be refuted, if all of ZFC is consistent.\n\nIndeed, using the Von Neumann universe, we can make a model of the axioms where the axiom of infinity is replaced by its negation. It is , the class of hereditarily finite sets, with the inherited element relation. If allowed, the empty domain also satisfies the axioms of this modified theory, as all of them are universally quantified, and thus trivially satisfied if no set exists.\n\nThe cardinality of the set of natural numbers, aleph null (), has many of the properties of a large cardinal. Thus the axiom of infinity is sometimes regarded as the first large cardinal axiom, and conversely large cardinal axioms are sometimes called stronger axioms of infinity.\n\n See also \n Peano axioms\n Finitism\n\n References \n\n Paul Halmos (1960) Naive Set Theory.

His work focuses on the formal relations between electronic sounds and images, using synthesized visual and audio signals as his main medium. Throughout his career he has worked extensively with Sandin Image Processor, and his work has been featured in two Whitney Biennale exhibitions as well as institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the New York Public library and the Art Institute of Chicago.DORIN, LISA. \"\u2018HERE TO STAY\u2019: COLLECTING FILM, VIDEO, AND NEW MEDIA AT THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO.\" Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, vol. 35, no. 1, 2009, pp. 6\u2013110.

Project MUSE,\nHe is also the author of the \"Memory for Music\" chapter in the 2009 and 2016 editions of the Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology.\n\n Early life \nSnyder was born in 1946, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Between 1962 and 1965 he attended the Interlochen Arts Academy boarding high school where he played bass clarinet in the touring orchestra. After graduating, Snyder studied composition and improvisation under the guidance of Bill Mathieu and Marjorie Hyams. Interested in both painting and music, Snyder pursued formal education in composition at Indiana University's Bachelor of Music program, enrolling in 1966. He later transferred to Roosevelt University where he completed his BM in 1970. He received his Master of Music from Roosevelt in 1972. During his studies he became interested in electronic music and began using an oscilloscope to explore the relation between audio and visual signals.\n\nElectronic visualization events\nShortly after graduating, Snyder enrolled into Dan Sandin's video art class at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where he was introduced to and began working with Sandin's Image Processor (IP). He later joined the Circle Graphics Habitat (today Electronic Visualization Laboratory), an interdisciplinary research group developed by Sandin and Tom DeFanti between 1973-75 that centered around the IP and DeFanti's Graphic Symbiosis System (GRASS). While working with Sandin and DeFanti, Snyder met Phil Morton who at that time was teaching at the School of the Art Institute (SAIC) in Chicago. Snyder joined SAIC's faculty in 1974 and in 1976 became the head of the Sound Area, later expanded into School of the Art Institute's Sound Department.\n\nTogether with the community of electronic media artists including Phil Morton, Dan Sandin, Tom DeFanti, Jane Veeder, Jamie Fenton, Barbara Sykes and others, Snyder participated in the Electronic Visualization Events (EVE) organized by the Circle Graphics Habitat\u2014a series of group shows focusing on experimental media performance and image processing. The first iteration of EVE, held in April 1975, featured a collaborative performance by Snyder-Morton-Sandin-DeFanti called Peano Boogie, an improvised piece for which Snyder provided the soundtrack. The group performed again a year later at the second EVE, showing their interactive work Ryral, for which Snyder used SAIC's EMU sound synthesizer. In the third event, which took place in May 1978, the group, joined by Jane Veeder, Sticks Raboin and Rylin Harris, performed a piece called Spiral 3. During the show Snyder's collaboration with Morton and Guenther Tetz titled Data Bursts in 3 moves was also shown.\n\nIndividual works\nSnyder began recording his own IP experiments on videotape in 1974, eventually assembling his own copy of the machine.  In his individual practice, Snyder focused on exploring video's and sound's shared formal properties. As he has explained in the article \"Video Color Control by Means of an Equal-Tempered\u00a0 Keyboard\" :\n\nMy hope was that both light and sound could be controlled from the same set of formal assumptions, and that I could develop characteristic interval structures which would operate successfully in both areas.\n\nIn Lines of Force,\"Lines of Force.\" Lines of Force | Video Data Bank, www.vdb.org/titles/lines-force.\"Lines of Force, 1979.\" The Art Institute of Chicago, www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/199057. created in 1979 and later featured in the Whitney Biennale's Video Program in 1981, abstract synthesized images are modulated with found-footage, such as video documentation of military tests and various recordings of television broadcast. Edited through a series of match-cuts, the piece follows a logic of a visual pun, juxtaposing shots sharing visual similarities.

{"title": "Bounded quantifier", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_quantifier", "text": "In the study of formal theories in mathematical logic, bounded quantifiers are often included in a formal language in addition to the standard quantifiers \"\u2200\" and \"\u2203\". Bounded quantifiers differ from \"\u2200\" and \"\u2203\" in that bounded quantifiers restrict the range of the quantified variable. The study of bounded quantifiers is motivated by the fact that determining whether a sentence with only bounded quantifiers is true is often not as difficult as determining whether an arbitrary sentence is true.\n\nExamples of bounded quantifiers in the context of real analysis include \"\u2200x>0\", \"\u2203y<0\", and \"\u2200x \u220a \u211d\". Informally \"\u2200x>0\" says \"for all x where x is larger than 0\", \"\u2203y<0\" says \"there exists a y where y is less than 0\" and  \"\u2200x \u220a \u211d\" says \"for all x where x is a real number\". For example,  says \"every positive number is the square of a negative number\".\n\n Bounded quantifiers in arithmetic \n\nSuppose that L is the language of Peano arithmetic (the language of second-order arithmetic or arithmetic in all finite types would work as well).  There are two types of bounded quantifiers:  and .\nThese quantifiers bind the number variable n and contain a numeric term t which may not mention n but which may have other free variables. (\"Numeric terms\" here means terms such as \"1 + 1\", \"2\", \"2 \u00d7 3\", \"m + 3\", etc.)\n\nThese quantifiers are defined by the following rules ( denotes formulas):\n\nThere are several motivations for these quantifiers.\n In applications of the language to recursion theory, such as the arithmetical hierarchy, bounded quantifiers add no complexity.  If  is a decidable predicate then  and  are decidable as well.\n In applications to the study of Peano arithmetic, the fact that a particular set can be defined with only bounded quantifiers can have consequences for the computability of the set. For example, there is a definition of primality using only bounded quantifiers: a number n is prime if and only if there are not two numbers strictly less than n whose product is n.  There is no quantifier-free definition of primality in the language , however. The fact that there is a bounded quantifier formula defining primality shows that the primality of each number can be computably decided.\n\nIn general, a relation on natural numbers is definable by a bounded formula if and only if it is computable in the linear-time hierarchy, which is defined similarly to the polynomial hierarchy, but with linear time bounds instead of polynomial. Consequently, all predicates definable by a bounded formula are Kalm\u00e1r elementary, context-sensitive, and primitive recursive.\n\nIn the arithmetical hierarchy, an arithmetical formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called , , and . The superscript 0 is sometimes omitted.\n\n Bounded quantifiers in set theory \nSuppose that L is the language  of the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, where the ellipsis may be replaced by term-forming operations such as a symbol for the powerset operation.  There are two bounded quantifiers:  and .  These quantifiers bind the set variable x and contain a term t which may not mention x but which may have other free variables.\n\nThe semantics of these quantifiers is determined by the following rules:\n\nA ZF formula which contains only bounded quantifiers is called , , and . This forms the basis of the L\u00e9vy hierarchy, which is defined analogously with the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\nBounded quantifiers are important in Kripke\u2013Platek set theory and constructive set theory, where only \u03940 separation is included. That is, it includes separation for formulas with only bounded quantifiers, but not separation for other formulas. In KP the motivation is the fact that whether a set x satisfies a bounded quantifier formula only depends on the collection of sets that are close in rank to x (as the powerset operation can only be applied finitely many times to form a term). In constructive set theory, it is motivated on predicative grounds.\n\n See also \n Subtyping \u2014 bounded quantification in type theory\n System F<: \u2014 a polymorphic typed lambda calculus with bounded quantification\n\n References \n \n \n\nCategory:Quantification\nCategory:Proof theory\nCategory:Computability theory"}

{"title": "Chaitin's constant", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaitin%27s_constant", "text": "In the computer science subfield of algorithmic information theory, a Chaitin constant (Chaitin omega number)mathworld.wolfram.com, Chaitin's Constant. Retrieved 28 May 2012 or halting probability is a real number that, informally speaking, represents the probability that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to Gregory Chaitin.\n\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, one for each method of encoding programs, it is common to use the letter \u03a9 to refer to them as if there were only one.  Because \u03a9 depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called Chaitin's construction instead of Chaitin's constant when not referring to any specific encoding.\n\nEach halting probability is a normal and transcendental real number that is not computable, which means that there is no algorithm to compute its digits. Indeed, each halting probability is Martin-L\u00f6f random, meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\n\n Background \nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a prefix-free universal computable function.  Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\n\nSuppose that F is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function F is called computable if there is a Turing machine that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary strings x and y,  F(x) = y if and only if the Turing machine halts with y on its tape when given the input x).\n\nThe function F is called universal if the following property holds:  for every computable function f of a single variable there is a string w such that for all x, F(w\u00a0x) = f(x); here w\u00a0x represents the concatenation of the two strings w and x.  This means that F can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable.  Informally, w represents a \"script\" for the computable function f, and F represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\n\nThe domain of F is the set of all inputs p on which it is defined. For F that are universal, such a p can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, and as a single program for the function F.\n\nThe function F is called prefix-free if there are no two elements p, p\u2032 in its domain such that p\u2032 is a proper extension of p. This can be rephrased as: the domain of F is a prefix-free code (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\n\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a computably enumerable set but never a computable set.  The domain is always Turing equivalent to the halting problem.\n\n Definition \nLet PF be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function F.  The constant \u03a9F is then defined as\n,\nwhere  denotes the length of a string p. This is an infinite sum which has one summand for every p in the domain of F.  The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with Kraft's inequality, ensures that this sum converges to a real number between 0 and 1.  If F is clear from context then \u03a9F may be denoted simply \u03a9, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of \u03a9.\n\n Relationship to the halting problem \nKnowing the first N bits of \u03a9, one could calculate the halting problem for all programs of a size up to N. Let the program p for which the halting problem is to be solved be N bits long. In dovetailing fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first N bits. If the program p hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first N bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for p.\n\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as Goldbach's conjecture, are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an oracle machine for the halting problem would be.\n\n Interpretation as a probability \nThe Cantor space is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the measure of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual probability measure on Cantor space.  It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\n\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string x the set of sequences that begin with x has measure 2\u2212|x|. This implies that for each natural number n, the set of sequences f in Cantor space such that f(n) = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose nth element is 0 also has measure 1/2.\n\nLet F be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain P of F consists of an infinite set of binary strings\n.\nEach of these strings pi determines a subset Si of Cantor space; the set Si contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with pi. These sets are disjoint because P is a prefix-free set.  The sum\n\nrepresents the measure of the set \n.\n\nIn this way, \u03a9F represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of F. It is for this reason that \u03a9F is called a halting probability.\n\n Properties \nEach Chaitin constant \u03a9 has the following properties:\n\n It is algorithmically random (also known as Martin-L\u00f6f random or 1-random).Downey/Hirschfeld, Theorem 6.1.3 This means that the shortest program to output the first n bits of \u03a9 must be of size at least n-O(1). This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those n bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most n.\n As a consequence, it is a normal number, which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.\n It is not a computable number; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below.\n The set of rational numbers q such that q < \u03a9 is computably enumerable;Downey/Hirschfeld, Theorem 5.1.11 a real number with such a property is called a left-c.e. real number in recursion theory.\n The set of rational numbers q such that q > \u03a9 is not computably enumerable. (Reason: every left-c.e. real with this property is computable, which \u03a9 isn't.)\n \u03a9 is an arithmetical number.\n It is Turing equivalent to the halting problem and thus at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.\n\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability.  A finer equivalence relation, Solovay equivalence, can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals.Downey/Hirschfeldt, p.405 One can show that a real number in [0,1] is a Chaitin constant (i.e. the halting probability of some prefix-free universal computable function) if and only if it is left-c.e. and algorithmically random. \u03a9 is among the few definable algorithmically random numbers and is the best-known algorithmically random number, but it is not at all typical of all algorithmically random numbers.Downey/Hirschfeld, p.228-229\n\n Uncomputability \nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given n, returns the first n digits of the number.  This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\n\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first n digits of \u03a9, solves Turing's halting problem for programs of length up to n. Since the halting problem is undecidable, \u03a9 cannot be computed.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows.  Given the first n digits of \u03a9 and a k \u2264 n, the algorithm enumerates the domain of F until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2\u2212(k+1) of \u03a9. After this point, no additional program of length k can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2\u2212k to the measure, which is impossible.  Thus the set of strings of length k in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\n\n Algorithmic randomness \nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an algorithmically random sequence. \nCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showedCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang: Recursively enumerable reals and Chaitin's \u03a9 numbers. Theoretical Computer Science 255:125\u2013149, (2001) http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/TCS01.pdf \nthat a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence if and only if it is a Chaitin's \u03a9 number.\n\n Incompleteness theorem for halting probabilities \n\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented axiomatic system for the natural numbers, such as Peano arithmetic, there exists a constant N such that no bit of \u03a9 after the Nth can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant N depends on how the formal system is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\n\n Super Omega \nAs mentioned above, the first n bits of Gregory Chaitin's constant \u03a9 are random or incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of \u03a9. In other words, the enumerable first n bits of \u03a9 are highly compressible in the sense that they are limit-computable by a very short algorithm; they are not random with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber (2000) constructed a limit-computable \"Super \u03a9\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable \u03a9, as one cannot significantly compress the Super \u03a9 by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\n\nFor an alternative \"Super \u03a9\", the universality probability of a prefix-free Universal Turing Machine (UTM) namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem (i.e., using Turing Jump notation).\n\n See also \n Incompleteness theorem\n Kolmogorov complexity\n\n References \n\n Cristian S.

In 1883 he published a dissertation on quadrics in projective space and was named as assistant to professors in algebra and analytic geometry. In 1885 he also assisted in descriptive geometry. He began to instruct in projective geometry, as stand-in for Giuseppe Bruno, from 1885 to 1888. Then for 36 years he had the chair in higher geometry following D'Ovidio. Segre and Giuseppe Peano made Turin known in geometry, and their complementary instruction has been noted as follows:Maurizio Avellone, Aldo Brigaglia & Carmela Zappulla (2002) \"The Foundations of Projective Geometry in Italy from De Paolis to Pieri\", Archive for History of Exact Sciences 56:363\u2013425, esp 378\n\nThe Erlangen program of Felix Klein appealed early on to Segre, and he became a promulgator. First, in 1885 he published an article on conics in the plane where he demonstrated how group theory facilitated the study. As Hawkins says (page 252) \"the totality of all conics in the plane is identified with P5(C)\". The group of its projectivities is then the group that permutes conics. About Segre, Hawkins writesThomas Hawkins (2000) Emergence of the Theory of Lie Groups: an essay in the history of mathematics, 1869\u00a0\u2013 1926, Springer \n\nThe inspiring Geometrie der Lage (1847) of Karl Georg Christian von Staudt provided Segre with another project. He encouraged Mario Pieri to make a translation, Geometria di Posizione (1889), while Segre composed a biographical sketch of von Staudt that was included in the publication.\n\nSegre also expanded algebraic geometry by consideration of multicomplex numbers, in particular the bicomplex numbers. Segre's 1892 contribution to Mathematische Annalen shows him extending the work of William Rowan Hamilton and William Kingdon Clifford on biquaternions. But Segre was unaware of earlier study of tessarines that had anticipated his bicomplex numbers.\n\nIn English, the best known work of Segre is an inspirational essay meant for Italian students, translated by J.W. Young in 1904.Corrado Segre (1904) \"On some tendencies in geometric investigations\", translated by J. W. Young, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 10(9):442\u201368. It provides guidance and encouragement to young people studying mathematics.\n\nIn a 1926 memorial article, H.F. Baker called Segre the \"father of\" the Italian school of algebraic geometry.\n\nThe 1912 article \"Higher-dimensional Space\" (Mehr-dimensional RaumeCorrado Segre (1912) Mehrdimensionale R\u00e4ume, Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften, weblink to University of G\u00f6ttingen) for Enzyklop\u00e4die der mathematischen Wissenschaften spanned 200 pages.

The cut-elimination theorem states that any judgement that possesses a proof in the sequent calculus making use of the cut rule also possesses a cut-free proof, that is, a proof that does not make use of the cut rule., gives a 5-page proof of the elimination theorem. See also pages 188, 250., gives a very brief proof of the cut-elimination theorem.\n\nThe cut rule\nA sequent is a logical expression relating multiple formulas, in the form , which is to be read as  proves , and (as glossed by Gentzen) should be understood as equivalent to the truth-function \"If ( and  and  \u2026) then ( or  or  \u2026).\"Wilfried Buchholz, Beweistheorie (university lecture notes about cut-elimination, German, 2002-2003) Note that the left-hand side (LHS) is a conjunction (and) and the RHS is a disjunction (or).  \n\nThe LHS may have arbitrarily many or few formulae; when the LHS is empty, the RHS is a tautology.  In LK, the RHS may also have any number of formulae\u2014if it has none, the LHS is a contradiction, whereas in LJ the RHS may only have one formula or none: here we see that allowing more than one formula in the RHS is equivalent, in the presence of the right contraction rule, to the admissibility of the law of the excluded middle.  However, the sequent calculus is a fairly expressive framework, and there have been sequent calculi for intuitionistic logic proposed that allow many formulae in the RHS. From Jean-Yves Girard's logic LC it is easy to obtain a rather natural formalisation of classical logic where the RHS contains at most one formula; it is the interplay of the logical and structural rules that is the key here.\n\n\"Cut\" is a rule in the normal statement of the sequent calculus, and equivalent to a variety of rules in other proof theories, which, given\n\nand \n\nallows one to infer\n\nThat is, it \"cuts\" the occurrences of the formula  out of the inferential relation. \nCut elimination\nThe cut-elimination theorem states that (for a given system) any sequent provable using the rule Cut can be proved without use of this rule.\n\nFor sequent calculi that have only one formula in the RHS, the \"Cut\" rule reads, given\n\nand \n\nallows one to infer\n\nIf we think of  as a theorem, then cut-elimination in this case simply says that a lemma  used to prove this theorem can be inlined. Whenever the theorem's proof mentions lemma , we can substitute the occurrences for the proof of . Consequently, the cut rule is admissible.\n\nConsequences of the theorem\n\nFor systems formulated in the sequent calculus, analytic proofs are those proofs that do not use Cut. Typically such a proof will be longer, of course, and not necessarily trivially so. In his essay \"Don't Eliminate Cut!\" George Boolos demonstrated that there was a derivation that could be completed in a page using cut, but whose analytic proof could not be completed in the lifespan of the universe.\n\nThe theorem has many, rich consequences:\n A system is inconsistent if it admits a proof of the absurd. If the system has a cut elimination theorem, then if it has a proof of the absurd, or of the empty sequent,  it should also have a proof of the absurd (or   the empty sequent), without cuts. It is typically very easy  to check that there are no such proofs. Thus, once a system is shown to have a cut elimination theorem, it is normally immediate that the system is consistent.\n Normally also the system has, at least in first order logic,  the subformula property, an important property in several approaches to proof-theoretic semantics.\n\nCut elimination is one of the most powerful tools for proving interpolation theorems.  The possibility of carrying out proof search based on resolution, the essential insight leading to the Prolog programming language, depends upon the admissibility of Cut in the appropriate system.\n\nFor proof systems based on  higher-order typed lambda calculus through a Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism, cut elimination algorithms correspond to the strong normalization property (every proof term reduces in a finite number of steps into a normal form).\n\n See also \n Deduction theorem\n Gentzen's consistency proof for Peano's axioms\n\nNotes\n\n References \n \n \n \n  Untersuchungen \u00fcber das logische Schlie\u00dfen I \n  Untersuchungen \u00fcber das logische Schlie\u00dfen II\n \n  \n\n External links \n \n \n\nCategory:Theorems in the foundations of mathematics\nCategory:Proof theory"}
{"title": "Definable real number", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definable_real_number", "text": "thumb|200px|The square root of 2 is equal to the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 1 and is therefore a constructible number\n\nInformally, a definable real number is a real number that can be uniquely specified by its description.  The description may be expressed as a construction or as a formula of a formal language. For example, the positive square root of 2, , can be defined as the unique positive solution to the equation , and it can be constructed with a compass and straightedge.\n\nDifferent choices of a formal language or its interpretation can give rise to different notions of definability.  Specific varieties of definable numbers include the  constructible numbers of geometry, the algebraic numbers, and the computable numbers.\n\n Constructible numbers \nOne way of specifying a real number uses geometric techniques. A real number r is a constructible number if there is a method to construct a line segment of length r using a compass and straightedge, beginning with a fixed line segment of length 1.\n\nEach positive integer, and each positive rational number, is constructible. The positive square root of 2 is constructible.  However, the cube root of 2 is not constructible; this is related to the impossibility of doubling the cube.\n\n Algebraic numbers \nthumb|Algebraic numbers on the complex plane colored by degree (red=1, green=2, blue=3, yellow=4)\n\nA real number r is called an algebraic number if there is a polynomial p(x), with only integer coefficients, so that r is a root of p, that is, p(r)=0.  \nEach algebraic number can be defined individually using the order relation on the reals. For example, if a polynomial q(x) has 5 roots, the third one can be defined as the unique r such that q(r) = 0 and such that there are two distinct numbers less than r for which q is zero.\n\nAll rational numbers are algebraic, and all constructible numbers are algebraic.  There are numbers such as the cube root of 2 which are algebraic but not constructible.\n\nThe algebraic numbers form a subfield of the real numbers. This means that 0 and 1 are algebraic numbers and, moreover, if a and b are algebraic numbers, then so are a+b, a\u2212b, ab and, if b is nonzero, a/b.\n\nThe algebraic numbers also have the property, which goes beyond being a subfield of the reals, that for each positive integer n and each algebraic number a, all of the nth roots of a that are real numbers are also algebraic.\n\nThere are only countably many algebraic numbers, but there are uncountably many real numbers, so in the sense of cardinality most real numbers are not algebraic.  This nonconstructive proof that not all real numbers are algebraic was first published by\nGeorg Cantor in his 1874 paper \"On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers\".\n\nNon-algebraic numbers are called transcendental numbers. Specific examples of transcendental numbers include \u03c0 and Euler's number e.\n\n Computable real numbers \nA real number is a computable number if there is an algorithm that, given a natural number n, produces a decimal expansion for the number accurate to n decimal places.  This notion was introduced by Alan Turing in 1936.\n\nThe computable numbers include the algebraic numbers along with many transcendental numbers including \u03c0 and\u00a0e. Like the algebraic numbers, the computable numbers also form a subfield of the real numbers, and the positive computable numbers are closed under taking nth roots for each positive\u00a0n.\n\nNot all real numbers are computable. The entire set of computable numbers is countable, so most reals are not computable. Specific examples of noncomputable real numbers include the limits of Specker sequences, and algorithmically random real numbers such as Chaitin's \u03a9 numbers.\n\n Definability in arithmetic \nAnother notion of definability comes from the formal theories of arithmetic, such as Peano arithmetic. The language of arithmetic has symbols for 0, 1, the successor operation, addition, and multiplication, intended to be interpreted in the usual way over the natural numbers. Because no variables of this language range over the real numbers, a different sort of definability is needed to refer to real numbers. A real number a is definable in the language of arithmetic (or arithmetical) if its Dedekind cut can be defined as a predicate in that language; that is, if there is a first-order formula \u03c6 in the language of arithmetic, with three free variables, such that\n\nHere m, n, and p range over nonnegative integers.\n\nThe second-order language of arithmetic is the same as the first-order language, except that variables and quantifiers are allowed to range over sets of naturals. A real that is second-order definable in the language of arithmetic is called analytical.\n\nEvery computable real number is arithmetical, and the arithmetical numbers form a subfield of the reals, as do the analytical numbers. Every arithmetical number is analytical, but not every analytical number is arithmetical. Because there are only countably many analytical numbers, most real numbers are not analytical, and thus also not arithmetical.\n\nEvery computable number is arithmetical, but not every arithmetical number is computable. For example, the limit of a Specker sequence is an arithmetical number that is not computable.\n\nThe definitions of arithmetical and analytical reals can be stratified into the arithmetical hierarchy and analytical hierarchy. In general, a real is computable if and only if its Dedekind cut is at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy, one of the lowest levels.  Similarly, the reals with arithmetical Dedekind cuts form the lowest level of the analytical hierarchy.\n\n Definability in models of ZFC \nA real number a is first-order definable in the language of set theory, without parameters, if there is a formula \u03c6 in the language of set theory, with one free variable, such that a is the unique real number such that \u03c6(a) holds (see ).  This notion cannot be expressed as a formula in the language of set theory.\n\nAll analytical numbers, and in particular all computable numbers, are definable in the language of set theory. Thus the real numbers definable in the language of set theory include all familiar real numbers such as 0, 1, \u03c0, e, et cetera, along with all algebraic numbers. Assuming that they form a set in the model, the real numbers definable in the language of set theory over a particular model of ZFC form a field. \n \nEach set model M of ZFC set theory that contains uncountably many real numbers must contain real numbers that are not definable within M (without parameters). This follows from the fact that there are only countably many formulas, and so only countably many elements of M can be definable over M.  Thus, if M has uncountably many real numbers, we can prove from \"outside\" M that not every real number of M is definable over M.  \n \nThis argument becomes more problematic if it is applied to class models of ZFC, such as the von Neumann universe . The argument that applies to set models cannot be directly generalized to class models in ZFC because the property \"the real number x is definable over the class model N\" cannot be expressed as a formula of ZFC. Similarly, the question whether the von Neumann universe contains real numbers that it cannot define cannot be expressed as a sentence in the language of ZFC. Moreover, there are countable models of ZFC in which all real numbers, all sets of real numbers, functions on the reals, etc. are definable .\n\n See also \n Berry's paradox\n Constructible universe\n Entscheidungsproblem\n Ordinal definable set\n Tarski's undefinability theorem\n\nReferences\n .\n .\n .\n (and ).

{"title": "Dependence logic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependence_logic", "text": "Dependence logic is a logical formalism, created by Jouko V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen,V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007 which adds dependence atoms to the language of first-order logic. A dependence atom is an expression of the form , where  are terms, and corresponds to the statement that the value of  is functionally dependent on the values of . \n\nDependence logic is a logic of imperfect information, like  branching quantifier logic or independence-friendly logic: in other words, its game theoretic semantics can be obtained from that of first-order logic by restricting the availability of information to the players, thus allowing for non-linearly ordered patterns of dependence and independence between variables. However, dependence logic differs from these logics in that it separates the notions of dependence and independence from the notion of quantification.\n\nSyntax\nThe syntax of dependence logic is an extension of that of first-order logic. For a fixed signature \u03c3 = (Sfunc, Srel, ar), the set of all well-formed dependence logic formulas is defined according to the following rules:\n\nTerms\nTerms in dependence logic are defined precisely as in first-order logic.\n\nAtomic formulas\nThere are three types of atomic formulas in dependence logic: \n A relational atom is an expression of the form  for any n-ary relation  in our signature and for any n-uple of terms ;\n An equality atom is an expression of the form , for any two terms  and ;\n A dependence atom is an expression of the form , for any  and for any n-uple of terms . \n\nNothing else is an atomic formula of dependence logic. \n\nRelational and equality atoms are also called first order atoms.\n\nComplex formulas and sentences\n\nFor a fixed signature \u03c3, the set of all formulas  of dependence logic and their respective sets of free variables  are defined as follows: \n\n Any atomic formula  is a formula, and  is the set of all variables occurring in it; \n If  is a formula, so is  and ;\n If  and  are formulas, so is  and ;\n If  is a formula and  is a variable,  is also a formula and .\n\nNothing is a dependence logic formula unless it can be obtained through a finite number of applications of these four rules.\n\nA formula  such that  is a sentence of dependence logic.\n\nConjunction and universal quantification\nIn the above presentation of the syntax of dependence logic, conjunction and universal quantification are not treated as primitive operators; rather, they are defined in terms of disjunction and negation and existential quantification respectively, by means of De Morgan's Laws. \n\nTherefore,  is taken as a shorthand for , and  is taken as a shorthand for .\n\nSemantics\nThe team semantics for dependence logic is a variant of Wilfrid Hodges' compositional semantics for IF logic.Hodges 1997V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a73.2 There exist equivalent game-theoretic semantics for dependence logic, both in terms of imperfect information games and in terms of perfect information games.\n\nTeams\nLet  be a first-order structure and let  be a finite set of variables. Then a team over  with domain  is a set of assignments over  with domain , that is, a set of functions  from  to .\n\nIt may be helpful to visualize such a team as a database relation with attributes  and with only one data type, corresponding to the domain  of the structure: for example, if the team  consists of four assignments  with domain  then one may represent it as the relation\n\nPositive and negative satisfaction\nTeam semantics can be defined in terms of two relations  and  between structures, teams and formulas. \n\nGiven a structure , a team  over it and a dependence logic formula  whose free variables are contained in the domain of , if  we say that  is a trump for  in , and we write that ; and analogously, if  we say that  is a cotrump for  in , and we write that .\n\nIf  one can also say that  is positively satisfied by  in , and if instead  one can say that  is negatively satisfied by  in .\n\nThe necessity of considering positive and negative satisfaction separately is a consequence of the fact that in dependence logic, as in the logic of branching quantifiers or in IF logic, the law of the excluded middle does not hold; alternatively, one may assume that all formulas are in negation normal form, using De Morgan's relations in order to define universal quantification and conjunction from existential quantification and disjunction respectively, and consider positive satisfaction alone. \n\nGiven a sentence , we say that  is true in  if and only if , and we say that  is false in  if and only if .\n\nSemantic rules\nAs for the case of Alfred Tarski's satisfiability relation for first-order formulas, the positive and negative satisfiability relations of the team semantics for dependence logic are defined by structural induction over the formulas of the language. Since the negation operator interchanges positive and negative satisfiability, the two inductions corresponding to  and  need to be performed simultaneously:\n\nPositive satisfiability\n  if and only if \n  is a n-ary symbol in the signature of ;\n All variables occurring in the terms  are in the domain of ;\n For every assignment ,  the evaluation of the tuple  according to  is in the interpretation of  in ;\n  if and only if \n All variables occurring in the terms  and  are in the domain of ;\n For every assignment ,  the evaluations of  and  according to  are the same;\n  if and only if any two assignments  whose evaluations of the tuple  coincide assign the same value to ;\n  if and only if ;\n  if and only if there exist teams  and  such that \n '\n ;\n ; \n  if and only if there exists a function  from  to the domain of  such that , where .\n\nNegative satisfiability\n  if and only if \n  is a n-ary symbol in the signature of ;\n All variables occurring in the terms  are in the domain of ;\n For every assignment ,  the evaluation of the tuple  according to  is not in the interpretation of  in ;\n  if and only if \n All variables occurring in the terms  and  are in the domain of ;\n For every assignment ,  the evaluations of  and  according to  are different;\n  if and only if  is the empty team;\n  if and only if ;\n  if and only if  and ; \n  if and only if , where  and  is the domain of .\n\nDependence logic and other logics\n\nDependence logic and first-order logic\nDependence logic is a conservative extension of first-order logic:V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a73.2 in other words, for every first order sentence  and structure  we have that  if and only if  is true in  according to the usual first order semantics. Furthermore, for any first order formula ,  if and only if all assignments  satisfy  in  according to the usual first order semantics.\n\nHowever, dependence logic is strictly more expressive than first order logic:V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a74 for example, the sentence \n \nis true in a model  if and only if the domain of this model is infinite, even though no first order formula  has this property.\n\nDependence logic and second-order logic\nEvery dependence logic sentence is equivalent to some sentence in the existential fragment of second-order logic,V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a76.1 that is, to some second-order sentence of the form \n\nwhere  does not contain second-order quantifiers. \nConversely, every second-order sentence in the above form is equivalent to some dependence logic sentence.V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a76.3\n\nAs for open formulas, dependence logic corresponds to the downwards monotone fragment of existential second-order logic, in the sense that a nonempty class of teams is definable by a dependence logic formula if and only if the corresponding class of relations is downwards monotone and definable by an existential second-order formula.Kontinen and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2009\n\nDependence logic and branching quantifiers\nBranching quantifiers are expressible in terms of dependence atoms: for example, the expression\n \nis equivalent to the dependence logic sentence , in the sense that the former expression is true in a model if and only if the latter expression is true.  \n\nConversely, any dependence logic sentence is equivalent to some sentence in the logic of branching quantifiers, since all existential second-order sentences are expressible in branching quantifier logic.Enderton 1970Walkoe 1970\n\nDependence logic and IF logic\nAny dependence logic sentence is logically equivalent to some IF logic sentence, and vice versa.V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a73.6 \n\nHowever, the issue is subtler when it comes to open formulas. Translations between IF logic and dependence logic formulas, and vice versa, exist as long as the domain of the team is fixed: in other words, for all sets of variables  and all IF logic formulas  with free variables in  there exists a dependence logic formula  such that \n\nfor all structures  and for all teams  with domain , and conversely, for every dependence logic formula  with free variables in  there exists an IF logic formula  such that \n\nfor all structures  and for all teams  with domain . These translations cannot be compositional.Kontinen and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2009 bis\n\nProperties\nDependence logic formulas are downwards closed: if  and  then . Furthermore, the empty team (but not the team containing the empty assignment) satisfies all formulas of Dependence Logic, both positively and negatively. \n\nThe law of the excluded middle fails in dependence logic: for example, the formula  is neither positively nor negatively satisfied by the team . Furthermore, disjunction is not idempotent and does not distribute over conjunction.V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a73  \n\nBoth the compactness theorem and the L\u00f6wenheim-Skolem theorem are true for dependence logic. Craig's interpolation theorem also holds, but, due to the nature of negation in dependence logic, in a slightly modified formulation: if two dependence logic formulas  and  are contradictory, that is, it is never the case that both  and  hold in the same model, then there exists a first order sentence  in the common language of the two sentences such that  implies  and  is contradictory with .V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a76.2 \n\nAs IF logic,Hintikka 2002 Dependence logic can define its own truth operator:V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a76.4 more precisely, there exists a formula  such that for every sentence  of dependence logic and all models  which satisfy Peano's axioms, if  is the G\u00f6del number of  then \n  if and only if \n\nThis does not contradict Tarski's undefinability theorem, since the negation of dependence logic is not the usual contradictory one.\n\nComplexity\nAs a consequence of Fagin's theorem, the properties of finite structures definable in \ndependence logic correspond exactly to NP properties. Furthermore, Durand and Kontinen showed that restricting the number of universal quantifiers or the arity of dependence atoms in \nsentences gives rise to hierarchy theorems with respect to expressive power.Durand and Kontinen\n\nThe inconsistency problem of dependence logic is semidecidable, and in fact equivalent to the inconsistency problem for first-order logic. \nHowever, the decision problem for dependence logic is non-arithmetical, and is in fact complete with respect to the   class of the Levy hierarchy.V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a77\n\nVariants and extensions\n\nTeam logic\nTeam logicV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2007, \u00a78  extends dependence logic with a contradictory negation . Its expressive power is equivalent to that of full second-order logic.Kontinen and Nurmi 2009\n\nModal dependence logic\nThe dependence atom, or a suitable variant thereof, can be added to the language of modal logic, thus obtaining modal dependence logic.Sevenster 2009V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2008Lohmann and Vollmer 2010\n\nIntuitionistic dependence logic\nAs it is, dependence logic lacks an implication. The intuitionistic implication , whose name derives from the similarity between its definition and that of the implication of intuitionistic logic, can be defined as follows:Abramsky and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2009\n  if and only if for all  such that  it holds that .\n\nIntuitionistic dependence logic, that is, dependence logic supplemented with the intuitionistic implication, is equivalent to second-order logic.Yang 2010\n\nIndependence logic\nInstead of dependence atoms, independence logic adds to the language of first-order logic independence atoms  where ,  and  are tuples of terms. The semantics of these atoms is defined as follows:\n  if and only if for all  with  there exists  such that ,  and .\nIndependence logic corresponds to existential second-order logic, in the sense that a non-empty class of teams is definable by an independence logic formula if and only if the corresponding class of relations is definable by an existential second-order formula.Galliani 2012 Therefore, on the level of open formulas, independence logic is strictly stronger in expressive power than dependence logic. However, on the level of sentences these logics are equivalent.Gr\u00e4del and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen\n\nInclusion/exclusion logic\nInclusion/exclusion logic extends first-order logic with inclusion atoms  and exclusion atoms  where in both formulas  and  are term tuples of the same length. The semantics of these atoms is defined as follows:\n\n  if and only if for all  there exists  such that ;\n  if and only if for all  it holds that .\n\nInclusion/exclusion logic has the same expressive power as independence logic, already on the level of open formulas.Galliani 2012 Inclusion logic and exclusion logic are obtained by adding only inclusion atoms or exclusion atoms to first-order logic, respectively. Inclusion logic sentences correspond in expressive power to greatest fixed-point logic sentences; hence inclusion logic captures (least) fixed-point logic on finite models, and PTIME over finite ordered models.Galliani and Hella 2013 Exclusion logic in turn corresponds to dependence logic in expressive power.Galliani 2012\nGeneralized quantifiers\nAnother way of extending dependence logic is to add some generalized quantifiers to the language of dependence logic. Very recently there has been some study of dependence logic with monotone generalized quantifiersEngstr\u00f6m and dependence logic with a certain majority quantifier, the latter leading to a new descriptive complexity characterization of the counting hierarchy.Durand, Ebbing, Kontinen, Vollmer 2011\n\n See also \n Game semantics\n Branching quantifier\n Independence-friendly logic\n\n Notes \n\n References \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n External links \n\n Special issue of Studia Logica on \"Dependence and Independence in Logic\", containing a number of articles on Dependence Logic\n Presentations in Academy Colloquium Dependence Logic, Amsterdam, 2014\nCategory:Systems of formal logic"}
{"title": "Dialectica interpretation", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectica_interpretation", "text": "In proof theory, the Dialectica interpretation is a proof interpretation of intuitionistic arithmetic (Heyting arithmetic) into a finite type extension of primitive recursive arithmetic, the so-called System T.  It was developed by Kurt G\u00f6del to provide a consistency proof of arithmetic. The name of the interpretation comes from the journal Dialectica, where G\u00f6del's paper was published in a 1958 special issue dedicated to Paul Bernays on his 70th birthday.\n\n Motivation \nVia the G\u00f6del\u2013Gentzen negative translation, the consistency of classical Peano arithmetic had already been reduced to the consistency of intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic. G\u00f6del's motivation for developing the dialectica interpretation was to obtain a relative consistency proof for Heyting arithmetic (and hence for Peano arithmetic).\n\n Dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic logic  \nThe interpretation has two components: a formula translation and a proof translation. The formula translation describes how each formula  of Heyting arithmetic is mapped to a quantifier-free formula  of the system T, where  and  are tuples of fresh variables (not appearing free in ). Intuitively,  is interpreted as . The proof translation shows how a proof of  has enough information to witness the interpretation of , i.e. the proof of  can be converted into a closed term  and a proof of  in the system T.\n\n Formula translation \nThe quantifier-free formula  is defined inductively on the logical structure of  as follows, where  is an atomic formula:\n\n \n\n Proof translation (soundness) \nThe formula interpretation is such that whenever  is provable in Heyting arithmetic then there exists a sequence of closed terms  such that  is provable in the system T. The sequence of terms  and the proof of  are constructed from the given proof of  in Heyting arithmetic. The construction of  is quite straightforward, except for the contraction axiom  which requires the assumption that quantifier-free formulas are decidable.\n\n Characterisation principles \nIt has also been shown that Heyting arithmetic extended with the following principles\n\n Axiom of choice\n Markov's principle\n Independence of premise for universal formulas\n\nis necessary and sufficient for characterising the formulas of HA which are interpretable by the Dialectica interpretation.\n\n Extensions of basic interpretation \nThe basic dialectica interpretation of intuitionistic logic has been extended to various stronger systems. Intuitively, the dialectica interpretation can be applied to a stronger system, as long as the dialectica interpretation of the extra principle can be witnessed by terms in the system T (or an extension of system T).\n\n Induction \nGiven G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem (which implies that the consistency of PA cannot be proven by finitistic means) it is reasonable to expect that system T must contain non-finitistic constructions. Indeed this is the case. The non-finitistic constructions show up in the interpretation of mathematical induction. To give a Dialectica interpretation of induction, G\u00f6del makes use of what is nowadays called G\u00f6del's primitive recursive functionals, which are higher order functions with primitive recursive descriptions.\n\n Classical logic \nFormulas and proofs in classical arithmetic can also be given a Dialectica interpretation via an initial embedding into Heyting arithmetic followed by the Dialectica interpretation of Heyting arithmetic.

{"title": "Elementary proof", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_proof", "text": "In mathematics, an elementary proof is a mathematical proof that only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in number theory to refer to proofs that make no use of complex analysis. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the prime number theorem, could only be proved using \"higher\" mathematics.  However, over time, many of these results have been reproven using only elementary techniques.\n\nWhile the meaning has not always been defined precisely, the term is commonly used in mathematical jargon. An elementary proof is not necessarily simple, in the sense of being easy to understand: some elementary proofs can be quite complicated..\n\nPrime number theorem\nThe distinction between elementary and non-elementary proofs has been considered especially important in regard to the prime number theorem. This theorem was first proved in 1896 by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin using complex analysis. Many mathematicians then attempted to construct elementary proofs of the theorem, without success. G. H. Hardy expressed strong reservations; he considered that the essential \"depth\" of the result ruled out elementary proofs:\n\nHowever, in 1948, Atle Selberg produced new methods which led him and Paul Erd\u0151s to find elementary proofs of the prime number theorem. \n\nA possible formalization of the notion of \"elementary\" in connection to a proof of a number-theoretical result is the restriction that the proof can be carried out in Peano arithmetic. Also in that sense, these proofs are elementary.\n\nFriedman's conjecture\n\nHarvey Friedman conjectured, \"Every theorem published in the Annals of Mathematics whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e., what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in elementary arithmetic.\". The form of elementary arithmetic referred to in this conjecture can be formalized by a small set of axioms concerning integer arithmetic and mathematical induction. For instance, according to this conjecture, Fermat's Last Theorem should have an elementary proof; Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is not elementary. However, there are other simple statements about arithmetic such as the existence of iterated exponential functions that cannot be proven in this theory.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Elementary mathematics\nCategory:Mathematical proofs"}

AMS Chelsea Publishing, Providence, Rhode Island, USA, \n 1950 The problem asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic (possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers \"Yes\" or \"No\" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms. By the completeness theorem of first-order logic, a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the  can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the rules of logic.\n\nIn 1936, Alonzo Church and Alan Turing published independent papersChurch's paper was presented to the American Mathematical Society on 19 April 1935 and published on 15 April 1936. Turing, who had made substantial progress in writing up his own results, was disappointed to learn of Church's proof upon its publication (see correspondence between Max Newman and Church in Alonzo Church papers ). Turing quickly completed his paper and rushed it to publication; it was received by the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society on 28 May 1936, read on 12 November 1936, and published in series 2, volume 42 (1936\u20137); it appeared in two sections: in Part 3 (pages 230\u2013240), issued on Nov 30, 1936 and in Part 4 (pages 241\u2013265), issued on Dec 23, 1936; Turing added corrections in volume 43 (1937), pp. 544\u2013546.

This assumption is now known as the Church\u2013Turing thesis.\n\n History of the problem \nThe origin of the  goes back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine, dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements.Davis 2000: pp.\u00a03\u201320  He realized that the first step would have to be a clean formal language, and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal.  In 1928, David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann posed the question in the form outlined above.\n\nIn continuation of his \"program\", Hilbert posed three questions at an international conference in 1928,  the third of which became known as \"Hilbert's .\"Hodges p.\u00a091 In 1929, Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel published one paper on special cases of the decision problem, that was prepared by Paul Bernays.\n\nAs late as 1930, Hilbert believed that there would be no such thing as an unsolvable problem.Hodges p.\u00a092, quoting from Hilbert\n\n Negative answer \nBefore the question could be answered, the notion of \"algorithm\" had to be formally defined.  This was done by Alonzo Church in 1936 with the concept of \"effective calculability\" based on his \u03bb-calculus and by Alan Turing in the same year with his concept of Turing machines.  Turing  immediately recognized that these are equivalent models of computation.\n\nThe negative answer to the  was then given by Alonzo Church in 1935\u201336 and independently shortly thereafter by Alan Turing in 1936.  Church proved that there is no computable function which decides for two given \u03bb-calculus expressions whether they are equivalent or not. He relied heavily on earlier work by Stephen Kleene. Turing reduced the question of the existence of a 'general method' which decides whether any given Turing Machine halts or not (the halting problem) to the question of the existence of an 'algorithm' or 'general method' able to solve the . If 'Algorithm' is understood as being equivalent to a Turing Machine, and with the answer to the latter question negative (in general), the question about the existence of an Algorithm for the  also must be negative (in general). In his 1936 paper, Turing says: \"Corresponding to each computing machine 'it' we construct a  formula 'Un(it)' and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether 'Un(it)' is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether 'it' ever prints 0\".\n\nThe work of both Church and Turing was heavily influenced by Kurt G\u00f6del's earlier work on his incompleteness theorem, especially by the method of assigning numbers (a G\u00f6del numbering) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.\n\nThe  is related to Hilbert's tenth problem, which asks for an algorithm to decide whether Diophantine equations have a solution.  The non-existence of such an algorithm, established by Yuri Matiyasevich in 1970, also implies a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem.\n\nSome first-order theories are algorithmically decidable; examples of this include Presburger arithmetic, real closed fields and static type systems of many programming languages. The general first-order theory of the natural numbers expressed in Peano's axioms cannot be decided with an algorithm, however.\n\nPractical decision procedures\nHaving practical decision procedures for classes of logical formulas is of considerable interest for program verification and circuit verification. Pure Boolean logical formulas are usually decided using SAT-solving techniques based on the DPLL algorithm. Conjunctive formulas over linear real or rational arithmetic can be decided using the simplex algorithm, formulas in linear integer arithmetic (Presburger arithmetic) can be decided using Cooper's algorithm or William Pugh's Omega test. Formulas with negations, conjunctions and disjunctions combine the difficulties of satisfiability testing with that of decision of conjunctions; they are generally decided nowadays using SMT-solving techniques, which combine SAT-solving with decision procedures for conjunctions and propagation techniques. Real polynomial arithmetic, also known as the theory of real closed fields, is decidable; this is the Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem, which has been implemented in computers by using the cylindrical algebraic decomposition.\n\n See also \n Automated theorem proving\n Hilbert's second problem\n Oracle machine\n Turing's proof\n\n Notes \n\n References \n David Hilbert and Wilhelm Ackermann (1928).

{"title": "Equiconsistency", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equiconsistency", "text": "In mathematical logic, two theories are equiconsistent if the consistency of one theory implies the consistency of the other theory, and vice versa.  In this case, they are, roughly speaking, \"as consistent as each other\".\n\nIn general, it is not possible to prove the absolute consistency of a theory T.  Instead we usually take a theory S, believed to be consistent, and try to prove the weaker statement that if S is consistent then T must also be consistent\u2014if we can do this we say that T is consistent relative to S.  If S is also consistent relative to T then we say that S and T are equiconsistent.\n\n Consistency \n\nIn mathematical logic, formal theories are studied as mathematical objects. Since some theories are powerful enough to model different mathematical objects, it is natural to wonder about their own consistency.\n\nHilbert proposed a program at the beginning of the 20th century whose ultimate goal was to show, using mathematical methods, the consistency of mathematics. Since most mathematical disciplines can be reduced to arithmetic, the program quickly became the establishment of the consistency of arithmetic by methods formalizable within arithmetic itself. \n\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems show that Hilbert's program cannot be realized: if a consistent recursively enumerable theory is strong enough to formalize its own metamathematics (whether something is a proof or not), i.e. strong enough to model a weak fragment of arithmetic (Robinson arithmetic suffices), then the theory cannot prove its own consistency. There are some technical caveats as to what requirements the formal statement representing the metamathematical statement \"The theory is consistent\" needs to satisfy, but the outcome is that if a (sufficiently strong) theory can prove its own consistency then either there is no computable way of identifying whether a statement is even an axiom of the theory or not, or else the theory itself is inconsistent (in which case it can prove anything, including false statements such as its own consistency).\n\nGiven this, instead of outright consistency, one usually considers relative consistency: Let S and T be formal theories. Assume that S is a consistent theory. Does it follow that T is consistent? If so, then T is consistent relative to S. Two theories are equiconsistent if each one is consistent relative to the other.\n\n Consistency strength \n\nIf T is consistent relative to S, but S is not known to be consistent relative to T, then we say that S has greater consistency strength than T.  When discussing these issues of consistency strength the metatheory in which the discussion takes places needs to be carefully addressed. For theories at the level of second-order arithmetic, the reverse mathematics program has much to say. Consistency strength issues are a usual part of set theory, since this is a recursive theory that can certainly model most of mathematics. The most widely used set of axioms of set theory is called ZFC. When a set-theoretic statement  is said to be equiconsistent to another , what is being claimed is that in the metatheory (Peano Arithmetic in this case) it can be proven that the theories ZFC+ and ZFC+ are equiconsistent. Usually, primitive recursive arithmetic can be adopted as the metatheory in question, but even if the metatheory is ZFC or an extension of it, the notion is meaningful. The method of forcing allows one to show that the theories ZFC, ZFC+CH and ZFC+\u00acCH are all equiconsistent (where CH denotes the continuum hypothesis).\n\nWhen discussing fragments of ZFC or their extensions (for example, ZF, set theory without the axiom of choice, or ZF+AD, set theory with the axiom of determinacy), the notions described above are adapted accordingly. Thus, ZF is equiconsistent with ZFC, as shown by G\u00f6del.\n\nThe consistency strength of numerous combinatorial statements can be calibrated by large cardinals.  For example, the negation of Kurepa's hypothesis is equiconsistent with an inaccessible cardinal, the non-existence of special -Aronszajn trees is equiconsistent with a Mahlo cardinal, and the non-existence of -Aronszajn trees is equiconsistent with a weakly compact cardinal.*\n\nSee also\nLarge cardinal property\n\nReferences\n\n Akihiro Kanamori (2003).

{"title": "Fitch's paradox of knowability", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitch%27s_paradox_of_knowability", "text": "Fitch's paradox of knowability is one of the fundamental puzzles of epistemic logic. It provides a challenge to the knowability thesis, which states that every truth is, in principle, knowable. The paradox is that this assumption implies the omniscience principle, which asserts that every truth is known. Essentially, Fitch's paradox asserts that the existence of an unknown truth is unknowable. So if all truths were knowable, it would follow that all truths are in fact known.\n\nThe paradox is of concern for verificationist or anti-realist accounts of truth, for which the knowability thesis is very plausible, but the omniscience principle is very implausible.\n\nThe paradox appeared as a minor theorem in a 1963 paper by Frederic Fitch, \"A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts\". Other than the knowability thesis, his proof makes only modest assumptions on the modal nature of knowledge and of possibility. He also generalised the proof to different modalities. It resurfaced in 1979 when W. D. Hart wrote that Fitch's proof was an \"unjustly neglected logical gem\".\n\n Proof \nSuppose p is a sentence that is an unknown truth; that is, the sentence p is true, but it is not known that p is true.  In such a case, the sentence \"the sentence p is an unknown truth\" is true; and, if all truths are knowable, it should be possible to know that \"p is an unknown truth\". But this isn't possible, because as soon as we know \"p is an unknown truth\", we know that p is true, rendering p no longer an unknown truth, so the statement \"p is an unknown truth\" becomes a falsity.  Hence, the statement \"p is an unknown truth\" cannot be both known and true at the same time.  Therefore, if all truths are knowable, the set of \"all truths\" must not include any of the form \"something is an unknown truth\"; thus there must be no unknown truths, and thus all truths must be known.\n\nThis can be formalised with modal logic. K and L will stand for known and possible, respectively. Thus LK means possibly known, in other words, knowable. The modality rules used are:\n\n(A) Kp \u2192 p  \u2013 knowledge implies truth.(B) K(p & q) \u2192 (Kp & Kq)  \u2013 knowing a conjunction implies knowing each conjunct.(C) p \u2192 LKp  \u2013 all truths are knowable.(D) from \u00acp, deduce \u00acLp  \u2013 if p can be proven false without assumptions, then p is impossible (which is similar to the rule of necessitation: if p can be proven true without assumptions, then p is necessarily true).\n\nThe proof proceeds:\n\n1. Suppose K(p & \u00acKp) 2. Kp & K\u00acKp  from line 1 by rule (B)3. Kp  from line 2 by conjunction elimination4. K\u00acKp  from line 2 by conjunction elimination5. \u00acKp  from line 4 by rule (A)6. \u00acK(p & \u00acKp)  from lines 3 and 5 by reductio ad absurdum, discharging assumption 17. \u00acLK(p & \u00acKp)  from line 6 by rule (D)8. Suppose p & \u00acKp 9. LK(p & \u00acKp)  from line 8 by rule (C)10. \u00ac(p & \u00acKp)  from lines 7 and 9 by reductio ad absurdum, discharging assumption 8.11. p \u2192 Kp  from line 10 by a classical tautology\n\nThe last line states that if p is true then it is known. Since nothing else about p was assumed, it means that every truth is known.\n\n Generalisations \nThe proof uses minimal assumptions about the nature of K and L, so other modalities can be substituted for \"known\". Joe Salerno gives the example of \"caused by God\": rule (C) becomes that every true fact could have been caused by God, and the conclusion is that every true fact was caused by God. Rule (A) can also be weakened to include modalities that don't imply truth. For instance instead of \"known\" we could have the doxastic modality \"believed by a rational person\" (represented by B). Rule (A) is replaced with:\n\n(E) Bp \u2192 BBp  \u2013 rational belief is transparent; if p is rationally believed, then it is rationally believed that p is rationally believed.(F) \u00ac(Bp & B\u00acp)  \u2013 rational beliefs are consistent\n\nThis time the proof proceeds:\n\n1. Suppose B(p & \u00acBp) 2. Bp & B\u00acBp  from line 1 by rule (B)3. Bp  from line 2 by conjunction elimination4. BBp  from line 3 by rule (E)5. B\u00acBp  from line 2 by conjunction elimination6. BBp & B\u00acBp  from lines 4 and 5 by conjunction introduction7. \u00ac(BBp & B\u00acBp)  by rule (F)8. \u00acB(p & \u00acBp)  from lines 6 and 7 by reductio ad absurdum, discharging assumption 1\n\nThe last line matches line 6 in the previous proof, and the remainder goes as before. So if any true sentence could possibly be believed by a rational person, then that sentence is believed by one or more rational persons.\n\nSome anti-realists advocate the use of intuitionistic logic; however, except for the very last line, which moves from there are no unknown truths to all truths are known, the proof is, in fact, intuitionistically valid.\n\n The knowability thesis \nRule (C) is generally held to be at fault rather than any of the other logical principles employed. It may be contended that this rule does not faithfully translate the idea that all truths are knowable, and that rule (C) should not apply unrestrictedly. Kvanvig contends that this represents an illicit substitution into a modal context.\n\nG\u00f6del's Theorem proves that in any recursively axiomatized system sufficient to derive mathematics (e.g. Peano Arithmetic), there are statements which are undecidable. In that context, it is difficult to state that \"all truths are knowable\" since some potential truths are uncertain.\n\nHowever, jettisoning the knowability thesis does not necessarily solve the paradox, since one can substitute a weaker version of the knowability thesis called (C').\n (C') \u2203x((x & \u00acKx) & LKx) & LK((x & \u00acKx) & LKx)  \u2013 There is an unknown, but knowable truth, and it is knowable that there is an unknown, but knowable truth.\nThe same argument shows that (C') results in contradiction, indicating that all knowable truths are known; conversely, it states that if a truth is unknown, then it is unknowable.\n\n See also \n Moore's paradox\n\nNotes\n\n References \n Frederick Fitch, \"A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts\".

Cirquent calculus with that semantics can be seen as a logic of resources which, unlike Linear Logic, makes it possible to account for resource-sharing. As such, it has been presented as a viable alternative to linear logic by Japaridze, who repeatedly has criticized the latter for being neither sufficiently expressive nor complete as a resource logic. This challenge, however, has remained largely unnoticed by the linear logic community, which never responded to it.\n\nJaparidze has cast a similar (and also never answered) challenge to intuitionistic logic,G.

The first four iterations of the Koch curve, where after each iteration, all original line segments are replaced with four, each a self-similar copy that is 1/3 the length of the original. One formalism of the Hausdorff dimension uses this scale factor (3) and the number of self-similar objects (4) to calculate the dimension, D, after the first iteration to be D = (log N)/(log S) = (log 4)/(log 3) \u2248 1.26.MacGregor Campbell, 2013, \"5.6 Scaling and the Hausdorff Dimension,\" at Annenberg Learner:MATHematics illuminated, see , accessed 5 March 2015. That is, while the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, of a line segment is 1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3, for fractals such as this, the object can have a non-integer dimension.\n\nIn mathematics, Hausdorff dimension (a.k.a. fractal dimension) is a measure of roughness and/or chaos that was first introduced in 1918 by mathematician Felix Hausdorff. Applying the mathematical formula, the Hausdorff dimension of a single point is zero, of a line segment is 1, of a square is 2, and of a cube is 3. That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners\u2014the shapes of traditional geometry and science\u2014the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the usual sense of dimension, also known as the topological dimension. However, formulas have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, based solely on their properties of scaling and self-similarity, one is led to the conclusion that particular objects\u2014including fractals\u2014have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular or \"rough\" sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the Hausdorff\u2013Besicovitch dimension.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension, more specifically, is a further dimensional number associated with a given set, where the distances between all members of that set are defined. Such a set is termed a metric space. The dimension is drawn from the extended real numbers, , as opposed to the more intuitive notion of dimension, which is not associated to general metric spaces, and only takes values in the non-negative integers.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes the notion of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch snowflake shown at right is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4.Larry Riddle, 2014, \"Classic Iterated Function Systems: Koch Snowflake\", Agnes Scott College e-Academy (online), see , accessed 5 March 2015. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD.Keith Clayton, 1996, \"Fractals and the Fractal Dimension,\" Basic Concepts in Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos (workshop), Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences annual meeting, June 28, 1996, Berkeley, California, see , accessed 5 March 2015. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving\u2014in the Koch and other fractal cases\u2014non-integer dimensions for these objects.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension is a successor to the simpler, but usually equivalent, box-counting or Minkowski\u2013Bouligand dimension.\n\nIntuition\n\nThe intuitive concept of dimension of a geometric object X is the number of independent parameters one needs to pick out a unique point inside. However, any point specified by two parameters can be instead specified by one, because the cardinality of the real plane is equal to the cardinality of the real line (this can be seen by an argument involving interweaving the digits of two numbers to yield a single number encoding the same information). The example of a space-filling curve shows that one can even take one real number into two both surjectively (so all pairs of numbers are covered) and continuously, so that a one-dimensional object completely fills up a higher-dimensional object.\n\nEvery space filling curve hits some points multiple times, and does not have a continuous inverse. It is impossible to map two dimensions onto one in a way that is continuous and continuously invertible. The topological dimension, also called Lebesgue covering dimension, explains why. This dimension is n if, in every covering of X by small open balls, there is at least one point where n\u00a0+\u00a01 balls overlap. For example, when one covers a line with short open intervals, some points must be covered twice, giving dimension\u00a0n\u00a0=\u00a01.\n\nBut topological dimension is a very crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point). A curve that is almost space-filling can still have topological dimension one, even if it fills up most of the area of a region. A fractal has an integer topological dimension, but in terms of the amount of space it takes up, it behaves like a higher-dimensional space.\n\nThe Hausdorff dimension measures the local size of a space taking into account the distance between points, the metric. Consider the number N(r) of balls of radius at most r required to cover X completely. When r is very small, N(r) grows polynomially with 1/r. For a sufficiently well-behaved  X, the Hausdorff dimension is the unique number d such that N(r) grows as 1/rd as r approaches zero. More precisely, this defines the box-counting dimension, which equals the Hausdorff dimension when the value d is a critical boundary between growth rates that are insufficient to cover the space, and growth rates that are overabundant.\n\nFor shapes that are smooth, or shapes with a small number of corners, the shapes of traditional geometry and science, the Hausdorff dimension is an integer agreeing with the topological dimension. But Benoit Mandelbrot observed that fractals, sets with noninteger Hausdorff dimensions, are found everywhere in nature. He observed that the proper idealization of most rough shapes you see around you is not in terms of smooth idealized shapes, but in terms of fractal idealized shapes:\n\nClouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.\n\nFor fractals that occur in nature, the Hausdorff and box-counting dimension coincide. The packing dimension is yet another similar notion which gives the same value for many shapes, but there are well documented exceptions where all these dimensions differ.\n\nFormal definitions\n\nHausdorff content\nLet X be a metric space. If S \u2282 X and d \u2208 [0, \u221e), the d-dimensional Hausdorff content of S is defined by\n\nIn other words,  is the infimum of the set of numbers \u03b4 \u2265 0 such that there is some (indexed) collection of balls  covering S with ri\u00a0>\u00a00 for each i\u00a0\u2208\u00a0I that satisfies . (Here, we use the standard convention that inf\u00a0\u00d8\u00a0=\u00a0\u221e.)\n\nHausdorff dimension\nThe Hausdorff dimension of X is defined by\n\nEquivalently, dimH(X) may be defined as the infimum of the set of d \u2208 [0, \u221e) such that the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure of X is zero. This is the same as the supremum of the set of d\u00a0\u2208\u00a0[0,\u00a0\u221e) such that the d-dimensional Hausdorff measure of X is infinite (except that when this latter set of numbers d is empty the Hausdorff dimension is zero).\n\nExamples\nthumb|250px|Dimension of a further fractal example. The Sierpinski triangle, an object with Hausdorff dimension of log(3)/log(2)\u22481.58.\n Countable sets have Hausdorff dimension 0.\n The Euclidean space \u211dn has Hausdorff dimension n, and the circle S1 has Hausdorff dimension 1.\n Fractals often are spaces whose Hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension. For example, the Cantor set, a zero-dimensional topological space, is a union of two copies of itself, each copy shrunk by a factor 1/3; hence, it can be shown that its Hausdorff dimension is ln(2)/ln(3)\u00a0\u2248\u00a00.63. The Sierpinski triangle is a union of three copies of itself, each copy shrunk by a factor of\u00a01/2; this yields a Hausdorff dimension of ln(3)/ln(2)\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.58. These Hausdorff dimensions are related to the \"critical exponent\" of the Master theorem for solving recurrence relations in the analysis of algorithms.\n Space-filling curves like the Peano curve have the same Hausdorff dimension as the space they fill.\n The trajectory of Brownian motion in dimension 2 and above is conjectured to be Hausdorff dimension 2.\nthumb|250px|Estimating the Hausdorff dimension of the coast of Great Britain\n Lewis Fry Richardson has performed detailed experiments to measure the approximate Hausdorff dimension for various coastlines. His results have varied from 1.02 for the coastline of South Africa to 1.25 for the west coast of Great Britain.\n\nProperties of Hausdorff dimension\n\n Hausdorff dimension and inductive dimension \nLet X be an arbitrary separable metric space. There is a topological notion of inductive dimension for X which is defined recursively. It is always an integer (or +\u221e) and is denoted dimind(X).\n\nTheorem. Suppose X is non-empty. Then \n\nMoreover,\n\nwhere Y ranges over metric spaces homeomorphic to X. In other words, X and Y have the same underlying set of points and the metric dY of Y is topologically equivalent to dX.\n\nThese results were originally established by Edward Szpilrajn (1907\u20131976), e.g., see Hurewicz and Wallman, Chapter VII.\n\n Hausdorff dimension and Minkowski dimension \nThe Minkowski dimension is similar to, and at least as large as, the Hausdorff dimension, and they are equal in many situations. However, the set of rational points in [0, 1] has Hausdorff dimension zero and Minkowski dimension one. There are also compact sets for which the Minkowski dimension is strictly larger than the Hausdorff dimension.\n\n Hausdorff dimensions and Frostman measures \nIf there is a measure \u03bc defined on Borel subsets of a metric space X such that \u03bc(X) > 0 and \u03bc(B(x, r)) \u2264 rs holds for some constant s > 0 and for every ball B(x, r) in X, then dimHaus(X) \u2265 s. A partial converse is provided by Frostman's lemma.This Wikipedia article also discusses further useful characterizations of the Hausdorff dimension.\n\n Behaviour under unions and products \nIf  is a finite or countable union, then\n\nThis can be verified directly from the definition.\n\nIf X and Y are non-empty metric spaces, then the Hausdorff dimension of their product satisfies\n\nThis inequality can be strict. It is possible to find two sets of dimension 0 whose product has dimension 1. In the opposite direction, it is known that when X and Y are Borel subsets of Rn, the Hausdorff dimension of X \u00d7 Y is bounded from above by the Hausdorff dimension of X plus the upper packing dimension of Y. These facts are discussed in Mattila (1995).\n\nSelf-similar sets\n\nMany sets defined by a self-similarity condition have dimensions which can be determined explicitly. Roughly, a set E is self-similar if it is the fixed point of a set-valued transformation \u03c8, that is \u03c8(E) = E, although the exact definition is given below.\n\nTheorem. Suppose\n\nare contractive mappings on Rn with contraction constant rj < 1. Then there is a unique non-empty compact set A such that\n\nThe theorem follows from Stefan Banach's contractive mapping fixed point theorem applied to the complete metric space of non-empty compact subsets of Rn with the Hausdorff distance.\n\nThe open set condition\nTo determine the dimension of the self-similar set A (in certain cases), we need a technical condition called the open set condition (OSC) on the sequence of contractions \u03c8i.\n\nThere is a relatively compact open set V such that\n\nwhere the sets in union on the left are pairwise disjoint.\n\nThe open set condition is a separation condition that ensures the images \u03c8i(V) do not overlap \"too much\".\n\nTheorem. Suppose the open set condition holds and each \u03c8i is a similitude, that is a composition of an isometry and a dilation around some point. Then the unique fixed point of \u03c8 is a set whose Hausdorff dimension is s where s is the unique solution of\n\nThe contraction coefficient of a similitude is the magnitude of the dilation.\n\nWe can use this theorem to compute the Hausdorff dimension of the Sierpinski triangle (or sometimes called Sierpinski gasket). Consider three non-collinear points a1, a2, a3 in the plane R2 and let \u03c8i be the dilation of ratio 1/2 around ai. The unique non-empty fixed point of the corresponding mapping \u03c8 is a Sierpinski gasket and the dimension s is the unique solution of\n\nTaking natural logarithms of both sides of the above equation, we can solve for s, that is: s = ln(3)/ln(2).  The Sierpinski gasket is self-similar and satisfies the OSC. In general a set E which is a fixed point of a mapping\n\n \n\nis self-similar if and only if the intersections\n\nwhere s is the Hausdorff dimension of E and Hs denotes Hausdorff measure. This is clear in the case of the Sierpinski gasket (the intersections are just points), but is also true more generally:\n\nTheorem. Under the same conditions as the previous theorem, the unique fixed point of \u03c8 is self-similar.\n\nSee also\n List of fractals by Hausdorff dimension Examples of deterministic fractals, random and natural fractals.\n Assouad dimension, another variation of fractal dimension that, like Hausdorff dimension, is defined using coverings by balls\n Intrinsic dimension\n Packing dimension\n Fractal dimension\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Several selections from this volume are reprinted in  See chapters 9,10,11\n \n \n\nExternal links\n Hausdorff dimension at Encyclopedia of Mathematics\n Hausdorff measure at Encyclopedia of Mathematics\n\nCategory:Fractals\nCategory:Metric geometry\nCategory:Dimension theory"}

From ancient times through the post-classical age,Or the Middle Ages. bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation.  As the early modern age opened and the worldwide spread of knowledge began, written examples of mathematical developments came to light.  The \"symbolic\" stage is where comprehensive systems of notation supersede rhetoric. Beginning in Italy in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day. This symbolic system was in use by medieval Indian mathematicians and in Europe since the middle of the 17th century,Solomon Gandz. \"The Sources of al-Khowarizmi's Algebra\" and has continued to develop in the contemporary era.\n\nThe area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, the focus here, the investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.\n\nRhetorical stage\n\nAlthough the history commences with that of the Ionian schools, there is no doubt that those Ancient Greeks who paid attention to it were largely indebted to the previous investigations of the Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Phoenicians. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values (arithmetic), implies a state of civilization at the period of its invention. Our knowledge of the mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.\n\nMany areas of mathematics began with the study of real world problems, before the underlying rules and concepts were identified and defined as abstract structures. For example, geometry has its origins in the calculation of distances and areas in the real world; algebra started with methods of solving problems in arithmetic.\n\nThere can be no doubt that most early peoples which have left records knew something of numeration and mechanics, and that a few were also acquainted with the elements of land-surveying. In particular, the Egyptians paid attention to geometry and numbers, and the Phoenicians to practical arithmetic, book-keeping, navigation, and land-surveying. The results attained by these people seem to have been accessible, under certain conditions, to travelers. It is probable that the knowledge of the Egyptians and Phoenicians was largely the result of observation and measurement, and represented the accumulated experience of many ages.\n\nBeginning of notation\n\nWritten mathematics began with numbers expressed as tally marks, with each tally representing a single unit. The numerical symbols consisted probably of strokes or notches cut in wood or stone, and intelligible alike to all nations.Such characters, in fact, are preserved with little alteration in the Roman notation, an account of which may be found in John Leslie's Philosophy of Arithmetic. For example, one notch in a bone represented one animal, or person, or anything else. The peoples with whom the Greeks of Asia Minor (amongst whom notation in western history begins) were likely to have come into frequent contact were those inhabiting the eastern littoral of the Mediterranean: and Greek tradition uniformly assigned the special development of geometry to the Egyptians, and that of the science of numbersNumber theory is branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers. Number theorists study prime numbers as well as the properties of objects made out of integers (e.g., rational numbers) or defined as generalizations of the integers (e.g., algebraic integers). either to the Egyptians or to the Phoenicians.\n\nThe Ancient Egyptians had a symbolic notation which was the numeration by Hieroglyphics.Encyclop\u00e6dia Americana. By Thomas Gamaliel Bradford. Pg 314Mathematical Excursion, Enhanced Edition: Enhanced Webassign Edition By Richard N. Aufmann, Joanne Lockwood, Richard D. Nation, Daniel K. Cleg. Pg 186  The Egyptian mathematics had a symbol for one, ten, one-hundred, one-thousand, ten-thousand, one-hundred-thousand, and one-million.  Smaller digits were placed on the left of the number, as they are in Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals.  Later, the Egyptians used hieratic instead of hieroglyphic script to show numbers.  Hieratic was more like cursive and replaced several groups of symbols with individual ones.  For example, the four vertical lines used to represent four were replaced by a single horizontal line.  This is found in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 2000\u20131800 BC) and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1890 BC).  The system the Egyptians used was discovered and modified by many other civilizations in the Mediterranean.  The Egyptians also had symbols for basic operations: legs going forward represented addition, and legs walking backward to represent subtraction.\n\nThe Mesopotamians had symbols for each power of ten.Mathematics in Egypt and Mesopotamia  Later, they wrote their numbers in almost exactly the same way done in modern times.  Instead of having symbols for each power of ten, they would just put the coefficient of that number.  Each digit was at separated by only a space, but by the time of Alexander the Great, they had created a symbol that represented zero and was a placeholder.  The Mesopotamians also used a sexagesimal system, that is base sixty.  It is this system that is used in modern times when measuring time and angles. Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s.Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989  (1991 pbk ed. ). \"Mesopotamia\" p. 25. Written in Cuneiform script, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework. The earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians and the system of metrology from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.Duncan J. Melville (2003). Third Millennium Chronology, Third Millennium Mathematics. St. Lawrence University.\n\nThe majority of Mesopotamian clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of regular reciprocal pairs. The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of  accurate to five decimal places. Babylonian mathematics were written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of minutes and seconds of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors: the reciprocal of any integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 has a finite expansion in base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context.\n\nSyncopated stage\nthumb|Archimedes Thoughtfulby Fetti (1620)\n\nThe last words attributed to Archimedes are \"Do not disturb my circles\", a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier.\n\nThe history of mathematics cannot with certainty be traced back to any school or period before that of the Ionian Greeks, but the subsequent history may be divided into periods, the distinctions between which are tolerably well marked. Greek mathematics, which originated with the study of geometry, tended from its commencement to be deductive and scientific. Since the fourth century AD, Pythagoras has commonly been given credit for discovering the Pythagorean theorem, a theorem in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle the area of the square on the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares of the other two sides.That is, . The ancient mathematical texts are available with the prior mentioned Ancient Egyptians notation and with Plimpton 322 (Babylonian mathematics c. 1900 BC).  The study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term \"mathematics\" from the ancient Greek \u03bc\u03ac\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 (mathema), meaning \"subject of instruction\".\n\nPlato's influence has been especially strong in mathematics and the sciences. He helped to distinguish between pure and applied mathematics by widening the gap between \"arithmetic\", now called number theory and \"logistic\", now called arithmetic. Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.Sir Thomas L. Heath, A Manual of Greek Mathematics, Dover, 1963, p. 1: \"In the case of mathematics, it is the Greek contribution which it is most essential to know, for it was the Greeks who made mathematics a science.\" Aristotle is credited with what later would be called the law of excluded middle.\n\nAbstract Mathematics is what treats of magnitudeMagnitude (mathematics), the relative size of an object ; Magnitude (vector), a term for the size or length of a vector; Scalar (mathematics), a quantity defined only by its magnitude; Euclidean vector, a quantity defined by both its magnitude and its direction; Order of magnitude, the class of scale having a fixed value ratio to the preceding class. or quantity, absolutely and generally conferred, without regard to any species of particular magnitude, such as arithmetic and geometry, In this sense, abstract mathematics is opposed to mixed mathematics, wherein simple and abstract properties, and the relations of quantities primitively considered in mathematics, are applied to sensible objects, and by that means become intermixed with physical considerations, such as in hydrostatics, optics, and navigation.The new encyclop\u00e6dia; or, Universal dictionary of arts and sciences. By Encyclopaedia Perthensi. Pg 49\n\nArchimedes is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time. He used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of pi. He also defined the spiral bearing his name, formulae for the volumes of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers.\n\nthumbnail|Euclid's Elements\n\nThe prop. 31, 32 and 33 of the book of Euclid XI, which is located in vol. 2 of the manuscript, the sheets 207 to - 208 recto.\nIn the historical development of geometry, the steps in the abstraction of geometry were made by the ancient Greeks. Euclid's Elements being the earliest extant documentation of the axioms of plane geometry\u2014 though Proclus tells of an earlier axiomatisation by Hippocrates of Chios. Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC) is one of the oldest extant Greek mathematical treatisesAutolycus' On the Moving Sphere is another ancient mathematical manuscript of the time. and consisted of 13 books written in Alexandria; collecting theorems proven by other mathematicians, supplemented by some original work.Proclus, a Greek mathematician who lived several centuries after Euclid, wrote in his commentary of the Elements: \"Euclid, who put together the Elements, collecting many of Eudoxus' theorems, perfecting many of Theaetetus', and also bringing to irrefragable demonstration the things which were only somewhat loosely proved by his predecessors\". The document is a successful collection of definitions, postulates (axioms), propositions (theorems and constructions), and mathematical proofs of the propositions. Euclid's first theorem is a lemma that possesses properties of prime numbers. The influential thirteen books cover Euclidean geometry, geometric algebra, and the ancient Greek version of algebraic systems and elementary number theory. It was ubiquitous in the Quadrivium and is instrumental in the development of logic, mathematics, and science.\n\nDiophantus of Alexandria was author of a series of books called Arithmetica,  many of which are now lost. These texts deal with solving algebraic equations. Boethius provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term quadrivium to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote De institutione arithmetica, a free translation from the Greek of Nicomachus's Introduction to Arithmetic; De institutione musica, also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid's Elements. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.Caldwell, John (1981) \"The De Institutione Arithmetica and the De Institutione Musica\", pp. 135\u201354 in Margaret Gibson, ed., Boethius: His Life, Thought, and Influence, (Oxford: Basil Blackwell).Folkerts, Menso, \"Boethius\" Geometrie II, (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1970).\n\nAcrophonic and Milesian numeration\n\nThe Greeks employed Attic numeration,Mathematics and Measurement By Oswald Ashton Wentworth Dilk. Pg 14 which was based on the system of the Egyptians and was later adapted and used by the Romans. Greek numerals one through four were vertical lines, as in the hieroglyphics. The symbol for five was the Greek letter \u03a0 (pi), which is the letter of the Greek word for five, pente. Numbers six through nine were pente with vertical lines next to it. Ten was represented by the letter (\u0394) of the word for ten, deka, one hundred by the letter from the word for hundred, etc.\n\nThe Ionian numeration used their entire alphabet including three archaic letters. The numeral notation of the Greeks, though far less convenient than that now in use, was formed on a perfectly regular and scientific plan,A dictionary of science, literature and art, ed. by W.T. Brande. Pg 683 and could be used with tolerable effect as an instrument of calculation, to which purpose the Roman system was totally inapplicable. The Greeks divided the twenty-four letters of their alphabet into three classes, and, by adding another symbol to each class, they had characters to represent the units, tens, and hundreds.

When lowercase letters became differentiated from upper case letters, the lower case letters were used as the symbols for notation. Multiples of one thousand were written as the nine numbers with a stroke in front of them: thus one thousand was \",\u03b1\", two-thousand was \",\u03b2\", etc. M (for \u03bc\u1f50\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03b9, as in \"myriad\") was used to multiply numbers by ten thousand. For example, the number 88,888,888 would be written as M,\u03b7\u03c9\u03c0\u03b7*\u03b7\u03c9\u03c0\u03b7Boyer, Carl B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 1991.\n\nGreek mathematical reasoning was almost entirely geometric (albeit often used to reason about non-geometric subjects such as number theory), and hence the Greeks had no interest in algebraic symbols.

Pg 131  Numbers one through four were horizontal lines.  Five was an X between two horizontal lines; it looked almost exactly the same as the Roman numeral for ten. Nowadays, the hu\u0101m\u01ce system is only used for displaying prices in Chinese markets or on traditional handwritten invoices.\n\nIn the history of the Chinese, there were those who were familiar with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. Mathematics in China emerged independently by the 11th century BC. It is almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements;such as the rule, square, compasses, water level (reed level), and plumb-bob. with mechanical machines;such as the wheel and axle that they knew of the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and negative numbers, decimals, a place value decimal system, a binary system, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.\n\nthumb|Counting rod numerals\nChinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system.George Gheverghese Joseph, The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, Penguin Books, London, 1991, pp.140\u2014148Georges Ifrah, Universalgeschichte der Zahlen, Campus, Frankfurt/New York, 1986, pp.428\u2014437  The geometrical theorem known to the ancient Chinese were acquainted was applicable in certain cases (namely the ratio of sides).The area of the square described on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares described on the sides It is that geometrical theorems which can be demonstrated in the quasi-experimental way of superposition were also known to them. In arithmetic their knowledge seems to have been confined to the art of calculation by means of the swan-pan, and the power of expressing the results in writing. Our knowledge of the early attainments of the Chinese, slight though it is, is more complete than in the case of most of their contemporaries. It is thus instructive, and serves to illustrate the fact, that it can be known a nation may possess considerable skill in the applied arts with but our knowledge of the later mathematics on which those arts are founded can be scarce. Knowledge of Chinese mathematics before 254 BC is somewhat fragmentary, and even after this date the manuscript traditions are obscure. Dates centuries before the classical period are generally considered conjectural by Chinese scholars unless accompanied by verified archaeological evidence.\n\nAs in other early societies the focus was on astronomy in order to perfect the agricultural calendar, and other practical tasks, and not on establishing formal systems.The Chinese Board of Mathematics duties were confined to the annual preparation of an almanac, the dates and predictions in which it regulated. Ancient Chinese mathematicians did not develop an axiomatic approach, but made advances in algorithm development and algebra. The achievement of Chinese algebra reached its zenith in the 13th century, when Zhu Shijie invented method of four unknowns.\n\nAs a result of obvious linguistic and geographic barriers, as well as content, Chinese mathematics and that of the mathematics of the ancient Mediterranean world are presumed to have developed more or less independently up to the time when The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art reached its final form, while the Writings on Reckoning and Huainanzi are roughly contemporary with classical Greek mathematics. Some exchange of ideas across Asia through known cultural exchanges from at least Roman times is likely. Frequently, elements of the mathematics of early societies correspond to rudimentary results found later in branches of modern mathematics such as geometry or number theory. The Pythagorean theorem for example, has been attested to the time of the Duke of Zhou. Knowledge of Pascal's triangle has also been shown to have existed in China centuries before Pascal, such as by Shen Kuo.\n\nthumb|Modern artist's impression of Shen Kuo.\nThe state of trigonometry in China slowly began to change and advance during the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), where Chinese mathematicians began to express greater emphasis for the need of spherical trigonometry in calendarical science and astronomical calculations. The polymath Chinese scientist, mathematician and official Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) used trigonometric functions to solve mathematical problems of chords and arcs.Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.. Sal Restivo writes that Shen's work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by the mathematician and astronomer Guo Shoujing (1231\u20131316).Sal Restivo As the historians L. Gauchet and Joseph Needham state, Guo Shoujing used spherical trigonometry in his calculations to improve the calendar system and Chinese astronomy.Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 3, Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd.Marcel Gauchet, 151. The mathematical science of the Chinese would incorporate the work and teaching of Arab missionaries with knowledge of spherical trigonometry who had come to China in the course of the thirteenth century.\n\nIndian & Arabic numerals and notation\n\nAlthough the origin of our present system of numerical notation is ancient, there is no doubt that it was in use among the Hindus over two thousand years ago. The algebraic notation of the Indian mathematician, Brahmagupta, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by placing the numbers side by side, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend (the number to be subtracted), and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, similar to our notation but without the bar. Multiplication, evolution, and unknown quantities were represented by abbreviations of appropriate terms.Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989  (1991 pbk ed. ). \"China and India\" p. 221. (cf., \"he was the first one to give a general solution of the linear Diophantine equation ax + by = c, where a, b, and c are integers. [...] It is greatly to the credit of Brahmagupta that he gave all integral solutions of the linear Diophantine equation, whereas Diophantus himself had been satisfied to give one particular solution of an indeterminate equation. Inasmuch as Brahmagupta used some of the same examples as Diophantus, we see again the likelihood of Greek influence in India \u2013 or the possibility that they both made use of a common source, possibly from Babylonia. It is interesting to note also that the algebra of Brahmagupta, like that of Diophantus, was syncopated. Addition was indicated by juxtaposition, subtraction by placing a dot over the subtrahend, and division by placing the divisor below the dividend, as in our fractional notation but without the bar. The operations of multiplication and evolution (the taking of roots), as well as unknown quantities, were represented by abbreviations of appropriate words.\") The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.Robert Kaplan, \"The Nothing That Is: A Natural History of Zero\", Allen Lane/The Penguin Press, London, 1999\n\nthumb|A page from al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's Algebra\n\nDespite their name, Arabic numerals have roots in India. The reason for this misnomer is Europeans saw the numerals used in an Arabic book, Concerning the Hindu Art of Reckoning, by Mohommed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi. Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b wrote several important books on the Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, written about 825, along with the work of Al-Kindi,Al-Kindi also introduced cryptanalysis and frequency analysis. were instrumental in spreading Indian mathematics and Indian numerals to the West. Al-Khwarizmi did not claim the numerals as Arabic, but over several Latin translations, the fact that the numerals were Indian in origin was lost. The word algorithm is derived from the Latinization of Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's name, Algoritmi, and the word algebra from the title of one of his works, Al-Kit\u0101b al-mukhta\u1e63ar f\u012b h\u012bs\u0101b al-\u011fabr wa\u2019l-muq\u0101bala (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing).\n\nIslamic mathematics developed and expanded the mathematics known to Central Asian civilizations.A.P. Juschkewitsch, \"Geschichte der Mathematik im Mittelalter\", Teubner, Leipzig, 1964 Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots,Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989  (1991 pbk ed. ). \"The Arabic Hegemony\" p. 230. (cf., \"The six cases of equations given above exhaust all possibilities for linear and quadratic equations having positive root. So systematic and exhaustive was al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b's exposition that his readers must have had little difficulty in mastering the solutions.\") and Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b was to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake.Gandz and Saloman (1936), The sources of Khwarizmi's algebra, Osiris i, pp. 263\u201377: \"In a sense, Khwarizmi is more entitled to be called \"the father of algebra\" than Diophantus because Khwarizmi is the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake, Diophantus is primarily concerned with the theory of numbers\". Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b also discussed the fundamental method of \"reduction\" and \"balancing\", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b originally described as al-jabr.Boyer, C. B. A History of Mathematics, 2nd ed. rev. by Uta C. Merzbach. New York: Wiley, 1989  (1991 pbk ed. ). \"The Arabic Hegemony\" p. 229. (cf.,  \"It is not certain just what the terms al-jabr and muqabalah mean, but the usual interpretation is similar to that implied in the translation above. The word al-jabr presumably meant something like \"restoration\" or \"completion\" and seems to refer to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation; the word muqabalah is said to refer to \"reduction\" or \"balancing\" - that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation.\") His algebra was also no longer concerned \"with a series of problems to be resolved, but an exposition which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study.\" Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b also studied an equation for its own sake and \"in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems.\"\n\nAl-Karaji, in his treatise al-Fakhri, extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities.Something close to a proof by mathematical induction appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the binomial theorem, Pascal's triangle, and the sum of integral cubes.Victor J. Katz (1998). History of Mathematics: An Introduction, pp. 255\u201359. Addison-Wesley. . The historian of mathematics, F. Woepcke,F. Woepcke (1853). Extrait du Fakhri, trait\u00e9 d'Alg\u00e8bre par Abou Bekr Mohammed Ben Alhacan Alkarkhi. Paris. praised Al-Karaji for being \"the first who introduced the theory of algebraic calculus.\" Also in the 10th century, Abul Wafa translated the works of Diophantus into Arabic. Ibn al-Haytham would develop analytic geometry. Al-Haytham derived the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. Al-Haytham performed an integration in order to find the volume of a paraboloid, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of polynomials up to the fourth degree.He thus came close to finding a general formula for the integrals of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.Victor J. Katz (1995), \"Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India\", Mathematics Magazine 68 (3): 163\u201374.  In the late 11th century, Omar Khayyam would develop algebraic geometry, wrote Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid,a book about what he perceived as flaws in Euclid's Elements, especially the parallel postulate and wrote on the general geometric solution to cubic equations. Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made advances in spherical trigonometry. Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals.\n\nThe modern Arabic numeral symbols used around the world first appeared in Islamic North Africa in the 10th century. A distinctive Western Arabic variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals began to emerge around the 10th century in the Maghreb and Al-Andalus (sometimes called ghubar numerals, though the term is not always accepted), which are the direct ancestor of the modern Arabic numerals used throughout the world.\n\nMany Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then translated into Latin, which led to further development of mathematics in medieval Europe. In the 12th century, scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b'stranslated into Latin by Robert of Chester and the complete text of Euclid's Elements.translated in various versions by Adelard of Bath, Herman of Carinthia, and Gerard of CremonaMarie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se d'Alverny, \"Translations and Translators\", pp. 421\u201362 in Robert L.

Benson and Giles Constable, Renaissance and Renewal in the Twelfth Century, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1982). One of the European books that advocated using the numerals was Liber Abaci, by Leonardo of Pisa, better known as Fibonacci. Liber Abaci is better known for the mathematical problem Fibonacci wrote in it about a population of rabbits.  The growth of the population ended up being a Fibonacci sequence, where a term is the sum of the two preceding terms.\n\nSymbolic stage\nSymbols by popular introduction date\n\nEarly arithmetic and multiplication\n\nThe transition to symbolic algebra, where only symbols are used, can first be seen in the work of Ibn al-Banna' al-Marrakushi (1256\u20131321) and Ab\u016b al-\u1e24asan ibn \u02bfAl\u012b al-Qala\u1e63\u0101d\u012b (1412\u20131482). Al-Qalas\u0101d\u012b was the last major medieval Arab algebraist, who improved on the algebraic notation earlier used in the Maghreb by Ibn al-Banna. In contrast to the syncopated notations of their predecessors, Diophantus and Brahmagupta, which lacked symbols for mathematical operations,Boyer, C. B.

New York: Wiley, 1989  (1991 pbk ed. ). \"Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics\" p. 178 (cf., \"The chief difference between Diophantine syncopation and the modern algebraic notation is the lack of special symbols for operations and relations, as well as of the exponential notation.\") al-Qalasadi's algebraic notation was the first to have symbols for these functions and was thus \"the first steps toward the introduction of algebraic symbolism.\" He represented mathematical symbols using characters from the Arabic alphabet.\n\nthumbnail|The 1489 use of the plus and minus signs in print.\nThe 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems.Grant, Edward and John E. Murdoch (1987), eds., Mathematics and Its Applications to Science and Natural Philosophy in the Middle Ages, (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) . The two widely used arithmetic symbols are addition and subtraction, + and \u2212.  The plus sign was used by 1360 by Nicole OresmeMathematical Magazine, Volume 1. Artemas Martin, 1887.

Oresme at the University of Paris and the Italian Giovanni di Casali independently provided graphical demonstrations of the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration and represented the total distance traveled.Clagett, Marshall (1961) The Science of Mechanics in the Middle Ages, (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press), pp. 332\u201345, 382\u201391.

Luca Pacioli used symbols for plus and minus symbols and contained algebra.Much of the work originated from Piero Della Francesca whom he appropriated and purloined.\n\nIn the 15th century, Ghiyath al-Kashi computed the value of \u03c0 to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating nth roots.This was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by Ruffini and Horner. In 1533, Regiomontanus's table of sines and cosines were published. Scipione del Ferro and Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia discovered solutions for cubic equations.  Gerolamo Cardano published them in his 1545 book Ars Magna, together with a solution for the quartic equations, discovered by his student Lodovico Ferrari.  The radical symbolThat is, . for square root was introduced by Christoph Rudolff.Because, it is thought, it resembled a lowercase \"r\" (for \"radix\"). Michael Stifel's important work Arithmetica integraArithmetica integra. By Michael Stifel, Philipp Melanchton. Norimberg\u00e6: Apud Iohan Petreium, 1544. contained important innovations in mathematical notation. In 1556, Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia used parentheses for precedence grouping. In 1557 Robert Recorde published The Whetstone of Witte which used the equal sign (=) as well as plus and minus signs for the English reader. In 1564, Gerolamo Cardano analyzed games of chance beginning the early stages of probability theory. In 1572 Rafael Bombelli published his L'Algebra in which he showed how to deal with the imaginary quantities that could appear in Cardano's formula for solving cubic equations. Simon Stevin's book De Thiende ('the art of tenths'), published in Dutch in 1585, contained a systematic treatment of decimal notation, which influenced all later work on the real number system. The New algebra (1591) of Fran\u00e7ois Vi\u00e8te introduced the modern notational manipulation of algebraic expressions.

By David Stewart Erskine Earl of Buchan, Walter Minto After Napier, Edmund Gunter created the logarithmic scales (lines, or rules) upon which slide rules are based, it was William Oughtred who used two such scales sliding by one another to perform direct multiplication and division; and he is credited as the inventor of the slide rule in 1622. In 1631 Oughtred introduced the multiplication sign (\u00d7) his proportionality sign,That is, \u2237 and abbreviations sin and cos for the sine and cosine functions. Albert Girard also used the abbreviations 'sin', 'cos' and 'tan' for the trigonometric functions in his treatise.\n\nJohannes Kepler was one of the pioneers of the mathematical applications of infinitesimals.see Law of Continuity. Ren\u00e9 Descartes is credited as the father of analytical geometry, the bridge between algebra and geometry,Using Cartesian coordinates on the plane, the distance between two points (x1,\u00a0y1) and (x2,\u00a0y2) is defined by the formula:\n\nwhich can be viewed as a version of the Pythagorean theorem. crucial to the discovery of infinitesimal calculus and analysis. In the 17th century, Descartes introduced Cartesian co-ordinates which allowed the development of analytic geometry.Further steps in abstraction were taken by Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann, and Gauss who generalised the concepts of geometry to develop non-Euclidean geometries. Blaise Pascal influenced mathematics throughout his life. His Trait\u00e9 du triangle arithm\u00e9tique (\"Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle\") of 1653 described a convenient tabular presentation for binomial coefficients.Now called Pascal's triangle. Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal would investigate probability.For example, the \"problem of points\". John Wallis introduced the infinity symbol.That is, . He similarly used this notation for infinitesimals.For example,  In 1657, Christiaan Huygens published the treatise on probability, On Reasoning in Games of Chance.Original title, \"De ratiociniis in ludo aleae\"Jan Gullberg, Mathematics from the birth of numbers, W.

This usage was popularized in 1737 by Euler. In 1734, Pierre Bouguer used double horizontal bar below the inequality sign.When Less is More: Visualizing Basic Inequalities.By Claudi Alsina, Roger B. Nelse. Pg 18.\n\nDerivatives notation: Leibniz and Newton\n\nDerivative notations\n\nThe study of linear algebra emerged from the study of determinants, which were used to solve systems of linear equations. Calculus had two main systems of notation, each created by one of the creators: that developed by Isaac Newton and the notation developed by Gottfried Leibniz.  Leibniz's is the notation used most often today.  Newton's was simply a dot or dash placed above the function.For example, the derivative of the function x would be written as .  The second derivative of x would be written as , etc. In modern usage, this notation generally denotes derivatives of physical quantities with respect to time, and is used frequently in the science of mechanics. Leibniz, on the other hand, used the letter d as a prefix to indicate differentiation, and introduced the notation representing derivatives as if they were a special type of fraction.For example, the derivative of the function x with respect to the variable t in Leibniz's notation would be written as . This notation makes explicit the variable with respect to which the derivative of the function is taken. Leibniz also created the integral symbol.That is, .  The symbol is an elongated S, representing the Latin word Summa, meaning \"sum\".  When finding areas under curves, integration is often illustrated by dividing the area into infinitely many tall, thin rectangles, whose areas are added.  Thus, the integral symbol is an elongated s, for sum.\n\nHigh division operators and functions\n\nLetters of the alphabet in this time were to be used as symbols of quantity; and although much diversity existed with respect to the choice of letters, there were to be several universally recognized rules in the following history. Here thus in the history of equations the first letters of the alphabet were indicatively known as coefficients, the last letters the unknown terms (an  incerti ordinis). In algebraic geometry, again, a similar rule was to be observed, the last letters of the alphabet there denoting the variable or current coordinates. Certain letters, such as , , etc., were by universal consent appropriated as symbols of the frequently occurring numbers 3.14159 ..., and 2.7182818 ....,See also: List of representations of e etc., and their use in any other acceptation was to be avoided as much as possible. Letters, too, were to be employed as symbols of operation, and with them other previously mentioned arbitrary operation characters. The letters , elongated  were to be appropriated as operative symbols in the differential calculus and integral calculus,  and \u2211 in the calculus of differences. In functional notation, a letter, as a symbol of operation, is combined with another which is regarded as a symbol of quantity.Thus  denotes the mathematical result of the performance of the operation  upon the subject . If upon this result the same operation were repeated, the new result would be expressed by , or more concisely by , and so on. The quantity  itself regarded as the result of the same operation  upon some other function; the proper symbol for which is, by analogy, . Thus  and  are symbols of inverse operations, the former cancelling the effect of the latter on the subject .  and  in a similar manner are termed inverse functions.\n\nBeginning in 1718, Thomas Twinin used the division slash (solidus), deriving it from the earlier Arabic horizontal fraction bar. Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace developed the widely used Laplacian differential operator.That is,  In 1750, Gabriel Cramer developed \"Cramer's Rule\" for solving linear systems.\n\nEuler and prime notations\nthumbnail|Leonhard Euler's signature\nLeonhard Euler was one of the most prolific mathematicians in history, and also a prolific inventor of canonical notation. His contributions include his use of e to represent the base of natural logarithms.  It is not known exactly why  was chosen, but it was probably because the four letters of the alphabet were already commonly used to represent variables and other constants.  Euler used  to represent pi consistently.  The use of  was suggested by William Jones, who used it as shorthand for perimeter.  Euler used  to represent the square root of negative one,That is,  although he earlier used it as an infinite number. Today, the symbol created by John Wallis, , is used for infinity.As in,  For summation, Euler used sigma, \u03a3.Capital-sigma notation uses a symbol that compactly represents summation of many similar terms: the summation symbol, \u2211, an enlarged form of the upright capital Greek letter Sigma. This is defined as: \nWhere, i represents the index of summation; ai is an indexed variable representing each successive term in the series; m is the lower bound of summation, and n is the upper bound of summation. The \"i = m\" under the summation symbol means that the index i starts out equal to m.  The index, i, is incremented by 1 for each successive term, stopping when i = n. For functions, Euler used the notation  to represent a function of . In 1730, Euler wrote the gamma function.That is, . valid for n > 0. In 1736, Euler produces his paper on the Seven Bridges of K\u00f6nigsbergEuler, Leonhard, Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis initiating the study of graph theory.\n\nThe mathematician, William EmersonThe elements of geometry. By William Emerson would develop the proportionality sign.That is, \u221dProportionality is the ratio of one quantity to another, especially the ratio of a part compared to a whole. In a mathematical context, a proportion is the statement of equality between two ratios; See Proportionality (mathematics), the relationship of two variables whose ratio is constant. See also aspect ratio, geometric proportions.The Doctrine of Proportion, Arithmetical and Geometrical. Together with a General Method of Arening by Proportional Quantities. By William Emerson.The Mathematical Correspondent. By George Baron. 83 Much later in the abstract expressions of the value of various proportional phenomena, the parts-per notation would become useful as a set of pseudo units to describe small values of miscellaneous dimensionless quantities. Marquis de Condorcet, in 1768, advanced the partial differential sign.The curly d or Jacobi's delta.  In 1771, Alexandre-Th\u00e9ophile Vandermonde deduced the importance of topological features when discussing the properties of knots related to the geometry of position. Between 1772 and 1788, Joseph-Louis Lagrange re-formulated the formulas and calculations of Classical \"Newtonian\" mechanics, called Lagrangian mechanics. The prime symbol for derivatives was also made by Lagrange.\n\nGauss, Hamilton, and Matrix notations\nAt the turn of the 19th century, Carl Friedrich Gauss developed the identity sign for congruence relation and, in Quadratic reciprocity, the integral part. Gauss contributed functions of complex variables, in geometry, and on the convergence of series. He gave the satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law. Gauss developed the theory of solving linear systems by using Gaussian elimination, which was initially listed as an advancement in geodesy. He would also develop the product sign. Also in this time, Niels Henrik Abel and \u00c9variste GaloisGalois theory and Galois geometry is named after him. conducted their work on the solvability of equations, linking group theory and field theory.\n\nAfter the 1800s, Christian Kramp would promote factorial notation during his research in generalized factorial function which applied to non-integers. Joseph Diaz Gergonne introduced the set inclusion signs.That is, \"subset of\" and \"superset of\"; This would later be redeveloped by Ernst Schr\u00f6der. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet developed Dirichlet L-functions to give the proof of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions and began analytic number theory.A science of numbers that uses methods from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. In 1828, Gauss proved his Theorema Egregium (remarkable theorem in Latin), establishing property of surfaces. In the 1830s, George Green developed Green's function. In 1829. Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi publishes Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum with his elliptic theta functions. By 1841, Karl Weierstrass, the \"father of modern analysis\", elaborated on the concept of absolute value and the determinant of a matrix.\n\nMatrix notation would be more fully developed by Arthur Cayley in his three papers, on subjects which had been suggested by reading the M\u00e9canique analytiqueM\u00e9canique analytique: Volume 1, Volume 2. By Joseph Louis Lagrange. Ms. Ve Courcier, 1811. of Lagrange and some of the works of Laplace. Cayley defined matrix multiplication and matrix inverses. Cayley used a single letter to denote a matrix,The collected mathematical papers of Arthur Cayley. Volume 11. Page 243. thus treating a matrix as an aggregate object. He also realized the connection between matrices and determinants,Historical Encyclopedia of Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Volume 1. By Ari Ben-Menahem. Pg 2070. and wrote \"There would be many things to say about this theory of matrices which should, it seems to me, precede the theory of determinants\".Vitulli, Marie. \"A Brief History of Linear Algebra and Matrix Theory\". Department of Mathematics. University of Oregon. Originally at: darkwing.uoregon.edu/~vitulli/441.sp04/LinAlgHistory.html\n\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton would introduce the nabla symbolThat is,  (or, later called del, \u2207) for vector differentials.The Words of Mathematics. By Steven Schwartzman. 6.Electro-Magnetism: Theory and Applications. By A. Pramanik. 38 This was previously used by Hamilton as a general-purpose operator sign.History of Nabla and Other Math Symbols. homepages.math.uic.edu/~hanson. Hamilton reformulated Newtonian mechanics, now called Hamiltonian mechanics. This work has proven central to the modern study of classical field theories such as electromagnetism. This was also important to the development of quantum mechanics.See Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics). In mathematics, he is perhaps best known as the inventor of quaternion notationThat is,  and biquaternions.  Hamilton also introduced the word \"tensor\" in 1846.Though his use describes something different from what is now meant by a tensor. Namely, the norm operation in a certain type of algebraic system (now known as a Clifford algebra). James Cockle would develop the tessarinesThat is,where  and, in 1849, coquaternions. In 1848, James Joseph Sylvester introduced into matrix algebra the term matrix.This is Latin for \"womb\".\n\nMaxwell, Clifford, and Ricci notations\nthumbnail|James Clerk Maxwell\n\nMaxwell's most prominent achievement was to formulate a set of equations that united previously unrelated observations, experiments, and equations of electricity, magnetism, and optics into a consistent theory. \nIn 1864 James Clerk Maxwell reduced all of the then current knowledge of electromagnetism into a linked set of differential equations with 20 equations in 20 variables, contained in A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field. (This article accompanied a December 8, 1864 presentation by Maxwell to the Royal Society.) (See Maxwell's equations.) The method of calculation which it is necessary to employ was given by Lagrange, and afterwards developed, with some modifications, by Hamilton's equations. It is usually referred to as Hamilton's principle; when the equations in the original form are used they are known as Lagrange's equations. In 1871 Richard Dedekind called a set of real or complex numbers which is closed under the four arithmetic operations a field. In 1873 Maxwell presented A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism.\n\nIn 1878, William Kingdon Clifford published his Elements of Dynamic.;  Clifford developed split-biquaternions,That is,  which he called algebraic motors. Clifford obviated quaternion study by separating the dot product and cross product of two vectors from the complete quaternion notation.Clifford intersected algebra with Hamilton's quaternions by replacing Hermann Grassmann's rule epep = 0 by the rule epep = 1. For more details, see exterior algebra. This approach made vector calculus available to engineers and others working in three dimensions and skeptical of the lead\u2013lag effectSee: Phasor, Group (mathematics), Signal velocity, Polyphase system, Harmonic oscillator, and RLC series circuit in the fourth dimension.Or the concept of a fourth spatial dimension. See also: Spacetime, the unification of time and space as a four-dimensional continuum; and, Minkowski space, the mathematical setting for special relativity.  The common vector notations are used when working with vectors which are spatial or more abstract members of vector spaces, while angle notation (or phasor notation) is a notation used in electronics.\n\nIn 1881, Leopold Kronecker defined what he called a \"domain of rationality\", which is a field extension of the field of rational numbers in modern terms. In 1882,  wrote the book titled \"Linear Algebra\". Lord Kelvin's  aetheric atom theory (1860s) led Peter Guthrie Tait, in 1885, to publish a topological table of knots with up to ten crossings known as the Tait conjectures. In 1893, Heinrich M. Weber gave the clear definition of an abstract field.See also: Mathematic fields and Field extension  Tensor calculus was developed by Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro between 1887\u201396, presented in 1892 under the title absolute differential calculus, and the contemporary usage of \"tensor\" was stated by Woldemar Voigt in 1898. In 1895, Henri Poincar\u00e9 published Analysis Situs.Poincar\u00e9, Henri, \"Analysis situs\", Journal de l'\u00c9cole Polytechnique ser 2, 1 (1895) pp. 1\u2013123 In 1897, Charles Proteus Steinmetz would publish Theory and Calculation of Alternating Current Phenomena, with the assistance of Ernst J. Berg.\n\nFrom formula mathematics to tensors\n\nIn 1895 Giuseppe Peano issued his Formulario mathematico,There are many editions. Here are two:\n (French)  Published 1901 by Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  230p.  OpenLibrary OL15255022W, PDF.\n (Italian)  Published 1960 by Edizione cremonese, Roma. 463p.

He would also introduce the intersection sign, the union sign, the membership sign (is an element of), and existential quantifierThis raises questions of the pure existence theorems. (there exists). Peano would pass to Bertrand Russell his work in 1900 at a Paris conference; it so impressed Russell that Russell too was taken with the drive to render mathematics more concisely. The result was Principia Mathematica written with Alfred North Whitehead. This treatise marks a watershed in modern literature where symbol became dominant.Peano's Formulario Mathematico, though less popular than Russell's work, continued through five editions. The fifth appeared in 1908 and included 4200 formulas and theorems.  Ricci-Curbastro and Tullio Levi-Civita popularized the tensor index notation around 1900.\n\nMathematical logic and abstraction\n\nAbstraction\nAt the beginning of this period, Felix Klein's \"Erlangen program\" identified the underlying theme of various geometries, defining each of them as the study of properties invariant under a given group of symmetries. This level of abstraction revealed connections between geometry and abstract algebra. Georg CantorInventor of set theory would introduce the aleph symbol for cardinal numbers of transfinite sets.Transfinite arithmetic is the generalization of elementary arithmetic to infinite quantities like infinite sets; See Transfinite numbers, Transfinite induction, and Transfinite interpolation. See also Ordinal arithmetic. His notation for the cardinal numbers was the Hebrew letter  (aleph) with a natural number subscript; for the ordinals he employed the Greek letter \u03c9 (omega). This notation is still in use today in ordinal notation of a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet which names an ordinal number according to some scheme which gives meaning to the language. His theory created a great deal of controversy. Cantor would, in his study of Fourier series, consider point sets in Euclidean space.\n\nAfter the turn of the 20th century, Josiah Willard Gibbs would in physical chemistry introduce middle dot for dot product and the multiplication sign for cross products. He would also supply notation for the scalar and vector products, which was introduced in Vector Analysis. In 1904, Ernst Zermelo promotes axiom of choice and his proof of the well-ordering theorem.  Bertrand Russell would shortly afterward introduce logical disjunction (OR) in 1906. Also in 1906, Poincar\u00e9 would publish On the Dynamics of the Electron and Maurice Fr\u00e9chet introduced metric space.Fr\u00e9chet, Maurice, \"Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel\", PhD dissertation, 1906 Later, Gerhard Kowalewski and Cuthbert Edmund CullisCan be assigned a given matrix: About a class of matrices.

Alexander, and others. studied knots from the point of view of the knot group and invariants from homology theory.Such as the Alexander polynomial. In 1908, Joseph Wedderburn's structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional algebras over a field. Also in 1908, Ernst Zermelo proposed \"definite\" property and the first axiomatic set theory, Zermelo set theory. In 1910 Ernst Steinitz published the influential paper Algebraic Theory of Fields.(German: Algebraische Theorie der K\u00f6rper)In this paper Steinitz axiomatically studied the properties of fields and defined many important field theoretic concepts like prime field, perfect field and the transcendence degree of a field extension. In 1911, Steinmetz would publish Theory and Calculation of Transient Electric Phenomena and Oscillations.\n\nthumbnail|Albert Einstein in 1921\nAlbert Einstein, in 1916, introduced the Einstein notationThe indices range over set ,\n\nis reduced by the convention to:\n\nUpper indices are not exponents but are indices of coordinates, coefficients or basis vectors.\nSee also:  Ricci calculus which summed over a set of indexed terms in a formula, thus exerting notational brevity. Arnold Sommerfeld would create the contour integral sign in 1917. Also in 1917, Dimitry Mirimanoff proposes axiom of regularity. In 1919, Theodor Kaluza would solve general relativity equations using five dimensions, the results would have electromagnetic equations emerge.Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1918). Pg 966. This would be published in 1921 in \"Zum Unit\u00e4tsproblem der Physik\".Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1918)\n(Tr. Proceedings of the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1918)). archive.org; See also: Kaluza\u2013Klein theory . In 1922, Abraham Fraenkel and Thoralf Skolem independently proposed replacing the axiom schema of specification with the axiom schema of replacement. Also in 1922, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory was developed. In 1923, Steinmetz would publish Four Lectures on Relativity and Space. Around 1924, Jan Arnoldus Schouten would develop the modern notation and formalism for the Ricci calculus framework during the absolute differential calculus applications to general relativity and differential geometry in the early twentieth century.Ricci calculus constitutes the rules of index notation and manipulation for tensors and tensor fields. See also:  In 1925, Enrico Fermi would describe a system comprising many identical particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, afterwards developing a diffusion equation (Fermi age equation). In 1926, Oskar Klein would develop the Kaluza\u2013Klein theory.  In 1928, Emil Artin abstracted ring theory with Artinian rings. In 1933, Andrey Kolmogorov introduces the Kolmogorov axioms. In 1937, Bruno de Finetti deduced the \"operational subjective\" concept.\n\nMathematical symbolism\n\nMathematical abstraction began as a process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept,Robert B. Ash. A Primer of Abstract Mathematics. Cambridge University Press, Jan 1, 1998The New American Encyclopedic Dictionary. Edited by Edward Thomas Roe, Le Roy Hooker, Thomas W. Handford. Pg 34 removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected,The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, Volume 1. By Sir Isaac Newton, John Machin. Pg 12. and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena. Two abstract areas of modern mathematics are category theory and model theory. Bertrand Russell,In The Scientific Outlook (1931) said, \"Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say\". Though, one can substituted mathematics for real world objects, and wander off through equation after equation, and can build a concept structure which has no relation to reality.Mathematics simplified and made attractive: or, The laws of motion explained. By Thomas Fisher. Pg 15. (cf. But an abstraction not founded upon, and not consonant with Nature and (Logical) Truth, would be a falsity, an insanity.)\n\nSymbolic logic studies the purely formal properties of strings of symbols.  The interest in this area springs from two sources.  First, the notation used in symbolic logic can be seen as representing the words used in philosophical logic.  Second, the rules for manipulating symbols found in symbolic logic can be implemented on a computing machine. Symbolic logic is usually divided into two subfields, propositional logic and predicate logic.  Other logics of interest include temporal logic, modal logic and fuzzy logic. The area of symbolic logic called propositional logic, also called propositional calculus, studies the properties of sentences formed from constantsHere a logical constant is a symbol in symbolic logic that has the same meaning in all models, such as the symbol \"=\" for \"equals\".A constant, in a mathematical context, is a number that arises naturally in mathematics, such as \u03c0 or e;  Such mathematics constant value do not change. It can mean polynomial constant term  (the term of degree 0) or the constant of integration, a free parameter arising in integration. Related, the physical constant are a physical quantity generally believed to be universal and unchanging. Programming constants are a values that, unlike a variable, cannot be reassociated with a different value. and logical operators. The corresponding logical operations are known, respectively, as conjunction, disjunction, material conditional, biconditional, and negation.  These operators are denoted as keywordsThough not an index term, keywords are terms that represent information. A keyword is a word with special meaning (this is a semantic definition), while syntactically these are terminal symbols in the phrase grammar. See reserved word for the related concept. and by symbolic notation.\n\nSome of the introduced mathematical logic notation during this time included the set of symbols used in Boolean algebra. This was created by George Boole in 1854. Boole himself did not see logic as a branch of mathematics, but it has come to be encompassed anyway. Symbols found in Boolean algebra include  (AND),  (OR), and  (not).  With these symbols, and letters to represent different truth values, one can make logical statements such as , that is \"(a is true OR a is not true) is true\", meaning it is true that a is either true or not true (i.e. false). Boolean algebra has many practical uses as it is, but it also was the start of what would be a large set of symbols to be used in logic.Most of these symbols can be found in propositional calculus, a formal system described as .   is the set of elements, such as the a in the example with Boolean algebra above.   is the set that contains the subsets that contain operations, such as  or .   contains the inference rules, which are the rules dictating how inferences may be logically made, and  contains the axioms.

Predicate logic, originally called predicate calculus, expands on propositional logic by the introduction of variablesUsually denoted by x, y, z, or other lowercase letters\nHere a symbols that represents a quantity in a mathematical expression, a mathematical variable as used in many sciences.\nVariables can be symbolic name associated with a value and whose associated value may be changed, known in computer science as a variable reference. A variable can also be the operationalized way in which the attribute is represented for further data processing (e.g., a logical set of attributes). See also: Dependent and independent variables in statistics. and by sentences containing variables, called predicates.Usually denoted by an uppercase letter followed by a list of variables, such as P(x) or Q(y,z)\nHere a mathematical logic predicate, a fundamental concept in first-order logic. Grammatical predicates are grammatical components of a sentence.\nRelated is the syntactic predicate in parser technology which are guidelines for the parser process. In computer programming, a branch predication allows a choice to execute or not to execute a given instruction based on the content of a machine register. In addition, predicate logic allows quantifiers.Representing ALL and EXISTS With these logic symbols and additional quantifiers from predicate logic,e.g. \u2203 for \"there exists\" and \u2200 for \"for all\" valid proofs can be made that are irrationally artificial,See also: Dialetheism, Contradiction, and Paradox but syntactical.Related, facetious abstract nonsense describes certain kinds of arguments and methods related to category theory which resembles comical literary non sequitur devices (not illogical non sequiturs).\n\nG\u00f6del incompleteness notation\n\nWhile proving his incompleteness theorems,G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems shows that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible, giving a contested negative answer to Hilbert's second problem Kurt G\u00f6del created an alternative to the symbols normally used in logic.  He used G\u00f6del numbers, which were numbers that represented operations with set numbers, and variables with the prime numbers greater than 10.  With G\u00f6del numbers, logic statements can be broken down into a number sequence.  G\u00f6del then took this one step farther, taking the n prime numbers and putting them to the power of the numbers in the sequence.  These numbers were then multiplied together to get the final product, giving every logic statement its own number.Casti, John L. 5 Golden Rules. New York: MJF Books, 1996.For example, take the statement \"There exists a number x such that it is not y\".  Using the symbols of propositional calculus, this would become:  .\nIf the G\u00f6del numbers replace the symbols, it becomes:. There are ten numbers, so the ten prime numbers are found and these are: . Then, the G\u00f6del numbers are made the powers of the respective primes and multiplied, giving: . The resulting number is approximately .\n\nContemporary notation and topics\n\nEarly 20th-century notation\nAbstraction of notation is an ongoing process and the historical development of many mathematical topics exhibits a progression from the concrete to the abstract. Various set notations would be developed for fundamental object sets. Around 1924, David Hilbert and Richard Courant published \"Methods of mathematical physics. Partial differential equations\".Gr. Methoden Der Mathematischen Physik In 1926, Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon proposed the Klein\u2013Gordon equation to describe relativistic particles.The Klein\u2013Gordon equation is: The first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is due to Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, who, during 1920, was first able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom. In 1928, the relativistic Dirac equation was formulated by Dirac to explain the behavior of the relativistically moving electron.The Dirac equation in the form originally proposed by Dirac is:where,  is the wave function for the electron,  and  are the space and time coordinates,  is the rest mass of the electron,  is the momentum, understood to be the momentum operator in the Schr\u00f6dinger theory,  is the speed of light, and  is the reduced Planck constant. Dirac described the quantification of the electromagnetic field as an ensemble of harmonic oscillators with the introduction of the concept of creation and annihilation operators of particles. In the following years, with contributions from Wolfgang Pauli, Eugene Wigner, Pascual Jordan, and Werner Heisenberg, and an elegant formulation of quantum electrodynamics due to Enrico Fermi, physicists came to believe that, in principle, it would be possible to perform any computation for any physical process involving photons and charged particles.\n\nIn 1931, Alexandru Proca developed the Proca equation (Euler\u2013Lagrange equation)That is, for the vector meson theory of nuclear forces and the relativistic quantum field equations. John Archibald Wheeler in 1937 develops S-matrix. Studies by Felix Bloch with Arnold Nordsieck, and Victor Weisskopf, in 1937 and 1939, revealed that such computations were reliable only at a first order of perturbation theory, a problem already pointed out by Robert Oppenheimer. At higher orders in the series infinities emerged, making such computations meaningless and casting serious doubts on the internal consistency of the theory itself. With no solution for this problem known at the time, it appeared that a fundamental incompatibility existed between special relativity and quantum mechanics.\n\nIn the 1930s, the double-struck capital Z for integer number sets was created by Edmund Landau. Nicolas Bourbaki created the double-struck capital Q for rational number sets. In 1935, Gerhard Gentzen made universal quantifiers. In 1936, Tarski's undefinability theorem is stated by Alfred Tarski and proved.The theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system. In 1938, G\u00f6del proposes the constructible universe in the paper \"The Consistency of the Axiom of Choice and of the Generalized Continuum-Hypothesis\". Andr\u00e9 Weil and Nicolas Bourbaki would develop the empty set sign in 1939. That same year, Nathan Jacobson would coin the double-struck capital C for complex number sets.\n\nAround the 1930s, Voigt notationNamed to honor Voigt's 1898 work. would be developed for multilinear algebra as a way to represent a symmetric tensor by reducing its order. Sch\u00f6nflies notationNamed after Arthur Moritz Schoenflies became one of two conventions used to describe point groups (the other being Hermann\u2013Mauguin notation). Also in this time, van der Waerden notation became popular for the usage of two-component spinors (Weyl spinors) in four spacetime dimensions. Arend Heyting would introduce Heyting algebra and Heyting arithmetic.\n\nThe arrow, e.g., \u2192, was developed for function notation in 1936 by \u00d8ystein Ore to denote images of specific elements.See Galois connections.Oystein Ore would also write \"Number Theory and Its History\". Later, in 1940, it took its present form, e.g., f: X \u2192 Y, through the work of Witold Hurewicz. Werner Heisenberg, in 1941, proposed the S-matrix theory of particle interactions.\n\nthumbnail|Paul Dirac, pictured here, made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics.\nBra\u2013ket notation (Dirac notation) is a standard notation for describing quantum states, composed of angle brackets and vertical bars. It can also be used to denote abstract vectors and linear functionals. It is so called because the inner product (or dot product on a complex vector space) of two states is denoted by a bra|ket consisting of a left part, \u27e8\u03c6|, and a right part, |\u03c8\u27e9. The notation was introduced in 1939 by Paul Dirac, though the notation has precursors in Grassmann's use of the notation  [\u03c6|\u03c8] for his inner products nearly 100 years previously.\n\nBra\u2013ket notation is widespread in quantum mechanics: almost every phenomenon that is explained using quantum mechanics\u2014including a large portion of modern physics\u2014is usually explained with the help of bra\u2013ket notation. The notation establishes an encoded abstract representation-independence, producing a versatile specific representation (e.g., x, or p, or eigenfunction base) without much ado, or excessive reliance on, the nature of the linear spaces involved. The overlap expression \u27e8\u03c6|\u03c8\u27e9  is typically interpreted as the probability amplitude for the state \u03c8 to collapse into the state \u03d5. The Feynman slash notation (Dirac slash notation) was developed by Richard Feynman for the study of Dirac fields in quantum field theory.\n\nIn 1948, Valentine Bargmann and Eugene Wigner proposed the relativistic Bargmann\u2013Wigner equations to describe free particles and the equations are in the form of multi-component spinor field wavefunctions. In 1950, William Vallance Douglas Hodge presented \"The topological invariants of algebraic varieties\" at the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians. Between 1954 and 1957, Eugenio Calabi worked on the Calabi conjecture for K\u00e4hler metrics and the development of Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds. In 1957, Tullio Regge formulated the mathematical property of potential scattering in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.That the scattering amplitude can be thought of as an analytic function of the angular momentum, and that the position of the poles determine power-law growth rates of the amplitude in the purely mathematical region of large values of the cosine of the scattering angle. Stanley Mandelstam, along with Regge, did the initial development of the Regge theory of strong interaction phenomenology. In 1958, Murray Gell-Mann and Richard Feynman, along with George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak, deduced the chiral structures of the weak interaction in physics. Geoffrey Chew, along with others, would promote matrix notation for the strong interaction, and the associated bootstrap principle, in 1960. In the 1960s, set-builder notation was developed for describing a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy. Also in the 1960s, tensors are abstracted within category theory by means of the concept of monoidal category. Later, multi-index notation eliminates conventional notions used in multivariable calculus, partial differential equations, and the theory of distributions, by abstracting the concept of an integer index to an ordered tuple of indices.\n\nModern mathematical notation\n\nIn the modern mathematics of special relativity, electromagnetism and wave theory, the d'Alembert operatorThat is, Also known as the d'Alembertian or wave operator. is the Laplace operator of Minkowski space. The Levi-Civita symbolAlso known as, \"permutation symbol\" (see: permutation), \"antisymmetric symbol\" (see: antisymmetric), or \"alternating symbol\" is used in tensor calculus.\n\nAfter the full Lorentz covariance formulations that were finite at any order in a perturbation series of quantum electrodynamics, Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman were jointly awarded with a Nobel prize in physics in 1965. Their contributions, and those of Freeman Dyson, were about covariant and gauge invariant formulations of quantum electrodynamics that allow computations of observables at any order of perturbation theory. Feynman's mathematical technique, based on his diagrams, initially seemed very different from the field-theoretic, operator-based approach of Schwinger and Tomonaga, but Freeman Dyson later showed that the two approaches were equivalent. Renormalization, the need to attach a physical meaning at certain divergences appearing in the theory through integrals, has subsequently become one of the fundamental aspects of quantum field theory and has come to be seen as a criterion for a theory's general acceptability. Quantum electrodynamics has served as the model and template for subsequent quantum field theories. Peter Higgs, Jeffrey Goldstone, and others, Sheldon Glashow, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam independently showed how the weak nuclear force and quantum electrodynamics could be merged into a single electroweak force. In the late 1960s, the particle zoo was composed of the then known elementary particles before the discovery of quarks.\n\nthumbnail|Standard model of elementary particles.\n\nThe fundamental fermions and the fundamental bosons. (c.2008)Note that \"masses\" (e.g., the coherent non-definite body shape) of particles are periodically reevaluated by the scientific community. The values may have been adjusted; adjustment by operations carried out on instruments in order that it provides given indications corresponding to given values of the measurand. In engineering, mathematics, and geodesy, the optimal parameter such estimation of a mathematical model so as to best fit a data set. Based on the proprietary publication, Review of Particle Physics.For the consensus, see Particle Data Group.\n\nA step towards the Standard Model was Sheldon Glashow's discovery, in 1960, of a way to combine the electromagnetic and weak interactions.  In 1967, Steven Weinberg and Abdus Salam incorporated the Higgs mechanism into Glashow's electroweak theory, giving it its modern form. The Higgs mechanism is believed to give rise to the masses of all the elementary particles in the Standard Model. This includes the masses of the W and Z bosons, and the masses of the fermions - i.e. the quarks and leptons. Also in 1967, Bryce DeWitt published his equation under the name \"Einstein\u2013Schr\u00f6dinger equation\" (later renamed the \"Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation\").http://www.physics.drexel.edu/~vkasli/phys676/Notes%20for%20a%20brief%20history%20of%20quantum%20gravity%20-%20Carlo%20Rovelli.pdf In 1969, Yoichiro Nambu, Holger Bech Nielsen, and Leonard Susskind described space and time in terms of strings. In 1970, Pierre Ramond develop two-dimensional supersymmetries. Michio Kaku and Keiji Kikkawa would afterwards formulate string variations. In 1972, Michael Artin, Alexandre Grothendieck, Jean-Louis Verdier propose the Grothendieck universe.\n\nAfter the neutral weak currents caused by  boson exchange were discovered at CERN in 1973, the electroweak theory became widely accepted and Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering it. The theory of the strong interaction, to which many contributed, acquired its modern form around 1973\u201374. With the establishment of quantum chromodynamics, a finalized a set of fundamental and exchange particles, which allowed for the establishment of a \"standard model\" based on the mathematics of gauge invariance, which successfully described all forces except for gravity, and which remains generally accepted within the domain to which it is designed to be applied. In the late 1970s, William Thurston introduced hyperbolic geometry into the study of knots with the hyperbolization theorem. The orbifold notation system, invented by Thurston, has been developed for representing types of symmetry groups in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. In 1978, Shing-Tung Yau deduced that the Calabi conjecture have Ricci flat metrics. In 1979, Daniel Friedan showed that the equations of motions of string theory are abstractions of Einstein equations of General Relativity.\n\nThe first superstring revolution is composed of mathematical equations developed between 1984 and 1986. In 1984, Vaughan Jones deduced the Jones polynomial and subsequent contributions from Edward Witten, Maxim Kontsevich, and others, revealed deep connections between knot theory and mathematical methods in statistical mechanics and quantum field theory. According to string theory, all particles in the \"particle zoo\" have a common ancestor, namely a vibrating string. In 1985, Philip Candelas, Gary Horowitz,http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~gary/ Andrew Strominger, and Edward Witten would publish \"Vacuum configurations for superstrings\"Nuclear Physics B 258: 46\u201374, ,  Later, the tetrad formalism (tetrad index notation) would be introduced as an approach to general relativity that replaces the choice of a coordinate basis by the less restrictive choice of a local basis for the tangent bundle.A locally defined set of four linearly independent vector fields called a tetrad\n\nIn the 1990s, Roger Penrose would propose Penrose graphical notation (tensor diagram notation) as a, usually handwritten, visual depiction of multilinear functions or tensors.\"Quantum invariants of knots and 3-manifolds\" by V. G. Turaev (1994), page 71 Penrose would also introduce abstract index notation.His usage of the Einstein summation was in order to offset the inconvenience in describing contractions and covariant differentiation in modern abstract tensor notation, while maintaining explicit covariance of the expressions involved. In 1995, Edward Witten suggested M-theory and subsequently used it to explain some observed dualities, initiating the second superstring revolution.See also: String theory landscape and Swampland\n\nthumb|John H Conway, prolific mathematician of notation.\nJohn Conway would further various notations, including the Conway chained arrow notation, the Conway notation of knot theory, and the Conway polyhedron notation. The Coxeter notation system classifies symmetry groups, describing the angles between with fundamental reflections of a Coxeter group. It uses a bracketed notation, with modifiers to indicate certain subgroups.  The notation is named after H. S. M. Coxeter and Norman Johnson more comprehensively defined it.\n\nCombinatorial LCF notationDevised by Joshua Lederberg and extended by Coxeter and Frucht has been developed for the representation of cubic graphs that are Hamiltonian. The cycle notation is the convention for writing down a permutation in terms of its constituent cycles.Fraleigh 2002:89; Hungerford 1997:230 This is also called circular notation and the permutation called a cyclic or circular permutation.Dehn, Edgar. Algebraic Equations, Dover. 1930:19\n\nComputers and markup notation\n\nIn 1931, IBM produces the IBM 601 Multiplying Punch; it is an electromechanical machine that could read two numbers, up to 8 digits long, from a card and punch their product onto the same card. In 1934, Wallace Eckert used a rigged IBM 601 Multiplying Punch to automate the integration of differential equations. In 1936, Alan Turing publishes \"On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem\".Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society 42 (2)And, in 1938, \"On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem: A correction\" (Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society, 2 (1937) 43 (6): 544\u20136, .

In 1962, Kenneth E. Iverson developed an integral part notation that became known as Iverson Notation for manipulating arrays that he taught to his students, and described in his book A Programming Language. In 1970, E.F. Codd proposed relational algebra as a relational model of data for database query languages.  In 1971, Stephen Cook publishes \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\" In the 1970s within computer architecture, Quote notation was developed for a representing number system of rational numbers. Also in this decade, the Z notation (just like the APL language, long before it) uses many non-ASCII symbols, the specification includes suggestions for rendering the Z notation symbols in ASCII and in LaTeX. There are presently various C mathematical functions (Math.h) and numerical libraries. They are libraries used in software development for performing numerical calculations. These calculations can be handled by symbolic executions; analyzing a program to determine what inputs cause each part of a program to execute. Mathematica and SymPy are examples of computational software programs based on symbolic mathematics.\n\nFuture of mathematical notation\n\nthumb|A section of a quintic Calabi\u2013Yau three-fold (3D projection); recalling atomic vortex theory.\nIn the history of mathematical notation, ideographic symbol notation has come full circle with the rise of computer visualization systems. The notations can be applied to abstract visualizations, such as for rendering some projections of a Calabi-Yau manifold. Examples of abstract visualization which properly belong to the mathematical imagination can be found in computer graphics. The need for such models abounds, for example, when the measures for the subject of study are actually random variables and not really ordinary mathematical functions.\n\nSee also\n\nMain relevance Abuse of notation, Well-formed formula, Big O notation (L-notation), Dowker notation, Hungarian notation,  Infix notation, Positional notation, Polish notation (Reverse Polish notation), Sign-value notation, infix notation, History of writing numbers\n\n Numbers and quantities List of numbers, Irrational and suspected irrational numbers, \u03b3, \u03b6(3), , , , \u03c6, \u03c1, \u03b4S, \u03b1, e, \u03c0, \u03b4, Physical constants, c, \u03b50, h, G, Greek letters used in mathematics, science, and engineering\n\nGeneral relevance Order of operations, Scientific notation (Engineering notation), Actuarial notation\n\nDot notation Chemical notation (Lewis dot notation (Electron dot notation)), Dot-decimal notation\n\nArrow notation Knuth's up-arrow notation, infinitary combinatorics (Arrow notation (Ramsey theory))\n\nGeometries Projective geometry, Affine geometry, Finite geometry\n\nLists and outlines Outline of mathematics (Mathematics history topics and Mathematics topics (Mathematics categories)), Mathematical theories ( First-order theories, Theorems and Disproved mathematical ideas), Mathematical proofs (Incomplete proofs), Mathematical identities, Mathematical series, Mathematics reference tables, Mathematical logic topics, Mathematics-based methods, Mathematical functions, Transforms and Operators, Points in mathematics, Mathematical shapes, Knots (Prime knots and Mathematical knots and links), Inequalities, Mathematical concepts named after places, Mathematical topics in classical mechanics, Mathematical topics in quantum theory, Mathematical topics in relativity, String theory topics, Unsolved problems in mathematics, Mathematical jargon, Mathematical examples, Mathematical abbreviations, List of mathematical symbols\n\nMisc.

Cannon proved that the double suspension of a homology sphere is a topological sphere.J. W. Cannon, The recognition problem: what is a topological manifold?\nBulletin of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 84 (1978), no. 5, pp. 832\u2013866.J. W. Cannon, Shrinking cell-like decompositions of manifolds. Codimension three. Annals of Mathematics (2), 110 (1979), no. 1, 83\u2013112. R. D. Edwards had previously proven this in many cases.\n\nThe results of Cannon's paper were used by Cannon, Bryant and Lacher to prove (1979)J. W. Cannon, J. L. Bryant and R. C. Lacher, The structure of generalized manifolds having nonmanifold set of trivial dimension. Geometric topology (Proc. Georgia Topology Conf., Athens, Ga., 1977), pp. 261\u2013300, Academic Press, New York-London, 1979. . an important case of the so-called characterization conjecture for topological manifolds. The conjecture says that a generalized n-manifold , where , which satisfies the \"disjoint disk property\" is a topological manifold. Cannon, Bryant and Lacher established that the conjecture holds under the assumption that  be a manifold except possibly at a set of dimension . Later Frank QuinnFrank Quinn. Resolutions of homology manifolds, and the topological characterization of manifolds. Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 72 (1983), no. 2, pp. 267\u2013284. completed the proof that the characterization conjecture holds if there is even a single manifold point.  In general, the conjecture is false as was proved by John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and Shmuel Weinberger.John Bryant, Steven Ferry, Washington Mio and Shmuel Weinberger, Topology of homology manifolds, Annals of Mathematics 143 (1996), pp. 435-467; \n\n1980s: Hyperbolic geometry, 3-manifolds and geometric group theory\nIn 1980s the focus of Cannon's work shifted to the study of 3-manifolds, hyperbolic geometry and Kleinian groups and he is considered one of the key figures in the birth of geometric group theory as a distinct subject in late 1980s and early 1990s. Cannon's 1984 paper \"The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups\"J. W. Cannon, The combinatorial structure of cocompact discrete hyperbolic groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 16 (1984), no. 2, pp. 123\u2013148. was one of the forerunners in the development of the theory of word-hyperbolic groups, a notion that was introduced and developed three years later in a seminal 1987 monograph of Mikhail Gromov.M. Gromov, Hyperbolic Groups, in: \"Essays in Group Theory\" (G. M. Gersten, ed.), MSRI Publ. 8, 1987, pp. 75\u2013263. Cannon's paper explored combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of the Cayley graphs of Kleinian groups and related them to the geometric features of the actions of these groups on the hyperbolic space. In particular, Cannon proved that convex-cocompact Kleinian groups admit finite presentations where the Dehn algorithm solves the word problem. The latter condition later turned out to give one of equivalent characterization of being word-hyperbolic and, moreover, Cannon's original proof essentially went through without change to show that the word problem in word-hyperbolic groups is solvable by Dehn's algorithm.R. B. Sher, R. J. Daverman. Handbook of Geometric Topology. Elsevier, 2001. ; p. 299. Cannon's 1984 paper also introduced an important notion a cone type of an element of a finitely generated group (roughly, the set of all geodesic extensions of an element). Cannon proved that a convex-cocompact Kleinian group has only finitely many cone types (with respect to a fixed finite generating set of that group) and showed how to use this fact to conclude that the growth series of the group is a rational function. These arguments also turned out to generalize to the word-hyperbolic group context. Now standard proofs of the fact that the set of geodesic words in a word-hyperbolic group is a regular language also use finiteness of the number of cone types.\n\nCannon's work also introduced an important notion of almost convexity for Cayley graphs of finitely generated groups,James W. Cannon. Almost convex groups. Geometriae Dedicata, vol. 22 (1987), no. 2, pp. 197\u2013210. a notion that led to substantial further study and generalizations.S. Hermiller and J.

They considered the case of a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold M that fibers over the circle with the fiber being a closed hyperbolic surface S. In this case the universal cover of S, which is identified with the hyperbolic plane, admits an embedding into the universal cover of M, which is the hyperbolic 3-space. Cannon and Thurston proved that this embedding extends to a continuous \u03c01(S)-equivariant surjective map (now called the Cannon\u2013Thurston map) from the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic plane (the circle) to the ideal boundary of the hyperbolic 3-space (the 2-sphere).\nAlthough the paper of Cannon and Thurston was finally published only in 2007, in the meantime it has generated considerable further research and a number of significant generalizations (both in the contexts of Kleinian groups and of word-hyperbolic groups), including the work of Mahan Mitra,Mahan Mitra.

A. Epstein, James W. Cannon, Derek F. Holt, Silvio V. Levy, Michael S. Paterson, William P. Thurston. Word processing in groups. Jones and Bartlett Publishers, Boston, MA, 1992. . which introduced, formalized and developed the theory of automatic groups. The theory of automatic groups brought new computational ideas from computer science to geometric group theory and played an important role in the development of the subject in 1990s.\n\nA 1994 paper of Cannon gave a proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\"James W. Cannon. The combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem. Acta Mathematica 173 (1994), no. 2, pp. 155\u2013234. that was motivated by the classic Riemann mapping theorem in complex analysis. The goal was to understand when an action of a group by homeomorphisms on a 2-sphere is (up to a topological conjugation) an action on the standard Riemann sphere by M\u00f6bius transformations. The \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\" of Cannon gave a set of sufficient conditions when a sequence of finer and finer combinatorial subdivisions of a topological surface determine, in the appropriate sense and after passing to the limit, an actual conformal structure on that surface. This paper of Cannon led to an important conjecture, first explicitly formulated by Cannon and Swenson in 1998 (but also suggested in implicit form in Section 8 of Cannon's 1994 paper) and now known as Cannon's conjecture, regarding characterizing word-hyperbolic groups with the 2-sphere as the boundary. The conjecture (Conjecture 5.1 in ) states that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, then G admits a properly discontinuous cocompact isometric action on the hyperbolic 3-space (so that G is essentially a 3-dimensional Kleinian group). In analytic terms Cannon's conjecture is equivalent to saying that if the ideal boundary of a word-hyperbolic group G is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere then this boundary, with the visual metric coming from the Cayley graph of G'', is quasisymmetric to the standard 2-sphere.\n\nThe 1998 paper of Cannon and Swenson gave an initial approach to this conjecture by proving that the conjecture holds under an extra assumption that the family of standard \"disks\" in the boundary of the group satisfies a combinatorial \"conformal\" property. The main result of Cannon's 1994 paper played a key role in the proof. This approach to Cannon's conjecture and related problems was pushed further later in the joint work of Cannon, Floyd and Parry.J. W. Cannon, W. J. Floyd, W. R. Parry.

Conformal Geometry and Dynamics, vol. 10 (2006), pp. 63\u201399.\n\nCannon's conjecture motivated much of subsequent work by other mathematicians and to a substantial degree informed subsequent interaction between geometric group theory and the theory of analysis on metric spaces.M.

International Congress of Mathematicians. Vol. II, pp. 743\u2013768, Eur. Math. Soc., Z\u00fcrich, 2006. . Cannon's conjecture was motivated (see J. W. Cannon and E. L. Swenson, Recognizing constant curvature discrete groups in dimension 3. Transactions of the American Mathematical Society 350 (1998), no. 2, pp. 809\u2013849.) by Thurston's Geometrization Conjecture and by trying to understand why in dimension three variable negative curvature can be promoted to constant negative curvature. Although the Geometrization conjecture was recently settled by Perelman, Cannon's conjecture remains wide open and is considered one of the key outstanding open problems in geometric group theory and geometric topology.\n\nApplications to biology\nThe ideas of combinatorial conformal geometry that underlie Cannon's proof of the \"combinatorial Riemann mapping theorem\", were applied by Cannon, Floyd and Parry (2000) to the study of large-scale growth patterns of biological organisms.J. W. Cannon, W. Floyd and W. Parry. Crystal growth, biological cell growth and geometry. Pattern Formation in Biology, Vision and Dynamics, pp. 65\u201382. World Scientific, 2000. , . Cannon, Floyd and Parry produced a mathematical growth model which demonstrated that some systems determined by simple finite subdivision rules can results in objects (in their example, a tree trunk) whose large-scale form oscillates wildly over time even though the local subdivision laws remain the same. Cannon, Floyd and Parry also applied their model to the analysis of the growth patterns of rat tissue. They suggested that the \"negatively curved\" (or non-euclidean) nature of microscopic growth patterns of biological organisms is one of the key reasons why large-scale organisms do not look like crystals or polyhedral shapes but in fact in many cases resemble self-similar fractals. In particular they suggested (see section 3.4 of ) that such \"negatively curved\" local structure is manifested in highly folded and highly connected nature of the brain and the lung tissue.\n\nSelected publications\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSee also\n\nGeometric group theory\nLow-dimensional topology\nWord-hyperbolic group\nGeometrization conjecture\nHyperbolic manifold\nKleinian group\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nJames Cannon's webpage at BYU\n\nCategory:1943 births\nCategory:Living people\nCategory:Group theorists\nCategory:Topologists\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars\nCategory:University of Utah alumni\nCategory:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty\nCategory:Brigham Young University faculty\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:Sloan Research Fellows\nCategory:Mathematicians from Pennsylvania\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Utah\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Pennsylvania\nCategory:Latter Day Saints from Wisconsin"}
{"title": "Lambda cube", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube", "text": "alt=|frame|The lambda cube. Direction of each arrow is direction of inclusion.\n\nIn mathematical logic and type theory, the \u03bb-cube is a framework introduced by Henk Barendregt  to investigate the different dimensions in which the calculus of constructions is a generalization of the simply typed \u03bb-calculus. Each dimension of the cube corresponds to a new kind of dependency between terms and types. Here, \"dependency\" refers to the capacity of a term or type to bind a term or type. The respective dimensions of the \u03bb-cube correspond to:\n\n terms that can bind types, corresponding to polymorphism.\n types that can bind terms, corresponding to dependent types.\n types that can bind types, corresponding to (binding) type operators.\n\nThe different ways to combine these three dimension yield the 8 vertices of the cube, each corresponding to a different kind of typed system.\n\n Examples of Systems \n\n Simply typed lambda calculus \n\nThe simplest system found in the \u03bb-cube is the simply typed lambda calculus, also called \u03bb\u2192. In this system, the only way to construct an abstraction is by making a term depend on a term variable, with the rule\n\n System F \nIn System F, also named \u03bb2, there is another type of abstraction, written with a , that allows terms to depend on types, with the following rule:\n\nThe terms beginning with a  are called polymorphic, as they can be applied to different types to get different functions, similarly to polymorphic functions in ML-like languages. For instance, the polymorphic identity fun x -> xof OCaml has type 'a -> 'ameaning it can take an argument of any type and return an element of that type. This type corresponds in \u03bb2 to the type .\n\n Lambda-P \nIn the \u03bbP system, also named \u039b\u03a0, and closely related to the Logical Framework, one has so called dependent types. These are types that are allowed to depend on terms. The crucial induction rule of the system is\n\nwhere represents valid types. The new type constructor corresponds via the Curry-Howard isomorphism to a universal quantifier, and the system \u03bbP as a whole corresponds to first order logic with implication as only connective. An example of these dependent types in concrete programming is the type of vectors on a certain length: the length is a term, on which the type depends.\n\n System F\u03c9 \nIn System F\u03c9, one has the  constructor of System F, but another construction is allowed: types can be constructed from other types. This is called type constructors, and an example would be , which takes a type parameter . In concrete programming, this feature corresponds to the ability to define type constructors inside the language, rather than considering them as primitives. The previous type constructor roughly corresponds to the following definition of a trees with labeled leaves in OCaml:type tree = | Leaf of a | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree\n\n Calculus of constructions \nIn the calculus of constructions, denoted as \u03bbC in the cube, these three features cohabit, so that both types and terms can depend on types and terms. The clear border that exists in \u03bb\u2192 between terms and types is somewhat abolished, as all types except the universal  are themselves terms with a type.\n\n Formal definition \n\nAs for all systems based upon the simply typed lambda calculus, all systems in the cube are given in two steps: first, raw terms, together with a notion of \u03b2-reduction, and then typing rules that allow to type those terms.\n\nThe set of sorts is defined as , sorts are represented with the letter . There is also a set  of variables, represented by the letters . The raw terms of the eight systems of the cube are given by the following syntax:\n\nand  denoting  when  does not occur free in .\n\nThe environment, as is usual in typed systems, are given by\n\nThe notion of \u03b2-reduction is common to all systems in the cube. It is written  and given by the rulesIts reflexive, transitive closure is written .\n\nThe following typing rules are also common to all systems in the cube:The difference between the systems is in the pairs of sorts  that are allowed in the following two typing rules:\n\nThe correspondence between the systems and the pairs  allowed in the rules is the following:\n\u03bb\u2192x\u03bbPxx\u03bb2xx\u03bb\u03c9xx\u03bbP2xxx\u03bbP\u03c9xxx\u03bb\u03c9xxx\u03bbCxxxx\n\nEach direction of the cube corresponds to one pair (excluding the pair  shared by all systems), and in turn each pair corresponds to one possibility of dependency between terms and types:\n\n  allows terms to depend on terms.\n  allows types to depend on terms.\n  allows terms to depend on types.\n  allows types to depend on types.\n\nComparison between the systems\n\n\u03bb\u2192\n\nA typical derivation that can be obtained isor with the arrow shortcutclosely resembling the identity (of type ) of the usual \u03bb\u2192. Note that all types used must appear in the context, because the only derivation that can be done in an empty context is .\n\nThe computing power is quite weak, it corresponds to the extended polynomials (polynomials together with a conditional operator) .\n\n\u03bb2\n\nIn \u03bb2, such terms can be obtained aswith . If one reads  as a universal quantification, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism, this can be seen as a proof of the principle of explosion. In general, \u03bb2 adds the possibility to have impredicative types such as , that is terms quantifying over all types including themselves.The polymorphism also allows the construction of functions that were not constructible in \u03bb\u2192. More precisely, the function definable in System F are those provably total in second order Peano arithmetic. In particular, all primitive recursive functions are definable.\n\u03bbP\n\nIn \u03bbP, the ability to have types depending on terms means one can express logical predicates. For instance, the following is derivable:which corresponds, via  the Curry-Howard isomorphism, to a proof of .From the computational point of view, however, having dependent types does not enhance computational power, only the possibility to express more precise type properties.\n\nThe conversion rule is strongly needed when dealing with dependent types, because it allows to perform computation on the terms in the type. For instance, if you have  and , you need to apply the conversion rule to obtain  to be able to type .\n\u03bb\u03c9\n\nIn \u03bb\u03c9, the following operatoris definable, that is . The derivationcan be obtained already in \u03bb\u03c9, however the polymorphic  can only be defined if the rule  is also present.\n\nFrom a computing point of view, \u03bb\u03c9 is extremely strong, and has been considered as a basis for programming languages .\n\n\u03bbC\n\nThe calculus of constructions has both the predicate expressiveness of \u03bbP and the computational power of \u03bb\u03c9, so it is very powerful, both on the logical side and on the computational side.\n\n Relation to other systems \nThe system Automath is similar to \u03bb2 from a logical point of view. The ML-like languages, from a typing point of view, lie somewhere between \u03bb\u2192 and \u03bb2, as they admit a restricted kind of polymorphic types, that is the types in prenex normal form. However, because they feature some recursion operators, their computing power is greater than that of \u03bb2. The Coq system is based on an extension of \u03bbC with a linear hierarchy of universes, rather than only one untypable , and the ability to construct inductive types.\n\nPure Type Systems can be seen as a generalization of the cube, with an arbitrary set of sorts, axiom, product and abstraction rules. Conversely, the systems of the lambda cube can be expressed as Pure Type Systems with two sorts , the only axiom , and a set of rules  such that .\n\nVia the Curry-Howard isomorphism, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the systems in the lambda cube and logical systems, namely:\nSystem of the cubeLogical System\u03bb\u2192(First Order) Propositional Calculus\u03bb2Second Order Propositional Caculus\u03bb\u03c9Weakly Higher Order Propositional Calculus\u03bb\u03c9Higher Order Propositional Calculus\u03bbP(First Order) Predicate Logic\u03bbP2Second Order Predicate Calculus\u03bbP\u03c9Weak Higher Order Predicate Calculus\u03bbCCalculus of Constructions\nAll the logics are implicative (i.e. the only connectives are  and ), however one can define other connectives such as  or  in an impredicative way in second and higher order logics. In the weak higher order logics, there are variables for higher order predicates, but no quantification on those can be done.\n\nCommon properties\n\nAll systems in the cube enjoy\n the Church-Rosser property: if  and  then there exists  such that  and ;\n the subject reduction property: if  and  then ;\n the uniqueness of types: if  and  then .\n\nAll of these can be proven on generic pure type systems.\n\nAny term well-typed in a system of the cube is strongly normalizing, although this property is not common to all pure type systems. No system in the cube is Turing complete.\n\n Subtyping \nSubtyping however is not represented in the cube, even though systems like , known as higher-order bounded quantification, which combines subtyping and polymorphism are of practical interest, and can be further generalized to bounded type operators. Further extensions to  allow the definition of purely functional objects; these systems were generally developed after the lambda cube paper was published.\n\nThe idea of the cube is due to the mathematician Henk Barendregt (1991). The framework of pure type systems generalizes the lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube, as well as many other systems can be represented as instances of this general framework. This framework predates the lambda cube by a couple of years. In his 1991 paper, Barendregt also defines the corners of the cube in this framework.\n\n See also \n\n In his Habilitation \u00e0 diriger les recherches, Olivier Ridoux gives a cut-out template of the lambda cube and also a dual representation of the cube as an octahedron, where the 8 vertices are replaced by faces, as well as a dual representation as a dodecahedron, where the 12 edges are replaced by faces.\n Homotopy type theory \n\n Notes \n\n Further reading \n\n Simon Peyton Jones and Erik Meijer, 1997.

{"title": "Leonella Sgorbati", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonella_Sgorbati", "text": "Blessed Leonella Sgorbati (9 December 1940 \u2013 17 September 2006) - born Rosa Maria Sgorbati - was an Italian Roman Catholic professed religious from the Consolata Mission Sisters who served in the missions in both Kenya and in Somalia. The religious was murdered there not long after controversial comments that Pope Benedict XVI had made concerning Islam and after having worked on the continent for over three decades. Her main attention was on nursing and educating prospective nurses while she also tended to the needs of children in a children's hospital that she frequented.\n\nIn 2008 her cross was deposited in the San Bartolomeo all'Isola church.\n\nHer beatification received approval from Pope Francis on 8 November 2017 and she was beatified on 26 May 2018 in Piacenza.\n\nLife\nReligious formation\nRosa Maria Sgorbati was born on 9 December 1940 in Gazzola near Piacenza as the last of three children to Carlo Sgorbati and Giovannina (called Teresa) Vigilini. Her baptism was celebrated moments after her birth in the San Savino parish church. The Sgorbati's later relocated to Milan on 9 October 1950 for her father to find work; he died on 16 July 1951.\n\nIn her teens she desired to become a nun who worked in the missions though (at age sixteen when she announced it) her mother did not approve of this choice and asked that she wait until she turned 20. That time came and Sgorbati reaffirmed her desire to become a nun; she joined the Consolata Mission Sisters in San Fre in Cuneo on 5 May 1963 for her postulancy (which began 20 May) and made her perpetual profession of vows in November 1972 as \"Leonella\" after having made her initial profession on 22 November 1965. Sgorbati had started her novitiate on 21 November 1963 in Nepi under the guidance of Sister Paolina Emiliani.\n\nAfrican mission\nIt was during this period that Sgorbati underwent a nursing course in England from 1966 until 1968 before being sent in September 1970 to Kenya. From 1970 until 1983 she served at the Consolata Hospital Mathari in Nyeri and at the Nazareth Hospital in Kiambu on the outskirts of Nairobi acting as a midwife for a time. In mid-1983 she started her advanced studies in nursing and in 1985 became the principal tutor at the school of nursing attached to Nkubu Hospital in Meru. In November 1993 she was elected as the regional superior of the order in Kenya and retained the position until 1999. The nun spent a sabbatical in 2000 and then in 2001 spent several months in Mogadishu in Somalia looking at the potential for a new nursing school in the hospital that the SOS Children's Village managed. The \"Hermann Gmeiner School of Registered Community Nursing\" opened in 2002 with Sgorbati in charge of it. The first 34 nurses graduated from the school in 2002 with the World Health Organization awarding them with certificates and diplomas since Somalia had no government since 1991 at that stage. Sgorbati was a fluent Somali-speaker.\n\nBut she was also keen to train tutors for the nursing school and so returned to Kenya with three of her now-graduated nurses in order to register them for further training at a medical training college. But Sgorbati faced difficulties in obtaining her own re-entry visa to Mogadishu due to the new rules of the Islamic courts that now controlled the town and its environs. Yet she managed to return to Mogadishu on 13 September 2006 after having vacationed in her homeland that February.\n\nMurder\nOn 17 September 2006 she was gunned down outside her children's hospital just after 12:30 pm when she finished teaching and was crossing the road to go nine meters to the sisters' accommodation where three other nuns were waiting to have lunch with her. Her guard and driver Mohamed Osman Mahamud (a father of four) was also killed. The attack was believed to be in response to the controversial comments that Pope Benedict XVI had made in his Regensburg lecture though this was never confirmed nor substantiated. But her death did come after 15 September remarks in which the hardine cleric Sheikh Abubakar Hassan Malin told worshippers at his mosque to hunt and kill all those who offended the Prophet Mohammed. This is further exacerbated because of the several humanitarian workers and Christian volunteers slain around that time. Two gunmen emerged from taxis and kiosks and shot her in the back three or four times after the first bullet hit her thigh. Her guard shielded her and was struck down after opening fire with their attackers. One bullet had entered her back and severed an artery which caused a severe and instant hemorrhage. Sgorbati was rushed to the SOS Hospital but later died there on the operating table. Her final words were \"I forgive; I forgive; I forgive\" which she whispered to Sr. Marzia Feurra. It was at 3 pm that a plane came to take her remains to Nairobi where it arrived on 9 pm and took her remains to the Lee Funeral Home.\n\nThe morning she died she was upset at the backlash that the pope had received from his address in Regensburg. The nun went out in the morning to the nursing school and at the end of her lessons in the afternoon smiled at her guard and driver who waited for her outside. The distance across the road was nine meters but the pair made it around five or so meters when the attack occurred. En route to the hospital she was pale and feverish with transfusions being made as she sweats from the pain and blood loss. In the ambulance van, she remarked to Sisters Gianna Irene Peano and Marzia that she was \"struggling to breathe\".\n\nSomalian officials vowed justice for the nun's murder with two suspects arrested and Somalia's Islamic Courts Union launching their own investigations into the murder (the motive is still unknown); Yusuf Mohamed Siad of the UIC said that two suspects were arrested. Federico Lombardi said that the killing was a \"horrible act\" which he hoped would remain an isolated case and would not become something widespread in the region. The papal nuncio Alain Paul Charles Lebeaupin said that it was unclear whether or not her death could be attributed to religious extremism.\n\nFuneral and exhumation\nThe funeral was celebrated on 21 September in the Consolata Chapel in Nairobi with the Bishop of Djibouti Giorgio Bertin presiding. The Italian ambassador to Kenya was present as was the Kenyan United Nations representative. In his remarks Bertin said that she stressed a message of love and togetherness adding that \"together life is possible\". Her colleague at the mission in Kenya (Sr. Rose) remarked at her funeral that \"she was ever so generous\" to all she met and worked alongside. Her remains were buried in Nairobi and later exhumed for canonical inspection on 30 September 2017 before being placed in a church in Nairobi though will be buried in December there.\n\nRecognition\nPope Benedict XVI referred to the slain nun as a \"servant of love\" in his Angelus remarks to 3000 people at Castel Gandolfo.\n\nOn 13 October 2008 a Mass was celebrated for the occasion of the cross that she wore being transferred to the San Bartolomeo all'Isola church in Rome. Pope Francis venerated her cross relic on his visit to the church on 22 April 2017.\n\nBeatification\nThe process for her beatification was called for after her death and gained momentum in 2011 at the order's General Chapter in which it was agreed that the General Directorate would be advised to launch a formal application for the slain nun's beatification process. The formal request to the Mogadishu diocese was made and accepted both on 25 September 2012 at which point a formal application was made to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints.\n\nThe \"nihil obstat\" (no objections) was granted to the cause on 31 August 2013 which titled the nun as a Servant of God. The diocesan process was held in Mogadishu from its inauguration on 16 October 2013 until its solemn closure not long after on 15 January 2014. The C.C.S. validated this diocesan investigation on 19 September 2014 while the postulation compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for assessment at a later stage.

{"title": "List of first-order theories", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_first-order_theories", "text": "In mathematical logic, a first-order theory is given by a set of axioms in some\nlanguage. This entry lists some of the more common examples used in model theory and some of their properties.\n\nPreliminaries\n\nFor every natural mathematical structure there is a  signature \u03c3  listing the constants, functions, and relations of the theory together with their valences,  so that the object is naturally a \u03c3-structure.   Given a signature \u03c3 there is a unique first-order language  L\u03c3 that can be used to capture the first-order expressible facts about the \u03c3-structure.\n\nThere are two common ways to specify theories:\nList or describe a set of sentences in the language L\u03c3, called the axioms of the theory.\nGive a set of  \u03c3-structures, and define a theory to be the set of sentences in L\u03c3 holding in all these models. For example, the \"theory of finite fields\" consists of all sentences in the language of fields that are true in all finite fields.\n\nAn L\u03c3 theory may:\nbe consistent: no proof of contradiction exists;\n be satisfiable: there exists a \u03c3-structure for which the sentences of the theory are all true (by the completeness theorem, satisfiability is equivalent to consistency);\nbe complete: for any statement, either it or its negation is provable;\nhave quantifier elimination;\neliminate imaginaries;\n be finitely axiomatizable;\nbe decidable: There is an algorithm to decide which statements are provable;\nbe recursively axiomatizable;\nbe model complete or sub-model complete;\nbe \u03ba-categorical: All models of cardinality \u03ba are isomorphic;\nbe stable  or unstable;\nbe \u03c9-stable (same as totally transcendental for countable theories);\nbe superstable\nhave an atomic model;\nhave a prime model;\nhave a saturated model.\n\nPure identity theories\nThe signature of the pure identity theory is empty, with no functions, constants, or relations.\n\nPure identity theory has no (non-logical) axioms. It is decidable.\n\nOne of the few interesting properties that can be stated in the language of pure identity theory is that of being infinite.\nThis is given by an infinite set of axioms stating there are at least 2 elements, there are at least 3 elements, and so on:\n\u2203x1 \u2203x2 \u00acx1 = x2, \u2003 \u2003\u2203x1 \u2203x2 \u2203x3 \u00acx1 = x2 \u2227 \u00acx1 = x3 \u2227 \u00acx2 = x3,...\nThese axioms define the theory of an infinite set.\n\nThe opposite property of being finite cannot be stated in first-order logic for any theory that has arbitrarily large finite models: in fact any such  theory has infinite models by the compactness theorem. In general if a property can be stated by a finite number of sentences of first-order logic then the opposite property can also be stated in first-order logic, but if a property needs an infinite number of sentences then its opposite property cannot be stated in first-order logic.\n\nAny statement of pure identity theory is equivalent to either \u03c3(N) or to \u00ac\u03c3(N) for some finite subset N of the non-negative integers, where \u03c3(N) is the statement that the number of elements is in N. It is even possible to describe all possible theories in this language as follows. Any theory is either  the theory of all sets of cardinality in N for some finite subset N of the non-negative integers, or the theory of all sets whose cardinality is not in N, for some finite or infinite subset N of the non-negative integers. (There are no theories whose models are exactly sets of cardinality N if N is an infinite subset of the integers.) The complete theories are the theories of sets of cardinality n for some finite n, and the theory of infinite sets.\n\nOne special case of this is the inconsistent theory defined by the axiom \u2203x \u00acx = x. It is a perfectly good theory with many good properties: it is complete, decidable, finitely axiomatizable, and so on. The only problem is that it has no models at all. By G\u00f6del's completeness theorem, it is the only theory (for any given language) with no models.. It is not the same as the theory of the empty set (in versions of first-order logic that allow a model to be empty): the theory of the empty set has exactly one model, which has no elements.\n\nUnary relations\nA set of unary  relations Pi for i in some set I is called independent if for every two disjoint finite subsets A and B of I  there is some element x such that Pi(x) is true for i in A and false for i in B. Independence can be expressed by a set of first-order statements.\n\nThe theory of a countable number of independent unary relations is complete, but has no atomic models. It is also an example of a theory that is superstable but not totally transcendental.\n\nEquivalence relations\nThe signature of equivalence relations has one binary infix relation symbol ~, no constants, and no functions. Equivalence relations satisfy the axioms:\nReflexivity \u2200x x~x;\nSymmetry \u2200x \u2200y x~y \u2192 y~x;\nTransitivity: \u2200x \u2200y \u2200z (x~y \u2227 y~z) \u2192 x~z.\n\nSome first order properties of equivalence relations are:\n~ has an infinite number of equivalence classes;\n~ has exactly n equivalence classes (for any fixed positive integer n);\nAll equivalence classes are infinite;\nAll equivalence classes have size exactly n (for any fixed positive integer n).\n\nThe theory of an equivalence relation with exactly 2 infinite equivalence classes is an easy example of a theory which is \u03c9-categorical but not categorical for any larger cardinal.\n\nThe equivalence relation ~ should not be confused with the identity symbol '=': if x=y then x~y, but the converse is not necessarily true. Theories of equivalence relations are not all that difficult or interesting, but often give easy examples or counterexamples for various statements.\n\nThe following constructions are sometimes used to produce examples of theories with certain spectra; in fact by applying them to a small number of explicit theories T one gets examples of complete countable theories with all possible uncountable spectra. If T is a theory in some language, we define a new theory 2T by adding a new binary relation to the language, and adding axioms stating that it is an equivalence relation, such that there are an infinite number of equivalence classes all of which are models of T. It is  possible to iterate this construction transfinitely: given an ordinal \u03b1, define a new theory by adding an equivalence relation E\u03b2 for each \u03b2<\u03b1, together with axioms stating that whenever \u03b2<\u03b3 then each E\u03b3 equivalence class is the union of infinitely many E\u03b2 equivalence classes, and each E0 equivalence class is a model of T. Informally, one can visualize models of this theory as infinitely branching trees of height \u03b1 with models of T attached to all leaves.\n\nOrders\nThe signature of orders has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbols \u2264. (It is of course possible to use \u2265, < or > instead as the basic relation, with the obvious minor changes to the axioms.)\nWe define x \u2265 y, x < y, x > y as abbreviations for y \u2264 x, x \u2264 y \u2227\u00acy \u2264 x, y < x,\n\nSome first-order properties of orders: \nTransitive: \u2200x \u2200y \u2200z x \u2264 y\u2227y \u2264 z \u2192 x \u2264 z\nReflexive: \u2200x x \u2264 xAntisymmetric: \u2200x \u2200y x \u2264 y \u2227 y \u2264 x \u2192 x = yPartial: Transitive\u2227Reflexive\u2227Antisymmetric;\nLinear (or total): Partial \u2227 \u2200x \u2200y x\u2264y \u2228 y\u2264xDense: \u2200x \u2200z x < z \u2192 \u2203y x < y \u2227 y < z  (\"Between any 2 distinct elements there is another element\")\nThere is a smallest element: \u2203x \u2200y x \u2264 yThere is a largest element: \u2203x \u2200y y \u2264 xEvery element has an immediate successor: \u2200x \u2203y \u2200z x < z \u2194 y \u2264 zThe theory DLO of dense linear orders without endpoints (i.e. no smallest or largest element) is complete, \u03c9-categorical, but not categorical for any uncountable cardinal. There are 3 other very similar theories: the theory of dense linear orders with a:\n Smallest but no largest element;\n Largest but no smallest element;\n Largest and smallest element.\n\nBeing well ordered (\"any non-empty subset has a minimal element\") is not a first-order property; the usual definition involves quantifying over all subsets.\n\nLattices\nLattices can be considered either as special sorts of partially ordered sets, with a signature consisting of one binary relation symbol \u2264, or as algebraic structures with a signature consisting of two binary operations \u2227 and \u2228. The two approaches can be related  by defining  a\u2264 b to mean a\u2227b=a.\n\nFor two binary operations the axioms for a lattice are:\n Commutative laws:      Associative laws:      Absorption laws:     \n\nFor one relation \u2264 the axioms are:\nAxioms stating \u2264 is a partial order, as above.\n (existence of c=a\u2227b)\n (existence of c=a\u2228b)\n\nFirst order properties include:\n  (distributive lattices)\n  (modular lattices)\n\nHeyting algebras can be defined as lattices with certain extra first-order properties.\n\nCompleteness is not a first order property of lattices.\n\nGraphs\n\nThe signature of graphs has no constants or functions, and one binary relation symbol R, where R(x,y) is read as \"there is an edge from x to y\".\n\nThe axioms for the theory of graphs are\nSymmetric: \u2200x \u2200y R(x,y)\u2192 R(y,x)\nAnti-reflexive: \u2200x \u00acR(x,x) (\"no loops\")\n\nThe theory of random graphs has the following extra axioms for each positive integer n:\n For any two disjoint finite sets of size n, there is a point joined to all points of the first set and to no points of the second set. (For each fixed n, it is easy to write this statement in the language of graphs.)\n\nThe theory of random graphs is \u03c9 categorical, complete, and decidable, and its countable model is called the Rado graph. A statement in the language of graphs is true in this theory if and only if the probability that an n-vertex random graph models the statement tends to 1 in the limit as n goes to infinity.\n\nBoolean algebras\nThere are several different signatures and conventions used for Boolean algebras: \nThe signature has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions \u2227 and \u2228 (\"and\" and \"or\"), and one unary function \u00ac (\"not\"). This can be confusing as the functions use the same symbols as the propositional functions of first-order logic.\nIn set theory, a common convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions \u00b7 and +, and one unary function \u2212. The three functions have the same interpretation as the functions in the first convention. Unfortunately, this convention clashes badly with the next convention:\nIn algebra, the usual  convention is that the language has 2 constants, 0 and 1, and two binary functions \u00b7 and +. The function \u00b7 has the same meaning as \u2227, but a+b means a\u2228b\u2227\u00ac(a\u2227b). The reason for this is that the axioms for a Boolean algebra are then just the axioms for a ring with 1 plus \u2200x x2 = x. Unfortunately this clashes with the standard convention in set theory given above.\n\nThe axioms are:\nThe axioms for a distributive lattice (see above)\n\u2200a a\u2227\u00aca = 0, \u2200a a\u2228\u00aca = 1 (properties of negation)\nSome authors add the extra axiom \u00ac0=1, to exclude the trivial algebra with one element.\n\nTarski proved that the theory of Boolean algebras is decidable.\n\nWe write x \u2264 y as an abbreviation for x \u2227 y = x, and atom(x) as an abbreviation for \u00acx = 0 \u2227 \u2200y y\u2264x \u2192 y = 0 \u2228 y = x, read as \"x is an atom\", in other words a non-zero element with nothing between it and 0. Here are some first-order properties of Boolean algebras:\nAtomic: \u2200x x=0 \u2228 \u2203y y\u2264x \u2227 atom(y)\nAtomless: \u2200x \u00acatom(x)\nThe theory of atomless Boolean algebras is \u03c9-categorical and complete.\n\nFor any Boolean algebra B, there are several invariants defined as follows. \nthe ideal I(B) consists of elements that are the sum of an atomic and an atomless element (an element with no atoms below it).\nThe quotient algebras Bi of B are defined inductively by B0=B, Bk+1 = Bk/I(Bk).\nThe invariant m(B) is the smallest integer such that Bm+1 is trivial, or \u221e if no such integer exists.\nIf m(B) is finite, the invariant n(B) is the number of atoms of Bm(B) if this number is finite, or \u221e if this number is infinite.\nThe invariant l(B) is 0 if Bm(B) is atomic or if m(B) is \u221e, and 1 otherwise.\n\nThen two Boolean algebras are elementarily equivalent if and only if their invariants l, m, and n are the same. In other words, the values of these invariants classify the possible completions of the theory of Boolean algebras. So the possible complete theories are:\nThe trivial algebra (if this is allowed; sometimes 0\u22601 is included as an axiom.)\nThe theory with m=\u221e\nThe theories with m a natural number, n a natural number or \u221e, and l = 0 or 1 (with l = 0 if n=0).\n\nGroups\nThe signature of group theory has one constant 1 (the identity), one function of arity 1\n(the inverse) whose value on t is denoted by t\u22121, and one function \nof arity 2, which is usually omitted from terms. For any integer n. tn is an abbreviation for the obvious term for the nth power of t.\n\nGroups are defined by the axiomsIdentity: \u2200x 1x = x \u2227 x1 = xInverse: \u2200x x\u22121x = 1 \u2227 xx\u22121 = 1Associative: \u2200x\u2200y\u2200z (xy)z = x(yz)\n\nSome properties of groups that can be defined in the first-order language of groups are:\nAbelian: \u2200x \u2200y xy = yx.\nTorsion free: \u2200x x2 = 1\u2192x = 1, \u2200x x3 = 1 \u2192 x = 1, \u2200x x4 = 1 \u2192 x = 1, ...\nDivisible: \u2200x \u2203y y2 = x, \u2200x \u2203y y3 = x, \u2200x \u2203y y4 = x, ...\nInfinite (as in identity theory)\nExponent n (for any fixed positive integer n): \u2200x xn = 1\nNilpotent of class n (for any fixed positive integer n)\nSolvable of class n (for any fixed positive integer n)\n\nThe theory of abelian groups is decidable.. The theory of infinite divisible torsion-free abelian groups is complete, as is the theory of infinite abelian groups of exponent p (for p prime).\n\nThe theory of finite groups is the set of first-order statements in the language of groups that are true in all finite groups (there are plenty of infinite models of this theory). It is not completely trivial to find any such statement that is not true for all groups: one example is \n\"given two elements of order 2, either they are conjugate or there is a non-trivial element commuting with both of them\".\n\nThe properties of being finite, or free, or simple, or torsion are not first-order. More precisely, the first-order theory of all groups with one of these properties has models that do not have this property.\n\nRings and fields\nThe signature of (unital) rings has 2 constants 0 and 1, two binary functions + and \u00d7, and, optionally, one unary negation function \u2212.\n\nRings\n\nAxioms: Addition makes the ring into an abelian group, multiplication is associative and has an identity 1, and multiplication is left and right distributive.\n\nCommutative rings\n\nThe axioms for rings plus \u2200x \u2200y xy=yx.\n\nFields\n\nThe axioms for commutative rings plus \u2200x \u00ac x=0 \u2192 \u2203y xy=1 and \u00ac 1=0.   Many of the examples given here have only universal, or algebraic axioms.  The class of structures satisfying such a theory has the property of being closed under substructure.   For example, a subset of a group closed under the group actions of multiplication and inverse is again a group.  Since the signature of fields does not usually include multiplicative and additive inverse, the axioms for  inverses are not universal, and therefore a substructure of a field closed under addition and multiplication  is not always a field.   This can be remedied by adding unary inverse functions to the language.\n\nFor any positive integer n the property that all equations of degree n have a root can be expressed by a single first-order sentence:\n\u2200 a1 \u2200 a2... \u2200 an \u2203x (...((x+a1)x +a2)x+...)x+an = 0\n\nPerfect fields\n\nThe axioms for fields, plus axioms for each prime number p stating that if p 1 = 0 (i.e. the field has characteristic p), then every field element has a pth root.\n\nAlgebraically closed fields of characteristic p\n\nThe axioms for fields, plus for every positive n the axiom that all polynomials of degree n have a root, plus axioms fixing the characteristic. The classical examples of complete theories. Categorical in all uncountable cardinals. The theory ACFp has a universal domain property, in the sense that every structure N satisfying the universal axioms of  ACFp is a substructure of a sufficiently large algebraically closed field  , and additionally any two such embeddings N \u2192 M induce an automorphism of M.\n\nFinite fields\n\nThe theory of finite fields is the set of all first-order statements that are true in all finite fields. Significant examples of such statements can, for example, be given by applying the Chevalley\u2013Warning theorem, over the prime fields. The name is a little misleading as the theory has plenty of infinite models. Ax proved that the theory is decidable.\n\nFormally real fields\n\nThese are fields with the axiom \nFor every positive n, the axiom \u2200 a1 \u2200 a2... \u2200 an a1a1+a2a2+ ...+anan=0 \u2192 a1=0\u2228a2=0\u2228 ... \u2228an=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).\n\nReal closed fields\n\nAxioms: *\u2200x \u2203y x=yy \u2228 x+yy= 0.\nFor every odd positive n, the axiom stating that every polynomial of degree n has a root.\nFor every positive n, the axiom \u2200 a1 \u2200 a2... \u2200 an a1a1+a2a2+ ...+anan=0 \u2192 a1=0\u2228a2=0\u2228 ... \u2228an=0 (0 is not a non-trivial sum of squares).\n\nThe theory of real closed fields is effective and complete and therefore decidable (the Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem). The addition of further function symbols (e.g., the exponential function, the sine function) may change decidability. \n\n p-adic fields\n\n showed that the theory of p-adic fields is decidable and gave a set of axioms for it. \n\nGeometry\nAxioms for various systems of geometry usually use a typed language, with the different types corresponding to different geometric objects such as points, lines, circles, planes, and so on. The signature will often consist of binary incidence relations between objects of different types; for example, the relation that a point lies on a line. The signature may have more complicated relations; for example ordered geometry might have a ternary \"betweenness\" relation for 3 points, which says whether one lies between two others, or a \"congruence\" relation between 2 pairs of points.\n\nSome examples of axiomatized systems of geometry include ordered geometry, absolute geometry, affine geometry, Euclidean geometry, projective geometry,  and hyperbolic geometry. For each of these geometries there are many different and inequivalent systems of axioms for various dimensions. Some of these axiom systems include \"completeness\" axioms that are not first order.\n\nAs a typical example, the axioms for projective geometry use 2 types, points and lines, and a binary incidence relation between points and lines. If point and line variables are indicated by small and capital letter, and a incident to A is written as aA, then one set of axioms is\n (There is a line through any 2 distinct points a,b ...)\n (... which is unique)\n (Veblen's axiom: if ab and cd lie on intersecting lines, then so do ac and bd.)\n (Every line has at least 3 points)\n\nEuclid did not state all the axioms for Euclidean geometry explicitly, and the first complete list was given by Hilbert in Hilbert's axioms. This is not a first order axiomatization as one of Hilbert's axioms is a second order completeness axiom. Tarski's axioms are a first order axiomatization of Euclidean geometry. Tarski showed this axiom system is complete and decidable by relating it to the complete and decidable theory of real closed fields.\n\nDifferential algebra\n The theory DF of differential fields.\nThe signature is that of fields (0, 1, +, \u2212, \u00d7) together with a unary function \u2202, the derivation.\nThe axioms are those for fields together with\n\nFor this theory one can add the condition that the characteristic is p, a prime or zero,\nto get the theory DFp of differential fields of characteristic p (and similarly with the other theories below).\n\nIf K is a differential field then the field of constants \nThe theory of differentially perfect fields is the theory of differential fields together with the condition that the field of constants is perfect; in other words, for each prime p it has the axiom:\n\n(There is little point in demanding that the whole field should be a perfect field, because in non-zero characteristic this implies the differential is 0.)\nFor technical reasons to do with quantifier elimination, it is sometimes more convenient to force the constant field to be perfect by adding a new symbol r to the signature with the axioms\n\n The theory of differentially closed fields (DCF) is the theory of differentially perfect fields with axioms saying that if f and g are  differential polynomials and the separant of f is nonzero  and g\u22600 and  f has order greater than that of g, then there is some x in the field with f(x)=0 and g(x)\u22600.\n\nAddition\nThe theory of the natural numbers with a successor function has signature consisting of a constant 0 and a unary function S (\"successor\": S(x) is interpreted as x+1), and has axioms:\n \u2200x \u00ac Sx = 0\n \u2200x\u2200y Sx = Sy \u2192 x = y\nLet P(x) be a first-order formula with a single free variable x. Then the following formula is an axiom:\n(P(0) \u2227 \u2200x(P(x)\u2192P(Sx))) \u2192 \u2200y P(y).\nThe last axiom (induction) can be replaced by the axioms\nFor each integer n>0, the axiom \u2200x SSS...Sx \u2260 x (with n copies of S)\n \u2200x \u00ac x = 0 \u2192 \u2203y Sy = x\n\nThe theory of the natural numbers with a successor function is complete and decidable, and is \u03ba-categorical for uncountable \u03ba but not for countable \u03ba.\n\nPresburger arithmetic is the theory of the natural numbers under addition, with signature consisting of a constant 0, a unary function S, and a binary function +. It is complete and decidable. The axioms are \n \u2200x \u00ac Sx = 0\n \u2200x\u2200y Sx = Sy \u2192 x = y\n \u2200x x + 0 = x\n \u2200x\u2200y x + Sy = S(x + y)\nLet P(x) be a first-order formula with a single free variable x. Then the following formula is an axiom:\n(P(0) \u2227 \u2200x(P(x)\u2192P(Sx))) \u2192 \u2200y P(y).\n\nArithmetic\nMany of the first order theories described above can be extended to complete recursively enumerable consistent theories. This is no longer true for most of the following theories; they can usually encode both multiplication and addition of natural numbers, and this gives them enough power to encode themselves, which implies that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem applies and the theories can no longer be both complete and recursively enumerable (unless they are inconsistent).\n\nThe signature of a theory of arithmetic has:\nThe constant 0;\nThe unary function, the successor function, here denoted by prefix S, or by prefix \u03c3 or postfix \u2032 elsewhere;\nTwo binary functions, denoted by infix + and \u00d7, called \"addition\" and \"multiplication.\"\nSome authors take the signature to contain a constant 1 instead of the function S, then define S in the obvious way as  St = 1 + t.\n\nRobinson arithmetic (also called Q). Axioms (1) and (2) govern the distinguished element 0. (3) assures that S is an injection. Axioms (4) and (5) are the standard recursive definition of addition; (6) and (7) do the same for multiplication.  Robinson arithmetic  can be thought of as  Peano arithmetic without induction. Q is  a weak theory for which G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem holds.\nAxioms:\n \u2200x \u00ac Sx = 0\n \u2200x \u00ac x = 0 \u2192 \u2203y Sy = x \u2200x\u2200y Sx = Sy \u2192 x = y \u2200x x + 0 = x \u2200x\u2200y x + Sy = S(x + y)\n \u2200x x \u00d7 0 = 0\n \u2200x\u2200y x \u00d7 Sy = (x \u00d7 y) + x.\n\nI\u03a3n is first order Peano arithmetic with induction restricted to \u03a3n formulas (for n = 0, 1, 2, ...). The theory I\u03a30 is often denoted by I\u03940. This is a series of more and more powerful fragments of Peano arithmetic. The case n\u00a0=\u00a01 has about the same strength as  primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA).\nExponential function arithmetic (EFA) is I\u03a30 with an axiom stating that xy exists for all x and y (with the usual properties).\n\nFirst order Peano arithmetic, PA. The \"standard\" theory of arithmetic. The axioms are the axioms of Robinson arithmetic above, together with the axiom scheme of induction:\n  for any formula \u03c6 in the language of PA. \u03c6 may contain free variables other than x.\nKurt G\u00f6del's  1931 paper proved that PA is incomplete, and has no consistent recursively enumerable completions.\n\nComplete arithmetic (also known as true arithmetic) is the theory of the standard model of arithmetic, the natural numbers N. It is complete but does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms.\n\nFor the real numbers, the situation is slightly different: The case that includes just addition and multiplication cannot encode the integers, and hence G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem does not apply. Complications arise when adding further function symbols (e.g., exponentiation).\n\nSecond order arithmetic\nSecond-order arithmetic can refer to a first order theory (in spite of the name) with two types of variables, thought of as varying over integers and subsets of the integers. (There is also a theory of arithmetic in second order logic that is called second order arithmetic. It has only one model, unlike the corresponding theory in first order logic, which is incomplete.) The signature will typically be the signature 0, S, +, \u00d7 of arithmetic, together with a membership relation \u2208 between integers and subsets (though there are numerous minor variations).  The axioms are those of Robinson arithmetic, together with axiom schemes of induction and comprehension.\n\nThere are  many different subtheories of second order arithmetic that differ in which formulas are allowed in the induction and comprehension schemes. \nIn order of increasing strength, five of the most common  systems\nare \n, Recursive Comprehension\n, Weak K\u00f6nig's lemma\n, Arithmetical comprehension\n, Arithmetical Transfinite Recursion\n,  comprehension\nThese are defined in detail in the articles on second order arithmetic and reverse mathematics.\n\nSet theories\nThe usual signature of set theory has one binary relation \u2208, no constants, and no functions. Some of the theories below are \"class theories\" which have two sorts of object, sets and classes. There are three common ways of handling this in first-order logic:\nUse first-order logic with two types.\nUse ordinary first-order logic, but add a new unary predicate \"Set\", where \"Set(t)\" means informally \"t is a set\".\nUse ordinary first-order logic, and instead of adding a new predicate to the language, treat \"Set(t)\" as an abbreviation for \"\u2203y t\u2208y''\"\n\nSome first order set theories include:\nWeak theories lacking powersets:\nS'  (Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson, 1953); (finitely axiomatizable)\nKripke\u2013Platek set theory; KP;\nPocket set theory\nGeneral set theory;\nMac Lane set theory and  elementary topos theory\nZermelo set theory; Z\nZermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory; ZF, ZFC;\nVon Neumann\u2013Bernays\u2013G\u00f6del set theory; NBG; (finitely axiomatizable)\nAckermann set theory;\nScott\u2013Potter set theory\nNew Foundations; (finitely axiomatizable)\nPositive set theory\nMorse\u2013Kelley set theory; MK;\nTarski\u2013Grothendieck set theory; TG;\n\nSome extra first order axioms that can be added to one of these (usually ZF) include:\naxiom of choice, axiom of dependent choice\nGeneralized continuum hypothesis\nMartin's axiom (usually together with the negation of the continuum hypothesis), Martin's maximum\n\u25ca and \u2663\nAxiom of constructibility (V=L)\nproper forcing axiom\nanalytic determinacy, projective determinacy, Axiom of determinacy\nMany large cardinal axioms\n\nSee also\n\nGlossary of areas of mathematics\nList of mathematical theories\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n\nFirst-order theories, List of\nFirst-order theories, List of\nFirst-order theories"}

Schirn\u2019s research during this time focused on theories of meaning and intensional semantics. He continued working in this area at the University of California at Berkeley, St. John\u2019s College (Oxford), Harvard University and at Wolfson College (Oxford). In 1985, Schirn was awarded his habilitation at the University of Regensburg. Since 1987 he has held a distinguished Fiebiger-Professorship at the University of Munich (LMU) and since 2012 he has been a member of the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy. He has also taught at the University of Minnesota (1989), the State University of Campinas (1991), the Catholic University of S\u00e3o Paulo (1998), the National University of Buenos Aires (1992), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1993, 1994, 1997), the National University San Marcos in Lima (2009) and numerous other universities in Europe and Latin America. Schirn has published in Mind, The Philosophical Quarterly, The Philosophical Review, Synthese, Erkenntnis, Axiomathes, The Journal of Symbolic Logic, Reports on Mathematical Logic, History and Philosophy of Logic, Logique et Analyse, The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Metascience, Dialectica, Grazer Philosophische Studien, Kantstudien, Archiv f\u00fcr Geschichte der Philosophie, Theoria, Cr\u00edtica, Manuscrito and other international journals. He has given invited lectures at the most prestigious universities in Europe, Asia, Latin America and South Africa as well as at some of the most distinguished universities in the United States of America and Australia. In 2014, he delivered a series of lectures on Frege\u2019s philosophy of mathematics at the University of Oxford and carried out related research at Wolfson College. In the same year, he was invited to work as a research professor at Kyoto University and received a research fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.\n\nResearch\nSchirn has made contributions to the philosophy of language and epistemology and is best known for his work on Frege\u2019s logic and philosophy of mathematics as well as on Hilbert\u2019s metamathematics and related issues in the history and philosophy of logic and the foundations of mathematics. Concerning Frege\u2019s philosophy of mathematics, Schirn has more recently focused and published on the introduction of logical objects by means of second-order abstraction principles, their logical, semantic and epistemological nature, the problem of referential indeterminacy of abstract singular terms to which those principles give rise in a Fregean context, the foundations of real analysis and of geometry and last but not least on some aspects of neo-logicism. In a series of articles co-authored by Karl-Georg Niebergall, Niebergall and Schirn presented Hilbert\u2019s finitist proof-theoretic approach in a new light by paying close attention to the development of his metamathematical work in the period 1922-1939 and by using the logical resources of modern proof theory. One important result of their published work is that Peano Arithmetic proves its own consistency indirectly in one step and that recursively enumerable extensions of QF-IA (QF = quantifier free  \u2014 IA = induction axiom) likewise prove their own consistency indirectly in one step. Schirn and Niebergall are also known for their analysis of Hilbert\u2019s extensions of the finitist point of view in the light of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems and their attempted refutation of W. W.

{"title": "Mechanism (philosophy)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_%28philosophy%29", "text": "Mechanism is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artefacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.\n\nThe doctrine of mechanism in philosophy comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of metaphysics, but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as universal mechanism and anthropic mechanism.\n\n Universal mechanism \n\nThe older doctrine, here called universal mechanism, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with materialism and reductionism, especially that of the atomists and to a large extent, stoic physics. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles\u2014that is, the motion and collision of matter. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the scientific revolution had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going determinism: if all phenomena could be explained entirely through the motion of matter under the laws of classical physics, then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, all phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern quantum mechanics is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)\n\nThe French mechanist and determinist Pierre Simon de Laplace formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:\n\nOne of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of Leviathan by Thomas Hobbes (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that Ren\u00e9 Descartes was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the philosophy of mind, he is remembered for introducing the mind\u2013body problem in terms of dualism and physicalism.\n\nDescartes was a substance dualist, and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended matter, on the one hand, and immaterial mind, on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:\n\n\"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine\u2019s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels.\" (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)\n\nHis scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic automata. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.\n\nIsaac Newton ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, action at a distance of gravity. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French philosophers such as Julien Offray de La Mettrie and Denis Diderot (see also: French materialism).\n\n Anthropic mechanism \n\nThe thesis in anthropic mechanism is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may also believe that), but rather that everything about human beings can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.\n\nOne of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human mind; Descartes, for one, endorsed dualism in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by Julien Offray de La Mettrie in his Man a Machine (1748).\n\nThe main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind \u2014 and consciousness, in particular \u2014 and free will. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in philosophy of mind they argue that if matter is devoid of mental properties then the phenomenon of consciousness cannot be explained by mechanistic principles acting on matter. In metaphysics anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which is incompatible with our experience of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include Norman Malcolm and\nDavid Chalmers.\n\nAnthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies eliminative materialism in philosophy of mind, and hard determinism on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher Paul Churchland. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.Hans Jonas, The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175. The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the arguments given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by \"consciousness\" and \"free will,\" they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist physicalist theories of mind, and for compatibilism on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include J. J. C. Smart and Daniel Dennett.\n\nG\u00f6delian arguments\nSome scholars have debated over what, if anything, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church-Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.\n\nG\u00f6delian arguments claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the G\u00f6delian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.\n\nHowever, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent \"idealized version\" H of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of H (otherwise H is provably inconsistent); and that G\u00f6del's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. Cambridge University Press, 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of G\u00f6del's incompleteness results': \"The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail.\" This consensus that G\u00f6delian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in Artificial Intelligence: \"any attempt to utilize (G\u00f6del's incompleteness results) to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis.\"LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why G\u00f6del's theorem cannot refute computationalism. Artificial Intelligence, 104:265\u2013286, 1998.\n\nHistory\nOne of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by G\u00f6del himself in his 1951 Gibbs Lecture entitled \"Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications\".G\u00f6del, Kurt, 1951, Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications in  Solomon Feferman, ed., 1995. Collected works / Kurt G\u00f6del, Vol. III. Oxford University Press: 304-23.  In this lecture, G\u00f6del uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist Diophantine equations for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. G\u00f6del finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a \"certain fact\".\n\nIn subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, Hilary Putnam published a paper entitled \"Minds and Machines,\" in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.Putnam, Hilary, 1960, Minds and Machines in Sidney Hook, ed., Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. Minds and Machines. Prentice-Hall: 77.  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between \"what can be mechanically proven\" and \"what can be seen to be true by humans\" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:\n\nLet T be a Turing machine which \"represents\" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using G\u00f6del's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T \"represents\" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.\n\nHilary Putnam objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. G\u00f6del's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use G\u00f6del's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while G\u00f6del's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.The G\u00f6del Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by Hilary Putnam in the G\u00f6del centenary 2006  \n\nJ. R. Lucas in Minds, Machines and G\u00f6del (1961), and later in his book The Freedom of the Will (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.Lucas, J. R., 1961, \"Minds, Machines, and G\u00f6del.\" Philosophy 36:112-27.  Lucas admits that, by G\u00f6del's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own website.\n\nAnother work was done by Judson Webb in his 1968 paper \"Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind\".Webb, Judson, 1968, \"Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind,\" Philosophy of Science 35: 156\u201378.  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the G\u00f6delian statement p pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of G\u00f6del's theorems, namely, that of Raymond Smullyan and Emil Post, Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of p. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of G\u00f6del's theorems are really arguments about whether the Church-Turing thesis is true.\n\nLater, Roger Penrose entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, The Emperor's New Mind  (1989) [ENM] and Shadows of the Mind (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  Martin Davis responded to ENM in his paper \"Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?\" (ps), where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  Solomon Feferman gives a critical examination of SM in his paper \"Penrose's G\u00f6delian argument\" (pdf). The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive G\u00f6delian argument \"a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion\".\n\nA G\u00f6del-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in Douglas Hofstadter's book G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid, though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:\n\nLooked at this way, G\u00f6del's proof suggests \u2013 though by no means does it prove! \u2013 that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist \u2013 not even in principle \u2013 on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.\nIt is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in Peano arithmetic, no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G \u2013 despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the G\u00f6del sentence is true.\n\nWhat might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or \"soulistically\" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be \"emergent\" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone\n  (G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach, p. 708).http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm\n\n See also \n\nAutomaton\nCausality\nDigital philosophy\nNeural Darwinism in relation to anthropic mechanism\nPhilosophy of physics\nTeleomechanism\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n An overview of attempts to define \"life\"\n \n\n \"The Problem of Mechanism\" by David L.

{"title": "Mereology", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mereology", "text": "In philosophy and mathematical logic, mereology (from the Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 meros (root: \u03bc\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5- mere-, \"part\") and the suffix -logy \"study, discussion, science\") is the study of parts and the wholes they form.  Whereas set theory is founded on the membership relation between a set and its elements, mereology emphasizes the meronomic relation between entities, which\u2014from a set-theoretic perspective\u2014is closer to the concept of inclusion between sets.\n\nMereology has been explored in various ways as applications of predicate logic to formal ontology, in each of which mereology is an important part. Each of these fields provides its own axiomatic definition of mereology. A common element of such axiomatizations is the assumption, shared with inclusion, that the part-whole relation orders its universe, meaning that everything is a part of itself (reflexivity), that a part of a part of a whole is itself a part of that whole (transitivity), and that two distinct entities cannot each be a part of the other (antisymmetry), thus forming a poset.  A variant of this axiomatization denies that anything is ever part of itself (irreflexivity) while accepting transitivity, from which antisymmetry follows automatically.\n\nAlthough mereology is an application of mathematical logic, what could be argued to be a sort of \"proto-geometry\", it has been wholly developed by logicians, ontologists, linguists, engineers, and computer scientists, especially those working in artificial intelligence. In particular, mereology is also on the basis for a point-free foundation of geometry (see for example the quoted pioniering paper of Alfred Tarski and the review paper by Gerla 1995).\n\n\"Mereology\" can also refer to formal work in general systems theory on system decomposition and parts, wholes and boundaries (by, e.g., Mihajlo D. Mesarovic (1970), Gabriel Kron (1963), or Maurice Jessel (see Bowden (1989, 1998)). A hierarchical version of Gabriel Kron's Network Tearing was published by Keith Bowden (1991), reflecting David Lewis's ideas on gunk. Such ideas appear in theoretical computer science and physics, often in combination with sheaf theory, topos, or category theory. See also the work of Steve Vickers on (parts of) specifications in computer science, Joseph Goguen on physical systems, and Tom Etter (1996, 1998) on link theory and quantum mechanics.\n\nHistory\nInformal part-whole reasoning was consciously invoked in metaphysics and ontology from Plato (in particular, in the second half of the Parmenides) and Aristotle onwards, and more or less unwittingly in 19th-century mathematics until the triumph of set theory around 1910. Ivor Grattan-Guinness (2001) sheds much light on part-whole reasoning during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and reviews how Cantor and Peano devised set theory. In seventh century India, parts and wholes were studied extensively by Dharmakirti (see Dunne, John D., 2004. Foundations of Dharmakirti's Philosophy. Wisdom Publications.). In Europe, however, it appears that the first to reason consciously and at length about parts and wholes was Edmund Husserl, in 1901, in the second volume of Logical Investigations \u2013 Third Investigation: \"On the Theory of Wholes and Parts\" (Husserl 1970 is the English translation). However, the word \"mereology\" is absent from his writings, and he employed no symbolism even though his doctorate was in mathematics.\n\nStanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski coined \"mereology\" in 1927, from the Greek word \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (m\u00e9ros, \"part\"), to refer to a formal theory of part-whole he devised in a series of highly technical papers published between 1916 and 1931, and translated in Le\u015bniewski (1992). Le\u015bniewski's student Alfred Tarski, in his Appendix E to Woodger (1937) and the paper translated as Tarski (1984), greatly simplified Le\u015bniewski's formalism. Other students (and students of students) of Lesniewski elaborated this \"Polish mereology\" over the course of the 20th century. For a good selection of the literature on Polish mereology, see Srzednicki and Rickey (1984). For a survey of Polish mereology, see Simons (1987). Since 1980 or so, however, research on Polish mereology has been almost entirely historical in nature.\n\nA. N. Whitehead planned a fourth volume of Principia Mathematica, on geometry, but never wrote it. His 1914 correspondence with Bertrand Russell reveals that his intended approach to geometry can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, as mereological in essence. This work culminated in Whitehead (1916) and the mereological systems of Whitehead (1919, 1920).\n\nIn 1930, Henry S. Leonard completed a Harvard Ph.D. dissertation in philosophy, setting out a formal theory of the part-whole relation. This evolved into the \"calculus of individuals\" of Goodman and Leonard (1940). Goodman revised and elaborated this calculus in the three editions of Goodman (1951). The calculus of individuals is the starting point for the post-1970 revival of mereology among logicians, ontologists, and computer scientists, a revival well-surveyed in Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999).\n\nAxioms and primitive notions\n\nReflexivity: A basic choice in defining a mereological system, is whether to consider things to be parts of themselves. In naive set theory a similar question arises: whether a set is to be considered a \"subset\" of itself. In both cases, \"yes\" gives rise to paradoxes analogous to Russell's paradox: Let there be an object O such that every object that is not a proper part of itself is a proper part of O. Is O a proper part of itself? No, because no object is a proper part of itself; and yes, because it meets the specified requirement for inclusion as a proper part of O. In set theory, a set is often termed an improper subset of itself. Given such paradoxes, mereology requires an axiomatic formulation.\n\nA mereological \"system\" is a first-order theory (with identity) whose universe of discourse consists of wholes and their respective parts, collectively called objects. Mereology is a collection of nested and non-nested axiomatic systems, not unlike the case with modal logic.\n\nThe treatment, terminology, and hierarchical organization below follow Casati and Varzi (1999: Ch. 3) closely. For a more recent treatment, correcting certain misconceptions, see Hovda (2008). Lower-case letters denote variables ranging over objects. Following each symbolic axiom or definition is the number of the corresponding formula in Casati and Varzi, written in bold.\n\nA mereological system requires at least one primitive binary relation (dyadic predicate). The most conventional choice for such a relation is parthood (also called \"inclusion\"), \"x is a part of y\", written Pxy. Nearly all systems require that parthood partially order the universe. The following defined relations, required for the axioms below, follow immediately from parthood alone:\nAn immediate defined predicate is \"x is a proper part of y\", written PPxy, which holds (i.e., is satisfied, comes out true) if Pxy is true and Pyx is false. Compared to parthood (which is a partial order), ProperPart is a strict partial order.\n 3.3\nAn object lacking proper parts is an atom. The mereological universe consists of all objects we wish to think about, and all of their proper parts:\nOverlap: x and y overlap, written Oxy, if there exists an object z such that Pzx and Pzy both hold.\n 3.1\nThe parts of z, the \"overlap\" or \"product\" of x and y, are precisely those objects that are parts of both x and y.\nUnderlap: x and y underlap, written Uxy, if there exists an object z such that x and y are both parts of z.\n 3.2\nOverlap and Underlap are reflexive, symmetric, and intransitive.\n\nSystems vary in what relations they take as primitive and as defined. For example, in extensional mereologies (defined below), parthood can be defined from Overlap as follows:\n 3.31\n\nThe axioms are:\nParthood partially orders the universe:\nM1, Reflexive: An object is a part of itself.\n P.1\nM2, Antisymmetric: If Pxy and Pyx both hold, then x and y are the same object.\n P.2\nM3, Transitive: If Pxy and Pyz, then Pxz.\n P.3\nM4, Weak Supplementation: If PPxy holds, there exists a z such that Pzy holds but Ozx does not.\n P.4 Weak supplementation is a theorem in Finitist set theory.\n\nM5, Strong Supplementation: If Pyx does not hold, there exists a z such that Pzy holds but Ozx does not.\n P.5\n\nM5', Atomistic Supplementation: If Pxy does not hold, then there exists an atom z such that Pzx holds but Ozy does not.\n P.5' \n\nTop: There exists a \"universal object\", designated W, such that PxW holds for any x.\n 3.20\nTop is a theorem if M8 holds.\n\nBottom: There exists an atomic \"null object\", designated N, such that PNx holds for any x.\n 3.22\n\nM6, Sum: If Uxy holds, there exists a z, called the \"sum\" or \"fusion\" of x and y, such that the objects overlapping of z are just those objects that overlap either x or y.\n P.6\nM7, Product: If Oxy holds, there exists a z, called the \"product\" of x and y, such that the parts of z are just those objects that are parts of both x and y.\n P.7\nIf Oxy does not hold, x and y have no parts in common, and the product of x and y is undefined.\nM8, Unrestricted Fusion: Let \u03c6(x) be a first-order formula in which x is a free variable. Then the fusion of all objects satisfying \u03c6 exists.\n P.8\nM8 is also called \"General Sum Principle\", \"Unrestricted Mereological Composition\", or \"Universalism\". M8 corresponds to the principle of unrestricted comprehension of naive set theory, which gives rise to Russell's paradox. There is no mereological counterpart to this paradox simply because parthood, unlike set membership, is reflexive.\n\nM8', Unique Fusion: The fusions whose existence M8 asserts are also unique. P.8' \nM9, Atomicity: All objects are either atoms or fusions of atoms.\n P.10\n\nVarious systems\nSimons (1987), Casati and Varzi (1999) and Hovda (2008) describe many mereological systems whose axioms are taken from the above list. We adopt the boldface nomenclature of Casati and Varzi. The best-known such system is the one called classical extensional mereology, hereinafter abbreviated CEM (other abbreviations are explained below). In CEM, P.1 through P.8'  hold as axioms or are theorems. M9, Top, and Bottom are optional.\n\nThe systems in the table below are partially ordered by inclusion, in the sense that, if all the theorems of system A are also theorems of system B, but the converse is not necessarily true, then B includes A. The resulting Hasse diagram is similar to that in Fig. 2, and Fig. 3.2 in Casati and Varzi (1999: 48).\n\nLabelNameSystemIncluded AxiomsM1-M3Parthood is a partial orderMM1\u2013M3M4Weak SupplementationMMM, M4M5Strong SupplementationEMM, M5M5'Atomistic Supplementation  M6General Sum Principle (Sum) M7ProductCEMEM, M6\u2013M7M8Unrestricted FusionGMM, M8  GEMEM, M8M8'Unique FusionGEMEM, M8'M9AtomicityAGEMM2, M8, M9  AGEMM, M5', M8\n\nThere are two equivalent ways of asserting that the universe is partially ordered: Assume either M1\u2013M3, or that Proper Parthood is transitive and asymmetric, hence a strict partial order. Either axiomatization results in the system M. M2 rules out closed loops formed using Parthood, so that the part relation is well-founded. Sets are well-founded if the axiom of regularity is assumed. The literature contains occasional philosophical and common-sense objections to the transitivity of Parthood.\n\nM4 and M5 are two ways of asserting supplementation, the mereological analog of set complementation, with M5 being stronger because M4 is derivable from M5. M and M4 yield minimal mereology, MM. MM, reformulated in terms of Proper Part, is Simons's (1987) preferred minimal system.\n\nIn any system in which M5 or M5' are assumed or can be derived, then it can be proved that two objects having the same proper parts are identical. This property is known as Extensionality, a term borrowed from set theory, for which extensionality is the defining axiom. Mereological systems in which Extensionality holds are termed extensional, a fact denoted by including the letter E in their symbolic names.\n\nM6 asserts that any two underlapping objects have a unique sum; M7 asserts that any two overlapping objects have a unique product. If the universe is finite or if Top is assumed, then the universe is closed under sum. Universal closure of Product and of supplementation relative to W requires Bottom. W and N are, evidently, the mereological analog of the universal and empty sets, and Sum and Product are, likewise, the analogs of set-theoretical union and intersection. If M6 and M7 are either assumed or derivable, the result is a mereology with closure.\n\nBecause Sum and Product are binary operations, M6 and M7 admit the sum and product of only a finite number of objects. The fusion axiom, M8, enables taking the sum of infinitely many objects. The same holds for Product, when defined. At this point, mereology often invokes set theory, but any recourse to set theory is eliminable by replacing a formula with a quantified variable ranging over a universe of sets by a schematic formula with one free variable. The formula comes out true (is satisfied) whenever the name of an object that would be a member of the set (if it existed) replaces the free variable. Hence any axiom with sets can be replaced by an axiom schema with monadic atomic subformulae. M8 and M8' are schemas of just this sort. The syntax of a first-order theory can describe only a denumerable number of sets; hence, only denumerably many sets may be eliminated in this fashion, but this limitation is not binding for the sort of mathematics contemplated here.\n\nIf M8 holds, then W exists for infinite universes. Hence, Top need be assumed only if the universe is infinite and M8 does not hold. Top (postulating W) is not controversial, but Bottom (postulating N) is. Le\u015bniewski rejected Bottom, and most mereological systems follow his example (an exception is the work of Richard Milton Martin). Hence, while the universe is closed under sum, the product of objects that do not overlap is typically undefined. A system with W but not N is isomorphic to:\n A Boolean algebra lacking a 0\n A join semilattice bounded from above by 1. Binary fusion and W interpret join and 1, respectively.\nPostulating N renders all possible products definable, but also transforms classical extensional mereology into a set-free model of Boolean algebra.\n\nIf sets are admitted, M8 asserts the existence of the fusion of all members of any nonempty set. Any mereological system in which M8 holds is called general, and its name includes G. In any general mereology, M6 and M7 are provable. Adding M8 to an extensional mereology results in general extensional mereology, abbreviated GEM; moreover, the extensionality renders the fusion unique. On the converse, however, if the fusion asserted by M8 is assumed unique, so that M8' replaces M8, then\u2014as Tarski (1929) had shown\u2014M3 and M8' suffice to axiomatize GEM, a remarkably economical result. Simons (1987: 38\u201341) lists a number of GEM theorems.\n\nM2 and a finite universe necessarily imply Atomicity, namely that everything either is an atom or includes atoms among its proper parts. If the universe is infinite, Atomicity requires M9. Adding M9 to any mereological system, X results in the atomistic variant thereof, denoted AX. Atomicity permits economies, for instance, assuming that M5' implies Atomicity and extensionality, and yields an alternative axiomatization of AGEM.\n\nSet theory\nThe notion of \"subset\" in set theory is not entirely the same as the notion of \"subpart\" in mereology Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski rejected set theory (a related to but not the same as nominalism (see https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-metaphysics/). For a long time, nearly all philosophers and mathematicians avoided mereology, seeing it as tantamount to a rejection of set theory. Goodman too was a nominalist, and his fellow nominalist Richard Milton Martin employed a version of the calculus of individuals throughout his career, starting in 1941.\n\nMuch early work on mereology was motivated by a suspicion that set theory was ontologically suspect, and that Occam's razor requires that one minimise the number of posits in one's theory of the world and of mathematics. Mereology replaces talk of \"sets\" of objects with talk of \"sums\" of objects, objects being no more than the various things that make up wholes.\n\nMany logicians and philosophers reject these motivations, on such grounds as: \n They deny that sets are in any way ontologically suspect\n Occam's razor, when applied to abstract objects like sets, is either a dubious principle or simply false\n Mereology itself is guilty of proliferating new and ontologically suspect entities such as fusions.\nFor a survey of attempts to found mathematics without using set theory, see Burgess and Rosen (1997).\n\nIn the 1970s, thanks in part to Eberle (1970), it gradually came to be understood that one can employ mereology regardless of one's ontological stance regarding sets. This understanding is called the \"ontological innocence\" of mereology. This innocence stems from mereology being formalizable in either of two equivalent ways:\nQuantified variables ranging over a universe of sets\nSchematic predicates with a single free variable.\nOnce it became clear that mereology is not tantamount to a denial of set theory, mereology became largely accepted as a useful tool for formal ontology and metaphysics.\n\nIn set theory, singletons are \"atoms\" that have no (non-empty) proper parts; many consider set theory useless or incoherent (not \"well-founded\") if sets cannot be built up from unit sets. The calculus of individuals was thought to require that an object either have no proper parts, in which case it is an \"atom\", or be the mereological sum of atoms. Eberle (1970), however, showed how to construct a calculus of individuals lacking \"atoms\", i.e., one where every object has a \"proper part\" (defined below) so that the universe is infinite.\n\nThere are analogies between the axioms of mereology and those of standard Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZF), if Parthood is taken as analogous to subset in set theory. On the relation of mereology and ZF, also see Bunt (1985). One of the very few contemporary set theorists to discuss mereology is Potter (2004).\n\nLewis (1991) went further, showing informally that mereology, augmented by a few ontological assumptions and plural quantification, and some novel reasoning about singletons, yields a system in which a given individual can be both a member and a subset of another individual. In the resulting system, the axioms of ZFC (and of Peano arithmetic) are theorems.\n\nForrest (2002) revises Lewis's analysis by first formulating a generalization of CEM, called \"Heyting mereology\", whose sole nonlogical primitive is Proper Part, assumed transitive and antireflexive. There exists a \"fictitious\" null individual that is a proper part of every individual. Two schemas assert that every lattice join exists (lattices are complete) and that meet distributes over join. On this Heyting mereology, Forrest erects a theory of pseudosets, adequate for all purposes to which sets have been put.\n\nMathematics\nHusserl never claimed that mathematics could or should be grounded in part-whole rather than set theory. Lesniewski consciously derived his mereology as an alternative to set theory as a foundation of mathematics, but did not work out the details. Goodman and Quine (1947) tried to develop the natural and real numbers using the calculus of individuals, but were mostly unsuccessful; Quine did not reprint that article in his Selected Logic Papers. In a series of chapters in the books he published in the last decade of his life, Richard Milton Martin set out to do what Goodman and Quine had abandoned 30 years prior. A recurring problem with attempts to ground mathematics in mereology is how to build up the theory of relations while abstaining from set-theoretic definitions of the ordered pair. Martin argued that Eberle's (1970) theory of relational individuals solved this problem.\n\nTopological notions of boundaries and connection can be married to mereology, resulting in mereotopology; see Casati and Varzi (1999: chpts. 4,5). Whitehead's 1929 Process and Reality contains a good deal of informal mereotopology.\n\nNatural language\nBunt (1985), a study of the semantics of natural language, shows how mereology can help understand such phenomena as the mass\u2013count distinction and verb aspect. But Nicolas (2008) argues that a different logical framework, called plural logic, should be used for that purpose.\nAlso, natural language often employs \"part of\" in ambiguous ways (Simons 1987 discusses this at length). Hence, it is unclear how, if at all, one can translate certain natural language expressions into mereological predicates. Steering clear of such difficulties may require limiting the interpretation of mereology to mathematics and natural science. Casati and Varzi (1999), for example, limit the scope of mereology to physical objects.\n\n Metaphysics \nIn metaphysics there are many troubling questions pertaining to parts and wholes. One question addresses constitution and persistence, another asks about composition.\n\n Mereological constitution \nIn metaphysics, there are several puzzles concerning cases of mereological constitution. That is, what makes up a whole. We are still concerned with parts and wholes, but instead of looking at what parts make up a whole, we are wondering what a thing is made of, such as its materials:  e.g. the bronze in a bronze statue. Below are two of the main puzzles that philosophers use to discuss constitution.\n\nShip of Theseus:  Briefly, the puzzle goes something like this. There is a ship called the Ship of Theseus. Overtime the boards start to rot so we remove the boards and place them in a pile. First question, is the ship made of the new boards the same as the ship that had all the old boards? Second, if we reconstruct a ship using all of the old planks, etc. from the Ship of Theseus, and we also have a ship that was built out of new boards (each added one-by-one over time to replace old decaying boards), which ship is the real Ship of Theseus?\n\nStatue and Lump of Clay:  Roughly, a sculptor decides to mold a statue out of a lump of clay. At time t1 the sculptor has a lump of clay. After many manipulations at time t2 there is a statue. The question asked is, is the lump of clay and the statue (numerically) identical? If so, how and why?\n\nConstitution typically has implications for views on persistence:  how does an object persist over time if any of its parts (materials) change or are removed, as is the case with humans who lose cells, change height, hair color, memories, and yet we are said to be the same person today as we were when we were first born. For example, Ted Sider is the same today as he was when he was born\u2014he just changed. But how can this be if many parts of Ted today did not exist when Ted was just born? Is it possible for things, such as organisms to persist? And if so, how? There are several views that attempt to answer this question. Some of the views are as follows (note, there are several other views):In Theodore Sider, John Hawthorne & Dean W. Zimmerman (eds.), Contemporary Debates in Metaphysics. Blackwell Pub. 241--262 (2007).\n\n(a) Constitution view. This view accepts cohabitation. That is, two objects share exactly the same matter. Here, it follows, that there are no temporal parts.\n\n(b) Mereological essentialism, which states that the only objects that exist are quantities of matter, which are things defined by their parts. The object persists if matter is removed (or the form changes); but the object ceases to exist if any matter is destroyed.\n\n(c) Dominant Sorts. This is the view that tracing is determined by which sort is dominant; they reject cohabitation. For example, lump does not equal statue because they're different \"sorts\".\n\n(d) Nihilism\u2014which makes the claim that no objects exist, except simples, so there is no persistence problem.\n\n(e) 4-dimensionalism or temporal parts (may also go by the names perdurantism or exdurantism), which roughly states that aggregates of temporal parts are intimately related. For example, two roads merging, momentarily and spatially, are still one road, because they share a part.\n\n(f) 3-dimensionalism (may also go by the name endurantism), where the object is wholly present. That is, the persisting object retains numerical identity.\n\n Mereological composition \nOne question that is addressed by philosophers is which is more fundamental: parts, wholes, or neither? Another pressing question is called the special composition question (SCQ):  For any Xs, when is it the case that there is a Y such that the Xs compose Y? This question has caused philosophers to run in three different directions:  nihilism, universal composition (UC), or a moderate view (restricted composition). The first two views are considered extreme since the first denies composition, and the second allows any and all non-spatially overlapping objects to compose another object. The moderate view encompasses several theories that try to make sense of SCQ without saying 'no' to composition or 'yes' to unrestricted composition.\n\n Fundamentality \nThere are philosophers who are concerned with the question of fundamentality. That is, which is more ontologically fundamental the parts or their wholes. There are several responses to this question, though one of the default assumptions is that the parts are more fundamental. That is, the whole is grounded in its parts. This is the mainstream view. Another view, explored by Shaffer (2010) is monism, where the parts are grounded in the whole. Shaffer does not just mean that, say, the parts that make up my body are grounded in my body. Rather, Shaffer argues that the whole cosmos is more fundamental and everything else is a part of the cosmos. Then, there is the identity theory which claims that there is no hierarchy or fundamentality to parts and wholes. Instead wholes are just (or equivalent to) their parts. There can also be a two-object view which says that the wholes are not equal to the parts\u2014they are numerically distinct from one another. Each of these theories has benefits and costs associated with them.\n\n Special composition question (SCQ) \nPhilosophers want to know when some Xs compose something Y. There are several kinds of responses:\n\nOne response to this question is called nihilism. Nihilism states that there are no mereological complex objects (read:  composite objects); there are only simples.  Nihilists do not entirely reject composition because they do think that simples compose themselves, but this is a different point. More formally Nihilists would say: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is an object composed of the Xs if and only if there is only one of the Xs. This theory, though well explored, has its own set of problems. Some of which include, but are not limited to: experiences and common sense, incompatible with atomless gunk, and it is unsupported by space-time physics.\nAnother prominent response is called universal composition (UC). UC says that so long as the Xs do not spatially overlap, the Xs can compose a complex object. Universal compositionalists are also considered those who support unrestricted composition. More formally: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is a Y such that Y is composed of the Xs. For example, someone's left thumb, the top half of another person's right shoe, and a quark in the center of their galaxy can compose a complex object according to universal composition. Likewise, this theory also has some issues, most of them dealing with our experiences that these randomly chosen parts make up a complex whole and there are far too many objects posited in our ontology.\nA third response (perhaps less explored than the previous two) includes a range of restricted composition views. Though there are several views, they all share a common idea:  that there is a restriction on what counts as a complex object: some (but not all) Xs come together to compose a complex Y. Some of these theories include:\n\n(a) Contact\u2014the Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are in contact;\n\n(b) Fastenation\u2014the Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are fastened;\n\n(c) Cohesion\u2014the Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs cohere (cannot be pulled apart or moved in relation to each other without breaking);\n\n(d) Fusion\u2014the Xs compose a complex Y if and only if the Xs are fused (fusion is when the Xs are joined together such that there is no boundary);\n\n(e) VIPA\u2014van Inwagen's Proposed Answer\u2014the Xs compose a complex Y if and only if either the activities of the Xs constitute a life or there is only one of the Xs; and\n\n(f) Brutal Composition\u2014\"It's just the way things are.\" There is no true, nontrivial, and finitely long answer.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list as many more hypotheses continue to be explored. However, a common problem with these theories is that they are vague. It remains unclear what \"fastened\" or \"life\" mean, for example. But there are many other issues within the restricted composition responses\u2014though many of them are subject to which theory is being discussed.\n\n Important surveys \nThe books by Simons (1987) and Casati and Varzi (1999) differ in their strengths:\nSimons (1987) sees mereology primarily as a way of formalizing ontology and metaphysics. His strengths include the connections between mereology and:\nThe work of Stanis\u0142aw Le\u015bniewski and his descendants\nVarious continental philosophers, especially Edmund Husserl\nContemporary English-speaking technical philosophers such as Kit Fine and Roderick Chisholm\nRecent work on formal ontology and metaphysics, including continuants, occurrents, class nouns, mass nouns, and ontological dependence and integrity\nFree logic as a background logic\nExtending mereology with tense logic and modal logic\nBoolean algebras and lattice theory.\nCasati and Varzi (1999) see mereology primarily as a way of understanding the material world and how humans interact with it. Their strengths include the connections between mereology and:\n A \"proto-geometry\" for physical objects\n Topology and mereotopology, especially boundaries, regions, and holes\n A formal theory of events\n Theoretical computer science\n The writings of Alfred North Whitehead, especially his Process and Reality and work descended therefrom.Cf.

See also the relevant entries of Michel Weber and Will Desmond, (eds.), Handbook of Whiteheadian Process Thought, Frankfurt / Lancaster, ontos verlag, Process Thought X1 & X2, 2008.\n\nSimons devotes considerable effort to elucidating historical notations. The notation of Casati and Varzi is often used. Both books include excellent bibliographies.

{"title": "Metamath", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamath", "text": "Metamath is a language for developing strictly formalized mathematical definitions and proofs accompanied by a proof checker for this language and a growing database of thousands of proved theorems covering conventional results in logic, set theory, number theory, group theory, algebra, analysis, and topology, as well as topics in Hilbert spaces and quantum logic.\n\nThe Metamath language\nWhile the large database of proved theorems follows conventional ZFC set theory, the Metamath language is a metalanguage, suitable for developing a wide variety of formal systems.\n\nThe set of symbols that can be used for constructing formulas is declared using $c\nand $v statements; for example:\n\n$( Declare the constant symbols we will use $)\n    $c 0 + = -> ( ) term wff |- $.\n$( Declare the metavariables we will use $)\n    $v t r s P Q $.\n\nThe grammar for formulas is specified using a combination of $f\nand $a statements; for example:\n\n$( Specify properties of the metavariables $)\n    tt $f term t $.\n    tr $f term r $.\n    ts $f term s $.\n    wp $f wff P $.\n    wq $f wff Q $.\n$( Define \"wff\" (part 1) $)\n    weq $a wff t = r $.\n$( Define \"wff\" (part 2) $)\n    wim $a wff ( P -> Q ) $.\n\nAxioms and rules of inference are specified with $a statements\nalong with ${ and $} for block scoping; for example:\n\n$( State axiom a1 $)\n    a1 $a |- ( t = r -> ( t = s -> r = s ) ) $.\n$( State axiom a2 $)\n    a2 $a |- ( t + 0 ) = t $.\n    ${\n       min $e |- P $.\n       maj $e |- ( P -> Q ) $.\n$( Define the modus ponens inference rule $)\n       mp  $a |- Q $.\n    $}\n\nThe metamath program can convert statements to more conventional TeX notation;\nfor example, the modus ponens axiom from set.mm:\n\nUsing one construct, $a statements, to capture syntactic rules, axiom schemas, and rules of inference provides a level of flexibility similar to higher order logical frameworks without a dependency on a complex type system.\n\nTheorems (and derived rules of inference) are written with $p statements;\nfor example:\n\n$( Prove a theorem $)\n    th1 $p |- t = t $=\n  $( Here is its proof: $)\n       tt tze tpl tt weq tt tt weq tt a2 tt tze tpl\n       tt weq tt tze tpl tt weq tt tt weq wim tt a2\n       tt tze tpl tt tt a1 mp mp\n     $.\n\nNote the inclusion of the proof in the $p statement.

Simplicity is the master concept in the design of Metamath: the language of Metamath, employed to state the definitions, axioms, inference rules and theorems is only composed of a handful of keywords, and all the proofs are checked using one simple algorithm based on the substitution of variables (with optional provisos for what variables must remain distinct after a substitution is made). This \"substitution\" is just the simple replacement of a variable with an expression and not the proper substitution described in works on predicate calculus.\n\nEven if Metamath is used for mathematical proof checking, its algorithm is so general we can extend the field of its usage. In fact Metamath could be used with every sort of formal system: the checking of a computer program could be considered (even if Metamath's low level would make it difficult); it could possibly even be a syntactic checker for a natural language (same remark). Because Metamath has a very generic concept of what a proof is (namely a tree of formulas connected by inference rules) and no specific logic is embedded in the software, Metamath can be used with species of logic as different as Hilbert-style logics or sequents-based logics or even with lambda calculus. In contrast, it is largely incompatible with logical systems which use other things rather than formulas and inference rules. The original natural deduction system (due to Gerhard Gentzen), which uses an extra stack, is an example of a system that cannot be implemented with Metamath. In the case of natural deduction however it is possible to append the stack to the formulas (transforming the natural deduction formulas into a sort of sequent) so that Metamath's requirements are met.\n\nWhat makes Metamath so generic is its substitution algorithm. This algorithm makes no assumption about the used logic and only checks the substitutions of variables are correctly done. thumb|right|592px|A step-by-step proof\nSo here is a detailed example of how this algorithm works. Steps 1 and 2 of the theorem 2p2e4 in set.mm are depicted left. Let's explain how Metamath uses its substitution algorithm to check that step 2 is the logical consequence of step 1 when you use the theorem opreq2i. Step 2 states that . It is the conclusion of the theorem opreq2i. The theorem opreq2i states that if , then . This theorem would never appear under this cryptic form in a textbook but its literate formulation is banal: when two quantities are equal, one can replace one by the other in an operation. To check the proof Metamath attempts to unify  with . There is only one way to do so: unifying  with ,  with ,  with  and  with . So now Metamath uses the premise of opreq2i. This premise states that . As a consequence of its previous computation, Metamath knows that  should be substituted by  and  by . The premise  becomes  and thus step 1 is therefore generated. In its turn step 1 is unified with df-2. df-2 is the definition of the number 2 and states that 2 = ( 1 + 1 ). Here the unification is simply a matter of constants and is straightforward (no problem of variables to substitute). So the verification is finished and these two steps of the proof of 2p2e4 are correct.\n\nThere is however some complications that are not shown on the picture. When Metamath unifies  with  it has to check that the syntactical rules are respected. In fact  has the type class thus Metamath has to check that  is also typed class This is done using the same sort of unification described in the paragraph above.\n\nThe above explanation may let suppose that formulas are stored by Metamath. In fact nothing of that sort exists. Metamath only stores the conclusion and the premises of the proven theorem and the list of the names of the theorems used by the proof and nothing more. But since it is possible, with the substitution algorithm, to generate the conclusion from the premises nothing more is required.\n\n Databases \nMetamath comes along with two main databases set.mm and ql.mm. set.mm stores theorems concerning ZFC theory and ql.mm develops a set of quantum logic theorems. Three internet interfaces (the Metamath Proof Explorer, the Hilbert Space Explorer and the Quantum Logic Explorer) are provided to explore these two databases in a human friendly way.\n\nset.mm is by far the biggest database written for Metamath, but there is also a formalization (by Robert Solovay) of Peano arithmetic called peano.mm (included in metamath.zip) and a formalization of natural deduction called nat.mm. There is a database based on the formal system MIU presented in G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach. Raph Levien has also designed several databases for his Ghilbert program.\n\n Metamath Proof Explorer \n\nMetamath has been used to develop set.mm, a human-readable database containing over 30,000 () fully formal proofs of mathematical theorems built upon ZFC set theory. Those proofs may be browsed on the internet using an interface called Metamath Proof Explorer. New theorems are added to set.mm daily; a table of the most recent proofs is maintained.\n\nOne of the seminal ideas that lead Megill to design Metamath was the desire to precisely determine the correctness of some proofs (\"I enjoy abstract mathematics, but I sometimes get lost in a barrage of definitions and start to lose confidence that my proofs are correct.\" p. xi), we can also think that the spirit of the Encyclopedia animates the growing up of Metamath and its most important database (called set.mm). Reading set.mm we may have sometimes the impression that the ambition of its author is essentially to add all the mathematics one theorem after the other.\n\nset.mm has been maintained for twenty years now (the first proofs in set.mm are dated August 1993). It is mainly a work by Norman Megill but there are also proofs made by other participants. Technically speaking set.mm develops\u2014in the Hilbert style\u2014ZFC set theory with the addition of the Grothendieck-Tarski axiom (to manage categories). The underlying logic is classical propositional calculus and classical predicate calculus with equality.\n\nset.mm is a valuable tool to understand how well-known set theory concepts such as classes, power sets, union, relations, functions, equivalence classes and so on are derived from the axioms.\n\nHowever set.mm doesn't stop at these basic notions but explores more elaborated theories.\n\nCantor concepts such as ordinal and cardinal numbers, equinumerosity or aleph function are defined.\n\nIntegers and natural numbers are constructed along with traditional arithmetic tools such as operations, recursion or induction.\n\nThe real and complex numbers are constructed from Dedekind cuts, and the concepts of sequence, limit of a sequence, sum of a series and so on are developed for them. The concept of integral is still missing.\n\nSquare root, exponentiation, exponential and trigonometric functions are implemented.\n\nGeneral topology is currently developed: topological spaces, closed and open sets, neighborhood, limit point, continuous function, Hausdorff spaces, metric spaces, Cauchy sequences have been defined.\n\nOne can also find some theorems of algebra concerning groups, rings, vector spaces, and Hilbert spaces.\n\n Hilbert Space Explorer \nThe Hilbert Space Explorer presents more than 1,000 theorems pertaining to the Hilbert space theory. Those theorems are included in set.mm. They are not shown in the Metamath Proof Explorer because they have been developed by adding extra axioms to the standard axioms of set.mm. ZFC is weakened by this adding which explains why the resulting proofs are shown in a separate Explorer. This adding (justified by historical opportunity reasons) is theoretically useless since the concept of Hilbert space can be designed with the standard ZFC axioms.\n\n Quantum Logic Explorer \nQuantum logic theorems can be found in the database ql.mm. The Quantum Logic Explorer is an internet interface to this database.\n\nPedagogy\nThe method of proof used by Metamath is far different from what is used in a school context. In schools what is required is the literate, synthetic method of proof developed by mathematicians since Euclid's time.  In Metamath, the method of proof is the symbolic, analytical method of proof invented by Aristotle, Leibniz, Peano, and Frege. Thus, Metamath is unsuitable for school exercises. To speak simply, the proofs in Metamath are much too detailed to be used with ease in school. However, set.mm can be used in a school context as an example of a symbolic system that is big enough to be interesting. set.mm can also be useful because its detailed, symbolic, unambiguous definitions can resolve confusion with textbook definitions.  Students may also appreciate the rigor of the Metamath Proof Explorer; no steps are skipped, no assumption left unstated, and no proofs are left \"to the reader\".\n\nThe Proof Explorer references many text books that can be used in conjunction with Metamath. Thus, people interested in studying mathematics can use Metamath in connection with these books.\n\nOther works connected to Metamath\n\n Proof checkers \nUsing the design ideas implemented in Metamath, Raph Levien has implemented very small proof checker, mmverify.py, at only 500 lines of Python code.\n\nGhilbert is a similar though more elaborate language based on mmverify.py. Levien would like to implement a system where several people could collaborate and his work is emphasizing modularity and connection between small theories.\n\nUsing Levien seminal works, many other implementations of the Metamath design principles have been implemented for a broad variety of languages. Juha Arpiainen has implemented his own proof checker in Common Lisp called Bourbaki and Marnix Klooster has coded a proof checker in Haskell called Hmm.\n\nAlthough they all use the overall Metamath approach to formal system checker coding, they also implement new concepts of their own.\n\n Editors \nMel O'Cat designed a system called Mmj2, which provides a graphic user interface for proof entry. The initial aim of Mel O'Cat was to allow the user to enter the proofs by simply typing the formulas and letting Mmj2 find the appropriate inference rules to connect them. In Metamath on the contrary you may only enter the theorems names. You may not enter the formulas directly. Mmj2 has also the possibility to enter the proof forward or backward (Metamath only allows to enter proof backward). Moreover Mmj2 has a real grammar parser (unlike Metamath). This technical difference brings more comfort to the user. In particular Metamath sometimes hesitates between several formulas analyzes (most of them being meaningless) and asks the user to choose. In Mmj2 this limitation no longer exists.\n\nThere is also a project by William Hale to add a graphical user interface to Metamath called Mmide. Paul Chapman in its turn is working on a new proof browser, which has highlighting that allows you to see the referenced theorem before and after the substitution was made.\n\n See also \n Automated proof checking\n Proof assistant\n Mizar system\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Metamath: Official website.\n What do mathematicians think of Metamath: Opinions on Metamath\n\nCategory:Proof assistants\nCategory:Large-scale mathematical formalization projects\nCategory:Educational math software\nCategory:Free mathematics software"}

The 18 hectare park is located on the former Tempelhof railway yard. The park is known for its mix of wild nature, decaying railway facilities and art. \n\nHistory\nIn 1889 the Tempelhof marshalling yard was built on the site and extended several times until the 1930s. A Bahnbetriebswerk was constructed in 1931. After the closure of the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof in 1952 the western section of the marshalling yard was closed. Nature began reclaiming the disused yard and lines. However, the eastern half of the yard remained in use for limited shunting operation with the Bahnbetriebswerk continuing to be used by Deutsche Reichsbahn. During the late 1970s construction of a new freight station on the site was proposed; however these proposals met community resistance and were finally abandoned in 1989. In 1995 Deutsche Bahn donated the site to the Berlin city government as compensation for other environmental impacts caused by the company. The state-owned Gr\u00fcn Berlin was responsible for the expansion, and received financial assistance from the Allianz Umweltstiftung (Allianz Environmental Foundation).  \n\nThe park was officially opened in 1999 and was a project of the Expo 2000.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe park is known as the habitat for a large number of plant, animal and insect species, many endangered. Much of the park contains Ruderal species. The park contains 366 different species of ferns and Spermatophytes, 49 mushroom species, 49 species of birds, 14 grasshopper and cricket species, 57 spider species and 95 bee species, of which more than 60 are endangered. \n\nArt and derelict railway facilities\nthumb|Former railway line\nMuch of the former railway infrastructure remains on the site. A 1940 DRB Class 50 Steam locomotive and a turntable are reminders of the former Bahnbetriebswerk, while in the south-western area of the park remains two large flying junctions (\u00dcberwerfungsbauwerk). A 50-metre-tall water tower dating from 1927 remains, as does a large locomotive hall which is often used for events, such as theatre, dance and performance events, including those of the Berliner Festspiele.\n\nNumerous art installations and sculptures from the artist group Odious are present throughout the park. These installations were described as a \"distinctive element of the park\" in the 2014 Springer Science+Business Media book Nature Policies and Landscape Policies: Towards an Alliance.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:1999 establishments in Germany\nCategory:Linear parks\nCategory:Parks in Berlin\nCategory:Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg\nCategory:Urban public parks"}

{"title": "Non-surveyable proof", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-surveyable_proof", "text": "In the philosophy of mathematics, a non-surveyable proof is a mathematical proof that is considered infeasible for a human mathematician to verify and so of controversial validity.  The term was coined by Thomas Tymoczko in 1979  in criticism of Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken's computer-assisted proof of the Four-Color Theorem, and has since been applied to other arguments, mainly those with excessive case splitting and/or with portions dispatched by a difficult-to-verify computer program.  Surveyability remains an important consideration in computational mathematics.\n\nTymoczko's argument\n\nTymoczko argued that three criteria determine whether an argument is a mathematical proof:\n\n Convincingness, which refers to the proof's ability to persuade a rational prover of its conclusion;\n Surveyability, which refers to the proof's accessibility for verification by members of the human mathematical community; and\n Formalizability, which refers to the proof's appealing to only logical relationships between concepts to substantiate its argument.\n\nIn Tymoczko's view, the Appel\u2013Haken proof failed the surveyability criterion\nby, he argued, substituting experiment for deduction:\n\nWithout surveyability, a proof may serve its first purpose of convincing a reader of its result and yet fail at its second purpose of enlightening the reader as to why that result is true\u2014it may play the role of an observation rather than of an argument.Bonnie Gold and Roger Simons.  Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy.Giandomenico Sica.  Essays on the Foundations of Mathematics and Logic.  Volume 1.\n\nThis distinction is important because it means that non-surveyable proofs expose mathematics to a much higher potential for error.  Especially in the case where non-surveyability is due to the use of a computer program (which may have bugs), most especially when that program is not published, convincingness may suffer as a result. As Tymoczko wrote:\n\nCounterarguments to Tymoczko's claims of non-surveyability\n\nTymoczko's view is contested, however, by arguments that difficult-to-survey proofs are not necessarily as invalid as impossible-to-survey proofs.\n\nPaul Teller claimed that surveyability was a matter of degree and reader-dependent, not something a proof does or does not have.  As proofs are not rejected when students have trouble understanding them, Teller argues, neither should proofs be rejected (though they may be criticized) simply because professional mathematicians find the argument hard to follow.Paul Teller.  \"Computer Proof\".  The Journal of Philosophy.  1980. (Teller disagreed with Tymoczko's assessment that \"[The Four-Color Theorem] has not been checked by mathematicians, step by step, as all other proofs have been checked.  Indeed, it cannot be checked that way.\")\n\nAn argument along similar lines is that case splitting is an accepted proof method, and the Appel\u2013Haken proof is only an extreme example of case splitting.\n\nCountermeasures against non-surveyability\n\nOn the other hand, Tymoczko's point that proofs must be at least possible to survey and that errors in difficult-to-survey proofs are less likely to fall to scrutiny is generally not contested; instead methods have been suggested to improve surveyability, especially of computer-assisted proofs.  Among early suggestions was that of parallelization: the verification task could be split across many readers, each of which could survey a portion of the proof.Neil Tennant.  \"The Taming of the True\".  1997. But modern practice, as made famous by Flyspeck, is to render the dubious portions of a proof in a restricted formalism and then verify them with a proof checker that is available itself for survey. Indeed, the Appel\u2013Haken proof has been thus verified.Julie Rehmeyer.  \"How to (Really) Trust a Mathematical Proof\".  ScienceNews.  https://www.sciencenews.org/article/how-really-trust-mathematical-proof.

{"title": "Ordinal arithmetic", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_arithmetic", "text": "In the mathematical field of set theory, ordinal arithmetic describes the three usual operations on ordinal numbers: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. Each can be defined in essentially two different ways: either by constructing an explicit well-ordered set which represents the operation or by using transfinite recursion. Cantor normal form provides a standardized way of writing ordinals. In addition to these usual ordinal operations, there are also the \"natural\" arithmetic of ordinals and the nimber operations.\n\n Addition \n\nThe union of two disjoint well-ordered sets S and T can be well-ordered.  The order-type of that union is the ordinal which results from adding the order-types of S and T.  If two well-ordered sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by order-isomorphic disjoint sets, e.g. replace S by {0} \u00d7 S and T by {1} \u00d7 T.  This way, the well-ordered set S is written \"to the left\" of the well-ordered set T, meaning one defines an order on S  T in which every element of S is smaller than every element of T. The sets S and T themselves keep the ordering they already have. This addition of the order-types is associative and generalizes the addition of natural numbers.\n\nThe first transfinite ordinal is \u03c9, the set of all natural numbers.\nFor example, the ordinal \u03c9 + \u03c9 is obtained by two copies of the natural numbers ordered in the usual fashion and the second copy completely to the right of the first. Writing 0' < 1' < 2' < ... for the second copy, \u03c9 + \u03c9 looks like\n0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2' < ...\nThis is different from \u03c9 because in \u03c9 only 0 does not have a direct predecessor while in \u03c9 + \u03c9 the two elements 0 and 0' do not have direct predecessors.\nAs another example, here are 3 + \u03c9 and \u03c9 + 3:\n0 < 1 < 2 < 0' < 1' < 2' < ...\n0 < 1 < 2 < ... < 0' < 1' < 2'\nAfter relabeling, the former just looks like \u03c9 itself, i.e. 3 + \u03c9 = \u03c9, while the latter does not:  is not equal to \u03c9 since  has a largest element (namely, 2') and \u03c9 does not (even if \u03c9 and  are equipotent, they are not isomorphic). Hence, this addition is not commutative. In fact it is quite rare for \u03b1+\u03b2 to be equal to \u03b2+\u03b1: this happens if and only if \u03b1=\u03b3m, \u03b2=\u03b3n for some ordinal \u03b3 and natural numbers m and n. From this it follows that \"\u03b1 commutes with \u03b2\" is an equivalence relation on the set of nonzero ordinals, and all the equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\nHowever, addition is still associative; one can see for example that (\u03c9 + 4) + \u03c9 = \u03c9 + (4 + \u03c9) = \u03c9 + \u03c9.\n\nThe definition of addition can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \u03b2):\n \u03b1 + 0 = \u03b1,\n \u03b1 + (\u03b2 + 1) = (\u03b1 + \u03b2) + 1 (here, \"+ 1\" denotes the successor of an ordinal),\n and if \u03b2 is a limit ordinal then \u03b1 + \u03b2 is the limit of the \u03b1 + \u03b4 for all \u03b4 < \u03b2.\n\nUsing this definition, \u03c9 + 3 can be seen to be a successor ordinal (it is the successor of \u03c9 + 2), whereas 3 + \u03c9 is a limit ordinal, namely, the limit of 3 + 0 = 3, 3 + 1 = 4, 3 + 2 = 5, etc., which is just \u03c9.\n\nZero is an additive identity \u03b1 + 0 = 0 + \u03b1 = \u03b1.\n\nAddition is associative (\u03b1 + \u03b2) + \u03b3 = \u03b1 + (\u03b2 + \u03b3).\n\nAddition is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument:\n\nbut the analogous relation does not hold for the left argument; instead we only have:\n\nOrdinal addition is left-cancellative: if \u03b1 + \u03b2 = \u03b1 + \u03b3, then \u03b2 = \u03b3. Furthermore, one can define left subtraction for ordinals \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1: there is a unique \u03b3 such that \u03b1 = \u03b2 + \u03b3.\nOn the other hand, right cancellation does not work:\n but \nNor does right subtraction, even when \u03b2 \u2264 \u03b1: for example, there does not exist any \u03b3 such that \u03b3 + 42 = \u03c9.\n\nIf the ordinals less than \u03b1 are closed under addition and contain 0 then \u03b1 is occasionally called a \u03b3-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal). These are exactly the ordinals of the form \u03c9\u03b2.\n\n Multiplication \n\nThe Cartesian product, S\u00d7T, of two well-ordered sets S and T can be well-ordered by a variant of lexicographical order that puts the least significant position first.  Effectively, each element of T is replaced by a disjoint copy of S. The order-type of the Cartesian product is the ordinal which results from multiplying the order-types of S and T.  Again, this operation is associative and generalizes the multiplication of natural numbers.\n\nHere is \u03c9\u00b72:\n00 < 10 < 20 < 30 < ... < 01 < 11 < 21 < 31 < ...\nwhich has the same order type as \u03c9 + \u03c9. In contrast, 2\u00b7\u03c9 looks like this:\n00 < 10 < 01 < 11 < 02 < 12 < 03 < 13 < ...\nand after relabeling, this looks just like \u03c9.\nThus, \u03c9\u00b72 = \u03c9+\u03c9 \u2260 \u03c9 = 2\u00b7\u03c9, showing that multiplication of ordinals is not commutative. More generally, a natural number greater than 1 never commutes with any infinite ordinal, and two infinite ordinals \u03b1, \u03b2 commute if and only if \u03b1m = \u03b2n for some positive natural numbers m and n. The relation \"\u03b1 commutes with \u03b2\" is an equivalence relation on the ordinals greater than 1, and all equivalence classes are countably infinite.\n\nDistributivity partially holds for ordinal arithmetic: R(S+T) = RS+RT. However, the other distributive law (T+U)R = TR+UR is not generally true: (1+1)\u00b7\u03c9 = 2\u00b7\u03c9 = \u03c9 while 1\u00b7\u03c9+1\u00b7\u03c9 = \u03c9+\u03c9 which is different. Therefore, the ordinal numbers form a left near-semiring, but do not form a ring.\n\nThe definition of multiplication can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \u03b2):\n \u03b1\u00b70 = 0,\n \u03b1\u00b7(\u03b2+1) = (\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2)+\u03b1,\n and if \u03b2 is a limit ordinal then \u03b1\u00b7\u03b2 is the limit of the \u03b1\u00b7\u03b4 for \u03b4 < \u03b2.\n\nThe main properties of the product are:\n\u03b1\u00b70 = 0\u00b7\u03b1 = 0.\nOne (1) is a multiplicative identity \u03b1\u00b71 = 1\u00b7\u03b1 = \u03b1.\nMultiplication is associative (\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2)\u00b7\u03b3 = \u03b1\u00b7(\u03b2\u00b7\u03b3).\nMultiplication is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: (\u03b1 < \u03b2 and \u03b3 > 0)  \u03b3\u00b7\u03b1 < \u03b3\u00b7\u03b2\nMultiplication is not strictly increasing in the left argument, for example, 1 < 2 but 1\u00b7\u03c9 = 2\u00b7\u03c9 = \u03c9. However, it is (non-strictly) increasing, i.e. \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2  \u03b1\u00b7\u03b3 \u2264 \u03b2\u00b7\u03b3.\nThere is a left cancellation law:  If \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b1\u00b7\u03b2 = \u03b1\u00b7\u03b3, then \u03b2 = \u03b3.\nRight cancellation does not work, e.g. 1\u00b7\u03c9 = 2\u00b7\u03c9 = \u03c9, but 1 and 2 are different.\n\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2 = 0  \u03b1 = 0 or \u03b2 = 0.\nDistributive law on the left: \u03b1\u00b7(\u03b2+\u03b3) = \u03b1\u00b7\u03b2+\u03b1\u00b7\u03b3\nNo distributive law on the right: e.g. (\u03c9+1)\u00b72 = \u03c9+1+\u03c9+1 = \u03c9+\u03c9+1 = \u03c9\u00b72+1 which is not \u03c9\u00b72+2.\nLeft division with remainder: for all \u03b1 and \u03b2, if \u03b2 > 0, then there are unique \u03b3 and \u03b4 such that \u03b1 = \u03b2\u00b7\u03b3+\u03b4 and \u03b4 < \u03b2. (This does not however mean the ordinals are a Euclidean domain, since they are not even a ring, and the Euclidean \"norm\" is ordinal-valued.)\nRight division does not work: there is no \u03b1 such that \u03b1\u00b7\u03c9 \u2264 \u03c9\u03c9 \u2264 (\u03b1+1)\u00b7\u03c9.\n\nA \u03b4-number (see additively indecomposable ordinal#Multiplicatively indecomposable) is an ordinal greater than 1 such that \u03b1\u03b4=\u03b4 whenever 0<\u03b1<\u03b4. These consist of the ordinal 2 and the ordinals of the form \u03c9\u03c9\u03b2.\n\n Exponentiation \n\nThe definition of ordinal exponentiation for finite exponents is straightforward. If the exponent is a finite number, the power is the result of iterated multiplication. For instance, \u03c92 = \u03c9\u00b7\u03c9 using the operation of ordinal multiplication. Note that \u03c9\u00b7\u03c9 can be defined using the set of functions from 2 = {0,1} to \u03c9 = {0,1,2,...}, ordered lexicographically with the least significant position first:\n(0,0) < (1,0) < (2,0) < (3,0) < ... < (0,1) < (1,1) < (2,1) < (3,1) < ... < (0,2) < (1,2) < (2,2) < ...\nHere for brevity, we have replaced the function {(0,k), (1,m)} by the ordered pair (k, m).\n\nSimilarly, for any finite exponent n,  can be defined using the set of functions from n (the domain) to the natural numbers (the range). These functions can be abbreviated as n-tuples of natural numbers.\n\nBut for infinite exponents, the definition may not be obvious. A limit ordinal, such as \u03c9\u03c9, is the supremum of all smaller ordinals. It might seem natural to define \u03c9\u03c9 using the set of all infinite sequences of natural numbers. However, we find that any absolutely defined ordering on this set is not well-ordered. To deal with this issue we can use the variant lexicographical ordering again. We restrict the set to sequences which are nonzero for only a finite number of arguments. This is naturally motivated as the limit of the finite powers of the base (similar to the concept of coproduct in algebra). This can also be thought of as the infinite union .\n\nEach of those sequences corresponds to an ordinal less than  such as  and  is the supremum of all those smaller ordinals.\n\nThe lexicographical order on this set is a well ordering that resembles the ordering of natural numbers written in decimal notation, except with digit positions reversed, and with arbitrary natural numbers instead of just the digits 0\u20139:\n\n(0,0,0,...) < (1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,0,0,...) < ... <\n(0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,1,0,0,0,...) < ... <\n(0,2,0,0,0,...) < (1,2,0,0,0,...) < (2,2,0,0,0,...)\n < ... <\n(0,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (1,0,1,0,0,0,...) < (2,0,1,0,0,0,...)\n < ...\n\nIn general, any ordinal \u03b1 can be raised to the power of another ordinal \u03b2 in the same way to get \u03b1\u03b2.\n\nIt is easiest to explain this using Von Neumann's definition of an ordinal as the set of all smaller ordinals. Then, to construct a set of order type \u03b1\u03b2 consider all functions from \u03b2 to \u03b1 such that only a finite number of elements of the domain \u03b2 map to a non zero element of \u03b1 (essentially, we consider the functions with finite support).  The order is lexicographic with the least significant position first. We find\n 1\u03c9 = 1,\n 2\u03c9 = \u03c9,\n 2\u03c9+1 = \u03c9\u00b72 = \u03c9+\u03c9.\n\nThe definition of exponentiation can also be given inductively (the following induction is on \u03b2, the exponent):\n \u03b10 = 1,\n \u03b1\u03b2+1 = (\u03b1\u03b2)\u00b7\u03b1, and\n if \u03b2 is a limit ordinal, then \u03b1\u03b2 is the limit of the \u03b1\u03b4 for all \u03b4 < \u03b2.\n\nProperties of ordinal exponentiation:\n\u03b10 = 1.\nIf 0 < \u03b1, then 0\u03b1 = 0.\n1\u03b1 = 1.\n\u03b11 = \u03b1.\n\u03b1\u03b2\u00b7\u03b1\u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b2 + \u03b3.\n (\u03b1\u03b2)\u03b3 = \u03b1\u03b2\u00b7\u03b3.\nThere are \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 for which (\u03b1\u00b7\u03b2)\u03b3 \u2260 \u03b1\u03b3\u00b7\u03b2\u03b3. For instance, (\u03c9\u00b72)2 = \u03c9\u00b72\u00b7\u03c9\u00b72 = \u03c92\u00b72 \u2260 \u03c92\u00b74.\nOrdinal exponentiation is strictly increasing and continuous in the right argument: If \u03b3 > 1 and \u03b1 < \u03b2, then \u03b3\u03b1 < \u03b3\u03b2.\nIf \u03b1 < \u03b2, then \u03b1\u03b3 \u2264 \u03b2\u03b3. Note, for instance, that 2 < 3 and yet 2\u03c9 = 3\u03c9 = \u03c9.\nIf \u03b1 > 1 and \u03b1\u03b2 = \u03b1\u03b3, then \u03b2 = \u03b3. If \u03b1 =  1 or \u03b1 =  0 this is not the case.\nFor all \u03b1 and \u03b2, if \u03b2 > 1 and \u03b1 > 0 then there exist unique \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03c1 such that \u03b1 = \u03b2\u03b3\u00b7\u03b4 + \u03c1 such that 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b2 and \u03c1 < \u03b2\u03b3.\n\nWhile the same notation is used for ordinal exponentiation and cardinal exponentiation, ordinal exponentiation is quite different from cardinal exponentiation. For example, with ordinal exponentiation , but for (aleph naught, the cardinality of ), . Here,  is the cardinality of the set of all functions from the set of all natural numbers to a set with two elements. (This is the cardinality of the power set of the set of all natural numbers and is equal to , the cardinality of the continuum.) To avoid confusing ordinal exponentiation with cardinal exponentiation, one can use symbols for ordinals (e.g. \u03c9) in the former and symbols for cardinals (e.g. ) in the latter.\n\nJacobsthal showed that the only solutions of \u03b1\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2\u03b1 with \u03b1\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03b2 are given by \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b2, or \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a02 and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a04, or \u03b1 is any limit ordinal and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u03b5\u03b1 where \u03b5 is an \u03b5-number larger than \u03b1.Ernst Jacobsthal, Vertauschbarkeit transfiniter Ordnungszahlen, Mathematische Annalen, Bd 64 (1907), 475-488. Available here\n\n Cantor normal form \n\nEvery ordinal number \u03b1 can be uniquely written as , where k is a natural number,  are positive integers, and  are ordinal numbers. This decomposition of \u03b1 is called the Cantor normal form of \u03b1, and can be considered the base-\u03c9 positional numeral system.  The highest exponent  is called the degree of , and satisfies . The equality  applies if and only if . In that case Cantor normal form does not express the ordinal in terms of smaller ones; this can happen as explained below.\n\nA minor variation of Cantor normal form, which is usually slightly easier to work with, is to set all the numbers ci equal to 1 and allow the exponents to be equal. In other words, every ordinal number \u03b1 can be uniquely written as , where k is a natural number,  and  are ordinal numbers.\n\nAnother variation of the Cantor normal form is the \"base \u03b4 expansion\", where \u03c9 is replaced by any ordinal \u03b4>1, and the numbers ci are positive ordinals less than \u03b4.\n\nThe Cantor normal form allows us to uniquely express\u2014and order\u2014the ordinals \u03b1 that are built from the natural numbers by a finite number of arithmetical operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation base-: in other words, assuming  in the Cantor normal form, we can also express the exponents  in Cantor normal form, and making the same assumption for the  as for \u03b1 and so on recursively, we get a system of notation for these ordinals (for example, \n\ndenotes an ordinal).\n\nThe ordinal \u03b50 (epsilon nought) is the set of ordinal values \u03b1 of the finite-length arithmetical expressions of Cantor normal form that are hereditarily non-trivial where non-trivial means \u03b21<\u03b1 when 0<\u03b1. It is the smallest ordinal that does not have a finite arithmetical expression in terms of \u03c9, and the smallest ordinal such that , i.e. in Cantor normal form the exponent is not smaller than the ordinal itself. It is the limit of the sequence \n\nThe ordinal \u03b50 is important for various reasons in arithmetic (essentially because it measures the proof-theoretic strength of the first-order Peano arithmetic: that is, Peano's axioms can show transfinite induction up to any ordinal less than \u03b50 but not up to \u03b50 itself).\n\nThe Cantor normal form also allows us to compute sums and products of ordinals: to compute the sum, for example, one need merely know that\n\nif  (if  one can apply the distributive law on the left and rewrite this as , and if  the expression is already in Cantor normal form); and to compute products, the essential facts are that when  is in Cantor normal form and , then \n\nand\n\nif n is a non-zero natural number.\n\nTo compare two ordinals written in Cantor normal form, first compare , then , then , then , etc..  At the first difference, the ordinal that has the larger component is the larger ordinal.  If they are the same until one terminates before the other, then the one that terminates first is smaller.\n\nFactorization into primes\n\nErnst Jacobsthal showed that the ordinals satisfy a form of the unique factorization theorem: every nonzero ordinal can be written as a product of a finite number of prime ordinals. This factorization into prime ordinals is in general not unique, but there is a \"minimal\" factorization into primes that is unique up to changing the order of finite prime factors .\n\nA prime ordinal is an ordinal greater than 1 that cannot be written as a product of two smaller ordinals. Some of the first primes are 2, 3, 5, ... , \u03c9, \u03c9+1, \u03c92+1, \u03c93+1, ..., \u03c9\u03c9, \u03c9\u03c9+1, \u03c9\u03c9+1+1, ... There are three sorts of prime ordinals:\nThe finite primes 2, 3, 5, ...\nThe ordinals of the form \u03c9\u03c9\u03b1 for any ordinal \u03b1. These are the prime ordinals that are limits, and are the delta numbers.\nThe ordinals of the form \u03c9\u03b1+1 for any ordinal \u03b1>0. These are the infinite successor primes, and are the successors of gamma numbers, the additively indecomposable ordinals.\n\nFactorization into primes is not unique: for example, 2\u00d73=3\u00d72, 2\u00d7\u03c9=\u03c9, (\u03c9+1)\u00d7\u03c9=\u03c9\u00d7\u03c9 and \u03c9\u00d7\u03c9\u03c9 = \u03c9\u03c9. However, there is a unique factorization into primes satisfying the following additional conditions:\nEvery limit prime occurs before every successor prime\nIf two consecutive primes of the prime factorization are both limits or both finite, then the second one is at most the first one.\n\nThis prime factorization can easily be read off using the Cantor normal form as follows:\nFirst write the ordinal as a product \u03b1\u03b2 where \u03b1 is the smallest power of \u03c9 in the Cantor normal form and \u03b2 is a successor.\nIf \u03b1=\u03c9\u03b3 then writing \u03b3 in Cantor normal form gives an expansion of \u03b1 as a product of limit primes.\nNow look at the Cantor normal form of \u03b2. If \u03b2 = \u03c9\u03bbm + \u03c9\u03bcn+ smaller terms then \u03b2 = (\u03c9\u03bcn+ smaller terms)(\u03c9\u03bb\u2212\u03bc + 1)m is a product of a smaller ordinal and a prime and an integer m. Repeating this and factorizing the integers into primes gives the prime factorization of \u03b2.\n\nSo the factorization of the Cantor normal form ordinal\n (with ) \ninto a minimal product of infinite primes and integers is\n\nwhere each ni should be replaced by its factorization into a non-increasing sequence of finite primes and\n with .\n\nLarge countable ordinals\n\nAs discussed above, the Cantor Normal Form of ordinals below  can be expressed in an alphabet containing only the function symbols for addition, multiplication and exponentiation, as well as constant symbols for each natural number and for . We can do away with the infinitely many numerals by using just the constant symbol 0 and the operation of successor,  (for example, the integer 4 may be expressed as ). This describes an ordinal notation: a system for naming ordinals over a finite alphabet. This particular system of ordinal notation is called the collection of arithmetical ordinal expressions, and can express all ordinals below , but cannot express . There are other ordinal notations capable of capturing ordinals well past , but because there are only countably many strings over any finite alphabet, for any given ordinal notation there will be ordinals below  (the first uncountable ordinal) that are not expressible. Such ordinals are known as large countable ordinals.\n\nThe operations of addition, multiplication and exponentiation are all examples of primitive recursive ordinal functions, and more general primitive recursive ordinal functions can be used to describe larger ordinals.\n\n Natural operations \n\nThe natural sum  and natural product operations on ordinals  were defined in 1906 by Gerhard Hessenberg, and are sometimes called the  Hessenberg sum (or product) .  These are the same as the addition and multiplication (restricted to ordinals) of John Conway's field of surreal numbers. They have the advantage that they are associative and commutative, and natural product distributes over natural sum.  The cost of making these operations commutative is that they lose the continuity in the right argument which is a property of the ordinary sum and product.  The natural sum of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is often denoted by  \u03b1\u2295\u03b2 or \u03b1#\u03b2, and the natural product by \u03b1\u2297\u03b2 or \u03b1\u2a33\u03b2.\n\nThe natural operations come up in the theory of well partial orders; given two well partial orders S and T, of types (maximum linearizations) o(S) and o(T), the type of the disjoint union is o(S)\u2295o(T), while the type of the direct product is o(S)\u2297o(T).D. H. J. De Jongh and R. Parikh, Well-partial orderings and hierarchies, Indag. Math. 39 (1977), 195\u2013206. Available here  One may take this relation as a definition of the natural operations by choosing S and T to be ordinals \u03b1 and \u03b2; so \u03b1\u2295\u03b2 is the maximum order type of a total order extending the disjoint union (as a partial order) of \u03b1 and \u03b2; while \u03b1\u2297\u03b2 is the maximum order type of a total order extending the direct product (as a partial order) of \u03b1 and \u03b2.Philip W. Carruth, Arithmetic of ordinals with applications to the theory of ordered Abelian groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 48 (1942), 262\u2013271. See Theorem 1. Available here  A useful application of this is when \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both subsets of some larger total order; then their union has order type at most \u03b1\u2295\u03b2.  If they are both subsets of some ordered abelian group, then their sum has order type at most \u03b1\u2297\u03b2.\n\nWe can also define the natural sum of \u03b1 and \u03b2 inductively (by simultaneous induction on \u03b1 and \u03b2) as the smallest ordinal greater than the natural sum of \u03b1 and \u03b3 for all \u03b3 < \u03b2 and of \u03b3 and \u03b2 for all \u03b3 < \u03b1.  There is also an inductive definition of the natural product (by mutual induction), but it is somewhat tedious to write down and we shall not do so (see the article on surreal numbers for the definition in that context, which, however, uses surreal subtraction, something which obviously cannot be defined on ordinals).\n\nThe natural sum is associative and commutative.  It is always greater or equal to the usual sum, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural sum of \u03c9 and 1 is \u03c9+1 (the usual sum), but this is also the natural sum of 1 and \u03c9.  The natural product is associative and commutative and distributes over the natural sum.  It is always greater or equal to the usual product, but it may be greater.  For example, the natural product of \u03c9 and 2 is \u03c9\u00b72 (the usual product), but this is also the natural product of 2 and \u03c9.\n\nYet another way to define the natural sum and product of two ordinals \u03b1 and \u03b2 is to use the Cantor normal form: one can find a sequence of ordinals \n\u03b31 > \u2026 > \u03b3n \nand two sequences (k1, \u2026, kn) and \n(j1, \u2026, jn) of natural numbers (including zero, but satisfying \nki + ji > 0 for all i) such that \n\nand defines \n\nUnder natural addition, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the free abelian group with basis the gamma numbers \u03c9\u03b1 that have non-negative integer coefficients.  Under natural addition and multiplication, the ordinals can be identified with the elements of the (commutative) polynomial ring generated by the delta numbers \u03c9\u03c9\u03b1 that have non-negative integer coefficients.\nThe ordinals do not have unique factorization into primes under the natural product. While the full polynomial ring does have unique factorization, the subset of polynomials with non-negative coefficients does not: for example, if x is any delta number, then\n\nhas two incompatible expressions as a natural product of polynomials with non-negative coefficients that cannot be decomposed further.\n\nNimber arithmetic\n\nThere are arithmetic operations on ordinals by virtue of the one-to-one correspondence between ordinals and nimbers.  Three common operations on nimbers are nimber addition, nimber multiplication, and minimum excludance (mex).  Nimber addition is a generalization of the bitwise exclusive or operation on natural numbers.  The  of a set of ordinals is the smallest ordinal not present in the set.\n\nNotes\n\n References \nJech, Thomas, 2003. Set Theory: The Third Millennium Edition, Revised and Expanded.

{"title": "Pasteur de Sarrats", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteur_de_Sarrats", "text": "Pasteur de Sarrats (or Sarrats d'Aubenas; Lat. Pastor de Serraescuderio, and Pastor de Vivariis) was a French Franciscan friar, bishop and Cardinal.  He was born in the village of Aubenas in the Vivarais,Du Chesne, Histoire, p. 523.  or he took his monastic vows in the monastery of Aubenas. Courtenay, p. 330.  Pasteur may have had a brother.  A bull of Benedict XII, dated 13 April 1337, grants the parish church of S. Martin de Valle Gorgia in the diocese of Viviers to Pierre de Serraescuderio, Canon of Viviers since 1333, who held a parish of S. Pierre de Melon in the diocese of Uz\u00e8s.Baluze (1693), I, p. 892.  J. M. Vidal, Beno\u00eet XII. Lettres communes  Vol. I (Paris 1903), p. 391, no. 4182.  Pasteur died in Avignon in 1356.\n\nStudent\nHe could have begun his studies at a Franciscan house in one of the University towns of the province, Avignon, Montpellier or Narbonne.Courtenay, p. 331 and n. 1. Courtenay speculates a good deal on whom Pasteur must have known, at Avignon (which, he decides, was the place) and at Paris, but he can cite no evidence at all. With the permission of his Minister Provincial and the Provincial Chapter, he was one of those young scholars permitted to finish his study at the Franciscan convent in Paris, and to attend the University.  He was already Minister Provincial of Provence (1329-1331) when the General Chapter of the Order of Friars Minor met in Paris in May and June 1329.  William Courtenay speculates that, in the schism that developed in the Franciscan Order in 1329, under the leadership of Michael of Cesena and William of Ockham, Pasteur de Sarrats supported Pope John XXII.Courtenay, p. 331.  He cites no evidence, though it is an easy deduction. On 15 May 1329, Pope John XXII issued a decree replacing twenty of the schismatic Franciscan leaders with reliable persons recommended to him by Cardinal Bertrand de la Tour.  One of these was Pasteur de Sarrats, who was appointed Minister Provincial of the Franciscan province of Provence.Baluze, p. 892, points out, on the authority of Nicholas the Minorite, that the appointment came from Cardinal Bertrand de la Tour, who was acting as Vicar General of the entire Ordo Minorum.\n\nTheologian and teacher\n\nHe was granted permission  in 1333, while still a Bachelor of Theology, to begin teaching the Sentences as soon as he completed his courses. Pasteur de Sarrats obtained the degree of Doctor of Theology from the University of Paris in the Spring of 1333.Denifle, p. 407. On 19 June 1333 he is referred to as Magister Pastor, Doctor in theologia.Denifle, p. 407.  He enjoyed the title of professor in the convents of his Order where he taught theology.\n\nOn 1 August 1334 he was released from his vow of obedience to the Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor, Guiral Ot (Gerald Odonis).Chronica XXIV Generalium Ordinis Minorum (Quaracchi, near Florence: Typographia Collegii S. Bonaventurae 1897) [Analecta Franciscana, Tomus III],  p. 546 n., quoting from the registers of John XXII.  Gerardus Odonis was promoted titular Patriarch of Antioch in 1342 and Bishop of Catania (27 November 1342): Duba and Schabel, p. 4 [151].  Gerardus died of the plague in Catania in 1348.  William Courtenay conjectures that this was because of a case that was assigned to Fr. Pasteur by the Pope in April 1334,C. Eubel (ed.), Bullarium Franciscanum  Vol. V, no. 1060, pp. 568-569. to resolve a dispute between the Minister General, Guiral Ot, and the Minister Provincial of Austria and his Provincial Chapter. Fr. Pasteur found for the Austrians, and Courtenay  writes that, perhaps because the decision offended Ot, or perhaps because of some other disagreement between them, Fr. Pasteur sought emancipation from Ot's control.Courtenay, p. 339.  Courtenay cites no evidence either for Ot's attitude or for Pastor's motives.\n\nHe was one of the theological experts with whom Pope Benedict XII consulted on the subject of the Beatific Vision, as taught and recanted by Pope John XXII.Denifle, p. 453 (4 October 1335).  In 1334 he was elected Minister Provincial of the Franciscan province of Provence (1334-1337),Courtenay, p. 335. with the approval of Pope Benedict.Denifle, p. 471, n.  Baluze notes (p. 892) that the Franciscan Luke Wadding reported that Pasteur had tried to refuse the office, and that subsequent writers had followed Wadding.  The story partakes of the 'Great Refusal' topos, however, in which a member of the regular clergy is elected to some high office, but refuses out of monkish modesty; this person then goes on to be pope, or cardinal, or some other high official.  That was the case with Pasteur, who is immediately found in office.\n\nOn 22 July 1336, Fr. Pasteur was paid a fee for examining the scripta dominii nostri pape ('writings of our Lord Pope') during the period June 23 to July 23.  Another payment was made on 25 April 1337, for work done from December through April.Ehrle, p. 155, no. 22 and 23. Courtenay, p. 340, n. 63.  On 17 August 1338, as Bishop of Assisi, he was part of a three-man committee that sat from 10 December 1337 to 11 March 1338 correcting the Pope's writings on Matthew.Ehrle, p. 583, n. 40.\n\nBishop\n\nOn 1 October 1337 Pasteur de Sarrats was appointed Bishop of Assisi by Pope Benedict XII, a post he held for less than sixteen months.Eubel, p. 113.  As the new Bishop of Assisi, he was instructed by  Pope Benedict to issue a mandate for about twenty Clarisses to be transferred to Naples, at the request of Queen Sancha, whose brother was a Franciscan, to act as examples for the younger nuns in the discipline of the Rule.  The nuns belonged to the community of Corpus Christi in Naples.Baluze (1693), I, p. 891 and p.  892.  During this episcopacy, Bishop Pasteur's duties in Assisi were performed by a Vicar, Fr. Alexander, O.Min., Bishop of Nocera.Courtenay, p. 340, n. 62.  The evidence indicates that Bishop Pasteur stayed in Avignon and never went to Assisi.\n\nOn 13 February 1347, King Philip IV of France issued an edict, seizing the property in France of all clerics who lived outside of France, as well as the property of the Knights Hospitallers and members of the Papal Court.Baronio (ed. A. Theiner),  Vol. 25, pp. 99-100, under the year 1337, nos. 17-18.  On March 29, Archbishop Pasteur de Sarrats was sent on a diplomatic mission, along with Bishop Guillaume Amici of Chartres, to the Philip VI of France, to get him to release  Cardinal Petrus Bertrandi and others, who had been detained in a quarrel over money.Baluze (1693), I, pp. 785 and  893, rejects the story, which rests on the authority of the Franciscan Wadding. On 10 July, the Pope ordered the two bishops to remain in Paris and work with the two cardinals resident there until the matter was sorted out. The envoys, with the assistance of the Queen, were eventually successful, at least as far as cardinals were concerned.Baluze (1693), I,  p. 893. Courtenay, p. 341.  The struggle over the immunity of the Church from taxation by the State, however, was far from over.  The same issues which had stirred Philip the Fair and Boniface VIII were still active.\n\nPasteur de Sarrats was appointed Archbishop of Embrun on 27 January 1339, in succession to Bertrand de D\u00e9aulx, who was made a cardinal on the same day. He retained the office until he himself was promoted Cardinal in 1350.Eubel, p. 234.  As Archbishop of Embrun, he was the recipient of a treatise written by John of Mirecourt, an Apology, in which he defended himself against questions concerning sixty-three statements made by him in his commentary on the Sentences.Courtenay, p. 343, with n. 79.  Courtenay dates the treatise in the spring or summer of 1347, but never explains the address to the Archbishop of Embrun, which could not have been until 1379.  Courtenay believes that John wrote to Pasteur when he was Nuncio in Paris in 1347.  Pasteur de Sarrats was not appointed Bishop of Assisi until October 1, 1337.\n\nCardinal\n\nIn his fourth Consistory for the creation of cardinals, held in Avignon on 17 December 1350, Pope Innocent VI named twelve new cardinals.  Among them was Pastor de Serraescuderio, who was assigned the titulus of  Saints Marcellinus and Peter in Rome.Eubel, p. 19 and p. 44.\n\nHe took part in the Conclave of 1352, which followed the death of Pope Clement VI on 6 December 1352.  The Conclave's opening ceremonies took place on Sunday 16 December, after the official nine-day mourning period (Novendiales).  There were extensive Electoral Capitulations, which were annulled by the new pope, Innocent VI on 6 July 1353 in the Bull Solicitudo pastoris.  The Conclave lasted only two days, achieving a successful result on Tuesday 8 December, with the election of Cardinal \u00c9tienne Aubert of Limoges, the Bishop of Ostia.  He was crowned with the throne name Innocent VI on 30 December 1352.J. P. Adams,  Sede Vacante 1352. Retrieved: 2016-06-30.  There is a myth that another person was first considered for the position, Dom Jean Birel, the twenty-second Superior General of the Carthusians, but this unlikely story has been successfully refuted.Norman P.

{"title": "Philosophy of mathematics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mathematics", "text": "The philosophy of mathematics is the branch of philosophy that studies the assumptions, foundations, and implications of mathematics, and purports to provide a viewpoint of the nature and methodology of mathematics, and to understand the place of mathematics in people's lives. The logical and structural nature of mathematics itself makes this study both broad and unique among its philosophical counterparts.\n\nRecurrent themes\n\nRecurrent themes include:\nWhat is the role of humankind in developing mathematics?\nWhat are the sources of mathematical subject matter?\nWhat is the ontological status of mathematical entities?\nWhat does it mean to refer to a mathematical object?\nWhat is the character of a mathematical proposition?\nWhat is the relation between logic and mathematics?\nWhat is the role of hermeneutics in mathematics?\nWhat kinds of inquiry play a role in mathematics?\nWhat are the objectives of mathematical inquiry?\nWhat gives mathematics its hold on experience?\nWhat are the human traits behind mathematics?\nWhat is mathematical beauty?\nWhat is the source and nature of mathematical truth?\nWhat is the relationship between the abstract world of mathematics and the material universe?\n\nHistory\nThe origin of mathematics is subject to argument. Whether the birth of mathematics was a random happening or induced by necessity duly contingent upon other subjects, say for example physics, is still a matter of prolific debates.\n\nMany thinkers have contributed their ideas concerning the nature of mathematics. Today, some philosophers of mathematics aim to give accounts of this form of inquiry and its products as they stand, while others emphasize a role for themselves that goes beyond simple interpretation to critical analysis. There are traditions of mathematical philosophy in both Western philosophy and Eastern philosophy. Western philosophies of mathematics go as far back as Pythagoras, who described the theory \"everything is mathematics\" (mathematicism), Plato, who paraphrased Pythagoras, and studied the ontological status of mathematical objects, and Aristotle, who studied logic and issues related to infinity (actual versus potential).\n\nGreek philosophy on mathematics was strongly influenced by their study of geometry. For example, at one time, the Greeks held the opinion that 1 (one) was not a number, but rather a unit of arbitrary length. A number was defined as a multitude. Therefore, 3, for example, represented a certain multitude of units, and was thus not \"truly\" a number. At another point, a similar argument was made that 2 was not a number but a fundamental notion of a pair. These views come from the heavily geometric straight-edge-and-compass viewpoint of the Greeks: just as lines drawn in a geometric problem are measured in proportion to the first arbitrarily drawn line, so too are the numbers on a number line measured in proportion to the arbitrary first \"number\" or \"one\".\n\nThese earlier Greek ideas of numbers were later upended by the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two. Hippasus, a disciple of Pythagoras, showed that the diagonal of a unit square was incommensurable with its (unit-length) edge: in other words he proved there was no existing (rational) number that accurately depicts the proportion of the diagonal of the unit square to its edge. This caused a significant re-evaluation of Greek philosophy of mathematics. According to legend, fellow Pythagoreans were so traumatized by this discovery that they murdered Hippasus to stop him from spreading his heretical idea. Simon Stevin was one of the first in Europe to challenge Greek ideas in the 16th\u00a0century. Beginning with Leibniz, the focus shifted strongly to the relationship between mathematics and logic. This perspective dominated the philosophy of mathematics through the time of Frege and of Russell, but was brought into question by developments in the late 19th and early 20th\u00a0centuries.\n\nContemporary philosophy\nA perennial issue in the philosophy of mathematics concerns the relationship between logic and mathematics at their joint foundations. While 20th-century philosophers continued to ask the questions mentioned at  the outset of this article, the philosophy of mathematics in the 20th century was characterized by a predominant interest in formal logic, set theory, and foundational issues.\n\nIt is a profound puzzle that on the one hand mathematical truths seem to have a compelling inevitability, but on the other hand the source of their \"truthfulness\" remains elusive. Investigations into this issue are known as the foundations of mathematics program.\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, philosophers of mathematics were already beginning to divide into various schools of thought about all these questions, broadly distinguished by their pictures of mathematical epistemology and ontology. Three schools, formalism, intuitionism, and logicism, emerged at this time, partly in response to the increasingly widespread worry that mathematics as it stood, and analysis in particular, did not live up to the standards of certainty and rigor that had been taken for granted. Each school addressed the issues that came to the fore at that time, either attempting to resolve them or claiming that mathematics is not entitled to its status as our most trusted knowledge.\n\nSurprising and counter-intuitive developments in formal logic and set theory early in the 20th\u00a0century led to new questions concerning what was traditionally called the foundations of mathematics. As the century unfolded, the initial focus of concern expanded to an open exploration of the fundamental axioms of mathematics, the axiomatic approach having been taken for granted since the time of Euclid around 300\u00a0BCE as the natural basis for mathematics. Notions of axiom, proposition and proof, as well as the notion of a proposition being true of a mathematical object (see Assignment (mathematical logic)), were formalized, allowing them to be treated mathematically. The Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms for set theory were formulated which provided a conceptual framework in which much mathematical discourse would be interpreted. In mathematics, as in physics, new and unexpected ideas had arisen and significant changes were coming. With G\u00f6del numbering, propositions could be interpreted as referring to themselves or other propositions, enabling inquiry into the consistency of mathematical theories. This reflective critique in which the theory under review \"becomes itself the object of a mathematical study\" led Hilbert to call such study metamathematics or proof theory.\n\nAt the middle of the century, a new mathematical theory was created by Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane, known as category theory, and it became a new contender for the natural language of mathematical thinking.Mac Lane, Saunders (1998), Categories for the Working Mathematician, 2nd edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, NY. As the 20th\u00a0century progressed, however, philosophical opinions diverged as to just how well-founded were the questions about foundations that were raised at the century's beginning. Hilary Putnam summed up one common view of the situation in the last third of the century by saying:\nWhen philosophy discovers something wrong with science, sometimes science has to be changed\u2014Russell's paradox comes to mind, as does Berkeley's attack on the actual infinitesimal\u2014but more often it is philosophy that has to be changed. I do not think that the difficulties that philosophy finds with classical mathematics today are genuine difficulties; and I think that the philosophical interpretations of mathematics that we are being offered on every hand are wrong, and that \"philosophical interpretation\" is just what mathematics doesn't need.*Putnam, Hilary (1967), \"Mathematics Without Foundations\", Journal of Philosophy 64/1, 5-22. Reprinted, pp.\u00a0168\u2013184 in W.D. Hart (ed., 1996).\n\nPhilosophy of mathematics today proceeds along several different lines of inquiry, by philosophers of mathematics, logicians, and mathematicians, and there are many schools of thought on the subject. The schools are addressed separately in the next section, and their assumptions explained.\n\nMajor themes\nMathematical realism\n\nMathematical realism, like realism in general, holds that mathematical entities exist independently of the human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably do the same. In this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.\n\nMany working mathematicians have been mathematical realists; they see themselves as discoverers of naturally occurring objects. Examples include Paul Erd\u0151s and Kurt G\u00f6del. G\u00f6del believed in an objective mathematical reality that could be perceived in a manner analogous to sense perception. Certain principles (e.g., for any two objects, there is a collection of objects consisting of precisely those two objects) could be directly seen to be true, but the continuum hypothesis conjecture might prove undecidable just on the basis of such principles. G\u00f6del suggested that quasi-empirical methodology could be used to provide sufficient evidence to be able to reasonably assume such a conjecture.\n\nWithin realism, there are distinctions depending on what sort of existence one takes mathematical entities to have, and how we know about them. Major forms of mathematical realism include Platonism.\n\nMathematical anti-realism\n\nMathematical anti-realism generally holds that mathematical statements have truth-values, but that they do not do so by corresponding to a special realm of immaterial or non-empirical entities. Major forms of mathematical anti-realism include formalism and fictionalism.\n\nContemporary schools of thought\nPlatonism\n\nMathematical Platonism is the form of realism that suggests that mathematical entities are abstract, have no spatiotemporal or causal properties, and are eternal and unchanging. This is often claimed to be the view most people have of numbers. The term Platonism is used because such a view is seen to parallel Plato's Theory of Forms and a \"World of Ideas\" (Greek: eidos (\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2)) described in Plato's allegory of the cave: the everyday world can only imperfectly approximate an unchanging, ultimate reality. Both Plato's cave and Platonism have meaningful, not just superficial connections, because Plato's ideas were preceded and probably influenced by the hugely popular Pythagoreans of ancient Greece, who believed that the world was, quite literally, generated by numbers.\n\nA major question considered in mathematical Platonism is: Precisely where and how do the mathematical entities exist, and how do we know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover truths about the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.\n\nthumb|Kurt G\u00f6del\nKurt G\u00f6del's PlatonismPlatonism in Metaphysics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) postulates a special kind of mathematical intuition that lets us perceive mathematical objects directly. (This view bears resemblances to many things Husserl said about mathematics, and supports Kant's idea that mathematics is synthetic a priori.) Davis and Hersh have suggested in their 1999 book The Mathematical Experience that most mathematicians act as though they are Platonists, even though, if pressed to defend the position carefully, they may retreat to formalism.\n\nFull-blooded Platonism is a modern variation of Platonism, which is in reaction to the fact that different sets of mathematical entities can be proven to exist depending on the axioms and inference rules employed (for instance, the law of the excluded middle, and the axiom of choice). It holds that all mathematical entities exist, however they may be provable, even if they cannot all be derived from a single consistent set of axioms.\"Platonism in the Philosophy of Mathematics\", (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n\nSet-theoretic realism (also set-theoretic Platonism)Ivor Grattan-Guinness (ed.), Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences, Routledge, 2002, p. 681. a position defended by Penelope Maddy, is the view that set theory is about a single universe of sets.Naturalism in the Philosophy of Mathematics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) This position (which is also known as naturalized Platonism because it is a naturalized version of mathematical Platonism) has been criticized by Mark Balaguer on the basis of Paul Benacerraf's epistemological problem.Mark Balaguer, \"Against (Maddian) naturalized Platonism\", Philosophia Mathematica 2 (1994), 97\u2013108.  A similar view, termed Platonized naturalism, was later defended by the Stanford\u2013Edmonton School: according to this view, a more traditional kind of Platonism is consistent with naturalism; the more traditional kind of Platonism they defend is distinguished by general principles that assert the existence of abstract objects.Linsky, B., and Zalta, E., 1995, \"Naturalized Platonism vs. Platonized Naturalism\", The Journal of Philosophy, 92(10): 525\u2013555.\n\nMathematicism\n\nMax Tegmark's mathematical universe hypothesis (or mathematicism) goes further than Platonism in asserting that not only do all mathematical objects exist, but nothing else does. Tegmark's sole postulate is: All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically. That is, in the sense that \"in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world\".Tegmark (1998), p. 1.\n\nLogicism\n\nLogicism is the thesis that mathematics is reducible to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic.Carnap, Rudolf (1931), \"Die logizistische Grundlegung der Mathematik\", Erkenntnis 2, 91-121. Republished, \"The Logicist Foundations of Mathematics\", E. Putnam and G.J. Massey (trans.), in Benacerraf and Putnam (1964). Reprinted, pp.\u00a041\u201352 in Benacerraf and Putnam (1983). Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics is just part of our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.\n\nRudolf Carnap (1931) presents the logicist thesis in two parts:\nThe concepts of mathematics can be derived from logical concepts through explicit definitions.\nThe theorems of mathematics can be derived from logical axioms through purely logical deduction.\n\nGottlob Frege was the founder of logicism. In his seminal Die Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (Basic Laws of Arithmetic) he built up arithmetic from a system of logic with a general principle of comprehension, which he called \"Basic Law V\" (for concepts F and G, the extension of F equals the extension of G if and only if for all objects a, Fa equals Ga), a principle that he took to be acceptable as part of logic.\n\nthumb|Bertrand Russell\nFrege's construction was flawed. Russell discovered that Basic Law V is inconsistent (this is Russell's paradox). Frege abandoned his logicist program soon after this, but it was continued by Russell and Whitehead. They attributed the paradox to \"vicious circularity\" and built up what they called ramified type theory to deal with it. In this system, they were eventually able to build up much of modern mathematics but in an altered, and excessively complex form (for example, there were different natural numbers in each type, and there were infinitely many types). They also had to make several compromises in order to develop so much of mathematics, such as an \"axiom of reducibility\". Even Russell said that this axiom did not really belong to logic.\n\nModern logicists (like Bob Hale, Crispin Wright, and perhaps others) have returned to a program closer to Frege's. They have abandoned Basic Law V in favor of abstraction principles such as Hume's principle (the number of objects falling under the concept F equals the number of objects falling under the concept G if and only if the extension of F and the extension of G can be put into one-to-one correspondence). Frege required Basic Law V to be able to give an explicit definition of the numbers, but all the properties of numbers can be derived from Hume's principle. This would not have been enough for Frege because (to paraphrase him) it does not exclude the possibility that the number 3 is in fact Julius Caesar. In addition, many of the weakened principles that they have had to adopt to replace Basic Law V no longer seem so obviously analytic, and thus purely logical.\n\nFormalism\n\nFormalism holds that mathematical statements may be thought of as statements about the consequences of certain string manipulation rules. For example, in the \"game\" of Euclidean geometry (which is seen as consisting of some strings called \"axioms\", and some \"rules of inference\" to generate new strings from given ones), one can prove that the Pythagorean theorem holds (that is, one can generate the string corresponding to the Pythagorean theorem). According to formalism, mathematical truths are not about numbers and sets and triangles and the like\u2014in fact, they are not \"about\" anything at all.\n\nAnother version of formalism is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem is not an absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings in such a way that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in his or her work and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.\n\nthumb|David Hilbert\nA major early proponent of formalism was David Hilbert, whose program was intended to be a complete and consistent axiomatization of all of mathematics. Hilbert aimed to show the consistency of mathematical systems from the assumption that the \"finitary arithmetic\" (a subsystem of the usual arithmetic of the positive integers, chosen to be philosophically uncontroversial) was consistent. Hilbert's goals of creating a system of mathematics that is both complete and consistent were seriously undermined by the second of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems, which states that sufficiently expressive consistent axiom systems can never prove their own consistency. Since any such axiom system would contain the finitary arithmetic as a subsystem, G\u00f6del's theorem implied that it would be impossible to prove the system's consistency relative to that (since it would then prove its own consistency, which G\u00f6del had shown was impossible). Thus, in order to show that any axiomatic system of mathematics is in fact consistent, one needs to first assume the consistency of a system of mathematics that is in a sense stronger than the system to be proven consistent.\n\nHilbert was initially a deductivist, but, as may be clear from above, he considered certain metamathematical methods to yield intrinsically meaningful results and was a realist with respect to the finitary arithmetic. Later, he held the opinion that there was no other meaningful mathematics whatsoever, regardless of interpretation.\n\nOther formalists, such as Rudolf Carnap, Alfred Tarski, and Haskell Curry, considered mathematics to be the investigation of formal axiom systems. Mathematical logicians study formal systems but are just as often realists as they are formalists.\n\nFormalists are relatively tolerant and inviting to new approaches to logic, non-standard number systems, new set theories etc. The more games we study, the better. However, in all three of these examples, motivation is drawn from existing mathematical or philosophical concerns. The \"games\" are usually not arbitrary.\n\nThe main critique of formalism is that the actual mathematical ideas that occupy mathematicians are far removed from the string manipulation games mentioned above. Formalism is thus silent on the question of which axiom systems ought to be studied, as none is more meaningful than another from a formalistic point of view.\n\nRecently, some formalist mathematicians have proposed that all of our formal mathematical knowledge should be systematically encoded in computer-readable formats, so as to facilitate automated proof checking of mathematical proofs and the use of interactive theorem proving in the development of mathematical theories and computer software. Because of their close connection with computer science, this idea is also advocated by mathematical intuitionists and constructivists in the \"computability\" tradition\u2014see QED project for a general overview.\n\nConventionalism\n\nThe French mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9 was among the first to articulate a conventionalist view. Poincar\u00e9's use of non-Euclidean geometries in his work on differential equations convinced him that Euclidean geometry should not be regarded as a priori truth. He held that axioms in geometry should be chosen for the results they produce, not for their apparent coherence with human intuitions about the physical world.\n\nIntuitionism\n\nIn mathematics, intuitionism is a program of methodological reform whose motto is that \"there are no non-experienced mathematical truths\" (L. E. J. Brouwer). From this springboard, intuitionists seek to reconstruct what they consider to be the corrigible portion of mathematics in accordance with Kantian concepts of being, becoming, intuition, and knowledge. Brouwer, the founder of the movement, held that mathematical objects arise from the a priori forms of the volitions that inform the perception of empirical objects.Audi, Robert (1999), The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1995. 2nd edition. Page 542.\n\nA major force behind intuitionism was L. E. J. Brouwer, who rejected the usefulness of formalized logic of any sort for mathematics. His student Arend Heyting postulated an intuitionistic logic, different from the classical Aristotelian logic; this logic does not contain the law of the excluded middle and therefore frowns upon proofs by contradiction. The axiom of choice is also rejected in most intuitionistic set theories, though in some versions it is accepted.\n\nIn intuitionism, the term \"explicit construction\" is not cleanly defined, and that has led to criticisms. Attempts have been made to use the concepts of Turing machine or computable function to fill this gap, leading to the claim that only questions regarding the behavior of finite algorithms are meaningful and should be investigated in mathematics. This has led to the study of the computable numbers, first introduced by Alan Turing. Not surprisingly, then, this approach to mathematics is sometimes associated with theoretical computer science.\n\nConstructivism\n\nLike intuitionism, constructivism involves the regulative principle that only mathematical entities which can be explicitly constructed in a certain sense should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics is an exercise of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction. Important work was done by Errett Bishop, who managed to prove versions of the most important theorems in real analysis as constructive analysis in his 1967 Foundations of Constructive Analysis. \n\nFinitism\n\nFinitism is an extreme form of constructivism, according to which a mathematical object does not exist unless it can be constructed from natural numbers in a finite number of steps. In her book Philosophy of Set Theory, Mary Tiles characterized those who allow countably infinite objects as classical finitists, and those who deny even countably infinite objects as strict finitists.\n\nthumb|Leopold Kronecker\nThe most famous proponent of finitism was Leopold Kronecker,From an 1886 lecture at the 'Berliner Naturforscher-Versammlung', according to H. M. Weber's memorial article, as quoted and translated in \nGonzalez gives as the sources for the memorial article, the following: Weber, H: \"Leopold Kronecker\", Jahresberichte der Deutschen Mathematiker Vereinigung, vol ii (1893), pp. 5-31. Cf. page 19. See also Mathematische Annalen vol. xliii (1893), pp. 1-25. who said:\n\nUltrafinitism is an even more extreme version of finitism, which rejects not only infinities but finite quantities that cannot feasibly be constructed with available resources. Another variant of finitism is Euclidean arithmetic, a system developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets. Mayberry's system is Aristotelian in general inspiration and, despite his strong rejection of any role for operationalism or feasibility in the foundations of mathematics, comes to somewhat similar conclusions, such as, for instance, that super-exponentiation is not a legitimate finitary function.\n\nStructuralism\n\nStructuralism is a position holding that mathematical theories describe structures, and that mathematical objects are exhaustively defined by their places in such structures, consequently having no intrinsic properties. For instance, it would maintain that all that needs to be known about the number 1 is that it is the first whole number after 0. Likewise all the other whole numbers are defined by their places in a structure, the number line. Other examples of mathematical objects might include lines and planes in geometry, or elements and operations in abstract algebra.\n\nStructuralism is an epistemologically realistic view in that it holds that mathematical statements have an objective truth value. However, its central claim only relates to what kind of entity a mathematical object is, not to what kind of existence mathematical objects or structures have (not, in other words, to their ontology). The kind of existence mathematical objects have would clearly be dependent on that of the structures in which they are embedded; different sub-varieties of structuralism make different ontological claims in this regard.\n\nThe ante rem structuralism (\"before the thing\") has a similar ontology to Platonism.  Structures are held to have a real but abstract and immaterial existence. As such, it faces the standard epistemological problem of explaining the interaction between such abstract structures and flesh-and-blood mathematicians (see Benacerraf's identification problem).\n\nThe in re structuralism (\"in the thing\") is the equivalent of Aristotelean realism. Structures are held to exist inasmuch as some concrete system exemplifies them. This incurs the usual issues that some perfectly legitimate structures might accidentally happen not to exist, and that a finite physical world might not be \"big\" enough to accommodate some otherwise legitimate structures.\n\nThe post rem structuralism (\"after the thing\") is anti-realist about structures in a way that parallels nominalism. Like nominalism, the post rem approach denies the existence of abstract mathematical objects with properties other than their place in a relational structure.  According to this view mathematical systems exist, and have structural features in common. If something is true of a structure, it will be true of all systems exemplifying the structure. However, it is merely instrumental to talk of structures being \"held in common\" between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.\n\nEmbodied mind theories\nEmbodied mind theories hold that mathematical thought is a natural outgrowth of the human cognitive apparatus which finds itself in our physical universe. For example, the abstract concept of number springs from the experience of counting discrete objects. It is held that mathematics is not universal and does not exist in any real sense, other than in human brains. Humans construct, but do not discover, mathematics.\n\nWith this view, the physical universe can thus be seen as the ultimate foundation of mathematics: it guided the evolution of the brain and later determined which questions this brain would find worthy of investigation. However, the human mind has no special claim on reality or approaches to it built out of math. If such constructs as Euler's identity are true then they are true as a map of the human mind and cognition.\n\nEmbodied mind theorists thus explain the effectiveness of mathematics\u2014mathematics was constructed by the brain in order to be effective in this universe.\n\nThe most accessible, famous, and infamous treatment of this perspective is Where Mathematics Comes From, by George Lakoff and Rafael E. N\u00fa\u00f1ez. In addition, mathematician Keith Devlin has investigated similar concepts with his book The Math Instinct, as has neuroscientist Stanislas Dehaene with his book The Number Sense. For more on the philosophical ideas that inspired this perspective, see cognitive science of mathematics.\n\nAristotelian realism\n\nAristotelian realism holds that mathematics studies properties such as symmetry, continuity and order that can be literally realized in the physical world (or in any other world there might be). It contrasts with Platonism in holding that the objects of mathematics, such as numbers, do not exist in an \"abstract\" world but can be physically realized. For example, the number 4 is realized in the relation between a heap of parrots and the universal \"being a parrot\" that divides the heap into so many parrots.Franklin, James (2014), \"An Aristotelian Realist Philosophy of Mathematics\", Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke; Franklin, James (2011), \"Aristotelianism in the philosophy of mathematics,\" Studia Neoaristotelica 8, 3-15. Aristotelian realism is defended by James Franklin and the Sydney School in the philosophy of mathematics and is close to the view of Penelope Maddy that when an egg carton is opened, a set of three eggs is perceived (that is, a mathematical entity realized in the physical world).Maddy, Penelope (1990), Realism in Mathematics, Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. A problem for Aristotelian realism is what account to give of higher infinities, which may not be realizable in the physical world.\n\nThe Euclidean arithmetic developed by John Penn Mayberry in his book The Foundations of Mathematics in the Theory of Sets. also falls into the Aristotelian realist tradition. Mayberry, following Euclid, considers numbers to be simply \"definite multitudes of units\" realized in nature\u2014such as \"the members of the London Symphony Orchestra\" or \"the trees in Birnam wood\". Whether or not there are definite multitudes of units for which Euclid's Common Notion 5 (the Whole is greater than the Part) fails and which would consequently be reckoned as infinite is for Mayberry essentially a question about Nature and does not entail any transcendental suppositions.\n\nPsychologism\n\nPsychologism in the philosophy of mathematics is the position that mathematical concepts and/or truths are grounded in, derived from or explained by psychological facts (or laws).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill seems to have been an advocate of a type of logical psychologism, as were many 19th-century German logicians such as Sigwart and Erdmann as well as a number of psychologists, past and present: for example, Gustave Le Bon. Psychologism was famously criticized by Frege in his The Foundations of Arithmetic, and many of his works and essays, including his review of Husserl's Philosophy of Arithmetic. Edmund Husserl, in the first volume of his Logical Investigations, called \"The Prolegomena of Pure Logic\", criticized psychologism thoroughly and sought to distance himself from it. The \"Prolegomena\" is considered a more concise, fair, and thorough refutation of psychologism than the criticisms made by Frege, and also it is considered today by many as being a memorable refutation for its decisive blow to psychologism. Psychologism was also criticized by Charles Sanders Peirce and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.\n\nEmpiricism\n\nMathematical empiricism is a form of realism that denies that mathematics can be known a priori at all. It says that we discover mathematical facts by empirical research, just like facts in any of the other sciences. It is not one of the classical three positions advocated in the early 20th\u00a0century, but primarily arose in the middle of the century. However, an important early proponent of a view like this was John Stuart Mill. Mill's view was widely criticized, because, according to critics, such as A.J. Ayer, it makes statements like  come out as uncertain, contingent truths, which we can only learn by observing instances of two pairs coming together and forming a quartet.\n\nContemporary mathematical empiricism, formulated by W. V. O. Quine and Hilary Putnam, is primarily supported by the indispensability argument: mathematics is indispensable to all empirical sciences, and if we want to believe in the reality of the phenomena described by the sciences, we ought also believe in the reality of those entities required for this description. That is, since physics needs to talk about electrons to say why light bulbs behave as they do, then electrons must exist. Since physics needs to talk about numbers in offering any of its explanations, then numbers must exist. In keeping with Quine and Putnam's overall philosophies, this is a naturalistic argument. It argues for the existence of mathematical entities as the best explanation for experience, thus stripping mathematics of being distinct from the other sciences.\n\nPutnam strongly rejected the term \"Platonist\" as implying an over-specific ontology that was not necessary to mathematical practice in any real sense. He advocated a form of \"pure realism\" that rejected mystical notions of truth and accepted much quasi-empiricism in mathematics. This grew from the increasingly popular assertion in the late 20th century that no one foundation of mathematics could be ever proven to exist. It is also sometimes called \"postmodernism in mathematics\" although that term is considered overloaded by some and insulting by others. Quasi-empiricism argues that in doing their research, mathematicians test hypotheses as well as prove theorems. A mathematical argument can transmit falsity from the conclusion to the premises just as well as it can transmit truth from the premises to the conclusion. Putnam has argued that any theory of mathematical realism would include quasi-empirical methods. He proposed that an alien species doing mathematics might well rely on quasi-empirical methods primarily, being willing often to forgo rigorous and axiomatic proofs, and still be doing mathematics\u2014at perhaps a somewhat greater risk of failure of their calculations. He gave a detailed argument for this in New Directions.Tymoczko, Thomas (1998), New Directions in the Philosophy of Mathematics. . Quasi-empiricism was also developed by Imre Lakatos.\n\nThe most important criticism of empirical views of mathematics is approximately the same as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is extraordinarily central, and that it would be extremely difficult for us to revise it, though not impossible.\n\nFor a philosophy of mathematics that attempts to overcome some of the shortcomings of Quine and G\u00f6del's approaches by taking aspects of each see Penelope Maddy's Realism in Mathematics. Another example of a realist theory is the embodied mind theory. \n\nFor experimental evidence suggesting that human infants can do elementary arithmetic, see Brian Butterworth.\n\nFictionalism\n\nMathematical fictionalism was brought to fame in 1980 when Hartry Field published Science Without Numbers, which rejected and in fact reversed Quine's indispensability argument. Where Quine suggested that mathematics was indispensable for our best scientific theories, and therefore should be accepted as a body of truths talking about independently existing entities, Field suggested that mathematics was dispensable, and therefore should be considered as a body of falsehoods not talking about anything real. He did this by giving a complete axiomatization of Newtonian mechanics with no reference to numbers or functions at all. He started with the \"betweenness\" of Hilbert's axioms to characterize space without coordinatizing it, and then added extra relations between points to do the work formerly done by vector fields. Hilbert's geometry is mathematical, because it talks about abstract points, but in Field's theory, these points are the concrete points of physical space, so no special mathematical objects at all are needed.\n\nHaving shown how to do science without using numbers, Field proceeded to rehabilitate mathematics as a kind of useful fiction. He showed that mathematical physics is a conservative extension of his non-mathematical physics (that is, every physical fact provable in mathematical physics is already provable from Field's system), so that mathematics is a reliable process whose physical applications are all true, even though its own statements are false. Thus, when doing mathematics, we can see ourselves as telling a sort of story, talking as if numbers existed. For Field, a statement like  is just as fictitious as \"Sherlock Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street\"\u2014but both are true according to the relevant fictions.\n\nBy this account, there are no metaphysical or epistemological problems special to mathematics. The only worries left are the general worries about non-mathematical physics, and about fiction in general. Field's approach has been very influential, but is widely rejected. This is in part because of the requirement of strong fragments of second-order logic to carry out his reduction, and because the statement of conservativity seems to require quantification over abstract models or deductions.\n\nSocial constructivism\n\nSocial constructivism see mathematics primarily as a social construct, as a product of culture, subject to correction and change. Like the other sciences, mathematics is viewed as an empirical endeavor whose results are constantly evaluated and may be discarded. However, while on an empiricist view the evaluation is some sort of comparison with \"reality\", social constructivists emphasize that the direction of mathematical research is dictated by the fashions of the social group performing it or by the needs of the society financing it. However, although such external forces may change the direction of some mathematical research, there are strong internal constraints\u2014the mathematical traditions, methods, problems, meanings and values into which mathematicians are enculturated\u2014that work to conserve the historically-defined discipline.\n\nThis runs counter to the traditional beliefs of working mathematicians, that mathematics is somehow pure or objective. But social constructivists argue that mathematics is in fact grounded by much uncertainty: as mathematical practice evolves, the status of previous mathematics is cast into doubt, and is corrected to the degree it is required or desired by the current mathematical community. This can be seen in the development of analysis from reexamination of the calculus of Leibniz and Newton. They argue further that finished mathematics is often accorded too much status, and folk mathematics not enough, due to an overemphasis on axiomatic proof and peer review as practices. \n\nThe social nature of mathematics is highlighted in its subcultures. Major discoveries can be made in one branch of mathematics and be relevant to another, yet the relationship goes undiscovered for lack of social contact between mathematicians. Social constructivists argue each speciality forms its own epistemic community and often has great difficulty communicating, or motivating the investigation of unifying conjectures that might relate different areas of mathematics. Social constructivists see the process of \"doing mathematics\" as actually creating the meaning, while social realists see a deficiency either of human capacity to abstractify, or of human's cognitive bias, or of mathematicians' collective intelligence as preventing the comprehension of a real universe of mathematical objects. Social constructivists sometimes reject the search for foundations of mathematics as bound to fail, as pointless or even meaningless.\n\nContributions to this school have been made by Imre Lakatos and Thomas Tymoczko, although it is not clear that either would endorse the title. More recently Paul Ernest has explicitly formulated a social constructivist philosophy of mathematics. Some consider the work of Paul Erd\u0151s as a whole to have advanced this view (although he personally rejected it) because of his uniquely broad collaborations, which prompted others to see and study \"mathematics as a social activity\", e.g., via the Erd\u0151s number. Reuben Hersh has also promoted the social view of mathematics, calling it a \"humanistic\" approach, similar to but not quite the same as that associated with Alvin White; one of Hersh's co-authors, Philip J. Davis, has expressed sympathy for the social view as well.\n\nA criticism of this approach is that it is trivial, based on the trivial observation that mathematics is a human activity. To observe that rigorous proof comes only after unrigorous conjecture, experimentation and speculation is true, but it is trivial and no-one would deny this. So it's a bit of a stretch to characterize a philosophy of mathematics in this way, on something trivially true. The calculus of Leibniz and Newton was reexamined by mathematicians such as Weierstrass in order to rigorously prove the theorems thereof. There is nothing special or interesting about this, as it fits in with the more general trend of unrigorous ideas which are later made rigorous. There needs to be a clear distinction between the objects of study of mathematics and the study of the objects of study of mathematics. The former doesn't seem to change a great deal; the latter is forever in flux. The latter is what the social theory is about, and the former is what Platonism et al. are about.\n\nHowever, this criticism is rejected by supporters of the social constructivist perspective because it misses the point that the very objects of mathematics are social constructs. These objects, it asserts, are primarily semiotic objects existing in the sphere of human culture, sustained by social practices (after Wittgenstein) that utilize physically embodied signs and give rise to intrapersonal (mental) constructs. Social constructivists view the reification of the sphere of human culture into a Platonic realm, or some other heaven-like domain of existence beyond the physical world, a long-standing category error.\n\nBeyond the traditional schools\nUnreasonable effectiveness\nRather than focus on narrow debates about the true nature of mathematical truth, or even on practices unique to mathematicians such as the proof, a growing movement from the 1960s to the 1990s began to question the idea of seeking foundations or finding any one right answer to why mathematics works. The starting point for this was Eugene Wigner's famous 1960 paper The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, in which he argued that the happy coincidence of mathematics and physics being so well matched seemed to be unreasonable and hard to explain.\n\nPopper's two senses\nRealist and constructivist theories are normally taken to be contraries. However, Karl PopperPopper, Karl Raimund (1946) Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume XX. argued that a number statement such as  can be taken in two senses. In one sense it is irrefutable and logically true. In the second sense it is factually true and falsifiable. Another way of putting this is to say that a single number statement can express two propositions: one of which can be explained on constructivist lines; the other on realist lines.Gregory, Frank Hutson (1996) \"Arithmetic and Reality: A Development of Popper's Ideas\". City University of Hong Kong. Republished in Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal No. 26 (December 2011)\n\nPhilosophy of language\n\nInnovations in the philosophy of language during the 20th century renewed interest in whether mathematics is, as is often said, the language of science. Although some mathematicians and philosophers would accept the statement \"mathematics is a language\", linguists believe that the implications of such a statement must be considered. For example, the tools of linguistics are not generally applied to the symbol systems of mathematics, that is, mathematics is studied in a markedly different way from other languages. If mathematics is a language, it is a different type of language from natural languages. Indeed, because of the need for clarity and specificity, the language of mathematics is far more constrained than natural languages studied by linguists. However, the methods developed by Frege and Tarski for the study of mathematical language have been extended greatly by Tarski's student Richard Montague and other linguists working in formal semantics to show that the distinction between mathematical language and natural language may not be as great as it seems.\n\nMohan Ganesalingam has analysed mathematical language using tools from formal linguistics. Ganesalingam notes that some features of natural language are not necessary when analysing mathematical language (such as tense), but many of the same analytical tools can be used (such as context-free grammars). One important difference is that mathematical objects have clearly defined types, which can be explicitly defined in a text: \"Effectively, we are allowed to introduce a word in one part of a sentence, and declare its part of speech in another; and this operation has no analogue in natural language.\"\n\nArguments\nIndispensability argument for realism\nThis argument, associated with Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam, is considered by Stephen Yablo to be one of the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets. The form of the argument is as follows.\nOne must have ontological commitments to all entities that are indispensable to the best scientific theories, and to those entities only (commonly referred to as \"all and only\").\nMathematical entities are indispensable to the best scientific theories. Therefore,\nOne must have ontological commitments to mathematical entities.Putnam, H. Mathematics, Matter and Method. Philosophical Papers, vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 2nd. ed., 1985.\n\nThe justification for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the \"only\" part of \"all and only\". The assertion that \"all\" entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is no justification for excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.\n\nEpistemic argument against realism\nThe anti-realist \"epistemic argument\" against Platonism has been made by Paul Benacerraf and Hartry Field. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are abstract entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact causally with concrete, physical entities (\"the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving Platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time\"Field, Hartry, 1989, Realism, Mathematics, and Modality, Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68). Whilst our knowledge of concrete, physical objects is based on our ability to perceive them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.\"Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us\" \u2014 Katz, J. Realistic Rationalism, 2000, p. 15Philosophy Now: \"Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma\" Standard Encyclopaedia of Philosophy Another way of making the point is that if the Platonic world were to disappear, it would make no difference to the ability of mathematicians to generate proofs, etc., which is already fully accountable in terms of physical processes in their brains.\n\nField developed his views into fictionalism. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of mathematical structuralism, according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.\n\nThe argument hinges on the idea that a satisfactory naturalistic account of thought processes in terms of brain processes can be given for mathematical reasoning along with everything else. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special intuition that involves contact with the Platonic realm. A modern form of this argument is given by Sir Roger Penrose.Review of The Emperor's New Mind \n\nAnother line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non-causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by Jerrold Katz in his 2000 book Realistic Rationalism.\n\nA more radical defense is denial of physical reality, i.e. the mathematical universe hypothesis. In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.\n\nAesthetics\n\nMany practicing mathematicians have been drawn to their subject because of a sense of beauty they perceive in it. One sometimes hears the sentiment that mathematicians would like to leave philosophy to the philosophers and get back to mathematics\u2014where, presumably, the beauty lies.\n\nIn his work on the divine proportion, H.E. Huntley relates the feeling of reading and understanding someone else's proof of a theorem of mathematics to that of a viewer of a masterpiece of art\u2014the reader of a proof has a similar sense of exhilaration at understanding as the original author of the proof, much as, he argues, the viewer of a masterpiece has a sense of exhilaration similar to the original painter or sculptor. Indeed, one can study mathematical and scientific writings as literature.\n\nPhilip J. Davis and Reuben Hersh have commented that the sense of mathematical beauty is universal amongst practicing mathematicians. By way of example, they provide two proofs of the irrationality of . The first is the traditional proof by contradiction, ascribed to Euclid; the second is a more direct proof involving the fundamental theorem of arithmetic that, they argue, gets to the heart of the issue. Davis and Hersh argue that mathematicians find the second proof more aesthetically appealing because it gets closer to the nature of the problem.\n\nPaul Erd\u0151s was well known for his notion of a hypothetical \"Book\" containing the most elegant or beautiful mathematical proofs. There is not universal agreement that a result has one \"most elegant\" proof; Gregory Chaitin has argued against this idea.\n\nPhilosophers have sometimes criticized mathematicians' sense of beauty or elegance as being, at best, vaguely stated. By the same token, however, philosophers of mathematics have sought to characterize what makes one proof more desirable than another when both are logically sound.\n\nAnother aspect of aesthetics concerning mathematics is mathematicians' views towards the possible uses of mathematics for purposes deemed unethical or inappropriate. The best-known exposition of this view occurs in G.H. Hardy's book A Mathematician's Apology, in which Hardy argues that pure mathematics is superior in beauty to applied mathematics precisely because it cannot be used for war and similar ends.\n\nJournals\nPhilosophia Mathematica journal\nThe Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal homepage\n\nSee also\n\nAxiomatic set theory\nAxiomatic system\nCategory theory\nDefinitions of mathematics\nFormal language\nFormal system\nFoundations of mathematics\nGolden ratio\n\nHistory of mathematics\nIntuitionistic logic\nLogic\nMathematical beauty\nMathematical constructivism\nMathematical logic\nMathematical proof\nMathematicism\n\nMetamathematics\nModel theory\nNaive set theory\nNon-standard analysis\nPhilosophy of language\nPhilosophy of science\nPhilosophy of physics\nPhilosophy of probability\nProof theory\n\nRule of inference\nScience studies\nScientific method\nSet theory\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\nTruth\n\nRelated works\n\nThe Analyst\nEuclid's Elements\nG\u00f6del's completeness theorem\nIntroduction to Mathematical Philosophy\n\nNew Foundations\nPrincipia Mathematica\nThe Simplest Mathematics\n\nHistorical topics\nHistory and philosophy of science\nHistory of mathematics\nHistory of philosophy\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\nAristotle, \"Prior Analytics\", Hugh Tredennick (trans.), pp.\u00a0181\u2013531 in Aristotle, Volume\u00a01, Loeb Classical Library, William Heinemann, London, UK, 1938.\nBenacerraf, Paul, and Putnam, Hilary (eds., 1983), Philosophy of Mathematics, Selected Readings, 1st edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1964. 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1983.\nBerkeley, George (1734), The Analyst; or, a Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician.

By integrating both sides, any function satisfying the differential equation must also satisfy the integral equation\n\nA simple proof of existence of the solution is obtained by successive approximations. In this context, the method is known as Picard iteration.\n\nSet\n\nand\n\nIt can then be shown, by using the Banach fixed point theorem, that the sequence of \"Picard iterates\"  is convergent and that the limit is a solution to the problem. An application of Gr\u00f6nwall's lemma to , where  and  are two solutions, shows that , thus proving the global uniqueness (the local uniqueness is a consequence of the uniqueness of the Banach fixed point).\n\n Example of Picard iteration \nLet , the solution to the equation  with initial condition . Starting with , we iterate  so that :\n\nand so on. Evidently, the functions are computing the Taylor series expansion of our known solution . Since  has poles at , this converges toward a local solution only for , not on all of R.\n\n Example of non-uniqueness \nTo understand uniqueness of solutions, consider the following examples. A differential equation can possess a stationary point. For example, for the equation , the stationary solution is , which is obtained for the initial condition . Beginning with another initial condition , the solution y(t) tends toward the stationary point, but reaches it only at the limit of infinite time, so the uniqueness of solutions (over all finite times) is guaranteed. \n\nHowever, for an equation in which the stationary solution is reached after a finite time, the uniqueness fails. This happens for example for the equation , which has two solutions corresponding to the initial condition : either  or \n\nso the previous state of the system is not uniquely determined by its state after t = 0. The uniqueness theorem does not apply because the function  has an infinite slope at  and therefore is not Lipschitz continuous, violating the hypothesis of the theorem.\n\nDetailed proof\nLet\n\nwhere:\n\nThis is  the compact cylinder where  is defined. Let\n\nthis is, the maximum slope of the function in modulus. Finally, let L be the Lipschitz constant of  with respect to the second variable.\n\nWe will proceed to apply Banach fixed point theorem using the metric on  induced by the uniform norm\n\nWe define an operator between two functional spaces of continuous functions, Picard's operator, as follows:\n\ndefined by:\n\nWe must show that this operator maps a complete non-empty metric space X into itself and also is a contraction mapping.\n\nWe first show that, given certain restrictions on ,  takes  into itself in the space of continuous functions with uniform norm. Here,  is a closed ball in the space of continuous (and bounded) functions \"centered\" at the constant function . Hence we need to show that \n\nimplies\n\nwhere  is some number in  where the maximum is achieved. \nThe last step is true if we impose the requirement .\n\nNow let's try to prove that this operator is a contraction.\n\nGiven two functions , in order to apply the Banach fixed point theorem we want\n\nfor some q < 1. So let t be such that\n\nthen using the definition of \u0393\n\nThis is a contraction if .\n\nWe have established that the Picard's operator is a contraction on the Banach spaces with the metric induced by the uniform norm. This allows us to apply  the Banach fixed point theorem to conclude that the operator has a unique fixed point. In particular, there is a unique function\n\nsuch that . This function is the unique solution of the initial value problem, valid on the interval Ia where a satisfies the condition \n\nOptimization of the solution's interval\nNevertheless, there is a corollary of the Banach fixed point theorem: if an operator Tn is a contraction for some n in N, then T has a unique fixed point. Before applying this theorem to the Picard operator, recall the following:\n\nLemma:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nProof. Induction on m. For the base of the induction  we have already seen this, so suppose the inequality holds for , then we have: \n\n \n\nThis inequality assures that for some large m, \n\n \n\nand hence \u0393m will be a contraction. So by the previous corollary \u0393 will have a unique fixed point. Finally, we have been able to optimize the interval of the solution by taking \n\nIn the end, this result shows the interval of definition of the solution does not depend on the Lipschitz constant of the field, but only on the interval of definition of the field and its maximum absolute value.\n\n Other existence theorems \nThe Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem shows that the solution exists and that it is unique. The Peano existence theorem shows only existence, not uniqueness, but it assumes only that  is continuous in , instead of Lipschitz continuous. For example, the right-hand side of the equation  with initial condition  is continuous but not Lipschitz continuous. Indeed, rather than being unique, this equation has three solutions:, p. 7\n\n.\n\nEven more general is Carath\u00e9odory's existence theorem, which proves existence (in a more general sense) under weaker conditions on . Although these conditions are only sufficient, there also exist necessary and sufficient conditions for the solution of an initial value problem to be unique, such as Okamura's theorem.\n\n See also \n Frobenius theorem (differential topology)\n Integrability conditions for differential systems\n\n Notes \n\n References \n .\n  (In that article Lindel\u00f6f discusses a generalization of an earlier approach by Picard.)\n \n\n External links \n Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem at Encyclopedia of Mathematics.\n Fixed Points and the Picard Algorithm, recovered from http://www.krellinst.org/UCES/archive/classes/CNA/dir2.6/uces2.6.html.\n Proof of the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem\n\nCategory:Lipschitz maps\nCategory:Ordinary differential equations\nCategory:Theorems in analysis"}

{"title": "Prime model", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_model", "text": "In mathematics, and in particular model theory, a prime model is a model which is as simple as possible.  Specifically, a model  is prime if it admits an elementary embedding into any model  to which it is elementarily equivalent (that is, into any model  satisfying the same complete theory as ).\n\n Cardinality \n\nIn contrast with the notion of saturated model, prime models are restricted to very specific cardinalities by the L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem.  If  is a first-order language with cardinality  and  a complete theory over  then this theorem guarantees a model for  of cardinality  therefore no prime model of  can have larger cardinality since at the very least it must be elementarily embedded in such a model.  This still leaves much ambiguity in the actual cardinality. In the case of countable languages, all prime models are at most countable.\n\n Relationship with saturated models \n\nThere is a duality between the definitions of prime and saturated models. Half of this duality is discussed in the article on saturated models, while the other half is as follows.  While a saturated model realizes as many types as possible, a prime model realizes as few as possible: it is an atomic model, realizing only the types which cannot be omitted and omitting the remainder.  This may be interpreted in the sense that a prime model admits \"no frills\": any characteristic of a model which is optional is ignored in it.\n\nFor example, the model  is a prime model of the theory of the natural numbers N with a successor operation S; a non-prime model might be  meaning that there is a copy of the full integers which lies disjoint from the original copy of the natural numbers within this model; in this add-on, arithmetic works as usual.  These models are elementarily equivalent;  their theory admits the following axiomatization (verbally):\n There is a unique element which is not the successor of any element;\n No two distinct elements have the same successor;\n No element satisfies Sn(x) = x with n>0.\nThese are, in fact, two of Peano's axioms, while the third follows from the first by induction (another of Peano's axioms).  Any model of this theory consists of disjoint copies of the full integers in addition to the natural numbers, since once one generates a submodel from 0 all remaining points admit both predecessors and successors indefinitely.  This is the outline of a proof that  is a prime model.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Model theory"}
{"title": "Proof of impossibility", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_impossibility", "text": "A proof of impossibility, also known as negative proof, proof of an impossibility theorem, or negative result, is a proof demonstrating that a particular problem cannot be solved, or cannot be solved in general. Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. To prove that something is impossible is usually much harder than the opposite task; it is necessary to develop a theory.Pudl\u00e1k, pp. 255\u2013256. Impossibility theorems are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see universal quantification).\n\nOne of the most famous proofs of impossibility was the 1882 proof of Ferdinand von Lindemann, showing that the ancient problem of squaring the circle cannot be solved, because the number  is transcendental (non-algebraic) and only a subset of the algebraic numbers can be constructed by compass and straightedge. Two other classical problems\u2014trisecting the general angle and doubling the cube\u2014were also proved impossible in the nineteenth century.\n\nA problem arising in the sixteenth century was that of creating a general formula using radicals expressing the solution of any polynomial equation of fixed degree k, where k \u2265 5. In the 1820s, the Abel\u2013Ruffini theorem showed this to be impossible using concepts such as solvable groups from Galois theory, a new subfield of abstract algebra.\n\nAmong the most important proofs of impossibility of the 20th century, were those related to undecidability, which showed that there are problems that cannot be solved in general by any algorithm at all. The most famous is the halting problem.\n\nIn computational complexity theory, techniques like relativization (see oracle machine) provide \"weak\" proofs of impossibility excluding certain proof techniques. Other techniques like proofs of completeness for a complexity class provide evidence for the difficulty of problems by showing them to be just as hard to solve as other known problems that have proved intractable.\n\nTypes of impossibility proof\n\nProof by contradiction\nOne widely used type of impossibility proof is proof by contradiction. In this type of proof it is shown that if something, such as a solution to a particular class of equations, were possible, then two mutually contradictory things would be true, such as a number being both even and odd. The contradiction implies that the original premise is impossible.\n\nProof by descent\n\nOne type of proof by contradiction is proof by descent. Here it is postulated that something is possible, such as a solution to a class of equations, and that therefore there must be a smallest solution; then starting from the allegedly smallest solution, it is shown that a smaller solution can be found, contradicting the premise that the former solution was the smallest one possible. Thus the premise that a solution exists must be false.\n\nThis method of proof can also be interpreted slightly differently, as the method of infinite descent. One postulates that a positive integer solution exists, whether or not it is the smallest one, and one shows that based on this solution a smaller solution must exist. But by mathematical induction it follows that a still smaller solution must exist, then a yet smaller one, and so on for an infinite number of steps. But this contradicts the fact that one cannot find smaller and smaller positive integers indefinitely; the contradiction implies that the premise that a solution exists is wrong.\n\nTypes of disproof of impossibility conjectures\nThere are two alternative methods of proving wrong a conjecture that something is impossible: by counterexample (constructive proof) and by logical contradiction (non-constructive proof).\n\nThe obvious way to disprove an impossibility conjecture by providing a single counterexample. For example, Euler proposed that at least n different nth powers were necessary to sum to yet another nth power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966 with a counterexample involving a count of only four different 5th powers summing to another fifth power:\n275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445.\nA proof by counterexample is a constructive proof.\n\nIn contrast, a non-constructive proof that something is not impossible proceeds by showing it is logically contradictory for all possible counterexamples to be invalid: At least one of the items on a list of possible counterexamples must actually be a valid counterexample to the impossibility conjecture. For example, a conjecture that it is impossible for an irrational power raised to an irrational power to be rational was disproved by showing that one of two possible counterexamples must be a valid counterexample, without showing which one it is.\n\nThe existence of irrational numbers: The Pythagoreans' proof\nThe proof by Pythagoras (or more likely one of his students) about 500\u00a0BCE has had a profound effect on mathematics. It shows that the square root of 2 cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (counting numbers). The proof bifurcated \"the numbers\" into two non-overlapping collections\u2014the rational numbers and the irrational numbers. This bifurcation was used by Cantor in his diagonal method, which in turn was used by Turing in his proof that the Entscheidungsproblem (the decision problem of Hilbert) is undecidable.\n\nProofs followed for various square roots of the primes up to 17.\nThere is a famous passage in Plato's Theaetetus in which it is stated that Teodorus (Plato's teacher) proved the irrationality of\n\ntaking all the separate cases up to the root of 17\u00a0square feet\u00a0...\u2009.Hardy and Wright, p.\u00a042\n\nA more general proof now exists that:\n\nThe mth root of an integer N is irrational, unless N is the mth power of an integer n\".Hardy and Wright, p.\u00a040\n\nThat is,  it is impossible to express the mth root of an integer N as the ratio  of two integers a and b that share no common prime factor except in cases in which b\u00a0=\u00a01.\n\nImpossible constructions sought by the ancient Greeks\nThree famous questions of Greek geometry were how:\n\n ...\u00a0with compass and straight-edge to trisect any angle,\n to construct a cube with a volume twice the volume of a given cube\n to construct a square equal in area to that of a given circle.\n\nFor more than 2,000\u00a0years unsuccessful attempts were made to solve these problems; at last, in the 19th\u00a0century it was proved that the desired constructions are logically impossible.Nagel and Newman p.\u00a08\n\nA fourth problem of the ancient Greeks was to construct an equilateral polygon with a specified number n of sides, beyond the basic cases n\u00a0=\u00a03, 4, 5 that they knew how to construct.\n\nAll of these are problems in Euclidean construction, and Euclidean constructions can be done only if they involve only Euclidean numbers (by definition of the latter) (Hardy and Wright p.\u00a0159). Irrational numbers can be Euclidean. A good example is the irrational number the square root of 2. It is simply the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs both one unit in length, and it can be constructed with straightedge and compass. But it was proved centuries after Euclid that Euclidean numbers cannot involve any operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of square roots.\n\nAngle trisection and doubling the cube\nBoth trisecting the general angle and doubling the cube require taking cube roots, which are not constructible numbers by compass and straightedge.\n\nSquaring the circle\n is not a Euclidean number ... and therefore it is impossible to construct, by Euclidean methods a length equal to the circumference of a circle of unit diameterHardy and Wright p.\u00a0176\n\nA proof exists to demonstrate that any Euclidean number is an algebraic number\u2014a number that is the solution to some polynomial equation. Therefore, because  was proved in 1882 to be a transcendental number and thus by definition not an algebraic number, it is not a Euclidean number. Hence the construction of a length  from a unit circle is impossibleHardy and Wright p.\u00a0159 referenced by E. Hecke. (1923). Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen. Leipzig: Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft, and the circle cannot be squared.\n\nConstructing an equilateral n-gon\nThe Gauss-Wantzel theorem showed in 1837 that constructing an equilateral n-gon is impossible for most values of n.\n\nEuclid's parallel axiom\n\nNagel and Newman consider the question raised by the parallel postulate to be \"...perhaps the most significant development in its long-range effects upon subsequent mathematical history\" (p.\u00a09).\n\nThe question is: can the axiom that two parallel lines \"...will not meet even 'at infinity'\" (footnote, ibid) be derived from the other axioms of Euclid's geometry? It was not until work in the nineteenth century by \"... Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann, that the impossibility of deducing the parallel axiom from the others was demonstrated. This outcome was of the greatest intellectual importance. ...a proof can be given of the impossibility of proving certain propositions [in this case, the parallel postlate] within a given system [in this case, Euclid's first four postulates]\". (p.\u00a010)\n\nFermat's Last Theorem\n\nFermat's Last Theorem was conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in the 1600s, states the impossibility of finding solutions in positive integers for the equation  with . Fermat himself gave a proof for the n\u00a0=\u00a04 case using his technique of infinite descent, and other special cases were subsequently proved, but the general case was not proved until 1994 by Andrew Wiles.\n\nRichard's paradox\n\nThis profound paradox presented by Jules Richard in 1905 informed the work of Kurt G\u00f6del (cf Nagel and Newman p.\u00a060ff) and Alan Turing. A succinct definition is found in Principia MathematicaPrincipia Mathematica, 2nd edition 1927, p.\u00a061, 64 in Principia Mathematica online, Vol.1 at University of Michigan Historical Math Collection:\n\nKurt G\u00f6del considered his proof to be \u201can analogy\u201d of Richard's paradox, which he called \u201cRichard's antinomy\u201d.G\u00f6del in Undecidable, p.\u00a09 See more below about G\u00f6del's proof.\n\nAlan Turing constructed this paradox with a machine and proved that this machine could not answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if any machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive \u2018infinite loop\u2019 (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).\n\nCan this theorem be proved from these axioms? G\u00f6del's proof\n\nTo quote Nagel and Newman (p.\u00a068), \"G\u00f6del's paper is difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary theorems, must be mastered before the main results are reached\" (p.\u00a068). In fact, Nagel and Newman required a 67-page introduction to their exposition of the proof. But if the reader feels strong enough to tackle the paper, Martin Davis observes that \"This remarkable paper is not only an intellectual landmark, but is written with a clarity and vigor that makes it a pleasure to read\" (Davis in Undecidable, p.\u00a04). It is recommended that most readers see Nagel and Newman first.\n\nSo what did G\u00f6del prove? In his own words:\n\n \"It is reasonable... to make the conjecture that ...[the] axioms [from Principia Mathematica and Peano ] are ... sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given systems. In what follows it will be shown that this is not the case, but rather that ... there exist relatively simple problems of the theory of ordinary whole numbers which cannot be decided on the basis of the axioms\" (G\u00f6del in Undecidable, p. 4).\n\nG\u00f6del compared his proof to \"Richard's antinomy\" (an \"antinomy\" is a contradiction or a paradox; for more see Richard's paradox):\n\n \"The analogy of this result with Richard's antinomy is immediately evident; there is also a close relationship [14] with the Liar Paradox (G\u00f6del's footnote 14: Every epistemological antinomy can be used for a similar proof of undecidability)... Thus we have a proposition before us which asserts its own unprovability [15]. (His footnote 15: Contrary to appearances, such a proposition is not circular, for, to begin with, it asserts the unprovability of a quite definite formula)\" (G\u00f6del in Undecidable, p.9).\n\nWill this computing machine lock in a \"circle\"? Turing's first proof\n The Entscheidungsproblem, the decision problem, was first answered by Church in April 1935 and preempted Turing by over a year, as Turing's paper was received for publication in May 1936. (Also received for publication in 1936\u2014in October, later than Turing's\u2014was a short paper by Emil Post that discussed the reduction of an algorithm to a simple machine-like \"method\" very similar to Turing's computing machine model (see Post\u2013Turing machine for details).\n Turing's proof is made difficult by number of definitions required and its subtle nature. See Turing machine and Turing's proof for details.\n Turing's first proof (of three) follows the schema of Richard's Paradox: Turing's computing machine is an algorithm represented by a string of seven letters in a \"computing machine\". Its \"computation\" is to test all computing machines (including itself) for \"circles\", and form a diagonal number from the computations of the non-circular or \"successful\" computing machines. It does this, starting in sequence from 1, by converting the numbers (base 8) into strings of seven letters to test. When it arrives at its own number, it creates its own letter-string. It decides it is the letter-string of a successful machine, but when it tries to do this machine's (its own) computation it locks in a circle and can't continue. Thus we have arrived at Richard's paradox. (If you are bewildered see Turing's proof for more).\n\nA number of similar undecidability proofs appeared soon before and after Turing's proof:\n\n April 1935: Proof of Alonzo Church (An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory). His proof was to \"...propose a definition of effective calculability ... and to show, by means of an example, that not every problem of this class is solvable\" (Undecidable p.\u00a090))\n 1946: Post correspondence problem (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p.\u00a0193ff, p.\u00a0407 for the reference)\n April 1947: Proof of Emil Post (Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue) (Undecidable p.\u00a0293). This has since become known as \"The Word problem of Thue\" or \"Thue's Word Problem\" (Axel Thue proposed this problem in a paper of 1914 (cf References to Post's paper in Undecidable, p.\u00a0303)).\n Rice's theorem: a generalized formulation of Turing's second theorem (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p.\u00a0185ff)\"...there can be no machine E which ... will determine whether M [an arbitrary machine] ever prints a given symbol (0 say)\" (Undecidable p. 134). Turing makes an odd assertion at the end of this proof that sounds remarkably like Rice's Theorem:\n\"...each of these \"general process\" problems can be expressed as a problem concerning a general process for determining whether a given integer n has a property G(n)... and this is equivalent to computing a number whose nth figure is 1 if G(n) is true and 0 if it is false\" (Undecidable p 134). Unfortunately he doesn't clarify the point further, and the reader is left confused.\n Greibach's theorem: undecidability in language theory (cf Hopcroft and Ullman p.\u00a0205ff and reference on p.\u00a0401 ibid: Greibach [1963] \"The undecidability of the ambiguity problem for minimal lineal grammars,\" Information and Control 6:2, 117\u2013125, also reference on p.\u00a0402 ibid: Greibach [1968] \"A note on undecidable properties of formal languages\", Math Systems Theory 2:1, 1\u20136.)\n Penrose tiling questions\n Question of solutions for Diophantine equations and the resultant answer in the MRDP Theorem; see entry below.\n\nCan this string be compressed? Chaitin's proof\n\nFor an exposition suitable for non-specialists see Beltrami p.\u00a0108ff. Also see Franzen Chapter 8 pp.\u00a0137\u2013148, and Davis pp.\u00a0263\u2013266. Franz\u00e9n's discussion is significantly more complicated than Beltrami's and delves into \u03a9\u2014Gregory Chaitin's so-called \"halting probability\". Davis's older treatment approaches the question from a Turing machine viewpoint. Chaitin has written a number of books about his endeavors and the subsequent philosophic and mathematical fallout from them.\n\nA string is called (algorithmically) random if it cannot be produced from any shorter computer program. While most strings are random, no particular one can be proved so, except for finitely many short ones:\n\n \"A paraphrase of Chaitin's result is that there can be no formal proof that a sufficiently long string is random...\" (Beltrami p. 109)\n\nBeltrami observes that \"Chaitin's proof is related to a paradox posed by Oxford librarian G. Berry early in the twentieth century that asks for 'the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined by an English sentence with fewer than 1000 characters.' Evidently, the shortest definition of this number must have at least 1000 characters. However, the sentence within quotation marks, which is itself a definition of the alleged number is less than 1000 characters in length!\" (Beltrami, p.\u00a0108)\n\nDoes this Diophantine equation have an integer solution? Hilbert's tenth problem\n\nThe question \"Does any arbitrary \"Diophantine equation\" have an integer solution?\" is undecidable.That is, it is impossible to answer the question for all cases.\n\nFranz\u00e9n introduces Hilbert's tenth problem and the MRDP theorem (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem) which states that \"no algorithm exists which can decide whether or not a Diophantine equation has any solution at all\".  MRDP uses the undecidability proof of Turing: \"... the set of solvable Diophantine equations is an example of a computably enumerable but not decidable set, and the set of unsolvable Diophantine equations is not computably enumerable\" (p.\u00a071).\n\nIn social science\nIn political science, Arrow's impossibility theorem states that it is impossible to devise a voting system that satisfies a set of five specific axioms. This theorem is proved by showing that four of the axioms together imply the opposite of the fifth.\n\nIn economics, Holmstr\u00f6m's theorem is an impossibility theorem proving that no incentive system for a team of agents can satisfy all of three desirable criteria.\n\nIn natural science\nIn natural science, impossibility assertions (like other assertions) come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible.\n\nTwo examples of widely accepted impossibilities in physics are perpetual motion machines, which violate the law of conservation of energy, and exceeding the speed of light, which violates the implications of special relativity. Another is the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which asserts the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of a particle. Also Bell's theorem: no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.\n\nWhile an impossibility assertion in science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.\n\nSee also\n List of unsolved problems in mathematicsSolutions of these problems are still searched for.

Recursive data structures can dynamically grow to an arbitrarily large size in response to runtime requirements; in contrast, a static array's size requirements must be set at compile time.\n\nSometimes the term \"inductive data type\" is used for algebraic data types which are not necessarily recursive.\n\nExample\n\nAn example is the list type, in Haskell:\n\ndata List a = Nil | Cons a (List a)\n\nThis indicates that a list of a's is either an empty list or a cons cell containing an 'a' (the \"head\" of the list) and another list (the \"tail\").\n\nAnother example is a similar singly linked type in Java:\n\nclass List<E> {\n    E value;\n    List<E> next;\n}\n\nThis indicates that non-empty list of type E contains a data member of type E, and a reference to another List object for the rest of the list (or a null reference to indicate that this is the end of the list).\n\nMutually recursive data types\n\nData types can also be defined by mutual recursion. The most important basic example of this is a tree, which can be defined mutually recursively in terms of a forest (a list of trees). Symbolically:\n f: [t[1], ..., t[k]]\n t: v f\nA forest f consists of a list of trees, while a tree t consists of a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as it expresses a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types.\n\nThis mutually recursive definition can be converted to a singly recursive definition by inlining the definition of a forest:\n t: v [t[1], ..., t[k]]\nA tree t consists of a pair of a value v and a list of trees (its children). This definition is more compact, but somewhat messier: a tree consists of a pair of one type and a list another, which require disentangling to prove results about.\n\nIn Standard ML, the tree and forest data types can be mutually recursively defined as follows, allowing empty trees:\ndatatype 'a tree = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a forest\nand      'a forest = Nil | Cons of 'a tree * 'a forestIn Haskell, the tree and forest data types can be defined similarly:data Tree a = Empty\n            | Node (a, Forest a)\n\ndata Forest a = Nil\n              | Cons (Tree a) (Forest a)\n\nTheory\nIn type theory, a recursive type has the general form \u03bc\u03b1.T where the type variable \u03b1 may appear in the type T and stands for the entire type itself.\n\nFor example, the natural numbers (see Peano arithmetic) may be defined by the Haskell datatype:\n\ndata Nat = Zero | Succ Nat\n\nIn type theory, we would say:  where the two arms of the sum type represent the Zero and Succ data constructors. Zero takes no arguments (thus represented by the unit type) and Succ takes another Nat (thus another element of ).\n\nThere are two forms of recursive types: the so-called isorecursive types, and equirecursive types.  The two forms differ in how terms of a recursive type are introduced and eliminated.\n\nIsorecursive types\nWith isorecursive types, the recursive type  and its expansion (or unrolling)  (Where the notation indicates that all instances of Z are replaced with Y in X) are distinct (and disjoint) types with special term constructs, usually called roll and unroll, that form an isomorphism between them.  To be precise:  and , and these two are inverse functions.\n\nEquirecursive types\nUnder equirecursive rules, a recursive type  and its unrolling  are equal -- that is, those two type expressions are understood to denote the same type.  In fact, most theories of equirecursive types go further and essentially specify that any two type expressions with the same \"infinite expansion\" are equivalent.  As a result of these rules, equirecursive types contribute significantly more complexity to a type system than isorecursive types do.  Algorithmic problems such as type checking and type inference are more difficult for equirecursive types as well.  Since direct comparison does not make sense on an equirecursive type, they can be converted into a canonical form in O(n log n) time, which can easily be compared.\n\nEquirecursive types capture the form of self-referential (or mutually referential) type definitions seen in procedural and object-oriented programming languages, and also arise in type-theoretic semantics of objects and classes.\nIn functional programming languages, isorecursive types (in the guise of datatypes) are far more common.\n\nIn type synonyms\nRecursion is not allowed in type synonyms in Miranda, OCaml (unless -rectypes flag is used or it's a record or variant), and Haskell; so for example the following Haskell types are illegal:\n\ntype Bad = (Int, Bad)\ntype Evil = Bool -> Evil\n\nInstead, you must wrap it inside an algebraic data type (even if it only has one constructor):\n\ndata Good = Pair Int Good\ndata Fine = Fun (Bool -> Fine)\n\nThis is because type synonyms, like typedefs in C, are replaced with their definition at compile time. (Type synonyms are not \"real\" types; they are just \"aliases\" for convenience of the programmer.) But if you try to do this with a recursive type, it will loop infinitely because no matter how many times you substitute it, it still refers to itself, e.g. \"Bad\" will grow indefinitely: Bad \u2192 (Int, Bad) \u2192 (Int, (Int, Bad)) \u2192 ... .\n\nAnother way to see it is that a level of indirection (the algebraic data type) is required to allow the isorecursive type system to figure out when to roll and unroll.\n\nSee also\n Recursive definition\n Algebraic data type\n Node (computer science)\n\nNotes\n\nCategory:Data types\nCategory:Type theory"}
{"title": "Relation algebra", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra", "text": "In mathematics and abstract algebra, a relation algebra is a residuated Boolean algebra expanded with an involution called converse, a unary operation. The motivating example of a relation algebra is the algebra 2X\u00b2 of all binary relations on a set X, that is, subsets of the cartesian square X2, with R\u2022S interpreted as the usual composition of binary relations R and S, and with the converse of R as the converse relation.\n\nRelation algebra emerged in the 19th-century work of Augustus De Morgan and Charles Peirce, which culminated in the algebraic logic of Ernst Schr\u00f6der. The equational form of relation algebra treated here was developed by Alfred Tarski and his students, starting in the 1940s. Tarski and Givant (1987) applied relation algebra to a variable-free treatment of axiomatic set theory, with the implication that mathematics founded on set theory could itself be conducted without variables.\n\nDefinition\nA relation algebra (L, \u2227, \u2228, \u2212, 0, 1, \u2022, I, \u02d8) is an algebraic structure equipped with the Boolean operations of conjunction x\u2227y, disjunction x\u2228y, and negation x\u2212, the Boolean constants 0 and 1, the relational operations of composition x\u2022y and converse x\u02d8, and the relational constant I, such that these operations and constants satisfy certain equations constituting an axiomatization of a calculus of relations. Roughly, a relation algebra is to a system of binary relations on a set containing the empty (0), complete (1), and identity (I) relations and closed under these five operations as a group is to a system of permutations of a set containing the identity permutation and closed under composition and inverse. However, the first order theory of relation algebras is not complete for such systems of binary relations.\n\nFollowing J\u00f3nsson and Tsinakis (1993) it is convenient to define additional operations x\u25c1y = x\u2022y\u02d8, and, dually,  x\u25b7y = x\u02d8\u2022y .  J\u00f3nsson and Tsinakis showed that I\u25c1x = x\u25b7I, and that both were equal to x\u02d8.  Hence a relation algebra can equally well be defined as an algebraic structure (L, \u2227, \u2228, \u2212, 0, 1, \u2022, I, \u25c1, \u25b7).  The advantage of this signature over the usual one is that a relation algebra can then be defined in full simply as a residuated Boolean algebra for which I\u25c1x is an involution, that is, I\u25c1(I\u25c1x) = x .  The latter condition can be thought of as the relational counterpart of the equation 1/(1/x) = x for ordinary arithmetic reciprocal, and some authors use reciprocal as a synonym for converse.\n\nSince residuated Boolean algebras are axiomatized with finitely many identities, so are relation algebras. Hence the latter form a variety, the variety RA of relation algebras.  Expanding the above definition as equations yields the following finite axiomatization.\n\nAxioms\nThe axioms B1-B10 below are adapted from Givant (2006: 283), and were first set out by Tarski in 1948.Alfred Tarski (1948) \"Abstract: Representation Problems for Relation Algebras,\" Bulletin of the AMS 54: 80.\n\nL is a Boolean algebra under binary disjunction, \u2228, and unary complementation ()\u2212:\nB1: A \u2228 B = B \u2228 A\nB2: A \u2228 (B \u2228 C) = (A \u2228 B) \u2228 C\nB3: (A\u2212 \u2228 B)\u2212 \u2228 (A\u2212 \u2228 B\u2212)\u2212 = A\nThis axiomatization of Boolean algebra is due to Huntington (1933).  Note that the meet of the implied Boolean algebra is not the \u2022 operator (even though it distributes over  like a meet does), nor is the 1 of the Boolean algebra the I constant.\n\nL is a monoid under binary composition (\u2022) and nullary identity I:\nB4: A\u2022(B\u2022C) = (A\u2022B)\u2022C\nB5: A\u2022I = A\n\nUnary converse ()\u02d8 is an involution with respect to composition:\nB6: A\u02d8\u02d8 = A \nB7: (A\u2022B)\u02d8 = B\u02d8\u2022A\u02d8\n\nAxiom B6 defines conversion as an involution, whereas B7 expresses the antidistributive property of conversion relative to composition.\n\nConverse and composition distribute over disjunction:\nB8: (A\u2228B)\u02d8 = A\u02d8\u2228B\u02d8\nB9: (A\u2228B)\u2022C = (A\u2022C)\u2228(B\u2022C)\n\nB10 is Tarski's equational form of the fact, discovered by Augustus De Morgan, that A\u2022B \u2264 C\u2212   A\u02d8\u2022C \u2264 B\u2212   C\u2022B\u02d8 \u2264 A\u2212.\nB10: (A\u02d8\u2022(A\u2022B)\u2212)\u2228B\u2212 = B\u2212\n\nThese axioms are ZFC theorems; for the purely Boolean B1-B3, this fact is trivial. After each of the following axioms is shown the number of the corresponding theorem in Chapter 3 of Suppes (1960), an exposition of ZFC: B4 27, B5 45, B6 14, B7 26, B8 16, B9 23.\n\nExpressing properties of binary relations in RA\nThe following table shows how many of the usual properties of binary relations can be expressed as succinct RA equalities or inequalities. Below, an inequality of the form A\u2264B is shorthand for the Boolean equation A\u2228B = B.\n\nThe most complete set of results of this nature is Chapter C of Carnap (1958), where the notation is rather distant from that of this entry. Chapter  3.2 of Suppes (1960) contains fewer results, presented as ZFC theorems and using a notation that more resembles that of this entry. Neither Carnap nor Suppes formulated their results using the RA of this entry, or in an equational manner.\nR isIf and only if:FunctionalR\u02d8\u2022R \u2264 I  Left-totalI \u2264 R\u2022R\u02d8 (R\u02d8 is surjective)Functionfunctional and left-total.Injective R\u2022R\u02d8 \u2264 I (R\u02d8 is functional) Surjective I \u2264 R\u02d8\u2022R (R\u02d8 is left-total)Bijection R\u02d8\u2022R = R\u2022R\u02d8 = I (Injective surjective function)TransitiveR\u2022R \u2264 RReflexiveI \u2264 RCoreflexiveR \u2264 IIrreflexiveR \u2227 I = 0SymmetricR\u02d8 = RAntisymmetricR \u2227 R\u02d8 \u2264 IAsymmetricR \u2227 R\u02d8 = 0Total R \u2228 R\u02d8 = 1 Connex I \u2228 R \u2228 R\u02d8 = 1 IdempotentR\u2022R = R Preorder R is transitive and reflexive.EquivalenceR is a symmetric preorder.Partial order R is an antisymmetric preorder.Total order R is a total partial order.Strict partial orderR is transitive and irreflexive.Strict total order R is a connex strict partial order.Dense R \u2227 I\u2212 \u2264 (R \u2227 I\u2212)\u2022(R \u2227 I\u2212).\n\nExpressive power\nThe metamathematics of RA are discussed at length in Tarski and Givant (1987), and more briefly in Givant (2006).\n\nRA consists entirely of equations manipulated using nothing more than uniform replacement and the substitution of equals for equals. Both rules are wholly familiar from school mathematics and from abstract algebra generally. Hence RA proofs are carried out in a manner familiar to all mathematicians, unlike the case in mathematical logic generally.\n\nRA can express any (and up to logical equivalence, exactly the) first-order logic (FOL) formulas containing no more than three variables. (A given variable can be quantified multiple times and hence quantifiers can be nested arbitrarily deeply by \"reusing\" variables.) Surprisingly, this fragment of FOL suffices to express Peano arithmetic and almost all axiomatic set theories ever proposed. Hence RA is, in effect, a way of algebraizing nearly all mathematics, while dispensing with FOL and its connectives, quantifiers, turnstiles, and modus ponens. Because RA can express Peano arithmetic and set theory, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems apply to it; RA is incomplete, incompletable, and undecidable. (N.B. The Boolean algebra fragment of RA is complete and decidable.)\n\nThe representable relation algebras, forming the class RRA, are those relation algebras isomorphic to some relation algebra consisting of binary relations on some set, and closed under the intended interpretation of the RA operations. It is easily shown, e.g. using the method of pseudoelementary classes, that RRA is a quasivariety, that is, axiomatizable by a universal Horn theory. In 1950, Roger Lyndon proved the existence of equations holding in RRA that did not hold in RA. Hence the variety generated by RRA is a proper subvariety of the variety RA. In 1955, Alfred Tarski showed that RRA is itself a variety. In 1964, Donald Monk showed that RRA has no finite axiomatization, unlike RA, which is finitely axiomatized by definition.\n\nQ-relation algebras\nAn RA is a Q-relation algebra (QRA) if, in addition to B1-B10, there exist some A and B such that (Tarski and Givant 1987: \u00a78.4):\n\nQ0: A\u02d8\u2022A \u2264 I\nQ1: B\u02d8\u2022B \u2264 I\nQ2: A\u02d8\u2022B = 1\n\nEssentially these axioms imply that the universe has a (non-surjective) pairing relation whose projections are A and B. It is a theorem that every QRA is a RRA (Proof by Maddux, see Tarski & Givant 1987: 8.4(iii) ).\n\nEvery QRA is representable (Tarski and Givant 1987). That not every relation algebra is representable is a fundamental way RA differs from QRA and Boolean algebras, which, by Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras, are always representable as sets of subsets of some set, closed under union, intersection, and complement.\n\n Examples \n1.  Any Boolean algebra can be turned into a RA by interpreting conjunction as composition (the monoid multiplication \u2022), i.e. x\u2022y is defined as x\u2227y.  This interpretation requires that converse interpret identity (\u045e = y), and that both residuals y\\x and x/y interpret the conditional y\u2192x  (i.e., \u00acy\u2228x).\n\n2.  The motivating example of a relation algebra depends on the definition of a binary relation R on a set X as any subset R \u2286 X\u00b2, where  X\u00b2 is the Cartesian square of X. The power set 2X\u00b2 consisting of all binary relations on X is a Boolean algebra. While  2X\u00b2 can be made a relation algebra by taking R\u2022S = R\u2227S, as per example (1) above, the standard interpretation of \u2022 is instead x(R\u2022S)z = \u2203y:xRy.ySz.  That is, the ordered pair (x,z) belongs to the relation R\u2022S just when there exists y \u2208 X such that (x,y) \u2208 R and (y,z) \u2208 S. This interpretation uniquely determines R\\S as consisting of all pairs (y,z) such that for all x \u2208 X, if xRy then xSz. Dually, S/R consists of all pairs (x,y) such that for all z \u2208 X, if yRz then xSz. The translation \u045e = \u00ac(y\\\u00acI) then establishes the converse R\u02d8 of R as consisting of all pairs (y,x) such that (x,y) \u2208 R.\n\n3.  An important generalization of the previous example is the power set 2E where E \u2286 X\u00b2 is any equivalence relation on the set X. This is a generalization because X\u00b2 is itself an equivalence relation, namely the complete relation consisting of all pairs. While 2E is not a subalgebra of 2X\u00b2 when E \u2260 X\u00b2 (since in that case it does not contain the relation X\u00b2, the top element 1 being E instead of X\u00b2), it is nevertheless turned into a relation algebra using the same definitions of the operations. Its importance resides in the definition of a representable relation algebra as any relation algebra isomorphic to a subalgebra of the relation algebra 2E for some equivalence relation E on some set. The previous section says more about the relevant metamathematics.\n\n4. Let  be group. Then the power set  is a relation algebra with the obvious boolean algebra operations, composition given by the product of group subsets, the converse by the inverse subset (), and the identity by the singleton subset . There is a relation algebra homomorphism embedding  in  which sends each subset  to the relation\n. The image of this homomorphism is the set of all right-invariant relations on . \n\n5. If group sum or product interprets composition, group inverse interprets converse, group identity interprets I, and if R is a one-to-one correspondence, so that R\u02d8\u2022R = R\u2022R\u02d8 = I,Tarski, A. (1941), p. 87. then L is a group as well as a monoid. B4-B7 become well-known theorems of group theory, so that RA becomes a proper extension of group theory as well as of Boolean algebra.\n\nHistorical remarks\nDe Morgan founded RA in 1860, but C. S. Peirce took it much further and became fascinated with its philosophical power. The work of DeMorgan and Peirce came to be known mainly in the extended and definitive form Ernst Schr\u00f6der gave it in Vol. 3 of his Vorlesungen (1890\u20131905). Principia Mathematica drew strongly on Schr\u00f6der's RA, but acknowledged him only as the inventor of the notation. In 1912, Alwin Korselt proved that a particular formula in which the quantifiers were nested four deep had no RA equivalent.Korselt did not publish his finding. It was first published in Leopold Loewenheim (1915) \"\u00dcber M\u00f6glichkeiten im Relativkalk\u00fcl,\" Mathematische Annalen 76: 447\u2013470. Translated as \"On possibilities in the calculus of relatives\" in Jean van Heijenoort, 1967. A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879\u20131931. Harvard Univ. Press: 228\u2013251. This fact led to a loss of interest in RA until Tarski (1941) began writing about it. His students have continued to develop RA down to the present day. Tarski returned to RA in the 1970s with the help of Steven Givant; this collaboration resulted in the monograph by Tarski and Givant (1987), the definitive reference for this subject.

{"title": "Schema (Kant)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_%28Kant%29", "text": "In Kantian philosophy, a transcendental schema (plural: schemata; from , \"form, shape, figure\") is the procedural rule by which a category or pure, non-empirical  concept  is associated with a sense impression. A private, subjective intuition is thereby discursively thought to be a representation of an external object. Transcendental schemata are supposedly produced by the imagination in relation to time.\n\nRole in Kant's architectonic system\nKant created an architectonic system in which there is a progression of phases from the most formal to the most empirical:For an explanation of the logical structure of this progression, see Stephen Palmquist, \"The Architectonic Form of Kant's Copernican Logic\", Metaphilosophy 17:4 (October 1986), pp. 266\u2013288; revised and reprinted as Chapter III of Stephen Palmquist, Kant's System of Perspectives: An architectonic interpretation of the Critical philosophy (Lanham: University Press of America, 1993). Also see the third appendix, entitled \"Common Objections to Architectonic Reasoning. \"Kant develops his system of corporeal nature in the following way. He starts in the Critique with the most formal act of human cognition, called by him the transcendental unity of apperception, and its various aspects, called the logical functions of judgment. He then proceeds to the pure categories of the understanding, and then to the schematized categories, and finally to the transcendental principles of nature in general.\"Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature\", Philosophy of Material Nature It is within this system that the transcendental schemata are supposed to serve a crucial purpose. Many interpreters of Kant have emphasized the importance of the schematism.\"\u2026if the schemata had been considered early enough, they would have overgrown his [Kant\u2019s] whole work.\" (Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vol.  I, Book I, Chapter I, Section 4, Paragraph 35)\"\u2026if we were to reconsider the problem of Kantian schematism, much of the semantics of this century, from the truth\u2013functional to the structural variety, would find itself in difficulty.

Kant wrote the chapter on Schematism in his Critique of Pure Reason to solve the problem of \"...how we can ensure that categories have 'sense and significance.' \"Walsh, W.H., \"Schematism,\" Kant-Studien, Band 49\"The formation of the schema [Schemabildung] is the making sensible of concepts.\" (Martin Heidegger, Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, Indiana University Press, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1997)\n\nA posteriori concepts have sense when they are derived from a mental image that is based on experienced sense impressions. Kant's a priori concepts, on the other hand, are alleged to have sense when they are derived from a non\u2013experienced mental schema, trace, outline, sketch, monogram,A schema is related to a perceived object as a single letter is related to a whole name. or minimal image. This is similar to a Euclidean geometrical diagram.\n\nWhenever two things are totally different from each other, yet must interact, there must be some common characteristic that they share in order to somehow relate to one another. Kantian Categories, or a priori concepts, have, according to Kant, a basic and necessary importance for human knowledge, even though they are totally different from sensations. However, they must be connected in some way with sensed experienceA priori concepts, or Categories, \"require, in order to be meaningful and significant, a certain concrete use \u2014 that is, an application to some intuition by which an object of them is given to us.\" Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, \u00a7 8. because \n\"\u2026 an a priori concept which cannot, as it were, establish any empirical connections is a fraud \u2026 the purpose of the Schematism chapter was to show that the categories at least do have satisfactory empirical connections.\"Walsh, W.H., \"Schematism,\" Kant-Studien, vol. 49\nKant was preoccupied \"with bridging the otherwise heterogeneous poles of 'thought' and 'sensation' in the Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding (A 138/B 177).\"The Cambridge Companion to Kant, George di Giovanni, Chapter 14, \"The first twenty years of critique: The Spinoza connection,\" Page 442, Note 6.Between any two disparate but related things, such as a pure concept and a phenomenal, sensual perception, there must be something that unites, relates, and connects the two. The connector must share some properties with each of those two things that it connects. Kant\u2019s \"transcendental schema\" is a \"third thing, which must stand in homogeneity with the category [pure concept] on the one hand and the phenomenal appearance on the other\u2026.\" This third, connecting thing must be time, because \"a transcendental time-determination is homogeneous with the category (which constitutes its unity) insofar as it is universal and rests on a rule a priori,\" \"but it is on the other hand homogeneous with the phenomenal appearance insofar as time is contained in every empirical representation of the manifold.\" (Critique of Pure Reason, A 138\u20139/B 177\u20138).\n\nExplication of the Kantian account of schemata\n\nThree types of concepts and their schemata\n\nThere are three types of concept that require a schema in order to connect them to perceptions so that they have sense [Sinn] and meaning [Bedeutung]. These three types are (1) empirical concepts, (2) pure (mathematical) sensuous concepts, and (3) pure concepts of the understanding, or Categories. The first two employ schemata. The third employs transcendental schemata.\n\nEmpirical concepts\nAn empirical concept\"Now if a concept is one drawn from the sensory representation, i.e., an empirical concept, it contains as a characteristic, i.e., as a part-representation, something that was already apprehended in the sensory intuition, and differs from the latter in logical form only, viz., in respect of its generality, e.g., the concept of a four-footed animal in the representation of a horse.\" (Bold characters added)  (Kant, What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany since the time of Leibniz and Wolff?, \"First Section Of the Scope of the Theoretico-Dogmatic Use of Pure Reason\") is the abstract thought of that which is common to several perceptions.  When an empirical concept is said to contain an object, whatever is thought in the concept must be intuited in the mental representation of the object.Critique of Pure Reason, A 137 Examples of intuitive perceptions that are the content of empirical concepts are vague images that are imagined in order to connect a concept with the perceptions from which it was derived as their common feature.Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, \"Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy,\" p. 449 f. \"Intuitions,\" Kant wrote, \"are always required to verify or demonstrate the reality of our concepts.\"Critique of Judgment, \u00a7 59 These examples ensure that \"our abstract thinking has not strayed far from the safe ground of perception, and has possibly become somewhat high-flown or even a mere idle display of words.\"Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, \"Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy\", p. 449 This is because \"concepts are quite impossible, and are utterly without meaning or signification, unless an object is given for the concepts themselves, or at least for the elements of which they consist.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 140 For example, \"The concept of a dog signifies a rule according to which my imagination can trace, delineate, or draw a general outline, figure, or shape of a four-footed animal without being restricted to any single and particular shape supplied by experience.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 141 In order to prevent the emptiness of \"thoughts without contents,\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 51  it is \"necessary to make our concepts sensible, i.e., to add an object of intuition to them.\" In order to  test whether a concept is sensible, we sometimes \" \u2026 go back to perception only tentatively and for the moment, by calling up in imagination a perception corresponding to the concept that occupies us at the moment, a perception that can never be quite adequate to the (general) concept, but is a mere representative of it for the time being. \u2026 Kant calls a fleeting phantasm of this kind a schema.\"Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I., Appendix, Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy. p. 449\n\nPure sensuous (mathematical) concepts\nThese are concepts that relate, prior to experience, to the external sense of space and the internal sense of time. As such, they are mathematical in that they refer to geometry and arithmetic. A pure, sensuous concept is the construction or mental drawing of what is common to several geometrical figures. These mathematical concepts are not based on objective visual images. They are based on schemata that exist only in thought. Any particular image could not be as general as the concept. The schemata are rules that allow the imagination to mentally construct or draw or trace a pure, general geometrical form that gives the pure, sensuous concept significance. \"\u2026 [T]o possess the schema corresponding to the concept triangle is to be able to envisage the variety of things to which the word \"triangle\" applies.\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, \"Kant, Immanuel\" \"[T]he schema of sensuous concepts (such as of figures in space) is a product and, as it were, a monogram of the pure imagination a priori. Images become possible only through the schema. But the images must always be connected with the concept only by means of the designated schema. Otherwise, the images can never be fully congruent to the general concept.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 142\n\nPure concepts of the understanding\nA pure concept of the understanding, or category, is a characteristic, predicate, attribute, quality, or property of any possible object, that is, an object in general or as such. These concepts are not abstractions of what is common to several perceived, particular, individual objects, as are empirical concepts. \"Since the categories are a priori and are therefore not abstractions from sense perceptions, they owe their origin to the very nature of the mind itself.\"Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature,\" Part 3 They are not derived from perceptions of external objects, as are empirical concepts. Instead, they are the result of the way that the mind is constituted or formed. They come from within, not without.\n\nKant claimed that the schemata of pure, non-empirical concepts, or categories, provide a reference to intuition in a way similar to the manner of empirical concepts.If a Category [Pure Concept] is to generate knowledge, it must be related to a pure intuition or a priori schema. \"[I]f the concept is a category, a pure concept of the understanding, it lies entirely outside all intuition, and yet an intuition must be subsumed under it if it is to be used for knowledge; and if this knowledge is to be an a priori cognition, a pure intuition must be underlaid, and one which conforms to the synthetic unity of apperception of the manifold in the intuition which is being thought through the category; i.e., the power of representation must interpose beneath the pure concept of the understanding an a priori schema, without which it could have no object at all, and thus serve for no cognition.\" (Kant, What real progress has metaphysics made in Germany since the time of Leibniz and Wolff?, \"First Section Of the Scope of the Theoretico-Dogmatic Use of Pure Reason\") \"If the concepts are empirical, the intuitions are called examples; if they are pure concepts of the understanding, the intuitions are called schemata.\" In the same way that examples provide signification for empirical concepts, schemata help to answer the question of \"whether operating with the categories is anything other than playing with words.\"Walsh, W. H., \"Schematism\", Kant-Studien, Band 49 (1957)\n\nSince the pure concepts of the understanding, or categories, are characteristics of all objects in general, they can never be associated with the image of any specific, particular, individual object. \"Since they are pure, they cannot be pictures...\"Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature,\" Part 3 \"Yet there must be some connection between the abstract idea and the experienced world to which the idea is expected to apply...\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, \"Kant, Immanuel\" \"In order for the pure categories to have objective validity (and not merely subjective validity) they must be related to sensibility.\"Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature,\" Part 3\n\nApplying pure concepts to sense impressions\nThe categories, or pure concepts of the understanding,Critique of Pure Reason A81 are a priori logical innate forms that are conditions of the possibility of things in general, or of things as such.Critique of Pure Reason, A 139 A thing can become a known object of thought when an a posteriori sense impression is comprehended through the forms of the categories.  Categories and sense impressions are totally different from each other. Categories are utterly heterogeneous with the perceptions that are experienced through the sense organs. In order for specific phenomena of Nature to be thought from the combination of categories (pure concepts) and sense perceptions, there must be a third, mediating procedure that connects them. This mediator is a transcendental schema.K\u00f6rner, S., Kant, p. 71ff. Transcendental schemata meaningfully join the empty \"thoughts without content\" and the blind \"intuitions without concepts.\"\n\nSchemata that mediate between empirical (a posteriori) concepts or mathematical (pure sensuous) concepts and perceptions are similar to adapters. Just as adapters are devices for fitting together incompatible parts, schemata connect empirical concepts with the perceptions from which they were derived. Schemata are rules for the production of images. As rules, they are related to concepts. As image\u2013producers, they are related to perceptions. \"While the concept belongs to the understanding and its instance to perception, the schema has, so to speak, a foot in either domain. As rules for the production of images the schemata \u2026 are linked to the understanding; as rules for the production of images they are linked to perception.\"K\u00f6rner, S., Kant, Chapter 4, p. 70 f. The \"adapter\" simile is even more apt in the case of transcendental schemata. This is because pure concepts of the understanding (Categories) are totally unrelated to perceptions. The pure concepts or Categories are original constituent components of the understanding and are not derived from empirical sense perceptions.\n\nTranscendental schemata\nTranscendental schema are not related to empirical concepts or to mathematical concepts. These schemata connect pure concepts of the understanding, or categories, to the phenomenal appearance of objects in general, that is, objects as such, or all objects.K\u00f6rner, S., Kant, p. 72\n\nJudgment\nTranscendental Schematism results from the ability to make judgments. Judgment applies \"the concepts of the understanding [the Categories] to phenomena.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 132 \" \u2026 [T]he judgment \u2026 schematizes these concepts a priori and applies these schemata, without which no experiential judgment would be possible, to each empirical synthesis. \u2026 the transcendental schematism of judgment provides it [judgment] with a rule under which given empirical intuitions are to be subsumed.\"First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment, \u00a7 V, 212 Kant defined  the Greek word hypotyposis as a \" \u2026 rendering perceptible to the senses, making sensual (Versinnlichung).\" The usual definition is \"example, pattern, outline, or sketch.\" If a hypotyposis is schematic, according to Kant,  \"...to a concept, which is comprehended by the understanding, the corresponding intuition is given a priori...\" This is in opposition to a symbolic hypotyposis, like God, in which the concept can only be thought by Reason and to which no sensible intuition can be adequate. Schemata contain direct presentations of the concept. They make this presentation demonstratively, not by the use of analogies. Judgment, according to Kant, works mechanically with given appearances and brings them under concepts. It does this as a tool that is utilized and controlled by both the understanding and the senses.First Introduction to the Critique of Judgment, \u00a7 V, 214\n\nTime\nThe schematism of the pure understanding is \"the sensuous condition [time] under which alone pure concepts of the understanding [the Categories] can be used.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 136  Categories, or pure concepts of the understanding, are abstract representations of objects in general. However, they can result in thought about particular, specific internal or external objects if they are related to time. All concepts are derived from perceptions, therefore pure concepts [Categories] are based on pure perceptions. The purest perception, or schema, is time. Time has the purest relation to sensation that is possible. It is the mere form of sensation because sensations must be felt in succession. Therefore, time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept.\n \nAll things are experienced in time, that is, in succession, one after another. This applies to our internal selves as well as to all external objects. Since categories are the forms through which every specific thing can be thought as being in time, categories are related to time. Thus, pure concepts, or categories, and phenomenal objects share time as a common feature. Therefore, time is the means by which an intuited phenomenon is subsumed under a pure concept. Schemata are transcendental time determinations. \"Hence it will be possible for the category to be applied to appearances by means of the transcendental time determination, which, as the schema of the concepts of the understanding, mediates the subsumption of appearances under the category.\"\n\nSchemata are procedural rules, not images\nBecause schemata are determinations of objects in general, not specific, individual objects, they are not particular images. Kant asserted that \"\u2026 a schema must be distinguished from an image.\"  A schema is a procedural rule.\"The schema is not an image, because the image is a product of the reproductive imagination, while the schema of sensible concepts (also of figures in space) is a product of the pure a priori capacity to imagine\u2026\" (Umberto Eco, Kant and the Platypus, Harcourt, 1999, \u00a7 2.5). Eco compared a Kantian schema to Peano axioms, Wittgenstein's concept of Bild (a proposition that has the same \"form\" as the fact that it represents), and a computer programming flowchart. In this way, it is a procedural rule that provides instructions regarding the construction of a sensible intuition from an abstract, general concept. See also Diego Marconi, Lexical Competence, MIT Press, 1997, pp. 146 ff. The rule prescribes the way to relate a pure concept to an object in general. Schemata are ways of applying pure concepts (categories) to sense impressions. They are prescriptions for graphically illustrating a pure concept. A schema is a method for representing a non-empirical concept in any image as such or any image in general.  \" \u2026 [F]or Kant a schema is not an image, but a capacity to form images or (perhaps) to construct models.\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, \"Kant, Immanuel\" \"The schema of a pure concept of the understanding  is something which can never be made into an image...\"\n\nLewis White BeckProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, Editor's Introduction,\" Bobbs-Merrill Co., 1950. wrote, \"The pure concepts of the understanding\u2026are applied to the pure form of intuition (time) to give rise to the 'transcendental schemata' or rules of the application of pure concepts to whatever sense\u2013impressions we receive.\"  To exemplify this, he continued, \"To take the most important example, we have the hypothetical (if\u2013then) judgment, which is the mode of judgment under the category of cause. This is applied to phenomena in time by the schema of causation, namely, the rule that the cause of a phenomenon is another phenomenon that invariably precedes it in time\u2026.\" In this way, Beck showed that a transcendental schema is the rule that leads to the understanding of successive [in time] sensations according to various pure concepts [Kant's \"categories\"].\n\nIllustrations of different categories and their schemata\nEach category has one schema. Some schemas are shared by other categories in their class.Critique of Pure Reason, A 143 \n The categories of quantity all share the schema of number. Quantity is related to a numerical time series. William H.S. Monck claimed that Kant can be understood as saying \"In apprehending an object I always successively add part to part, and thus generate a series of determinate magnitude.\"William H.S. Monck, Introduction to the Critical Philosophy, p. 43. Unity is one moment in time. Plurality is several moments. Totality is expressed as all moments. But Monck noted that \"Kant does not trace out specially the Schemata of the Categories of Unity, Plurality, and Totality.\" Monck supposed: \"In the Category of Unity I presume we should stop at the first term of the Time\u2013series: for the Category of Plurality we should represent the addition of unit to unit without laying down any determinate limit; and for the Category of Totality we should limit the number of units and complete the addition up to this number.\"William H.S. Monck, Introduction to the Critical Philosophy, p. 43 f.\n  The categories of quality all have degrees of reality as their schema. Quality is related to the content of real being in time. Kant metaphorically explained the schema of quality as the filling up of time with a sensation. Monck paraphrased Kant as saying, \"We may speak of time as being more completely filled when the sensation is more vivid, and less completely filled when the sensation is weaker. If the sensation is sufficiently vivid the present moment is so filled with it that it seems impossible to attend to, or even be conscious of any other sensation simultaneously; but when it becomes weaker we have leisure to perceive other sensations also.William H.S. Monck, Introduction to the Critical Philosophy, p. 44. This occurs by degrees. \"We can represent this filling as taking place by a gradual increase from zero (empty time) to any given degree of vividness, or by a similar descent from the sensation of the moment to zero.\" Reality is the experience of sensation in time. Negation is the absence of sensation in time. Limitation is the range of degrees, between the transition from full to empty, by which things are sensed in time. But Monck stated that \"Again Kant does not here give in detail the Schemata of the Categories of Reality, Negation, and Limitation.\" He qualifiedly suggested that \"In the first case [Reality], we should, perhaps, represent the sensation as occupying the present moment to the exclusion of everything else; in the second [Negation] the sensation as entirely absent from the present moment; in the third [Limitation] the sensation as occupying the present moment along with others.\n  \"The Schema of the Category of Relation is the Order of Time.\"William H.S. Monck, Introduction to the Critical Philosophy, p.44.  In the class of relation, each category has its own schema. Substance's schema is the permanence of the unchanging substance (subject) to which accidents (predicates) belong, or the permanence of the object in time. Causality's schema is the necessary succession of a consequent to an antecedent. That is, \"\u2026 the Schema of the Category of Cause is its regular Antecedence in Time (i.e. Succession in Time determined by fixed law).\"William H.S. Monck, Introduction to the Critical Philosophy, p. 45. The category of community has the schema of the necessary coexistence of the accidents of one substance with the accidents of another substance. This communal interaction consists of the changing accidents of one substance having their cause in the changing accidents of another substance, and vice versa.Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature,\" Part 3 This can be understood as \"\u2026 the Simultaneity of objects in Time.\"\n  \"The Schema of the Category of Modality according to Kant is Time itself as related to the Existence of the object.\" In the class of modality, the category of possibility has the schema of possibility at any time. The schema of actual existence at a certain time belongs to the category of existence. Finally, the category of necessity has the schema of being an object at all times.Critique of Pure Reason, A 145\n\nEven though Kant provided these illustrations and examples of schemata, author John Mahaffy claimed that the topic remained obscure. He wrote, \"I may add, that these illustrations of the various schemata are developed and explained by the succeeding chapters on the Principles which embody them, and that it is impossible to make them clear to the reader until he has studied the theory of the Principles.\"Kant's Critical Philosophy for English Readers, John P. Mahaffy, Note to page 263.\n\nSchematized and unschematized categories\nThe schemata give the categories a \"cash value\",Walsh, W.H., \"Schematism\" as though the category is like paper money and sense experience is analogous to precious metal. A schema is the agreement or harmony of  a category with sensual phenomena. For example, \"Number is the quantity of the phenomenon; sensation is the reality of the phenomenon; the permanence and endurance of things is the substance of the phenomenon, eternity is the necessity of the phenomenon, etc.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 146 In this way, the schemata restrict the categories to conditions of sensibility. \"Schematism and the schemas thus have the property of 'realizing' the categories at the same time as restricting their scope to appearances.\"Howard Caygill, A Kant Dictionary, \"Schema(tism)\" Categories cannot be realized in objects that are not detectable by the senses, that is, are not phenomenal objects or objects that appear to an observer.\n\n\"The schemata of the pure concepts of the understanding are, therefore, the true and sole conditions for providing these concepts with a reference to objects and hence with signification. And therefore the categories have, in the end, no other use than a possible empirical one.\" In order for categories to refer to perceived, experienced objects, they must be schematized. If a category is not schematized, then it has no reference to perception. An unschematized category can be thought, but can not be known. If something can never be perceived, it can never be known. Schemata represent things in general as they appear, not as they might otherwise exist. \"Categories, therefore, without schemata are only functions of the understanding necessary for concepts, but do not themselves represent any object.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 147. Note:By function, Kant means \"\u2026 the unity of the act of ordering various representations under a common representation.\" \u2014 Critique of Pure Reason, A 68 This act results in the formation of one abstract concept from various perceptions or other concepts. With the transcendental determination of time as the transcendental schema, \" \u2026 use of the categories is clearly restricted to the range of things that fall within time \u2014 meaning, for Kant, restricted to phenomena.\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, \"Kant, Immanuel\" Metaphysical entities that are not related to time, such as spontaneous or uncaused movements, immortal souls, and eternal gods, are products of unschematized categories. They can be thought, but not known.\n\nAlternative schemata\nKant said that the schema of a concept is the representation of a general procedure of the imagination by which an image can be supplied for a concept. Kant claimed that time is the only proper and appropriate transcendental schema because it shares the a priori category's generality and purity as well as any a posteriori phenomenon's manner of appearance. However, it may be true that time is not the only possible schema.\n\nSpace\n\"Even more remarkable, however, is the fact that in order to understand the possibility of things as consequent upon the categories, and hence in order to establish the categories' objective reality, we need not merely intuitions but indeed always outer intuitions.\"Critique of Pure Reason, B 291 Since space is the form of all appearances of the outer senses, it may seem that space could serve as a schema. Indeed, any phenomenon that requires space, as well as time, as a form would also need a spatial schema. \"This suggests that he may have thought at one point of recasting the Schematism argument in a fundamental way, by substituting space for time; but if he had this idea, he did not carry it out.\" In the editor's introduction to his translation of the Critique,Critique of Pure Reason, Cambridge University Press, 2000,  p. 10 Paul Guyer asserted that \"\u2026although the content of the transcendental schemata for the categories may be explicated in purely temporal terms, the use of these schemata in turn depends upon judgments about the spatial properties and relations of at least some objects of empirical judgment.\" Guyer claimed that this declaration was clarified in Kant's \"The System of All Principles\" section.Critique of Pure Reason, B 188 ff. In this way, the use of schemata is supposed to involve both space and time, instead of merely time.\n\nOrganism\nIn order to show how time may not be the only schema, Professor Walsh suggested that there is \"\u2026 the possibility of making sense of the categories in organic as opposed to mechanical terms.\" He hypothesized that \"Elements in an organic complex would here take the place of elements in a temporal situation. Substance might be interpreted in terms of growth and form as opposed to what underlies mechanical change, and causality be thought of in terms of purpose and function.\" However, Professor Walsh concluded that Kant's choice of time as schema was more precise than any alternative choices. In spite of the general difficulty in understanding Schematism, he asserted that \"\u2026 Kant's doctrine of schematism, if not altogether satisfactory at the theoretical level, will continue to stand on the strong empirical ground that the schemata offered do enable us to give real meaning to the categories and find for them a genuine use.\"\n\nSchemata of systematic unity\nIn his discussion of the Architectonic of Pure Reason,Critique of Pure Reason, A 832 Kant utilized the concept of schema in a way that was similar to his discussion of the schemata of the Categories. A science's whole systematic organization consists of parts. The parts are various cognitions or units of knowledge.  The parts are united under one idea which determines the relation of the parts to each other and also the purpose of the whole system. A schema is needed to execute, carry out, or realize this unifying idea and put it into effect. This schema is a sketch or outline of the way that the parts of knowledge are organized into a whole system of science. A schema which is sketched, designed, or drafted in accordance with accidental, empirical purposes results in mere technical unity. But a schema that is drawn up from an a priori rational idea is the foundational outline of architectonic unity. Science must have architectonic unity. \"For the schema of what we call science must contain the whole's outline (monogramma) and the whole's division into parts in conformity with the idea \u2014 i.e., it must contain these a priori \u2014 and must distinguish this whole from all others with certainty and according to principles.\"Critique of Pure Reason, A 834 This use of the concept of schema is similar to Kant's previous use. It is a minimal outline, monogram, or diagram that realizes or executes an abstract, general concept or idea (Idee) as actual, perceptual experience.\n\nCriticism\n\nObscurity of the concept \"schema\"\n\nKant introduced the concept of the transcendental schema in his chapter entitled \"Of the Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding.\" It is considered to be one of Kant's more difficult chapters. Even though he knew that he was not writing for a popular readership, Kant twice tried to apologize for this chapter by calling it \"very dry\"Prolegomena to any future metaphysics, \u00a7 34 and \"dry and tedious.\" Kant entered into his 1797 notebook: \"In general, the schematism is one of the most difficult points. \u2013 Even Herr Beck cannot find his way about in it.\"Kant, Notes and Fragments, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 394, 18:686 Professor W.H. Walsh, of the University of Edinburgh, wrote: \"The chapter on Schematism probably presents more difficulties to the uncommitted but sympathetic reader than any other part of the Critique of Pure Reason.  Not only are the details of the argument highly obscure (that, after all, is a common enough experience in reading Kant, though one is not often so baffled as one is here): it is hard to say in plain terms what general point or points Kant is seeking to establish.\"Walsh, W.H., \"Schematism,\" Kant\u2013Studien, Band 49 (1957), K\u00f6lner Universit\u00e4ts\u2013Verlag Arthur Schopenhauer referred to it as \"\u2026the strange 'Chapter on the Schematism of the Pure Concepts of the Understanding,' which is well known for its great obscurity, since no one has ever been able to make anything out of it.\"Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation, Vol. I, Appendix, \"Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy\", Courier Dover Publications, 2012, p. 450 Schopenhauer's notebooks contained entries that described Kant's chapter on schemata as \"an audacious piece of nonsense\"\"\u2026from the chapter on the schematism of the pure concepts of the understanding (a chapter which, in spite of all our respect for Kant, we must call an audacious piece of nonsense) it is very clear that these categories not only contribute nothing towards intuitive perception, but are very far removed from this, since there are still to be found between them and intuitive perception these quite peculiar absurdities, the schemata.\" Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, \"Against Kant,\" p. 466. and the schema as \"an absurdity whose non\u2013existence is plain.\"\"There is \u2026 inserted between the categories and intuitive perception the schema, an absurdity whose non\u2013existence is plain to anyone in his senses\u2026.\" Schopenhauer, Manuscript Remains, Vol. 2, \"Against Kant,\" p. 472. In Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata, he attempted to clear up the obscurity by attributing Kant's concept of schemata simply to a psychological need for architectonic symmetry in his writings.  Empirical concepts are based on empirical perceptions. Kant, however, tried to claim that, analogously, pure concepts (Categories) also have a basis. But this contradicts his previous assertion that pure concepts simply exist in the human mind and are not based on pure, schematic perceptions. Schopenhauer also alleged that schemata were introduced merely to give plausibility to Kant's description of the categories or pure concepts of the understanding. The article on Kant in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy calls Kant's schematism a \"baffling doctrine \" with \"cryptic sentences.\"The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Volume 3, \"Kant, Immanuel\" Josiah Royce referred to \"the perplexing doctrine of the Schema.\"Lectures on Modern Idealism, Lecture II, p. 57 The Scottish philosopher Robert Adamson wrote: \"Kant's manner of explaining the functions of schematism is extremely apt to be misunderstood, and to mislead.\"Robert Adamson, On the Philosophy of Kant, p. 53 f. Kant's early critics (1782 \u20131789) did not discuss schematism because they couldn't follow Kant's explanation.\"It was not clear what the link was between categories and intuitions and how empty forms of the understanding could be applied to sensations. Kant was aware of this problem and tried to address it through the doctrine of the schematism, but his contemporaries were not able to follow him here. Indeed, the doctrine of the schematism was left largely out of consideration by Kant's critics.\" Kant's Early Critics, Edited by Brigitte Sassen, Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 30. Heidegger wrote of \"the dryness and tediousness of this analysis\u2026.\"Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, Indiana U. Press, Bloomington, 1962, \u00a7 22. \"The Transcendental Schematism,\" Page 111 After more than two centuries, Kant's explanation of schema still seems to be unclear to many readers. In their book on parallel distributed processing, the PDP Research Group discussed Kant's schemata when they appropriated that word to designate their concept of  image schemata. \"The schema,\" they wrote, \"throughout history, has been a concept shrouded in mystery. Kant's \u2026 use of the term has been provocative but difficult to understand.\"McClelland, J.L., et al., Parallel Distributed Processing, Vol. 2, p. 17 After this sentence, no further attempt was made to discuss Kant's term and the concept that it designates. H. H. Price, in Thinking and Experience, page 292, referred to Kant\u2019s Schema and wrote, \"\u2026I must confess I do not fully understand it.\" In 2004, Professor Georges Dicker of SUNY Brockport stated: \"I find the Schematism especially opaque\u2026.\"Kant\u2019s Theory of Knowledge: An Analytical Introduction, Georges Dicker, Oxford University Press, \"Preface,\" p. viii.\n\nDiscrepancies\n\nAccording to Professor W. H. Walsh, there is an apparent discrepancy in Kant's central arguments about schematism. Kant, according to Professor Walsh, first claimed that empirical concepts do not require schemata. Only pure concepts need schemata in order to be realized.Walsh, W. H. , \"Schematism\", Kant\u2013Studien, Band 49 (1957) This is because pure concepts are totally different from intuitions, whereas, empirical concepts are abstracted from intuitions and are therefore homogeneous with them. But in another part of his chapter, Kant states that mathematical concepts have schemata. \"In fact,\" he wrote, \"it is schemata, not images of objects, that lie at the basis of our pure sensible (i.e., geometrical) concepts.\"  In discussing schematism as the method of representing in one image a certain mathematical quantity according to a certain concept, he wrote: \"This representation of a general procedure of the imagination by which a concept receives its image, I call the schema of such concept.\"  With regard to pure concepts, Kant then declares, \"The schema of a pure concept of the understanding, on the contrary, is something which can never be made into an image \u2026 .\"\n\nKant, according to Professor Walsh, has two distinct ways of describing schemata. \"Sometimes, as at the beginning of his discussion, he speaks as if a schema were a  feature of things which could be pointed to \u2026 \". In another place, Kant \" \u2026 speaks as if schematism were a procedure \u2026 .\"\n\nProblematic mediation\n\nAccording to Kant, a transcendental schema is a mediating nexus, a third thing (tertium quid; ein Drittes),However, according to Aristotle\u2019s third man argument, there must be a mediator between any two mediated or connected things, including other mediators. This results in an infinite number of mediators. between a pure concept and a phenomenon.Critique of Pure Reason, A 138 This mediation was never satisfactorily explained by Kant, and Charles Sanders Peirce declared that it is a major part of Kant's system. Kant's \"doctrine of the schemata can only have been an afterthought\u2026,\" Peirce wrote.Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vol. I, Book I, Chapter I, \u00a7 4, Paragraph 35, Page 15. Peirce claimed that, at first, Kant severely distinguished between intuitive observation and discursive intellection. Later, Kant proposed that schemata connected the two separate cognitive processes. The theory of mediating schemata was \"an addition to his system after it was substantially complete.\"Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vol. I, Book I, Chapter I, \u00a7 4, Paragraph 35, Page 15 The enormous importance of the concept of the transcendental schema was emphasized by Peirce when he wrote that \"if the schemata had been considered early enough, they would have overgrown his whole work.\"Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce, Vol. I, Book I, Chapter I, \u00a7 4, Paragraph 35, Page 15\n\nAdamson's interpretation\nScottish philosopher Robert Adamson wrote from a Hegelian standpoint. He believed that Kant's analysis of knowledge into the separate topics of  intuition, schema, and concept was mechanical and artificial. Adamson claimed that \"Thought and Intuition are organically united in the schema.\" \"We are not to suppose that the subsumption [of the intuition under the pure notion] is mechanical; that the particular is something distinct from the universal. The union is organic; the particular is only the universal under a special form. The same function of synthesis, which in pure abstraction we call category, is, in realization, the schema, and the intuition is not apart from the schema.\"Robert Adamson, On the Philosophy of Kant, p. 54. Kant's abstract analysis of perceptual knowledge was, according to Adamson, the misleading separation of an organic unity into individual components. He asserted that \"\u2026 we must on no account regard Notion, Schema, and Intuition, as three parts of perception which would exist in isolation.\"Robert Adamson, On the Philosophy of Kant, p. 55.\nThis amalgamation is typical of the Hegelian \"dialectical\" formula in which two apparent opposites are always subsumed or reconciled by some third entity.\n\nPluhar's interpretation\nIn the translator's introduction to his version of Kant's Critique of Judgment, page xxxvi, Werner Pluhar tried to explain schemata. He noted that perceptual  intuitions and Kant's conceptual categories are very different, yet they relate to each other. This exposition by Professor Pluhar paraphrases Kant's doctrine that perceptions are based on concepts. Kant's position can be contrasted with Schopenhauer's opposite teaching that concepts are derived or abstracted from perceptions, thereby giving content to the concepts and allowing them to make sense. This is the very reason why pure concepts, or categories, require schemata. \"Something is needed,\" Pluhar wrote, sharing Kant's viewpoint, \"to mediate between intuition in general and the categories, viz., a rule or 'schema' that stipulates what conditions the intuition must meet so that it can match a category.\" Professor Pluhar then gave a specific example of how time is utilized to accomplish the matching or mediation. His explanation does not resort to presenting schemata through the use of visual analogies such as \"sketches\" or \"outlines.\" Pluhar's schemata are rules. \"In the case of causal relation, the schema is the rule that the effect must follow the cause in time.\" After providing this particular instance, he declared generally that \"\u2026all schemata connect the categories with time\u2026.\" Professor Pluhar then asserted the reason for this schematic connection: \"\u2026time is the only form of intuition that applies to any intuition whatsoever, even to the inner intuition that we have of ourselves, whereas space applies merely to all outer intuitions.\" Oddly enough, schemata do not have to be added as mediators to the categories of causality and substance. These are already temporalized. Time is intrinsic to the relation between cause and effect. Substance, by its very nature, is a thing that continually endures.\n\nWatson on time and schematism\nCanadian professor John Watson, in his discussion of Kantian philosophy, wrote about supposed supersensible, atemporal beings such as God or the soul. Such things are said to have a timeless existence. As such, though, they cannot be known or experienced. Watson asserted that \"\u2026whatever cannot be \u2018schematized\u2019\u2026cannot be known\u2026.\"  Schelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 11.  He considered Kantian schematization as \"\u2026conforming to the process by which the definite or concrete becomes a possible object in time\u2026.\" Schelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 11.  Schematizing an object is representing an object in timeSchelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 15.. Accordingly, timeless \"\u2026supersensible realities\u2026are not capable of being 'schematized,' do not admit of the application to them of the [Kantian] categories and can never become objects of actual sensible experience.\" Schelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 11. \"In the Critique of Pure Reason it has been maintained that no knowledge of supersensible realities can be obtained, since such knowledge always implies a process of determining [or schematizing] objects in time, whilst the supersensible is necessarily free from the limits of timeSchelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 22 f..\" If supersensible objects cannot be schematized because they are not in time, then \"\u2026to the supersensible world\u2026the schematized categories have no application\u2026.\" Schelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 11 f..  If a supersensible thing, like God or the soul, is not in time, then it can\u2019t be schematized, can\u2019t be applied to Kantian categories, and therefore can\u2019t be a known object. Such supersensible entities would have to be schematized through the form of time if they were to be known as having sequentially countable magnitude, gradations of intensive reality, permanent substantiality, or successive causalitySchelling\u2019s Transcendental Idealism, Chicago: S.C. Griggs & Co., 1892, Chapter I, p. 10..\n\nElaborations of Kant's notion of schema in cognitive science\nThe philosopher Mark Johnson discusses Kant's conception of a schema with respect to developing a theory of the imagination within cognitive science.The Body in the Mind: The Bodily Basis of Meaning, Imagination, and Reason, pp. 147-172  Johnson's theory makes use of Kant's insights that analogy is the cognitive mechanism which links sensible percepts to their conceptual categories, and that creative analogy\u2014or what Johnson calls conceptual metaphor\u2014is the cognitive mechanism by which we come to have our understanding of those abstract concepts and categories of which we have less direct sensible experience.  He proposes that we use imaginative schemata to structure abstract concepts largely in terms a set of spatial analogies he calls image schemata.  In Johnson's view, we acquire image schemata primarily from recurrent patterns of experiences in infancy and early childhood, and then reuse these image schemata in a metaphoric fashion both to reason abstractly and as we speak our language.\n\nIn an increase of ambiguity and confusion, some cognitive scientists today have appropriated the often\u2013misused technical term \"schema\" to mean Kantian Category. In his book Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Basic Principles and Applications (Jason Aronson Publishers,1996), Robert L. Leahy of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy in New York City and the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University exemplifies this misuse. In Chapter 2, \"Historical Context of Cognitive Therapy,\" he wrote of how, for Kant, \"reality is never directly knowable, but rather is 'known' through 'categories of thinking.'\" Leahy then stated, \"According to Kant, all knowledge was based on the 'categories' (which today we would call schemas). Consequently, reality was never directly knowable--we only knew the schemas.\" In this way, Kant's concept of \"category,\" or \"pure concept of the understanding,\" is no longer defined as being a predicate, property, quality, or characteristic of any and all objects in general. A Kantian Category is now vaguely considered by cognitive scientists to be a \"schema,\" which was a term that Kant had already used to designate the subsumption of an empirical intuition, through time, under a category or pure concept.\n\nSee also\n\n Schema (psychology)\n Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy\n Schopenhauer's criticism of Kant's schemata\n Image schema\n Category (Kant)\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Adamson, Robert, On the Philosophy of Kant, 1879\n Caygill, Howard, A Kant Dictionary, Blackwell. 1995, \n Ellington, James W., \"The Unity of Kant's Thought in His Philosophy of Corporeal Nature,\" Philosophy of Material Nature, Hackett, 1985, \n Heidegger, Martin, Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics, Indiana U.

The curved surface in question is a portion of a right circular cylinder. The discrete polyhedral approximation considered has  axial \"slices\".  vertices are placed radially along each slice at a circumferential distance of  from each other. Importantly, the vertices are placed so they shift in phase by  with each slice.\n\nthumb|Schwarz lantern with  axial slices and  radial vertices.\n\nHermann Schwarz showed in 1880 that it is not sufficient to simply increase  and   if we wish for the surface area of the polyhedron to converge to the surface area of the curved surface.M.

Thus, the Schwarz lantern demonstrates that simply connecting inscribed vertices is not enough to ensure surface area convergence.\n\nthumb|Animation of Schwarz lantern convergence (or lack thereof) for various refinement strategies.\n\nThe polyhedral surface bears resemblance to a cylindrical paper lantern.\n\nThe sum of the angles at each vertex is equal to two flat angles ( radians). This has as a consequence that the Schwarz lantern can be folded out of a flat piece of paper.\n\nRelation to arc length and surface area\nIn the work of Archimedes it already appears that the length of a circle can be approximated by the length of regular polyhedra inscribed or circumscribed in the circle. \nIn general, for smooth or rectifiable curves their length can be defined as the supremum of the lengths of polygonal curves inscribed in them. The Schwarz lantern shows that surface area cannot be defined as the supremum of inscribed polyhedral surfaces.\n\nHistory\nSchwarz devised his construction as a counterexample to the erroneous definition in J. A. Serret's book Cours de calcul differentiel et integral, second volume, page 296 of the first edition or page 298 of the second edition, in which it is said:\n\nIn English\n\nIndependently of Schwarz, Giuseppe Peano found the same counterexample while a student of his teacher Angelo Genocchi, who already knew about the difficulty on defining surface area from his communication with Schwarz. Genocchi informed Charles Hermite, who had been using Serret's erroneous definition in his course. After requesting details to Schwarz, Hermite revised his course and published the example in the second edition of his lecture notes (1883). The original note from Schwarz was not published until the second edition of his collected works in 1890.\n\nLimits of the area\nA straight circular cylinder of radius  and height  can be parametrized in Cartesian coordinates using the equations\n\nfor  and .

{"title": "Singular solution", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_solution", "text": "A singular solution ys(x) of an ordinary differential equation is a solution that is singular or one for which the initial value problem (also called the Cauchy problem by some authors) fails to have a unique solution at some point on the solution. The set on which a solution is singular may be as small as a single point or as large as the full real line. Solutions which are singular in the sense that the initial value problem fails to have a unique solution need not be singular functions.\n\nIn some cases, the term singular solution is used to mean a solution at which there is a failure of uniqueness to the initial value problem at every point on the curve. A singular solution in this stronger sense is often given as tangent to every solution from a family of solutions. By tangent we mean that there is a point x where ys(x) = yc(x) and  y's(x) = y'c(x) where yc is a solution in a family of solutions parameterized by c. This means that the singular solution is the envelope of the family of solutions.\n\nUsually, singular solutions appear in differential equations when there is a need to divide in a term that might be equal to zero. Therefore, when one is solving a differential equation and using division one must check what happens if the term is equal to zero, and whether it leads to a singular solution. The Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem, which gives sufficient conditions for unique solutions to exist, can be used to rule out the existence of singular solutions. Other theorems, such as the Peano existence theorem, give sufficient conditions for solutions to exist without necessarily being unique, which can allow for the existence of singular solutions.\n\nA divergent solution\nConsider the homogeneous linear ordinary differential\n\nwhere primes denote derivatives with respect to x. The general solution to this equation is \n\nFor a given , this solution is smooth except at  where the solution is divergent. Furthermore, for a given , this is the unique solution going through .\n\nFailure of uniqueness\nConsider the differential equation\n\nA one-parameter family of solutions to this equation is given by\n\nAnother solution is given by\n\nSince the equation being studied is a first-order equation, the initial conditions are the initial x and y values. By considering the two sets of solutions above, one can see that the solution fails to be unique when . (It can be shown that for  if a single branch of the square root is chosen, then there is a local solution which is unique using the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem.) Thus, the solutions above are all singular solutions, in the sense that solution fails to be unique in a neighbourhood of one or more points. (Commonly, we say \"uniqueness fails\" at these points.) For the first set of solutions, uniqueness fails at one point, , and for the second solution, uniqueness fails at every value of . Thus, the solution  is a singular solution in the stronger sense that uniqueness fails at every value of x. However, it is not a singular function since it and all its derivatives are continuous.\n\nIn this example, the solution  is the envelope of the family of solutions . The solution  is tangent to every curve  at the point .\n\nThe failure of uniqueness can be used to construct more solutions. These can be found by taking two constant  and defining a solution  to be  when , to be  when , and to be  when . Direct calculation shows that this is a solution of the differential equation at every point, including  and . Uniqueness fails for these solutions on the interval , and the solutions are singular, in the sense that the second derivative fails to exist, at  and .\n\nFurther example of failure of uniqueness\nThe previous example might give the erroneous impression that failure of uniqueness is directly related to . Failure of uniqueness can also be seen in the following example of a Clairaut's equation:\n\nWe write y' = p and then\n\nNow, we shall take the differential according to x:\n\nwhich by simple algebra yields\n\nThis condition is solved if 2p+x=0 or if p'=0.\n\nIf p'  = 0 it means that y' = p = c = constant, and the general solution of this new equation is:\n\nwhere c is determined by the initial value.\n\nIf x + 2p = 0 then we get that p = \u2212(1/2)x and substituting in the ODE gives\n\nNow we shall check when these solutions are singular solutions. If two solutions intersect each other, that is, they both go through the same point (x,y), then there is a failure of uniqueness for a first-order ordinary differential equation. Thus, there will be a failure of uniqueness if a solution of the first form intersects the second solution.\n\nThe condition of intersection is : ys(x) = yc(x).  We solve\n\nto find the intersection point, which is .\n\nWe can verify that the curves are tangent at this point y's(x) = y'c(x).

{"title": "Stable theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_theory", "text": "In model theory, a complete theory  is called stable if it does not have too many types. One goal of classification theory is to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a theory is not stable then its models are too complicated and numerous to classify, while if a theory is stable there might be some hope of classifying its models, especially if the theory is superstable or totally transcendental.\n\nStability theory was started by , who introduced several of the fundamental concepts, such as totally transcendental theories and the Morley rank. \nStable and superstable theories were first introduced by , who is responsible for much of the development of stability theory. The definitive reference for stability theory is , though it is notoriously hard even for experts to read, as mentioned,  e.g., in .\n\nDefinitions\nT will be a complete theory in some language. \nT is called \u03ba-stable (for an infinite cardinal \u03ba) if for every set A of cardinality \u03ba the set of complete types over A has cardinality \u03ba.\n\u03c9-stable is an alternative name for \u21350-stable.\nT is called stable if it is \u03ba-stable for some infinite cardinal \u03ba\nT is called unstable if it is not \u03ba-stable for any infinite cardinal \u03ba.\nT is called superstable if it is \u03ba-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals \u03ba.\nTotally transcendental theories are those such that every formula has Morley rank less than \u221e.\n\nAs usual, a model of some language is said to have one of these properties if the complete theory of the model has that property.\n\nAn incomplete theory is defined to have one of these properties if every completion, or equivalently every model, has this property.\n\nUnstable theories\nRoughly speaking, a theory is unstable if one can use it to encode the ordered set of natural numbers. More precisely, if there is a model M and a formula \u03a6(X,Y) in 2n variables X\u00a0=\u00a0x1,...,xn and Y\u00a0=\u00a0y1,...,yn defining a relation on  Mn with an infinite totally ordered subset  then the theory is unstable. (Any infinite totally ordered set has a subset isomorphic to either the positive or negative integers under the usual order, so one can assume the totally ordered subset is ordered like the positive integers.) The totally ordered subset need not be definable in the theory.\n\nThe number of models of an unstable theory T of any uncountable cardinality \u03ba\u00a0\u2265\u00a0|T| is the maximum possible number 2\u03ba.\n\nExamples:\nMost sufficiently complicated theories, such as set theories and Peano arithmetic, are unstable.\nThe theory of the rational numbers, considered as an ordered set, is unstable. Its theory is the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints.\nThe theory of addition of the natural numbers is unstable.\nAny infinite Boolean algebra is unstable.\nAny monoid with cancellation that is not a group is unstable, because if a is an element that is not a unit then the powers of a form an infinite totally ordered set under the relation of divisibility. For a similar reason any integral domain that is not a field is unstable.\nThere are many unstable nilpotent groups. One example is the infinite dimensional Heisenberg group over the integers: this is generated by elements xi, yi, z for all natural numbers i, with the relations that any of these two generators commute except that xi and  yi have commutator z for any i.  If  ai is the element x0x1...xi\u22121yi then ai and aj have commutator z exactly when i\u00a0<\u00a0j, so they form an infinite total order under a definable relation, so the group is unstable.\nReal closed fields are unstable, as they are infinite and have a definable total order.\n\nStable theories\nT is called stable if it is \u03ba-stable for some cardinal \u03ba.   \nExamples:\nThe theory of any module over a ring is stable.\nThe theory of a countable number of equivalence relations En for n a natural number such that each equivalence relation has an infinite number of equivalence classes and  each equivalence class of En is the union of an infinite number of different classes of En+1 is stable but not superstable.\n showed that free groups, and more generally torsion free hyperbolic groups, are stable. Free groups on more than one generator are not superstable.\nA differentially closed field is stable. If it has non-zero characteristic it is not superstable, and if it has zero characteristic it is totally transcendental.\n\nSuperstable theories\nT is called superstable if it is stable for all sufficiently large cardinals, so all superstable theories are stable.  For countable T superstability is equivalent to stability for all \u03ba\u22652\u03c9.\nThe following conditions on a theory T are equivalent:\nT is superstable.\nAll types of T are ranked by at least one notion of rank.\nT is \u03ba-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals \u03ba\nT is \u03ba-stable for all  cardinals \u03ba that are at least 2|T|.\n\nIf a theory is superstable but not totally transcendental it is called strictly superstable.\n\nThe number of countable models of a countable superstable theory must be 1, \u21350, \u21351, or 2\u03c9. If the number of models is 1 the theory is totally transcendental.  There are examples with  1, \u21350 or 2\u03c9 models, and it is not known if there are examples with \u21351 models if the continuum hypothesis does not hold. If a theory T is not superstable then the number of models of cardinality \u03ba>|T|  is 2\u03ba.\n\nExamples:\nThe additive group of integers is superstable, but not totally transcendental. It has 2\u03c9 countable models.\nThe theory with a countable number of unary relations Pi with model the positive integers where Pi(n) is interpreted as saying n is divisible by the nth prime is superstable but not totally transcendental.\nAn abelian group A is superstable if and only if there are only finitely many pairs (p,n) with p prime, n a natural number, with pnA/pn+1A infinite.\n\nTotally transcendental theories and \u03c9-stable\nTotally transcendental theories are those such that every formula has Morley rank less than \u221e. Totally transcendental theories are stable in \u03bb whenever \u03bb\u2265|T|, so they are always superstable. \u03c9-stable is an alternative name for \u21350-stable. \u03c9-stable theories  in a countable language are \u03ba-stable for all infinite cardinals \u03ba. If |T| is countable then T is totally transcendental if and only if it is \u03c9-stable. More generally, T is totally transcendental if and only if every restriction of T to a countable language is \u03c9-stable.\n\nExamples:\nAny \u03c9-stable theory is totally transcendental.\nAny finite model is totally transcendental.\nAn infinite field is totally transcendental if and only if it is  algebraically closed. (Macintyre's theorem.)\nA differentially closed field in characteristic 0 is totally transcendental.\nAny theory with a countable language that is categorical for some uncountable cardinal is totally transcendental.\nAn abelian group  is totally transcendental if and only if it is the direct sum of a divisible group and a group of bounded exponent.\nAny linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is totally transcendental.\nAny group of finite Morley rank is totally transcendental.\n\nSee also\nSpectrum of a theory\nMorley's categoricity theorem\nList of first-order theories\nStability spectrum\n\nReferences\nJ.T.

{"title": "Tarski's axioms", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_axioms", "text": "Tarski's axioms, due to Alfred Tarski, are an axiom set for the substantial fragment of Euclidean geometry that is formulable in first-order logic with identity, and requiring no set theory  (i.e., that part of Euclidean geometry that is formulable as an elementary theory). Other modern axiomizations of Euclidean geometry are Hilbert's axioms and Birkhoff's axioms.\n\nOverview\nEarly in his career Tarski taught geometry and researched set theory. His coworker Steven Givant (1999) explained Tarski's take-off point:\nFrom Enriques, Tarski learned of the work of Mario Pieri, an Italian geometer who was strongly influenced by Peano. Tarski preferred Pieri's system [of his Point and Sphere memoir], where the logical structure and the complexity of the axioms were more transparent.\nGivant then says that \"with typical thoroughness\" Tarski devised his system:\nWhat was different about Tarski's approach to geometry? First of all, the axiom system was much simpler than any of the axiom systems that existed up to that time. In fact the length of all of Tarski's axioms together is not much more than just one of Pieri's 24 axioms. It was the first system of Euclidean geometry that was simple enough for all axioms to be expressed in terms of the primitive notions only, without the help of defined notions. Of even greater importance, for the first time a clear distinction was made between full geometry and its elementary \u2014 that is, its first order \u2014 part.\n\nLike other modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, Tarski's employs a formal system consisting of symbol strings, called sentences, whose construction respects formal syntactical rules, and rules of proof that determine the allowed manipulations of the sentences. Unlike some other modern axiomatizations, such as Birkhoff's and Hilbert's, Tarski's axiomatization has no primitive objects other than points, so a variable or constant cannot refer to a line or an angle. Because points are the only primitive objects, and because Tarski's system is a first-order theory, it is not even possible to define lines as sets of points. The only primitive relations (predicates) are \"betweenness\" and \"congruence\" among points.\n\nTarski's axiomatization is shorter than its rivals, in a sense Tarski and Givant (1999) make explicit. It is more concise than Pieri's because Pieri had only two primitive notions while Tarski introduced three: point, betweenness, and congruence. Such economy of primitive and defined notions means that Tarski's system is not very convenient for doing Euclidean geometry. Rather, Tarski designed his system to facilitate its analysis via the tools of mathematical logic, i.e., to facilitate deriving its metamathematical properties. Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written in universal-existential form, a special case of the prenex normal form. This form has all universal quantifiers preceding any existential quantifiers, so that all sentences can be recast in the form  This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is decidable: there exists an algorithm which can determine the truth or falsity of any sentence. Tarski's axiomatization is also complete. This does not contradict G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem, because Tarski's theory lacks the expressive power needed to interpret Robinson arithmetic .\n\n The axioms \n\nAlfred Tarski worked on the axiomatization and metamathematics of Euclidean geometry intermittently from 1926 until his death in 1983, with Tarski (1959) heralding his mature interest in the subject. The work of Tarski and his students on Euclidean geometry culminated in the monograph Schwabh\u00e4user, Szmielew, and Tarski (1983), which set out the 10 axioms and one axiom schema shown below, the associated metamathematics, and a fair bit of the subject. Gupta (1965) made important contributions, and Tarski and Givant (1999) discuss the history.\n\n Fundamental relations \n\nThese axioms are a more elegant version of a set Tarski devised in the 1920s as part of his investigation of the metamathematical properties of Euclidean plane geometry. This objective required reformulating that geometry as a first-order theory. Tarski did so by positing a universe of points, with lower case letters denoting variables ranging over that universe.  Equality is provided by the underlying logic (see First-order logic#Equality and its axioms).Tarski and Givant, 1999, page 177  Tarski then posited two primitive relations:\n Betweenness, a triadic relation. The atomic sentence Bxyz denotes that y is \"between\" x and z, in other words, that y is a point on the line segment xz.  (This relation is interpreted inclusively, so that Bxyz is trivially true whenever x=y or y=z).\n Congruence (or \"equidistance\"), a tetradic relation.  The atomic sentence wx \u2261 yz can be interpreted as wx is congruent to yz, in other words, that the length of the line segment wx is equal to the length of the line segment yz.\n\nBetweenness captures the affine aspect of Euclidean geometry; congruence, its metric aspect. The background logic includes identity, a binary relation. The axioms invoke identity (or its negation) on five occasions.\n\nThe axioms below are grouped by the types of relation they invoke, then sorted, first by the number of existential quantifiers, then by the number of atomic sentences. The axioms should be read as universal closures; hence any free variables should be taken as tacitly universally quantified.\n\n Congruence axioms \n\n Reflexivity of Congruence\n \n\n Identity of Congruence\n \n\n Transitivity of Congruence\n \n\nCommentary\nWhile the congruence relation  is, formally, a 4-way relation among points, it may also be thought of, informally, as a binary relation between two line segments  and .  The \"Reflexivity\" and \"Transitivity\" axioms above, combined, prove both:\n that this binary relation is in fact an equivalence relation\n it is reflexive: .\n it is symmetric .\n it is transitive .\n and that the order in which the points of a line segment are specified is irrelevant.\n .\n .\n .\n\nThe \"transitivity\" axiom asserts that congruence is Euclidean, in that it respects the first of Euclid's \"common notions\".\n\nThe \"Identity of Congruence\" axiom states, intuitively, that if xy is congruent with a segment that begins and ends at the same point, x and y are the same point. This is closely related to the notion of reflexivity for binary relations.\n\n Betweenness axioms \nright|thumb|Pasch's axiom\n Identity of Betweenness\n \nThe only point on the line segment  is  itself.\n\n Axiom of Pasch\n \nThe two diagonals of the quadrilateral  must intersect at some point.\n\nright|thumb|Continuity: \u03c6 and \u03c8 divide the ray into two halves and the axiom asserts the existence of a point b dividing those two halves\n Axiom schema of Continuity\nLet \u03c6(x) and \u03c8(y) be first-order formulae containing no free instances of either a or b. Let there also be no free instances of x in \u03c8(y) or of y in \u03c6(x). Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:\n \nLet r be a ray with endpoint a. Let the first order formulae \u03c6 and \u03c8 define subsets X and Y of r, such that every point in Y is to the right of every point of X (with respect to a). Then there exists a point b in r lying between X and Y. This is essentially the Dedekind cut construction, carried out in a way that avoids quantification over sets.\n\n Lower Dimension\n \nThere exist three noncollinear points.  Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by the one-dimensional real line, a single point, or even the empty set.\n\n Congruence and betweenness \n\nright|thumb|Upper dimension\n Upper Dimension\n \nThree points equidistant from two distinct points form a line. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by three-dimensional or higher-dimensional space.\n\n Axiom of Euclid\nEach of the three variants of this axiom, all equivalent over the remaining Tarski's axioms to Euclid's parallel postulate, has an advantage over the others:\n A dispenses with existential quantifiers;\n B has the fewest variables and atomic sentences;\n C requires but one primitive notion, betweenness. This variant is the usual one given in the literature.\n\n A: \nLet a line segment join the midpoint of two sides of a given triangle. That line segment will be half as long as the third side. This is equivalent to the interior angles of any triangle summing to two right angles.\n\n B: \nGiven any triangle, there exists a circle that includes all of its vertices.\n\nthumb|right|Axiom of Euclid: C\n C: \nGiven any angle and any point v in its interior, there exists a line segment including v, with an endpoint on each side of the angle.\n\n Five Segment\nthumb|right|Five segment\n\nBegin with two triangles, xuz and x'u'z'. Draw the line segments yu and y'u', connecting a vertex of each triangle to a point on the side opposite to the vertex. The result is two divided triangles, each made up of five segments. If four segments of one triangle are each congruent to a segment in the other triangle, then the fifth segments in both triangles must be congruent.\n\n Segment Construction\n \nFor any point y, it is possible to draw in any direction (determined by x) a line congruent to any segment ab.\n\nDiscussion\nStarting from two primitive relations whose fields are a dense universe of points, Tarski built a geometry of line segments. According to Tarski and Givant (1999: 192-93), none of the above axioms are fundamentally new. The first four axioms establish some elementary properties of the two primitive relations. For instance, Reflexivity and Transitivity of Congruence establish that congruence is an equivalence relation over line segments. The Identity of Congruence and of Betweenness govern the trivial case when those relations are applied to nondistinct points. The theorem xy\u2261zz \u2194 x=y \u2194 Bxyx extends these Identity axioms.\n\nA number of other properties of Betweenness are derivable as theorems including:\nReflexivity: Bxxy ;\nSymmetry: Bxyz \u2192 Bzyx ;\nTransitivity: (Bxyw \u2227 Byzw) \u2192 Bxyz ;\nConnectivity: (Bxyw \u2227 Bxzw) \u2192 (Bxyz \u2228 Bxzy).\nThe last two properties totally order the points making up a line segment.\n\nUpper and Lower Dimension together require that any model of these axioms have a specific finite dimensionality. Suitable changes in these axioms yield axiom sets for Euclidean geometry for dimensions 0, 1, and greater than 2 (Tarski and Givant 1999: Axioms 8(1), 8(n), 9(0), 9(1), 9(n) ). Note that solid geometry requires no new axioms, unlike the case with Hilbert's axioms. Moreover, Lower Dimension for n dimensions is simply the negation of Upper Dimension for n - 1 dimensions.\n\nWhen the number of dimensions is greater than 1, Betweenness can be defined in terms of congruence (Tarski and Givant, 1999). First define the relation \"\u2264\" (where  is interpreted \"the length of line segment  is less than or equal to the length of line segment \"):\n\nIn the case of two dimensions, the intuition is as follows:  For any line segment xy, consider the possible range of lengths of xv, where v is any point on the perpendicular bisector of xy.  It is apparent that while there is no upper bound to the length of xv, there is a lower bound, which occurs when v is the midpoint of xy.  So if xy is shorter than or equal to zu, then the range of possible lengths of xv will be a superset of the range of possible lengths of zw, where w is any point on the perpendicular bisector of zu.\n\nBetweenness can then be defined by using the intuition that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line:\n\nThe Axiom Schema of Continuity assures that the ordering of points on a line is complete (with respect to first-order definable properties). The Axioms of Pasch and Euclid are well known. Remarkably, Euclidean geometry requires just the following further axioms:\n Segment Construction. This axiom makes measurement and the Cartesian coordinate system possible\u2014simply assign the value of 1 to some arbitrary non-empty line segment;\n\nLet wff stand for a well-formed formula (or syntactically correct formula) of elementary geometry. Tarski and Givant (1999: 175) proved that elementary geometry is:\nConsistent: There is no wff such that it and its negation are both theorems;\nComplete: Every sentence or its negation is a theorem provable from the axioms;\nDecidable: There exists an algorithm that assigns a truth value to every sentence. This follows from Tarski's:\n Decision procedure for the real closed field, which he found by quantifier elimination (the Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem);\nAxioms admitting of a (multi-dimensional) faithful interpretation as a real closed field.\nGupta (1965) proved the above axioms independent, Pasch and Reflexivity of Congruence excepted.\n\nNegating the Axiom of Euclid yields hyperbolic geometry, while eliminating it outright yields absolute geometry. Full (as opposed to elementary) Euclidean geometry requires giving up a first order axiomatization: replace \u03c6(x) and \u03c8(y) in the axiom schema of Continuity with x \u2208 A and y \u2208 B, where A and B are universally quantified variables ranging over sets of points.\n\nComparison with Hilbert\nHilbert's axioms for plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and a variant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invoked in the remarks to Tarski's axioms is triangle. (Versions B and C of the Axiom of Euclid refer to \"circle\" and \"angle,\" respectively.) Hilbert's axioms also require \"ray,\" \"angle,\" and the notion of a triangle \"including\" an angle. In addition to betweenness and congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive binary relation \"on,\" linking a point and a line. The Axiom schema of Continuity plays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema is indispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannot be finitely axiomatized as a first-order theory. Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms require second-order logic.\n\nThe first four groups of axioms of Hilbert's axioms for plane geometry are bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.\n\nSee also\n Euclidean geometry\n Euclidean space\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nGivant, Steven (1999) \"Unifying threads in Alfred Tarski's Work\", Mathematical Intelligencer 21:47\u201358.\nGupta, H.

(weltsprache.) by Elias Molee\nTutonish (also called Teutonish, Teutonik, Allteutonish, Altutonish, Alteutonik, Nu Teutonish, Niu Teutonish, or Neuteutonish) is a constructed language created by Elias Molee. He worked on it for several years, and he reformed it multiple times, in 1906 under the name nu teutonish, in 1911 under the name altutonish and in 1915 under the name alteutonik. It is known to be the first Pan-Germanic language.\n\nIn creating it, Molee was clearly influenced by Giuseppe Peano but chose to create a language for people based on Germanic roots instead of Romance ones. However, he created an \"inter-Romance\" version of his language to be used among Romance-speaking people as well.\n\n The Four Fundamental Principles (Alteutonik, 1915) \nMolee's points to several principles his work is based on. \nFirst principle\nThe ease of the suggestive action is as strong in proportion to the number of times the words and ideas have been associated in consciousness. (Herbert Spencer); All teutonic children have heard a homogeneous words arm and bone; hence armbone would be more suggestive than the Latin heterogeneours humerus. \n2nd principle\nThe more mental energy required to master the words, the less mental energy is left for the ideas contained.\n3rd principle\nLanguage should proceed from the known to the unknown.\n4th principle\nLanguage should proceed from the simple to the complex.\n\nInside his works Molee often reclaims that zonal constructed language strictly should be \"selvklar\" (self-explanatory) and homogeneous.\n\n Characteristics \nTutonish had a simple phonetic pronunciation, a simple grammar based on the English grammar (\"Fifteen rules\") and a simple orthography, without majuscule. The \"Germanic\" version's vocabulary was built on roots taken from English, Dutch, German and Scandinavian languages, while the \"Romance\" version's vocabulary was mostly built on Latin and Romance languages.\n\n Copyleft \nAlteutonik, 1915, page 38, mentioned copyleft \"kein ferfasero rekt\"; \"nur to erwana e ferfasr\" (only author needs to be mentioned).\n\n Criticism \nLouis Couturat and L\u00e9opold Leau wrote, in their Histoire de la langue universelle, not very enthusiastically about Tutonish. That verifies Tutonish has to be categorized Zonal constructed language.\nWithout criticizing the project of Monsieur Molee, he must permit as to note that he is inspired by motives absolutely opposite to human and civilization scopes of international language and to neutrality postulated in it.\n\nExamples\n\nThe Germanic version (Tutonish 1901, N(i)u Teutonish 1906, Alteutonik 1915 ?) of the Lord's Prayer\nvio fadr hu bi in himl; holirn be dauo nam; dauo reich kom; dauo vil be dun an erd, als it bi in himl; giv vi dis dag vio dagli bred; en fergiv vi vio shulds, als vi fergiv vio shulders; en lied vi nit inzu fersieku but frie vi fon ievl. let so bi.\n\nThe Romance version of the Lord's Prayer\nNuo padr, ki bi in siel, sanktirn bi tuo nom, tuo regnu ven, tuo vol bi fasn sur ter kom in siel; don nu hoy nuo diali pan; et pardon nu nuo debits, kom nu pardon nuo debitors; et induk nu non in tentu ma delivr nu de mal.\n\nNumbers from one to ten (according to Alteutonik, 1915)\n12345678910 ein tvo tri fir fem seks syv ot ni ti\n\nThe origins of Tutonish - e urspringe ov teutonik\nelias molee, e ferfasr ov teutonik isn (war) geb\u00e4rn 3a einam (januari) 1845 ov eltera, wer komen fon norvegia to 1 platz 30 kilometra fon e stad ov milwaukee ... ale nakbara havn file kinda, wer kanen nur spreka sine eigena teutonike moderspraka.\n\nElias Molee, the author of tutonish, was born on January 3, 1845 to parents who emigrated from Norway, in a place 30 kilometers from Milwaukee ... in the entire neighborhood there was a lot of other children who only spoke their own Germanic mother tongues.\n\nSome sentences\ndau shal not baer falsh vitnesu gegn dauo nabor. \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.\"\nein union spiek, makn up ov deuch, english, skandinavish and hollandi, for to agenfererein al tutonish folka into ein spiek mitin feivti jiera.\n\n See also \n Folkspraak\n\n Bibliography \n Molee, Elias:\n Plea for an American Language, or Germanic-English.

{"title": "Z curve", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_curve", "text": "thumb|400x400px|Z curve of C.elegans chromosome III\nThe Z curve (or Z-curve) method is a bioinformatics algorithm for genome analysis. The Z-curve is a three-dimensional curve that constitutes a unique representation of a DNA sequence, i.e., for the Z-curve and the given DNA sequence each can be uniquely reconstructed from the other.\nThe resulting curve has a zigzag shape, hence the name Z-curve.\n\n Background \nThe Z Curve method was first created in 1994 as a way to visually map a DNA or RNA sequence. Different properties of the Z curve, such as its symmetry and periodicity can give unique information on the DNA sequence. The Z curve is generated from a series of nodes, P0, P1,\u2026PN, with the coordinates xn, yn, and zn (n=0,1,2\u2026N, with N being the length of the DNA sequence). The Z curve is created by connecting each of the nodes sequentially.\n\n Applications \nInformation on the distribution of nucleotides in a DNA sequence can be determined from the Z curve. The four nucleotides are combined into six different categories. The nucleotides are placed into each category by some defining characteristic and each category is designated a letter.    \nPurineR = A, GAminoM = A, CWeak Hydrogen BondsW = A, TPyrimidineY = C, TKetoK = G, TStrong Hydrogen BondsS = G, C\nThe x, y, and z components of the Z curve display the distribution of each of these categories of bases for the DNA sequence being studied. The x-component represents the distribution of purines and pyrimidine bases (R/Y). The y-component shows the distribution of amino and keto bases (M/K) and the z-component shows the distribution of strong-H bond and weak-H bond bases (S/W) in the DNA sequence.\n\nThe Z-curve method has been used in many different areas of genome research, such as replication origin identification,, ab initio gene prediction,\nisochore identification,\ngenomic island identification\nand comparative genomics. Analysis of the Z curve has also been shown to be able to predict if a gene contains introns,\n\n Research \nExperiments have shown that the Z curve can be used to identify the replication origin in various organisms. One study analyzed the Z curve for multiple species of Archaea and found that the oriC is located at a sharp peak on the curve followed by a broad base. This region was rich in AT bases and had multiple repeats, which is expected for replication origin sites. This and other similar studies were used to generate a program that could predict the origins of replication using the Z curve.\n\nThe Z curve has also been experimentally used to determine phylogenetic relationships. In one study, a novel coronavirus in China was analyzed using sequence analysis and the Z curve method to determine its phylogenetic relationship to other coronaviruses. It was determined that similarities and differences in related species can quickly by determined by visually examining their Z curves. An algorithm was created to identify the geometric center and other trends in the Z curve of 24 species of coronaviruses. The data was used to create a phylogenetic tree. The results matched the tree that was generated using sequence analysis. The Z curve method proved superior because while sequence analysis creates a phylogenetic tree based solely on coding sequences in the genome, the Z curve method analyzed the entire genome.\n\n Criticism and Limitations \nThe Z curve method has been criticized for over analyzing the genomic sequence and including parameters that are not significant. One study analyzed 235 genomes of bacteria and determined that the z coordinate of the Z curve accounted for 99.9% of the genetic variance and the x and y coordinates were not meaningful in studying nucleotide composition. The original authors of the Z curve method have since published a rebuttal indicating that the criticisms confuse numeral smallness with biological insignificance, because variations of purine/pyrimidine and amino/keto bases (x and y components), although less than that of GC content, contain rich information that is important and useful, such as in locating replication origins of bacterial and archaeal genomes.\n\nSimilar methods of visually representing genomic sequences have since been created that are better equipped to identify a broad range of genomic structures. The DNA Hilbert\u2013Peano curve is a 2D color image of a genomic sequence that can highlight all structures of interest in a sequence at once.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nThe Z curve database\n \u2014 a free, web-based program for predicting \"origins of replication\" using Z-curves.\nENCODE threads explorer  Three-dimensional connections across the genome.

{"title": "Axiom of reducibility", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_reducibility", "text": "The axiom of reducibility was introduced by Bertrand Russell in the early 20th century as part of his ramified theory of types. Russell devised and introduced the axiom in an attempt to manage the contradictions he had discovered in his analysis of set theory.\n\nHistory\nWith Russell's discovery (1901, 1902)According to van Heijenoort 1967:124, Russell discovered the paradox in June 1901. van Heijenoort in turn references Bertrand Russell (1944) \"My mental development\" in The philosophy of Bertrand Russell, edited by Paul Arthur Schilpp (Tudor, New York), page 13. But Russell did not report it to Frege until his letter to Frege dated 16 June 1902. Livio 2009:186 reports the same date. Livio 2009:191 writes that Zermelo discovered the paradox as early as 1900, but does not give his source for this (Ewald 1996?). Indeed, Zermelo makes this claim in a footnote 9 to his 1908 A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering in van Heijenoort 1967:191. of a paradox in Gottlob Frege's 1879 Begriffsschrift and Frege's acknowledgment of the same (1902), Russell tentatively introduced his solution as \"Appendix B: Doctrine of Types\" in his 1903 The Principles of Mathematics.Cf. Introductory remarks by W. V. O. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150. This contradiction can be stated as \"the class of all classes that do not contain themselves as elements\".Cf. Introductory remarks by W. V. O. Quine preceding Bertrand Russell (1908a) reprinted in van Heijenoort 1967:150. At the end of this appendix Russell asserts that his \"doctrine\" would solve the immediate problem posed by Frege, but \"there is at least one closely analogous contradiction which is probably not soluble by this doctrine. The totality of all logical objects, or of all propositions, involves, it would seem a fundamental logical difficulty. What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of reasoning...\"Russell 1903:528\n\nBy the time of his 1908 Mathematical logic as based on the theory of typesreprinted in van Heijenoort 150\u2013182 Russell had studied \"the contradictions\" (among them the Epimenides paradox, the Burali-Forti paradox, and Richard's paradox) and concluded that \"In all the contradictions there is a common characteristic, which we may describe as self-reference or reflexiveness\".Russell 1908:154. The exact wording appears in Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:60  \n\nIn 1903, Russell defined predicative functions as those whose order is one more than the highest-order function occurring in the expression of the function. While these were fine for the situation, impredicative functions had to be disallowed:\n\nHe repeats this definition in a slightly different way later in the paper (together with a subtle prohibition that they would express more clearly in 1913):\n\nThis usage carries over to Alfred North Whitehead and Russell's 1913 Principia Mathematica wherein the authors devote an entire subsection of their Chapter II: \"The Theory of Logical Types\" to subchapter I. The Vicious-Circle Principle: \"We will define a function of one variable as predicative when it is of the next order above that of its argument, i.e. of the lowest order compatible with its having that argument. . . A function of several arguments is predicative if there is one of its arguments such that, when the other arguments have values assigned to them, we obtain a predicative function of the one undetermined argument.\"Whitehead and Russell 1913 reprinted to *53 1962:53\n\nThey again propose the definition of a predicative function as one that does not violate The Theory of Logical Types. Indeed the authors assert such violations are \"incapable [to achieve]\" and \"impossible\":\n\nThe authors stress the word impossible:\n\nRussell's axiom of reducibility\nThe axiom of reducibility states that any truth function (i.e. propositional function) can be expressed by a formally equivalent predicative truth function. It made its first appearance in Bertrand Russell's (1908) Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types, but only after some five years of trial and error.Cf. commentary by W. V. O. Quine in van Heijenoort 1967:150\u2013152 In his words: \n\nFor relations (functions of two variables such as \"For all x and for all y, those values for which f(x,y) is true\" i.e. \u2200x\u2200y: f(x,y)), Russell assumed an axiom of relations, or [the same] axiom of reducibility.\n\nIn 1903, he proposed a possible process of evaluating such a 2-place function by comparing the process to double integration: One after another, plug into x definite values am (i.e. the particular aj is \"a constant\" or a parameter held constant), then evaluate f(am,yn) across all the n instances of possible yn. For all yn evaluate f(a1, yn), then for all yn evaluate f(a2, yn), etc until all the x = am are exhausted). This would create an m by n matrix of values: TRUE or UNKNOWN. (In this exposition, the use of indices is a modern convenience.) \n\nIn 1908, Russell made no mention of this matrix of x, y values that render a two-place function (e.g. relation) TRUE, but by 1913 he has introduced a matrix-like concept into \"function\". In *12 of Principia Mathematica (1913) he defines \"a matrix\" as \"any function, of however many variables, which does not involve any apparent variables. Then any possible function other than a matrix is derived from a matrix by means of generalisation, i.e. by considering the proposition which asserts that the function in question is true with all possible values or with some values of one of the arguments, the other argument or arguments remaining undetermined\".Whitehead and Russell 1913:162 For example, if one asserts that \"\u2200y: f(x, y) is true\", then x is the apparent variable because it is unspecified. \n\nRussell now defines a matrix of \"individuals\" as a first-order matrix, and he follows a similar process to define a second-order matrix, etc. Finally, he introduces the definition of a predicative function:\n\nFrom this reasoning, he then uses the same wording to propose the same axioms of reducibility as he did in his 1908.\n\nAs an aside, Russell in his 1903 considered, and then rejected, \"a temptation to regard a relation as definable in extension as a class of couples\",Russell 1903:99 i.e. the modern set-theoretic notion of ordered pair. An intuitive version of this notion appeared in Frege's (1879) Begriffsschrift (translated in van Heijenoort 1967:23); Russell's 1903 followed closely the work of Frege (cf. Russell 1903:505ff). Russell worried that \"it is necessary to give sense to the couple, to distinguish the referent from the relatum: thus a couple becomes essentially distinct from a class of two terms, and must itself be introduced as a primitive idea. It would seem, viewing the idea philosophically, that sense can only be derived from some relational proposition . . . it seems therefore more correct to take an intensional view of relations, and to identify them rather with class-concepts than with classes\".Russell 1903:99 As shown below, Norbert Wiener (1914) reduced the notion of relation to class by his definition of an ordered pair.\n\nCriticism\n\nZermelo 1908\nThe outright prohibition implied by Russell's axiom of reducibility was roundly criticised by Ernst Zermelo in his 1908 Investigations in the foundations of set theory I, stung as he was by a demand similar to that of Russell that came from Poincar\u00e9:\n\nZermelo countered:\n\nWiener 1914\nIn his 1914 A simplification of the logic of relations, Norbert Wiener removed the need for the axiom of reducibility as applied to relations between two variables x, and y e.g. \u03c6(x,y). He did this by introducing a way to express a relation as a set of ordered pairs: \"It will be seen that what we have done is practically to revert to Schr\u00f6der's treatment of a relation as a class [set] of ordered couples\".Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:226 Van Heijenoort observes that \"[b]y giving a definition of the ordered pair of two-elements in terms of class operations, the note reduced the theory of relations to that of classes.\"Wiener in van Heijenoort 1967:224 But Wiener opined that while he had dispatched Russell and Whitehead's two-variable version of the axiom *12.11, the single-variable version of the axiom of reducibility for (axiom *12.1 in Principia Mathematica) was still necessary.Wiener 1914 in van Heijenoort 1967:224\n\nWittgenstein 1918\nLudwig Wittgenstein, while imprisoned in a prison camp, finished his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. His introduction credits \"the great works of Frege and the writings of my friend Bertrand Russell\". Not a self-effacing intellectual, he pronounced that \"the truth of the thoughts communicated here seems to me unassailable and definitive. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the problems have in essentials been finally solved.\"Wittgenstein 1922 in HarperCollins 2009:4 So given such an attitude, it is no surprise that Russell's theory of types comes under criticism:\n\nThis appears to support the same argument Russell uses to erase his \"paradox\". This \"using the signs\" to \"speak of the signs\" Russell criticises in his introduction that preceded the original English translation:\n\nThis problem appears later when Wittgenstein arrives at this gentle disavowal of the axiom of reducibility\u2014one interpretation of the following is that Wittgenstein is saying that Russell has made (what is known today as) a category error; Russell has asserted (inserted into the theory) a \"further law of logic\" when all the laws (e.g. the unbounded Sheffer stroke adopted by Wittgenstein) have already been asserted:\n\nRussell 1919\nBertrand Russell in his 1919 Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, a non-mathematical companion to his first edition of PM, discusses his Axiom of Reducibility in Chapter 17 Classes (pp.\u00a0146ff).  He concludes that \"we cannot accept \"class\" as a primitive idea; the symbols for classes are \"mere conveniences\" and classes are \"logical fictions, or (as we say) 'incomplete symbols' ... classes cannot be regarded as part of the ultimate furniture of the world\" (p.\u00a0146). The reason for this is because of the problem of impredicativity: \"classes cannot be regarded as a species of individuals, on account of the contradiction about classes which are not members of themselves ... and because we can prove that the number of classes is greater than the number of individuals, [etc]\". What he then does is propose 5 obligations that must be satisfied with respect to a theory of classes, and the result is his axiom of reducibility. He states that this axiom is \"a generalised form of Leibniz's identity of indiscernibles\" (p.\u00a0155). But he concludes Leibniz's assumption is not necessarily true for all possible predicates in all possible worlds, so he concludes that:\n\nThe goal that he sets for himself then is \"adjustments to his theory\" of avoiding classes:\n\nSkolem 1922\nThoralf Skolem in his 1922 Some remarks on axiomatised set theory took a less than positive attitude toward \"Russell and Whitehead\" (i.e. their work Principia Mathematica):\n\nSkolem then observes the problems of what he called \"nonpredicative definition\" in the set theory of Zermelo:<ref>Zermelo stipulates that there exist \"a domain B of objects, among which are the sets.\" But by a theorem Zermelo proves that this domain B cannot be a set itself \"and this disposes of the Russell antinomy so far as we are concerned.\" (Cf. Zermelo 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:203.) The ultimate problem (to be answered by Skolem [1922] and Fraenkel [1922]) is a precise definition of Zermelo's notion of definite property which, via Zermelo's Axiom of separation (Axiom der Aussonderung), when applied via a propositional function to a set M, separates from M a subset e.g. M1 (Skolem 1922 in van Heijenoort 1967:292).</ref>\n\nWhile Skolem is mainly addressing a problem with Zermelo's set theory, he does make this observation about the axiom of reducibility:\n\nRussell 1927\nIn his 1927 \"Introduction\" to the second edition of Principia Mathematica, Russell criticises his own axiom:\n\nWittgenstein's 5.54ff is more centred on the notion of function:\n\nA possible interpretation of Wittgenstein's stance is that the thinker A i.e. p is identically the thought p, in this way the \"soul\" remains a unit and not a composite. So to utter \"the thought thinks the thought\" is nonsense, because per 5.542 the utterance does not specify anything.\n\nvon Neumann 1925\nJohn von Neumann in his 1925 \"An axiomatisation of set theory\" wrestled with the same issues as did Russell, Zermelo, Skolem, and Fraenkel. He summarily rejected the effort of Russell:\n\nHe then notes the work of the set theorists Zermelo, Fraenkel and Schoenflies, in which \"one understands by \"set\" nothing but an object of which one knows no more and wants to know no more than what follows about it from the postulates. The postulates [of set theory] are to be formulated in such a way that all the desired theorems of Cantor's set theory follow from them, but not the antinomies.von Neumann in van Heijenoort 1967:395\n\nWhile he mentions the efforts of David Hilbert to prove the consistency of his axiomatisation of mathematicsvon Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:395 von Neumann placed him in the same group as Russell. Rather, von Neumann considered his proposal to be \"in the spirit of the second group ... We must, however, avoid forming sets by collecting or separating elements [durch Zusammenfassung oder Aussonderung von Elementen], and so on, as well as eschew the unclear principle of 'definiteness' that can still be found in Zermelo. [...] We prefer, however, to axiomatise not 'set' but 'function'.\"von Neumann 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:401\n\nVan Heijenoort observes that ultimately this axiomatic system of von Neumann's, \"was simplified, revised, and expanded ... and it come to be known as the von Neumann-Bernays-G\u00f6del set theory.\"van Heijenoort 1967:394\n\nDavid Hilbert 1927\nDavid Hilbert's axiomatic system that he presents in his 1925 The Foundations of Mathematics is the mature expression of a task he set about in the early 1900s but let lapse for a while (cf. his 1904 On the foundations of logic and arithmetic). His system is neither set theoretic nor derived directly from Russell and Whitehead. Rather, it invokes 13 axioms of logic\u2014four axioms of Implication, six axioms of logical AND and logical OR, 2 axioms of logical negation, and 1 \u03b5-axiom (\"existence\" axiom)-- plus a version of the Peano axioms in 4 axioms including mathematical induction, some definitions that \"have the character of axioms, and certain recursion axioms that result from a general recursion schema\"Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467 plus some formation rules that \"govern the use of the axioms\".Hilbert 1925 in van Heijenoort 1967:467 \n\nHilbert states that, with regard to this system, i.e. \"Russell and Whitehead's theory of foundations[,] ... the foundation that it provides for mathematics rests, first, upon the axiom of infinity and, then upon what is called the axiom of reducibility, and both of these axioms are genuine contentual assumptions that are not supported by a consistency proof; they are assumptions whose validity in fact remains dubious and that, in any case, my theory does not require ... reducibility is not presupposed in my theory ... the execution of the reduction would be required only in case a proof of a contradiction were given, and then, according to my proof theory, this reduction would always be bound to succeed.\"Boldface added, Hilbert in van Heijenoort 1967:473\n\nIt is upon this foundation that modern recursion theory rests.\n\nRamsey 1925\nIn 1925, Frank Plumpton Ramsey argued that it is not needed.The Foundations of Mathematics (1925), pages 1..61 of The Foundations of Mathematics, F. P. Ramsey, Littlefield Adams & Co, Paterson New Jersey, 1960 However in the second edition of Principia Mathematica (1927, page xiv) and in Ramsey's 1926 paperMathematical Logic, pages 62..61, op. cit. it is stated that certain theorems about real numbers could not be proved using Ramsey's approach.  Most later mathematical formalisms (Hilbert's Formalism or Brower's Intuitionism for example) do not use it.\n\nRamsey showed that it is possible to reformulate the definition of predicative by using the definitions in Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus.  As a result, all functions of a given order are predicative, irrespective of how they are expressed.  He goes on to show that his formulation still avoids the paradoxes.  However, the \"Tractatus\" theory did not appear strong enough to prove some mathematical results.\n\nG\u00f6del 1944\nKurt G\u00f6del in his 1944 Russell's mathematical logic offers in the words of his commentator Charles Parsons, \"[what] might be seen as a defense of these [realist] attitudes of Russell against the reductionism prominent in his philosophy and implicit in much of his actual logical work. It was perhaps the most robust defense of realism about mathematics and its objects since the paradoxes and come to the consciousness of the mathematical world after 1900\".This commentary appears on pages 102\u2013118, and the paper itself on pages 119\u2013141 appears in 1990 Kurt G\u00f6del: Collected Works, Volume II, Oxford University Press, New York, NY, . \n\nIn general, G\u00f6del is sympathetic to the notion that a propositional function can be reduced to (identified with) the real objects that satisfy it, but this causes problems with respect to the theory of real numbers, and even integers (p.\u00a0134). He observes that the first edition of PM \"abandoned\" the realist (constructivistic) \"attitude\" with his proposal of the axiom of reducibility (p.\u00a0133). However, within the introduction to the second edition of PM (1927) G\u00f6del asserts \"the constructivistic attitude is resumed again\" (p.\u00a0133) when Russell \"dropped\" of the axiom of reducibility in favour of the matrix (truth-functional) theory; Russell \"stated explicitly that all primitive predicates belong to the lowest type and that the only purpose of variables (and evidently also of constants) is to make it possible to assert more complicated truth-functions of atomic propositions ... [i.e.] the higher types and orders are solely a fa\u00e7on de parler\" (p.\u00a0134). But this only works when the number of individuals and primitive predicates is finite, for one can construct finite strings of symbols such as:\n [example on page 134]\nAnd from such strings one can form strings of strings to obtain the equivalent of classes of classes, with a mixture of types possible. However, from such finite strings the whole of mathematics cannot be constructed because they cannot be \"analyzed\", i.e. reducible to the law of identity or disprovable by a negations of the law:\n\nBut he observes that \"this procedure seems to presuppose arithmetic in some form or other\" (p.\u00a0134), and he states in the next paragraph that \"the question of whether (or to what extent) the theory of integers can be obtained on the basis of the ramified hierarchy must be considered as unsolved.\" (p.\u00a0135)\n\nG\u00f6del proposed that one should take a \"more conservative approach\":\n\nQuine 1967\nIn a critique that also discusses the pros and cons of Ramsey (1931)W. V. O. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150\u2013152 W. V. O. Quine calls Russell's formulation of \"types\" to be \"troublesome ... the confusion persists as he attempts to define nth order propositions'... the method is indeed oddly devious ... the axiom of reducibility is self-effacing\", etc.Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) in van Heijenoort 1967:151\n\nLike Stephen Kleene Quine observes that Ramsey (1926),Kleene 1952:532 gives this reference: \"Ramsey, F. P. 1926, The foundations of mathematics, Proc. London Math. Soc., ser. 2, vol. 25, pp. 338\u2013384. Reprinted as pp. 1\u201361 in The foundations of mathematics and other logical essays by F. P. Ramsey, ed. by R. B. Braithwaite, London (Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner) and new your (Harcourt, brace) 1931. The latter reprinted London (Routledge and Kegan Paul) and New York (Humanities Press) 1950.\" (1931) divided the various paradoxes into two varieties (i) \"those of pure set theory\" and (ii) those derived from \"semantic concepts such as falsity and specifiability\", and Ramsey believed that the second variety should have been left out of Russell's solution. Quine ends with the opinion that \"because of the confusion of propositions with sentences, and of attributes with their expressions, Russell's purported solution of the semantic paradoxes was enigmatic anyway.\"W. V. O. Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:150\u2013152. Kleene (1952) is less sanguine about the problem of the paradoxes, cf. Kleene 1952:43. Kleene 1952 analyzes the situation this way: that Ramsey 1926 classifies the paradoxes as the \"logical\" versus the \"epistomolical or \"semantical\" and Ramsey observes that the logical antinomies are (apparently) stopped by the simple hierarchy of types, and the semantical ones are (apparently) prevented ... by the absence ... of the requisite means for referring to expressions in the same language. But Ramsey's arguments to justify impredicative definitions within a type entail a conception of the totality of predicates of the type as existing independently of their constructibility or definability\"; thus neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded (see at Kleene 1952)\n\nKleene 1952\nIn his section \"\u00a712. First inferences from the paradoxes\" (subchapter \"LOGICISM\"), Stephen Kleene (1952) traces the development of Russell's theory of types:\n\nKleene observes that \"to exclude impredicative definitions within a type, the types above type 0 [primary objects or individuals \"not subjected to logical analysis\"] are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1 [properties of individuals, i.e. logical results of the propositional calculus ], properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to order 0, and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order below to the next higher order)\".Kleene 1952:44\n\nKleene, however, parenthetically observes that \"the logicistic definition of natural number now becomes predicative when the [property] P in it is specified to range only over properties of a given order; in [this] case the property of being a natural number is of the next higher order\".Slight punctuation changes added for clarity, Kleene 1952:44 But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which [see Kleene's example at Impredicativity] contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his axiom of reducibility.Kleene 1952:44 But, Kleene wonders, \"on what grounds should we believe in the axiom of reducibility?\"Kleene 1952:45 He observes that, whereas Principia Mathematica is presented as derived from intuitively-derived axioms that \"were intended to be believed about the world, or at least to be accepted as plausible hypotheses concerning the world[,] ... if properties are to be constructed, the matter should be settled on the basis of constructions, not by an axiom.\" Indeed, he quotes Whitehead and Russell (1927) questioning their own axiom: \"clearly it is not the sort of axiom with which we can rest content\".Kleene 1952:45, quoting from Whitehead and Russell's introduction to their 1927 2nd edition of Principia Mathematica.\n\nKleene references work of Ramsey 1926 but notes that \"neither Whitehead and Russell nor Ramsey succeeded in attaining the logicistic goal constructively\" and \"an interesting proposal ... by Langford 1927 and Carnap 1931-2, is also not free of difficulties.\"both quotes from Kleene 1952:45 Kleene ends this discussion with quotes from Weyl (1946) that \"the system of Principia Mathematica ... [is founded on] a sort of logician's paradise\" and anyone \"who is ready to believe in this 'transcendental world' could also accept the system of axiomatic set theory (Zermelo, Fraenkel, etc), which, for the deduction of mathematics, has the advantage of being simpler in structure.\"Kleene 1952:45\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n van Heijenoort, Jean (1967, 3rd printing 1976), From Frege to Godel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879\u20131931, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA,  (pbk)\n Russell, Bertrand (1903) The Principles of Mathematics: Vol. 1, Cambridge at the University Press, Cambridge, UK, republished as a googlebook.\n Whitehead, Alfred North and Russell, Bertrand (1910\u20131913, 2nd edition 1927, reprinted 1962 edition), Principia Mathematica to *56, Cambridge at the University Press, London UK, no ISBN or US card catalogue number.\n Mario Livio (2009), Is God a Mathematician?'', Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, .\n\n External links \n\nCategory:Bertrand Russell\nCategory:Type theory\nCategory:Concepts in logic"}

A vector is an exterior normal at a point of the closed set if there is a real-valued continuously differentiable function maximized locally at the point with that vector as its derivative at the point. If the closed subset is a smooth submanifold with boundary, the condition states that the vector field should not point outside the subset at boundary points. The generalization to non-smooth subsets is important in the theory of partial differential equations.\n\nThe theorem had in fact been previously discovered by Mitio Nagumo in 1942 and is also known as the Nagumo theorem.\n\nStatement\nLet F be closed subset of a C2 manifold M and let X be a vector field on M which is Lipschitz continuous.

{"title": "Constructive set theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_set_theory", "text": "Constructive set theory is an approach to mathematical constructivism following the program of axiomatic set theory. That is, it uses the usual first-order language of classical set theory, and although of course the logic is constructive, there is no explicit use of constructive types. Rather, there are just sets, thus it can look very much like classical mathematics done on the most common foundations, namely the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms (ZFC).\n\n Intuitionistic Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel \nIn 1973, John Myhill proposed a system of set theory based on intuitionistic logicMyhill,  \"Some properties of Intuitionistic Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory\", Proceedings of the 1971 Cambridge Summer School in Mathematical Logic (Lecture Notes in Mathematics 337) (1973) pp 206-231 taking the most common foundation, ZFC, and throwing away the axiom of choice (AC) and the law of the excluded middle (LEM), leaving everything else as is. However, different forms of some of the ZFC axioms which are equivalent in the classical setting are inequivalent in the constructive setting, and some forms imply LEM.\n\nThe system, which has come to be known as IZF, or Intuitionistic Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel (ZF refers to ZFC without the axiom of choice), has the usual axioms of extensionality, pairing, union, infinity, separation and power set. The axiom of regularity is stated in the form of an axiom schema of set induction. Also, while Myhill used the axiom schema of replacement in his system,  IZF usually stands for the version with  collection.\n\nWhile the axiom of replacement requires the relation \u03c6 to be a function over the set A (that is, for every x in A there is associated exactly one y), the axiom of collection does not: it merely requires there be associated at least one y, and it asserts the existence of a set which collects at least one such y for each such x. The axiom of regularity as it is normally stated implies LEM, whereas the form of set induction does not. The formal statements of these two schemata are:\n\nAdding LEM back to IZF results in ZF, as LEM makes collection equivalent to replacement and set induction equivalent to regularity. Even without LEM, IZF's proof-theoretical power equals that of ZF.\n\n Predicativity \nWhile IZF is based on intuitionistic rather than classical logic, it is considered impredicative. It allows formation of sets using the axiom of separation with any proposition, including ones which contain quantifiers which are not bounded. Thus new sets can be formed in terms of the universe of all sets. Additionally the power set axiom implies the existence of a set of truth values. In the presence of LEM, this set exists and has two elements. In the absence of it, the set of truth values is also considered impredicative.\n\n Myhill's constructive set theory \nThe subject was begun by John Myhill to provide a formal foundation for Errett Bishop's program of constructive mathematics. As he presented it, Myhill's system CST is a constructive first-order logic with three sorts: natural numbers, functions, and sets. The system is:\n\n Constructive first-order predicate logic with identity, and basic axioms related to the three sorts.\n The usual Peano axioms for natural numbers.\n The usual axiom of extensionality for sets, as well as one for functions, and the usual axiom of union.\n A form of the axiom of infinity asserting that the collection of natural numbers (for which he introduces a constant N) is in fact a set.\n Axioms asserting that the domain and range of a function are both sets. Additionally, an axiom of non-choice asserts the existence of a choice function in cases where the choice is already made. Together these act like the usual replacement axiom in classical set theory.\n The axiom of exponentiation, asserting that for any two sets, there is a third set which contains all (and only) the functions whose domain is the first set, and whose range is the second set. This is a greatly weakened form of the axiom of power set in classical set theory, to which Myhill, among others, objected on the grounds of its impredicativity.\n The axiom of restricted, or predicative, separation, which is a weakened form of the separation axiom in classical set theory, requiring that any quantifications be bounded to another set.\n An axiom of dependent choice, which is much weaker than the usual axiom of choice.\n\n Aczel's constructive Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel \nPeter Aczel's constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel,Peter Aczel and Michael Rathjen, Notes on Constructive Set Theory, Reports Institut Mittag-Leffler, Mathematical Logic - 2000/2001, No. 40 or CZF, is essentially IZF with its impredicative features removed. It strengthens the collection scheme, and then drops the impredicative power set axiom and replaces it with another collection scheme. Finally the separation axiom is restricted, as in Myhill's CST. This theory has a relatively simple interpretation in a version of constructive type theory and has modest proof theoretic strength as well as a fairly direct constructive and predicative justification, while retaining the language of set theory. Adding LEM to this theory also recovers full ZF.\n\nThe collection axioms are:\n\nStrong collection schema: This is the constructive replacement for the axiom schema of replacement. It states that if \u03c6 is a binary relation between sets which is total over a certain domain set (that is, it has at least one image of every element in the domain), then there exists a set which contains at least one image under \u03c6 of every element of the domain, and only images of elements of the domain. Formally, for any formula \u03c6:\n\nSubset collection schema: This is the constructive version of the power set axiom. Formally, for any formula \u03c6:\n\nThis is equivalent to a single and somewhat clearer axiom of fullness: between any two sets a and b, there is a set c which contains a total subrelation of any  total relation from a to b that can be encoded as a set of ordered pairs. Formally, using a class that is syntactic sugar, we can define this:\n\nwhere  is the class of relations between a and b, formally the usual subset relation is defined  and a typical set encoding of the ordered pair <x,y> is assumed.\n\nThe axiom of fullness implies CST's axiom of exponentiation: given two sets, the collection of all total functions from one to the other is also in fact a set.\n\nThe remaining axioms of CZF are: the axioms of extensionality, pairing, union, and infinity are the same as in ZF; and set induction and predicative separation are the same as above.\n\n Interpretability in type theory \n\nIn 1977 Aczel showed that CZF can be interpreted in Martin-L\u00f6f type theory,Aczel, Peter: 1978.

{"title": "Decidability (logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decidability_%28logic%29", "text": "In logic, a true/false decision problem is decidable if there exists an effective method for deriving the correct answer. Logical systems such as propositional logic are decidable if membership in their set of logically valid formulas (or theorems) can be effectively determined. A theory (set of sentences closed under logical consequence) in a fixed logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are included in the theory. Many important problems are undecidable, that is, it has been proven that no effective method for determining membership (returning a correct answer after finite, though possibly very long, time in all cases) can exist for them.\n\nDecidability of a logical system\n\nEach logical system comes with both a syntactic component, which among other things determines the notion of provability, and a semantic component, which determines the notion of logical validity. The logically valid formulas of a system are sometimes called the theorems of the system, especially in the context of first-order logic where G\u00f6del's completeness theorem establishes the equivalence of semantic and syntactic consequence. In other settings, such as linear logic, the syntactic consequence (provability) relation may be used to define the theorems of a system.\n\nA logical system is decidable if there is an effective method for determining whether arbitrary formulas are theorems of the logical system. For example, propositional logic is decidable, because the truth-table method can be used to determine whether an arbitrary propositional formula is logically valid.\n\nFirst-order logic is not decidable in general; in particular, the set of logical validities in any signature that includes equality and at least one other predicate with two or more arguments is not decidable.Trakhtenbrot, 1953 Logical systems extending first-order logic, such as second-order logic and type theory, are also undecidable.\n\nThe validities of monadic predicate calculus with identity are decidable, however. This system is first-order logic restricted to signatures that have no function symbols and whose relation symbols other than equality never take more than one argument.\n\nSome logical systems are not adequately represented by the set of theorems alone. (For example, Kleene's logic has no theorems at all.) In such cases, alternative definitions of decidability of a logical system are often used, which ask for an effective method for determining something more general than just validity of formulas; for instance, validity of sequents, or the consequence relation {(\u0413, A) | \u0413 \u22a7 A} of the logic.\n\nDecidability of a theory\n\nA theory is a set of formulas, often assumed to be closed under logical consequence. Decidability for a theory concerns whether there is an effective procedure that decides whether the formula is a member of the theory or not, given an arbitrary formula in the signature of the theory. The problem of decidability arises naturally when a theory is defined as the set of logical consequences of a fixed set of axioms.\n\nThere are several basic results about decidability of theories. Every inconsistent theory is decidable, as every formula in the signature of the theory will be a logical consequence of, and thus a member of, the theory. Every complete recursively enumerable first-order theory is decidable. An extension of a decidable theory may not be decidable. For example, there are undecidable theories in propositional logic, although the set of validities (the smallest theory) is decidable. \n\nA consistent theory that has the property that every consistent extension is undecidable is said to be essentially undecidable. In fact, every consistent extension will be essentially undecidable. The theory of fields is undecidable but not essentially undecidable. Robinson arithmetic is known to be essentially undecidable, and thus every consistent theory that includes or interprets Robinson arithmetic is also (essentially) undecidable.\n\nExamples of decidable first-order theories include the theory of real closed fields, and Presburger arithmetic, while the theory of groups and Robinson arithmetic are examples of undecidable theories.\n\nSome decidable theories\n\nSome decidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.\u00a0234):\n The set of first-order logical validities in the signature with only equality, established by Leopold L\u00f6wenheim in 1915.\n The  set of first-order logical validities in a signature with equality and one unary function, established by Ehrenfeucht in 1959.\n The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and addition, also called Presburger arithmetic. The completeness was established by Moj\u017cesz Presburger in 1929.\n The first-order theory of the natural numbers in the signature with equality and multiplication, also called Skolem arithmetic.\n The first-order theory of Boolean algebras, established by Alfred Tarski in 1940 (found in 1940 but published in 1949).\n The first-order theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic, established by Tarski in 1949.\n The first-order theory of real-closed ordered fields, established by Tarski in 1949 (see also Tarski's exponential function problem).\n The first-order theory of Euclidean geometry, established by Tarski in 1949.\n The first-order theory of Abelian groups, established by Szmielew in 1955.\n The first-order theory of hyperbolic geometry, established by Schwabh\u00e4user in 1959.\n Specific decidable sublanguages of set theory investigated in the 1980s through today.(Cantone et al., 2001)\n\nMethods used to establish decidability include quantifier elimination, model completeness, and Vaught's test.\n\nSome undecidable theories\nSome undecidable theories include (Monk 1976, p.\u00a0279):\n\n The set of logical validities in any first-order signature with equality and either: a relation symbol of arity no less than 2, or two unary function symbols, or one function symbol of arity no less than 2, established by Trakhtenbrot in 1953.\n The first-order theory of the natural numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Tarski and Andrzej Mostowski in 1949.\n The first-order theory of the rational numbers with addition, multiplication, and equality, established by Julia Robinson in 1949.\n The first-order theory of groups, established by Alfred Tarski in 1953.  Remarkably, not only the general theory of groups is undecidable, but also several more specific theories, for example (as established by Mal'cev 1961)  the theory of finite groups. Mal'cev also established that the theory of semigroups and the theory of rings are undecidable. Robinson established in 1949 that the theory of fields is undecidable.\nRobinson arithmetic (and therefore any consistent extension, such as Peano arithmetic) is essentially undecidable, as established by Raphael Robinson in 1950.\n The first-order theory with equality and two function symbols\n\nThe interpretability method is often used to establish undecidability of theories. If an essentially undecidable theory T is interpretable in a consistent theory S, then S is also essentially undecidable. This is closely related to the concept of a many-one reduction in computability theory.\n\nSemidecidability\n\nA property of a theory or logical system weaker than decidability is semidecidability.  A theory is semidecidable if there is an effective method which, given an arbitrary formula, will always tell correctly when the formula is in the theory, but may give either a negative answer or no answer at all when the formula is not in the theory. A logical system is semidecidable if there is an effective method for generating theorems (and only theorems) such that every theorem will eventually be generated. This is different from decidability because in a semidecidable system there may be no effective procedure for checking that a formula is not a theorem.\n\nEvery decidable theory or logical system is semidecidable, but in general the converse is not true; a theory is decidable if and only if both it and its complement are semi-decidable. For example, the  set of logical validities V of first-order logic is semi-decidable, but not decidable. In this case, it is because there is no effective method for determining for an arbitrary formula A whether A is not in V. Similarly, the set of logical consequences of any recursively enumerable set of first-order axioms is semidecidable. Many of the examples of undecidable first-order theories given above are of this form.\n\n Relationship with completeness \n\nDecidability should not be confused with completeness. For example, the theory of algebraically closed fields is decidable but incomplete, whereas the set of all true first-order statements about nonnegative integers in the language with + and \u00d7 is complete but undecidable. \nUnfortunately, as a terminological ambiguity, the term \"undecidable statement\" is sometimes used as a synonym for independent statement.\n\n Relationship to computability \n\nAs with the concept of a decidable set, the definition of a decidable theory or logical system can be given either in terms of effective methods or in terms of computable functions. These are generally considered equivalent per Church's thesis. Indeed, the proof that a logical system or theory is undecidable will use the formal definition of computability to show that an appropriate set is not a decidable set, and then invoke Church's thesis to show that the theory or logical system is not decidable by any effective method (Enderton 2001, pp.\u00a0206ff.).\n\nIn context of games\nSome games have been classified as to their decidability:\n Chess is decidable.http://cs.stackexchange.com/Computer Science. \"Is chess game movement TM decidable?\" Is chess game movement TM decidable?https://www.redhotpawn.com/Undecidable chess problem?

{"title": "Dynamic logic (modal logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_logic_%28modal_logic%29", "text": "  \nDynamic logic is an extension of modal logic originally intended for reasoning about computer programs and later applied to more general complex behaviors arising in linguistics, philosophy, AI, and other fields.\n\nLanguage\n\nModal logic is characterized by the modal operators  (box p) asserting that  is necessarily the case, and  (diamond p) asserting that  is possibly the case. Dynamic logic extends this by associating to every action  the modal operators  and , thereby making it a multimodal logic.  The meaning of  is that after performing action  it is necessarily the case that  holds, that is,  must bring about .  The meaning of  is that after performing  it is possible that  holds, that is,  might bring about .  These operators are related by  and , analogously to the relationship between the universal () and existential () quantifiers.\n\nDynamic logic permits compound actions built up from smaller actions. While the basic control operators of any programming language could be used for this purpose, Kleene's regular expression operators are a good match to modal logic. Given actions  and , the compound action , choice, also written  or , is performed by performing one of  or .  The compound action , sequence, is performed by performing first  and then . The compound action , iteration, is performed by performing  zero or more times, sequentially. The constant action  or BLOCK does nothing and does not terminate, whereas the constant action  or SKIP or NOP, definable as , does nothing but does terminate.\n\nAxioms\n\nThese operators can be axiomatized in dynamic logic as follows, taking as already given a suitable axiomatization of modal logic including such axioms for modal operators as the above-mentioned axiom  and the two inference rules modus ponens ( and  implies ) and necessitation ( implies ).\n\nA1.  \n\nA2.  \n\nA3.  \n\nA4.  \n\nA5.  \n\nA6.  \n\nAxiom A1 makes the empty promise that when BLOCK terminates,  will hold, even if  is the proposition false.  (Thus BLOCK abstracts the essence of the action of hell freezing over.)\nA2 says that NOP acts as the identity function on propositions, that is, it transforms  into itself.\nA3 says that if doing one of  or  must bring about , then  must bring about  and likewise for , and conversely.\nA4 says that if doing  and then  must bring about , then  must bring about a situation in which  must bring about .\nA5 is the evident result of applying A2, A3 and A4 to the equation  of Kleene algebra.\nA6 asserts that if  holds now, and no matter how often we perform  it remains the case that the truth of  after that performance entails its truth after one more performance of , then  must remain true no matter how often we perform . A6 is recognizable as mathematical induction with the action n := n+1 of incrementing n generalized to arbitrary actions .\n\nDerivations\n\nThe modal logic axiom  permits the derivation of the following six theorems corresponding to the above:\n\nT1.  \n\nT2.  \n\nT3.  \n\nT4.  \n\nT5.  \n\nT6.  \n\nT1 asserts the impossibility of bringing anything about by performing BLOCK.\nT2 notes again that NOP changes nothing, bearing in mind that NOP is both deterministic and terminating whence  and  have the same force.\nT3 says that if the choice of  or  could bring about , then either  or  alone could bring about .\nT4 is just like A4.\nT5 is explained as for A5.\nT6 asserts that if it is possible to bring about  by performing  sufficiently often, then either  is true now or it is possible to perform  repeatedly to bring about a situation where  is (still) false but one more performance of  could bring about .\n\nBox and diamond are entirely symmetric with regard to which one takes as primitive. An alternative axiomatization would have been to take the theorems T1-T6 as axioms, from which we could then have derived A1-A6 as theorems.\n\nThe difference between implication and inference is the same in dynamic logic as in any other logic: whereas the implication  asserts that if  is true then so is , the inference  asserts that if  is valid then so is . However the dynamic nature of dynamic logic moves this distinction out of the realm of abstract axiomatics into the common-sense experience of situations in flux. The inference rule , for example, is sound because its premise asserts that  holds at all times, whence no matter where  might take us,  will be true there. The implication  is not valid, however, because the truth of  at the present moment is no guarantee of its truth after performing . For example,  will be true in any situation where  is false, or in any situation where  is true, but the assertion  is false in any situation where  has value 1, and therefore is not valid.\n\nDerived rules of inference\n\nAs for modal logic, the inference rules modus ponens and necessitation suffice also for dynamic logic as the only primitive rules it needs, as noted above. However, as usual in logic, many more rules can be derived from these with the help of the axioms. An example instance of such a derived rule in dynamic logic is that if kicking a broken TV once can't possibly fix it, then repeatedly kicking it can't possibly fix it either. Writing  for the action of kicking the TV, and  for the proposition that the TV is broken, dynamic logic expresses this inference as , having as premise  and as conclusion . The meaning of  is that it is guaranteed that after kicking the TV, it is broken. Hence the premise  means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it once it will still be broken.  denotes the action of kicking the TV zero or more times. Hence the conclusion  means that if the TV is broken, then after kicking it zero or more times it will still be broken. For if not, then after the second-to-last kick the TV would be in a state where kicking it once more would fix it, which the premise claims can never happen under any circumstances.\n\nThe inference  is sound. However the implication  is not valid because we can easily find situations in which  holds but  does not. In any such counterexample situation,  must hold but  must be false, while  however must be true. But this could happen in any situation where the TV is broken but can be revived with two kicks. The implication fails (is not valid) because it only requires that  hold now, whereas the inference succeeds (is sound) because it requires that  hold in all situations, not just the present one.\n\nAn example of a valid implication is the proposition . This says that if  is greater or equal to 3, then after incrementing ,  must be greater or equal to 4. In the case of deterministic actions  that are guaranteed to terminate, such as , must and might have the same force, that is,  and  have the same meaning. Hence the above proposition is equivalent to  asserting that if  is greater or equal to 3 then after performing ,  might be greater or equal to 4.\n\nAssignment\n\nThe general form of an assignment statement is  where  is a variable and  is an expression built from constants and variables with whatever operations are provided by the language, such as addition and multiplication. The Hoare axiom for assignment is not given as a single axiom but rather as an axiom schema.\n\nA7.  \n\nThis is a schema in the sense that  can be instantiated with any formula  containing zero or more instances of a variable . The meaning of  is  with those occurrences of  that occur free in , i.e. not bound by some quantifier as in , replaced by . For example, we may instantiate A7 with , or with . Such an axiom schema allows infinitely many axioms having a common form to be written as a finite expression connoting that form.\n\nThe instance  of A7 allows us to calculate mechanically that the example  encountered a few paragraphs ago is equivalent to , which in turn is equivalent to  by elementary algebra.\n\nAn example illustrating assignment in combination with  is the proposition . This asserts that it is possible, by incrementing  sufficiently often, to make  equal to 7. This of course is not always true, e.g. if  is 8 to begin with, or 6.5, whence this proposition is not a theorem of dynamic logic. If  is of type integer however, then this proposition is true if and only if  is at most 7 to begin with, that is, it is just a roundabout way of saying .\n\nMathematical induction can be obtained as the instance of A6 in which the proposition  is instantiated as , the action  as , and  as . The first two of these three instantiations are straightforward, converting A6 to . However, the ostensibly simple substitution of  for  is not so simple as it brings out the so-called referential opacity of modal logic in the case when a modality can interfere with a substitution.\n\nWhen we substituted  for , we were thinking of the proposition symbol  as a rigid designator with respect to the modality , meaning that it is the same proposition after incrementing  as before, even though incrementing  may impact its truth. Likewise, the action  is still the same action after incrementing , even though incrementing  will result in its executing in a different environment. However,  itself is not a rigid designator with respect to the modality ; if it denotes 3 before incrementing , it denotes 4 after. So we can't just substitute  for  everywhere in A6.\n\nOne way of dealing with the opacity of modalities is to eliminate them.  To this end, expand  as the infinite conjunction , that is, the conjunction over all  of . Now apply A4 to turn  into , having  modalities. Then apply Hoare's axiom  times to this to produce , then simplify this infinite conjunction to . This whole reduction should be applied to both instances of  in A6, yielding . The remaining modality can now be eliminated with one more use of Hoare's axiom to give .\n\nWith the opaque modalities now out of the way, we can safely substitute  for  in the usual manner of first-order logic to obtain Peano's celebrated axiom , namely mathematical induction.\n\nOne subtlety we glossed over here is that  should be understood as ranging over the natural numbers, where  is the superscript in the expansion of  as the union of  over all natural numbers . The importance of keeping this typing information straight becomes apparent if  had been of type integer, or even real, for any of which A6 is perfectly valid as an axiom. As a case in point, if  is a real variable and  is the predicate  is a natural number, then axiom A6 after the first two substitutions, that is, , is just as valid, that is, true in every state regardless of the value of  in that state, as when  is of type natural number. If in a given state  is a natural number, then the antecedent of the main implication of A6 holds, but then  is also a natural number so the consequent also holds. If  is not a natural number, then the antecedent is false and so A6 remains true regardless of the truth of the consequent. We could strengthen A6 to an equivalence  without impacting any of this, the other direction being provable from A5, from which we see that if the antecedent of A6 does happen to be false somewhere, then the consequent must be false.\n\nTest\n\nDynamic logic associates to every proposition  an action  called a test. When  holds, the test  acts as a NOP, changing nothing while allowing the action to move on.  When  is false,  acts as BLOCK. Tests can be axiomatized as follows.\n\nA8.  \n\nThe corresponding theorem for  is:\n\nT8.  \n\nThe construct if p then a else b is realized in dynamic logic as . This action expresses a guarded choice: if  holds then  is equivalent to , whereas  is equivalent to BLOCK, and  is equivalent to . Hence when  is true the performer of the action can only take the left branch, and when  is false the right.\n\nThe construct while p do a is realized as . This performs  zero or more times and then performs . As long as  remains true, the  at the end blocks the performer from terminating the iteration prematurely, but as soon as it becomes false, further iterations of the body  are blocked and the performer then has no choice but to exit via the test .\n\nQuantification as random assignment\n\nThe random-assignment statement  denotes the nondeterministic action of setting  to an arbitrary value.  then says that  holds no matter what you set  to, while  says that it is possible to set  to a value that makes  true.  thus has the same meaning as the universal quantifier , while  similarly corresponds to the existential quantifier . That is, first-order logic can be understood as the dynamic logic of programs of the form .\n\nDijkstra claimed to show the impossibility of a program that sets the value of variable x to an arbitrary positive integer. However, in dynamic logic with assignment and the * operator, x can be set to an arbitrary positive integer with the dynamic logic program : hence we must either reject Dijkstra's argument or hold that the * operator is not effective.\n\nPossible-world semantics\n\nModal logic is most commonly interpreted in terms of possible world semantics or Kripke structures.  This semantics carries over naturally to dynamic logic by interpreting worlds as states of a computer in the application to program verification, or states of our environment in applications to linguistics, AI, etc.  One role for possible world semantics is to formalize the intuitive notions of truth and validity, which in turn permit the notions of soundness and completeness to be defined for axiom systems.  An inference rule is sound when validity of its premises implies validity of its conclusion.  An axiom system is sound when all its axioms are valid and its inference rules are sound.  An axiom system is complete when every valid formula is derivable as a theorem of that system.  These concepts apply to all systems of logic including dynamic logic.\n\nPropositional dynamic logic (PDL)\n\nOrdinary or first-order logic has two types of terms, respectively assertions and data. As can be seen from the examples above, dynamic logic adds a third type of term denoting actions. The dynamic logic assertion  contains all three types: , , and  are data,  is an action, and  and  are assertions. Propositional logic is derived from first-order logic by omitting data terms and reasons only about abstract propositions, which may be simple propositional variables or atoms or compound propositions built with such logical connectives as and, or, and not.\n\nPropositional dynamic logic, or PDL, was derived from dynamic logic in 1977 by Michael J. Fischer and Richard Ladner. PDL blends the ideas behind propositional logic and dynamic logic by adding actions while omitting data; hence the terms of PDL are actions and propositions. The TV example above is expressed in PDL whereas the next example involving  is in first-order DL. PDL is to (first-order) dynamic logic as propositional logic is to first-order logic.\n\nFischer and Ladner showed in their 1977 paper that PDL satisfiability was of computational complexity at most nondeterministic exponential time, and at least deterministic exponential time in the worst case. This gap was closed in 1978 by Vaughan Pratt who showed that PDL was decidable in deterministic exponential time. In 1977, Krister Segerberg proposed a complete axiomatization of PDL, namely any complete axiomatization of modal logic K together with axioms A1-A6 as given above. Completeness proofs for Segerberg's axioms were found by Gabbay (unpublished note), Parikh (1978), Pratt (1979), and Kozen and Parikh (1981).\n\nHistory\n\nDynamic logic was developed by Vaughan Pratt in 1974 in notes for a class on program verification as an approach to assigning meaning to Hoare logic by expressing the Hoare formula  as . The approach was later published in 1976 as a logical system in its own right. The system parallels \nAndrzej Salwicki's system of algorithmic logic  and Edsger Dijkstra's notion of weakest-precondition predicate transformer , with  corresponding to Dijkstra's , weakest liberal precondition. Those logics however made no connection with either modal logic, Kripke semantics, regular expressions, or the calculus of binary relations; dynamic logic therefore can be viewed as a refinement of algorithmic logic and predicate transformers that connects them up to the axiomatics and Kripke semantics of modal logic as well as to the calculi of binary relations and regular expressions.\n\nThe concurrency challenge\n\nHoare logic, algorithmic logic, weakest preconditions, and dynamic logic are all well suited to discourse and reasoning about sequential behavior.  Extending these logics to concurrent behavior however has proved problematic.  There are various approaches but all of them lack the elegance of the sequential case.  In contrast Amir Pnueli's 1977 system of temporal logic, another variant of modal logic sharing many common features with dynamic logic, differs from all of the above-mentioned logics by being what Pnueli has characterized as an \"endogenous\" logic, the others being \"exogenous\" logics.  By this Pnueli meant that temporal logic assertions are interpreted within a universal behavioral framework in which a single global situation changes with the passage of time, whereas the assertions of the other logics are made externally  to the multiple actions about which they speak.  The advantage of the endogenous approach is that it makes no fundamental assumptions about what causes what as the environment changes with time.  Instead a temporal logic formula can talk about two unrelated parts of a system, which because they are unrelated tacitly evolve in parallel.  In effect ordinary logical conjunction of temporal assertions is the concurrent composition operator of temporal logic.  The simplicity of this approach to concurrency has resulted in temporal logic being the modal logic of choice for reasoning about concurrent systems with its aspects of synchronization, interference, independence, deadlock, livelock, fairness, etc.\n\nThese concerns of concurrency would appear to be less central to linguistics, philosophy, and artificial intelligence, the areas in which dynamic logic is most often encountered nowadays.\n\nFor a comprehensive treatment of dynamic logic see the book by David Harel et al. cited below.\n\n See also \n\n Temporal logic\n Temporal logic in finite-state verification\n Temporal logic of actions\n Modal \u03bc-calculus\n\n Footnotes \n\nReferences\n Vaughan Pratt, \"Semantical Considerations on Floyd-Hoare Logic\", Proc. 17th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 1976, 109-121.\n David Harel, Dexter Kozen, and Jerzy Tiuryn, \"Dynamic Logic\".

He was known for his work on mathematical physics and mathematical logic.  In mathematical logic, he was noted especially for his internal set theory, and views on ultrafinitism and the consistency of arithmetic. In philosophy of mathematics he advocated the view of formalism rather than platonism or intuitionism. He also wrote on the relationship between religion and mathematics.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Decatur, Georgia, in 1932, Nelson lived in Italy as a child under the dictatorship of Mussolini. Nelson moved with his mother to New York City before World War II while his father, who spoke fluent Russian, stayed in St. Petersburg in connection with issues related to prisoners of war. After the war he returned to Italy for high school.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. in 1955 from the University of Chicago, where he worked with Irving Segal. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study from 1956 to 1959.  He held a position at Princeton University starting in 1959, attaining the rank of professor there in 1964 and retiring in 2013.\n\nIn 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on September 10, 2014.\n\nAcademic work\nStochastic quantum mechanics\n\nNelson made contributions to the theory of infinite-dimensional group representations, the mathematical treatment of quantum field theory, the use of stochastic processes in quantum mechanics, and the reformulation of probability theory in terms of non-standard analysis. For many years he worked on mathematical physics and probability theory, and he retained a residual interest in these fields, particularly in connection with possible extensions of stochastic mechanics to field theory.\n\nFour color problem\n\nIn 1950, Nelson formulated a popular variant of the four color problem: What is the chromatic number, denoted , of the plane? In more detail, what is the smallest number of colors sufficient for coloring the points of the Euclidean plane such that no two points of the same color are unit distance apart? We know by simple arguments that 4\u00a0\u2264\u00a0\u03c7\u00a0\u2264\u00a07. The problem was introduced to a wide mathematical audience by Martin Gardner in his October 1960 Mathematical Games column. The chromatic number problem, also now known as the Hadwiger\u2013Nelson problem, was a favorite of Paul Erd\u0151s, who mentioned it frequently in his problems lectures.\n\nFoundations of mathematics\n\nIn the later part of his career, he worked on mathematical logic and the foundations of mathematics. One of his goals was to extend IST (Internal Set Theory\u2014a version of a portion of Abraham Robinson's non-standard analysis) in a natural manner that includes external functions and sets, in a way that provides an external function with specified properties unless there is a finitary obstacle to its existence. Other work centered on fragments of arithmetic, studying the divide between those theories interpretable in Raphael Robinson's Arithmetic and those that are not; computational complexity, including the problem of whether P is equal to NP or not; and automated proof checking.\n\nIn September 2011, Nelson announced that he had proved that Peano arithmetic was logically inconsistent. An error was found in the proof, and he retracted the claim.\n\nPublications\nSelected papers\n\n \n \n\nBooks\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nSee also\n\nHidden variable theory\nInfluence of non-standard analysis\nStochastic process\nStochastic quantum mechanics\nStochastic electrodynamics\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nExternal links\n\n Curriculum Vitae \u2013 Edward Nelson\n Mathematics and Faith \u2013 Edward Nelson\n Edward Nelson's Homepage\n Mathematics and Religion Discussion\n The Limitation of Mental and Physical Reality Discussion\n\nCategory:1932 births\nCategory:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences\nCategory:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society\nCategory:20th-century American mathematicians\nCategory:21st-century American mathematicians\nCategory:American logicians\nCategory:Set theorists\nCategory:University of Chicago alumni\nCategory:Princeton University faculty\nCategory:2014 deaths\nCategory:Mathematical physicists"}
{"title": "Elementary proof", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_proof", "text": "In mathematics, an elementary proof is a mathematical proof that only uses basic techniques. More specifically, the term is used in number theory to refer to proofs that make no use of complex analysis. For some time it was thought that certain theorems, like the prime number theorem, could only be proved using \"higher\" mathematics.  However, over time, many of these results have been reproven using only elementary techniques.\n\nWhile the meaning has not always been defined precisely, the term is commonly used in mathematical jargon. An elementary proof is not necessarily simple, in the sense of being easy to understand: some elementary proofs can be quite complicated..\n\nPrime number theorem\nThe distinction between elementary and non-elementary proofs has been considered especially important in regard to the prime number theorem. This theorem was first proved in 1896 by Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin using complex analysis. Many mathematicians then attempted to construct elementary proofs of the theorem, without success. G. H. Hardy expressed strong reservations; he considered that the essential \"depth\" of the result ruled out elementary proofs:\n\nHowever, in 1948, Atle Selberg produced new methods which led him and Paul Erd\u0151s to find elementary proofs of the prime number theorem. \n\nA possible formalization of the notion of \"elementary\" in connection to a proof of a number-theoretical result is the restriction that the proof can be carried out in Peano arithmetic. Also in that sense, these proofs are elementary.\n\nFriedman's conjecture\n\nHarvey Friedman conjectured, \"Every theorem published in the Annals of Mathematics whose statement involves only finitary mathematical objects (i.e., what logicians call an arithmetical statement) can be proved in elementary arithmetic.\". The form of elementary arithmetic referred to in this conjecture can be formalized by a small set of axioms concerning integer arithmetic and mathematical induction. For instance, according to this conjecture, Fermat's Last Theorem should have an elementary proof; Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is not elementary. However, there are other simple statements about arithmetic such as the existence of iterated exponential functions that cannot be proven in this theory.\n\nReferences\n\nCategory:Elementary mathematics\nCategory:Mathematical proofs"}

He is a major figure in the history of mathematical logic (a term he may have invented), by virtue of summarizing and extending the work of George Boole, Augustus De Morgan, Hugh MacColl, and especially Charles Peirce. He is best known for his monumental Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik (Lectures on the algebra of logic), in three volumes, which prepared the way for the emergence of mathematical logic as a separate discipline in the twentieth century by systematizing the various systems of formal logic of the day.\n\nLife\nSchr\u00f6der learned mathematics at Heidelberg, K\u00f6nigsberg, and Z\u00fcrich, under Otto Hesse, Gustav Kirchhoff, and Franz Neumann. After teaching school for a few years, he moved to the Technische Hochschule Darmstadt in 1874. Two years later, he took up a chair in mathematics at the Polytechnische Schule in Karlsruhe, where he spent the remainder of his life. He never married.\n\n Work \nSchr\u00f6der's early work on formal algebra and logic was written in ignorance of the British logicians George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. Instead, his sources were texts by Ohm, Hankel, Hermann Grassmann, and Robert Grassmann (Peckhaus 1997: 233\u2013296). In 1873, Schr\u00f6der learned of Boole's and De Morgan's work on logic. To their work he subsequently added several important concepts due to Charles Sanders Peirce, including subsumption and quantification.\n\nSchr\u00f6der also made original contributions to algebra, set theory, lattice theory, ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Along with Georg Cantor, he codiscovered the Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schr\u00f6der theorem, although  Schr\u00f6der's proof (1898) is flawed. Felix Bernstein (1878\u20131956) subsequently corrected the proof as part of his Ph.D. dissertation.\n\nthumb|right|title page of first printing of \"\u00dcber die formalen Elemente der absoluten Algebra\" (on the formal elements of the absolute algebra)\n\nSchr\u00f6der (1877) was a concise exposition of Boole's ideas on algebra and logic, which did much to introduce Boole's work to continental readers. The influence of the Grassmanns, especially Robert's little-known Formenlehre, is clear. Unlike Boole, Schr\u00f6der fully appreciated duality. John Venn and Christine Ladd-Franklin both warmly cited this short book of Schr\u00f6der's, and Charles Sanders Peirce used it as a text while teaching at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSchr\u00f6der's masterwork, his Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Algebra der Logik, was published in three volumes between 1890 and 1905, at the author's expense. Vol. 2 is in two parts, the second published posthumously, edited by Eugen M\u00fcller. The Vorlesungen was a comprehensive and scholarly survey of \"algebraic\" (today we would say \"symbolic\") logic up to the end of the 19th century, one that had a considerable influence on the emergence of mathematical logic in the 20th century. The Vorlesungen is a prolix affair, only a small part of which has been translated into English. That part, along with an extended discussion of the entire Vorlesungen, is in Brady (2000). Also see Grattan-Guinness (2000: 159\u201376).\n\nSchr\u00f6der said his aim was:\n\nInfluence\n\nSchr\u00f6der's influence on the early development of the predicate calculus, mainly by popularising C.\u00a0S.

For an example of  the influence of Schr\u00f6der's work on English-speaking logicians of the early 20th century, see Clarence Irving Lewis (1918). The relational concepts that pervade Principia Mathematica are very much owed to the Vorlesungen, cited in Principias Preface and in Bertrand Russell's Principles of Mathematics.\n\nFrege (1960) dismissed Schr\u00f6der's work, and admiration  for Frege's pioneering role has dominated subsequent historical discussion.

{"title": "Existential fallacy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_fallacy", "text": "The existential fallacy, or existential instantiation, is a formal fallacy.  In the existential fallacy, one presupposes that a class has members when one is not supposed to do so; i.e., when one should not assume existential import. Not to be confused with the Affirming the consequent, which states \"A causes B; B, therefore A\".\n\nOne example would be: \"Every unicorn definitely has a horn on its forehead\". It does not imply that there are any unicorns at all in the world, and thus it cannot be assumed that, if the statement were true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on its forehead). The statement, if assumed true, implies only that if there were any unicorns, each would definitely have a horn on its forehead.\n\nOverview\nAn existential fallacy is committed in a medieval categorical syllogism because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, an assumption which is not established by the premises.\n\nIn modern logic, the presupposition that a class has members is seen as unacceptable. In 1905, Bertrand Russell wrote an essay entitled \"The Existential Import of Proposition\", in which he called this Boolean approach \"Peano's interpretation\".\n\nThe fallacy does not occur in enthymemes, where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class.\n\nExamples\n All trespassers will be prosecuted.\n Therefore, some of those prosecuted will have trespassed.http://www.fallacyfiles.org/existent.html\n\nThis is a fallacy because the first statement does not require the existence of any actual trespassers (stating only what would happen in the event that some do exist), and therefore does not prove the existence of any. Note that this is a fallacy whether or not anyone has trespassed.\n\nSee also\nVacuous truth\nAffirming the consequent\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nFallacy files: existential fallacy\nFOLDOC: existential fallacy\n\nCategory:Syllogistic fallacies\nCategory:Quantificational fallacies"}

{"title": "Gisbert Hasenjaeger", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisbert_Hasenjaeger", "text": "Gisbert F. R. Hasenjaeger (June 1, 1919 \u2013 September 2, 2006) was a German mathematical logician. Independently and simultaneously with Leon Henkin in 1949, he developed a new proof of the completeness theorem of Kurt G\u00f6del for predicate logic. He worked as an assistant to Heinrich Scholz at Section IVa of Oberkommando der Wehrmacht Chiffrierabteilung, and was responsible for the security of the Enigma machine.\n\nPersonal life\nGisbert Hasenjaeger went to high school in M\u00fclheim, where his father  was a lawyer and local politician. After completing school in 1936, Gisbert volunteered for labor service. He was drafted for military service in World War II, and fought as an artillerist in the Russian campaign, where he was badly wounded in January 1942. After his recovery, in October 1942 Heinrich ScholzHasenjaeger knew Scholz since his school days and corresponded with him during his time as a conscript. got him an employment in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW/Chi), where he was the youngest member at 24. He attended a cryptography training course by Erich H\u00fcttenhain, and was put into the recently founded Section IVa \"Security check of own Encoding Procedures\" under Karl Stein, who assigned him the security check of the Enigma machine. Cited from German Wikipedia At the end of the war as OKW/Chi disintegrated, Hasenjaeger managed to escape TICOM, the United States effort to roundup and seize captured German intelligence people and material.\n\nFrom the end of 1945, he studied mathematics and especially mathematical logic with Heinrich Scholz at the Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t University in M\u00fcnster.  In 1950 received his doctorate Topological studies on the semantics and syntax of an extended predicate calculus and completed his habilitation in 1953.\n\nIn M\u00fcnster, he worked as an assistant to Scholz and later co-author, to write the textbook Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic in Springer's Grundlehren series (Yellow series of Springer-Verlag),  which he published in 1961 fully 6 years after Scholz's death. In 1962 he became professor at the University of Bonn, where he was Director of the newly created Department of Logic.\n\nIn 1962, Dr. Hasenjaeger left M\u00fcnster University to take a full professorship at Bonn University, where he was established Director of the newly established Department of Logic and Basic Research. In 1964/65 he spent a year at Princeton University at the Institute for Advanced Study His doctoral students at Bonn included Ronald B. Jensen, his most famous pupil.\n\nHe became professor emeritus in 1984.\n\nWork\n\nSafety Testing the Enigma Machine\nIn Oct 1942, after starting work at OKW/Chi, Hasenjaeger was trained in cryptology, given by the mathematician, Erich H\u00fcttenhain, who was widely considered the most important German cryptologist of his time.  Hasenjaeger was put into a newly formed department, whose principal responsibility was the defensive testing and security control of their own methods and devices. Hasenjaeger was ordered, by the mathematician Karl Stein who was also conscripted at OKW/Chi, to examine the Enigma machine for cryptologic weaknesses, while Stein was to examine the Siemens and Halske T52 and the Lorenz SZ-42. The Enigma machine that Hasenjaeger examined was a variation that worked with 3 rotors and had no plug board. Germany sold this version to neutral countries to accrue foreign exchange. Hasenjaeger was presented with a 100 character encrypted message for analysis and found a weakness which enabled the identification of the correct wiring rotors and also the appropriate rotor positions, to decrypt the messages. Further success eluded him however. He crucially failed to identify the most important weakness of the Enigma machine: the lack of fixed points (letters encrypting to themselves) due to the reflector. Hasenjaeger could take some comfort from the fact that even Alan Turing missed this weakness. Instead the honour was attributed to Gordon Welchman, who used the knowledge to decrypt several hundred thousand Enigma messages during the war. In fact fixed points were earlier used by Polish codebreaker, Henryk Zygalski, as the basis for his method of attack on Enigma cipher, referred to by the Poles as \"Zygalski sheets\" (Zygalski sheets) (p\u0142achty Zygalskiego) and by the British as the \"Netz method\".\n\nProof of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem\nIt was while Hasenjaeger was working at Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t University in M\u00fcnster in the period between 1946 and 1953 that Hasenjaeger made a most amazing discovery - a proof of Kurt G\u00f6del's G\u00f6del's completeness theorem for full predicate logic with identity and function symbols. G\u00f6del's proof of 1930 for predicate logic did not automatically establish a procedure for the general case. When he had solved the problem in late 1949, he was frustrated to find that a young American mathematician Leon Henkin, had also created a proof.  Both construct from extension of a term model, which is then the model for the initial theory. Although the Henkin proof was considered by Hasenjaeger and his peers to more flexible, Hasenjaeger' is considered simpler and more transparent.\n\nHasenjaeger continued to refine his proof through to 1953 when he made a breakthrough. According to the mathematicians Alfred Tarski, Stephen Cole Kleene and Andrzej Mostowski, the Arithmetical hierarchy of formulas is the set of arithmetical propositions that are true in the standard model, but not arithmetically definable. So, what does the concept of truth for the term model mean, the results for the recursively axiomatized Peano arithmetic from the Hasenjaeger method? The result was the truth predicate is well arithmetically, it is even .  So far down in the arithmetic hierarchy, and that goes for any recursively axiomatized (countable, consistent) theories. Even if you are true in all the natural numbers  formulas to the axioms.\n\nThis classic proof is a very early, original application of the arithmetic hierarchy theory to a general-logical problem. It appeared in 1953 in the Journal of Symbolic Logic. G\u00f6del proof.\n\nConstruction of Turing Machines\n\nIn 1963, Hasenjaeger built a Universal Turing machine out of old telephone relays. Although Hasenjaeger's work on UTMs was largely unknown and he never published any details of the machinery during his lifetime, his family decided to donate the machine to the Heinz Nixdorf Museum in Paderborn, Germany, after his death.In a academic paper presented at the International Conference of History and Philosophy of Computinghttp://www.computing-conference.ugent.be/ Rainer Glaschick, Turlough Neary, Damien Woods, Niall Murphy had examined Hasenjaeger's UTM machine at the request of Hasenjaeger family and found that the UTM was remarkably small and efficiently universal. Hasenjaeger UTM contained 3-tapes, 4 states, 2 symbols and was an evolution of ideas from Edward F. Moore's first universal machine and Hao Wang's B-machine. Hasenjaeger went on to build a small efficient Wang B-machine simulator. This was again proven by the team assembled by Rainer Glaschick to be efficiently universal.\n\nComments on the Enigma Machine weakness\nIt was only in the 1970s that Hasenjaeger learned that the Enigma Machine had been so comprehensively broken. It impressed him that Alan Turing himself, considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century, had worked on breaking the device. The fact that the Germans had so comprehensively underestimated the weaknesses of the device, in contrast to Turing and Welchmans work, was seen by Hasenjaeger today as entirely positive. Hasenjaeger stated:\n\nWould it not been so, then the war would have lasted probably longer and the first atomic bomb had not fallen on Japan, but on Germany.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Rebecca Ratcliffe: Searching for Security.

{"title": "Inductive type", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_type", "text": "In type theory, a system has inductive types if it has facilities for creating a new type along with constants and functions that create terms of that type.  The feature serves a role similar to data structures in a programming language and allows a type theory to add concepts like numbers, relations, and trees.  As the name suggests, inductive types can be self-referential, but usually only in a way that permits structural recursion.\n\nThe standard example is encoding the natural numbers using Peano's encoding.\n Inductive nat : Type :=\n   | 0 : nat\n   | S : nat -> nat.\nHere, a natural number is created either from the constant \"0\" or by applying the function \"S\" to another natural number.  \"S\" is the successor function which represents adding 1 to a number.  Thus, \"0\" is zero, \"S 0\" is one, \"S (S 0)\" is two, \"S (S (S 0))\" is three, and so on.\n\nSince their introduction, inductive types have been extended to encode more and more structures, while still being predicative and supporting structural recursion.\n\n Elimination \n\nInductive types usually come with a function to prove properties about them.  Thus, \"nat\" may come with:\n nat_elim : (forall P : nat -> Prop, (P 0) -> (forall n, P n -> P (S n)) -> (forall n, P n)).\nThis is the expected function for structural recursion for the type \"nat\".\n\n Implementations \n\n W- and M-types \n\nW-types are well-founded types in intuitionistic type theory (ITT). They generalize natural numbers, lists, binary trees, and other \"tree-shaped\" data types. Let  be a universe of types. Given a type  :  and a dependent family  :  \u2192 , one can form a W-type . The type  may be thought of as \"labels\" for the (potentially infinitely many) constructors of the inductive type being defined, whereas  indicates the (potentially infinite) arity of each constructor. W-types (resp. M-types) may also be understood as well-founded (resp. non-well-founded) trees with nodes labeled by elements  :  and where the node labeled by  has ()-many subtrees. Each W-type is isomorphic to the initial algebra of a so-called polynomial functor.\n\nLet 0, 1, 2, etc. be finite types with inhabitants 11 : 1, 12, 22:2, etc. One may define the natural numbers as the W-type\n\nwith  : 2 \u2192  is defined by (12) = 0 (representing the constructor for zero, which takes no arguments), and (22) = 1 (representing the successor function, which takes one argument).\n\nOne may define lists over a type  :  as  where\n\nand 11 is the sole inhabitant of 1. The value of  corresponds to the constructor for the empty list, whereas the value of  corresponds to the constructor that appends  to the beginning of another list.\n\nThe constructor for elements of a generic W-type  has type\n\nWe can also write this rule in the style of a natural deduction proof,\n\nThe elimination rule for W-types works similarly to structural induction on trees. If, whenever a property (under the propositions-as-types interpretation)  :  \u2192  holds for all subtrees of a given tree it also holds for that tree, then it holds for all trees.\n\nIn extensional type theories, W-types (resp. M-types) can be defined up to isomorphism as initial algebras (resp. final coalgebras) for polynomial functors. In this case, the property of initiality (res. finality) corresponds directly to the appropriate induction principle. In intensional type theories with the univalence axiom, this correspondence holds up to homotopy (propositional equality).\n\nM-types are dual to W-types, they represent coinductive (potentially infinite) data such as streams. M-types can be derived from W-types.\n\n Mutually inductive definitions \n\nThis technique allows some definitions of multiple types that depend on each other. For example, defining two parity predicates on natural numbers using two mutually inductive types in Coq:\n\nInductive even : nat -> Prop :=\n  | zero_is_even : even O\n  | S_of_odd_is_even : (forall n:nat, odd n -> even (S n))\nwith odd : nat -> Prop :=\n  | S_of_even_is_odd : (forall n:nat, even n -> odd (S n)).\n\n Induction-recursion \n\nInduction-recursion started as a study into the limits of ITT.  Once found, the limits were turned into rules that allowed defining new inductive types.  These types could depend upon a function and the function on the type, as long as both were defined simultaneously.\n\nUniverse types can be defined using induction-recursion.\n\n Induction-induction \n\nInduction-induction allows definition of a type and a family of types at the same time.  So, a type  and a family of types .\n\n Higher inductive types \n\nThis is a current research area in Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT).  HoTT differs from ITT by its identity type (equality).  Higher inductive types not only define a new type with constants and functions that create the type, but also new instances of the identity type that relate them.\n\nA simple example is the  type, which is defined with two constructors, a basepoint;\n\nand a loop;\n\nThe existence of a new constructor for the identity type makes  a higher inductive type.\n\n See also \n Coinduction permits (effectively) infinite structures in type theory.\n\n References \n\n \n\n External links \n Induction-Recursion Slides\n Induction-Induction Slides\n Higher Inductive Types: a tour of the menagerie\n\nCategory:Type theory"}
{"title": "Interlinguistics", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlinguistics", "text": "Interlinguistics, as the science of planned languages, has existed for more than a century as a specific branch of linguisticsFederico Gobbo, Interlinguistics and Esperanto Studies in the new millennium, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam Center for Language and Communication, 27 March 2015. for the study of various aspects of linguistic communication. Interlinguistics is a discipline formalized by Otto Jespersen in 1931 as the science of interlanguages, i.e. contact languages tailored for international communication. In more recent times, the object of study of interlinguistics was put into relation with language planning, the collection of strategies to deliberately influence the structure and function of a living language. In this framework, interlanguages become a subset of planned languages, i.e. extreme cases of language planning.Federico Gobbo, Interlinguistics in the 21st century: planned languages as a tool to learn linguistics by doing, University of Amsterdam, 24 March 2017.\n\nInterlinguistics first appeared as a branch of studies devoted to the establishment of norms for auxiliary languages, but over its century-long history it has been understood by different authors more and more broadly as an interdisciplinary branch of science which includes various aspects of communication, language planning and standardization, multilingualism and globalisation, language policy, translation, sociolinguistics, intercultural communication, the history of language creation and literature written in planned languages (international auxiliary languages (auxlangs) as well as constructed languages : conlangs), fictional artistic languages (artlangs), lingua francas, pidgins, creoles and constructed languages in the internet and other topics were addedV\u011bra Barandovsk\u00e1-Frank, The Concept of Interlinguistics as an object of study, 4th Interlinguistic Symposium 21-22.09.2017, Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan, Poland.\n\n Etymology and history \nThe hybrid term was first coined in French (as Interlinguistique) by the Belgian Esperantist Jules Meysmans.(eo) \u00abBiografio de Jules Meysmans \u00bb, Informilo por interlingvistoj, 2015, p. 14 (ISSN 1385-2191, online (PDF) archive)\n\nThe main historical periods of interlinguistics are:\n first, the pioneer era (1879\u20131911), when its basis was put forth; \n secondly, the foundational era (1911\u20131951), when the interlinguistics wars took place to decide the most appropriate form of an auxiliary language; \n thirdly, the school era (1951\u20131990), when independent Interlinguistics schools formed in different countries, mainly Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland, each with particular attention to Esperanto; \n lastly, the current era of language policy (1990\u2013today), during which interlinguistics is more tightly integrated with other disciplines, mainly linguistics and various social and political sciences, particularly via the topics of globalism, linguistic justice, management of multilingualism, and new forms of mobility.Federico Gobbo, Interlinguistics in the 21st century: new opportunities, new challenges, in : Information for Interlinguists, vol. 2, no. 5 (3/2018), p. 9 | ISSN 2521-7461 (PDF)   \n\nAt the Institute of Linguistics of AMU there is the extramural Interlinguistic studies program. Over the course of three years these studies provide the students with a basic knowledge of general linguistics, interlinguistics, international and intercultural communication with a focus on the linguistics, culture and movement of the internationally dispersed and naturally functioning planned language Esperanto. Every third year the Interlinguistic Studies program also organizes an international interlinguistic symposiumIlona Koutny, Interlinguistic Symposium, p. 212, JKI-12-2017[1] (pdf).. \n\nAt the University of Amsterdam there is also a chair of Esperanto and interlinguistics at the University of Amsterdam.\n\n Field of studies \nThe field of interlinguistics is concerned with international planned languages Planned languages are created by an intentional intellectual effort, usually with the aim of facilitating interlinguistic communication, but there are also interlanguages that have arisen spontaneously. These are called pidgin languages.  [also called \u2018constructed languages\u2018, \u2018auxiliary languages\u2018, or \u2018artificial languages\u2018] as Esperanto, and with the relationship between planned languagesThe phenomenon of planned languages offers important insights into general linguistics and into planning language use at the international level. and language planning. Increasingly, undergraduate courses in planned languages are expanding to embrace not only the history of languages planned for international use, but also the field of imaginary and fictional languagesYevgeniya Amis, ESF convenes symposium on Esperanto and Interlinguistics, Esperantic Studies Foundation, . Interlinguistics is also concerned with investigating how ethnic and international planned languages work as lingua franca and with the possibilities of optimizing interlinguistic communication. \n\nThe term Interlinguistics can be interpreted in at least two ways: \n\n Study of  interlinguae, i.e., of interlanguages that serve for interlinguistic communication - not to be confused with the interim languages of language learners, which also came to be called \u201dinterlanguages\u201d by some authors.\n Study of phenomena that can be observed inter linguae 'between languages'.\nAmong these interpretations, the first one is by far the most well established, while Mario Wandruszka had only the second one in mind.Mario Wandruszka: Interlinguistik: Umrisse einer neuen Sprachwissenschaft. (\u2019Interlinguistics: Contours of a New Linguistic Discipline\u2019) Piper Verlag, 1982, \n\nThe term appears first to have been used in French (interlinguistique) by Jules Meysmans in 1911 in a text concerning international auxiliary languages.Jules Meysmans (1911-12): Une science nouvelle. In: Lingua Internationale (Bruxelles). 1, Nr. 8, 14-16. It became more widely accepted subsequent to an address by the Danish linguist Otto Jespersen to the 2nd International Congress of Linguists in 1931. According to Jespersen, interlinguistics is \u201dthat branch of the science of language which deals with the structure and basic ideas of all languages with the view to the establishing of a norm for interlanguages, i.e. auxiliary languages destined for oral and written use between people who cannot make themselves understood by means of their mother tongues\u201d.Herbert N. Shenton, Edward Sapir, Otto Jespersen (eds.): International Communication: A Symposium on the Language Problem. Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., London 1931. According to this definition, investigations that are useful for optimizing interlinguistic communication are central to the discipline, and the purpose may be to develop a new language intended for international use or for use within a multilingual country or union. Research of this kind has been undertaken by the International Delegation, which developed Ido (1907), and by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA), which developed Interlingua (1951).\n\nValter Tauli considered interlinguistics as a subdiscipline of language planning.Valter Tauli (1968): Introduction to a theory of language planning. Uppsala: Almquist & Wiksells, S. 167. The principles recommended by him for language planning applied to the guided development of national languages are also, and more liberally so, applicable to constructed interlanguages. It is noteworthy that these principles have close counterparts among Grice\u2019s conversational maxims. These maxims describe how effective communication in conversation is achieved, and in order to function well, a language must be such that it allows respecting these maxims, which languages not always do.Hartmut Traunm\u00fcller: Conversational Maxims and Principles of Language Planning PERILUS XII, pp 25-47, Department of Linguistics, Stockholm University, 1991.\n\nMost publications in the field of interlinguistics are, however, not so constructive, but rather descriptive, comparative, historic, sociolinguistic, or concerned with translation by humans or machines. As for Esperanto, which is the most widely used constructed interlanguage, there is a relatively abundant literature about the language itself and its philology (see Esperantology).\n\nOnly a few of the many constructed languages have been applied practically to any noteworthy extent. The most prosperous were Volap\u00fck (1879, Johann Martin Schleyer), Esperanto (1887 Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof), Latino sine flexione (1903, Giuseppe Peano), Ido (1907, Louis Couturat), Occidental-Interlingue (1922, Edgar de Wahl) and Interlingua (1951, IALA and Alexander Gode), with Esperanto being the only one still gathering a considerable community of active speakers today. Here, the Bliss symbols (1949, Charles K. Bliss)Charles K. Bliss: International semantography: a non-alphabetical symbol writing readable in all languages Institute of Semantography, Sidney 1949 deserve also to be mentioned. These were intended for international communication, but have found their field of application elsewhere, namely as an aid for persons who lack an adequate ability of using ordinary language, because of motorical or cognitive handicaps.\n\n Kinds of interlanguages \nThe following table lists only one representative for each type explicitly. \nSpoken language onlySpoken and written languageWritten language onlyGestural languageMultimedial language Spontaneous  Russenorsk and others  Tok Pisin and other stabilized pidgins  Classical Chinese (used interlinguistically)  Plains Indian Sign LanguageWilliam Tomkins: Universal Indian Sign Language of the Plains Indians of North America, San Diego, California, 1927.  Silbo gomero and other whistled languages Constructed  Damin (not interlinguistic)  Esperanto and others  Bliss symbols and other pasigraphies  Gestuno (for the deaf)  Solresol\n  \nAmong constructed languages, it is usual to distinguish between a priori languages and a posteri languages. The latter are based on one or, more often, several source languages, while this is not evident for a priori languages, e.g., the philosophical languages of the 17th century, Solresol and the logical languages of the 20th century, such as Loglan and Lojban.  Spontaneously arisen Interlanguages are necessarily a posteriori or iconic (using imaging or imitating signs).\n\n Bibliography \nGode, Alexander, Interlingua: A Dictionary of the International Language.

{"title": "International Volap\u00fck Academy", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Volap%C3%BCk_Academy", "text": "The International Academy of Volap\u00fck () was a ruling body established at the second Volap\u00fck congress in Munich in August 1887 with the goal of preserving and improving Volap\u00fck.Schmidt, Johann. 1964. Jenotem valemap\u00fcka Volap\u00fck. Amsterdam: Volap\u00fckagased.Schmidt, Johann. 1996. Historio de la universala lingvo Volapuko. Tradukinto: Philippe Combot. Courgenard: La Blancheti\u00e8re. \n\nIts aim was to help the creator of Volap\u00fck, Johann Martin Schleyer, in the propagation of the language itself. Tazio Carlevaro set the original hierarchical committee, with Schleyer himself as Leader (cifal) along with the great French Volap\u00fck-pioneer Auguste Kerckhoffs as the business guide (or director: dilekel). Seventeen language specialists from twelve countries were elected as first-class academy-members (kademals), and the appointment was envisioned of second-class academy-members (kademels) and of corresponding academy-members (kademans) totaling 31 members in the academy. The headquarters of the academy was established in Paris.\n\nSchleyer conceded to Kerckhoffs that the organizational form determined in Munich should be considered only as an interim and that defining (or transformation) of the academic structure should be decided in the aftermath of the International Congress which was to be held in Paris in the 1889. In addition, Kerckhoffs received from Schleyer permission to appoint seven of the seventeen kademals of people to be selected by him. The medium of communication of the Academy was circulars from the director (Zulags), as well as Kerckhoffs' own journal Le Volap\u00fck.\n\nKerckhoffs' grammars published since 1887 differed fundamentally from the Volap\u00fck of Schleyer. With the intention of ending the strife between them, Kerckhoffs organized the third congress of the movement in Paris on 19\u201321 August 1889. This Third International Congress of Volap\u00fck took place in Paris. This Congress passed new statutes of the Academy, according to which the subject of the Academy was to complete and improve the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. However, even before 1889, a conflict arose between Schleyer and Kerckhoffs. Though Schleyer wanted a maximum enrichment of Volap\u00fck and to reform it radically in order to simplify the language, Kerckhoffs managed to remove Schleyer's right of veto within the Academy. Schleyer himself never agreed with this essential limitation of his copyright, and when Kerckhoffs offered to block reform of Volap\u00fck, Schleyer dismissed in its entirety the whole Academy.\n\n Schism \nThe Academy, created under the name Kadem bev\u00fcnetik volap\u00fcka''' (International Academy of Volap\u00fck) at a congress in Munich in August 1887, was set up to conserve and perfect the auxiliary language Volap\u00fck. Under Rosenberger, who became the Academy\u2019s director in 1892, the group began to make considerable changes in the grammar and vocabulary of Volap\u00fck. The vocabulary was almost completely replaced by words more closely resembling those used in Western European languages, and a number of grammatical forms unfamiliar to Western Europeans were discarded. It was understood that the changes effectively resulted in the creation of a new language, which was named \u201cIdiom Neutral\u201d (which means \u201cthe neutral idiom\u201d or \u201cthe neutral language\u201d). The name of the Academy was changed to Akademi Internasional de Lingu Universal in 1898 and the circulars of the Academy were written in the new language from that year.\n\nDictionaries of Idiom Neutral and an outline of the grammar were published in several European languages in 1902 and 1903. The language, sometimes referred to as \u201cNeutral\u201d or \u201cthe Neutral language\u201d by English-speaking writers, created interest among international language enthusiasts at the time. Rosenberger published a periodical in the language called Progres. In 1907 Neutral was one of the projects considered by a committee of scholars which met in Paris to select an international auxiliary language (exactly what the committee actually decided upon is disputed; see Ido and its external links for more information).\n\nIn 1908 the Akademi which had created Idiom Neutral effectively chose to abandon it in favor of Latino sine flexione, a simplified form of Latin developed by Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. Peano was appointed the director of the Akademi, and its name was changed to Academia pro Interlingua. Peano's language was sometimes called Interlingua, not to be confused with the better-known Interlingua presented in 1951 by the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA).\n\nIn 1912 Rosenberger published a reformed version of Neutral called Reform-Neutral.\n\nContinuity\nIn 1890 Schleyer himself chose a new Volap\u00fck Academy, from people completely loyal to him with 49 members; its headquarters was in Konstanz. But it remained essentially inactive, and according to the few reports that have appeared about it in the central organ of Volap\u00fck Volapukabled lezenodik its activities were limited to the approval of the decisions of Schleyer.

{"title": "Kleene's T predicate", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleene%27s_T_predicate", "text": "In computability theory, the T predicate, first studied by mathematician Stephen Cole Kleene, is a particular set of triples of natural numbers that is used to represent computable functions within formal theories of arithmetic. Informally, the T predicate tells whether a particular computer program will halt when run with a particular input, and the corresponding U function is used to obtain the results of the computation if the program does halt. As with the smn theorem, the original notation used by Kleene has become standard terminology for the concept.The predicate described here was presented in (Kleene 1943) and (Kleene 1952), and this is what is usually called \"Kleene's T predicate\".  (Kleene 1967) uses the letter T to describe a different predicate related to computable functions, but which cannot be used to obtain Kleene's normal form theorem.\n\n Definition \n\nThe definition depends on a suitable G\u00f6del numbering that assigns natural numbers to computable functions. This numbering must be sufficiently effective that, given an index of a computable function and an input to the function, it is possible to effectively simulate the computation of the function on that input.  The T predicate is obtained by formalizing this simulation.\n\nThe ternary relation T1(e,i,x) takes three natural numbers as arguments. The triples of numbers (e,i,x) that belong to the relation (the ones for which T1(e,i,x) is true) are defined to be exactly the triples in which x encodes a computation history of the computable function with index e when run with input i, and the program halts as the last step of this computation history. That is, T1 first asks whether x is the G\u00f6del number of a finite sequence \u2329xj\u232a of complete configurations of the Turing machine with index e, running a computation on input i.  If so, T1 then asks if this sequence begins with the starting state of the computation and each successive element of the sequence corresponds to a single step of the Turing machine. If it does, T1 finally asks whether the sequence \u2329xj\u232a ends with the machine in a halting state. If all three of these questions have a positive answer, then T1(e,i,x) holds (is true). Otherwise, T1(e,i,x) does not hold (is false).\n\nThere is a corresponding function U such that if T(e,i,x) holds then U(x) returns the output of the function with index e on input i.\n\nBecause Kleene's formalism attaches a number of inputs to each function, the predicate T1 can only be used for functions that take one input. There are additional predicates for functions with multiple inputs; the relation\n\n,\n\nholds if x encodes a halting computation of the function with index e on the inputs i1,...,ik.\n\n Normal form theorem \n\nThe T predicate can be used to obtain Kleene's normal form theorem for computable functions (Soare 1987, p.\u00a015). This states there exists a primitive recursive function U such that a function f of one integer argument is computable if and only if there is a number e such that for all n one has\n,\nwhere \u03bc is the \u03bc operator ( is the smallest natural number for which  holds) and  holds if both sides are undefined or if both are defined and they are equal. Here U is a universal operation (it is independent of the computable function f) whose purpose is to extract, from the number x (encoding a complete computation history) returned by the operator \u03bc, just the value f(n) that was found at the end of the computation.\n\n Formalization \n\nThe T predicate is primitive recursive in the sense that there is a primitive recursive function that, given inputs for the predicate, correctly determine the truth value of the predicate on those inputs. Similarly, the U function is primitive recursive.\n\nBecause of this, any theory of arithmetic that is able to represent every primitive recursive function is able to represent T and U. Examples of such arithmetical theories include Robinson arithmetic and stronger theories such as Peano arithmetic.\n\n Arithmetical hierarchy \n\nIn addition to encoding computability, the T predicate can be used to generate complete sets in the arithmetical hierarchy. In particular, the set \n\nwhich is of the same Turing degree as the halting problem, is a  complete unary relation (Soare 1987, pp.\u00a028, 41). More generally, the set\n \nis a  complete (n+1)-ary predicate. Thus, once a representation of the T predicate is obtained in a theory of arithmetic, a representation of a -complete predicate can be obtained from it.\n\nThis construction can be extended higher in the arithmetical hierarchy, as in Post's theorem (compare Hinman 2005, p.\u00a0397). For example, if a set  is  complete then the set\n\nis  complete.\n\n Notes \n \n\n References \n Peter Hinman, 2005, Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic, A K Peters.  \n Stephen Cole Kleene, 1943,  \"Recursive predicates and quantifiers\", Transactions of the American Mathematical Society v. 53 n. 1, pp.\u00a041\u201373.

{"title": "Lambda cube", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube", "text": "alt=|frame|The lambda cube. Direction of each arrow is direction of inclusion.\n\nIn mathematical logic and type theory, the \u03bb-cube is a framework introduced by Henk Barendregt  to investigate the different dimensions in which the calculus of constructions is a generalization of the simply typed \u03bb-calculus. Each dimension of the cube corresponds to a new kind of dependency between terms and types. Here, \"dependency\" refers to the capacity of a term or type to bind a term or type. The respective dimensions of the \u03bb-cube correspond to:\n\n terms that can bind types, corresponding to polymorphism.\n types that can bind terms, corresponding to dependent types.\n types that can bind types, corresponding to (binding) type operators.\n\nThe different ways to combine these three dimension yield the 8 vertices of the cube, each corresponding to a different kind of typed system.\n\n Examples of Systems \n\n Simply typed lambda calculus \n\nThe simplest system found in the \u03bb-cube is the simply typed lambda calculus, also called \u03bb\u2192. In this system, the only way to construct an abstraction is by making a term depend on a term variable, with the rule\n\n System F \nIn System F, also named \u03bb2, there is another type of abstraction, written with a , that allows terms to depend on types, with the following rule:\n\nThe terms beginning with a  are called polymorphic, as they can be applied to different types to get different functions, similarly to polymorphic functions in ML-like languages. For instance, the polymorphic identity fun x -> xof OCaml has type 'a -> 'ameaning it can take an argument of any type and return an element of that type. This type corresponds in \u03bb2 to the type .\n\n Lambda-P \nIn the \u03bbP system, also named \u039b\u03a0, and closely related to the Logical Framework, one has so called dependent types. These are types that are allowed to depend on terms. The crucial induction rule of the system is\n\nwhere represents valid types. The new type constructor corresponds via the Curry-Howard isomorphism to a universal quantifier, and the system \u03bbP as a whole corresponds to first order logic with implication as only connective. An example of these dependent types in concrete programming is the type of vectors on a certain length: the length is a term, on which the type depends.\n\n System F\u03c9 \nIn System F\u03c9, one has the  constructor of System F, but another construction is allowed: types can be constructed from other types. This is called type constructors, and an example would be , which takes a type parameter . In concrete programming, this feature corresponds to the ability to define type constructors inside the language, rather than considering them as primitives. The previous type constructor roughly corresponds to the following definition of a trees with labeled leaves in OCaml:type tree = | Leaf of a | Node of 'a tree * 'a tree\n\n Calculus of constructions \nIn the calculus of constructions, denoted as \u03bbC in the cube, these three features cohabit, so that both types and terms can depend on types and terms. The clear border that exists in \u03bb\u2192 between terms and types is somewhat abolished, as all types except the universal  are themselves terms with a type.\n\n Formal definition \n\nAs for all systems based upon the simply typed lambda calculus, all systems in the cube are given in two steps: first, raw terms, together with a notion of \u03b2-reduction, and then typing rules that allow to type those terms.\n\nThe set of sorts is defined as , sorts are represented with the letter . There is also a set  of variables, represented by the letters . The raw terms of the eight systems of the cube are given by the following syntax:\n\nand  denoting  when  does not occur free in .\n\nThe environment, as is usual in typed systems, are given by\n\nThe notion of \u03b2-reduction is common to all systems in the cube. It is written  and given by the rulesIts reflexive, transitive closure is written .\n\nThe following typing rules are also common to all systems in the cube:The difference between the systems is in the pairs of sorts  that are allowed in the following two typing rules:\n\nThe correspondence between the systems and the pairs  allowed in the rules is the following:\n\u03bb\u2192x\u03bbPxx\u03bb2xx\u03bb\u03c9xx\u03bbP2xxx\u03bbP\u03c9xxx\u03bb\u03c9xxx\u03bbCxxxx\n\nEach direction of the cube corresponds to one pair (excluding the pair  shared by all systems), and in turn each pair corresponds to one possibility of dependency between terms and types:\n\n  allows terms to depend on terms.\n  allows types to depend on terms.\n  allows terms to depend on types.\n  allows types to depend on types.\n\nComparison between the systems\n\n\u03bb\u2192\n\nA typical derivation that can be obtained isor with the arrow shortcutclosely resembling the identity (of type ) of the usual \u03bb\u2192. Note that all types used must appear in the context, because the only derivation that can be done in an empty context is .\n\nThe computing power is quite weak, it corresponds to the extended polynomials (polynomials together with a conditional operator) .\n\n\u03bb2\n\nIn \u03bb2, such terms can be obtained aswith . If one reads  as a universal quantification, via the Curry-Howard isomorphism, this can be seen as a proof of the principle of explosion. In general, \u03bb2 adds the possibility to have impredicative types such as , that is terms quantifying over all types including themselves.The polymorphism also allows the construction of functions that were not constructible in \u03bb\u2192. More precisely, the function definable in System F are those provably total in second order Peano arithmetic. In particular, all primitive recursive functions are definable.\n\u03bbP\n\nIn \u03bbP, the ability to have types depending on terms means one can express logical predicates. For instance, the following is derivable:which corresponds, via  the Curry-Howard isomorphism, to a proof of .From the computational point of view, however, having dependent types does not enhance computational power, only the possibility to express more precise type properties.\n\nThe conversion rule is strongly needed when dealing with dependent types, because it allows to perform computation on the terms in the type. For instance, if you have  and , you need to apply the conversion rule to obtain  to be able to type .\n\u03bb\u03c9\n\nIn \u03bb\u03c9, the following operatoris definable, that is . The derivationcan be obtained already in \u03bb\u03c9, however the polymorphic  can only be defined if the rule  is also present.\n\nFrom a computing point of view, \u03bb\u03c9 is extremely strong, and has been considered as a basis for programming languages .\n\n\u03bbC\n\nThe calculus of constructions has both the predicate expressiveness of \u03bbP and the computational power of \u03bb\u03c9, so it is very powerful, both on the logical side and on the computational side.\n\n Relation to other systems \nThe system Automath is similar to \u03bb2 from a logical point of view. The ML-like languages, from a typing point of view, lie somewhere between \u03bb\u2192 and \u03bb2, as they admit a restricted kind of polymorphic types, that is the types in prenex normal form. However, because they feature some recursion operators, their computing power is greater than that of \u03bb2. The Coq system is based on an extension of \u03bbC with a linear hierarchy of universes, rather than only one untypable , and the ability to construct inductive types.\n\nPure Type Systems can be seen as a generalization of the cube, with an arbitrary set of sorts, axiom, product and abstraction rules. Conversely, the systems of the lambda cube can be expressed as Pure Type Systems with two sorts , the only axiom , and a set of rules  such that .\n\nVia the Curry-Howard isomorphism, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the systems in the lambda cube and logical systems, namely:\nSystem of the cubeLogical System\u03bb\u2192(First Order) Propositional Calculus\u03bb2Second Order Propositional Caculus\u03bb\u03c9Weakly Higher Order Propositional Calculus\u03bb\u03c9Higher Order Propositional Calculus\u03bbP(First Order) Predicate Logic\u03bbP2Second Order Predicate Calculus\u03bbP\u03c9Weak Higher Order Predicate Calculus\u03bbCCalculus of Constructions\nAll the logics are implicative (i.e. the only connectives are  and ), however one can define other connectives such as  or  in an impredicative way in second and higher order logics. In the weak higher order logics, there are variables for higher order predicates, but no quantification on those can be done.\n\nCommon properties\n\nAll systems in the cube enjoy\n the Church-Rosser property: if  and  then there exists  such that  and ;\n the subject reduction property: if  and  then ;\n the uniqueness of types: if  and  then .\n\nAll of these can be proven on generic pure type systems.\n\nAny term well-typed in a system of the cube is strongly normalizing, although this property is not common to all pure type systems. No system in the cube is Turing complete.\n\n Subtyping \nSubtyping however is not represented in the cube, even though systems like , known as higher-order bounded quantification, which combines subtyping and polymorphism are of practical interest, and can be further generalized to bounded type operators. Further extensions to  allow the definition of purely functional objects; these systems were generally developed after the lambda cube paper was published.\n\nThe idea of the cube is due to the mathematician Henk Barendregt (1991). The framework of pure type systems generalizes the lambda cube in the sense that all corners of the cube, as well as many other systems can be represented as instances of this general framework. This framework predates the lambda cube by a couple of years. In his 1991 paper, Barendregt also defines the corners of the cube in this framework.\n\n See also \n\n In his Habilitation \u00e0 diriger les recherches, Olivier Ridoux gives a cut-out template of the lambda cube and also a dual representation of the cube as an octahedron, where the 8 vertices are replaced by faces, as well as a dual representation as a dodecahedron, where the 12 edges are replaced by faces.\n Homotopy type theory \n\n Notes \n\n Further reading \n\n Simon Peyton Jones and Erik Meijer, 1997.

Serre introduced \u010cech cohomology of sheaves in this paper, and, despite some technical deficiencies, revolutionized formulations of algebraic geometry.  For example, the long exact sequence in sheaf cohomology allows one to show that some surjective maps of sheaves induce surjective maps on sections; specifically, these are the maps whose kernel (as a sheaf) has a vanishing first cohomology group.  The dimension of a vector space of sections of a coherent sheaf is finite, in projective geometry, and such dimensions include many discrete invariants of varieties, for example Hodge numbers.  While Grothendieck's derived functor cohomology has replaced \u010cech cohomology for technical reasons, actual calculations, such as of the cohomology of projective space, are usually carried out by \u010cech techniques, and for this reason Serre's paper remains important.\n\nG\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Analytique\n\n Jean-Pierre Serre (1956)\nIn mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are closely related subjects, where analytic geometry is the theory of complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. A (mathematical) theory of the relationship between the two was put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from Hodge theory. (NB While analytic geometry as use of Cartesian coordinates is also in a sense included in the scope of algebraic geometry, that is not the topic being discussed in this article.) The major paper consolidating the theory was G\u00e9ometrie Alg\u00e9brique et G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Analytique by Serre, now usually referred to as GAGA. A GAGA-style result would now mean any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, and a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.\n\n\"Le th\u00e9or\u00e8me de Riemann\u2013Roch, d'apr\u00e8s A. Grothendieck\"\n\n Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre (1958)\nBorel and Serre's exposition of Grothendieck's version of the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem, published after Grothendieck made it clear that he was not interested in writing up his own result.  Grothendieck reinterpreted both sides of the formula that Hirzebruch proved in 1953 in the framework of morphisms between varieties, resulting in a sweeping generalization.  In his proof, Grothendieck broke new ground with his concept of Grothendieck groups, which led to the development of K-theory.\n\n\u00c9l\u00e9ments de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique\n\n Alexander Grothendieck (1960\u20131967)\nWritten with the assistance of Jean Dieudonn\u00e9, this is Grothendieck's exposition of his reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry.  It has become the most important foundational work in modern algebraic geometry.  The approach expounded in EGA, as these books are known, transformed the field and led to monumental advances.\n\nS\u00e9minaire de g\u00e9om\u00e9trie alg\u00e9brique\n\n Alexander Grothendieck et al.\nThese seminar notes on Grothendieck's reworking of the foundations of algebraic geometry report on work done at IH\u00c9S starting in the 1960s. SGA 1 dates from the seminars of 1960\u20131961, and the last in the series, SGA 7, dates from 1967 to 1969. In contrast to EGA, which is intended to set foundations, SGA describes ongoing research as it unfolded in Grothendieck's seminar; as a result, it is quite difficult to read, since many of the more elementary and foundational results were relegated to EGA. One of the major results building on the results in SGA is Pierre Deligne's proof of the last of the open Weil conjectures in the early 1970s. Other authors who worked on one or several volumes of SGA include Michel Raynaud, Michael Artin, Jean-Pierre Serre, Jean-Louis Verdier, Pierre Deligne, and Nicholas Katz.\n\nNumber theory\n\nBr\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta\n\nBrahmagupta (628)\nBrahmagupta's Br\u0101hmasphu\u1e6dasiddh\u0101nta is the first book that mentions zero as a number, hence Brahmagupta is considered the first to formulate the concept of zero. The current system of the four fundamental operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) based on the Hindu-Arabic number system also first appeared in Brahmasphutasiddhanta. It was also one of the first texts to provide concrete ideas on positive and negative numbers.\n\nDe fractionibus continuis dissertatio\n\nLeonhard Euler (1744)\nFirst presented in 1737, this paper  provided the first then-comprehensive account of the properties of continued fractions.  It also contains the first proof that the number e is irrational.\n\nRecherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique\n\nJoseph Louis Lagrange (1775)\nDeveloped a general theory of binary quadratic forms to handle the general problem of when an integer is representable by the form . This included a reduction theory for binary quadratic forms, where he proved that every form is equivalent to a certain canonically chosen reduced form.\n\nDisquisitiones Arithmeticae\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss (1801)\nThe Disquisitiones Arithmeticae is a profound and masterful book on number theory written by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss and first published in 1801 when Gauss was 24. In this book Gauss brings together results in number theory obtained by mathematicians such as Fermat, Euler, Lagrange and Legendre and adds many important new results of his own.  Among his contributions was the first complete proof known of the Fundamental theorem of arithmetic, the first two published proofs of the law of quadratic reciprocity, a deep investigation of binary quadratic forms going beyond Lagrange's work in Recherches d'Arithm\u00e9tique, a first appearance of Gauss sums, cyclotomy, and the theory of constructible polygons with a particular application to the constructibility of the regular 17-gon.  Of note, in section V, article 303 of Disquisitiones, Gauss summarized his calculations of class numbers of imaginary quadratic number fields, and in fact found all imaginary quadratic number fields of class numbers 1, 2, and 3 (confirmed in 1986) as he had conjectured.  In section VII, article 358, Gauss proved what can be interpreted as the first non-trivial case of the Riemann Hypothesis for curves over finite fields (the Hasse\u2013Weil theorem).\n\n\"Beweis des Satzes, da\u00df jede unbegrenzte arithmetische Progression, deren erstes Glied und Differenz ganze Zahlen ohne gemeinschaftlichen Factor sind, unendlich viele Primzahlen enth\u00e4lt\"\n\nPeter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1837)\nPioneering paper in analytic number theory, which introduced Dirichlet characters and their L-functions to establish Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.  In subsequent publications, Dirichlet used these tools to determine, among other things, the class number for quadratic forms.\n\n\"\u00dcber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr\u00f6sse\"\n\nBernhard Riemann (1859)\n\"\u00dcber die Anzahl der Primzahlen unter einer gegebenen Gr\u00f6sse\" (or \"On the Number of Primes Less Than a Given Magnitude\") is a seminal 8-page paper by Bernhard Riemann published in the November 1859 edition of the Monthly Reports of the Berlin Academy. Although it is the only paper he ever published on number theory, it contains ideas which influenced dozens of researchers during the late 19th century and up to the present day. The paper consists primarily of definitions, heuristic arguments, sketches of proofs, and the application of powerful analytic methods; all of these have become essential concepts and tools of modern analytic number theory.  It also contains the famous Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most important open problems in mathematics.H. M. Edwards, Riemann's Zeta Function, Academic Press, 1974\n\nVorlesungen \u00fcber Zahlentheorie\n\n Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Richard Dedekind\nVorlesungen \u00fcber Zahlentheorie (Lectures on Number Theory) is a textbook of number theory written by German mathematicians P. G. Lejeune Dirichlet and R. Dedekind, and published in 1863.\nThe Vorlesungen can be seen as a watershed between the classical number theory of Fermat, Jacobi and Gauss, and the modern number theory of Dedekind, Riemann and Hilbert. Dirichlet does not explicitly recognise the concept of the group that is central to modern algebra, but many of his proofs show an implicit understanding of group theory\n\nZahlbericht\n David Hilbert (1897)\nUnified and made accessible many of the developments in algebraic number theory made during the nineteenth century. Although criticized by Andr\u00e9 Weil (who stated \"more than half of his famous Zahlbericht is little more than an account of Kummer's number-theoretical work, with inessential improvements\") and Emmy Noether, it was highly influential for many years following its publication.\n\nFourier Analysis in Number Fields and Hecke's Zeta-Functions\n\n John Tate (1950)\nGenerally referred to simply as Tate's Thesis, Tate's Princeton Ph.D. thesis, under Emil Artin, is a reworking of Erich Hecke's theory of zeta- and L-functions in terms of Fourier analysis on the adeles. The introduction of these methods into number theory made it possible to formulate extensions of Hecke's results to more general L-functions such as those arising from automorphic forms.\n\n\"Automorphic Forms on GL(2)\"\n\n Herv\u00e9 Jacquet and Robert Langlands (1970)\nThis publication offers evidence towards Langlands' conjectures by reworking and expanding the classical theory of modular forms and their L-functions through the introduction of representation theory.\n\n\"La conjecture de Weil. I.\"\n\n Pierre Deligne (1974)\nProved the Riemann hypothesis for varieties over finite fields, settling the last of the open Weil conjectures.\n\n\"Endlichkeitss\u00e4tze f\u00fcr abelsche Variet\u00e4ten \u00fcber Zahlk\u00f6rpern\"\n\n Gerd Faltings (1983)\nFaltings proves a collection of important results in this paper, the most famous of which is the first proof of the Mordell conjecture (a conjecture dating back to 1922). Other theorems proved in this paper include an instance of the Tate conjecture (relating the homomorphisms between two abelian varieties over a number field to the homomorphisms between their Tate modules) and some finiteness results concerning abelian varieties over number fields with certain properties.\n\n\"Modular Elliptic Curves and Fermat's Last Theorem\"\n\n Andrew Wiles (1995)\nThis article proceeds to prove a special case of the Shimura\u2013Taniyama conjecture through the study of the deformation theory of Galois representations. This in turn implies the famed Fermat's Last Theorem. The proof's method of identification of a deformation ring with a Hecke algebra (now referred to as an R=T theorem) to prove modularity lifting theorems has been an influential development in algebraic number theory.\n\nThe geometry and cohomology of some simple Shimura varieties\n\n Michael Harris and Richard Taylor (2001)\nHarris and Taylor provide the first proof of the local Langlands conjecture for GL(n). As part of the proof, this monograph also makes an in depth study of the geometry and cohomology of certain Shimura varieties at primes of bad reduction.\n\n\"Le lemme fondamental pour les alg\u00e8bres de Lie\"\n\n Ng\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u\nNg\u00f4 B\u1ea3o Ch\u00e2u proved a long-standing unsolved problem in the classical Langlands program, using methods from the Geometric Langlands program.\n\nAnalysis\n\nIntroductio in analysin infinitorum\n\n Leonhard Euler (1748)\nThe eminent historian of mathematics Carl Boyer once called Euler's Introductio in analysin infinitorum the greatest modern textbook in mathematics.  Published in two volumes, this book more than any other work succeeded in establishing analysis as a major branch of mathematics, with a focus and approach distinct from that used in geometry and algebra.  Notably, Euler identified functions rather than curves to be the central focus in his book.  Logarithmic, exponential, trigonometric, and transcendental functions were covered, as were  expansions into partial fractions, evaluations of  for  a positive integer between 1 and 13, infinite series-infinite product formulas, continued fractions, and partitions of integers.  In this work, Euler proved that every rational number can be written as a finite continued fraction, that the continued fraction of an irrational number is infinite, and  derived continued fraction expansions for  and . This work also contains a statement of Euler's formula and a statement of the pentagonal number theorem, which he had discovered earlier and would publish a proof for in 1751.\n\nCalculus\n\nYuktibh\u0101\u1e63\u0101\n\nJyeshtadeva (1501)\nWritten in India in 1530, this was the world's first calculus text. \"This work laid the foundation for a complete system of fluxions\"\n and served as a summary of the Kerala School's achievements in calculus, trigonometry and mathematical analysis, most of which were earlier discovered by the 14th century  mathematician Madhava. It is possible that this text influenced the later development of calculus in Europe. Some of its important developments in calculus include: the fundamental ideas of differentiation and integration, the derivative, differential equations, term by term integration, numerical integration by means of infinite series, the relationship between the area of a curve and its integral, and the mean value theorem.\n\nNova methodus pro maximis et minimis, itemque tangentibus, quae nec fractas nec irrationales quantitates moratur, et singulare pro illi calculi genus\n\nGottfried Leibniz (1684)\nLeibniz's first publication on differential calculus, containing the now familiar notation for differentials as well as rules for computing the derivatives of powers, products and quotients.\n\nPhilosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\n\nIsaac Newton\nThe Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Latin: \"mathematical principles of natural philosophy\", often Principia or Principia Mathematica for short) is a three-volume work by Isaac Newton published on 5 July 1687. Perhaps the most influential scientific book ever published, it contains the statement of Newton's laws of motion forming the foundation of classical mechanics as well as his law of universal gravitation, and derives Kepler's laws for the motion of the planets (which were first obtained empirically). Here was born the practice, now so standard we identify it with science, of explaining nature by postulating mathematical axioms and demonstrating that their conclusion are observable phenomena.  In formulating his physical theories, Newton freely used his unpublished work on calculus.  When he submitted Principia for publication, however, Newton chose to recast the majority of his proofs as geometric arguments.\n\nInstitutiones calculi differentialis cum eius usu in analysi finitorum ac doctrina serierum\n\nthumb|Institutiones calculi differentialis\nLeonhard Euler (1755)\nPublished in two books, Euler's textbook on differential calculus presented the subject in terms of the function concept, which he had introduced in his 1748 Introductio in analysin infinitorum.  This work opens with a study of the calculus of finite differences and makes a thorough investigation of how differentiation behaves under substitutions.  Also included is a systematic study of Bernoulli polynomials and the Bernoulli numbers (naming them as such), a demonstration of how the Bernoulli numbers are related to the coefficients in the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula and the values of \u03b6(2n),  a further study of Euler's constant (including its connection to the gamma function), and an application of partial fractions to differentiation.\n\n\u00dcber die Darstellbarkeit einer Function durch eine trigonometrische Reihe\n\nBernhard Riemann (1867)\nWritten in 1853, Riemann's work on trigonometric series was published posthumously.  In it, he extended Cauchy's definition of the integral to that of the Riemann integral, allowing some functions with dense subsets of discontinuities on an interval to be integrated (which he demonstrated by an example).  He also stated the Riemann series theorem, proved the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma for the case of bounded Riemann integrable functions, and developed the Riemann localization principle.\n\nInt\u00e9grale, longueur, aire\n\nHenri Lebesgue (1901)\n\nLebesgue's doctoral dissertation, summarizing and extending his research to date regarding his development of measure theory and the Lebesgue integral.\n\nComplex analysis\n\nGrundlagen f\u00fcr eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer ver\u00e4nderlichen complexen Gr\u00f6sse\n\n Bernhard Riemann (1851)\n\nRiemann's doctoral dissertation introduced the notion of a Riemann surface, conformal mapping, simple connectivity, the Riemann sphere, the Laurent series expansion for functions having poles and branch points, and the Riemann mapping theorem.\n\nFunctional analysis\n\nTh\u00e9orie des op\u00e9rations lin\u00e9aires \n\n Stefan Banach (1932; originally published 1931 in Polish under the title Teorja operacyj.)\n\nThe first mathematical monograph on the subject of linear metric spaces, bringing the abstract study of functional analysis to the wider mathematical community.  The book introduced the ideas of a normed space and the notion of a so-called B-space, a complete normed space.  The B-spaces are now called Banach spaces and are one of the basic objects of study in all areas of modern mathematical analysis.  Banach also gave proofs of versions of the open mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, and Hahn\u2013Banach theorem.\n\nFourier analysis\n\nM\u00e9moire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides\n\n Joseph Fourier (1807)Reprinted in\n\nIntroduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Key contribution was to not simply use trigonometric series, but to model all functions by trigonometric series.\n\nWhen Fourier submitted his paper in 1807, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: ...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and [...]  his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour. Making Fourier series rigorous, which in detail took over a century, led directly to a number of developments in analysis, notably the rigorous statement of the integral via the Dirichlet integral and later the Lebesgue integral.\n\nSur la convergence des s\u00e9ries trigonom\u00e9triques qui servent \u00e0 repr\u00e9senter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites donn\u00e9es\n\n Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet (1829, expanded German edition in 1837)\n\nIn his habilitation thesis on Fourier series, Riemann characterized this work of Dirichlet as \"the first profound paper about the subject\".  This paper gave the first rigorous proof of the convergence of Fourier series under fairly general conditions (piecewise continuity and monotonicity) by considering partial sums, which Dirichlet transformed into a particular Dirichlet integral involving what is now called the Dirichlet kernel.  This paper introduced the nowhere continuous Dirichlet function and an early version of the Riemann\u2013Lebesgue lemma.\n\nOn convergence and growth of partial sums of Fourier series\n\n Lennart Carleson (1966)\n\nSettled Lusin's conjecture that the Fourier expansion of any  function converges almost everywhere.\n\nGeometry\n\nBaudhayana Sulba Sutra\n\n Baudhayana\nWritten around the 8th century BC, this is one of the oldest geometrical texts. It laid the foundations of Indian mathematics and was influential in South Asia and its surrounding regions, and perhaps even Greece. Among the important geometrical discoveries included in this text are: the earliest list of Pythagorean triples discovered algebraically, the earliest statement of the Pythagorean theorem,  geometric solutions of linear equations, several approximations of \u03c0, the first use of irrational numbers, and an accurate computation of the square root of 2, correct to a remarkable five decimal places. Though this was primarily a geometrical text, it also contained some important algebraic developments, including the earliest use of quadratic equations of the forms ax2 = c and ax2 + bx = c, and integral solutions of simultaneous Diophantine equations with up to four unknowns.\n\nEuclid's Elements\n\n Euclid\nPublication data: c. 300 BC\n\nOnline version: Interactive Java version\n\nThis is often regarded as not only the most important work in geometry but one of the most important works in mathematics. It contains many important results in plane and solid geometry, algebra (books II and V), and number theory (book VII, VIII, and IX).   More than any specific result in the publication, it seems that the major achievement of this publication is the promotion of an axiomatic approach as a means for proving results.  Euclid's Elements has been referred to as the most successful and influential textbook ever written.\n\nThe Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\n\n Unknown author\nThis was a Chinese mathematics book, mostly geometric, composed during the Han Dynasty, perhaps as early as 200 BC. It remained the most important textbook in China and East Asia for over a thousand years, similar to the position of Euclid's Elements in Europe. Among its contents: Linear problems solved using the principle known later in the West as the rule of false position. Problems with several unknowns, solved by a principle similar to Gaussian elimination. Problems involving the principle known in the West as the Pythagorean theorem. The earliest solution of a matrix using a method equivalent to the modern method.\n\nThe Conics\n\n Apollonius of Perga\nThe Conics was written by Apollonius of Perga, a Greek mathematician. His innovative methodology and terminology, especially in the field of conics, influenced many later scholars including Ptolemy, Francesco Maurolico, Isaac Newton, and Ren\u00e9 Descartes. It was Apollonius who gave the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola the names by which we know them.\n\nSurya Siddhanta\n\n Unknown (400 CE)\nContains the roots of modern trigonometry. It describes the archeo-astronomy theories, principles and methods of the ancient Hindus. This siddhanta is supposed to be the knowledge that the Sun god gave to an Asura called Maya. It uses sine (jya), cosine (kojya or \"perpendicular sine\") and inverse sine (otkram jya) for the first time, and also contains the earliest use of the tangent and secant. Later Indian mathematicians such as Aryabhata made references to this text, while later Arabic and Latin translations were very influential in Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAryabhatiya\n\nAryabhata (499 CE)\nThis was a highly influential text during the Golden Age of mathematics in India. The text was highly concise and therefore elaborated upon in commentaries by later mathematicians. It made significant contributions to geometry and astronomy, including introduction of sine/ cosine, determination of the approximate value of pi and accurate calculation of the earth's circumference.\n\nLa G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\n\n Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nLa G\u00e9om\u00e9trie was published in 1637 and written by Ren\u00e9 Descartes. The book was influential in developing the Cartesian coordinate system and specifically discussed the representation of points of a plane, via real numbers; and the representation of curves, via equations.\n\nGrundlagen der Geometrie\n\nDavid Hilbert\nOnline version: English\n\nPublication data:  \n\nHilbert's axiomatization of geometry, whose primary influence was in its pioneering approach to metamathematical questions including the use of models to prove axiom independence and the importance of establishing the consistency and completeness of an axiomatic system.\n\nRegular Polytopes\n\n H.S.M. Coxeter\nRegular Polytopes is a comprehensive survey of the geometry of regular polytopes, the generalisation of regular polygons and regular polyhedra to higher dimensions. Originating with an essay entitled Dimensional Analogy written in 1923, the first edition of the book took Coxeter 24 years to complete. Originally written in 1947, the book was updated and republished in 1963 and 1973.\n\nDifferential geometry\n\nRecherches sur la courbure des surfaces\n\n Leonhard Euler (1760)\nPublication data: M\u00e9moires de l'acad\u00e9mie des sciences de Berlin 16 (1760) pp.\u00a0119\u2013143; published 1767.

A treatise covering virtually every aspect of the 19th century differential geometry of surfaces.\n\nTopology\n\nAnalysis situs\n\n Henri Poincar\u00e9 (1895, 1899\u20131905)\nDescription: Poincar\u00e9's Analysis Situs and his Compl\u00e9ments \u00e0 l'Analysis Situs laid the general foundations for algebraic topology.  In these papers, Poincar\u00e9 introduced the notions of homology and the fundamental group, provided an early formulation of Poincar\u00e9 duality, gave the Euler\u2013Poincar\u00e9 characteristic for chain complexes, and mentioned several important conjectures including the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture.\n\nL'anneau d'homologie d'une repr\u00e9sentation, Structure de l'anneau d'homologie d'une repr\u00e9sentation\n\n Jean Leray (1946)\nThese two Comptes Rendus notes of Leray from 1946 introduced the novel concepts of sheafs, sheaf cohomology, and spectral sequences, which he had developed during his years of captivity as a prisoner of war.  Leray's announcements and applications (published in other Comptes Rendus notes from 1946) drew immediate attention from other mathematicians.  Subsequent clarification, development, and generalization by Henri Cartan, Jean-Louis Koszul, Armand Borel, Jean-Pierre Serre, and Leray himself allowed these concepts to be understood and applied to many other areas of mathematics.  Dieudonn\u00e9 would later write that these notions created by Leray \"undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the methods invented by Poincar\u00e9 and Brouwer\".\n\nQuelques propri\u00e9t\u00e9s globales des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s differentiables\n\nRen\u00e9 Thom (1954)\nIn this paper, Thom proved the Thom transversality theorem, introduced the notions of oriented and unoriented cobordism, and demonstrated that cobordism groups could be computed as the homotopy groups of certain Thom spaces.  Thom completely characterized the unoriented cobordism ring and achieved strong results for several problems, including Steenrod's problem on the realization of cycles.\n\nCategory theory\n\n\"General Theory of Natural Equivalences\"\n\n Samuel Eilenberg and Saunders Mac Lane (1945)\nThe first paper on category theory. Mac Lane later wrote in Categories for the Working Mathematician that he and Eilenberg introduced categories so that they could introduce functors, and they introduced functors so that they could introduce natural equivalences. Prior to this paper, \"natural\" was used in an informal and imprecise way to designate constructions that could be made without making any choices. Afterwards, \"natural\" had a precise meaning which occurred in a wide variety of contexts and had powerful and important consequences.\n\nCategories for the Working Mathematician\n\n Saunders Mac Lane (1971, second edition 1998)\nSaunders Mac Lane, one of the founders of category theory, wrote this exposition to bring categories to the masses.  Mac Lane brings to the fore the important concepts that make category theory useful, such as adjoint functors and universal properties.\n\nHigher Topos Theory\n Jacob Lurie (2010)\nThis purpose of this book is twofold: to provide a general introduction to higher category theory (using the formalism of \"quasicategories\" or \"weak Kan complexes\"), and to apply this theory to the study of higher versions of Grothendieck topoi. A few applications to classical topology are included. (see arXiv.)\n\nSet theory\n\n\"\u00dcber eine Eigenschaft des Inbegriffes aller reellen algebraischen Zahlen\"\n\n Georg Cantor (1874)\nOnline version: Online version\n\nContains the first proof that the set of all real numbers is uncountable; also contains a proof that the set of algebraic numbers is countable. (See Georg Cantor's first set theory article.)\n\nGrundz\u00fcge der Mengenlehre\n\n Felix Hausdorff\nFirst published in 1914, this was the first comprehensive introduction to set theory. Besides the systematic treatment of known results in set theory, the book also contains chapters on measure theory and topology, which were then still considered parts of set theory. Here Hausdorff presents and develops highly original material which was later to become the basis for those areas.\n\n\"The consistency of the axiom of choice and of the generalized continuum-hypothesis with the axioms of set theory\"\n\n Kurt G\u00f6del (1938)\nG\u00f6del proves the results of the title.  Also, in the process, introduces the class L of constructible sets, a major influence in the development of axiomatic set theory.\n\n\"The Independence of the Continuum Hypothesis\"\n\n Paul J. Cohen (1963, 1964)\nCohen's breakthrough work proved the independence of the continuum hypothesis and axiom of choice with respect to Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory.  In proving this Cohen introduced the concept of forcing which led to many other major results in axiomatic set theory.\n\nLogic\n\nThe Laws of Thought\n\n George Boole (1854)\nPublished in 1854, The Laws of Thought was the first book to provide a mathematical foundation for logic. Its aim was a complete re-expression and extension of Aristotle's logic in the language of mathematics. Boole's work founded the discipline of algebraic logic and would later be central for Claude Shannon in the development of digital logic.\n\nBegriffsschrift\n\n Gottlob Frege (1879)\nPublished in 1879, the title Begriffsschrift is usually translated as concept writing or concept notation; the full title of the book identifies it as \"a formula language, modelled on that of arithmetic, of pure thought\". Frege's motivation for developing his formal logical system was similar to Leibniz's desire for a calculus ratiocinator. Frege defines a logical calculus to support his research in the foundations of mathematics. Begriffsschrift is both the name of the book and the calculus defined therein.  It was arguably the most significant publication in logic since Aristotle.\n\nFormulario mathematico\n\n Giuseppe Peano (1895)\nFirst published in 1895, the Formulario mathematico was the first mathematical book written entirely in a formalized language. It contained a description of mathematical logic and many important theorems in other branches of mathematics. Many of the notations introduced in the book are now in common use.\n\nPrincipia Mathematica\n\n Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead (1910\u20131913)\nThe Principia Mathematica is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead and published in 1910\u20131913. It is an attempt to derive all mathematical truths from a well-defined set of axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. The questions remained whether a contradiction could be derived from the Principia's axioms, and whether there exists a mathematical statement which could neither be proven nor disproven in the system. These questions were settled, in a rather surprising way, by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem in 1931.\n\nSystems of Logic Based on Ordinals\n\n Alan Turing's Ph.D. thesis\n\n\"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme, I\"\n\n(On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems)\n  Kurt G\u00f6del (1931)\nOnline version: Online version\n\nIn mathematical logic, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems are two celebrated theorems proved by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1931.\nThe first incompleteness theorem states:\n\nFor any formal system such that (1) it is -consistent (omega-consistent), (2) it has a recursively definable set of axioms and rules of derivation, and (3) every recursive relation of natural numbers is definable in it, there exists a formula of the system such that, according to the intended interpretation of the system, it expresses a truth about natural numbers and yet it is not a theorem of the system.\n\nCombinatorics\n\n\"On sets of integers containing no k elements in arithmetic progression\"\n\nEndre Szemer\u00e9di (1975)\nSettled a conjecture of Paul Erd\u0151s and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n (now known as Szemer\u00e9di's theorem) that if a sequence of natural numbers has positive upper density then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  Szemer\u00e9di's solution has been described as a \"masterpiece of combinatorics\" and it introduced new ideas and tools to the field including a weak form of the Szemer\u00e9di regularity lemma.\n\nGraph theory\n\nSolutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis\n\n Leonhard Euler (1741)\n Euler's original publication (in Latin)\nEuler's solution of the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem in Solutio problematis ad geometriam situs pertinentis (The solution of a problem relating to the geometry of position) is considered to be the first theorem of graph theory.\n\n\"On the evolution of random graphs\"\n\nPaul Erd\u0151s and Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi (1960)\nProvides a detailed discussion of sparse random graphs, including distribution of components, occurrence of small subgraphs, and phase transitions.\n\n\"Network Flows and General Matchings\"\n\n L.

This work contained the method for finding optimal solutions for two-person zero-sum games.\n\n\"Equilibrium Points in N-person Games\"\n\n \nNash equilibrium\n\nOn Numbers and Games\n\nJohn Horton Conway\nThe book is in two, {0,1|}, parts. The zeroth part is about numbers, the first part about games \u2013 both the values of games and also some real games that can be played such as Nim, Hackenbush, Col and Snort amongst the  many described.\n\nWinning Ways for your Mathematical Plays\n\nElwyn Berlekamp, John Conway and Richard K. Guy\nA compendium of information on mathematical games.  It was first published in 1982 in two volumes, one focusing on Combinatorial game theory and surreal numbers, and the other concentrating on a number of specific games.\n\nFractals\n\nHow Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension\n\nBeno\u00eet Mandelbrot\nA discussion of self-similar curves that have fractional dimensions between 1 and 2. These curves are examples of fractals, although Mandelbrot does not use this term in the paper, as he did not coin it until 1975.\nShows Mandelbrot's early thinking on fractals, and is an example of the linking of mathematical objects with natural forms that was a theme of much of his later work.\n\nNumerical analysis\n\nOptimization\n\nMethod of Fluxions\n\n Isaac Newton\nMethod of Fluxions was a book written by Isaac Newton. The book was completed in 1671, and published in 1736.  Within this book, Newton describes a method (the Newton\u2013Raphson method) for finding the real zeroes of a function.\n\nEssai d'une nouvelle m\u00e9thode pour d\u00e9terminer les maxima et les minima des formules int\u00e9grales ind\u00e9finies\n\n Joseph Louis Lagrange (1761)\nMajor early work on the calculus of variations, building upon some of Lagrange's prior investigations as well as those of Euler.

Wolfe\n Operations Research 8:101\u2013111, 1960.\nDantzig's is considered the father of linear programming in the western world. He independently invented the simplex algorithm. Dantzig and Wolfe worked on decomposition algorithms for large-scale linear programs in factory and production planning.\n\n\"How Good is the Simplex Algorithm?\"\n\n Victor Klee and George J.

This was the first polynomial time algorithm for linear programming.\n\nEarly manuscripts\n\nThese are publications that are not necessarily relevant to a mathematician nowadays, but are nonetheless important publications in the history of mathematics.\n\nRhind Mathematical Papyrus\n\n Ahmes (scribe)\n\nOne of the oldest mathematical texts, dating to the Second Intermediate Period of ancient Egypt. It was copied by the scribe Ahmes (properly Ahmose) from an older Middle Kingdom papyrus. It laid the foundations of Egyptian mathematics and in turn, later influenced Greek and Hellenistic mathematics. Besides describing how to obtain an approximation of \u03c0 only missing the mark by less than one per cent, it is describes one of the earliest attempts at squaring the circle and in the process provides persuasive evidence against the theory that the Egyptians deliberately built their pyramids to enshrine the value of \u03c0 in the proportions. Even though it would be a strong overstatement to suggest that the papyrus represents even rudimentary attempts at analytical geometry, Ahmes did make use of a kind of an analogue of the cotangent.\n\nArchimedes Palimpsest\n\nArchimedes of Syracuse\nAlthough the only mathematical tools at its author's disposal were what we might now consider secondary-school geometry, he used those methods with rare brilliance, explicitly using infinitesimals to solve problems that would now be treated by integral calculus.  Among those problems were that of the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, that of the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and that of the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines.  For explicit details of the method used, see Archimedes' use of infinitesimals.\n\nThe Sand Reckoner\n\nArchimedes of Syracuse\n\nOnline version: Online version\n\nThe first known (European) system of number-naming that can be expanded beyond the needs of everyday life.\n\nTextbooks\n\nSynopsis of Pure Mathematics\n\n G. S. Carr\nContains over 6000 theorems of mathematics, assembled by George Shoobridge Carr for the purpose of training his students for the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams. Studied extensively by Ramanujan. (first half here)\n\n\u00c9l\u00e9ments de math\u00e9matique\n\n Nicolas Bourbaki\nOne of the most influential books in French mathematical literature. It introduces some of the notations and definitions that are now usual (the symbol \u2205 or the term bijective for example). Characterized by an extreme level of rigour, formalism and generality (up to the point of being highly criticized for that), its publication started in 1939 and is still unfinished today.\n\nArithmetick: or, The Grounde of Arts\n\n Robert Recorde\nWritten in 1542, it was the first really popular arithmetic book written in the English Language.\n\nCocker's Arithmetick\n\n Edward Cocker (authorship disputed)\nTextbook of arithmetic published in 1678 by John Hawkins, who claimed to have edited manuscripts left by Edward Cocker, who had died in 1676.  This influential mathematics textbook used to teach arithmetic in schools in the United Kingdom for over 150 years.\n\nThe Schoolmaster's Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic both Practical and Theoretical\n\n Thomas Dilworth\nAn early and popular English arithmetic textbook published in America in the 18th century. The book reached from the introductory topics to the advanced in five sections.\n\nGeometry\n\nAndrei Kiselyov\nPublication data: 1892\n\nThe most widely used and influential textbook in Russian mathematics. (See Kiselyov page and MAA review.)\n\nA Course of Pure Mathematics\n\n G. H. Hardy\n\nA classic textbook in introductory mathematical analysis, written by G. H. Hardy. It was first published in 1908, and went through many editions. It was intended to help reform mathematics teaching in the UK, and more specifically in the University of Cambridge, and in schools preparing pupils to study mathematics at Cambridge.  As such, it was aimed directly at \"scholarship level\" students \u2014 the top 10% to 20% by ability. The book contains a large number of difficult problems. The content covers introductory calculus and the theory of infinite series.\n\nModerne Algebra\n\n B. L. van der Waerden\nThe first introductory textbook (graduate level) expounding the abstract approach to algebra developed by Emil Artin and Emmy Noether.  First published in German in 1931 by Springer Verlag.  A later English translation was published in 1949 by Frederick Ungar Publishing Company.\n\nAlgebra\n\n Saunders Mac Lane and Garrett Birkhoff\nA definitive introductory text for abstract algebra using a category theoretic approach. Both a rigorous introduction from first principles, and a reasonably comprehensive survey of the field.\n\nCalculus, Vol. 1\n\n Tom M. Apostol\n\nAlgebraic Geometry\n\n Robin Hartshorne\nThe first comprehensive introductory (graduate level) text in algebraic geometry that used the language of schemes and cohomology.  Published in 1977, it lacks aspects of the scheme language which are nowadays considered central, like the functor of points.\n\nNaive Set Theory\n\n Paul Halmos\nAn undergraduate introduction to not-very-naive set theory which has lasted for decades.  It is still considered by many to be the best introduction to set theory for beginners.  While the title states that it is naive, which is usually taken to mean without axioms, the book does introduce all the axioms of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and gives correct and rigorous definitions for basic objects.  Where it differs from a \"true\" axiomatic set theory book is its character: There are no long-winded discussions of axiomatic minutiae, and there is next to nothing about topics like large cardinals.  Instead it aims, and succeeds, in being intelligible to someone who has never thought about set theory before.\n\nCardinal and Ordinal Numbers\n\n Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski\nThe nec plus ultra reference for basic facts about cardinal and ordinal numbers.  If you have a question about the cardinality of sets occurring in everyday mathematics, the first place to look is this book, first published in the early 1950s but based on the author's lectures on the subject over the preceding 40 years.\n\nSet Theory: An Introduction to Independence Proofs\n\n Kenneth Kunen\nThis book is not really for beginners, but graduate students with some minimal experience in set theory and formal logic will find it a valuable self-teaching tool, particularly in regard to forcing. It is far easier to read than a true reference work such as Jech, Set Theory. It may be the best textbook from which to learn forcing, though it has the disadvantage that the exposition of forcing relies somewhat on the earlier presentation of Martin's axiom.\n\nTopologie\n\n Pavel Sergeevich Alexandrov\n Heinz Hopf\nFirst published round 1935, this text was a pioneering \"reference\" text book in topology, already incorporating many modern concepts from set-theoretic topology, homological algebra and homotopy theory.\n\nGeneral Topology\n\n John L. Kelley\nFirst published in 1955, for many years the only introductory graduate level textbook in the US, teaching the basics of point set, as opposed to algebraic, topology. Prior to this the material, essential for advanced study in many fields, was only available in bits and pieces from texts on other topics or journal articles.\n\nTopology from the Differentiable Viewpoint\n\n John Milnor\nThis short book introduces the main concepts of differential topology in Milnor's lucid and concise style.  While the book does not cover very much, its topics are explained beautifully in a way that illuminates all their details.\n\nNumber Theory, An approach through history from Hammurapi to Legendre\n\n Andr\u00e9 Weil\nAn historical study of number theory, written by one of the 20th century's greatest researchers in the field.  The book covers some thirty six centuries of arithmetical work but the bulk of it is devoted to a detailed study and exposition of the work of Fermat, Euler, Lagrange, and Legendre.  The author wishes to take the reader into the workshop of his subjects to share their successes and failures. A rare opportunity to see the historical development of a subject through the mind of one of its greatest practitioners.\n\nAn Introduction to the Theory of Numbers\n\n G. H. Hardy and E. M. Wright\nAn Introduction to the Theory of Numbers was first published in 1938, and is still in print, with the latest edition being the 6th (2008). It is likely that almost every serious student and researcher into number theory has consulted this book, and probably has it on their bookshelf. It was not intended to be a textbook, and is rather an introduction to a wide range of differing areas of number theory which would now almost certainly be covered in separate volumes. The writing style has long been regarded as exemplary, and the approach gives insight into a variety of areas without requiring much more than a good grounding in algebra, calculus and complex numbers.\n\nFoundations of Differential Geometry\n\nShoshichi Kobayashi and Katsumi Nomizu\n\nHodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I\n\nHodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II\n\n Claire Voisin\n\nPopular writings\n\nG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\n\n Douglas Hofstadter\nG\u00f6del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, first published in 1979 by Basic Books.\nIt is a book about how the creative achievements of logician Kurt G\u00f6del, artist M. C. Escher and composer Johann Sebastian Bach interweave. As the author states: \"I realized that to me, G\u00f6del and Escher and Bach were only shadows cast in different directions by some central solid essence. I tried to reconstruct the central object, and came up with this book.\"\n\nThe World of Mathematics\n\n  James R. Newman\nThe World of Mathematics was specially designed to make mathematics more accessible to the inexperienced. It comprises nontechnical essays on every aspect of the vast subject, including articles by and about scores of eminent mathematicians, as well as literary figures, economists, biologists, and many other eminent thinkers. Includes the work of Archimedes, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, Gregor Mendel, Edmund Halley, Jonathan Swift, John Maynard Keynes, Henri Poincar\u00e9, Lewis Carroll, George Boole, Bertrand Russell, Alfred North Whitehead, John von Neumann, and many others. In addition, an informative commentary by distinguished scholar James R. Newman precedes each essay or group of essays, explaining their relevance and context in the history and development of mathematics. Originally published in 1956, it does not include many of the exciting discoveries of the later years of the 20th century but it has no equal as a general historical survey of important topics and applications.\n\n References \n\n \n \nPublications\nMathematics"}

{"title": "Logical atomism", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_atomism", "text": "Logical atomism is a philosophy that originated in the early 20th century with the development of analytic philosophy. Its principal exponent was the British philosopher Bertrand Russell. It is also widely held that the early work (the Tractatus and pre-Tractatus writings) of his Austrian-born pupil and colleague, Ludwig Wittgenstein, defend a version of logical atomism. Some philosophers in the Vienna Circle were also influenced by logical atomis (particularly Rudolf Carnap, who was deeply sympathetic to some of its philosophical aims, especially in his earlier works).Carnap, R. (1934), \"On the Character of Philosophic Problems (\u00dcber den Charakter der philosophischen Probleme),\" translation by W. M. Malisoff, Philosophy of Science, 1, pp. 5\u201319. Gustav Bergmann also developed a form of logical atomism that focused on an ideal phenomalistic language, particularly in his discussions of J.O. Urmson's work on analysis.\n\nThe name for this kind of theory was coined in March 1911 by Russell, in a work published in French titled \"Le R\u00e9alisme analytique\" (published in translation as \"Analytic Realism\" in Volume 6 of The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell). Russell was developing and responding to what he called \"logical holism\"\u2014i.e., the belief that the world operates in such a way that no part can be known without the whole being known first. This belief is commonly called monism, and Russell (and G.\u00a0E. Moore) criticized the absolute idealism dominant then in Britain and exemplified in works of F. H. Bradley and J. M. E. McTaggart. Logical atomism is partly understood as a developed alternative to logical holism, or the \"monistic logic\" of Idealists, on which logical analysis is a kind of falsification.\n\nThe theory holds that the world consists of ultimate logical \"facts\" (or \"atoms\") that cannot be broken down any further, each of which can be understood independently of other facts. Having originally propounded this stance in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein rejected it in his later Philosophical Investigations (\u00a7\u00a746\u201349, \u00a781, \u00a791).\n\n Origin \n\nAs mentioned above, the term \"logical atomism\" was first coined by Russell in 1911. However, since the paper in which it was first introduced was published only in French during Russell's lifetime, the view was not widely associated with Russell in the English-speaking world until Russell gave a series of lectures in early 1918 under the title \"The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\". These lectures were subsequently published in 1918 and 1919 in The Monist (Volumes 28 and 29), which at the time was edited by Phillip Jourdain. Russell's ideas as presented in 1918 were also influenced by Wittgenstein, as he explicitly acknowledges in his introductory note. This has partly contributed to the widely-held view that Wittgenstein was also a logical atomist, as has Wittgenstein's atomistic metaphysics developed in the Tractatus.\n\nHowever, logical atomism has older roots. Russell and Moore broke themselves free from British Idealism in the 1890s. And Russell's break developed along its own logical and mathematical path. His views on philosophy and its methods were heavily influenced by revolutionary nineteenth-century mathematics by figures like Cantor, Dedekind, Peano, and Weierstrass. As he says in his 1901 essay, republished in his 1917 collection Mysticism and Logic, and Other Essays under the title \"Mathematics and the Metaphysicians\":What is now required is to give the greatest possible development to mathematical logic, to allow to the full the importance of relations, and then to found upon this secure basis a new philosophical logic, which may hope to borrow some of the exactitude and certainty of its mathematical foundation. If this can be successfully accomplished, there is every reason to hope that the near future will be as great an epoch in pure philosophy as the immediate past has been in the principles of mathematics. Great triumphs inspire great hopes; and pure thought may achieve, within our generation, such results as will place our time, in this respect, on a level with the greatest age of Greece. (pg. 96)As we can see, Russell thought the revolutionary mathematical work could, through the development of logic, produce a similar revolution in philosophy. This ambition overlays the character of Russell's work from 1900 onward. Russell believes in fact that logical atomism, fully carried out and implemented throughout philosophy, is the realization of his 1901 ambition. As he says in the 1911 piece where he coins the phrase \"logical atomism\":The true method, in philosophy as in science, should be inductive, meticulous, respectful of detail, and should reject the belief that it is the duty of each philosophy to solve all problems by himself. It is this method which has inspired analytic realism [a.k.a. logical atomism], and it is the only method, if I am not mistaken, with which philosophy will succeed in obtaining results as solid as those obtained in science. (pg. 139)Logical atomism rightly makes logic central to philosophy. In doing so, it makes philosophy scientific, at least in Russell's view. As he says in his 1924 \"Logical Atomism\":The technical methods of mathematical logic, as developed in this book [Principia Mathematica], seem to me very powerful, and capable of providing a new instrument for the discussion of many problems that have hitherto remained subject to philosophical vagueness.In summary, Russell thought that a moral of the revolutionary work in mathematics was this: equally revolutionary work in philosophy could occur, if we only make logic the essence of philosophizing. This aspiration lies at the origin, and motivates and runs through, logical atomism.\n\n Principles \n\nRussell referred to his atomistic doctrine as contrary to the tier \"of the people who more or less follow Hegel\" (PLA 178).\n\nThe first principle of logical atomism is that the World contains \"facts\". The facts are complex structures consisting of objects (\"particulars\"). A fact may be that an object has a property or that it stands in some relation to other objects. In addition, there are judgments (\"beliefs\"), which are in a relationship to the facts, and by this relationship either true or false.\n\nAccording to this theory, even ordinary objects of daily life \"are apparently complex entities\". According to Russell, words like \"this\" and \"that\" are used to denote particulars. In contrast, ordinary names such as \"Socrates\" actually are definitive descriptions. In the analysis of \"Plato talks with his pupils\", \"Plato\" needs to be replaced with something like \"the man who was the teacher of Aristotle\".\n\nIn 1905, Russell had already criticized Alexius Meinong, whose theories led to the paradox of the simultaneous existence and non-existence of fictional objects. This theory of descriptions was crucial to logical atomism, as Russell believed that language mirrored reality.\n\n Russell's principles \n\nBertrand Russell's theory of logical atomism consists of three interworking parts: the atomic proposition, the atomic fact, and the atomic complex. An atomic proposition, also known as an elemental judgement, is a fundamental statement describing a single entity. Russell refers to this entity as an atomic fact, and recognizes a range of elements within each fact that he refers to as particulars and universals. A particular denotes a signifier such as a name, many of which may apply to a single atomic fact, while a universal lends quality to these particulars, e.g. color, shape, disposition. In Russell's Theory of Acquaintance, awareness of these particulars and universals comes through sense data. Every system consists of many atomic propositions and their corresponding atomic facts, known together as an atomic complex. In respect to the nomenclature that Russell used for his theory, these complexes are also known as molecular facts in that they possess many atoms. Rather than decoding the complex in a top-down manner, logical atomism analyzes its propositions individually before considering their collective effect. According to Russell, the atomic complex is a product of human thought and ideation that combines the various atomic facts in a logical manner.\n\nRussell's perspective on belief proved a point of contention between him and Wittgenstein, causing it to shift throughout his career. In logical atomism, belief is a complex that possesses both true and untrue propositions. Initially, Russell plotted belief as the special relationship between a subject and a complex proposition. Later, he amended this to say that belief lacks a proposition, and instead associates with universals and particulars directly. Here, the link between psychological experience \u2013 sense data \u2013 and components of logical atomism \u2013 universals and particulars \u2013 causes a breach in the typical logic of the theory; Russell's logical atomism is in some respects defined by the crossover of metaphysics and analytical philosophy, which characterizes the field of naturalized epistemology.\n\nIn his theory of Logical Atomism, Russell posited the highly controversial idea that for every positive fact exists a parallel negative fact: a fact that is untrue. The correspondence theory maintains that every atomic proposition coordinates with exactly one atomic fact, and that all atomic facts exist. The Theory of Acquaintance says that for any given statement taking the form of an atomic proposition, we must be familiar with the assertion it makes. For example, in the positive statement, \u201cthe leaf is green,\u201d we must be acquainted with the atomic fact that the leaf is green, and we know that this statement corresponds to exactly this one fact. Along this same line, the complementary negative statement, \u201cthe leaf is not green,\" is clearly false given what we know about the color of the leaf, but our ability to form a statement of this nature means that a corresponding fact must exist. Regardless of whether the second statement is or isn't true, the connection between its proposition and a fact must itself be true. One central doctrine of Logical Atomism, known as the Logically Perfect Language Principle, enables this conclusion. This principle establishes that everything exists as atomic proposition and fact, and that all language signifies reality.  In Russell's viewpoint, this necessitates the negative fact, whereas Wittgenstein maintained the more conventional Principle of Bivalence, in which the states \"P\" and \"Not (P)\" cannot coexist.\n\n Wittgenstein's principles \n\nIn his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Ludwig Wittgenstein explains his version of logical atomism as the relationship between proposition, state of affairs, object, and complex, often referred to as \u201cPicture theory\u201d. In view of Russell's version, the propositions are congruent in that they are both not convoluted statements about an atomic entity. Every atomic proposition is constructed from \u201cnames\u201d that correspond to \u201cobjects\u201d, and the interaction of these objects generate \u201cstates of affairs,\u201d which are analogous to what Russell called atomic facts. Where Russell identifies both particulars and universals, Wittgenstein amalgamates these into objects for the sake of protecting the truth-independence of his propositions; a self-contained state of affairs defines each proposition, and the truth of a proposition cannot be proven by the sharing or exclusion of objects between propositions. In Russell's work, his concept of universals and particulars denies truth-independence, as each universal accounts for a specific set of particulars, and the exact matching of any two sets implies equality, difference implies inequality, and this acts as a qualifier of truth. In Wittgenstein's theory, an atomic complex is a layered proposition subsuming many atomic propositions, each representing its own state of affairs.\n\nWittgenstein's handling of belief was dismissive and reflects his abstention from the epistemology that concerned Russell. Because his theory dealt with understanding the nature of reality, and because any item or process of the mind barring positive fact, i.e. something absolute and without interpretation, may become altered and thus divorced from reality, belief exists as a sign of reality but not reality itself. Wittgenstein was decidedly skeptical of epistemology, which tends to value unifying metaphysical ideas while depreciating the casewise and methodological inspection of philosophy that dominates his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Furthermore, Wittgenstein concerned himself with defining the exact correspondence between language and reality wherein any explanation of reality that defies or overburdens these semantic structures, namely metaphysics, becomes unhinged. Wittgenstein's work bears the exact philosophical determinants that he openly admonished, hence his later abandonment of this theory altogether.\n\n Differences between Russell's and Wittgenstein's atomism \n\nAt the time Russell delivered his lectures on logical atomism, he had lost contact with Wittgenstein.  After World War\u00a0I, Russell met with Wittgenstein again and helped him publish the Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Wittgenstein's own version of Logical Atomism.\n\nAlthough Wittgenstein did not use the expression Logical Atomism, the book espouses most of Russell's logical atomism except for Russell's Theory of Knowledge (T 5.4 and 5.5541). By 1918 Russell had moved away from this position. Nevertheless, the Tractatus differed so fundamentally from the philosophy of Russell that Wittgenstein always believed that Russell misunderstood the work.\n\nThe differences relate to many details, but the crucial difference is in a fundamentally different understanding of the task of philosophy. Wittgenstein believed that the task of philosophy was to clean up linguistic mistakes. Russell was ultimately concerned with establishing sound epistemological foundations. Epistemological questions such as how practical knowledge is possible did not interest Wittgenstein.  Wittgenstein investigated the \"limits of the world\" and later on meaning. For Wittgenstein, metaphysics and ethics were nonsensical, though he did not mean to devalue their importance in life by describing them in this way. Russell, on the other hand, believed that these subjects, particularly ethics, though belonging not to philosophy nor science and of possessing an inferior epistemological foundation, were of certain interest.\n\n Influence and decline \nThe immediate effect of the Tractatus was enormous, particularly by the reception it received by the Vienna Circle. However, it is now claimed by many contemporary analytic philosophers, that the Vienna Circle misunderstood certain sections of the Tractatus. The indirect effect of the method, however, was perhaps even greater long-term, especially on logical positivism. Wittgenstein eventually rejected the \"atomism\" of logical atomism in his posthumously published book, Philosophical Investigations, and it is debatable whether he ever held the wide-ranging version that Russell expounded in his 1918 logical atomism lectures. Russell, on the other hand, never abandoned logical atomism. In his 1959 My Philosophical Development, Russell said that his philosophy evolved and changed many times in his life, but he described all these changes as an \"evolution\" stemming from his original \"revolution\" into logical atomism in 1899-1900: There is one major division in my philosophical work: in the years 1899-1900, I adopted the philosophy of logical atomism and the technique of Peano in mathematical logic. This was so great a revolution as to make my previous work, except such as was purely mathematical, irrelevant to everything that I did later.

{"title": "Louis Couturat", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Couturat", "text": "Louis Couturat (; 17 January 1868 \u2013 3 August 1914) was a French logician, mathematician, philosopher, and linguist.\n\n Life and education \nBorn in Ris-Orangis, Essonne, France. In 1887 he entered \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure to study philosophy and mathematics. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the University of Toulouse and 1897 lectured in philosophy of mathematics at University of Caen Normandy, taking a stand in favor of transfinite numbers. After a time in Hanover studying the writings of Leibniz, he became an assistant to Henri-Louis Bergson at Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1905.\n\n Career \nHe was the French advocate of the symbolic logic that emerged in the years before World War I, thanks to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, Giuseppe Peano and his school, and especially to The Principles of Mathematics by Couturat's friend and correspondent Bertrand Russell. Like Russell, Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics. In this, he was opposed by Henri Poincar\u00e9, who took considerable exception to Couturat's efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the logicism of Russell, while Poincar\u00e9 anticipated Brouwer's intuitionism.\n\nHis first major publication was Couturat (1896). In 1901, he published La Logique de Leibniz, a detailed study of Leibniz the logician, based on his examination of the huge Leibniz Nachlass in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716, his Nachlass was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibniz's unpublished work on logic. In 1903, Couturat published much of that work in another large volume, his Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz, containing many of the documents he had examined while writing La Loqique. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate Aristotle from George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturat's editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell, also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz, and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship.\n\nIn 1905, Couturat published a work on logic and the foundations of mathematics (with an appendix on Kant's philosophy of mathematics) which was originally conceived as a translation of Russell's Principles of Mathematics.  In the same year, he published L'Alg\u00e8bre de la logique, a classic introduction to Boolean algebra and the works of C.S. Peirce and Ernst Schr\u00f6der.\n\nIn 1907, Couturat helped found the constructed language Ido, an offshoot of Esperanto, and was Ido's principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language, constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages, Couturat was paralleling Peano's advocacy of Interlingua. By pushing Ido, Couturat walked in Leibniz's footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the characteristica universalis.\n\nCouturat, a confirmed pacifist, was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the French Army, in the first stage of World War I.\n\nHe appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, A Curable Romantic.\n\nWorks\n\n 1896: De Platonicis mythis Thesim Facultati Litterarum Parisiensi proponebat Ludovicus Couturat, Scholae Normalae olim alumnus.

More precisely, in a category E with a terminal object 1, an NNO N is given by:\n\n a global element z : 1 \u2192 N, and\n an arrow s : N \u2192 N,\n\nsuch that for any object A of E, global element q : 1 \u2192 A, and arrow f : A \u2192 A, there exists a unique arrow u : N \u2192 A such that:\n\n u \u2218 z = q, and\n u \u2218 s = f \u2218 u.\n\nIn other words, the triangle and square in the following diagram commute.\n\n250px|A commutative diagram expressing the equations in the definition of an NNO\n\nThe pair (q, f) is sometimes called the recursion data for u, given in the form of a recursive definition:\n\n \u22a2 u (z) = q\n y \u2208E N \u22a2 u (s y) = f (u (y))\n\nThe above definition is the universal property of NNOs, meaning they are defined up to canonical isomorphism. If the arrow u as defined above merely has to exist, i.e. uniqueness is not required, then N is called a weak NNO.\n\n Equivalent definitions \n\nNNOs in cartesian closed categories (CCCs) or topoi are sometimes defined in the following equivalent way (due to Lawvere): for every pair of arrows g : A \u2192 B and f : B \u2192 B, there is a unique h : N \u00d7 A \u2192 B such that the squares in the following diagram commute.\n\nalternate NNO definition\n\nThis same construction defines weak NNOs in cartesian categories that are not cartesian closed.\n\nIn a category with a terminal object 1 and binary coproducts (denoted by +), an NNO can be defined as the initial algebra of the endofunctor that acts on objects by  and on arrows by .\n\n Properties \n\n Every NNO is an initial object of the category of diagrams of the form\n\n If a cartesian closed category has weak NNOs, then every slice of it also has a weak NNO.\n NNOs can be used for non-standard models of type theory in a way analogous to non-standard models of analysis. Such categories (or topoi) tend to have \"infinitely many\" non-standard natural numbers. (Like always, there are simple ways to get non-standard NNOs; for example, if z = s z, in which case the category or topos E is trivial.)\n Freyd showed that z and s form a coproduct diagram for NNOs; also, !N : N \u2192 1 is a coequalizer of s and 1N, i.e., every pair of global elements of N are connected by means of s; furthermore, this pair of facts characterize all NNOs.\n\n Examples \n\n In Set, the category of sets, the standard natural numbers are an NNO. A terminal object in Set is a singleton, and a function out of a singleton picks out a single element of a set. The natural numbers \ud835\udc0d are an NNO where  is a function from a singleton to \ud835\udc0d whose image is zero, and  is the successor function. (We could actually allow  to pick out any element of \ud835\udc0d, and the resulting NNO would be isomorphic to this one.) One can prove that the diagram in the definition commutes using mathematical induction.\n In the category of types of Martin-L\u00f6f type theory (with types as objects and functions as arrows), the standard natural numbers type nat is an NNO. One can use the recursor for nat to show that the appropriate diagram commutes.\n Assume that  is a Grothendieck topos with terminal object  and that  for some Grothendieck topology  on the category .

{"title": "New Latin", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin", "text": "New Latin (also called Neo-Latin or Modern Latin)\nwas a revival in the use of Latin in original, scholarly, and scientific works between  1375 and  1900. Modern scholarly and technical nomenclature, such as in zoological and botanical taxonomy and international scientific vocabulary, draws extensively from New Latin vocabulary. In such use, New Latin is subject to new word formation. As a language for full expression in prose or poetry, however, it is often distinguished from its successor, Contemporary Latin.\n\nExtent\nClassicists use the term \"Neo-Latin\" to describe the Latin that developed in Renaissance Italy as a result of renewed interest in classical civilization in the 14th and 15th centuries.\n\nNeo-Latin also describes the use of the Latin language for any purpose, scientific or literary, during and after the Renaissance.  The beginning of the period cannot be precisely identified; however, the spread of secular education, the acceptance of humanistic literary norms, and the wide availability of Latin texts following the invention of printing, mark the transition to a new era of scholarship at the end of the 15th century. The end of the New Latin period is likewise indeterminate, but Latin as a regular vehicle of communicating ideas became rare after the first few decades of the 19th century, and by 1900 it survived primarily in international scientific vocabulary and taxonomy. The term \"New Latin\" came into widespread use towards the end of the 1890s among linguists and scientists.\n\nNew Latin was, at least in its early days, an international language used throughout Catholic and Protestant Europe, as well as in the colonies of the major European powers. This area consisted of most of Europe, including Central Europe and Scandinavia; its southern border was the Mediterranean Sea, with the division more or less corresponding to the modern eastern borders of Finland, the Baltic states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia.\n\nRussia's acquisition of Kiev in the later 17th century introduced the study of Latin to Russia. Nevertheless, the use of Latin in Orthodox eastern Europe did not reach high levels due to their strong cultural links to the cultural heritage of Ancient Greece and Byzantium, as well as Greek and Old Church Slavonic languages.\n\nThough Latin and New Latin are considered extinct (having no native speakers), large parts of their vocabulary have seeped into English and several Germanic languages. In the case of English, about 60% of the lexicon can trace its origin to Latin, thus many English speakers can recognize New Latin terms with relative ease as cognates are quite common.\n\nHistory\n\nBeginnings\nNew Latin was inaugurated by the triumph of the humanist reform of Latin education, led by such writers as Erasmus, More, and Colet. Medieval Latin had been the practical working language of the Roman Catholic Church, taught throughout Europe to aspiring clerics and refined in the medieval universities.  It was a flexible language, full of neologisms and often composed without reference to the grammar or style of classical (usually pre-Christian) authors. The humanist reformers sought both to purify Latin grammar and style, and to make Latin applicable to concerns beyond the ecclesiastical, creating a body of Latin literature outside the bounds of the Church. Attempts at reforming Latin use occurred sporadically throughout the period, becoming most successful in the mid-to-late 19th century.\n\nHeight\nright|thumb|300px|Europe in 1648\nThe Protestant Reformation (1520\u20131580), though it removed Latin from the liturgies of the churches of Northern Europe, may have advanced the cause of the new secular Latin. The period during and after the Reformation, coinciding with the growth of printed literature, saw the growth of an immense body of New Latin literature, on all kinds of secular as well as religious subjects.\n\nThe heyday of New Latin was its first two centuries (1500\u20131700), when in the continuation of the Medieval Latin tradition, it served as the lingua franca of science, education, and to some degree diplomacy in Europe. Classic works such as Newton's Principia Mathematica (1687) were written in the language.  Throughout this period, Latin was a universal school subject, and indeed, the pre-eminent subject for elementary education in most of Europe and other places of the world that shared its culture.  All universities required Latin proficiency (obtained in local grammar schools) to obtain admittance as a student. Latin was an official language of Poland\u2014recognised and widely usedWho only knows Latin can go across the whole Poland from one side to the other one just like he was at his own home, just like he was born there.

As an auxiliary language to the local vernaculars, New Latin appeared in a wide variety of documents, ecclesiastical, legal, diplomatic, academic, and scientific.  While a text written in English, French, or Spanish at this time might be understood by a significant cross section of the learned, only a Latin text could be certain of finding someone to interpret it anywhere between Lisbon and Helsinki.\n\nAs late as the 1720s, Latin was still used conversationally, and was serviceable as an international auxiliary language between people of different countries who had no other language in common.  For instance, the Hanoverian king George I of Great Britain (reigned 1714\u20131727), who had no command of spoken English, communicated in Latin with his Prime Minister Robert Walpole,\"Before I conclude the reign of George the First, one remarkable fact must not be omitted: As the king could not readily speak English, nor Sir Robert Walpole French, the minister was obliged to deliver his sentiments in Latin; and as neither could converse in that language with readiness and propriety, Walpole was frequently heard to say, that during the reign of the first George, he governed the kingdom by means of bad latin.\" \"It was perhaps still more remarkable, and an instance unparalleled, that Sir Robert governed George the First in Latin, the King not speaking English, and his minister no German, nor even French. It was much talked of that Sir Robert, detecting one of the Hanoverian ministers in some trick or falsehood before the King's face, had the firmness to say to the German \"Mentiris impudissime!\" who knew neither German nor French.\n\nDecline\nBy about 1700, the growing movement for the use of national languages (already found earlier in literature and the Protestant religious movement) had reached academia, and an example of the transition is Newton's writing career, which began in New Latin and ended in English (e.g. Opticks, 1704). A much earlier example is Galileo c. 1600, some of whose scientific writings were in Latin, some in Italian, the latter to reach a wider audience. By contrast, while German philosopher Christian Wolff (1679\u20131754) popularized German as a language of scholarly instruction and research, and wrote some works in German, he continued to write primarily in Latin, so that his works could more easily reach an international audience (e.g., Philosophia moralis, 1750\u201353).\n\nLikewise, in the early 18th century, French replaced Latin as a diplomatic language, due to the commanding presence in Europe of the France of Louis XIV. At the same time, some (like King Frederick William I of Prussia) were dismissing Latin as a useless accomplishment, unfit for a man of practical affairs. The last international treaty to be written in Latin was the Treaty of Vienna in 1738; after the War of the Austrian Succession (1740\u201348) international diplomacy was conducted predominantly in French.\n\nA diminishing audience combined with diminishing production of Latin texts pushed Latin into a declining spiral from which it has not recovered. As it was gradually abandoned by various fields, and as less written material appeared in it, there was less of a practical reason for anyone to bother to learn Latin; as fewer people knew Latin, there was less reason for material to be written in the language.  Latin came to be viewed as esoteric, irrelevant, and too difficult.  As languages like French, German, and English became more widely known, use of a 'difficult' auxiliary language seemed unnecessary\u2014while the argument that Latin could expand readership beyond a single nation was fatally weakened if, in fact, Latin readers did not compose a majority of the intended audience.\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, the extensive literature in Latin being produced at the beginning slowly contracted. By 1800 Latin publications were far outnumbered, and often outclassed, by writings in the modern languages.  Latin literature lasted longest in very specific fields (e.g. botany and zoology) where it had acquired a technical character, and where a literature available only to a small number of learned individuals could remain viable. By the end of the 19th century, Latin in some instances functioned less as a language than as a code capable of concise and exact expression, as for instance in physicians' prescriptions, or in a botanist's description of a specimen.  In other fields (e.g. anatomy or law) where Latin had been widely used, it survived in technical phrases and terminology. The perpetuation of Ecclesiastical Latin in the Roman Catholic Church through the 20th century can be considered a special case of the technicalizing of Latin, and the narrowing of its use to an elite class of readers.\n\nBy 1900, creative Latin composition, for purely artistic purposes, had become rare.  Authors such as Arthur Rimbaud and Max Beerbohm wrote Latin verse, but these texts were either school exercises or occasional pieces.  The last survivals of New Latin to convey non-technical information appear in the use of Latin to cloak passages and expressions deemed too indecent (in the 19th century) to be read by children, the lower classes, or (most) women.  Such passages appear in translations of foreign texts and in works on folklore, anthropology, and psychology, e.g. Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis (1886).\n\nCrisis and transformation\n\nLatin as a language held a place of educational pre-eminence until the second half of the 19th century. At that point its value was increasingly questioned; in the 20th century, educational philosophies such as that of John Dewey dismissed its relevance.  At the same time, the philological study of Latin appeared to show that the traditional methods and materials for teaching Latin were dangerously out of date and ineffective.\n\nIn secular academic use, however, New Latin declined sharply and then continuously after about 1700.  Although Latin texts continued to be written throughout the 18th and into the 19th century, their number and their scope diminished over time. By 1900, very few new texts were being created in Latin for practical purposes, and the production of Latin texts had become little more than a hobby for Latin enthusiasts.\n\nAround the beginning of the 19th century came a renewed emphasis on the study of Classical Latin as the spoken language of the Romans of the 1st centuries BC and AD. This new emphasis, similar to that of the Humanists but based on broader linguistic, historical, and critical studies of Latin literature, led to the exclusion of Neo-Latin literature from academic studies in schools and universities (except for advanced historical language studies); to the abandonment of New Latin neologisms; and to an increasing interest in the reconstructed Classical pronunciation, which displaced the several regional pronunciations in Europe in the early 20th century.\n\nCoincident with these changes in Latin instruction, and to some degree motivating them, came a concern about lack of Latin proficiency among students.  Latin had already lost its privileged role as the core subject of elementary instruction; and as education spread to the middle and lower classes, it tended to be dropped altogether. By the mid-20th century, even the trivial acquaintance with Latin typical of the 19th-century student was a thing of the past.\n\nRelics\nthumb|This pocket watch made for the medical community has Latin instructions for measuring a patient's pulse rate on its dial: enumeras ad XX pulsus, \"you count to 20 beats\".\nEcclesiastical Latin, the form of New Latin used in the Roman Catholic Church, remained in use throughout the period and after. Until the Second Vatican Council of 1962\u201365 all priests were expected to have competency in it, and it was studied in Catholic schools. It is today still the official language of the Church, and all Catholic priests of the Latin liturgical rites are required by canon law to have competency in the language.This requirement is found under canon 249 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law. See  Use of Latin in the Mass, largely abandoned through the later 20th century, has recently seen a resurgence, due in large part to Pope Benedict XVI's motu proprio Summorum Pontificum and its use by traditional Catholic priests and their organizations.\n\nNew Latin is also the source of the biological system of binomial nomenclature and classification of living organisms devised by Carolus Linn\u00e6us, although the rules of the ICZN allow the construction of names that deviate considerably from historical norms. (See also classical compounds.) Another continuation is the use of Latin names for the surface features of planets and planetary satellites (planetary nomenclature), originated in the mid-17th century for selenographic toponyms.  New Latin has also contributed a vocabulary for specialized fields such as anatomy and law; some of these words have become part of the normal, non-technical vocabulary of various European languages.\n\nPronunciation\n\nNew Latin had no single pronunciation, but a host of local variants or dialects, all distinct both from each other and from the historical pronunciation of Latin at the time of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire.  As a rule, the local pronunciation of Latin used sounds identical to those of the dominant local language; the result of a concurrently evolving pronunciation in the living languages and the corresponding spoken dialects of Latin. Despite this variation, there are some common characteristics to nearly all of the dialects of New Latin, for instance:\n The use of a sibilant fricative or affricate in place of a stop for the letters c and sometimes g, when preceding a front vowel.\n The use of a sibilant fricative or affricate for the letter t when not at the beginning of the first syllable and preceding an unstressed i followed by a vowel.\n The use of a labiodental fricative for most instances of the letter v (or consonantal u), instead of the classical labiovelar approximant .\n A tendency for medial s to be voiced to , especially between vowels.\n The merger of \u00e6 and \u0153 with e, and of y with i.\n The loss of the distinction between short and long vowels, with such vowel distinctions as remain being dependent upon word-stress.\n\nThe regional dialects of New Latin can be grouped into families, according to the extent to which they share common traits of pronunciation.  The major division is between Western and Eastern family of New Latin. The Western family includes most Romance-speaking regions (France, Spain, Portugal, Italy) and the British Isles; the Eastern family includes Central Europe (Germany and Poland), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) and Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden).\n\nThe Western family is characterized, inter alia, by having a front variant of the letter g before the vowels \u00e6, e, i, \u0153, y and also pronouncing j in the same way (except in Italy).  In the Eastern Latin family, j is always pronounced , and g had the same sound (usually ) in front of both front and back vowels; exceptions developed later in some Scandinavian countries.\n\nThe following table illustrates some of the variation of New Latin consonants found in various countries of Europe, compared to the Classical Latin pronunciation of the 1st centuries BC-AD.  In Eastern Europe, the pronunciation of Latin was generally similar to that shown in the table below for German, but usually with  for z instead of .\n\nRoman letter PronunciationClassical Western Central  Eastern France  England  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Romania  Germany  Netherlands  Scandinavia cbefore \"\u00e6\", \"e\", \"i\", \"\u0153\", y                     ccbefore \"\u00e6\", \"e\", \"i\", \"\u0153\", \"y\"                     ch               ,      gbefore \"\u00e6\", \"e\", i\", \"\u0153\", \"y\"                   or    j           qubefore \"a\", \"o\", \"u\"                            qubefore \"\u00e6\", \"e\", \"i\"        sbetween vowels unless ss                       scbefore \"\u00e6\", \"e\", \"i\", \"\u0153\", \"y\"              , (earlier )       tbefore unstressed i+vowelexcept initiallyor after \"s\", \"t\", \"x\"                 v           ()       or      z                    \n\nOrthography\nNew Latin texts are primarily found in early printed editions, which present certain features of spelling and the use of diacritics distinct from the Latin of antiquity, medieval Latin manuscript conventions, and representations of Latin in modern printed editions.\n\nCharacters\nIn spelling, New Latin, in all but the earliest texts, distinguishes the letter u from v and i from j.  In older texts printed down to c. 1630, v was used in initial position (even when it represented a vowel, e.g. in vt, later printed ut) and u was used elsewhere, e.g. in nouus, later printed novus.  By the mid-17th century, the letter v was commonly used for the consonantal sound of Roman V, which in most pronunciations of Latin in the New Latin period was  (and not ), as in vulnus \"wound\", corvus \"crow\".  Where the pronunciation remained , as after g, q and s, the spelling u continued to be used for the consonant, e.g. in lingua, qualis, and suadeo.\n\nThe letter j generally represented a consonantal sound (pronounced in various ways in different European countries, e.g. , , , ).  It appeared, for instance, in jam \"already\" or jubet \"orders\" (earlier spelled iam and iubet).\nIt was also found between vowels in the words ejus, hujus, cujus (earlier spelled eius, huius, cuius), and pronounced as a consonant; likewise in such forms as major and pejor. J was also used when the last in a sequence of two or more i'''s, e.g. radij (now spelled radii) \"rays\", alijs \"to others\", iij, the Roman numeral 3; however, ij was for the most part replaced by ii by 1700.\n\nIn common with texts in other languages using the Roman alphabet, Latin texts down to c. 1800 used the letter-form \u017f (the long s) for s in positions other than at the end of a word; e.g. ip\u017fi\u017f\u017fimus.\n\nThe digraphs ae and oe were rarely so written (except when part of a word in all capitals, e.g. in titles, chapter headings, or captions) ; instead the ligatures \u00e6 and \u0153 were used, e.g. C\u00e6sar, p\u0153na. More rarely (and usually in 16th- to early 17th-century texts) the e caudata is found substituting for either.\n\nDiacritics\n\nThree kinds of diacritic were in common use: the acute accent \u00b4, the grave accent `, and the circumflex accent \u02c6.  These were normally only marked on vowels (e.g. \u00ed, \u00e8, \u00e2); but see below regarding que.\nthumb|right|200px|Handwriting in Latin from 1595\n\nThe acute accent marked a stressed syllable, but was usually confined to those where the stress was not in its normal position, as determined by vowel length and syllabic weight.  In practice, it was typically found on the vowel in the syllable immediately preceding a final clitic, particularly que \"and\", ve \"or\" and ne, a question marker; e.g. id\u00e9mque \"and the same (thing)\". Some printers, however, put this acute accent over the q in the enclitic que, e.g. eorumq\u0301ue \"and their\".  The acute accent fell out of favor by the 19th century.\n\nThe grave accent had various uses, none related to pronunciation or stress.  It was always found on the preposition \u00e0 (variant of ab \"by\" or \"from\") and likewise on the preposition \u00e8 (variant of ex \"from\" or \"out of\").  It might also be found on the interjection \u00f2 \"O\". Most frequently, it was found on the last (or only) syllable of various adverbs and conjunctions, particularly those that might be confused with prepositions or with inflected forms of nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  Examples include cert\u00e8 \"certainly\", ver\u00f2 \"but\", prim\u00f9m \"at first\", p\u00f2st \"afterwards\", c\u00f9m \"when\", ade\u00f2 \"so far, so much\", un\u00e0 \"together\", qu\u00e0m \"than\".  In some texts the grave was found over the clitics such as que, in which case the acute accent did not appear before them.\n\nThe circumflex accent represented metrical length (generally not distinctively pronounced in the New Latin period) and was chiefly found over an a representing an ablative singular case, e.g. e\u00e2dem form\u00e2 \"with the same shape\".  It might also be used to distinguish two words otherwise spelled identically, but distinct in vowel length; e.g. h\u00eec \"here\" differentiated from hic \"this\", fug\u00eare \"they have fled\" (=f\u016bg\u0113runt) distinguished from fugere \"to flee\", or senat\u00fbs \"of the senate\" distinct from senatus \"the senate\".  It might also be used for vowels arising from contraction, e.g. n\u00f4sti for novisti \"you know\", imper\u00e2sse for imperavisse \"to have commanded\", or d\u00ee for dei or dii.\n\nNotable works (1500\u20131900)\nthumb|right|150px|Erasmus by Holbein\n\nLiterature and biography\n 1511.

{"title": "Ordered geometry", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_geometry", "text": "Ordered geometry is a form of geometry featuring the concept of intermediacy (or \"betweenness\") but, like projective geometry, omitting the basic notion of measurement.  Ordered geometry is a fundamental geometry forming a common framework for affine, Euclidean, absolute, and hyperbolic geometry (but not for projective geometry).\n\nHistory\nMoritz Pasch first defined a geometry without reference to measurement in 1882.  His axioms were improved upon by Peano (1889), Hilbert (1899), and Veblen (1904).  Euclid anticipated Pasch's approach in definition 4 of The Elements:  \"a straight line is a line which lies evenly with the points on itself\".\n\nPrimitive concepts\nThe only primitive notions in ordered geometry are points A, B, C, ... and the ternary relation of intermediacy [ABC] which can be read as \"B is between A and C\".\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe segment AB is the set of points P such that [APB].\n\nThe interval AB is the segment AB and its end points A and B.\n\nThe ray A/B (read as \"the ray from A away from B\") is the set of points P such that [PAB].\n\nThe line AB is the interval AB and the two rays A/B and B/A.  Points on the line AB are said to be collinear.\n\nAn angle consists of a point O (the vertex) and two non-collinear rays out from O (the sides).\n\nA triangle is given by three non-collinear points (called vertices) and their three segments AB, BC, and CA.\n\nIf three points A, B, and C are non-collinear, then a plane ABC is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points on one or two of the sides of triangle ABC.\n\nIf four points A, B, C, and D are non-coplanar, then a space (3-space) ABCD is the set of all points collinear with pairs of points selected from any of the four faces (planar regions) of the tetrahedron ABCD.\n\nAxioms of ordered geometry\n There exist at least two points.\n If A and B are distinct points, there exists a C such that [ABC].\n If [ABC], then A and C are distinct (A\u2260C).\n If [ABC], then [CBA] but not [CAB].\n If C and D are distinct points on the line AB, then A is on the line CD.\n If AB is a line, there is a point C not on the line AB.\n (Axiom of Pasch) If ABC is a triangle and [BCD] and [CEA], then there exists a point F on the line DE for which [AFB].\n Axiom of dimensionality:\n For planar ordered geometry, all points are in one plane.  Or\n If ABC is a plane, then there exists a point D not in the plane ABC.\n All points are in the same plane, space, etc. (depending on the dimension one chooses to work within).\n (Dedekind's Axiom) For every partition of all the points on a line into two nonempty sets such that no point of either lies between two points of the other, there is a point of one set  which lies between every other point of that set  and every point of the other set.\n\nThese axioms are closely related to Hilbert's axioms of order. For a comprehensive survey of axiomatizations of ordered geometry see.\n\nResults\nSylvester's problem of collinear points\nThe Sylvester\u2013Gallai theorem can be proven within ordered geometry.\n\nParallelism\nGauss, Bolyai, and Lobachevsky developed a notion of parallelism which can be expressed in ordered geometry.\n\nTheorem (existence of parallelism): Given a point A and a line r, not through A, there exist exactly two limiting rays from A in the plane Ar which do not meet r.  So there is a parallel line through A which does not meet r.\n\nTheorem (transmissibility of parallelism): The parallelism of a ray and a line is preserved by adding or subtracting a segment from the beginning of a ray.\n\nThe symmetry of parallelism cannot be proven in ordered geometry. Therefore, the \"ordered\" concept of parallelism does not form an equivalence relation on lines.\n\nSee also\n Incidence geometry\n Euclidean geometry\n Hilbert's axioms\n Tarski's axioms\n Affine geometry\n Absolute geometry\n Non-Euclidean geometry\n Erlangen program\n Cyclic order\n Separation relation\n\nReferences\n\n*\nCategory:Order theory"}
{"title": "Outline of algebraic structures", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_algebraic_structures", "text": "In mathematics, there are many types of algebraic structures which are studied. Abstract algebra is primarily the study of specific algebraic structures and their properties. Algebraic structures may be viewed in different ways, however the common starting point of algebra texts is that an algebraic object incorporates one or more sets with one or more binary operations or unary operations satisfying a collection of axioms.\n\nAnother branch of mathematics known as universal algebra studies algebraic structures in general.   From the universal algebra viewpoint, most structures can be divided into varieties and quasivarieties depending on the axioms used. Some axiomatic formal systems that are neither varieties nor quasivarieties, called nonvarieties, are sometimes included among the algebraic structures by tradition.\n\nConcrete examples of each structure will be found in the articles listed.\n\nAlgebraic structures are so numerous today that this article will inevitably be incomplete. In addition to this, there are sometimes multiple names for the same structure, and sometimes one name will be defined by disagreeing axioms by different authors. Most structures appearing on this page will be common ones which most authors agree on. Other web lists of algebraic structures, organized more or less alphabetically, include Jipsen and PlanetMath. These lists mention many structures not included below, and may present more information about some structures than is presented here.\n\n Study of algebraic structures \n\nAlgebraic structures appear in most branches of mathematics, and one can encounter them in many different ways.\nBeginning study: In American universities, groups, vector spaces and fields are generally the first structures encountered in subjects such as linear algebra. They are usually introduced as sets with certain axioms.\nAdvanced study:\nAbstract algebra studies properties of specific algebraic structures.\nUniversal algebra studies algebraic structures abstractly, rather than specific types of structures. \nVarieties\nCategory theory studies interrelationships between different structures, algebraic and non-algebraic. To study a non-algebraic object, it is often useful to use category theory to relate the object to an algebraic structure. \nExample: The fundamental group of a topological space gives information about the topological space.\n\n Types of algebraic structures \n\nIn full generality, an algebraic structure may use any number of sets and any number of axioms in its definition. The most commonly studied structures, however, usually involve only one or two sets and one or two binary operations. The structures below are organized by how many sets are involved, and how many binary operations are used. Increased indentation is meant to indicate a more exotic structure, and the least indented levels are the most basic.\n\nOne binary operation on one set\n\nThe following structures consist of a set with a binary operation. The most common structure is that of a group. Other structures involve weakening or strengthening the axioms for groups, and may additionally use unary operations.\n\nGroups are key structures. Abelian groups are an important special type of group.\nsemigroups and monoids: These are like groups, except the operation need not have inverse elements.\nquasigroups and loops: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative.\nMagmas: These are like groups, except the operation need not be associative or have inverse elements.\nSemilattice: This is basically \"half\" of a lattice structure (see below).\n\nTwo binary operations on one set\nThe main types of structures with one set having two binary operations are rings and lattices. The axioms defining many of the other structures are modifications of the axioms for rings and lattices. One major difference between rings and lattices is that their two operations are related to each other in different ways. In ring-like structures, the two operations are linked by the distributive law; in lattice-like structures, the operations are linked by the absorption law.\n\nRings: The two operations are usually called addition and multiplication. Commutative rings are an especially important type of ring where the multiplication operation is commutative. Integral domains and fields are especially important types of commutative rings.\nNonassociative rings: These are like rings, but the multiplication operation need not be associative.\nLie rings and Jordan rings are special examples of nonassociative rings.\nsemirings: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not have inverses.\nnearrings: These are like rings, but the addition operation need not be commutative.\n*-rings: These are rings with an additional unary operation known as an involution.\nLattices: The two operations are usually called meet and join.\nLatticoid: meet and join commute but need not associate.\nSkew lattice: meet and join associate but need not commute.\n\nTwo binary operations and two sets\nThe following structures have the common feature of having two sets, A and B, so that there is a binary operation from A\u00d7A into A and another operation from A\u00d7B into A.\n\nVector spaces: The set A is an abelian group, and the set B is a field.\nGraded vector spaces: Vector spaces which are equipped with a direct sum decomposition into subspaces.\nModules: The set A is an abelian group, but the B is only a general ring and not necessarily a field.\nSpecial types of modules, including free modules, projective modules, injective modules and flat modules are studied in abstract algebra.\nGroup with operators: In this case, the set A is a group, and the set B is just a set.\n\nThree binary operations and two sets\nMany structures here are actually hybrid structures of the previously mentioned ones.\n\nAlgebra over a field: This is a ring which is also a vector space over a field. There are axioms governing the interaction of the two structures. Multiplication is usually assumed to be associative.\nAlgebra over a ring: These are defined the same way as algebras over fields, except that the field may now be any commutative ring.\nGraded algebra: These algebras are equipped with a decomposition into grades.\nNon-associative algebras: These are algebras for which the associativity of ring multiplication is relaxed. \nLie algebras and Jordan algebras are special examples of non-associative algebras.\nCoalgebra: This structure has axioms which make its multiplication dual to those of an associative algebra.\nBialgebra: These structures are simultaneously algebras and coalgebras whose operations are compatible. There are actually four operations for this structure.\n\nAlgebraic structures with additional non-algebraic structure\nThere are many examples of mathematical structures where algebraic structure exists alongside non-algebraic structure.\n\nTopological vector spaces are vector spaces with a compatible topology.\nLie groups: These are topological manifolds that also carry a compatible group structure.\nOrdered groups, ordered rings and ordered fields have algebraic structure compatible with an order on the set.\nVon Neumann algebras: these are *-algebras on a Hilbert space which are equipped with the weak operator topology.\n\nAlgebraic structures in different disciplines\nSome algebraic structures find uses in disciplines outside of abstract algebra. The following is meant to demonstrate some specific applications in other fields.\n\nIn Physics:\nLie groups are used extensively in physics. A few well-known ones include the orthogonal groups and the unitary groups.\nLie algebras\nInner product spaces\nKac\u2013Moody algebra\nThe quaternions and more generally geometric algebras\n\nIn Mathematical logic:\nBoolean algebras are both rings and lattices, under their two operations.\nHeyting algebras are a special example of boolean algebras.\nPeano arithmetic\nBoundary algebra\nMV-algebra\n\nIn Computer science:\nMax-plus algebra\nSyntactic monoid\nTransition monoid\n\nSee also\n\nAbstract algebra\nOutline of abstract algebra\nUniversal algebra\nVariety (universal algebra)\nLinear algebra\nOutline of linear algebra\nArity\nCategory theory\nFree object\nOperation (mathematics)\nSignature (logic)\nFirst-order theories\nMathematical lists\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nGarrett Birkhoff, 1967.

{"title": "Pathological (mathematics)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_%28mathematics%29", "text": "right|thumb|300px|The Weierstrass function is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.\nIn mathematics, a pathological phenomenon is one whose properties are considered atypically bad or counterintuitive; the opposite is well-behaved.\n\nIn analysis\nA classic example of a pathological structure is the Weierstrass function, which is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.  The sum of a differentiable function and the Weierstrass function is again continuous but nowhere differentiable; so there are at least as many such functions as differentiable functions. In fact, by the Baire category theorem one can show that continuous functions are generically nowhere differentiable.\n\nIn layman's terms, the majority of functions are nowhere differentiable, and relatively few can ever be described or studied. In general most useful functions also have some sort of physical basis or practical application, which means that they cannot be pathological at the level of hard mathematics or logic; absent certain limiting cases like the delta distribution, they tend to be quite well-behaved and intuitive. To quote Henri Poincar\u00e9:\n\nThis highlights the fact that the term pathological is subjective, context-dependent, and subject to wearing off. Its meaning in any particular case resides in the community of mathematicians, and not necessarily within mathematics itself. Also, the quotation shows how mathematics often progresses via counter-examples to what is thought intuitive or expected; for instance, the \"lack of derivatives\" mentioned is intimately connected with current study of magnetic reconnection events in solar plasma.\n\nIn topology\nOne of the most notorious pathologies in topology is the Alexander horned sphere, a counterexample showing that topologically embedding the sphere S2 in R3 may fail to separate the space cleanly. As a counter-example, it motivated the extra condition of tameness which suppresses the kind of wild behaviour the horned sphere exhibits.\n\nLike many other pathologies, the horned sphere in a sense plays on infinitely fine, recursively generated structure, which in the limit violates ordinary intuition. In this case the topology of an ever-descending chain of interlocking loops of continuous pieces of the sphere in the limit fully reflects that of the common sphere, and we'd expect the outside of it, after an embedding, to work the same. Yet it does not: it fails to be simply connected.\n\nFor the underlying theory, see Jordan\u2013Sch\u00f6nflies theorem.\n\n Well-behaved \n\nMathematicians (and those in related sciences) very frequently speak of whether a mathematical object\u2014a function, a set, a space of one sort or another\u2014is \"well-behaved\". The term has no fixed formal definition, and is dependent on context, mathematical interests, fashion, and taste. To ensure that an object is \"well-behaved\" mathematicians introduce further axioms to narrow down the domain of study. This has the benefit of making analysis easier, but cuts down on the generality of any conclusions reached. Concepts like non-Euclidean geometry were once considered ill-behaved, but are now common objects of study.\n\nIn both pure and applied mathematics (optimization, numerical integration, or mathematical physics, for example), well-behaved also means not violating any assumptions needed to successfully apply whatever analysis is being discussed.\n\nThe opposite case is usually labeled pathological. It is not unusual to have situations in which most cases (in terms of cardinality or measure) are pathological, but the pathological cases will not arise in practice unless constructed deliberately.\n\nThe term \"well-behaved\" is generally applied in an absolute sense\u2014either something is well-behaved or it is not. For example:\n\nIn algorithmic inference, a well-behaved statistic is monotonic, well-defined, and sufficient.\nIn B\u00e9zout's theorem, two polynomials are well-behaved, and thus the formula given by the theorem for the number of their intersections is valid, if their polynomial greatest common divisor is a constant.\nA meromorphic function is a ratio of two well-behaved functions, in the sense of those two functions being holomorphic.\nThe Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions are first-order necessary conditions for a solution in a well-behaved nonlinear programming problem to be optimal; a problem is referred to as well-behaved if some regularity conditions are satisfied.\nIn probability, events contained in the probability space's corresponding sigma-algebra are well-behaved, as are measurable functions.\n\nUnusually, the term could also be applied in a comparative sense:\n\nIn calculus:\nAnalytic functions are better-behaved than general smooth functions.\nSmooth functions are better-behaved than general differentiable functions.\nContinuous differentiable functions are better-behaved than general continuous functions. The larger the number of times the function can be differentiated, the more well-behaved it is.\nContinuous functions are better-behaved than Riemann-integrable functions on compact sets.\nRiemann-integrable functions are better-behaved than Lebesgue-integrable functions.\nLebesgue-integrable functions are better-behaved than general functions.\nIn topology, continuous functions are better-behaved than discontinuous ones.\nEuclidean space is better-behaved than non-Euclidean geometry.\nAttractive fixed points are better-behaved than repulsive fixed points.\nHausdorff topologies are better-behaved than those in arbitrary general topology.\nBorel sets are better-behaved than arbitrary sets of real numbers.\nSpaces with integer dimension are better-behaved than spaces with fractal dimension.\nIn abstract algebra:\nGroups are better-behaved than magmas and semigroups.\nAbelian groups are better-behaved than non-Abelian groups.\nFinitely-generated Abelian groups are better-behaved than non-finitely-generated Abelian groups.\nFinite-dimensional vector spaces are better-behaved than infinite-dimensional ones.\nFields are better-behaved than skew fields or general rings.\nSeparable field extensions are better-behaved than non-separable ones.\nNormed division algebras are better-behaved than general composition algebras.\n\nPathological examples\n\nPathological examples often have some undesirable or unusual properties that make it difficult to contain or explain within a theory. Such pathological behaviour often prompts new investigation which leads to new theory and more general results. For example, some important historical examples of this are the following:\n\nThe discovery of irrational numbers by the school of Pythagoras in ancient Greece; for example, the length of the diagonal of a unit square, that is .\nThe cardinality of the rational numbers is equal to the cardinality of the integers.\nSome number fields have rings of integers that do not form a unique factorization domain, for example the field .\nThe discovery of fractals and other \"rough\" geometric objects (see Hausdorff dimension).\nWeierstrass function, a real-valued function on the real line, that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.\nTest functions in real analysis and distribution theory, which are infinitely differentiable functions on the real line that are 0 everywhere outside of a given limited interval. An example of such a function is the test function,\n\n \n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the interval [0, 1] that has measure zero but is uncountable.\nThe Peano space-filling curve is a continuous surjective function that maps the unit interval [0, 1] onto [0, 1] \u00d7 [0, 1].\nThe Dirichlet function, which is the indicator function for rationals, is a bounded function that is not Riemann integrable. \nThe Cantor function is a monotonic continuous surjective function that maps [0,1] onto [0,1] but has zero derivative almost everywhere.\nSatisfaction classes containing \"intuitively false\" arithmetical statements can be constructed for countable, recursively saturated models of Peano arithmetic. \n\nAt the time of their discovery, each of these was considered highly pathological; today, each has been assimilated into modern mathematical theory. These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions; sometimes they may even necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts. Over the course of history, they have led to more correct, more precise, and more powerful mathematics. For example, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions. (The approximations converge almost everywhere and in the space of locally integrable functions.)\n\nWhether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition. Pathologies depend on context, training, and experience\u2014what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behaviour to another.\n\nPathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem.  For example, in statistics, the Cauchy distribution does not satisfy the central limit theorem, even though its symmetric bell-shape appears similar to many distributions which do; it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and are finite.\n\nSome of the best-known paradoxes such as the Banach\u2013Tarski paradox and Hausdorff paradox are based on the existence of non-measurable sets. Mathematicians, unless they take the minority position of denying the axiom of choice, are in general resigned to living with such sets.\n\nComputer science\nIn computer science, pathological has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be pathological if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. Quicksort normally has O(n log n) time complexity, but deteriorates to O(n2) when given input that triggers suboptimal behaviour.\n\nThe term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with Byzantine). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important as they can be exploited to mount a denial-of-service attack on a computer system.  Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses.  Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community, or other factors, an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the first test flight of the Ariane 5).\n\n Exceptions \n\nA similar but distinct phenomenon is that of exceptional objects (and exceptional isomorphisms), which occurs when there are a \"small\" number of exceptions to a general pattern\u2014quantitatively, a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule. By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological, as discussed in prevalence, above\u2014e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational.\n\nSubjectively, exceptional objects (such as the icosahedron or sporadic simple groups) are generally considered \"beautiful\", unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered \"ugly\", as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects \u2013 for example, the exceptional Lie algebras are included in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid. By contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out \u2013 for example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the Sch\u00f6nflies problem. One may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but will also in general study the narrower theory from which the original examples were drawn.\n\nExternal links \nPathological Structures & Fractals \u2013 Extract of an article by Freeman Dyson, \"Characterising Irregularity\", Science, May 1978\n\nCategory:Mathematical terminology"}
{"title": "Post's theorem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%27s_theorem", "text": "In computability theory Post's theorem, named after Emil Post, describes the connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees. \n\n Background \n\nThe statement of Post's theorem uses several concepts relating to definability and recursion theory.  This section gives a brief overview of these concepts, which are covered in depth in their respective articles. \n\nThe arithmetical hierarchy classifies certain sets of natural numbers that are definable in the language of Peano arithmetic.   A formula  is said to be  if it is an existential statement in prenex normal form (all quantifiers at the front) with  alternations between existential and universal quantifiers applied to a formula with bounded quantifiers only.  Formally a formula  in the language of Peano arithmetic is a  formula if it is of the form\n\nwhere  contains only bounded quantifiers and Q is  if m is even and  if m is odd.\n\nA set of natural numbers A is said to be  if it is definable by a  formula, that is, if there is a  formula  such that each number n is in A if and only if  holds.   It is known that if a set is  then it is  for any , but for each m there is a  set that is not .  Thus the number of quantifier alternations required to define a set gives a measure of the complexity of the set.\n\nPost's theorem uses the relativized arithmetical hierarchy as well as the unrelativized hierarchy just defined.   A set A of natural numbers is said to be  relative to a set B, written , if\nA is definable by a  formula in an extended language that includes a predicate for membership in B.\n\nWhile the arithmetical hierarchy measures definability of sets of natural numbers, Turing degrees measure the level of uncomputability of sets of natural numbers.    A set A is said to be Turing reducible to a set B, written , if there is an oracle Turing machine that, given an oracle for B, computes the characteristic function of A.\nThe Turing jump of a set A is a form of the Halting problem relative to A.  Given a set A,\nthe Turing jump  is the set of indices  of oracle Turing machines that halt on input 0 when run with oracle A.   It is known that every set A is Turing reducible to its Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set is never Turing reducible to the original set.  \n\nPost's theorem uses finitely iterated Turing jumps.  For any set A of natural numbers, the notation\n indicates the n-fold iterated Turing jump of A.  Thus  is just A, and  is the Turing jump of .\n\n Post's theorem and corollaries \n\nPost's theorem establishes a close connection between the arithmetical hierarchy and the Turing degrees of the form , that is, finitely iterated Turing jumps of the empty set.  (The empty set could be replaced with any other computable set without changing the truth of the theorem.)\n\nPost's theorem states:\nA set B is  if and only if  is recursively enumerable by an oracle Turing machine with an oracle for , that is, if and only if B is .\nThe set  is -complete for every .  This means that every  set is many-one reducible to . \n\nPost's theorem has many corollaries that expose additional relationships between the arithmetical\nhierarchy and the Turing degrees.  These include:\nFix a set C. A set B is  if and only if B is .  This is the relativization of the first part of Post's theorem to the oracle C.\nA set B is  if and only if . More generally, B is  if and only if .\nA set is defined to be arithmetical if it is  for some n.  Post's theorem shows that, equivalently, a set is arithmetical if and only if it is Turing reducible to  for some m.\n\n Proof of Post's theorem \nFormalization of Turing machines in first-order arithmetic\nThe operation of a Turing machine T on input n can be formalized logically in first-order arithmetic. For example, we may use symbols Ak, Bk and Ck for the tape configuration, machine state and location along the tape after k steps, respectively. T's transition system determines the relation between (Ak,Bk,Ck) and (Ak+1,Bk+1,Ck+1); their initial values (for k=0) are the input, the initial state and zero, respectively. The machine halts if and only if there is a number k such that Bk is the halting state.\n\nThe exact relation depends on the specific implementation of the notion of Turing machine (e.g. their alphabet, allowed mode of motion along the tape, etc.)\n\nIn case T halts at time n1, the relation between  (Ak,Bk,Ck) and (Ak+1,Bk+1,Ck+1) must be satisfied only for k bounded from above by n1.\n\nThus there is a formula  in first-order arithmetic with no unbounded quantifiers, such that T halts on input n at time n1 at most if and only if  is satisfied.\n\nImplementation example\nFor example, for a prefix-free Turing machine with binary alphabet and no blank symbol, we may use the following notations:\nAk is the 1-ary symbol for the configuration of the whole tape after k steps (which we may write as a number with LSB first, the value of the m-th location on the tape being its m-th LSB bit). In particular A0 is the initial configuration of the tape, which corresponds the input to the machine.\nBk is the 1-ary symbol for the Turing machine state after k steps. In particular B0 = qI, the initial state of the Turing machine.\nCk is the 1-ary symbol for the Turing machine location on the tape after k steps. In particular C0 = 0.\nM(q,b) is the transition function of the Turing machine, written as a function from a doublet (machine state, bit read by the machine) to a triplet (new machine state, bit written by the machine, +1 or -1 machine movement along the tape).\nbit(j ,m) is the j-th bit of a number m. This can be written as a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers.\n\nFor a prefix-free Turing machine we may use, for input n, the initial tape configuration  where cat stands for concatenation; thus t(n) is a log(n)-length string of 1-s followed by 0 and then by n. \n\nThe operation of the Turing machine at the first n1 steps can thus be written as the conjunction of the initial conditions and the following formulas, quantified over k for all k<n1:\n. Since M has a finite domain, this can be replaced by a first-order quantifier-free arithmetic formula. The exact formula obviously depends on M.\n \n. Note that at the first n1 steps, T never arrives at a location along the tape greater than n1. Thus the universal quantifier over j can be bounded by n1+1, as bits beyond this location have no relevance for the machine's operation.\n\nT halts on input n at time n1 at most if and only if  is satisfied, where:\n\nThis is a first-order arithmetic formula with no unbounded quantifiers, i.e. it is in .\n\nRecursively enumerable sets\nLet S be a set that can be recursively enumerated by a Turing machine. Then there is a Turing machine T that for every n in S, T halts when given n as an input.\n\nThis can be formalized by the first-order arithmetical formula presented above. The members of S are the numbers n satisfying the following formula:\n\nThis formula is in . Therefore, S is in .\nThus every recursively enumerable set is in . \n\nThe converse is true as well: for every formula  in  with k existential quantifiers, we may enumerate the k-tuples of natural numbers and run a Turing machine that goes through all of them until it finds the formula is satisfied. This Turing machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying , and thus enumerates its corresponding set.\n\nOracle machines\n\nSimilarly, the operation of an oracle machine T with an oracle O that halts after at most n1 steps on input n can be described by a first-order formula , except that the formula  now includes:\n A new predicate, Om, giving the oracle answer. This predicate must satisfy some formula to be discussed below.\n An additional tape - the oracle tape - on which T has to write the number m for every call O(m) to the oracle; writing on this tape can be logically formalized in a similar manner to writing on the machine's tape. Note that an oracle machine that halts after at most n1 steps has time to write at most n1 digits on the oracle tape. So the oracle can only be called with numbers m satisfying .\n\nIf the oracle is for a decision problem, Om is always \"Yes\" or \"No\", which we may formalize as 0 or 1. Suppose the decision problem itself can be formalized by a first-order arithmetic formula .\nThen T halts on n after at most n1 steps if and only if the following formula is satisfied:\n\nwhere  is a first-order formula with no unbounded quantifiers.\n\nTuring jump\n\nIf O is an oracle to the halting problem of a machine T', then  is the same as \"there exists m1 such that T' starting with input m is at the halting state after m1 steps\". \nThus:\n\nwhere  is a first-order formula that formalizes T'. If T' is a Turing machine (with no oracle),  is in  (i.e. it has no unbounded quantifiers).\n\nSince there is a finite number of numbers m satisfying , we may choose the same number of steps for all of them: there is a number m1, such that T' halts after m1 steps precisely on those inputs  for which it halts at all.\n\nMoving to prenex normal form, we get that the oracle machine halts on input n if and only if the following formula is satisfied:\n\n(informally, there is a \"maximal number of steps\" m1 such every oracle that does not halt within the first m1 steps does not stop at all; however, for every m2, each oracle that halts after m2 steps does halt).\n\nNote that we may replace both n1 and m1 by a single number - their maximum - without changing the truth value of . Thus we may write:\n\nFor the oracle to the halting problem over Turing machines,  is in  and  is in . Thus every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for , is in .\n\nThe converse is true as well: Suppose  is a formula in  with k1 existential quantifiers followed by k2 universal quantifiers. Equivalently,  has k1 existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in ; the latter formula can be enumerated by a Turing machine and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for .\n\nWe may thus enumerate the k1-tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for  that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying , and thus enumerates its corresponding set.\n\nHigher Turing jumps\n\nMore generally, suppose every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for  is in . Then for an oracle machine with an oracle for ,  is in .\n\nSince  is the same as  for the previous Turing jump, it can be constructed (as we have just done with  above) so that  in . After moving to prenex formal form the new  is in .\n\nBy induction, every set that is recursively enumerable by an oracle machine with an oracle for , is in .\n\nThe other direction can be proven by induction as well: Suppose every formula in  can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for .\n\nNow Suppose  is a formula in  with k1 existential quantifiers followed by k2 universal quantifiers etc. Equivalently,  has k1 existential quantifiers followed by a negation of a formula in ; the latter formula can be enumerated by an oracle machine with an oracle for  and can thus be checked immediately by an oracle for .\n\nWe may thus enumerate the k1-tuples of natural numbers and run an oracle machine with an oracle for  that goes through all of them until it finds a satisfaction for the formula. This oracle machine halts on precisely the set of natural numbers satisfying , and thus enumerates its corresponding set.\n\n References \n\nRogers, H.

{"title": "Proof complexity", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_complexity", "text": "In theoretical computer science, and specifically computational complexity theory, proof complexity is the field aiming to understand and analyse the computational resources that are required to prove or refute statements. Research in proof complexity is predominantly concerned with proving proof-length lower and upper bounds in various propositional proof systems. For example, among the major challenges of proof complexity is showing that the usual propositional-calculus does not admit polynomial-size proofs of all tautologies (the actual formalization of a propositional-calculus is immaterial here, since all natural formalizations have been proved to be polynomially-identical); here the size of the proof is simply the number of symbols in it, and a proof is said to be of polynomial size if it is polynomial in the size of the tautology it proves. \n\nSystematic study of proof complexity began with the work of Cook and Reckhow (1979) who provided the basic definition of a propositional proof system from the perspective of computational complexity. Specifically Cook and Reckhow  observed that proving proof size lower bounds on stronger and stronger propositional proof systems can be viewed as a step towards separating NP from coNP (and thus P from NP), since the existence of a propositional proof system that admits polynomial size proofs for all tautologies implies that NP=coNP.\n\nContemporary proof complexity research draws ideas and methods from many areas in computational complexity, algorithms and mathematics. Since many important algorithms and algorithmic techniques can be cast as proof search algorithms for certain proof systems, proving lower bounds on these proof sizes implies run time lower bounds on the corresponding algorithms.\n\nMathematical logic can also serve as a framework to study propositional proof sizes. Specifically weak fragments of Peano Arithmetic, which come under the name Bounded Arithmetic theories, serve as a uniform version of propositional proofs, corresponding to different propositional proof systems.\n\nPolynomiality of proofs\n\nDifferent propositional proof systems for propositional logic, such as the sequent calculus, the cutting-plane method, resolution, etc., may provide different proofs for the same formula. Proof complexity measures the efficiency of the proof system usually in terms of the minimal size of proofs possible in the system for a given tautology (or dually, and unsatisfiable formula).\n\nTwo points make the study of proof complexity non-trivial:\n\n the size of a proof depends on the formula that is to be proved inconsistent;\n proof methods are generally families of algorithms, as some of their steps are not univocally specified; for example, resolution is based on iteratively choosing a pair of clauses containing opposite literals and producing a new clause that is a consequence of them; since several such pairs may be available at each step, the algorithm has to choose one; these choices affect the proof length.\n\nThe first point is taken into account by comparing the size of a proof of a formula with the size of the formula. This comparison is made using the usual assumptions of computational complexity: first, a polynomial proof size/formula size ratio means that the proof is of size similar to that of the formula; second, this ratio is studied in the asymptotic case as the size of the formula increases.\n\nThe second point is taken into account by considering, for each formula, the shortest possible proof the considered method can produce.\n\nThe question of polynomiality of proofs is whether a method can always produce a proof of size polynomial in the size of the formula. If such a method exists, then NP would be equal to coNP: this is why the question of polynomiality of proofs is considered important in computational complexity. For some methods, the existence of formulae whose shortest proofs are always superpolynomial has been proved. For other methods, it is an open question.\n\nProof size comparison\n\nA second question about proof complexity is whether a method is more efficient than another. Since the proof size depends on the formula, it is possible that one method can produce a short proof of a formula and only long proofs of another formula, while a second method can have exactly the opposite behavior.  The assumptions of measuring the size of the proofs relative to the size of the formula and considering only the shortest proofs are also used in this context.\n\nWhen comparing two proof methods, two outcomes are possible:\n\n for every proof of a formula produced using the first method, there is a proof of comparable size of the same formula produced by the second method;\n there exists a formula such that the first method can produce a short proof while all proofs obtained by the second method are consistently larger.\n\nSeveral proofs of the second kind involve contradictory formulae expressing the negation of the pigeonhole principle, namely that  pigeons can fit  holes with no hole containing two or more pigeons.\n\nAutomatizability\n\nA proof method is automatizable if one of the shorter proofs of a formula can always be generated in time polynomial (or sub-exponential) in the size of the proof. Some methods, but not all, are automatizable. Automatizability results are  not in contrast with the assumption that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse, which would happen if generating a proof in time polynomial in the size of the formula were always possible.\n\nInterpolation\n\nConsider a tautology of the form .  The tautology is true for every choice of , and after fixing  the evaluation of  and  are independent because are defined on disjoint sets of variables.  This means that it is possible to define an interpolant circuit , such that both  and  hold.  The interpolant circuit decides either if  is false or if  is true, by only considering .  The nature of the interpolant circuit can be arbitrary.  Nevertheless, it is possible to use a proof of the initial tautology  as a hint on how to construct .  Some proof systems (e.g. resolution) are said to have efficient interpolation because the interpolant  is efficiently computable from any proof of the tautology  in such proof system.  The efficiency is measured with respect to the length of the proof: it is easier to compute interpolants for longer proofs, so this property seems to be anti-monotone in the strength of the proof system.\n\nInterpolation is a weak form of automatization: a way to deduce the existence of small circuits from the existence of small proofs.  In particular the following three statements cannot be simultaneously true: (a)  has a short proof in a some proof system; (b) such proof system has efficient interpolation; (c) the interpolant circuit solves a computationally hard problem.  It is clear that (a) and (b) imply that there is a small interpolant circuit, which is in contradiction with (c).  Such relation allows to turn proof length upper bounds into lower bounds on computations, and dually to turn efficient interpolation algorithms into lower bounds on proof length.\n\nNon-classical logics\n\nThe idea of comparing the size of proofs can be used for any automated reasoning procedure that generates a proof. Some research has been done about the size of proofs for propositional non-classical logics, in particular, intuitionistic, modal, and non-monotonic logics.\n\nSee also\n\n Computational complexity\nCircuit complexity \n Communication complexity \nmathematical logic \nproof theory \nComplexity classes \nNP (complexity)  \ncoNP\n\nReferences\n\n (draft from 2008)\n\n Kraj\u00ed\u010dek, Jan, Proof Complexity, Cambridge University Press, in press.\n\nExternal links\n Proof Complexity\n Proof complexity mailing list.\n\nCategory:Computational complexity theory\nCategory:Logic in computer science\nCategory:Automated theorem proving"}
{"title": "Revision theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_theory", "text": "Revision theory is a subfield of philosophical logic. It consists of a general theory of definitions, including (but not limited to) circular and interdependent concepts. A circular definition is one in which the concept being defined occurs in the statement defining it\u2014for example, defining a G as being blue and to the left of a G. Revision theory provides formal semantics for defined expressions, and formal proof systems study the logic of circular expressions.\n\nDefinitions are important in philosophy and logic. Although circular definitions have been regarded as logically incorrect or incoherent, revision theory demonstrates that they are meaningful and can be studied with mathematical and philosophical logic. It has been used to provide circular analyses of philosophical and logical concepts.\n\nHistory\nRevision theory is a generalization of the revision theories of truth developed Anil Gupta, Hans Herzberger, and Nuel Belnap.See, respectively, Gupta (1982), Herzberger (1982), and Belnap (1982). In the revision theories of Gupta and Herzberger, revision is supposed to reflect intuitive evaluations of sentences that use the truth predicate. Some sentences are stable in their evaluations, such as the truth-teller sentence,\nThe truth-teller is true.\nAssuming the truth-teller is true, it is true, and assuming that it is false, it is false. Neither status will change. On the other hand, some sentences oscillate, such as the liar,\nThe liar sentence is not true.\nOn the assumption that the liar is true, one can show that it is false, and on the assumption that it is false, one can show that it is true. This instability is reflected in revision sequences for the liar.\n\nThe generalization to circular definitions was developed by Gupta, in collaboration with Belnap. Their book, The Revision Theory of Truth, presents an in-depth development of the theory of circular definitions, as well as an overview and critical discussion of philosophical views on truth and the relation between truth and definition.\n\nPhilosophical background\nThe philosophical background of revision theory is developed by Gupta and Belnap.Gupta and Belnap (1993)\nOther philosophers, such as Aladdin Yaq\u016bb, have developed philosophical interpretations of revision theory in the context of theories of truth, but not in the general context of circular definitions.Yaq\u016bb (1993)\n\nGupta and Belnap maintain that circular concepts are meaningful and logically acceptable. Circular definitions are formally tractable, as demonstrated by the formal semantics of revision theory. As Gupta and Belnap put it, \"the moral we draw from the paradoxes is that the domain of the meaningful is more extensive than it appears to be, that certain seemingly meaningless concepts are in fact meaningful.\"Gupta and Belnap (1993, 278)\n\nThe meaning of a circular predicate is not an extension, as is often assigned to non-circular predicates. Its meaning, rather, is a rule of revision that determines how to generate a new hypothetical extension given an initial one. These new extensions are at least as good as the originals, in the sense that, given one extension, the new extension contains exactly the things that satisfy the definiens for a particular circular predicate. In general, there is no unique extension on which revision will settle.This point is discussed further by Gupta and Belnap (1993, 121), Shapiro (2006), and Gupta (2011, 160-161).\n\nRevision theory offers an alternative to the standard theory of definitions. The standard theory maintains that good definitions have two features. First, defined symbols can always be eliminated, replaced by what defines them. Second, definitions should be conservative in the sense that adding a definition should not result in new consequences in the original language. Revision theory rejects the first but maintains the second, as demonstrated for both of the strong senses of validity presented below.\n\nThe logician Alfred Tarski presented two criteria for evaluating definitions as analyses of concepts: formal correctness and material adequacy. The criterion of formal correctness states that in a definition, the definiendum must not occur in the definiens. The criterion of material adequacy says that the definition must be faithful to the concept being analyzed. Gupta and Belnap recommend siding with material adequacy in cases in which the two criteria conflict.Gupta and Belnap (1993, 277) To determine whether a circular definition provides a good analysis of a concept requires evaluating the material adequacy of the definition. Some circular definitions will be good analyses, while some will not. Either way, formal correctness, in Tarski's sense, will be violated.\n\nSemantics for circular predicates\nThe central semantic idea of revision theory is that a definition, such as that of being a , provides a  rule of revision that tells one what the new extension for the definiendum  should be, given a hypothetical extension of the definiendum and information concerning the undefined expressions. Repeated application of a rule of revision generates sequences of hypotheses, which can be used to define logics of circular concepts. In work on revision theory, it is common to use the  symbol, , to indicate a definition, with the left-hand side being the definiendum and the right-hand side the definiens.\nThe example\n\n Being a  is defined as being both blue and to the left of a \n\ncan then be written as\n\n Being a  being both blue and to the left of a .\n\nGiven a hypothesis about the extension of , one can obtain a new extension for  appealing to the meaning of the undefined expressions in the definition, namely blue and to the left of.\n\nWe begin with a ground language, , that is interpreted via a classical ground model , which is a pair of a domain  and an interpretation function .This section is based on Gupta and Belnap (1993). Suppose that the set of definitions  is the following,\n\n \n\nwhere each  is a formula that may contain any of the definienda , including  itself. It is required that in the definitions, only the displayed variables, , are free in the definientia, the formulas . The language  is expanded with these new predicates, , to form +. When the set  contains few defined predicates, it is common to use the notation,  to emphasize that  may contain .\n\nA hypothesis  is a function from the definienda of  to tuples of . The model  is just like the model  except that  interprets each definiendum according to the following biconditional, the left-hand side of which is read as \u201c is true in .\u201d\n\n \n\nThe set   of definitions yields a rule of revision, or revision operator, . Revision operators obey the following equivalence for each definiendum, , in .\n\n \n\nA tuple will satisfy a definiendum  after revision just in case it satisfies the definiens for , namely , prior to revision. This is to say that the tuples that satisfy  according to a hypothesis will be exactly those that satisfy  according to the revision of that hypothesis.\n\nThe classical connectives are evaluated in the usual, recursive way in . Only the evaluation of a defined predicate appeals to the hypotheses.\n\nSequences\nRevision sequences are sequences of hypotheses satisfying extra conditions.This section is based on Gupta and Belnap (1993) and Kremer (2014). We will focus here on sequences that are -long, since transfinite revision sequences require the additional specification of what to do at limit stages.\n\nLet  be a sequence of hypotheses, and let  be the -th hypothesis in . An -long sequence  of hypotheses is a revision sequence just in case for all ,\n\n \n\nRecursively define iteration as\n\n  and\n \n\nThe -long revision sequence starting from  can be written as follows.\n\n \n\nOne sense of validity,  validity, can be defined as follows. A sentence  is valid in  in  on  iff there exists an  such that for all  and for all , . A sentence  is valid on  just in case it is valid in all .\n\nValidity in  can be recast in terms of stability in -long sequences. A sentence  is stably true in a revision sequence just in case there is an  such that for all , . A sentence  is stably false in a revision sequence just in case there is an  such that for all , . In these terms, a sentence  is valid in  in  on  just in case  is stably true in all -long revision sequences on .\n\nExamples\nFor the first example, let  be  Let the domain of the ground model  be , and let  and . There are then four possible hypotheses for : , , , . The first few steps of the revision sequences starting from those hypotheses are illustrated by the following table.\n\n+ Sample revision for stage 0stage 1stage 2stage 3\n\nAs can be seen in the table,  goes in and out of the extension of . It never stabilizes. On the other hand,  either stays in or stays out. It is stable, but whether it is stably true or stably false depends on the initial hypothesis.\n\nNext, let  be  As shown in the following table, all hypotheses for the ground model of the previous example are revised to the set .\n\n+ Sample revision for stage 0stage 1stage 2stage 3\n\nFor a slightly more complex revision pattern, let  contain  and all the numerals, , and let the ground model be , whose domain is the natural numbers, , with interpretation  such that  for all numerals and  is the usual ordering on natural numbers. Let  be  Let the initial hypothesis  be . In this case, the sequence of extensions builds up stage by stage.\n\n \n\nAlthough for every ,  is valid in ,  is not valid in .\n\nSuppose the initial hypothesis contains 0, 2, and all the odd numbers. After one revision, the extension of  will be . Subsequent revisions will build up the extension as with the previous example. More generally, if the extension of  is not all of , then one revision will cut the extension of  down to a possibly empty initial segment of the natural numbers and subsequent revisions will build it back up.\n\nProof system\nThere is a Fitch-style natural deduction proof system, , for circular definitions.A presentation of  can be found in chapter 5 of Gupta and Belnap (1993). The system uses indexed formulas, , where  can be any integer. One can think of the indices as representing relative position in a revision sequence. The premises and conclusions of the rules for the classical connectives all have the same index. For example, here are the conjunction and negation introduction rules.\n | \n | \n |  In\n\n | |__ \n | | \n | | \n |  In\n\nFor each definition, , in , there is a pair of rules.\n | \n |  DfIn\n\n | \n |  DfElim\nIn these rules, it is assumed that  are free for  in .\n\nFinally, for formulas  of , there is one more rule, the index shift rule.\n | \n |  IS\nIn this rule,  and  can be any distinct indices. This rule reflects the fact that formulas from the ground language do not change their interpretation throughout the revision process.\n\nThe system  is sound and complete with respect to  validity, meaning a sentence is valid in  just in case it is derivable in .\n\nRecently Riccardo Bruni has developed a Hilbert-style axiom system and a sequent system that are both sound and complete with respect to .Bruni (2013)\n\nTransfinite revision\nFor some definitions,  validity is not strong enough.The definitions of this section are taken from Gupta and Belnap (1993). For example, in definition , even though every number is eventually stably in the extension of , the universally quantified sentence  is not valid. The reason is that for any given sentence to be valid, it must stabilize to true after finitely many revisions. On the other hand,  needs infinitely many revisions, unless the initial hypothesis already assigns all the natural numbers as the extension of .\n\nNatural strengthenings of  validity, and alternatives to it, use transfinitely long revision sequences. Let  be the class of all ordinals. The definitions will focus on sequences of hypotheses that are -long.\n\nSuppose  is an -long sequence of hypotheses. A tuple  is stably in the extension of a defined predicate  at a limit ordinal  in a sequence  just in case there is an  such that for all  with , . Similarly, a tuple  is stably out of the extension of  at a limit ordinal  just in case there is a stage  such that for all  with , . Otherwise  is unstable at  in . Informally, a tuple is stably in an extension at a limit, just in case there's a stage after which the tuple is in the extension up until the limit, and a tuple is stably out just in case there's a stage after which it remains out going to the limit stage.\n\nA hypothesis  coheres with  at a limit ordinal  iff for all tuples , if  is stably in [stably out of] the extension of  at  in , then .\n\nAn -long sequence  of hypotheses is a revision sequence iff for all ,\n\n if , then , and\n if  is a limit, then  coheres with  at .\n\nJust as with the  sequences, the successor stages of the sequence are generated by the revision operator. At limit stages, however, the only constraint is that the limit hypothesis cohere with what came before. The unstable elements are set according to a limit rule, the details of which are left open by the set of definitions.\n\nLimit rules can be categorized into two classes, constant and non-constant, depending on whether they do different things at different limit stages. A constant limit rule does the same thing to unstable elements at each limit. One particular constant limit rule, the Herzberger rule, excludes all unstable elements from extensions. According to another constant rule, the Gupta rule, unstable elements are included in extensions just in case they were in . Non-constant limit rules vary the treatment of unstable elements at limits.\n\nTwo senses of validity can be defined using -long sequences. The first,  validity, is defined in terms of stability. A sentence  is valid in  in  on  iff for all -long revision sequences , there is a stage  such that  is stably true in  after stage . A sentence  is  valid on  just in case for all classical ground models ,  is  valid in  on .\n\nThe second sense of validity,  validity, uses near stability rather than stability. A sentence  is nearly stably true in a sequence  iff there is an  such that for all , there is a natural number  such that for all ,  A sentence  is nearly stably false in a sequence  iff there is an  such that for all , there is a natural number  such that for all ,  A nearly stable sentence may have finitely long periods of instability following limits, after which it settles down until the next limit.\n\nA sentence  is valid in  in  on  iff for all -long revision sequences , there is a stage  such that  is nearly stably true in  after stage . A sentence  is valid in  in on  just in case it is valid in  in all ground models.\n\nIf a sentence is valid in , then it is valid in , but not conversely. An example using  shows this for validity in a model. The sentence  is not valid in  in , but it is valid in .\n\nAn attraction of  validity is that it generates a simpler logic than . The proof system  is sound for , but it is not, in general, complete. In light of the completeness of , if a sentence is valid in , then it is valid in , but the converse does not hold in general. Validity in  and in  are, in general, incomparable. Consequently,  is not sound for .\n\nFinite definitions\nWhile  validity outstrips  validity, in general, there is a special case in which the two coincide, finite definitions. Loosely speaking, a definition is finite if all revision sequences stop producing new hypotheses after a finite number of revisions. To put it more precisely, we define a hypothesis  as reflexive just in case there is an  such that . A definition is finite iff for all models , for all hypotheses , there is a natural number , such that  is reflexive. Gupta showed that if  is finite, then  validity and  validity coincide.\n\nThere is no known syntactic characterization of the set of finite definitions, and finite definitions are not closed under standard logical operations, such as conjunction and disjunction. Maricarmen Martinez has identified some syntactic features under which the set of finite definitions is closed..Martinez (2001) She has shown that if  contains only unary predicates, apart from identity, contains no function symbols, and the definienda of  are all unary, then  is finite.\n\nWhile many standard logical operations do not preserve finiteness, it is preserved by the operation of self-composition.This was shown by Gupta (2006b). For a definition , define self-composition recursively as follows.\n\n  and\n .\n\nThe latter says that  is obtained by replacing all instances of  in , with . If  is a finite definition and  is the result of replacing each definiens  in  with , then  is a finite definition as well.\n\nNotable formal features\nRevision theory distinguishes material equivalence from definitional equivalence.This point is noted by Gupta and Belnap (1993). The sets of definitions use the latter. In general, definitional equivalence is not the same as material equivalence. Given a definition\n\n \n\nits material counterpart,\n\n \n\nwill not, in general, be valid.One can extend revision theory with a unary operator so that the definitional equivalence will be reflected in the object languages by a valid equivalence,  . This was shown by Standefer (2015).\nThe definition\n\n \n\nillustrates the invalidity. Its definiens and definiendum will not have the same truth value after any revision, so the material biconditional will not be valid. For some definitions, the material counterparts of the defining clauses are valid. For example, if the definientia of  contain only symbols from the ground language, then the material counterparts will be valid.\n\nThe definitions given above are for the classical scheme. The definitions can be adjusted to work with any semantic scheme.See Gupta and Belnap (1993) for this point. This includes three-valued schemes, such as Strong Kleene, with exclusion negation, whose truth table is the following.\n\n+ Exclusion negation\n\nNotably, many approaches to truth, such as Saul Kripke\u2019s Strong Kleene theory, cannot be used with exclusion negation in the language.\n\nRevision theory, while in some respects similar to the theory of inductive definitions, differs in several ways.This is shown by Gupta and Belnap (1993). Most importantly, revision need not be monotonic, which is to say that extensions at later stages need not be supersets of extensions at earlier stages, as illustrated by the first example above. Relatedly, revision theory does not postulate any restrictions on the syntactic form of definitions. Inductive definitions require their definientia to be positive, in the sense that definienda can only appear in definientia under an even number of negations. (This assumes that negation, conjunction, disjunction, and the universal quantifier are the primitive logical connectives, and the remaining classical connectives are simply defined symbols.) The definition\n\n \n\nis acceptable in revision theory, although not in the theory of inductive definitions.\n\nInductive definitions are semantically interpreted via fixed points, hypotheses  for which . In general, revision sequences will not reach fixed points. If the definientia of  are all positive, then revision sequences will reach fixed points, as long as the initial hypothesis has the feature that , for each . In particular, given such a , if the initial hypothesis assigns the empty extension to all definienda, then the revision sequence will reach the minimal fixed point.\n\nThe sets of valid sentences on some definitions can be highly complex, in particular . This was shown by Philip Kremer and Aldo Antonelli.See Kremer (1993) and Antonelli (1994a), respectively. There is, consequently, no proof system for  validity.\n\nTruth\nThe most famous application of revision theory is to the theory of truth, as developed in Gupta and Belnap (1993), for example. The circular definition of truth is the set of all the Tarski biconditionals, \u2018\u2019 is true iff , where \u2018iff\u2019 is understood as definitional equivalence, , rather than material equivalence. Each Tarski biconditional provides a partial definition of the concept of truth. The concept of truth is circular because some Tarski biconditionals use an ineliminable instance of \u2018is true\u2019 in their definiens. For example, suppose that  is the name of a truth-teller sentence,  is true. This sentence has as its Tarski biconditional:  is true iff  is true. The truth predicate on the right cannot be eliminated. This example depends on there being a truth-teller in the language. This and other examples show that truth, defined by the Tarski biconditionals, is a circular concept.\n\nSome languages, such as the language of arithmetic, will have vicious self-reference. The liar and other pathological sentences are guaranteed to be in the language with truth. Other languages with truth can be defined that lack vicious self-reference.See Gupta (1982) for an example. In such a language, any revision sequence  for truth is bound to reach a stage where , so the truth predicate behaves like a non-circular predicate.Gupta and Belnap (1993, 202-205) The result is that, in such languages, truth has a stable extension that is defined over all sentences of the language. This is in contrast to many other theories of truth, for example the minimal Strong Kleene and minimal supervaluational theories. The extension and anti-extension of the truth predicate in these theories will not exhaust the set of sentences of the language.\n\nThe difference between  and  is important when considering revision theories of truth. Part of the difference comes across in the semantical laws, which are the following equivalences, where T is a truth predicate.The corner quotes are used to indicate a generic naming device, e.g. quotation names or G\u00f6del numbering.\n\n \n \n \n \nThese are all valid in , although the last is valid only when the domain is countable and every element is named. In , however, none are valid. One can see why the negation law fails by considering the liar, . The liar and all finite iterations of the truth predicate to it are unstable, so one can set  and  to have the same truth value at some limits, which results in  and  having different truth values. This is corrected after revision, but the negation law will not be stably true. It is a consequence of a theorem of Vann McGee that the revision theory of truth in   is -inconsistent.McGee (1985) The   theory is not -inconsistent.\n\nThere is an axiomatic theory of truth that is related to the  theory in the language of arithmetic with truth. The Friedman-Sheard theory (FS) is obtained by adding to the usual axioms of Peano arithmetic \n the axiom , \n the semantical laws, \n the induction axioms with the truth predicate, and \n the two rules\n if , then , and\n if , then .The original presentation of FS used different axioms and rules. See Halbach (2011) for more details.\nBy McGee's theorem, this theory is -inconsistent. FS does not, however, have as theorems any false purely arithmetical sentences.Halbach (2011, 173) FS has as a theorem global reflection for Peano arithmetic,\n\n \n\nwhere  is a provability predicate for Peano arithmetic and  is a predicate true of all and only sentences of the language with truth. Consequently, it is a theorem of FS that Peano arithmetic is consistent.\n\nFS is a subtheory of the theory of truth for arithmetic, the set of sentences valid in . A standard way to show that FS is consistent is to use an -long revision sequence.Halbach (2011, \u00a714.1) There has been some work done on axiomatizing the  theory of truth for arithmetic.Horsten et al. (2012)\n\nOther applications\nRevision theory has been used to study circular concepts apart from truth and to provide alternative analyses of concepts, such as rationality.\n\nA non-well-founded set theory is a set theory that postulates the existence of a non-well-founded set, which is a set  that has an infinite descending chain along the membership relation,\n\n \n\nAntonelli has used revision theory to construct models of non-well-founded set theory.Antonelli (1994b) One example is a set theory that postulates a set whose sole member is itself, .\n\nInfinite-time Turing machines are models of computation that permit computations to go on for infinitely many steps. They generalize standard Turing machines used in the theory of computability. Benedikt L\u00f6we has shown that there are close connections between computations of infinite-time Turing machines and revision processes.L\u00f6we (2001)\n\nRational choice in game theory has been analyzed as a circular concept. Andr\u00e9 Chapuis has argued that the reasoning agents use in rational choice exhibits an interdependence characteristic of circular concepts.Chapuis (2003)\n\nRevision theory can be adapted to model other sorts of phenomena. For example, vagueness has been analyzed in revision-theoretic terms by Conrad Asmus.Asmus (2013) To model a vague predicate on this approach, one specifies pairs of similar objects and which objects are non-borderline cases, and so are unrevisable. The borderline objects change their status with respect to a predicate depending on the status of the objects to which they are similar.\n\nRevision theory has been used by Gupta to explicate the logical contribution of experience to one's beliefs.Gupta (2006a) According to this view, the contribution of experience is represented by a rule of revision that takes as input on an agent's view, or concepts and beliefs, and yields as output perceptual judgments. These judgments can be used to update the agent's view.\n\nSee also\n Anil Gupta\n Circular definition\n Definition\n Paradox\n Philosophical logic\n Truth\n\nReferences\n\n Antonelli, A. (1994a).

{"title": "Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertson%E2%80%93Seymour_theorem", "text": "In graph theory, the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem (also called the graph minor theorem.) states that the undirected graphs, partially ordered by the graph minor relationship, form a well-quasi-ordering.. Equivalently, every family of graphs that is closed under minors can be defined by a finite set of forbidden minors, in the same way that Wagner's theorem characterizes the planar graphs as being the graphs that do not have the complete graph K5 or the complete bipartite graph K3,3 as minors.\n\nThe Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem is named after mathematicians Neil Robertson and Paul D. Seymour, who proved it in a series of twenty papers spanning over 500 pages from 1983 to 2004.; . Before its proof, the statement of the theorem was known as Wagner's conjecture after the German mathematician Klaus Wagner, although Wagner said he never conjectured it..\n\nA weaker result for trees is implied by Kruskal's tree theorem, which was conjectured in 1937 by Andrew V\u00e1zsonyi and proved in 1960 independently by Joseph Kruskal and S. Tarkowski.; , Section 3.3, pp. 78\u201379.\n\nStatement\nA minor of an undirected graph G is any graph that may be obtained from G by a sequence of zero or more contractions of edges of G and deletions of edges and vertices of G. The minor relationship forms a partial order on the set of all distinct finite undirected graphs, as it obeys the three axioms of partial orders: it is reflexive (every graph is a minor of itself), transitive (a minor of a minor of G is itself a minor of G), and antisymmetric (if two graphs G and H are minors of each other, then they must be isomorphic). However, if graphs that are isomorphic may nonetheless be considered as distinct objects, then the minor ordering on graphs forms a preorder, a relation that is reflexive and transitive but not necessarily antisymmetric.E.g., see , Section 2, \"well-quasi-orders\".\n\nA preorder is said to form a well-quasi-ordering if it contains neither an infinite descending chain nor an infinite antichain.. For instance, the usual ordering on the non-negative integers is a well-quasi-ordering, but the same ordering on the set of all integers is not, because it contains the infinite descending chain 0,\u00a0\u22121,\u00a0\u22122,\u00a0\u22123...\n\nThe Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem states that finite undirected graphs and graph minors form a well-quasi-ordering. The graph minor relationship does not contain any infinite descending chain, because each contraction or deletion reduces the number of edges and vertices of the graph (a non-negative integer). The nontrivial part of the theorem is that there are no infinite antichains, infinite sets of graphs that are all unrelated to each other by the minor ordering. If S is a set of graphs, and M is a subset of S containing one representative graph for each equivalence class of minimal elements (graphs that belong to S but for which no proper minor belongs to S), then M forms an antichain; therefore, an equivalent way of stating the theorem is that, in any infinite set S of graphs, there must be only a finite number of non-isomorphic minimal elements.\n\nAnother equivalent form of the theorem is that, in any infinite set S of graphs, there must be a pair of graphs one of which is a minor of the other.. The statement that every infinite set has finitely many minimal elements implies this form of the theorem, for if there are only finitely many minimal elements, then each of the remaining graphs must belong to a pair of this type with one of the minimal elements. And in the other direction, this form of the theorem implies the statement that there can be no infinite antichains, because an infinite antichain is a set that does not contain any pair related by the minor relation.\n\nForbidden minor characterizations\nA family F of graphs is said to be closed under the operation of taking minors if every minor of a graph in F also belongs to F. If F is a minor-closed family, then let S be the set of graphs that are not in F (the complement of F). According to the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem, there exists a finite set H of minimal elements in S. These minimal elements form a forbidden graph characterization of F: the graphs in F are exactly the graphs that do not have any graph in H as a minor., Corollary 2.1.1; , Theorem 4, p.\u00a078. The members of H are called the excluded minors (or forbidden minors, or minor-minimal obstructions) for the family F.\n\nFor example, the planar graphs are closed under taking minors: contracting an edge in a planar graph, or removing edges or vertices from the graph, cannot destroy its planarity. Therefore, the planar graphs have a forbidden minor characterization, which in this case is given by Wagner's theorem: the set H of minor-minimal nonplanar graphs contains exactly two graphs, the complete graph K5 and the complete bipartite graph K3,3, and the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that do not have a minor in the set {K5,\u00a0K3,3}.\n\nThe existence of forbidden minor characterizations for all minor-closed graph families is an equivalent way of stating the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem. For, suppose that every minor-closed family F has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors, and let S be any infinite set of graphs. Define F from S as the family of graphs that do not have a minor in S. Then F is minor-closed and has a finite set H of minimal forbidden minors. Let C be the complement of F. S is a subset of C since S and F are disjoint, and H are the minimal graphs in C. Consider a graph G in H. G cannot have a proper minor in S since G is minimal in C. At the same time, G must have a minor in S, since otherwise G would be an element in F. Therefore, G is an element in S, i.e., H is a subset of S, and all other graphs in S have a minor among the graphs in H, so H is the finite set of minimal elements of S.\n\nFor the other implication, assume that every set of graphs has a finite subset of minimal graphs and let a minor-closed set F be given. We want to find a set H of graphs such that a graph is in F if and only if it does not have a minor in H. Let E be the graphs which are not minors of any graph in F, and let H be the finite set of minimal graphs in E. Now, let an arbitrary graph G be given. Assume first that G is in F. G cannot have a minor in H since G is in F and H is a subset of E. Now assume that G is not in F. Then G is not a minor of any graph in F, since F is minor-closed. Therefore, G is in E, so G has a minor in H.\n\nExamples of minor-closed families\n\nThe following sets of finite graphs are minor-closed, and therefore (by the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem) have forbidden minor characterizations:\nforests, linear forests (disjoint unions of path graphs), pseudoforests, and cactus graphs;\nplanar graphs, outerplanar graphs, apex graphs (formed by adding a single vertex to a planar graph), toroidal graphs, and the graphs that can be embedded on any fixed two-dimensional manifold;.\ngraphs that are linklessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space, and graphs that are knotlessly embeddable in Euclidean 3-space;\ngraphs with a feedback vertex set of size bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with Colin de Verdi\u00e8re graph invariant bounded by some fixed constant; graphs with treewidth, pathwidth, or branchwidth bounded by some fixed constant.\n\nObstruction sets\nthumb|The Petersen family, the obstruction set for linkless embedding.\nSome examples of finite obstruction sets were already known for specific classes of graphs before the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem was proved. For example, the obstruction for the set of all forests is the loop graph (or, if one restricts to simple graphs, the cycle with three vertices). This means that a graph is a forest if and only if none of its minors is the loop (or, the cycle with three vertices, respectively).  The sole obstruction for the set of paths is the tree with four vertices, one of which has degree 3. In these cases, the obstruction set contains a single element, but in general this is not the case. Wagner's theorem states that a graph is planar if and only if it has neither K5 nor K3,3 as a minor. In other words, the set {K5,\u00a0K3,3} is an obstruction set for the set of all planar graphs, and in fact the unique minimal obstruction set.  A similar theorem states that K4 and K2,3 are the forbidden minors for the set of outerplanar graphs.\n\nAlthough the Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem extends these results to arbitrary minor-closed graph families, it is not a complete substitute for these results, because it does not provide an explicit description of the obstruction set for any family. For example, it tells us that the set of toroidal graphs has a finite obstruction set, but it does not provide any such set. The complete set of forbidden minors for toroidal graphs remains unknown, but contains at least 16000 graphs..\n\nPolynomial time recognition\nThe Robertson\u2013Seymour theorem has an important consequence in computational complexity, due to the proof by Robertson and Seymour that, for each fixed graph G, there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether larger graphs have G as a minor. The running time of this algorithm can be expressed as a cubic polynomial in the size of the larger graph (although there is a constant factor in this polynomial that depends superpolynomially on the size of G), which has been improved to quadratic time by Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed. As a result, for every minor-closed family F, there is polynomial time algorithm for testing whether a graph belongs to F: simply check, for each of the forbidden minors for F, whether the given graph contains that forbidden minor.; , Theorem 2.1.4 and Corollary 2.1.5; , Theorem 11, p. 83.\n\nHowever, this method requires a specific finite obstruction set to work, and the theorem does not provide one. The theorem proves that such a finite obstruction set exists, and therefore the problem is polynomial because of the above algorithm. However, the algorithm can be used in practice only if such a finite obstruction set is provided. As a result, the theorem proves that the problem can be solved in polynomial time, but does not provide a concrete polynomial-time algorithm for solving it. Such proofs of polynomiality are non-constructive: they prove polynomiality of problems without providing an explicit polynomial-time algorithm.; , Section 6. In many specific cases, checking whether a graph is in a given minor-closed family can be done more efficiently: for example, checking whether a graph is planar can be done in linear time.\n\nFixed-parameter tractability\nFor graph invariants with the property that, for each k, the graphs with invariant at most k are minor-closed, the same method applies. For instance, by this result, treewidth, branchwidth, and pathwidth, vertex cover, and the minimum genus of an embedding are all amenable to this approach, and for any fixed k there is a polynomial time algorithm for testing whether these invariants are at most k, in which the exponent in the running time of the algorithm does not depend on k. A problem with this property, that it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed k with an exponent that does not depend on k, is known as fixed-parameter tractable.\n\nHowever, this method does not directly provide a single fixed-parameter-tractable algorithm for computing the parameter value for a given graph with unknown k, because of the difficulty of determining the set of forbidden minors. Additionally, the large constant factors involved in these results make them highly impractical. Therefore, the development of explicit fixed-parameter algorithms for these problems, with improved dependence on k, has continued to be an important line of research.\n\nFinite form of the graph minor theorem\n showed that the following theorem exhibits the independence phenomenon by being unprovable in various formal systems that are much stronger than Peano arithmetic, yet being provable in systems much weaker than ZFC:\n \nTheorem: For every positive integer n, there is an integer m so large that if G1, ..., Gm is a sequence of finite undirected graphs, \nwhere each Gi has size at most n+i, then Gj \u2264 Gk for some j < k.\n\n(Here, the size of a graph is the total number of its vertices and edges, and \u2264 denotes the minor ordering.)\n\nSee also\nGraph structure theorem\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\nExternal links\n\nCategory:Graph minor theory\nCategory:Wellfoundedness\nCategory:Theorems in graph theory"}

{"title": "Sequent calculus", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequent_calculus", "text": "Sequent calculus is, in essence, a style of formal logical argumentation where every line of a proof is a conditional tautology (called a sequent by Gerhard Gentzen) instead of an unconditional tautology. Each conditional tautology is inferred from other conditional tautologies on earlier lines in a formal argument according to rules and procedures of inference, giving a better approximation to the style of natural deduction used by mathematicians than David Hilbert's earlier style of formal logic where every line was an unconditional tautology. There may be more subtle distinctions to be made; for example, there may be non-logical axioms upon which all propositions are implicitly dependent. Then sequents signify conditional theorems in a first-order language rather than conditional tautologies.\n\nSequent calculus is one of several extant styles of proof calculus for expressing line-by-line logical arguments.\n Hilbert style. Every line is an unconditional tautology (or theorem).\n Gentzen style. Every line is a conditional tautology (or theorem) with zero or more conditions on the left.\n Natural deduction. Every (conditional) line has exactly one asserted proposition on the right.\n Sequent calculus. Every (conditional) line has zero or more asserted propositions on the right.\nIn other words, natural deduction and sequent calculus systems are particular distinct kinds of Gentzen-style systems. Hilbert-style systems typically have a very small number of inference rules, relying more on sets of axioms. Gentzen-style systems typically have very few axioms, if any, relying more on sets of rules.\n\nGentzen-style systems have significant practical and theoretical advantages compared to Hilbert-style systems. For example, both natural deduction and sequent calculus systems facilitate the elimination and introduction of universal and existential quantifiers so that unquantified logical expressions can be manipulated according to the much simpler rules of propositional calculus. In a typical argument, quantifiers are eliminated, then propositional calculus is applied to unquantified expressions (which typically contain free variables), and then the quantifiers are reintroduced. This very much parallels the way in which mathematical proofs are carried out in practice by mathematicians. Predicate calculus proofs are generally much easier to discover with this approach, and are often shorter. Natural deduction systems are more suited to practical theorem-proving. Sequent calculus systems are more suited to theoretical analysis.\n\nOverview\n\nIn proof theory and mathematical logic, sequent calculus is a family of formal systems sharing a certain style of inference and certain formal properties.  The first sequent calculi systems, LK and LJ, were introduced in 1934/1935 by Gerhard Gentzen, . as a tool for studying natural deduction in first-order logic (in classical and intuitionistic versions, respectively).  Gentzen's so-called \"Main Theorem\" (Hauptsatz) about LK and LJ was the cut-elimination theorem,, gives a 5-page proof of the elimination theorem. See also pages 188, 250., gives a very brief proof of the cut-elimination theorem. a result with far-reaching meta-theoretic consequences, including consistency.  Gentzen further demonstrated the power and flexibility of this technique a few years later, applying a cut-elimination argument to give a (transfinite) proof of the consistency of Peano arithmetic, in surprising response to G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.  Since this early work, sequent calculi, also called Gentzen systems,, calls Gentzen systems LC systems. Curry's emphasis is more on theory than on practical logic proofs.. This book is much more concerned with the theoretical, metamathematical implications of Gentzen-style sequent calculus than applications to practical logic proofs., defines Gentzen systems and proves various theorems within these systems, including G\u00f6del's completeness theorem and Gentzen's theorem., gives a brief theoretical presentation of Gentzen systems. He uses the tableau proof layout style. and the general concepts relating to them, have been widely applied in the fields of proof theory, mathematical logic, and automated deduction.\n\nHilbert-style deduction systems\n\nOne way to classify different styles of deduction systems is to look at the form of judgments in the system, i.e., which things may appear as the conclusion of a (sub)proof. The simplest judgment form is used in Hilbert-style deduction systems, where a judgment has the form\n\nwhere  is any formula of first-order-logic (or whatever logic the deduction system applies to, e.g., propositional calculus or a higher-order logic or a modal logic). The theorems are those formulae that appear as the concluding judgment in a valid proof. A Hilbert-style system needs no distinction between formulae and judgments; we make one here solely for comparison with the cases that follow.\n\nThe price paid for the simple syntax of a Hilbert-style system is that complete formal proofs tend to get extremely long. Concrete arguments about proofs in such a system almost always appeal to the deduction theorem. This leads to the idea of including the deduction theorem as a formal rule in the system, which happens in natural deduction.\n\nNatural deduction systems\n\nIn natural deduction, judgments have the shape\n\nwhere the 's and  are again formulae and . Permutations of the 's are immaterial. In other words, a judgment consists of a list (possibly empty) of formulae on the left-hand side of a turnstile symbol \"\", with a single formula on the right-hand side., compares natural deduction systems, denoted LA, and Gentzen systems, denoted LC. Curry's emphasis is more theoretical than practical., is an introductory presentation of practical natural deduction of this kind. This became the basis of System L. is an elementary introduction to practical natural deduction based on the convenient abbreviated proof layout style System L based on . The theorems are those formulae  such that  (with an empty left-hand side) is the conclusion of a valid proof.\n(In some presentations of natural deduction, the s and the turnstile are not written down explicitly; instead a two-dimensional notation from which they can be inferred is used.)\n\nThe standard semantics of a judgment in natural deduction is that it asserts that wheneverHere, \"whenever\" is used as an informal abbreviation \"for every assignment of values to the free variables in the judgment\" , , etc., are all true,  will also be true. The judgments\n\nand\n\nare equivalent in the strong sense that a proof of either one may be extended to a proof of the other.\n\nSequent calculus systems\n\nFinally, sequent calculus generalizes the form of a natural deduction judgment to\n \na syntactic object called a sequent. The formulas on left-hand side of the turnstile are called the antecedent, and the formulas on right-hand side are called the succedent or consequent; together they are called cedents or sequents. Again,  and  are formulae, and  and  are nonnegative integers, that is, the left-hand-side or the right-hand-side (or neither or both) may be empty. As in natural deduction, theorems are those  where  is the conclusion of a valid proof.\n\nThe standard semantics of a sequent is an assertion that whenever every   is true, at least one  will also be true.For explanations of the disjunctive semantics for the right side of sequents, see , , , ,  and . Thus the empty sequent, having both cedents empty, is false. One way to express this is that a comma to the left of the turnstile should be thought of as an \"and\", and a comma to the right of the turnstile should be thought of as an (inclusive) \"or\". The sequents\n\nand\n\nare equivalent in the strong sense that a proof of either one may be extended to a proof of the other.\n\nAt first sight, this extension of the judgment form may appear to be a strange complication \u2014 it is not motivated by an obvious shortcoming of natural deduction, and it is initially confusing that the comma seems to mean entirely different things on the two sides of the turnstile. However, in a classical context the semantics of the sequent can also (by propositional tautology) be expressed either as\n \n(at least one of the As is false, or one of the Bs is true) or as\n \n(it cannot be the case that all of the As are true and all of the Bs are false).  In these formulations, the only difference between formulae on either side of the turnstile is that one side is negated. Thus, swapping left for right in a sequent corresponds to negating all of the constituent formulae. This means that a symmetry such as De Morgan's laws, which manifests itself as logical negation on the semantic level, translates directly into a left-right symmetry of sequents \u2014 and indeed, the inference rules in sequent calculus for dealing with conjunction (\u2227) are mirror images of those dealing with disjunction (\u2228).\n\nMany logicians feel  that this symmetric presentation offers a deeper insight in the structure of the logic than other styles of proof system, where the classical duality of negation is not as apparent in the rules.\n\nDistinction between natural deduction and sequent calculus\n\nGentzen asserted a sharp distinction between his single-output natural deduction systems (NK and NJ) and his multiple-output sequent calculus systems (LK and LJ). He wrote that the intuitionistic natural deduction system NJ was somewhat ugly.. \"Der Kalk\u00fcl NJ hat manche formale Unsch\u00f6nheiten.\" He said that the special role of the excluded middle in the classical natural deduction system NK is removed in the classical sequent calculus system LK.. \"In dem klassischen Kalk\u00fcl NK nahm der Satz vom ausgeschlossenen Dritten eine Sonderstellung unter den Schlu\u00dfweisen ein [...], indem er sich der Einf\u00fchrungs- und Beseitigungssystematik nicht einf\u00fcgte. Bei dem im folgenden anzugebenden logistischen klassichen Kalk\u00fcl LK wird diese Sonderstellung aufgehoben.\" He said that the sequent calculus LJ gave more symmetry than natural deduction NJ in the case of intuitionistic logic, as also in the case of classical logic (LK versus NK).. \"Die damit erreichte Symmetrie erweist sich als f\u00fcr die klassische Logik angemessener.\" Then he said that in addition to these reasons, the sequent calculus with multiple succedent formulas is intended particularly for his principal theorem (\"Hauptsatz\").. \"Hiermit haben wir einige Gesichtspunkte zur Begr\u00fcndung der Aufstellung der folgenden Kalk\u00fcle angegeben. Im wesentlichen ist ihre Form jedoch durch die R\u00fccksicht auf den nachher zu beweisenden 'Hauptsatz' bestimmt und kann daher vorl\u00e4ufig nicht n\u00e4her begr\u00fcndet werden.\"\n\nOrigin of word \"sequent\"\n\nThe word \"sequent\" is taken from the word \"Sequenz\" in Gentzen's 1934 paper. Kleene makes the following comment on the translation into English: \"Gentzen says 'Sequenz', which we translate as 'sequent', because we have already used 'sequence' for any succession of objects, where the German is 'Folge'.\".\n\n Proving logical formulas \nthumb|A rooted tree describing a proof finding procedure by sequent calculus\n\n Reduction trees \nSequent calculus can be seen as a tool for proving formulas in propositional logic, similar to the method of analytic tableaux. It gives a series of steps which allows one to reduce the problem of proving a logical formula to simpler and simpler formulas until one arrives at trivial ones.Applied Logic, Univ. of Cornell: Lecture 9. Last Retrieved: 2016-06-25\n\nConsider the following formula:\n\nThis is written in the following form, where the proposition that needs to be proven is to the right of the turnstile symbol :\n\nNow, instead of proving this from the axioms, it is enough to assume the premise of the implication and then try to prove its conclusion.\"Remember, the way that you prove  an implication is by assuming the hypothesis.\" \u2014Philip Wadler, on 2 November 2015, in his  Keynote: \"Propositions as Types\". Minute 14:36 /55:28 of Code Mesh video clip  Hence one moves to the following sequent:\n\nAgain the right hand side includes an implication, whose premise can further be assumed so that only its conclusion needs to be proven:\n\nSince the arguments in the left-hand side are assumed to be related by conjunction, this can be replaced by the following:\n\nThis is equivalent to proving the conclusion in both cases of the disjunction on the first argument on the left. Thus we may split the sequent to two, where we now have to prove each separately:\n\nIn the case of the first judgment, we rewrite  as  and split the sequent again to get:\n\nThe second sequent is done; the first sequent can be further simplified into:\n\nThis process can always be continued until there are only atomic formulas in each side. \nThe process can be graphically described by a rooted tree graph, as depicted on the right. The root of the tree is the formula we wish to prove; the leaves consist of atomic formulas only. The tree is known as a reduction tree.\n\nThe items to the left of the turnstile are understood to be connected by conjunction, and those to the right by disjunction. Therefore, when both consist only of atomic symbols, the sequent is provable (and always true) if and only if at least one of the symbols on the right also appears on the left.\n\nFollowing are the rules by which one proceeds along the tree. Whenever one sequent is split into two, the tree vertex has three edges (one coming from the vertex closer to the root), and the tree is branched. Additionally, one may freely change the order of the arguments in each side; \u0393 and \u0394 stand for possible additional arguments.\n\nThe usual term for the horizontal line used in Gentzen-style layouts for natural deduction is inference line.Jan von Plato, Elements of Logical Reasoning, Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. 32.\n\n Left:  Right: \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  \n rule:  Axiom:  \n\nStarting with any formula in propositional logic, by a series of steps, the right side of the turnstile can be processed until it includes only atomic symbols. Then, the same is done for the left side. Since every logical operator appears in one of the rules above, and is omitted by the rule, the process terminates when no logical operators remain: The formula has been decomposed.\n\nThus, the sequents in the leaves of the trees include only atomic symbols, which are either provable by the axiom or not, according to whether one of the symbols on the right also appears on the left.\n\nIt is easy to see that the steps in the tree preserve the semantic truth value of the formulas implied by them, with conjunction understood between the tree's different branches whenever there is a split. It is also obvious that an axiom is provable if and only if it is true for every truth values of the atomic symbols. Thus this system is sound and complete in propositional logic.\n\n Relation to standard axiomatizations \n\nSequent calculus is related to other axiomatizations of propositional calculus, such as Frege's propositional calculus or Jan \u0141ukasiewicz's axiomatization (itself a part of the standard Hilbert system): Every formula that can be proven in these has a reduction tree.\n\nThis can be shown as follows: Every proof in propositional calculus uses only axioms and the inference rules. Each use of an axiom scheme yields a true logical formula, and can thus be proven in sequent calculus; examples for these are shown below. The only inference rule in the systems mentioned above is modus ponens, which is implemented by the cut rule.\n\nThe system LK\n\nThis section introduces the rules of the sequent calculus LK (which just stands for \u201cklassische Pr\u00e4dikatenlogik\u201d), as introduced by Gentzen in 1934.\nA (formal) proof in this calculus is a sequence of sequents, where each of the sequents is derivable from sequents appearing earlier in the sequence by using one of the rules below.\n\nInference rules\n\nThe following notation will be used:\n  known as the turnstile, separates the assumptions on the left from the propositions on the right\n  and  denote formulae of first-order predicate logic (one may also restrict this to propositional logic),\n , and  are finite (possibly empty) sequences of formulae (in fact, the order of formulae does not matter; see subsection Structural Rules),  called contexts,\n when on the left of the , the sequence of formulas is considered conjunctively (all assumed to hold at the same time),\n while on the right of the , the sequence of formulas is considered disjunctively (at least one of the formulas must hold for any assignment of variables),\n  denotes an arbitrary term,\n  and  denote variables.\n a variable is said to occur free within a formula if it occurs outside the scope of quantifiers  or .\n  denotes the formula that is obtained by substituting the term  for every free occurrence of the variable  in formula  with the restriction that the term  must be free for the variable  in  (i.e., no occurrence of any variable in  becomes bound in ).\n  and  stand for Weakening Left/Right,  and  for Contraction, and  and  for Permutation.\n\nNote that, contrary to the rules for proceeding along the reduction tree presented above, the following rules are for moving in the opposite directions, from axioms to theorems. Thus they are exact mirror-images of the rules above, except that here symmetry is not implicitly assumed, and rules regarding quantification are added.\n\n Axiom:  Cut:   Left logical rules:  Right logical rules:               Left structural rules: Right structural rules:      \n\nRestrictions: In the rules  and , the variable  must not occur free anywhere in the respective lower sequents.\n\nAn intuitive explanation\n\nThe above rules can be divided into two major groups: logical and structural ones. Each of the logical rules introduces a new logical formula either on the left or on the right of the turnstile . In contrast, the structural rules operate on the structure of the sequents, ignoring the exact shape of the formulae. The two exceptions to this general scheme are the axiom of identity (I) and the rule of (Cut).\n\nAlthough stated in a formal way, the above rules allow for a very intuitive reading in terms of classical logic. Consider, for example, the rule . It says that, whenever one can prove that  can be concluded from some sequence of formulae that contain , then one can also conclude  from the (stronger) assumption that  holds. Likewise, the rule  states that, if  and  suffice to conclude , then from  alone one can either still conclude  or  must be false, i.e.  holds. All the rules can be interpreted in this way.\n\nFor an intuition about the quantifier rules, consider the rule . Of course concluding that  holds just from the fact that  is true is not in general possible. If, however, the variable y is not mentioned elsewhere (i.e. it can still be chosen freely, without influencing the other formulae), then one may assume, that  holds for any value of y. The other rules should then be pretty straightforward.\n\nInstead of viewing the rules as descriptions for legal derivations in predicate logic, one may also consider them as instructions for the construction of a proof for a given statement. In this case the rules can be read bottom-up; for example,  says that, to prove that  follows from the assumptions  and , it suffices to prove that  can be concluded from  and  can be concluded from , respectively. Note that, given some antecedent, it is not clear how this is to be split into  and . However, there are only finitely many possibilities to be checked since the antecedent by assumption is finite. This also illustrates how proof theory can be viewed as operating on proofs in a combinatorial fashion: given proofs for both  and , one can construct a proof for .\n\nWhen looking for some proof, most of the rules offer more or less direct recipes of how to do this. The rule of cut is different: it states that, when a formula  can be concluded and this formula may also serve as a premise for concluding other statements, then the formula  can be \"cut out\" and the respective derivations are joined. When constructing a proof bottom-up, this creates the problem of guessing  (since it does not appear at all below). The cut-elimination theorem is thus crucial to the applications of sequent calculus in automated deduction: it states that all uses of the cut rule can be eliminated from a proof, implying that any provable sequent can be given a cut-free proof.\n\nThe second rule that is somewhat special is the axiom of identity (I). The intuitive reading of this is obvious: every formula proves itself.  Like the cut rule, the axiom of identity is somewhat redundant: the completeness of atomic initial sequents states that the rule can be restricted to atomic formulas without any loss of provability.\n\nObserve that all rules have mirror companions, except the ones for implication. This reflects the fact that the usual language of first-order logic does not include the \"is not implied by\" connective  that would be the De Morgan dual of implication. Adding such a connective with its natural rules would make the calculus completely left-right symmetric.\n\nExample derivations\n\nHere is the derivation of \"\", known as\nthe Law of excluded middle (tertium non datur in Latin).\n \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nNext is the proof of a simple fact involving quantifiers. Note that the converse is not true, and its falsity can be seen when attempting to derive it bottom-up, because an existing free variable cannot be used in substitution in the rules  and .\n \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nFor something more interesting we shall prove . It is straightforward to find the derivation, which exemplifies the usefulness of LK in automated proving.\n \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0   \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThese derivations also emphasize the strictly formal structure of the sequent calculus. For example, the logical rules as defined above always act on a formula immediately adjacent to the turnstile, such that the permutation rules are necessary. Note, however, that this is in part an artifact of the presentation, in the original style of Gentzen. A common simplification involves the use of multisets of formulas in the interpretation of the sequent, rather than sequences, eliminating the need for an explicit permutation rule. This corresponds to shifting commutativity of assumptions and derivations outside the sequent calculus, whereas LK embeds it within the system itself.\n\nRelation to analytic tableaux\nFor certain formulations (i.e. variants) of the sequent calculus, a proof in such a calculus is isomorphic to an upside-down, closed analytic tableau.\n\nStructural rules\n\nThe structural rules deserve some additional discussion.\n\nWeakening (W) allows the addition of arbitrary elements to a sequence.  Intuitively, this is allowed in the antecedent because we can always restrict the scope of our proof (if all cars have wheels, then it's safe to say that all black cars have wheels); and in the succedent because we can always allow for alternative conclusions (if all cars have wheels, then it's safe to say that all cars have either wheels or wings).\n\nContraction (C) and Permutation (P) assure that neither the order (P) nor the multiplicity of occurrences (C) of elements of the sequences matters. Thus, one could instead of sequences also consider sets.\n\nThe extra effort of using sequences, however, is justified since part or all of the structural rules may be omitted. Doing so, one obtains the so-called substructural logics.\n\nProperties of the system LK\n\nThis system of rules can be shown to be both sound and complete with respect to first-order logic, i.e. a statement  follows semantically from a set of premises   iff the sequent  can be derived by the above rules., wrote in 1967 that \"it was a major logical discovery by Gentzen 1934\u20135 that, when there is any (purely logical) proof of a proposition, there is a direct proof. The implications of this discovery are in theoretical logical investigations, rather than in building collections of proved formulas.\"\n\nIn the sequent calculus, the rule of cut is admissible. This result is also referred to as Gentzen's Hauptsatz (\"Main Theorem\").\n\nVariants\n\nThe above rules can be modified in various ways:\n\nMinor structural alternatives\n\nThere is some freedom of choice regarding the technical details of how sequents and structural rules are formalized. As long as every derivation in LK can be effectively transformed to a derivation using the new rules and vice versa, the modified rules may still be called LK.\n\nFirst of all, as mentioned above, the sequents can be viewed to consist of sets or multisets. In this case, the rules for permuting and (when using sets) contracting formulae are obsolete.\n\nThe rule of weakening will become admissible, when the axiom (I) is changed, such that any sequent of the form  can be concluded. This means that  proves  in any context. Any weakening that appears in a derivation can then be performed right at the start. This may be a convenient change when constructing proofs bottom-up.\n\nIndependent of these one may also change the way in which contexts are split within the rules: In the cases , and  the left context is somehow split into  and  when going upwards. Since contraction allows for the duplication of these, one may assume that the full context is used in both branches of the derivation. By doing this, one assures that no important premises are lost in the wrong branch. Using weakening, the irrelevant parts of the context can be eliminated later.\n\nAbsurdity\nOne can introduce , the absurdity constant representing false, with the axiom:\n\nOr if, as described above, weakening is to be an admissible rule, then with the axiom:\n\nWith , negation can be subsumed as a special case of implication, via the definition .\n\nSubstructural logics\n\nAlternatively, one may restrict or forbid the use of some of the structural rules. This yields a variety of substructural logic systems. They are generally weaker than LK (i.e., they have fewer theorems), and thus not complete with respect to the standard semantics of first-order logic. However, they have other interesting properties that have led to applications in theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.\n\nIntuitionistic sequent calculus: System LJ\n\nSurprisingly, some small changes in the rules of LK suffice to turn it into a proof system for intuitionistic logic., wrote: \"Der Unterschied zwischen intuitionistischer und klassischer Logik ist bei den Kalk\u00fclen LJ und LK \u00e4u\u00dferlich ganz anderer Art als bei NJ und NK. Dort bestand er in Weglassung bzw. Hinzunahme des Satzes vom ausgeschlossenen Dritten, w\u00e4hrend er hier durch die Sukzedensbedingung ausgedr\u00fcckt wird.\" English translation: \"The difference between intuitionistic and classical logic is in the case of the calculi LJ and LK of an extremely, totally different kind to the case of NJ and NK. In the latter case, it consisted of the removal or addition respectively of the excluded middle rule, whereas in the former case, it is expressed through the succedent conditions.\" To this end, one has to restrict to sequents with exactly one formula on the right-hand side, and modify the rules to maintain this invariant.  For example,  is reformulated as follows (where C is an arbitrary formula):\n\nThe resulting system is called LJ. It is sound and complete with respect to intuitionistic logic and admits a similar cut-elimination proof. This can be used in proving disjunction and existence properties.\n\nIn fact, the only two rules in LK that need to be restricted to single-formula consequents are  and Structural Proof Theory (CUP, 2001), Sara Negri and Jan van Plato (and the latter can be seen as a special case of the former, via  as described above). When multi-formula consequents are interpreted as disjunctions, all of the other inference rules of LK are actually derivable in LJ, while the offending rule is\n\nThis amounts to the propositional formula , a classical tautology that is not constructively valid.\n\nSee also\n Cirquent calculus\n Nested sequent calculus\n Resolution (logic)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n\nExternal links\n \n A Brief Diversion: Sequent Calculus\n Interactive tutorial of the Sequent Calculus\n\nCategory:Proof theory\nCategory:Logical calculi\nCategory:Automated theorem proving"}

Released on Myrrh Records in 1994, the album was nominated in the Best Contemporary Album category at the 26th GMA Dove Awards.\n\nBackground and release\nDuncan said of the album's message: \"(People) have to understand that even though they might not be where they would like to be in their spirituality, they should not be discouraged or give up.\" According to Duncan, the theme was something he was personally dealing with at the time of the album's recording, and that he found peace during the process. Slow Revival, released in 1994, peaked at number five on the Billboard Top Contemporary Christian chart. Three singles from the album - \"Traces of Heaven\", \"Things Are Gonna Change\", and \"United We Stand\" - reached number one on the Christian radio charts. In a review of the album, Mike Joyce of The Washington Post wrote that Duncan's singing \"is far more colorful on the funk tracks, particularly 'Wheels of a Good Thing,' but even here his evangelical fervor is tempered by his sharp pop instincts.\" \nSlow Revival was nominated in the Best Contemporary Album category at the 26th GMA Dove Awards.\n\nPromotion\nTo support the album, Duncan embarked on the Slow Revival Tour with opening acts Rebecca St. James and Bob Carlisle. Concerts featured Duncan joining each artist on stage for a couple of songs during their respective sets. The three singers performed together for each show's finale. In a review of the tour stop in Nashville, Deborah Evans Price of Billboard called it \"a high-octane concert performance with a dash of late-night talk show zaniness.\" She noted that a NHK news crew filmed a segment of the show for a piece to air in Japan on the growing popularity at the time of contemporary Christian music.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\n Sources:\n\nMusicians\n Lead vocals \u2013 Bryan Duncan\n Keyboards and track arrangements \u2013 Michael Omartian (1, 2, 5, 6, 9),  Robbie Buchanan (3, 10) and Peter Wolf (4, 7, 8)\nAdditional keyboards \u2013 Alan Pasqua and Randy Lee\n Hammond B3 organ \u2013 Alan Pasqua\n Guitars \u2013 Dann Huff and Gary Chapman\n Bass \u2013 Cedric Lee, John Peano and Neil Stubenhaus\n Drums and percussion \u2013 Curt Bisquera, Eric Darken, Steve Latination, John Robinson and Carlos Vega\n Saxophones \u2013 David Lhebo\n Trombone \u2013 Dennis Good\n Backing vocals \u2013 David Pack, Darrell Brown, Lori Perry, Carol Perry, Sharon Perry, Shaun Murphy, Tony Gillis, Ann Bailey and Dan Posthuma\n Guest vocals on \"United We Stand\" \u2013 Anointed (Steve Crawford, Da'dra Crawford, Mary Tiller and Nee-C Walls)\n Strings \u2013 The Nashville String Machine\n String arrangements \u2013 John Darnall\n\n Production\n Produced by Dan Posthuma\n Executive Producer \u2013 Ray Ware\n Rhythm tracks (5, 6 & 9) co-produced by Michael Omartian \n Engineered by Mike Mierau\n Additional engineering \u2013 Terry Christian, Paul Ericksen, Dan Garcia, Bert Stevens, Ross Pallone, Bryan Davis, Anthony Thomas, Doug Bieden, Doug Sarrett, Aaron Swihart, S.

{"title": "Stable theory", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_theory", "text": "In model theory, a complete theory  is called stable if it does not have too many types. One goal of classification theory is to divide all complete theories into those whose models can be classified and those whose models are too complicated to classify, and to classify all models in the cases where this can be done. Roughly speaking, if a theory is not stable then its models are too complicated and numerous to classify, while if a theory is stable there might be some hope of classifying its models, especially if the theory is superstable or totally transcendental.\n\nStability theory was started by , who introduced several of the fundamental concepts, such as totally transcendental theories and the Morley rank. \nStable and superstable theories were first introduced by , who is responsible for much of the development of stability theory. The definitive reference for stability theory is , though it is notoriously hard even for experts to read, as mentioned,  e.g., in .\n\nDefinitions\nT will be a complete theory in some language. \nT is called \u03ba-stable (for an infinite cardinal \u03ba) if for every set A of cardinality \u03ba the set of complete types over A has cardinality \u03ba.\n\u03c9-stable is an alternative name for \u21350-stable.\nT is called stable if it is \u03ba-stable for some infinite cardinal \u03ba\nT is called unstable if it is not \u03ba-stable for any infinite cardinal \u03ba.\nT is called superstable if it is \u03ba-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals \u03ba.\nTotally transcendental theories are those such that every formula has Morley rank less than \u221e.\n\nAs usual, a model of some language is said to have one of these properties if the complete theory of the model has that property.\n\nAn incomplete theory is defined to have one of these properties if every completion, or equivalently every model, has this property.\n\nUnstable theories\nRoughly speaking, a theory is unstable if one can use it to encode the ordered set of natural numbers. More precisely, if there is a model M and a formula \u03a6(X,Y) in 2n variables X\u00a0=\u00a0x1,...,xn and Y\u00a0=\u00a0y1,...,yn defining a relation on  Mn with an infinite totally ordered subset  then the theory is unstable. (Any infinite totally ordered set has a subset isomorphic to either the positive or negative integers under the usual order, so one can assume the totally ordered subset is ordered like the positive integers.) The totally ordered subset need not be definable in the theory.\n\nThe number of models of an unstable theory T of any uncountable cardinality \u03ba\u00a0\u2265\u00a0|T| is the maximum possible number 2\u03ba.\n\nExamples:\nMost sufficiently complicated theories, such as set theories and Peano arithmetic, are unstable.\nThe theory of the rational numbers, considered as an ordered set, is unstable. Its theory is the theory of dense linear orders without endpoints.\nThe theory of addition of the natural numbers is unstable.\nAny infinite Boolean algebra is unstable.\nAny monoid with cancellation that is not a group is unstable, because if a is an element that is not a unit then the powers of a form an infinite totally ordered set under the relation of divisibility. For a similar reason any integral domain that is not a field is unstable.\nThere are many unstable nilpotent groups. One example is the infinite dimensional Heisenberg group over the integers: this is generated by elements xi, yi, z for all natural numbers i, with the relations that any of these two generators commute except that xi and  yi have commutator z for any i.  If  ai is the element x0x1...xi\u22121yi then ai and aj have commutator z exactly when i\u00a0<\u00a0j, so they form an infinite total order under a definable relation, so the group is unstable.\nReal closed fields are unstable, as they are infinite and have a definable total order.\n\nStable theories\nT is called stable if it is \u03ba-stable for some cardinal \u03ba.   \nExamples:\nThe theory of any module over a ring is stable.\nThe theory of a countable number of equivalence relations En for n a natural number such that each equivalence relation has an infinite number of equivalence classes and  each equivalence class of En is the union of an infinite number of different classes of En+1 is stable but not superstable.\n showed that free groups, and more generally torsion free hyperbolic groups, are stable. Free groups on more than one generator are not superstable.\nA differentially closed field is stable. If it has non-zero characteristic it is not superstable, and if it has zero characteristic it is totally transcendental.\n\nSuperstable theories\nT is called superstable if it is stable for all sufficiently large cardinals, so all superstable theories are stable.  For countable T superstability is equivalent to stability for all \u03ba\u22652\u03c9.\nThe following conditions on a theory T are equivalent:\nT is superstable.\nAll types of T are ranked by at least one notion of rank.\nT is \u03ba-stable for all sufficiently large cardinals \u03ba\nT is \u03ba-stable for all  cardinals \u03ba that are at least 2|T|.\n\nIf a theory is superstable but not totally transcendental it is called strictly superstable.\n\nThe number of countable models of a countable superstable theory must be 1, \u21350, \u21351, or 2\u03c9. If the number of models is 1 the theory is totally transcendental.  There are examples with  1, \u21350 or 2\u03c9 models, and it is not known if there are examples with \u21351 models if the continuum hypothesis does not hold. If a theory T is not superstable then the number of models of cardinality \u03ba>|T|  is 2\u03ba.\n\nExamples:\nThe additive group of integers is superstable, but not totally transcendental. It has 2\u03c9 countable models.\nThe theory with a countable number of unary relations Pi with model the positive integers where Pi(n) is interpreted as saying n is divisible by the nth prime is superstable but not totally transcendental.\nAn abelian group A is superstable if and only if there are only finitely many pairs (p,n) with p prime, n a natural number, with pnA/pn+1A infinite.\n\nTotally transcendental theories and \u03c9-stable\nTotally transcendental theories are those such that every formula has Morley rank less than \u221e. Totally transcendental theories are stable in \u03bb whenever \u03bb\u2265|T|, so they are always superstable. \u03c9-stable is an alternative name for \u21350-stable. \u03c9-stable theories  in a countable language are \u03ba-stable for all infinite cardinals \u03ba. If |T| is countable then T is totally transcendental if and only if it is \u03c9-stable. More generally, T is totally transcendental if and only if every restriction of T to a countable language is \u03c9-stable.\n\nExamples:\nAny \u03c9-stable theory is totally transcendental.\nAny finite model is totally transcendental.\nAn infinite field is totally transcendental if and only if it is  algebraically closed. (Macintyre's theorem.)\nA differentially closed field in characteristic 0 is totally transcendental.\nAny theory with a countable language that is categorical for some uncountable cardinal is totally transcendental.\nAn abelian group  is totally transcendental if and only if it is the direct sum of a divisible group and a group of bounded exponent.\nAny linear algebraic group over an algebraically closed field is totally transcendental.\nAny group of finite Morley rank is totally transcendental.\n\nSee also\nSpectrum of a theory\nMorley's categoricity theorem\nList of first-order theories\nStability spectrum\n\nReferences\nJ.T.

{"title": "Tarski's undefinability theorem", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem", "text": "Tarski's undefinability theorem, stated and proved by Alfred Tarski in 1936, is an important limitative result in mathematical logic, the foundations of mathematics, and in formal semantics. Informally, the theorem states that arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic.\n\nThe theorem applies more generally to any sufficiently strong formal system, showing that truth in the standard model of the system cannot be defined within the system.\n\n History \nIn 1931, Kurt G\u00f6del published the incompleteness theorems, which he proved in part by showing how to represent the syntax of formal logic within first-order arithmetic. Each expression of the formal language of arithmetic is assigned a distinct number. This procedure is known variously as G\u00f6del numbering, coding and, more generally, as arithmetization. In particular, various sets of expressions are coded as sets of numbers. It turns out that for various syntactic properties (such as being a formula, being a sentence, etc.), these sets are computable. Moreover, any computable set of numbers can be defined by some arithmetical formula. For example, there are formulas in the language of arithmetic defining the set of codes for arithmetic sentences, and for provable arithmetic sentences.\n\nThe undefinability theorem shows that this encoding cannot be done for semantic concepts such as truth. It shows that no sufficiently rich interpreted language can represent its own semantics. A corollary is that any metalanguage capable of expressing the semantics of some object language must have expressive power exceeding that of the object language. The metalanguage includes primitive notions, axioms, and rules absent from the object language, so that there are theorems provable in the metalanguage not provable in the object language.\n\nThe undefinability theorem is conventionally attributed to Alfred Tarski. G\u00f6del also discovered the undefinability theorem in 1930, while proving his incompleteness theorems published in 1931, and well before the 1936 publication of Tarski's work (Murawski 1998). While G\u00f6del never published anything bearing on his independent discovery of undefinability, he did describe it in a 1931 letter to John von Neumann. Tarski had obtained almost all results of his 1936 paper Der Wahrheitsbegriff in den formalisierten Sprachen between 1929 and 1931, and spoke about them to Polish audiences.  However, as he emphasized in the paper, the undefinability theorem was the only result he did not obtain earlier. According to the footnote of the undefinability theorem (Satz I) of the 1936 paper, the theorem and the sketch of the proof were added to the paper only after the paper was sent to print. When he presented the paper to the Warsaw Academy of Science on March 21, 1931, he wrote only some conjectures instead of the results after his own investigations and partly after G\u00f6del's short report on the incompleteness theorems \"Einige metamathematische Resultate \u00fcber Entscheidungsdefinitheit und Widerspruchsfreiheit\", Akd. der Wiss. in Wien, 1930.\n\n Statement of the theorem \nWe will first state a simplified version of Tarski's theorem, then state and prove in the next section the theorem Tarski actually proved in 1936.\nLet L be the language of first-order arithmetic, and let N be the standard structure for L. Thus (L, N) is the \"interpreted first-order language of arithmetic.\"  Each sentence x in L has a G\u00f6del number g(x). Let T denote the set of  L-sentences true in N, and T* the set of G\u00f6del numbers of the sentences in T. The following theorem answers the question: Can T* be defined by a formula of first-order arithmetic?\n\nTarski's undefinability theorem:  There is no L-formula True(n) that defines T*.\nThat is, there is no L-formula True(n) such that for every L-formula A, True(g(A)) \u2194 A holds.\n\nInformally, the theorem says that given some formal arithmetic, the concept of truth in that arithmetic is not definable using the expressive means that that arithmetic affords. This implies a major limitation on the scope of \"self-representation.\" It is possible to define a formula True(n) whose extension is T*, but only by drawing on a metalanguage whose expressive power goes beyond that of L. For example, a truth predicate for first-order arithmetic can be defined in second-order arithmetic. However, this formula would only be able to define a truth predicate for sentences in the original language L. To define a truth predicate for the metalanguage would require a still higher \"metametalanguage\", and so on.\n\nThe theorem just stated is a corollary of Post's theorem about the arithmetical hierarchy, proved some years after Tarski (1936).  A semantic proof of Tarski's theorem from Post's theorem is obtained by reductio ad absurdum as follows. Assuming  T* is arithmetically definable, there is a natural number n such that T* is definable by a formula at level  of the arithmetical hierarchy.  However, T* is -hard for all k.  Thus the arithmetical hierarchy collapses at level n, contradicting Post's theorem.\n\n General form of the theorem \nTarski proved a stronger theorem than the one stated above, using an entirely syntactical method. The resulting theorem applies to any formal language with negation, and with sufficient capability for self-reference that the diagonal lemma holds. First-order arithmetic satisfies these preconditions, but the theorem applies to much more general formal systems.\n\nTarski's undefinability theorem (general form): Let (L,N) be any interpreted formal language which includes negation and has a G\u00f6del numbering g(x) such that for every L-formula A(x) there is a formula B such that B \u2194 A(g(B)) holds in N. Let T* be the set of G\u00f6del numbers of L-sentences true in N.  Then there is no L-formula True(n) which defines T*. That is, there is no L-formula True(n) such that for every L-formula A, True(g(A)) \u2194 A is itself true in N.\n\nThe proof of Tarski's undefinability theorem in this form is again by reductio ad absurdum. Suppose that an L- formula True(n) defines T*. In particular, if A is a sentence of arithmetic then True(g(A)) holds in N if and only if A is true in N. Hence for all A, the Tarski T-sentence True(g(A)) \u2194 A is true in N. But the diagonal lemma yields a counterexample to this equivalence, by giving a \"Liar\" sentence S such that S \u2194 \u00acTrue(g(S)) holds in N. Thus no L-formula True(n) can define T*. QED.\n\nThe formal machinery of this proof is wholly elementary except for the diagonalization that the diagonal lemma requires. The proof of the diagonal lemma is likewise surprisingly simple; for example, it does not invoke recursive functions in any way. The proof does assume that every L-formula has a G\u00f6del number, but the specifics of a coding method are not required. Hence Tarski's theorem is much easier to motivate and prove than the more celebrated theorems of G\u00f6del about the metamathematical properties of first-order arithmetic.\n\nDiscussion\nSmullyan (1991, 2001) has argued forcefully that Tarski's undefinability theorem deserves much of the attention garnered by G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems. That the latter theorems have much to say about all of mathematics and more controversially, about a range of philosophical issues (e.g., Lucas 1961) is less than evident. Tarski's theorem, on the other hand, is not directly about mathematics but about the inherent limitations of any formal language sufficiently expressive to be of real interest. Such languages are necessarily capable of enough self-reference for the diagonal lemma to apply to them. The broader philosophical import of Tarski's theorem is more strikingly evident.\n\nAn interpreted language is strongly-semantically-self-representational exactly when the language contains predicates and function symbols defining all the semantic concepts specific to the language. Hence the required functions include the \"semantic valuation function\" mapping a formula A to its truth value ||A||, and the \"semantic denotation function\" mapping a term t to the object it denotes. Tarski's theorem then generalizes as follows: No sufficiently powerful language is strongly-semantically-self-representational.\n\nThe undefinability theorem does not prevent truth in one theory from being defined in a stronger theory. For example, the set of (codes for) formulas of first-order Peano arithmetic that are true in N is definable by a formula in second order arithmetic. Similarly, the set of true formulas of the standard model of second order arithmetic (or n-th order arithmetic for any n) can be defined by a formula in first-order ZFC.\n\n References \n J.L.

{"title": "Theory (mathematical logic)", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_%28mathematical_logic%29", "text": "In mathematical logic, a theory (also called a formal theory) is a set of sentences in a formal language. Usually a deductive system is understood from context. An element  of a theory  is then called a theorem of the theory. In deductive systems there is usually a subset  called \"the set of axioms\" of the theory  and the deductive system is called an \"axiomatic system\". Clearly, every axiom is also a theorem. A first-order theory is a set of first-order sentences (theorems) recursively obtained by the inference rules of the system applied to the set of axioms.\n\n Theories expressed in formal language generally \n\nWhen defining theories for foundational purposes, additional care must be taken and normal set-theoretic language may not be appropriate.\n\nThe construction of a theory begins by specifying a definite non-empty conceptual class , the elements of which are called statements. These initial statements are often called the primitive elements or elementary statements of the theory, to distinguish them from other statements which may be derived from them.\n\nA theory  is a conceptual class consisting of certain of these elementary statements. The elementary statements which belong to  are called the elementary theorems of  and said to be true. In this way, a theory is a way of designating a subset of  which consists entirely of true statements.\n\nThis general way of designating a theory stipulates that the truth of any of its elementary statements is not known without reference to . Thus the same elementary statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is as in ordinary language, where statements such as \"He is an honest person.\" cannot be judged to be true or false without reference to some interpretation of who \"He\" is and, for that matter, what an \"honest person\" is under this theory.Haskell Curry, Foundations of Mathematical Logic, 2010.\n\n Subtheories and extensions \n\nA theory S is a subtheory of a theory T if S is a subset of T. If T is a subset of S then S is an extension or supertheory of T\n\n Deductive theories \n\nA theory is said to be a deductive theory if  is an inductive class. That is, that its content is based on some formal deductive system and that some of its elementary statements are taken as axioms. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.\n\n Consistency and completeness \n\nA syntactically consistent theory is a theory from which not every sentence in the underlying language can be proven (with respect to some deductive system which is usually clear from context). In a deductive system (such as first-order logic) that satisfies the principle of explosion, this is equivalent to requiring that there is no sentence \u03c6 such that both \u03c6  and its negation can be proven from the theory.\n\nA satisfiable theory is a theory that has a  model. This means there is a structure M that satisfies every sentence in the theory. Any satisfiable theory is syntactically consistent, because the structure satisfying the theory will satisfy exactly one of \u03c6 and the negation of \u03c6, for each sentence \u03c6.\n\nA consistent theory is sometimes defined to be a syntactically consistent theory, and sometimes defined to be a satisfiable theory. For first-order logic, the most important case, it follows from the completeness theorem that the two meanings coincide. In other logics, such as second-order logic, there are syntactically consistent theories that are not satisfiable, such as \u03c9-inconsistent theories.\n\nA complete consistent theory (or just a complete theory) is a consistent theory T such that for every sentence \u03c6 in its language, either \u03c6 is provable from T or T  {\u03c6} is inconsistent. For theories closed under logical consequence, this means that for every sentence \u03c6, either \u03c6 or its negation is contained in the theory.  An incomplete theory is a consistent theory that is not complete.\n\nSee also \u03c9-consistent theory for a stronger notion of consistency.\n\n Interpretation of a theory \n\nAn interpretation of a theory is the relationship between a theory and some contensive subject matter when there is a many-to-one correspondence between certain elementary statements of the theory, and certain contensive statements related to the subject matter. If every elementary statement in the theory has a contensive correspondent it is called a full interpretation, otherwise it is called a partial interpretation.Haskell Curry, Foundations of Mathematical Logic, 2010, p. 48.\n\n Theories associated with a structure \n\nEach structure has several associated theories. The complete theory of a structure A is the set of all first-order sentences over the signature of A which are satisfied by A. It is denoted by Th(A). More generally, the theory of K, a class of \u03c3-structures, is the set of all first-order \u03c3-sentences that are satisfied by all structures in K, and is denoted by Th(K). Clearly Th(A) = Th({A}). These notions can also be defined with respect to other logics.\n\nFor each \u03c3-structure A, there are several associated theories in a larger signature \u03c3' that extends \u03c3 by adding one new constant symbol for each element of the domain of A. (If the new constant symbols are identified with the elements of A which they represent, \u03c3' can be taken to be \u03c3  A.) The cardinality of \u03c3' is thus the larger of the cardinality of \u03c3 and the cardinality of A.\n\nThe diagram of A consists of all atomic or negated atomic \u03c3'-sentences that are satisfied by A and is denoted by diagA. The positive diagram of A is the set of all atomic \u03c3'-sentences which A satisfies. It is denoted by diag+A.  The elementary diagram of A is the set eldiagA of all first-order \u03c3'-sentences that are satisfied by A or, equivalently, the complete (first-order) theory of the natural expansion of A to the signature \u03c3'.\n\n First-order theories \n\nA first-order theory  is a set of sentences in a first-order formal language .\n\n Derivation in a first-order theory \n\nThere are many formal derivation (\"proof\") systems for first-order logic.\n\n Syntactic consequence in a first-order theory \n\nA formula A is a syntactic consequence of a first-order theory   if there is a derivation of A using only formulas in  as non-logical axioms. Such a formula A is also called a theorem of . The notation \"\" indicates A is a theorem of \n\n Interpretation of a first-order theory \n\nAn interpretation of a first-order theory provides a semantics for the formulas of the theory. An interpretation is said to satisfy a formula if the formula is true according to the interpretation. A model of a first-order theory  is an interpretation in which every formula of  is satisfied.\n\n First-order theories with identity \n\nA first-order theory  is a first-order theory with identity if  includes the identity relation symbol \"=\" and the reflexivity and substitution axiom schemes for this symbol.\n\n Topics related to first-order theories \n\nCompactness theorem\nConsistent set\nDeduction theorem\nEnumeration theorem\nLindenbaum's lemma\nL\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem\n\n Examples \n\nOne way to specify a theory is to define a set of axioms in a particular language. The theory can be taken to include just those axioms, or their logical or provable consequences, as desired.   Theories obtained this way include ZFC and Peano arithmetic.\n\nA second way to specify a theory is to begin with a structure and then let the theory be the set of sentences that are satisfied by the structure. This is one method for producing complete theories, described below.  Examples of theories of this sort include the sets of true sentences in the structures (N, +, \u00d7, 0, 1, =) and (R, +, \u00d7, 0, 1, =), where N is the set of natural numbers and R is the set of real numbers. The first of these, called the theory of true arithmetic, cannot be written as the set of logical consequences of any enumerable set of axioms.\nThe theory of (R, +, \u00d7, 0, 1, =) was shown by Tarski to be decidable; it is the theory of real closed fields.\n\n See also \n Axiomatic system\n Interpretability\n List of first-order theories\n\n References \n\n Further reading \n \n\n \nCategory:Logical expressions\n\nfr:Th\u00e9orie axiomatique"}
{"title": "Tortona", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortona", "text": "Tortona (;  , ) is a comune of Piemonte, in the Province of Alessandria, Italy. Tortona is sited on the right bank of the Scrivia between the plain of Marengo and the foothills of the Ligurian Apennines.\n\nHistory\nthumb|left|Tortona Cathedral (postcard from c. 1890)\nthumb|right|Piazza Duomo, with the cathedral and on the right the bishops' palace\n\nKnown in ancient times as Dertona, the city was probably the oldest colony under Roman rule in the westernmost section of the Valley of the Po, on the road leading from Genua (Genoa) to Placentia (Piacenza). The city was founded c. 123\u2013118 BC at the junction of the great roads; the Via Postumia and the Via Aemilia Scauri which merged to become the Via Julia Augusta. The site made Dertona an important military station under the Romans. Strabo speaks of it as one of the most considerable towns in this part of Italy, and from Pliny wrote that it was a Roman colony. Velleius mentions it among those founded under the Republic, it appears to have been recolonised under Augustus, from whence we find it bearing in inscriptions the title of Julia Dertona.Smith, William, ed. (1854\u20131857). \"Dertona\". Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography. London: John Murray; Vell. Pat., Historiae, i. 15; Plin., H.N., iii. 5. s. 7. The assassin of Caesar, Brutus, encamped at Dertona on his march in pursuit of Mark Antony, after the Battle of Mutina,Cic. ad Fam. xi. 1. 0 and it was one of the places where a body of troops was usually stationed during the later ages of the empire.Not. Dign. ii. p. 121.\n\nA bishopric was founded at Tortona early, but its first bishops are purely legendary, like Saint Marcianus of Tortona, called the first bishop of Piedmont and a disciple of Barnabas, the companion of Paul. Until the 9th century, the city was under the rule of its bishop; in 1090 it became a free commune with the name of Terdona.  In 1133 the diocese was separated from the archbishopric of Milan to the new archdiocese of Genoa (CE \"Lombardy\").\n\nIn 1155 Frederick Barbarossa besieged, captured and leveled Tortona to the ground, leaving not one stone upon another.Norwich, John Julius. Byzantium: The Decline and Fall (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996) p. 108\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Tortona was a faithful ally of the Guelphs and was destroyed several times. From 1260 to 1347 the city was dominated by a series of different Italian noble families and adventurers like Facino Cane, who in the unsettled affairs of Lombardy had assembled a string of lordships and great wealth which he bequeathed to his wife, Beatrice, and arranged with his friends that a marriage should be effected between her and Filippo Maria Visconti. According to MachiavelliHistory of Florence, ch. 7 \"By this union Filippo became powerful, and reacquired Milan and the whole of Lombardy. By way of being grateful for these numerous favors, as princes commonly are, he accused Beatrice of adultery and caused her to be put to death\". In this way, in 1347, Tortona was decisively incorporated into the territories of the Duchy of Milan, under which remained until 1735. Then following the vicissitudes of the War of the Polish Succession, the city was occupied by the King of Sardinia, and \"count of Tortona\" was added to the titles of the House of Savoy.\n\n Colli Tortonesi \nTortona is the capital of an area known as Colli Tortonesi, which stretches from the town to the border with Liguria. The area is known for the variety and of its products and for the intensive wine production, including Barbera, Dolcetto, Moscato and Timorasso, the autochthonous wine of the region which traces its origin back to the 14th century. Truffles are another important fruit of this land and the Colli Tortonesi is the only place in Piedmont to have three varieties of truffle: White truffle, Black Truffle and scorzone.\n\nMain sights\nRoman remains, traditionally identified as the Mausoleum of the Roman Emperor Maiorianus.\nPalazzo Guidobono (15th century), restructured in 1939 to bring back its a Gothic fa\u00e7ade.

{"title": "Unary numeral system", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system", "text": "The unary numeral system is the bijective base-1 numeral system. It is the simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers:. in order to represent a number N, an arbitrarily chosen symbol representing 1 is repeated N times.. For example, the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... would be represented in this system as.\n1, 11, 111, 1111, 11111, 111111...\nThese numbers should be distinguished from repunits, which are also written as sequences of ones but have their usual decimal numerical interpretation.\n\nThis system is used in tallying. For example, using the tally mark |, the number 3 is represented as |||. In East Asian cultures, the number three is represented as \u201c\u4e09\u201d (1 and 2 are represented similarly), a character that is drawn with three strokes.. In China and Japan, the character \"\u6b63\" is used to represent \"five\" in some situations because it is drawn with 5 strokes.Hsieh, Hui-Kuang (1981) \"Chinese tally mark\", The American Statistician, 35 (3), p. 174, Ken Lunde, Daisuke Miura, L2/16-046: Proposal to encode five ideographic tally marks, 2016\n\nOperations\nAddition and subtraction are particularly simple in the unary system, as they involve little more than string concatenation.. See in particular p.\u00a0 48. The Hamming weight or population count operation that counts the number of nonzero bits in a sequence of binary values may also be interpreted as a conversion from unary to binary numbers.. However, multiplication is more cumbersome and has often been used as a test case for the design of Turing machines....\n\nComplexity\nCompared to standard positional numeral systems, the unary system is inconvenient and hence is not used in practice for large calculations. It occurs in some decision problem descriptions in theoretical computer science (e.g. some P-complete problems), where it is used to \"artificially\" decrease the run-time or space requirements of a problem. For instance, the problem of integer factorization is suspected to require more than a polynomial function of the length of the input as run-time if the input is given in binary, but it only needs linear runtime if the input is presented in unary... However, this is potentially misleading. Using a unary input is slower for any given number, not faster; the distinction is that a binary (or larger base) input is proportional to the base 2 (or larger base) logarithm of the number while unary input is proportional to the number itself. Therefore, while the run-time and space requirement in unary looks better as function of the input size, it does not represent a more efficient solution..\n\nIn computational complexity theory, unary numbering is used to distinguish strongly NP-complete problems from problems that are NP-complete but not strongly NP-complete. A problem in which the input includes some numerical parameters is strongly NP-complete if it remains NP-complete even when the size of the input is made artificially larger by representing the parameters in unary. For such a problem, there exist hard instances for which all parameter values are at most polynomially large..\n\nApplications\nUnary numbering is used as part of some data compression algorithms such as Golomb coding.. It also forms the basis for the Peano axioms for formalizing arithmetic within mathematical logic..\nA form of unary notation called Church encoding is used to represent numbers within lambda calculus..\n\n See also \nUnary coding\nOne-hot encoding\n\n References \n\n External links \n\n \n\nCategory:Numeral systems\nCategory:1 (number)\nCategory:Elementary mathematics"}
{"title": "Universality probability", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universality_probability", "text": " Background \nA Turing machine is a basic model of computation.  Some Turing machines might be specific to doing particular calculations.  For example, a Turing machine might take input which comprises two numbers and then produce output which is the product of their multiplication.  Another Turing machine might take input which is a list of numbers and then give output which is those numbers sorted in order.\n\nA Turing machine which has the ability to simulate any other Turing machine is called universal - in other words, a Turing machine (TM) is said to be a universal Turing machine (or UTM) if, given any other TM, there is a some input (or \"header\") such that the first TM given that input \"header\" will forever after behave like the second TM.\n\nAn interesting mathematical and philosophical question then arises.  If a universal Turing machine is given random input (for suitable definition of random), how probable is it that it remains universal forever?\n\n Definition \nGiven a prefix-free Turing machine, the universality probability of it is the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a binary string) is prefixed by a random binary string. More formally, it is the probability measure of reals (infinite binary sequences) which have the property that every initial segment of them preserves the universality of the given Turing machine. This notion was introduced by the computer scientist Chris Wallace and was first explicitly  discussed in print in an article by Dowe* (and here) (and a subsequent article*Dowe, D. L. (2011), \"MML, hybrid Bayesian network graphical models, statistical consistency, invariance and uniqueness\", Handbook of the Philosophy of Science - (HPS Volume 7) Philosophy of Statistics, P.S. Bandyopadhyay and M.R. Forster (eds.), Elsevier, pp901-982). However, relevant discussions also appear in an earlier article by Wallace and Dowe.Wallace, C. S. & Dowe, D. L. 1999 Minimum message length and Kolmogorov complexity Computer J. 42, 270\u2013283\n\n Universality probabilities of prefix-free UTMs are non-zero \nAlthough the universality probability of a UTM (UTM) was originally suspected to be zero, relatively simple proofs exist that the supremum of the set of universality probabilities is equal to 1, such as a proof based on random walks*Hernandez-Orallo, J. & Dowe, D. L. (2013), \"On Potential Cognitive Abilities in the Machine Kingdom\", Minds and Machines, Vol. 23, Issue 2, pp179-210 and a proof in Barmpalias and Dowe (2012).\nOnce one has one prefix-free UTM with a non-zero universality probability, it immediately follows that all prefix-free UTMs have non-zero universality probability.\nFurther, because the supremum of the set of universality probabilities is 1 and because the set \nis dense in the interval [0, 1],\nsuitable constructions of UTMs\n(e.g., if U is a UTM, define a\nUTM U2 by U2(0s) halts for all strings s,\nU2(1s) = U(s) for all s) gives that the set of universality probabilities is\ndense in the open interval (0, 1).\n\n Characterization and randomness of universality probability \nUniversality probability was thoroughly studied and characterized by Barmpalias and Dowe in 2012.\nSeen as real numbers, these probabilities were completely characterized in terms of notions in computability theory\nand algorithmic information theory.\nIt was shown that when the underlying machine is universal, these numbers are highly algorithmically random. More specifically, it is Martin-L\u00f6f random relative to the third iteration of the halting problem. In other words, they are random relative to null sets that can be defined with four quantifiers in Peano arithmetic. Vice versa, given such a highly random number (with appropriate approximation properties) there is a Turing machine with universality probability that number.\n\n Relation with Chaitin's constant \nUniversality probabilities are very related to the Chaitin constant, which is the halting probability of a universal prefix-free machine. In a sense, they are complementary to the halting probabilities of universal machines relative to the third iteration of the halting problem. In particular, the universality probability can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the halting problem. Vice versa, the non-halting probability of any prefix-free machine with this highly non-computable oracle is the universality probability of some prefix-free machine.\n\n Probabilities of machines as examples of highly random numbers \nUniversality probability provides a concrete and somewhat natural example of a highly random number (in the sense of algorithmic information theory). In the same sense, Chaitin's constant provides a concrete example of a random number (but for a much weaker notion of algorithmic randomness).\n\n See also \n Incompleteness theorem\n Kolmogorov complexity\n Algorithmic probability\n Kolmogorov complexity\n Minimum message length\n Inductive inference\n Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference\n History of randomness\n\n References \n\n External links \n\n (and here).\n Dowe, D.

{"title": "Where Mathematics Comes From", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From", "text": "Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being (hereinafter WMCF) is a book by George Lakoff, a cognitive linguist, and Rafael E. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a psychologist. Published in 2000, WMCF seeks to found a cognitive science of mathematics, a theory of embodied mathematics based on conceptual metaphor.\n\nWMCF definition of mathematics\nMathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:\n\"It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science.\" (WMCF, pp. 50, 377)\n\nNikolay Lobachevsky said \"There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.\" A common type of conceptual blending process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.\n\n Human cognition and mathematics \nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes metaphorically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.\n\nWMCF builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of metaphor and image schemata from second-generation cognitive science.  Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from WMCF.\n\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. WMCF advocates (and includes some examples of) a cognitive idea analysis of mathematics which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the philosophy of mathematics.\n\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called subitizing, to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with \"impossible\" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.\n\nThe authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of metaphorical constructions. For example, the Pythagorean position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the square root of two, arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.\n\nMuch of WMCF deals with the important concepts of infinity and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the actual infinite. Thus much of WMCF is, in effect, a study of the epistemological foundations of the calculus. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez conclude that while the potential infinite is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the \"Basic Metaphor of Infinity\", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...\n\nWMCF emphatically rejects the Platonistic philosophy of mathematics. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is human mathematics, the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a \"transcendent\" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought\u2014colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.\n\nWMCF (p.\u00a081) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of closure. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.\n\nWMCF concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and Hersh (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.\n\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez cite Saunders Mac Lane (the inventor, with Samuel Eilenberg, of category theory) in support of their position. Mathematics, Form and Function (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.See especially the table in Mac Lane (1986), p. 35.\n\nEducators have taken some interest in what WMCF suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.\n\nExamples of mathematical metaphors\nConceptual metaphors described in WMCF, in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:\nArithmetic is motion along a path, object collection/construction;\nChange is motion;\nSets are containers, objects;\nContinuity is gapless;\nMathematical systems have an \"essence,\" namely their axiomatic algebraic structure;\nFunctions are sets of ordered pairs, curves in the Cartesian plane;\nGeometric figures are objects in space;\nLogical independence is geometric orthogonality;\nNumbers are sets, object collections, physical segments, points on a line;\nRecurrence is circular.\nMathematical reasoning requires variables ranging over some universe of discourse, so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. WMCF argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental Metonymy of Algebra.\n\nExample of metaphorical ambiguity\nWMCF (p.\u00a0151) includes the following example of what the authors term \"metaphorical ambiguity.\" Take the set  Then recall two bits of standard terminology from elementary set theory:\nThe recursive construction of the ordinal natural numbers, whereby 0 is , and  is \nThe ordered pair (a,b), defined as \nBy (1), A is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that A is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the ordered pair (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation \"metaphorically ambiguous.\" This simple example calls into question any Platonistic foundations for mathematics.\n\nWhile (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus set theory known as the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axiomatization, WMCF does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, Frege, Principia Mathematica, and New Foundations (a body of axiomatic set theory begun by Quine in 1937) define cardinals and ordinals as equivalence classes under the relations of equinumerosity and similarity, so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, A is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:\nA variant set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair more complicated than the usual one;\nTaking ordered pairs as primitive.\n\nThe Romance of Mathematics\nThe \"Romance of Mathematics\" is WMCFs light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:\n Mathematics is transcendent, namely it exists independently of human beings, and structures our actual physical universe and any possible universe. Mathematics is the language of nature, and is the primary conceptual structure we would have in common with extraterrestrial aliens, if any such there be.\nMathematical proof is the gateway to a realm of transcendent truth.\n Reasoning is logic, and logic is essentially mathematical. Hence mathematics structures all possible reasoning.\n Because mathematics exists independently of human beings, and reasoning is essentially mathematical, reason itself is disembodied. Therefore, artificial intelligence is possible, at least in principle.\n\nIt is very much an open question whether WMCF will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the philosophy of mathematics. Hence the main value of WMCF so far may be a critical one: its critique of Platonism and romanticism in mathematics.\n\n Critical response \n\nMany working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez. Reviews by mathematicians of WMCF in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the WMCFs philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, Fermat's last theorem means exactly what it meant when Fermat initially proposed it 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The metaphor and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal definition which mathematicians employ. However, WMCF points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.\n\nCritiques of WMCF include the humorous:\n\"It's difficult for me to conceive of a metaphor for a real number raised to a complex power, but if there is one, I'd sure like to see it.\" \u2014 Joseph AuslanderWhat is the Nature of Mathematics?, Michael Sutcliffe, referenced February 1, 2011\nand the physically informed:\n\n\"But their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered. For one thing, the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature, but also are part of nature. Perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place (through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life). Furthermore, it's one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known. It's something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected. When Paul Dirac's equations describing electrons produced more than one solution, he surmised that nature must possess other particles, now known as antimatter. But scientists did not discover such particles until after Dirac's math told him they must exist. If math is a human invention, nature seems to know what was going to be invented.\"\n\nLakoff made his reputation by linking linguistics to cognitive science and the analysis of metaphor. N\u00fa\u00f1ez, educated in Switzerland, is a product of Jean Piaget's school of cognitive psychology as a basis for logic and mathematics. N\u00fa\u00f1ez has thought much about the foundations of real analysis, the real and complex numbers, and the Basic Metaphor of Infinity. These topics, however, worthy though they be, form part of the superstructure of mathematics. Cognitive science should take more interest in the foundations of mathematics. And indeed, the authors do pay a fair bit of attention early on to logic, Boolean algebra and the Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms, even lingering a bit over group theory. But neither author is well-trained in logic (there is no index entry for \"quantifier\" or \"quantification\"), the philosophy of set theory, the axiomatic method, metamathematics, and model theory. Nor does WMCF say enough about the derivation of number systems (the Peano axioms go unmentioned), abstract algebra, equivalence and order relations, mereology, topology, and geometry.\n\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about WMCF, because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.See http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html  \n\nIt has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that WMCF establishes that the claim \"intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability\" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by Keith Devlin among others. The authors of WMCF have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.\n\nLakoff and N\u00fa\u00f1ez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which intuitionists and constructivists have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. Brouwer, the founder of the intuitionist/constructivist point of view, in his dissertation On the Foundation of Mathematics, argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.\n\nSumming up\nWMCF (pp.\u00a0378\u201379) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:\nThe result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct conceptual metaphors is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. Conceptual metaphor is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;\nSymbolic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;\nNot transcendent, but the result of human evolution and culture, to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;\nA system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;\nAn open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;\nOne of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.\n\nThe cognitive approach to formal systems, as described and implemented in WMCF, need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as Edward Zalta's theory of abstract objects. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the philosophy of mind, epistemology, metaphysics, and the history of ideas.\n\n See also \n Abstract object\n Cognitive science\n Cognitive science of mathematics\n Conceptual metaphor\n Embodied philosophy\n Foundations of mathematics\n From Action to Mathematics per Mac Lane\n Metaphor\n Philosophy of mathematics\n The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences\n\n Footnotes \n\n References \n Davis, Philip J., and Reuben Hersh, 1999 (1981).
